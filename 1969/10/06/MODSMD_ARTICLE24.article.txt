# The 						Bull Pen

### Fred Mann 
There's nothing like a trip to
Lafayette, Indiana to find out
where your head is at.
It all started with a 6:15 call
Friday morning. At that ap
pointed, ungodly hour, the L.
Stanford J.U. football team took
off for the San Jose airport. It was
cold and dark, and most everyone
was sleep walking.
The quiet stillness of the
morning was quickly broken by
Horowitz' mouth. While Steve
cracked jokes, Plunkett looked
excited, Ralston looked worried,
and Parrish looked tough.
I didn't know what to expect at
Purdue, but I was up for the trip.
It would be good to get away
from school for a while and cut
my first classes of the quarter.
Little did I know I would be
walking into a real live college
town.
The plane ride was fairly
uneventful except for the pilot, an
ex-night club comedian who
turned to aviation solely for the
trapped audience. (Just before the
landing in Indiana: "Gentlemen,
this may boggle your minds, but I
think we're going to make it.")
We did.
"Purdue University Airport"
the sign over the hanger read. A
greeting party of about 20 was
out to meet us, most there just to
stare at that football team from
one of the radical hotbeds of the
West Coast. Purdue itself is a very
nice campus—all red brick and
tree-shaded. A visitor sees endless
roads of frat houses, new build
ings, a great new basketball home
for Rick Mount (even more
attractive than Maples Pavilion,
hard as it is to believe), intramural
fields, and the enlarged stadium
Sports are big at Purdue.
I was taken along with other
sports writers from all over the
Bay Area to the Student Union,

our home away from home. It is a
hotel, cafeteria, coffee house, and
social "in" spot all in one. After
settling in, I set out to explore. In
the main lobby of the union a
student was wailing on the pipe
organ with "If Ever I Should
Leave You." The TV room was
crowded with people watching the
Mike Douglas Show. The union
newstand didn't carry Newsweek,
but seemed to be pushing Motor
Trend Magazine and American
Hunter (this month featuring an
article on appropriate guns for the
home.)
At this point I decided that it
was time to go to work, so I left
for Ross-Ade Stadium to watch
the Stanford workout. As the
Indians finished up their practice,
Jack Mollenkopf led out his
Purdue squad, including football
players, 20 team managers, and
the police force. Stanford was
hustled away from the area so the
ultra-secret Boilermaker practice
could take place. The cops were
everywhere.
Feeling unwanted and totally
rejected, I walked back to my
room passing on the way two
long-haired hippy Purdue peace
freaks, one with moustache.
Somehow, they just didn't look
right; I though it was my mental
attitude, or just the overall clean
cut appearance of the surround
ings that made them look super
strange. Then I noticed their
sta-pressed pants and penny
loafers. Can't afford to get too
freaky.
Friday night was a full one for
the traveling sports sage. First
came the Stanford press party at
the hot spot in town, the
Lafayette Holiday Inn. The party
was complete with alumni, booze,
and football talk. Sneaking off, I
stumbled into deep conversation
with R.F. Rush of the Purdue

University Police Department. Mr.
Rush, a veteran on the force,
broadened my horizons by telling
me about the big pot bust on
campus a few months back.
According to him, "these kids
were making pot and selling it all
over the state and Canada . . .But
they caught up with 'em." That's
how Lafayette, Indiana became
regarded as the international drug
capital of North America.
Concerning student demonstra
tions a friendly cab driver com
mented, "The hippies started
something last semester, I don't
remember what it was about, but
we brought the state police in the
stepped on them real quick."
I spoke with writers from the
Purdue Exponent (the daily
paper), and we came to the
conclusion that lots of school
papers are affectionately known
as radical rags. The "Purdue
All-American Band" took the
field playing "It's A Grand Old
Flag." The world's largest drum
was wheeled out on the field by
four M.P.'s and the milkshake
drinking song girl (check Sports
Illustrated 1968 cover article on
cheerleading) cartwheeled around.
The band (350 pieces, including
25 girl baton twirlers) played
"America The Beautiful" as the
P.A. announcer recited a short
speech entitled "I Am An Amer
ican." Just like the Stanford home
games.
We lost a great game and
quietly departed Indiana for the
Bay. It was an interesting week
end in a different type of
university. One member of the
team said after the game, "If
Purdue ever has a losing season,
the whole town will pack up and
move out." It may be true, but
the way they have been playing,
we'll never know for sure.

Lafayette, Indiana to find out
where your head is at.
It all started with a 6:15 call
Friday morning. At that ap
pointed, ungodly hour, the L.
Stanford J.U. football team took
off for the San Jose airport. It was
cold and dark, and most everyone
was sleep walking.
The quiet stillness of the
morning was quickly broken by
Horowitz' mouth. While Steve
cracked jokes, Plunkett looked
excited, Ralston looked worried,
and Parrish looked tough.
I didn't know what to expect at
Purdue, but I was up for the trip.
It would be good to get away
from school for a while and cut
my first classes of the quarter.
Little did I know I would be
walking into a real live college
town.
The plane ride was fairly
uneventful except for the pilot, an
ex-night club comedian who
turned to aviation solely for the
trapped audience. (Just before the
landing in Indiana: "Gentlemen,
this may boggle your minds, but I
think we're going to make it.")
We did.
"Purdue University Airport"
the sign over the hanger read. A
greeting party of about 20 was
out to meet us, most there just to
stare at that football team from
one of the radical hotbeds of the
West Coast. Purdue itself is a very
nice campus—all red brick and
tree-shaded. A visitor sees endless
roads of frat houses, new build
ings, a great new basketball home
for Rick Mount (even more
attractive than Maples Pavilion,
hard as it is to believe), intramural
fields, and the enlarged stadium
Sports are big at Purdue.
I was taken along with other
sports writers from all over the
Bay Area to the Student Union,

our home away from home. It is a
hotel, cafeteria, coffee house, and
social "in" spot all in one. After
settling in, I set out to explore. In
the main lobby of the union a
student was wailing on the pipe
organ with "If Ever I Should
Leave You." The TV room was
crowded with people watching the
Mike Douglas Show. The union
newstand didn't carry Newsweek,
but seemed to be pushing Motor
Trend Magazine and American
Hunter (this month featuring an
article on appropriate guns for the
home.)
At this point I decided that it
was time to go to work, so I left
for Ross-Ade Stadium to watch
the Stanford workout. As the
Indians finished up their practice,
Jack Mollenkopf led out his
Purdue squad, including football
players, 20 team managers, and
the police force. Stanford was
hustled away from the area so the
ultra-secret Boilermaker practice
could take place. The cops were
everywhere.
Feeling unwanted and totally
rejected, I walked back to my
room passing on the way two
long-haired hippy Purdue peace
freaks, one with moustache.
Somehow, they just didn't look
right; I though it was my mental
attitude, or just the overall clean
cut appearance of the surround
ings that made them look super
strange. Then I noticed their
sta-pressed pants and penny
loafers. Can't afford to get too
freaky.
Friday night was a full one for
the traveling sports sage. First
came the Stanford press party at
the hot spot in town, the
Lafayette Holiday Inn. The party
was complete with alumni, booze,
and football talk. Sneaking off, I
stumbled into deep conversation
with R.F. Rush of the Purdue

University Police Department. Mr.
Rush, a veteran on the force,
broadened my horizons by telling
me about the big pot bust on
campus a few months back.
According to him, "these kids
were making pot and selling it all
over the state and Canada . . .But
they caught up with 'em." That's
how Lafayette, Indiana became
regarded as the international drug
capital of North America.
Concerning student demonstra
tions a friendly cab driver com
mented, "The hippies started
something last semester, I don't
remember what it was about, but
we brought the state police in the
stepped on them real quick."
I spoke with writers from the
Purdue Exponent (the daily
paper), and we came to the
conclusion that lots of school
papers are affectionately known
as radical rags. The "Purdue
All-American Band" took the
field playing "It's A Grand Old
Flag." The world's largest drum
was wheeled out on the field by
four M.P.'s and the milkshake
drinking song girl (check Sports
Illustrated 1968 cover article on
cheerleading) cartwheeled around.
The band (350 pieces, including
25 girl baton twirlers) played
"America The Beautiful" as the
P.A. announcer recited a short
speech entitled "I Am An Amer
ican." Just like the Stanford home
games.
We lost a great game and
quietly departed Indiana for the
Bay. It was an interesting week
end in a different type of
university. One member of the
team said after the game, "If
Purdue ever has a losing season,
the whole town will pack up and
move out." It may be true, but
the way they have been playing,
we'll never know for sure.

where your head is at.
It all started with a 6:15 call
Friday morning. At that ap
pointed, ungodly hour, the L.
Stanford J.U. football team took
off for the San Jose airport. It was
cold and dark, and most everyone
was sleep walking.
The quiet stillness of the
morning was quickly broken by
Horowitz' mouth. While Steve
cracked jokes, Plunkett looked
excited, Ralston looked worried,
and Parrish looked tough.
I didn't know what to expect at
Purdue, but I was up for the trip.
It would be good to get away
from school for a while and cut
my first classes of the quarter.
Little did I know I would be
walking into a real live college
town.
The plane ride was fairly
uneventful except for the pilot, an
ex-night club comedian who
turned to aviation solely for the
trapped audience. (Just before the
landing in Indiana: "Gentlemen,
this may boggle your minds, but I
think we're going to make it.")
We did.
"Purdue University Airport"
the sign over the hanger read. A
greeting party of about 20 was
out to meet us, most there just to
stare at that football team from
one of the radical hotbeds of the
West Coast. Purdue itself is a very
nice campus—all red brick and
tree-shaded. A visitor sees endless
roads of frat houses, new build
ings, a great new basketball home
for Rick Mount (even more
attractive than Maples Pavilion,
hard as it is to believe), intramural
fields, and the enlarged stadium
Sports are big at Purdue.
I was taken along with other
sports writers from all over the
Bay Area to the Student Union,

our home away from home. It is a
hotel, cafeteria, coffee house, and
social "in" spot all in one. After
settling in, I set out to explore. In
the main lobby of the union a
student was wailing on the pipe
organ with "If Ever I Should
Leave You." The TV room was
crowded with people watching the
Mike Douglas Show. The union
newstand didn't carry Newsweek,
but seemed to be pushing Motor
Trend Magazine and American
Hunter (this month featuring an
article on appropriate guns for the
home.)
At this point I decided that it
was time to go to work, so I left
for Ross-Ade Stadium to watch
the Stanford workout. As the
Indians finished up their practice,
Jack Mollenkopf led out his
Purdue squad, including football
players, 20 team managers, and
the police force. Stanford was
hustled away from the area so the
ultra-secret Boilermaker practice
could take place. The cops were
everywhere.
Feeling unwanted and totally
rejected, I walked back to my
room passing on the way two
long-haired hippy Purdue peace
freaks, one with moustache.
Somehow, they just didn't look
right; I though it was my mental
attitude, or just the overall clean
cut appearance of the surround
ings that made them look super
strange. Then I noticed their
sta-pressed pants and penny
loafers. Can't afford to get too
freaky.
Friday night was a full one for
the traveling sports sage. First
came the Stanford press party at
the hot spot in town, the
Lafayette Holiday Inn. The party
was complete with alumni, booze,
and football talk. Sneaking off, I
stumbled into deep conversation
with R.F. Rush of the Purdue

University Police Department. Mr.
Rush, a veteran on the force,
broadened my horizons by telling
me about the big pot bust on
campus a few months back.
According to him, "these kids
were making pot and selling it all
over the state and Canada . . .But
they caught up with 'em." That's
how Lafayette, Indiana became
regarded as the international drug
capital of North America.
Concerning student demonstra
tions a friendly cab driver com
mented, "The hippies started
something last semester, I don't
remember what it was about, but
we brought the state police in the
stepped on them real quick."
I spoke with writers from the
Purdue Exponent (the daily
paper), and we came to the
conclusion that lots of school
papers are affectionately known
as radical rags. The "Purdue
All-American Band" took the
field playing "It's A Grand Old
Flag." The world's largest drum
was wheeled out on the field by
four M.P.'s and the milkshake
drinking song girl (check Sports
Illustrated 1968 cover article on
cheerleading) cartwheeled around.
The band (350 pieces, including
25 girl baton twirlers) played
"America The Beautiful" as the
P.A. announcer recited a short
speech entitled "I Am An Amer
ican." Just like the Stanford home
games.
We lost a great game and
quietly departed Indiana for the
Bay. It was an interesting week
end in a different type of
university. One member of the
team said after the game, "If
Purdue ever has a losing season,
the whole town will pack up and
move out." It may be true, but
the way they have been playing,
we'll never know for sure.
