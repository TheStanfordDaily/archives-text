# Angela To Teach, Regents Protest
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)-Com
munist Angela Davis, banned from
teaching a course for credit at the
University of California at Los
Angeles, will ask her students
Monday to ecide whether she
should lecture anyway, her de
partment chairman said Sunday.
Her course, "Recurring Philos
ophical Themes in Black Litera
ture," has 169 students registered.
California regents fired Miss
Davis, a Negro, on Sept. 19 after
she said she belonged to a
Communist club. They invoked a
regent's ruling in 1940 prohibiting
Communists from teaching at
state universities.

Miss Davis accused the regents
of racial prejudice and said she
would teach the class while
appealing the dismissal.
In an emergency session Friday,
the regents voted "that she shall
not be authorized to give instruc
tions in any course under the
jurisdiction of the school, depart
ment or any other academic
agency approved by the regents."
Chancellor Charles E. Young
said this means Miss Davis may
lecture, but that students won't
get academic credit for her course.
Kalish said he and UCLA's
Academic Senate feel that Phi
losophy 99 is a duly authorized
course for credit.
