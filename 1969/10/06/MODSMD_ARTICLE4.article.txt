# Three Legislators Speak
## Dominick 
### TOM GIVEN 
The Nixon administration was praised and the Democrats assailed
by Colorado's junior senator, Peter Dominick , speaking Saturday
before 75 people in Tresidder Memorial Union.
Dominick, who is chairman of the senate Republican campaign
committee for thirteen western states, issued a call to elect seven more
Republican senators in the 1970 elections.
"As long as the Democrats control the Senate, all committees are
headed by Democrats. They don't want to move on any of the bills
because it will change the power structure they have put together. If
the Administration is to have a chance to put these new and
innovative proposals into effect, we must regain control of the
committee structure."
He then charged that the Democrats had a vested interest in
retaining the present welfare system and student loan programs. He
indicated that his bills to expand the student loan program has been
killed in previous sessions because of pressure from Democratic
administration officials and senators.
"Senator Edward Kennedy killed the bill by proposing limitations
on the banks that in effect would discourage them from participating
in the program."
Student Tax Credits
In a prepared text, he was optimistic that his bill to allow tax credit
of up to $325 on one's income tax for college tuition bills would
become law. Such credit would be given to anyone who pays a
student's tuition.
Turning the floor over to questioning, he fielded questions
concerning federal aid to students, blacks and the GOP, the draft, and
the Haynsworth case.
He disagreed with colleagues calling for mandatory cut-offs of aid
to disruptive students, "this is not the role of the Congress. When
students disrupt a university it's up to the administrators to discipline
them."
Opposes Segregation
Asked by a black student about recent decisions to slowdown
school integration in the South, the Republican senator said that to
cut off federal funds was to hurt, not help, the schools. Citing his own
record favoring civil rights bills, he called for enforcing civil rights
legislation on a national level while decentralizing other government
functions.
He analyzed black mistrust of the GOP, "blacks want treatment in
recognition of past treatment they've received. We (the GOP) say here
are programs for all people to use. The blacks haven't understood that
a greater percentage of Republicans than Democrats has supported
every civil rights bill."
Favors Volunteer Army
The fourth-ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee argued that "if we strengthen the reserves and the
National Guard, and once we are out of Vietnam, we should get rid of
the draft and have a volunteer army." He favored interim use of a
lottery system with deferments for students and persons with valuable
skills. He defended the President's Vietnam policy saying, "We can't
just pull out, you can't just cut and run." He laid the blame for the
war to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, describing the Democrats as
"not a war party, but accident prone."
On Haynsworth, "I think you've got a real difference between
Fortas and Haynsworth. The only thing said about Haynsworth is that
he purchased stock in Brunswick after he made a decision but before
it was published. Many of those who are opposing Haynsworth are
doing so on strictly ideological, nor moral grounds."
