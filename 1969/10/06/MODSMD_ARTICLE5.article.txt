### BOB MICHELET SUSIE DAY 
Reacting to what Charles Dickens called the paradox between "the
worst of times and the best of times," South Dakota Senator George
McGovern addressed an overflow crowd at Memorial Church Sunday.
Delivering the lay sermon, McGovern said he was encouraged by
this paradox because although the world is beset with problems, there
is now "enough ferment and change that one is aware of the world's
troubles."
He said there is "no other time in America that so many people are
thinking about improving life."
The Democrat posed the question "Is there no grounds for hope
that we realize that we are in trouble?" and added that the advantage
(and paradox) of being lost is that you look for a new road to et out.
Lesson of War
McGovern, a 1968 Presidential candidate, dwelled heavily on the
Vietnam war, commenting that it also applies to Dickens' paradox.
He said the American people can see the misery of the war, but are
looking beyond it toward the lessons it has to give.
McGovern noted that President Nixon says he is not concerned how
the US got into Vietnam, but how it can get out. He said concerned
men must learn how the US became involved in order to prevent it
from occuring again.
He said the most important lesson-the United States can learn from
Vietnam is "we do not have the right or capacity to save a government
that does not have the support of its people."
In a brief news conference following the service, he said the 60,000
troops that have been withdrawn were "not enough, a token move,"
and all troops should be pulled out as soon as their safety can be
guaranteed.
In response to the call for a 60-day moratorium on war criticism,
McGovern responded "what we need is not a moratorium on free and
honest dissent, but a moratorium on killing in Southeast Asia."
He also urged support of the October 15 protest, saying the act of
students going into the community to discuss the war is "the highest
patriotic act in which any American can engage."
He added "to challenge the mistaken policy of the country is doing
it a great honor," and noted it is "still the truth that can make us
free."
Tunney at Seminar
Congressman John V. Tunney (D. Riverside), probable candidate
for the Democratic nomination to run against Senator George Murphy
next year, participated in the Mexican-American Seminar on campus
Friday.
Tunney said that he has been in contact with Cesar Chavez and
with representatives of the growers, urging both to reopen
negotiations. He has been a supporter of the farm workers union in its
campaign to gain recognition, and has recently asked for stronger
governmental controls against overuse of pesticides, another issue the
farm workers have been protesting.
On housing, Tunney noted that there are currently only about
500,000 housing starts annually, compared to the two million he says
are needed.
He pointed out that it will be difficult to get true low cost housing
when many of the plumbers, electricians and others working on
housing make over $15,000 a year. He expressed hope that the
ultimate answer might come from industrialization.
The Congressman had nothing but criticism for the functioning of
Operation Intercept, although he said that he agreed with the aim of
cutting off the international drug flow.

that does not have the support of its people."
In a brief news conference following the service, he said the 60,000
troops that have been withdrawn were "not enough, a token move,"
and all troops should be pulled out as soon as their safety can be
guaranteed.
In response to the call for a 60-day moratorium on war criticism,
McGovern responded "what we need is not a moratorium on free and
honest dissent, but a moratorium on killing in Southeast Asia."
He also urged support of the October 15 protest, saying the act of
students going into the community to discuss the war is "the highest
patriotic act in which any American can engage."
He added "to challenge the mistaken policy of the country is doing
it a great honor," and noted it is "still the truth that can make us
free."
Tunney at Seminar
Congressman John V. Tunney (D. Riverside), probable candidate
for the Democratic nomination to run against Senator George Murphy
next year, participated in the Mexican-American Seminar on campus
Friday.
Tunney said that he has been in contact with Cesar Chavez and
with representatives of the growers, urging both to reopen
negotiations. He has been a supporter of the farm workers union in its
campaign to gain recognition, and has recently asked for stronger
governmental controls against overuse of pesticides, another issue the
farm workers have been protesting.
On housing, Tunney noted that there are currently only about
500,000 housing starts annually, compared to the two million he says
are needed.
He pointed out that it will be difficult to get true low cost housing
when many of the plumbers, electricians and others working on
housing make over $15,000 a year. He expressed hope that the
ultimate answer might come from industrialization.
The Congressman had nothing but criticism for the functioning of
Operation Intercept, although he said that he agreed with the aim of
cutting off the international drug flow.
Reacting to what Charles Dickens called the paradox between "the
worst of times and the best of times," South Dakota Senator George
McGovern addressed an overflow crowd at Memorial Church Sunday.
Delivering the lay sermon, McGovern said he was encouraged by
this paradox because although the world is beset with problems, there
is now "enough ferment and change that one is aware of the world's
troubles."
He said there is "no other time in America that so many people are
thinking about improving life."
The Democrat posed the question "Is there no grounds for hope
that we realize that we are in trouble?" and added that the advantage
(and paradox) of being lost is that you look for a new road to et out.
Lesson of War
McGovern, a 1968 Presidential candidate, dwelled heavily on the
Vietnam war, commenting that it also applies to Dickens' paradox.
He said the American people can see the misery of the war, but are
looking beyond it toward the lessons it has to give.
McGovern noted that President Nixon says he is not concerned how
the US got into Vietnam, but how it can get out. He said concerned
men must learn how the US became involved in order to prevent it
from occuring again.
He said the most important lesson-the United States can learn from
Vietnam is "we do not have the right or capacity to save a government
that does not have the support of its people."
In a brief news conference following the service, he said the 60,000
troops that have been withdrawn were "not enough, a token move,"
