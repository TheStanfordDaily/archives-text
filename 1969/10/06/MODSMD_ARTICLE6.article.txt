# Committee Still At Work
## Student Housing: No Easy Answer 
### GREG WHITE (Second of Two Parts) 
Six thousand students have
been forced to seek off-campus
housing this fall. Hardest hit by
the housing squeeze are graduate
students and transfers. So far the
University has been able to
provide on-campus housing for
only some 1300 grad students and
150 transfers out of a total of
5000.
The undergraduate, on-campus
housing is a brighter story.
Undergraduate enrollment this
quarter is 6152, of which 3,500
can be housed in university
residences. The twenty-three
fraternities, after a good rush last
spring, had enough room to take
on 70 boarders. The nine different
Row houses have as nearly a full
population as last year.
Some of the dorms actually
show a decrease in resident
number. Roble Hall, which was
acutely overcrowded, this year has

thirty fewer students. This allows
for doubles to actually be doubles
and triples to shelter just three
people. Freshmen, however, still
must pack in tight. Lagunita
reports much he same situation,
with about twenty-five fewer
students.
Toyon, Wilbur, and Stern Halls,
along with Escondido Village, all
have no change in the number
they house.
Manzanita Park Fails
It was hoped that Manzanita
Park (the new trailer complex)
would ease some of the pressure
by accomodating 164 students.
However, these are mostly
returning undergraduates who
were in dorms last year. This
doesn't help the graduates or
transfers very much, as they are
rarely assigned on-campus
housing.
Manzanita has had its troubles
too. Many trailers report shoddy
workmanship, broken windows,
unflushable toilets, and cabinets
that refuse to open. The trailers
were erected rapidly on a tight
budget, so much of this was to be
expected. Another problem is the
sameness of all the trailers and
effect on student spirit. Dean
Leland recently met with
Manzanita's director and others to
discuss these problems.
Despire Manzanita Park and the
relaxed situation on-campus, the
off-campus situation is difficult.

In fact, many homeless students
have complained that apartment
owners have raised their prices
over last year in order to take
advantage of the situation.
A random check of a few
apartments in the Palo Alto area
revealed that some have raised
prices beyond a level attributable
to the rise in the cost of living.
Single room studios in the
$100-$l5O per month range are
common, and most two bedroom
apartments start at a minimum of
$200 a month, usually split
among two or three people.
University Position
A student has little recourse if
he is without shelter and cannot
easily meet the cost of available
housing. According to Williams,
the "University does not have an
institutional stance" on the
question of the relationship
among students, apartment
owners, and the University.
In the past, it has been regarded
as a private affair between owner
and student. Williams can recall
no incident "in which the
University applied pressure to
off-campus apartments" to lowor
their rents.
The reverse is also true.
Williams' office has received
requests from apartment owners
to assist them in forcing payment
from a student delinquent in his
rent. No such action has been
taken.

There is likewise no
organization outside the
University which can bring
effective pressure on apartments
to lower rents. The Palo Alto
Better Business Bureau shuns such
action, and groups such as the
Apartment Manager's Institute,
located in San Jose, do not seem
particularly interested in the
student's problem.
No Alternatives
Right now, there appears to be
no avenue by which the student
can apply pressure for reduced
rents. Williams is not quite sure if
his office is the vehicle for such
protest pressure, but he wants to
hear student opinion on the
University's role in rent
determination. (His office is on
the third floor of the Old Union).
Looking towards next year, the
alternatives are not clear. This is
partially because it h;is only been
recently that the housing shortage
has existed at all.
Five years ago university
residences had many vacancies
and apartments competed to get
student tenants. This year is only
the second that large numbers of
students have had trouble with
housing. Thus, machinery to help
them has not been perfected.
Williams notes that most
University solutions in the past
have called for building more
on-campus housing. There is
currently a Committee on the

New Undergraduate Dorm
completing plans for such a
building.
New Apartments
Also, behind the trailers, an
extension of Escondido Village is
under construction. It will consist
of two 11 -story high rises, each
with 110 apartments (to be
completed in 1971) and nine low
rises with a total of 54 apartments
(to be completed in 1970).
Of these 274 units, about half
are being built with a $2 million
federal loan. This loan stipulates
that these apartments be made
available to single students.
According to Ed Scoles,
assistant business manager for
University housing, Stanford has
not made up its mind whom to
rent the remaining units to.
Several groups are pressuring for
them, and the decision may
eventually rest with President
Pitzer.
But the University cannot build
enough housing for all 6,000 who
now live off campus, even if that
solution were wanted by the
students, which it is not. Williams
speculates that the University may
have to engage in rent subsidy,
look into acquiring apartment
complexes itself, or limit the
spaces on-campus only to those
students who can't afford to live
off-campus.

question of the relationship
among students, apartment
owners, and the University.
In the past, it has been regarded
as a private affair between owner
and student. Williams can recall
no incident "in which the
University applied pressure to
off-campus apartments" to lowor
their rents.
The reverse is also true.
Williams' office has received
requests from apartment owners
to assist them in forcing payment
from a student delinquent in his
rent. No such action has been
taken.

There is likewise no
organization outside the
University which can bring
effective pressure on apartments
to lower rents. The Palo Alto
Better Business Bureau shuns such
action, and groups such as the
Apartment Manager's Institute,
located in San Jose, do not seem
particularly interested in the
student's problem.
No Alternatives
Right now, there appears to be
no avenue by which the student
can apply pressure for reduced
rents. Williams is not quite sure if
his office is the vehicle for such
protest pressure, but he wants to
hear student opinion on the
University's role in rent
determination. (His office is on
the third floor of the Old Union).
Looking towards next year, the
alternatives are not clear. This is
partially because it h;is only been
recently that the housing shortage
has existed at all.
Five years ago university
residences had many vacancies
and apartments competed to get
student tenants. This year is only
the second that large numbers of
students have had trouble with
housing. Thus, machinery to help
them has not been perfected.
Williams notes that most
University solutions in the past
have called for building more
on-campus housing. There is
currently a Committee on the

New Undergraduate Dorm
completing plans for such a
building.
New Apartments
Also, behind the trailers, an
extension of Escondido Village is
under construction. It will consist
of two 11 -story high rises, each
with 110 apartments (to be
completed in 1971) and nine low
rises with a total of 54 apartments
(to be completed in 1970).
Of these 274 units, about half
are being built with a $2 million
federal loan. This loan stipulates
that these apartments be made
available to single students.
According to Ed Scoles,
assistant business manager for
University housing, Stanford has
not made up its mind whom to
rent the remaining units to.
Several groups are pressuring for
them, and the decision may
eventually rest with President
Pitzer.
But the University cannot build
enough housing for all 6,000 who
now live off campus, even if that
solution were wanted by the
students, which it is not. Williams
speculates that the University may
have to engage in rent subsidy,
look into acquiring apartment
complexes itself, or limit the
spaces on-campus only to those
students who can't afford to live
off-campus.
Six thousand students have
been forced to seek off-campus
housing this fall. Hardest hit by
the housing squeeze are graduate
students and transfers. So far the
University has been able to
provide on-campus housing for
only some 1300 grad students and
150 transfers out of a total of
5000.
The undergraduate, on-campus
housing is a brighter story.
Undergraduate enrollment this
quarter is 6152, of which 3,500
can be housed in university
residences. The twenty-three
fraternities, after a good rush last
spring, had enough room to take
on 70 boarders. The nine different
Row houses have as nearly a full
population as last year.
Some of the dorms actually
show a decrease in resident
number. Roble Hall, which was
acutely overcrowded, this year has

thirty fewer students. This allows
for doubles to actually be doubles
and triples to shelter just three
people. Freshmen, however, still
must pack in tight. Lagunita
reports much he same situation,
with about twenty-five fewer
students.
Toyon, Wilbur, and Stern Halls,
along with Escondido Village, all
have no change in the number
they house.
Manzanita Park Fails
It was hoped that Manzanita
Park (the new trailer complex)
would ease some of the pressure
by accomodating 164 students.
However, these are mostly
returning undergraduates who
were in dorms last year. This
doesn't help the graduates or
transfers very much, as they are
rarely assigned on-campus
housing.
Manzanita has had its troubles
too. Many trailers report shoddy
workmanship, broken windows,
unflushable toilets, and cabinets
that refuse to open. The trailers
were erected rapidly on a tight
budget, so much of this was to be
expected. Another problem is the
sameness of all the trailers and
effect on student spirit. Dean
Leland recently met with
Manzanita's director and others to
discuss these problems.
Despire Manzanita Park and the
relaxed situation on-campus, the
off-campus situation is difficult.

In fact, many homeless students
have complained that apartment
owners have raised their prices
over last year in order to take
advantage of the situation.
A random check of a few
apartments in the Palo Alto area
revealed that some have raised
prices beyond a level attributable
to the rise in the cost of living.
Single room studios in the
$100-$l5O per month range are
common, and most two bedroom
apartments start at a minimum of
$200 a month, usually split
among two or three people.

off-campus.
Six thousand students have
been forced to seek off-campus
housing this fall. Hardest hit by
the housing squeeze are graduate
students and transfers. So far the
University has been able to
provide on-campus housing for
only some 1300 grad students and
150 transfers out of a total of
5000.
The undergraduate, on-campus
housing is a brighter story.
Undergraduate enrollment this
quarter is 6152, of which 3,500
can be housed in university
residences. The twenty-three
fraternities, after a good rush last
spring, had enough room to take
on 70 boarders. The nine different
Row houses have as nearly a full
population as last year.
Some of the dorms actually
show a decrease in resident
number. Roble Hall, which was
acutely overcrowded, this year has

thirty fewer students. This allows
for doubles to actually be doubles
and triples to shelter just three
people. Freshmen, however, still
must pack in tight. Lagunita
reports much he same situation,
with about twenty-five fewer
students.
Toyon, Wilbur, and Stern Halls,
along with Escondido Village, all
have no change in the number
they house.
Manzanita Park Fails
It was hoped that Manzanita
Park (the new trailer complex)
would ease some of the pressure
by accomodating 164 students.
However, these are mostly
returning undergraduates who
were in dorms last year. This
doesn't help the graduates or
transfers very much, as they are
rarely assigned on-campus
housing.
Manzanita has had its troubles
too. Many trailers report shoddy
workmanship, broken windows,
unflushable toilets, and cabinets
that refuse to open. The trailers
were erected rapidly on a tight
budget, so much of this was to be
expected. Another problem is the
sameness of all the trailers and
effect on student spirit. Dean
Leland recently met with
Manzanita's director and others to
discuss these problems.
Despire Manzanita Park and the
relaxed situation on-campus, the
off-campus situation is difficult.

In fact, many homeless students
have complained that apartment
owners have raised their prices
over last year in order to take
advantage of the situation.
A random check of a few
apartments in the Palo Alto area
revealed that some have raised
prices beyond a level attributable
to the rise in the cost of living.
Single room studios in the
$100-$l5O per month range are
common, and most two bedroom
apartments start at a minimum of
$200 a month, usually split
among two or three people.
University Position
A student has little recourse if
he is without shelter and cannot
easily meet the cost of available
housing. According to Williams,
the "University does not have an
institutional stance" on the
question of the relationship
among students, apartment
owners, and the University.
In the past, it has been regarded
as a private affair between owner
and student. Williams can recall
no incident "in which the
University applied pressure to
off-campus apartments" to lowor
their rents.
The reverse is also true.
Williams' office has received
requests from apartment owners
to assist them in forcing payment
from a student delinquent in his
rent. No such action has been
taken.

There is likewise no
organization outside the
University which can bring
effective pressure on apartments
to lower rents. The Palo Alto
Better Business Bureau shuns such
action, and groups such as the
Apartment Manager's Institute,
located in San Jose, do not seem
particularly interested in the
student's problem.
No Alternatives
Right now, there appears to be
no avenue by which the student
can apply pressure for reduced
rents. Williams is not quite sure if
his office is the vehicle for such
protest pressure, but he wants to
hear student opinion on the
University's role in rent
determination. (His office is on
the third floor of the Old Union).
Looking towards next year, the
alternatives are not clear. This is
partially because it h;is only been
recently that the housing shortage
has existed at all.
Five years ago university
residences had many vacancies
and apartments competed to get
student tenants. This year is only
the second that large numbers of
students have had trouble with
housing. Thus, machinery to help
them has not been perfected.
Williams notes that most
University solutions in the past
have called for building more
on-campus housing. There is
currently a Committee on the

New Undergraduate Dorm
completing plans for such a
building.
New Apartments
Also, behind the trailers, an
extension of Escondido Village is
under construction. It will consist
of two 11 -story high rises, each
with 110 apartments (to be
completed in 1971) and nine low
rises with a total of 54 apartments
(to be completed in 1970).
Of these 274 units, about half
are being built with a $2 million
federal loan. This loan stipulates
that these apartments be made
available to single students.
According to Ed Scoles,
assistant business manager for
University housing, Stanford has
not made up its mind whom to
rent the remaining units to.
Several groups are pressuring for
them, and the decision may
eventually rest with President
Pitzer.
But the University cannot build
enough housing for all 6,000 who
now live off campus, even if that
solution were wanted by the
students, which it is not. Williams
speculates that the University may
have to engage in rent subsidy,
look into acquiring apartment
complexes itself, or limit the
spaces on-campus only to those
students who can't afford to live
off-campus.
