# Sisters:
## You're Sexually Oppressed 
### 
(This column was submitted by
the sisters of the Women's Libera
tion movement.)
"Why do we value the friend
ship and respect of men more
than the friendship and respect of
women?
Why do some of us think the
way to be liberated is to act like a
man?
Why should it be unusual for
women to cooperate with and
support each other?
Why are we pitted against each
other for the attention of men?
Why do we feel that we have no
prestige or self-worth if we don't
have a husband or boyfriend?
Why do we look to men instead
of to ourselves and other women
for our definition and direction?
Why is any deviation from the
media-produced image of women
considered a deformity?
Why do we look at ourselves in
every mirrow and window we
pass?
Why do we think that sexual
freedom makes us liberated?

Given this sexual freedom, why is
his orgasn still more important
than yours?
Why don't we have control over
our own bodies?
Why in 1969 will more than
one million illegal abortions be
performed in the United States
from which countless thousands
of women will die?
Abortions
Why do women get paid less for
doing the same work as men?
Why do the majority of women
who work have full, menial jobs?
Why do we still believe that
women are somehow different
from men in ability, intelligence,
talent, and seriousness of pur
pose? If there are differences, why
hasn't anyone begun to ask
"why" in the same tone that they
have begun to question ethnic and
racial stereotypes?
These are some of the questions
around which an independent
movement for the liberation of
women has grown. In the past two

years throughout the country we
have been coming together and
discovering our common oppres
sion, learning that the problems
we experienced as 'individual' are
common to all women.
Sisterhood
In discovering one another we
began to realize a sisterhood, to
find a new sense of dignity and
strength, a new respect for our
selves and our sisters. We have
come to understand that our
oppression is built into our
sexually defined social role. We
refuse any longer to define our
selves in terms of these prefabrica
ted roles."
Although written by San Fran
cisco women, the above statement
represents the concerns of all
women. If you are interested in
joining together (women em
ployees, students, housewives) to
discuss these questions, come to
Tresidder Union, room 270

"Why do we value the friend
ship and respect of men more
than the friendship and respect of
women?
Why do some of us think the
way to be liberated is to act like a
man?
Why should it be unusual for
women to cooperate with and
support each other?
Why are we pitted against each
other for the attention of men?
Why do we feel that we have no
prestige or self-worth if we don't
have a husband or boyfriend?
Why do we look to men instead
of to ourselves and other women
for our definition and direction?
Why is any deviation from the
media-produced image of women
considered a deformity?
Why do we look at ourselves in
every mirrow and window we
pass?
Why do we think that sexual
freedom makes us liberated?

Given this sexual freedom, why is
his orgasn still more important
than yours?
Why don't we have control over
our own bodies?
Why in 1969 will more than
one million illegal abortions be
performed in the United States
from which countless thousands
of women will die?
Abortions
Why do women get paid less for
doing the same work as men?
Why do the majority of women
who work have full, menial jobs?
Why do we still believe that
women are somehow different
from men in ability, intelligence,
talent, and seriousness of pur
pose? If there are differences, why
hasn't anyone begun to ask
"why" in the same tone that they
have begun to question ethnic and
racial stereotypes?
These are some of the questions
around which an independent
movement for the liberation of
women has grown. In the past two

years throughout the country we
have been coming together and
discovering our common oppres
sion, learning that the problems
we experienced as 'individual' are
common to all women.
Sisterhood
In discovering one another we
began to realize a sisterhood, to
find a new sense of dignity and
strength, a new respect for our
selves and our sisters. We have
come to understand that our
oppression is built into our
sexually defined social role. We
refuse any longer to define our
selves in terms of these prefabrica
ted roles."
Although written by San Fran
cisco women, the above statement
represents the concerns of all
women. If you are interested in
joining together (women em
ployees, students, housewives) to
discuss these questions, come to
