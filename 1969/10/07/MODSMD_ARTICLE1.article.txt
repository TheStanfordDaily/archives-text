# Davis Holds Class Despite 'No Credit'
## 
### ED KOHN 
Angela Davis, who has been
banned from teaching at UCLA
for credit on the grounds that she
is a Communist, held her first
class yesterday before a
standing-room-only crowd of
1 900 applauding students.
At the end of her hour-long
lecture on "Recurring
Philosophical Themes in Black
Literature," the students gave her
a standing ovation and demanded
credit for the course.
Miss Davis, who is the center of
a raging controversy between
Univ. of California regents and
faculty, spoke to her class and
answered questions. She quoted
Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre and
Herbert Marcuse and gave her own
opinions on freedom and social
measures. She said nothing in
overt support of Communism.
169 students registered for the
course, according to the
Associated Press. The site of the
class was moved from a room
seating 300 to 1900-seat Royce
Hall on the Los Angeles campus.
No I For Credit
The regents invoked a 1940
ruling banning Communist
teachers and fired Miss Davis last
month after she said she belonged
to the Communist Party. UCLA's
Academic Senate demanded that
she be permitted to teach and that
the course be given for credit. In
an emergency meeting last Friday,
the regents said that she could
teach her course, Philosophy 99,
but not for credit, until the
matter is settled.
UCLA Chancellor Charles
Young said during the day that
Miss Davis should be allowed to
remain on the payroll pending her
appeal. It was learned last night,
however, that Young told Miss
Davis he sent a letter to the
Registrar informing him that her
course would not be offered for
credit.
Prof. David Kaplan, vice
chairman of the Philosophy
Department, said, "there certainly
will be a resolution introduced in
the Academic Senate meeting

calling on all faculty members to
associate themselves with Miss
Davis. They will be asked to not
record student grades at the end
of the quarter."
Kaplan continued, "If the
Senate agrees, a letter will be sent
to the Registrar instructing him to
give credit for the course. This
means he will have two letters,
one from the Senate saying yes
for credit, one from the regents
saying no credit."
Unanimous Agreement
At one point during her class
Miss Davis said, "I don't think
that we should allow the regents
to interfere with the intellectual
process . . .you students ought to
decide. Anyone who objects, I'd
like you to stand up now."
No no stood up. "I interpret
your silence as tacit agreement,"
she said.
The theme of her lecture was
freedom. She spoke of the life and
times of slaves Frederick Douglas
and Nat Turner, saying slavery
destroyed the Negroes' sense of
self-identity.
"The most extreme form of
human alienation was the
reduction of man to the state of
property," she said. "The history
of black literature provides a
much more illuminating look at
the concept of freedom than
philosophical discourse in western
society. The pivotal theme of this
course will be freedom as it has
unfolded in the literary enterprise
of the black people."
Resolution Adopted
At the conclusion of her class,
her students, led by a member of
the Black Students' Union,
overwhelmingly adopted a
resolution demanding that Senate
meetings be open to all students,
that students taking Philosophy
99 receive full academic credit,
and that the UCLA faculty refuse
to teach until course credit is
approved.
Earlier in the day, 20 black
professors threatened to withhold
grades from their students. A
firebombing incident was also
reported, causing $2500 damage.

At one point during her class
Miss Davis said, "I don't think
that we should allow the regents
to interfere with the intellectual
process . . .you students ought to
decide. Anyone who objects, I'd
like you to stand up now."
No no stood up. "I interpret
your silence as tacit agreement,"
she said.
The theme of her lecture was
freedom. She spoke of the life and
times of slaves Frederick Douglas
and Nat Turner, saying slavery
destroyed the Negroes' sense of
self-identity.
"The most extreme form of
human alienation was the
reduction of man to the state of
property," she said. "The history
of black literature provides a
much more illuminating look at
the concept of freedom than
philosophical discourse in western
society. The pivotal theme of this
course will be freedom as it has
unfolded in the literary enterprise
of the black people."
Resolution Adopted
At the conclusion of her class,
her students, led by a member of
the Black Students' Union,
overwhelmingly adopted a
resolution demanding that Senate
meetings be open to all students,
that students taking Philosophy
99 receive full academic credit,
and that the UCLA faculty refuse
to teach until course credit is
approved.
Earlier in the day, 20 black
professors threatened to withhold
grades from their students. A
firebombing incident was also
reported, causing $2500 damage.
Angela Davis, who has been
banned from teaching at UCLA
for credit on the grounds that she
is a Communist, held her first
class yesterday before a
standing-room-only crowd of
1 900 applauding students.
At the end of her hour-long
lecture on "Recurring
Philosophical Themes in Black
Literature," the students gave her
a standing ovation and demanded
credit for the course.
Miss Davis, who is the center of
a raging controversy between
Univ. of California regents and
faculty, spoke to her class and
answered questions. She quoted
Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre and
Herbert Marcuse and gave her own
opinions on freedom and social
measures. She said nothing in
overt support of Communism.
169 students registered for the
course, according to the
Associated Press. The site of the
class was moved from a room
seating 300 to 1900-seat Royce
Hall on the Los Angeles campus.
No I For Credit
The regents invoked a 1940
ruling banning Communist
teachers and fired Miss Davis last
month after she said she belonged
to the Communist Party. UCLA's
Academic Senate demanded that
she be permitted to teach and that
the course be given for credit. In
an emergency meeting last Friday,
the regents said that she could
teach her course, Philosophy 99,
but not for credit, until the
matter is settled.
UCLA Chancellor Charles
Young said during the day that
Miss Davis should be allowed to
remain on the payroll pending her
appeal. It was learned last night,
however, that Young told Miss
Davis he sent a letter to the
Registrar informing him that her
course would not be offered for
credit.
Prof. David Kaplan, vice
chairman of the Philosophy
Department, said, "there certainly
will be a resolution introduced in
the Academic Senate meeting

calling on all faculty members to
associate themselves with Miss
Davis. They will be asked to not
record student grades at the end
of the quarter."
Kaplan continued, "If the
Senate agrees, a letter will be sent
to the Registrar instructing him to
give credit for the course. This
means he will have two letters,
one from the Senate saying yes
for credit, one from the regents
saying no credit."
