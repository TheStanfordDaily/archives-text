### Jane Franklin 
(This article was submitted by
Jane Franklin, one of the sisters
of the Women's Liberation
movement. They will be holding a
meeting tonight at 7:30, room
270 Tresidder, to meet with
anyone interested in working with
the Women's Liberation
movement.)
"Flashlight in hand, wearing
high heels and a sedate but stylish
black dress, Amelia J. Gordon
stepped briskly into the dingy
dimness of a bar. Just behind her
were two unsmiling young men
with carbines. Another half dozen
paces back were two more
Filipinos with rapid-firing
grease-guns. A pair of U.S.
military policemen moved in with
them. Four other armed guards
leaped from a Jeep and posted
themselves around the bar's
entrance."
With ten armed guards, the
mayor of "sin city" entered one
of the 300 night spots in "an acre
of frenzy" next to the U.S. Naval
Base at Subic Bay in the
Philippines. She had come to
measure the skirts of the
"hostesses." "We don't allow
extremely short miniskirts here,"
Mrs. Gordon explained. "It is
obscene the way some girls dress.
We must not forget our traditional
Filipino modesty." (S.F.
Kxaminer & Chronicle, Aug. 17,
1969.)
Able to get a "man-sized" job?
Yes. Paid more rather than less
than most men? Yes. Looked
.ipon as an equal by most men?
No; feared by most men around
ler because she has the power to
throw them in jail—or worse.
Liberated? No; oppressed by her
own narrow view of humanity,
she has equality in oppression
with Madame Nhu, Madame
Chiang Kai-shek, Pat Nixon,
Happy Rockefeller, and other
sisters of Marie Antoinette.
Economic Victims
The prostitutes in Saigon, the
Philippines, and San Francisco are
not primarily the victims of male
stipremacy; they are primarily the
victims of an economic system
that doesn't offer them other
ways to live. A couple of weeks
ago I spent a few hours in a jail

cell with two prostitutes whose
unemployed husbands were at
home looking after their children
and with no money coming in
since the bread-winners were
"safely" behind bars. Those
women love their children as I
love mine, and neither my
husband nor theirs—male
supremacist as they may be —is the
cause of that threatening
starvation. But a large number of
the men and women who do
perpetuate starvation—lnterna
tional Imperialist Industrialists
were banqueting that evening at
the Fairmont.
' My mind spun around with the
desire for women's
liberation —liberating those

women from behind those bars.
But when I was leaving, all 1 said
was, "I hate to leave you here,"
while they said, "It's all right,
Baby." It isn't allright, Baby, and
it won't be allright until our
whole thing is right.
Join People's Revoll
Although we have just begun
the struggle, more and more
women are realizing that the only
way we are going to be liberated is
by changing the profit motive
system to the human motive
system. We will organize working
women, unemployed women,
welfare women, housewives,
women students to rise up angry
alongside our oppressed brothers,
linking our liberation struggle to

that of all the people.
A Vietnamese woman, arrested
during a secret mission, refused to
answer her torturers. "Who are
your comrades? Who is your
husband? Where are your
children?" they asked. They killed
her for her silence, but on the
prison wall they must have seen
her answer:
A rosy-cheeked woman, here I
am t'igh ting side by side with
you, men.
On my shoulders weighs lliat
hatred which is common to us.
The prison is my school, its
mates my friends,
The sword is my child, the gun
my husband.
