## McGovern 'Maddening' Marshall Kilduff 
### 
I went to hear Senator
McGovern last Sunday. I went to
hear what a thoughtful
presidential candidate had to say.
I didn't go to hear new timetables
for troop withdrawals, ideas on
how to rebuild cities, or some
student demands are actually
pretty reasonable you know.
What I got was a dull
maddening speech, full of
unbelievable superficiality and
simple silliness.
He began with little attempts to
win us over in a grating
monotone. He was at "the
turbulent Chicago Convention,"
but what does he have to say
about it? "I'm on a committee to
draw up new convention
procedures." Gee, that's keen.
That insane rigged show was
just a model of a lot else. Will
shorter speeches and less confetti
do anything to change all the
Daley's in this country? Or maybe
next time Julian Bond's group
from Georgia will get
three-fourths of the delegates and
Lester's axe handles the rest. Red
is the color of my true love's
neck.
Questions Unanswered
I don't want a radical analysis
of American politics from a
Senator. I want to hear what he
looks forward to. He knows that
there is only a handful in
government like himself and that
Mem Chu was full of people
wanting to hear that the
McCarthy-Kennedy campaign is
still going on. But McGovern had
nothing to say.
Next he talked about his food
bill, up for approval in the House.
Obviously it's an honest attempt
to alleviate suffering as soon as
possible, and little can be said
against it. But he knows this bill
isn't going to change America.
Why doesn't he tell us what will?
I guess I wanted to hear his
hopes and thoughts about the
future. There are a lot of people
like me who are beyond being
liberal but still short of radical. So

it's probably fair to say that even
if he were more articulate and
thoughtful, I wouldn't have
accepted most of what he said.
But Christ, give me a chance to
hear it. He understands much
more deeply what Washington
feels and thinks than I could ever
learn from newspapers and
Severeid. Tell ne, Senator, I want
to know where we're all going.
Why (he System?
Don't give me the ten minute
summary of the war: "support of
the French colonial effort to
restore their colonial control,"
"time-honored commitment of
self-determinism," "walked out
on the Geneva Conference." Most
of us have a rough idea of the
historyâ€”tell us why you're still a
Senator in the face of it all.
I want to be convinced; I didn't
go to the speech hoping to be
turned off. I want to believe that I
won't have to be busted just to

feel good about going to class at
Stanford.
"If there is one dominant
lesson from with bitter experience
that we ought never to forget it is
this: wo do not have the right or
the capacity to save a political
regime abroad that lacks the
respect of its own people." Don't
give me that. If we're a little nicer,
there'll be no problems? Don't
you think Vietnam has shown us a
little more than that about the
nation? What do you think?
At the beginning of the speech,
McGovern quoted Dickens'
famous section in Tale of Two
Cities, "It was the best of times, it
was the worst of times..." He
read most of the piece, but he left
out the line "It was the epoch of
belief, it was the epoch of
incredulity."
