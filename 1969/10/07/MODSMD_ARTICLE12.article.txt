## Massive Withdrawal 
### Greg White 
Washingtonâ€”(APl) Informed
sources indicate that President
Richard Nixon, in an address to
the American people tonight, will
announce massive withdrawals.
Rather unexpectedly, though,
the withdrawals are not from Viet
Nam. Instead, Nixon will call for
the removal of 93 million
Americans from the continental
United States.
The plan, devised at San
Clemente last month, is being
hailed by administration
supporters as a masterful strike
that could end many of the
nation's problems. HEW Secretary
Robert Finch, who reportedly
opposed the plan at first, calls it
"a Presidential decision I will

support to my fullest. After all,
you can't win em' all."
Vice-President Spiro Agnew
remarked that "It is amazing no
one thought of this before."
The tentative withdrawal date
is June 15, 1972, shortly before
the presidential elections. Almost
all withdrawn citizens will be
placed in special "liberation
cities" in countries that have close
ties with the U.S. Being
mentioned are Spain, Haiti, Brazil,
Greece, Australia, South Africa,
and South Viet Nam itself.
Legal INiccties
Attorney General Mitchell, in
charge of ironing out the legal
niceties of the move, has promised
to move ahead with "all deliberate
speed" to implement the
President's decision.
In a released text of his speech,
Nixon cites several reasons that
prompted him into announcing
such an action. Military necessity
figured in heavily. It is felt that
the location of people around
defense establishments acts as a
lure to Russian and Chinese
missiles. Also, vital shipments of
ammunition and CBW agents have
been hampered by concentrations
of civilians along major railways.
Another factor is inflation. It is
hoped that by removing a large
segment of the population
(including most of the poor and
unemployable) there will be less
strain on the dollar to "be
stretched thin to cover dubious
programs." Thus the dollar will
retain its essential role as leader
among world currency.
"Dangerous" Liberals
Preliminary figures show that
40 million blacks and poor whites,
35 million elderly, 15 million
hippies and students, and some 12
"dangerous" liberals are among
those leaving.
The move caught many
politicians off-guard. Hubert
Humphry condemned the plan as
a "betrayal of an American's
fundamental right to live where he
wishes." Senator Gaylord Nelson
of Wisconsin called the action a
"cheap attempt to end anti-war
pressure" and urged that
Americans search their
consciences and participate with
him in the Viet Nam Moratorium
October 15.
There are many within the
administration who counseled
against such a move, mainly on
the grounds that the President
might be acused of playing
politics. However, Nixon seems to
have accepted this risk. Echoing
his innaugural speech, Nixon
pledges to become "President of
all the people, at least all that's
left."
