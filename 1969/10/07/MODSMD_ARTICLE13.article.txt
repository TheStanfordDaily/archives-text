# Would You Believe...
## Succeed Syndrome 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON—I know no
one will believe me, but you're
just going to have to take my
word for it. I met a college
student the other day who said
thai, rII he wanted out of life was
success and financial security.
He asked me not to use his
name because he didn't want to
embarrass his parents, so I shall
call him Hiram.
"Hiram," I asked him, "why
did you decide to take this
revolutionary attitude toward
society?"
"I don't know exactly when it
happened. I was like most of the
rest of the students. I wanted to
tear down the school, the society,
the Establishment. I was just
another conformist, and I never
questioned why I was doing all
the things that were expected of
me.
Hit Over Head
"Then one day 1 thought to
myself, 'There's got to be more to
life than getting hit over the head
by the cops.' I looked around me
and saw nothing but sheep. Every
student was doing his thing
because someone else had done
his thing, and no one was doing or
saying anything new."
"So you decided to drop out of
the student movement and
become a millionaire?"
"Not at first. Hut I met this
girl. She was really way out. She
wore a cashmere sweater, a plaid
skirt and she had on shoes and
socks—l couldn't believe anyone
would dress like that. But I got to
talking to her, and she started
making sense.
"She said it wasn't enough to
lock yourself in a building or go
on a hunger strike in your dorm.
If you really wanted to change the
world, you had to make a lot of
money, and then people wouldn't
tell you what to do."
"That's radical thinking," I
said.
"Then she gave me a book by
Prof. Horatio Alger, and 1 guess
no book I ever read lias had more
of an effect on me."
"Wasn't Prof. Alger the one
who came out first with the
success syndrome theory?"
"That's he. His story floored
me. I mean a whole new world
opened for me, and 1 knew no
matter what the consequences
were and no matter what other
people thought, I was going to
work hard and become rich and
successful. Life finally took on
some meaning for me, and for the
first time 1 felt like a free man."
"What did you do then?"
"I discovered through this girl
Mini Ihere were other students on
campus who felt the way I
did not many, but there were
enough. So we formed a group

called the 'Students for a
Successful Society.' At first we
had to go underground, because
the administration wouldn't
acknowledge us as a legitimate
campus organization. But as more
and more students heard about us,
the SSS kept growing. We've been
able to radicalize at least 200
students who would rather be rich
than do their thing."
More Supporters
"What are some of your
activities to get more supporters?"
"We sell the Wall Street Journal
on campus. We've opened a
coffeehouse where you can read
back copies of Fortune. We have a
stock market ticker tape in the
back of the room, and on
weekends we have readings from
the National Assn. of
Manufacturers Bulletins."
"Hiram, I know this all sounds
great. But is it possible that this
success syndrome movement is
just a passing fad?"
"No, it isn't. I know everyone
c.;llr, us kooks and weirdos, but no
one is going to push us around.
We've already had inquiries from
other campuses that want to set
up similar chapters, and I
wouldn't be surprised in the next
few years to see what is now a
minority movement become the
strongest force in the country.
After all, nothing succeeds like
success."

success and financial security.
He asked me not to use his
name because he didn't want to
embarrass his parents, so I shall
call him Hiram.
"Hiram," I asked him, "why
did you decide to take this
revolutionary attitude toward
society?"
"I don't know exactly when it
happened. I was like most of the
rest of the students. I wanted to
tear down the school, the society,
the Establishment. I was just
another conformist, and I never
questioned why I was doing all
the things that were expected of
me.
Hit Over Head
"Then one day 1 thought to
myself, 'There's got to be more to
life than getting hit over the head
by the cops.' I looked around me
and saw nothing but sheep. Every
student was doing his thing
because someone else had done
his thing, and no one was doing or
saying anything new."
"So you decided to drop out of
the student movement and
become a millionaire?"
"Not at first. Hut I met this
girl. She was really way out. She
wore a cashmere sweater, a plaid
skirt and she had on shoes and
socks—l couldn't believe anyone
would dress like that. But I got to
talking to her, and she started
making sense.
"She said it wasn't enough to
lock yourself in a building or go
on a hunger strike in your dorm.
If you really wanted to change the
world, you had to make a lot of
money, and then people wouldn't
tell you what to do."
"That's radical thinking," I
said.
"Then she gave me a book by
Prof. Horatio Alger, and 1 guess
no book I ever read lias had more
of an effect on me."
"Wasn't Prof. Alger the one
who came out first with the
success syndrome theory?"
"That's he. His story floored
me. I mean a whole new world
opened for me, and 1 knew no
matter what the consequences
were and no matter what other
people thought, I was going to
work hard and become rich and
successful. Life finally took on
some meaning for me, and for the
first time 1 felt like a free man."
"What did you do then?"
"I discovered through this girl
Mini Ihere were other students on
campus who felt the way I
did not many, but there were
enough. So we formed a group

called the 'Students for a
Successful Society.' At first we
had to go underground, because
the administration wouldn't
acknowledge us as a legitimate
campus organization. But as more
and more students heard about us,
the SSS kept growing. We've been
able to radicalize at least 200
students who would rather be rich
than do their thing."
More Supporters
"What are some of your
activities to get more supporters?"
"We sell the Wall Street Journal
on campus. We've opened a
coffeehouse where you can read
back copies of Fortune. We have a
stock market ticker tape in the
back of the room, and on
weekends we have readings from
the National Assn. of
Manufacturers Bulletins."
"Hiram, I know this all sounds
great. But is it possible that this
success syndrome movement is
just a passing fad?"
"No, it isn't. I know everyone
c.;llr, us kooks and weirdos, but no
one is going to push us around.
We've already had inquiries from
other campuses that want to set
up similar chapters, and I
wouldn't be surprised in the next
few years to see what is now a
minority movement become the
strongest force in the country.
After all, nothing succeeds like
success."
WASHINGTON—I know no
one will believe me, but you're
just going to have to take my
word for it. I met a college
student the other day who said
thai, rII he wanted out of life was
success and financial security.
He asked me not to use his
