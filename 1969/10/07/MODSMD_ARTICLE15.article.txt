# For What It's Worth
## Santana Highlites Bill 
### COREY GOODMAN CRAIG OKINO 
A panic hit the Stanford
campus Thursday evening as the
news of the tragic death of David
Crosby's fiance in an auto
accident meant the cancellation of
the planned Crosby, Stills, Nash,
and Young concert at Winterland.
Rumors were flying that
Hendrix and his new gypsy band
were to appear in their place, but
it was not to be. Friday night's
concert, did, however, feature the
best of the new San Francisco
bands, Santana, and their
appearance more than made up
for the loss of Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young.
At 9:00, Cold Blood, a last
minute addition to the already
existing bill of Santana, Blues

image, and John Sebastian, was
playing. Cold Blood picks good
bands to poorly imitate—Janis,
Loading Zone, Ike and Tina
Turner—but it all sounds the
same.
Blues Image, originally from
Florida and a tight percussion
based blues band with a great lead
guitarist in Mike Pinera, played a
fine set. But they are not without
flaws, namely, a tendency toward
Iron Butterfly-type vocals and an
annoying habit on Mike Pinera's
part of rapping endlessly between
songs about San Francisco and its
people.
Sebastian Out of Place
John Sebastian, who was
almost the entire spoonful of the
Lovin' Spoonful, provided
"halftime entertainment" for
Santana more than anything else.
Out of place on a bill of this
nature, Sebastian would have been
more in context on the original
bill, and we probably would have
expected him to jam with C, S, N,
& Y. But he was nice, as he played
some old Spoonful songs and
some of his newer compositions
and ended with "Darling Be Home
Soon." It was out of place, but
nice.
Then the Santana Band stalked
on stage. Carlos Santana told the

crowd before the set began that
the band didn't have much time
to practice (getting all of one
night's notice) and so they were
going to play all their old stuff,
leaving their new material for
their return engagement in
December. Then they tore into
"Waiting" from their album.
At this point, I think something
should be said about the review
Rolling Stone gave their album
(Columbia CS 9781). It seems
that the gang at the Stone office
figures everyonce in a while the
paper should pick out a popular
album and cut it to shreds, and
unfortunately Santana was the
choice this month. I say
unfortunately because the bad
review might keep people from
buying a fine album.
A paper of the Stone's quality
and influence should not allow
itself to print the ravings of a
reviewer who obviously is very
proud of the fact that he was able
to "see through" Santana and
now must enlighten the rest of us
ignorant listeners, who were
unable to.
Santana Percussions Exciting
The performance of Santana
that night rendered the review
ridiculous. Sure, half of the group
is percussion (2/3, actually, if you
count the bass), and it makes for a
very exciting brand of music
utilizing Latin American rhythms
and melodies. The great thing
about Santana is that they are
using bossa nova and jazz and
changing them to the context of
rock, and I wonder why nobody
thought of it before.
Instrumentally, no one in the
band is fantastic, but they don't
pretend to be. The three
percussionists (Jose Areas was
added in early 1969) create a
continuous flow of rhythmic
energy. Dave Brown's bass lines,
though not very complicated, give
the sound a bottom and act as
another piece of percussion.
Rolie's organ solos are nothing to
speak of, but his tone is liquid
rather than screechy, as most
other electric organs tend to be.
Carlos Santana is the spiritual
rather than the musical leader of
the group. In marked contrast to
the Blues Image guitarist, who was
always up in front of the band,
Carlos hides behind the congas
and usually plays with his back to
the audience. Yet he directs the
band much as Jerry Garcia of the
Dead does.
The band played the entire
album, excepting "Shades of
Time," ending with a very
extended "Soul Sacrifice." It was
fantastic, with everything
working, all the members of the
band cooking, but the best part
was yet to come. At the end of
the set, Carlos Santana announced
that a jam was to follow between
members of Santana and Blues
Image.
Superjam
The band then got into a jam so
tight and thought out that it
could only have been one of their
new songs. There was a short
percussion break, and then Carlos
started picking out the melody to
"Afro-Blue" (by Mongo
Santamaria, who obviously is one
of the band's influences). While
this was going on, the guitarist,
conga, and drummer from Blues
Image slowly set up their
equipment and joined in, until
finally the jam was in full swing.
Rolie's organ blared out an
improvised Latin-flavored riff,
joined by Brown's bass, and the
two guitarists soloed and then
interacted fiercely. Even though
this was a jam, Santana was still
directing the band (now
numbering nine), quieting it
down, letting it build and bringing
it to a climax. It was
overwhelming, one of the best
jams I've seen: no aimless
doodling, no competition between
members to solo, just a tight, solid
groove.
And while the audience, who
had stood throughout the last set
and had gathered around the stage
to watch the jam, was clamoring
for more, Gregg Rolie simply said
"We're tired. Go home."
