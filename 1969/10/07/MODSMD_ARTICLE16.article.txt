# A 						New Wave At The Daily
## 
### 
ll' you've looked inside your
DAILY during this past week, you
may have noticed something.
There's a new wave starting to
seep in. We need your help to keep
it going.
What kind of wave? A
not-quite-journalistic wave. A
writing wave-essays, mod writing,
maybe even poetry. A photographic
wave. A wave of design, of graphics.
A wave of your ideas.
We're not a litery magazine,
we're a feature section. We may
have no more space than one page,
twice a week. But in that space we
can give a broader, freer picture
than just the news.
Want to write? Give it a try.
Want to draw? Let us know.
Photographers are always in
demand. There will be a meeting of
all those interested in working on
the feature page tomorrow,
Wednesday, at 4:30. If you can't
make it, call the DAILY, 321-2300
x 4632, ami ask for Felicity.
Don't just get your feet wet, be
part of the wave.
