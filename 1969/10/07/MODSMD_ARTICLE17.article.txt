# The 						Fourth Virtue
## Enjoy The Flicks 
### Felicity Barringer 
Balloons burst and train whistles shrieked from the balcony as the
Sunday flicks started another year the night before last.
But it seems a little different, somehow.
Maybe it was because the large contingent of freshmen in the
audience were as yet uninitaited into the time-honored tribal ritual of
Sunday evening at Mem Aud. Maybe it was the presence of the
Ã¼biquitous small children that put a damper on the antics and
language of the audience. Or maybe everyone was too turned on to
the flick to get involved in audience participation.
If the flick had been the"The Pawnbroker," participation would
have hurt both the audience and the movie. It wasn't a
heartbreakingly lonely Rod Steiger on the screen, though, it was a sea
of holes, it was a yellow submarine, it was all together, now.
Not so long ago, sober moviegoers shunned the Sunday flicks,
despite the quality of the films. Not many people really wanted to
hear jubilant shouts as Steiger was pressing a spike through his palm.
Yet there was something about the exuberance of the audience that
was exhilarating under the right cinematic circumstances. Getting
involved as the coyote takes his 34,589,775 th fall of the precipice is a
groove. So is the virulent hatred which Flash Gordon arouses in the
hard-core balcony-sitters.
Some of the audience may have been too stoned to sing along with
All Together, Now. Some may have been too embarassed. Some may
have been too new.
OK, you've been to the first flick, you've heard the professor's
introductory lecture, in the form of a high-pitched train chugging
through the balcony. No research is needed for this course, you're free
to extemporize.
Enjoyment with other people can be really good. Enjoyment in the
tone of the flick. There aren't many other theaters in the country
where you can ad lib in the middle of a flick.
Enjoy it.
That's the tradition of the Sunday night flicks.
