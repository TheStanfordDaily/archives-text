# Quartet Together, But Too Little Soul
## 
### EDISON LIU 
There has been a vindictive
rumor going about some circles
that jazz is dead. I have never
believed this to be true, nor will I
ever. If there is any truth in the
rumor, though, part of the reason
could be the Modern Jazz
Quartet.
Don't get me wrong. If the
reader is looking for the acme in
music, the M.J.Q. is the group he
should listen to. But that's the
problem—they're too perfect. In
striving for perfection, they have
sacrificed what I feel is even more
important, soul. Not soul music,
but the deep emotion that sweeps
a jaz:t musician off his own and in
turn his audience's feet while he's
taken his solo. That's what James
Brown has, that's what the
Modern Jazz Quartet lacks.
This is unfortunate because the
MJQ is a together group. Like a
biological organism, each member
is the perfect compliment of the
other. Each knew what the other
was going to do, each was
confident of his partner's abilities
as a musician.
In a "Visitor from Venus," the
group started out with a nebulous
mumble reminiscent of the
introduction in Miles Davis' "In a
Silent Way," Here, Milt Jackson
layed down some truly mellow
runs and arppegios. Percy Heath,
the bassist and John Lewis, MJQ
pianist complimented and aided
his every move, answering him or
supplying him with ideas. "A
Visitor from Mars" following the
one from Venus, poses an
excellent contrast with its light
disonance and harsh-tonal
qualities.
One beautiful trait of the MJQ
is its control. During no tune did
the volume exceed a mezzo forte.
Unlike inexperienced musicians,
the MJQ's ceiling was on how
loud and the emphasis was on
how soft. In "Misty Roses," the
quartet tapered off to virtually
"nothing".
I was somewhat disappointed at
not hearing Percy Heath (bassist)
and Connie Kay (drummer) take
some solos, but their talent could
be heard even in their background

work. Percy Heath gave a clear
and firm bass line; Connie ivciV,
aside from his ingenious use ol
various off-beat percussion
instruments (Finger cymbals,
xylophone), kept the beat like a
metronome, control his most
praiseworthy attributes.
John Lewis, as a pianist, did
not live up to my expectations.
He economized too much on his
solos and all that came out were a
few dry notes. As a composer
however, Lewis showed not only
arranging know-how but creativity
as well. But by far the most
exciting man in the quartet was
Milt Jackson
Each of his solos was a
testimony of a musician who
combined technical ability with
creativity. His choruses were
spiced with stringing accents,
perfectly controlled phrase work,
and statements that died away to
leave a good taste in the head.
Togetherness was the prevailing
theme throughout the entire
concert and The Los Angeles
String Quarter was a together
group. The Quartet No. 3 by
Bartok was an intricate and
complicated piece and the quartet
performed it admirably.
During the third part of the
concert, the M.J.Q. and the L.A.
String Quartet joined forces and
became a "together" octet. While
the Jazz Quartet layed down the
chords and the melody, the string
quartet added on some juicy riffs
and visa versa.
One noticeable aspect of this
part of the concert was the
classical influence in the program.
Dido's Lament was a jazz
adaptation of a tune from a
Purcell opera where the strings
first presented the melody later to
be picked up by the M.J.Q.
Vendome was an attractive piece
using Bach's invention formula,
and the Aria From the Suite in D
Major by Bach, arranged by
Lewis, was the choicest selection
from the program.
Perhaps Jazz is dying, but I'll
never believe it. And if the
Modern Jazz Quartet would put a
little more feeling into its music,
then neither will the rest of the
world.

Togetherness was the prevailing
theme throughout the entire
concert and The Los Angeles
String Quarter was a together
group. The Quartet No. 3 by
Bartok was an intricate and
complicated piece and the quartet
performed it admirably.
During the third part of the
concert, the M.J.Q. and the L.A.
String Quartet joined forces and
became a "together" octet. While
the Jazz Quartet layed down the
chords and the melody, the string
quartet added on some juicy riffs
and visa versa.
One noticeable aspect of this
part of the concert was the
classical influence in the program.
Dido's Lament was a jazz
adaptation of a tune from a
Purcell opera where the strings
first presented the melody later to
be picked up by the M.J.Q.
Vendome was an attractive piece
using Bach's invention formula,
and the Aria From the Suite in D
Major by Bach, arranged by
Lewis, was the choicest selection
from the program.
Perhaps Jazz is dying, but I'll
never believe it. And if the
Modern Jazz Quartet would put a
little more feeling into its music,
then neither will the rest of the
world.
There has been a vindictive
rumor going about some circles
that jazz is dead. I have never
believed this to be true, nor will I
ever. If there is any truth in the
rumor, though, part of the reason
could be the Modern Jazz
Quartet.
Don't get me wrong. If the
reader is looking for the acme in
music, the M.J.Q. is the group he
should listen to. But that's the
problem—they're too perfect. In
striving for perfection, they have
sacrificed what I feel is even more
important, soul. Not soul music,
but the deep emotion that sweeps
a jaz:t musician off his own and in
turn his audience's feet while he's
taken his solo. That's what James
Brown has, that's what the
Modern Jazz Quartet lacks.
This is unfortunate because the
MJQ is a together group. Like a
biological organism, each member
is the perfect compliment of the
other. Each knew what the other
was going to do, each was
confident of his partner's abilities
as a musician.
In a "Visitor from Venus," the
group started out with a nebulous
mumble reminiscent of the
introduction in Miles Davis' "In a
Silent Way," Here, Milt Jackson
layed down some truly mellow
runs and arppegios. Percy Heath,
the bassist and John Lewis, MJQ
pianist complimented and aided
his every move, answering him or
supplying him with ideas. "A
Visitor from Mars" following the
one from Venus, poses an
excellent contrast with its light
disonance and harsh-tonal
qualities.
One beautiful trait of the MJQ
is its control. During no tune did
the volume exceed a mezzo forte.
Unlike inexperienced musicians,
the MJQ's ceiling was on how
loud and the emphasis was on
how soft. In "Misty Roses," the
quartet tapered off to virtually
"nothing".
I was somewhat disappointed at
not hearing Percy Heath (bassist)
and Connie Kay (drummer) take
some solos, but their talent could
be heard even in their background

work. Percy Heath gave a clear
and firm bass line; Connie ivciV,
aside from his ingenious use ol
various off-beat percussion
instruments (Finger cymbals,
xylophone), kept the beat like a
metronome, control his most
praiseworthy attributes.
John Lewis, as a pianist, did
not live up to my expectations.
He economized too much on his
solos and all that came out were a
few dry notes. As a composer
however, Lewis showed not only
arranging know-how but creativity
as well. But by far the most
exciting man in the quartet was
Milt Jackson
Each of his solos was a
testimony of a musician who
combined technical ability with
creativity. His choruses were
spiced with stringing accents,
perfectly controlled phrase work,
and statements that died away to
leave a good taste in the head.
