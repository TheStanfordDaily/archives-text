## Drugs Merit Attention 
### 
"It is time the teenager, our
greatest natural resource, should
receive the prime attention of the
government and private
philanthropy," a Stanford
physician said last night.
"The pollution of our youth by
drugs deserves as much attention
as the problems of culturally
disadvantaged minorities," Dr.
Stanford Rossiter told a class of
science teachers and school
administrators taking a new
course on the problems of drug
abuse at the Medical Center.
Breaking teenage drug abusers
into two groups, regular and
occasional users, Dr. Rossiter, a
clinical assistant professor of
radiology, noted that the regular
users are a more complex or
disturbed group of youngsters.
"The losers, criminals and
psychotics are very expensive to
our society and drug abuse tends
to enhance their socially
undesirable qualities," the speaker
pointed out. "Efforts to curtail
their drug habits justify the full
application of law enforcement
against both users and sellers.
Adolescent Problem
"The relatively large numbers
of occasional users are an entirely
different problem," Dr. Rossiter
told the audience of 100
attending the lecture.
"These users are basically
normal adolescents who use drugs
for a variety of reasons, most of
which involve a social experience
of 'being where the action is' or
being 'in.' Experimentation or
satisfaction of natural curiosity
motivates many of these
teenagers.
"The principal harm in drug use
by this group is not necessarily in
the drug itself but in the constant

perpetration of the illegal act of
using the drug. This activity
appears to deaden the social
conscience, making other types of
illegal conduct more readily
conceivable," Dr. Rossiter
stressed.
Criminal Offense
"The social organizations
centering around drug abuse tend
not to have the more customary
social experiences of normal
adolescent cultures. The attitudes
toward police and other types of
civil authority become hostile and
the dangers of felony convictions
may be taken lightly," he said.
"The full realization of damage
to future opportunities and status
resulting from criminal records
has not been awakened in these
youngsters," he continued.
A second problem with
occasional drug use is the harm to
performance in school, the
speaker pointed out. "Grades
drop, social contacts tend to
wither and participation in school
extracurricular programs is
replaced by the subculture of drug
abuse. A polarization develops
that separates the users from
others whom they may admire or
respect initially, but whom they
later come to envy, resent, or
suspect as informers."
Changing Times
Speaking on the origin of drug
abuse, Dr. Rossiter pointed out
that the entire cultural and
psychological environment of the
teenager has undergone significant
changes in one generation.
"The automobile permits a
teenager to exist essentially aloof
from parental or community
supervision. Nearly every teenager
has access to a car or to someone
who does," he said.

"Leisure time is uncommitted
and non-productive. Family unity
has been severely strained by
distractions such as television,
working mothers, and
replacement of home chores by
automation and modern
conveniences. Former sources of
teenage recreation are drying up
rapidly—the vacant lot to play in,
places to ride a bicycle,
uncrowded beaches or parks. The
cost of most conventional
entertainments, such as movies, is
becoming formidable.
High Costs
"Because of the high cost and
inaccessability of areas for
legitimate entertainment, it is
literally cheaper for teenagers to
smoke pot together on a weekend
than to take a date to a jazz
festival or even to a drive-in
movie," Dr. Rossiter said.
"Information on chemicals and
drugs, particularly those which
affect mental behavior, has not
been presented properly to
children—nor for that matter even
to adults. It is best that schools
accept the responsibility of
teaching what is good about these
agents and wherein their dangers
lie," he said.
"It should be obvious that
education concerning the dangers
of drug abuse and protection of
the public against exploitation by
criminal elements should be a
prime objective of society.
Legislation
"Legislation must be devised to
control illegal drug traffic, to
support research education, and
to adjust our social structure to
meet the problem of the
teenager," Dr. Rossiter stressed.
"Teenagers themselves deserve
support in their own efforts to
salvage the dropouts, the social
outcast, and the confused and
frustrated drug users in their own
subculture. Organizations such as
teen drop-in centers are fully
deserving of emergency funds to
help them survive. Adult
institutions should tuck these
fledgling social creations under
their protective wings and give
them sanction as well as
protection from undeserved
criticism," he concluded.
Dr. Rossiter's lecture was the
first in a series of nine being held
weekly at Stanford. The course,
sponsored by the Santa Clara
Valley Science Teachers
Association, is being presented as
a public service by members of
the faculty. Director of the
program is Dr. Sumner Kalman,
professor of pharmacology.
