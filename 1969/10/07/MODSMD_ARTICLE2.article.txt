## Troops To Las Vegas 
### 
LAS VEGAS, Nev.
(AP)~ Mayor Oran Gragson
declared a state of emergency and
asked that National Guard troops
be assembled at their armories
Monday night as roving bands of
young blacks rampaged through
40 city blocks in the
predominantly Negro west side.
"I have asked the governor
(Gov. Paul Lax alt) to place the
troops on standby alert, and I
have been assured that they are
ready to now move in on a
minute's notice," Gragson said.
Gragson's declaration came as
gangs of black youths hurled
rocks and shattered windows at a
West Side shopping center in the
second straight night of racial
violence. Tear gas was used in an
effort to break up the youths but
the gas had little initial effect.
The difficulty began Sunday
after two Negro police officers
stopped a black cab driver for a
routine traffic check, officers said.
A crowd gathered and tempers
flared, and before long rocks were
being thrown.
Withdrawal Plans
WASHINGTON (AP)-A
bi partisan group of more than 90
House members voiced approval
yesterday of a resolution
supporting withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Vietnam "at the
earliest possible date."
A spokesman for the group,
Rep. James Hastings, R-N.Y., said
he believes a specific timetable for
withdrawal would handicap
President Nixon in negotiations.
Still other members of Congress
urged support for a planned Oct.
1 5 demonstration against
continued U.S. participation in
the fighting.
Drug Prices
LOS ANGELES
(AP)—Operation Intercept has
vastly increased the price of
marijuana and other drugs while
drying up the supply California
law enforcement officials agreed
Monday.
They generally confirmed a
report issued Sunday by the
federal government indicating
drug prices have risen 100 per
cent as a result of the massive
crackdown on drug smuggling
from Mexico.

Authorities in San Francisco
declined to give specific figures
but reported drug prices were
somewhat higher and narcotics
arrests fewer in the last few
weeks.
"Grass is more difficult to get
than previously, but this is
something we have been
experiencing for several
months—partly due to Intercept,"
said San Francisco Police Lt. John
Kerrigan.
In the Sacramento area, the
current supply of marijuana is
very limited and the quality very
poor, said a spokesman for the
State Narcotics Bureau, adding,
"the stuff appears to be
homegrown and it contains
substitutes such as alfalfa, nutmeg
and oregano. He siad the price of
an ounce has gone up from $7 to
$20.
Los Angeles policy credited
Operation Intercept with drying
up the supply of marijuana and
dangerous drugs and said the
number of narcotics cases handled
by the division has dropped at
least 30 per cent in two weeks.
State, county and local officials
in Santa Barbara, San Luis
Obispo, Bakersfield, San Jose,
Santa Rosa and other cities
checked by the Associated Press
reported similar scarcity of
marijuana ind other drugs as well
as rising pr.ces.
(Quakes Cost
SANTA ROSA (AP)-Two mild
earth shocks were recorded
Monday in Santa Rosa, which had
an estimated $5 million in damage
from two quakes last Wednesday
night.
Tremors registering 3.7 and 2.5
on the Richter scale jiggled the
area at 7:28 a.m. and 11:20 a.m.,
respectively, but no effects were
reported.
The quakes did not occur along
the major San Andreas Fault, but
a smaller fault in the foothills
north of the city.
Muslim IVoblem
FRESNO (AP)—Fresno State
College President Frederic Ness
asked faculty members Monday to
vote on the proposed hiring of a
controversial Black Muslim poet.
Ness turned down the
employment application of
Marvin Jackmon, (Mervin X), 25,

last week, but said Monday he
wants the opinion of the faculty.
Ness's refusal to hire Jackmon
touched off a campus controversy
last week with minority
representatives vowing to keep the
Black Muslim on campus while
they challenge the decision
through legal channels.
Mets Take Series
The New York Mets, once the
laughing-stock of baseball, beat
Atlanta 7-4 Monday, completed a
three-game sweep in their playoff
for the National League
championship and moved into the
World Series against Baltimore.
Baltimore also made it three
consecutive victories in the
best-of-five American League
playoff, whipping the Minnesota
Twins 11-2 on the Twin's home
grounds.
The World Series opens
Saturday at Baltimore.
Tommie Agee, Ken Boswell and
Wayne Garrett hit home runs as
the Mets came from behind 2-0
and 4-3 deficits for the biggest
victory in their checkered career.
Nolan Ryan, a hard-throwing
right-hander, replaced young Gary
Gentry in the third inning in New
York's Shea Stadium, pitched out
of a bases-loaded situation and
received credit for the Met
victory.
For Baltimore, Paul Blair had
five hits, including a home run
and two doubles, and drove in five
runs. Ellie Hendricks drove in
three runs with two doubles and
Don Buford had four hits in the
18-hit Baltimore attack. Jim
Palmer was the winning pitcher.
