# Counselors Offer Encounter Groups
## 
### 
The Counseling and Testing
Center announced today a
program in "Humanistic
Education" focused around a
variety of encounter, sensitivity,
and discussion groups. The
program actually got underway
Sunday with an all-day
"Minithon" in Muir House, Stern
Hall under the leadership of Drs.
Norman Giddan and Ralph
Metzner.
Planned for autumn quarter are
four general encounter groups
conducted by different staff
members, several special focus
groups, including a black-white
encounter group, a cross-cultural
exchange group, and a group for
''bogged- down" doctoral
candidates.
An encounter group for
"cowards" will be conducted for

students tempted to have a group
experience but wary of it, and a
"sunrise" group meeting from
5:30 to 7:30 a.m. is scheduled.
Also available are groups
focused on study skills and
academic problems. In addition,
students who have a
naturally-formed group and wish a
trained leader are invited to
contact Dr. Giddan, coordinator
of the program.
Different groups will use
different techniques—-verbal,
non-verbal (dance and touch),
videotape feedback, psychodrama,
and time-extended (12 hours or
more) encounters.
Purpose of the program is to
supplement the more traditional
academic experience with a very
personally-relevant experience
oriented toward personal growth
and development and experience
in intensified and meaningful
communication.
Undergraduates or graduate
students interested in the program
may register with a counselor
today, Wednesday, or Thursday in
Old Union room 306. Students
must register in person for any of
the groups.
