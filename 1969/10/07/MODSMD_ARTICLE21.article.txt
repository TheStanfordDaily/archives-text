# KZSU To Provide Broader Coverage
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
Boasting new equipment and a
greatly expanded staff, Stanford s
own radio station, KZSU, resumes
broadcasting today at 7 a.m.
The station plans a program of
rock and classical music, and
broader news coverage. In
addition to standard disc-jockey
formats, two talk shows are being
planned. "The emphasis of the
station's programming will be on
student concerns," said news
director Dan Cook.
About 200 people attended
KZSU's organizational meeting
October 2. Cook attributed the
interest in the station to coverage
of last spring's disturbances.
"About fifty percent of the
people at the meeting were new to
4he station, which I feel is a direct
result of our news and special
feature programming last spring.
People saw, or heard, about the
job we did and wanted to be part
of the excitement," he said.
Extensive coverage of the trials
of Encina Hall demonstrators is
foreseen. Cook said he hoped to
have live coverage of meetings and
rallies in conjunction with the
October 15 Vietnam Moratorium
day.
Facets of the draft, student
demonstrations, and national
affairs will be covered in

newscasts. The station hopes to
cover stories in the surrounding
community which affect Stanford
students.
The station will continue its
policy of live coverage of major
convocations and functions of the
university, and arrangements are
currently being made to allow the
station to broadcast freshman
football games again this fall. As a
special feature, KZSU will
broadcast Professor Philip
Rhinelander's Philosophy of Law
class Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday, at 7 P.M.
KZSU (880 A.M. in the dorms,
90.1 elsewhere) will offer
newscasts at 10 P.M. Monday
through Saturday, and at 6 P.M.
Sunday. Details of all the station's
programming will be available in
the program guide to be published
later this month.
The aim of the station, in
music, as well as news
programming is "to provide
service that is unavailable
elsewhere, and do it well,"
according to station manager Jeff
Eustis and program director Ron
Harris. The facilities of KZSU
provide students with the
opportunity to get valuable
experience in broadcasting and
program engineering, as well as
performing a service to the
Stanford community.
