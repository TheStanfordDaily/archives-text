The faculty Senate has
approved plans to offer graduate
degrees in comparative literature.
According to Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger, chairman of the
Committee on Comparative
Literature, the new program is
expected to enroll no more than
20 students seeking Ph.D.'s in
comparative literature at any one
time.
"Although Stanford is at
present one of the few major
universities in America which does
not offer the Ph.D. in comparative
literature, it already has the
facilities and faculty to offer what
will in all likelihood become one
of the strongest programs among
the more than 50 in existence,"
he noted in a report to the Senate.
Through the Avalon
Foundation, sufficient funds have
been made available to support
both a chairman and secretarial
help needed for the new degree
program. In March, Prof.

English.

literatures, doing their reading in
the original languages.
They will also take a number of
courses of an interdisciplinary
nature, for instance, courses in
thg history and theory of literary
criticism and in the relationship of
literature to other fields. These
courses will be open to graduate
students outside the comparative
literature program. Students
majoring in a single literature also
will be able to take a minor
program in comparative literature.
During 1969-70, the new
program will be administered by a
steering committee headed by

Prof. Lindenberger. Members for
this year will include Profs. Albert
J. Guerard, English; David G.
Halliburton, English; Kurt
Mueller-Vollmer, German; N.
