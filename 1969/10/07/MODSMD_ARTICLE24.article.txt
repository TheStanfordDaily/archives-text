# NROTC Two Year Program Cancelled
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Upper division and graduate
students will no longer be
admitted into the Navy Reserve
Officers Training Corps (NROTC)
according to an announcement
from the Secretary of the Navy.
The two-year contract NRO'I C
program, which allowed students
beyond their first year of study to
enter an officer program, has been
canceled. Beginning immediately
only freshmen and those
sophomores desiring a 5 year
program will be eligible to enter
NROTC.
Marine Colonel Robert L.
Thomas, Professor of Naval
Science, indicated that originally
the two year program had been
designed for "transfer students,

especially from junior colleges,"
who did not have the opportunity
to join the NROTC their freshman
year. In practice "analysis has
shown that this has not been the
case," explained Colonel Thomas.
The two year program was moving
toward becoming almost
exclusively a graduate program.
The two-year contract class
enrolled this year will be the last.
With this change coming at such a
late date.
The four-year contract program
requires students to take certain
Naval Science courses each yeui
and to participate for three
summers in six week training
cruises. The two-year program
included two summer training
periods and the taking of Naval

Science courses for two academic
years. Both programs led to the
commissioning of the student as
an Ensign in the Navy at
graduation and a three year
obligation for active duty.
Army ROTC decided to retain
its two-year program in spite of
the Navy's action. Colonel Stanley
M. Ramey, Professor of Military
Science, indicated that the Army
set up its two year program for
students who transferred from
four year colleges and junior
colleges that did not have any
ROTC program.
Colonel Ramey said, "The
experience at Stanford has been
that most of our applicants [for
the two-year program] have been
doing graduate study. I do not
foresee any change in the Army
ROTC two-vear Dropram."
Colonel Thomas rejected the
idea that campus opposition to
ROTC across the country had
anything to do with the Navy's
decision to abandon the two-year
program.

years. Both programs led to the
commissioning of the student as
an Ensign in the Navy at
graduation and a three year
obligation for active duty.
Army ROTC decided to retain
its two-year program in spite of
the Navy's action. Colonel Stanley
M. Ramey, Professor of Military
Science, indicated that the Army
set up its two year program for
students who transferred from
four year colleges and junior
colleges that did not have any
ROTC program.
Colonel Ramey said, "The
experience at Stanford has been
that most of our applicants [for
the two-year program] have been
doing graduate study. I do not
foresee any change in the Army
ROTC two-vear Dropram."
Colonel Thomas rejected the
idea that campus opposition to
ROTC across the country had
anything to do with the Navy's
decision to abandon the two-year
program.

Upper division and graduate
students will no longer be
admitted into the Navy Reserve
Officers Training Corps (NROTC)
according to an announcement
from the Secretary of the Navy.
The two-year contract NRO'I C
program, which allowed students
beyond their first year of study to
enter an officer program, has been
canceled. Beginning immediately
only freshmen and those
sophomores desiring a 5 year
program will be eligible to enter
NROTC.
Marine Colonel Robert L.
Thomas, Professor of Naval
Science, indicated that originally
the two year program had been
designed for "transfer students,

especially from junior colleges,"
who did not have the opportunity
to join the NROTC their freshman
year. In practice "analysis has
shown that this has not been the
case," explained Colonel Thomas.
The two year program was moving
toward becoming almost
exclusively a graduate program.
The two-year contract class
enrolled this year will be the last.
With this change coming at such a
late date.
The four-year contract program
requires students to take certain
Naval Science courses each yeui
and to participate for three
summers in six week training
cruises. The two-year program
included two summer training
periods and the taking of Naval

Science courses for two academic
years. Both programs led to the
commissioning of the student as
an Ensign in the Navy at
graduation and a three year
obligation for active duty.
