# Growing Pains
## More Students, Less Money 
### 
During the past decade,
California's independent colleges
and universities have expanded
enrollment by about 60 percent,
but costs have not kept pace.
More than 50 in number, the
colleges now provide educational
services worth about $200 million
annually , granting about
one-fourth of all bachelors'
degrees conferred in this state and
nearly half those at the doctoral
level.
But in the coming decade, the
gap between their educational
costs and projected income from
all sources could grow to more
than $100 million annually,
according to a newly published
study by the Association of
Independent California Colleges
and Universities (AICCU), which
includes Stanford and 50 other
independent colleges and
universities.
In California, independent
institutions currently enroll a
higher percentage of black
students than do public
institutions. They also attract
relatively large numbers of
Califonia State Scholarship
winners, National Merit scholars,
Woodrow Wilson fellows, National
Science Foundation fellows, and
Rhodes scholars.

Last year, with a total
enrollment of 95,000 students,
AICCU institutions awarded more
than 10,000 undergraduate
degrees and more than 7,000
postgraduate degrees. Ten years
ago, the corresponding figures
were 6,500 and 3,400
respectively.
In the next decade, however,
they face a growing gap between
costs and projected income from
present sources that could reach
$56 million by 1973 and $127
million by 1978. Unless this gap is
closed, their growth rate may be
significantly reduced, their
educational quality may decline,
and some of the institutions may
no longer remain independent.
According to the AICCU study,
titled "The Price of
Independence: Financing
Independent Higher Education in
California," these institutions now
enjoy a "complementary,
cooperative, and competitive"
relationship with the University of
California and the California State
College systems.
Autonomy Important
"Of all the factors that
contribute worth to the
independent institutions, none is
more important than their

autonomy," the report notes.
"They are free of direct
governmental control. They can
establish their own educational
goals and formulate policies,
programs, and budgets in terms of
these goals. The local control that
is exercised on their campuses
affords a freedom to innovate and
to experiment, and permits both
students and faculty to take active
roles in the decision-making
process..."
During the 1970'5, AICCU
institutions hope to expand
enrollment at a rate of four to five
percent annually. Combined with
a seven percent annual increase in
costs, this means their expenses
will rise about 12 percent each
year.
Tuition probably will account
for about half their educational
income, as it has in recent years.
But each increase in tuition
widens the already great
differential between their charges
and those levied by public
institutions.
The independent institutions
have a combined endowment of
about $600 million. Income from
this source has provided a
declining share of total
educational expenses, but is

expected to stabilize around its
present rate of nine percent of
total costs.
Private Gifts
Gifts and grants from private
individuals, foundations, and
corporations have been increasing
at a rate of 13 percent annually,
and now provide about one-fifth
of educational income. But this
rate of increase may not be
sustained.
The study notes that:
"Foundation support is leveling
off, primarily because of the
redirection of funds into urban
problems. Alumni may be
expected to account for more
support, if only because of the
increase in numbers resulting from
increased enrollments . . .
"The primary source to which
indepenuent higher education
must turn for help, however, is
American business. Corporate
gifts to AICCU institutions have
been increasing over the years, but
not at a rate commensurate with
the increase in profits or with the
increase in need . . .Business is
giving a smaller share of its profits
to independent education than it
used to."
