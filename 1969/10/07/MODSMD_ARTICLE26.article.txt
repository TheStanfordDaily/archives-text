# Trancos Freshman
## True Stanford Indian 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Stanford's mascot is an Indian.
With six exceptions, the Stanford
student is not.
A freshman in Trancos, Russ
Red Elk, a Sioux, is one of
Stanford's Indians. Over six feet
tall, with jet black hair, Russ lives
in Popler, Montana, 22 miles from
where he went to school in Wolf
Point, population 2200.
For a large portion of his life,
Russ has lived on the Fort Peck
Indian Reservation except for the
three years he spent at Choate, an
eastern prep school, on an
Independent Schools' Talent
Search Program Scholarship.
The transition to Stanford
proved less rigorous for Russ than
the shift from reservation life to
academic life at Choate. The first
year there was academically and
emotionally trying and the
adjustment proved difficult. His
schoolmates had names like
Rockefeller and the academic load
piled on top of the emotional
adjustment forced two of Russ's
friends to drop out of similar
situations.

Russ has spent most of his time
on Indian land even when not on
the reservation. Choate was built
on Indian land. Russ doesn't feel
the modern Indian is oppressed by
past actions like these but rather
that the red man has had a "bad
history."
Russ that "differences
between the white man and the
red man are still distinct. But
rather than oppression, the
relationship could more
accurately be described as
frustration due to the inability to
integrate because of cultural
differences.
Institutions such as the
reservation, the Haskell Institute
for Indian studies in Kansas, and
the Organization of Native
American Students, which is
designed to help Indians adjust to
prep school life, serve to preserve
and perpetuate Indian culture
while at the same time helping
Indians adjust to the mainstream
of American life."
Mrs. Red Elk and others help
preserve Indian culture by
practicing the arts of beadwork,
leatherwork, costuming, dancing,
folklore, and language. Russ
doesn't reject the confinement of
these activities to the reservation
but rather sees the reservation as a
geographically and spiritually
unifying factor serving as "an
essential force in maintaining
tradition."
Personal Problems
The problems of partaking in
national life and responsibility
have affected Russ personally and
he observes that "Naturally,
Indian isolationism is no longer an
acceptable arrangement in
America." As a nineteen year old
male, Russ feels the potent
influence of the draft being

extended upon himself and other
Indians.
"The Indian youth will
generally serve if drafted," he
explained "since he usually hasn't
the financial or legal means to
fight induction. After serving, the
Indian male returns as a highly
respected and honored member of
the community*
By no means does the
acceptance of the draft indicate
an Indian approval of either the
military in general or the war in
Vietnam. There is a growing
minority in the Indian community
who after broader historical
exposure picture Vietnam as still
another attempt by the white man
in the United States to extend his
influence over other peoples."
Russ commented he thought he
would serve if called.
War and Drugs
Paramount to the issue of the
war is the issue of drugs. "My
ancestors used drugs in order to
obtain religious visions so pot and
other hallucinatory drugs are a
part of my culture. I feel that if
an individual is cognizant of the
power, effects, and consequences
of drugs, then he has the option
to exercise his choice in dealing
with them."
Another choice that Russ and
others are forced to make is that of
a vocation. He observed that
"traditionally the Indian has
attempted to blend the skills of
his mind and his hands to lead a
happy and profitable life, and I
am no exception. Right now, I
have interests in sociology, but
they can change.
"I really won't know what I
want to do until I can investigate
the areas available as careers here
at Stanford, then choose from a
better informed viewpoint."

Red Elk, a Sioux, is one of
Stanford's Indians. Over six feet
tall, with jet black hair, Russ lives
in Popler, Montana, 22 miles from
where he went to school in Wolf
Point, population 2200.
For a large portion of his life,
Russ has lived on the Fort Peck
Indian Reservation except for the
three years he spent at Choate, an
eastern prep school, on an
Independent Schools' Talent
Search Program Scholarship.
The transition to Stanford
proved less rigorous for Russ than
the shift from reservation life to
academic life at Choate. The first
year there was academically and
emotionally trying and the
adjustment proved difficult. His
schoolmates had names like
Rockefeller and the academic load
piled on top of the emotional
adjustment forced two of Russ's
friends to drop out of similar
situations.

Russ has spent most of his time
on Indian land even when not on
the reservation. Choate was built
on Indian land. Russ doesn't feel
the modern Indian is oppressed by
past actions like these but rather
that the red man has had a "bad
history."
Russ that "differences
between the white man and the
red man are still distinct. But
rather than oppression, the
relationship could more
accurately be described as
frustration due to the inability to
integrate because of cultural
differences.
Institutions such as the
reservation, the Haskell Institute
for Indian studies in Kansas, and
the Organization of Native
American Students, which is
designed to help Indians adjust to
prep school life, serve to preserve
and perpetuate Indian culture
while at the same time helping
Indians adjust to the mainstream
of American life."
Mrs. Red Elk and others help
preserve Indian culture by
practicing the arts of beadwork,
leatherwork, costuming, dancing,
folklore, and language. Russ
doesn't reject the confinement of
these activities to the reservation
but rather sees the reservation as a
geographically and spiritually
unifying factor serving as "an
essential force in maintaining
tradition."
Personal Problems
The problems of partaking in
national life and responsibility
have affected Russ personally and
he observes that "Naturally,
Indian isolationism is no longer an
acceptable arrangement in
America." As a nineteen year old
male, Russ feels the potent
influence of the draft being

extended upon himself and other
Indians.
"The Indian youth will
generally serve if drafted," he
explained "since he usually hasn't
the financial or legal means to
fight induction. After serving, the
Indian male returns as a highly
respected and honored member of
the community*
By no means does the
acceptance of the draft indicate
an Indian approval of either the
military in general or the war in
Vietnam. There is a growing
minority in the Indian community
who after broader historical
exposure picture Vietnam as still
another attempt by the white man
in the United States to extend his
influence over other peoples."
Russ commented he thought he
would serve if called.
War and Drugs
Paramount to the issue of the
war is the issue of drugs. "My
ancestors used drugs in order to
obtain religious visions so pot and
other hallucinatory drugs are a
part of my culture. I feel that if
an individual is cognizant of the
power, effects, and consequences
of drugs, then he has the option
to exercise his choice in dealing
with them."
Another choice that Russ and
others are forced to make is that of
a vocation. He observed that
"traditionally the Indian has
attempted to blend the skills of
his mind and his hands to lead a
happy and profitable life, and I
am no exception. Right now, I
have interests in sociology, but
they can change.
"I really won't know what I
want to do until I can investigate
the areas available as careers here
at Stanford, then choose from a
better informed viewpoint."
