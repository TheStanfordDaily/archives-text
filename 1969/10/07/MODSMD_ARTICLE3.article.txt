# SDS Sets Radical Moratorium Plans
## 
### JOHN COONROD 
In its meeting last night the
Stanford chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society decided to
focus attention on the imperialist
nature of the war during the
October 15 Moratorium.
The group of 115 voted for the
Moratorium saying that they will
stress the position of support for
the National Liberation Front, as
part of a policy of support for
insurgent movements.
Presentations concerning the
nature of the Moratorium effort
were presented by Martin Carnoy,
professor in the School of
Education and a prime mover of
the Moratorium committee; Paul
Rupert, member of SDS and
Resistance; and SDS members
Mark Silverman, Bruce Pollock,
and Leonard Siegel.
Liberal Domination
Carnoy and Rupert explained
that the Moratorium had
originally been envisioned as a
strike, but alleged that the large
liberal element had watered it
down.
Pollock stated that the SDS
must meet the liberal domination
of the Moratorium "in gradual
and increasing ways." He added
that the SDS would in no way
subvert the Moratorium, but that
it would try "to push the line
further left."
Siegel stated that radical
identity could be brought to the

movement by stressing thu ' .1 is
this area which provides the
expertise and the defense
industries for the War.'' In this
respect, lie suggested that the SDS
picket and leaflet the Industrial
Park, and perhaps organize a
guided tour of the park.
Activities Stated
Other activities being planned
include a reunion dinner at AEL,
guerilla theater productions in
the quad or in Palo Alto, and
disrupting classes held on the
fifteenth by encouraging students
to discuss the war or leave class.
It was also decided to stress
education of the war in the form
on dorm discussions, and in an
open program on the Left's view
of the war. This program is set for
Cubberley next Monday night at
7:30.
Before voting on the proposals
that were made, the meeting
broke into affinity groups to
discuss and suggest proposals.
There were some members who
stated that SDS should ignore the
Moratorium because its politics
were not concerned with ending
United States involvement in
South East Asia.
One member commented that
"even Nixon wanted to stop the
war, there is nothing radical in
that."

In its meeting last night the
Stanford chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society decided to
focus attention on the imperialist
nature of the war during the
October 15 Moratorium.
The group of 115 voted for the
Moratorium saying that they will
stress the position of support for
the National Liberation Front, as
part of a policy of support for
insurgent movements.
Presentations concerning the
nature of the Moratorium effort
were presented by Martin Carnoy,
professor in the School of
Education and a prime mover of
the Moratorium committee; Paul
Rupert, member of SDS and
Resistance; and SDS members
Mark Silverman, Bruce Pollock,
and Leonard Siegel.
Liberal Domination
Carnoy and Rupert explained
that the Moratorium had
originally been envisioned as a
strike, but alleged that the large
liberal element had watered it
down.
Pollock stated that the SDS
must meet the liberal domination
of the Moratorium "in gradual
and increasing ways." He added
that the SDS would in no way
subvert the Moratorium, but that
it would try "to push the line
further left."
Siegel stated that radical
identity could be brought to the

movement by stressing thu ' .1 is
this area which provides the
expertise and the defense
industries for the War.'' In this
respect, lie suggested that the SDS
picket and leaflet the Industrial
Park, and perhaps organize a
guided tour of the park.
Activities Stated
Other activities being planned
include a reunion dinner at AEL,
guerilla theater productions in
the quad or in Palo Alto, and
disrupting classes held on the
fifteenth by encouraging students
to discuss the war or leave class.
It was also decided to stress
education of the war in the form
on dorm discussions, and in an
open program on the Left's view
of the war. This program is set for
Cubberley next Monday night at
7:30.
Before voting on the proposals
that were made, the meeting
broke into affinity groups to
discuss and suggest proposals.
There were some members who
stated that SDS should ignore the
Moratorium because its politics
were not concerned with ending
United States involvement in
South East Asia.
One member commented that
"even Nixon wanted to stop the
war, there is nothing radical in
that."
