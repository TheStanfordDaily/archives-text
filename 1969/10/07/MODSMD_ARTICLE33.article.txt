# Survival Day Set
## 
### 
More than a dozen environment
action organizations are joining
forces for a public information
forum "Survival Day" in San
Francisco on Saturday, October
25. The purpose of the day's
activities is to direct public
attention to what Zero Population
Growth (ZPG) considers the
imminent destruction of our life
environment.
Particular problems which ZPG
will highlight are pollution,
wildlife destruction, and the
population explosion. A wide

variety of organizations will
participate in a parade, discussion
forum and a gathering at Civic
Center Plaza, which will feature
speakers and informal exchange of
information.
ZPG is an organization
proposing that uncontrolled
population growth is a central
factor in all environmental decay.
It hopes to center national
attention on the Bay Area as the
leader in directing public notice to
life-quality problems.
