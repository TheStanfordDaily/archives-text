# Defense Study Urges Keeping ROTC Credit
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Rejecting alternative methods
of procuring military officers, a
special Defense Department
committee recommended October
3 that the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps (ROTC) program
be retained with certain revisions.
The report prepared by a
committee of military personnel
and educators, including Dr. E.
Howard Brooks,' Stanford Vice
Provost, cited the need for a blend
of civilian and military studies and
the need for the civilian influence
in the control of the military in
justifying its decision.
Recommending that
"appropriate academic credit be
given for ROTC courses," the
national committee supports
maintaining the current policy of
academic credit at cooperating
colleges and universities. This is in
opposition to last year's decision
by Stanford's Academic Council
to deny credit for all ROTC
courses taught by military
personnel beginning with the
freshman class entering fall of
1970.

Dr. Brooks stated that the
committee felt that "right now
ROTC is the best and most
economical method of getting
officers in the number that is
believed necessary." Once this
decision was reached by the
committee, they "concentrated
then on how to improve aiid make
the program more acceptable.
Dr. Brooks was on the Stanford
Academic Senate committee last
year that investigated the status of
ROTC. He signed the minority
report that recommended certain
changes in ROTC, many similar to
those of the Defense Department
Committee. The majority report
recommended denying credit to
ROTC courses.
Objections have been raised to
the giving of academic credit for
ROTC courses, faculty rank
awarded military instructors, drill
and the use of weapons, and the
basis of ROTC existing on college
campuses. The committee was
appointed last June to examine
the existing ROTC programs,
evaluate alternative programs, and
evaluate criticisms of the
programs.
The committee recommended:
That faculty-administration
student committees be established
to oversee the program, determine
which courses should receive
academic credit, assume more
responsibility for ROTC
instruction, and enrich the ROTC
program.
That appropriate academic rank
be granted to military instructors
based on their qualifications and
that ROTC programs be granted a
place in the curriculum.
That changes be made in the
Navy's contract with scholarship
students, that the Navy eliminate
its ban against marriage of
scholarship students, that the
number of scholarships be raised
and that summer training pay and
monthly stipends for the last two
years be increased.
That the federal government
pay for the institutional costs of
ROTC currently paid by the
universities.
According to Dr. Brooks, the
committee rejected the alternative
of switching all military training
(courses and drill) to summer
training camps for fear of losing
"the intangible advantages in the
interaction on campus of the
military and civilian." Likewise,
the attitude that "uniforms,
weapons, and drill are
characteristic of the military. Why
hide it?" led the committee to
recommend that weapons and
drill remain on college campuses
as part of the ROTC program.
Dr. Brooks feels that "a major
part of the criticism of ROTC is
related to the Vietnam war. But

the services have been slow to face
up to problems with it [ROTC)."
In an editorial of October 5,
the New York Times criticized the
recommendations of the
committee as "based on
superficial understanding of the
issues." The editorial continued,
"The objections are philosophical
rather than qualitative. To give
ROTC academic status is to make
the college or university itself a
surrogate for the military ....
"Retention of ROTC on
campus as a voluntary, noncredit
activity, subsidized by the
Defense Department and available
to those who wish to discharge
their service obligation in this
fashion is the proper course . . ."
Standard Criticism
Dr. Brooks feels that his
editorial is "not in the least
surprising" and he expects that it
will be the "rather standard
academic criticism of the report."
The day after the committee
report was released, a House
Armed Services committee
recommended that Defense
Department grants be withdrawn
from colleges that discriminate
against ROTC or on-campus
military recruitment. This
represents pressure exerted by
certain members of Congress on
colleges to keep ROTC. The
report was purposely released
immediately after the Defense
Department committee on ROTC
made public its report.
Dr. Brooks stated, "We're all
very worried about this threat of
retaliation for an attitude against
ROTC. A great deal of money is
furnished by the Defense
Department for non-defense
research."
The Defense Department
committee evaluated Ihe question,
"Is it reasonable to ask
institutions of higher education to
participate in the preparation of
officers for the armed forces?" In
answering the question in the
affirmative, the committee stated
that "one overriding priority must
be recognized, namely, the
national security of the
country . . .
"The national government can
properly look to public
institutions, supported as they are
by the taxpayer, to provide
leadership in safeguarding the
entire population. Nor can the
nation's privately supported
universities be exempted from a
part in the responsibility."
The committee further justified
the position of ROTC by claiming
"that officer education by means
of ROTC on civilian campuses
strengthens our traditional civilian
participation in and influence
upon the military, whereas
alternative plans yield more to
domination by the military
organizations acting on its own."

will be the "rather standard
academic criticism of the report."
The day after the committee
report was released, a House
Armed Services committee
recommended that Defense
Department grants be withdrawn
from colleges that discriminate
against ROTC or on-campus
military recruitment. This
represents pressure exerted by
certain members of Congress on
colleges to keep ROTC. The
report was purposely released

made public its report.
Dr. Brooks stated, "We're all
very worried about this threat of
retaliation for an attitude against
ROTC. A great deal of money is
furnished by the Defense
Department for non-defense
research."
The Defense Department
committee evaluated Ihe question,
"Is it reasonable to ask
institutions of higher education to
participate in the preparation of
officers for the armed forces?" In
answering the question in the
affirmative, the committee stated
that "one overriding priority must
be recognized, namely, the
national security of the
country . . .
"The national government can
properly look to public
institutions, supported as they are
by the taxpayer, to provide
leadership in safeguarding the
entire population. Nor can the
nation's privately supported
universities be exempted from a
part in the responsibility."
The committee further justified
the position of ROTC by claiming
"that officer education by means
of ROTC on civilian campuses
strengthens our traditional civilian
participation in and influence
upon the military, whereas
alternative plans yield more to
domination by the military
organizations acting on its own."

CHANGES COMING—The ROTC campus headquarters pictured above
continues as a focal point of controversy. A Defense Department report released
last week urges that universities ami colleges continue to give academic credit
for on-campus military programs.
Rejecting alternative methods
of procuring military officers, a
special Defense Department
committee recommended October
3 that the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps (ROTC) program
be retained with certain revisions.
The report prepared by a
committee of military personnel
and educators, including Dr. E.
Howard Brooks,' Stanford Vice
Provost, cited the need for a blend
of civilian and military studies and
the need for the civilian influence
in the control of the military in
justifying its decision.
Recommending that
"appropriate academic credit be
given for ROTC courses," the
national committee supports
maintaining the current policy of
academic credit at cooperating
colleges and universities. This is in
opposition to last year's decision
by Stanford's Academic Council
to deny credit for all ROTC
courses taught by military
personnel beginning with the
freshman class entering fall of
1970.

Dr. Brooks stated that the
committee felt that "right now
ROTC is the best and most
economical method of getting
officers in the number that is
believed necessary." Once this
decision was reached by the
committee, they "concentrated
then on how to improve aiid make
the program more acceptable.
Dr. Brooks was on the Stanford
Academic Senate committee last
year that investigated the status of
ROTC. He signed the minority
report that recommended certain
changes in ROTC, many similar to
those of the Defense Department
Committee. The majority report
recommended denying credit to
ROTC courses.
Objections have been raised to
the giving of academic credit for
ROTC courses, faculty rank
awarded military instructors, drill
and the use of weapons, and the
basis of ROTC existing on college
campuses. The committee was
appointed last June to examine
the existing ROTC programs,
evaluate alternative programs, and
evaluate criticisms of the
programs.
The committee recommended:
That faculty-administration
student committees be established
to oversee the program, determine
which courses should receive
academic credit, assume more
responsibility for ROTC
instruction, and enrich the ROTC
program.
That appropriate academic rank
be granted to military instructors
based on their qualifications and
that ROTC programs be granted a
place in the curriculum.
That changes be made in the
Navy's contract with scholarship
students, that the Navy eliminate
its ban against marriage of
scholarship students, that the
number of scholarships be raised
and that summer training pay and
monthly stipends for the last two
years be increased.
That the federal government
pay for the institutional costs of
ROTC currently paid by the
universities.
According to Dr. Brooks, the
committee rejected the alternative
of switching all military training
(courses and drill) to summer
training camps for fear of losing
"the intangible advantages in the
interaction on campus of the
military and civilian." Likewise,
the attitude that "uniforms,
weapons, and drill are
characteristic of the military. Why
hide it?" led the committee to
recommend that weapons and
drill remain on college campuses
as part of the ROTC program.
Dr. Brooks feels that "a major
part of the criticism of ROTC is
related to the Vietnam war. But

the services have been slow to face
up to problems with it [ROTC)."
In an editorial of October 5,
the New York Times criticized the
recommendations of the
committee as "based on
superficial understanding of the
issues." The editorial continued,
"The objections are philosophical
rather than qualitative. To give
ROTC academic status is to make
the college or university itself a
surrogate for the military ....
"Retention of ROTC on
campus as a voluntary, noncredit
activity, subsidized by the
Defense Department and available
to those who wish to discharge
their service obligation in this
fashion is the proper course . . ."

that ROTC programs be granted a
place in the curriculum.
That changes be made in the
Navy's contract with scholarship
students, that the Navy eliminate
its ban against marriage of
scholarship students, that the
number of scholarships be raised
and that summer training pay and
monthly stipends for the last two
years be increased.
That the federal government
pay for the institutional costs of
ROTC currently paid by the
universities.
According to Dr. Brooks, the
committee rejected the alternative
of switching all military training
(courses and drill) to summer
training camps for fear of losing
"the intangible advantages in the
interaction on campus of the
military and civilian." Likewise,
the attitude that "uniforms,
weapons, and drill are
characteristic of the military. Why
hide it?" led the committee to
recommend that weapons and
drill remain on college campuses
as part of the ROTC program.
Dr. Brooks feels that "a major
part of the criticism of ROTC is
related to the Vietnam war. But

the services have been slow to face
up to problems with it [ROTC)."
In an editorial of October 5,
the New York Times criticized the
recommendations of the
committee as "based on
superficial understanding of the
issues." The editorial continued,
"The objections are philosophical
rather than qualitative. To give
ROTC academic status is to make
the college or university itself a
surrogate for the military ....
"Retention of ROTC on
campus as a voluntary, noncredit
activity, subsidized by the
Defense Department and available
to those who wish to discharge
their service obligation in this
fashion is the proper course . . ."
Standard Criticism
Dr. Brooks feels that his
editorial is "not in the least
surprising" and he expects that it
will be the "rather standard
academic criticism of the report."
The day after the committee
report was released, a House
Armed Services committee
recommended that Defense
Department grants be withdrawn
from colleges that discriminate
against ROTC or on-campus
military recruitment. This
represents pressure exerted by
certain members of Congress on
colleges to keep ROTC. The
report was purposely released
immediately after the Defense
Department committee on ROTC
made public its report.
Dr. Brooks stated, "We're all
very worried about this threat of
retaliation for an attitude against
ROTC. A great deal of money is
furnished by the Defense
Department for non-defense
research."
The Defense Department
committee evaluated Ihe question,
"Is it reasonable to ask
institutions of higher education to
participate in the preparation of
officers for the armed forces?" In
answering the question in the
affirmative, the committee stated
that "one overriding priority must
be recognized, namely, the
national security of the
country . . .
"The national government can
properly look to public
institutions, supported as they are
by the taxpayer, to provide
leadership in safeguarding the
entire population. Nor can the
nation's privately supported
universities be exempted from a
part in the responsibility."
The committee further justified
the position of ROTC by claiming
"that officer education by means
of ROTC on civilian campuses
strengthens our traditional civilian
participation in and influence
upon the military, whereas
alternative plans yield more to
domination by the military
organizations acting on its own."

CHANGES COMING—The ROTC campus headquarters pictured above
continues as a focal point of controversy. A Defense Department report released
last week urges that universities ami colleges continue to give academic credit
for on-campus military programs.
Rejecting alternative methods
of procuring military officers, a
special Defense Department
committee recommended October
3 that the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps (ROTC) program
be retained with certain revisions.
The report prepared by a
committee of military personnel
and educators, including Dr. E.
Howard Brooks,' Stanford Vice
Provost, cited the need for a blend
of civilian and military studies and
the need for the civilian influence
in the control of the military in
justifying its decision.
Recommending that
"appropriate academic credit be
given for ROTC courses," the
national committee supports
maintaining the current policy of
academic credit at cooperating
colleges and universities. This is in
opposition to last year's decision
by Stanford's Academic Council
to deny credit for all ROTC
courses taught by military
personnel beginning with the
freshman class entering fall of
1970.

Dr. Brooks stated that the
committee felt that "right now
ROTC is the best and most
economical method of getting
officers in the number that is
believed necessary." Once this
decision was reached by the
committee, they "concentrated
then on how to improve aiid make
the program more acceptable.
Dr. Brooks was on the Stanford
Academic Senate committee last
year that investigated the status of
ROTC. He signed the minority
report that recommended certain
changes in ROTC, many similar to
those of the Defense Department
Committee. The majority report
recommended denying credit to
ROTC courses.
Objections have been raised to
the giving of academic credit for
ROTC courses, faculty rank
awarded military instructors, drill
and the use of weapons, and the
basis of ROTC existing on college
campuses. The committee was
appointed last June to examine
the existing ROTC programs,
evaluate alternative programs, and
evaluate criticisms of the
programs.
The committee recommended:
That faculty-administration
student committees be established
to oversee the program, determine
which courses should receive
academic credit, assume more
responsibility for ROTC
instruction, and enrich the ROTC
program.
That appropriate academic rank
be granted to military instructors
based on their qualifications and
that ROTC programs be granted a
place in the curriculum.
That changes be made in the
Navy's contract with scholarship
students, that the Navy eliminate
its ban against marriage of
scholarship students, that the
