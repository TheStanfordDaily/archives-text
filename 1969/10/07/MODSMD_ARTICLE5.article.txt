# Constitution Approved
## ASSU Awaits Senate 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The ASSU constituion, adopted
last spring, has received its seal of
approval from the Board of
Trustees and President Pitzer.
However, it will be late October
before the key provision on
student government, a
streamlined, 40-member Senate,
goes into operation. And central
to the problem, this body's
committee on nominations must

pass on all student committee
appointments.
It will be impossible to name
students to four trustee's
committees before the board
meets next Tuesday.
These committees will include
students as voting members for
the first time this year. Two of
these committees, the one on
Land and Building Development
and the other on Academic
Affairs, have taken on added
importance in students' eyes in
the past year.
Interim Nominations
In the interim, the old
Legislature (LASSU) committee
on nominations will review
student applications for the three
student positions on the
university president's Land and
Building Development Committee
and the three student positions on
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
All these appointments will be
subject to later approval of the
student senate.
Applications for these two
committees are available in the
ASSU office. They must be
turned in by noon Friday.
The LASSU committee on
nominations includes:
Tony Maran, a graduate student
in electrical engineering; John
Grant, a junior in political science;
Doug Anderson, a sophomore;
Neil Reav, a business school
student; and Fay Armstrong, a
senior.
A sixth member on the
committee, Nate Kirtman, has
entered Boa It Law School in
Berkeley. Pat McMahon, a senior
in communications and a former

member of the committee, will
serve in his place.
LASSU Problems
The opening session of LASSU
has traditionally brought cries of
anguish from student government
participants. Its unwieldy size,
sometimes reaching 130 members,
left it open to manipulation by
special interest groups.
Election of a smaller body by
the Hare system of proportional
representation is expected to
correct this deficiency.
"The focal point of 'student
power,' that is of influence more
than it is power, under the new
constitution is the student
senate," says Pat Shea, member of
the Council of Presidents.
With the deadline for
applications set 5 p.m., Thursday,
only ten students have turned in
petitions signed by the necessary
15 students.
Elections Scheduled
Elections are scheduled for
next week on Wednesday and
Thursday at nine polling places
across campus.
Operation of the Student
Judicial Council (SJC) is also
delayed until the new committee
on nominations is formed. Three
students selected by and from the
student senate must serve on the
selection committee for SJC
student members.
