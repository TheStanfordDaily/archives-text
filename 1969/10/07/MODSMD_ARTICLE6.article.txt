# Moratorium Drive Opens
## 
### 
A Vietnam Moratorium booth
opened yesterday on White
Memorial Plaza as the Moratorium
drive on campus continues.
Bumper stickers, information
sheets, and postcards for those
wishing to write the President are
available.
Student chairman for the
Moratorium effort, John Kramer,
is urging all students to stop by
the booth this week to learn more
about the Moratorium and si.'n up

for one of the activities of
Moratorium Day, Oct. 15.
Also, he said organizers are still
"actively searching for volunteers
to help organize their dorms or
fraternities or friends for
participation in the Moratorium."
In addition to writing the
President and the Congress, the
Moratorium Committee is urging
all students to write their parents
about Moratorium, explaining
why they are participating in it.

The Vietnam Moratorium
Movement was conceived last
summer at a national meeting of
student leaders. It was planned as
a non-violent movement which
would unite the efforts of the
many different war protest
organizations in the nation.
It is hoped by the Moratorium
leaders around the country that
personal contact between the
students and the public will create
a powerful grass roots movement
to end the war rapidly.
