# Inside View
## Back From Lebanon 
### Patricia Mihaly 
(Miss Mihaly, recently returned
from a year's study in Beirut,
Lebanon at the American
University there. She is now
completing her senior year as a
political science major.)
As my plane rushed me toward
California I strained to imagine
that I was still in Lebanon or
could be there if only I wished it
hard enough . . . and so I tried.
The problem was that
Stanford-in-Lebanon has all too
small a student body (one student
each year at the American
University of Beirut) and one's
stay there is all too short no
matter how the student stretches
the school year to the limits of
two Septembers as I did.
To be an American in this
small, little known and less
understood country is a very
special experience. I found that
the Lebanese, whether Christian,
Moslem or Jew, have a deep
respect for all the ideals of
freedom, justice, open-mindedness
and compassion that they imagine
Americans to live by, whether
correct or not. Yet they feel that
just afe their government and
leaders sometimes misguide them,
so too are the American people
sometimes misguided, resulting
not only in the misunderstanding
of Lebanon by Americans but far
worse —the desire to maintain this
breach in understanding.
Americans are blinded by labels ol
all sorts from seeing that this little
country is made, as they are, of
people striving for ideals of
freedom, justice, etc.; that it not
only has a defense ministry
(although too feeble to challenge
any nation), but also a lively trade
economy, a great number of
religious communities with
sheikhs, patriarchs and rabbis, a
landscape and climate which
could justify calling Lebanon a
miniature California, an amazingly
well-developed educational system
for a developing nation, and a
village society that mixes
parochialism at its strongest with
the high degree of
cosmopolitanism necessary to a
world-trade economy. What
Americans ever catch such a broad
glimpse of Lebanon? Certainly
not the reporters who relay only
the sensational in that unstable
area of the world. Only the
businessmen and the small, but
regular turnover of American
students staying there each
year —about .0001% of the
American population —are aware
of the true nature of this country.
Hinders Unity
Lebanon is a charming
country —and certainly its charm
is generously lavished on this
small percentage of Americans

who stay for more than an airport
stopover. The warmth, generosity,
love of life, and sense of
individualism of the Lebanese are
easy to see at first glance. But to
study the country in depth brings
out as many complexities, if not
more, than in far older, larger and
developed countries. Lebanon's
main problem is its heterogeneity.
It is impossible to give any
meaningful description of what
"the American" looks like, how
he was raised, what religion he
professes, etc.—questions I was
often faced with but could never
answer. But who would expect
this of a small nation of less than
two million in the heart of the
dark-skinned, Moslem, traditional
Arab world? The Lebanese, Arab
by culture rather than race, are
truly complex. Present-day
Lebanese are offspring of
Phoenicians, Turks, Arabs, and '
Europeans (many from the times
of the crusades). Their religions
span the whole spectrum of sects
in all three monotheistic religions,
due to the fact that the Lebanese
mountains have provided a refuge
from persecution through the
ages. And their economy sustains
village olive growers, middlemen
of world-commerce, and
international bankers.
As to the political scene, our
battles between Democrats and
Republicans seem like puppy-love
in comparison with the Lebanese
variety-pack of pro-West,
pro-East, pro-Syria, pro-Nasser,
pro-French, pro-Lebanon, and the
innumerable pro-clan leader
parties—all vying for political
power. I am majoring in political
science, yet I would dare any
scholar to make scientific or even
non-scientific sense out of the
Lebanese political scene where
election battles (about as
democratic as ours) are fought
with unbridled fury, but where
the country can quite successfully
function without a cabinet for
almost a year (as it did while I was
there).
Lebanon, because of all its
diversity, is in a shaky position in
the world, caught in the middle of
many of the world's major
struggles. It needs to make firm
stands on the East-West,
Arab-Israeli, socialist-capitalist,
and traditional-revolutionary
conflicts. Yet so far in all these its
heterogeneous make-up has left it
in stalemate and indecision. One
can appreciate all the rich variety
in Lebanon, as I did this year, but
one is left to wonder how long
any nation can balance on the
tightrope of decision and not fall
off before reaching one or the
other side.
