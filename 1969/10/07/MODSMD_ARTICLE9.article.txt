# Faculty Forum
## On October 15 
### Stephen J. Kline 
If I were a student I would not
attend class on October 15th. As a
faculty member, I will dismiss my
class that day if all or nearly all its
members concur. I will contribute
in any way I can to the protests
which do not infringe the rights of
others.
As an individual, I believe
President Nixon's campaign
pledges on ending the Vietnam
war are overdue. His pledges were
unequivocal. They contained no
provisos for flimsy excuses about
"saving American face." The
government's recent actions and
omissions in civil rights, in urban
ghetto needs, and in ecological
problems also make clear the great
gap between word and deed.
Political Pressure
The question often asked on
campuses is, "What can we do
about these things?" The most
frequently accepted answer is to
create civil chaos. I would like to
suggest another courseâ€”strong
political pressure on the U.S.
Congress. The Congress is almost
always responsive to clear, that is
overwhelming, mandates from the
< lectorate. On most of these

questions it has not yet received
such a mandate; it has received
only very mixed signals. The
clearest opinions thus far have
come from the academic and
intellectual communities, but even
these have been somewhat mixed.
I urge all members of the
Stanford community, radicals,
liberals, conservatives and
reactionaries alike to now join in
making these signals very clear
and in transmitting them to the
Congress via as many routes as are
open to us individually and
collectively.
No n-Violent
I also urge that we do this
rationally and without violence so
tha our representatives will know
these are the opinions of the
responsible majority of our
community and not merely a few
who can be discounted as
extremists.
