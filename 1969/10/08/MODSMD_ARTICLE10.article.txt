## Agony of the Scientists 
### Joshua Lederberg 
The advance of science, which
is to say the increase in collective
knowledge of the natural world, is
perhaps the only measure of
human progress during the last
3000 years about which no
argument is possible. Even here
we must be careful not to confuse
the claim: although most readers
of this newspaper live in
unprecedented comfort and

affluence, these by-products of
science are very unequally sprayed
over the world's population.
Taking all in account, some are
even abused more than helped. It
may also be part of human nature
that the inner and outter strife
generated by that inequality will
generally outweigh the material
contribution of technology to the
satisfaction of life enjoyed by the
individual.
Science today is at a point of
crisis. Given the equation that
"Knowledge equals power," it is a
plausible scapegoat for failures of
the social system. (The phrase had
an empty ring after the urgent
pleas of an overwhelming majority
of U.S. scientists failed to reverse
the Senate's vote on the Safeguard
system—and now, count on it,
"science" will be blamed for the
continued escalation of nuclear
arsenals.) Accusations that science
is wrecking the environment and
the privacy and individuality of
human life, may stem from a
callow confusion of the pursuit of
knowledge with its unthinking
exploitation. Nevertheless, these
concerns are being internalized to
make a moral crisis for more and
more young scientists, and at least
one who must reluctantly admit
to "middle-aged."

Alfred Nobel endowed the
famous prizes that bear his name
as a kind of penance for the
invention of dynamite. The Nobel
Prize for Peace most directly
fulfills his moral aim—and has had
very hard going in a turbulent
century. The prizes for science
have assimilated the scientific
ethic that the objective pursuit of
knowledge may show the nations
how to quiet their petty conflicts
in favor of rational methods of
solving problems by analysis and
negotiation. These awards have
then focussed on the recognition
of creativity in pure science,
rather than immediate human
benefits (which would also be
hard to measure with assurance as
to the long term impact. The
award for DDT, an exception to
pure science, dramatizes this
problem.)
The science awards have, more
than any other institution,
publicized how knowledge is
universal, that it knows no
national boundaries. On the other
hand, the superpowers have
concluded that force is the rule of

reason in world politics. The
mobilization of science behind
that principle over-reaches Nobel's
worst fears. The central moral
issue of science is that we do not
have science of peace, and hardly
know where to begin in building
one.

In recent years, the Nobel
foundation has looked for ways to
revitalize Alfred Nobel's
testament. This month, it
conducted a conference in
Stockholm on "The place of
values in a world of facts" with a
roster of world luminaries with
poets like Auden, economists like
Gunnar Myrdal, and social and
natural scientists like Doxiadis,
Konrad Lorenz, Margaret Mead,
Linus Pauling and Glenn Seaborg.
No revolutionary discovery will
emerge from this kind of
discussion. It would be enough to
find a tangible expression of the
myth of Pandora's box: That
Hope was there too.

From the perspective of my
own participation in science, I
certainly would not tax my
colleagues with indifference to
human problems. However, I
believe that many of them are
easily discouraged by larger
problems and neglect to search for
the ways in which their own
expertise might be a unique key
to solving a small problem, or
perhaps more often to discovering
an insidious new one. This would
also require a degree of
self-education about issues of
human importance which is not
encouraged by the existing system
of academic recognition (right up,
one might add, to he Nobel Prizes
too).
The vigilante, is, however,
actively discouraged by a system
of support for research that "buys
projects and results." He needs an
atmosphere of independent
initiative, especially in our
universities, that is eroded by
activist intolerance on one side,
but even more by intrusive
management of university affairs
by the government, on the other.
The tone of recent attacks on the
financial independence of
foundations, though impelled by
some obvious abuses of tax
privileges, is a serious omen for
the viability of that unpopular
vigilance most urgently needed by
the most technical of societies.
