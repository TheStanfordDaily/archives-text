## Right Wing Greed 
### 
Editor, THE I)A1I,Y,
The right wing is more
avaricious than 1 thought. They're
even going after the Stanford
student body funds.
Only two appointments were
made last spring to the Political
Union Board, the five-man

administrative board that must
approve every on-campus political
meeting. Both are Republicans,
and one was a Reagan-for-
President man. They're trying to
promulgate their own beliefs.
Their bias is evident in the
invitations they've issued to Barry
Goldwater, Russell Kirk and
William Buckley to speak on
"Politics in the Seventies." I
wonder how much of the $4000
or $13000 that will be approved
for their use they've already
committed to right-wing speakers.
I've been told that Joseph
Alioto and John Tunney have
been invited, but these men are
candidates for office in California
and don't expect payment for
appearing on the Stanford
campus. In any event, they aren't
representative of the Democratic
Party, let alone the American
Ijeft.
I think that Political Union
Board activity should stop until a
representative board is appointed
and that, once the new Senate is
elected, the present members
should be removed.
