## Vietnam Moratorium 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
A detailed blueprint for action
on Vietnam Moratorium Day is
emerging as Oct. 15 draws near.
Over 200 faculty members are
expected to come out in favor of
the Moratorium. Faculty support
will not necessarily include
dismissing classes. Each professor
supporting the Moratorium is
being asked to do whatever he
deems most appropriate.
Monday night, more than 75
students attended an
organizational meeting for the
Moratorium held in the ASSU
office. Leading the meeting were
Pat Shea, member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, and John
Kramer, acting chairman of the
Moratorium effort at Stanford.
Specific activities, such as
canvassing of residential areas,
received prime attention. Kramer
announced that the communities
to be canvassed—Palo Alto, Los
Altos, Menlo Park, Mountain
View, and Sunny vale—have been
divided into 41 specific areas.
The idea of personal contact
between students and the public
was especially emphasized by
both Shea and Kramer. Though
literature on the war will be
distributed to the public, Kramer
said, "there is a personal
legitimacy which the human voice
has and the written word does
not."
Participating dorms and
fraternities and groups of friends
will each have a separate area to
cover. Detailed maps are being
drawn up of each of the 41 areas
for use by the canvassing groups.
Specific shopping centers in
the area will be assigned to some
of the groups. On Oct. 15 The
Stanford Shopping Center and the
Town and Country Shopping
Center are almost certain to have
Stanford students conversing with
the public on the war.
Some groups of students will
be speaking with factory workers
as tbey leave work that day. Pat
Shea has received a list of major
industries in the area from the

Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce,
which will be used to make
assignments for groups wishing to
talk to factory workers.
In addition, the schedule for
the commuter trains is being
studied. Groups of students will
be exchanging ideas on the war
with the businessmen and workers
on their way to and from work.
Individuals wishing to sign up for
this or other activities may do so
at the booth in White Plaza,
Kramer noted.
Information sheets are being
printed up to brief students on
facts about the war that aren't
widely known.
Kramer claimed that the Nixon
Administration drafted 6,000
more men than usual each month
for the first six months of this
year in order to be able to lower

Information sheets are being

A detailed blueprint for action
on Vietnam Moratorium Day is
emerging as Oct. 15 draws near.
Over 200 faculty members are
expected to come out in favor of
the Moratorium. Faculty support
will not necessarily include
dismissing classes. Each professor
supporting the Moratorium is
being asked to do whatever he
deems most appropriate.
Monday night, more than 75
students attended an
organizational meeting for the
Moratorium held in the ASSU
office. Leading the meeting were
Pat Shea, member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, and John
Kramer, acting chairman of the
Moratorium effort at Stanford.
Specific activities, such as
canvassing of residential areas,
received prime attention. Kramer
announced that the communities
to be canvassed—Palo Alto, Los
Altos, Menlo Park, Mountain
View, and Sunny vale—have been
divided into 41 specific areas.
The idea of personal contact
between students and the public
was especially emphasized by
both Shea and Kramer. Though
literature on the war will be
distributed to the public, Kramer
said, "there is a personal
legitimacy which the human voice
has and the written word does
not."
Participating dorms and
fraternities and groups of friends
will each have a separate area to
cover. Detailed maps are being
drawn up of each of the 41 areas
for use by the canvassing groups.
Specific shopping centers in
the area will be assigned to some
of the groups. On Oct. 15 The
Stanford Shopping Center and the
Town and Country Shopping
Center are almost certain to have
Stanford students conversing with
the public on the war.
Some groups of students will
be speaking with factory workers
as tbey leave work that day. Pat
Shea has received a list of major
industries in the area from the

Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce,
which will be used to make
assignments for groups wishing to
talk to factory workers.
