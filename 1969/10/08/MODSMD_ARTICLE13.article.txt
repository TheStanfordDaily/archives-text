# October Plans Across Nation
## 
### 
Plans for the national
moratorium against the war in
Vietnam are progressing with
students at over 500 other
campuses across the country.
The emphasis nationally will be
on a student strike, and President
Nixon had indicated his
disapproval saying, "Under no
circumstances will I be affected
by it."
Next Wednesday's action is the
first of several planned. In
November, the strike will last two
days, followed by massive
demonstrations in Washington and
San Francisco.
David Hawk, one of the
national organizers and former
McCarthy aide, stated recently,
"The Administration seems to be
under the impression that
students are against the war
simply because they or their
friends are about to be drafted. In
fact, students oppose the war
because Americans and
Vietnamese are dying needlessly
and because the war is, in every
respect, a disaster for America."

draft calls at the end of this year
to appease students.
Shea noted that "we are going
to the public as evangelists of a
sort, convincing them to do
something tangible to protest the
war."
Also speaking at the meeting
were Professors Sanford
Dornbusch and Charles
Drekmeier. Professor Dornbusch
stressed the importance of having
a large turnout at the action
forum on the night of the 15th.
From 5,000 to 10,000 people are
expected to participate.
Dornbusch told the group that
while individuals may have a
difficult time protesting the war,
"collectively, there really is
something going on. You can feel
the change that has taken place in
the public in the last year. We can
win this war to end that war."
Drekmeier expressed the feeling
that "This is a chance to do in
breadth what some of you in the
past have tried to do in depth."
Kramer emphasized the letter
writing aspect of the movement.
He said he hoped everyone would
write to their parents,
congressmen, the president, and
the National Moratorium
Committee, supporting the
Moratorium and condemning the
war.
