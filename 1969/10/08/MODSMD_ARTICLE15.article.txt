# Talks Planned On Overseas Centers
## 
### 
Next week, October 12-16, the
Overseas Campus Board will
sponsor a series of informal
meetings on each of Stanford's
five Overseas Campuses. Faculty
and students who have studied at
the various centers will present
freshmen and other interested
undergraduates an informative
program of slide shows and
discussion on each campus.
Sunday evening at 8:30 in the
Tresidder Large Lounge, former
students of Stanford-in-Austria
will discuss the campus in Vienna.
Moved to Vienna in September,
1967, the campus is centrally
located in the beautifully baroque
capital of the former Habsburg
empire. Of special value is the
center's proximity to the Iron
Curtain.
Monday evening people from
the campus at Cliveden House will
acquaint students with
Stanford-in-England. The campus
was moved last spring to Cliveden
House, formerly the famed Astor
family mansion. The center offers
easy access to Oxford and
London, as well as a beautiful
setting in 400 acres of wooded
landscape.
Tuesday night will be devoted
to the French campus, located at
Tours, southwest of Paris on the
banks of the Loire River. The
city, a center of agriculture,
winemaking, and the silk industry,

is situated in the midst of the
chateaux country.
Due to the Viet Nam
Moratorium Wednesday evening,
students from Stanford-in-
Germany will hold their meeting
that afternoon at 4:15. Students
will be acquainted with the
center, which is located at
Landgut Burg atop a hill above
the village of Beutelsbach near
Stuttgart. The campus offers
beautifully unique rural setting
and much contact with local
families.
The last program, devoted to
Stanford-in-Italy, will be held
Thursday evening at 8:30 in the
Branner dining room. The
Florence campus offers easy
access to such well known cultural
treasures as the Duomo, the Uffizi
Gallery, and the Bargello Museum,
in addition to its setting close to
the rolling hills of Tuscany.
Members of the Overseas
Campus Board, an independent
committee of former Overseas
students, and George R. Hamrdla,
Assistant to the Director of
Overseas Campuses, will hold a

Due to the Viet Nam
Moratorium Wednesday evening,
students from Stanford-in-
Germany will hold their meeting
that afternoon at 4:15. Students
will be acquainted with the
center, which is located at
Landgut Burg atop a hill above
the village of Beutelsbach near
Stuttgart. The campus offers
beautifully unique rural setting
and much contact with local
families.
The last program, devoted to
Stanford-in-Italy, will be held
Thursday evening at 8:30 in the
Branner dining room. The
Florence campus offers easy
access to such well known cultural
treasures as the Duomo, the Uffizi
Gallery, and the Bargello Museum,
in addition to its setting close to
the rolling hills of Tuscany.
Members of the Overseas
Campus Board, an independent
committee of former Overseas
students, and George R. Hamrdla,
Assistant to the Director of
Overseas Campuses, will hold a
general meeting tonight at 8:30 in
the Branner dining room to
acquaint students with the
overseas program.
Next week, October 12-16, the
Overseas Campus Board will
sponsor a series of informal
meetings on each of Stanford's
five Overseas Campuses. Faculty
and students who have studied at
the various centers will present
freshmen and other interested
undergraduates an informative
program of slide shows and
discussion on each campus.
Sunday evening at 8:30 in the
Tresidder Large Lounge, former
students of Stanford-in-Austria
will discuss the campus in Vienna.
Moved to Vienna in September,
1967, the campus is centrally
located in the beautifully baroque
capital of the former Habsburg
empire. Of special value is the
center's proximity to the Iron
Curtain.
Monday evening people from
the campus at Cliveden House will
acquaint students with
Stanford-in-England. The campus
was moved last spring to Cliveden
House, formerly the famed Astor
family mansion. The center offers
easy access to Oxford and
London, as well as a beautiful
setting in 400 acres of wooded
landscape.
Tuesday night will be devoted
to the French campus, located at
Tours, southwest of Paris on the
banks of the Loire River. The
city, a center of agriculture,
winemaking, and the silk industry,

is situated in the midst of the
chateaux country.
