### 
Continuing a popular tradition,
KZSU will again broadcast an
outstanding class of general
interest during this Fall Quarter.
The selection of Philosophy 179,
"The Philosophy of Law," taught
by Dr. Philip Rhinelander, Prof,
of Philosophy and former Dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, is based on the relevance
of the class material to the
Stanford community and the
excellent qualifications of the
instructor.
The course will attempt to
integrate important historical
materials with the major problems
of today—concerning itself
primarily with three general
topics: (1) the nature and
function of law, (2) the relation
between law and morality, and (3)
problems of judicial reasoning and
judicial decision.
"These general topics will be
considered with particular
reference to three areas of special
current concern: civil
disobedience, legal regulation of
private conduct, and punishment
and responsibility," reports Prof.
Rhinelander.
KZSU will broadcast the class
at 7 PM every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday for the
duration of the quarter. KZSU
broadcasts at 90.1 FM, 880 AM in
dorms.

bicentennial celebration oi
Ludwig van Beethoven's birth;
and the Stanford music
organizations, in conjunction with

University Chorus under the
direction of Sandor Salgo will

Beethoven's more difficult works;
its performance, however, is one
of his best.
This year marks the retirement
of Maestro Josef Krips, who for
many years has dominated the
direction of the S.F. Orchestra.
The Beethoven Celebration, in
which Stanford is privileged to
take part, will prove to be a
lasting monument to his inspired
career.
A month before their "Missa
Solemnis," the University Chor'

will present its Fall Concert on
Dec. 7 under the direr' ; on of
Professor Harold Schmidt.
Included will be Beethoven's
"Contata on the Death of
Emperor Joseph II" and by
popular demand, Carl Orff's
"Carmina Burana."
"This is the biggest year of the
University's music groups," was
Professor Schmidt's description of
the coming events. Schmidt, who
works diligently each year with
the Chorus and Chorale as
director, reminds interested
students that there are still
openings available in the two
organizations.

Solemnis," the University Chor'

will present its Fall Concert on
Dec. 7 under the direr' ; on of
Professor Harold Schmidt.
Included will be Beethoven's
"Contata on the Death of
Emperor Joseph II" and by
popular demand, Carl Orff's
"Carmina Burana."
"This is the biggest year of the
University's music groups," was
Professor Schmidt's description of
the coming events. Schmidt, who
works diligently each year with
the Chorus and Chorale as
director, reminds interested
students that there are still
openings available in the two
organizations.
Continuing a popular tradition,
KZSU will again broadcast an
outstanding class of general
interest during this Fall Quarter.
The selection of Philosophy 179,
"The Philosophy of Law," taught
by Dr. Philip Rhinelander, Prof,
of Philosophy and former Dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, is based on the relevance
of the class material to the
Stanford community and the
excellent qualifications of the
instructor.
The course will attempt to
integrate important historical
materials with the major problems
of today—concerning itself
primarily with three general
topics: (1) the nature and
function of law, (2) the relation
between law and morality, and (3)
problems of judicial reasoning and
judicial decision.
"These general topics will be
considered with particular
reference to three areas of special
current concern: civil
disobedience, legal regulation of
private conduct, and punishment
and responsibility," reports Prof.
Rhinelander.
KZSU will broadcast the class
at 7 PM every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday for the
duration of the quarter. KZSU
broadcasts at 90.1 FM, 880 AM in
dorms.

bicentennial celebration oi
Ludwig van Beethoven's birth;

The San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra conducted by Seiji
Ozawa and the Stanford
University Chorus under the
direction of Sandor Salgo will
present on Jan. 7, 8, and 9
Beethoven's "Missa Solemnis."
Missa Solemnis, written but a few
years before his death, is one of
Beethoven's more difficult works;
its performance, however, is one
of his best.
This year marks the retirement

many years has dominated the
direction of the S.F. Orchestra.
The Beethoven Celebration, in
which Stanford is privileged to
take part, will prove to be a
lasting monument to his inspired
career.
A month before their "Missa
Solemnis," the University Chor'

will present its Fall Concert on
Dec. 7 under the direr' ; on of
