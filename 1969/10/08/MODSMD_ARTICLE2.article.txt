# Chaos Reigns In Montreal
## 
### 
MONTREAL (AP)-Feuding
taxi drivers waged war with stones
and rifles, fires blazed and the
Canadian army was called in to
protect Canada's largest city after
Montreal's 6,000 police and
firemen struck for more pay. A
provincial policeman was shot
dead.
Quebec provincial police
reported the death of one of their
men, another unconfirmed death,
and several wounded in shooting
at a West End garage.
The garage was the scene of a
battle between taxi drivers,
random passersby and employees
of a competitive airport limousine
service.
Several fires were started, buses
were overturned and snipers fired
into the rioting crowds.

Berkeley
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-A
federal court has upheld the right
of the University of California to
discipline a student the university
accused of encouraging the
People's Park riot in Berkeley last
May.
Dan Siegel, by being placed on
disciplinary probation, was kept
from taking office as student
body president at UC Berkeley.
The action came after the
institution decided that Siegel's
exhortations to a crowd of 2,000
spurred a riotous confrontation in
which a non-student was killed.
Siegel, a third year law student,
appealed to U.S. District Court,
but Jedge William T. Sweigert
ruled Monday that Siegel didn't
have a case.

Siegel, charging he was denied
due process and free speech, had
asked the judge for a preliminary
injunction. In response, UC
lawyers asked for a dismissal.
"The record," said Sweigert,
"does not present even a prima
facie showing that plaintiff has
been deprived of any
constitutional right . . .just how
much more due process could
have been accorded the plaintiff is
hard to imagine."
Siegel had been placed on
probation by Chancellor Roger
Heyns after a hearing by the
student-faculty committee on
student conduct.
The People's Park riot involved
a university-owned plot of ground
near the campus which Berkeley's
so-called "street people" had
appropriated as a park.
Hayns worth
WASHINGTON (AP>-Sen.
Birch Bayh, D-Ind., said Tuesday
Judge Clement F. Haynsworth Jr.
held 300 shares of stock in W.R.
Grace Co. at the time he ruled in a
case involving the firm.
Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,
one of the leading backers of
Haynsworth's nomination to the
Supreme Court, confirmed the
holdings but dismissed them as
insignificant.
Hollings said the ruling was in a
personal injury case brought
against a Grace shipping
subsidiary, Grace Lines, and he
said the decision involved only
$50.
He said that under the U.S.
Code a judge had to disqualify
himself only when "in his
opinion" his interest is
"substantial."
Hollings, in both a Senate
speech and in an hour-long news
conference called to defend
Haynsworth against a broad range
of criticism, said this clearly was
not the case.
"It's 300 shares out of 18 or
19 million,"he said.
Hollings said that rulings by
California courts had established a

precedent that judges need only
disqualify themselves when they
have a direct interest in a
company and not merely an
interest in a parent holding
company.
The committee already has
postponed a vote on the
nomination one week, but it was
uncertain what might happen
Wednesday.
Intercept
WASHINGTON (AP)-U.S.
officials are pleased with the
results of Operation Intercept and
say the anti-drug campaign along
the Mexican border will continue
indefinitely.
The U.S. commitment to the
program is expected to produce at
least some unpleasantness when
officials from the two nations
renew talks here Wednesday on
the subject.
Since the program started Sept.
21, U.S. officials report marijuana
supplies from Mexico have
virtually disappeared from every
major American city they have
checked.
"We're thrilled with the
results," said one U.S. source
close to the program. "We plan to
continue the program
indefinitely."
U.S. officials say that 54
arrests have been made and that
marijuana seizures ranging from
two ounces to 1,000 pounds have
been registered. They conclude
that the operation has been so
successful that pot users in the
United States have had to resort
to the less potent grass grown in
the American Midwest.
U.S. Officials say all but two of
the arrests have been made during
checks at 31 entry points along
the 2,000-mile long border. The
others were smugglers who
operated by plane and boat.

Intercept
WASHINGTON (AP)-U.S.
officials are pleased with the
results of Operation Intercept and
say the anti-drug campaign along
the Mexican border will continue
indefinitely.
The U.S. commitment to the
program is expected to produce at
least some unpleasantness when
officials from the two nations
renew talks here Wednesday on
the subject.
Since the program started Sept.
21, U.S. officials report marijuana
supplies from Mexico have
virtually disappeared from every
major American city they have
checked.
"We're thrilled with the
results," said one U.S. source
close to the program. "We plan to
continue the program
indefinitely."
U.S. officials say that 54
arrests have been made and that
marijuana seizures ranging from
two ounces to 1,000 pounds have
been registered. They conclude
that the operation has been so
successful that pot users in the
United States have had to resort
to the less potent grass grown in
the American Midwest.
U.S. Officials say all but two of
the arrests have been made during
checks at 31 entry points along
the 2,000-mile long border. The
others were smugglers who
operated by plane and boat.
MONTREAL (AP)-Feuding
taxi drivers waged war with stones

provincial policeman was shot
dead.
Quebec provincial police
reported the death of one of their
men, another unconfirmed death,

The garage was the scene of a

service.
Several fires were started, buses

Berkeley
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-A
federal court has upheld the right
of the University of California to
discipline a student the university
accused of encouraging the
People's Park riot in Berkeley last
May.
Dan Siegel, by being placed on
disciplinary probation, was kept
from taking office as student
body president at UC Berkeley.
The action came after the
institution decided that Siegel's
exhortations to a crowd of 2,000
spurred a riotous confrontation in
which a non-student was killed.
Siegel, a third year law student,
appealed to U.S. District Court,
but Jedge William T. Sweigert
ruled Monday that Siegel didn't
have a case.

Siegel, charging he was denied
due process and free speech, had
asked the judge for a preliminary
injunction. In response, UC
lawyers asked for a dismissal.
"The record," said Sweigert,
"does not present even a prima
facie showing that plaintiff has
been deprived of any
constitutional right . . .just how
much more due process could
have been accorded the plaintiff is
hard to imagine."
Siegel had been placed on
probation by Chancellor Roger
Heyns after a hearing by the
student-faculty committee on
student conduct.
The People's Park riot involved
a university-owned plot of ground
near the campus which Berkeley's
so-called "street people" had
appropriated as a park.
Hayns worth
WASHINGTON (AP>-Sen.
Birch Bayh, D-Ind., said Tuesday
Judge Clement F. Haynsworth Jr.
held 300 shares of stock in W.R.
Grace Co. at the time he ruled in a
case involving the firm.
Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,
one of the leading backers of
Haynsworth's nomination to the
Supreme Court, confirmed the
holdings but dismissed them as
insignificant.
Hollings said the ruling was in a
personal injury case brought
against a Grace shipping
subsidiary, Grace Lines, and he
said the decision involved only
$50.
He said that under the U.S.
Code a judge had to disqualify
himself only when "in his
opinion" his interest is
"substantial."
Hollings, in both a Senate
speech and in an hour-long news
conference called to defend
Haynsworth against a broad range
of criticism, said this clearly was
not the case.
"It's 300 shares out of 18 or
19 million,"he said.
Hollings said that rulings by
California courts had established a

precedent that judges need only
disqualify themselves when they
have a direct interest in a
company and not merely an
interest in a parent holding
company.

Hayns worth
WASHINGTON (AP>-Sen.
Birch Bayh, D-Ind., said Tuesday
Judge Clement F. Haynsworth Jr.
held 300 shares of stock in W.R.
Grace Co. at the time he ruled in a
case involving the firm.
Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,
one of the leading backers of
Haynsworth's nomination to the
Supreme Court, confirmed the
holdings but dismissed them as
insignificant.
Hollings said the ruling was in a
personal injury case brought
against a Grace shipping
subsidiary, Grace Lines, and he
said the decision involved only
$50.
He said that under the U.S.
Code a judge had to disqualify
himself only when "in his
opinion" his interest is
"substantial."
Hollings, in both a Senate
speech and in an hour-long news
conference called to defend
Haynsworth against a broad range
of criticism, said this clearly was
not the case.
"It's 300 shares out of 18 or
19 million,"he said.
Hollings said that rulings by
California courts had established a

precedent that judges need only
disqualify themselves when they
have a direct interest in a
company and not merely an
interest in a parent holding
company.
The committee already has
postponed a vote on the
nomination one week, but it was
uncertain what might happen
Wednesday.
Intercept
WASHINGTON (AP)-U.S.
officials are pleased with the
results of Operation Intercept and
say the anti-drug campaign along
the Mexican border will continue
indefinitely.
The U.S. commitment to the
program is expected to produce at
least some unpleasantness when
officials from the two nations
renew talks here Wednesday on
the subject.
Since the program started Sept.
21, U.S. officials report marijuana
supplies from Mexico have
virtually disappeared from every
major American city they have
checked.
"We're thrilled with the
results," said one U.S. source
close to the program. "We plan to
continue the program
indefinitely."
U.S. officials say that 54
arrests have been made and that
marijuana seizures ranging from
two ounces to 1,000 pounds have
been registered. They conclude
that the operation has been so
successful that pot users in the
United States have had to resort
to the less potent grass grown in
the American Midwest.
U.S. Officials say all but two of
the arrests have been made during
checks at 31 entry points along
the 2,000-mile long border. The
others were smugglers who
operated by plane and boat.
MONTREAL (AP)-Feuding
taxi drivers waged war with stones
and rifles, fires blazed and the
Canadian army was called in to
protect Canada's largest city after
Montreal's 6,000 police and
firemen struck for more pay. A
provincial policeman was shot
dead.
Quebec provincial police
reported the death of one of their
men, another unconfirmed death,
and several wounded in shooting
at a West End garage.
The garage was the scene of a
battle between taxi drivers,
random passersby and employees
of a competitive airport limousine
service.
Several fires were started, buses
were overturned and snipers fired
into the rioting crowds.

Berkeley
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-A
federal court has upheld the right
of the University of California to
discipline a student the university
accused of encouraging the
People's Park riot in Berkeley last
May.
Dan Siegel, by being placed on
disciplinary probation, was kept
from taking office as student
body president at UC Berkeley.
The action came after the
institution decided that Siegel's
exhortations to a crowd of 2,000
spurred a riotous confrontation in
which a non-student was killed.
Siegel, a third year law student,
appealed to U.S. District Court,
but Jedge William T. Sweigert
ruled Monday that Siegel didn't
have a case.

Siegel, charging he was denied
due process and free speech, had
asked the judge for a preliminary
injunction. In response, UC
lawyers asked for a dismissal.
"The record," said Sweigert,
"does not present even a prima
facie showing that plaintiff has
been deprived of any
constitutional right . . .just how
much more due process could
have been accorded the plaintiff is
hard to imagine."
Siegel had been placed on
probation by Chancellor Roger
Heyns after a hearing by the
student-faculty committee on
student conduct.
The People's Park riot involved
a university-owned plot of ground
near the campus which Berkeley's
so-called "street people" had
appropriated as a park.
