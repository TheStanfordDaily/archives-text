# CAC Asks Support On Viet Referendum
## 
### 
The Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC) is distributing
a petition proposing that a
referendum on the war in
Vietnam be placed on the ballot
in the forthcoming ASSU
election.
The referendum will ask
students to rank eight possible
courses of action in order of their
acceptability. The choices range
from "an immediate cease-fire and
rapid withdrawal" to an all out
"military win policy".
CAC president Jim Schneider
said the referendum "will provide
the student body with the means
of expressing their opinions on
the war. The referendum gives a
broad range of positions for
students to accept or reject, and
has received support from a broad
spectrum of political
organizations."

Schneider said the results of
the referendum will be sent to
President Nixon.
CAC needs 650 signatures to
place the item on the ballot, and
Schneider anticipates this figure
will be reached.
Schneider termed the
referendum an "objective way of
expressing the will of the students
at Stanford, and will be valuablee
for those of all persuasions." He
added that it will also provide
President Nixon with an
expression of public view that
cannot be dismissed as
representing a small segment of
the student population.
The deadline for submitting
completed petitions for candidacy
in the ASSU student senate
elections is 5:00 P.M., Thursday,
October 9.
