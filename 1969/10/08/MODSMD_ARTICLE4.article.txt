# University, Military Seeking Acceptable ROTC Programs
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The status of Stanford ROTC
is still the subject of negotiations
between University officials and
the Defense Department,
according to Vice-Provost E.
Howard Brooks.
The armed forces and Stanford
are trying to devise an ROTC
program within the framework of
the ROTC decision of the
Academic Senate last spring. The
Senate voted to deny credit to
ROTC courses, remove academic
standing from the instructors,
remove department status, and
urged changes in the contracts of
ROTC students.
Dr. Brooks evaluated progress
this way: "Negotiations with the
Army are quite advanced. We are
very hopeful that a new, flexible
program can be announced this
fall. The others (Navy and Air
Force) are not as advanced, but
we hope to have a resolution by
the end of t!ie fall quarter."

There are indications that the
primary difficulty appears to be
with the Navy ROTC. Dr. Brooks
has still not received a formal
reply, although he is expecting
one iu.rrediately, to a letter he
sent u* the Navy last spring
explaining tae changes that would
be required in ROTC. The Air
Force has made a preliminary
reply.
The Army and Air Force have
made more substantial changes in
their programs this year than the
Navy and a Defense Department
report has indicated the
importance of credit for Navy
ROTC courses.
The Navy uses its courses more
for a professional and
occupational training than the
other armed services. Graduates
from Navy ROTC are immediately
given a regular military
assignment. Air Force and Army
graduates attend a school for
three months of technical training
before they receive their first
assignments.
Navy Withdraws ROTC
The Navy has already
announced a phased withdrawal
of the NROTC program from
Brown, Columbia, Dartmouth,
and Harvard because these
colleges ahd "indicated their
intention to change the status of
NROTC on their campuses,"
according to a release from the
Department of the Navy.
Dartmouth and Brown both
greatly restricted the amount
ofcredit that would be given to
Navy ROTC courses. A Navy
newspaper, The Navy Times, also
mistakenly listed Stanford
University as one of the colleges
and universities where Navy
ROTC would be phased out.
This all leads to speculation
that unless credit is given to some
Navy ROTC courses by some
method, the Navy probably will
decide to phase out Navy ROTC
at Stanford.

Last spring the Senate askeo
President Kenneth Pitzer to work
out the details of a new ROTC
program. Dr. Brooks is doing most
of the work and will be aided by a
committee composed of students
and faculty members and chaired
by Alan Manne, professor of
operations research. According to
Prof. Manne, the committee "will
provide the President and his
negotiator with a general
University background" to the
types of programs that are being
considered. It will furnish a
"diversity of viewpoints."
Speaking about hwat
discussions he has had so far, Prof.
Manne continued, "The military
don't seem to think that we're
serious about denying credit. I
think we've arrived at a policy
that we can live with."
ROTC Enrollment Drops
Drops in enrollment in the four
year progran: of each ROTC at
Stanford has been r -ported: from
43 last year to 29 this year in the
Navy; from 20 to 5 for the Air
Force in the same years; and from
39 twoyears ago to 18 last year to
8 this fall in the Army program.
This was attributed to the
anti-ROTC feeling on this campus
and across the nation, the general
questioning of the military in the
country today, and the changes
that are taking place in the draft
laws—the initiation of a lottery
and the possibility of an all
volunteer army.
Experimental programs are
being tried in both Army and Air
Force ROTC. Air Force ROTC
now requires only three courses
taught by military instructors;
other courses required are regular
University courses. The Army has
changed completely its first two
years—emphasizing world military
history and the foundations of
national policy. Emphasis is still
on professional subjects in the
junior and senior years.

All services have reduced their
regular drill time. Colonel Stanley
M. Ramey, professor of Military
Science, stated that the Army will
probably only have drill one hour
a month compared to four hours
in previous years. A three hour
session of "practical exercises"
will substitute for the drill.
ROTC Reorganisation
Colonel Ramey indicated that
he has been given much freedom
to work out an ROTC program
satisfactory to both the Army and
the Stanford faculty. "The Army
has indicated that it wishes to stay
at Stanford provided a reasonably
viable program can be worked
out . . .We are shooting for
courses being taught by military
officers to be reviewed as any
other course.
"If it [an ROTC course]
passes, it would get credit. No
credit would be given until the
ROTC is able to prove that the
courses deserve it. It would put
the burden on the Army."
The Navy has changed its
orientation course to a leadership
course and is allowing students to
use a University history course to
fulfill its military history course
requirements.
Colonel Robert L. Thomas,
professor of Naval Science, was
very reluctant to discuss the
present negotiations for fear that
premature publicity would only
hurt the possibility of an
acceptable program being worked
out. He stated, "Negotiations have
been continuing during the
summer. Nothing final has been
decided."
Captain Thomas J. Bagley,
assistant professor of Aerospace
Studies, indicated that the Air
Force could not completely
substitute University courses for
all ROTC courses because the unit
load would be too great. Speaking
for himself, Captain Bagley
declared, "I think that ROTC
deserves credit."

program. Dr. Brooks is doing most
of the work and will be aided by a
committee composed of students
and faculty members and chaired
by Alan Manne, professor of
operations research. According to
Prof. Manne, the committee "will
provide the President and his
negotiator with a general
University background" to the
types of programs that are being
considered. It will furnish a
"diversity of viewpoints."
Speaking about hwat
discussions he has had so far, Prof.
Manne continued, "The military
don't seem to think that we're
serious about denying credit. I
think we've arrived at a policy
that we can live with."
ROTC Enrollment Drops
Drops in enrollment in the four
year progran: of each ROTC at
Stanford has been r -ported: from
43 last year to 29 this year in the
Navy; from 20 to 5 for the Air
Force in the same years; and from
39 twoyears ago to 18 last year to
8 this fall in the Army program.
This was attributed to the
anti-ROTC feeling on this campus
and across the nation, the general
questioning of the military in the
country today, and the changes
that are taking place in the draft
laws—the initiation of a lottery
and the possibility of an all
volunteer army.
Experimental programs are
being tried in both Army and Air
Force ROTC. Air Force ROTC
now requires only three courses
taught by military instructors;
other courses required are regular
University courses. The Army has
changed completely its first two
years—emphasizing world military
history and the foundations of
national policy. Emphasis is still
on professional subjects in the
junior and senior years.

All services have reduced their
regular drill time. Colonel Stanley
M. Ramey, professor of Military
Science, stated that the Army will
probably only have drill one hour
a month compared to four hours
in previous years. A three hour
session of "practical exercises"
will substitute for the drill.
ROTC Reorganisation
Colonel Ramey indicated that
he has been given much freedom
to work out an ROTC program
satisfactory to both the Army and
the Stanford faculty. "The Army
has indicated that it wishes to stay
at Stanford provided a reasonably
viable program can be worked
out . . .We are shooting for
courses being taught by military
officers to be reviewed as any
other course.
"If it [an ROTC course]
passes, it would get credit. No
credit would be given until the
ROTC is able to prove that the
courses deserve it. It would put
the burden on the Army."
The Navy has changed its
orientation course to a leadership
course and is allowing students to
use a University history course to
fulfill its military history course
requirements.
Colonel Robert L. Thomas,
professor of Naval Science, was
very reluctant to discuss the
present negotiations for fear that
premature publicity would only
hurt the possibility of an
acceptable program being worked
out. He stated, "Negotiations have
been continuing during the
summer. Nothing final has been
decided."
Captain Thomas J. Bagley,
assistant professor of Aerospace
Studies, indicated that the Air
Force could not completely
substitute University courses for
all ROTC courses because the unit
load would be too great. Speaking
for himself, Captain Bagley
declared, "I think that ROTC
deserves credit."
The status of Stanford ROTC
is still the subject of negotiations
between University officials and
the Defense Department,
according to Vice-Provost E.
Howard Brooks.
The armed forces and Stanford
are trying to devise an ROTC
program within the framework of
the ROTC decision of the
Academic Senate last spring. The
Senate voted to deny credit to
ROTC courses, remove academic
standing from the instructors,
remove department status, and
urged changes in the contracts of
ROTC students.
Dr. Brooks evaluated progress
this way: "Negotiations with the
Army are quite advanced. We are
very hopeful that a new, flexible
program can be announced this
fall. The others (Navy and Air
Force) are not as advanced, but
we hope to have a resolution by
the end of t!ie fall quarter."

There are indications that the
primary difficulty appears to be
with the Navy ROTC. Dr. Brooks
has still not received a formal
reply, although he is expecting
one iu.rrediately, to a letter he
sent u* the Navy last spring
explaining tae changes that would
be required in ROTC. The Air
Force has made a preliminary
reply.
The Army and Air Force have
made more substantial changes in
their programs this year than the
Navy and a Defense Department
report has indicated the
importance of credit for Navy
ROTC courses.
The Navy uses its courses more
for a professional and
occupational training than the
other armed services. Graduates
from Navy ROTC are immediately
given a regular military
assignment. Air Force and Army
graduates attend a school for
three months of technical training
before they receive their first
assignments.
Navy Withdraws ROTC
The Navy has already
announced a phased withdrawal
of the NROTC program from
Brown, Columbia, Dartmouth,
and Harvard because these
colleges ahd "indicated their
intention to change the status of
NROTC on their campuses,"
according to a release from the
Department of the Navy.
Dartmouth and Brown both
greatly restricted the amount
ofcredit that would be given to
Navy ROTC courses. A Navy
newspaper, The Navy Times, also
mistakenly listed Stanford
University as one of the colleges
and universities where Navy
ROTC would be phased out.
This all leads to speculation
that unless credit is given to some
Navy ROTC courses by some
method, the Navy probably will
decide to phase out Navy ROTC
at Stanford.

courses deserve it. It would put
the burden on the Army."
The Navy has changed its
orientation course to a leadership
course and is allowing students to
use a University history course to
fulfill its military history course
requirements.
Colonel Robert L. Thomas,
professor of Naval Science, was
very reluctant to discuss the
present negotiations for fear that
premature publicity would only
hurt the possibility of an
acceptable program being worked
out. He stated, "Negotiations have
been continuing during the
summer. Nothing final has been
decided."
Captain Thomas J. Bagley,
assistant professor of Aerospace
Studies, indicated that the Air
Force could not completely
substitute University courses for
all ROTC courses because the unit
load would be too great. Speaking
for himself, Captain Bagley
declared, "I think that ROTC
deserves credit."
The status of Stanford ROTC
is still the subject of negotiations
between University officials and
the Defense Department,
according to Vice-Provost E.
Howard Brooks.
The armed forces and Stanford
are trying to devise an ROTC
program within the framework of
the ROTC decision of the
Academic Senate last spring. The
Senate voted to deny credit to
ROTC courses, remove academic
standing from the instructors,
remove department status, and
urged changes in the contracts of
ROTC students.
Dr. Brooks evaluated progress
this way: "Negotiations with the
Army are quite advanced. We are
very hopeful that a new, flexible
program can be announced this
fall. The others (Navy and Air
Force) are not as advanced, but
we hope to have a resolution by
the end of t!ie fall quarter."

There are indications that the
primary difficulty appears to be
with the Navy ROTC. Dr. Brooks
has still not received a formal
reply, although he is expecting
one iu.rrediately, to a letter he
sent u* the Navy last spring
explaining tae changes that would
be required in ROTC. The Air
Force has made a preliminary
reply.
The Army and Air Force have
made more substantial changes in
their programs this year than the
Navy and a Defense Department
report has indicated the
importance of credit for Navy
ROTC courses.
The Navy uses its courses more
for a professional and
occupational training than the
other armed services. Graduates
from Navy ROTC are immediately
given a regular military
assignment. Air Force and Army
graduates attend a school for
three months of technical training
before they receive their first
assignments.
Navy Withdraws ROTC
The Navy has already
announced a phased withdrawal
of the NROTC program from
Brown, Columbia, Dartmouth,
and Harvard because these
colleges ahd "indicated their
intention to change the status of
NROTC on their campuses,"
according to a release from the
Department of the Navy.
Dartmouth and Brown both
greatly restricted the amount
ofcredit that would be given to
Navy ROTC courses. A Navy
newspaper, The Navy Times, also
mistakenly listed Stanford
University as one of the colleges
and universities where Navy
ROTC would be phased out.
This all leads to speculation
that unless credit is given to some
Navy ROTC courses by some
method, the Navy probably will
decide to phase out Navy ROTC
at Stanford.

Last spring the Senate askeo
President Kenneth Pitzer to work
out the details of a new ROTC
program. Dr. Brooks is doing most
of the work and will be aided by a
committee composed of students
and faculty members and chaired
by Alan Manne, professor of
operations research. According to
Prof. Manne, the committee "will
provide the President and his
negotiator with a general
University background" to the
types of programs that are being
considered. It will furnish a
"diversity of viewpoints."
Speaking about hwat
discussions he has had so far, Prof.
Manne continued, "The military
don't seem to think that we're
serious about denying credit. I
think we've arrived at a policy
that we can live with."
ROTC Enrollment Drops
Drops in enrollment in the four
year progran: of each ROTC at
Stanford has been r -ported: from
43 last year to 29 this year in the
Navy; from 20 to 5 for the Air
Force in the same years; and from
39 twoyears ago to 18 last year to
8 this fall in the Army program.
This was attributed to the
anti-ROTC feeling on this campus
and across the nation, the general
questioning of the military in the
country today, and the changes
that are taking place in the draft
laws—the initiation of a lottery
and the possibility of an all
volunteer army.
Experimental programs are
being tried in both Army and Air
Force ROTC. Air Force ROTC
now requires only three courses
taught by military instructors;
other courses required are regular
University courses. The Army has
changed completely its first two
years—emphasizing world military
history and the foundations of
national policy. Emphasis is still
on professional subjects in the
junior and senior years.

All services have reduced their
regular drill time. Colonel Stanley
M. Ramey, professor of Military
Science, stated that the Army will
probably only have drill one hour
a month compared to four hours
in previous years. A three hour
session of "practical exercises"
will substitute for the drill.
ROTC Reorganisation
Colonel Ramey indicated that
he has been given much freedom
to work out an ROTC program
satisfactory to both the Army and
the Stanford faculty. "The Army
has indicated that it wishes to stay
at Stanford provided a reasonably
viable program can be worked
out . . .We are shooting for
courses being taught by military
officers to be reviewed as any
other course.
"If it [an ROTC course]
passes, it would get credit. No
credit would be given until the
ROTC is able to prove that the
courses deserve it. It would put
the burden on the Army."
The Navy has changed its
orientation course to a leadership
course and is allowing students to
