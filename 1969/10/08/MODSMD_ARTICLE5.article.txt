# Student Admissions Program In Bureaucratic Nether World
## 
### BRIAN ATWATER 
A student-to-student program
designed to give prospective
freshmen a better idea of what to
expect at Stanford is being "held
in limbo," according to Douglas
Walker, Dean of Freshman
Admissions.
Student volunteers will
probably visit high schools in
December rather than early in the
fall, as was originally scheduled.
The program had been staffed
by 82 unscreened undergraduates,
but 15 of them resigned over the
summer. The program had hoped
to communicate with secondary
school students rather than to
evaluate them or recruit them.
Given Guidelines
Each volunteer was given
guidelines for discussion of such
subjects as admissions policies and
tuition, and each was urged to
freely describe his own
impressions of student life at
Stanford.
Walker blamed staff turnover
and overwhelming paperwork for
the delay in instrumenting the
program. Steve Hoglund, an

assistant director of freshman
admissions who was to have
coordinated the program, left the
admissions office in late August.
Since over 500 high schools
were to be contacted and then
visited before a planned deadline
on September 28, Walker decided
to table the idea until a
mid-November meeting could
re-examine it.
Secondary schools across the
country wouldhave been involved.
Volunteers had planned to visit
seven schools near their homes,
including their alma mater.
Three Went Ahead
Three students went ahead
with the program despite its
postponement and reported they
met with moderate success.
Walker commented that he had
found such student programs very
successful in the past few years,
though they have been on a much
smaller scale.
Stanford students in such a
program can apparently offset the
discouraging remarks of alumni
which influence high school
students in their choice of college.

The alumni, added Walker, "can
destroy in 20 minutes what it has
taken us 20 years to build" when
they describe Stanford adversely
to applicants.
Once the program is actually
under way, it will mark the first
time students have been involved
in the admissions process of a
wide range of the freshman
applicants. Both the Black
Students' Union and the
Mexican-American students'
group have been involved in the
recruitment of potential Stanford
freshmen in the last couple years,
with considerable success.

The program had been staffed
by 82 unscreened undergraduates,
but 15 of them resigned over the
summer. The program had hoped
to communicate with secondary
school students rather than to
evaluate them or recruit them.
Given Guidelines
Each volunteer was given
guidelines for discussion of such
subjects as admissions policies and
tuition, and each was urged to
freely describe his own
impressions of student life at
Stanford.
Walker blamed staff turnover
and overwhelming paperwork for
the delay in instrumenting the
program. Steve Hoglund, an

assistant director of freshman
admissions who was to have
coordinated the program, left the
admissions office in late August.
Since over 500 high schools
were to be contacted and then
visited before a planned deadline
on September 28, Walker decided
to table the idea until a
mid-November meeting could
re-examine it.
Secondary schools across the
country wouldhave been involved.
Volunteers had planned to visit
seven schools near their homes,
including their alma mater.
Three Went Ahead
Three students went ahead
with the program despite its
postponement and reported they
met with moderate success.
Walker commented that he had
found such student programs very
successful in the past few years,
though they have been on a much
smaller scale.
Stanford students in such a
program can apparently offset the
discouraging remarks of alumni
which influence high school
students in their choice of college.

The alumni, added Walker, "can
destroy in 20 minutes what it has
taken us 20 years to build" when
they describe Stanford adversely
to applicants.
Once the program is actually
under way, it will mark the first
time students have been involved
in the admissions process of a
wide range of the freshman
applicants. Both the Black
Students' Union and the
Mexican-American students'
group have been involved in the
recruitment of potential Stanford
freshmen in the last couple years,
with considerable success.
