# Peace, Mental Health Concerns Of Nobel Laureate
## 
### BOB MICHELET 
Tucked away in the corner of a chemistry
building is the office of one of Stanford's 175
new faculty members.
It is an office cluttered with boxes, with a
chalkboard of sketches of the atom and shelves
jammed with books, papers and plastic models.
It is the office of Linus Pauling.
Although new to The Farm, he is hardly a
stranger in academic circles. The only man to
win two complete Nobel Prizes, Pauling has
been a teacher and researcher for more than 40
of his 68 years.
Pacifist Chemist
He is one of the world's leading chemists
and, in recent years, one of its leading pacifists.
How does he now find himself at Stanford;
Pauling announced this April that he would
leave his teaching position at the University of
California at San Diego (UCSD) to make the
move.
He says he was not sure that the UC
Regents, a group Pauling often found himself in
conflict with, would rehire him for the 69-70
year. In addition, he didn't want to be with the
UC system any longer; "Too much politics," he
explained. Stanford's Medical School also
attracted him and his research interests.
Pauling will teach no classes this year, except
for a possible seminar Winter or Spring term.
Instead, he will devote his time to the two
research projects in which he is presently
involved.
Research Interests
His chief research now is probing the
molecular aspects of mental disease

(Orthomolecular Psychiatry). Specifically, this
involves the theory that "varying the
concentrations of substances normally present
in the human body may control mental
disease."
In addition, he is now working with three
UCSD people on a new theory of molecular
structure of atomic nuclei and trying to develop
a new approach of nuclear structure.
Pauling says he is now working on two
fronts —two theoretical fields (molecular and
atomic structure) and an experimental field
(mental health research). About eight persons
are involved in the two projects.
ICSP President
During the summer, Pauling was president of
the Second International Congress on Social
Psychiatry in London, addressed the Eighth
International Congress of Crystalography in
New York and, just ten days before
registration, attended a Nobel conference in
Stockholm.
But his energies have not been confined
merely to the classroom or laboratory. He is a
long-time opponent of nuclear weapons testing.
In 1957, he circulated a petition, ultimately
by 1 1,021 scientists and presented to the
United Nations, urging international cessation
of bomb testing. In 1958 he was a complainant
in an unsuccessful suit to enjoin the Defense
Department and Atomic Energy Commission
from nuclear testing, and pleaded the cause of
disarmament in his book "No More War".
Communist Suspect
His political activity, even in the early 1950s
was sometimes cause for trouble. Suspected by

the State Department of pro-Soviet leanings, he
was denied a passport in 1952 and 54, but after
receiving the 1954 Nobel Prize in chemistry,
the State Dept. changed its mind and granted
Pauling an unlimited passport.
Sen. Joseph McCarthy once accused Pauling
of being a Communist, but he denied it, saying
"I am not even a theoretical Marxist." And, in
1960, he successfully defied a Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee, which asked him to
reveal the names of persons who helped him
circulate the disarmament petition.
Regarding his tendency to speak out so
freely, Pauling said "It is important for people
in academic life to express their opinions.
People in big corporations can't speak
out . . .politicians can't be trusted."
He remarked the Smothers Brothers "are
doing a good job," but concluded that "only
academic people" can speak their minds, "only
the professors are left."
Academic Freedom
Concerning academic freedom, Pauling
noted that "radical and liberal professors may
bo subject to pressure by the administration,
but this pressure can only go so far."
Faculty members who encounter problems
find, according to Pauling, it "might be
inconvenient that the administration can
retaliate, but they still can't fire him." He said
if political pressures get too much, the
university can't do its job.
It would seem, though, that Pauling has
never found his job hard to do. His work on
chemical bonds and molecular structure
brought him the Nobel Prize in 1954. After

receiving his B.S. from Oregon State College
and his Ph.D. summa cum laude from Cal Tech,
he went on to numerous teaching and advisory
positions.
High School Dropout
Ironically, he never received his high school
diploma until 1962 because he didn't have the
right courses at the time he graduated.
He has been given many awards in chemistry
and public service. His wartime work earned
him the Presidential Medal of Merit in 1948,
and was awarded the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize
on October 11,1 96»3—the day a partial nuclear
test ban treaty took affect. Presumably, though
never officially, the prize was given in
recognition of Pauling's work on behalf of such
a ban.
Pauling's work includes almost 400 scientific
publications, nine books and about 100 papers
on science and world affairs.
Km in en I Pacifist Speaker
Pauling estimates he has delivered about
1000 public addresses in 26 countries on world
peace. In just two weeks this summer he gave
three lectures and participated in two Swedish
university teach-ins. His October schedule calls
for lour public appearances, including
participation in the Anti-Vietnam war protest
on the 1 sth.
While he was teaching at Cal Tech, Pauling
took a leave of absence to join the Center for
the Study of Democratic Institutions, hoping to
further work for world peace. In 1962, he even
received 2100 write-in votes for governor of
California.
Pauling freely discusses many topics.

VIETNAM—"We have to pull out and
sacrifice the South Vietnamese dictatorship.
Nixon talks about the people of South
Vietnam, but it is obvious he isn't interested in
them. Joining with the NLF is essential to end
the war."
THE DRAFT—"Must have a volunteer army.
All the talk that we are 'freedom fighters' is
hyprocrisy."
CBW—"It involves special dangers. We
should stop all research and developments."
CAMPUS DEMONSTRATIONS-"In favor
of it. Some actions are unwise, but they're not
planned out. They have led to changes that are
desirable. I have for many years doubted the
system of trustees and regents. It must be
changed to have not just rich people and
powerful people, but academic people."
UNIVERSITY PURPOSE—"They are many.
To preserve the body of knowledge and add to
it and to pass it on to young people to prepare
them to lead as good a life as they can. Every
university doesn't need to present courses of
interest to the entire country . . .it can get
diluted down."
Pauling says he in convinced "it isn't the
duty of scientists alone to determine the uses of
science. They have a special obligation, because
of better background in interpreting science.
They have a duty to educate fellow citizens."
Claiming that scientists "can't always tell
what the results will be," Pauling says that the
scientist must "not only give facts, but also his
opinions and conclusions."
Linus Pauling has never hesitated to give his
facts or opinions—and now he has brought
them to Stanford

New York and, just ten days before
registration, attended a Nobel conference in
Stockholm.
But his energies have not been confined
merely to the classroom or laboratory. He is a
long-time opponent of nuclear weapons testing.
In 1957, he circulated a petition, ultimately
by 1 1,021 scientists and presented to the
United Nations, urging international cessation
of bomb testing. In 1958 he was a complainant
in an unsuccessful suit to enjoin the Defense
Department and Atomic Energy Commission
from nuclear testing, and pleaded the cause of
disarmament in his book "No More War".
Communist Suspect
His political activity, even in the early 1950s
was sometimes cause for trouble. Suspected by

the State Department of pro-Soviet leanings, he
was denied a passport in 1952 and 54, but after
receiving the 1954 Nobel Prize in chemistry,
the State Dept. changed its mind and granted
Pauling an unlimited passport.
Sen. Joseph McCarthy once accused Pauling
of being a Communist, but he denied it, saying
"I am not even a theoretical Marxist." And, in
1960, he successfully defied a Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee, which asked him to
reveal the names of persons who helped him
circulate the disarmament petition.
Regarding his tendency to speak out so
freely, Pauling said "It is important for people
in academic life to express their opinions.
People in big corporations can't speak
out . . .politicians can't be trusted."
He remarked the Smothers Brothers "are
doing a good job," but concluded that "only
academic people" can speak their minds, "only
the professors are left."
Academic Freedom
Concerning academic freedom, Pauling
noted that "radical and liberal professors may
bo subject to pressure by the administration,
but this pressure can only go so far."
Faculty members who encounter problems
find, according to Pauling, it "might be
inconvenient that the administration can
retaliate, but they still can't fire him." He said
if political pressures get too much, the
university can't do its job.
It would seem, though, that Pauling has
never found his job hard to do. His work on
chemical bonds and molecular structure
brought him the Nobel Prize in 1954. After

receiving his B.S. from Oregon State College
and his Ph.D. summa cum laude from Cal Tech,
he went on to numerous teaching and advisory
positions.
High School Dropout
Ironically, he never received his high school
diploma until 1962 because he didn't have the
right courses at the time he graduated.
He has been given many awards in chemistry
and public service. His wartime work earned
him the Presidential Medal of Merit in 1948,
and was awarded the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize
on October 11,1 96»3—the day a partial nuclear
test ban treaty took affect. Presumably, though
never officially, the prize was given in
recognition of Pauling's work on behalf of such
a ban.
Pauling's work includes almost 400 scientific
publications, nine books and about 100 papers
on science and world affairs.
Km in en I Pacifist Speaker
Pauling estimates he has delivered about
1000 public addresses in 26 countries on world
peace. In just two weeks this summer he gave
three lectures and participated in two Swedish
university teach-ins. His October schedule calls
for lour public appearances, including
participation in the Anti-Vietnam war protest
on the 1 sth.
While he was teaching at Cal Tech, Pauling
took a leave of absence to join the Center for
the Study of Democratic Institutions, hoping to
further work for world peace. In 1962, he even
received 2100 write-in votes for governor of
California.
Pauling freely discusses many topics.

VIETNAM—"We have to pull out and
sacrifice the South Vietnamese dictatorship.
Nixon talks about the people of South
Vietnam, but it is obvious he isn't interested in
them. Joining with the NLF is essential to end
the war."
THE DRAFT—"Must have a volunteer army.
All the talk that we are 'freedom fighters' is
hyprocrisy."
CBW—"It involves special dangers. We
should stop all research and developments."
CAMPUS DEMONSTRATIONS-"In favor
of it. Some actions are unwise, but they're not
planned out. They have led to changes that are
desirable. I have for many years doubted the
system of trustees and regents. It must be
changed to have not just rich people and
powerful people, but academic people."
UNIVERSITY PURPOSE—"They are many.
To preserve the body of knowledge and add to
it and to pass it on to young people to prepare
them to lead as good a life as they can. Every
university doesn't need to present courses of
interest to the entire country . . .it can get
diluted down."
Pauling says he in convinced "it isn't the
duty of scientists alone to determine the uses of
science. They have a special obligation, because
of better background in interpreting science.
They have a duty to educate fellow citizens."
Claiming that scientists "can't always tell
what the results will be," Pauling says that the
scientist must "not only give facts, but also his
opinions and conclusions."
Linus Pauling has never hesitated to give his
facts or opinions—and now he has brought
them to Stanford
Tucked away in the corner of a chemistry
building is the office of one of Stanford's 175
new faculty members.
It is an office cluttered with boxes, with a
chalkboard of sketches of the atom and shelves
jammed with books, papers and plastic models.
It is the office of Linus Pauling.
Although new to The Farm, he is hardly a
stranger in academic circles. The only man to
win two complete Nobel Prizes, Pauling has
been a teacher and researcher for more than 40
of his 68 years.
Pacifist Chemist
He is one of the world's leading chemists
and, in recent years, one of its leading pacifists.
How does he now find himself at Stanford;
Pauling announced this April that he would
leave his teaching position at the University of
California at San Diego (UCSD) to make the
move.
He says he was not sure that the UC
Regents, a group Pauling often found himself in
conflict with, would rehire him for the 69-70
year. In addition, he didn't want to be with the
UC system any longer; "Too much politics," he
explained. Stanford's Medical School also
attracted him and his research interests.
Pauling will teach no classes this year, except
for a possible seminar Winter or Spring term.
Instead, he will devote his time to the two
research projects in which he is presently
involved.
Research Interests
His chief research now is probing the
molecular aspects of mental disease

(Orthomolecular Psychiatry). Specifically, this
involves the theory that "varying the
concentrations of substances normally present
in the human body may control mental
disease."
In addition, he is now working with three
UCSD people on a new theory of molecular
structure of atomic nuclei and trying to develop
a new approach of nuclear structure.
Pauling says he is now working on two
fronts —two theoretical fields (molecular and
atomic structure) and an experimental field
(mental health research). About eight persons
are involved in the two projects.

chemical bonds and molecular structure
brought him the Nobel Prize in 1954. After

receiving his B.S. from Oregon State College
and his Ph.D. summa cum laude from Cal Tech,
he went on to numerous teaching and advisory
positions.
High School Dropout
Ironically, he never received his high school
diploma until 1962 because he didn't have the
right courses at the time he graduated.
He has been given many awards in chemistry
and public service. His wartime work earned
him the Presidential Medal of Merit in 1948,
and was awarded the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize
on October 11,1 96»3—the day a partial nuclear
test ban treaty took affect. Presumably, though
never officially, the prize was given in
recognition of Pauling's work on behalf of such
a ban.
Pauling's work includes almost 400 scientific
publications, nine books and about 100 papers
on science and world affairs.

Pauling estimates he has delivered about
1000 public addresses in 26 countries on world
peace. In just two weeks this summer he gave
three lectures and participated in two Swedish
university teach-ins. His October schedule calls
for lour public appearances, including
participation in the Anti-Vietnam war protest
on the 1 sth.
While he was teaching at Cal Tech, Pauling
took a leave of absence to join the Center for
the Study of Democratic Institutions, hoping to
further work for world peace. In 1962, he even
received 2100 write-in votes for governor of
California.
Pauling freely discusses many topics.

VIETNAM—"We have to pull out and
sacrifice the South Vietnamese dictatorship.
Nixon talks about the people of South
Vietnam, but it is obvious he isn't interested in
them. Joining with the NLF is essential to end
the war."
THE DRAFT—"Must have a volunteer army.
All the talk that we are 'freedom fighters' is
hyprocrisy."
CBW—"It involves special dangers. We
should stop all research and developments."
CAMPUS DEMONSTRATIONS-"In favor
of it. Some actions are unwise, but they're not
planned out. They have led to changes that are
desirable. I have for many years doubted the
system of trustees and regents. It must be
changed to have not just rich people and
powerful people, but academic people."
UNIVERSITY PURPOSE—"They are many.
To preserve the body of knowledge and add to
it and to pass it on to young people to prepare
them to lead as good a life as they can. Every
university doesn't need to present courses of
interest to the entire country . . .it can get
diluted down."
Pauling says he in convinced "it isn't the
duty of scientists alone to determine the uses of
science. They have a special obligation, because
of better background in interpreting science.
They have a duty to educate fellow citizens."
Claiming that scientists "can't always tell
what the results will be," Pauling says that the
scientist must "not only give facts, but also his
opinions and conclusions."
Linus Pauling has never hesitated to give his
facts or opinions—and now he has brought
them to Stanford
Tucked away in the corner of a chemistry
building is the office of one of Stanford's 175
new faculty members.
It is an office cluttered with boxes, with a
chalkboard of sketches of the atom and shelves
jammed with books, papers and plastic models.
It is the office of Linus Pauling.
Although new to The Farm, he is hardly a
stranger in academic circles. The only man to
win two complete Nobel Prizes, Pauling has
been a teacher and researcher for more than 40
of his 68 years.
Pacifist Chemist
He is one of the world's leading chemists
and, in recent years, one of its leading pacifists.
How does he now find himself at Stanford;
Pauling announced this April that he would
leave his teaching position at the University of
California at San Diego (UCSD) to make the
move.
He says he was not sure that the UC
Regents, a group Pauling often found himself in
conflict with, would rehire him for the 69-70
year. In addition, he didn't want to be with the
UC system any longer; "Too much politics," he
explained. Stanford's Medical School also
attracted him and his research interests.
Pauling will teach no classes this year, except
for a possible seminar Winter or Spring term.
Instead, he will devote his time to the two
research projects in which he is presently
involved.
Research Interests
His chief research now is probing the
molecular aspects of mental disease

(Orthomolecular Psychiatry). Specifically, this
involves the theory that "varying the
concentrations of substances normally present
in the human body may control mental
disease."
In addition, he is now working with three
UCSD people on a new theory of molecular
structure of atomic nuclei and trying to develop
a new approach of nuclear structure.
Pauling says he is now working on two
fronts —two theoretical fields (molecular and
atomic structure) and an experimental field
(mental health research). About eight persons
are involved in the two projects.
ICSP President
During the summer, Pauling was president of
the Second International Congress on Social
Psychiatry in London, addressed the Eighth
International Congress of Crystalography in
New York and, just ten days before
registration, attended a Nobel conference in
Stockholm.
But his energies have not been confined
merely to the classroom or laboratory. He is a
long-time opponent of nuclear weapons testing.
In 1957, he circulated a petition, ultimately
by 1 1,021 scientists and presented to the
United Nations, urging international cessation
of bomb testing. In 1958 he was a complainant
in an unsuccessful suit to enjoin the Defense
Department and Atomic Energy Commission
from nuclear testing, and pleaded the cause of
disarmament in his book "No More War".
Communist Suspect
His political activity, even in the early 1950s
was sometimes cause for trouble. Suspected by

the State Department of pro-Soviet leanings, he
was denied a passport in 1952 and 54, but after
receiving the 1954 Nobel Prize in chemistry,
the State Dept. changed its mind and granted
Pauling an unlimited passport.
Sen. Joseph McCarthy once accused Pauling
of being a Communist, but he denied it, saying
"I am not even a theoretical Marxist." And, in
1960, he successfully defied a Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee, which asked him to
reveal the names of persons who helped him
circulate the disarmament petition.
Regarding his tendency to speak out so
freely, Pauling said "It is important for people
in academic life to express their opinions.
People in big corporations can't speak
out . . .politicians can't be trusted."
He remarked the Smothers Brothers "are
doing a good job," but concluded that "only
academic people" can speak their minds, "only
the professors are left."
Academic Freedom
Concerning academic freedom, Pauling
noted that "radical and liberal professors may
bo subject to pressure by the administration,
but this pressure can only go so far."
Faculty members who encounter problems
find, according to Pauling, it "might be
inconvenient that the administration can
retaliate, but they still can't fire him." He said
if political pressures get too much, the
university can't do its job.
It would seem, though, that Pauling has
never found his job hard to do. His work on

of it. Some actions are unwise, but they're not

powerful people, but academic people."

Pauling says he in convinced "it isn't the
duty of scientists alone to determine the uses of
science. They have a special obligation, because
of better background in interpreting science.
They have a duty to educate fellow citizens."
Claiming that scientists "can't always tell
what the results will be," Pauling says that the
scientist must "not only give facts, but also his
opinions and conclusions."
Linus Pauling has never hesitated to give his
facts or opinions—and now he has brought
them to Stanford
Tucked away in the corner of a chemistry
building is the office of one of Stanford's 175
new faculty members.
It is an office cluttered with boxes, with a
chalkboard of sketches of the atom and shelves
jammed with books, papers and plastic models.
It is the office of Linus Pauling.
Although new to The Farm, he is hardly a
stranger in academic circles. The only man to
win two complete Nobel Prizes, Pauling has
been a teacher and researcher for more than 40
of his 68 years.
Pacifist Chemist
He is one of the world's leading chemists
and, in recent years, one of its leading pacifists.
How does he now find himself at Stanford;
Pauling announced this April that he would
leave his teaching position at the University of
California at San Diego (UCSD) to make the
move.
He says he was not sure that the UC
Regents, a group Pauling often found himself in
conflict with, would rehire him for the 69-70
year. In addition, he didn't want to be with the
UC system any longer; "Too much politics," he
explained. Stanford's Medical School also
attracted him and his research interests.
Pauling will teach no classes this year, except
for a possible seminar Winter or Spring term.
Instead, he will devote his time to the two
research projects in which he is presently
involved.
Research Interests
His chief research now is probing the
molecular aspects of mental disease

(Orthomolecular Psychiatry). Specifically, this
involves the theory that "varying the
concentrations of substances normally present
in the human body may control mental
disease."
In addition, he is now working with three
UCSD people on a new theory of molecular
structure of atomic nuclei and trying to develop
a new approach of nuclear structure.
Pauling says he is now working on two
fronts —two theoretical fields (molecular and
atomic structure) and an experimental field
(mental health research). About eight persons
are involved in the two projects.
ICSP President
During the summer, Pauling was president of
the Second International Congress on Social
Psychiatry in London, addressed the Eighth
International Congress of Crystalography in
New York and, just ten days before
registration, attended a Nobel conference in
Stockholm.
But his energies have not been confined
merely to the classroom or laboratory. He is a
long-time opponent of nuclear weapons testing.
In 1957, he circulated a petition, ultimately
by 1 1,021 scientists and presented to the
United Nations, urging international cessation
of bomb testing. In 1958 he was a complainant
in an unsuccessful suit to enjoin the Defense
Department and Atomic Energy Commission
from nuclear testing, and pleaded the cause of
disarmament in his book "No More War".
Communist Suspect
His political activity, even in the early 1950s
was sometimes cause for trouble. Suspected by

the State Department of pro-Soviet leanings, he
was denied a passport in 1952 and 54, but after
receiving the 1954 Nobel Prize in chemistry,
the State Dept. changed its mind and granted
Pauling an unlimited passport.
Sen. Joseph McCarthy once accused Pauling
of being a Communist, but he denied it, saying
"I am not even a theoretical Marxist." And, in
1960, he successfully defied a Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee, which asked him to
reveal the names of persons who helped him
circulate the disarmament petition.
Regarding his tendency to speak out so
freely, Pauling said "It is important for people
in academic life to express their opinions.
People in big corporations can't speak
out . . .politicians can't be trusted."
He remarked the Smothers Brothers "are
doing a good job," but concluded that "only
academic people" can speak their minds, "only
the professors are left."
Academic Freedom
Concerning academic freedom, Pauling
noted that "radical and liberal professors may
bo subject to pressure by the administration,
but this pressure can only go so far."
Faculty members who encounter problems
find, according to Pauling, it "might be
inconvenient that the administration can
retaliate, but they still can't fire him." He said
if political pressures get too much, the
university can't do its job.
It would seem, though, that Pauling has
never found his job hard to do. His work on
chemical bonds and molecular structure
brought him the Nobel Prize in 1954. After

receiving his B.S. from Oregon State College
and his Ph.D. summa cum laude from Cal Tech,
he went on to numerous teaching and advisory
positions.
High School Dropout
Ironically, he never received his high school
diploma until 1962 because he didn't have the
right courses at the time he graduated.
He has been given many awards in chemistry
and public service. His wartime work earned
him the Presidential Medal of Merit in 1948,
and was awarded the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize
on October 11,1 96»3—the day a partial nuclear
test ban treaty took affect. Presumably, though
never officially, the prize was given in
recognition of Pauling's work on behalf of such
a ban.
Pauling's work includes almost 400 scientific
publications, nine books and about 100 papers
on science and world affairs.
Km in en I Pacifist Speaker
Pauling estimates he has delivered about
1000 public addresses in 26 countries on world
peace. In just two weeks this summer he gave
three lectures and participated in two Swedish
university teach-ins. His October schedule calls
for lour public appearances, including
participation in the Anti-Vietnam war protest
on the 1 sth.
While he was teaching at Cal Tech, Pauling
took a leave of absence to join the Center for
the Study of Democratic Institutions, hoping to
further work for world peace. In 1962, he even
received 2100 write-in votes for governor of
California.
Pauling freely discusses many topics.

VIETNAM—"We have to pull out and
sacrifice the South Vietnamese dictatorship.
Nixon talks about the people of South
Vietnam, but it is obvious he isn't interested in
them. Joining with the NLF is essential to end
the war."
THE DRAFT—"Must have a volunteer army.
All the talk that we are 'freedom fighters' is
hyprocrisy."
CBW—"It involves special dangers. We
should stop all research and developments."
