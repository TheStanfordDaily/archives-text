## Class Closure Disputed 
### Herbert L. Packer 
I have read with great interest
the column by Professor Stephen
Kline in this morning's Daily. I
agree with almost all of it.
However, I cannot concur with his
statement that he "will
dismiss . . .class that day if all or
nearly all of its students concur."
I agree with the idea of a boycott?*
of classes on October 15th by
those students who see such a
boycott as an effective means of
protesting the war in Vietnam.
However, I question the reciprocal
idea of a de facto faculty strike,
which is the implication of
Professor Kline's position.

Students are free to attend
class or not, as they see fit. The
faculty, I think, has the obligation
to meet their classes. Next month,
we are told, the boycott will be
upped to two days. The next
month, it will be upped to three
days, and so on for the rest of the
year, if the President and Congress
do not respond appropriately
(which 1 suppose very few think
they will).
I would like to know on what
principle, if any, Professor Kline
will draw the line at a two or a
nine day "strike." The faculty, I
should have thought, is here to

teach. If the University were to
dismiss classes on October 15th
for a convocation or a "teach-in"
on ending the war, that would be
one thing. But Professor Kline's
ad hoc decision not to meet his
class strikes me as being in the
profoundest sense unprofessional.
I note that he has left himself an
out. If "nearly all" of his students
do not concur, I assume that he
will hold class. A strike in
response to a total boycott simply
will not do; it finesses an
important issue of principle. I'd
like to hear more on this from
Professor Kline or other faculty
members. Better yet, I invite the
President or the Provost to break
the silence they have so far
maintained on this issue.
