# Pitzer Voices Sympathy For Vietnam Moratorium
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
President Kenneth Pitzer
yesterday offered the October 15
Vietnam Moratorium sympathy
but withheld formal institutional
support.
He said "Many members of the
Stanford community oppose the
war in Vietnam, and many of
these men and women have—as I
have—in ways dictated by their
individual consciences protested
against the war and against its
effect upon our society, our
economy, and our youths.
"I understand and share many
of the concerns which underlie
the Oct. 15 moratorium, and I
applaud the sacrifice of personal
time on the part of those who
intend to involve themselves in it.
"The University must meet its
continuing responsibilities;
moreover, the moratorium seeks
to elicit individual acts that arise
from conscience. Therefore,
University personnel will be
expected to schedule any
participation they may wish to
undertake so that the University's
obligations are fully met."
At the same time, the
crescendo of Vietnam protest was
rising yesterday from the
ivy-covered walls of Harvard to
the halls of Congress.
Faculty Authorizes Suspension
At Cambridge, the Harvard
faculty of Arts and Sciences took
a bold step and voted 391-16,
with 150 abstentions, to
"authorize its members to
suspend classes" on October 15.
The resolution emphasized that
the faculty action did not commit
any member.
That action was part of a
resolution calling for the
"prompt, rapid and complete
withdrawal of United States
forces from Vietnam." The
resolution was a sharp departure
from traditional Harvard and
university policy of political
neutrality.
The Harvard decision followed
by two weeks a similar action by
the Senate of Columbia
University. Colleges that will be
closed for the day include Tufts,
Northeastern, Wellesley, Simmons
and Bentley. Classes will be
optional at Brandeis, Boston
University, and Boston College.
No Stanford Action
At Stanford, officers of the
Academic Senate said last night
that they knew of no formal
faculty attempts to follow
Harvard's lead.
Nevertheless, history professor
Barton Bernstein said he thought
that "when the professors see this
in their morning papers, they will
move in a similar direction." Still,
he emphasized that he knew of no
"planned action."
Fulfilling Obligations
Provost Lyman amplified
Pitzer's statement. He said that

for the staff and faculty to fulfill
"University obligations" they
should perform their normal
functions. Nevertheless, he denied
that any efforts would be made to
determine which faculty were not
teaching classes.
"There is a long tradition of
faculty responsibility for classes.
It is understood that the faculty
will do the best they can to fulfill
their responsibility. I don't think
this is the time for the
administration to start peeping
over their shoulders," he said.
Commenting on those faculty
who have announced they will not
hold classes, Lyman said, "I
consider that unfortunate. I do
not think it is the purpose of the
moratorium to sacrifice the
teaching of classes for opposing a
war.
Organization Complete
"It seems to me that people
should merely realign their
schedules to take part in what is a
very worthwhile act."
In the United States Senate two
resolutions were introduced
seeking U.S. withdrawal from the
war.
Democratic Senators Harold
Hughes of lowa and Thomas

Eagleton of Missouri requested
that America pull out within 60
days unless Saigon ends
"censorship, releases prisoners and
prepares to yield power to a
provisional government."
Senator Frank Church,
D-Idaho, and Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore., made the other proposal.
They urged withdrawal after "a
reasonable interval''
commensurate with troop safety.
"Constructive Debate"
Amidst the resolutions,
minority leader Hugh Scott
(R-Penn.) appealed for tolerance.
At the same time he broadened
his definition of "constructive
debate."
Referring to the
Hughes-Eagleton proposal he said,
"This is the kind of constructive
debate which I had hoped would
emerge. My suggestion that we
hold down differences to the
quiet and reasonable
consideration of alternatives has
been respected ..."
Scott did not comment on the
Church speech which drew a
select audience of Senate doves.
"1 didn't hear it,"he said. "No
Republican did . . ."

In organizational developments
yesterday, leaders of the
moratorium here announced that
more than 200 faculty and 1,000
students have already expressed
support in the protest.
John Kramer, a leader of
student volunteers organizing
support, expressed hope that
upward? of 5,000 of the 11,000
Stanford students might
ultimately participate.
He also announced that dorm
and precinct organizers had been
recruited for all on and off
campus positions. Meetings to
coordinate these organizers will be
held tonight at 7:30 in TMU and
Sunday night at 9 P.M.
Two general meetings are
scheduled for October 14 and 15.
The first will be a mass meeting
next Tuesday night. Its purpose
will be to gather all support for
final coordination. Speakers for
this rally are yet to be announced.
The other meeting is planned
for 8 P.M. Wednesday in the
Inner Quad. Nobel Laureate
Linus Pauling, Congressman Pete
McCloskey (R-San Mateo) and
Don Edwards (D-San Jose), and
San Francisco publisher Carleton
Goodlett will be featured.


MORATORIUM PLANNlNG—sociology professor Sanford Dornbusch, John Kramer, Mrs. John Merry man, and Douglas
Matlern (left lo right) review plans for door-to-door canvassing to seek a prompt end to the Vietnam War. More than 200
faculty and 1000 students have indicated they will support the day-long moratorium program.
