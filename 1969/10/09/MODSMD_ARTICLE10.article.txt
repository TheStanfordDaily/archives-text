## Reed Confronts Accusation 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
My personal integrity and that
of the Political Union Board have
been assailed. In a letter headed
"Right Wing Greed" which
appeared in The Daily yesterday,
Mr. Roger Wilner accuses the two
interim members of the Board,
Charles Marz and myself, of
"going after the Stanford student
body funds" and using the Board
"to promulgate" our "own
beliefs."
At the beginning of last Spring
Quarter, the President of the
Political Union, Neil Golden,

resigned and appointed me to
serve in his place. Charles Marz
was also appointed to the Board,
along with others. With he funds
in our treasury at that time, we
sponsored two speakers: Dr.
Henry Steel Commager of
Amherst, a noted historian and
author, and Carl Rowan, a black
columnist and former Director of
the U.S. Information Agency.
Their honorariums totaled
$2,250.00. Can this be cited as an
example of our "going after the
Stanford student body funds" to
promote "right-wing speakers?"
The idea is ludicrous
The Political Union Board last
Spring also co-sponsored the
appearances on campus of Marcus
Raskin, Director of the Institute
for Policy Studies and Co-Editor
of "The Vietnam Reader"; Klaus
Meshkat, former President of the
German SDS; Phillip Abbott
Luce, former officer in the
Progressive Labor Party and
present officer in Young
Americans for Freedom; and
Cyprian Ekwinski, a Biafran
novelist. What happened to "the
avaricious right wing?"
The Political Union is a
non-partisan organization
operating under the ASSU and
funded lay LASSU, or this year,
the new Senate. The members of
the Political Union Board are
formally chosen by a Selection
Committee consisting of three
incumbents on the Board, three
members of LASSU, and a
member of the Council of
Presidents. Late last Spring, the
Committee decided to wait until
the beginning of this year to
review applications for the Board.
In the meantime, I would serve as
Interim President and Charles
Marz as Interim Vice-President.
Mr. Wilner, President of the
Stanford Democratic Club, would
smear us both as "Republicans,"
myself a "Reagan-for-President
man." If we must use labels, I
suppose I would be called a
conservative Republican. Charles
Marz has no political affiliation
and would be judged, I believe, a
middle-of-the-roader by most
people, including analysts more
impartial than Mr. Wilner.
However, our personal political
beliefs are not the question here.
At issue is the objective,
non-partisan orientation of the
Political Union. I invite you to
ssess our efforts to present a
balanced program of speakers
from several areas of the political
spectrum.
True, we have issued invitations
to Barry Goldwater, Dr. Russell
Kirk and William F. Buckley, Jr.
But we have also issued invitations
to Senator Stuart Symington,
Councilman Thomas Bradley of
Los Angeles, Harrison Salisbury of
the New York Times, Senator
Mark Hatfield, Senator Edmund
Muskie, Secretary of
Transportation John Volpe,
Senator Birch Bayh, President
Richard Nixon, Mayor Joseph
Alioto, Governor Dan Evans,
Congressman John Tunney,
Governor John Love and Dr.
Herbert Marcuse.
I think it is going to be rather
difficult to justify any accusation
of right-wing bias in our dealings
on the Political Union Board. For
example, I did not feel that I was
serving the interests of the Young
Republicans when I made a trip
from Palo Alto to Los Angeles
and back in September for the
sole purpose of talking with
Councilman Bradley's
Appointments Secretary about
the possibility of his speaking on
our campus.

Acting on a projected budget of
$5,000, we have made plans for a
Symposium with the theme
"America on the Threshold of the
Seventies" to be held during the
first two weeks in November.
Commitments have already been
made by Mayor Joseph Alioto,
Dr. Russell Kirk, Congressman
John Tunney, Senator Barry
Goldwater, and Harrison Salisbury
of the New York Times.
Hopefully, Governor Dan Evans
of Washington will also be
speaking.
It is my belief that this
Symposium will present to the
Stanford community men and
ideas representing several areas of
political conviction. Notions that
student funds have been usurped
to finance some sort of right-wing
operation are truly astounding.
Rather, we have made a
conscientious effort to be fair and
objective; in the light of what we
have done, I believe we have
succeeded.
As advertised several times in
The Daily applications for this
year's Political Union Board have
been accepted for the past week.
On Tuesday, the Selection
Committee decided to meet
Wednesday night.
I hope that the members of the
Stanford community will
continue to support the Political
Union in its efforts to present an
exciting, balanced program of
speakers and discussions.

Stanford Political Union
Debate Continues
Editor, THE DAILY:
You're wrong, Mr. Bridgeman.
Academic freedom did not die
at Stanford on Aug. 13, the day
you could not enter the
Electronics Research Review
Conference.
It began dying the day in 1966
that a band of students and
non-students staged the first sit-in
at the President's office—and a
passive campus looked the other
way or rationalized that
infringement on the rights of
others.
It died, a little more when the
same groups and others hooted
Hubert Humphrey off the campus
because they were so "right" that
they could do whatever they
wished in the name of their cause.
And the campus remained silent.
It died still more when the SDS
blocked students from interviews
the students had signed up
for —only to have the radicals put
the Stanford judicial system on
trial instead of their own
violations. And the campus
swallowed it.
It died when Secretary of State
Rusk had to be told it was not
safe for him to speak at Stanford;
when the A3M displaced "only"
1 50 researchers because they were
engaged in work the students did
not like; when students manned
barricades because the Trustees
would not disregard the wishes of
3000 workers at SRI in favor of
the demands of the A3M.
Little wonder Dean Petit took
it upon himself to make certain
that his conference was not
disrupted, Mr. Bridgeman. Very
few people on this campus have
dared to recognize that the
internal excesses from the Left,
clothed in magnificent morality,
just as evil and dangerous as the
external threat of Joe
McCarthyism.
In short, if your voice had been
raised long ago to protest the
blatant violations of academic

freedom, Mr. Bridgeman, I could
be more sympathetic toward your
complaint today. The threat is
from the radicals, and not from a
dean trying to guarantee his
conference freedom of discourse.
If the rights of everyone to speak
and be heard had been defended
years ago, the doors of the
electronics conference would not
have to be guarded today.
Henry Bufano
Radical Threat
Editor, THE DAILY:
Professor Packer has asked me
to explain my position (DAILY,
Oct. 7) regarding possible
dismissal of classes on October
15th. I am glad to do so.
My position differs by a mere
hairsbreadth from Prof. Packer's.
What I said was "If I were a
student, I would not attend class
on October 15th. Asa professor, I
will not hold class IF ALL OR
NEARLY ALL my class plans not
to come." I have now added the
underline; it is the operative
phrase with which Prof. Packer
disagreed.
What I mean by "nearly all" is
all but say two or three students,
that is, such a small proportion
that it would be unfair to those
who were absent to continue in he
normal way. I agree, as a matter
of principle, that it is not the
prerogative of the instructor to
impose his political views,
regarding any issue, on a class, and
that unilateral dismissal of a class
for a political reason is such an
imposition. On the other hand, if
the class is already essentially
agreed on an action, then the
Prof, is not imposing his views.
Moreover, professors, as
individual citizens, have the right
and the obligation to encourage
intelligent, non-violent, political
action. Far too few have spoken
out on the current issues facing
this country. As a result, many
students feel we are against them
on matters where we in fact agree.
Few faculty would disagree today
that the Vietnam war should be
halted and very soon. Few would
disagree that a re-alignment of

national priorities is needed.
Almost none would disagree that
improvement in the "quality of
life" for the individual and rapid
action on ghetto and minority
problems is vitally needed.
I, and some others, disagree
about the nature of effective
solutions and the optimum ways
in which solutions can in fact be
created. However, that should not
lead us into silence or
disagreement with these
remarkable ideals of the current
student generation.
