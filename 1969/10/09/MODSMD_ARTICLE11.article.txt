## Berets Atrocity 
### John Spiegel 
The prolonged agony of the
Vietnamese people is so
incredible, the guilt of this
country so staggering, that it
seems ridiculous to single out and
label as an "atrocity" any one
incident from the list of political
assassinations, systematic
torturing, mass deportations, and
mere "unfortunate mistakes"
which comprise so large a part of
our glorious military record in the
Vietnam War.
Yet the circumstances
surrounding the alleged Green
Beret murder of a Vietnamese
double agent provoke a singular
repugnance; there can be no
clearer indication of the moral
bankruptcy of our government,
no better instance of what the war
has done to undermine the
confidence of the American
people in that government.
The whole affair has a
Man-from-Uncle air about it. On
the basis of newspaper reports,
the story appears to be a sordid
one. The killing was ordered
mysteriously from on high; one of
the six accused Berets wrote to his
wife, "The powers to be decided
to do away with him [ the victim J.
Being the people involved, it was
up to us to come up with a plan
and execute it." Something went
wrong, however, between the
military command in Vietnam and
the CIA, and the dutiful
executioners were charged with
murder. With publicity mounting
and the defense adamant on the
involvement of the CIA, the White
House intervened, and Army
Secretary Rasor announced that

the charges were being dropped.
The explanation for the complete
reversal- of Rasor's position of
eleven days earlier: the CIA
refused, "in the interest of
national security," to provide the
court with witnesses, and a fair
trial was now impossible for the
defendants.
Justice and Ihe Courts
The decision to sweep the
matter under the rug will
probably prevent us from
knowing what actually occurred
in the citadels of power where the
fate of the accused was decided,
but one point is clear: the highest
level of the government
bureaucracy may simply choose
to ignore the traditional American
"rule of law" whenever that rule
conflicts with the logic of
personal power or elite-defined
"national interest".
The Beret case simply
symbolizes the perverted justice
dispensed by the American legal
system. Our courts can send the
best men of our generation to
prison for refusing to join the
slaughter in Vietnam, and at the
same time, to the applause of the
House of Representatives, can
return to duty a crew of trained
murderers.
"Conspirators" Spock, Coffin,
and the Chicago Eight are
prosecuted by their judges, and
policeman Michael O'Brien
defended by his. The drunk cops
who shot up the Panther
headquarters receive one-year
suspended sentences, while an
A3M student gets a fine and thirty
days for his Hanover Street
slogan-painting.
Those who attempt to base a
political career, campus or
otherwise, on the platitudes of
"change-through-the-system" and
"respect-for-constitutional
process" must be reminded of the
corruption and political bias of
our courts. The decline of the
"rule of law" is, in our society, a
critical phenomenon. Under
similar circumstances the Roman
republic, also founded on the
concept of law, degenerated into
military dictatorship.
Perhaps the only consoling
feature of our present situation is
that it is highly probable that the
American military could produce
a man of the caliber of Julius
Caesar.

incident from the list of political
assassinations, systematic
torturing, mass deportations, and
mere "unfortunate mistakes"
which comprise so large a part of
our glorious military record in the
Vietnam War.
Yet the circumstances
surrounding the alleged Green
Beret murder of a Vietnamese
double agent provoke a singular
repugnance; there can be no
clearer indication of the moral
bankruptcy of our government,
no better instance of what the war
has done to undermine the
confidence of the American
people in that government.
The whole affair has a
Man-from-Uncle air about it. On
the basis of newspaper reports,
the story appears to be a sordid
one. The killing was ordered
mysteriously from on high; one of
the six accused Berets wrote to his
wife, "The powers to be decided
to do away with him [ the victim J.
Being the people involved, it was
up to us to come up with a plan
and execute it." Something went
wrong, however, between the
military command in Vietnam and
the CIA, and the dutiful
executioners were charged with
murder. With publicity mounting
and the defense adamant on the
involvement of the CIA, the White
House intervened, and Army
Secretary Rasor announced that

the charges were being dropped.
The explanation for the complete
reversal- of Rasor's position of
eleven days earlier: the CIA
refused, "in the interest of
national security," to provide the
court with witnesses, and a fair
trial was now impossible for the
defendants.
Justice and Ihe Courts
The decision to sweep the
matter under the rug will
probably prevent us from
knowing what actually occurred
in the citadels of power where the
fate of the accused was decided,
but one point is clear: the highest
level of the government
bureaucracy may simply choose
to ignore the traditional American
"rule of law" whenever that rule
conflicts with the logic of
personal power or elite-defined
"national interest".
The Beret case simply
symbolizes the perverted justice
dispensed by the American legal
system. Our courts can send the
best men of our generation to
prison for refusing to join the
slaughter in Vietnam, and at the
same time, to the applause of the
House of Representatives, can
return to duty a crew of trained
murderers.
"Conspirators" Spock, Coffin,
and the Chicago Eight are
prosecuted by their judges, and
policeman Michael O'Brien
defended by his. The drunk cops
who shot up the Panther
headquarters receive one-year
suspended sentences, while an
A3M student gets a fine and thirty
days for his Hanover Street
slogan-painting.
Those who attempt to base a
political career, campus or
otherwise, on the platitudes of
"change-through-the-system" and
"respect-for-constitutional
process" must be reminded of the
corruption and political bias of
our courts. The decline of the
"rule of law" is, in our society, a
critical phenomenon. Under
similar circumstances the Roman
republic, also founded on the
concept of law, degenerated into
military dictatorship.
Perhaps the only consoling
feature of our present situation is
that it is highly probable that the
American military could produce
a man of the caliber of Julius
Caesar.
