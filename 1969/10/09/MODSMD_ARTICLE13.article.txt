# Tournee Of Animation
## Films Explore New Techniques 
### TODD FLINCHBAUGH 
The success of the Beatles'
"Yellow Submarine" has created
new hope for public interest in
the art of animation. The
animated film has always had an
advantage over photographed
film in its lack of dependence on
physical reality for its images,
and the possibility for an
animator to create a unique
vision, a solitary effort unlike
the corporate ventures of the
film studios.
Unfortunately, since the
thirties, Americans have
associated animation with Walt
Disney's attempts at realism and
assembly-line production.
Viewing the output of other
countries and of a few animators
in the U.S.A. ought to cause
anyone to revise the "Disney
version," and the opportunity to
do so will come this weekend
when the Department of
Communication presents the
Second International Tournee of
Animation.
Like the first Tournee,
presented here this summer, this
is a collection of short animated
films selected by judges from
competitions held round the
world. The present showing
includes 19 films from nine
different countries. The films are
made available throughout the
United States by the Tournee of
Animation, a non-profit support
group dedicated to making
quality animated films available
to interested organizations.
The program is outstanding
for its experimentation in a
variety of animation techniques.
It includes a fine abstract
computer film, a puppet film, a
fil vith cut-out paper objects,
aiiu the first film made
completely from carbon dust
particles.
Especially remarkable for its
style is Sirenc, by Raoul Servais
of Belgium. The setting is an
ominous harbor dominated by
towering cranes and trange
winged creatures. The use of
lines and colors looks like fine
lithography and the color and
design create the oppressive
atmosphere of the harbor.
Visually this is one of the most
impressive animations ever
produced.
Richard Williams' Charge of
Ihe Light Brigade, is not nearly
so revolutionary as the two films
mentioned above, but it
nonetheless brings out new
potentials in the field of
animation. The film may be
familiar: it is the animated
portions of the Tony Richardson
feature of the same name, and
consists of 19th century political
films come to life. The success
of this film suggests future
possibilities in this field. Maybe
someone will do Herblock or
David Levine in animation?
Another pleasant film is The
Great Walled City of Xan, by
Hal Barwood. The bright colors
and designs of the city suggest
the magical powers inherent in
the city of Xan. Made by a
graduate student at the
University of Southern
California, the film is more than

just an outstanding example of
student work; it bears
comparison with the best films
in the collection.
Variety in technique and
creativity do not exclude humor
from this group of films.
K-9000: A Space Oddity, by
Robert Mitchell and Robert
Swarthe, provides a fine change
of peace as it chronicles the
adventures of a canine space
traveller in a world strongly
influenced by Stanley Kubrick
and George Melies, pioneer of
the science-fiction form. Its
unrestrained humor brings back
the tone of American animation
in the early thirties, before the
studies became self-conscious.
The resulting combination of
style and humor makes for a
highly entertaining two hours of
film viewing that effectively
suggests some of the future
potential of the animated film as
an art form.
There will be three showings,
all in Memorial Auditorium.
Friday's only showing will be at
8 P.M., and on Saturday the
films will be shown at 7:30 and
10:00. Admission is $1.50.
Children under 12 admitted
free!
