# Doubled Up
## The 						Best In The West 
### Marshall Schwartz 
Never give up, they say. So,
after West nearly gave away a
doubled contract with his opening
lead, he came back strong to
defeat the bid with a little help
from declarer. The hand comes
from the Men's Pairs
championship at the Santa Monica
sectional tournament last month.
The bidding is fairly standard.
North-South were not opening
four card majors, so South bid his
bettor minor. West was a little
surprised to find another opening
bid at the table. He merely
doubled, intending to correct to
spades if partner bid clubs (17
points is required to take a bid in
a new suit after doubling—as I
wish some of my partners would
realize—and West's hand satisfies
this requirement).
After North's diamond raise
blocked East from bidding hearts,
West now stepped in with his
five-card spade suit. South,
holding good spades but poor
diamonds, decided to try 2 NT.
West correctly decided his
diamond stoppers would give him
time to establish a major—he
wasn't sure which was best —and
doubled.
When North corrected back to
diamonds, West felt impelled to
double this, too.
The opening lead was a disaster,
giving away the defense's one
heart trick. West looked sheepish,
and mentally chalked up a bottom
board. But now declarer led a low
trump from dummy, and put in
his jack, West attempting to

falsecard by winning with the ace.
After staring at dummy for some
time, he finally led out the ace of
spades, hoping partner had the
king. East began an echo,, but
when the board's jack won the
spade continuation, West slipped
deeper into his pall of gloom.
However, declarer continued
his original line of thinking,
leading another low trump from
the board, and, playing for split
honors, rose with the queen from
his hand—which West was forced
to win.
Suddenly, West saw a faint ray
of hope—partner might have the
nine of diamonds, and another
spade lead would uppercut

dummy. So a spade was led.
Declarer stared at the board for a
while, finally decided that West
had the last trump. He discarded a
club from dummy, and, looked
sad when East ruffed with the
nine (West breathing a huge sigh
of relief) and cashed the club ace
for the setting trick.

Of course, if declarer at any
time decides to overtake a winner
in dummy and lead trumps from
his hand—or even lead low from
board and duck the trick to
West—he will make the hand after
the unfortunate opening lead. For
now he can ruff spades high on
board, and use his remaining
honor in hand to draw the last
trump.

So, being given the contract
with the opening lead, South gave
it right back. Of course, if West
opens a spade—of the ace of
hearts and switches to a
spade—the contract will now be
off two tricks. But West wasn't
interested in that—he was happy
enough to have escaped with a
plus score.

his hand—which West was forced
to win.
Suddenly, West saw a faint ray
of hope—partner might have the
nine of diamonds, and another
spade lead would uppercut

dummy. So a spade was led.
Declarer stared at the board for a
while, finally decided that West
had the last trump. He discarded a
club from dummy, and, looked
sad when East ruffed with the
nine (West breathing a huge sigh
of relief) and cashed the club ace
for the setting trick.

Of course, if declarer at any
time decides to overtake a winner
in dummy and lead trumps from
his hand—or even lead low from
board and duck the trick to
West—he will make the hand after
the unfortunate opening lead. For
now he can ruff spades high on
board, and use his remaining
honor in hand to draw the last
trump.

So, being given the contract
with the opening lead, South gave
it right back. Of course, if West
opens a spade—of the ace of
hearts and switches to a
spade—the contract will now be
off two tricks. But West wasn't
interested in that—he was happy
enough to have escaped with a
plus score.

Never give up, they say. So,
after West nearly gave away a
doubled contract with his opening
lead, he came back strong to
defeat the bid with a little help
from declarer. The hand comes
from the Men's Pairs
championship at the Santa Monica
sectional tournament last month.
The bidding is fairly standard.
North-South were not opening
four card majors, so South bid his
bettor minor. West was a little
surprised to find another opening
bid at the table. He merely
doubled, intending to correct to
spades if partner bid clubs (17
points is required to take a bid in
a new suit after doubling—as I
wish some of my partners would
realize—and West's hand satisfies
this requirement).
After North's diamond raise
blocked East from bidding hearts,
West now stepped in with his
five-card spade suit. South,
holding good spades but poor
diamonds, decided to try 2 NT.
West correctly decided his
diamond stoppers would give him
time to establish a major—he
wasn't sure which was best —and
doubled.
When North corrected back to
diamonds, West felt impelled to
double this, too.
The opening lead was a disaster,
giving away the defense's one
heart trick. West looked sheepish,
and mentally chalked up a bottom
board. But now declarer led a low
trump from dummy, and put in
his jack, West attempting to

falsecard by winning with the ace.
After staring at dummy for some
time, he finally led out the ace of
spades, hoping partner had the
king. East began an echo,, but
when the board's jack won the
spade continuation, West slipped
deeper into his pall of gloom.
However, declarer continued
his original line of thinking,
leading another low trump from
the board, and, playing for split
honors, rose with the queen from
his hand—which West was forced
to win.
