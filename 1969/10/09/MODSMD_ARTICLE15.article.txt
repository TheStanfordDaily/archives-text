# Liberation Group Discusses Role Of Women In Society
## 
### EILEEN HALEY 
"I didn't go to the Women's
Liberation meeting Tuesday
night because I figured it would
be a bunch of masculine
"liberated" women bitching
about their social life"
commented a student.
Strangely enough, I had some
of the same vague reservations. I
didn't want to be told I was
oppressed or that I should join
in the struggle against male
domination.
But the tone was totally
differentâ€”it wasn't antagonistic
or bitter. The speakers didn't
blame men for all their
problems . . .they spoke of the
dilemma confronting women as
related to the whole of society's
problems.
"If women are liberated, our
whole society will collapse" was
Judy Strasser's summary of
"McCall's" statement on
women's liberation. Judy didn't
think such an occurrence would
be a bad thing. Mary Lou
Greenberg agreed, pointing out
that "all women can't be free
until there are no classes in this
society."

Other speakers who addressed
the group were Janet Weiss,
Sarah Wolfe, and Susan Lawyer.
Although the need for women
to get involved politically and
socially as a united group was
stressed, there was also emphasis
on the value of small group
discussions for women to talk
out their personal problems. One

of the participants mentioned a
reluctance to become identified
with a stereotyped "feminist"
movement, but felt that
Women's Liberation represented
a chance for women not only to
work together on political and
social change, but to form
valuable relationships with other
women.
