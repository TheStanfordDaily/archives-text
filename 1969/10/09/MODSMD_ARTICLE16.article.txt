# Children's Hospital To Mark 50-Year Operation
## 
### 
The new eight unit Stanford
Children's Convalescent Hospital
will be dedicated tomorrow at
4:00 P.M. on the Hospital's 26
acre site at 520 Willow Road in
Palo Alto. Harry L. Haehl,
president, Stanford Children's
Convalescent Hospital will
preside.
The dedicatory speaker will be
Dwight L. Wilbur, M.D.,
immediate past president of the
American Medical Association,
who will speak on "The Next
Fifty Yearsâ€”A Prescription for
the Future." Forty-nine years ago
in 1920 when Dr. Wilbur's father,
the late Ray Lyman Wilbur, M.D.,
was president of Stanford
University, he gave the dedication
address when the old Leland
Stanford residence built in 1870,
was turned over by the University
as the first operational unit of
what has become the present
highly specialized and nationally
recognized hospital for the care of
chronically ill and physically
handicapped children.
The Dedication is the first of a
series of "Golden Anniversary
Years" commemorative events to
be held at the new hospital. "In
marriage one is fortunate to
celebrate one golden anniversary,"
Mr. Haehl said. "In 1969, we are
celebrating the formal founding of
the Hospital which occurred in
1919.
The invocation will be given by
Reverend R.M. Minto, Chaplain,
Stanford University. Reverend
Minto was a close associate cf the
Reverend D. Charles Gardner, one
of the original co-founders of the
Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children.
A highlight of the Dedication
will be the introduction of four
new Board Members recently
appointed to the Hospital's
governing body. They are, Albert
J. Horn of Burlingame, Daniel G.
Minto of San Mateo Everett D.
Myers of San Jose, and Mrs.
Donald N. Pritzker of Atherton.
Awards of Merit will be
presented to Professor J. Pearce
Mitchell, Mildred Hayes Roth and
Harold K. Faber, M.D.
Collectively, these three
individuals have devoted 144
years of dedicated service to the
Hospital.
Music for the occasion will be
provided for the Stanford
Renaissance Wind Band under the
direction of George Houle.
Following Dr. Wilbur's
dedication address the hospital
will hold an open house and
welcome those attending the
Dedication to all departments of
the new hospital.

Among the buildings to be
dedicated Friday are the Lionel R.
Lenox Building which houses the
hospital's new and enlarged
diagnostic, treatment and
rehabilitation center. This
building was made possible be a
generous gift from Alice Ruth
Lenox, a long time resident of San
Jose, who passed away last
February. During lis lifetime,
Lionel R. Lenox was an esteemed
member of the Chemistry
Department of Stanford
University.
Another building to be
dedicated is the Ira S. Lillick
Building which houses the
Hospital's administrative and
business offices. Mr. Lillick during
his lifetime, was a prominent
attorney in San Francisco and
served on the Board of Directors
of the Stanford Children's
Convalescent Hospital from 1922
until his retirement in 1962. He
was president of the Board from
1936 until his retirement.
The Mildred Hayes
Roth-Auxiliaries' Pavilion, one of
the four large units providing
living quarters for inpatients, was
made possible through xhe fund
raising efforts of members of the
six Auxiliaries to the Hospital.
The Auxiliaries contributed over

$500,000 to the present building
program.
The $5,000,000 building and
development project was
undertaken by the Hospital's
Board following condemnation of
the old structures by State and
Federal officials who found the
old buildings "no longer suitable
for occupancy by ill and crippled
children."
