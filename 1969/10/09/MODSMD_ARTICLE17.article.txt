# Interamurals Begin
## 
### SCOTT BURNS 
Another year of exciting intramural sports has
begun. This quarter eight sports are being offered
for participation, while the ninth planned sport,
boxing, has been cancelled until later in the year
because of the lack of a ring. Touch football,
freethrows, golf, doubles tennis, two man
volleyball, bowling, and pocket billiards all have
started competition while the cross country meet
won't be until October 31st.Teams should consult
the schedules posted outside the IM office
immediately.
Dutch Fehring, starting his third year as
Director of Intramurals and Club Sports, heads up
what could be one of the best organized IM
programs in the US. He has six student assistants
working under him, and each is in charge of a
various sport. They include Dave Mantooth
(football), Dave Schaeffer (crosscountry,
volleyball), Gary Garland (freethrows, golf), Marc
Wilson (tennis), John Ritchey (football officials,
billiards), and Ralph Kimball (bowling). Either Mr.
Fehring or the individual student in charge of the
sport should be contacted when a question arises.
The health center is offering better coverage of
intramurals this year. Connie Jarvis, an
ex-Stanford trainer now with the health center,
will be on duty every day in the IM office to take
care of injuries, and he will also other limited

taping and wrapping before contests (from
3:30-4:00 o'clock) for those who need it.
The only main intramural rule changes from last
year are in the area of organization affiliation.
First of all, if your campus unit affiliation, like a
living group or graduate department, has a team
entered in one sport, you can only play for that
team, plus a player may not compete for more
than one unit during the same quarter. Another
new rule states that only one member of a club
sport, like volleyball, is permitted per team. Also,
independent groups and off campus teams must
obtain approval from the IM Director prior to
entering the competition.
If there are any questions about any part of
intramurals, contact the IM office in Encina Gym,
(ex. 1270), and for a good guide to the ruler and
regulations of the IM sports, pick up an Intramural
Handbook at the IM office.

billiards), and Ralph Kimball (bowling). Either Mr.
Fehring or the individual student in charge of the
sport should be contacted when a question arises.
The health center is offering better coverage of
intramurals this year. Connie Jarvis, an
ex-Stanford trainer now with the health center,
will be on duty every day in the IM office to take
care of injuries, and he will also other limited

taping and wrapping before contests (from
3:30-4:00 o'clock) for those who need it.
The only main intramural rule changes from last
year are in the area of organization affiliation.
First of all, if your campus unit affiliation, like a
living group or graduate department, has a team
entered in one sport, you can only play for that
team, plus a player may not compete for more
than one unit during the same quarter. Another
new rule states that only one member of a club
sport, like volleyball, is permitted per team. Also,
independent groups and off campus teams must
obtain approval from the IM Director prior to
entering the competition.
If there are any questions about any part of
intramurals, contact the IM office in Encina Gym,
(ex. 1270), and for a good guide to the ruler and
regulations of the IM sports, pick up an Intramural
Handbook at the IM office.
