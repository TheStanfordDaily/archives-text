# UCLA
## Scouting Report 
### FRED MANN 
(Fifth in a six pari series)
Tommy Prothro is a winner. He has proved it in Tennessee, in
Oregon, and now in Southern California. He masterminds his football
teams and out thinks other coaches.
So when UCLA ended last season with a lowly 3-7 record (one
victory being a 20-17 gift win over Stanford), people in Los Angeles
were flabbergasted. Gary Beban had gone and apparently had taken
with him the UCLA magic that had made champions out of what
normally would have been simply "good teams."
But Coach Prothro was not dismayed. He knew this year would be
different. With an adequate quarterback and a lot of thought, he
could build another winner. Dennis Dummit is more than adequate,
and UCLA may be more than just another winner this season. They
have a good shot for the Rose Bowl and could end up as one of the
top ten teams in the country.
Flanked 11th in the latest AP poll, the Bruins are challenging for
the Pac-8 title as well as the championship of Los Angeles. Stanford
joins the two LA schools this year as a favorite in the race for the the
league crown.
Just like their cross-town rivals, USC, UCLA has found their new
strength through the junior college transfer. Both big recruiting schools
take utmost advantage of California's JC system. The new find for the
Bruins this time is quarterback Dummit.
In UCLA's four games thus far, Dummit has been very effective. He
ranks second in the Pac-8 in total offense and passing (Jim Plunkett is
first in both), and has led the Westwooders to a 4-0 the
help of Prothro and the schedule.
The UCLA football season will not begin for real until next
weekend when they play California. So far the Bruins have met up
with perhaps the weakest college teams ever assembled. After an
opening game rout over pitiful Oregon State (who has since
improved), they met Pittsburgh (1-9 last year), Wisconsin (0-10),
Northwestern (1-9), and on Saturday, Washington State (3-6-1).
Therefore, UCLA is yet to be really tested. Dummit can throw, but
he's never had a real defense to contend with. His receivers are
excellent, especially Gwen Cooper and George Farmer, but they also
are yet to sec a really good pass coverage.
The Bruin offensive line is very talented as they proved against
Oregon State. Last year, the line was a big weakness, but Steve Preston
and Greg McLandrich have tightened up the unit which gives Dummit
good protection to throw (when he has to), and opens up tremendous
holes for the two best running backs in the league.
Greg Jones, the senior tailback, and Mickey Cureton, the junior
fullback can be awesome together, and have been known to run
opponents into the ground. Cureton has slimmed down to 180 lbs.,
the lightest since his high school days when he was twice All-America
and twice CIF Player of the Year. His quickness getting through he
line is unbelievable, and he is also a squirming, twisting type runner,
much like Bubba Brown of the Indians.
If anyone is going to stop UCLA, they must stop their running
game.
Predicted finish: Tie lor 2nd.
