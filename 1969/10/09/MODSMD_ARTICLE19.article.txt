# 'The Team To Beat'
## No O.J., But Trojans Healthy 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
One day last winter, shortly
after the conclusion of the
football season, John Ralston was
having lunch at an Eating Club.
After the meal, in a discussion
about Stanford's prospects for the
1969 season, talk turned to the
inevitable: USC's Trojans.
"Sure, they've lost Simpson,"
Ralston remarked, "but they're
still going to be the team to beat."
The prediction, of course, was
accurate. The marvelously gifted
Simpson has indeed gone on to
the brighter lights, greater glory
and more lucrative endorsements
of professional football but the
Trojans have unveiled a
sophomore quarterback named
Jimmy Jones and have breezed to
three wins so far this season.
USC thus comes into Saturday
night's game with Stanford with

bo til an impressive national
ranking (fourth in the latest
Associated Press poll) and an 11
game win streak, dating back to
1958, over the Indians. Stanford
has been ranked 16th nationally
and has a £-1 record. Both teams
have won their only conference
game thus far this season.
The game starts at 8:00 p.m. in
the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum.
Although Trojan coach John
McKay seemed rankled earlier this
week when told that his team
would be favored by nine and cn.c
half points ("We'd be favored
against the Rams"), AP sage Will
Grimsley predicted from New
York yesterday that Stanford
would upset USC, 28-21.
But regardless of the
predictions, there is little doubt

that the contest will match two
powerful offensive units a id that
a victory will be crucial to any
team wishing to go to the Rose
Bowl.
Last week the Trojans ground
out an impressive 31-7 win over
Oregon State in what McKay
termed "the best game in some
time" for his team. Trojan junior
Clarence Davis was named
Pacific-8 Back of the Week after
gaining 181 yards in 29 carries
against the Beavers. Although no
0.J., Davis leads the league with
460 yards gained and leads all
Trojan scorers with three
touchdowns. And Jones, although
no Jim Plunkett, has thrown six
TD's and is fast gaining respect.
The Indians, of course, aren't
exactly hurting for offense. The
Tribe chalked up 586 offensive
yards and five TD's against Purdue
last week (losing 36-35 on a
two-point conversion) and QB
Plunkett established a new
Stanford and Pac-8 record of 416
total yards in one game, breaking
the marks of 389 yards set by
Terry Baker of Oregon State in
1962.
This week's Pac-8 statistics
attest to the suspicion that the

Coliseum game will be one to
remember. Stanford leads the
league in total offense, passing
offense and rushing defense and
are tied with USC for the rushing
offense lead. But the Trojans
move into the total defense lcr>d.

Last year, of course, Simpson
gained 220 yards in a remarkable
47 carries and scored three TD's
while leading USC to a thrilling
27-24 win over the Indians. The
Indians plan to reverse the
outcome on Saturday.

Trojan scorers with three
touchdowns. And Jones, although
no Jim Plunkett, has thrown six
TD's and is fast gaining respect.
The Indians, of course, aren't
exactly hurting for offense. The
Tribe chalked up 586 offensive
yards and five TD's against Purdue
last week (losing 36-35 on a
two-point conversion) and QB
Plunkett established a new
Stanford and Pac-8 record of 416
total yards in one game, breaking
the marks of 389 yards set by
Terry Baker of Oregon State in
1962.
This week's Pac-8 statistics
attest to the suspicion that the

Coliseum game will be one to
remember. Stanford leads the
league in total offense, passing
offense and rushing defense and
are tied with USC for the rushing
offense lead. But the Trojans
move into the total defense lcr>d.

Last year, of course, Simpson
gained 220 yards in a remarkable
47 carries and scored three TD's
while leading USC to a thrilling
27-24 win over the Indians. The
Indians plan to reverse the
outcome on Saturday.
One day last winter, shortly
after the conclusion of the
football season, John Ralston was
having lunch at an Eating Club.
After the meal, in a discussion
about Stanford's prospects for the
1969 season, talk turned to the
inevitable: USC's Trojans.
"Sure, they've lost Simpson,"
Ralston remarked, "but they're
still going to be the team to beat."
The prediction, of course, was
accurate. The marvelously gifted
Simpson has indeed gone on to
the brighter lights, greater glory
and more lucrative endorsements
of professional football but the
Trojans have unveiled a
sophomore quarterback named
Jimmy Jones and have breezed to
three wins so far this season.
USC thus comes into Saturday
night's game with Stanford with

bo til an impressive national
ranking (fourth in the latest
Associated Press poll) and an 11
game win streak, dating back to
1958, over the Indians. Stanford
has been ranked 16th nationally
and has a £-1 record. Both teams
have won their only conference
game thus far this season.
The game starts at 8:00 p.m. in
the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum.
Although Trojan coach John
McKay seemed rankled earlier this
week when told that his team
would be favored by nine and cn.c
half points ("We'd be favored
against the Rams"), AP sage Will
Grimsley predicted from New
York yesterday that Stanford
would upset USC, 28-21.
But regardless of the
predictions, there is little doubt

that the contest will match two
powerful offensive units a id that
a victory will be crucial to any
team wishing to go to the Rose
Bowl.
Last week the Trojans ground
out an impressive 31-7 win over
Oregon State in what McKay
termed "the best game in some
time" for his team. Trojan junior
Clarence Davis was named
Pacific-8 Back of the Week after
gaining 181 yards in 29 carries
against the Beavers. Although no
0.J., Davis leads the league with
460 yards gained and leads all
Trojan scorers with three
touchdowns. And Jones, although
no Jim Plunkett, has thrown six
TD's and is fast gaining respect.
