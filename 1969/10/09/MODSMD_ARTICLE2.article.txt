# Rising Costs Force Escondido Rent Hike
## 
### ED KOHN 
Residents of Escondido Village
recently were informed that their
rents would be increased by about
six and three-quarter percent
annually for the next five years.
Ned Gallagher, director of the
village, told residents there that
the raise could be attributed to "a
sharp rise in interest rates and
construction costs" of the
Escondido IV project.
The new rent schedule, which
went into effect this fall, sets a
base price of $107 for a single
bedroom apartment including
utilities and provides a ceiling of
$139 for a three bedroom low-rise
unit for the 1969-70 academic
year.
Escondido residents are
displeased with the new rates,
which, over the course of five
years, could boost the cost of
some of the larger apartments to
$175 a month.
Tuesday afternoon, A 1 Spector,
a fourth year graduate student in
law and business, presented a
proposal to a committee including
the Dean of Students that would
raise all the rents in the village to
a level comparable with Palo Alto
and the Midpeninsula area.
Indiscriminate Subsidies
The proposal included a "need
test" whereby students would pay
in rough accordance with their
income. Thus, according to
Spector, a student who is
receiving a $200 monthly stipend
from the University and whose
wife is employed might have to
pay $175 for an apartment, while
another student who is receiving a
smaller grant from the University
and whose wife cannot work
might pay only $90.
Spector, who said he objected
to the University's policy of
granting "indiscriminate

subsidies" to all students who can
be accommodated in the village,
thought that the idea might be
applicable to all of the dorms. The
plan that he presented, however,
dealt only with Escondido Village.
In a discussion last night, he
stated that if his program were
put into effect, the average
student would end up paying
about the same rent, while those
who could afford to pay more
would do so.
No Recent Increase
Ed Scoles, assistant business
manager for university housing,
said that the last rent increase in
the village was a 1963
across-the-board increase of $15
per apartment.
Construction costs for the new
project are substantially higher
than they were when the other
major complexes in the
development were built.
Escondido Four, scheduled for
occupancy in 1970, will house
more than 600 students, with at
least half of the units available for
single students.
University Business Manager
Dwight Adams said that the
University planned an "annual
review of need for the increase"
but seemed confident that "we
anticipate it will not be more; it
may even be less." He suggested
that one way to overcome the
rising costs of renting housing in
the village would be to increase
the monies paid to the students
by the University.
He also pointed to the
advisability of applying a "need
test," similar to the one proposed
by Spector, to residents of the
village saying that "equality with
respect to ability to pay is the
greatest concern."

He stressed that anyone would
be allowed to live in the area; he
would suggest pro-rating rents on
the individual's ability to pay.
Cost of Living
Adams attributed the increase
more to the rising cost of living
than to the expense of building
Escondido IV. He said that the
University reviews the tuition,
room and board rates every year,
and that it raises the rates during
alternate school years.
Since all students contribute to
a housing fund pool to broaden
the expenditure base, Adams said
that Escondido's rents were
simply being brought into line
with what the rest of the
University is paying for
on-campus housing.
He said that part of the increase
was due to the University's desire
to maintain as many services as
possible for the Escondido
residents and that the cost of
these services increases yearly.
Thus, he said, with the cost of
living increasing at such a rapid
rate it is impossible for the
University to maintain rents at a
fixed base year after year. Adams
also said that the higher interest
rates increased the amount of the
raise by "only about three
quarters to one percent."
Although there have been
rumblings of a possible rent strike
in the village, Mrs. Sandy Rickard,
president of the Village Council,
played these down, saying that
most residents were more
concerned with their academic
workloads. The matter now rests
in committee; a mutually
acceptable agreement is expected
to be worked out by residents of
Escondido and the Dean of
Student's office.
