# Netmen Gain From Summer Competition
## 
### HALL DAILY 
While summer months provide
a rest from collegiate sports for
spectators and participating
athletes alike, summer offers
tennis players of all calibers a
proving ground through sectional,
national, and continental
tournament circuits.
After Stanford's frosh-studded
tennis squadron captured eighth
spot in the NCAA finals last
season, most of the varsity
proceeded to their summer
hunting grounds throughout the
North American and European
continents. And the results bear
out the fact that the summer's
tennis season was indeed a busy
"Indian Summer."
Juniors Bill Atkins of San
Francisco and Paul Marienthal of
Los Angeles and sophomore Ma*.'
Claflin of Coral Gables, Flroida,
all competed on the European
tour this past summer. Atkins,
having played number four as
sophomore, successfully gained
valuable experience in tournament
play and will be a key man in the
Indians' 1970 chances.
Marienthal, ailing from a sore
elbow last season, played several
European tourneys and spent a
great deal of time working to
improve his doubles game.
Chaflin, who is currently at
Stanford in Germany, began the
summer by reaching the finals of
the Orange Bowl doubles
competition. Mac teamed with
Paul Gerken to gain the finals of
this tournament, the largest
international Junior's title. He has
also played several European
tournaments.
John Wright of Fullerton,
California, while competing on
the United States Junior Circuit,
paired with Claflin to upset Clark
Graebner and Allen Fox at the
National Hardcourt
Championships. On the Eastern
tennis tour, both Stan Pasarell
from Caparra Hts., P.R. and Rob
Daugherty of Rochester,
Minnesota, sharpened up their
respective play. Stan, who was
plagued with severe back muscle
problems last year, took his last
two months off in an effort to
rest his back. Pasarell will play a
crucial role in Stanford hopes
during the upcoming year.
Rick Evans of San Diego and
Robin Fry of Springfield, Ohio,

both toured the Southern and
Midwestern Men's circuits in
efforts to improve their positions
at Stanford by gaining topflight
tournament experience.
Under the adept tutelage of
Coach Dick Gould, the Indians
could easily improve over last
year's performance and be a major
contender for both conference
and national intercollegiate net
titles.
