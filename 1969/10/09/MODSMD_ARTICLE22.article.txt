# Harriers Still Undefeated
## 
### 
The question to be answered by the 1969 cross country season is
not one of how good is Stanford. Instead it's one of just how far the
Tribe will go.
Already the Indian harriers, undefeated in league competition last
year and surprise second-place finishers at the NCAA championships,
field a formidable team.
To start, senior co-captains Chuch Menz and Greg Brock join junior
Don Kardong to form an experienced nucleus from the 1968 team.
Brock was named All-American for his finish in the top 20 at the
NCAA finals and Menz and Kardong climbed to sixth and eighth
respectively last autumn on the all-time Stanford list for the 4.2 mile
home course.
In last Saturday's time trial Kardong, Menz and Brock were
accompanied by sophomores Robert Coe and Arvid Kretz in a
five-abreast first place tie in 20:48. The other two varisty places
tentatively go to sophomore Jack Lawson (21:12) and freshman
(eligible this season under the new NCAA rules) Decker Underwood
(21:17), state high school mile champ from South Torrance.
"We feel performance-wise we'll have a strong team," says Coach
Marshall Clark, "but whether we'll do as well record-wise is tough to
say."
A new obstacle for an attempted Stanford return to the NCAA
meet will be the first PAC-8 cross country championship race to be
run on the Indian six mile course Nov. 15.
So Stanford will not only have to face UCLA, USC, and California
for a second time at the PAC-8 meet, but also the likes of Washington
State, which has been granted another year of cross country eligibility
for Gerry Lindgren, and Oregon, whose extensive track fame in the
last decade has come almost exclusively from its excellent distance
runners.
But the PAC-8 meet is six weeks away and the Indians face separate
obstacles each weekend until then, starting this Saturday with the
13th Annual Sacramento St. Invitational in which Stanford will run
varsity, Brave (JV) and frosh teams. Last year the Tribe won the open
division with 49 points to USC's 50.
Following Saturday's bring showdowns with USC, UCLA, San Jose
State and California, the UCLA and Cal meets being at Stanford Oct.
25 and Nov. 7.
The emphasis in cross country is as a team sport, and only if the
whole team excells will the individuals who comprise it get another
run at the All-America honors awarded at the NCAA meet.

Brock was named All-American for his finish in the top 20 at the
NCAA finals and Menz and Kardong climbed to sixth and eighth
respectively last autumn on the all-time Stanford list for the 4.2 mile
home course.
In last Saturday's time trial Kardong, Menz and Brock were
accompanied by sophomores Robert Coe and Arvid Kretz in a
five-abreast first place tie in 20:48. The other two varisty places
tentatively go to sophomore Jack Lawson (21:12) and freshman
(eligible this season under the new NCAA rules) Decker Underwood
(21:17), state high school mile champ from South Torrance.
"We feel performance-wise we'll have a strong team," says Coach
Marshall Clark, "but whether we'll do as well record-wise is tough to
say."
A new obstacle for an attempted Stanford return to the NCAA
meet will be the first PAC-8 cross country championship race to be
run on the Indian six mile course Nov. 15.
So Stanford will not only have to face UCLA, USC, and California
for a second time at the PAC-8 meet, but also the likes of Washington
State, which has been granted another year of cross country eligibility
for Gerry Lindgren, and Oregon, whose extensive track fame in the
last decade has come almost exclusively from its excellent distance
runners.
But the PAC-8 meet is six weeks away and the Indians face separate
obstacles each weekend until then, starting this Saturday with the
13th Annual Sacramento St. Invitational in which Stanford will run
varsity, Brave (JV) and frosh teams. Last year the Tribe won the open
division with 49 points to USC's 50.
Following Saturday's bring showdowns with USC, UCLA, San Jose
State and California, the UCLA and Cal meets being at Stanford Oct.
25 and Nov. 7.
The emphasis in cross country is as a team sport, and only if the
whole team excells will the individuals who comprise it get another
run at the All-America honors awarded at the NCAA meet.
The question to be answered by the 1969 cross country season is
not one of how good is Stanford. Instead it's one of just how far the
Tribe will go.
Already the Indian harriers, undefeated in league competition last
year and surprise second-place finishers at the NCAA championships,
field a formidable team.
To start, senior co-captains Chuch Menz and Greg Brock join junior
Don Kardong to form an experienced nucleus from the 1968 team.
