# Frosh Boast Bumper Crop Of Top QB's

### CLIFF NANCARROW 
It will be back to pads and helmet banging this week as Coach Bill
Moultrie's frosh football squad gets down to the business of finding
out who's going to play where in preparation for the first game with
USC on October 17.
"We've spent the first four days conditioning and putting in the
basic offense and defense," said Coach Moultrie, now in his second
season on the Stanford staff and his first as head freshman coach.
"As far as I can see, we've got 54 eager young men out here who
want to play football. And with our great staff of coaches, I couldn't
be more excited about the season."
Reading down the roster gives one good cause to be excited.
Coming off outstanding high school careers and now vying for berths
on the frosh eleven are Eric Cross, leading ground gainer in Northern
California, and Barry Curry, who broke Gary Beban's total offense
record at Sequoia High in Redwood City.
The frosh also feature "five or six of the best signal-calling prospects
in recent years," including Steve Murray, Jesse Freitas, Patrick Moore,
Jim Wise, Scott Boughton, and Mike Boryla.
But Coach Moultrie was careful to add that "All positions are wide
open and will be filled only when earned."
It should be quite a fight. Though generally lighter at all spots than
frosh teams of the past, this year's Papooses are quick and "are all
fired up and ready to go. We'll take what we've got and we'll make
what we want," smiled Moultrie.
The Papooses face a tough four game schedule that includes USC,
the Baby Bruins of UCLA, the Sar. Jose Frosh, and the Little Big
Game with the Bear Cubs of Berkeley.
"We'll put our best eleven athletes on the field, those who want to
play the most, and we're going to win some football games,"
concluded Moultrie. "It should be a good year."
In fact, the only spot where the freshmen team is definitely hurting
is at manager. Any and all candidates should contact Coach Moultrie
or head varsity manager, John Wright.
