Folksinger Pete Seeger, Bishop
J. Kilmer Myers, and Congressman
Paul N. (Pete) McCloskey Jr.
are among the headliners
scheduled lor a Population
Explosion Conference of high
school students on Saturday, Oct.
18.
Groups from 60 California high
schools totaling over 1,000
students will attend a day-long
meeting sponsored by the
California Science Teachers
Association and the Biological
Sciences Department.
President Kenneth Pitzer,
noted population biologist Paul
Ehrlich, and Chairman Donald
Kennedy of the Biology
Department also will speak to the
high schoolers. The conferees will
include sessions for debate and
adoption of resolutions by the
youthful conferees.
Erica Schoenberger, a
Menlo-Atherton High School
senior, and George Pegelow,
Stanford administrator, are
co-chairmen of the conference.
The conference committee
includes Willow Glen High School
students Ray Coronado, Mick
Lange, Fred Parkin, Roger Pettit,
and teacher Frank Schiavo;
teachers Don granholm of
Cubberly High School, Martin
Marcus of Peninsula School, Harry
Wong of Menlo-Atherton; and Dr.
John Thomas of Stanford.
"The world population now
stands at more than 3.5 billion
persons, an all-time record," says
a committee statement. "If the
present upward trend
continues —and there is no reason
to suspect it won't—by the turn of
the century, this figure will have
doubled."

The 1969 West Coast tour of
the Paul Taylor Dance Company
will begin with two performances
at 8:30 p.m. Oct. 13 and 15 in
Memorial Auditorium.
Hailed as one of the most
creative and "fun" companies in
the world of contemporary dance,
the Tayjor company will perform
a wide variety of works spanning
Taylor's career as one of this
country's dominant
choreographers.

Taylor, like many of his
contemporaries, is a disciple of
Martha Graham who has found his
own direction. The forte of the
Taylor company is its ability to
see humor in almost any situation
and to translate this humor into
both literal and abstract dance
forms. It is this emphasis on the
humorous aspects of existence
that prompted the dance critic
from the New York Times, Clive
Barnes, to say, "Even if modern
dance is not normally your bag,
go and enjoy."
For their performance, the
Paul Taylor Dance Company will
perform two completely different
programs. They will open on
Monday, with "Piece Period,"
"Private Domain," and its
companion piece, "Public
Domain." This performance will
mark the West Coast premiere of
"Private Domain," which has been
described as "an orgy in a
cathedral ... a continual tension
between freedom and discipline,
love and order."
"Public Domain," on the
other hand, has been described as a
"masterpiece of the dada joke,"
with balls rolling across the stage
going nowhere and a large white
cube with a tiny pair of scuttling
legs at the bottom of it rushing
across the backcloth, never to be
seen again.

Rome and the Roman
landscape around 1800 are
depicted in 33 prints and drawings
on display this month in the
Miedel Room of the Stanford
Museum.
The earliest views, five etchings
done in the 1750's by Italian
architect and printmaker Giovanni
Battista Piranesi, show both the
classical Roman monuments and
the later buildings of the
Renaissance and Baroque. Three
etchings by Luigi Rossini show

many of the same monuments, as
seen some 70 years later.
Most of the views are by
German artists of the Romantic
generation who made pilgrimages
to Italy in the lH'2o's. The group
of 16 etchings by Johann Cristian
Reinhart, Albert Christoph Dies,
and Jakob Wilhelm Mechau show
the waterfalls at Tivoli, the
Roman ruins at Civita Castellans,
and other views of the Campagna
in a romatic vein. These etchings
are from a group of 72 plates
which were commissioned and
published by Nuremberg publisher
Frauenholz in 1799.
Further testimony of the
German interest in Italy is found
in the large map of Rome by
Johann Michael Knapp, dated
1830 which was also published in
Germany as part of a large work
on Rome, with views, plans, and
maps.
Three drawings in pen and ink
by the well known German artist
Frank Horny show the Ponte di
Augusto at Narni and the Ponte
Salara.
Also dating from the 1820's
are the fine pencil sketch and a
beautiful grey wash drawing, both
of Rome, by the French artist
Frederic Bourgeois de Mercey.

Rome and the Roman
landscape around 1800 are
depicted in 33 prints and drawings
on display this month in the
Miedel Room of the Stanford
Museum.
The earliest views, five etchings
done in the 1750's by Italian
architect and printmaker Giovanni
Battista Piranesi, show both the
classical Roman monuments and
the later buildings of the
Renaissance and Baroque. Three
etchings by Luigi Rossini show

many of the same monuments, as
seen some 70 years later.
Most of the views are by
German artists of the Romantic
generation who made pilgrimages
to Italy in the lH'2o's. The group
of 16 etchings by Johann Cristian
Reinhart, Albert Christoph Dies,
and Jakob Wilhelm Mechau show
the waterfalls at Tivoli, the
Roman ruins at Civita Castellans,
and other views of the Campagna
in a romatic vein. These etchings
are from a group of 72 plates
which were commissioned and
published by Nuremberg publisher
Frauenholz in 1799.
Further testimony of the
German interest in Italy is found
in the large map of Rome by
Johann Michael Knapp, dated
1830 which was also published in
Germany as part of a large work
on Rome, with views, plans, and
maps.
Three drawings in pen and ink
by the well known German artist
Frank Horny show the Ponte di
Augusto at Narni and the Ponte
Salara.
Also dating from the 1820's
are the fine pencil sketch and a
beautiful grey wash drawing, both
of Rome, by the French artist
Frederic Bourgeois de Mercey.
Folksinger Pete Seeger, Bishop
J. Kilmer Myers, and Congressman
Paul N. (Pete) McCloskey Jr.
are among the headliners
scheduled lor a Population
Explosion Conference of high
school students on Saturday, Oct.
18.
Groups from 60 California high
schools totaling over 1,000
students will attend a day-long
meeting sponsored by the
California Science Teachers
Association and the Biological
Sciences Department.
President Kenneth Pitzer,
noted population biologist Paul
Ehrlich, and Chairman Donald
Kennedy of the Biology
Department also will speak to the
high schoolers. The conferees will
include sessions for debate and
adoption of resolutions by the
youthful conferees.
Erica Schoenberger, a
Menlo-Atherton High School
senior, and George Pegelow,
Stanford administrator, are
co-chairmen of the conference.
The conference committee
includes Willow Glen High School
students Ray Coronado, Mick
Lange, Fred Parkin, Roger Pettit,
and teacher Frank Schiavo;
teachers Don granholm of
Cubberly High School, Martin
Marcus of Peninsula School, Harry
Wong of Menlo-Atherton; and Dr.
John Thomas of Stanford.
"The world population now
stands at more than 3.5 billion
persons, an all-time record," says
a committee statement. "If the
present upward trend
continues —and there is no reason
to suspect it won't—by the turn of
the century, this figure will have
doubled."

The 1969 West Coast tour of
the Paul Taylor Dance Company
will begin with two performances
at 8:30 p.m. Oct. 13 and 15 in
Memorial Auditorium.
Hailed as one of the most
creative and "fun" companies in
the world of contemporary dance,
the Tayjor company will perform
a wide variety of works spanning
Taylor's career as one of this
country's dominant
choreographers.

Taylor, like many of his
contemporaries, is a disciple of
Martha Graham who has found his
own direction. The forte of the
Taylor company is its ability to
see humor in almost any situation
and to translate this humor into
both literal and abstract dance
forms. It is this emphasis on the
humorous aspects of existence
that prompted the dance critic
from the New York Times, Clive
Barnes, to say, "Even if modern
dance is not normally your bag,
go and enjoy."
For their performance, the
Paul Taylor Dance Company will
perform two completely different
programs. They will open on
Monday, with "Piece Period,"
"Private Domain," and its
companion piece, "Public
Domain." This performance will
mark the West Coast premiere of
"Private Domain," which has been
described as "an orgy in a
cathedral ... a continual tension
between freedom and discipline,
love and order."
"Public Domain," on the
other hand, has been described as a
"masterpiece of the dada joke,"
with balls rolling across the stage
going nowhere and a large white
cube with a tiny pair of scuttling
legs at the bottom of it rushing
across the backcloth, never to be
seen again.

The Celluloid Syndicate is
holding its second film workshop
of the quarter tonight at 7:30 in
Branner Dining Hall. Several local
film-makers will show their films
and discuss them afterward. Last
week's projects will be screened
and seminars on basic super-8
shooting and editing techniques
will be held. Everyone interested
is invited.

beautiful grey wash drawing, both
of Rome, by the French artist
Frederic Bourgeois de Mercey.
Folksinger Pete Seeger, Bishop
J. Kilmer Myers, and Congressman
Paul N. (Pete) McCloskey Jr.

meeting sponsored by the
California Science Teachers
Association and the Biological
Sciences Department.
President Kenneth Pitzer,
noted population biologist Paul
Ehrlich, and Chairman Donald
Kennedy of the Biology
Department also will speak to the
high schoolers. The conferees will

continues —and there is no reason
to suspect it won't—by the turn of
the century, this figure will have
doubled."

The 1969 West Coast tour of
the Paul Taylor Dance Company
will begin with two performances
at 8:30 p.m. Oct. 13 and 15 in
Memorial Auditorium.
Hailed as one of the most
creative and "fun" companies in
the world of contemporary dance,
the Tayjor company will perform
a wide variety of works spanning
Taylor's career as one of this
country's dominant
choreographers.

Taylor, like many of his
contemporaries, is a disciple of
Martha Graham who has found his
own direction. The forte of the
Taylor company is its ability to
see humor in almost any situation
and to translate this humor into
both literal and abstract dance
forms. It is this emphasis on the
humorous aspects of existence
that prompted the dance critic
from the New York Times, Clive
Barnes, to say, "Even if modern
dance is not normally your bag,
go and enjoy."
For their performance, the
Paul Taylor Dance Company will
perform two completely different
programs. They will open on
Monday, with "Piece Period,"
"Private Domain," and its
companion piece, "Public
Domain." This performance will
mark the West Coast premiere of
"Private Domain," which has been
described as "an orgy in a
cathedral ... a continual tension
between freedom and discipline,
love and order."
"Public Domain," on the
other hand, has been described as a
"masterpiece of the dada joke,"
with balls rolling across the stage
going nowhere and a large white
cube with a tiny pair of scuttling
legs at the bottom of it rushing
across the backcloth, never to be
seen again.

Rome and the Roman
landscape around 1800 are
depicted in 33 prints and drawings
on display this month in the
Miedel Room of the Stanford
Museum.
The earliest views, five etchings
done in the 1750's by Italian
architect and printmaker Giovanni
Battista Piranesi, show both the
classical Roman monuments and
the later buildings of the
Renaissance and Baroque. Three
etchings by Luigi Rossini show

many of the same monuments, as
seen some 70 years later.
Most of the views are by
German artists of the Romantic
generation who made pilgrimages
to Italy in the lH'2o's. The group
of 16 etchings by Johann Cristian
Reinhart, Albert Christoph Dies,
and Jakob Wilhelm Mechau show
the waterfalls at Tivoli, the
Roman ruins at Civita Castellans,
and other views of the Campagna
in a romatic vein. These etchings
are from a group of 72 plates
which were commissioned and
published by Nuremberg publisher
Frauenholz in 1799.
Further testimony of the
German interest in Italy is found
in the large map of Rome by
Johann Michael Knapp, dated
1830 which was also published in
Germany as part of a large work
on Rome, with views, plans, and
maps.
Three drawings in pen and ink
by the well known German artist
Frank Horny show the Ponte di
Augusto at Narni and the Ponte
Salara.
Also dating from the 1820's
are the fine pencil sketch and a
beautiful grey wash drawing, both

Rome and the Roman
landscape around 1800 are
depicted in 33 prints and drawings
on display this month in the
Miedel Room of the Stanford
Museum.
The earliest views, five etchings
done in the 1750's by Italian
architect and printmaker Giovanni
Battista Piranesi, show both the
classical Roman monuments and
the later buildings of the
Renaissance and Baroque. Three
etchings by Luigi Rossini show

many of the same monuments, as
seen some 70 years later.
Most of the views are by
German artists of the Romantic
generation who made pilgrimages
to Italy in the lH'2o's. The group
of 16 etchings by Johann Cristian
Reinhart, Albert Christoph Dies,
and Jakob Wilhelm Mechau show
the waterfalls at Tivoli, the
Roman ruins at Civita Castellans,
and other views of the Campagna
in a romatic vein. These etchings
are from a group of 72 plates
which were commissioned and
published by Nuremberg publisher
Frauenholz in 1799.
Further testimony of the
German interest in Italy is found
in the large map of Rome by
Johann Michael Knapp, dated
1830 which was also published in
Germany as part of a large work
on Rome, with views, plans, and
maps.
Three drawings in pen and ink
by the well known German artist
Frank Horny show the Ponte di
Augusto at Narni and the Ponte
Salara.
Also dating from the 1820's
are the fine pencil sketch and a
beautiful grey wash drawing, both
of Rome, by the French artist
Frederic Bourgeois de Mercey.
Folksinger Pete Seeger, Bishop
J. Kilmer Myers, and Congressman
Paul N. (Pete) McCloskey Jr.
are among the headliners
scheduled lor a Population
Explosion Conference of high
school students on Saturday, Oct.
18.
Groups from 60 California high
schools totaling over 1,000
students will attend a day-long
meeting sponsored by the
California Science Teachers
Association and the Biological
Sciences Department.
President Kenneth Pitzer,
noted population biologist Paul
Ehrlich, and Chairman Donald
Kennedy of the Biology
Department also will speak to the
high schoolers. The conferees will
include sessions for debate and
adoption of resolutions by the
youthful conferees.
Erica Schoenberger, a
Menlo-Atherton High School
senior, and George Pegelow,
Stanford administrator, are
co-chairmen of the conference.
The conference committee
includes Willow Glen High School
students Ray Coronado, Mick
Lange, Fred Parkin, Roger Pettit,
and teacher Frank Schiavo;
teachers Don granholm of
Cubberly High School, Martin
Marcus of Peninsula School, Harry
Wong of Menlo-Atherton; and Dr.
John Thomas of Stanford.
"The world population now
stands at more than 3.5 billion
persons, an all-time record," says
a committee statement. "If the
present upward trend
continues —and there is no reason
to suspect it won't—by the turn of
the century, this figure will have
doubled."

The 1969 West Coast tour of
the Paul Taylor Dance Company
will begin with two performances
at 8:30 p.m. Oct. 13 and 15 in
Memorial Auditorium.
Hailed as one of the most
creative and "fun" companies in
the world of contemporary dance,
the Tayjor company will perform
a wide variety of works spanning
Taylor's career as one of this
country's dominant
choreographers.

Taylor, like many of his
contemporaries, is a disciple of
Martha Graham who has found his
own direction. The forte of the
Taylor company is its ability to
see humor in almost any situation
and to translate this humor into
both literal and abstract dance
forms. It is this emphasis on the
humorous aspects of existence
that prompted the dance critic
from the New York Times, Clive
Barnes, to say, "Even if modern
dance is not normally your bag,
go and enjoy."
For their performance, the
Paul Taylor Dance Company will
perform two completely different
programs. They will open on
Monday, with "Piece Period,"
"Private Domain," and its
companion piece, "Public
Domain." This performance will
mark the West Coast premiere of
"Private Domain," which has been
described as "an orgy in a
cathedral ... a continual tension
between freedom and discipline,
love and order."
"Public Domain," on the
other hand, has been described as a
"masterpiece of the dada joke,"
with balls rolling across the stage
going nowhere and a large white
cube with a tiny pair of scuttling
legs at the bottom of it rushing
across the backcloth, never to be
seen again.
