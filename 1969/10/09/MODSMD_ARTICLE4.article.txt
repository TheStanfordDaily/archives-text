# From SRI Demonstration
## Arrests And Trials Drag On 
### SIGOURNEY WEAVER 
Three more students involved
in last May's Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) demonstrations
have been arrested since returning
to Stanford in September.
The three persons arrested in
the past month are Andy Parnes,
Bob Jaffee, and Anne Bauer, all
Stanford students.
Parnes and Jaffee were charged
identically with blocking traffic,
trespassing, disturbing the peace,
and participating in unlawful
assembly.
Miss Bauer was first arrested for
riot and obstructing free passage,
but other charges are being added.
The trio will probably be tried
on November 3 unless more
charges are amended, postponing
the trials.
Meanwhile all persons arrested
since May are still awaiting trial.
Six students who were tried and
convicted earlier on a variety of
misdemeanors are appealing the
court's ecision. These include
Jeanne Friedman and Myron
Filene, members of the April 3rd
Movement, who received jail
sentences.
Three others who pleaded nolo

Because of the crowded
schedule for the Santa Clara
County Municipal Court, all trials
are being delayed to November
and December.
Accused are grouped for trial
according to the nature of their
charges and by the date and place
of their alleged criminal acts.
H unt; Jury
Retrial of Marc Sapir, resulting
from a hung jury in the first trial,
will take place on October 14.
Sapir will be judged presumably
by Judge William Ingram Sapir
disqualified his first judge, Sidney
Feinberg, after Feinberg presided
over Sapir's first trial.
In a retrial, the defendant is
allowed one preemptory
disqualification.
On October 21 Steve Kessler
will be tried on five counts
including disturbing the peace,
trespassing with intent to disrupt
business, inciting to riot,
participation in unlawful
assembly, and failure to disperse.
Evidence
James Wolpman, attorney who
represented the first, group of
accused at their sentencing, sums
up evidence against Kessler by
saying, "He was standing with the
others on the lawn."

Kessler will be defended by Len
Edwards of the Santa Clara Public
Defender's Office. He will not
plead nolo contendere but will
stand trial.
Scott Johnson whose
sentencing was deferred the first
trial for psychiatric evaluation will
be sentenced tomorrow. He may
also be tried for perjury.
Assault Charges
Another group will be tried on
November 21 for assault and
battery against Gene Tupper, a
Palo Alto Times photographer.
Trials of four men and two
women beginning on December 8
are "up in theair"says Wolpman.
Charges considered "bogus" by
one defender have been amended
to the cases. The four men, Jim
Clapp, Jim Russell, Peter Schilla,
and Patrick Silva, were accused of
obstructing an officer in the
performance of his duty as well as
the usual round of misdemeanors.
Charges Added
Mrs. Katherine Silva and
Elisabeth Sutton, also arrested in
this group, were not further
charged.
Their attorney, Paul Robertson,
is fighting the addition of
obstruction charges to the format
of the December trial. He argues

to be tried simultaneously with
those accused of this more serious
crime.
Wolpman and Jack Hartog, a
law student employed by the
A3M Legal Defense Committee,
have both stated that the tone of
the court has changed
considerably since the trials first
began during the summer.
Teach A Lesson
Hartog says that in the
beginning the tone of the legal
procedings was one of giving the
accused one last chance to
straighten out. Now, Hartog says,
the court seems to want to teach
the demonstrators a lesson. So far
all those who have not pleaded
guilty have received jail sentences.
One attorney indicated that
that pressure might have been put
on the court by irate citizens and
community officials to inflict
more stringent punishments on
student disrupters.
Hartog said the district
attorney is adding "extra charges
based on scanty evidence" to
insure conviction.
Another strategy, Hartog said,
involves getting the jury incensed
over riotous, disruptive acts that
were performed by the
demonstrators in general, but not
necessarily by those on trial.
