## Reagan Qualifies Davis Stand 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Gov.
Reagan said yesterday that
whether admitted Communist
Angela Davis should remain on
UCLA's faculty should depend on
whether she "can be intellectually
independent."
The governor met with
newsmen before addressing the
American Institute of Certified
Accountants.
It's time, he told newsmen, to
ask "if the issue is not one of
whether there has been change in
the Communist party" permitting
a member to have intellectual
independence and . . .think for
himself."
Reagan said he heard the UCLA
philosophy department once
rejected a Jesuit priest as a faculty
member.
"They claimed it would have
prevented him from having
intellectual independence," he
said. "They can't have it both
ways."
The charge was denied later by
Donald Kalish, chairman of
UCLA's philosophy department.
He said the story came out of
"thin air."
''The Department of
Philosophy has never refused to
employ someone because of
religious beliefs," he said. He
added that an ordained Catholic
priest, the Rev. Georges-Chehata
Anawati, is on the philosophy
staff.
Draft Strife
The FBI said yesterday it has
launched an investigation into
bombings, arson and vandalism
that have hit draft board offices
and other federal installations
across the country.
Hundreds of draft records have
been destroyed during the
nighttime raids in recent months
and extensive damage has been
done to many of the buildings,

according to a survey by The
Associated Press.
The latest incident occurred
Tuesday night at New York City's
Armed Forces Induction Center in
lower Manhattan, where an
explosion shattered more than 40
windows, damaged walls and blew
out partitions.
The building, which also had
been the target of a bomb blast in
1968, houses the files of
thousands of draftees but none of
these records were damaged.
Several persons were in the
lobby of the building when the
11:25 p.m. blast occurred on the
fifth floor but no one was hurt.
An explosion at the base of a
tree near an ROTC headquarters
on the campus of Texas A&M
University in College Station,
Tex., shattered 31 windows in
four dormitories Tuesday. Again,
no one was hurt.
Three incidents occurred in the
early morning hours of Sept.
26 —explosions in the federal
buildings in Milwaukee and a
National Guard armory in
Madison, Wis., and a fire at a draft
board in Akron, Ohio.
In Milwaukee an explosion in a
stairway near draft offices did
$75,000 damage. At almost the
same time the armory in Madison
suffered $100,000 damage from
an explosion at the entrance to a
drill area.
The fire in the Summit County
draft board in Akron was
attributed by authorities to an
arsonist after two empty cleaning
fluid cans were found.
Fire officials said the fluid had
been poured on draft board
records dumped from files, with
heavy destruction of the records
and walls of the office.

WASHINGTON
( A P) —Senate-House conferees
agreed yesterday on a compromise

bill designed to bolster the college
student guaranteed loan program.
Chief stumbling block in a long
dispute between the two branches
had been an amendment of Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
requiring that a bank could not
make a loan conditional on
agreement by a student or his
familv to do other business there.
This finally was compromised
to provide for a study of the
question by the Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare.
If he finds there is
discrimination by the banks, he
will issue regulations to stop it.
The bill's key feature provides
for a government subsidy
payment to the banks which
could mean a yield to them of up
to 10 per cent on the guaranteed
loans.
The present ceiling is 7 per cent
and this has cut down on the
volume of loans since the prime
interest rate rose to BV2 per cent.

The student evaluation policy,

The new policy was disclosed in

at Riverside, biochemistry Prof.

Municipal Court Judge Robert

more trouble on the city's West
Side, torn by three nights of
violence.
Mullen commented in a
telephone interview immediately
after meeting with 30 young
blacks at his home.
Mullen was the presiding judge
at (he arraignments of the nearly
200 persons arrested as a result of
the unrest in the predominantly
Negro section.
Most have been charged with
violating a 7 p.m. to 6 a.m.
curfew, and Mullen has given
those who pleaded guilty to that
charge 30 days in jail. Many
blacks said they thought the
sentence harsh, but those
convicted of violating the curfew
could have received as much as six
months in jail and a $500 fine?
Mullen released those who
pleaded innocent to the charge on
bonds of $1,000 each.

launched an investigation into
bombings, arson and vandalism
that have hit draft board offices
and other federal installations
across the country.
Hundreds of draft records have
been destroyed during the
nighttime raids in recent months
and extensive damage has been
done to many of the buildings,

according to a survey by The
Associated Press.
The latest incident occurred
Tuesday night at New York City's
Armed Forces Induction Center in
lower Manhattan, where an
explosion shattered more than 40
windows, damaged walls and blew
out partitions.
The building, which also had
been the target of a bomb blast in
1968, houses the files of
thousands of draftees but none of
these records were damaged.
Several persons were in the
lobby of the building when the
11:25 p.m. blast occurred on the
fifth floor but no one was hurt.
An explosion at the base of a
tree near an ROTC headquarters
on the campus of Texas A&M
University in College Station,
Tex., shattered 31 windows in
four dormitories Tuesday. Again,
no one was hurt.
Three incidents occurred in the
early morning hours of Sept.
26 —explosions in the federal
buildings in Milwaukee and a
National Guard armory in
Madison, Wis., and a fire at a draft
board in Akron, Ohio.
In Milwaukee an explosion in a
stairway near draft offices did
$75,000 damage. At almost the
same time the armory in Madison
suffered $100,000 damage from
an explosion at the entrance to a
drill area.
The fire in the Summit County
draft board in Akron was
attributed by authorities to an
arsonist after two empty cleaning
fluid cans were found.
Fire officials said the fluid had
been poured on draft board
records dumped from files, with
heavy destruction of the records
and walls of the office.

WASHINGTON
( A P) —Senate-House conferees
agreed yesterday on a compromise

bill designed to bolster the college
student guaranteed loan program.
Chief stumbling block in a long
dispute between the two branches
had been an amendment of Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
requiring that a bank could not
make a loan conditional on
agreement by a student or his
familv to do other business there.
This finally was compromised
to provide for a study of the
question by the Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare.
If he finds there is
discrimination by the banks, he
will issue regulations to stop it.
The bill's key feature provides
for a government subsidy
payment to the banks which
could mean a yield to them of up
to 10 per cent on the guaranteed
loans.
The present ceiling is 7 per cent
and this has cut down on the
volume of loans since the prime
interest rate rose to BV2 per cent.

Mullen commented in a

Mullen was the presiding judge
at (he arraignments of the nearly
200 persons arrested as a result of
the unrest in the predominantly

Most have been charged with
violating a 7 p.m. to 6 a.m.

months in jail and a $500 fine?
Mullen released those who
pleaded innocent to the charge on
bonds of $1,000 each.

LOS ANGELES (AP)—Gov.
Reagan said yesterday that
whether admitted Communist
Angela Davis should remain on
UCLA's faculty should depend on
whether she "can be intellectually
independent."
The governor met with
newsmen before addressing the
American Institute of Certified
Accountants.
It's time, he told newsmen, to
ask "if the issue is not one of
whether there has been change in
the Communist party" permitting
a member to have intellectual
independence and . . .think for
himself."
Reagan said he heard the UCLA
philosophy department once
rejected a Jesuit priest as a faculty
member.
"They claimed it would have
prevented him from having
intellectual independence," he
said. "They can't have it both
ways."
The charge was denied later by
Donald Kalish, chairman of
UCLA's philosophy department.
He said the story came out of
"thin air."
''The Department of
Philosophy has never refused to
employ someone because of
religious beliefs," he said. He
added that an ordained Catholic
priest, the Rev. Georges-Chehata
Anawati, is on the philosophy
staff.

WASHINGTON
( A P) —Senate-House conferees
agreed yesterday on a compromise

bill designed to bolster the college
student guaranteed loan program.
Chief stumbling block in a long
dispute between the two branches
had been an amendment of Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
requiring that a bank could not
make a loan conditional on
agreement by a student or his
familv to do other business there.
This finally was compromised
to provide for a study of the
question by the Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare.
If he finds there is
discrimination by the banks, he
will issue regulations to stop it.
The bill's key feature provides
for a government subsidy
payment to the banks which
could mean a yield to them of up
to 10 per cent on the guaranteed
loans.
The present ceiling is 7 per cent
and this has cut down on the
volume of loans since the prime
interest rate rose to BV2 per cent.

Mullen was the presiding judge

Most have been charged with

Mullen released those who
pleaded innocent to the charge on
bonds of $1,000 each.

LOS ANGELES (AP)—Gov.
Reagan said yesterday that
whether admitted Communist
Angela Davis should remain on
UCLA's faculty should depend on
whether she "can be intellectually
independent."
The governor met with
newsmen before addressing the
American Institute of Certified
Accountants.
It's time, he told newsmen, to
ask "if the issue is not one of
whether there has been change in
the Communist party" permitting
a member to have intellectual
independence and . . .think for
himself."
Reagan said he heard the UCLA
philosophy department once
rejected a Jesuit priest as a faculty
member.
"They claimed it would have
prevented him from having
intellectual independence," he
said. "They can't have it both
ways."
The charge was denied later by
Donald Kalish, chairman of
UCLA's philosophy department.
He said the story came out of
"thin air."
''The Department of
Philosophy has never refused to
employ someone because of
religious beliefs," he said. He
added that an ordained Catholic
priest, the Rev. Georges-Chehata
Anawati, is on the philosophy
staff.
Draft Strife
The FBI said yesterday it has
launched an investigation into
bombings, arson and vandalism
that have hit draft board offices
and other federal installations
across the country.
Hundreds of draft records have
been destroyed during the
nighttime raids in recent months
and extensive damage has been
done to many of the buildings,

according to a survey by The
Associated Press.
The latest incident occurred
Tuesday night at New York City's
Armed Forces Induction Center in
lower Manhattan, where an
explosion shattered more than 40
windows, damaged walls and blew
out partitions.
The building, which also had
been the target of a bomb blast in
1968, houses the files of
thousands of draftees but none of
these records were damaged.
Several persons were in the
lobby of the building when the
11:25 p.m. blast occurred on the
fifth floor but no one was hurt.
An explosion at the base of a
tree near an ROTC headquarters
on the campus of Texas A&M
University in College Station,
Tex., shattered 31 windows in
four dormitories Tuesday. Again,
no one was hurt.
Three incidents occurred in the
early morning hours of Sept.
