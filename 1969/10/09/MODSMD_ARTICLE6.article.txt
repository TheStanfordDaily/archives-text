# §ops And Dissidents
## Fascism Comes Home 
### Marc Sapir 
According to appropriate press
reports, both Ken Pitzer and the
YAF are more liberal than ever
this year. The same could be said
of David Rockefeller who led the
11G (International Industrialist
Conference) last month, or of
Charles Anderson of SRI which
sponsored the conference. After
aflT the lIC theme was "Closing
the world's income gap" which
points out in an
internal memo to SRI staff) even
tBe radicals should be in favor of.

>"ln order to close the world's
irqpome gap David Rockefeller will
announce tomorrow that he is
giving Chase Manhattan Rank to
tin' Rlack majority in South
Africa and withdrawing his
support of the white fascist
oppressor government. At the
snme time, he will sell out all
iSncke feller holdings in Stanford
(Jil to Asian peasants regardless of
religion, class or allegiance to the
US. mother country at an empty
cbke bottle per 1000 shares."

lit takes at least some degree of
astuteness for Bill Evers of the
Daily to imply that the YAF is as
liberal as Pitzer or Charles
Anderson. For the defense of the
Empire is as much in the hands of
the YAF (liberals) as it is in the
hands of any double talking
college administrators or political
hacks. Perhaps that is why Charles
Anderson lavished public praise
on the YAF after their attempts
to attack and prevent radical
action vs SRI. YAF is
counterinsurgency at home. Of
the better than 100 people who
are being prosecuted by the rolice
for the SRI demonstrations most
were singled out and fingered by
YAFers working with the cops. In
jjiTfny cases (as in my own) there
Ivas no evidence that people even
fommitted any "crimes." The
« AF libertarians at Stanford, like
Jhe police, have no qualms in
testifying against leftists, when
J.hey have no evidence worth
talking about, they'll invent some.
" People may not be aware of the
tacit but dangerous alliance that
J?xists between various law and
order factions (like the YAF) and
heroic corporate liberals who used
jto develop chemical warfare
(weapons and still work for the
SrAND Corporation (like Ken
IPitzer). It was just such an alliance

between the so called right wing
and giant corporations and their
leaders which led to and sustained
the rise of Adolf Hitler to power.
(For a thorough documentation
of this fact see an article by
Barbara Lee in the Stanford Daily
duriw/ early August, 1969.)
t'olitical Prisoners
At the present time, from
Chicago to San Francisco to
Saigon, empty phrases like "law
and order" are being used to
imprison dissidents and wipe out
political opposition. Despite the
fact that the very definitions of
law and order are in the hands of
U.S. capitalism's ruling elite, the
people in power are no longer
even willing to play by their own
rules. Anyone who has been
following the Conspiracy 8 trial in
Chicago must be aware of this,
but do not believe that Chicago is
some bum trip; we have our own
similar brands of justice in the
Bay Area where the Los Siete trial
is soon to begin, or in Palo Alto or
at Stanford.
The misdemeanor trials arising
out of the last May SRI
demonstration are trivial in
comparison to what is going down
elsewhere, but they serve as a
useful example. Next week I will
go on trial for the second time
because there were 6 or so jurors
last time who weren't reactionary;
they were open minded. But as a
result of the retrial I will have
spent somewhere between 3 and 4
months during the past year inside
the Santa Clara County Court
House in Palo Alto. It is nice that
I was acquitted on a phoney
charge of failure to disperse from
Lytton Plaza last year. It is nice
that half of my last jury saw that I
was again being framed. But I am
trying to become a doctor and I
don't have time to waste in a
theatrical prison. The next trial
will take my away again from
patient care training in the
hospital. It is all so trivial you see,
but think about Bobby Seale, Ben
Spock, Abbie Hoffman, Eldridge
Cleaver, Jerry Rubin, Tom
Hayden, Rennie Davis, Huey
Newton, Erica Huggins, etc. etc.
etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. And
after the political prisoners think
about the blacks, political and
apolotical, who have been
murdered and assasinated in cold
blood—s or 6 famous cases in SF
alone the last 2 years—and think

about the white brothers and
sisters like James Rector who also
will get bullets in their bodies,
standing defenseless and unarmed,
perhaps running away in vain
attempt to escape the long strong
arm of the law, the state, the
instruments of our liberl ruling
class.
Nouveau Colonialism
What must be emphasized in
this respect is that the ideology of
lummox cops and other
proto-fascists is not a "right wing"
aberration. The ideology of law
and order, jailem, shoot to kill,
anti-youth rebellion,
anti-communism etc. is derived
quite directly from the corporate
needs of economic expansion,
political-economic legemoney,
and total control by whatever
means necessary. Internal fascism
is nothing more than a lot of
colonialist and imperialist
chickens coming home to roost.
And while Pitzer is now
opposed to the Vietnam war
(rah!) no one has heard him say
he is opposed to U.S. imperialism.
Indeed, it was Ken himself who
publicly asked the police to make
more arrests after the SRI
anti-imperialist demonstrations.
(Marc Sapir is a fourth year
medical student at Stanford
University. Accused last year of
failing to disperse from Lytton
Plaza, Mr. Sapir's first trial
resulted in a hung jury. His second
trial begins on October 14th.
