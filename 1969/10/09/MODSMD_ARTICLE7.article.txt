## Free Political Prisoners 
### Laura Neese 
On May 1, 1969, 7500 people
were gathered in front of the
Federal Building in San Francisco,
protesting the frame-up and
imprisonment of America's most
famous political prisoner, Huey P.
Newton. The morning was cold
and windy, but the sun was
coming out, and as the crowd
warmed up, they began to chant
with clenched fists: FREE HUEY!
FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! . . .
It was 10:30 AM. At the same
moment, in the Mission District,
well out of earshot of the
chanting and cheering, several
young Latino college students
were transferring a TV set and
stereo from their parked car to
the home of one of the boys Jose
Rios. A battered green car drove
up and screeched to a halt. Out
jumped two men in informal dress
who did not identify themselves,
but immediately began to harrass
and antagonize tne Latinos.
What happened next is not
clear. One of the men, police
officer Paul McGoran, pulled a
gun on the boys. A scuffle ensued,
and the next thing that happened
was that the other man, police
officer Joseph Brodnik, was lying
in the street, fatally wounded,
with two bullets from McGoran's
gun.
Police Intervention
Immediately, 150-200 police
were sent to the scene of the
incident. Rounds of ammunition
and tear-gas were shot inside the
Rios home. The furniture in the
home was completely destroyed.
The police were setting into
motion the biggest man hunt in
northern California history.
Within five days they had six
suspects, already convicted by the
press and by Mayor Alioto. The
background of the defendants is
interesting:
Nelson Rodriguez, Tony
Martinez, and Mario Martinez
were all students at the College of
San Mateo. They were active in
founding COBRA (Confederation
of the Brown Race for Action), an
organization which works to
recruit high school dropouts and
graduates to go to college.
Community Projects
"Bibi" Melendez, Gary
Lescallet, Jose Rios, and Gio
Ijopez of the Brown Berets, were
active in supporting the strike at
Mission High School and in other
community action projects
designed to feed, clothe, house,
and educate the brown
community. Alioto called them "a
bunch of punks." They were
respected by everybody, including
the merchants, who were

supposed to have been
"terrorized" by "gang rule" in the
Mission district, according to the
San Francisco Chronicle.
Even more interesting is the
background of the two cops. Joe
Brodnik endeared himself to the
Mission district community as one
of the most brutal and
trigger-happy cops anywhere in
San Francisco, specializing in the
harrassment of Mission High
School students. Brodnik and
McGoran always traveled as a
team. At SF State, during the
police riot there, Brodnik and
McGoran had riot clubs literally
drenched in blood—and among
their victims were two strikers
well-known to them: Jose Rios
and Gary Lescallet.
Tension was high in the Mission
district in the two weeks before
the shooting. The Chronicle was
running soap-opera accounts of
"merchants, trembling with fear,
terrorized by punks and gangs,"
and "A loose knit gang of idlers
and hoodlums are slowly closing a
fist of fear around the business
life of the once bustling Mission
District neighborhood." Alioto
topped it off by announcing the
formation of a new 150-man
squad of police to deal with the
"punks" in the Mission
community.
Cops Are Guilty
The exact sequence of events
on May 1 is unknown. What is
understood by the Mission
District community is that their
sons are guilty of no crime—that
the criminals are cops like
Brodnik and McGoran and the
men who control the Brodniks
and McGorans. And what is
understood best of all by the
Mission community is what Ben
Franklin understood a long time
ago, "Either we all hang together,
or we'll all hang separately."
The seven defendants have a
name: Los Siete de la Raza (The
Seven of Our Race). And Los
Siete de la Raza is the name of the
organization working to free the
seven. They have set up a Free
Breakfast for Children program at
St. John's Church and St. Peter's
Hall, Monday through Friday,
8-10 AM. They have a draft
counseling service and a
recreational program. And out of
these programs comes their
slogan: SERVE THE PEOPLE,
FREE LOS SIETE.
Los Siete de la Raza need our
help and our support. The reasons
for that support are best outlined
in Los Siete's statement of
purpose:

Los Siete de la Raza are seven
beautiful brothers who have
shown their love for the
people. They have dedicated
their lives to serving the
people. Why? Because they
know that the brown people
are hungry. Our children suffer
from the poor food that we
must pay a fortune for, a
fortune we do not have. The
spirit of our people is crushed
in schools that are irrelevant to
our lives. Many of our people
are drafted by rich gringos to
fight against our Vietnamese
brothers. At work, our bosses
act like they are doing us a
favor taking our energy and
giving us nearly nothing. When
we work to solve these
problems, many times we are
jailed by the system. (The
system has put more brown
people in prison than they
allow into college!)
It is because we love Los
Siete that we will free them.
Los Siete have taught us that
we must serve the people. This
is a job that never ends.
Public Meeting
Los Siete is coming to trial on
October 20 at the SF Hall of
Justice (850 Bryant St., San
Francisco). They are asking all
sympathizers to support them by
demonstrating in front of the
courthouse beginning at 9:00 AM
on the 20th. There will be a
meeting of all those interested in
hearing more about Los Siete, or
in building support for them at
7:30 PM, Thursday, October 9, in
Madera Lounge, Wilbur. Oscar
Pios, of the Los Siete organization
will be there to rap with people.
Everyone is invited, so please
come. SERVE THE PEOPLE!
FREE LOS SIETE!

is a job that never ends.
Public Meeting
Los Siete is coming to trial on
October 20 at the SF Hall of
Justice (850 Bryant St., San
Francisco). They are asking all
sympathizers to support them by
demonstrating in front of the
courthouse beginning at 9:00 AM
on the 20th. There will be a
meeting of all those interested in
hearing more about Los Siete, or
in building support for them at
7:30 PM, Thursday, October 9, in
Madera Lounge, Wilbur. Oscar
Pios, of the Los Siete organization
will be there to rap with people.
Everyone is invited, so please

On May 1, 1969, 7500 people
were gathered in front of the
Federal Building in San Francisco,
protesting the frame-up and
imprisonment of America's most
famous political prisoner, Huey P.
Newton. The morning was cold
and windy, but the sun was
coming out, and as the crowd
warmed up, they began to chant
with clenched fists: FREE HUEY!
FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! . . .
It was 10:30 AM. At the same
moment, in the Mission District,
well out of earshot of the
chanting and cheering, several
young Latino college students
were transferring a TV set and
stereo from their parked car to
the home of one of the boys Jose
Rios. A battered green car drove
up and screeched to a halt. Out
jumped two men in informal dress
who did not identify themselves,
but immediately began to harrass
and antagonize tne Latinos.
What happened next is not
clear. One of the men, police
officer Paul McGoran, pulled a
gun on the boys. A scuffle ensued,
and the next thing that happened
was that the other man, police
officer Joseph Brodnik, was lying
in the street, fatally wounded,
with two bullets from McGoran's
gun.
Police Intervention
Immediately, 150-200 police
were sent to the scene of the
incident. Rounds of ammunition
and tear-gas were shot inside the
Rios home. The furniture in the
home was completely destroyed.
The police were setting into
motion the biggest man hunt in
northern California history.
Within five days they had six
suspects, already convicted by the
press and by Mayor Alioto. The
background of the defendants is
interesting:
Nelson Rodriguez, Tony
Martinez, and Mario Martinez
were all students at the College of
San Mateo. They were active in
founding COBRA (Confederation
of the Brown Race for Action), an
organization which works to
recruit high school dropouts and
graduates to go to college.
Community Projects
"Bibi" Melendez, Gary
Lescallet, Jose Rios, and Gio
Ijopez of the Brown Berets, were
active in supporting the strike at
Mission High School and in other
community action projects
designed to feed, clothe, house,
and educate the brown
community. Alioto called them "a
bunch of punks." They were
respected by everybody, including
the merchants, who were

supposed to have been
"terrorized" by "gang rule" in the
Mission district, according to the
San Francisco Chronicle.
Even more interesting is the
background of the two cops. Joe
Brodnik endeared himself to the
Mission district community as one
of the most brutal and
trigger-happy cops anywhere in
San Francisco, specializing in the
harrassment of Mission High
School students. Brodnik and
McGoran always traveled as a
team. At SF State, during the
police riot there, Brodnik and
McGoran had riot clubs literally
drenched in blood—and among
their victims were two strikers
well-known to them: Jose Rios
and Gary Lescallet.
Tension was high in the Mission
district in the two weeks before
the shooting. The Chronicle was
running soap-opera accounts of
"merchants, trembling with fear,
terrorized by punks and gangs,"
and "A loose knit gang of idlers
and hoodlums are slowly closing a
fist of fear around the business
life of the once bustling Mission
District neighborhood." Alioto
topped it off by announcing the
formation of a new 150-man
squad of police to deal with the
"punks" in the Mission
community.
Cops Are Guilty
The exact sequence of events
on May 1 is unknown. What is
understood by the Mission
District community is that their
sons are guilty of no crime—that
the criminals are cops like
Brodnik and McGoran and the
men who control the Brodniks
and McGorans. And what is
understood best of all by the
Mission community is what Ben
Franklin understood a long time
ago, "Either we all hang together,
or we'll all hang separately."
The seven defendants have a
name: Los Siete de la Raza (The
Seven of Our Race). And Los
Siete de la Raza is the name of the
organization working to free the
seven. They have set up a Free
Breakfast for Children program at
St. John's Church and St. Peter's
Hall, Monday through Friday,
8-10 AM. They have a draft
counseling service and a
recreational program. And out of
these programs comes their
slogan: SERVE THE PEOPLE,
FREE LOS SIETE.
Los Siete de la Raza need our
help and our support. The reasons
for that support are best outlined
in Los Siete's statement of
purpose:

Los Siete de la Raza are seven
beautiful brothers who have
shown their love for the
people. They have dedicated
their lives to serving the
people. Why? Because they
know that the brown people
are hungry. Our children suffer
from the poor food that we
must pay a fortune for, a
fortune we do not have. The
spirit of our people is crushed
in schools that are irrelevant to
our lives. Many of our people
are drafted by rich gringos to
fight against our Vietnamese
brothers. At work, our bosses
act like they are doing us a
favor taking our energy and
giving us nearly nothing. When
we work to solve these
problems, many times we are
jailed by the system. (The
system has put more brown
people in prison than they
allow into college!)
It is because we love Los
Siete that we will free them.
Los Siete have taught us that
we must serve the people. This
is a job that never ends.

know that the brown people
are hungry. Our children suffer
from the poor food that we
must pay a fortune for, a
fortune we do not have. The
spirit of our people is crushed
in schools that are irrelevant to
our lives. Many of our people
are drafted by rich gringos to
fight against our Vietnamese
brothers. At work, our bosses
act like they are doing us a
favor taking our energy and
giving us nearly nothing. When
we work to solve these
problems, many times we are
jailed by the system. (The
system has put more brown
people in prison than they
allow into college!)
It is because we love Los
Siete that we will free them.
Los Siete have taught us that
we must serve the people. This
is a job that never ends.
Public Meeting
Los Siete is coming to trial on
October 20 at the SF Hall of
Justice (850 Bryant St., San
Francisco). They are asking all
sympathizers to support them by
demonstrating in front of the
courthouse beginning at 9:00 AM
on the 20th. There will be a
meeting of all those interested in
hearing more about Los Siete, or
in building support for them at
7:30 PM, Thursday, October 9, in
Madera Lounge, Wilbur. Oscar
Pios, of the Los Siete organization
will be there to rap with people.
Everyone is invited, so please
come. SERVE THE PEOPLE!
FREE LOS SIETE!

On May 1, 1969, 7500 people
were gathered in front of the
Federal Building in San Francisco,
protesting the frame-up and
imprisonment of America's most
famous political prisoner, Huey P.
Newton. The morning was cold
and windy, but the sun was
coming out, and as the crowd
warmed up, they began to chant
with clenched fists: FREE HUEY!
FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! . . .
It was 10:30 AM. At the same
moment, in the Mission District,
well out of earshot of the
chanting and cheering, several
young Latino college students
were transferring a TV set and
stereo from their parked car to
the home of one of the boys Jose
Rios. A battered green car drove
up and screeched to a halt. Out
jumped two men in informal dress
who did not identify themselves,
but immediately began to harrass
and antagonize tne Latinos.
What happened next is not
clear. One of the men, police
officer Paul McGoran, pulled a
gun on the boys. A scuffle ensued,
and the next thing that happened
was that the other man, police
officer Joseph Brodnik, was lying
in the street, fatally wounded,
with two bullets from McGoran's
gun.
Police Intervention
Immediately, 150-200 police
were sent to the scene of the
incident. Rounds of ammunition
and tear-gas were shot inside the
Rios home. The furniture in the
home was completely destroyed.
The police were setting into
motion the biggest man hunt in
northern California history.
Within five days they had six
suspects, already convicted by the
press and by Mayor Alioto. The
background of the defendants is
interesting:
Nelson Rodriguez, Tony
Martinez, and Mario Martinez
were all students at the College of
San Mateo. They were active in
founding COBRA (Confederation
of the Brown Race for Action), an
organization which works to
recruit high school dropouts and
graduates to go to college.
Community Projects
"Bibi" Melendez, Gary
Lescallet, Jose Rios, and Gio
Ijopez of the Brown Berets, were
active in supporting the strike at
Mission High School and in other
community action projects
designed to feed, clothe, house,
and educate the brown
community. Alioto called them "a
bunch of punks." They were
respected by everybody, including
the merchants, who were

supposed to have been
"terrorized" by "gang rule" in the
Mission district, according to the
San Francisco Chronicle.
Even more interesting is the
background of the two cops. Joe
Brodnik endeared himself to the
Mission district community as one
of the most brutal and
trigger-happy cops anywhere in
San Francisco, specializing in the
harrassment of Mission High
School students. Brodnik and
McGoran always traveled as a
team. At SF State, during the
police riot there, Brodnik and
McGoran had riot clubs literally
drenched in blood—and among
their victims were two strikers
well-known to them: Jose Rios
and Gary Lescallet.
Tension was high in the Mission
district in the two weeks before
the shooting. The Chronicle was
running soap-opera accounts of
"merchants, trembling with fear,
terrorized by punks and gangs,"
and "A loose knit gang of idlers
and hoodlums are slowly closing a
fist of fear around the business
life of the once bustling Mission
District neighborhood." Alioto
topped it off by announcing the
formation of a new 150-man
squad of police to deal with the
"punks" in the Mission
community.
Cops Are Guilty
The exact sequence of events
on May 1 is unknown. What is
understood by the Mission
District community is that their
sons are guilty of no crime—that
the criminals are cops like
Brodnik and McGoran and the
men who control the Brodniks
and McGorans. And what is
understood best of all by the
Mission community is what Ben
Franklin understood a long time
ago, "Either we all hang together,
or we'll all hang separately."
The seven defendants have a
name: Los Siete de la Raza (The
Seven of Our Race). And Los
Siete de la Raza is the name of the
organization working to free the
seven. They have set up a Free
Breakfast for Children program at
St. John's Church and St. Peter's
Hall, Monday through Friday,
8-10 AM. They have a draft
counseling service and a
recreational program. And out of
these programs comes their
slogan: SERVE THE PEOPLE,
FREE LOS SIETE.
Los Siete de la Raza need our
help and our support. The reasons
for that support are best outlined
in Los Siete's statement of
purpose:

Los Siete de la Raza are seven
beautiful brothers who have
shown their love for the
people. They have dedicated
their lives to serving the
people. Why? Because they
know that the brown people
are hungry. Our children suffer
from the poor food that we
must pay a fortune for, a
fortune we do not have. The

Seven of Our Race). And Los
Siete de la Raza is the name of the
organization working to free the
seven. They have set up a Free
Breakfast for Children program at
St. John's Church and St. Peter's
Hall, Monday through Friday,
8-10 AM. They have a draft
counseling service and a
recreational program. And out of
these programs comes their
slogan: SERVE THE PEOPLE,
FREE LOS SIETE.
Los Siete de la Raza need our
help and our support. The reasons
for that support are best outlined
in Los Siete's statement of
purpose:

Los Siete de la Raza are seven
beautiful brothers who have
shown their love for the
people. They have dedicated
their lives to serving the
people. Why? Because they
know that the brown people
are hungry. Our children suffer
from the poor food that we
must pay a fortune for, a
fortune we do not have. The
spirit of our people is crushed
in schools that are irrelevant to
our lives. Many of our people
are drafted by rich gringos to
fight against our Vietnamese
brothers. At work, our bosses
act like they are doing us a
favor taking our energy and
giving us nearly nothing. When
we work to solve these
problems, many times we are
jailed by the system. (The
system has put more brown
people in prison than they
allow into college!)
It is because we love Los
Siete that we will free them.
Los Siete have taught us that
we must serve the people. This
is a job that never ends.
Public Meeting
Los Siete is coming to trial on
October 20 at the SF Hall of
Justice (850 Bryant St., San
Francisco). They are asking all
sympathizers to support them by
demonstrating in front of the
courthouse beginning at 9:00 AM
on the 20th. There will be a
meeting of all those interested in
hearing more about Los Siete, or
in building support for them at
7:30 PM, Thursday, October 9, in
Madera Lounge, Wilbur. Oscar
Pios, of the Los Siete organization
will be there to rap with people.
Everyone is invited, so please
come. SERVE THE PEOPLE!
FREE LOS SIETE!
