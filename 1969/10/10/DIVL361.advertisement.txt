BEDAZZLED!
Start Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Eleanor Bron, and the bawdy of Raquel
Welch. An uproarious Faustian allegory of a Wimpyburger frycook, the Prince
of Darkness (Beelzebub), and a beautiful woman. An intellectual and hilarious
look at the Devil, nuns, hubris, love, plutocracy, temptation, God, pop idols,
greed, hypocrisy, and most of Christianity's big questions. Come and dig on one
of the most underrated movies ever.
