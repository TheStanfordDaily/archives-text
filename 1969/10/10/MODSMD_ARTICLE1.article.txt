# Contract Shifts
## Research Going Through Changes 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
Five months have passed since
last spring's demonstrations, but
neither the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL) nor Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) will ever
be the same.
Stanford has reassessed
questionable contracts with the
Defense Department and National
Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) and has
taken action to declassify projects
and bring them within the new
research guidelines. Twenty-five
Stanford Electronics Laboratory
(SEL) personnel, disgruntled by
the events of April and May, have
moved to SRI, taking several
contracts along with them.
SRI has changed, too. The
twenty-five new staff members
represent nearly one percent of
the total SRI personnel (2700,
down from 3200 last year). New
contracts haven't been coming in
as rapidly as before, but this is
due, SRI says, to a cutback in
government spending rather than
to the disruptions.
Different proposals for
separating SRI from Stanford are
being examined. The Board of
Trustees appointed a group to
study various possibilities, and it
appears that SRI will not be sold
to a private interest, but will
merely be separated and retain its
non-profit status.
SEL Readjusts
The Systems Theory
Laboratory of SEL, where most
of the research objected to was

centered, no longer exists. Two
new laboratories have been
created to research information
systems and digital systems.
The departure of 25 personnel
necessitated the reorganization,
and their move to SRI was
apparently accompanied by much
bitterness. Dr. David Bacon,
Associate Director of SEL, says
"None of them would have gone
to SRI if the university climate
had remained as it was before.
They felt the environment at the
university wasn't conducive to the
research they wished to do."
The former Stanford employees
now at SRI have refused to
discuss their move with The Daily,
but SRI public relations director
Homer Meaders reports, "Most of
those who came were unhappy
with Stanford, and felt betrayed."
As he further explained, "They
felt as if the lab were pulled out
from under them because of some
upheaval."
Loss of Contracts
According to Bacon, the people
moving to SRI took three
contracts along with them. These
are now under sub-contract to
SRI, and terms are being worked
out for SRI to be prime
contractor. This involves a loss to
Stanford of $700,000 to
$800,000 on an annual basis.
In addition, six other SEL staff
members are terminating their
work at Stanford and going into
their own business. This involves a
$200,000 to $300,000 loss in
contracts.

Forty-three students were
originally involved in working on
these various contracts, and most
have been transferred to other
projects. Eight have not yet been
assigned to new work, but Bacon
explains, "We are finding
university support for these
students so they will not be
penalized."
Costly Changes
The changes since last spring
have been costly for Stanford in
both money and personnel.
President Kenneth Pitzer told the
Academic Council last Friday,
"We should acknowledge that it is
impossible to compensate for the
intangible losses to some people
arising from the AEL sit-in and
the enforced transition of research
activity. Nor is it possible for the
university to recover the large
financial loss arising from the
AEL episode."
Pitzer reported to the Council
that all questionable contracts had
been reexamined and had either
been declassified, found to be
within the guidelines, or
terminated. Only one classified
contract remains involving
ionospheric radioscience.
Sale of SRI
The eventual relationship
between Stanford and SRI
remains unresolved. SRI is still
legally a subsidiary of Stanford,
but various means of separation
are being explored by a panel
appointed by the Board of
Trustees who have final authority.
However, the Board promised to

take into consideration the desires
of SRI employees.
Rumors that a buyer for SRI
has been found (perhaps
Philco-Ford or Litton Industries),
have circulated, but Meaders
discredits these reports. "I feel
SRI is not going to be sold. I
think it's going to become
independent." He says that the
genera! feeling among SRI staff is
that they don't want to work for
a profit organization.
Sale of SRI would also present
various legal problems. Several
buildings, for example, were
constructed for public health
research, and the Public Health
Department paid 50 percent of
construction costs. Such a grant is
only available to a non-profit
organization.
Changing SRI to a profit
organization would jeopardize this
research, and yet maintaining its
non-profit status makes sale
unlikely. As Meaders remarks,

"Who would want to pay $45
million for a non-profit
organization?"
Changes at SRI
SRI denies reports that the
demonstrations in May resulted in
loss of contracts. There are fewer
contracts now, and income is
running behind last year's total of
$65 million, but Meaders says,
"This has more to do with
Richard Nixon than with
disruptions last spring."
New contracts from the
government are "significantly
behind what they were last year,"
Meaders explains. "Even the first
five months of 1969 (before the
demonstrations) were running
behind." Meaders discounts
reports that clients withdrew
contracts from SRI because of the
demonstrations. "SRl's firm
stance probably gave us more
contracts," he says. Meaders also
reports that SDS demonstrations
at the International Industrialists
Conference "just fizzled" and did
no harm to SRI, co-sponsor of the
event.
At least one change in research
policy did occur following the
events of last spring. SRI's Board
of Directors, along with
Stanford's Board of Trustees,
announced that SRI would take
no new contracts leading to the
development of chemical or
biological warfare weapons.
Last May SRI had two
contracts in this area. One
involved particle distribution, and
the other the detection of
biological warfare. These

contracts, both unclassified,
involved only $50,000, so the
decision to cease this kind of
research resulted in no great
financial loss.
Appointed Advisory Board
Internal changes at SRI also
include an Institute Staff
Advisory Group formed last June.
The Advisory Group is intended
to provide "improved internal
communication between the staff
and management," according to
Dr. Felix Smith, chairman.
Protesters claimed last spring tha
SRI management was acting
without consulting the wishes of
the staff.

As Meaders explains the group,
"It is advisory, with no power."
But he adds that "it represents an
effort to factor into decisions the
opinions and collective wisdom of
the staff."
The Advisory Group is
appointed, rather than elected by
the staff. Each executive director
or vice-president gets to appoint a
certain number to the 75-man
group. Smith denies that the
selection procedure limits the
members' independence. "The
group's attitude is one of highly
independent people," he says.
"They can be highly critical of the
organization if they choose to
be."

have been costly for Stanford in
both money and personnel.
President Kenneth Pitzer told the
Academic Council last Friday,
"We should acknowledge that it is
impossible to compensate for the
intangible losses to some people
arising from the AEL sit-in and
the enforced transition of research
activity. Nor is it possible for the
university to recover the large
financial loss arising from the
AEL episode."
Pitzer reported to the Council
that all questionable contracts had
been reexamined and had either
been declassified, found to be
within the guidelines, or
terminated. Only one classified
contract remains involving
ionospheric radioscience.
Sale of SRI
The eventual relationship
between Stanford and SRI
remains unresolved. SRI is still
legally a subsidiary of Stanford,
but various means of separation
are being explored by a panel
appointed by the Board of
Trustees who have final authority.
However, the Board promised to

take into consideration the desires
of SRI employees.
Rumors that a buyer for SRI
has been found (perhaps
Philco-Ford or Litton Industries),
have circulated, but Meaders
discredits these reports. "I feel
SRI is not going to be sold. I
think it's going to become
independent." He says that the
genera! feeling among SRI staff is
that they don't want to work for
a profit organization.
Sale of SRI would also present
various legal problems. Several
buildings, for example, were
constructed for public health
research, and the Public Health
Department paid 50 percent of
construction costs. Such a grant is
only available to a non-profit
organization.
Changing SRI to a profit
organization would jeopardize this
research, and yet maintaining its
non-profit status makes sale
unlikely. As Meaders remarks,

"Who would want to pay $45
million for a non-profit
organization?"
Changes at SRI
SRI denies reports that the
demonstrations in May resulted in
loss of contracts. There are fewer
contracts now, and income is
running behind last year's total of
$65 million, but Meaders says,
"This has more to do with
Richard Nixon than with
disruptions last spring."
New contracts from the
government are "significantly
behind what they were last year,"
Meaders explains. "Even the first
five months of 1969 (before the
demonstrations) were running
behind." Meaders discounts
reports that clients withdrew
contracts from SRI because of the
demonstrations. "SRl's firm
stance probably gave us more
contracts," he says. Meaders also
reports that SDS demonstrations
at the International Industrialists
Conference "just fizzled" and did
no harm to SRI, co-sponsor of the
event.
At least one change in research
policy did occur following the
events of last spring. SRI's Board
of Directors, along with
Stanford's Board of Trustees,
announced that SRI would take
no new contracts leading to the
development of chemical or
biological warfare weapons.
Last May SRI had two
contracts in this area. One
involved particle distribution, and
the other the detection of
biological warfare. These

contracts, both unclassified,
involved only $50,000, so the
decision to cease this kind of
research resulted in no great
financial loss.
Appointed Advisory Board
Internal changes at SRI also
include an Institute Staff
Advisory Group formed last June.
The Advisory Group is intended
to provide "improved internal
communication between the staff
and management," according to
Dr. Felix Smith, chairman.
Protesters claimed last spring tha
SRI management was acting
without consulting the wishes of
the staff.

As Meaders explains the group,
"It is advisory, with no power."
But he adds that "it represents an
effort to factor into decisions the
opinions and collective wisdom of
the staff."
The Advisory Group is
appointed, rather than elected by
the staff. Each executive director
or vice-president gets to appoint a
certain number to the 75-man
group. Smith denies that the
selection procedure limits the
members' independence. "The
group's attitude is one of highly
independent people," he says.
"They can be highly critical of the
organization if they choose to
be."
Five months have passed since
last spring's demonstrations, but
neither the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL) nor Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) will ever
be the same.
Stanford has reassessed
questionable contracts with the
Defense Department and National
Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) and has
taken action to declassify projects
and bring them within the new
research guidelines. Twenty-five
Stanford Electronics Laboratory
(SEL) personnel, disgruntled by
the events of April and May, have
moved to SRI, taking several
contracts along with them.
SRI has changed, too. The
twenty-five new staff members
represent nearly one percent of
the total SRI personnel (2700,
down from 3200 last year). New
contracts haven't been coming in
as rapidly as before, but this is
due, SRI says, to a cutback in
government spending rather than
to the disruptions.
Different proposals for
separating SRI from Stanford are
being examined. The Board of
Trustees appointed a group to
study various possibilities, and it
appears that SRI will not be sold
to a private interest, but will
merely be separated and retain its
non-profit status.
SEL Readjusts
The Systems Theory
Laboratory of SEL, where most
of the research objected to was

centered, no longer exists. Two
new laboratories have been
created to research information
systems and digital systems.
The departure of 25 personnel
necessitated the reorganization,
and their move to SRI was
apparently accompanied by much
bitterness. Dr. David Bacon,
Associate Director of SEL, says
"None of them would have gone
to SRI if the university climate
had remained as it was before.
They felt the environment at the
university wasn't conducive to the
research they wished to do."
The former Stanford employees
now at SRI have refused to
discuss their move with The Daily,
but SRI public relations director
Homer Meaders reports, "Most of
those who came were unhappy
with Stanford, and felt betrayed."
As he further explained, "They
felt as if the lab were pulled out
from under them because of some
upheaval."
Loss of Contracts
According to Bacon, the people
moving to SRI took three
contracts along with them. These
are now under sub-contract to
SRI, and terms are being worked
out for SRI to be prime
contractor. This involves a loss to
Stanford of $700,000 to
$800,000 on an annual basis.
In addition, six other SEL staff
members are terminating their
work at Stanford and going into
their own business. This involves a
$200,000 to $300,000 loss in
contracts.

Forty-three students were
originally involved in working on
these various contracts, and most
have been transferred to other
projects. Eight have not yet been
assigned to new work, but Bacon
explains, "We are finding
university support for these
students so they will not be
penalized."

biological warfare. These

contracts, both unclassified,
involved only $50,000, so the
decision to cease this kind of
research resulted in no great
financial loss.
Appointed Advisory Board
Internal changes at SRI also
include an Institute Staff
Advisory Group formed last June.
The Advisory Group is intended
to provide "improved internal
communication between the staff
and management," according to
Dr. Felix Smith, chairman.
Protesters claimed last spring tha
SRI management was acting
without consulting the wishes of
the staff.

As Meaders explains the group,
"It is advisory, with no power."
But he adds that "it represents an
effort to factor into decisions the
opinions and collective wisdom of
the staff."
The Advisory Group is
appointed, rather than elected by
the staff. Each executive director
or vice-president gets to appoint a
certain number to the 75-man
group. Smith denies that the
selection procedure limits the
members' independence. "The
group's attitude is one of highly
independent people," he says.
"They can be highly critical of the
organization if they choose to
be."
Five months have passed since
last spring's demonstrations, but
neither the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL) nor Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) will ever
be the same.
Stanford has reassessed
questionable contracts with the
Defense Department and National
Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) and has
taken action to declassify projects
and bring them within the new
research guidelines. Twenty-five
Stanford Electronics Laboratory
(SEL) personnel, disgruntled by
the events of April and May, have
moved to SRI, taking several
contracts along with them.
SRI has changed, too. The
twenty-five new staff members
represent nearly one percent of
the total SRI personnel (2700,
down from 3200 last year). New
contracts haven't been coming in
as rapidly as before, but this is
due, SRI says, to a cutback in
government spending rather than
to the disruptions.
Different proposals for
separating SRI from Stanford are
being examined. The Board of
Trustees appointed a group to
study various possibilities, and it
appears that SRI will not be sold
to a private interest, but will
merely be separated and retain its
non-profit status.
SEL Readjusts
The Systems Theory
Laboratory of SEL, where most
of the research objected to was

centered, no longer exists. Two
new laboratories have been
created to research information
systems and digital systems.
The departure of 25 personnel
necessitated the reorganization,
and their move to SRI was
apparently accompanied by much
bitterness. Dr. David Bacon,
Associate Director of SEL, says
"None of them would have gone
to SRI if the university climate
had remained as it was before.
They felt the environment at the
university wasn't conducive to the
research they wished to do."
The former Stanford employees
now at SRI have refused to
discuss their move with The Daily,
but SRI public relations director
Homer Meaders reports, "Most of
those who came were unhappy
with Stanford, and felt betrayed."
As he further explained, "They
felt as if the lab were pulled out
from under them because of some
upheaval."
Loss of Contracts
According to Bacon, the people
moving to SRI took three
contracts along with them. These
are now under sub-contract to
SRI, and terms are being worked
out for SRI to be prime
contractor. This involves a loss to
Stanford of $700,000 to
$800,000 on an annual basis.
In addition, six other SEL staff
members are terminating their
work at Stanford and going into
their own business. This involves a
$200,000 to $300,000 loss in
contracts.

Forty-three students were
originally involved in working on
these various contracts, and most
have been transferred to other
projects. Eight have not yet been
assigned to new work, but Bacon
explains, "We are finding
university support for these
students so they will not be
penalized."
Costly Changes
The changes since last spring
have been costly for Stanford in
both money and personnel.
President Kenneth Pitzer told the
Academic Council last Friday,
"We should acknowledge that it is
impossible to compensate for the
intangible losses to some people
arising from the AEL sit-in and
the enforced transition of research
activity. Nor is it possible for the
university to recover the large
financial loss arising from the
AEL episode."
Pitzer reported to the Council
that all questionable contracts had
been reexamined and had either
been declassified, found to be
within the guidelines, or
terminated. Only one classified
contract remains involving
ionospheric radioscience.
Sale of SRI
The eventual relationship
between Stanford and SRI
remains unresolved. SRI is still
legally a subsidiary of Stanford,
but various means of separation
are being explored by a panel
appointed by the Board of
Trustees who have final authority.
However, the Board promised to

take into consideration the desires
of SRI employees.
Rumors that a buyer for SRI
has been found (perhaps
Philco-Ford or Litton Industries),
have circulated, but Meaders
discredits these reports. "I feel
SRI is not going to be sold. I
think it's going to become
independent." He says that the
genera! feeling among SRI staff is
that they don't want to work for
a profit organization.
Sale of SRI would also present
various legal problems. Several
buildings, for example, were
constructed for public health
research, and the Public Health
Department paid 50 percent of
construction costs. Such a grant is
only available to a non-profit
organization.
Changing SRI to a profit
organization would jeopardize this
research, and yet maintaining its
non-profit status makes sale
unlikely. As Meaders remarks,

"Who would want to pay $45
million for a non-profit
organization?"
Changes at SRI
SRI denies reports that the
demonstrations in May resulted in
loss of contracts. There are fewer
contracts now, and income is
running behind last year's total of
$65 million, but Meaders says,
"This has more to do with
Richard Nixon than with
disruptions last spring."
New contracts from the
government are "significantly
behind what they were last year,"
Meaders explains. "Even the first
five months of 1969 (before the
demonstrations) were running
behind." Meaders discounts
reports that clients withdrew
contracts from SRI because of the
demonstrations. "SRl's firm
stance probably gave us more
contracts," he says. Meaders also
reports that SDS demonstrations
at the International Industrialists
Conference "just fizzled" and did
no harm to SRI, co-sponsor of the
event.
At least one change in research
policy did occur following the
events of last spring. SRI's Board
of Directors, along with
Stanford's Board of Trustees,
announced that SRI would take
no new contracts leading to the
development of chemical or
biological warfare weapons.
Last May SRI had two
contracts in this area. One
involved particle distribution, and
the other the detection of
biological warfare. These

contracts, both unclassified,
involved only $50,000, so the
decision to cease this kind of

those who came were unhappy
with Stanford, and felt betrayed."
As he further explained, "They
felt as if the lab were pulled out
from under them because of some
upheaval."
Loss of Contracts
According to Bacon, the people
moving to SRI took three
contracts along with them. These
are now under sub-contract to
SRI, and terms are being worked
out for SRI to be prime
contractor. This involves a loss to
Stanford of $700,000 to
$800,000 on an annual basis.
In addition, six other SEL staff
members are terminating their
work at Stanford and going into
their own business. This involves a
$200,000 to $300,000 loss in
contracts.

Forty-three students were
originally involved in working on
these various contracts, and most
have been transferred to other
projects. Eight have not yet been
assigned to new work, but Bacon
explains, "We are finding
university support for these
students so they will not be
penalized."
Costly Changes
The changes since last spring
have been costly for Stanford in
both money and personnel.
President Kenneth Pitzer told the
Academic Council last Friday,
"We should acknowledge that it is
impossible to compensate for the
intangible losses to some people
arising from the AEL sit-in and
the enforced transition of research
activity. Nor is it possible for the
university to recover the large
financial loss arising from the
AEL episode."
Pitzer reported to the Council
that all questionable contracts had
been reexamined and had either
been declassified, found to be
within the guidelines, or
terminated. Only one classified
contract remains involving
ionospheric radioscience.
Sale of SRI
The eventual relationship
between Stanford and SRI
remains unresolved. SRI is still
legally a subsidiary of Stanford,
but various means of separation
are being explored by a panel
appointed by the Board of
Trustees who have final authority.
However, the Board promised to

take into consideration the desires
of SRI employees.
Rumors that a buyer for SRI
has been found (perhaps
Philco-Ford or Litton Industries),
have circulated, but Meaders
discredits these reports. "I feel
SRI is not going to be sold. I
think it's going to become
independent." He says that the
genera! feeling among SRI staff is
that they don't want to work for
a profit organization.
Sale of SRI would also present
various legal problems. Several
buildings, for example, were
constructed for public health
research, and the Public Health
Department paid 50 percent of
construction costs. Such a grant is
only available to a non-profit
organization.
Changing SRI to a profit
organization would jeopardize this
research, and yet maintaining its
non-profit status makes sale
unlikely. As Meaders remarks,

"Who would want to pay $45
million for a non-profit
organization?"
Changes at SRI
SRI denies reports that the
demonstrations in May resulted in
loss of contracts. There are fewer
contracts now, and income is
running behind last year's total of
$65 million, but Meaders says,
"This has more to do with
Richard Nixon than with
disruptions last spring."
New contracts from the
government are "significantly
behind what they were last year,"
Meaders explains. "Even the first
five months of 1969 (before the
demonstrations) were running
behind." Meaders discounts
reports that clients withdrew
contracts from SRI because of the
demonstrations. "SRl's firm
stance probably gave us more
contracts," he says. Meaders also
reports that SDS demonstrations
at the International Industrialists
Conference "just fizzled" and did
no harm to SRI, co-sponsor of the
event.
At least one change in research
policy did occur following the
events of last spring. SRI's Board
of Directors, along with
Stanford's Board of Trustees,
announced that SRI would take
no new contracts leading to the
development of chemical or
biological warfare weapons.
Last May SRI had two
contracts in this area. One
involved particle distribution, and
the other the detection of
biological warfare. These

contracts, both unclassified,
involved only $50,000, so the
decision to cease this kind of
research resulted in no great
financial loss.
Appointed Advisory Board
Internal changes at SRI also
include an Institute Staff
Advisory Group formed last June.
The Advisory Group is intended
to provide "improved internal
communication between the staff
and management," according to
Dr. Felix Smith, chairman.
Protesters claimed last spring tha
SRI management was acting
without consulting the wishes of
the staff.

As Meaders explains the group,
"It is advisory, with no power."
But he adds that "it represents an
effort to factor into decisions the
opinions and collective wisdom of
the staff."
The Advisory Group is
appointed, rather than elected by
the staff. Each executive director
or vice-president gets to appoint a
certain number to the 75-man
group. Smith denies that the
selection procedure limits the
members' independence. "The
group's attitude is one of highly
independent people," he says.
"They can be highly critical of the
organization if they choose to
be."
Five months have passed since
last spring's demonstrations, but
neither the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL) nor Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) will ever
be the same.
Stanford has reassessed
questionable contracts with the
Defense Department and National
Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) and has
taken action to declassify projects
and bring them within the new
research guidelines. Twenty-five
Stanford Electronics Laboratory
(SEL) personnel, disgruntled by
the events of April and May, have
moved to SRI, taking several
contracts along with them.
SRI has changed, too. The
twenty-five new staff members
represent nearly one percent of
the total SRI personnel (2700,
down from 3200 last year). New
contracts haven't been coming in
as rapidly as before, but this is
due, SRI says, to a cutback in
government spending rather than
to the disruptions.
Different proposals for
separating SRI from Stanford are
being examined. The Board of
Trustees appointed a group to
study various possibilities, and it
appears that SRI will not be sold
to a private interest, but will
merely be separated and retain its
non-profit status.
SEL Readjusts
The Systems Theory
Laboratory of SEL, where most
of the research objected to was

centered, no longer exists. Two
new laboratories have been
created to research information
systems and digital systems.
The departure of 25 personnel
necessitated the reorganization,
and their move to SRI was
apparently accompanied by much
bitterness. Dr. David Bacon,
Associate Director of SEL, says
"None of them would have gone
to SRI if the university climate
had remained as it was before.
They felt the environment at the
university wasn't conducive to the
research they wished to do."
The former Stanford employees
now at SRI have refused to
discuss their move with The Daily,
but SRI public relations director
Homer Meaders reports, "Most of
those who came were unhappy
with Stanford, and felt betrayed."
As he further explained, "They
felt as if the lab were pulled out
from under them because of some
