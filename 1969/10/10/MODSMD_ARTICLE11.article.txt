## No Anticipation 
### W. E. Spicer 
If our decade has anything to
teach us, it is that one must try to
anticipate and take into account
the long-range consequence of any
change, no matter how beneficial
its immediate results may be.
Who, in the 1940's and 50's,
would argue against the drastic
reduction of malaria or increase in
food production brought about
by the use of DDT? Yet, today
our loss from the lack of foresight
into the possible adverse effects of
DDT is apparent. The same point
could be made about air
pollution, the gasoline engine, and
many other aspects of today's
world.
With this in mind, it seems
particularly unfortunate that the
University community has so
easily refused to examine the
concern of the foreign language
faculties over the long-range effect
of the rejecting of a language
requirement. The concern of the
foreign language faculty members
was directed at the effect of a lack
of a language requirement on the
teaching of languages in high
schools. They asked the members
of the Academic Council to
examine statistics on the matter
which they would present and to
think of the long-term effects on
the secondary schools.
The opponents never addressed
themselves to this point, but
rather examined the matter in
terms of its effect on Stanford.
Most appalling was the suggestion
by a member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents that the
motivation of the language faculty
was simply to preserve "... the
vested interest of a few faculty."
Surely such a demeaning and
shallow attack is to be regretted in
a university community.
Let us hope that in its haste for
self-improvement Stanford will
not fall guilty of the same

shortsightedness shown by
farmers and automakers.
