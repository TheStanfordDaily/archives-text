# 'It Ain't Easy'
## 'Activists' Meet 
### Marshall Kilduff 
There's a rumor going around
that the Faculty Club is now a
hotbed of activism. Just to check
the story out, I decided to go up
to the club's choice location on
the parking lot and next to the
bowling alley and folk dancing
deck of Tresidder.
Faster than you can say
Wolfgang Panofsky through a
mouthful of Granola, I ran into a
bunch of them talking to each
other. It looked like the real thing
all right.
"Listen, this is our big chance.
Hell, last spring I had a lot of
papers to correct when that AEL
thing came up. And, well, even
Encina was too much for most of
the students to take. The Daily
didn't like it, and all those student
presidents didn't back it either. So
there's nothing to make up for
there. But now this October 15th

thing looks right up our alley. The
moratorium's got a pretty big
bunch behind it." Here was a
shrewd political analyst.
Aggressive Observer
Another one took a chance.
"Well, you know, uh, we've got to
go more carefully on this thing.
I'm not too sure about those
senators that are for it, and I bet
they're probably not even up for
re-election. Let's hold back for a
while and see what happens." This
guy sounded the same as he
looked—pipe, snugly knit tie,
furrowed brow, only sweats on a
tennis court.
Then a third one started up.
"Gosh, I've talked to a lot of my
students—actually only the ones
in my encounter groups—and
they're all planning to canvass and
'rap with the people' (you could
hear him pronounce the quotes). I
think we can't go wrong this
time."
This was getting heavy, I could
tell. So I waded in a little further
to hear the rest. Shrewd political
analyst: "you may be right. After
all, maybe you guys have heard
about this guy Shea. Well, he's
running the Octoberfest, and you
know he won't try anything
funny. I think I'll just be
open-minded about the whole
thing and let them cut class if
they want to go and demonstrate.
Of course they'll have to get the
notes from somebody else, but
that shouldn't be any problem."
Rational Logic
It was snug tie's turn. "Some of
my engineering students have a
point. One of them told me that if
I was the one who had to pay all
that tuition money then I
wouldn't want to have my classes
cancelled for no good reason. He

also said that if they wanted to do
all this stuff then they could
damn well do it on the weekend
and save all the commotion. Now
there's clear rational logic that
you can't argue with."
He looked around. "Did you
guys see where all those eclairs
went? Ever since those SDSers
came in here and ate them all, the
service had gone to hell. They
should've all been booted; stealing
food like that."
Rap started up again, "I'm
going to take a stand on this.
What's the matter? Don't you
think I should? It's only one little
tiny day. This war is wrong, and
I'm going to oppose it. You guys
really ought to join this. They'll
be a parade with monitors and
only a few police and speeches in
Mem Chu by McCloskey and
other guys who've been against
the war from way back."
"But you know there's still one
thing that bothers me about all
these demonstrations. I'm all for
ending the war, but it's how to go
about it that I'm not so sure
about."
Safety in Numbers
Now the analyst was coming on
strong. "You know you just might
be right about it all. I hear there's
a list of over 200 faculty members
who're backing this thing. And I
know for a fact that one of them
actually went to an SDS meeting
to get their support. It's not true
that I only join big groups, I'm
not one of those safety-in
numbers people. It's just that
they're usually better organized
and have more workers."
1 looked at my watch, and it
was time for class. As I drove off,
I turned on the radio, "Christ you
know it ain't easy."
