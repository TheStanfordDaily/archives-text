# Rough Draft
## Written Deferments 
### Susan Swaringen 
Students who have not yet had
a 11-S seem to be divided about
whether or not they should make
a written request to their boards
for this deferment.
(If you have already held the
11-S, chances are that it was at
your request. The two cards in
your registration packet related to
University certification of your
full-time student status and do
not constitute a request for
deferment.)
If you request the 11-S you
incur these liabilities. You waive
your right to the fatherhood 111-A
deferment, you revert to the
prime age group when your
student deferment expires, and
your liability to induction is
extended from the age of 26 to
the age of 35. How serious these
liabilities are depends upon your
own situation and plans, you
upon your guess about future
changes in he law.
Hardship Defermenl
You are still entitled to
consideration for the hardship
111-A. The 19-year old prime age
group has yet to be established by
executive order, and it is not yet
clear on what basis men over 19
who have requested the 11-S
would revert to the prime age
group. And under current
regulations, though your liability

is extended to the age of 35, in
practice your vulnerability is not,
since men over 26 may be called
only after all available men under
26 have been drafted. This
priority of call within the I-A
classification is not likely to
change with any modification of
the current law.
Requesting the 11-S does not
interfere with consideration of a
claim to conscientious objection
or a claim to a medical deferment,
though as long as you hold the
11-S your board is not required to
consider either claim. They must
consider it upon the expiration of
your 11-Sand you may continue
to document either claim during
the time you are otherwise
deferred.
If you choose not to request
the 11-Sand if you have not
provided your board with other
information which justifies a
deferred classification, you may
expect to be classified I-A. You
then have the choice of beginning
the appeal process, by requesting
either a personal appearance
before your board or an appeal to
the state appeal board, or of
waiving those appeal rights by
doing nothing. If you do not
appeal and are over 19 you can
expect to be ordered for a
pre-induction physical, and if
found acceptable you may
thereafter receive an induction
order. If you are a full-time
undergraduate student when you
receive the induction order you
are entitled to the I-S(C)
classification.
Ri}»li tto Appeal
The I-S(C) cancels the order to
report until the end of the
academic year when you must be
reclassified I-A in order to be
called again. Once you are
classified I-A your appeal rights
begin again. And you may not be
ordered to report while you have
a classification on appeal. It is
important to remember that
following reclassification you have
an absolute right to appeal, both
to your board and to the state
appeal board.
The liklihood of change in the
current regulations is harder to
assess. Hearings are now being
conducted in the House Armed
Services Committee on the issue
of a lottery—changing the order to
call from oldest first (age 25 down
to age 19) to random selection.
Presumably, if a lottery receives
Congressional approval it would
bo established in conjunction with
a prime age group. The prime ago
group is understood to consist of
19 year olds, others under 26 not
currently deferred, and those who
have hold a deferment since July
1, 1967. Congressional action is
necessary to establish a random
order of call though President
Nixon has the authority to
stablish a prime ago group by
executive order. The whole issue
of deferments, whether and how
they might continue, has not yet
been a subject of testimony.
