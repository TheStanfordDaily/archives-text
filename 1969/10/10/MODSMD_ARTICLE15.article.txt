# Beta Chi Experiments
## Creative Performance Fraternity 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
A class of actors, most of them barefoot and in bluejeans
is told to create a tribal village.
They are then instructed to forego any 20th century,
intellectual approaches to he task, but to keep in mind the
basic essentials of life—food, shelter, clothing, a way of
uniting the group, a hierarchical structure, a set of rules,
and homage to that rule.
The improisation is to be non-verbal, but the actors can
grunt, burp, giggle, and use any other form of wordless
vocalization.
The class is "Exploration of Theater Forms; Ritual as
Elemental Communications;" the setting is the Beta Chi
Community for the Performing Arts.
The Beta Chi community, according to resident and
organizer Bob Walters, is a project in the arts, involving
house encounter groups, discussions, evening classes, and
theatrical productions.
"The basic idea of the Beta Chi Community," Walters
said finally, "is to get together a group of people who are
interested in the performing arts, in exploring and
expanding their own individual creativity, and to inspire
group creativity in a supportive atmosphere.
Tribal Immprovisation
The "Ritual Class" is currently the only project
rendering academic credit to participants.
But last Tuesday night's exercise in tribal improvisation
was far from academic in the sense of what Walters termed
"the staying in one place, doing the classroom and writing
thing."
As a spectator, I was not only enthralled with the
authenticity of what the actors experienced emotionally
but also of the spontaneity with which the individuals
reacted to the needs of one another and communicated
these needs with their faces and their bodies.
The group enters a dimly-lit room. There are grunts and
giggles.
An individual tips over a chair. "Aha, oh ah, bah, guu,
naha ..." he explains.

Shelter! The group catches on. "Ada, ada ..." Someone
builds a house out of pillows.
"Noo, eep, ish, ogg, hahaha." Someone discovers a loaf
of bread, and the group chortles in ecstasy. And
water . . .someone else discovers a pitcher of water, and the
group is in an uproar of delight.
Bread and shelter, aha, aha eeeeeeeee.
A cat wandering in the hall is freaked out by the
"savages."
The bread becomes a delight too powerful for only vocal
sounds. A girl begins to clap her hands and jump up and
down. Her pleasure is contagious and soon the whole group
begins to clap their hands and stomp on the floor. Dance is
discovered. Rhythm flows so spontaneously with the
hand-made music that signing and chanting soon follow.
Then the unexplainable happens. Someone drops out of
the group for a moment and starts to flash the lights.
Ah, oow, aba, onk, onvie? The people are astounded.
Confused pandemonium breaks out as man is first
confronted with the "forces of nature."
The women scream. The man are baffled. They quarrel,
(eaz, or to meanibefa, nasta, nasta, moo, gasawa!!!) The
lights go out.
Fear is overwhelming. Is there no one to protect the
group? No one to advise them what to do?
"Rooua" is heard above the din. Rrrouohaaaaah," a boy
announces solemnly, and a monarch is coronated.
"Brrrrroosh," he beseeched, lifting his outstretched palms
to the heavens.
"Br-r-roosh," his congregation answers, looking upward.
And man discovers god.
"Beclch"
This evening class is only one of Beta Chi's activities in
the performing arts.
Rehearsals have already started for their fall production,
"Beclch" (pronounced, "Beckleck"), which incorporates 13
actors, 6 musicians, and 4 dancers into a thematic story

about the schism that is created jn men by society. Man, in
the play, is forced to chose either to take an active
(aggressive) role or a passive (submissive) one.
"Beclch was written by Rochelle Owens, a New York
playwright, and was performed in Philadelphia. The Beta
Chi performance will open for two sneak previews on
November 7 and 8 for faculty and alumni. Performances for
the campus are scheduled to begin on November 11.
Other Activities
Beta Chi is also sponsoring a weekly Monday night
Roundtable Discussion, bringing in different people each
week to make introductory remarks.
I hey are also planning to have a Wednesday night
encounter group.
The community is trying to publish a quarterly with
iniormation about performing arts in the area, in addition
to an already initiated Newsletter that the house prints
describing campus activities in the performing arts.
Plans are also underway for a dance workshop and
perhaps a special presentation for October 15th.
The group is finally contemplating the future
organization of a summer high school arts workshop,
consisting of two six-week sessions for thirty students,
taught by University faculty and graduate students.
One of the most significant renovation projects now
underway at Beta Chi is the conversion of the upstairs
sleeping porch into a theater seating 100 people.
A significant problem involved in building the theater
and maintaining the Community, however, is financing.
"So far," Walters explained, "everything that's been
happening has been coming out of our own pockets" in the
form of part of the residents' room payments and
individual contributions.
"We're going to initiate a hard push for money soon," he
continued, and pointed out that the residents plan to
approach several foundations for further financing.
However, "so far, we are a noble, impoverished
endeavor."

However, "so far, we are a noble, impoverished
endeavor."
A class of actors, most of them barefoot and in bluejeans
is told to create a tribal village.
They are then instructed to forego any 20th century,
intellectual approaches to he task, but to keep in mind the
basic essentials of life—food, shelter, clothing, a way of
uniting the group, a hierarchical structure, a set of rules,
and homage to that rule.
The improisation is to be non-verbal, but the actors can
grunt, burp, giggle, and use any other form of wordless
vocalization.
The class is "Exploration of Theater Forms; Ritual as
Elemental Communications;" the setting is the Beta Chi
Community for the Performing Arts.
The Beta Chi community, according to resident and
organizer Bob Walters, is a project in the arts, involving
house encounter groups, discussions, evening classes, and
theatrical productions.
"The basic idea of the Beta Chi Community," Walters
said finally, "is to get together a group of people who are
interested in the performing arts, in exploring and
expanding their own individual creativity, and to inspire
group creativity in a supportive atmosphere.
Tribal Immprovisation
The "Ritual Class" is currently the only project
rendering academic credit to participants.
But last Tuesday night's exercise in tribal improvisation
was far from academic in the sense of what Walters termed
"the staying in one place, doing the classroom and writing
thing."
As a spectator, I was not only enthralled with the
authenticity of what the actors experienced emotionally
but also of the spontaneity with which the individuals
reacted to the needs of one another and communicated
these needs with their faces and their bodies.
The group enters a dimly-lit room. There are grunts and
giggles.
An individual tips over a chair. "Aha, oh ah, bah, guu,
naha ..." he explains.

Shelter! The group catches on. "Ada, ada ..." Someone
builds a house out of pillows.
"Noo, eep, ish, ogg, hahaha." Someone discovers a loaf
of bread, and the group chortles in ecstasy. And
water . . .someone else discovers a pitcher of water, and the
group is in an uproar of delight.
Bread and shelter, aha, aha eeeeeeeee.
A cat wandering in the hall is freaked out by the
"savages."
The bread becomes a delight too powerful for only vocal
sounds. A girl begins to clap her hands and jump up and
down. Her pleasure is contagious and soon the whole group
begins to clap their hands and stomp on the floor. Dance is
discovered. Rhythm flows so spontaneously with the
hand-made music that signing and chanting soon follow.
Then the unexplainable happens. Someone drops out of
the group for a moment and starts to flash the lights.
Ah, oow, aba, onk, onvie? The people are astounded.
Confused pandemonium breaks out as man is first
confronted with the "forces of nature."
The women scream. The man are baffled. They quarrel,
(eaz, or to meanibefa, nasta, nasta, moo, gasawa!!!) The
lights go out.
Fear is overwhelming. Is there no one to protect the
group? No one to advise them what to do?
"Rooua" is heard above the din. Rrrouohaaaaah," a boy
announces solemnly, and a monarch is coronated.
"Brrrrroosh," he beseeched, lifting his outstretched palms
to the heavens.
"Br-r-roosh," his congregation answers, looking upward.
And man discovers god.
"Beclch"
This evening class is only one of Beta Chi's activities in
the performing arts.
Rehearsals have already started for their fall production,
"Beclch" (pronounced, "Beckleck"), which incorporates 13
actors, 6 musicians, and 4 dancers into a thematic story

about the schism that is created jn men by society. Man, in
the play, is forced to chose either to take an active
(aggressive) role or a passive (submissive) one.
"Beclch was written by Rochelle Owens, a New York
playwright, and was performed in Philadelphia. The Beta
Chi performance will open for two sneak previews on
November 7 and 8 for faculty and alumni. Performances for
the campus are scheduled to begin on November 11.
Other Activities
Beta Chi is also sponsoring a weekly Monday night
Roundtable Discussion, bringing in different people each
week to make introductory remarks.
I hey are also planning to have a Wednesday night
encounter group.
The community is trying to publish a quarterly with
iniormation about performing arts in the area, in addition
to an already initiated Newsletter that the house prints
describing campus activities in the performing arts.
Plans are also underway for a dance workshop and
perhaps a special presentation for October 15th.
The group is finally contemplating the future
organization of a summer high school arts workshop,
consisting of two six-week sessions for thirty students,
taught by University faculty and graduate students.
One of the most significant renovation projects now
underway at Beta Chi is the conversion of the upstairs
sleeping porch into a theater seating 100 people.
A significant problem involved in building the theater
and maintaining the Community, however, is financing.
"So far," Walters explained, "everything that's been
happening has been coming out of our own pockets" in the
form of part of the residents' room payments and
individual contributions.
"We're going to initiate a hard push for money soon," he
continued, and pointed out that the residents plan to
approach several foundations for further financing.

continued, and pointed out that the residents plan to
approach several foundations for further financing.
However, "so far, we are a noble, impoverished
endeavor."
A class of actors, most of them barefoot and in bluejeans
is told to create a tribal village.
They are then instructed to forego any 20th century,
intellectual approaches to he task, but to keep in mind the
basic essentials of life—food, shelter, clothing, a way of
uniting the group, a hierarchical structure, a set of rules,
and homage to that rule.
The improisation is to be non-verbal, but the actors can
grunt, burp, giggle, and use any other form of wordless
vocalization.
The class is "Exploration of Theater Forms; Ritual as
Elemental Communications;" the setting is the Beta Chi
Community for the Performing Arts.
The Beta Chi community, according to resident and
organizer Bob Walters, is a project in the arts, involving
house encounter groups, discussions, evening classes, and
theatrical productions.
"The basic idea of the Beta Chi Community," Walters
said finally, "is to get together a group of people who are
interested in the performing arts, in exploring and
expanding their own individual creativity, and to inspire
group creativity in a supportive atmosphere.
Tribal Immprovisation
The "Ritual Class" is currently the only project
rendering academic credit to participants.
But last Tuesday night's exercise in tribal improvisation
was far from academic in the sense of what Walters termed
"the staying in one place, doing the classroom and writing
thing."
As a spectator, I was not only enthralled with the
authenticity of what the actors experienced emotionally
but also of the spontaneity with which the individuals
reacted to the needs of one another and communicated
these needs with their faces and their bodies.
The group enters a dimly-lit room. There are grunts and
giggles.
An individual tips over a chair. "Aha, oh ah, bah, guu,
naha ..." he explains.

Shelter! The group catches on. "Ada, ada ..." Someone
builds a house out of pillows.
"Noo, eep, ish, ogg, hahaha." Someone discovers a loaf
of bread, and the group chortles in ecstasy. And
water . . .someone else discovers a pitcher of water, and the
group is in an uproar of delight.
Bread and shelter, aha, aha eeeeeeeee.
A cat wandering in the hall is freaked out by the
"savages."
The bread becomes a delight too powerful for only vocal
sounds. A girl begins to clap her hands and jump up and
down. Her pleasure is contagious and soon the whole group
begins to clap their hands and stomp on the floor. Dance is
discovered. Rhythm flows so spontaneously with the
hand-made music that signing and chanting soon follow.
Then the unexplainable happens. Someone drops out of
the group for a moment and starts to flash the lights.
Ah, oow, aba, onk, onvie? The people are astounded.
Confused pandemonium breaks out as man is first
confronted with the "forces of nature."
The women scream. The man are baffled. They quarrel,
(eaz, or to meanibefa, nasta, nasta, moo, gasawa!!!) The
lights go out.
Fear is overwhelming. Is there no one to protect the
group? No one to advise them what to do?
"Rooua" is heard above the din. Rrrouohaaaaah," a boy
announces solemnly, and a monarch is coronated.
"Brrrrroosh," he beseeched, lifting his outstretched palms
to the heavens.
"Br-r-roosh," his congregation answers, looking upward.
And man discovers god.
"Beclch"
This evening class is only one of Beta Chi's activities in
the performing arts.
Rehearsals have already started for their fall production,
"Beclch" (pronounced, "Beckleck"), which incorporates 13
actors, 6 musicians, and 4 dancers into a thematic story

about the schism that is created jn men by society. Man, in
the play, is forced to chose either to take an active
(aggressive) role or a passive (submissive) one.
"Beclch was written by Rochelle Owens, a New York
playwright, and was performed in Philadelphia. The Beta
Chi performance will open for two sneak previews on
November 7 and 8 for faculty and alumni. Performances for
the campus are scheduled to begin on November 11.
Other Activities
Beta Chi is also sponsoring a weekly Monday night
Roundtable Discussion, bringing in different people each
week to make introductory remarks.
I hey are also planning to have a Wednesday night
encounter group.
The community is trying to publish a quarterly with
iniormation about performing arts in the area, in addition
to an already initiated Newsletter that the house prints
describing campus activities in the performing arts.
Plans are also underway for a dance workshop and
perhaps a special presentation for October 15th.
The group is finally contemplating the future
organization of a summer high school arts workshop,
consisting of two six-week sessions for thirty students,
taught by University faculty and graduate students.
One of the most significant renovation projects now
underway at Beta Chi is the conversion of the upstairs
sleeping porch into a theater seating 100 people.
A significant problem involved in building the theater
and maintaining the Community, however, is financing.
"So far," Walters explained, "everything that's been
happening has been coming out of our own pockets" in the
form of part of the residents' room payments and
individual contributions.
