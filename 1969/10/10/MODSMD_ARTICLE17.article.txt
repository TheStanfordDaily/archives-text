The Biology Curriculum
Committee has tentatively
decided to offer Bio 10 again this
spring and to try to implement a
new core curriculum beginning in
the Fall, 1970. The new courses
will probably include a choice
between the present 11-12 series
in botany and invertebrate
biology and a new course in
"Organismal Biology."
These proposals are subject to
consideration by the
newly-formed Implementation
Committee, according to Marty
Cogan, a student member of the
Biology Curriculum Committee.
The results of the Implementation
Committee should be known
before winter pre-reg begins.
Word of the upcoming
curriculum changes was leaked
out to several students and spread
through the grapevine. Rumors
were circulated during registration
that students interested in or
needing biology would have to
take it this quarter because it
would not be offered again before
Spring quarter, 1971. As a result,
some 700 students registered for
the course this quarter before
registration was closed.
