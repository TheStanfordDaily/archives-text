# Law Students Question Future Employers
## 
### DICK TODD 
A questionnaire to be sent to
law firms planning to interview
here is being written by the
Placement Committee of the
Stanford Law St u dents
Association.
The questionnaire will ask the
firms to give information
regarding the number of minority
employees they have in positions
ranging from attorneys to
secretary to janitor, the number
and status of their women
employees, and their policies and
attitudes in the area of public
service. The questions on public
service will make up the bulk of
the survey and include topics like
consumer protection, civil
liberties, environmental control,
and social and judicial reform.
A tentative questionnaire was
developed in meetings of the
Placement Committee last
weekend. The committee drew
heavily from a field-tested
questionnaire submitted to them
by Edgar Cahn of the Citizens
Advocate Center and Jean Cahn
of the Urban Law Institute. Their
questions were designed to be

both answerable yet hard to
evade. In addition, several
questions on the status of
minority and women employees
were suggested in a questionnaire
sent by a group of Harvard
students.
The Harvard students' ideas
include an almost unprecedented
call for inter-law school
cooperation. They have asked
students at a number of top law
schools to simultaneously submit
questionnaires to the nation's law
firms in a coordinated effort to
bring reform pressure on them.
Stanford students hope to have
their survey ready in two to four
weeks. The tentative
questionanire must be recirculated
to the Placement Committee and
a final draft agreed upon. This
final draft will probably be sent
out immediately to the law firms
with a request that they merely
think about it. Next summer the
questionnaire will become an
official part of the Placement
Committee's invitation to law
firms to recruit at Stanford.
Since the questionanire is
entirely a student affair and not a

function of Stanford University, it
will be sent out under the
letterhead of the Law Students
Association.
The questionnaire is designed
to encourage a high percentage of
replies. A smaller survey
concerning minority hiring was
sent out by Stanford students last
year, but poor response hampered
its effectiveness. Professor Felton
Henderson of the law school said
that only firms whose records
looked good replied. He viewed a
bovcott by law students of firms
whose policies were undesirable as
"somehow being effective" in
forcing reforms.
