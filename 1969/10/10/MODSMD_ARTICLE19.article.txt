# Meeting Sunday Austrian Campus
## 
### 
Vienna is a sphinx whose riddle
seems incomprehensible to most
Americans. She is a mysterious
blend on past and present, of East
and West. She can make one
uncomfortable on comfortable
depending upon one's capacity to
live with a mystery.
There will be a meeting of all
students interested in the
Stanford-in-Austria program
Sunday night in the Tresidder
Large Lounge at 8:30 p.m.
Former students will be present to
help explain the program.
Sielerstatte 30, the home of the
Stanford campus in Austria
occupies a unique position in
Vienna where prestigious location
is measured by distance from the
opera house celebrating its
centennial this year. The
Studentheim is only two blocks
away. There one can see Nureyev
dance, Leonard Bernstein
conduct, or a different opera
every night of the week during the
9 month season for only 40 cents.
The Studentheim itself does
not reflect its former splendor as
palace of Archduke Karl and
shelter for the first Christmas tree
is Austria. However, the campus is
within walking distance of small
palaces, many parks, the Imperial
Palace complex where the Spanish
Riding school and the Vienna
Boys Chorus perform—Parliament,
City Hall, the University, and
Stephansdom, the cathedral of
Vienna.
Vienna and Austria have much
to contribute to present
understanding of our age for
Austria of all Western countries
experiences the complaint of our
age —a lack of identity. Austria is
indeed not the power it was; it is
essentially a country which has
been forced to exist. Sometimes it
is too cruel to remember this lack.
Students tired of city life can
go 15 miles outside of Vienna to
meet incredible people who can
accept others in a most human

and relaxed atmosphere. One can
go to the mountains to ski in the
winter, hike in the summer and to
start remembering again what is
around one.
What is around Austria are the
Eastern European countries of
Yugoslavia, Hungary and
Czechoslavakia. A student with
little money and a knowledge of
German can learn much from the
Czechoslavakian who says "We do
not work because the Russians
will get the surpluses" or from the
sight of tanks and the sting of tear
gas on an anniversary day. One
can see the experiments of Tito's
socialism.
Motivated by these types of
opportunities, the students in
recent Austria groups have
initiated courses on Eastern
European countries whose
experiences the Viennese cannot
and will not forget.
