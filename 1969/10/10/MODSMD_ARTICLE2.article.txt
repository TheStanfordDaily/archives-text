# Moratorium Support Grows Across Campus, Nation
## 
### 
Next Wednesday's Moratorium
is rapidly growing into a
nationwide movement that will
involve persons of all ages,
including politicians, businessmen
and professional people, as well as
the students who started it.
Rallies, speeches, marches and
religious services in almost every
state will be capped by a 5 p.m.
candlelight procession around the
White House.
Sponsors plan to have 45,000
marchers in the Washington
procession. They will be led by
the widow of the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.
Seventeen senators and 47
congressmen have expressed
support so long as the moratorium
is "peaceful, lawful, and
nonviolent."
Plans to keep the House in
session all night on Oct. 14 as a
symbol of protest against the war
were disclosed by Rep. Benjamin
Rosenthal (D-N.Y.) who said
enough speakers have been lined
up to talk through the night.
Names of war dead will be read
at hundreds of ceremonies,
including one in New York's Wall
Street, where financial workers
are scheduled to take part along
with Mayor John Lindsay and
former Deputy Defense Secretary
Roswell Gilpatric.
In New Haven, Connecticut
Monday, Yale President Kingman
Brewer expressed sympathy for
the Moratorium, but explained
that he could not give "positive
University sanction to the
interruption of normal
educational activities."
Emphasizing thy need for the
University to remain neutral in its
official stance, Brewer noted that
Yale would not "stand in the way
of individual faculty and student
expression of concern, as long as

educational functions aren't
unduly hampered."
Here at Stanford, the organizers
of Moratorium Day are now
planning final details, as more
than $500 in contributions have
been collected to support the
movement. In an organizational
meeting last night attended by
almost 200 students, prime
attention was given to the
activities of Moratorium Day,
particularly canvassing.
David Jones, a former Barry
Goldwater supporter who worked
for Eugene McCarthy last year,
spoke of the frustrations involved
in canvassing. He warned the
group, "You can expect to be told
to go to Russia; you can expect to
be asked if you'll be ready to fight
them when they invade Redwood
City."
SDS member Lenny Siegel
explained at the meeting the
position of the SDS on the
Moratorium. On the 15th, SDS
will focus its efforts on the
Industrial Park, leafleting blue
collar and professional workers
from factories that produce war
materials. Such industries as
Lockheed Missile and Space
Company will also be picketed,
according to Siegel.
John Kramer student chairman
for the Moratorium disclosed that
Stanford students will be
leafletting local shopping centers,
the Stanford Parents Day this
Saturday, and the USC football
game in the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
Chairman of the Black Student
Union, Leo Bazile, announced his
group's support of precinct and
organizational work for the
moratorium.
To inform the public fully on
the Moratorium, a full scale press
conference will be held at the

Sheraton Palace Hotel in San
Francisco next Monday at 10 a.m.
Representing Stanford will be Pat
Shea, member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, and
Professor Martin Perl of the
Linear Accelerator Center.
With mixed success,
non-academic peace workers in
San Mateo, Palo Alto, and San
Jose are encouraging community
support of the Vietnam
Moratorium.
Douglas J. Mattern, an electron
microscopist at Fairchild
Industries and Moratorium leader
for Palo Alto, said his group's
activities have turned up 50
homeowners in that city, Los
Altos, Menlo Park, and Mountain
View who will act as "homebase"
for Stanford students canvassing
their neighborhoods.
The major activities for the
Palo Alto community on
Moratorium Day will be a "Stop
the Killing" march at 12 noon.
Moratorium leaders in Palo Alto
see this as an opportunity for
citizens who want an immediate
end to the war to show their
peaceful support of the Vietnam
Moratorium. Residents will gather
at Cogswell Park on Lytton
Avenue, march to University
Avenue and down to Middlefield
Road, then return to the Park.
Signs depicting Vietnam casualties
will be carried by 100 residents.
Peninsula peace workers are
also soliciting political support of
the Moratorium by asking
governmental organizations to
pass resolutions favoring an
immediate end to the war. The
San Mateo and Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors and
the Palo Alto City Council will all
be asked to pass such resolutions
at their meetings next week.

end to the war to show their
peaceful support of the Vietnam
Moratorium. Residents will gather
at Cogswell Park on Lytton
Avenue, march to University
Avenue and down to Middlefield
Road, then return to the Park.
Signs depicting Vietnam casualties
will be carried by 100 residents.
Peninsula peace workers are
also soliciting political support of
the Moratorium by asking
governmental organizations to
pass resolutions favoring an
immediate end to the war. The
San Mateo and Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors and
the Palo Alto City Council will all
be asked to pass such resolutions
at their meetings next week.
Next Wednesday's Moratorium
is rapidly growing into a
nationwide movement that will
involve persons of all ages,
including politicians, businessmen
and professional people, as well as
the students who started it.
Rallies, speeches, marches and
religious services in almost every
state will be capped by a 5 p.m.
candlelight procession around the
White House.
Sponsors plan to have 45,000
marchers in the Washington
procession. They will be led by
the widow of the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.
Seventeen senators and 47
congressmen have expressed
support so long as the moratorium
is "peaceful, lawful, and
nonviolent."
Plans to keep the House in
session all night on Oct. 14 as a
symbol of protest against the war
were disclosed by Rep. Benjamin
Rosenthal (D-N.Y.) who said
enough speakers have been lined
up to talk through the night.
Names of war dead will be read
at hundreds of ceremonies,
including one in New York's Wall
Street, where financial workers
are scheduled to take part along
with Mayor John Lindsay and
former Deputy Defense Secretary
Roswell Gilpatric.
In New Haven, Connecticut
Monday, Yale President Kingman
Brewer expressed sympathy for
the Moratorium, but explained
that he could not give "positive
University sanction to the
interruption of normal
educational activities."
Emphasizing thy need for the
University to remain neutral in its
official stance, Brewer noted that
Yale would not "stand in the way
of individual faculty and student
expression of concern, as long as

educational functions aren't
unduly hampered."
Here at Stanford, the organizers
of Moratorium Day are now
planning final details, as more
than $500 in contributions have
been collected to support the
movement. In an organizational
meeting last night attended by
almost 200 students, prime
attention was given to the
activities of Moratorium Day,
particularly canvassing.
David Jones, a former Barry
Goldwater supporter who worked
for Eugene McCarthy last year,
spoke of the frustrations involved
in canvassing. He warned the
group, "You can expect to be told
to go to Russia; you can expect to
be asked if you'll be ready to fight
them when they invade Redwood
City."
SDS member Lenny Siegel
explained at the meeting the
position of the SDS on the
Moratorium. On the 15th, SDS
will focus its efforts on the
Industrial Park, leafleting blue
collar and professional workers
from factories that produce war
materials. Such industries as
Lockheed Missile and Space
Company will also be picketed,
according to Siegel.
John Kramer student chairman
for the Moratorium disclosed that
Stanford students will be
leafletting local shopping centers,
the Stanford Parents Day this
Saturday, and the USC football
game in the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
Chairman of the Black Student
Union, Leo Bazile, announced his
group's support of precinct and
organizational work for the
moratorium.
To inform the public fully on
the Moratorium, a full scale press
conference will be held at the

Sheraton Palace Hotel in San
Francisco next Monday at 10 a.m.
Representing Stanford will be Pat
Shea, member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, and
Professor Martin Perl of the
Linear Accelerator Center.
With mixed success,
non-academic peace workers in
San Mateo, Palo Alto, and San
Jose are encouraging community
support of the Vietnam
Moratorium.
Douglas J. Mattern, an electron
microscopist at Fairchild
Industries and Moratorium leader
for Palo Alto, said his group's
activities have turned up 50
homeowners in that city, Los
Altos, Menlo Park, and Mountain
View who will act as "homebase"
for Stanford students canvassing
their neighborhoods.
The major activities for the
Palo Alto community on
Moratorium Day will be a "Stop
the Killing" march at 12 noon.

support of the Vietnam
Moratorium.
Douglas J. Mattern, an electron
microscopist at Fairchild
Industries and Moratorium leader
for Palo Alto, said his group's
activities have turned up 50
homeowners in that city, Los
Altos, Menlo Park, and Mountain
View who will act as "homebase"
for Stanford students canvassing
their neighborhoods.
The major activities for the
Palo Alto community on
Moratorium Day will be a "Stop
the Killing" march at 12 noon.
Moratorium leaders in Palo Alto
see this as an opportunity for
citizens who want an immediate
end to the war to show their
peaceful support of the Vietnam
Moratorium. Residents will gather
at Cogswell Park on Lytton
Avenue, march to University
Avenue and down to Middlefield
Road, then return to the Park.
Signs depicting Vietnam casualties
will be carried by 100 residents.
Peninsula peace workers are
also soliciting political support of
the Moratorium by asking
governmental organizations to
pass resolutions favoring an
immediate end to the war. The
San Mateo and Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors and
the Palo Alto City Council will all
be asked to pass such resolutions
at their meetings next week.
Next Wednesday's Moratorium
is rapidly growing into a
nationwide movement that will
involve persons of all ages,
including politicians, businessmen
and professional people, as well as
the students who started it.
Rallies, speeches, marches and
religious services in almost every
state will be capped by a 5 p.m.
candlelight procession around the
White House.
Sponsors plan to have 45,000
marchers in the Washington
procession. They will be led by
the widow of the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.
Seventeen senators and 47
congressmen have expressed
support so long as the moratorium
is "peaceful, lawful, and
nonviolent."
Plans to keep the House in
session all night on Oct. 14 as a
symbol of protest against the war
were disclosed by Rep. Benjamin
Rosenthal (D-N.Y.) who said
enough speakers have been lined
up to talk through the night.
Names of war dead will be read
at hundreds of ceremonies,
including one in New York's Wall
Street, where financial workers
are scheduled to take part along
with Mayor John Lindsay and
former Deputy Defense Secretary
Roswell Gilpatric.
In New Haven, Connecticut
Monday, Yale President Kingman
Brewer expressed sympathy for
the Moratorium, but explained
that he could not give "positive
University sanction to the
interruption of normal
educational activities."
Emphasizing thy need for the
University to remain neutral in its
official stance, Brewer noted that
Yale would not "stand in the way
of individual faculty and student
expression of concern, as long as

educational functions aren't
unduly hampered."
Here at Stanford, the organizers
of Moratorium Day are now
planning final details, as more
than $500 in contributions have
been collected to support the
movement. In an organizational
meeting last night attended by
almost 200 students, prime
attention was given to the
activities of Moratorium Day,
particularly canvassing.
David Jones, a former Barry
Goldwater supporter who worked
for Eugene McCarthy last year,
spoke of the frustrations involved
in canvassing. He warned the
group, "You can expect to be told
to go to Russia; you can expect to
be asked if you'll be ready to fight
them when they invade Redwood
City."
SDS member Lenny Siegel
explained at the meeting the
position of the SDS on the
Moratorium. On the 15th, SDS
will focus its efforts on the
Industrial Park, leafleting blue
collar and professional workers
from factories that produce war
materials. Such industries as
Lockheed Missile and Space
Company will also be picketed,
according to Siegel.
John Kramer student chairman
for the Moratorium disclosed that
Stanford students will be
leafletting local shopping centers,
the Stanford Parents Day this
Saturday, and the USC football
game in the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
Chairman of the Black Student
Union, Leo Bazile, announced his
group's support of precinct and
organizational work for the
moratorium.
To inform the public fully on
the Moratorium, a full scale press
conference will be held at the

Sheraton Palace Hotel in San
Francisco next Monday at 10 a.m.
Representing Stanford will be Pat
Shea, member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, and
Professor Martin Perl of the
Linear Accelerator Center.
With mixed success,
non-academic peace workers in
San Mateo, Palo Alto, and San
Jose are encouraging community
support of the Vietnam
Moratorium.
