# Beat Grad Requirements For Fun And (Mostly) Profit

### YALE BRAUNSTEIN 
Stanford measures a graduate
student's residence in terms of
dollars. In normal cases—without
transfer credit or degrees from
other graduate schools—one must
pay a minimum of nine quarters'
tuition to get a Ph.D. Other
degrees have other price tags. This
system has been in effect for
years, and many graduate students
have planned accordingly.
If one has a fellowship that
pays tuition for three years, the
system is irrelevant. If one is a
teaching assistant or research
assistant, the "tuition credit card"
pays fake dollars for the student's
tuition at the rate of nine units a
quarter. And those students who
pay their own way usually do so
in three full-time years. Although
this seems straight-forward, it is
anything but that when a
combination of grants, jobs, and
one's own resources are used.
So—a student has a fellowship
his first year and is a TA for the
next two. His department has
encouraged him to take a full load
while he was a TA, so he has

completed his course work in
three years. But he still owes the
system 36 units of tuition or
about $1700. (This was calculated
by first figuring the units owed,
135-45-27-27 = 36, and then
charging for them at $715 per
quarter.)
Just Suppose
Now let us suppose that
funding has stopped. This is quite
a sum for one to pay. Or we could
assume that the student is getting
a grant that has to pay for tuition
and living expenses, and we will
further assume that the grant is all
in real money (no "credit card"
fake money). In either of these
cases, any reduction in the tuition
owed will directly benefit the
student by giving him more
spending money.
This is nothing new and has
been known by graduate students
and department chairmen alike
for years. However, I now have to
ask all administrators and
department chairmen to read no
further so that the option to be
related will stay in effect.
The knowledgable student now
goes to see Miss Mcintosh in the
Graduate Office in the Old Union,
becomes a Terminal Graduate
Registrant, and has his tuition
"frozen." What this does is enable
one to pay tuition at the old
(lower) rates that were in effect
when he was a less than full-time
student. By paying 18 units at
$590 per quarter and 18 at $640,

he now owes about $1460, a
savings of $240. (The units that
can be charged off at old rates are
the differences between 45 and
those paid for by tuition credit
cards each year, etc.)
Belter Yet
But this is not all—the story
gets even better. Every quarter the
TGR fee of $50 is paid, the
amount owed is reduced by a like
sum. And the balanced owed need
not be paid until one gets his
degree; in effect the university is
giving the student an interest free
loan. (This analysis is courtesy of
fellow economics graduate
students.) In the (unlikely?) event
one never does finish, the amount
"owed" need never be paid.
In this manner we have turned
a grant of $2500 plus $1700 for
tuition that an advanced graduate
student may have into one worth
$2740 above tuition plus an
interest free loan of $1310, the
missing $150 paying the TGR
fees.
You say, "There must be a
catch," and you are right. But it is
a small one. You have to be able
to meet the TGR requirements. If
you have been admitted into
candidacy, you are set. If not, you
need a note from your
department stating that you have
completed the formal course
requirements for the degree. The
Graduate Office has forms for
this.

If one has a fellowship that
pays tuition for three years, the
system is irrelevant. If one is a
teaching assistant or research
assistant, the "tuition credit card"
pays fake dollars for the student's
tuition at the rate of nine units a
quarter. And those students who
pay their own way usually do so
in three full-time years. Although
this seems straight-forward, it is
anything but that when a
combination of grants, jobs, and
one's own resources are used.
So—a student has a fellowship
his first year and is a TA for the
next two. His department has
encouraged him to take a full load
while he was a TA, so he has

completed his course work in
three years. But he still owes the
system 36 units of tuition or
about $1700. (This was calculated
by first figuring the units owed,
135-45-27-27 = 36, and then
charging for them at $715 per
quarter.)
Just Suppose
Now let us suppose that
funding has stopped. This is quite
a sum for one to pay. Or we could
assume that the student is getting
a grant that has to pay for tuition
and living expenses, and we will
further assume that the grant is all
in real money (no "credit card"
fake money). In either of these
cases, any reduction in the tuition
owed will directly benefit the
student by giving him more
spending money.
This is nothing new and has
been known by graduate students
and department chairmen alike
for years. However, I now have to
ask all administrators and
department chairmen to read no
further so that the option to be
related will stay in effect.
The knowledgable student now
goes to see Miss Mcintosh in the
Graduate Office in the Old Union,
becomes a Terminal Graduate
Registrant, and has his tuition
"frozen." What this does is enable
one to pay tuition at the old
(lower) rates that were in effect
when he was a less than full-time
student. By paying 18 units at
$590 per quarter and 18 at $640,

he now owes about $1460, a
savings of $240. (The units that
can be charged off at old rates are
the differences between 45 and
those paid for by tuition credit
cards each year, etc.)
Belter Yet
But this is not all—the story
gets even better. Every quarter the
TGR fee of $50 is paid, the
amount owed is reduced by a like
sum. And the balanced owed need
not be paid until one gets his
degree; in effect the university is
giving the student an interest free
loan. (This analysis is courtesy of
fellow economics graduate
students.) In the (unlikely?) event
one never does finish, the amount
"owed" need never be paid.
In this manner we have turned
a grant of $2500 plus $1700 for
tuition that an advanced graduate
student may have into one worth
$2740 above tuition plus an
interest free loan of $1310, the
missing $150 paying the TGR
fees.
You say, "There must be a
catch," and you are right. But it is
a small one. You have to be able
to meet the TGR requirements. If
you have been admitted into
candidacy, you are set. If not, you
need a note from your
department stating that you have
completed the formal course
requirements for the degree. The
Graduate Office has forms for
this.
