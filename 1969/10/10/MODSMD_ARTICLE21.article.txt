# The
						Classical Groove: Fidelio
## Intoxicating Impressions 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
A fictional character created by
a fellow composer of Beethoven's,
Hector Berlioz, says of Fidelio:
That music sets your insides on
fire. I feel as if I'd swallowed
fifteen glasses of brandy." The
S.F. Opera invested just such
intoxicating musical fervor and
potency in this year's superb
production of Fidelio. Fidelio is;
the asylums must be full of those
who have tried to categorize it.
For Beethoven, however, the
medium was the message in his
only opera: just as the Chorale
Symphony is founded upon the
"Ode to Joy," so is Fidelio an
operatic ode to political freedom.
More fundamentally, the opera
celebrates the sacredness of
fidelity to a worthy
principle—whether to one's spouse,
as with Leonora, to one's self, as
with Rocco, or in Florestan's case,
to the truth. Beethoven was
willing to allow this theme to
engulf the (to him) niggling
demands of dramatic realism. If
we are willing to do the same,
Fidelio can be an exciting opera.
Ridiculous and Sublime
The music of Fidelio
encompasses the ridiculous and

the sublime. While such a mixture
is hard to justify, it is certainly
not hard to enjoy. The opera is a
sweeping display of the many
aspects of Beethoven's musical
personality. We are constantly
reminded of Beethoven the
symphonist: the rustic geniality of
the 7th is mirrored in the character
of Rocco; the good humor of the
Bth in he Marzelline-Jaquino
affair; the monemuntality of the
Eroiea in the two overtures
included in this performance; and
the ecstasy of the 9th in the finale
to the second act.
Clearly, the music matters most
in Fidelio, and the S.F. Opera
built upon a firm foundation by
engaging an experienced
orchestral conductor—Sixten
Ehrling. He admirably preserved
the sense of compression and
inner propulsion which is so
characteristic of Beethoven's
music. Still, Ehrling was also
flexible enough to make the
frequent shifts from sturm und
drang to high-flown musical
idealism. The orchestra sounded
exemplary—even the
temperamental horn section met
its crucial responsibilities with
minimal difficulty.

Beethoven was either
unknowledgeable or very callous
about the laws of vocal
production; his vocal line
therefore demands not only
power but also faultless
technique. As Leonora, Gwyneth
Jones displayed both in
abundance.
The relatively brief role of
Florestan did not allow James
King to establish fully the nature
of his voice. It has little color and
a well-focused, piercing quality
which marks him as a potential
new recruit for the very thin ranks
of Wagnerian tenors.
Sheila Marks sang a supple and
pleasantly benign Marzelline, and
as her erstwhile lover Evan
Thomas made a sturdy,
unpretentious S.F. debut.
Thankless Role Well-Done
Franz Mazura sang ably the
thankless role of the manic
governor of the prison, but he
could barely compete wit the
cavernous basso voice of
new-comer Peter Lagger. Though
the dramatic aspect of his
performance as the humane,
avuncular jailer was pedestrian,
Lagger's singing was
intimidatingly good.

Paul Hager chose discretion
over valor by not trying to
mitigate the dramatic infelicities
of the plot with imaginative stage
direction. Left, then, with the
usual bag of cliches and
grandstand ploys, Hager could do
nothing but emphasize the
weaknesses, if not the downright
preposterousness, of the opera's
action.
The sets, obviously the product
of a shoestring budget, were at
least no obtrusively bad and were
intelligently lighted. Kid el in is, in
terms of lighting, a dank
opera—set after all in a prison
fortress. I was prepared, therefore,
for stingy lighting, which has been
the trend in recent years. I was
pleasantly surprised, however,
that the soloists were always
nicely spotlighted. Dramatic
realism to the contrary, I like to
see who is singing.
