## Turn On To Local Radio 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
I've been thinking about this
column for some time now; at
best, it seems unnecessary, at
worst an insult to readers. But
thinking back to my freshman
year, even my sophomore year, I
remember that the radio played
no part in my life, except for the
clowns who listened to KFRC day
and night. The Bay Area has some
sensational radio stations,
providing music of all types, 24
hours a day, absolutely free. They
ask only that you listen to their
occasional ads, and the burbling
of their DJ's. But careful station
selection will yield both good
music and few interruptions.
FM stations generally offer the
most music per hour and the least
offensive announcers. The two
best rock stations I've ever heard
anywhere are KSJO, FM 92.3
(San Jose) and KOIT, FM 93.3
(San Francisco). They both play
the latest and best rock, very
hang-loose about ads and blabber.
I prefer to KSJO disc jockeys, but
that is a matter of individual taste.
Classical Stations
Classical music is aired over a
number of stations, some better
than others. KKHI, AM 1550 and
FM 95.7, tends to play one
movement from a given work
instead of the entire piece, and
this disturbs me. KRPM, FM 98.5
is much better, but reception may
be poor. To my mind, the best
station is KDFC, FM 102.1 (San
Francisco), but again, reception is
often poor. They have a local
broadcast tower, however; that
station is called KIBE, AM 1220
(Palo Alto). Unfortunately, it
only broadcasts during daylight
hours; the other stations come in
better at night, though.
The only radio station I have
ever found that broadcasts only
jazz is located in Alameda, garden
city of the East Bay. At FM 92.7
KJAZ plays great jazz, interviews
with jazzmen appearing in the Bay
Area, and keeps listeners informed
of upcoming shows with their
Jazz Notebook. The Notebook is
broadcast every so often, and can
be heard in its entirety by calling
521-9336.
"Easy Listening"
So-called "easy listening"
music, or popular music, is
splashed across the FM dial. KIOI,
FM 101.3, is probably the best of
the lot, although KSAN, FM 94.9
and KBAY, FM 100.3, are also

pretty good. I rarely listen to
them, so there are very likely
others which you will find more
enjoyable.
These stations are all
commercial ones; there are two
stations we can get, though, that
are not. KPFA, FM 94.1, is the
"educational" station in the area,
and presents all kinds of music,
discussions, lectures, news, and
other fine things.
Our own KZSU, FM @9.1, is on
the air from 2 PM to 2 AM; the
craziest hours I ever heard of.
They play lots of rock, broadcast
the news at 10, and then play
classical music. Tune inâ€”you may
hear some of your friends. They
are also very good about requests,
since the DJ's aren't held to any
stuffy rules. Pick up one of their
Program Guides, now being
distributed around campus. And

give them a call if you have
something to say.

Tonight at 8:15, their will be
presented a concert of trumpet
music with organ accompaniment
at the First United Methodist
Church at Hamilton and Webster
in Palo Alto. This is the first in a
series of fine concerts to be
presented at the Church, which
has marvelous acoustics concerts
of this type.
The trumpeter is Edward Tarr,
well-known in Europe as a scholar
of Baroque trumpet works, and
the design of Renaissance and
Baroque Brass instruments.
Accompanying Mr. Tarr will be
George Kent, the organist for the
University of Rhode Island, and a
concert organist in his own right.
This should be an exciting
concert.
