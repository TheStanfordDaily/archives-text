## Woody Allen's Films: Near Insanity 
### 
Putney Swope and Take the
Money and Run are craziness
compounded by near insanity.
Both films contain many
sequences which involve more
audience laughter than any
pictures in recent memory, but
Swope is haphazard and
scatter-gun in its hilarity while
Woody Allen's first directorial
venture benefits from the
presence of a dominant, if not
entirely unified, comic viewpoint
and personality.
Putney Swope is an oddity
among oddities. Made in a few
days by ex-underground film
maker Robert Downey with a cast

comprised by anyone who
happened to show up for the
shooting, the picture begins as
Putney Swope, token black
member of a major Madison
advertising firm, is accidently
elected chairman of the board.
This take-over scene is probably
the funniest in the film, for
Swope then explains to his
bewildered white colleagues, "The
idea, gentlemen, is not to rock the
boat, it's to sink it!" An
immediate cut reveals the
onference room filled with
young blacks adorned with Afros,
dashikis, and ammo belts. The
company is promptly renamed
"Truth and Soul."

Much of your response to the
rest of the film will depend on
your tolerance for the outrageous
(the critic for the New York Daily
News was so offended that she
awarded the picture a zero-rating
and advised patrons to "take
along your wretch bags.") Scenes
take place with two guys sitting in
the john, Hell's angels arriving in
New York by helicopter and
guards passing money bags around
like basketballs.
Even more incredible are the
commercials Truth and Soul
creates for television. Ghetto
blacks eat Ethereal Cereal for
breakfast. A mixed couple singing
the benefits of "Face Off" pimple
remover (in what is really a sly
parody of the entire
TV-commercial-oriented,
arts y-craftsy aspect of
contemporary film making).
Topless stewardesses frolicking in
the zero-gravity cabin of an
imaginary airline.
Confusing Obscenity
After a test screening of the
latter ad, an assistant approaches
Swope to suggest that the new
infant terrible of the advertising
world is perhaps confusing
obscenity. I think this is the
problem with the entire film. For
after half an hour, Downey can no
longer expect us to be convulsed
by his unlimited abandon and
careless advantage-taking of the
taboo-less cinema. However,
Putney Swope does offer what

could be the ultimate
commentary on the rating system
and censorship, for 16 year-olds
are not permitted to see this film
in which a 7 year-old kid says
"fuck you" to a nun.
Woody Allen has stood at the
forefront among contemporary
funneymen due to his work in
recent years in nightclubs, records
and on television. His previous
work in films Will's New
Pussycat, Casino H ovale, What's
*'ew Tiger lily) would tend to
;t some doubt even in the minds
of his admires on his potential in a
media inherently more visual that
verbal. After l ake the Money and
Run, however, all preconceptions
must be tossed aside, for Allen has
created the most personal,
intentionally funny film in
several years (Valley of the Dolls,
The Green Berets and Naked Kiss
come to mind as pictures which
produced much laughter in spite
of themselves).
Writer Directors Have Control
I do not ordinarily align myself
with amateur critics, but in the
realm of comedy, I think there is
something to be said for singling
out individual artists as being
mostly responsible for the comic
effect of a given film. After all,
the funniest and most significant
comedies of all time were made
by performers who also managed
to gain control over the direction
and writing of their vehicles
(Chaplain, Keaton, etc.) And

those talented writer/directors
who were not themselves actors
(Frank Capra, Preston Sturges,
Billy Wilder) usually obtained the
services of stars who could
accurately advance the comic
concepts of the metteur en scene.
Director/writer Woody Allen
grants actor Woody Allen free
reign in Take the Money and Run.
The hit to miss ratio of the gags is
surprisingly high, for only toward
the end does the pandemonium
pace slacken to a trot (a curious
trait of contemporary comedies is
their weak finalesâ€”l still don't
know what happens at the end of
Putney Swope). Allen also
parodies techniques used in
famous films, notably the news
reel re-enactment from Citizen
Kane and the prison camp motifs
of Cool Hand Luke.
What Now, Woody?
Where Allen goes from here is a
major question. In this day and
age, he will be extremely
fortunate if he is able to make
another film as funny as Take the
Money and Run, even though his
comic personality is not totally
realized here, especially in its
physical aspect.
