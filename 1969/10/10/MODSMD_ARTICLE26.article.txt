# Sunday's Music Made it a Good Day

### CRAIG OKINO 
It's small wonder that the
Stanford student has had to go
elsewhere for his rock music. In
the past* two years the Stanford
campus has offered a total of
three rock concerts: Mother Earth
in Tresidder Large Lounge (Winter
'68), and the Youngbloods in
Frost (Autumn '68). People either
had to frequent the Poppycock in
Palo Alto or travel up to the
numerous ballrooms and clubs in
the City and in Berkeley to satisfy
their cravings for live music.
Last Sunday was different.
SCORE held a benefit in Frost,
featuring Old Davis, Sanpaku,
Cold Blood, and It's a Beautiful
Day. Mike Bloomfield and his
Mob cancelled on Friday
(apparently Gravenites' manager,
originally agreeing to play for
free, wanted money for Nick and
for Southern Comfort who also
didn't show, and SCORE couldn't
afford it), and the hopes that
Buddy Guy would be there had
long since vanished. But, in light
of the music to follow, these
disappointments were soon
forgotten.
Good Start
Old Davis, a local band, started
off the day surprisingly well. The
group is a countrified blues unit,
which sounds kind of weird, but
they manage to pull it off nicely.
The lead guitarist is fairly original,
and the vocals (done by the entire
band) are adequate. Although
they play simple chored
progressions now, they should
improve with age.
Sanpaku sounded like a
marriage between Santana and the
Sons of Champlin, but not coming
off as well as either. They are at
the stage now where they will be
great if they come up with good
materia! or will fade into limbo if
they continue doing the same
thing.
Cold Blood is a band more
imitative than derivative, and it
showsâ€”in the tired horn riffs, the
distasteful horn solos, and the
forced Joplin imitations by the
girl singer, Lydia. The key to
recognition for a band today is
originality, something Cold Blood
has yet to learn.
Heller Than "Second-Wave"
When It's A Beautiful Day tore
into their first song, it was
apparent why they were the
featured group. They have
surfaced above the countless other

"second wave" San Francisco
bands, and although they are
markedly Airplane-influenced,
they use this influence to create
something new rather than let the
influence use them. There is no
virtuoso among them, but
together they make beautiful
music.
After a lyrically-altered "White
Bird," Patti Santos, the group's
female singer, was featured on a
Joplinese "Lonely Woman." One
of the better songs of the set,
"Don and Dewey," followed. An
instrumental, it contained both
fine electric LaFlamme violin
solos and terrible harmonica solos
by the bass player, Mike. They
also did Fred Neil's "Dolphin
Song" and a polka with Wagenet,
the adequate lead guitarist, on
steel guitar, before doing their
standards, "Bombay" and
"Wasted Union Blues." "Hot
Summer Day" was the fitting
encore.
Throughout their set the group
established a setting for
LaFlamme's violin, which was
never corny or schmaltzy as one
would expect from an electric
violin in a rock group, and his
vocals were delivered in a clear
and mellow baritone. The other
solos left something to be desired,
but no one noticed; the people
were too busy enjoying
themselves.
It was a beautiful day.
