Is it a golden toe or a lead foot? That is the question facing the
Stanford football team in general and one junior placekicker in
particular. And it's a problem that may have a bearing on the Indian
performance in Los Angeles tomorrow night.
Steve Horowitz stands 6-2 and weighs 217 pounds. He is an
outstanding athlete, an extremely smart football player, and a warm,
friendly person. Yet on occasion this year and last, he has not been
the most popular guy on campus. His right foot has betrayed him at
times, and the result was a lot of criticism and jokes. All of a sudden,
someone who had dropped his tray in a dining hall had "pulled a
Horowitz."
It all started at the beginning of last season when Stanford's
placekicker Bill Shoemaker was wiped out by a San Jose State
lineman. The team was without a kicker, and obviously in trouble.
The call went out. Coach Ralston asked who on the squad had ever
tried his luck from the tee. A sophomore line-backer who had kicked
occasional extra points in high school raised his hand.
Steve Horowitz was suddenly the official foot man. He looked
forward to the challenge, and was glad to get an opportunity to play.
He soon realized however, that being the first string kicker meant that
he was demoted to the bottom of the line backing crew. After all, if
he got hurt, there would be no one at all.
So he set about his business, and learned how to kick. His first
outing against Oregon was fairly routine, as he converted after four
TD's. The next game was Air Force, and he made good on a 29-yard
goal and a 33-yard extra point (after two penalties).
Things were looking good, and Steve was starting to enjoy the role
of kicker. Then came USC. It was the biggest game for Stanford in a
number of years, and 81,000 people crowded the stadium. Tribe
drives stalled continually near the Trojan 20-yard line—field goal
range. Horowitz was called on three times in the first quarter, and
each time missed, wide to the right. He finally made one later in the
game, but the damage was done—the game was lost, the undefeated
season and the Rose Bowl were gone, and Steve's confidence was
ruined.
He went on to miss five more field goals that year, and mentally he
was ready to give it up. But he came back and started strong. He has
connected on 18 straight extra points. The field goal department is
still trouble.
He missed one against Oregon, and then last week got a huge rush
which may have thrown him off as he missed a 14-yarder against
Purdue. (The Purdue kicker missed from the same spot earlier in the
game.)
The problem now is confidence and overcoming the mental block.
The talent is there—the 18 straight PAT's prove that. Tomorrow night
is USC, and memories haunt Horowitz more than any other player. He
says he is ready, and so does Coach Ralston. Questioned if he would
go for a field goal if the situation came up against SC, Ralston
emphatically replied yes. "Steve's got a score to settle," he said, "and
he's up for the Trojans."
The first opportunity will probably determine the rest of the game
for Steve Horowitz. Maybe the rest of the season. The kicking career
starts all over again tomorrow night.
