## Lombardi Digs Jim 
### RICK PERAL 
When the name Jim Plunkett is mentioned
Vince Lombardi's eyes assume that wishful,
faraway, glassy state. Yes, Vince Lombardi wants
Jim Plunkett. "We have had outstanding reports
on Plunkett," glowed Lombardi enthusiastically,
"as it stands now, we would draft Jim over any
other collegian in the country."
Coach of the National Football League
Washington Redskins, Vince Lombardi was on
campus with his team last Friday and Saturday
mornings to conduct brief workouts in preparation
for Sunday's encounter in Kezar with the 49'ers.
Lombardi, unquestionably the finest coach in
the pro ranks, earned his reputation as a tactical
genius and a peerless leader of men when coach of
the legendary Green Bay Packers.
Inheriting the miserable, cellar-dwelling Packers
in the late fifties, he whipped them into
championship contenders in three short years. The
Packers, under the leadership of Lombardi, then
established a seven-year dynasty in the N.F.L.,
falling only when Lombardi retired as coach.
But now Lombardi has renewed his coaching
career with the Redskins, inheriting another
miserable team, and will probably be expected to
produce duplicate miracles.
Lombardi is a small man, soft spoken, and loves
kids. Contrary to popular opinion, he does not yell
or scream at his players, nor does he kick or bite
them.

From innumerable newspaper and magazine
articles, most readers conclude that Lombardi is
mean, tough, and short-tempered; that his players
do not like him, but instead harbor mixed feelings
of respect and hate; and that he often works
himself into such a frenzy that he physically
attacks his players.
I expected to see a yelling, screaming ogre with
a whip in one hand and a chain in the other
leading the Redskins through their drills.
Needless to say, my image was shattered.
Lombardi speaks in quiet tones to his players and
even absorbs some degree of back-talk.
I approached Lombardi on this subject. "No, I
am not the tyrant or slavemaster the papers make
me to be," he stated, "it is all a gross exaggeration.
The whole thing has been blown completely out of
proportion."
Sonny Jurgensen, star quarterback on the Skins,
who, incidentally, is aging fast thereby creating a
need for a solid young back-up signal-caller of
Plunkett's stature, agreed with his coach. "Vince is
not a tyrant. He is a great coach, and we are
fortunate to have him."
Asked how he would discipline collegiate
players with long hair, sideburns, mustaches, or
beards, if he himself were a college coach,
Lombardi answered, "I would set no regulations of
that type. I believe hair length and facial hair are
matters entirely up to the individual player."

Washington Redskins, Vince Lombardi was on
campus with his team last Friday and Saturday
mornings to conduct brief workouts in preparation
for Sunday's encounter in Kezar with the 49'ers.
Lombardi, unquestionably the finest coach in
the pro ranks, earned his reputation as a tactical
genius and a peerless leader of men when coach of
the legendary Green Bay Packers.
Inheriting the miserable, cellar-dwelling Packers
in the late fifties, he whipped them into
championship contenders in three short years. The
Packers, under the leadership of Lombardi, then
established a seven-year dynasty in the N.F.L.,
falling only when Lombardi retired as coach.
But now Lombardi has renewed his coaching
career with the Redskins, inheriting another
miserable team, and will probably be expected to
produce duplicate miracles.
Lombardi is a small man, soft spoken, and loves
kids. Contrary to popular opinion, he does not yell
or scream at his players, nor does he kick or bite
them.

From innumerable newspaper and magazine
articles, most readers conclude that Lombardi is
mean, tough, and short-tempered; that his players
do not like him, but instead harbor mixed feelings
of respect and hate; and that he often works
himself into such a frenzy that he physically
attacks his players.
I expected to see a yelling, screaming ogre with
a whip in one hand and a chain in the other
leading the Redskins through their drills.
Needless to say, my image was shattered.
Lombardi speaks in quiet tones to his players and
even absorbs some degree of back-talk.
I approached Lombardi on this subject. "No, I
am not the tyrant or slavemaster the papers make
me to be," he stated, "it is all a gross exaggeration.
The whole thing has been blown completely out of
proportion."
Sonny Jurgensen, star quarterback on the Skins,
who, incidentally, is aging fast thereby creating a
need for a solid young back-up signal-caller of
Plunkett's stature, agreed with his coach. "Vince is
not a tyrant. He is a great coach, and we are
fortunate to have him."
Asked how he would discipline collegiate
players with long hair, sideburns, mustaches, or
beards, if he himself were a college coach,
Lombardi answered, "I would set no regulations of
that type. I believe hair length and facial hair are
matters entirely up to the individual player."
When the name Jim Plunkett is mentioned
Vince Lombardi's eyes assume that wishful,
faraway, glassy state. Yes, Vince Lombardi wants
Jim Plunkett. "We have had outstanding reports
on Plunkett," glowed Lombardi enthusiastically,
"as it stands now, we would draft Jim over any
other collegian in the country."
