CHICAGO (AP)—Gov. Ricahrd
B. Ogilvie ordered 2,000 members
of the National Guard to active
duty in Chicago Thursday after
street battles Wednesday night
between police and some 300
young radicals.
The governor said he talked
with Mayor Richard J.Daley about
the plans of the radicals Tuesday
and asked Brig. Gen. Richard T.
Dunn, who has been in Chicago
for two days, to observe the
situation.
Daley praised police for their
restraint during Wednesday's
hit-and-run skit— K-hps with the
young persons, who had stormed
out of Lincoln Park after a
bonfire and rally.
One SDS group, the
Weatherman, sponsored the rally
for 400 persons which ended in
two hours of street skirmishes
between police and club-carrying,
helmeted youths. 65 persons were
arrested and 34, including 21
policemen, were injured.
Further SDS demonstrations
are planned for Chicago on
Saturday.

Viet Proposal
WASHINGTON (AP)-Sen.
George S. McGovern introduced a
resolution yesterday urging total
U.S. withdrawal from South
Vietnam as swiftly as possible.

to insure the safety of U.S. forces,
prisoner of war release and
arrangements for asylum for
South Vietnamese who want to
leave with the American troops.
Senators Abraham Ribicoff,
Alan Cranston, Stephen M.
Young, Frank Church and Harold
Hughes joined in sponsoring the
