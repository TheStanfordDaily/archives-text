# Opener Next Week
## Frosh Gridders Train 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
The countdown now stands at
zero minus seven days before the
1969 edition of the Stanford
Freshman football team takes the
field against the Trojans of USC in
L.A.
Following a double-day in pads
last Saturday, Coach Bill
Moultrie's Papooses have spent
the entire week running through
90 minute drills, sharpening their
tomahawks in preparation for the
opener next Friday afternoon.
"We're right where we'd like to
be at this time," said Coach
Moultrie yesterday. "I'm really
pleased with the kids' enthusiasm,
performance and progress. Of

course, no coach is ever 100
percent happy with the
backfield's timing or with the way
the line's getting off until it's
perfect, and we've got a ways to
go yet."
No official scouting reports
have come up from Southern
California, but Coach Moultrie
stated that "our emphasis will be
on total preparedness窶馬ot just to
cope with whatever USC throws
at us, but to give them a thing or
two to fear from us also."
When asked about the
effectiveness of USC's overall
freshman football program which
consists of pitting the incoming
freshmen against the varsity
regulars right from the opening
whistle, Coach Moultrie had this
to say. "There's no doubt that
USC has turned out some
outstanding athletes through their
program, but we feel that our kids
are here at Stanford primarily for
an education, and our first
objective is to give them
something that will be of value
when their playing days are over."
"Our freshman program is
geared not necessarily toward
winning all four of our games but

more toward providing kids an
opportunity to play college ball,
to increase their knowledge and
enjoyment of the game, and to
develop some prospects who
might be able to help the varsity
in a year or two."
The dual between the
quarterback candidates is
developing just as expected, but
Coach Moultrie laughed and said
that "it's the kind of problem that
coaches love to have." Mike
Boryla, Steve Murray and Jim
Wise have been effective moving
the first offensive unit while Jesse
Freitas has been hobbled by a
gimpy shoulder and Pat Moore has
been trying to work the stiffness
out of a bum ankle.
Eric Cross and Charles McCloud
have demonstrated their
elusiveness running from the
tailback post, and Barr Curry and
Reggie Sanderson have been
nothing short of crunching
coming out of the backfield as
lead blockers and on the short
yardage dive series.
Following the USC game, the
Papooses return to Stanford
Stadium for a confrontation with
the Bru Babes of UCLA on
October 25.

to increase their knowledge and
enjoyment of the game, and to
develop some prospects who
might be able to help the varsity
in a year or two."
The dual between the
quarterback candidates is
developing just as expected, but
Coach Moultrie laughed and said
that "it's the kind of problem that
coaches love to have." Mike
Boryla, Steve Murray and Jim
Wise have been effective moving
the first offensive unit while Jesse
Freitas has been hobbled by a
gimpy shoulder and Pat Moore has
been trying to work the stiffness
out of a bum ankle.
Eric Cross and Charles McCloud
have demonstrated their
elusiveness running from the
tailback post, and Barr Curry and
Reggie Sanderson have been
nothing short of crunching
coming out of the backfield as
lead blockers and on the short
yardage dive series.
Following the USC game, the
Papooses return to Stanford
Stadium for a confrontation with
the Bru Babes of UCLA on
October 25.

The countdown now stands at
zero minus seven days before the
1969 edition of the Stanford
Freshman football team takes the
field against the Trojans of USC in
L.A.
Following a double-day in pads
last Saturday, Coach Bill
Moultrie's Papooses have spent
the entire week running through
90 minute drills, sharpening their
tomahawks in preparation for the
opener next Friday afternoon.
"We're right where we'd like to
be at this time," said Coach
Moultrie yesterday. "I'm really
pleased with the kids' enthusiasm,
performance and progress. Of

course, no coach is ever 100
percent happy with the
backfield's timing or with the way
the line's getting off until it's
perfect, and we've got a ways to
go yet."
No official scouting reports
have come up from Southern
California, but Coach Moultrie
stated that "our emphasis will be
on total preparedness窶馬ot just to
cope with whatever USC throws
at us, but to give them a thing or
two to fear from us also."
When asked about the
effectiveness of USC's overall
freshman football program which
consists of pitting the incoming
freshmen against the varsity
regulars right from the opening
whistle, Coach Moultrie had this
to say. "There's no doubt that
USC has turned out some
outstanding athletes through their
program, but we feel that our kids
are here at Stanford primarily for
an education, and our first
objective is to give them
something that will be of value
when their playing days are over."
"Our freshman program is
geared not necessarily toward
winning all four of our games but

more toward providing kids an
opportunity to play college ball,
to increase their knowledge and
enjoyment of the game, and to
develop some prospects who
might be able to help the varsity
in a year or two."
