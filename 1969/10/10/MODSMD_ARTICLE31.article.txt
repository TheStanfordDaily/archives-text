# American Victory
## Sailing Cup Won 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
A Stanford sailor has helped
bring a renowned international
yachting trophy back to the U.S.
Skip Allan, captain of the
Stanford sailing team that won
the National championship in
1967, was helmsman and watch
captain on the 43 foot sloop Red
Rooster, the victorious craft in
last August's Fastnet Race.
The triumph brought the
Admirals Cup—the sea-going
version of tennis' Davis Cup—back
to America from England. Allan is
presently acting as coach and
advisor for the Stanford Sailing
Association (SSA).
The Fastnet Race is 670 miles
long and is considered the
toughest long distance ocean race
in the world. The Red Rooster
defeated 189 boats in the rugged
test. The brand new sloop also
won two other ocean races in the
English Channel to accrue enough
points to defeat teams from
Australia, Germany, England and
Italy and bring home tho Admirals
Cup.

But the victories were nothing
new to Allan. While a student at
Stanford he sailed in Cal 40
Holiday Too to first overall in the
1967 Honolulu Race and in the
Congressional Cup of 1968.
The SSA, meanwhile, is busy
making plans for the upcoming
year. Plans for use of the
Association's 30 foot Shields class
sloops were discussed at an
organizational meeting on
Monday night.
Also, an active and experienced
sailing varsity is preparing for the
1969-70 season and competition
in both the Shields and in smaller
craft. Competition is scheduled
for S.F. Bay and elsewhery on the
west coast. Stanford sailors,
winners of the National
Championship Kennedy Cup in
1967 and 1969, are hoping for a
repeat this year.
