# USC Awaits Indian Invasion
## 
### FRED MANN 
The football season begins and
maybe ends for Stanford
tomorrow night. Between 80,000
and 90,000 people will make their
way into the Los Angeles
Coliseum to see their favorite USC
Trojans clobber the upstart
Indians, just like they always do.
But this time, Southern Cal is
scared. They know their 13-season
win string may very definitely go
out the window when John
Ralston and company hit town.
The Tribe ain't no pushover
anymore.
Banners all over Bovard Field,
the Trojan's practice site,
proclaim, "Get To Plunkett," and
SC coach John McKay has been

overly lavish in his praise of the
enemy. LA is buzzing. People
realize that Stanford is for real,
and that the winner of this game
is in the driver's seat in the Pac-8
race for the rest of the year.
The odds-makers have installed
the Trojans as a 9'/a point favorite,
but others are hedging a bit.
Associated Press picked the Tribe
in a one touchdown upset, and
The Daily must go along with AP.
For many of the Indians, the SC
game is always more than just a
regular contest. For those like Jim
Cross, Randy Vataha, Bubba
Brown, Howie Williams, Tom
Sones, Rich Keller and others, it is
a home coming. Parents and
friends will be out to see the

battle. (Also the Los Angeles
Times reports that the city is
expecting the largest war party in
a decade heading south from the
Bay Area for the game.)
For Coach Ralston, the game is
another attempt to thwart
frustration. He has never beaten
USC, and never won in LA at all.
Southern Cal is a different team
this year. The emphasis was
switched back to the pre-O.J.
days, and passes fill the air. One
of the few black quarterbacks
around, sophomore Jimmy Jones
does a fine job flinging them too.
He has thrown for six TD's in
three games, and the pre-season
question of too much pressure on
a young signal caller has obviously
been answered.
But the running game that
McKay loves is still around as
well. Clarence Davis, Pacific-8
Back of the Week, is a JC transfer
who broke all of O.J.'s records in

junior college. He gained 181
yards last week against Oregon
State, and leads all Trojan scorers
with three touchdowns.
The defense, with nine of 11
starters back this season is
typically SC big and strong, but
the pass secondary may be
suspect. 11l their first game of the
year against Nebraska, the deep
men committed six pass
interference penalties. Jim
Plunkett will take utmost
advantage of any weakness.
The game plan for both sides is
simple—stop the other side from
scoring as much as possible. Both
squads are explosive and will be
running points up the scoreboard
all night. The key lies in the
defense, and Stanford's D will be
stronger this week than last. The
defensive set should be able to
handle the roll-out patterns of
Jones, and a top effort by the
down six can contain SC running.

The Indian offensive line which
was perfect against Purdue will get
a real challenge from A 1 Cowlings,
Jim Gunn, Charlie Weaver, and
Tody Smith (Bubba's little
brother). If Plunkett keeps getting
N od protection, he may just
rlirow a couple of quickies past
the Trojan defense and send all
the USC alumni home cursing and
screaming foul—not an unusual
scene after an SC loss.
So the stage is set. The top
offense in the league comes to
town to meet the top defense in
the league for all the marbles
(don't tell UCLA). The Trojan
fans may be worth at least a
touchdown, but there are also a
lot of Stanford partisans in the
LA area. The heartbreak defeat of
last year is still in the minds of
many Indians, and Little Big
Game this time around may end
differently.
