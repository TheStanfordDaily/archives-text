# Frosh Stars Will Help Tennis Team
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Not only will Stanford's
returning tennis stars be hardput
to improve upon their surprising
showing in NCAA play last year,
but they will also be under the
constant pressure of retaining
their previous positions against
the awesome onslaught of ten
highly reputed freshmen
challengers and two transfer
students. Since the freshmen will
be able to participate in Pac-8
conference play for the first time
ever, it is indeed fortunate that
Coach Dick Gould has again
grabbed the top Junior racket
stars from the high school and
prep ranks.
Heading the challenge list of
entering freshmen is Roscoe
Tanner of Lookout Mountain,
Tennessee. Tanner was a member
of the Junior Davis Cup team this
summer and was named the
outstanding palyer of the training
camp. While in Northern
California, he won the California

State Championships and the
United States National Junior
Hardcourt Championships.
He then won the Big Western
Championships in Springfield,
Ohio. At the National Junior's
Championships at Kalamazoo, he
reached the semi-finals before
losing to Eric van Dillen, 19-17,
6-4. At the U.S. Amateur Men's in
Longwood, he lost to two
time-number one singles star from
UCLA, Roy Barth, 10-12, 13-11,
6-4.
Last but not least, at Forest
Hills he captured the first set from
touring pro Marty Reissen, 6-1.
Tanner, who may be the top
ranked Junior in the U.S., will
seriously challenge for Stanford's
top varsity slot.
Rick Fisher from Palo Alto also
hold a good chance of gaining a
varsity playing position this
season. Rick will undoubtedly be
ranked nationally this year and
holds several victories over USC's
top freshmen, Mike Machette. He
also forced Brubabe star Haroom
Rahim into three sets at last
spring's Ojai Tournament. Gery
Croslimond from Daytona Beach,
Florida, also hopes to crack the
varsity six with his challenge. His
credentials are formidable from
the U.S. Junior Circuit and from
his record in the Junior Davis Cup
training camp.
Adding depth at the freshman
level will be Wes Hampton from
San Marino, California; Jim
Healey from Tacoma; Jon Rompf
of Des Moines; Gillette Edmunds
from Albuquerque; Jeremy Levine
of San Francisco; Dave Orlean
from Shaker Hts., Ohio; and Bob
Vickery from Prarie View, Kansas.
Two transfer students with a
chance to make the team are A 1
Margot from Bakersfield JC and
Greg Parker from Foothill College
in Los Altos.
Coach Gould expects at least
two freshmen to appear in next
spring's varsity line-up. Combine
this wealth of newly arrived tennis
talent with the consistency and
depth of the returning lettermen,
they spell double trouble for all
future Indian court opponents.
