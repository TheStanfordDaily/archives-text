# Soccer Team Evens Record
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team
opened the 1969 season with
Chico State College at home last
Saturday, but wish they hadn't.
Chico State, riding a three game
win streak which included their
winning a Southern California
tournament outshot the Indians
40 to 5, and outscored them, 2-0.
With help of a stellar job of
goal tending by sophomore
"Woody" Hagge (nicknamed the
Green Giant) by the Chico team,
the two teams battled to a
scoreless first half during which the
play was in Stanford's half of the
field most of the time. Carter, the
Chico goalie handled the ball only
twice during the first 44 minutes
of the game.
The Tribe defense, anchored by
the goalkeeper, played well,
however they could not control
the center of the field and because
of this they could not start a
sustained attack.
Things were different
Wednesday.
Exhibiting a complete reversal
of form the soccer team downed
the University of Pacific, 6-1.
Putting together a potent offense
with strong defense anchored
again by goalie Hagge, the Indians
scored in every period to
completely dominate a fighting
but much slower U.O.P.
The University of Pacific had
beaten St. Mary's last Saturday
and figured to repeat last year's
win over the Indians. They started
out fast but Stanford soon took
charge and the outcome from the
very start was never in doubt.
Coaches Priddle and Toplak were
very pleased by the way the team
came back from their first defeat.
The Braves won their game,
beating U.O.P. 1-0.
Tomorrow Stanford hosts
Menlo College in a varsity and
Brave match starting at 1:30 p.m.
The 1969 Frosh team takes the
field at 3:00 p.m. Their
opponents will be Balboa High
School from San Francisco.
