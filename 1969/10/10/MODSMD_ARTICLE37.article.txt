# Application Due For Committees
## 
### MILLIE YOST 
The deadline for applications
for the three student positions on
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) is noon today.
Applications for the two places on
the University Committee on
Land and Building Development
are also due at the same time in
the ASSU office.
The new Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, created as
a result of an ShS
recommendation, will replace
three present administrative
committees: the Committee on
General Studies, the Committee
on Undergraduate Education, and
the Registrar's Advisory
Committee. The three will be
abolished as soon as members of
the new committee are selected.
The Committee on Land and
Building Development advises the
President on all questions
concerning the use, acquisition,
and disposal of real property by
the University.
In addition to the responsibility
of formulating general policy and
recommendations for specific
projects, the committee is
responsible for informing
members of the Stanford
community about various land
and building development
problems and plans.
Pat Shea, member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, said one of
the first duties of CUS will be to
interpret the new university area
requirements for an
undergraduate degree.
"The Committee will decide
what courses will fulfill each
category, including the status of
student-initiated programs such as
SWOPSI," Shea said.
Joyce Kobayashi, another
member of the Council ol
Presidents, will also consider
improvements in present general
studies courses, other general
introductory courses, and possible
expansion of independent study
programs.
The committee's
responsibilities and powers,

delegated by the Academic
Senate, will encompass more than
those of the present committees it
replaces.
In accordance with a resolution
adopted by the Senate on August
7, the committee is responsible
for working with departments, in
cooperation with the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, to develop
new course offering primarily
intended for non-specialists. Joyce
mentioned such courses might
include science courses for
non-science majors.
Other areas CUS will be
concerned with are university
requirements for the bachelor's
degree, establishment of general
policies affecting undergraduate
major programs, advising, policies
affecting academic credit and
related record-keeping and
student petitions involving the
granting or withholding of credit.
