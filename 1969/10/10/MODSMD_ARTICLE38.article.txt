# Variety Offered In Seminar Subjects
## 
### 
Freshmen may now apply for
U e 21 Freshman Seminars that
wil! be offered in winter and
spring quarters this year.
Applications are available at the
Freshman Seminar Office, Room
241 C, Outer Quad, and must be
returned to that office by October
31.
According to Professor William
A. Clebsch (Religion and
Humanities), Director of
Freshman Seminars, the
winter-spring offerings "run the
gamut of academic concerns, from
opera to space exploration. Most
are taught by senior faculty
members, and the rest by other
teachers of proved excellence. The
freshmen who are admitted to
them will participate in some of
the finest education that Stanford
can offer to undergraduates."

Seminars in the winter-spring
series will normally consist of
eight students each, chosen so as
to achieve some coeducational
balance from among those who
state preferences for particular
seminars. A small number of the
seminars will admit 12 students,
on an experimental basis.
In the autumn-winter series,
more than 750 students applied
for the 376 places that were open.
By the end of this academic year,
there will have been 66 Freshman
Seminars offered by faculty
members from approximately 35
departments and schools. The
Program is in its fifth year, and
the number of student applicants
has increased steadily, as have the
number of seminars offered.
