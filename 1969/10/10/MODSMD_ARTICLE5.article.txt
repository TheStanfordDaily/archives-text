# Big Train Stoppage At Steel Strike
## 
### GREG WHITE 
The strike of the Pittsburgh-Des
Moines Steel plant was plagued
yesterday by an arrest, a train
delay, and the injuring of a strike
captain by a car breaking picket
lines.
About 110 workers are out on
strike at the Santa Clara site of
the factory. Those picketing were
workers and SDSers, including
Stanford students.
Last night striker's wives
gathered at the plant to join the
protest. There is an unconfirmed
report of an arrest made at that
rally. The strike will resume
today.
The train delay came early in
the day. A Southern Pacific
freight train, almost a mile long,
was travelling on tracks that
crossed the road serving the plant
entrance. Pickets milling around
in front of the entrance did not
notice the train coming at first.
When the train was noticed,
pickets ran own the tracks waving
their arms and warning the main
group of demonstrators to get out
of the way. This caught the
attention of the train engineer,
who braked the train to a stop,
but not until it had overshot the
main group of pickets by about
150 yards. Nobody was hit.
H. Bruce Franklin, Professor of
English, was on the scene. He says
that some of the Santa Clara
police, trying to get
demonstrators on just one side of
the tracks, turned back some
pickets, making them cross in he
path of the train.
Trainmaster Delay
The train was delayed for forty
minutes by order of the San Jose
trainmaster, and a search was
made for any demonstrators lying
under the train. Southern Pacific
spokesmen told the Daily that
both the train and engineer and
the trainmaster were following
standard company policy and
federal regulations in making the
search.
No picket was found blocking
the train either by lying under it
or standing in its way.
However, the delay caused a
minor traffic tie-up of some 50
cars. Cars were routed to an
overpass a mile away. The
entrance to Agnews State Hospital
was blocked.
Later in the day, according to
Franklin and Leonard Siegel, a
SDS member also present, Santa
Clara officer J. Fries told drivers
of cars attempting to breech the
picket line to continue through
without stopping. Previously,
strikebreakers' cars stopped for a
short while before proceeding
through, and no car had ever been
denied entrance. Earlier, however,
a company truck had been held

up while attempting to leave the
plant. Police had to clear a way
for it.
No Serious Injury
One such car ran into strike
captain Burn Black, who was not
seriously hurt. However, another
picketer, George Eckert, started
hitting the trunk of the same car
with his picket. He was arrested
by Santa Clara police and charged
with malicious mischief. Eckert,
22, is a striking employee.
There were twenty-one Santa
Clara police at the strike scent
during the day. Contrary to
reports in the Palo Alio Times, no
Stanford or Palo Alto police were
present. A Santa Clara sergeant
reported no violence outside of a
"little shoving and pushing around
the railroad tracks." The Santa
Clara police also have "no plans
for Friday, but we will try to be
ready if they come back." The
police know of no student plans
for disruption.
According to Franklin and
Siegel, there were "six or eight"
Stanford students picketing. A
few faculty wives were also
present. Santa Clara police took
pictures of some demonstrators.
According to Santa Clara
detective Sarget Mendez, "We
knew people there personally
from past demonstrations."
Mendez declined to comment
which people or what
demonstrations he was referring
to. Another police spokesmen said
he believed some Berkeley
students were also present.
Scab Labor Hired
Tempers have been growing
during the legal strike as the
company has hired scab labor to
replace the striking steel workers.
Franklin thinks that
Pittsburgh-Des Moines is "clearly
trying to smash the union." Union
contracts are now settled on a
plant basis, rather than the
contracts for all workers at all
P'a nts being negotiated
simultaneously. Thus, a strike at
just one plant doesn't effectively
hurt the company. So the strike
drags on.
The danger now, according to
Siegel, is that some of the scab
labor are being trained in skills
held by the strikers. So far, the
strikebreakers have had little work
that needed training as the Santa
Clara plant had built up a
stockpile of processed steel.
Siegel says that he and other
Stanford SDSers support the
workers because "we are trying to
show them we are all in the same
boat." Nothing like strike orders
have been issued from the divided
national SDS, although Stanford
SDS does support some of the
goals of the Student Labor Action
Project (SLAP).

during the day. Contrary to
reports in the Palo Alio Times, no
Stanford or Palo Alto police were
present. A Santa Clara sergeant
reported no violence outside of a
"little shoving and pushing around
the railroad tracks." The Santa
Clara police also have "no plans
for Friday, but we will try to be
ready if they come back." The
police know of no student plans
for disruption.
According to Franklin and
Siegel, there were "six or eight"
Stanford students picketing. A
few faculty wives were also
present. Santa Clara police took
pictures of some demonstrators.
According to Santa Clara
detective Sarget Mendez, "We
knew people there personally
from past demonstrations."
Mendez declined to comment
which people or what
demonstrations he was referring
to. Another police spokesmen said
he believed some Berkeley
students were also present.
Scab Labor Hired
Tempers have been growing
during the legal strike as the
company has hired scab labor to
replace the striking steel workers.
Franklin thinks that
Pittsburgh-Des Moines is "clearly
trying to smash the union." Union
contracts are now settled on a
plant basis, rather than the
contracts for all workers at all
P'a nts being negotiated
simultaneously. Thus, a strike at
just one plant doesn't effectively
hurt the company. So the strike
drags on.
The danger now, according to
Siegel, is that some of the scab
labor are being trained in skills
held by the strikers. So far, the
strikebreakers have had little work
that needed training as the Santa
Clara plant had built up a
stockpile of processed steel.
Siegel says that he and other
Stanford SDSers support the
workers because "we are trying to
show them we are all in the same
boat." Nothing like strike orders
have been issued from the divided
national SDS, although Stanford
SDS does support some of the
goals of the Student Labor Action
Project (SLAP).
The strike of the Pittsburgh-Des
Moines Steel plant was plagued
yesterday by an arrest, a train
delay, and the injuring of a strike
captain by a car breaking picket
lines.
About 110 workers are out on
strike at the Santa Clara site of
the factory. Those picketing were
workers and SDSers, including
Stanford students.
Last night striker's wives
gathered at the plant to join the
protest. There is an unconfirmed
report of an arrest made at that
rally. The strike will resume
today.
The train delay came early in
the day. A Southern Pacific
freight train, almost a mile long,
was travelling on tracks that
crossed the road serving the plant
entrance. Pickets milling around
in front of the entrance did not
notice the train coming at first.
When the train was noticed,
pickets ran own the tracks waving
their arms and warning the main
group of demonstrators to get out
of the way. This caught the
attention of the train engineer,
who braked the train to a stop,
but not until it had overshot the
main group of pickets by about
150 yards. Nobody was hit.
H. Bruce Franklin, Professor of
English, was on the scene. He says
that some of the Santa Clara
police, trying to get
demonstrators on just one side of
the tracks, turned back some
pickets, making them cross in he
path of the train.
Trainmaster Delay
The train was delayed for forty
minutes by order of the San Jose
trainmaster, and a search was
made for any demonstrators lying
under the train. Southern Pacific
spokesmen told the Daily that
both the train and engineer and
the trainmaster were following
standard company policy and
federal regulations in making the
search.
No picket was found blocking
the train either by lying under it
or standing in its way.
However, the delay caused a
minor traffic tie-up of some 50
cars. Cars were routed to an
overpass a mile away. The
entrance to Agnews State Hospital
was blocked.
Later in the day, according to
Franklin and Leonard Siegel, a
SDS member also present, Santa
Clara officer J. Fries told drivers
of cars attempting to breech the
picket line to continue through
without stopping. Previously,
strikebreakers' cars stopped for a
short while before proceeding
through, and no car had ever been
denied entrance. Earlier, however,
a company truck had been held

up while attempting to leave the
plant. Police had to clear a way
for it.
No Serious Injury
One such car ran into strike
captain Burn Black, who was not
seriously hurt. However, another
picketer, George Eckert, started
hitting the trunk of the same car
with his picket. He was arrested
by Santa Clara police and charged
with malicious mischief. Eckert,
22, is a striking employee.

but not until it had overshot the
main group of pickets by about
150 yards. Nobody was hit.
H. Bruce Franklin, Professor of
English, was on the scene. He says
that some of the Santa Clara
police, trying to get
demonstrators on just one side of
the tracks, turned back some
pickets, making them cross in he
path of the train.
Trainmaster Delay
The train was delayed for forty
minutes by order of the San Jose
trainmaster, and a search was
made for any demonstrators lying
under the train. Southern Pacific
spokesmen told the Daily that
both the train and engineer and
the trainmaster were following
standard company policy and
federal regulations in making the
search.
No picket was found blocking
the train either by lying under it
or standing in its way.
However, the delay caused a
minor traffic tie-up of some 50
cars. Cars were routed to an
overpass a mile away. The
entrance to Agnews State Hospital
was blocked.
Later in the day, according to
Franklin and Leonard Siegel, a
SDS member also present, Santa
Clara officer J. Fries told drivers
of cars attempting to breech the
picket line to continue through
without stopping. Previously,
strikebreakers' cars stopped for a
short while before proceeding
through, and no car had ever been
denied entrance. Earlier, however,
a company truck had been held

up while attempting to leave the
plant. Police had to clear a way
for it.
No Serious Injury
One such car ran into strike
captain Burn Black, who was not
seriously hurt. However, another
picketer, George Eckert, started
hitting the trunk of the same car
with his picket. He was arrested
by Santa Clara police and charged
with malicious mischief. Eckert,
22, is a striking employee.
There were twenty-one Santa
Clara police at the strike scent
during the day. Contrary to
reports in the Palo Alio Times, no
Stanford or Palo Alto police were
present. A Santa Clara sergeant
reported no violence outside of a
"little shoving and pushing around
the railroad tracks." The Santa
Clara police also have "no plans
for Friday, but we will try to be
ready if they come back." The
police know of no student plans
for disruption.
According to Franklin and
Siegel, there were "six or eight"
Stanford students picketing. A
few faculty wives were also
present. Santa Clara police took
pictures of some demonstrators.
According to Santa Clara
detective Sarget Mendez, "We
knew people there personally
from past demonstrations."
Mendez declined to comment
which people or what
demonstrations he was referring
to. Another police spokesmen said
he believed some Berkeley
students were also present.
Scab Labor Hired
Tempers have been growing
during the legal strike as the
company has hired scab labor to
replace the striking steel workers.
Franklin thinks that
Pittsburgh-Des Moines is "clearly
trying to smash the union." Union
contracts are now settled on a
plant basis, rather than the
contracts for all workers at all
P'a nts being negotiated
simultaneously. Thus, a strike at
just one plant doesn't effectively
hurt the company. So the strike
drags on.
The danger now, according to
Siegel, is that some of the scab
labor are being trained in skills
held by the strikers. So far, the
strikebreakers have had little work
that needed training as the Santa
Clara plant had built up a
stockpile of processed steel.
Siegel says that he and other
Stanford SDSers support the
workers because "we are trying to
show them we are all in the same
boat." Nothing like strike orders
have been issued from the divided
national SDS, although Stanford
SDS does support some of the
goals of the Student Labor Action
Project (SLAP).
The strike of the Pittsburgh-Des
Moines Steel plant was plagued
yesterday by an arrest, a train
delay, and the injuring of a strike
captain by a car breaking picket
lines.
About 110 workers are out on
strike at the Santa Clara site of
the factory. Those picketing were
workers and SDSers, including
Stanford students.
Last night striker's wives
gathered at the plant to join the
protest. There is an unconfirmed
report of an arrest made at that
rally. The strike will resume
today.
The train delay came early in
the day. A Southern Pacific
freight train, almost a mile long,
was travelling on tracks that
crossed the road serving the plant
entrance. Pickets milling around
in front of the entrance did not
notice the train coming at first.
When the train was noticed,
pickets ran own the tracks waving
their arms and warning the main
group of demonstrators to get out
of the way. This caught the
attention of the train engineer,
who braked the train to a stop,
but not until it had overshot the
main group of pickets by about
150 yards. Nobody was hit.
