# Student Senate
## Large Turnout For Senate 
### 
More than 125 students have
plunged into the race for forty
seats on the New Associated
Students Senate.
A list of candidates was
released yesterday soon after the
5 p.m. deadline for submitting
nominating petitions.
Competition in some categories
will be fierce. Sixty
undergraduates are scrambling for
ten spots representing humanities
and sciences. Twenty-two
candidates must fight over 8
general studies seats.
Less intense competition faces
candidates in graduate divisions
and in undergraduate engineering.
Voting has been re-scheduled
for Thrusday and Friday of next
week. Original plans called for
balloting on Wednesday and
Thursday, but they were altered
to avoid conflict with Vietnam
Moratorium activities.
Throughout the nominating
process last week, slates and
rumors of slates coagulated and
dissolved.
More than 20 well-known
left-leaning students got together
earlier this week after
encouragement by members of
the ASSU Council of Presidents,
fearing an organized push from

moderate and conservative
candidates by the Coalition for an
Academic Community (CAC).
CAC president Jim Schneider
said yesterday, "We have no
coalition whatsoever." Schneider,
a candidate himself, said he had
personally encouraged about
seven other people to run.
He explained, "CAC is trying to
encourage as large a participation
as possible in the election." The
organization, which controls

considerable funds, put some
effort into publicizing the
election, but will not contribute
money or publicity to particular
candidates, Schneider said.
However, the left-leaning
coalition's status appears unclear
at this time. Although several
meetings wore held last week, no
cohesive group seems to be
emerging. Efforts to present a
unified slate may continue,
however.
