# TROJANS ARE A BIG PUT-ON
## 
### 
Today at noon, 46 athletes leave
Stanford for a weekend in Los Angeles,
all expenses paid, to play a game of
football. The athletes are excited.
Apparently so is the student body.
Hordes of fans will travel to LA for the
game to see Stanford try for their first
Rose Bowl in years. The busses are
chartered, the signs ("Trojans are a put
on") are up on the frats, and the torch
light rally is over.
Last night's rally drew close to 400
people at its peak, and the flares managed
to burn holes in jackets, pants, and
bodies. The band played and the dollies
danced, just like college football rallies
are supposed to be. The band leader
jumped in Mem Claw in a fit of frenzy,
but the crowd didn't really respond.
Fhe spirit of Little big Game is here.
Vietnam will wait.
