# Letters To The Editor
## Why William Buckley? 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
How can the Stanford student
body support the decisions of an
unrepresentative board?
I didn't say that the skeleton
Political Union Board has been
totally inactive, but that it hasn't
tried hard enough (and that it
can't because of how it's
constituted).
I won't accept letters fired off
hurriedly as sufficient attempts to
bring political speakers to campus.
I won't accept Roger Reed's
definition of liberal, or his
opinion of who warrants
invitations.
I've talked to friends in the
BSU and MECHA, and Reed
didn't consult with those
organizations about speakers. He
didn't ask SDS for suggestions. He
hasn't contacted the Democratic
Club or any other group, and
invitations from campus groups
could help.
Let's consider Tom Bradley.
There's a girl here named Cindy
Cannady who's done research for
Bradley. Members of the
Democratic Club flew down to
L.A. to walk precincts for
Bradley. And Bradley's nephew,
Harold Becks, is a student here.
Reed didn't ask anyone for help.
But here's the real issue: why
should the Stanford student body
give $2000 to a millionaire like
William Buckley? Why should we
give $2000 to anyone? Why can't
we work harder to bring more
speakers here with our money?
Now that the Political Union
mess is out in the open, I'd like to
suggest that all students send
names of political speakers they'd
like to see at Stanford this year to
the Political Union Board, ASSU
Office, Stanford, Ca. 94305.
Perhaps we can clean it up.

To express our opposition to the
war,
To mobilize dissent and
disseminate literature opposed to
U.S. involvement in Vietnam,
And to continue political
pressure to end the war soon,
We support the October 15
moratorium and will "stop
business as usual," so that soon
the business of killing might
ccase.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Disturbed by recent articles in
the Daily, and on behalf of those
of us women who really dig being
female in all of its wide and
challenging aspects, I would like
to ask each member of the WLF if
she has ever considered what it
really means for her to be a
woman in relation to a man. I
agree that to develop a
relationship with men and males
in general is far more exciting,
rewarding, and satisfying when
the two are free to full express
themselves on whatever level they
choose—intellectual, academic,
economic, or any other. When all
this is said and done, however,
there still remains that
centuries-old distinction between
male and female. And in that
distinction lies a whole new realm
of mutual exploration and
discovery which, when left to
flower, brings more excitement,
more reward, and more pure
pleasure than either male or
female can find alone.
In a world that can be as
frustrating, frightening and
depressing as this one can, I am
constantly renewed by the fact
that this phenomenon exists
today—when women are more
liberated than in any other period
in history. In it, I find the peace,
beauty and love this world so
desperately needs to survive.
Every female and every male has
the eternal potential to experience
this phenomenon, if they will give

their bodies the attention and
expression they give every other
aspect of their world they
consider important. Try being
intelligent, alert, challenging, and,
yes, demanding—and soft, warm,
and loving. If nothing else works,
this will.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I do not dispute Jane Franklin's
analysis (column on women's
liberation in the 7 Oct. Daily) that
it is the men and women of the
International Industrial
Conference who are the
perpetuators of starvation, be it in
the U.S. or the third world, and
thus the people's enemy; however,
I do think she omits part of the
point of the existence of a
women's liberation movement
when she limits herself to calling
for the overthrow of the ruling
minority of this country and its
"free world" satellites. The point,
it seems to me, of an autonomous
women's movement is that the
present system has built into it
discrimination against women that
is based not simply on objective
factors; as with racism, the
phenomenon is deeply rooted in
the consciousness of all members
of the society and thus will not
easily or automatically be
overcome, even with radical
changes in productive relations.
It will therefore not suffice for
women merely to fight side by
side with men against their
common oppressor: they must do
so with full consciousness of their
own peculiar oppression in its
myriad forms and with
determination not to compromise
themselves for the sake of an
abstract "greater good." It is my

belief that that is the only way to
insure that women will not be
sent back into the never-never
land of "woman's place" when
the fight against corporate
capitalism is won.

How can the Stanford student
body support the decisions of an
unrepresentative board?
I didn't say that the skeleton
Political Union Board has been
totally inactive, but that it hasn't
tried hard enough (and that it
can't because of how it's
constituted).
I won't accept letters fired off
hurriedly as sufficient attempts to
bring political speakers to campus.
I won't accept Roger Reed's
definition of liberal, or his
opinion of who warrants
invitations.
I've talked to friends in the
BSU and MECHA, and Reed
didn't consult with those
organizations about speakers. He
didn't ask SDS for suggestions. He
hasn't contacted the Democratic
Club or any other group, and
invitations from campus groups
could help.
Let's consider Tom Bradley.
There's a girl here named Cindy
Cannady who's done research for
Bradley. Members of the
Democratic Club flew down to
L.A. to walk precincts for
Bradley. And Bradley's nephew,
Harold Becks, is a student here.
Reed didn't ask anyone for help.
But here's the real issue: why
should the Stanford student body
give $2000 to a millionaire like
William Buckley? Why should we
give $2000 to anyone? Why can't
we work harder to bring more
speakers here with our money?
Now that the Political Union
mess is out in the open, I'd like to
suggest that all students send
names of political speakers they'd
like to see at Stanford this year to
the Political Union Board, ASSU
Office, Stanford, Ca. 94305.
Perhaps we can clean it up.

Disturbed by recent articles in
the Daily, and on behalf of those
of us women who really dig being
female in all of its wide and
challenging aspects, I would like
to ask each member of the WLF if
she has ever considered what it
really means for her to be a
woman in relation to a man. I
agree that to develop a
relationship with men and males
in general is far more exciting,
rewarding, and satisfying when
the two are free to full express
themselves on whatever level they
choose—intellectual, academic,
economic, or any other. When all
this is said and done, however,
there still remains that
centuries-old distinction between
male and female. And in that
distinction lies a whole new realm
of mutual exploration and
discovery which, when left to
flower, brings more excitement,
more reward, and more pure
pleasure than either male or
female can find alone.
In a world that can be as
frustrating, frightening and
depressing as this one can, I am
constantly renewed by the fact
that this phenomenon exists
today—when women are more
liberated than in any other period
in history. In it, I find the peace,
beauty and love this world so
desperately needs to survive.
Every female and every male has
the eternal potential to experience
this phenomenon, if they will give

their bodies the attention and
expression they give every other
aspect of their world they
consider important. Try being
intelligent, alert, challenging, and,
yes, demanding—and soft, warm,
and loving. If nothing else works,
this will.

I do not dispute Jane Franklin's
analysis (column on women's
liberation in the 7 Oct. Daily) that
it is the men and women of the
International Industrial
Conference who are the
perpetuators of starvation, be it in
the U.S. or the third world, and
thus the people's enemy; however,
I do think she omits part of the
point of the existence of a
women's liberation movement
when she limits herself to calling
for the overthrow of the ruling
minority of this country and its
"free world" satellites. The point,
it seems to me, of an autonomous
women's movement is that the
present system has built into it
discrimination against women that
is based not simply on objective
factors; as with racism, the
phenomenon is deeply rooted in
the consciousness of all members
of the society and thus will not
easily or automatically be
overcome, even with radical
changes in productive relations.
It will therefore not suffice for
women merely to fight side by
side with men against their
common oppressor: they must do
so with full consciousness of their
own peculiar oppression in its
myriad forms and with
determination not to compromise
themselves for the sake of an
abstract "greater good." It is my

factors; as with racism, the
phenomenon is deeply rooted in
the consciousness of all members
of the society and thus will not
easily or automatically be
overcome, even with radical
changes in productive relations.
It will therefore not suffice for
women merely to fight side by
side with men against their
common oppressor: they must do
so with full consciousness of their
own peculiar oppression in its
myriad forms and with
determination not to compromise
themselves for the sake of an
abstract "greater good." It is my

belief that that is the only way to
insure that women will not be
sent back into the never-never
land of "woman's place" when
the fight against corporate
capitalism is won.

How can the Stanford student
body support the decisions of an
unrepresentative board?
I didn't say that the skeleton
Political Union Board has been
totally inactive, but that it hasn't
tried hard enough (and that it
can't because of how it's
constituted).
I won't accept letters fired off
hurriedly as sufficient attempts to
bring political speakers to campus.
I won't accept Roger Reed's
definition of liberal, or his
opinion of who warrants
invitations.
I've talked to friends in the
BSU and MECHA, and Reed
didn't consult with those
organizations about speakers. He
didn't ask SDS for suggestions. He
hasn't contacted the Democratic
Club or any other group, and
invitations from campus groups
could help.
Let's consider Tom Bradley.
There's a girl here named Cindy
Cannady who's done research for
Bradley. Members of the
Democratic Club flew down to
L.A. to walk precincts for
Bradley. And Bradley's nephew,
Harold Becks, is a student here.
Reed didn't ask anyone for help.
But here's the real issue: why
should the Stanford student body
give $2000 to a millionaire like
William Buckley? Why should we
give $2000 to anyone? Why can't
we work harder to bring more
speakers here with our money?
Now that the Political Union
mess is out in the open, I'd like to
suggest that all students send
names of political speakers they'd
like to see at Stanford this year to
the Political Union Board, ASSU
Office, Stanford, Ca. 94305.
Perhaps we can clean it up.

Disturbed by recent articles in
the Daily, and on behalf of those
of us women who really dig being
female in all of its wide and
challenging aspects, I would like
to ask each member of the WLF if
she has ever considered what it
really means for her to be a
woman in relation to a man. I
agree that to develop a
relationship with men and males
in general is far more exciting,
rewarding, and satisfying when
the two are free to full express
themselves on whatever level they
choose—intellectual, academic,
economic, or any other. When all
this is said and done, however,
there still remains that
centuries-old distinction between
male and female. And in that
distinction lies a whole new realm
of mutual exploration and
discovery which, when left to
flower, brings more excitement,
more reward, and more pure
pleasure than either male or
female can find alone.
In a world that can be as
frustrating, frightening and
depressing as this one can, I am
constantly renewed by the fact
that this phenomenon exists
today—when women are more
liberated than in any other period
in history. In it, I find the peace,
beauty and love this world so
desperately needs to survive.
Every female and every male has
the eternal potential to experience
this phenomenon, if they will give

their bodies the attention and
expression they give every other
aspect of their world they
consider important. Try being
intelligent, alert, challenging, and,
yes, demanding—and soft, warm,
and loving. If nothing else works,
this will.

I do not dispute Jane Franklin's
analysis (column on women's
liberation in the 7 Oct. Daily) that
it is the men and women of the
International Industrial
Conference who are the
perpetuators of starvation, be it in
the U.S. or the third world, and
thus the people's enemy; however,
I do think she omits part of the
point of the existence of a
women's liberation movement
when she limits herself to calling
for the overthrow of the ruling
minority of this country and its
"free world" satellites. The point,
it seems to me, of an autonomous
women's movement is that the
present system has built into it
discrimination against women that
is based not simply on objective
factors; as with racism, the
phenomenon is deeply rooted in
the consciousness of all members
of the society and thus will not
easily or automatically be
