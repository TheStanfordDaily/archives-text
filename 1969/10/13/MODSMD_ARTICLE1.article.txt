# President Replaces Draft Agency Head
## 
### ED KOHN 
Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, 76,
was relieved of his post as director
of the Selective Service System by
President Nixon Saturday. He will
be promoted to a four star general
and will be named an advisor to
the President on manpower utili
zation when ho leaves his present
position on Feb. 16.
Gen. Hershey served as director
of the system since 1941, and was
its moving force since 1936. Pres
sure for his replacement has been
growing for many years, especially
after his policies regarding student
deferments started to come under
heavy criticism.
Nixon's announcement fol
lowed a fifty minute meeting with
Gen. Hershey at the White House.
No successor was immediately
named, but a deputy director will
be appointed shortly. A new
director will be appointed Feb.
16.
"The nation owes Gen. Hersh
ey a hearty 'well done," the Presi
dent said. Gen. Hershey was not
immediately available for com
ment, but a White House spokes
man said he was "very pleased
with his responsibilities."
Nixon added, "Few Americans
have performed a more important
service to their country through
difficult and often turbulent
days."
A Legend '
During his years of service, the
general became a legend and an
institution. He grew impervious to
controversy and shifting political
currents. He scolded "slackers"
and "shirkers" and told all comers
that the draft was one of those
things that people don't like to do
but must because they ought to.
"Outside the income tax"
Hershey said, "there aren't many
things to make the male citizen
feel much responsibility to the
government any more. The Selec
tive Service is one of them."
In 1967, he sent a letter to the
country's 4,000 local draft boards
that seemingly invited them to
punish anti-war demonstrators by
promptly inducting them.
Last June, a United States
Court of Appeals ruled that draft

boards had no right to reclassify
registrants because of antiwar
activity.
Campus Comment
Roger Wilner, president of the
Stanford Democratic Club, told
the Daily last night that "I'm glad
to see the guy go, finally." He said
that the move was "past overdue"
and called Hershey's replacement
"part of an attempt to buy off
sentiment of the young people."
He also called for the replacement
of J. Edgar Hoover, Director of
the FBI.
Stanford Young Republican
president Mike Wolf said, "The
President's action will have little
effect on the more frenetic
Hershey haters, but at least it does
away with one high bogey manâ€”
and it may serve to alleviate some
what the popular anguish. I'm all
for it."
Stanford's Director of Special
Services, Alan Strain, could not be
reached for comment last night.
