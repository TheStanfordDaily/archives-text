## Stand Above Principles 
### Lorie Tarshis 
We good guys always have
principles and worth-while goals;
that is what makes us so good.
But if we are not far more careful
than we have been, it is also likely
to keep us more or less continual
ly on the outside—principled but
powerless.
Depending upon the im
portance of the issues that con
front us, there are occasions when
we good guys should learn to
stand above our principles.
The position of those who
protest U.S. involvement in Viet
Nam is vastly different from what
it was three or four years ago. At
that time no more than one per
son in four or five opposed LBJ's
drive for victory or doubted his
optimistic predictions. Now, a
safe majority are persuaded that
victory is unattainable and many
would go further and insist that
our involvement should end now
without regard to questions of
victory or defeat. Thus, there has
recently been something like a
dove explosion.
Unfortunately, however, there
has been no such growth in he
influence of the Doves. Our cur
rent Commander-in-Chief
sounds—if you substitute South
ern California pool-set manners
for Texan manners (sic!)—very
much the same as the Emeritus
holder of that title. Our official
policy is still Peace with Victory,
with "Peace" being underlined
more or less strongly in direct
proportion to the strength the
doves show in the Gallup Poll.
(iood (>iiy Impotence
In my judgment, our im
potence does not arise from Presi
dent Nixon's attitude as indicated
by his statement in referring to

the planned demonstrations for
October 15: " . . .under no cir
cumstances will I be affected by
it."
A more plausible interpretation
of our impotence is that our
principles often stand so high that
we cannot see over them; and
worse, they divide us when in
stead they should inform our joint
actions.
Fifty million people—even
good ones—are bound to have
widely differing patterns of prior
ities. Some of us want the U.S. to
get out of Viet Nam and the
American Social System to be
destroyed; others want the U.S.
out of Viet Nam and the popula
tion explosion to be dampened;
others a withdrawal from Viet
Nam and a rapid improvement in
the position of black people, fe
males or males. And complicating
the matter further, our ideals are
by no means uniform either.
Some on grounds of principle
oppose all violence; others instead
are little concerned with violence
as a matter of principle, but in
stead want their goals to be served
on a platter made out of equity,
love, due process, or what have
you. About the only thing that
can be said about such a vast army
is that all its members share the
one goal: "Out of Viet Nam
Now "

And, unfortunately, coopera
tion inside this body is rarely
achieved. X refuses to march in
Y's demonstration (against U.S.
involvement in Viet Nam) because
he suspects that Y does not share
his views as to how the black (or
white) problem should be solved.
Y refuses to join Z in supporting a

certain candidate because he fears
that Z does not regard the de
struction of all the universities of
the country to be essential. Z
cannot join with A in a protest
because A does not share his
principles down to the last dot; he
may, for example, not believe that
a professor's absolute obligation is
to meet his class every day on the
hour: (except when social or
professional engagements get in
the way).
Naturally, the upshot is that
the Doves are very rarely able to
bring their full strength to bear.
More of their energies than they
can afford are invested in fighting
one another and are not available
for their primary struggle.
There are two solutions. For
one thing, we must realize that to
stand on one's principles is often a
terribly expensive luxury. It is a
luxury that we must indulge,
when the principle in question is
one on which we place a very high
value; otherwise, to do so can be
counterproductive in terms of
more important goals.
Mutual Reaped
And just as we must be a little
less considerate in respect to our
own aims and principles, so we
must show a great deal more
consideration to the ideals and
goals of others—and especially to
those others who share the goals
that we hold to be most impor
tant.
Only if we can manage to be a
little less self-righteous with one
another on less important issues,
may we hope to be able to assert
our will over those who stand in
our way on the one issue that at
present transcends all others.
