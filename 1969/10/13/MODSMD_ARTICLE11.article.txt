# Tragic Parallel
## Twain 'On Vietnam' 
### 
The following is a fragment
from a suppressed book by Mark
Twain entitled "Glances at His
tory" or "Outlines of History.'
The fragment refers to the U.S.
occupation of the Philippines
during the late 19th century, but
a parallel with our present involve
ment in Vietnam is apparent. The
exerpt was submitted by Felix
Bloch and W.E. Meyerhof, pro
fessors of physics.
We, free citizens of the Great
Republic, feel an honest pride in
her greatness, her strength, her
just and gentle government, her
wide liberties, her honored name,
her stainless history, her un
smirched flag, her hands clean
from oppression of the weak and
from malicious conquest, her
hospitable door that stands open
to the hunted and the persecuted
of all nations; we are proud of the
judicious respect in which she is
held by the monarchies which
hem her in on every side, and
proudest of all that lofty patrio
tism which we inherited from our
fathers, which we have kept pure,
and which won our liberties in the
beginning and has preserved them
unto this day. While that patrio
tism endures the Republic is safe,
her greatness is secure, and against
them the powers of the earth
cannot prevail.

I pray you to pause and con
sider. Against our traditions we
are now entering upon an unjust
and trivial war, a war against a
helpless people, and for a base
object—robbery. At first our
citizens spoke out against this
thing, by an impulse natural to
their training. Today they have
turned, and their voice is the
other way. What caused the
change? Merely a politician's
trick—a high-sounding phrase, a
blood-stirring phrase which turned
their uncritical heads: Our Coun
try, right or wrong! An empty
phrase, a silly phrase. It was
shouted by every newspaper, it
was thundered from the pulpit,
the Superintendent of Public In
struction placarded it in every
schoolhouse in the land, the War
Department inscribed it upon the
flag. And every man who failed to
shout it or who was silent, was
proclaimed a traitor —none but
those others were patriots. To be
a patriot, one had to say, and
keep saying, "Our Country, right
or wrong," and urge on the little
war. Have you not perceived that
that phrase is an insult to the
nation?
The People's Country
For in a republic, who is "the
Country"? Is it the Government
which is for the moment in the
saddle? Why, the Government is
merely a servant—merely a
temporary servant; it cannot be its
prerogative to determine what is
right and what is wrong, and
decide who is a patriot and who
isn't. Its function is to obey
orders, not originate them. Who,
then, is "the Country"? Is it the
newspaper? is it the pulpit? is it
the school superintendent? Why,
these are mere parts of the coun
try, not the whole of it; they have
not command, they have only
their little share in the command.
They are but one in the thousand
that command is lodged; they
must determine what is right and
what is wrong; they must decide
who is a patriot and who isn't.

Who are the thousand—that is
to say, who are "the Country"? In
a monarchy, he king and his fam
ily are the country; in a republic it
is the common voice of the peo
ple. Each of you, for himself, by
himself and on his own responsi
bility, must speak. And it is a
solemn and weighty responsibil
ity, and not lightly to be flung
aside at the bullying of pulpit,
press, government, or the empty
catch-harases of politicians. Each
must for himself alone decide
what is right and what is wrong,
and which course is patriotic and
which isn't. You cannot shirk this
and be a man. To decide it against
your convictions is to be an un
qualified and inexcusable traitor,
both to yourself and to your
country, let men label you as they
may. If you alone of all the nation
shall decide one way, and that
way be the right way according to
your convictions of the right, you
have done your duty by yourself
and by your country—hold up
your head! You have nothing to
be ashamed of.
Only when a republic's life is in
danger should a man uphold his
government when it is in the
wrong. There is no other time.
Inglorious Peace
This Republic's life is not in
peril. The nation has sold its
honor for a phrase. It has swung
itself loose from its safe anchorage
and is drifting, its helm is in pirate
hands. The stupid phrase needed
help and it got another one:
"Even if the war be wrong we are
in it and must fight it out: we
cannot retire from it without
dishonor." Why, not even a
burglar could have said it better.
We cannot withdraw from this
sordid raid because to grant peace
to those little people upon their
terms —independence—would dis
honor us. You have flung away
Adam's phrase—you should take it
up and examine it again. He said,
"An inglorious peace is better
than a dishonorable war."

The fragment refers to the U.S.
occupation of the Philippines
during the late 19th century, but
a parallel with our present involve
ment in Vietnam is apparent. The
exerpt was submitted by Felix
Bloch and W.E. Meyerhof, pro
fessors of physics.
We, free citizens of the Great
Republic, feel an honest pride in
her greatness, her strength, her
just and gentle government, her
wide liberties, her honored name,
her stainless history, her un
smirched flag, her hands clean
from oppression of the weak and
from malicious conquest, her
hospitable door that stands open
to the hunted and the persecuted
of all nations; we are proud of the
judicious respect in which she is
held by the monarchies which
hem her in on every side, and
proudest of all that lofty patrio
tism which we inherited from our
fathers, which we have kept pure,
and which won our liberties in the
beginning and has preserved them
unto this day. While that patrio
tism endures the Republic is safe,
her greatness is secure, and against
them the powers of the earth
cannot prevail.

I pray you to pause and con
sider. Against our traditions we
are now entering upon an unjust
and trivial war, a war against a
helpless people, and for a base
object—robbery. At first our
citizens spoke out against this
thing, by an impulse natural to
their training. Today they have
turned, and their voice is the
other way. What caused the
change? Merely a politician's
trick—a high-sounding phrase, a
blood-stirring phrase which turned
their uncritical heads: Our Coun
try, right or wrong! An empty
phrase, a silly phrase. It was
shouted by every newspaper, it
was thundered from the pulpit,
the Superintendent of Public In
struction placarded it in every
schoolhouse in the land, the War
Department inscribed it upon the
flag. And every man who failed to
shout it or who was silent, was
proclaimed a traitor —none but
those others were patriots. To be
a patriot, one had to say, and
keep saying, "Our Country, right
or wrong," and urge on the little
war. Have you not perceived that
that phrase is an insult to the
nation?
The People's Country
For in a republic, who is "the
Country"? Is it the Government
which is for the moment in the
saddle? Why, the Government is
merely a servant—merely a
temporary servant; it cannot be its
prerogative to determine what is
right and what is wrong, and
decide who is a patriot and who
isn't. Its function is to obey
orders, not originate them. Who,
then, is "the Country"? Is it the
newspaper? is it the pulpit? is it
the school superintendent? Why,
these are mere parts of the coun
try, not the whole of it; they have
not command, they have only
their little share in the command.
They are but one in the thousand
that command is lodged; they
must determine what is right and
what is wrong; they must decide
who is a patriot and who isn't.

Who are the thousand—that is
to say, who are "the Country"? In
a monarchy, he king and his fam
ily are the country; in a republic it
is the common voice of the peo
ple. Each of you, for himself, by
himself and on his own responsi
bility, must speak. And it is a
solemn and weighty responsibil
ity, and not lightly to be flung
aside at the bullying of pulpit,
press, government, or the empty
catch-harases of politicians. Each
must for himself alone decide
what is right and what is wrong,
and which course is patriotic and
which isn't. You cannot shirk this
and be a man. To decide it against
your convictions is to be an un
qualified and inexcusable traitor,
both to yourself and to your
country, let men label you as they
may. If you alone of all the nation
shall decide one way, and that
way be the right way according to
your convictions of the right, you
have done your duty by yourself
and by your country—hold up
your head! You have nothing to
be ashamed of.
Only when a republic's life is in
danger should a man uphold his
government when it is in the
wrong. There is no other time.
Inglorious Peace
This Republic's life is not in
peril. The nation has sold its
honor for a phrase. It has swung
itself loose from its safe anchorage
and is drifting, its helm is in pirate
hands. The stupid phrase needed
help and it got another one:
"Even if the war be wrong we are
in it and must fight it out: we
cannot retire from it without
dishonor." Why, not even a
burglar could have said it better.
We cannot withdraw from this
sordid raid because to grant peace
to those little people upon their
terms —independence—would dis
honor us. You have flung away
Adam's phrase—you should take it
up and examine it again. He said,
"An inglorious peace is better
than a dishonorable war."

ment in Vietnam is apparent. The
exerpt was submitted by Felix
Bloch and W.E. Meyerhof, pro
fessors of physics.
We, free citizens of the Great
Republic, feel an honest pride in
her greatness, her strength, her
just and gentle government, her
wide liberties, her honored name,
her stainless history, her un
smirched flag, her hands clean
from oppression of the weak and
from malicious conquest, her
hospitable door that stands open
to the hunted and the persecuted
of all nations; we are proud of the
judicious respect in which she is
held by the monarchies which
hem her in on every side, and
proudest of all that lofty patrio
tism which we inherited from our
fathers, which we have kept pure,
and which won our liberties in the
beginning and has preserved them
unto this day. While that patrio
tism endures the Republic is safe,
her greatness is secure, and against
them the powers of the earth
cannot prevail.

I pray you to pause and con
sider. Against our traditions we
are now entering upon an unjust
and trivial war, a war against a
helpless people, and for a base
object—robbery. At first our
citizens spoke out against this
thing, by an impulse natural to
their training. Today they have
turned, and their voice is the
other way. What caused the
change? Merely a politician's
trick—a high-sounding phrase, a
blood-stirring phrase which turned
their uncritical heads: Our Coun
try, right or wrong! An empty
phrase, a silly phrase. It was
shouted by every newspaper, it
was thundered from the pulpit,
the Superintendent of Public In
struction placarded it in every
schoolhouse in the land, the War
Department inscribed it upon the
flag. And every man who failed to
shout it or who was silent, was
proclaimed a traitor —none but
those others were patriots. To be
a patriot, one had to say, and
keep saying, "Our Country, right
or wrong," and urge on the little
war. Have you not perceived that
that phrase is an insult to the
nation?
The People's Country
For in a republic, who is "the
Country"? Is it the Government
which is for the moment in the
saddle? Why, the Government is
merely a servant—merely a
temporary servant; it cannot be its
prerogative to determine what is
right and what is wrong, and
decide who is a patriot and who
isn't. Its function is to obey
orders, not originate them. Who,
then, is "the Country"? Is it the
newspaper? is it the pulpit? is it
the school superintendent? Why,
these are mere parts of the coun
try, not the whole of it; they have
not command, they have only
their little share in the command.
They are but one in the thousand
that command is lodged; they
must determine what is right and
what is wrong; they must decide
who is a patriot and who isn't.

Who are the thousand—that is
to say, who are "the Country"? In
a monarchy, he king and his fam
ily are the country; in a republic it
is the common voice of the peo
ple. Each of you, for himself, by
himself and on his own responsi
bility, must speak. And it is a
solemn and weighty responsibil
ity, and not lightly to be flung
aside at the bullying of pulpit,
press, government, or the empty
catch-harases of politicians. Each
must for himself alone decide
what is right and what is wrong,
and which course is patriotic and
which isn't. You cannot shirk this
and be a man. To decide it against
your convictions is to be an un
qualified and inexcusable traitor,
both to yourself and to your
country, let men label you as they
may. If you alone of all the nation
shall decide one way, and that
way be the right way according to
your convictions of the right, you
have done your duty by yourself
and by your country—hold up
your head! You have nothing to
be ashamed of.
Only when a republic's life is in
danger should a man uphold his
government when it is in the
wrong. There is no other time.
Inglorious Peace
This Republic's life is not in
peril. The nation has sold its
honor for a phrase. It has swung
itself loose from its safe anchorage
and is drifting, its helm is in pirate
hands. The stupid phrase needed
help and it got another one:
"Even if the war be wrong we are
in it and must fight it out: we
cannot retire from it without
dishonor." Why, not even a
burglar could have said it better.
We cannot withdraw from this
sordid raid because to grant peace
to those little people upon their
terms —independence—would dis
honor us. You have flung away
Adam's phrase—you should take it
up and examine it again. He said,
"An inglorious peace is better
than a dishonorable war."
The following is a fragment
from a suppressed book by Mark
Twain entitled "Glances at His
tory" or "Outlines of History.'
The fragment refers to the U.S.
occupation of the Philippines
during the late 19th century, but
