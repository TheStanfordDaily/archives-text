## Lyman Criticized 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Provost Lyman says he does
not think it is the purpose of the
Moratorium to sacrifice the teach
ing of classes for opposing a war
(Daily, Oct. 9). It seems to me
that his priorities' are extremely
mixed-up. What about the sacri
fice of human life in Vietnam?
Surely one of the purposes of the
moratorium is to remember the
dead; the human lives sacrificed in
a terrible, useless and utterly
wrong war, and to speak as
though teaching classes were more
important than stopping the war,
is unbelievable.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The Viet Nam crisis has re
vealed its grasp on the nation in
yet another way. This specter has
become so overwhelming that
some feel obligated to dedicate
any and all forms of human activ
ity toward ending the war or
other problems. Yesterday, The
Daily implied that a person must
justify his laughter and fun at a
football rally as long as there are
more important priorities in the
world.
I share the disgust of seeing
more peoole attending football
games and other entertainments
than attending anti-war demon
strations, but we do need some
occasional fantasy escapes
football, movies, drugs, and sex
to name a few. If going to a rally
once in a while keeps some people
from getting more neurotic in this
place, fine.
Pleasant diversions and a social
conscience can coexist. If the
diversions dominate, the ignored
war harms us physically; if the
diversions were dropped, we'd be
wounded spiritually.

Moratorium A Fraud
Editor, THE DAILY:
Of course radicals have to par
ticipate, but the moratorium is a
fraud. Getting the U.S. out of S.E.
Asia doesn't mean using our
troops only for support. It doesn't
mean just bringing home the
troops. The U.S. is dropping more
bombs on Laotian villagers now
than we were dropping on North
Vietnam two years ago. It doesn't
take troops there to destroy peo
ples and nations. We need to close
down ALL U.S. economic, mili
tary, political, control over S.E.
Asia.
Webster says moratorium
means delay. What the morator
ium wants to delay is the con
tinued radicalization of the pub
lic. Nixon is likely to "respond"
to the so-called pressure; but the
pressure was generated by the
same interests that put Nixon in
power, not by the people. (One
Church group asked Nixon to lead
the Moratorium). What a great
publicity stunt. (Withdraw some
troops, but get more entrenched
in S.E. Asia). But it just won't
work.
Everyone knows SRI isn't get
ting out of Thailand. Union Oil
and Tenneco and Chase Manhat
tan Bank (Bill Hewlett was just
added to the Board) aren't forget
ting about S.E. Asia. And since
those companies are run by Stan
ford people, I guess Pitzer isn't
going to forget about S.E. Asia
either. The Stanford students who
ring doorbells for peace may for
get about U.S. imperialism after
Oct. 15, but the workers who are
being forced off the job, the new
youth movement, and the black
revolutionaries don't know how
to forget reality. Get Stanford out
of S.E. Asia and withdraw all
troops and bases now.

some feel obligated to dedicate
any and all forms of human activ
ity toward ending the war or
other problems. Yesterday, The
Daily implied that a person must
justify his laughter and fun at a
football rally as long as there are
more important priorities in the
world.
I share the disgust of seeing
more peoole attending football
games and other entertainments
than attending anti-war demon
strations, but we do need some
occasional fantasy escapes
football, movies, drugs, and sex
to name a few. If going to a rally
once in a while keeps some people
from getting more neurotic in this
place, fine.
Pleasant diversions and a social
conscience can coexist. If the
diversions dominate, the ignored
war harms us physically; if the
diversions were dropped, we'd be
wounded spiritually.

Moratorium A Fraud
Editor, THE DAILY:
Of course radicals have to par
ticipate, but the moratorium is a
fraud. Getting the U.S. out of S.E.
Asia doesn't mean using our
troops only for support. It doesn't
mean just bringing home the
troops. The U.S. is dropping more
bombs on Laotian villagers now
than we were dropping on North
Vietnam two years ago. It doesn't
take troops there to destroy peo
ples and nations. We need to close
down ALL U.S. economic, mili
tary, political, control over S.E.
Asia.
Webster says moratorium
means delay. What the morator
ium wants to delay is the con
tinued radicalization of the pub
lic. Nixon is likely to "respond"
to the so-called pressure; but the
pressure was generated by the
same interests that put Nixon in
power, not by the people. (One
Church group asked Nixon to lead
the Moratorium). What a great
publicity stunt. (Withdraw some
troops, but get more entrenched
in S.E. Asia). But it just won't
work.
Everyone knows SRI isn't get
ting out of Thailand. Union Oil
and Tenneco and Chase Manhat
tan Bank (Bill Hewlett was just
added to the Board) aren't forget
ting about S.E. Asia. And since
those companies are run by Stan
ford people, I guess Pitzer isn't
going to forget about S.E. Asia
either. The Stanford students who
ring doorbells for peace may for
get about U.S. imperialism after
Oct. 15, but the workers who are
being forced off the job, the new
youth movement, and the black
revolutionaries don't know how
to forget reality. Get Stanford out
of S.E. Asia and withdraw all
troops and bases now.

Provost Lyman says he does
not think it is the purpose of the
Moratorium to sacrifice the teach
ing of classes for opposing a war
(Daily, Oct. 9). It seems to me
that his priorities' are extremely
mixed-up. What about the sacri
fice of human life in Vietnam?
Surely one of the purposes of the
moratorium is to remember the
dead; the human lives sacrificed in
a terrible, useless and utterly
wrong war, and to speak as
though teaching classes were more
important than stopping the war,
is unbelievable.
