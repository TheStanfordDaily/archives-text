## Renoir, Godard Featured 
### TODD McCARTHY 
While this week's movie
schedule is less spectacular than
those of the past couple of stan
zas, it offers the fortunate op
portunity to catch a film by
Renoir, as well as an interesting
Godard and Paul Newman's frist
directorial effort.
Five Star Final sounds like a
good "tough guy" film, as Edward
G. Robinson stars in this 1931
newspaper drama. Mervyn Leßoy
directed and the young Boris

Karloff appears in a supporting
role. Also showing in Geology 320
on Tuesday is Bachelor Apart
ment which stars one of Clive's
favorites, Mae Murray. And
there's always Clive himself
The International Center is
showing another obscure one this
week, Sansho the Bailiff. What
ever it is, it's showing this Thurs
day in Cubberley.
My Life to Live was Jaun-Luc
Godard's fourth film, made in
1962, and represents the direc
tor's most concentrated analysis
of prostitution, a subject which is
briefly dealt with in several of his
films. Presented in a series of 12
tableaux, the picture features
Anna Karina as Nana and a
musical score by Michel Legrand.
At Tresidder on Friday.
Ballad of a Soldier was highly
praised in 1960 as being a major
break-through in the Russian
cinema, for it sets forth a mini
mum of propaganda and concen
trates on a personal love story.
Unfortunately, the film is also
old-fashioned, maudlin and, for a
romance, excessively cold. If
you're still curious, the picture
will be presented in Cubberley on
Friday at 7:30 and 9:30.
Jean Renoir made Boudu
Saved from Drowning back in
1931, but only for a couple of
years has it been available to
American audiences. A sweet,
nostalgic picture, Michel Simon
(The Two of Us) is marvellous as

Boudu, the tramp who, despite
the opportunity, absolutely re
fuses to join the bourgeoisie. The
film, showing at Tresidder on
Saturday, also affords us an
evocative look at the Paris of the
thirties.
I felt that Paul Newman's first
film, Rachel, Rachel, was some
what over-praised upon its release
last year, but it remains a sensi
tive, touching film in an era overly
endowed with garishness and
sensationalism. Joanne Woodward
is very good indeed. At the Sun
day flicks.
SHORT TAKES: In that my
review last Friday of Putney
Swope and Take (he Money and
Run was plagued by an unusually
large number of typographical and
editorial mistakes, I especially
wish to point out that a crucial
sentence should have started out
with, "I do not ordinarily align
myself with autour critics,"
certainly not "amateur" critics.
This unfortunate slip of the type
raises issues which I don't partic
ularly care to grapple with at this
time.
A couple of weeks ago, I
looked forward to the time when
Russia's monumental War and
Peace would become more acces
sible to the Stanford community.
Well, the day has arrived, for the
epic is currently playing at the
Century 25 in San Jose and is set
to open at other theatres within
the foreseeable future.

nostalgic picture, Michel Simon
(The Two of Us) is marvellous as

Boudu, the tramp who, despite
the opportunity, absolutely re
fuses to join the bourgeoisie. The
film, showing at Tresidder on
Saturday, also affords us an
evocative look at the Paris of the
thirties.
I felt that Paul Newman's first
film, Rachel, Rachel, was some
what over-praised upon its release
last year, but it remains a sensi
tive, touching film in an era overly
endowed with garishness and
sensationalism. Joanne Woodward
is very good indeed. At the Sun
day flicks.
SHORT TAKES: In that my
review last Friday of Putney
Swope and Take (he Money and
Run was plagued by an unusually
large number of typographical and
editorial mistakes, I especially
wish to point out that a crucial
sentence should have started out
with, "I do not ordinarily align
myself with autour critics,"
certainly not "amateur" critics.
This unfortunate slip of the type
raises issues which I don't partic
ularly care to grapple with at this
time.
A couple of weeks ago, I
looked forward to the time when
Russia's monumental War and
Peace would become more acces
sible to the Stanford community.
Well, the day has arrived, for the
epic is currently playing at the
Century 25 in San Jose and is set
to open at other theatres within
the foreseeable future.
While this week's movie
schedule is less spectacular than
those of the past couple of stan
zas, it offers the fortunate op
portunity to catch a film by
Renoir, as well as an interesting
Godard and Paul Newman's frist
directorial effort.
Five Star Final sounds like a
good "tough guy" film, as Edward
G. Robinson stars in this 1931
newspaper drama. Mervyn Leßoy
directed and the young Boris

Karloff appears in a supporting
role. Also showing in Geology 320
on Tuesday is Bachelor Apart
ment which stars one of Clive's
favorites, Mae Murray. And
there's always Clive himself
The International Center is
showing another obscure one this
week, Sansho the Bailiff. What
ever it is, it's showing this Thurs
day in Cubberley.
My Life to Live was Jaun-Luc
Godard's fourth film, made in
1962, and represents the direc
tor's most concentrated analysis
of prostitution, a subject which is
briefly dealt with in several of his
films. Presented in a series of 12
tableaux, the picture features
Anna Karina as Nana and a
musical score by Michel Legrand.
At Tresidder on Friday.
Ballad of a Soldier was highly
praised in 1960 as being a major
break-through in the Russian
cinema, for it sets forth a mini
mum of propaganda and concen
trates on a personal love story.
Unfortunately, the film is also
old-fashioned, maudlin and, for a
romance, excessively cold. If
you're still curious, the picture
will be presented in Cubberley on
Friday at 7:30 and 9:30.
Jean Renoir made Boudu
Saved from Drowning back in
1931, but only for a couple of
years has it been available to
American audiences. A sweet,
nostalgic picture, Michel Simon

the opportunity, absolutely re
