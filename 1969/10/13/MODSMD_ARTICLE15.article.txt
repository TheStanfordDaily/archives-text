Demonstrator Scott Johnson,
convicted of participating in
May's SRI disturbances, was given
sentences Friday amounting to 10
days in jail, 35 days on a work
furlough program, and a year on
probation.
During the course of the trial,
the prosecution revealed that
Johnson's original name was
actually John A. Scott. In addi
tion Army records showed that
the defendant had never been
wounded in Vietnam or been
given the Purple Heart, and had
been discharged by the Navy on
bad check charges, as Johnson had
previously testified.
The sentences handed down by
Judge Edward C. Scoyen stem
from charges of disturbing the
peace, obstructing traffic, criminal
trespass (interfering with em
ployees and business as usual at
SRI), participating in an unlawful
assembly and inciting to riot.
According to Deputy District
Attorney Craig Brown it is un
certain whether Johnson will be
tried on perjury charges resulting
from false testimony about his
Army experience.

Johnson was the last of three
defendants to receive sentencing
on the same charges. Last week
Jeanne Friedman was given 30
days in jail and Myron Filene was
given five. Both are also on three
years probation.
So far only six of the 80-odd
demonstators arrested have been
sentenced. Crowded courts
dockets have forced the Santa
Clara Municipal Court to post
pone the majority of the trials
until November and December.
The accused are grouped ac
cording to the nature of their
charges and the time and place of
their alleged crimes.
