# Studio Watts To Perform
## 
### 
On Thursday through Saturday
evenings, October 16-18, the
Studio Watts Workshop Drama
Group will present The Product at
8:30 p.m. in the Little Theatre.
Tickets are available in dormator
ies and at Tresidder Union Box
Office.
The current production, direc
ted by James M. Woods, and
written by Frank Joseph and
Wanda Coleman, is an experi
mental approach to theatre. The
actors create the idea for a scene
or series of scenes and work out
the idea by role-playing an "en
counter."
Through discussions with the
director and a professional writer
a motif is extracted and the series
of "encounters" takes on form as
esthetic whole. The Studio ap
proach is unique in the The Pro
duct manages to combine theatre
as education and theatre as a
continual process of human ex
ploration.
