# Cliveden Unbelievable
## 
### 
Our own Stanford University
here in Palo Alto has often been
called an enchanted forest. As you
enter the large black gates of
England's infamous Cliveden
House, and wind your way down
the mile long drive through the
Rhodedendron Valley, past the
path to the Water Garden, around
the Fountain of Love, and down
the formal tree lined drive (of
L&M fame), you will think that
oui lovely old campus in the
States is a poverty-stricken area.
Not all of England is like the
unbelievably beautiful Cliveden
House, but a great deal of your
Britain will revolve around this
famous old mansion. You will live
there, eat your roast beef and
Yorkshire pudding (our chef's
specialty) and brussel sprouts
there, and even, if you are in the
mood, attend classes there.
For relaxation between the
trials and temptations of the rig
orous schedule, you will find the
Thames only a stone's throw
away, as well as tennis courts,

swimming pools, and numerous
lawns on which to lull.
If by chance you really don't
want to spend your entire six
months at Cliveden, you can hop
on a train and arrive in central
London in 30 minutes. Take the
tube to Picadilly, Soho, or Porto
bello RoaH

There is so much to do in jolly
old . . .that we can not possibly
list them all here.
If you would like to find out
more about this campus and the
entire overseas campus "experi
ence" please come to the large
lounge in Tresidder tonight at
8:30. Cheers, mate!
