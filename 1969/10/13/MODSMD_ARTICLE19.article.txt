# The 						Evil Kick That Wilted The Roses
## 
### FRED MANN 
"I didn't kick it good. I felt it
might not be long enough, and I
started praying. It must have been
good by six inches. It looked like
it just cleared the left goal posts. I
fell to the ground and started to
cry."
That's how Ron Ayala de
scribed it. Like so many times in
the past, it was a game that almost
was. Even closer than last year
against the Trojans, and even
more exciting and heartbreaking
than last week against Purdue.
Ayala scored the last three points
of the game with no time left to
play, and Stanford had lost a sure
upset win.
There is something uncomfort
able about being the best .500
football team in the country. If
justice has any eyesight at all, the
Tribe should be rated among the
top five teams in the nation, but
they obviously won't be. And
they also deserve some kind of
post-season reward for their fine
play, like a bowl game, but it will
take a lot of luck to get them all
to Pasadena this time around.
The season isn't over. There is
still a chance that someone in the
conference will knock off SC
and/or UCLA, and the Indians
will be back into a share of the
lead. And even if that doesn't
happen, there is always Big Game.
But no matter what happens
the rest of the way, this will be
the game they speak of all next
year, and maybe for many seasons
to come. It may well have been
the greatest of the many great
Stanford-SC meetings.
Offense Shines
Jim Plunkett again dazzled
everybody in the place with his
rifle arm. Bob Moore and Randy
Vataha made great catches, Bubba
Brown ran like his life was at
stake, and the entire defensive
team did an outstanding job con
taining nearly every phase of the
powerful USC offense.
It was also the night Steve
Horowitz almost grabbed the
headlines he really deserves. After
a slow start, he booted a 28-yard
field goal, and finally a game
winning 37-yarder with only a
minute and three seconds left to
play. But somebody changed the
script at the last second (literally),
and Ayala's field goal will be the
one remembered.
Positive Thinking
Stanford came to Los Angeles
knowing for a fact that they were
going to win their football game.
"We've had our share of moral
victories," said Don Parish, "Now
let's win a real one." The first
quarter of the game showed that
attitude. After trading fumbles
and punts, Pat Preston intercepted
a pass and three plays later, the
Tribe was on the board with a
scoring pass to Bob Moore at the
back end of the end zone.
Later on in the first half,
Plunkett stayed mainly in the air
to Jack LaSater and Howie Wil
liams to score again. A two-point
conversion failed, and Stanford
led, 12-0. Then it was Southern
Cal's turn. Jimmy Jones started to
scramble and confuse the Indian
rush, and Clarence Davis began to
act like the poor man's O.J. Simp
son as he ran crazy up the middle.
A Trojan interception didn't
do much damage. SC couldn't
move the ball, so they punted.
Stanford still proved they
couldn't handle kick returns, how
ever, as Jim Kauffman fumbled,
losing the ball on the Tribe 37.
From here, USC went on to score
two TD's in 30 seconds, the final
one being a 57-yard interception
and run by Tyrone Hudson

The start of the third quarter
found the Stanford Band chanting
"Horowitz, we love you," as Steve
booted through a 28-yarder to put
the Cards back out in front,
15-14. But Davis and Jones led a
solid SC drive up the field to put
them back on top, 20-15.
With he help of a 30-yard pass
interference penalty and Bubba's
short yardage dives, Stanford
again moved into scoring position,
and Brown leaped in for six
points. The Indians now led,
21-20, but decided to go for a
one-point conversion instead of
two which would have avoided a
game-winning field goal by the
Trojans. A bad snap from center
killed the PAT, and John Ral
ston's men clung to a one-point
lead.
Then suddenly, it was all
Clarence Davis. He ran straight up
the middle time and again for five
or seven yards a clip. When Jones
ran two option plays himself, and
Davis rested, the drive stalled, and
Ayala kicked a 30-yard three
pointer.
The Comeback
With just 3:23 left, things
looked bleak for the visitors.
Lasater made a great catch for a
first down, but Plunkett was then
dropped for a 16 yard loss. In a
third and 26 situation, Plunkett
threw long down field for Vataha
who quickly stole the ball out of
the hands of defender Sandy
Durko, and raced 67-yards to the
Trojan 21.
But that was all Stanford could
do. With fourth and nine on the
19, they were forced to bring in
Horowitz for a long try. He
booted it straight through, and
Stanford fans went crazy. The
game was won, and roses were
everywhere.
But SC took over with :55 left
to play and marched up the field
using sideline pass patterns and
their last time out to stop the
clock. As Jones completed his
final pass to the 17 yard line, time
was called to move the chains and
signal first down. This gave the
Trojans time to get Ayala into the
ball game, set up, and ruin the
evening for Stanford fans.

The delayed signal went up
from the refereee, and half the
crowd exploded. The other group
just sat, unbelieving. No one
moved to go home. Happy Trojan
gans mobbed Ayala while Stan
ford players wandered around
seemingly lost. Some fell to the
ground and wept. They filed
slowly to the dressing room.
Bubba Brown stood on the side
lines as the mob encircled him. He
too finally turned and walked
away. Nothing could be done.
Plunkett sat quietly. "It's the
biggest disappointment of my
life," he said.
"I'm happy for our kids, sad
for theirs," said a somber winning
coach John McKay. "Stanford is
the most emotional team I've ever
seen. Also the best we've played."
On the other side, John Ral
ston looked as if he wanted to
cry. "We had victory in our
grasp," he said. "But we just
couldn't shut them off. We gave
Jones too much time to throw on
the last drive, and he killed us. SC
just made the key plays. It's just
one of those things."
But what happens now? How
do you get a team which has just
lost its last two games by a total
of three points and has seen its
chances of playing in the Rose
Bowl severely injured, up for next
week? The opponent is Washing
ton State, the weakest sister in the
Pac-8, and also the team which
tied Stanford last year right after
their traumatic loss to USC. A big
letdown is nearly inevitable.
"They (the team) will come
back," sighed Ralston. "They
better come back. We're not out
of this thing yet."
"We play one more league
game than SC does, so we have
some extra room for catching
up," said the coach.
As of right now, Stanford has a
lot of catching up to do. Those
two points make a big difference.
