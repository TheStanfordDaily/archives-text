Stanford was quiet Saturday
night. The red-hots were all in Los
Angeles.
Traffic was light; fraternities,
dorms and trailers were predom
inantly quiet. Small groups clus
tered in rooms to listen to the
radio, play cards and talk. In hall
ways the usual cacophonous
mixture of stereos prevailed.
There were verbal outbreaks of
elation over Horowitz's long, re
demptive field goal, but many
were cautious in their joy, realiz
ing that this year, anyway, any
thing can happen in Stanford
football. It did.
The voice of Don Klein
("It's ... .it's ... .it's . . .") was

lot in the final roar from the
Coliseum.
The undergraduate library
group was below the normal
Saturday night turnout, and for
the most part The Dedicated were
oblivious to the score continually
posted on the reserve light board
above the loan esk.
Tresidder was nearly empty,
save for the coffee house which
attracted a capacity crowd to hear
a live combo.
A lone guitarist had White
Plaza to himself at halftime, and
was joined by a friend by game's
end. In early morning a few ster
eos were turned higher, and it was
just another weekend night at
Stanford, with fewer people.
