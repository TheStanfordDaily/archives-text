# Missionary Work
## Neuman Quits Stanford 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
In a brief two year tenure as
freshman basketball coach, Paul
Neumann did an outstanding job
and earned the respect and ad
miration of everyone concerned
with Stanford athletics. Paul had
long been active in Christian fel
lowship but he had given no in
dication of his future plans and
accordingly when he announced
in August his resignation to enter
missionary work there were quite
a few surprised people on the
Stanford campus.

But less than two months after
making his decision, Paul is at
tending a bible school in Portland,
where he now makes his home
with his wife and four children.
Paul plans to continue his training
for eight or nine months before he
and his family will depart for
missionary work overseas,
probably in the Philippines.
It was hard for Paul to leave a
sport he loved so deeply, but his
dedication to Christianity finally
overshadowed basketball. Prob
ably a major factor in his decision

were the feelings of his wife
Nancy, who was also active in
church work and who thought it
was time for Paul to leave coach
ing and get to work on his life goal
of missionary life.
Neumann leaves behind him an
impressive basketball career, both
as a player and a coach. A native
of Detroit Michigan,.Paul played
his high school ball in Newport
Beach before coming to Stanford.
He culminated a great Stanford
career in 1959 when he was voted
Northern California Palyer of the
Year and was named to the honor
able mention All-American team.
Paul passed up pro ball for two
years and played AAU ball while
working on his master's degree in
secondary education. But the
temptation of professional basket
ball was too great, any in 1961 he
joined the Syracuse National. Paul
stayed with the team when they
moved to Philadelphia, but he
came west to the San Francisco
Warriors in the trade that send
Wilt Chamberlain to Philadelphia.
From 1965 till 1967, Neumann
teamed with Guy Rodgers to give
the Warriors and outstanding
backcourt combination. Finally
Neumann left the professional
ranks to coach at his alma mater,
where he did a fine job during the
short period he was here at Stan
ford.
Despite his short coaching stay
here at Stanford, Paul takes with
him to his new life the admiration
and best wishes of the entire
Stanford community.

came west to the San Francisco
Warriors in the trade that send
Wilt Chamberlain to Philadelphia.
From 1965 till 1967, Neumann
teamed with Guy Rodgers to give
the Warriors and outstanding
backcourt combination. Finally
Neumann left the professional
ranks to coach at his alma mater,
where he did a fine job during the
short period he was here at Stan
ford.
Despite his short coaching stay
here at Stanford, Paul takes with
him to his new life the admiration
and best wishes of the entire
Stanford community.
In a brief two year tenure as
freshman basketball coach, Paul
Neumann did an outstanding job
and earned the respect and ad
miration of everyone concerned
with Stanford athletics. Paul had
long been active in Christian fel
lowship but he had given no in
dication of his future plans and
accordingly when he announced
in August his resignation to enter
missionary work there were quite
a few surprised people on the
Stanford campus.

But less than two months after
making his decision, Paul is at
tending a bible school in Portland,
where he now makes his home
with his wife and four children.
Paul plans to continue his training
for eight or nine months before he
and his family will depart for
missionary work overseas,
probably in the Philippines.
It was hard for Paul to leave a
sport he loved so deeply, but his
dedication to Christianity finally
overshadowed basketball. Prob
ably a major factor in his decision

were the feelings of his wife
Nancy, who was also active in
church work and who thought it
was time for Paul to leave coach
ing and get to work on his life goal
of missionary life.
Neumann leaves behind him an
impressive basketball career, both
as a player and a coach. A native
of Detroit Michigan,.Paul played
his high school ball in Newport
Beach before coming to Stanford.
He culminated a great Stanford
career in 1959 when he was voted
Northern California Palyer of the
Year and was named to the honor
able mention All-American team.
Paul passed up pro ball for two
years and played AAU ball while
working on his master's degree in
secondary education. But the
temptation of professional basket
ball was too great, any in 1961 he
joined the Syracuse National. Paul
stayed with the team when they
moved to Philadelphia, but he
came west to the San Francisco
Warriors in the trade that send
Wilt Chamberlain to Philadelphia.
From 1965 till 1967, Neumann
