# Cal Nips Tribe In Water Polo Opener
## 
### 
Stanford's water polo team
opened its Pac-8 season on a
losing note Friday as the Califor
nia Bears rallied for a 7-6 victory.
Stanford played possibly its finest
game of the year, but Cal put on a
great display of offensive power in
the second half to gain the win. In
a well played first half, Stanford
jumped out to a 2-1 lead.
The Indians looked as though
they might turn the game into a
rout as they took a 6-2 second
half lead. But then Cal started
picking up momentum as an
enthusiastic crowd of around 200
cheered them on. Despite some
unbelievable saves by Stanford
goalie Peter Uadd, the Bears cut

the lead to 6-5 in the fourth
quarter.
Cal then tied up the game on a
questionable referee's decision
which gave the Bears a second
attempt on a penalty shot, be
cause the referees ruled that Gadd
had come out of the goal on the
first shot.
A rapidly tiring Stanford team,
greatly handicapped by the loss of
leading scorer Rick Massimino
who fouled out, tried to come
back, but Cal finally scored the
winning goal late in the final
period to win, 7-6.
The game was marred by an
expremely high number of fouls
against both teams.
