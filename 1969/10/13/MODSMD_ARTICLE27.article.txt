# USE To Meet Tonight
## Staff Organizes 
### 
In an effort to build an organi
zation broadly representative of
the 7 000 Stanford staff em
ployees, the United Stanford Em
ployees meets tonight at 7:30 in
Bishop Auditorium to adopt the
final articles of its constitution,
and to consider office nomina
tions.
Jim Wolpman, a local attorney,
will speak to the meeting on the
rights of employees to organize.
The United Stanford Em
ployees (USE) was formed by a
number of staff employees who
felt that the university administra
tion would only consider demands

for a wide range of working
conditions improvements and for
employee benefits if confronted
with numerous and organized
complaints.
USE contends that although
the Stanford faculty has one of
the best salary and benefits pro
grams in the country, the staff pro
gram is very poor.
USE's petition to the admini
stration demands the establish
ment of a minimm staff wage of
$450 per month. All those wish
ing copies of the petition should
contact Caroline Ender, extension
5072, C 338 Hospital.
