# University Hospital Tops Abortion Rates
## 
### 
At the rate of roughly 100
operations per month, Stanford
University Hospital is performing
more therapeutic abortions than
any other hospital in the Bay
Area.
The hospital's large staff of
physicians accounts for high
number of abortions, according to
Medical Center News Director
Spyros Andreopoulos. In addition
to the 150 physicians on the
faculty and the 400 community
physicians allied with the hospital,
up to 1000 physicians refer cases.
Hospitals are not required to
report the numbers of abortion
cases to the State Department of
Public Health, but many do so
voluntarily. From these statistics,
most of California's therapeutic
abortions are performed in the
Bay Areaâ€”63% for the first three
quarters of 1968. The Stanford
hospital performs about 14% of
the state's total.
The liberalized 1967 Thera
peutic Abortion Act authorizes
legal abortion in cases of rape or
incest, or when "there is substan
tial risk that continuance of the
pregnany would gravely impair
the physical or mental health of
the mother." Of the 5,056 opera
tions performed during the first
half of 1969, 91% have come
under the mental health section.
Social Responsibility
Andreopoulos indicated last
night that he feels that the cause
of the Bay Area's lead is that
"Physicians here are responding to
a social responsibility."
He said that in smaller areas,
the public still cannotes thera
peutic abortion with a criminal
act thus abortions from these
areas are referred here.
The number of legal abortions
performed at Stanford has risen
from last May's estimate of 80 per
month, to the present monthly
estimate of 100.

Planned Parenthood Inc. and
other agencies in San Francisco
vow they can provide therapeutic
abortions to anyone who wishes
them. Up to June of this year,
only 202 applications were re
jected by hospital committees.
For a woman to obtain an
abortion at the Stanford Universi
ty Hospital, her physician must
refer the case to two other phys
icians or psychiatrists if the ap
plications concerns mental health.
Their recommendations must be
approved unanimously be Stan
ford's four-man committee.
Planned Parenthood estimates
that 100,000 illegal abortions are
performed each year in California
despite the present laws. However,
a medical center spokesman said
she suspects this figure is much
too high.
