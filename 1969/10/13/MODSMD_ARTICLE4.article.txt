# Tourists Still Face Slow Border Traffic

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)-Ameri
can tourists swarmed across the
Mexican border this weekend
after cancellation of Operation
Intercept, the lI.S. government's
crackdown on narcotics smug
gling-
But in many cases the tourists
encountered traffic delays and
continued inspections as they
crossed back into the United
States.
"The problem was that every
one thought we were going back
to normal, and we're not," said a
spokesman for the new Operation
Cooperation, a replacement for
Intercept.
During the three weeks of
Operation Intercept, traffic was

backed up for as long as six hours
as vehicles and travelers were
searched exhaustively before
entering the United States.
Americans who shunned
Mexico during that period lined
up at the border stations Saturday
and Sunday, expected to zoom
right through. Most waited about
an hour, the spokesman said.
The U.S. Customs Intercept
program, which subjected millions
of people to searches for nar
cotics, was cancelled Friday after
U.S. and Mexican officials met in
Washington. Outraged Mexican
businessmen had complained their
tourist business was ruined and
diplomats feared damaged rela
tions between he two countires.
