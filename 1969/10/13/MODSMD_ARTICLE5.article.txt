# History Of Protest Here
## Opposition To War Grows 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
(EDITOR'S INOTE — Because of
Wednesday's Moratorium, we
thought it important to trace
anti-Vietnam War protest as it has
grown on the American College
campus. Below is the first of a
two part story on Stanford pro
test against the war.)
Anti-war protest is Stanford
tradition which unlike many tradi
tions has grown as the years have
passed, rather than deminished.
Stanford's first President David
Starr Jordan was one of the
leading pacifist at the turn of the
century. From then until Wednes
day's Moratorium opposition to
war has grown until the point
where perhaps 80% of the stu
dents are willing to go out on
strike against a war they have seen
as illegal, immoral, and unjust.
For some reason, opposition to
the war in Vietnam has been
centered in the month of October.
From the October 1965 blood
drive to attacks on the induction
center at Oakland in 1967, to last
October's demands by SDS, to the
Moratorium, October has been the
most important month in anti-war
protest here.
One other trend is also present
in the movement here: a clear
split between the radicals and
liberals. Though the definitions of
liberal and radical have changed

dramatically since the first ac
tions, the dicotomy has remained.
Teach-in
"Today 40,000 American
soldiers are fighting in Vietnam,"
reported the Daily on May 17,
1965. On that date, the first
major opposition to the war and
America's then-small commitment
to Vietnam surfaced.
A "teach-in" or all day con
vocation was held at Memorial
Auditorium to inform students
about Vietnam. Its purpose was
seen as educational and not as a
protest. It was exceptionally well
organized and featured well
known authorities like Erik Erik
son and Hans Morgenthal and
debates of an academic nature
concerning the war.

Commentary

On he day of the teach-in, an
ad appeared in the Daily signed by
137 faculty members supporting
the war and its aims. Four years
later, the ad seems incredible—it
would be nearly impossible to
find 137 individuals here who
would publicly express support
for the Vietnam action.
As clearly as this first action
was a "liberal" academic response
to the situation, the Fall 1965
blood raising drive for Vietnamese
civilians injured by American
ground and air actions was a
"radical" action.
Opposition
The Walter Army Society
(composed of Army ROTC
cadets) started a blood drive at
the same time as the Medical Aid
Committee for Vietnam started its
drive.
The Walter Society's goal was
to raise blood for American and
Vietnamese soldiers and Viet
namese civilians. On he first day
of their rival drives, the Walter
Society received pledges for 153
pints, while the Medical commit
tee received pledges for only 37
pints.
The feeling on campus was
further indicated by a poll the
Daily published of 1500 students.
Sixty-three per cent of the stu
dents indicated support for John
son's war policy, while only 26
per cent opposed it. No surprise
was the fact that humanities stu
dents evinced the strongest op
position with a 38 per cent "no
vote."
The ballot was taken by the
Political Union which distributed

ballots around the campus. The
anti-war sentiment expressed was
probably greater than it should
have been, since opponents of the
war probably were more vocifer
ious in their opposition and used
the poll as a means to indicate
their displeasure.
January 31, 1966 saw a spon
taneous rally opposing President
Johnson's resumption of the
bombing on that date. Over 800
people gathered at the Post Office
to protest his action. It was de
scribed at the time as the largest
protest in Stanford history.
A few professors cancelled
classes as a protest of the bombing
resumption and a small student
strike followed in sympathy with
their aims.
Turn About
On April 29, 1966 the campus
awoke to find that David Harris,
activist, academic reformer, and
leader of Stanford's left had been
elected student body president by
a good sized margin. Harris ran on
a platform of academic and social
reform of the University.
In his five months in office
(Harris resigned in February
1967), he sparked a large amount
of controversy and single-handed
ly changed the image of a staid
and conservative Stanford.
Though he moved Stanford by
pushing for liberalized social regu
lations, coed dorms, academic
reform, and increases student
participation in the governace of
the University, he is remembered
by most for his opposition to the
war and his refusal to cooperate

with the Selective Service. With a
few others, he organized the
Resistance who preaches total
non-cooperation with the draft.
His abduction and the shaving
of his long hair by members of the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity
shocked the campus, and brought
a great deal of sympathy for him.
Perhaps much of this shock and
sympathy also turned to Harris's
causes, for the campus became
increasingly disturbed by the war.
"Attack" On Humphrey
Vice-President Hubert
Humphrey's speech on campus on
February 20, 1967, supporting
the war brought a display of anger
and disgust unprecedented until
that date.
Students walked out on his
speech in massive numbers as a
silent protest against the war. As
he left he was jostled by some
students wanting to discuss the
war with him. The UPI incorrectly
reported the next day that he was
attacked by blood thirsty stu
dents.
Two months later, the Spring
Mobilization with the massive
marches in San Francisco
(100,000 people) and New York
(300,000) happened. Stanford
students participated. That April
also saw the beginnings in a major
way of the radical's drive to stop
Stanford's indirect involvement in
the war. After a noon rally at
White Plaza 65 students marched
on the Stanford Research Insti
tute (SRI) a university-owned
research operation which does
