# Troop Pullouts Asked By College Presidents
## 
### 
Public officials are joining in
the growing support for the
national moratorium against the
war.
On Saturday 79 presidents of
colleges and universities sent Presi
dent Nixon a letter urging more
rapid withdrawal of American
troops.
Seventeen U.S. Senators and
46 Congressman have already indi
cated that they will support the
moratorium if it is peaceful. They
have been joined by the governors
of Maine, Rhode Island, and Mass
achusetts, the Boston city council,
and 39 New York state legislators.
Faculty members will be speak
ing in nearly all the University's
eating groups tonight. They will
outline the plans for Wednesday
and answer any questions students
may have. Over 55 professors have
signed up for this duty.
The protest should be peaceful
across most of the nation. Most
observers see only two possible

campuses where trouble can
happen: Berkeley and UCLA.
Trouble Spots
At Berkeley, radical students
have announced plans to parade
througii the town waving Viet
Cong flags and demanding that
the U.S. surrender unconditional
ly to the National Liberation
Front.
The acting chancellor there has
declared that students who miss
classes for the moratorium will be
subject to discipline at the dis
cretion of their instructors.
A regents' meeting and student
faculty convocation are scheduled
for Wednesday at UCLA to dis
cuss the Angela Davis case. The
possibility for violence lays in an
anticipated demonstration at the
regents' meeting.
President Pitzer was not one of
the signers because he was on the
East Coast this week, and did not
receive a copy of the proposed
letter.
However, he told the Daily
that he thought the statement was
"a pretty good one, and I might
well have signed it had I been
here."
He said that he will transmit
copies of statements opposing the
war to the president of Haverford
College, the initiator of the letter.
He expressed a hope that it would
be included in the documentation
sent to the President.
The Stanford President also re
lated that he spent part of
Monday last week in Congress and
Federal executive offices in
Washington talking to people "in
contact with the President. I let
them know my own personal
views and what I consider campus
opinion to be."
Opposition To Moratorium
In an interview published in
Sunday's E x a miner-Chronicle,
two Hoover Institution experts on
Communism opposed the goals of
the moratorium.
Drs. Stephan Possony and
Milorad Drachovitch said that
American withdrawl from Viet
nam "will have tragic and cata
strophic results, politically and
psychologically and encourage
Communists everywhere in he
world.
"If we get out of Asia we will
be defeated—the first real defeat
in American history. Anyone who
has lived in countries which suf
fered defeat knows that defeat is a
cancer that spreads and creates
revolutionary situations that
threaten the stability of the
country defeated. It opens the
way to the rightest and leftest
extremes."
The sentiments expressed seem
to contradict those of many
Americans. Michael Harrington,
an anti-war Democrat was re
cently elected to the House in a
by-election in a district which has
had Republican Congressmen
since the 1870's.
Growing Protest
A poll conducted by a South

Bend television station showed
that in the Third Congressional
district of Indiana which went for
Nixon by a margin of 21,000
votes in the 1968 election, 75 per
cent of the people now favor a
complete withdrawl of all Ameri
can troops by 1970.
On this campus, the morator
ium is expected to the the largest
protest in history.
Twenty congressmen have in
troduced resolutions in both
houses calling for immediate
American withdrawl limited by
consideration or the safety of
American soldiers.
Another resolution has been
introduced into the House which
supports the withdrawals of
American troops so far. Though
supported by over one quarter of
the House members, the reso
lution is advocated by both hawks
and doves, and thus seen as some
what innocuous.
The emphasis nationally has
been on obtaining as broad a base
of people participating as possible.
As one aide at the national
office said, "The most important
thing is not how much, but how
few of the activities we can really
have time to mimeograph. The=
important thing is the variety, the
kinds of people involved."
Suits Filed
A number of suits relating to
the moratorium have been filed
nationally. One in Hawaii and one
in New York City have filed in an
attempt to stop institutional
closures of schools alleging that
they deprive the students of their
right to an education.
Another was filed in Mil
waukee to try and overturn White
water Wisconsin city council de
cision that the students of White
water State college must obtain a
$1 million insurance policy before
they can hold a parade in White
water.
An army private in Boston has
asked a Boston Federal Court to
overturn his superior's decision
refusing him permission to leave
his base to canvass against the
war.
House critics of the war have
obtained the Speaker's tentative
permission to hold an all night
vigil against the war. Speaker
McCormick may reverse his de
cision, but that is considered un
likely since it would break a
House tradition for the Speaker to
refuse members permission to
speak under "special orders" after
legislative business is finished.
Last night, 100 students
marched to the White House in
Washington carrying lighted
candles in support of the Presi
dent's policy in Vietnam.
A number of Senators, includ
ing Minority Leader Hugh Scott,
have scoffed at the idea of the
Moratorium and asked that people
who support the war to turn on
their headlights on Wednesday to
demonstrate their support of the
President.

American withdrawl from Viet
nam "will have tragic and cata
strophic results, politically and
psychologically and encourage
Communists everywhere in he
world.
"If we get out of Asia we will
be defeated—the first real defeat
in American history. Anyone who
has lived in countries which suf
fered defeat knows that defeat is a
cancer that spreads and creates
revolutionary situations that
threaten the stability of the
country defeated. It opens the
way to the rightest and leftest
extremes."
The sentiments expressed seem
to contradict those of many
Americans. Michael Harrington,
an anti-war Democrat was re
cently elected to the House in a
by-election in a district which has
had Republican Congressmen
since the 1870's.
Growing Protest
A poll conducted by a South

Bend television station showed
that in the Third Congressional
district of Indiana which went for
Nixon by a margin of 21,000
votes in the 1968 election, 75 per
cent of the people now favor a
complete withdrawl of all Ameri
can troops by 1970.
On this campus, the morator
ium is expected to the the largest
protest in history.
Twenty congressmen have in
troduced resolutions in both
houses calling for immediate
American withdrawl limited by
consideration or the safety of
American soldiers.
Another resolution has been
introduced into the House which
supports the withdrawals of
American troops so far. Though
supported by over one quarter of
the House members, the reso
lution is advocated by both hawks
and doves, and thus seen as some
what innocuous.
The emphasis nationally has
been on obtaining as broad a base
of people participating as possible.
As one aide at the national
office said, "The most important
thing is not how much, but how
few of the activities we can really
have time to mimeograph. The=
important thing is the variety, the
kinds of people involved."
Suits Filed
A number of suits relating to
the moratorium have been filed
nationally. One in Hawaii and one
in New York City have filed in an
attempt to stop institutional
closures of schools alleging that
they deprive the students of their
right to an education.
Another was filed in Mil
waukee to try and overturn White
water Wisconsin city council de
cision that the students of White
water State college must obtain a
$1 million insurance policy before
they can hold a parade in White
water.
An army private in Boston has
asked a Boston Federal Court to
overturn his superior's decision
refusing him permission to leave
his base to canvass against the
war.
House critics of the war have
obtained the Speaker's tentative
permission to hold an all night
vigil against the war. Speaker
McCormick may reverse his de
cision, but that is considered un
likely since it would break a
House tradition for the Speaker to
refuse members permission to
speak under "special orders" after
legislative business is finished.
Last night, 100 students
marched to the White House in
Washington carrying lighted
candles in support of the Presi

A number of Senators, includ
ing Minority Leader Hugh Scott,
have scoffed at the idea of the
Moratorium and asked that people
who support the war to turn on
their headlights on Wednesday to
demonstrate their support of the
President.

Public officials are joining in
the growing support for the
national moratorium against the
war.
On Saturday 79 presidents of
colleges and universities sent Presi
dent Nixon a letter urging more
rapid withdrawal of American
troops.
Seventeen U.S. Senators and
46 Congressman have already indi
cated that they will support the
moratorium if it is peaceful. They
have been joined by the governors
of Maine, Rhode Island, and Mass
achusetts, the Boston city council,
and 39 New York state legislators.
Faculty members will be speak
ing in nearly all the University's
eating groups tonight. They will
outline the plans for Wednesday
and answer any questions students
may have. Over 55 professors have
signed up for this duty.
The protest should be peaceful
across most of the nation. Most
observers see only two possible

campuses where trouble can
happen: Berkeley and UCLA.
Trouble Spots
At Berkeley, radical students
have announced plans to parade
througii the town waving Viet
Cong flags and demanding that
the U.S. surrender unconditional
ly to the National Liberation
Front.
The acting chancellor there has
declared that students who miss
classes for the moratorium will be
subject to discipline at the dis
cretion of their instructors.
A regents' meeting and student
faculty convocation are scheduled
for Wednesday at UCLA to dis
cuss the Angela Davis case. The
possibility for violence lays in an
anticipated demonstration at the
regents' meeting.
President Pitzer was not one of
the signers because he was on the
East Coast this week, and did not
receive a copy of the proposed
letter.
However, he told the Daily
that he thought the statement was
"a pretty good one, and I might
well have signed it had I been
here."
He said that he will transmit
copies of statements opposing the
war to the president of Haverford
College, the initiator of the letter.
He expressed a hope that it would
be included in the documentation
sent to the President.
The Stanford President also re
lated that he spent part of
Monday last week in Congress and
Federal executive offices in
Washington talking to people "in

overturn his superior's decision
refusing him permission to leave
his base to canvass against the
war.
House critics of the war have
obtained the Speaker's tentative
permission to hold an all night
vigil against the war. Speaker
McCormick may reverse his de
cision, but that is considered un
likely since it would break a
House tradition for the Speaker to
refuse members permission to
speak under "special orders" after
legislative business is finished.
Last night, 100 students
marched to the White House in
Washington carrying lighted
candles in support of the Presi
dent's policy in Vietnam.
A number of Senators, includ
ing Minority Leader Hugh Scott,
have scoffed at the idea of the
Moratorium and asked that people
who support the war to turn on
their headlights on Wednesday to
demonstrate their support of the
President.

Public officials are joining in
the growing support for the
national moratorium against the
war.
On Saturday 79 presidents of
colleges and universities sent Presi
dent Nixon a letter urging more
rapid withdrawal of American
troops.
Seventeen U.S. Senators and
46 Congressman have already indi
cated that they will support the
moratorium if it is peaceful. They
have been joined by the governors
of Maine, Rhode Island, and Mass
achusetts, the Boston city council,
and 39 New York state legislators.
Faculty members will be speak
ing in nearly all the University's
eating groups tonight. They will
outline the plans for Wednesday
and answer any questions students
may have. Over 55 professors have
signed up for this duty.
The protest should be peaceful
across most of the nation. Most
observers see only two possible

campuses where trouble can
happen: Berkeley and UCLA.
Trouble Spots
At Berkeley, radical students
have announced plans to parade
througii the town waving Viet
Cong flags and demanding that
the U.S. surrender unconditional
ly to the National Liberation
Front.
The acting chancellor there has
declared that students who miss
classes for the moratorium will be
subject to discipline at the dis
cretion of their instructors.
A regents' meeting and student
faculty convocation are scheduled
for Wednesday at UCLA to dis
cuss the Angela Davis case. The
possibility for violence lays in an
anticipated demonstration at the
regents' meeting.
President Pitzer was not one of
the signers because he was on the
East Coast this week, and did not
receive a copy of the proposed
letter.
However, he told the Daily
that he thought the statement was
"a pretty good one, and I might
well have signed it had I been
here."
He said that he will transmit
copies of statements opposing the
war to the president of Haverford
College, the initiator of the letter.
He expressed a hope that it would
be included in the documentation
sent to the President.
The Stanford President also re
lated that he spent part of
Monday last week in Congress and
Federal executive offices in
Washington talking to people "in
contact with the President. I let
them know my own personal
views and what I consider campus
opinion to be."
Opposition To Moratorium
In an interview published in
Sunday's E x a miner-Chronicle,
two Hoover Institution experts on
Communism opposed the goals of
the moratorium.
Drs. Stephan Possony and
Milorad Drachovitch said that
American withdrawl from Viet
nam "will have tragic and cata
strophic results, politically and
psychologically and encourage
Communists everywhere in he
world.
"If we get out of Asia we will
be defeated—the first real defeat
in American history. Anyone who
has lived in countries which suf
fered defeat knows that defeat is a
cancer that spreads and creates
revolutionary situations that
threaten the stability of the
country defeated. It opens the
way to the rightest and leftest
extremes."
The sentiments expressed seem
to contradict those of many
Americans. Michael Harrington,
an anti-war Democrat was re
cently elected to the House in a
by-election in a district which has
had Republican Congressmen
since the 1870's.
Growing Protest
A poll conducted by a South

Bend television station showed
that in the Third Congressional
district of Indiana which went for
Nixon by a margin of 21,000
votes in the 1968 election, 75 per
cent of the people now favor a
complete withdrawl of all Ameri
can troops by 1970.
On this campus, the morator
ium is expected to the the largest
protest in history.
Twenty congressmen have in
troduced resolutions in both
houses calling for immediate
American withdrawl limited by
consideration or the safety of
American soldiers.
Another resolution has been
introduced into the House which
supports the withdrawals of
American troops so far. Though
supported by over one quarter of
the House members, the reso
lution is advocated by both hawks
and doves, and thus seen as some
what innocuous.
The emphasis nationally has
been on obtaining as broad a base
of people participating as possible.
As one aide at the national
office said, "The most important
thing is not how much, but how
few of the activities we can really
have time to mimeograph. The=
important thing is the variety, the
kinds of people involved."
Suits Filed
A number of suits relating to
the moratorium have been filed
nationally. One in Hawaii and one
in New York City have filed in an
attempt to stop institutional
closures of schools alleging that
they deprive the students of their
right to an education.
Another was filed in Mil
waukee to try and overturn White
water Wisconsin city council de
cision that the students of White
water State college must obtain a
$1 million insurance policy before
they can hold a parade in White
water.
