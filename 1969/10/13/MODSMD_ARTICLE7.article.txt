# Find Students Liberal, Sincere
## Parents Get Taste Of Stanford 
### SUSAN KRUGER PAUL PAPENEK 
"More than any other college
generation, this one is determined
to make society repair its in
equities and live up to its high
ideals," President Kenneth Pitzer
said Saturday.
Pitzer's remarks were part of
the Parents Day program attended
by more than 1 000 people.
'' Some students and non
students are acting too forcefully,
of course, and this concerns us
all," he noted in the Memorial
Auditorium speech. He said that
the University has defined the
rights of students and faculty to
teach, and to "teach without
intimidation." This remark
brought applause from the audi
ence.
Pitzer went on to describe the
planned October 15 Moratorium
as a challenge "to national, not
University, policy." He stressed
that although there will be no
official Stanford sponsorship, he
believes that the moratorium is
being planned responsibly.
Parents' Reactions
After the speech, several par
ents said that they were satisfied
with the presentation and with
Pitzer. They hoped he would con
tinue with the policies he had
outlined.
One father said he was happy
that University policy would
allow differing views to exist on
campus without clashing.
Later in the morning, six pro
fessors took part in a symposium
entitled, "The University in Tran
sition," which was highlighted by
Prof. William A. Clebsch's remarks
on the dangers of modern tech

nology. He said that universities
and society together must culti
vate "the wit and the will to avoid
a dead-end in humanity's present
course."
He stressed that "Ours is the
first generation of men who must
choose between abundant life for
all men and abysmal suffering for
all men."
The panelists praised freshmen
as more knowledgeable and more
responsible than perhaps any
other generation of Stanford stu
dents.
A panel discussion in the after
noon gave parents a chance to ask
their own questions. Six students

fielded questions on topics from
drug usage to the Vietnam Mor
atorium.
"Should a student expect
financial support from his parents
if he is unwilling to align himself
with his parent's moral stan
dards?" asked one parent.
"I'm trying to imagine who
would ask that question," said
Joyce Kobayashi, a member of
the Council of Presidents. "I'm
confused about the word expect."
Barbara Hyland, another mem
ber of the panel, noted that sever
al parents of Stanford students
involved in last spring's campus
demonstrations cut off their
children financially in an effort to
get them to conform to their
political views. As a result, some
of these students were unable to
return to Stanford in he fall.
"These students suddenly felt
as if they had been owned all their
lives. Using money as a control
shows there's really nothing left —
there's no love, no understand
ing." Miss Hyland's remarks met
with widespread applause.
Roger Boesche, another panel
ist, saw the generation gap as a
product of different sets of ideals.
When students, in accord with
their own system of values, insist
that some policies and institutions
be changed, tension results.
He answered the charge that
radicals, in "doing their own
thing," prevent others from doing
theirs. He pointed out that society
r locks up the criminal and the
insane and enacts restrictive legis
lation, which in effect prevents
others from "doing their own
thing."

Steve Otto, another student
panelist, told the parents, "You
need to see your children as
human beings rather than as
children.
"What you're trying to do is
provide the opportunity for your
son or daughter to make valid
judgments. You have set an ex
ample for them of how to live for
the last 16 years. If you've felt
that's been a valid example, a true
example—as I've felt my parents
have been—there's going to be no
change.
"If you've set a false example
arfd they see some other exam
ples, I really think that you as
parents have to say, 'Well, they're
human beings; they have a right to
choose."
At odils
When the floor was opened for
questions, parents showed them
selves to be most at odds with the
panel on political issues. There
was vigorous applause when one
man asked, "Is there anyone else
around here that doesn't think the
same as you people?"
But for the most part, few
parents were surprised .by the
panel's liberal views. "It's that
way all over," one couple re
marked. Another father, a Stan
ford alumnus, said he thought
Stanford hadn't changed so very
drastically in 20 years, and that he
saw the challenging attitudes of
students as healthy.
"Too ivory tower," ran anoth
er opinion. "They just don't have
a realistic understanding of how
the economy works in this coun
try. When they begin to take on
responsibility, they'll approach
these problems differently."
