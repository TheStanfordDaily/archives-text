## End The War 
### 
Wednesday's Vietnam Moratorium
actions won't stop the war. No doubt
Nixon will do all he can to ignore the
placards and marches. Abrams and Wheeler
aren't going to call off raids or bombings.
If there is to be any hope, we must bring
strong pressure on Washington, stronger
pressure than the petitions and teach-ins of
the past five years. It's sad to realize that a
President pledged to ending the war has
done little more than ask for silence from
the American people. His withdrawals are
negligible; his plans for the future are hazy.
There is now little to look forward to, and
we can wait no longer.
But after all, Nixon is a politician
intelligent enough to sense the nation's
mood, and of that he will see and hear
much on Wednesday. Hopefully in his
highly attuned political wisdom he will act
to end America's part in the sordid slaugh
tering in Vietnam.
As the Moratorium effort turns into the
perhaps the largest protest activity in
United States history, we are heartened to
see many faculty join students once again.
The anti-war movement will gain from their
prestige and wisdom, especially if they do
not flock back to their library research
after Oct. 15. The war will not end in one
day, and their continued support is es
sential if the blight currently on American
society is to be wiped out.
There are jobs for everyone on Wednes
day. from carpool drivers to neighborhood

canvassers to picketing in the Industrial
Park with SDS. One day hard at work is
nothing to ask if it can help lead to peace.
The Moratorium will be a huge effort
pointed directly at the war, but keep in
mind that the war itself is a festering
symptom of many other diseases within
our society: institutional racism, economic
inequality, and the global ambitions of
American business. The focus must in
creasingly in the future be centered on
these internal preblems, with the local
emphasis on Stanford's role in perpetuating
such a system.
The following passage was written in the
middle of World War 11, and it makes as
much sense now as it did then:
"We have been silent witnesses of evil
deeds; we have been drenched by many
storms; we have learnt the arts of equivoca
tion and pretence; experience has made us
suspicious of others and kept us from being
truthful and open; intolerable conflicts
have worn us down and even made us
cynical. Are we still of any use? What we
shall need is not geniuses, or cynics, or
misanthropes, or clever tacticians, but
plain, honest, straightforward men. Will our
inward power of resistance be strong
enough, and our honesty with ourselves
remorseless enough, for us to find our way
back to simplicity and straightforward
ness?"
