# Blacks, Chicanos Discuss Moratorium
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Grandiose, conscience-laden,
and sincere phrases are con
spicuous in the statements made
by many supporters ot Wednes
day's Vietnam Moratorium.
These words are conspicuously
absent in the statements of sup
port for the moratorium issued by
Stanford's Black Student Union
(BSU) and by MECHA, the Mexi
can-American Students' Associ
ation, although Blacks and
Chicanos are more directly al
fected by the war than any other
definable minority groups.
The facts are painfully simple.
More blacks are drafted. The per
centage of casualties suffered by
Black soldiers is far out of propor
tion to the percentage of Blacks in
the service and in the country.
Mexican-Americans have more
casualties, proportionate to their
numbers, than any other group.

"There arc too many Chicanos
in the Armed Services," said Oscai
Martinez, a spokesman for
MECHA. "It's wa> out of propor
tion to our numbers in the popu
lation. Only - ' are in colleges
atid then it's hard lor Chicanos to
stay m college. Only \i r / t get de
grees." Martinez, said.
A study made by Ralph
Guzman, a Mexican-American stu
dent at Merill College of UC Santa
Cruz documents Martinez' state
ment. The study states that:
"Only a relatively small number
of Mexican Americans have been
able to circumvent obligatory
military service by attending
college . . . The reason is the
under-representation of Mexican-
Americans in institutions of
higher learning."
The resolution 111 support of
the Moratorium, which MECHA
passed Sunday, states these facts

simply. The "human tragedy"
they describe needs no rhetoric to
lend sincerity. The facts are
enough.
Black Stand
They are more than enough for
the BSU. The figures showing
more Blacks fighting on the front
lines and more Blacks dying are
cut-und-dried-and they lend a
biting edge to the BSU's support
of the moratorium.
"The number one reason we
are supporting the moratorium is
that we're against the war-just
like everybody else," said Leo
Ba/.ile, chairman of Stanford's
BSU.
"Yeah, being against the war's
fashionable now." he added.
"Sure, we're going to canvass in
East Palo Alto.
"We're going to get the
brothers over there back in this
country where we need them.

"There are two big issues in
this country right now-Vietnam
and race. When the war's over
there'll only be one issue.
"Maybe Richard Nixon can
ignore hundreds of thousands of
people coming out against this
war, but the Congressmen from
the districts can't." Ba/.ile pointed
out.
The sarcasm flavoring Bazile's
statements, statements tailored
for the Daily, not the Colonist,
seemed to reflect the BSU's stand.
Their position is against a war in
which Blacks suffer far more than
whites, but a stand which is dis
tasteful since it alligns them with
"dewey-eyed liberals," who are in

with a "fashionable cause." An
independent Black students' mor
atorium is a real possibility.

vassing will go to Black neighbor

MECHA will send at least 30
canvassers to Castro City, the
Mexican-American section of
Mountain View. The arguments of
both groups will not have to be
any more complex than the facts.
For both groups, the facts of
the war are far too simple.
For the moment, however, the
BSU is working with the October
15 moratorium.

A study made by Ralph
Guzman, a Mexican-American stu
dent at Merill College of UC Santa
Cruz documents Martinez' state
ment. The study states that:
"Only a relatively small number
of Mexican Americans have been
able to circumvent obligatory
military service by attending
college . . . The reason is the
under-representation of Mexican-
Americans in institutions of
higher learning."
The resolution 111 support of
the Moratorium, which MECHA
passed Sunday, states these facts

simply. The "human tragedy"
they describe needs no rhetoric to
lend sincerity. The facts are
enough.
Black Stand
They are more than enough for
the BSU. The figures showing
more Blacks fighting on the front
lines and more Blacks dying are
cut-und-dried-and they lend a
biting edge to the BSU's support
of the moratorium.
"The number one reason we
are supporting the moratorium is
that we're against the war-just
like everybody else," said Leo
Ba/.ile, chairman of Stanford's
BSU.
"Yeah, being against the war's
fashionable now." he added.
"Sure, we're going to canvass in
East Palo Alto.
"We're going to get the
brothers over there back in this
country where we need them.

"There are two big issues in
this country right now-Vietnam
and race. When the war's over
there'll only be one issue.
"Maybe Richard Nixon can
ignore hundreds of thousands of
people coming out against this
war, but the Congressmen from
the districts can't." Ba/.ile pointed
out.
The sarcasm flavoring Bazile's
statements, statements tailored
for the Daily, not the Colonist,
seemed to reflect the BSU's stand.
Their position is against a war in
which Blacks suffer far more than
whites, but a stand which is dis
tasteful since it alligns them with
"dewey-eyed liberals," who are in

with a "fashionable cause." An
