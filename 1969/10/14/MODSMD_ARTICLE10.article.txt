## 'SC Irrelevant 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like very much to say a
few things in regards to your
article on the front page of Fri
day's Daily concerning the rally
held Thursday night on Wilbur
lawn for the Stanford-USC game.
I am sure that the 400 or so
people who attended that rally are
no less concerned about the war
in Vietnam than the person who
stayed home to write that article.
I feel that I should be allowed to
attend a rally, and give support to
the members of a team which has
worked very hard to achieve what
they have, without being put
down as being "unconcerned,"
"unaware," and "irrelevent". I
want the war to end very badly
and I've done and am doing what
ever I can to end it, but I think it
is very dangerous to hold your
breath till it does and to assume
that those who don't, don't care.
