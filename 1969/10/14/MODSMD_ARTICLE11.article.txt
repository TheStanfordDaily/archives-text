## Pandora's Box?

Students as never before be
lieve that the policies of nations
and the actions of men must
reflect an awareness that the
means of providing for world
abundance or destruction are at
hand. It is in this spirit that many
students will join other elements
of society on the fifteenth of
October to protest a continuation
of the United States policy regard
ing the Vietnam War.
A review of that policy wou.i
reveal that it has been predicated
on a desire to bring peace and
freedom to the oppressed people
of South Vietnam. A similar re
view of National Liberation Front
and North Vietnam policy would
reveal the same justification.
Some say that both sides are
sincere in their claims. Others
contend that each side is driven
by selfish considerations. Still
others have assigned one or the
other a banner of virtue. But the
outcome of such speculation is
irrevelant to a majority of the
South Vietnamese whose over
riding concern is to be free from
the atrocities of war.
For those of us who oppose a
continuation of present US
policy, whether we be motivated
from idealistic and/or pragmatic
principles, how can we effectively
voice our objection?
The October 15 Moratorium
can provide us with an appropri
ate vehicle to express our dissatis
faction with the war. More im
portantly, it will foster a more
thorough dissemination of facts
regarding US policy, thus facilitat
ing the educational spirit of the
University. However, before we
proceed with the Moratorium, as
pects of it should be seriously
examined: It has been set forth,
the Moratorium will escalate, add
ing one day per month until the

war has ended. What does this
mean? It means that if the war
continues for nine months more,
those participating in an escalating
moratorium will lose 45 school
days—lt means that conflict could
inevitably result between
"strikers" and "non-strikers"—lt
means that the tax payer and
philanthropist will see his "edu
cation dollar" being devaluated,
and react accordingly—And it
means that a viable program for
opposing the war would probably
be relinquished to a relative hand
ful of martyrs and militants.
Taking these things into ac
count, it seems reasonable to as
sume that each participant in the
Moratorium should regulate his
level of activity according to his
own situation, rather than adher
ing to an "iron clad policy of
escalation from fear of losing
face."
Second, generally speaking,
faculty have been opposed to the
war since its inception. It is not
surprising that they would wel
come an opportunity to partici
pate in an activity such as the
Moratorium. But, however desira
ble it may be for them to take
part, they should not ignore their
professional responsibility to
those of their students who may
well despise the war but see little
correlation between the Moratori
um and a termination to the
conflict. Participation in this form
of protest should not be forced
upon those who disagree with it.
October 15 no doubt will be an
historic occasion. A national
moratorium can be both a vehicle
for great good, or, in the months
to come, a mechanism for con
siderable evil.

Second, generally speaking,
faculty have been opposed to the
war since its inception. It is not
surprising that they would wel
come an opportunity to partici
pate in an activity such as the
Moratorium. But, however desira
ble it may be for them to take
part, they should not ignore their
professional responsibility to
those of their students who may
well despise the war but see little
correlation between the Moratori
um and a termination to the
conflict. Participation in this form
of protest should not be forced
upon those who disagree with it.
October 15 no doubt will be an
historic occasion. A national
moratorium can be both a vehicle
for great good, or, in the months
to come, a mechanism for con
siderable evil.

Students as never before be
lieve that the policies of nations
and the actions of men must
reflect an awareness that the
means of providing for world
abundance or destruction are at
hand. It is in this spirit that many
students will join other elements
of society on the fifteenth of
October to protest a continuation
of the United States policy regard
ing the Vietnam War.
A review of that policy wou.i
reveal that it has been predicated
on a desire to bring peace and
freedom to the oppressed people
of South Vietnam. A similar re
view of National Liberation Front
and North Vietnam policy would
reveal the same justification.
Some say that both sides are
sincere in their claims. Others
contend that each side is driven
by selfish considerations. Still
others have assigned one or the
other a banner of virtue. But the
outcome of such speculation is
irrevelant to a majority of the
South Vietnamese whose over
riding concern is to be free from
the atrocities of war.
For those of us who oppose a
continuation of present US
policy, whether we be motivated
from idealistic and/or pragmatic
principles, how can we effectively
voice our objection?
The October 15 Moratorium
can provide us with an appropri
ate vehicle to express our dissatis
faction with the war. More im
portantly, it will foster a more
thorough dissemination of facts
regarding US policy, thus facilitat
ing the educational spirit of the
University. However, before we
proceed with the Moratorium, as
pects of it should be seriously
examined: It has been set forth,
the Moratorium will escalate, add
ing one day per month until the

war has ended. What does this
mean? It means that if the war
continues for nine months more,
those participating in an escalating
moratorium will lose 45 school
days—lt means that conflict could
inevitably result between
"strikers" and "non-strikers"—lt
means that the tax payer and
philanthropist will see his "edu
cation dollar" being devaluated,
and react accordingly—And it
means that a viable program for
opposing the war would probably
be relinquished to a relative hand
ful of martyrs and militants.
Taking these things into ac
count, it seems reasonable to as
sume that each participant in the
Moratorium should regulate his
level of activity according to his
own situation, rather than adher
ing to an "iron clad policy of
escalation from fear of losing
face."
