# Stop The War
## Blame Secondary 
### Henry S. Breitrose 
Several days ago a colleague
who has been active in the Viet
nam Moratorium Committee
asked me to write a letter to the
Daily which would explain my
personal position. I agreed, and
set myself a deadline, and now find
that there is no time left and
nothing very new to say.
The war has created yet
another consensus, this time com
posed of those who feel that it
should end immediately. The op
position to the war embraces
practically every point of view,
although the reasons for opposi
tion vary enormously. At this
point it seems that everything
there is to say is either all too
obvious or all too trite.
The war is unjust, arrogant,
obscene, to the moralists; costly,
unpopular, unwinnable to the
pragmatists. Depending on one's
ideological slant it is everything
from neo-imperialistic repression
of national liberation to an exten
sion of national interest not justi
fiable on a cost-benefits basis.
For the practical idealists, this
kind of adventure ranks extremely
low on the list of re-ordered priori
ties, if it gsts on the list at all. To

some, perhaps the Schlesinger's,
Bundy's, and McNamara's of this
world it is above all a terrible
embarassment. It is Rusk's delu
sionary contact with the cold-war
bogeyman, Hubert Humphrey's
psychedelic, and Lyndon
Johnson's guarantee of meaning
to the '70's what Herbert Hoover
meant to the late '30's and '40's.
Official Rationale
I cannot imagine what it may
have been to those who died while
fighting for whatever official
rationale was current at the time,
but though the official reasons are
subject to change as circumstances
and politics dictate, the fact of
death is not subject to revision.
My personal feelings are, I sup
pose, less than irrelevant. I feel
that the war has been a procession
of bad logic proceeding from in
correct assumptions, but at this
point the issue of blame is second
ary to stopping the war. I hope
that the mass media, which I am
personally and professionally dis
trustful of fa/e correct in their
prediction that October 15 will be
an unprecedented demonstration
of a desire on the part of most
Americans to end the war immedi
ately.
More than that, I hope that my
students and colleagues will see
some sense in rescheduling their
commitments and spending the
day talking with others about the
need to end the war now. A day
off from school or work by itself
doesn't mean very much, but
there is a chance that we may
have some effect on the conduct
of our country by doing some
things in addition to what is nor
mally expected of us, and in
suspending for a day that great
routinizing, narcotizing, stabili
zing, reassuring, American tran
quilizer of "business as usual."
