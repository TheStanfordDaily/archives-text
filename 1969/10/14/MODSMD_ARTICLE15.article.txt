# French Campus Meets Today
## 
### 
The twin spires of St. Gatien
Cathedral rise over Tours on a
clear, crisp morning. Two or three
Stanford students finish the long
climb to the top of the south
tower and look at the viewâ€”the
narrow streets, the Loire river,
and the Stanford-in-France
campus on the river.
They can watch the shop
keepers sweep the sidewalks in
front of their stores. Old women
wearing dark colors and carrying
shopping bags stop to talk with
their favorite bakers on the way
to Les Halles, the market in the
old quarter. They will do their
marketing there, choosing fresh
meat and produce from the open
air counters that were arranged
before dawn.
The students can see a plump
woman riding her bicycle down
one of the streets, with two loaves
of French bread tied onto the
bicycle behind her, sideways.

Monsieur Loyau drives past her in
his small station wagon to deliver
some of the Vouvray wine he
makes. Later in the afternoon, the
same little car will ferry Stanford
students to his cave where they
will learn the fine art of wine
tasting.
Other residents of Stanford-in-
France roam elsewhere in Tours.
Some make a mid-morning stop in
a cafe to sit, drink coffee, and
watch the people go by on the
sidewalk. French people in
another cafe comment on the
height of two tall American boys
as they pass.
The boys enter the patisserie
next door and look carefully at all

the pastries in the window as they
enjoy the smell of freshly-baked
bread. They finally decide on
chocolate eclairs, 1 franc each, for
their snack.
This is Tours, a provincial
French city and the home of
Stanford-in-France. Members of
the Overseas Campuses Board who
have been to France will discuss
the overseas program at the
French campus at 8:30 tonight in
the TMU Large Lounge, and slides
will be shown. Everyone inter
ested is invited to the meeting,
which is the third in a series
marking Overseas Campuses Week.
