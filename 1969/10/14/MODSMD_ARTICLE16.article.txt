# 'Scarce' Economy Attacked By Miller
## 
### 
Too much talk about "our
affluent society" has left people
with the illusion that America can
do everything, a top executive
turned business educator said yes
terday.
"Let's stop talking about an
economy of abundance and
recognize that we live in an
economy of scarcity," Arjay
Miller, former vice chairman of
the board of Ford Motor Co. and
now dean of the Graduate School
of Business, told a luncheon meet
ing of the Comstock Club in
Sacramento.
"People everywhere are de
manding a better life," he said.
"All this talk of affluence has
encouraged high expectations, and
failure to deliver has led to
disillusionment and despair. There
simply are not enough resources
to satisfy all our needs in such
areas as housing, education, and
welfare."
In fact, said Miller, "recogni
tion that we live in our economy
of scarcity would throw into
proper perspective such recurring
questions as the shorter work
week and technological un
employment. As long as so many
recognized needs remain un
satisfied, the overall problem can
be correctly identified as one
requiring more work, not less."
National Goals Needed
He said the nation requires a
mechanism to establish national
goals and priorities since "our
needs outrun our capacity to
produce." Miller, who last year
proposed establishment of a
National Goals Institute before a
joint meeting of economists and

financial executives, said he was
very pleased when last .luly Presi
dent Nixon set up a National
Goals Research Staff within the
executive office.
The starting salaries managers
are paid today is clear evidence of
the scarcity, he said. The average
starting salary for June '69 grad
uates of the School was $13,887,
up 14.2 percent over last year, he
said.
