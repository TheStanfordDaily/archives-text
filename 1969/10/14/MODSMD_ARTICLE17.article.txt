The Institute for the Study of
Human Problems is severing its
ties with Stanford and will be
come incorporated with the
Wright Institute located adjacent
to the University of California at
Berkeley.
Dr. Nevitt Sanford, founder
and director of the Institute, cited
his interest in action-oriented
scholarly programs as a chief mo
tivation for the recent establish
ment of the Wright Institute, of
which he is the scientific director
and founder. In order to assume
his new role he resigned from
Stanford in the late summer of
this year. He said the interdisci
plinary approach to research and
training developed by him and his
colleagues at Stanford is to be
continued at Berkeley.
When the Institute completes
its current project commitments,
it will have rounded out a decade
of unusual social science experi
mentation, research, and appli
cation. Founded in 1961, the In
stitute for the Study of Human
Problems has delved into several
major areas of social concern,
among them the personality de
velopment of college youth; cur
riculum and higher education;
autonomy and feminine role; drug
use; alcohol problems; human ag
gression. The Institute pioneered
in the social problems—oriented
interdisciplinary research that has
been called an urgent national
requirement by two top-level
commissions during this year.
A flood of publications—over
'20 books and several hundreds of
articles and research reports—has
resulted from the Institute's inves
tigations. These publications to
gether with many lectures,
seminars, and consultations by
members of the Institute have left
their mark particularly on the
shape of higher education today.
Many innovations in higher edu
cation since 1962 have been in
debted to the work of the Insti
tute.
