# Biology Curriculum To Undergo Study
## 
### JESSE CEDARBAUM 
As many students know, partic
ularly biology, chemistry and pre
medical majors, The Department
of Biology at Stanford is in the
process of evaluating and re-organ
izing its curriculum. The resulting
confusion has precipitated numer
ous crises in the lives of students
whose academic plans included, at
some point, the taking of a course
entitled "Biology 10".
Word of the upcoming changes
in the biology curriculum leaked
out to a few selected people in the
days immediately preceding reg
istration, and spread via the grape
vine. The rumor thus circulated
was to the effect that students
interested in biology or who at
some time would have to pursue a
series of courses in the subject
should enroll in Bio 10, the basic
course, this quarter, because it
would not be offered again until
the sprint: of 1 971.
Consequently, approximately
700 students registered for Bio
10, and many students who had
planned on taking biology at
some other point in their Stanford
careers were either forced to
change their plans or were left
high and dry.
Meanwhile, the Biology Curric
ulum Committee has been meet
ing, and according to Marty
Cogan, a student member, has
come up with a tentative plan.
All possible efforts will be
made to implement the new core
curriculum beginning in the fall of
1970. New courses will probably
include a choice between the pres
ent 11-12 series in botany and
invertebrate biology, and a new
course in "organismal biology."

However, these proposals are
subject to consideration by a
newly formed Implementation
Committee, whose findings and
recommendations should be re
leased by the time pre-registration
for winter quarter begins. In the
meantime, it is recommended that
whoever is able should take Biol
ogy 10 now. As Dr. Harold
Mooney, Director of Undergrad
uate Studies for the Biology
Department said, "The transition
is bound to be awkward."
