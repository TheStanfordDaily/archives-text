## War Protest Grows 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
(El) I TOR'S NOTE-Because of
tomorrow's Moratorium, we
thought it important to trace
anti-Vietnam war protest as it has
grown on campus. Below is the
second of a two-part story on
Stanford protest against the war.)
Protest against the war was
mainly polite and small in scale
until October 1967. Things sud
denly changed.
October 1967 was the month
of the draft card turn-ins (about
1000 nationally, including about
15 Stanford students) and the
attempts to disrupt the induction
centers so that draftees could not
enter the centers.
Oakland was the scene of the
largest battle in the nation. With
many Stanford students partici
pating, the demonstrators tried to
block the buses carrying draftees
to be inducted. The first day had
been non-violent as Dave Harris
and Joan Baez led a peaceful
blocking of the doors of the cen
ter. The police carried them to
their vans and carted them away.
The rest of the week was vio
lent with the Oakland police ac
tively attacking and beating stu
dents. Several Stanford students
were arrested including one facul
ty member who was charged with
assault with intent to kill. His
weapon: a trash can lid. The
demonstrators gained the upper
hand only on the last day when
they overturned cars and used
similar street tactics.
Realization
With the realization that they
were aiming at too strong a struc
ture which was willing to use
police whenever necessary, the
radicals returned to their April
tactics. They would attack the
university because of the vital role
they felt it played.
As they saw it, the university
(and especially Stanford) supplies
the brain power necessary to
make the "military-industrial
complex" work, which they felt
oppressed people around the
world. If they could stop the
university from supplying the
brain power to guide the complex,
then they could force the nation
to stop its capitalist and racist
actions.
Two weeks after the end of the
Oakland demonstrations, SDS and
Resistance got a chance to apply
the lessons of Oakland when they
attempted to stop the CIA from
conducting interviews on campus.
They weren't particularly effec
tive in stopping the interviews but
the possibilities of on-campus ac
tion became clearer.
The radicals retired from the
scene in a major way until the
next October. The liberals and
moderates took over.
It started with Sen. Eugene
McCarthy's announcement on
November 30: Johnson must be
stopped. Within weeks Stanford
had an active committee pushing
his candidacy for the June 6
primary. In a little over a week of
organization they enlisted 200
students and faculty members to
work for McCarthy.
But they were not alone. In the
fall, an active drive began to put a
new party on the ballot for the
June primary. The Stanford advo
cates of the Peace and Freedom
party saw it as a means to stop
Johnson. Its membership was
mainly liberal and moderate with
some left-wing backing.
With McCarthy's stunning New
Hampshire upset, Peace and Free
dom fell apart. Liberals and
moderates left the party to work
for McCarthy. Many members
who remained became alienated
whena radical leadership began to
â€¢ merge. The radicals wanted the

party as a third force in California
politics to oppose both the Demo
crats and the Republicans. Most
Stanford members saw it differ
ently and switched registration so
that they could support McCarthy
in the Democratic primary.
Kennedy
With Robert Kennedy's en
trance into the race, the campus
became excited. Massive num
bers of students joined the fray to
make sure that a peace candidate
won in California.
Both committees worked hard
to insure that the Lynch slate of
delegates was not elected (the
Lynch slate probably would have
voted for Humphrey, whom most
students felt would merely con
tinue Johnson's war policies.) But
they spent most of their time
fighting each other. The McCarthy
people won the Stanford battle
decisively but lost the war:
Kennedy won the statewide pri
mary handily.
But the next day it was all
over: Kennedy was assasinated
and McCarthy had no chance in
any convention but one dead
locked between Kennedy and
Humphrey. The McCarthy organi
zation reorganized itself as the
Stanford Committee for a New
Democratic Politics, and support
ed anti-war candidates in the local
area. There was almost no
Humphrey organization that fall.
The liberals went into a hiber
nation which lasted until the
Moratorium.
Demands
Last year was definitely the
year of the radicals, after the
liberals' political failure. Their tar
gets: SRI and AEL. A two week
sit-in took place at AEL to em
phasize their two-fold demands:
that war research stop, and that
Stanford control SRI for humane
research. They won one battle; all
classified research would have to
leave the campus. But they lost
two others; SRI would be sold
rather than retained, and their
student body support was sharply
cut by their use of militant tactics
at the SRI demonstrations.
October 15 will see a clear split
of the diverse radical and liberal
movements. The strike is seen as
typically liberal in that it will
attempt to convince large num

bers of Americans (including
President Nixon) of the need to
stop the war by a mass show of
opposition to present policies. It
is a rejection (though only impli
cit) of the assumption that
America is run by an establish
ment (the "military-industrial
complex"): it a'ssumes rather that
this is truly a democracy where
the voice of the people will be
heard by the President and listen
ed to.
The radicals, by working to
stop the University's role in the
war on that day, is saying instead:
"It is not a President of the
United States who is leading us in
this war. It is not his refusal to
listen to the people which is the
cause of the problems in this and
other nations. Rather it is an
establishment that doesn't care
about people which is causing this
war. We must stop this establish
ment at its brain: the university."
