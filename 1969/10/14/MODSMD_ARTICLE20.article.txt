### SUSAN MAAS 
A Student Center, designed to
give students a chance to create
experimental programs suited to
their own needs and interests, is
expected to go into operation
during winter quarter.
The proposal for this center,
the Student Center for Innovation
and Research in Education, will
be reviewed by the University
Fellows next Tuesday.

The University Fellows are
four junior faculty members freed
of departmental responsibilities
for three years and concerned
with developing innovations in
undergraduate education.
If approved as it now stands,
the Center will be a student
initiated and managed operation,
with its long range goal, as stated
in the proposal, "to become a
locus of student-planned academic
experimentation."

The Center, as planned, will
provide several services. It will
grant academic credit to student
initiated courses or projects, and
aid students in finding faculty
sponsors for their projects.
It will try to provide contin
uity for long-term projects, and,
when necessary, will provide
limited funds for student courses
and projects, and shelter these
projects until they become well
established.
The proposal provides that the
Center may give up to 27 units of
credit to any one student, gen
erally on a pass/fail basis. The
courses would be evaluated ac
cording to their stated purpose.
Funds for the Center would
come from the Innovation Grant
given Stanford by the Ford
Foundation.
