# Yugoslav Hails Relations

### 
"The causes of differences be
tween the Yugoslavs and the U.S.
have been international issues"
declared Bogdan Crnobrnja,
Yugoslavian ambassador to the
U.S., in remarks to a small group
in Tresidder Friday.
The ambassador gave a short
background speech emphasizing
that Yugoslav-U.S. relations are
currently quite cordial, after a
shift from the previous state of
U.S. military and economic aid to
the present "partnership."

The Yugoslavs believe that
financial co-operation is "funda
mental" to peaceful political and
social coexistence, according to
Crnobrnja. Economic relations
"will bring more mutual under
standing, interdependence and
friendship," he added
Discussing the present volume
of trade, the ambassador noted
that Yugoslavia exports more
goods to the U.S. than does any
other socialist country.
The Yugoslavs hope for a quick
settlement of the Vietnam war in
a democratic fashion, but

Crnobrnja said "I don't believe
political settlement is possible
with today's Saigon government."
In response to a question on
"economic imperialism,"
Crnobrnja expressed the view that
there will be social unrest until
capital investment is beneficial to
the public. Yugoslavia now
curtails foreign investment by
stipulating that foreign capital can
enter the country only in joint
enterprises on a 49-51 basis, with
the smaller share for the for
eigners.
