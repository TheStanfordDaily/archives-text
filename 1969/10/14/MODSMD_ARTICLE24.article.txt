## Lyman Cites Issues 
### 
"Honesty with ourselves and
with each other is the most impor
tant bridge across the generation
gap," and it works both ways,
Provost Richard W. Lyman said
Friday.

He delivered the principal
address at inauguration cere
monies for Joel P. Smith, former
dean of students, as president of
Denison University.
Lyman said that "telling any
generation that it is uniquely
gifted and virtuous strikes me as a
foolish and morally dubious way
of seeking to gain their confidence
or influence their behavior. As for
what it does for the confidence or
behavior of other generations, the
less said the better."
America, he said, suffers from
an excess of oversimplified formu
las for salvation "From Relevance
to Law-and-Order to Participatory
Democracy, we rush to slogans
and recommend shortcuts that
have but one thing in common:
namely, that they bypass the hard
work and sustained application
necessary to remodel institutions
to fresh purposes."
Sharply criticizing the draft,
Lyman said: "Conscription and
war hit students hard and directly.
College deferments do not greatly
diminish the impact; in some ways
they increase it. The draft makes
of college one huge, all embracing
required course, required not by
the faculty or the registrar, but by
the Selective Service."
