# Radicals Criticize 'Planned' Asia War

"We transformed our hatred
into energy! Hatred into energy!"
ran the theme of a documentary
film on the life of the war
troubled North Vietnamese
people shown at last night's Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
(SDS) meeting.
Nearly 80 people attended a
presentation which focused on
American involvement in Viet
nam. "To say that the Vietnamese
War is a tragic mistake would be a
tragic mistake," said Jim Shoch,
an ex-student now working at the
Pacific Studies Center.
"Vietnam is not a product of
military paranoia," he continued,
but is a "very well planned
policy."
He stressed that "the intro
duction of troops into Vietnam is
the last in a series of policy moves
designed to protect our overseas
investments."
Franz Schurmann, sociology
professor at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley, was the next

to speak. He said that a recent
visit to Hanoi had convinced him
of the foolishness of the American
involvement in Southeast Asia.
The U.S. is no further along
now in Vietnam than it was in
1964, he commented.
Doubts About Nixon
He said he doubted that
"Nixon has an intention of ending
the war. I mean, he wants to win.
The Americans simply have to
keep South Vietnam."
But he added that the strength
of the National Liberation Front
is the South has made military
progress impossible. "The Saigon
government is only a police
force," said Schurmann. "NLF is
the only effective functioning po
litical structure in the South."
For the Wednesday Moratori
um the SDS will concentrate on
the Industrial Park, said Bruce
Pollock, an SDS member who
chaired the meeting. Wednesday's
activities would include passing
out leaflets and picketing SRI
also.
