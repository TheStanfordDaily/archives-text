## Court Moves On Draft Cases 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Supreme Court put the draft law
and state welfare restrictions un
der review Monday as it showed
no sign of narrowing its activities
under Warren E. Burger, the new
chief justice.
The double-dip into controve
rsy means the court will be weigh
ing the rights of atheists and
agnostics and of the poor as it
expands inquiries already charted
under Earl Warren, Burger's prede
cessor.
Twenty-nine appeals, in all,
were set for hearings in the first
round of rulings of the new term.
They run a wide gamut, reaching
the finality of guilty pleas, the
citizenship laws and the power of
the National Labor Relations
Board to order dues checkoffs.
The draft law stands on thin
constitutional ice because it grants
only religious believers the right
to exemption from combat as
conscientious objectors.
Federal Judge Charles E.
Wyzanski Jr., of Boston found
this an invalid discrimination as he

blocked the government's attempt
to jail John Heffron Sisson Jr. a
young Harvard graduate from Lin
coln, Mass.
But federal courts in California
upheld the law in another test
case, that of Los Angeles com
puter engineer Elliott Ashton
Welsh 11. And the high court took
on both cases.
The plunge into the welfare
field involves the attempt by 27
states to set absolute limits on the
amount of assistance any one
family may receive. In Maryland,
where the test case comes from,
the ceiling in the aid to families
with dependent children program
is $250 a month.
Last term, before Warren end
ed a 16-year career as chief jus
tice, the court put on the 1969-70
calendar appeals challenging the
priority draft inductions of Viet
nam war dissenters as well as
several cases involving legal rights
of poor people.
The court's follow-up Monday
indicates that at least for now the
change in the chief justiceship
does not mean the court intends
to weigh fewer cases.
Sisson, a 23-year-old cabinet
maker, claims he conscientiously
opposes the Vietnam war, but not
because of religion. He refused to
submit to induction last year and
was convicted.
Paly Board Suit
J
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--
Three high school students filed
suit in U.S. District Court yester
day to force the Palo Alto school
board to change regulations pro
hibiting school organizations from
engaging in political activity.
David Jacobs, 17, Palo Alto
High School; Claudia Wax, 17,
Cubberly High; and Andrea
Holman, 15, Gunn High, had the
action filed for them by the
American Civil Liberties Union.
They want the court to declare
unconstitutional a school board
rule which states student organi
zations are not permitted to en
gage in political advocacy or acti
vities of a partisan political
nature.
Their petition says they and
several hundred others formed the
Bay Area Student Union to bring
about political, economic and
social changes within the school
system and community.
A hearing was set for Oct. 23
in San Jose before Judge Robert

Peckham on their request for a
preliminary injunction.
Chicago Violence
CHICAGO (AP)-The federal
government is investigating the
four days of demonstrations and
violence-marked parades and
rallies sponsored last week by
Weatherman, a militant wing of
Students for a Democratic
Society.
A spokesman for the U.S. at
torney for the Northern District
of Illinois said Monday that FBI
agents and Justice Department of
ficials were in Chicago last week
and they are questioning witnesses
to the incidents.
There is a possibility that the
federal government may prosecute
some of the demonstration parti
cipants under the federal antiriot
law.
The Cook County state's attor
ney's office is also attempting to
determine whether a grand jury
should study last week's episodes
in which more than 150 persons
were arrested and 50 were injured.
Conspiracy Trial
CHICAGO (AP)-A prose
cution witness testified yesterday
that he twice arrested Thomas E.
Hayden during 1968 demonstra
tions and that both times other
defendants attempted to interfere
with the arrests.
Hayden, 30, and seven other
persons are on trial in U.S. Dis
trict Court on charges of conspir
ing to incite violence during last
year's Democratic National Con
vention.
The witness, detective Frank
Riggio, said that on Aug. 25 a
crowd in Lincoln Park prevented
him and his partner from arresting
Hayden and another man for al
legedly letting the air out of a tire
on Riggio's squad car.
Later in the week, Riggio told
the court, he heard another defen
dant, Abbot Abbie Hoffman, 31,
urge a crowd of demonstrators to
"kidnap" James Rochford, depu
ty superintendent of police.
At the time, Riggio said,
Rochford was in Grant Park
across the street from the Conrad
Hilton and surrounded by demon
strators.
Rockford was led out of the
crowd by a group of policemen,
the witness said.

to exemption from combat as
conscientious objectors.
Federal Judge Charles E.
Wyzanski Jr., of Boston found
this an invalid discrimination as he

blocked the government's attempt
to jail John Heffron Sisson Jr. a
young Harvard graduate from Lin
coln, Mass.
But federal courts in California
upheld the law in another test
case, that of Los Angeles com
puter engineer Elliott Ashton
Welsh 11. And the high court took
on both cases.
The plunge into the welfare
field involves the attempt by 27
states to set absolute limits on the
amount of assistance any one
family may receive. In Maryland,
where the test case comes from,
the ceiling in the aid to families
with dependent children program
is $250 a month.
Last term, before Warren end
ed a 16-year career as chief jus
tice, the court put on the 1969-70
calendar appeals challenging the
priority draft inductions of Viet
nam war dissenters as well as
several cases involving legal rights
of poor people.
The court's follow-up Monday
indicates that at least for now the
change in the chief justiceship
does not mean the court intends
to weigh fewer cases.
Sisson, a 23-year-old cabinet
maker, claims he conscientiously
opposes the Vietnam war, but not
because of religion. He refused to
submit to induction last year and
was convicted.
Paly Board Suit
J
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--
Three high school students filed
suit in U.S. District Court yester
day to force the Palo Alto school
board to change regulations pro
hibiting school organizations from
engaging in political activity.
David Jacobs, 17, Palo Alto
High School; Claudia Wax, 17,
Cubberly High; and Andrea
Holman, 15, Gunn High, had the
action filed for them by the
American Civil Liberties Union.
They want the court to declare
unconstitutional a school board
rule which states student organi
zations are not permitted to en
gage in political advocacy or acti
vities of a partisan political
nature.
Their petition says they and
several hundred others formed the
Bay Area Student Union to bring
about political, economic and
social changes within the school
system and community.
A hearing was set for Oct. 23
in San Jose before Judge Robert

Peckham on their request for a
preliminary injunction.
Chicago Violence
CHICAGO (AP)-The federal
government is investigating the
four days of demonstrations and
violence-marked parades and
rallies sponsored last week by
Weatherman, a militant wing of
Students for a Democratic
Society.
A spokesman for the U.S. at
torney for the Northern District
of Illinois said Monday that FBI
agents and Justice Department of
ficials were in Chicago last week
and they are questioning witnesses
to the incidents.
There is a possibility that the
federal government may prosecute
some of the demonstration parti
cipants under the federal antiriot
law.
The Cook County state's attor
ney's office is also attempting to
determine whether a grand jury
should study last week's episodes
in which more than 150 persons
were arrested and 50 were injured.
Conspiracy Trial
CHICAGO (AP)-A prose
cution witness testified yesterday
that he twice arrested Thomas E.
Hayden during 1968 demonstra
tions and that both times other
defendants attempted to interfere
with the arrests.
Hayden, 30, and seven other
persons are on trial in U.S. Dis
trict Court on charges of conspir
ing to incite violence during last
year's Democratic National Con
vention.
The witness, detective Frank
Riggio, said that on Aug. 25 a
crowd in Lincoln Park prevented
him and his partner from arresting
Hayden and another man for al
legedly letting the air out of a tire
on Riggio's squad car.
Later in the week, Riggio told
the court, he heard another defen
dant, Abbot Abbie Hoffman, 31,
urge a crowd of demonstrators to
"kidnap" James Rochford, depu
ty superintendent of police.
At the time, Riggio said,
Rochford was in Grant Park
across the street from the Conrad
Hilton and surrounded by demon
strators.
Rockford was led out of the
crowd by a group of policemen,
the witness said.
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Supreme Court put the draft law
and state welfare restrictions un
der review Monday as it showed
no sign of narrowing its activities
under Warren E. Burger, the new
chief justice.
The double-dip into controve
rsy means the court will be weigh
ing the rights of atheists and
agnostics and of the poor as it
expands inquiries already charted
under Earl Warren, Burger's prede
cessor.
Twenty-nine appeals, in all,
were set for hearings in the first
round of rulings of the new term.
They run a wide gamut, reaching
the finality of guilty pleas, the
citizenship laws and the power of
the National Labor Relations
Board to order dues checkoffs.
The draft law stands on thin
constitutional ice because it grants
only religious believers the right
to exemption from combat as
conscientious objectors.

Paly Board Suit
J
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--
Three high school students filed
suit in U.S. District Court yester
day to force the Palo Alto school
board to change regulations pro
hibiting school organizations from
engaging in political activity.
David Jacobs, 17, Palo Alto
High School; Claudia Wax, 17,
Cubberly High; and Andrea
Holman, 15, Gunn High, had the
action filed for them by the
American Civil Liberties Union.
They want the court to declare
unconstitutional a school board
rule which states student organi
zations are not permitted to en
gage in political advocacy or acti
vities of a partisan political
nature.
Their petition says they and
several hundred others formed the
Bay Area Student Union to bring
about political, economic and
social changes within the school
system and community.
A hearing was set for Oct. 23
in San Jose before Judge Robert

Peckham on their request for a
preliminary injunction.
Chicago Violence
CHICAGO (AP)-The federal
government is investigating the
four days of demonstrations and
violence-marked parades and
rallies sponsored last week by
Weatherman, a militant wing of
Students for a Democratic
Society.
A spokesman for the U.S. at
torney for the Northern District
of Illinois said Monday that FBI
agents and Justice Department of
ficials were in Chicago last week
and they are questioning witnesses
to the incidents.
There is a possibility that the
federal government may prosecute
some of the demonstration parti
cipants under the federal antiriot
law.
The Cook County state's attor
ney's office is also attempting to
determine whether a grand jury
should study last week's episodes
in which more than 150 persons
were arrested and 50 were injured.
Conspiracy Trial
CHICAGO (AP)-A prose
cution witness testified yesterday
that he twice arrested Thomas E.
Hayden during 1968 demonstra
tions and that both times other
defendants attempted to interfere
with the arrests.
Hayden, 30, and seven other
persons are on trial in U.S. Dis
trict Court on charges of conspir
ing to incite violence during last
year's Democratic National Con
vention.
The witness, detective Frank
Riggio, said that on Aug. 25 a
crowd in Lincoln Park prevented
him and his partner from arresting
Hayden and another man for al
legedly letting the air out of a tire
on Riggio's squad car.
Later in the week, Riggio told
the court, he heard another defen
dant, Abbot Abbie Hoffman, 31,
urge a crowd of demonstrators to
"kidnap" James Rochford, depu
ty superintendent of police.
At the time, Riggio said,
Rochford was in Grant Park
across the street from the Conrad
Hilton and surrounded by demon
strators.
Rockford was led out of the
crowd by a group of policemen,
the witness said.
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Supreme Court put the draft law
and state welfare restrictions un
der review Monday as it showed
no sign of narrowing its activities
under Warren E. Burger, the new
chief justice.
The double-dip into controve
rsy means the court will be weigh
ing the rights of atheists and
agnostics and of the poor as it
expands inquiries already charted
under Earl Warren, Burger's prede
cessor.
Twenty-nine appeals, in all,
were set for hearings in the first
round of rulings of the new term.
They run a wide gamut, reaching
the finality of guilty pleas, the
citizenship laws and the power of
the National Labor Relations
Board to order dues checkoffs.
The draft law stands on thin
constitutional ice because it grants
only religious believers the right
to exemption from combat as
conscientious objectors.
Federal Judge Charles E.
Wyzanski Jr., of Boston found
this an invalid discrimination as he

blocked the government's attempt
to jail John Heffron Sisson Jr. a
young Harvard graduate from Lin
coln, Mass.
But federal courts in California
upheld the law in another test
case, that of Los Angeles com
puter engineer Elliott Ashton
Welsh 11. And the high court took
on both cases.
The plunge into the welfare
field involves the attempt by 27
states to set absolute limits on the
amount of assistance any one
family may receive. In Maryland,
where the test case comes from,
the ceiling in the aid to families
with dependent children program
is $250 a month.
