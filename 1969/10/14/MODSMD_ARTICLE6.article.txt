Press Conference
"Withdraw the troops now,"
was the predominant theme at a
San Francisco press conference
held yesterday morning regarding
Wednesday's plans. Moratorium
leaders from all over the bay area
explained the purpose of the
Moratorium and described the ac
tivities scheduled for tomorrow.
"The Moratorium is a visible
manifestation of the growing de
sire for peace," said Pat Shea,
ASSU Council of Presidnets. He
warned that "if the war in Viet
nam is not over this year, the
United States is going to fall, and
fall hard—and people like Nixon
are going to be held responsible."
Martin Perl, faculty leader for
the Stanford Moratorium, ex
plained that since successive Con

gresses and Presidents have failed
to get the United States out of
Vietnam, "it has been left up to
the people to do a 'do-it-yourself'
political job." Ho enumerated
Stanford's plans for the Moratori
um.
Next to speak was Dan Siegel,
who was elected student body
president at Berkeley last year but
is not now recognized as such by
the administration. He em
phasized the need to halt "busi
ness as usual" tomorrow. "We are
asking people to work for peace,
to put aside what they normally
do," he said.
Nixon Unconcerned
President Nixon reported yes
terday his statement that he will
not be affected by Wednesday's
moratorium. Most of the nation's
students, and many of the
nation's doctors, lawyers, busi
nessmen, and workers are ex
pected to make Wednesday's pro
test the largest in American his
tory.
Nixon declared that his Viet
nam policy "will not be swayed
by public demonstrations . . .To
allow government policy to be
made in the streets would destroy
the democratic process" and in
vite anarchy.
"We are on the road to peace,"
the Republican President de
clared. "On October 15, I under
stand many will be simply saying
'I am for peace.' I ardently join
with all Americans in working
towards that goal."
Labor Support
The Alliance for Labor Action,
representing about 3 million
workers in three major unions,
announced yesterday its support
of "the peaceful, lawful and non
violent activities" of the Vietnam
moratorium, the Associated Press
reported last night.
The alliance is made up of
three unions which have quit or
have been expelled from the
AFL-CIO. The three unions are
the Teamsters, the United Auto
Workers, and the International
Chemical Workers. The AFL-CIO
has voiced its support for Presi
dent Nixon's current war policies.
In New York City, Mayor John
Lindsay proclaimed Wednesday as
a day of observance, and ordered
all city offices to treat it as a day
of mourning. He directed that all
flags be flown at half mast and
that mourning bunting be placed
on all city office buildings.
The Stanford students going up
to San Francisco on the com
muter trains will participate in
activities there. Scheduled are
picketing of Selective Service, a
rally at the Federal Buidling (site
of the draft card turn-ins two
years ago), and an ecumenical
service at the Congregational
Church at Post and Mason. Dean
of the Chapel B. Davie Napier will
deliver the sermon at the 5:30
p.m. service.
Berkeley
Berkeley activities for the
Moratorium include a peace vigil,
workshops, a march in support of
the National Liberation Front, a
noon rally at Sproul Plaza, and
canvassing. Some observers see a
possibility of violence in the pro
-NLF march.
Stanford probably has the best
organized effort in the West, and
participation by both students
and faculty is expected to equal
that anywhere in he nation.
In Washington, Secretary of
State William P. Rogers said on
Sunday that the Moratorium will
sabatoge only chance of peace in
the next few months. He instead
advocated a policy of silence.
It was also announced in Wash
ington that the President will de
liver a major address to the nation
on November 3. The timing is
considered crucial; election day
being Nov. 4. The announcement
at this early date of a major
Presidential address is almost un
precedented.
Bodi Speaks
In a column in yesterday's Palo
Alto Times, editor Alexander
Bodi expressed misgivings about
the Moratorium, but said that in
his opinion it may possibly fall
within Constitutional free speech
protection.
He said that the moratorium is
not the work of "SDS-radicals,"
but rather "pretty leftish liber
als." He then said that the mora
torium's goal in peace in Vietnam
and that the organizers of the
moratorium would be surprised
by the small number of people
who don't want peace.
An 8 p.m. rally east of Memor

by public demonstrations . . .To
allow government policy to be
made in the streets would destroy
the democratic process" and in
vite anarchy.
"We are on the road to peace,"
the Republican President de
clared. "On October 15, I under

Labor Support
The Alliance for Labor Action,
representing about 3 million
workers in three major unions,
announced yesterday its support
of "the peaceful, lawful and non
violent activities" of the Vietnam
moratorium, the Associated Press
reported last night.
The alliance is made up of
three unions which have quit or
have been expelled from the
AFL-CIO. The three unions are
the Teamsters, the United Auto
Workers, and the International
Chemical Workers. The AFL-CIO
has voiced its support for Presi
dent Nixon's current war policies.
In New York City, Mayor John
Lindsay proclaimed Wednesday as
a day of observance, and ordered
all city offices to treat it as a day
of mourning. He directed that all
flags be flown at half mast and
that mourning bunting be placed
on all city office buildings.
The Stanford students going up
to San Francisco on the com
muter trains will participate in
activities there. Scheduled are
picketing of Selective Service, a
rally at the Federal Buidling (site

p.m. service.
Berkeley
Berkeley activities for the
Moratorium include a peace vigil,
workshops, a march in support of
the National Liberation Front, a
noon rally at Sproul Plaza, and
canvassing. Some observers see a

Stanford probably has the best
organized effort in the West, and
participation by both students
and faculty is expected to equal
that anywhere in he nation.
In Washington, Secretary of
State William P. Rogers said on
Sunday that the Moratorium will
sabatoge only chance of peace in
the next few months. He instead
advocated a policy of silence.
It was also announced in Wash
ington that the President will de
liver a major address to the nation
on November 3. The timing is
considered crucial; election day
being Nov. 4. The announcement
at this early date of a major
Presidential address is almost un
precedented.
Bodi Speaks
In a column in yesterday's Palo
Alto Times, editor Alexander
Bodi expressed misgivings about
the Moratorium, but said that in
his opinion it may possibly fall
within Constitutional free speech
protection.
He said that the moratorium is
not the work of "SDS-radicals,"
but rather "pretty leftish liber
als." He then said that the mora
torium's goal in peace in Vietnam
and that the organizers of the
moratorium would be surprised
by the small number of people
who don't want peace.
An 8 p.m. rally east of Memor
ial Auditorium tonight will kick

fall hard—and people like Nixon
are going to be held responsible."
Martin Perl, faculty leader for
the Stanford Moratorium, ex
plained that since successive Con

um.
Next to speak was Dan Siegel,
who was elected student body
president at Berkeley last year but
is not now recognized as such by
the administration. He em

asking people to work for peace,
to put aside what they normally
do," he said.

Press Conference
"Withdraw the troops now,"
was the predominant theme at a
San Francisco press conference
held yesterday morning regarding
Wednesday's plans. Moratorium
leaders from all over the bay area
explained the purpose of the
Moratorium and described the ac
tivities scheduled for tomorrow.
"The Moratorium is a visible
manifestation of the growing de
sire for peace," said Pat Shea,
ASSU Council of Presidnets. He
warned that "if the war in Viet
nam is not over this year, the
United States is going to fall, and
fall hard—and people like Nixon
are going to be held responsible."
Martin Perl, faculty leader for
the Stanford Moratorium, ex
plained that since successive Con

gresses and Presidents have failed
to get the United States out of
Vietnam, "it has been left up to
the people to do a 'do-it-yourself'
political job." Ho enumerated
Stanford's plans for the Moratori
um.
Next to speak was Dan Siegel,
who was elected student body
president at Berkeley last year but
is not now recognized as such by
the administration. He em
phasized the need to halt "busi
ness as usual" tomorrow. "We are
asking people to work for peace,
to put aside what they normally
do," he said.
Nixon Unconcerned
President Nixon reported yes
terday his statement that he will
not be affected by Wednesday's
moratorium. Most of the nation's
students, and many of the
nation's doctors, lawyers, busi
nessmen, and workers are ex
pected to make Wednesday's pro
test the largest in American his
tory.
Nixon declared that his Viet
nam policy "will not be swayed
by public demonstrations . . .To
allow government policy to be
made in the streets would destroy
the democratic process" and in
vite anarchy.
"We are on the road to peace,"
the Republican President de
clared. "On October 15, I under
stand many will be simply saying
'I am for peace.' I ardently join
with all Americans in working
towards that goal."
Labor Support
The Alliance for Labor Action,
representing about 3 million
workers in three major unions,
announced yesterday its support
of "the peaceful, lawful and non
violent activities" of the Vietnam
moratorium, the Associated Press
reported last night.
The alliance is made up of
three unions which have quit or
have been expelled from the
AFL-CIO. The three unions are
the Teamsters, the United Auto
Workers, and the International
Chemical Workers. The AFL-CIO
has voiced its support for Presi
dent Nixon's current war policies.
In New York City, Mayor John
Lindsay proclaimed Wednesday as
a day of observance, and ordered
all city offices to treat it as a day
of mourning. He directed that all
flags be flown at half mast and
that mourning bunting be placed
on all city office buildings.
The Stanford students going up
to San Francisco on the com
muter trains will participate in
activities there. Scheduled are
picketing of Selective Service, a
rally at the Federal Buidling (site
of the draft card turn-ins two
years ago), and an ecumenical
service at the Congregational
Church at Post and Mason. Dean
of the Chapel B. Davie Napier will
deliver the sermon at the 5:30
p.m. service.
Berkeley
Berkeley activities for the
Moratorium include a peace vigil,
workshops, a march in support of
the National Liberation Front, a
noon rally at Sproul Plaza, and
canvassing. Some observers see a
possibility of violence in the pro
-NLF march.
Stanford probably has the best
organized effort in the West, and
participation by both students
and faculty is expected to equal
that anywhere in he nation.
In Washington, Secretary of
State William P. Rogers said on
Sunday that the Moratorium will
sabatoge only chance of peace in
the next few months. He instead
advocated a policy of silence.
It was also announced in Wash
ington that the President will de
liver a major address to the nation
on November 3. The timing is
considered crucial; election day
being Nov. 4. The announcement
at this early date of a major
Presidential address is almost un
precedented.
Bodi Speaks
In a column in yesterday's Palo
Alto Times, editor Alexander
Bodi expressed misgivings about
the Moratorium, but said that in
his opinion it may possibly fall
within Constitutional free speech
protection.
He said that the moratorium is
not the work of "SDS-radicals,"
but rather "pretty leftish liber
als." He then said that the mora
torium's goal in peace in Vietnam
and that the organizers of the
moratorium would be surprised
by the small number of people
who don't want peace.
An 8 p.m. rally east of Memor
ial Auditorium tonight will kick
off Stanford's moratorium effort.
Speaking at the rally will be B.
Davie Napier, dean of the chapel,
Leo Brazil, of the Black Students
Union, and Felix Gutierrez, of the
dean of students office.
Mimi Farina (Joan Baez's
sister) will provide entertainment.

The Alliance for Labor Action,
representing about 3 million
workers in three major unions,
announced yesterday its support
of "the peaceful, lawful and non
violent activities" of the Vietnam
moratorium, the Associated Press
reported last night.
The alliance is made up of
three unions which have quit or
have been expelled from the
AFL-CIO. The three unions are
the Teamsters, the United Auto
Workers, and the International
Chemical Workers. The AFL-CIO
has voiced its support for Presi
dent Nixon's current war policies.
In New York City, Mayor John
Lindsay proclaimed Wednesday as
a day of observance, and ordered
all city offices to treat it as a day
of mourning. He directed that all
flags be flown at half mast and
that mourning bunting be placed
on all city office buildings.
The Stanford students going up
to San Francisco on the com
muter trains will participate in
activities there. Scheduled are
picketing of Selective Service, a
rally at the Federal Buidling (site
of the draft card turn-ins two
years ago), and an ecumenical
service at the Congregational
Church at Post and Mason. Dean
of the Chapel B. Davie Napier will
deliver the sermon at the 5:30
p.m. service.
Berkeley
Berkeley activities for the
Moratorium include a peace vigil,
workshops, a march in support of
the National Liberation Front, a
noon rally at Sproul Plaza, and
canvassing. Some observers see a
possibility of violence in the pro
-NLF march.
Stanford probably has the best
organized effort in the West, and
participation by both students
and faculty is expected to equal
that anywhere in he nation.
In Washington, Secretary of
State William P. Rogers said on
Sunday that the Moratorium will
sabatoge only chance of peace in
the next few months. He instead
advocated a policy of silence.
It was also announced in Wash
ington that the President will de
liver a major address to the nation
on November 3. The timing is
considered crucial; election day
being Nov. 4. The announcement
at this early date of a major
Presidential address is almost un
precedented.
Bodi Speaks
In a column in yesterday's Palo
Alto Times, editor Alexander
Bodi expressed misgivings about
the Moratorium, but said that in
his opinion it may possibly fall
within Constitutional free speech
protection.
He said that the moratorium is
not the work of "SDS-radicals,"
but rather "pretty leftish liber
als." He then said that the mora
torium's goal in peace in Vietnam
and that the organizers of the
moratorium would be surprised
by the small number of people
who don't want peace.
An 8 p.m. rally east of Memor
ial Auditorium tonight will kick
off Stanford's moratorium effort.
Speaking at the rally will be B.
Davie Napier, dean of the chapel,
Leo Brazil, of the Black Students
Union, and Felix Gutierrez, of the
dean of students office.
Mimi Farina (Joan Baez's
sister) will provide entertainment.
Wednesday's activities will con
sist mainly of leafletting at shop
ping centers and canvassing from
Menlo Park south to Sunnyvale.
Students will also ride trains to
San Francisco to explain their
views about the war to com
muters.
SDS members, while partici
pating in the general activities,
will concentrate their leafletting
activities at the Stanford Indus
trial Park, where many defense
related industries have plants.
They are also planning to pick
et the Stanford Research Institute
to protest its involvement with
the war in Vietnam. Under con
sideration is a plan to conduct
tours of the Industrial Park.
The highlight of Wednesday's
activities will be an evening rally
in the Inner Quad. Reps. Pete
McCloskey and Don Edwards, and
Stanford Novel Prize Laureate
Linus Pauling will discuss the war.
Students at Stanford-in-France
announced plans yesterday to
picket the American Embassy in
Paris to protest the war. The
action is supported by nearly all
the students at the Tours campus.
They will also hold a discussion
with a member of the American
negotiating team in Paris.
Minority Action
Black students will canvass in
East Palo Alto, a predominately
black area, under the auspicies of
the BSU. Chicano students are
planning similar canvassing in the
Mexican-American areas of Moun
tain View.
Many medical school classes
have been cancelled and the stu
dents will participate in a dis
cussion of the implications of the
war for Vietnamese and American
health. The discussion, to be held
at noon, is open to all students.
The medical students are also sign
ing a petition protesting the war
and its effects on health care. The
petition will be delivered to the
AMA and the Surgeon General of
the United States.
Law students, in addition to
general participation, have pre
pared a legal brief opposing the
war.
Press Conference
"Withdraw the troops now,"
was the predominant theme at a
San Francisco press conference
held yesterday morning regarding
Wednesday's plans. Moratorium
leaders from all over the bay area
explained the purpose of the
Moratorium and described the ac
tivities scheduled for tomorrow.
"The Moratorium is a visible
manifestation of the growing de
sire for peace," said Pat Shea,
ASSU Council of Presidnets. He
warned that "if the war in Viet
nam is not over this year, the
United States is going to fall, and
fall hard—and people like Nixon
are going to be held responsible."
Martin Perl, faculty leader for
the Stanford Moratorium, ex
plained that since successive Con

gresses and Presidents have failed
to get the United States out of
Vietnam, "it has been left up to
the people to do a 'do-it-yourself'
political job." Ho enumerated
Stanford's plans for the Moratori
um.
Next to speak was Dan Siegel,
who was elected student body
president at Berkeley last year but
is not now recognized as such by
the administration. He em
phasized the need to halt "busi
ness as usual" tomorrow. "We are
asking people to work for peace,
to put aside what they normally
do," he said.
Nixon Unconcerned
President Nixon reported yes
terday his statement that he will
not be affected by Wednesday's
moratorium. Most of the nation's
students, and many of the
nation's doctors, lawyers, busi
nessmen, and workers are ex
pected to make Wednesday's pro
test the largest in American his
tory.
Nixon declared that his Viet
nam policy "will not be swayed
by public demonstrations . . .To
allow government policy to be
made in the streets would destroy
the democratic process" and in
vite anarchy.
"We are on the road to peace,"
the Republican President de
clared. "On October 15, I under
stand many will be simply saying
'I am for peace.' I ardently join
with all Americans in working
towards that goal."
