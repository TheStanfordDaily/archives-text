# Hold Classes?
## A 						Profs Responsibility 
### Edward Davidson 
| Like most of my fellow Ameri
cans, I find myself very unhappy
jbout the war in Vietnam and the
unfortunate role America has
chosen to play in it: a role which
should have been terminated as a
(result of the 1968 primaries, con
ventions, and elections. Nixon's
nine months of pregnant pause on
the issue have run their course:
the time has come for delivery.
The dishonesty of the adminis
tration with respect to troop with
drawals, peace proposals, free
(elections, etc. evidences that no
delivery will be forthcoming with
out a renewal in force of the
peace movement to refresh Presi
dent Nixon's memory as to the
will of the people, to assure him
athat we are not deceived by
empty phrases, and that we can
jnot any longer be put off.
*
" Much has been said recently of
\the relevance of the university to
'society and of the responsibility
of the researcher for the conse
quences of his research. We have
pledged ourselves as individuals
and as a community to relate the
university to the critical problems
of our society at this very critical
time, to accept the responsibility
for our creations even as they are
applied elsewhere by others, and
to be particularly wary of the
university's increasing financial
dependence on and de facto sup
port of the government and its
policies.
In this context, I find the
recent letters of my colleagues

Prof. Kline and Packer very dis
turbing. In particular, Kline's "If I
were a student I would not attend
class on October 15," and
Packer's "Students are free to
attend class or not, as they see fit.
The faculty . . .has the obligation
to meet their classes," have one
central concept.
Living Conscience
The student is a living being of
conscience; the professor is a de
humanized abstraction with day
to day obligations, but inherently
irresponsible with respect to rank
ing conflicting obligations. Every
action by any individual in our
society has an effect on others
and thereby restricts their free
dom of choice
Thus I retain my right not to
meet my class so to meet an
obligation for that hour which I

consider more serious, just as
Professors Kline and Packer have
reserved that right for the stu
dents, even though they have an
obligation to the government or
some other funding agent who is
paying them or paying for them
to attend class. The cases are
symmetric; each absentee defaults

on an obligation and each makes
it less likely that the others will
meet to discuss the subject of the
class.
However, although I am not
fulfilling my obligation to my
students. I am not voting for
them: they may choose to meet
and discuss the course material
without me and quite indepen
dently they are perfectly free to
protest our Vietnam involvement
or not. I think of myself as a
responsible human being with he
same sorts of conflicting commit
ments as the students and I hope
my students also view me that
way, so that I might be worthy of
their attention when I speak of
social relevance and the social
responsibility of scientists and
technologists. I will not pass this
responsibility to my students to
act for me and I will not cast their
vote for them.

Moratorium Issue

I applaud President Pitzer's de
cision not to cancel classes. That
would be imposing his views on
the community. I would draw a
distinction here between cancel
ling a class and not meeting a class
and I would not support a lockout
of either faculty or students. Fur
ther, 1 accept his charge that "The
University must meet its responsi
bilities" and I hope to assist in
just that on October 15. Sen.
Scott says of the Church speech
"I didn't hear it. No Republican
did . . and President Nixon
says no action on October 15
could influence his policies what
soever. There is a very close paral
lel here with President Johnson's
remarks on the New Hampshire
primary.
The day has passed when we
can simply quietly state our opini
ons. We did at least that in
November and we were pre
empted. Only simultaneous, visi
ble, and continuing action can
force the administration to re
spond to the will of the people.
The day of October 15 has been
set aside by the Moratorium and
by the media for that purpose.
See you are the supermarkets.

Time is running out. What are you doing Wednesday?
| Like most of my fellow Ameri
cans, I find myself very unhappy
jbout the war in Vietnam and the
unfortunate role America has
chosen to play in it: a role which
should have been terminated as a
(result of the 1968 primaries, con
ventions, and elections. Nixon's
nine months of pregnant pause on
the issue have run their course:
the time has come for delivery.
The dishonesty of the adminis
tration with respect to troop with
drawals, peace proposals, free
(elections, etc. evidences that no
delivery will be forthcoming with
out a renewal in force of the
peace movement to refresh Presi
dent Nixon's memory as to the
will of the people, to assure him
athat we are not deceived by
empty phrases, and that we can
jnot any longer be put off.

" Much has been said recently of
\the relevance of the university to
'society and of the responsibility
of the researcher for the conse
quences of his research. We have
pledged ourselves as individuals
and as a community to relate the
university to the critical problems
of our society at this very critical
time, to accept the responsibility
for our creations even as they are
applied elsewhere by others, and
to be particularly wary of the
university's increasing financial
dependence on and de facto sup
port of the government and its
policies.
In this context, I find the
recent letters of my colleagues

Prof. Kline and Packer very dis
turbing. In particular, Kline's "If I
were a student I would not attend
class on October 15," and
Packer's "Students are free to
attend class or not, as they see fit.
The faculty . . .has the obligation
to meet their classes," have one
central concept.
Living Conscience
The student is a living being of
conscience; the professor is a de
humanized abstraction with day
to day obligations, but inherently
irresponsible with respect to rank
ing conflicting obligations. Every
action by any individual in our
society has an effect on others
and thereby restricts their free
dom of choice
Thus I retain my right not to
meet my class so to meet an
obligation for that hour which I

consider more serious, just as
Professors Kline and Packer have
reserved that right for the stu
dents, even though they have an
obligation to the government or
some other funding agent who is
paying them or paying for them
to attend class. The cases are
symmetric; each absentee defaults

on an obligation and each makes
it less likely that the others will
meet to discuss the subject of the
class.
However, although I am not
fulfilling my obligation to my
students. I am not voting for
them: they may choose to meet
and discuss the course material
without me and quite indepen
dently they are perfectly free to
protest our Vietnam involvement
or not. I think of myself as a
responsible human being with he
same sorts of conflicting commit
ments as the students and I hope
my students also view me that
way, so that I might be worthy of
their attention when I speak of
social relevance and the social
responsibility of scientists and
technologists. I will not pass this
responsibility to my students to
act for me and I will not cast their
vote for them.

Moratorium Issue

I applaud President Pitzer's de
cision not to cancel classes. That
would be imposing his views on
the community. I would draw a
distinction here between cancel
ling a class and not meeting a class
and I would not support a lockout
of either faculty or students. Fur
ther, 1 accept his charge that "The
University must meet its responsi
bilities" and I hope to assist in
just that on October 15. Sen.
Scott says of the Church speech
"I didn't hear it. No Republican
did . . and President Nixon
says no action on October 15
could influence his policies what
soever. There is a very close paral
lel here with President Johnson's
remarks on the New Hampshire
primary.
The day has passed when we
can simply quietly state our opini
ons. We did at least that in
November and we were pre
empted. Only simultaneous, visi
ble, and continuing action can
force the administration to re
spond to the will of the people.
The day of October 15 has been
set aside by the Moratorium and
by the media for that purpose.

| Like most of my fellow Ameri
cans, I find myself very unhappy
jbout the war in Vietnam and the
unfortunate role America has
chosen to play in it: a role which
should have been terminated as a
(result of the 1968 primaries, con
ventions, and elections. Nixon's
nine months of pregnant pause on
the issue have run their course:
the time has come for delivery.
The dishonesty of the adminis
tration with respect to troop with
drawals, peace proposals, free
(elections, etc. evidences that no
delivery will be forthcoming with
out a renewal in force of the
peace movement to refresh Presi
dent Nixon's memory as to the
will of the people, to assure him
athat we are not deceived by
empty phrases, and that we can
jnot any longer be put off.

" Much has been said recently of
\the relevance of the university to
'society and of the responsibility
of the researcher for the conse
quences of his research. We have
pledged ourselves as individuals
and as a community to relate the
university to the critical problems
of our society at this very critical
time, to accept the responsibility
for our creations even as they are
applied elsewhere by others, and
to be particularly wary of the
university's increasing financial
dependence on and de facto sup
port of the government and its
policies.
In this context, I find the
recent letters of my colleagues

Prof. Kline and Packer very dis
turbing. In particular, Kline's "If I
were a student I would not attend
class on October 15," and
Packer's "Students are free to
attend class or not, as they see fit.
The faculty . . .has the obligation
to meet their classes," have one
central concept.
Living Conscience
The student is a living being of
conscience; the professor is a de
humanized abstraction with day
to day obligations, but inherently
irresponsible with respect to rank
ing conflicting obligations. Every
action by any individual in our
society has an effect on others
and thereby restricts their free
dom of choice
Thus I retain my right not to
meet my class so to meet an
obligation for that hour which I

consider more serious, just as
Professors Kline and Packer have
reserved that right for the stu
dents, even though they have an
obligation to the government or
some other funding agent who is
paying them or paying for them
to attend class. The cases are
symmetric; each absentee defaults

on an obligation and each makes
it less likely that the others will
meet to discuss the subject of the
class.
However, although I am not
fulfilling my obligation to my
students. I am not voting for
them: they may choose to meet
and discuss the course material
without me and quite indepen
dently they are perfectly free to
protest our Vietnam involvement
or not. I think of myself as a
responsible human being with he
same sorts of conflicting commit
ments as the students and I hope
my students also view me that
way, so that I might be worthy of
their attention when I speak of
social relevance and the social
responsibility of scientists and
technologists. I will not pass this
responsibility to my students to
act for me and I will not cast their
vote for them.

Moratorium Issue

I applaud President Pitzer's de
cision not to cancel classes. That
would be imposing his views on
the community. I would draw a
distinction here between cancel
ling a class and not meeting a class
and I would not support a lockout
of either faculty or students. Fur
ther, 1 accept his charge that "The
University must meet its responsi
bilities" and I hope to assist in
just that on October 15. Sen.
Scott says of the Church speech
"I didn't hear it. No Republican
did . . and President Nixon
says no action on October 15
could influence his policies what
soever. There is a very close paral
lel here with President Johnson's
remarks on the New Hampshire
primary.
The day has passed when we
can simply quietly state our opini
ons. We did at least that in
November and we were pre
empted. Only simultaneous, visi
ble, and continuing action can
force the administration to re
spond to the will of the people.
The day of October 15 has been
set aside by the Moratorium and
by the media for that purpose.
See you are the supermarkets.
