## Walkout Supported 
### 
(The following article was sub
mitted by the Students for a
Democratic Society)
The national and local media
have lately been filled with news
of the October 15 Moratorium.
We should like to make known
our support of the walk-out, while
expressing concern about the mo
tives behind Wednesday's activi
ties. Is the Committee suggesting
that people wrest the power to
alter foreign policy from the for
mal institutions of decision
making in the U.S., or are stu
dents and others being asked
merely to "demonstrate con
cern?" We advocate the former
course.
We understand that decision
making power in this country has
been concentrated in the hands of
a relatively small number of men
controlling major institutions in
the society. Aside from the agen
cies of the state, corporations and
universities have actively partici
pated in and supported the
choices leading to the present
conflict in Vietnam. It was this
belief that led to our attacks on
Stanford and SRI last year, and
which guided the April Third
Movement on campus and in the
streets.

The only way to correct recent
events is for the people of Ameri
ca to take back the power that is
theirs.
The War in Vietnam is no
accident, nor is it an isolated
event in world history. It is the
inevitable product of the march
inations of the American socio
economic system. That system
can be characterized as imperial
ism, the process of extending
capitalist penetration into Third
World markets, natural resources
and labor pools.
Opposition Grows
As dislocations produced by
this capitalist invasion affect

greater numbers of the people in
the Third World, opposition to
U-S. presence grows. Ultimately
insurgent movements develop and
the U.S. responds militarily in
order to "uphold commitments."
It is possible to see this dynamic
in operation in Thailand, Bolivia
and the Middle East. (Presently
there are 50,000 American troops
in Thailand and we are bombing
Laos. We are actually involved in
the War in Southeast Asia.) Be
cause the economic intrusion into
Third World countries is necessary
for the expansion and mainten
ance of the power of the corpor
ate elite in America, we do not
foresee an imminent end to U.S.
counter-insurgent activities.
Thus we see that the moratori
um should be part of a growing
movement in this country to op
pose the corporations and the
government. We believe that it
should be seen as an attempt to
return the power in the U.S. from
the small group of wealthy war
profiteers and corporate leaders to
the broad mass of the people.
Black, brown, yellow and white
groups in this country have been
fighting these bosses for several
years in support of our own liber
ation and that of people around
the world.
Stanford SDS has adopted a
slogan which expresses our analy
sis and our position. We urge all
aroused Americans to join us in
this expression of unity with our
brother and sister in Vietnam in
their struggle against American
imperialism and military adven
turism. Our stand is summarized
as support for the National Liber
ation Front (NLF), the Provisio
nal Revolutionary Government of
South Vietnam (PRO) and other
insurgent movements around the
globe.
Power to the people!
