- President of P&WA started in our engineering department
as an experimental engineer and moved up to his present
position. In fact, the majority of our senior officers all have
one thing in common — degrees in an engineering or
scientific field.
Jl¥To insure CAVU*, we select our engineers and scientists
ff carefully. Motivate them well. Give them the equipment and
j jF \ \ facilities only a leader can provide. Offer them company-paid,
/ jar m m graduate education opportunities. Encourage them to push
\ ft into fields that have not been explored before. Keep them
\\ / £ m t reaching for a little bit more responsibility than they can
V * m manage. Reward them well when they do manage it.
