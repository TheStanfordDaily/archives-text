## 
### ED KOHN 
Anti-Vietnam war protesters across the nation
move into action today in the largest peace
demonstration ever planned in this country.
Citizens will spend the day handing out leaflets,
holding rallies and marches, answering questions
and vocalizing antiwar sentiment.
Leaders of the Moratorium called for a
nonviolent disruption of the ordinary daily
routine. Law enforcement officials have
expressed no outward concern, but some cities
have called extra police to duty to handle
expected traffic problems.
Rallies in support of the Moratorium have
been planned for New York, Boston and
Washington, where 17 senators and 47
congressmen have expressed support for the
protests. The widow of the late Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., Mrs. Coretta King, will lead a
candlelight parade around the White House
tonight.
Student Flans
Students throughout the nation were expected
to stay away from schools for the day. Classes
were cancelled for the day at the University of
Hawaii after a move by the Young Americans for
Freedom to keep the school open failed in
federal court.
A city-wide rally for New York high school
students is scheduled for 1 p.m. in Central Park.

Candlelight protests will also take place at the
University of Alabama, Georgetown University,
the University of Delaware, the University of
Buffalo and Syracuse University.
Students at Fordham University began a
"sleep-in" Tuesday night, and a convocation was
held at North Carolina State University in
Raleigh, N.C. Twenty members of the Jewish
Peace Fellowship marched around the Federal
building in Cincinnati to the sound of traditional
rams horns in protest against the war.
Names of war dead will be read at Trinity
Church at the head of Wall Street in a noon
memorial service. Names also will be read in
Geneso, Oneonta and Rochester, N.Y., in
Denver, and at the University of South Carolina.
Demonstrators at St. Mary's University in Texas
plan a minute of silence to honor the war dead.
And a tree planting ceremony will be featured in
Moratorium ceremonies at York College in New
York City.
House Adjourned
A planned all-night session of the House of
Representatives in support of the Moratorium
was cut short at 11:17 p.m. Tuesday when the
House was forced to adjourn. A majority of the
members failed to show up when a demand was
made that a quorum be present, arid under House
rules, there was nothing left to do but to make a
motion to adjourn. It barely carried, 11 2 to 110.

Two earlier attempts to cut off debate were
averted by large majorities.
Before adjournment was forced, the session
produced ? fr«»-ranging debate over U.S.
involvement in the war. The galleries were nearly
filled throughout the debate by young people.
Rep. Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.), an ex-Marine,
led off the debate with a plea for an immediate
cease-fire. He also said that the U.S. will have to
stop "propping up a dictatorship" in South
Vietnam if it wants to achieve any kind of
settlement with North Vietnam. Jacobs also
called for "a practical pace of withdrawal."
Labor Support
The country's two biggest unions, the
Teamsters and the Auto Workers, joined with the
Chemical Workers Union Sunday and announced
support for the Moratorium. This action, the first
major opposition ever voiced by labor against the
government's war policies, came through the four
million member Alliance for Labor Action
(ALA), which is composed by the three unions
outside the AFL-CIO.
The ALA statement declared, "We call upon
our government to face up to the reality that
there is nothing to be won in Vietnam that is
worth one more drop of American blood. The
only question remaining is not whether v/e will
withdraw our troops, but how or when. We take

our stand with those who are for getting out
quickly and completely."
No Administration Change
President Nixon, meanwhile, continued to
maintain that he will not be swayed by today's
demonstrations. The President told a
Georgetown University sophomore that "there is
nothing new that we can learn from the
demonstrations."
The President added that if he "-allowed his
course to be set by those who demonstrate, he
would betray the trust of the rest."
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, acting with the
President's approval, yesterday urged leaders of
the Moratorium to repudiate an open letter from
Hanoi and to disassociate themselves with the
aims of the North Vietnamese.
INo Repudiation
Agnew termed the Hanoi message a "shocking
intrusion into the affairs of the American people
by an enemy.' He said that leaders of the protest
should clearly repudiate "the support of a
totalitiarian government which has on its hands
the blood of 40,000 Americans."
The Hanoi letter was addressed to "dear
American friends" and was signed by North
Vietnamese Premier Pham Van Dong. "May your
fall offensive succeed solendidly" the letter said
in part.

In a reply to Agnew's charges, the Vietnam
Moratorium Committee said, "Oct. 15 is an
appeal to the conscience of the American people.
It is regrettable that the administration would
seize this straw in an attempt to discredit the
patriotism of those millions of Americans who
sincerely desire peace."
"Peaceful, Somber Day"
In New York City, Mayor John V. Lindsay
asked lor a one day halt on political debate in
the mayorality campaign. Lindsay, -vho is
scheduled to take part in at least four antiwar
protests, called for a "peaceful, somber day"and
declared that "the concept of orderly witness to
the cause of peace is too important to
ignore—even in the heat of a vital race." Hr was
promptly denounced by his opponents.
Lindsay said that some New York schools will
close today, depending upon the number of
students and faculty who plan to absent
themselves. The Board of Education is scheduled
to release the closings this morning.
The Mayor, Senators Eugene McCarthy and
Jacob Javits, and Representative Shirley
( hisholm are scheduled to address a large rally in
Bryant Park during late afternoon, while the day
will end with a candlelight procession to
Rockefeller Center starting at 8 p.m.
