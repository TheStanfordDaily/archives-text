# Extremist Take-over?
## Hoover Political Scholars Challenged 
### Charles Drekmeier 
Readers of yesterday's Examiner learned that the October 15th
Moratorium has caused alarm in the Hoover Institution. According to
that newspaper, it is the opinion of two Hoover political analysts that
the Moratorium sponsors "actually are demanding the United States
strip itself of authority in world affairs and establish domestic rule by
the Far Right or the Far Left." Withdrawal is variously referred to as
"chickening out" or "bugging out." The dire consequences of this
bugging out, according to the experts on international Communism,
are listed as the threat to the stability of the country defeated (the
U.S.) Communist seizures of Asian lands (although the scholars
"dismissed the certain validity of the Dulles 'Domino Theory"), and
pressure on other nations to "seek accommodation with the
Communists."
Apparently the Hoover scholars, Drs. Possony and Drachkovitch,
identify authority with a forceful military position. The more
customary definition of authority would press on us the conclusion
that American authority in world affairs has never been lower (a
Gallup poll several years ago showed that 79% of the Swedes, 76% of
Brazilians, 72% of the French, 81% of the Finns believed that U.S.
should withdraw from Vietnam).
As for the possibility of an extremist take-over, which the
Moratorium "is actually demanding," I believe it can as easily be
argued that such is more apt to be the consequence of the continued
Vietnam involvement, as means of throttling dissent are escalated and
resources withdrawn from efforts to solve desperate domestic social
problems. On this subject we may well ask what indeed threatens the
stability of America. Do we defend our national interest when two
billion tax dollars are diverted every month from schools and cities
and the kind of foreign assistance that could conceivably make
anti-democratic ideologies less appealing.
Unjust Positions
The Hoover analysts are concerned that we shall betray the
confidence of those who have depended on us for protection. But
who actually has depended on us for protection—not to ask that
madness led us to give the impression that America has the resources
to protect the world from revolution? We have constituted ourselves
the major support of military dictatorships and reactionary
quasi-feudal regimes, several of them notoriously corrupt. In Saigon
there are still thousands of political prisoners incarcerated and there is
censorship of the press; it is hard to see how the American presence in
Vietnam can inspire zeal for the fight against dictatorship. If anything,
we have stood by while progressive elements perhaps capable of
establishing a representative government have been muffled and
imprisoned.
It appears that the Hoover scholars view all revolutionary and
national liberation movements as masterminded in Peking and
consequently a menace to American interests. That view seems not to
be shared by those whose confidence we shall destroy by chickening
out. India, which is of particular concern to Dr. Possony, has never
been an enthusiastic supporter of U.S. in Vietnam, Japan finds it to
her economic advantage to "seek accommodation with the
Communists." Where are the troops of those countries, if the Vietnam
struggle is of such significance to them?
LBJ's Policy Remains
Frou years ago today Dr. Drachkovitch wrote an essay for the Daily
which concluded with a defense of the Johnson's administration
policy—which, along with thwarting "the aggressive impulses of the
Chinese Communists," would "create greater possibilities for orderly
and progressive change in the world." The intervening four years have
not been kind to this assessment. Opposition to revolutionary

movements nas alligned us with a status quo we Know to be unjust
and, in the long run, impossible to defend.
This is the record, and we must consider it along with our own
involvements in the Caribbean and Central and South America,
Lebanon and Iran and elsewhere —along with whatever one wishes to
make of a flow of capital on investment account to the poorer nations
amounting to $9 billion in the years 1950-65 while $25 billion profit
capital flowed back to the rich.
Drachkovitch, in his earlier piece, compares the "refusal of many
Americans to face the unpleasant fact that the Chinese Communist
leaders intend ultimately to destroy the United States" with the
willingness to ignore Hitler's pronouncements. It is, however, exactly
this experience of the Hitler years and the memory of the position
this country took in the War Crimes Trials (a commitment more real
than any we ever had to the Saigon Government) that fires many of
those who have organized the Moratorium and other protests against
the war.
Put House In Ordor
We wish to put our own house in order. Our nation has made
refugees of a third of the population of a country, has destroyed the
fabric of its culture, has left between two and three million bomb
craters the size of three floors of the Hoover Tower, has killed six or
seven noncombatants (one of them a child) for every Vietcong killed,
has blasted the dikes and destroyed villages.
It does not seem preposterous to suggest that a half of the one
trillion, three hundred billion dollars we have spent on arms and
armed forces since 1945 would have gone some way toward closing
the gap between the rich and the poor nations. Only by closing the
gap will repressive systems be stopped. We must learn that not all
problems will yield to military efficiency.
There is convincing evidence, from the Pentagon itself, that since
the bombing of the North was halted in November the North
Vietnamese have withdrawn 30,000 troops or more from the
South—and also that, if anything, our operations have been stepped
up. 7000 American troops have died since Nixon took office. The
total tonnage of bombs dropped has actually increased, but the
countryside is less secure than when Dr. Drachkovitch wrote his
article for the Daily.
Stop Present Policy
We fool ourselves if we think Saigon can muster the will to pursue
the struggle. But the problem of political settlement in Vietnam is one
that the people of that country must settle for themselves. The
bloodshed will continue, but the continuation of present policy means
a larger catastrophe for the people of Vietnam. Only withdrawal will
make possible a constructive UN-sponsored effort to rebuild the
shattered country. Damage our authority in the world? When we have
defied the Geneva agreements and weakened our system of alliances,
frustrated the UN and turned from our allies and exposed the world
to the risk of nuclear war. The Hoover "realists" see it all very
differently. But have the "realists" who have so dominated our policy
in recent years ever once been right? And when will they concern
themselves with the damage done to authority within this nation?
Officially it will be "business as usual" at Stanford on Wednesday.
As Howard Zinn remarks, "We listen with the languor of a people who
have never been bombed, who have only been the bombardiers . . .We
have no Hiroshima, no city of the blind and maimed, no professors
haggard from long terms in jail . . Or William James, on another
frightful episode in our history: "Why do we go on? The pride which
always refuses to back down when under fire."
