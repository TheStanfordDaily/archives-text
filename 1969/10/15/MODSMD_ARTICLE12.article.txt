# Kill the War
## A
						Tragic Mess 
### Bernard Haley 
I support the October 15
Moratorium. It has now become
urgent that an aroused public
opinion be brought to bear on
Congress and the President to
impress upon them the necessity
for much more vigorous measures
to liquidate the Vietnam mess
quickly and without regard for
losing face.
The present U.S. policy has no
future. It is essentially one of
drifting—in the hope that North
Vietnam will somehow be
persuaded to make concessions in
the Paris talks. Since this appears
highly unlikely, our second
hope—a long-run one—is that
eventually (Thieu says it will take
years!) the South Vietnamese will
be able and willing to take over
the full burden of the military
operations. Meanwhile our
casualties continue relentlessly
day after day, *to no useful
purpose whatever so far as our
true national interest is
concerned.

The Administration complains
that we have made a reasonable
offer to North Vietnam and they
should be willing to accept it, and
since they are not willing to be
reasonable, it is their fault that
the war is prolonged. But this is
surely nonsense. The North
Vietnamese have no need or
inclination to accept collaboration
with a South Vietnamese
government that is essentially a
creature of the Pentagon. Why
should they? All they have to do
is play a waiting game, and
eventually they'll pick up the
marbles. In any case the Thieu
regime is obdurately opposed to
joining a government in which
communists are participants.
Admirable Conception
President Nixon has said that
there is only one position we have
taken that is nonnegotiable: "the
right of the people of South
Vietnam to determine their own
luture free of outside
interference." This is no doubt an
admirable conception of
Wilsonian vintage. But it always
has been difficult to implement;
and it would be particularly
difficult to do so in the case of
Vietnam even if the North
Vietnamese were willing to go
along. How practical is it to
expect to be able to create a
situation for the mass of ignorant,
politically inexperienced, war-sick
Vietnamese, in which they could
intelligently and without external
pressure make a choice between a
communist dictatorship ar:d a
South Vietnamese military
dictatorship? The way in which
the present South Vietnamese
government was "elected" is
ample evidence of the current
impracticability of
"self-determination."
There are unfortunately still
forces within our government
favoring a renewal of bombing
and a renewed active offensive to
achieve "victory" in Vietnam, or
at least to force the North
Vietnamese to negotiate an
"honorable peace." The President
is undoubtedly confronted with
potential threats of resignations
by the military if he goes to far
with his withdrawals of troops.
These can hardly be expected to
be more than token withdrawals
as long as the Pentagon has its
way. The President apparently
prefers the policy of drifting to
one that would result in a
showdown with the military, in
the hope that, somehow, a
face-saving way out can be found
before growing public impatience
with this impossible war and its
casualties seriously threatens him
politically.
Not Bugging Out
The October 1 5 Moratorium is
to make it clear to him, and to
Congress, that the policy of
drifting is no good. What is called
for today is complete
disengagement from Vietnam. As
Senator Fulbright has said: "We're
not bugging out. We're liquidating
a tragic mistake."
