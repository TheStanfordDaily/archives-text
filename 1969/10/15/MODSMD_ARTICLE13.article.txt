now must be given to stopping the
war in Vietnam before it is too
late, and any future time may be
too late.
If the will of the people
expressed to Congress on October
15th should fail to realize this
priority, efforts must be doubled
in November, tripled in
December, and continued at that
rate until the war is stopped and
all American armed forces are
brought home. Once this
insurance against the imminent
extermination of life is achieved
there should be time for the
solution of all other urgent
problems.

TMU needs YOU
Editor, THE DAILY:
No doubt every Stanford
student is aware that the
programming for Tresidder
Memorial Union (henceforth
TMU)is handled by students.
Therefore, I won't even mention
it.
Lately TMU has been besieged
by people who want to put
togetherr film series.
Unfortunately it hasn't been
besieged by anyone else.
As a result, about three people
put together all art exhibits, all
lecture series, and all concerts.
Those of you who want to meet

assorted VIPs of your own
choosing over steak dinner have
been missing. Those of you who
have a band you'd like to hear or
paintings you'd like to see have
been missing.
It's not too nard to take
advantage of the opportunities:
you leave your name at the
Information desk and show up in
TMU room 269 at 7:30 p.m.
Thursday, October 16.
Hoepfully, most of Union
Board will graduate this year. A
quick rise to power is, therefore,
likely for newcomers. I have very
much enjoyed my job on Program
Division. If you have any
questions, drop by the
information desk some afternoon
and say hello.

No Violence, Please
Editor, THE DAILY:
Pre-moratorium statements
such as Sam Yorty's ("misguided
dupes") and Governor Reagan's
("aiding the 'enemy") will only
serve to polarize the extremist
elements involved in the Vietnam
debate, if further polarization is
indeed possible.
That this might lead to violence
on Moratorium Day—to clashes
between demonstrators or the
waylaying of moratorium
workers—is a distinct possibility.
It might be advisable for everyone

involved to tone down the rash,
opinionated, incendiary
statements.
A repetition of violence can
only lead to further reaction from
hard-core extremists like Reagan
and Yorty, and escalate the
divisions within the society to the
breaking point.
I, for one, feel that an
authentic protest against war
involves, necessarily, nonviolent
means. Otherwise, those of us
who believe that the elimination
of violence is necessary and urgent
are bigger hypocrites than those
who send men to kill and die in a
senseless conflict.

Women s Liberation
Editor, THE DAILY:
Men, mothers brainwashed by
domineering fathers and
husbands, are not responsible for
the enslavement of women; but
Nature caused women to be
unyielding, that the human race
might reproduce itself. Now that
our survival is threatened by
overpopulation, it's time for all
women to liberate themselves
from their natural and instinctual
desire to be dominated by men, so
that they may accept the
responsibilities which come to
women who do not have children.
