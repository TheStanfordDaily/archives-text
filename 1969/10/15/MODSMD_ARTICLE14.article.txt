# No Influence?
## Lessons Not Lost 
### Patrick Ford 
President Nixon hs declared
that "under no circumstances"
will he be "affected" (the
meaning here is presumably
"influenced") by the planned
October 15 Moratorium. His
indifference is not surprising, for
we have become accustomed to
the unresponsiveness of this
administration in both domestic
and foreign affairs. Nevertheless,
it seemed unlikely that the
political lessons of the last
eighteen months would be
entirely lost on the President.
When he inherited a war whose
unpopularity drove his
predecessor from the White
House, we could expect that he
would lose little time in sloughing
that gruesome caricature of
misconceived hostility.
Indeed, his campaign speeches
broadly hinted that he could end
the war as soon as he became
president. America waited
patiently during Mr. Nixon's first
few months for those vaunted but
unparticularized plans to
materialize, but instead of
rejecting the mantle of a
hand-me-down war, he soon
adjusted it to his own shoulders.
He described President Nguyen
Van Thieu as one of the five
greatest political leaders in the
world, and Vietnam as America's
"finest hour," then promptly
called for a moratorium on
criticism of his Vietnam policy.
Thieu's confident expectation
that U.S. troops will remain in his
country for years to come clearly
shows that Nixon has failed to
learn his lessons.
Moratorium
There will be a moratorium, of
course, but a different kind than
Nixon hoped for. For the first
time since escalation of the war

began in 1965, an American
president will have to reckon wilh
a well-organized and powerful
protest by an informed body of
citizens. It has taken many
Americans a long time to wake up
to their responsibility (and this
includes slumberous universities
and professional associations), but
by now most of us have rubbed
the sand out of our eyes. We can
now see that the conduct of this
war has too often been based
either on ignorance or downright
contempt for the facts.
It is otherwise impossible to
understand the February, 1965
escalation of the war: the
government said its action was
designed to bring the Viet Cong to
the conference table, but, in fact,
the press had been reporting
details of United Nations and
North Vietnamese peace
initiatives for several months
before that.
Deleterious Effect
George Orwell says, in his essay
"Politics and the English
Language," that a bad political
climate has a deleterious effect on
language, and his analysis is
particularly relevant to the crisis
in American politics. It is
interesting, for example, to review
the history of official Washington
pronouncements on the nature of
our involvement in Vietnam in
light of its current vigorous
denials of U.S. military escalation
in Thailand and Laos.
Although Nixon the President
has vowed that "under no
circumstances will I be affected
whatever" by the Moratorium's
powerful protest, Nixon the
Candidate had said that a
president "cannot stand aside
from crises; he cannot ignore
division; he cannot simply paper
over disunity." How are we to
reconcile the two positions?
Obviously, it is naive even to
speak of reconciliation, for we are
dealing with politics here, and the
words of the candidate have, to
use Orwell's simile, fallen like soft
snow upon his true intentions.
Nixon, then, intends to ignore
division, and has attempted to
paper over disunity with his own
moratorium plea. The only
question that remains is whether
he shall be allowed to do so. The
answer given by the October 15
Moratorium will be a firm "No!."
