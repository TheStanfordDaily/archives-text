# A 						Dissenting View
## US Responsibilities In Vietnam 
### Milorad Drachkovitch 
The organizers and signers of
the Moratorium call on Vietnam
have every reason to be satisfied
with the publicity successes of
their operation even before it
started: hundreds of names as
signers, scores of clubs and
organizations as supporters,
favorable emotion-building
editorials and articles in the press,
maximal television exposure, and,
lact but not least, a nearly
complete abse'nce of an organized
action on the part of those who
share different views on the issue
of Vietnam, at least on the
campuses.
The Moratorium call however
should not be left unanswered.
The underlying assumption of the
call is that all of the U.S. and
South Vietnamese efforts in the
war were and are immoral and/or
unsuccessful, that the U.S. should
withdraw its troops, the sooner
the better, irrespectively of
further developments, and that
the collective will and wisdom of
an ad hoc group of citizens should
determine the conduct of U.S.
foreign policy and not its
constitutionally elected President.
The basic flaw in the
Moratorium call, at least for this
dissenter, lies in the fact that it
irresponsibly avoids a series of
fundamental problems on whose
solution so much depends both in
the world and at home. The key
issue here is the problem of U.S.
global and domestic
responsibilities which are
inextricably interwoven and
which could be summarized under
three headings: foreign political
responsibilities, moral
responsibilities and domestic
responsibilities.
Three Headings
(1) Having emerged after World
War II as the strongest
non-communist power, the U.S.
has become the architect of a
complex international system of
alliances and other obligations.
Some of the treaties and
obligations, inheritance of another
era, are probably today obsolete
and should be changed. The
"Americanization" of the war in
Vietnam has certainly been one of
the mistakes. However, by the
emphasis on the "Vietnam
ization" of the war and a series of
measures in this sense, the

administration of President Nixon
has indicated that it rejected the
policy of "more of the same," and
is trying to find new approaches
to solve the problem of the
Vietnamese war.
To undercut the President in
his endeavors at this stage is not a
constructive effort. The
impatience of protestors, however
sincere, could only encourage the
enemy to persist in his
intrasigence, while depriving the
President in the perhaps essential
ingredient of time to pursue his
new approach.
Along the same line of
reasoning, a precipitatious U.S.

withdrawal from Vietnam could,
and the present writer believes
would, have the following
catastrophic effects: (a) it would
cause a general shifting of
alliances away from the U.S.,
whose words and commitments
would become not only
meaningless but dangerous; (b) it
would encourage everywhere
"people's revolutionary wars"
because the formula employed in
Vietnam proved to be so
successful; (c) it would foster
extremely dangerous trends
toward the acquisition of nuclear
arms by at least three Asian
powers who would feel directly

threatened (Japan, India, and
Australia).
U.S. Security
(2) Four U.S. presidents have
insisted on the importance of
Vietnam for U.S. security and
have solemnly declared that "we
will stand in Vietnam." The
precipitatious withdrawal from
Vietnam would not only make the
word of U.S. presidents unreliable
but would open the problem of
what would happen to the
millions of South Vietnamese
soldiers, their dependents and
others opposed to the communist
cause, who have believed in the
word of their American ally and
are continuing to fight for their

independence. One may easily
imagine what would be the
destiny of those in South Vietnam
who would be exposed to the
victorious vendetta of a
communist triumph. The
bloodshed would of course not be
shown on television but the
question to those opposed to the
war on moral grounds is how to
put to peace their conscience in
the perspective of such a
holocaust?
(3) The cardinal question
perhaps remains the prospects for
democracy in the United States
should the war in Vietnam be
ignominously lost. If recent
European experiences teach
anything, the worst soil for
democracy is that of a lost war.
Here the question of
responsibility for defeat and the
unavoidable recriminations among
the citizens of a humiliated
super-power could, and one
should probably say would, lead
to much greater internal
disruptions and possible
autoritarian adventures than those
caused by the past and present
dissent over the war.
The failure of past U.S. strategy
in Vietnam must not lead to two
extremes: the simplistic
helplessness of a "get out of
Vietnam" or the endless
escalation of military operations.
There is a third way, brilliantly
argued for, by two exceptionally
qualified men: the foremost
expert on counter-insurgency, Sir
Robert Thompson in his most
recent book No Exit from
Vietnam. and Herman Kahn,
Director of the Hudson Institute,
in his book Can We Win in
Vietnam?
Discussion and dissent are vital
elements in a democratic society
but it is not up to any group of
citizens to try to impose their
views as being the only moral and
politically valid. The conduct of
foreign affairs is the prerogative of
the President under congressional
scrutiny and approval, and the
entire nation has the supreme
authority, at legal intervals, to
formulate its verdict on
presidential and congressional
performance.
