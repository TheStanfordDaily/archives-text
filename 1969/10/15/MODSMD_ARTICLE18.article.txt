# CBW Gases Explained
## 
### JIM SCARFF 
This article is the second in a
weekly series discussing various
aspects of this country's policy on
chemical- biological warfare.
Future articles will discuss
Defoiliants and Herbicides,
Biological Agents, Defense,
centers of research and
development, public attitudes,
and recent National and World
Activities. These columns are
summaries of reports presented
every week in Biology 199 (CBW).
The purpose of the course and
these articles is to educate
ourselves and the community on
this issue.
This article will concern itself
with the gases. I will give a brief
summary of the major agents
stockpiled, delivery systems and
tactics, and defense against the
agents. There are scores of
chemicals which could be used as
weapons, but the U.S. Army has
chosen to stockpile only about a
dozen. Most of the information is
classified and one can only make
intelligent guesses. These agents
can be divided into three
subdivisions—harassing or "riot
control" agents, incapacitating
agents, and lethal agents.
Harassing agents tend to be lethal
only in very high concentrations.
They tend to irritate the eyes, the
inner surfaces of the nose and

upper breathing tubes, the skin,
and the upper reaches of the
alimentary canal. The irritation is
sufficiently severe to be almost
completely incapacitating. Our
stockpiles include three
agents—CN (tear gas), CS ('S'
stands for 'super'), and DM. CN is
the standard tear gas; CS was used
in Berkeley last spring. CN and CS
have effects that wear off after a
few minutes. DM is a more
powerful agent and the effects can
last for three hours.
The second class consists of
incapacitants. The government has
done extensive research on LSD,
STP, and most of the other
psychedelic drugs but does not
now stockpile them. The principle
agent is BZ which causes
"dizziness, hallucination,
drowsiness, and sometimes
maniacal behaviour."
Lethal A Rents
The third group are the lethal
agents. The Army may still
stockpile phosgene which acts as a
blood poison, preventing oxygen
from being carried in the
bloodstream. Phosgene was
responsible for HO % of the
gas-caused deaths in World War I.
The main agents fall into two
series—the G-series and the much
more powerful V-series. Both of
these are anti-cholinesterase
agents, basically short-circuiting

one s nervous system. Sweden has
developed an F-gas which
presumably is very similar to the
V-agents. A two second exposure
to this gas in battlefield
concentrations can kill a man in
one minute. It is colorless,
odorless and nearly impossible to
detect. It is about 2000 times as
toxic as mustard gas if absorbed
through the skin and over 300
times as toxic if breathed.
Current research is directed
along three lines. First, mixtures
are being developed which require
smaller quantities to kill; agents
are being added which hinder
medical treatment, and, finally,
agents are being developed to
increase the ability of the existing
agents to penetrate the skin.
Delivery of Agents
Chemical agents can be
delivered by artillery shells, hand
grenades, cluster bombs, small
rockets, helicopters or low-flying
planes, or tactical rockets such as
the Sargeant. With the new nerve
gases it is practically impossible to
adopt any defense because they
are so fast acting and can
penetrate the skin so easily. There
are no effective alarm systems
which can give more than a few
seconds notice. There are no
practiclc antidotes.
