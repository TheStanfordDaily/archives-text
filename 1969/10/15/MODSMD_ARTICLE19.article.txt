# Other Ways
## Dream The Same 
### Victor Palowino 
There is a war that pits a small
and poor nation against one that
is rich and strong, and that
professes to be on the side of
justice and freedom.
Somehow, against all odds, a
little man once decided to stand
up and fight for his country. A
man who has given dignity to
Vietnam. What made him fight?
What causes a man to become
stronger, stubborn when the
adversary is so powerful? What
leads a poor nation to dare lift its
eyes toward better days when for
so many years looking down
seemed the only way?
Perhaps it is that sometimes,
some men feel there might be
other ways to live. Why, they
wonder, should their destiny be
decided in other lands, in other
places? Why cannot they make
their own road to follow, for
better or for worse? It will be
theirs, only theirs.
In victory, they could then say
they were right! That it was time
for them to wake. In defeat, they
could admit they were not ready;
head down, they can promise
though *hat they will try again,
some other time.
Have Heart
Only then, a nation will haw or
will begin to have a heart, a heart
that pumps its own blood for
itself. A land with hope, and land
with pride.
Only then, a wiser nation '
should lay down its arms and let a !
new country with dignity emerge.
So many years of fighting, so 1
many years of trying. For what? (
Just to kill foreigners? Just to kill f
countrymen? Perhaps to be able f
to say that something new,
different, better is to be born to
walk alone. No strings, no tricks, <
honest ... to walk alone.
It is hard to say that one was !
wrong and that one should have s
been on the ether side. But one j
need not say anything for many
times the faces of men can reveal
what the mouths cannot or will ;
not say.
With awkward movements the <
hands of men can mean |
something. With trembling lips, no I
sounds, no voice, a wiser nation i
could so many more times
stronger announce to the world 1
the birth of a land conceived in I
the minds of some men with <

dreams, wild dreams. To wake, to
look up, to walk alone.
For years into the future, other
men will dream the same. And
when someday, soon perhaps, we
get to see some tears dropping
from the eyes of a giant, it might
be to wash away costly errors so
hard to cure.
