# Stanford Community Mobilizes In Canvass, March, Rallies
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Rallies, marches, speeches, and
canvassing dominate California's
and the Bay Area's participation
in today's Vietnam Moratorium.
Over 2000 Stanford students,
faculty members, and staff are
expected to canvass the
surrounding communities,
attempting to discuss the war with
area citizens.
Plans also call for a march,
organized by the Concerned
Citizens of Palo Alto, at noon in
downtown Palo Alto. The day will
conclude with a rally outside
Memorial Church at 7:30 p.m.
Demonstrations and rallies are
planned for nearly every college
and high school in the Bay Area.
Leaders of the Moratorium have
asked that classes be cancelled or
discussions of the Vietnam war
take place in order to increase
opposition to the war.
University of California
Regents and trustees of the
University of California and
California State College system
have ordered classes to continue
without pause. But some
professors planned to cancel their
classes despite the order.
According to an informal poll
of large classes scheduled to meet
today at Stanford, two out of five
will not meet as scheduled. Half
of these have rescheduled
meetings and the rest have
cancelled without immediate
rescheduling.
The Stanford News Service
survey showed that many
professors planning to meet their
classes supported the objectives of
the Moratorium and planned to
participate in voluntary activities

seeking a prompt end to the war.
None indicated that students
failing to attend would be
penalized.
John Kramer, leader of the
Moratorium activities on campus,
indicated that 2,000 members of
the Stanford community had
indicated definitely that they will
canvass today. He is hoping for
another 1,500 if it doesn't rain.
Staff Supports Moratorium
Even part of the Stanford staff
has indicated support of the
Moratorium. Because staff
members in the university mail
room are observing the
moratorium, inter-departmental
mail will be restricted.
Today's Moratorium activities
in the Stanford area include:
7:00 a.m. —SDS coordinates
leafleting of factories in the
Industrial Park while workers are
going to work.
7:00 a.m.--Stanford group
rides the commuter trains to San
Francisco leafleting and talking to
commuters. Once there, the group
will leaflet and participate in
numerous rallies.
All Day—Canvassing of
neighboring communities by
Stanford students and
others—talking to people and
distributing leaflets.
Approximately 30 shopping
centers will be leafleted.
12:00 noon—Rally at
Cogswell Plaza in Palo Alto,
co-ordinated by the Concerned
Citizens, followed by a march
through downtown Palo Alto.
4:00 p.m. —Paul Taylor Dance
Group will hold a special
performance in Memorial
Auditorium.
4:00 p.m.—Graduate School
of Business discussions—students,
staff, and faculty—on issues
related to the Vietnam conflict.

Benefits of Bugging Out of
Vietnam."
7:30 p.m.—Major torchlight
rally outside of Memorial Church,
featuring speeches by
Congressmen Pete McCloskey
(R-San Mateo) and Don Edwards
(D-San Jose), Stanford Nobel
Laureate Linus Pauling, and
publisher Dr. Carlton Goodlet.
Students interested in
participating in activities who
have not signed up should go to
the Tresidder deck throughout the
day.
The SDS will conduct two
"Red Flag Tours" today of the
Stanford Industrial Park, leaving
from the Tresidder parking lot at
9:45 a.m. and 1:45 p.m.
A group of six or seven
residents of Beta Chi will read the
names of the California war de'ad
and distribute anti-war literature

all day at the San Francisco
International Airport.
The Bechtel International
Center, in conjunction with
members of the International
Association, is sponsoring two
panel discussions concerning the
depth and quality of American
involvement in other countries.
The foreign student panelists
will include representatives of the
Third World, the Middle East,
Latin America, and Europe.
Educational Effort
According to I-Center host,
Halsey Beemer, the panel
discussions will represent an
"educational effort" on the part
of the panelists to tell students
and citizens of the U.S. "what is
going on in other countries."
The panel discussions will be
held at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. in the
International Center.
Black students will canvass in
East Palo Alto, a predominantly
black area, under the auspices of
the BSU. Chicano students are
planning similar canvassing in the
Mexican-American areas of
Mountain View.
Elsewhere in California,
Moratorium activities center
around college campuses and vary
slightly from the standard rallies,
marches, and canvassing.
San Francisco activities will
consist of picketing of the
Selective Service Office at 10:00
a.m., a rally at noon at the
Federal Building, picketing of the
City Hall, and leaflet distribution
and discussion throughout the
day.
Governor Ronald Reagan
criticized the Moratorium and said
that the protestors "Should be
ashamed of themselves. I don't
care how sincere they are in their
motives, they are lending aid to
the enemy and that enemy is
killing young Americans."
Capitol March
Reagan's statements came in
response to a group of students
who started reading a list of war
dead in front of his home on
Monday—Reagan was in
Washington D.C. at the time.
There will be a march on the
Sacramento capitol today,
although Reagan plans to be in
Los Angeles.
About 2,000 small wooden
crosses and four coffins reposed in
the mist on the San Francisco
State Campus today in
preparation for Moratorium Day

activities. Moratorium leaders at
San Francisco State have
responded to President S. I.
Hayakawa's refusal to cancel
classes by saying: "We are not
going to ask the administration to
close the school; we'll close it
ourselves."
In Whittier, where President
Richard Nixon was graduated
from Whittier College in 1934, the
wife of acting President Harold
Case will light a Moratorium flame
on a butane gas torch after
marching downtown with
students.
War Game
A war game in which
participants have been asked to
wear military clothing—but use
toy guns—has been planned at San
Diego State College.

Public workshops, a vigil,
picketing and classroom speaking
are scheduled for the Berkeley
campus today. A noon rally will
be held in the old People's Park
Annex including various speakers
and followed at 2 p.m. by
door-to-door canvassing of the
Berkeley community.
High Schools
Many local high school students
are expected to cut classes today
to participate in Stanford
activities. According to
Moratorium organizer Kramer,
two high schools, Woodside and
Palo Alto, have set aside a couple
of hours in the afternoon for a
discussion of the Moratorium and
the Vietnam War.
