# 'Doomsday: No Bull'
## 
### JOHN COONROD 
The navy, of course, is to be
praised for their innovative work
on the new Doomsday Machine.
With this spare H-bomb button
neatly hidden in the northern
woods of Wisconsin, we ran rest
assured that if everyone but our
agent in Wisconsin is obliterated,
we will still be able to destroy the
Enemy.
Yesterday morning I spoke
with this bovine patriot, who
prefers to be called Heinrich.
"Heinrich, of all the dairy
cattle in Wisconsin, how is it that
you were chosen?"
"It's my credibility," replied
our cow, "as I have put my
defense industry stocks into trust,
the public can have faith that I
will not use our bombs merely to
consume them. I think my record
on such conflict of interest is
pure."
"Uh my yes. Perhaps I played
my largest role during the
Johnson Administration, when I
co-directed the "Guns-and-butter"
program. As a sideline, I've always
produced speech material for
selected congressmen to fling
around.
"A commendable record, we'll
agree. In the final analysis, I
would feel that your position
could cause you to feel a lot of
guilt. How does it feel to know
that you control the lives of
millions of human beings?"
"Oh I don't know," Heinrich
replied with a casual swish of his
tail, "how do you feel about
eating hamburger?"
