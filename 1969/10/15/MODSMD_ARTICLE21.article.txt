# Unworthy Cause
## Chicano Casualties 
### 
(The following article was
written by the Chicano Student
Movement of Aztlan. Today they
will be circulating this text in
Chicano communities around the
Stanford area.)
Because of the alarming
situation which now exists in
Vietnam and especially since the
chicano is oveÂ»-represented in the
armed forces and casualty lists
and at the same time
under-represented in the
universities, we of MECHA
(Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztlan) wholeheartedly
support the October 15th
Moratorium.
Let the facts speak for
themselves. Surveys of the
casualty lists were conducted for
two periods. The first period
covered the time from January
1961 to February 1967 and the
latter period from December 1967
to March 1969. The results
showed that in the Southwest
states where most chicanos reside
(Arizona, California, Colorado,
New Mexico, and Texas) the
death rate for chicanos during the
first period was higher than for
any other group. 19.4% of the
deaths by all causes were suffered
by chicanos, this is extremely high
when compared with the total
Spanish surnamed population in
the southwest which was found to
be 11.8% by the United States
Census Bureau in 1960. During
the second period chicanos
suffered most with the death rate
of 19.0%. This same statistic, if
studied further, would show that
chicanos often choose high risk

duty. For example, during the
first period, 23.3% of all
southwest Marine corps casualties
had distinctive Spanish surnames.
Furthermore, in the state of
California (which shows both the
greatest number of total deaths
from all causes and the greatest
number of Mexican-American
casualties), and Texas reflect the
tragedy even further. Chicano
deaths represented 15.0% and
14.3% of the total deaths of
California servicemen during those
two periods (Chicanos only
comprise 10.0% of California's
total population), in Texas, 22.4%
and 25.2% of the deaths were
suffered by Chicanos, again
exceedingly high when compared
to the Mexican-American
population there.
Yet despite our service to our
country, most chicanos cannot
even hope to receive a higher
education. Less than 1% of the
97,000 students of the University
of California are Chicanos. We feel
we have to prove our loyalty to
become accepted as decent human
beings, yet when our brothers,
sons, and fathers come home from
the war, after having fought
heroically, still are rejected and
confronted with the same
humiliation which our fathers
faced when we set foot on this
land.
In that light, we of MECHA,
support the October 15,
Moratorium because we cannot
bear to see our brothers, fathers,
and sons dying for an unworthy
cause.
VIVA LA RAZA!
