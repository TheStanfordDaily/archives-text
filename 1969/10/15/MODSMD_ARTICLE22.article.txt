# Sequoia Review
## Poetry Evokes Emotion 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Full, occasionally strikingly
rich prose, subtle poetry and a
solid, well-balanced variety of
material combine to make the
latest issue of the Sequoia,
something you should take to a
quiet, far-away corner of campus
to read and enjoy.
Marred only slightly by the
unnecessary inclusion of an
original piece of music (an
interesting but awkward
innovation), the contents of the
magazine, especially John Daniel's
"Winter Tears" and John
Felstiner's translation of Pablo
Neruda's "Expilico Algunas
Cosas," overwhelm you with
emotion in the translation, and
with understated emotion in
"Winter Tears."
The bulk of the magazine's
poetry, almost all concentrated
between the solid book covers of
John Steacy's "Richland Woman"
and "Winter Tears," has a uniform
flavor of subtlety that is pleasing
to a lazy reader. The subtlety of
Bob Yeager's and William Root's
poetry is not derived from
complex imagery; the images are
simple, but their simplicity masks
the emotions in the poems, which
creep up on you only after you
have finished enjoying the images.
This generalization does not
hold true for Neruda's poem,
whose emotionalism is staggering,
nor does it for Wendell Berry's
intricate weavings of imagery in
"The Mad Farmer Revolution,"
but Yeager's and Root's brief
sketches are both easy and
satisfying reading. It is not facile,
yet it does not fall in the trap of
overtaxing the brain with obscure
imagery in an effort to be
esoteric.
It would be easy to go
overboard in descriptions of
Felstiner's translation, "I explain
some things"— easy and
dangerous. Not being able to read
Spanish, I can only guess to what
degree Felstiner has captured
Neruda's emotions. But if there
was a higher intensity of emotions
in the original than in the
translation, it would actually be

difficult to read without being
emotionally overpowered. Even
the images of thy poet's early life
seem to be a superficial mask over
the hatred which breaks open in
the latter half of the poem.
The only piece of really facile
poetry is, unfortunately, the
opening work in the book—Toby
Lurie's "Avalanche." I have never
been very appreciative of the style
of writing which E.E. Cummings
mastered and countless followers
imitated—largely unsuccessfully.
If pictures must be drawn, why
can't they be drawn with a pen
and not with a typewriter?
Sequoia's poetry is one of its
strong points. Eric Almquist's
photography is good, though the
two pictures of cars seem a little
forced. I have a slight prejudice
against pictures of artistically
decaying automobiles and trucks,
which have never held out any
great truths to me, but always
look as if they are trying to.
Drawfing both the poetry and
the photography is some
exceptionally well-written prose.
John Steacy's "Richland
Woman," which seems to be
trying to reach an end it never
quite gets to, but which leaves
some beautiful descriptions of
places and feelings behind it in its
quest.
The quiet, rich past and the
confusing, hot present weave in
and out of each other with very
few jerks in the cease of
transitions. The work's major
drawback is its unfinished present
which draws the reader into a
haunting obsurity, and then leaves
him to find his own way out. The
past in the poem, the father,
other, and the grandmother
(". . . a beautiful woman. She
lived out here three years and
then she got pregnant and had my
father. Then on Spring when my
grandfather and father wery gone
to town the Consumnees
overflowed its banks and upon
their return she was vanished,
never heard or seen again.") is
inextricably merged with its
present. The writing suffers from
some roughness—the author seems

too close to his emotions at
times—but the overall quality is
very good.
"Winter Tears" is undoubtedly
the best work in the magazine. It
is solid, it draws you into the
story with masterful
understatement, it makes you
hate the bastard who's telling
it—but like him because you like
so many bastards who think the
way he does, and it makes you
feel something of what the
characters are feeling. Daniel
never loses control of his writing,
he never seems to forget that you
are there, reading it, and that it's
not always easy for you to
understand what he's feeling.
Competent, but not striking
artwork and unpretentious design
round out an unpretentious,
well-balanced, and very readable
magazine. They're on sale now
around campus for 75c. Pick one
up and find a quiet spot to read it,
it's worth it.
