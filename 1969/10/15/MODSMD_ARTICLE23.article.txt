# 40-man: Better Representation?
## ASSU to Elect First Senate 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Students will vote Thursday
md Friday for candidates for the
student Senate, a new legislative
body that hopefully will provide
better campus representation and
also "more thoughtful student
government."
The 40-member Senate was
approved by the student body last
spring in a referendum to replace
the Legislature (LASSU). The
Senate membership is intended to
represent students in proportion
to the size of their undergraduate
and graduate schools.
The old LASSU was an
amorphous mass of more than
140 members, elected according
to residences or petitions from
off-campus students. Attendance
was spotty, and voting credentials
rarely checked. LASSU ofton was
dominated by strong personalities
or members who were masters of
parliamentary procedure.
In the face of these problems,
last year's ASSU president Denis
Hayes drew up plans for a smaller,
more workable body. He modeled
the Senate along the lines of the
faculty's Senate.
Faculty Senate Formal
The 53-member faculty Senate
is in a sense a steering committee
for the Academic Council,
composed or all professors and
seven administrators. The Senate's
actions are reviewable by the
Council upon petition.
The faculty Senate membership
was divided among the
University's departments
according to their staff size. In
April of 1968, after two years of
studv elections were held for the

positions and in September of last
year the first meetings were held.
New Constitution
Hayes then submitted his plan
for the new student Senate as part
of a new constitution for approval
in elections last spring, and it was
accepted. Since there ary roughly
an equal number of graduate and
undergraduate students, the
40-man Senate membership was
divided in half with each group
receiving 20 seats.
Within the undergraduate
ranks, ten members will represent
students majoring in Humanities
and Sciences, eight members from
General Studies (undeclared
majors), and two members from
Earth Science and Engineering.
For graduate students, six will
be from the Humanities and
Sciences, six from Engineering,
two from the Business School,
two from the School of
Education, two from the School
of Medicine, and two from the
Law School.
Hare System
The method for electing
students to the Senate will be the
Hare system, a complicated
method in which voters list their
preferences in descending order.
(The system is fully explained on
page 5.)
The results will take between
ten days and two weeks to
process, since ballots from
overseas campuses take several
days to arrive and computer time
is difficult to arrange.
Most student leaders are
looking forward to the new
Senate as a welcomed
improvement over LASSU. Black

Student Union (BSU) spokesman
Dave Edward commented "The
smaller size will definitely
expedite matters. The slimming
down of the group is a good idea.
Eight-Man Slate
The BSU has come forward
with the only formal slate for the
election. It includes five
undergraduates in Humanities and
Sciences: Leo Bazile, James
Parham, Dave Edwards, Anthony
Rogers, and Sloan Blocker. There
are also three undergraduates
running in the General Studies
field: Freeman Sensabaugh, Mike
Dawson, and Jon Sylvester.
Their platform statement
declares in part that "We have
been told that if we communicate
our desires and needs through the
'normal' channels, then real
progress can be made . . . And if
the normal channels do not work,
we are more than certain that we
can find some abnormal channels
that will."
Strong Personalities
ASSU Council of Presidents
member Pat Shea hopes that the
new Senate "won't be dominated
by strong personalities. There will
be new mechanisms to tame them,
and perhaps with the smaller
numbers the members will feel
more responsible and committed
to the Senate."
Shea also thinks that the new
group will have a chance to form
more efficient committees that
will work on campus issues such
as land and development or
trustee relations.
Another Council of Presidents
member, John Grube, wants the
Senate to be "more of a working

body and less of a legislative
group prone to interest groups."
Since the whole basis of the
Senate "is academic
constituencies more than the
residential, interests will shift to
the academic realm."
Senate. I think it will be more
efficient as well."
Voters will also have a chance
to voice opinion on the Vietnam
war by choosing between eight
alternative policies.

Since there are 129 students
running for the student Senate it
is impossible for the Daily to run

platforms. The following list is the
official list of all candidates from
