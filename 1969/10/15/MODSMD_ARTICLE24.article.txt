# Panel Member Mandel Denied Entrance Visa
## 
### 
The Graduate Student
Association symposium on
"Technology and the Third
World" will proceed as planned
this weekend, less one of the main
speakers. Dr. Ernest Mandel, one
of the world's foremost authority
on Marxist economics, has been
refused permission to enter the
United States.
Dr. Mandel, who is editor of
the Belgian socialist weekly La
Gauche, was given no reason for
the refusal of a visa, though the
State Department informed the
GSA that it was due to his
violations of restrictions during a
1968 tour of this country.
As a Trotskyist, Dr. Mandel is
on the restricted travel list. He
allegedly violated restrictions by
deviating from his itinerary and

raising money for a French legal
defense fund.
"The policy of keeping out the
better scholars of Europe is an
interesting one," noted GSA
member Tim Coburn. "They call
Mandel a Communist, but I
wonder whether that doesn't
apply to anyone whose
philosophy is not popular in the
United States."
"This isn't the first case of this
kind," said Elise Becket, another
member of the association.
"Andre Gundar of France, an
extremely well-known Marxist
economist is also unable to get a
visa, aside from the fact that the
government prevented his getting
a job with the UN."
Richard Miles, spokesman for
the group, indicated that "we're

really sorry about that; it will
make a big difference in our
program. We had hoped to present
a radical outlook on development
and have some good debate."
Mandel was scheduled to
debate John Kenneth Galbraith,
author of such well-known books
as The Affluent Society and The
New Industrial State. Galbraith
will keynote the conference on
Friday at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium.
Panelists following Galbraith's
address will include Steve
Weissman of the Pacific Study
Center, Don Kessing of the
Stanford Department of
Economics, and Pan Yotopoulos
of the Food Research Institute.
Saturday's program, beginning
at 9 a.m. in Memorial Church, will
include speakers such as Paul
Bundy, Weissman, Richard
Holton, and Galbraith.
Seminars with these and other
scholars including Gabriel
Almond, James O'Connor, and
Carleton Wood, will be held
throughout the day.

CORRIDOR COMRADES—Residents
of one of Ro bio's Iwo coed corridors
congregate in a room to pose for
DAILY' photographer. Boys and girls
now cohabit two corridors, largely due
to an administrative mixup.
Unfortunately, all of the rooms are
singles. Story on this delightful foulup
will appear in Friday's DAILY.
The Graduate Student
Association symposium on
"Technology and the Third
World" will proceed as planned
this weekend, less one of the main
speakers. Dr. Ernest Mandel, one
of the world's foremost authority
on Marxist economics, has been
refused permission to enter the
United States.
Dr. Mandel, who is editor of
the Belgian socialist weekly La
Gauche, was given no reason for
the refusal of a visa, though the
State Department informed the
GSA that it was due to his
violations of restrictions during a
1968 tour of this country.
As a Trotskyist, Dr. Mandel is
on the restricted travel list. He
allegedly violated restrictions by
deviating from his itinerary and

raising money for a French legal
defense fund.
"The policy of keeping out the
better scholars of Europe is an
interesting one," noted GSA
member Tim Coburn. "They call
Mandel a Communist, but I
wonder whether that doesn't
apply to anyone whose
philosophy is not popular in the
United States."
"This isn't the first case of this
kind," said Elise Becket, another
member of the association.
"Andre Gundar of France, an
extremely well-known Marxist
economist is also unable to get a
visa, aside from the fact that the
government prevented his getting
a job with the UN."
Richard Miles, spokesman for
the group, indicated that "we're

really sorry about that; it will
make a big difference in our
program. We had hoped to present
a radical outlook on development
and have some good debate."
Mandel was scheduled to
debate John Kenneth Galbraith,
author of such well-known books
as The Affluent Society and The
New Industrial State. Galbraith
will keynote the conference on
Friday at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium.
Panelists following Galbraith's
address will include Steve
Weissman of the Pacific Study
Center, Don Kessing of the
Stanford Department of
Economics, and Pan Yotopoulos
of the Food Research Institute.
