# Sapir Waives Court Retrial
## 
### JOHN COONROD 
Marc Sapir was again denied
continuance of his retrial resulting
from last spring's Stanford
Research Institute
demonstrations.
Sapir appeared in the court of
Judge William Ingham yesterday
morning, following a hung jury
decision given in his three-week
trial last summer. Sapir is charged
with participating in an unlawful
assembly and creating a public
nuisance by obstructing traffic.
Sapir then offered to submit
the transcript from his last trial
for Judge Ingham to rule on, thus
waiving his rights for another
court of jury trial.
Sapir told the Daily that
another long trial would seriously
jeopardize his medical studies. He
had submitted a letter to the
court from the medical school
dean's office stating the times of
his studies, and asked that his
retrial be scheduled for a time he
was not in school. A similar
request was refused by this
summer's court.
Santa Clara District Attorney
Craig Brown commented that
although his office did have some
additional evidence, a new trial
would not be substantially
different from the submitted
transcript. Brown said he did not
know how long it would take for
Judge Ingham to review the
as the transcript was not in a
written form; it exists only in the
recorder's notes, and must be read
aloud to the judge.. However,
Sapir has been ordered to return
for the decision on November 10.
Sapir stated he felt that these
trials were being held "to keep the
activists out of action" as a kind
of political intimidation.
