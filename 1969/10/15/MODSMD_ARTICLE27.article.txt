# Booters Bomb Menlo, 4-5; Houghton, Lau, Casey Score
## 
### 
The Stanford Varsity soccer
team notched its second win in
three starts by defeating a hard
fighting Menlo College team last
weekend 4-1, in a game that had
everything; brilliant saves by both
goalies (each were credited with
24 saves) and plenty of action
around the goal. A total of 54
shots were taken, 35 by Stanford
and 19 by Menlo.
With 3 minutes remaining in
the first quarter, Grasti of Menlo
literally ran over Ben White the
Stanford center half and
proceeded to dribble unmolested

to the Stanford goal where only
goalie "Woody" Hagge stood
between him and a score. Hagge,
slowed down by the soft ground
in front of the goal, was unable to
make the save on the three yard
shot, although he did touch the
ball. Menlo was on the
scoreboard.
With 10 minutes remaining in
the second quarter, Stanford rung
up three quick goals, the first by
Sam Casey, followed quickly by
Linus Lau, and Alan Houghton.
At half time, Stanford led, 3-1.
The third quarter was scoreless.
But with 6 minutes remaining in

the fourth quarter Alan Houghton
scored his second goal of the
afternoon.
The Stanford Braves battled
the Menlo Reserves to a 2-2 tie in
a double overtime match, while
the Stanford Frosh lost their
opener 5-0 to Balboa High School.
Today, the varsity and Braves
travel to San Francisco for games
with San Francisco State.
Friday, the Frosh 112 ace
Woodside Priory at 3:00 p.m. at
home, and Saturday, the varsity
meets Merritt College at 10:30
a.m. here.
