# The 						Icemen Cometh
## Skaters Loaded With Talent 
### EUGENE GASPERSON 
The 1969-70 Stanford ice
hockey team is a vast
improvement over last year's
edition.
That, at least, is the opinion of
most observers who have seen the
Indian six' first few practices at
the Iceland Rink off Ralston
Avenue in Belmont. A massive
recruiting program during fall
quarter registration achieved
massive results—some 85 hockey
players, many of them completely
surprised to find the sport
flourishing in California, signed
up—and the payoff is taking place
on the ice.
Particularly impressive in the
early going has been a line made
up of freshman Paul Tittmann at
center, soph "Flip" Gianos at left
wing, and staff member Patrick
Baldwin at right wing. All three
are speed merchants. Tittmann, an
excellent playmaker, starred at
Andover Prep in Massachusetts,
while Gianos, one of the few
secure regulars from last year,
came up through the Minneapolis

system where kids 10 years old
play in fully organized leagues.
Baldwin, one of the most
experienced men on the team,
holds the line together. A three
year varsity letterman at Michigan
State, he also played extensively
in Europe and was once selected
to the Junior "A" All Star team in
Toronto, Baldwin, who now calls
Detroit home, has even been a
varsity coach, at Cranbrook Prep
in Michigan, and is currently
applying his coaching skills to the
Stanford team.
Three more Minnesotans have
been playing on another good
line: center Dave Muckenhirn of
St. Paul, and wings Don Mitchell
of Wayzata and Dick Todd of
South St. Paul. Hugh Tirrell of the
Business School is currently
centering for Fuller Torrey of the
Medical Center and aeronautical
engineer Bob Kadlec.
Mistakes on the backline cost
several goals last year and some of
the excellent forwards may be
moved back to help out. Even as
it stands, however, things are

better: Rhode Islander Tom
Generous, a history grad student
who was a starter last year, and
Dean Smith from the biology
department, another returnee, are
both having the fight of their lives
to avoid the cut.
Making it so tough are
converted center Jerry Thompson,
an aeronautical engineer from
Minnesota, Gary Aitken, who
hails from a Toronto suburb and
wants to play goal, and two
Chicagoans, Keith Cummings, a
sophomore and former co-captain
at Canterbury Prep, and freshman
Larry Crawford.
In goal, intrasquad competition
is producing more pleasant
surprises. Dick Jones, a chemistry
grad student, who played every
minute last season, faces a stiff
challenge from George Meredith, a
Coloradan in industrial
engineering. Whoever emerges on
top will be tough

moved back to help out. Even as
it stands, however, things are

better: Rhode Islander Tom
Generous, a history grad student
who was a starter last year, and
Dean Smith from the biology
department, another returnee, are
both having the fight of their lives
to avoid the cut.
Making it so tough are
converted center Jerry Thompson,
an aeronautical engineer from
Minnesota, Gary Aitken, who
hails from a Toronto suburb and
wants to play goal, and two
Chicagoans, Keith Cummings, a
sophomore and former co-captain
at Canterbury Prep, and freshman
Larry Crawford.
In goal, intrasquad competition
is producing more pleasant
surprises. Dick Jones, a chemistry
grad student, who played every
minute last season, faces a stiff
challenge from George Meredith, a
Coloradan in industrial
engineering. Whoever emerges on
top will be tough
The 1969-70 Stanford ice
hockey team is a vast
improvement over last year's
edition.
That, at least, is the opinion of
most observers who have seen the
Indian six' first few practices at
the Iceland Rink off Ralston
Avenue in Belmont. A massive
recruiting program during fall
quarter registration achieved
massive results—some 85 hockey
players, many of them completely
surprised to find the sport
flourishing in California, signed
up—and the payoff is taking place
on the ice.
Particularly impressive in the
early going has been a line made
up of freshman Paul Tittmann at
center, soph "Flip" Gianos at left
wing, and staff member Patrick
Baldwin at right wing. All three
are speed merchants. Tittmann, an
excellent playmaker, starred at
Andover Prep in Massachusetts,
while Gianos, one of the few
secure regulars from last year,
came up through the Minneapolis

system where kids 10 years old
play in fully organized leagues.
Baldwin, one of the most
experienced men on the team,
holds the line together. A three
year varsity letterman at Michigan
State, he also played extensively
in Europe and was once selected
to the Junior "A" All Star team in
Toronto, Baldwin, who now calls
Detroit home, has even been a
varsity coach, at Cranbrook Prep
in Michigan, and is currently
applying his coaching skills to the
Stanford team.
Three more Minnesotans have
been playing on another good
line: center Dave Muckenhirn of
St. Paul, and wings Don Mitchell
of Wayzata and Dick Todd of
South St. Paul. Hugh Tirrell of the
Business School is currently
centering for Fuller Torrey of the
Medical Center and aeronautical
engineer Bob Kadlec.
Mistakes on the backline cost
several goals last year and some of
the excellent forwards may be
moved back to help out. Even as
