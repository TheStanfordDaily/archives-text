# Pac-8 Leaders
## Clarence, Jim On Top 
### 
Official Pacific-8 Conference
statistics were released yesterday,
and two individuals are running
away with all the records.
Football in the Pac-8 is barely
approaching the midway point of
this Centennial Season, but it's
going to take some doing for
anybody to catch USC's talented
tailback Clarence Davis and
Stanford's own brilliant
quarterback Jim Plunkett.
Plunkett leads in two
departments —total offense and
passing. In four games, the Injun
QB has compiled 1150 total
offensive yards, 1072 via the
airways. He is far and away the
leading passer with 75
completions, 19 more than
runner-up Tom Blanchard of
Oregon.
After only four games, Davis is
some 219 rushing yards in front
of his closest rival Greg Jones of
UCLA. Davis has ground out 658
net yards in Troy's four triumphs
thus far, while Jones, in five
games, is running second with 439
net yards. Jones' teammate
Mickey Cureton, who helps
provide the Bruins with the most
punishing 1-2 punch in the Pac-8,
has the best per-carry average
among the leaders with an 8.1
mark.
There was only one new leader
in the Pacific-8 individual
statistics after the fifth week of
action. Oregon teammates Bob
Moore and Bob Newland moved
into first place in receiving with
18 catches apiece while last
week's leader, Gwen Cooper of
UCLA, and Stanford's Bob Moore
are deadlocked in second with 17
receptions each.
Stanford retained its total
offense and passing offense
leadership, but there were several
new leaders elsewhere in the
conference team statistics.
The Indians came into last
Saturday's battle with USC
averaging a whopping 566 yards
per game. They compiled 352
yards against Troy's stubborn
defense, but remained in first
place in team total offense (523
yd. avg.) and team passing offense
(304 yd. avg.).
The Trojans took over the
Tribe's No. 1 spot in rushing
offense, running up 225 net yards!
on the ground for a 251 per-game
average with UCLA moving into

second place with a 249 per-game
rushing figure.
There were two new leaders in
the team defensive departments.
UCLA took over first place in
total defense, allowing only 252
yards per game in five victories.

USC also replaced Stanford in
rushing defense as the leader with
a 96 yards-per-game figure, while
the Indians are second with a 97
yards-per-game average. California
leads in passing defense for the
third straight week, giving up only
an average of 87 yards a game.


ALONG CAIMK JONKS—USC's fine sophomore quarterback Jimmy Jones watches calmly as his pass sails through the air in
the Trojans' final scoring drive to beat Stanford Saturday night. The poised newcomer was overshadowed by the Tribe's Jim
Plunkett all night, but in the final SC march, he was magnificent. The win kept USC third in the AP poll. Stanford slipped to
19th.

approaching the midway point of
this Centennial Season, but it's
going to take some doing for
anybody to catch USC's talented
tailback Clarence Davis and
Stanford's own brilliant
quarterback Jim Plunkett.
Plunkett leads in two
departments —total offense and
passing. In four games, the Injun
QB has compiled 1150 total
offensive yards, 1072 via the
airways. He is far and away the
leading passer with 75
completions, 19 more than
runner-up Tom Blanchard of
Oregon.
After only four games, Davis is
some 219 rushing yards in front
of his closest rival Greg Jones of
UCLA. Davis has ground out 658
net yards in Troy's four triumphs
thus far, while Jones, in five
games, is running second with 439
net yards. Jones' teammate
Mickey Cureton, who helps
provide the Bruins with the most
punishing 1-2 punch in the Pac-8,
has the best per-carry average
among the leaders with an 8.1
mark.
There was only one new leader
in the Pacific-8 individual
statistics after the fifth week of
action. Oregon teammates Bob
Moore and Bob Newland moved
into first place in receiving with
18 catches apiece while last
week's leader, Gwen Cooper of
UCLA, and Stanford's Bob Moore
are deadlocked in second with 17
receptions each.
Stanford retained its total
offense and passing offense
leadership, but there were several
new leaders elsewhere in the
conference team statistics.
The Indians came into last
Saturday's battle with USC
averaging a whopping 566 yards
per game. They compiled 352
yards against Troy's stubborn
defense, but remained in first
place in team total offense (523
yd. avg.) and team passing offense
(304 yd. avg.).
The Trojans took over the
Tribe's No. 1 spot in rushing
offense, running up 225 net yards!
on the ground for a 251 per-game
average with UCLA moving into

second place with a 249 per-game
rushing figure.
There were two new leaders in
the team defensive departments.
UCLA took over first place in
total defense, allowing only 252
yards per game in five victories.

USC also replaced Stanford in
rushing defense as the leader with
a 96 yards-per-game figure, while
the Indians are second with a 97
yards-per-game average. California
leads in passing defense for the
third straight week, giving up only
an average of 87 yards a game.


ALONG CAIMK JONKS—USC's fine sophomore quarterback Jimmy Jones watches calmly as his pass sails through the air in
the Trojans' final scoring drive to beat Stanford Saturday night. The poised newcomer was overshadowed by the Tribe's Jim
Plunkett all night, but in the final SC march, he was magnificent. The win kept USC third in the AP poll. Stanford slipped to
19th.
Official Pacific-8 Conference
statistics were released yesterday,
and two individuals are running
away with all the records.
