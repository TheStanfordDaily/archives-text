"Maggie's Farm, A Radical
Guide to Stanford" went on sale
last night for the first time at the
Moratorium rally.
The 44-page booklet is
published by the Stanford SDS. It
includes "survival" information
on Stanford life, an analysis of
Stanford education, a section on
the Stanford empire, and a history
of the April 3rd Movement.
Starting Thursday, the booklet
will be on sale every day at noon
at Tresidder Union for 25c.
"Maggie's Farm" is a successor
to "Through the Looking Glass,"
a booklet issued by SDS last fall
which sold more than 1,500
copies.
The title "Maggie's Farm" is
taken from a Bob Dylan lyric: "I
ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm
no more."
