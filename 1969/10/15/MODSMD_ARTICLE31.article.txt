# Tribe Wins, Faces Tough Trojans Next
## 
### FRED LEESON 
There's one obstacle gone but a
big one coming up for Stanford's
1969 harriers
Last Saturday they ran off
with their second annual victory
at the Sacramento State
Invitational cross country meet,
easily defeating California 25-96
for first place. But unlike a year
ago when Stanford edged USC by
a point there, the Trojans weren't
around.
Instead, Stanford gets it's first
look at the powerful SC squad
this Saturday at Long Beach State
in a four-way race also including
Pepperdine and Cal Poly
(Pomona).
At Sacramento, the first five
Indians scored within a period of
19 seconds, thus fulfilling Tribe
strategy and pleasing Coach
Marshall Clark.
Lacking an individual runner of
overwhelming stature, like WSU's
Gerry Lindgren for example,
Stanford's pack must finish
together if it hopes to score well,
and that's just what it did
Saturday.
Bob Coe, Greg Brock, Chuck
Menz, Don Kardong and Arvid
Kretz placed third, fifth, sixth,
seventh and ninth, and runners
five, six and seven were separated
by a mere four seconds.
The other varsity runners,
Decker Underwood and Jack
Lawson, finished 13th and 18th,
giving the Tribe a seven-man total
spread of 33 seconds. The first
five to place are figured in the
team score.
Against SC, Stanford will be
making its first run of the year on
a six mile course, and Coach
Clark, not venturing to predict a
winner, says "At that distance it's
a question of who can stand the
gruel."

Mike Sellers and All-American
Jeff Marsee are back from SC's
NCAA third-place finishers last
year, and Ole Oleson, NCAA
three-mile champion is a
questionable starter with knee
problems. Against this style of
quality, the Tribe pack faces its
toughest test Saturday morning.
