Moratorium participants.
Commenting on the
I rescheduling and opening of the
program for the Stanford
community, Director of the

> thing to do. I am personally
sympathetic with the Moratorium
effort and am very glad that the
Paul Taylor Company cooperated
in rearranging the performance
time. I certainly feel that this
program offers works which will
be significant to Moratorium
participants."
"From Sea to Shining Sea" will
be presented in three parts: "Send
me the wretched refuse of your
teeming shore," "Us," and
"Living pictures," with
choreography by Paul Taylor,
music by John MacDowell, design
by John Rawlings and lighting by
Jennifer Tipton. Also on the
program are "Post Meridian,"
described as "seeing a familiar
landscape you have known only
by day for the first time by
streetlamp" and "Apocalypse" in
its two parts "Sacred" and
"Profane."

tomorrow at Dinkelspiel Ticket
Office from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
