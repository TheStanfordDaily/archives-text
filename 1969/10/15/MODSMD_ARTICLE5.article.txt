# Speakers, Music At Rally Launch Moratorium Drive

### GREG WHITE SUSAN KRIEGER 
"We will not be silenced, we
cannot be silenced, for it is our
generation being killed. We are
attempting something very
ambitious—to end the war that
has dragged on for five years."
John Kramer, student organizer
of Stanford's Moratorium
activities, made this declaration in
opening last night's
pre-Moratorium rally in M morial
Auditorium. K ran it w * Mowed
on the podium by spe; ters as
diverse as Edward Keating, former
Ramparts editor, folksinger Mimi
Farina, and Leo Bazile of the
Black Students Union.
Bazile, addressing a
predominately white audience,
said, "You've got to realize the
Vietnamese have kicked our asses.
We have lost the war. Being
against thy war is a fashionable
thing. I'm glad you've finally got
here." He warned against those
politicians cashing in on the
anti-war movement, naming
Alioto, Unruh, and McGovern as
examples.
Assistant Dean of Students
Felix Gutierrez, rising to cheers of
"Viva la Raza," said, "For those
of us who are Chicanos our hatred

of the war is personal—we too
have suffered at the hands of
American imperialists. Our
forefathers went through the same
thing here in Palo Alto." Citing
casualty figures, he said Vietnam
"is also genocide against Chicano
people of the Southwest."
Other speakers talked about
practical matters of canvassing.
Curt Comstock, Palo Alto City
Councilman, with Ronald Reagan
on his mind, said, "If this is
treason, let us make the most of
it." He listed three types of
people canvassers could meet in
the Palo Alto area. He urged
"putting to work" those
sympathetic to peace and warned
of the futility of arguing with

those sympathetic to the war. i ne
"uncertain," though hardest to
deal with, will be the most crucial,
according to Comstock.
Professor Art Hastings of the
Drama Department spoke next.
He gave tips on methods of
persuasion, stressing sincerely
"listening to the other person."
He said canvassers should set
straight in their minds those
things which they are afraid of
being asked.
Ed Keating, former Ramparts
editor and once a Stanford
student added a lively note to the
rally with his sarcastic jabs at
national leaders. Calling Nixon a
political beggar and Reagan
nothing but a rerun, Keating said

"I'm sorry I'm here tonight. I
wish I didn't have to get out and
canvass to find out why my
generation sends you out to kill in
a stupid, banal war . . . we've got
Nixon to kick around some
more—l will kick him any chance
I get."
Keating later told the Daily,
"The older generation gets uptight
on hair and drugs but not about
sending their kids to
war... people will
listen . . . people need something
to do."
In a solemn, slow voice, Dean
of the Chapel Davie Napier
resolved that "Hope is essential"
to the Moratorium's cause. He

campus, starts last night's rally in Mem Aud with the words "the people are

recalled the story of Cain and
Abel and how Abel's blood cried
out for justice. Napier then
pleaded "No more, good Lord, no
more."
Napier also announced an
international fund being collected
for those Vietnamese left
destitute by the war.
Music was also an important
part of the rally. Mimi Farina,
Joan Baez's sister, and Julie Payne
sang "Hang Up Your Sorrows" a
song written by her late husband
Richard. The audience, which was
rather quiet all night, sporadically
joined in the singing.

Also performing were folk
guitarist Dale Mead and the Bernie
Trilling Combo. Mead sang two of
his own songs satirizing the war
while the combo performed a
number written especially for the
occasion, the "Moratorium
Suite."
Student reaction to the rally
was varied. Some were
disappointed by the lack of
"community feeling" shown by
the audience, while others lelt
reassured by the speakers,
especially those who talked about
the problems of canvassing. Total
attendance at the rally was
estimated to be about 1,600,
including students and Palo Alto
area residents.
