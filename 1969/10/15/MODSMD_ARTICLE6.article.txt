# SES Urges Push Past Curriculum

### JENNY MATTHEWS 
"The Dean of Students Office
should be given clear-cut
responsibility for developing a
creative, balanced, and interesting
extracurricular program at
Stanford," states Report VI of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES).
The report, entitled "The
Extra-Curriculum," primarily
analyzes the current state of
campus publications and athletics
with a brief mention of campus
cultural activities.
SES was a two-year complete
review of all facets of the
Stanford educational process. The
just-issued report is the ninth of
ten reports to be published, with
the final document of teaching
and research to be issued in the
near future.
The document recommends the
establishment of a

student-faculty-staff Committee
on the Extra-Curriculum, "vested
with the responsibility for making
recommendations to the Dean of
Students."
"It appears to many," the
booklet points out, "that the
extracurriculum at Stanford often
replaces quality with
quantity . . . Many students
currently involved in
program-planning organizations
strongly urge that an attempt be
made to coordinate, but not to
control, the many similar
programs."
Conjecturing that an
"ex tracu rr icu I u m " com m i It ee
would aid in a significant increase
in non-classroom activities, the
report proposes that the
University set up an annual
$2t>,000 contingency fund,
administered by the Dean of
Students.
Publications Studied
Specifically discussing
publications, the report stresses
that steps should be taken in
order to make the Stanford Daily
totally independent of University
or student governmental control.
It also recommends the
establishment of a supplemental
publication to be issued during
dead and finals weeks when the
Daily is not publishing. In
addition, the report calls for wider
distribution of Campus Report
and for the encouragement of new
literary and political magazines.
One of the most significant
proposals is for University support
of course evaluation processes.
The booklet notes that since its
initial recommendation was
written, a committee on course
evaluations has been set up,
headed by Professor Bradley
Efron.
Reform Athletics
The major part of SES Report
VI is concerned with University
athletics.
The report calls for the division
of the present Department of
Physical Education and Athletics
into two separate departments
md for the establishment of a
panel of student athletes "to

discuss with coaches some of the
problems their fellow athletes face
in integration into the
University."
The athletic recommendations
propose that following a split,
"the Department of Athletics
should be responsible only for the
intercollegiate program" while
"the Department of Physical
Education should be responsible
for the instructional program, the
intramural sports program, sports

clubs, and other University
recreational needs."
Numerous proposals are made
for the better integration of the
Department of Athletics with the
Stanford community. These
include the establishment of a
Coach Selection Committee, a
recruitment policy "aimed at
getting top level students who are
also athletes," and continued
attempts to integrate coaches into
the University community.

totally independent of University
or student governmental control.
It also recommends the
establishment of a supplemental
publication to be issued during
dead and finals weeks when the
Daily is not publishing. In
addition, the report calls for wider
distribution of Campus Report
and for the encouragement of new
literary and political magazines.
One of the most significant

of course evaluation processes.
The booklet notes that since its
initial recommendation was
written, a committee on course
evaluations has been set up,

The major part of SES Report
VI is concerned with University
athletics.
The report calls for the division
of the present Department of
Physical Education and Athletics
into two separate departments
md for the establishment of a
panel of student athletes "to

discuss with coaches some of the
problems their fellow athletes face
in integration into the
University."
The athletic recommendations
propose that following a split,
"the Department of Athletics
should be responsible only for the
intercollegiate program" while
"the Department of Physical
Education should be responsible
for the instructional program, the
intramural sports program, sports

clubs, and other University
recreational needs."
Numerous proposals are made
for the better integration of the
Department of Athletics with the
Stanford community. These
include the establishment of a
Coach Selection Committee, a
recruitment policy "aimed at
getting top level students who are
also athletes," and continued
attempts to integrate coaches into
the University community.
"The Dean of Students Office
should be given clear-cut
responsibility for developing a
creative, balanced, and interesting
extracurricular program at
Stanford," states Report VI of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES).
The report, entitled "The
Extra-Curriculum," primarily
analyzes the current state of
campus publications and athletics
with a brief mention of campus
cultural activities.
SES was a two-year complete
review of all facets of the
Stanford educational process. The
just-issued report is the ninth of
ten reports to be published, with
the final document of teaching
and research to be issued in the
near future.
The document recommends the
establishment of a

student-faculty-staff Committee
on the Extra-Curriculum, "vested
with the responsibility for making
recommendations to the Dean of
Students."
"It appears to many," the
booklet points out, "that the
extracurriculum at Stanford often
replaces quality with
quantity . . . Many students
currently involved in
program-planning organizations
strongly urge that an attempt be
made to coordinate, but not to
control, the many similar
programs."
Conjecturing that an
"ex tracu rr icu I u m " com m i It ee
would aid in a significant increase
in non-classroom activities, the
report proposes that the
University set up an annual
$2t>,000 contingency fund,
administered by the Dean of
Students.
