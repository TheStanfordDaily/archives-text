# American Default
## Support the War 
### Mike Wolf 
Fortunately, American foreign
policy is designed by the President
of the United States and not by
any horde of University
presidents, professors, students, or
other clued-in Joes. .All manner
and number of protestors,
scholars, clergyman, "liberals,"
children, and other committed
and morally authoritative people
to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Vietnam war is prudent,
desirable, just, wise, moral,
beneficial, and necessary to the
better interests of the United
States, Southeast Asia, and the
world.
That said, let me step back to
clarify what I mean by "the
Vietnam war." I mean the basic
commitment that the United
States government has made and
fulfilled in Vietnam over the
course of the past seven years or
so. I also mean all that that
commitment has directly and
necessarily entailed by way of
war, suffering, death, discomfort,
and unpleasantness.
The last three Presidents have
all understood the fundamental
validity of this proposition.
But what exactly is the
commitment that these men have
made in the name of the United
States? It would be well to
reconsider it briefly—especially in
view of all the crap that is
presently being slung around
about American purposes in
Vietnam. The United States has
pledged to defend by force of
arms the right of the South
Vietnamese people to national
self-determination. We have
pledged with our Asian allies to
support the armed forces of the
South Vietnamese Republic in
their defense of that nation
against the aggression of North
Vietnam.
No Moral Justification
Our commitment to political
freedom and national sovereignty
for South Vietnam rests upon
compelling moral and diplomatic
grounds. The abandonment of a
people to brutal totalitarianism
cannot approach moral
justification no matter how much
it is papered over with "peace,"
with "allowing them to handle
their own affairs," with "freeing
them from imperialistic
oppression," or with "delivering
them to their liberating brethren."
It is as easy for one to say, "The
U.S. can't police the world" as it
is for one to say, "I can't police
the streets"—and the results are
about the same. People might
have hoped that the horrors of
this century would weaken such
attitudes. But it remains more
popular to mythologize about the
need for peace than to accept
ultimate responsibilities to an
unknown race, or to revisit the
cavernous tombs of recent
history.
The significance of the
Communist crime in Vietnam is
yet much larger, for it entends far
beyond the immediate fate of
South Vietnam to manifold
considerations of international
politics and global defense
strategy--of which I can only
intimate the dimensions here. The
conquest of South Vietnam would
have extremely adverse effects on
the balance of political, strategic,
and economic power in Southeast
Asia—and that very definitely
means adverse effects on he
meager but critical prospects of
improving the human condition in
that part of the world. These
effects would develop not simply

from the policy actions of
Communist rulers (nationalistic
"Ho Chi Minh" Communists, of
course) in South Vietnam, but
also from the interpretations that
would be put upon Communist
victory—and U.S. defeat—by
statesmen throughout Asia and
the rest of the world.
The aggressive expansionist
airms of the Vietnamese
Communists are well documented.
The threat they pose to he
security of other nations have
been gravely acknowledged by
virtually all governments in
Southeast Asia. Collective security
treaties and other international
agreements maintained on a
foundation of mutual confidence
and trust constitute the bedrock
of the present international
system —and the strategic basis for
its stability. A U.S. renege in
Vietnam would be a massive blow
to U.S. diplomatic credentials, to
the present structure of
international organization, and to
the stability of the international
"nvironment (peace).
The Faces of War
The most lUcid justification of
the American commitment in
Vietnam hardly mitigates the
ugliness or the suffering of the
war. But ugliness and suffering are
hard facts of life, and avoidance
of which is neither politically nor
morally justifiable absolute. Those
for whom the immorality of
killing is the all-important fact of
the war would do well to focus
their attention upon the
instigators and primary
perpetrators of all the killing, the
heinous practitioners of terrorism
and mass murder of innocent
civilian populations. (Terrorism
means wholesale, cold-blooded
murder and torture of just any
nameless soul who happens to be
around—for psychological shock
value and political effect.)
Perhaps the grossest measure of
the cognitive perversions anti-war
people are willing to indulge for
the sake of mental relief is the
atrocious mockery about Viet
Cong benevolence. This "hero"
line—incidentally being vigorously
parroted during the Moratorium
activities by the SDS,
etc.—assumes absolutely hideous
proportions before the stark
testimony of facts like the mass
Tet "executions," the massacre of
the Dak Son villagers, the V.C.
recruiting tortures, and the
routine market slaughters of the
terrorists.
So the war is justified—where
does that leave us? It leaves us
with the responsibility to end
it—to end it as soon as possible,
with minimum acceptable loss to
human and political values. It's
semantic legerdemain to contrast
"winning" and "ending" the war.
Our basic military objectives are
to prevent the forcible take-over
of South Vietnam and to better
equip the Republic of South
Vietnam to handle its own
defense. These objectives are
presently secure. Our task now is
to end the , war without
jeopardizing these objectives. If
we succeed we will have "won".
But the threat to South
Vietnamese freedom remains
critical. The enemy is still fighting
fiercely. The North Vietnamese
battalions remain in the South
The ARVN cannot yet fend for
itself. Barring the negotiation of a
meaningful settlement, we must
struggle on.

Ruling out the abandonment of
our commitment, ruling out a
disguised surrender or peace at
any price, the President has
determined to use the utmost
powers of his office to persuade
the Communists to enter into
effective negotiations. His policy
has been more than conciliatory
in every way. The sole demand,
Nixon has emphasized, that he
will not modify is that the South
Vietnamese must be given the
simple reedom to choose their
, national institutions without
coercion. It is clear that the
Communist marauders are
uninterested in this proposition,
and that they are stalling
negotiations in hopes of American
default. Our government is trying
to convince them of the futility of
that course. So should we.

Ruling out the abandonment of

political science and is currently
President of the Stanford Young
Republicans.)
Fortunately, American foreign
policy is designed by the President
of the United States and not by
any horde of University
presidents, professors, students, or
other clued-in Joes. .All manner
and number of protestors,
scholars, clergyman, "liberals,"
children, and other committed
and morally authoritative people
to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Vietnam war is prudent,
desirable, just, wise, moral,
beneficial, and necessary to the
better interests of the United
States, Southeast Asia, and the
world.
That said, let me step back to
clarify what I mean by "the
Vietnam war." I mean the basic
commitment that the United
States government has made and
fulfilled in Vietnam over the
course of the past seven years or
so. I also mean all that that
commitment has directly and
necessarily entailed by way of
war, suffering, death, discomfort,
and unpleasantness.
The last three Presidents have
all understood the fundamental
validity of this proposition.
But what exactly is the
commitment that these men have
made in the name of the United
States? It would be well to
reconsider it briefly—especially in
view of all the crap that is
presently being slung around
about American purposes in
Vietnam. The United States has
pledged to defend by force of
arms the right of the South
Vietnamese people to national
self-determination. We have
pledged with our Asian allies to
support the armed forces of the
South Vietnamese Republic in
their defense of that nation
against the aggression of North
Vietnam.
No Moral Justification
Our commitment to political
freedom and national sovereignty
for South Vietnam rests upon
compelling moral and diplomatic
grounds. The abandonment of a
people to brutal totalitarianism
cannot approach moral
justification no matter how much
it is papered over with "peace,"
with "allowing them to handle
their own affairs," with "freeing
them from imperialistic
oppression," or with "delivering
them to their liberating brethren."
It is as easy for one to say, "The
U.S. can't police the world" as it
is for one to say, "I can't police
the streets"—and the results are
about the same. People might
have hoped that the horrors of
this century would weaken such
attitudes. But it remains more
popular to mythologize about the
need for peace than to accept
ultimate responsibilities to an
unknown race, or to revisit the
cavernous tombs of recent
history.
The significance of the
Communist crime in Vietnam is
yet much larger, for it entends far
beyond the immediate fate of
South Vietnam to manifold
considerations of international
politics and global defense
strategy--of which I can only
intimate the dimensions here. The
conquest of South Vietnam would
have extremely adverse effects on
the balance of political, strategic,
and economic power in Southeast
Asia—and that very definitely
means adverse effects on he
meager but critical prospects of
improving the human condition in
that part of the world. These
effects would develop not simply

from the policy actions of
Communist rulers (nationalistic
"Ho Chi Minh" Communists, of
course) in South Vietnam, but
also from the interpretations that
would be put upon Communist
victory—and U.S. defeat—by
statesmen throughout Asia and
the rest of the world.
The aggressive expansionist
airms of the Vietnamese
Communists are well documented.
The threat they pose to he
security of other nations have
been gravely acknowledged by
virtually all governments in
Southeast Asia. Collective security
treaties and other international
agreements maintained on a
foundation of mutual confidence
and trust constitute the bedrock
of the present international
system —and the strategic basis for
its stability. A U.S. renege in
Vietnam would be a massive blow
to U.S. diplomatic credentials, to
the present structure of
international organization, and to
the stability of the international
"nvironment (peace).
The Faces of War
The most lUcid justification of
the American commitment in
Vietnam hardly mitigates the
ugliness or the suffering of the
war. But ugliness and suffering are
hard facts of life, and avoidance
of which is neither politically nor
morally justifiable absolute. Those
for whom the immorality of
killing is the all-important fact of
the war would do well to focus
their attention upon the
instigators and primary
perpetrators of all the killing, the
heinous practitioners of terrorism
and mass murder of innocent
civilian populations. (Terrorism
means wholesale, cold-blooded
murder and torture of just any
nameless soul who happens to be
around—for psychological shock
value and political effect.)
Perhaps the grossest measure of
the cognitive perversions anti-war
people are willing to indulge for
the sake of mental relief is the
atrocious mockery about Viet
Cong benevolence. This "hero"
line—incidentally being vigorously
parroted during the Moratorium
activities by the SDS,
etc.—assumes absolutely hideous
proportions before the stark
testimony of facts like the mass
Tet "executions," the massacre of
the Dak Son villagers, the V.C.

that part of the world. These
effects would develop not simply

from the policy actions of
Communist rulers (nationalistic
"Ho Chi Minh" Communists, of
course) in South Vietnam, but
also from the interpretations that
would be put upon Communist
victory—and U.S. defeat—by
statesmen throughout Asia and
the rest of the world.
The aggressive expansionist
airms of the Vietnamese
Communists are well documented.
The threat they pose to he
security of other nations have
been gravely acknowledged by
virtually all governments in
Southeast Asia. Collective security
treaties and other international
agreements maintained on a
foundation of mutual confidence
and trust constitute the bedrock
of the present international
system —and the strategic basis for
its stability. A U.S. renege in
Vietnam would be a massive blow
to U.S. diplomatic credentials, to
the present structure of
international organization, and to
the stability of the international
"nvironment (peace).
The Faces of War
The most lUcid justification of
the American commitment in
Vietnam hardly mitigates the
ugliness or the suffering of the
war. But ugliness and suffering are
hard facts of life, and avoidance
of which is neither politically nor
morally justifiable absolute. Those
for whom the immorality of
killing is the all-important fact of
the war would do well to focus
their attention upon the
instigators and primary
perpetrators of all the killing, the
heinous practitioners of terrorism
and mass murder of innocent
civilian populations. (Terrorism
means wholesale, cold-blooded
murder and torture of just any
nameless soul who happens to be
around—for psychological shock
value and political effect.)
Perhaps the grossest measure of
the cognitive perversions anti-war
people are willing to indulge for
the sake of mental relief is the
atrocious mockery about Viet
Cong benevolence. This "hero"
line—incidentally being vigorously
parroted during the Moratorium
activities by the SDS,
etc.—assumes absolutely hideous
proportions before the stark
testimony of facts like the mass
Tet "executions," the massacre of
the Dak Son villagers, the V.C.
recruiting tortures, and the
routine market slaughters of the
terrorists.
So the war is justified—where
does that leave us? It leaves us
with the responsibility to end
it—to end it as soon as possible,
with minimum acceptable loss to
human and political values. It's
semantic legerdemain to contrast
"winning" and "ending" the war.
Our basic military objectives are
to prevent the forcible take-over
of South Vietnam and to better
equip the Republic of South
Vietnam to handle its own
defense. These objectives are
presently secure. Our task now is
to end the , war without
jeopardizing these objectives. If
we succeed we will have "won".
But the threat to South
Vietnamese freedom remains
critical. The enemy is still fighting
fiercely. The North Vietnamese
battalions remain in the South
The ARVN cannot yet fend for
itself. Barring the negotiation of a
meaningful settlement, we must
struggle on.

Ruling out the abandonment of
our commitment, ruling out a
disguised surrender or peace at
any price, the President has
determined to use the utmost
powers of his office to persuade
the Communists to enter into
effective negotiations. His policy
has been more than conciliatory
in every way. The sole demand,
Nixon has emphasized, that he
will not modify is that the South
Vietnamese must be given the
simple reedom to choose their
, national institutions without
coercion. It is clear that the
Communist marauders are
uninterested in this proposition,
and that they are stalling
negotiations in hopes of American
default. Our government is trying
to convince them of the futility of
that course. So should we.
(Mike Wolf is a senior in
political science and is currently
President of the Stanford Young
Republicans.)
Fortunately, American foreign
policy is designed by the President
of the United States and not by
any horde of University
presidents, professors, students, or
other clued-in Joes. .All manner
and number of protestors,
scholars, clergyman, "liberals,"
children, and other committed
and morally authoritative people
to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Vietnam war is prudent,
desirable, just, wise, moral,
beneficial, and necessary to the
better interests of the United
States, Southeast Asia, and the
world.
That said, let me step back to
clarify what I mean by "the
Vietnam war." I mean the basic
commitment that the United
States government has made and
fulfilled in Vietnam over the
course of the past seven years or
so. I also mean all that that
commitment has directly and
necessarily entailed by way of
war, suffering, death, discomfort,
and unpleasantness.
The last three Presidents have
all understood the fundamental
validity of this proposition.
But what exactly is the
commitment that these men have
made in the name of the United
States? It would be well to
reconsider it briefly—especially in
view of all the crap that is
presently being slung around
about American purposes in
Vietnam. The United States has
pledged to defend by force of
arms the right of the South
Vietnamese people to national
self-determination. We have
pledged with our Asian allies to
support the armed forces of the
South Vietnamese Republic in
their defense of that nation
against the aggression of North
Vietnam.
No Moral Justification
Our commitment to political
freedom and national sovereignty
for South Vietnam rests upon
compelling moral and diplomatic
grounds. The abandonment of a
people to brutal totalitarianism
cannot approach moral
justification no matter how much
it is papered over with "peace,"
with "allowing them to handle
their own affairs," with "freeing
them from imperialistic
oppression," or with "delivering
them to their liberating brethren."
It is as easy for one to say, "The
U.S. can't police the world" as it
is for one to say, "I can't police
the streets"—and the results are
about the same. People might
have hoped that the horrors of
this century would weaken such
attitudes. But it remains more
popular to mythologize about the
need for peace than to accept
ultimate responsibilities to an
unknown race, or to revisit the
cavernous tombs of recent
history.
The significance of the
Communist crime in Vietnam is
yet much larger, for it entends far
beyond the immediate fate of
South Vietnam to manifold
considerations of international
politics and global defense
strategy--of which I can only
intimate the dimensions here. The
conquest of South Vietnam would
have extremely adverse effects on
the balance of political, strategic,
and economic power in Southeast
Asia—and that very definitely
means adverse effects on he
meager but critical prospects of
improving the human condition in
that part of the world. These
effects would develop not simply

from the policy actions of

made in the name of the United
States? It would be well to
reconsider it briefly—especially in
view of all the crap that is
presently being slung around
about American purposes in
Vietnam. The United States has
pledged to defend by force of
arms the right of the South
Vietnamese people to national
self-determination. We have
pledged with our Asian allies to
support the armed forces of the
South Vietnamese Republic in
their defense of that nation
against the aggression of North
Vietnam.
No Moral Justification
Our commitment to political
freedom and national sovereignty
for South Vietnam rests upon
compelling moral and diplomatic
grounds. The abandonment of a
people to brutal totalitarianism
cannot approach moral
justification no matter how much
it is papered over with "peace,"
with "allowing them to handle
their own affairs," with "freeing
them from imperialistic
oppression," or with "delivering
them to their liberating brethren."
It is as easy for one to say, "The
U.S. can't police the world" as it
is for one to say, "I can't police
the streets"—and the results are
about the same. People might
have hoped that the horrors of
this century would weaken such
attitudes. But it remains more
popular to mythologize about the
need for peace than to accept
ultimate responsibilities to an
unknown race, or to revisit the
cavernous tombs of recent
history.
The significance of the
Communist crime in Vietnam is
yet much larger, for it entends far
beyond the immediate fate of
South Vietnam to manifold
considerations of international
politics and global defense
strategy--of which I can only
intimate the dimensions here. The
conquest of South Vietnam would
have extremely adverse effects on
the balance of political, strategic,
and economic power in Southeast
Asia—and that very definitely
means adverse effects on he
meager but critical prospects of
improving the human condition in
that part of the world. These
effects would develop not simply

from the policy actions of
Communist rulers (nationalistic
"Ho Chi Minh" Communists, of
course) in South Vietnam, but
also from the interpretations that
would be put upon Communist
victory—and U.S. defeat—by
statesmen throughout Asia and
the rest of the world.
The aggressive expansionist
airms of the Vietnamese
Communists are well documented.
The threat they pose to he
security of other nations have
been gravely acknowledged by
virtually all governments in
Southeast Asia. Collective security
treaties and other international
agreements maintained on a
foundation of mutual confidence
and trust constitute the bedrock
of the present international
system —and the strategic basis for
its stability. A U.S. renege in
Vietnam would be a massive blow
to U.S. diplomatic credentials, to
the present structure of
international organization, and to
the stability of the international
"nvironment (peace).
The Faces of War
The most lUcid justification of
the American commitment in
Vietnam hardly mitigates the
ugliness or the suffering of the
war. But ugliness and suffering are
hard facts of life, and avoidance
of which is neither politically nor
morally justifiable absolute. Those
for whom the immorality of
killing is the all-important fact of
the war would do well to focus
their attention upon the
instigators and primary
perpetrators of all the killing, the
heinous practitioners of terrorism
and mass murder of innocent
civilian populations. (Terrorism
means wholesale, cold-blooded
murder and torture of just any
nameless soul who happens to be
around—for psychological shock
value and political effect.)
Perhaps the grossest measure of
the cognitive perversions anti-war
people are willing to indulge for
the sake of mental relief is the
atrocious mockery about Viet
Cong benevolence. This "hero"
line—incidentally being vigorously
parroted during the Moratorium
activities by the SDS,
etc.—assumes absolutely hideous
proportions before the stark
testimony of facts like the mass
Tet "executions," the massacre of
the Dak Son villagers, the V.C.
recruiting tortures, and the
routine market slaughters of the
terrorists.
So the war is justified—where
does that leave us? It leaves us
with the responsibility to end
it—to end it as soon as possible,
with minimum acceptable loss to
human and political values. It's
semantic legerdemain to contrast
"winning" and "ending" the war.
Our basic military objectives are
to prevent the forcible take-over
of South Vietnam and to better
equip the Republic of South
Vietnam to handle its own
defense. These objectives are
presently secure. Our task now is
to end the , war without
jeopardizing these objectives. If
we succeed we will have "won".
But the threat to South
Vietnamese freedom remains
critical. The enemy is still fighting
fiercely. The North Vietnamese
battalions remain in the South
The ARVN cannot yet fend for
itself. Barring the negotiation of a
meaningful settlement, we must
struggle on.

Ruling out the abandonment of
our commitment, ruling out a
disguised surrender or peace at
any price, the President has
determined to use the utmost
powers of his office to persuade
the Communists to enter into
effective negotiations. His policy
has been more than conciliatory
in every way. The sole demand,
Nixon has emphasized, that he
will not modify is that the South
Vietnamese must be given the
simple reedom to choose their
, national institutions without
coercion. It is clear that the
Communist marauders are
uninterested in this proposition,
and that they are stalling
negotiations in hopes of American
default. Our government is trying
to convince them of the futility of
that course. So should we.
