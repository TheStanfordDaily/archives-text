## 'We demand 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the short period we have
been abroad this Fall, we have
come to see, from a new
perspective, the horror of what
our nation is doing in Vietnam.
We find it impossible to "defend"
our nations policy in Vietnam in
our conversations with the French
and other Europeans, and must
identify ourselves with the
ever-stronger indictment that the
rest of the world levels against
American foreign policy.
There is no longer, if there ever
was, any excuse for muting
criticism of the Nixon
Administration, which has
maneuvered itself into the same
indefensible position, and the
same implausible rhetoric, as its
predecessor. We have seen through
the deceit of one president and will
not tolerate being duped by this
new one. Accordingly, we, the
undersigned, demand that
President Nixon cease
immediately the death and
destruction his administration is
perpetrating on the innocent
people of Vietnam. We go on
record as strongly supporting the
policies and actions of the
October 15th Mobilization.
On October 15th, therefore, a
group of us will go to the
American Embassy in Paris to
present a statement expressing
that support and voicing our

outrage at the present immorality
of the United States foreign
policy.

No Longer Tolerable
Editor, THE DAILY:
In terms of the survival of life
on earth, the present decade may
well by the most critical ever
recorded. Overpopulation of the
planet by human beings is creating
increasingly dangerous conditions,
which, if allowed to expand
indefinitely will inevitably result
in transforming a world, teeming
with life, into a dead one.
Problems arising from
overpopulation are not confined
to pollution of air, water and
land, and the over exploitation of
natural resources, but include
wars motivated by need for
economic expansion and
domination. The waging of any
war includes the very real threat
that sooner or later it may
become an atomic one. The
probability is very high that an
atomic war would quickly render
the entire planet uninhabitable.
Wars can, therefore, no longer be
tolerated as acceptable devices for
settling international or national
disputes, no matter what their
motivation may be. Top priority
