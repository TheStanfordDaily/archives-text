# Shut Up
## Selwyn Mclntosh and the War 
### Art Buchwald 
W ASHINGTONâ€”When
President Nixon took his oath of
office, he asked everyone in the
United States to lower their
voices. Now he wants everyone to
shut up.
Secretary Rogers on Meet the
Press said that President Nixon
cannot negotiate a peace in Paris
because of the critics in the
United States.

There is probably a lot to be
said for this argument. It is not
generally known, but the man
most responsible for holding up
peace in Vietnam is Selwyn
Mcintosh. Selwyn Mcintosh, a
shoe salesman from Brooklyn, has
been a critic of the Vietnam war
since 1963. His outspoken
statements concerning our
involvement in that part of the
world have given aid and comfort
to Hanoi, and it is now an
undisputed fact that if Mcintosh
had kept his big mouth shut, we
would have won the war six years
ago.
Lost Opportunity
Back in 1963, the North
Vietnamese were on the ropes.
But at that moment Mcintosh
showed up with a picket sign at
the White House which said, "Get
out of Vietnam." Unfortunately,
he was photographed and the
picture was transmitted to Hanoi.
Hanoi said, "Why should we
make peace on unfavorable terms
when Mcintosh is urging the
Americans to get out?"
Bombing Resumed
In 1964 President Johnson
decided to bomb North Vietnam
to bring Hanoi to its senses. The
bombing, as everyone knows, was
extremely successful, and once
again North Vietnam was ready to
throw in the towel.
But Mcintosh wrote a letter to
his local newspaper urging the
United Statees to stop the
bombing. When the letter was
printed, a neutral diplomat sent it
to Ho Chi Minh, and Ho decided
that despite the bombing he
would stick to his guns, as Mr.
Johnson did not have the support
he claimed.
President Johnson was angered
by Mcintosh throwing the wrench
into his peace plans, and he told
intimates that Mcintosh's
criticism was treasonable and a
disgrace. To show that he wasn't
going to be intimidated by
Mcintosh, the President ordered
more troops into Vietnam.
The body counts mounted, and
military intelligence indicated that

the North Vietnamese couldn't
hold out for very much longer.
The President told Dean Rusk to
get ready to accept Hanoi's
surrender.
VC Agent at Party
Bu* Mcintosh was getting his
intelligence from the newspapers,
and these accounts differed wildly
from those of the military. So at a
large cocktail party he announced
that the military was lying about
their successes.
A Viet Cong agent happened to
be working at the party as a
waiter, and he reported what
Mcintosh had said. Ho
immediately canceled any plans
he had to meet with Dean Rusk,
and another chance for peace was
lost.
Hanoi Gets FBI Tape
A year later elections were held
in South Vietnam. The winners
were Thieu and Ky, and the losers
were jailed. This put Hanoi into a
depression until Mcintosh told a
friend on the phone that the
elections were rigged in favor of
the Thieu government. Mcintosh's
phone happened to be tapped by
the FBI, and somehow Hanoi got
a transcript of the tape. When
they read what Mcintosh had said,
Hanoi held a meeting and voted to
continue the war.
This discouraged President
Johnson so much that he decided
not to run again. Walt Rostow
bitterly accused Mcintosh of
being the one person chiefly
responsible for our disastrous
policy in Vietnam.
Nixon anil Rogers
Now President Nixon is faced
with dealing with Mcintosh. He
sent Secretary of State Rogers
personally to see Mcintosh and
beg him to hold his tongue until
some agreement could be reached
in Paris. But Mcintosh, true to
form, was out Wednesday
shouting for us to pull out of
Vietnam. The Hanoi negotiators
in Paris, who were ready to agree
to any terms, were just informed
of Mcintosh's latest protest and
have decided on the basis of it to
remain firm.
