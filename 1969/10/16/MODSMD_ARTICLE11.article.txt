## The 						REAL Issue: Student Power 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
The roal issue in the Student
Senate election is "student
power," not better student
housing, proper land usage, or (as
some of the more ambitious
would contend) getting out of
Vietnam. The issue of "student
power," that is, students having
their rightful share in the
decisions that affect this
university, has been the
underlying issue in student
elections and movements at
Stanford since David Harris was
elected ASSU president in 1966
and before.
Every student knows that most
of the faculty and administration
would be willing to sit around and
have "rational dialogue" all day
about student concerns for most
of them are truly nice men. We
contend that "rationaldialogue'Ms
fine but it will get you nowhere
unless you hold some power. The
many proposals by various
candidates, asking for low-cost
housing, larger black enrollments
etc. aim at preserving the position
of students as beggars, asking the
faculty and administration to
make changes, hoping that
"rational dialogue" will win the
day. Then the decision comes
flow 11.
This power to share in
decision-making, which rightfully
belongs to students as members of

this university, has been a long
time in coming but it has finally
begun to arrive. The job of the
new Student Senate will be to
keep the pressure on, to continue
to explore new ways to get for
students the authority that is
rightfully theirs. It should not be
a forum for supplicants.
When you are considering
candidates for the new senate,
examine how they stand on the
current issues, certainly, but also
see how they stand on the real
issue, student power, and the role
that the new senate will play in
achieving it.

• Radical Format
Editor, THE DAILY:
As anyone can easily see by
glancing through the October 9th
issue of Chaparral, that magazine
hiis clearly repudiated its
first page motto, " 'tis better to
have lived and laughed." It has
succumbed to the stereotyped
radical format supposingly having
the answers to "what's behind the
lurid headlines on campus strife"
and filling more than half iLs pages
with oh-hum reviews and
nonsense columns. Mr. Louis S.
Means, a Stanford alumnus, had
the right idea when he criticized
the newspaper (apparently to no
avail) in its letters section stating:

"We used to rate the "Harvard
Lampoon" about 3rd or 4th
behind the Chappie among
national college humor magazines.
And now . . . you wouldn't even
rank!"
Perhaps the Chaparral does
have a more useful purpose than
has been evident in its first two
publications. However, the void it
left when it switched its format
several years ago must be filled.
Stanford needs a regular,
humorous, and satirical magazine
whether it be sponsored
independently, by ASSU, or by
another organization. Surely there
must be enough frustrated wits at
Stanford who desire a chance to
express their hostilities through
creative and humorous writ-ng.
If there is a need in the
Stanford community for brilliant
exposes of student, surveys, for
exhortations to go to Saudi
Arabia to buy government
stamped hashish, and for cute
semi-nude or nude pictures of
little kids, then so be it. But in
Stanford periodicals there is an
upsetting and surprising lack of a
tabloid devoted to parody,
indirect and playful criticism, wit,
and honest humor. Isn't there
anything comical about Stanford?
Let's start with the Chaparral.

• Visual unique
Editor, THE DAILY:
Congratulations. The Stanford
Daily haf devised a means for
reviev/irg a presentation without
mentioning it. This (Stanford
Daily, October 6) is the first time
that I have seen use of a visual
technique as a critique of a
presentation. While I appreciate
the innovative effort, it is,
perhaps, a little drastic to assume
an identity between my
presentation and the philosophical
approach of United States Senator
Peter Dominick.

• Bitter rm
Editor, THE DAILY:
Ours is certainly a time of
strange juxtapositions—Reagan
and the radicals, the SDS helping
George Meany's hoys . . .and in
the Chappie, in half a page, we are
exhorted to go for pure food (in
Oakland) and impure drugs
(local). The back-to-nature idea is
fine in principle, but I'll bet the
girls are still gulping
less-than-natural estrogen tablets,
regularly.
