## Israel's War 
### Dan Snell 
Jerusalem, Oct. 6, 1969. You
don't see many "peace people"
here.
Official policy is that the raids
on Arab territory are in the long
to assure peace by assuring a
continuance of Israeli superiority.
I have been seeking varieties of
opinion on the army and the
raids, and recently I met a young
lady who also likes to talk about
pacifism, a subject which, when
clearly distinguished from
passivism, is central to me.
The girl was very blond, and
her legs were very pleasant to look
at. She spoke English with a
pleasant throaty "r" so she could
be confused with someone whose
native language is French.
"I knew a pacifist once," she
>aid. "He was a teacher in high
school during the Six-Day War.
They started shelling in the area
of the school at about 10 in the
morning, and we were in the
middle of the big examination
you take before the final
examination.
"We had been told to get down
on the floor when shells came,
and then after the first wave of
shells stopped, to go to the miglat.
(She didn't know the English
word "shelter.")
"When the shells started, we
got down, but the pacifist teacher
just left. I don't know what he
did, but he left us all alone, and
we had to go down to the miglat
by ourselves. We didn't see him
again until after the war was
over."
Fighting Nccessary
Having just gotten out of her
18 months in the army, she was
waiting for the university to
begin. I mentioned that there had
been a discussion of pacifism in
my Hebrew class that had
reflected the range of opinion in
America—some students firm
pacifists and some disgusted at
pacifism.

"Maybe it is different in the
United States," she said. "You
can afford to be a pacifist. It's like
Switzerland; the Swiss have all the
time in the world to be pacifists.
Here it is different.
"You think our boys like to go
to the army? They hate the army.
But they know they must go
because of the danger they are
in."
Paratrooper's View
Another view of one Israeli's
thinking on the defense situation
here came to me in a talk with a
paratrooper. The paratroopers are
the crack unit of the Israeli army,
and their red berets are much
respected. The paratrooper, who
said he had fought in Sinai,
Jerusalem, and Syria during the
Six-Day War, asserted that none
of his friends were "militarists."
"We do not like to fight, we do
not want to fight. But we have
to."
Then he said explicitly what I
had felt go unsaid before:
"We fight, and there will never
be another holocaust as in
Europe. We were weak then, and
you know what happened. Now
we are strong. We shall stay
strong."
And what of the stature of
aggressive "defense," will it bring
peace in the end?
He admitted he didn't know
and felt there would be more
wars.
Militarism strikes me as not
necessarily consisting of a
war-loving attitude on the part of
fighters and leaders. It can also
consist of continuous aggressive
actions by men with peaceful
intentions who have not forged
alternatives to war.
It is a militarism that cau be
understood. But it is frightening
nonetheless.

we are strong. We shall stay
strong."

aggressive "defense," will it bring
peace in the end?

and felt there would be more

Militarism strikes me as not
necessarily consisting of a
war-loving attitude on the part of
fighters and leaders. It can also
consist of continuous aggressive
actions by men with peaceful
intentions who have not forged
alternatives to war.
It is a militarism that cau be
understood. But it is frightening
nonetheless.

Jerusalem, Oct. 6, 1969. You
don't see many "peace people"
here.
Official policy is that the raids
on Arab territory are in the long
to assure peace by assuring a
continuance of Israeli superiority.
I have been seeking varieties of
opinion on the army and the
raids, and recently I met a young
lady who also likes to talk about
pacifism, a subject which, when
clearly distinguished from
passivism, is central to me.
The girl was very blond, and
her legs were very pleasant to look
at. She spoke English with a
pleasant throaty "r" so she could
be confused with someone whose
native language is French.
"I knew a pacifist once," she
>aid. "He was a teacher in high
school during the Six-Day War.
They started shelling in the area
of the school at about 10 in the
morning, and we were in the
middle of the big examination
you take before the final
examination.
"We had been told to get down
on the floor when shells came,
and then after the first wave of
shells stopped, to go to the miglat.
(She didn't know the English
word "shelter.")
"When the shells started, we
got down, but the pacifist teacher
just left. I don't know what he
did, but he left us all alone, and
we had to go down to the miglat
by ourselves. We didn't see him
again until after the war was
over."
Fighting Nccessary
Having just gotten out of her
18 months in the army, she was
waiting for the university to
begin. I mentioned that there had
been a discussion of pacifism in
my Hebrew class that had
reflected the range of opinion in
America—some students firm
pacifists and some disgusted at
pacifism.

"Maybe it is different in the
United States," she said. "You
can afford to be a pacifist. It's like
Switzerland; the Swiss have all the
time in the world to be pacifists.
Here it is different.
"You think our boys like to go
to the army? They hate the army.
But they know they must go
because of the danger they are
in."
Paratrooper's View
Another view of one Israeli's
thinking on the defense situation
here came to me in a talk with a
paratrooper. The paratroopers are
the crack unit of the Israeli army,
and their red berets are much
respected. The paratrooper, who
said he had fought in Sinai,
Jerusalem, and Syria during the
Six-Day War, asserted that none
of his friends were "militarists."
"We do not like to fight, we do
not want to fight. But we have
to."
Then he said explicitly what I
had felt go unsaid before:
"We fight, and there will never
be another holocaust as in
Europe. We were weak then, and
you know what happened. Now
we are strong. We shall stay
strong."
And what of the stature of
aggressive "defense," will it bring
