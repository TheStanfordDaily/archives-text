# Impressions
## 'H'warya!' 
### Matt Wolf 
Stanford is a friendly place. Right? Wrong. But surely, you say, one
need only step out the door to receive a friendly "Hi," or a healthy
"H'warya," or a significant "Hello." One cannot fail to notice, you
argue, the vigorous feeling of congeniality, the ever-present smLles and
the "just-plain-home" hospitality of all who attend this weekend
country club/weekday university.
And you are absolutely right. One cannot possibly ignore those
letter-perfect greetings, those candy-sweet smiles, and the hospitality
which burns with the heat of 10,000 icebergs. One also cannot
possibly avoid the incredibly intense feelings of isolation and
alienation that come to one who leaves familiar surroundings, old, real
friends, and honest relationships and bursts upon an artificial, plastic,
and superficial Stanford. Leland, I can truly say that you reak of the
stench of phoiness; that you can truly boast of the colassal sensitivity
of a toilet seat.
Plastic Women
Your dollies or "women" as they are sometimes euphemistically
called, comprise the crowning feature, the master blueprint of your
total plasticity. Yes, they say hello, and sometimes they even ask how
you are (without, of course, listening for a reply). They are cordial in
their brief exchange, never for one moment letting down their guard,
not once letting you know how they really feel, or think, nor for an
instant forgetting the 1.1 other Stanford Studs who are statistically
stalking them while they do you the favor of bestowing upon you the
gift of two minute's worth of worthless small talk. Yes, the ratio
works wonders; Sally Stanford eats it up, marvels in the euphoric
ecstasy of knowing that you are just one of the 2.1 males who are
after her body at any given instant. She can discard you at will, or she
can keep you around just long enough to inflate her already bloated
ego to new levels of elasticity and new nadirs of sensitivity. The
ice-cold shield always seems to be there, the candy coated plain
chocolate that outdoes even M/M's—it never, never melts.
No Ivory Tower
Well, Leland, I'm sorry if I've forced you to examine yourself
without your pseudo-hippie sunglasses; I'm sorry if I like to meet real
people who think real thoughts and feel real feelings. I'm sorry that I
can't play your games, no matter how hard I try. I know that I've
only been here a short while, and I know that I have met some real
people, but very few. I know that these are just first impressions, and
I'll be very glad if I'm wrong about you, because I truly hope that I
meet some people during my stay here that are not lacquered and
preserved for antiquity. There is one thing that I will say, though
Leland—after 10 days here I know tha those who say you are an Ivory
Tower are wrong. You are a platinum plated, diamond studded, silk
shrouded, plastic protrusion emanating out of San Francisco Bay far
more ostentatiously and detachedly than any ordinary, common ivory
tower university ever could.

works wonders; Sally Stanford eats it up, marvels in the euphoric
ecstasy of knowing that you are just one of the 2.1 males who are
after her body at any given instant. She can discard you at will, or she
can keep you around just long enough to inflate her already bloated
ego to new levels of elasticity and new nadirs of sensitivity. The
ice-cold shield always seems to be there, the candy coated plain
chocolate that outdoes even M/M's—it never, never melts.
No Ivory Tower
Well, Leland, I'm sorry if I've forced you to examine yourself
without your pseudo-hippie sunglasses; I'm sorry if I like to meet real
people who think real thoughts and feel real feelings. I'm sorry that I
can't play your games, no matter how hard I try. I know that I've
only been here a short while, and I know that I have met some real
people, but very few. I know that these are just first impressions, and
I'll be very glad if I'm wrong about you, because I truly hope that I
meet some people during my stay here that are not lacquered and
preserved for antiquity. There is one thing that I will say, though
Leland—after 10 days here I know tha those who say you are an Ivory
Tower are wrong. You are a platinum plated, diamond studded, silk
shrouded, plastic protrusion emanating out of San Francisco Bay far
more ostentatiously and detachedly than any ordinary, common ivory
tower university ever could.

Stanford is a friendly place. Right? Wrong. But surely, you say, one
need only step out the door to receive a friendly "Hi," or a healthy
"H'warya," or a significant "Hello." One cannot fail to notice, you
argue, the vigorous feeling of congeniality, the ever-present smLles and
the "just-plain-home" hospitality of all who attend this weekend
country club/weekday university.
And you are absolutely right. One cannot possibly ignore those
letter-perfect greetings, those candy-sweet smiles, and the hospitality
which burns with the heat of 10,000 icebergs. One also cannot
possibly avoid the incredibly intense feelings of isolation and
alienation that come to one who leaves familiar surroundings, old, real
friends, and honest relationships and bursts upon an artificial, plastic,
and superficial Stanford. Leland, I can truly say that you reak of the
stench of phoiness; that you can truly boast of the colassal sensitivity
of a toilet seat.
Plastic Women
Your dollies or "women" as they are sometimes euphemistically
called, comprise the crowning feature, the master blueprint of your
total plasticity. Yes, they say hello, and sometimes they even ask how
you are (without, of course, listening for a reply). They are cordial in
their brief exchange, never for one moment letting down their guard,
not once letting you know how they really feel, or think, nor for an
instant forgetting the 1.1 other Stanford Studs who are statistically
stalking them while they do you the favor of bestowing upon you the
gift of two minute's worth of worthless small talk. Yes, the ratio
works wonders; Sally Stanford eats it up, marvels in the euphoric
ecstasy of knowing that you are just one of the 2.1 males who are
after her body at any given instant. She can discard you at will, or she
can keep you around just long enough to inflate her already bloated
ego to new levels of elasticity and new nadirs of sensitivity. The
