# Voting System Detailed

(The Hare System is (lie method of
voting and counting ballot* which will
be used in the student Senate elections,
today and tomorrow. The following
description of how the Hare System
works if offered in the public
interest.—Ed.)
When student voters o >en their
election ballot this
Thursday and Friday, they will
find a long list of candidates for
their own constituencies (for
example, a General Studies or
Engineering), and instructions to
rank as many candidates as they
wish in order of preference.

This may seem unduly
complicated, but perhaps a few
words of explanation and advice
will help.
It is important to notice that
each person may vote only on his
section of the ballot, for
candidates in his constituency,
and not for representatives of
other constituencies.
The voter does not have to
rank all of the candidates. If he
particularly dislikes one of the
candidates, he may not wish to
rank that person at all.
Procedure Outlined
In counting the ballots, the
procedure is to eliminate the least
popular candidate one by one
until the desired number of
candidates is reached. For
example, suppose there are
twenty candidates in one
constituency and eight available
positions. Initially, only the first
choices of the voters are counted,
and each candidate is assigned a
vote count equal to the number of
ballots on which he is first choice.
Then the candidate with the
lowest vote tally is eliminated.
Each of the votes which had gone
to this candidate is reassigned to
the candidate who was ranked
highest. Then the second choice
votes are tallied and added to the
first round votes.
The candidate with the lowest
number of votes among these 19
is eliminated, and his votes go to
the candidate who ranked highest
on the second choice round.
Candidates Eliminated
This procedure is continued
until only eight candidates are
left. These are the elected
members.
This is only a rough illustration
of the counting method; there are
some complications which
develop in the actual counting,
which must be done by a
computer, but these do not affect

the basic strategy the voter should
follow.
Notice that it is to the voter's
advantage to list a sizeable
number of candidates so that his
ballot will be transfered to
another candidate if his first
perference is defeated.
Alternates Selected
Another reason /or this is the
selection of alternate members,
who will be chosen from the
candidates dropped during the
initial vote-count. The method is
the same as in the selection of
members, except that each
alternate will be assigned a rank,
and when a seat falls vacant, the
alternate of highest rank shall
succeed to that seat.
One complication in ballot
counting is worth special mention.
Suppose a voter indicates a first
choice and several others, but
leaves a gap in his ranking. For
instance, he might indicate a first,
19th, and 20th choice, but none
in between.
The computer will treat these
as the top three choices; it shifts
the 19th to second and the 20th
to third. Thus, if the voter wishes
to_ indicate that he particularly
dislikes these two candidates, he
should rank all the other
candidates ahead of them by
filling in choices 2 through 18 on
his ballot.

number of candidates so that his
ballot will be transfered to
another candidate if his first
perference is defeated.
Alternates Selected
Another reason /or this is the
selection of alternate members,
who will be chosen from the
candidates dropped during the
initial vote-count. The method is
the same as in the selection of
members, except that each
alternate will be assigned a rank,
and when a seat falls vacant, the
alternate of highest rank shall
succeed to that seat.
One complication in ballot
counting is worth special mention.
Suppose a voter indicates a first
choice and several others, but
leaves a gap in his ranking. For
instance, he might indicate a first,
19th, and 20th choice, but none
in between.
The computer will treat these
as the top three choices; it shifts
the 19th to second and the 20th
to third. Thus, if the voter wishes
to_ indicate that he particularly
dislikes these two candidates, he
should rank all the other
candidates ahead of them by
filling in choices 2 through 18 on
his ballot.

(The Hare System is (lie method of
voting and counting ballot* which will
be used in the student Senate elections,
today and tomorrow. The following
description of how the Hare System
works if offered in the public
interest.—Ed.)
When student voters o >en their
election ballot this
Thursday and Friday, they will
find a long list of candidates for
their own constituencies (for
example, a General Studies or
Engineering), and instructions to
rank as many candidates as they
wish in order of preference.

This may seem unduly
complicated, but perhaps a few
words of explanation and advice
will help.
It is important to notice that
each person may vote only on his
section of the ballot, for
candidates in his constituency,
and not for representatives of
other constituencies.
The voter does not have to
rank all of the candidates. If he
particularly dislikes one of the
candidates, he may not wish to
rank that person at all.
Procedure Outlined
In counting the ballots, the
procedure is to eliminate the least
popular candidate one by one
until the desired number of
candidates is reached. For
example, suppose there are
twenty candidates in one
constituency and eight available
positions. Initially, only the first
choices of the voters are counted,
and each candidate is assigned a
vote count equal to the number of
ballots on which he is first choice.
Then the candidate with the
lowest vote tally is eliminated.
Each of the votes which had gone
to this candidate is reassigned to
the candidate who was ranked
highest. Then the second choice
votes are tallied and added to the
first round votes.
The candidate with the lowest
number of votes among these 19
is eliminated, and his votes go to
the candidate who ranked highest
on the second choice round.
Candidates Eliminated
This procedure is continued
until only eight candidates are
left. These are the elected
members.
This is only a rough illustration
of the counting method; there are
some complications which
develop in the actual counting,
which must be done by a
computer, but these do not affect

the basic strategy the voter should
follow.
Notice that it is to the voter's
advantage to list a sizeable
number of candidates so that his
ballot will be transfered to
another candidate if his first
perference is defeated.
