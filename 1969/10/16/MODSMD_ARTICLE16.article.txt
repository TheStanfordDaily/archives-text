# Law Society Plans Environment Work

### 
The Environmental Law
Society of the Stanford School of
Law met representatives of local
civic and conservation groups this
week to consider a practical role
for the student society in dealing
with problems of environmental
quality in the Bay Area.
Representatives of the Palo
Alto Civic League, the Los Altos
Hills Association, the Committee
for Green Foothills, and the Sierra
Club each proposed roles for the
student group.
But Jim Rummonds, chairman
of the meeting, pointed out, that
the role of the Environmental
Law Society (ELS) was not to
take initiatives. "The
Environmental Law Society
doesn't actually do anything,"
said Rummonds.
He explained that ELS exists
to assist other groups and
individuals working with problems
of environmental quality and
related issues. And ELS found
itself overwhelmed by the scope
of the problems described.
Procedure A Problem
The question remaining for
ELS is how to proceed. A research
group will work through this
weekend to design a framework in
which ELS and the various local
groups could work together. The
group will meet Monday at 8 p.m.
in the Law School in an effort to
actually get to work.
ELS was formed last year by
several students who were
concerned with "the many critical
threats to our environment both
here in the Bay Area and
throughout the nation and the
world." The group found that
citizens were increasingly turning
to the judicial process for the
protection of the environment,
and saw a role for future lawyers
to contribute to the preservation
and restoration of the
environment.
Projects Considered
Projects under consideration
include research on National
Forest use policies in the
Southern Sierras, the regulation of
logging on private lands in the
Santa Cruz mountains, National
Parks wildlife control, Bay Area
air pollution, and development of
parks and recreation areas around
Bay Area Rapid Transit stations.
Most of the work considered at
the meeting centered on
researching existing and possible
park and recreation area land use
in the Palo Alto area, the area of
interest to the groups represented.

ELS, however, plans to operate
at a national level as well,
coordinating the efforts of local
and regional Environmental Law
Societies, and serving as a research
facility for federal legislation,
possibly even designing a film
policy for pollution control on
the moon. ELS claims "The sky's
the limit."
It's also one of their first
problems.
