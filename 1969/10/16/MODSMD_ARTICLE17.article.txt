# Confusion Surrounds Bail Fund
## 
### ROBERT BOLT 
A special reserve fund to
provide bail for Stanford students
was established early last year.
The ASSU fund became the
center of a minor controversy last
spring when several groups
charged that the bill was a
political deal ramrodded through
LASSU just in time to take several
hundred SRI demonstrators off
the hook.
The bill that proposed this
fund was first introduced early in
the fall quarter before any
disturbances.
Students who made use of the
bail fund evidently did so within
the procedure set up by the
LASSU bill.
When the request was made for
use of the $5,000 in the fund,

David Swift, student financial
manager, issued three promissory
notes requiring two signatures
each.
Swift was careful to state that
each note was signed by at least
one Stanford student over 21 and
that each of the three, Yale
Braunstein, Chick Fitts, and Mike
Weinstein, have sufficient
property to enable the ASSU to
regain the $5,000 by litigation if
the money is not returned within
a year after the date of its
withdrawal. The ASSU doesn't
lose on this deal—nor have they
been losing all along.
The way that the bill was set
up gives <he ASSU the authority
to take 4% off the top of any
loan.

For example, if a person or
group borrows $2,000, the bail
fund only provides $1,920 of the
amount, taking 4% off the loan.
The group or person then has a
60-day grace period in which he
can return that money, i.e.,
$2,000, without a charge of extra
interest.
It is designed to insure that
ASSU loses no money and, after a
year, actually begins to make
money.
Concerning repeal of the bail
fund bill, a move advocated by
some groups on campus, Swift
says that ASSU is not in the
bail-bond business, but that repeal
now would be too late to stop
anything, since all the fund
money is tied up in the A3M legal
act inn
