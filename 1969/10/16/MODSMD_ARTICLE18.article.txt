# Italy Discussion Set
## 
### 
Buon giorno—Welcome to
Italia, land of Sophia Loren and
Michelangelo. From the first
moment the student arrives at
Villa San Paolo, he can sense the
magic of Italy that will make his
six-month stay so memorable.
The Italian experience begins
right in the Villa. It begins with
after-dinner cappuccino from
Settimo who runs the bar and is
always ready to learn a few words
of English. It begins with getting
to know the other Stanford
students and sharing with them
your discoveries. There is always
an opportunity for stimulating
conversations with one of your
professors while waiting for a
plate of green Lasagna at Sunday
dinner.
The heart of the Renaissance is
only five minutes away by bus 11
or 17. Perhaps the magic of Italian
experience lies in the magic of the
city of Florence itself. Many of
the masterpieces which brought
new cultural awakening to all of
Europe are readily accessible to
the student. Classes in art and the
Renaissance are taught at the Villa

and aid the student in
appreciating the greatness around
him . .Prof. Alexander holds his
audiences spellbound with his
lectures on the Florentine genius,
Michelangelo.
The enthusiasm and the
friendliness of the Italian people is
not limited to the Villa or the city
of Florence, but can be
encountered all over Italy. They
are so pleased when someone tries
to speak their language and will
listen with extraordinary patience
while a student struggles with a
sentence. The people have a
genius for finding logic in chaos
and only the Italians in their own
inimitable way could make sense
of a nine-party political system.
Once this unique character of
Italy takes root you will find
yourself saying, "This is my
Florence, this is my Italy!"
Tonight at 7:30 in the Branner
Lounge the Overseas Campus
Board will show slides of Florence
and discuss the various aspects of
Stanford in Italy. Anyone who is
interested is encouraged to attend
this meeting.


BLACK CREATIVITY comes to the Dinkelspiel Auditorium stage this weekend

presentation created by Stanford students. Working above ont he production are
dance choreographer Shirley Allen and musical director Woodi Webb. See

new cultural awakening to all of
Europe are readily accessible to
the student. Classes in art and the
Renaissance are taught at the Villa

and aid the student in
appreciating the greatness around
him . .Prof. Alexander holds his
audiences spellbound with his
lectures on the Florentine genius,
Michelangelo.
The enthusiasm and the
friendliness of the Italian people is
not limited to the Villa or the city
of Florence, but can be
encountered all over Italy. They
are so pleased when someone tries
to speak their language and will
listen with extraordinary patience
while a student struggles with a
sentence. The people have a
genius for finding logic in chaos
and only the Italians in their own
inimitable way could make sense
of a nine-party political system.
Once this unique character of
Italy takes root you will find
yourself saying, "This is my
Florence, this is my Italy!"
Tonight at 7:30 in the Branner
Lounge the Overseas Campus
Board will show slides of Florence
and discuss the various aspects of
Stanford in Italy. Anyone who is
interested is encouraged to attend
this meeting.
