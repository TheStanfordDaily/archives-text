# Student Find Loans Scarce

### BOB LITTERMAN 
Loan-seeking college students
are finding tight money
conditions a difficult problem this
year. Despite recent Congressional
agreement on the Guaranteed
Student Loan program (GLP),
banks are still reluctant to
appropriate money for the college
needs.
There simply isn't enough
capital to go around. Federal
monetary policy directed at
slowing inflation this past year has
sharply curtailed the amount of
money available for loans.
Although the change from the
original fixed 7 per cent
guaranteed interest rate to a
bonus rate of up to 10 per cent
has made the student loan more
feasible, it has not created the
money necessary to make them
available.
The problem is compounded
by the fact that cuts have been
made this year in several other
federal aid programs, according to
Dr. Robert Huff of the Stanford
Financial Aid Department.
Loans Pending
Last year at Stanford 660
students applied for loans under
the GLP provisions; there were
480 awards totaling $495,000.
Currently, only 126 students have
reported success in their search
for loans. However, there is still a
large backlog of loans being
processed.
According to Dr. Huff, it is still
not exactly clear what the loan
situation will be this year. But he
says,"It definitely is a problem."
Bank of America, the largest
supplier of student loans, will lend
more money this year than ever
before. However, the rate of
increase is smaller than in past
years as with most banks, added
restrictions are being applied in
screening applicants.

Several problems have
developed in the program
seriously decreasing its
effectiveness. The GLP originally
envisioned by President Johnson
three years ago would have been
aimed at middle income families,
especially those with two or more
members attending school at the
same time. However, as the
program went into effect, most
banks placed a $15,000 maximum
limit on the applicant's family
income, cutting out many
potential loan seekers.
Another problem has arisen
because most banks make the loan
conditional on agreement by a
student or his family to do other
business there. Many banks
require accounts to be opened six
months before a loan will be
made.
The Kennedy amendment to
the recent legislature, which would
have abolished this practice, was
not approved by Congress.
Small Profit
Banks, on the other hand, have
not been very happy about these
loans either. With the 7 per cent
interest rate in effect, they were
actually losing money. The 10 per
cent rate makes the loans more
palatable, but still not very
profitable.
Also bankers complain of
excessive paperwork and
government red tape. In addition,
money for student loans is tied up
at a fixed interest rate for several
years as opposed to the quick
return rate of most other types of
loans.
According to senior
Vice-President Robert Syer, of the
Bank of America, "These loans
have the lowest yield of any of
our $2.5 billion in consumer
credit."

Although the student loan
problem will probably improve
somewhat this year, there will be
no solution until general money
conditions ease.
Vietnam, federal spending
overseas, and the imbalance of
payments due primarily to
military expenses are the primary
causes of the present tight money
problem.
However, with problems such
as overpopulation, pollution, and
underdeveloped countries
demanding more and more
capital, the money shortage will
probably be with us indefinitely.
