# Moratorium Protest Sweeps Nation 8000 Jam Stanford Anti-War Rally
## Few Attend Class 
### 
Capping a day of canvassing
and marching, 8000 Moratorium
participants gathered last night on
campus in rallies of
unprecedented size.
About 80 percent of the
student body stayed away from
class yesterday, with more than
2000 leafletting in shopping
centers, on trains and door to
door. More than 5000 students
and area residents marched at
noon in Palo Alto's largest
anti-war demonstration to date.
However, the cynics who
contend that Stanford students
are out of touch with the people
received at least partial
confirmation of their suspicions.
Volunteers who canvassed in
yesterday's first Vietnam
Moratorium Day met with
generally polite but apathetic
responses. Most area residents
revealed few details of their own
positions.
Many citizens of the world
beyond Stanford opposed the war
but believed President Nixon
would be able to end it in the
next few months. Some called
students "Commie dupes" and
"agents of Hanoi."
War Must End
On the home campus, students
at lectures, seminars and
discussion groups achieved a near
consensus: the war must end or
the consequences will be
disastrous for America and the
world.
Law students presented a
petition to the federal attorney in
San Francisco demanding the end
of an "illegal war."
Business students attended
seminars that questioned the
benefits the war is bestowing on
the nation. One hundred business
students signed a supporting Sen.
George McGovern's resolution to
pull all troops out bv the end of
1970.
Foreign students at the
International Center attacked
United States policies, while
medical students heard a lecture
and saw a film showing the
medical catastrophe American

firepower has wreaked on
Vietnamese civilians.
Industrial Park Leaflets
The SDS leafleted employees
at Industrial Park firms which do
significant business with the
Defense Department. The workers
were in the main polite but
refused to leave work for the day
to support the Moratorium. An
attempt to see William Hewlett of
Hewlett-Packard electronics was
rebuffed by security guards.
In Palo Alto, a noon march
down University Ave. in the city's
downtown drew 5,000 marchers,
five times the number that had
participated in any previous peace
march. There was only one arrest,
Tim Haight, a former Daily
columnist arrested for failure to
disperse, inciting to riot,
disturbing the peace, and trespass.
These charges arose out of last
year's anti-SRI demonstration.
More than 50 students passed
out leaflets at the San Francisco
airport. Many of the people
refused to accept them. Travelers
arriving from Chicago complained
that they had been already
leafletted at the Chicago airport.
Stanford-in-France overseas
campus presented a petition to
the Assistant Ambassador in Paris
yesterday. They discussed the war
with him and ended up staying 30
minutes longer than planned. The
petition was signed by nearly all
the students at the campus.
Overseas Support
Stanford-in-Italy sent a
telegram of support signed by 49
students to the Moratorium
committee. The German and
Austrian campuses planned a
demonstration and vigil
respectively at the American
embassies in their countries.
An informal survey conducted
by the Stanford News Service
indicated the overall impact of the
Moratorium was to reduce
attendance to 20 percent of
normal.
The figure of an 80 percent
effective boycott was determined
bv comparing the total number of
