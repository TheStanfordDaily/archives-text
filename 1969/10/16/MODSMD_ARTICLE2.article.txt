# Moratorium Protest Sweeps Nation 8000 Jam Stanford Anti-War Rally
## Few Attend Class 
### 
Capping a day of canvassing
and marching, 8000 Moratorium
participants gathered last night on
campus in rallies of
unprecedented size.
About 80 percent of the
student body stayed away from
class yesterday, with more than
2000 leafletting in shopping
centers, on trains and door to
door. More than 5000 students
and area residents marched at
noon in Palo Alto's largest
anti-war demonstration to date.
However, the cynics who
contend that Stanford students
are out of touch with the people
received at least partial
confirmation of their suspicions.
Volunteers who canvassed in
yesterday's first Vietnam
Moratorium Day met with
generally polite but apathetic
responses. Most area residents
revealed few details of their own
positions.
Many citizens of the world
beyond Stanford opposed the war
but believed President Nixon
would be able to end it in the
next few months. Some called
students "Commie dupes" and
"agents of Hanoi."
War Must End
On the home campus, students
at lectures, seminars and
discussion groups achieved a near
consensus: the war must end or
the consequences will be
disastrous for America and the
world.
Law students presented a
petition to the federal attorney in
San Francisco demanding the end
of an "illegal war."
Business students attended
seminars that questioned the
benefits the war is bestowing on
the nation. One hundred business
students signed a supporting Sen.
George McGovern's resolution to
pull all troops out bv the end of
1970.
Foreign students at the
International Center attacked
United States policies, while
medical students heard a lecture
and saw a film showing the
medical catastrophe American

firepower has wreaked on
Vietnamese civilians.
Industrial Park Leaflets
The SDS leafleted employees
at Industrial Park firms which do
significant business with the
Defense Department. The workers
were in the main polite but
refused to leave work for the day
to support the Moratorium. An
attempt to see William Hewlett of
Hewlett-Packard electronics was
rebuffed by security guards.
In Palo Alto, a noon march
down University Ave. in the city's
downtown drew 5,000 marchers,
five times the number that had
participated in any previous peace
march. There was only one arrest,
Tim Haight, a former Daily
columnist arrested for failure to
disperse, inciting to riot,
disturbing the peace, and trespass.
These charges arose out of last
year's anti-SRI demonstration.
More than 50 students passed
out leaflets at the San Francisco
airport. Many of the people
refused to accept them. Travelers
arriving from Chicago complained
that they had been already
leafletted at the Chicago airport.
Stanford-in-France overseas
campus presented a petition to
the Assistant Ambassador in Paris
yesterday. They discussed the war
with him and ended up staying 30
minutes longer than planned. The
petition was signed by nearly all
the students at the campus.
Overseas Support
Stanford-in-Italy sent a
telegram of support signed by 49
students to the Moratorium
committee. The German and
Austrian campuses planned a
demonstration and vigil
respectively at the American
embassies in their countries.
An informal survey conducted
by the Stanford News Service
indicated the overall impact of the
Moratorium was to reduce
attendance to 20 percent of
normal.
The figure of an 80 percent
effective boycott was determined
bv comparing the total number of

IN SPITE OF RAlN—Almost halt' of the 8000 strong crowd clustered outside
Memorial Auditorium and Memorial Church List night to hear Moratorium
speakers.
Baton Rouge planted small white
crosses on the ROTC parade
grounds. They said the crosses
symbolized the nearly 40,000
Americans killed in Vietnam.
Twenty persons stood before a
Vietnam war memorial on the
Wyoming University campus in
Laramie throughout the night
despite three inches of snow and
15-degree temperatures.
Observances generally began in
a low-key manner. There was a
brief flurry of excitement in
Portland, Ore., when about 400
college-age youths blocked the
entrance to the armed forces
induction center. A dozen
helmeted police clashed with the
demonstrators and one man was
seized.
"Capitulation "
Motorists opposing the
demonstrations drove with their
headlights on during daylight to
protest what a San Diego veterans
.commander called "disruptive
actions keyed toward immediate
capitulation to the Communist
demand."
People participating in the
Vietnam Moratorium "are playing
into the hands of the people
whose business it is to kill
American fighting men," declared
Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz. in a
speech to the California
Federation of Republican Women
in Anaheim.
A Life A Step
"Every step the marchers take
will cost one American life on the
battlefield," said Raymond A.
Gallagher, national commander of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars in a
Sacramento interview.
"Student protests have led to
death, destruction and
injury ... If the silent majority
does not speak out, the vocal
minority will most certainly take
over all that is meaningful in this
country of ours," he continued.
Treason
Participants in Moratorium
activities "commit treason by
supporting our avowed enemies,"

said Bob Walters, Los Angeles
County chairman for the
American Independent Party,
which supported former Alabama
Gov. George Wallace for president
last year.
Demonstrations will be a
"devastating blow" to GI morale,
said Gordon Hoopes, spokesman
for the county's largest group of
Young Republicans. He called for
resumption of bombing along
North Vietnamese supplv routes.
Reagan Denounces Protest
At a Tuesday night fund raising
dinner for the Eisenhower
College, President Nixon heard
Gov. Ronald Reagan of California
denounce the demonstrations.
"Parades are held today in the
name of peace," the governor
said, "but some of those who
march carry the flag of a nation
that has killed almost 40,000 of
our young men."
Flag Draped Busses
Merritt H. Taylor, Jr.,
president of the Philadelphia
Suburban Transportation Co.,
draped his buses and trolleys with
U.S. flags to express "a feeling of
patriotism."
"I just think it's time the
unheard element makes itself
heard. We ought to stand behind
our country and stop complaining
so much," he said.
W hit tier Students Active
In California, students at
President Nixon's alma mater
wore armbands demanding "Out
of Vietnam Now!" and veterans
groups declared that
demonstrations cast. GI lives as
Californians commemorated
Moratorium Day today sharply
divided over the Vietnam
War—target of the day's protest.
Tens of thousands of students
at scores of schools observed the
day. In Northern California, heavy
rain interfered with activities.
Some schools let classes out. At
others, students simply cut
classes.
Miniskirted and levi-togged
demonstrators .it. 2,140-student
Whittier College, where Nixon was

graduated 35 years ago, heard
student president Lionel Pointer,
21, a Negro from Houston, Tex.,
call for "an immediate end to
United States involvement in
Vietnam."
Pounding rain from the Pacific
Ocean put a damper on
Moratorium activities in the San
Francisco Bay Area. About 100
persons picketed entrances to
28,000-student University of
California at Berkeley. The
marchers included a half-dozen
blacks.
Others read the names of war
dead on steps of the Berkeley
Public Library a few blocks away.
S.F. State Picketed
A handful of marchers
picketed 18,000-student San
Francisco State College. Forty
county probation officers
picketed the San Francisco federal
building. About a hundred
rain-drenched marchers walked
twice across the Golden Gate
Bridge during peak commuter
traffic.
The demonstrators distributed
leaflets saying "No Business as
Usual," "Peace Officers for
Peace," "Arrest War," and
"Rehabilitate Nixon." One
pregnant women carried a sign
declaring, "Pregnant People Need
Peace."
At the University of Southern
California, about 5,000 persons
gathered for speeches and a rally
in i a parking lot next to
Exposition Park. Two policeman
directed traffic.
Sen, Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
told a USC rally "the safety of
our men should be the only
condition governing our rate of
withdrawal" from Vietnam.
About 200 students from the
six Claremont colleges passed out
leaflets to workers at a General
Dynamics plant in Pomona, which
makes missiles for the Navy. The
workers accepted the leaflets,
which asked them to strike, but
all continued into the plant.
Fresno Slate Vigils
Several hundred students

gathered at Fresno State College
for a 90-minute vigil, then
paraded nine miles to the
courthouse for a three-hour vigil.
They were joined by housewives
and clergymen. Other students
attended from Fresno City
College and Pacific College.
British Protest
Moratorium Day was also
observed in other parts of the
world. Forty members of the
British Parliament signed a letter
demanding the withdrawal of
American forces from Vietnam. In
Dublin, Irish protestors occupied
the American Express Office.
Canadians demonstrated
outside the U.S. Embassy in
Ottawa and students find
professors, some carrying home
made Viet Cong flags, staged a
five mile protest march at the
University of Waterloo in
Kitchener, Ont.
In several capitals around the
world, students, many of them
Americans, staged marches,
debates and disciplined
demonstrations in sympathy with
the Vietnam Moratorium under
way in the United States.
No Violence
No violence was reported
although many U.S. embassies
were under heavier-than-usual
guard.
About 400 demonstrators,
most of them Americans,
protested with songs in front of
the U.S. Embassy in London.
Stanford-in-Bri tain students
participated.
American Rhodes Scholars at
Oxford University delivered
petitions to the London Embassy.
Theirs were among dozens of
antiwar letters turned over to
embassy officials.
About 150 young Americans
crowded into the courtyard of the
U.S. Embassy in Paris, closely
guarded by French police. Robert
Frowick, the mission's political
officer, said he received 171
antiwar petitions in six hours,
most of them from American
stud en t.s.
