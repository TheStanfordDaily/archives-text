# 100 Students Leaflet Trains
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Railroads, America's transpor
tation wasteland, yesterday be
came the carrier of Vietnam
debate as more than 100 Stanford
students slogged through early
Moratorium morning downpours
to confront San Francisco bound
commuters with issues of war and
peace.
"Sit down and quit bothering
the passengers or get off the
train," barked a greying
conductor on the 7:41 from Palo
Alto. The student, clutching a
stack of soggy Moratorium
leaflets, passively accepted the
command. She quickly returned
to activity when the conductor
disappeared.
Seven students travelled on the
7:41, distributing leaflets to most
passengers and engaging several
dozen in conversation. The
pattern was repeated all morning
as students boarded trains Irom
6:30 to 9 a.m.
Some were more successful
than others. One group boarding
at Atherton took the first train
that stopped, not realizing its final
destination was San Jose. They
embarrassedly exited in Palo Alto
to reverse directions.
Leafleting Begins
Once coats and umbrellas were
left to drip on the nearest seat,
leafleting and talk began. "Is that
peace stuff?" asked a
pre-occupied commuter.
"Yes," replied the student.
"Damn it! " shouted the man.
His response was unusually
strong. Most commuters politely
accepted the literature, either
nodding agreement or quitely
expressing dissent. Molly Steele, a
senior and organizer of the train
dialogue strategy, murmered, "I
feel like getting up and screaming.
Don't they know a war is going
on?"
As the 7:41 rolled North,
vacant seats vanished and crowded

aisles forced leafleters into
compartments between trains to
leaflet on station platforms. A few
hearty commuters rode outside
for fresh air and the discussion
continued between gusts of wind
and the hammering staccato of
steel wheels on steel track.
Marcia Faggioli, a junior,
handed a leaflet to a tall, bracing
commuter leaning against the
rusted side of a coach. He sullenly
accepted the offering and scanned
it for a moment. "Do you support
the demonstration?" asked Miss
Faggioli.
"Yeah. I can't ride with war
anymore." He stopped abruptly.
"Well, do you think we should
pull out immediately?"
The man looked deadly serious
as he considered an answer. "I just
got out of the Navy. I thought we
should never have gotten into
Vietnam, but who listens to you
in the Navy? Yeah, I'm for the
Moratorium. Here, give me some
more material. I'd get a kick out
of sending it to some buddies
based in Hawaii."
Important Words
Towns rapidly passed
outside—Menlo Park, Redwood
City, San Mateo, Burlingame, but
some conversations left an
indelible impact.
"My son was in Vietnam. He
died there." The old man silently
turned and stared out the rain
smeared window as the train
clattered on toward the city.
Earlier in the morning,
students had been worried that
counter-demonstrations would
mar their train efforts. Miss Steele
had received a threat from"The
American Nazi Party" the caller
stated. He explained that the Palo
Alto Southern Pacific station
would be bombed. No
anti-Moratorium activity
occurred.

accepted the offering and scanned
it for a moment. "Do you support
the demonstration?" asked Miss
Faggioli.
"Yeah. I can't ride with war
anymore." He stopped abruptly.
"Well, do you think we should
pull out immediately?"
The man looked deadly serious
as he considered an answer. "I just
got out of the Navy. I thought we
should never have gotten into
Vietnam, but who listens to you
in the Navy? Yeah, I'm for the
Moratorium. Here, give me some
more material. I'd get a kick out
of sending it to some buddies
based in Hawaii."

Towns rapidly passed
outside—Menlo Park, Redwood
City, San Mateo, Burlingame, but
some conversations left an
indelible impact.
"My son was in Vietnam. He
died there." The old man silently
turned and stared out the rain
smeared window as the train
clattered on toward the city.
Earlier in the morning,
students had been worried that
counter-demonstrations would
mar their train efforts. Miss Steele
had received a threat from"The
American Nazi Party" the caller
stated. He explained that the Palo
Alto Southern Pacific station
would be bombed. No
anti-Moratorium activity
occurred.
Railroads, America's transpor
tation wasteland, yesterday be
came the carrier of Vietnam
debate as more than 100 Stanford
students slogged through early
Moratorium morning downpours
to confront San Francisco bound
commuters with issues of war and
peace.
"Sit down and quit bothering
the passengers or get off the
train," barked a greying
conductor on the 7:41 from Palo
Alto. The student, clutching a
stack of soggy Moratorium
leaflets, passively accepted the
command. She quickly returned
to activity when the conductor
disappeared.
Seven students travelled on the
7:41, distributing leaflets to most
passengers and engaging several
dozen in conversation. The
pattern was repeated all morning
as students boarded trains Irom
6:30 to 9 a.m.
Some were more successful
than others. One group boarding
at Atherton took the first train
that stopped, not realizing its final
destination was San Jose. They
embarrassedly exited in Palo Alto
to reverse directions.
Leafleting Begins
Once coats and umbrellas were
left to drip on the nearest seat,
leafleting and talk began. "Is that
peace stuff?" asked a
pre-occupied commuter.
"Yes," replied the student.
"Damn it! " shouted the man.
His response was unusually
strong. Most commuters politely
accepted the literature, either
nodding agreement or quitely
expressing dissent. Molly Steele, a
senior and organizer of the train
dialogue strategy, murmered, "I
feel like getting up and screaming.
Don't they know a war is going
on?"
As the 7:41 rolled North,
vacant seats vanished and crowded

aisles forced leafleters into
compartments between trains to
leaflet on station platforms. A few
hearty commuters rode outside
for fresh air and the discussion
continued between gusts of wind
and the hammering staccato of
steel wheels on steel track.
Marcia Faggioli, a junior,
handed a leaflet to a tall, bracing
commuter leaning against the
rusted side of a coach. He sullenly
accepted the offering and scanned
it for a moment. "Do you support
the demonstration?" asked Miss
Faggioli.
"Yeah. I can't ride with war
anymore." He stopped abruptly.
