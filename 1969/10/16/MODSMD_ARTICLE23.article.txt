# Moratorium Activities Staged In San Francisco, Berkeley
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
SAN FRANCISCO —
Moratorium activities in the city
centered at the Federal Building
as off-and-on rainfall apparently
deterod many prople from joining
in the Vietnam protest elsewhere
in the city.
At the Federal Building
demonstration more than 3,000
stood in the rain for more than
three hours to hear speeches by
Carleton Goodlet of the Sun
Reporter, David Hilliard of the
Black Panthers, and others.
But in the downtown financial
area picketing was spotty with
occasional Moratorium workers
on street corners passing out
leaflets and talking to passers-by.
i A spokesman for the American
Friends Service Committee, one
of the groups that organized

demonstrations in the city, stated,
"The rain persuaded many
families not to come downtown
and instead stay in their
neighborhoods, I think. Exactly
how many are doing this is
impossible to guess."
Orderly, Friendly
At the Federal Buidling rally
demonstrators were orderly and
very friendly, sharing food and
umbrellas. The police remained
near their cars and chatted with
demonstrators.
The large crowd spilled out
into the blocked-off street in
front of the building, and several
hundred workers came to the
windows of neighboring buildings
to watch the rally.
The crowd at the rally was
made up of both high school and
college students as well as many

adults. A minor incident occured
when several demonstrators
attempted to lower the flag to
half mast, but police quickly
moved in to prevent it.

At San Francisco State College
there was little Moratorium
activity. Only about forty small
wooden crosses out of more than
a thousand remained standing on
the main lawn where they had
been placed several days ago.
Earlier in the morning there
was a rally in front of the
Selective Service center near the
Civic Center. This group,
numbering over 2,000, then
marched the few blocks to the
Federal Building to join the
protest there.
