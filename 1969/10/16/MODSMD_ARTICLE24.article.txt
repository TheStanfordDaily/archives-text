## Chicanos Greeted Warmly 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Warmed by coffee and friendly
responses, about 35 students from
MECHA, an organization of
Chicano students at Stanford,
spent yesterday canvassing in
Castro City and other Chicano
areas in Mountain View.
There was little or no response
to canvassers in East Palo Alto, as
only a handful of students went
there.
The Chicano students, using
the Mountain View home of Felix
Guiterrez, Stanford's Assistant
Dean of Students, as their
headquarters, started their efforts
at nine yesterday morning. By
noontime they had completely
covered the six-block diameter of
Castro City, according to Gary
Cavasos, a student canvasser.
"The consensus of opinion was
that war was absurd," said
Cavasos, discussing the reaction in
the homes he visited. "Most
people had some immediate

personal knowledge of the war—in
their own family or someone's
they knew of there had been
death or injury."
No "Moralistic Weighing"
Explaining the approach which
the canvassers took, Cavasos said,
"We didn't have to do any
moralistic weighing. We said our
sons, brothers and fathers were
dying in a war, and it wasn't our
choice."
When the Castro City district
had been covered, canvassers
moved into the Washington,
Jackson, and Rex Manor sections
of Mountain View, sometimes
duplicating areas which had
already been canvassed.
Of the people approached,
Cavasos said that the students
encountered only two hostile
reactions. "At most of the places
we went to it was more than a
one-minute door affair," Cavasos
said.

"A lot of people were asked to
pray," he said. "Praying about
something shows it means a lot to
you."
Two lonely leafleters stood in
front of the large Littleman's
supermarket in Nairobi Village in
East Palo Alto's shopping center
yesterday afternoon, handing out
Moratorium material to shoppers
hurrying by.
"I've been here for about an
hour and a half, and nearly
everyone's taken the leaflets,"
said Harold Boyd, a Palo Alto
resident who decided to work
after hearing at yesterday's BSU
meeting that individual canvassers
might be going into East Palo
Alto.
Petition For Nivon
Around the corner from Boyd
was a table covered with
Moratorium literature and a
petition addressed to President

Nixon which began, "We, the
undersigned citizens of the United
States, urge you to admit that the
presence of American soldiers in
Vietnam has been an apalling
mistake.
Those black students who went
to East Palo Alto visited
Ravenswood High School and a
few homes passing out leaflets for
the Black Panther Party,
according to Dave Edwards, a
Black Students' Union (BSU)
leader. The BSU did not
coordinate any canvassing.
"We weren't organized due to
time, classes, illness, etc.," said
Edwards.
Tony Rogers, editor of the
BSU's newspaper, The Colonist,
said succinctly "Why do I need to
tell them what they know
already?"
Leo Bazile, chairman of
Stanford's BSU, could not be
reached for comment.

"We weren't organized due to
time, classes, illness, etc.," said
Edwards.
Tony Rogers, editor of the
BSU's newspaper, The Colonist,
said succinctly "Why do I need to
tell them what they know
already?"
Leo Bazile, chairman of
Stanford's BSU, could not be
reached for comment.
Warmed by coffee and friendly
responses, about 35 students from
MECHA, an organization of
Chicano students at Stanford,
spent yesterday canvassing in
Castro City and other Chicano
areas in Mountain View.
There was little or no response
to canvassers in East Palo Alto, as
only a handful of students went
there.
The Chicano students, using
the Mountain View home of Felix
Guiterrez, Stanford's Assistant
Dean of Students, as their
headquarters, started their efforts
at nine yesterday morning. By
noontime they had completely
covered the six-block diameter of
Castro City, according to Gary
Cavasos, a student canvasser.
"The consensus of opinion was
that war was absurd," said
Cavasos, discussing the reaction in
the homes he visited. "Most
people had some immediate

personal knowledge of the war—in
their own family or someone's
they knew of there had been
death or injury."
No "Moralistic Weighing"
Explaining the approach which
the canvassers took, Cavasos said,
"We didn't have to do any
moralistic weighing. We said our
sons, brothers and fathers were
dying in a war, and it wasn't our
choice."
When the Castro City district
had been covered, canvassers
moved into the Washington,
Jackson, and Rex Manor sections
of Mountain View, sometimes
duplicating areas which had
already been canvassed.
Of the people approached,
Cavasos said that the students
encountered only two hostile
reactions. "At most of the places
we went to it was more than a
one-minute door affair," Cavasos
said.

"A lot of people were asked to
pray," he said. "Praying about
something shows it means a lot to
you."
Two lonely leafleters stood in
front of the large Littleman's
supermarket in Nairobi Village in
East Palo Alto's shopping center
yesterday afternoon, handing out
Moratorium material to shoppers
hurrying by.
"I've been here for about an
hour and a half, and nearly
everyone's taken the leaflets,"
said Harold Boyd, a Palo Alto
resident who decided to work
after hearing at yesterday's BSU
meeting that individual canvassers
might be going into East Palo
Alto.
Petition For Nivon
Around the corner from Boyd
was a table covered with
Moratorium literature and a
petition addressed to President

Nixon which began, "We, the
undersigned citizens of the United
States, urge you to admit that the
presence of American soldiers in
Vietnam has been an apalling
mistake.
Those black students who went
to East Palo Alto visited
Ravenswood High School and a
few homes passing out leaflets for
the Black Panther Party,
according to Dave Edwards, a
Black Students' Union (BSU)
leader. The BSU did not
coordinate any canvassing.
