# Mid-Peninsula Canvassed
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
As scores of last-minute
volunteers swamped the ASSU
Moratorium headquarters, more
than 2,000 Stanford students and
faculty members fanned out over
the entire Mid peninsula area
yesterday to distribute leaflets
urging an immediate withdrawal
of American troops from
Vietnam.
In the largest outpouring of
voluntary support for organized
political activity in University
history, Moratorium coordinators
estimated that 1,300 students
were canvassing homes while 500
were leafleting shopping centers
from Hillsdale to Sunnyvale.
Approximately 100 students
boarded commuter trains during
the morning rush hour and
another 60 distributed flyers to
employees of four Industrial Park
firms as they arrived for work.
About 35 Chicano students
canvassed the Castro City area of
Mountain View, before expanding
their activities to Chicano areas of
Redwood City and San Jose.
Although good responses
outnumber the bad, the major
problem faced by the canvassers
was public indifference or
unwillingness to work actively for
the war's end, according to
Moratorium coordinator Rich
Luhring.
Apathy Large
Apathy was the main response
among commuters on the morning
trains to San Francisco. Not many
passengers would talk with the
Moratorium workers; but those
who did were generally polite and
open-minded, according to several
students who rode the trains.
Stanford students canvassing in
Los Altos and Mountain View

generally found sympathy and
apathy to be the predominant
community reactions to the
Moratorium, according to
freshman Bob Litterman.
Litterman explained that there
were a few slammed doors, but
generally he found the people
quite willing to listen to what the
canvassers had to say.
Support Voiced
Several of the people
Litterman talked to expressed
support for the Moratorium
concept, but felt that it would
have little effect on government
policy.
Student canvassers working
door-to-door in Menlo Park
reported favorable responses from
young adults, but indifference and
rejection from older citizens.
"The younger people took me
into their house, asked questions
about legislation they could
support and other ways they
could join in on the effort,"
reported Felicity Barringer,
Stanford sophomore.
Adults IndiHereriit
For the most part she felt that
the older people to whom she
spoke "weren't so much hostile as
they were indifferent or felt too
uninformed to act."
Miss Barringer estimated that
about one-quarter of the people
she encountered refused to talk or
take any literature.
Students working in Sunnyvale
found the residents generally
favorable to Moratorium
canvassers. Sophomore Frank
Miller said that approximately 75
percent of the people found at
home expressed support for the
Moratorium and declared their
desire for a rapid withdrawal of
American troops from Vietnam.
Many Sunnyvale residents
indicated that they intended to
send telegrams to President N'xon
and to their congressman
expressing dissatisfaction with the
slow rate of withdrawal from
Vietnam.
Hostility M et
Canvassers in several areas,
however, encountered open
hostility.
John Coonrod, working 'n a
section of Los Altos near the
business district, declared, "It was
amazing the bad reception many
canvassers received."
He explained that many of the
Los Altos residents would not
take a stand on the war, but were
convinced that the Moratorium
was treasonous. One woman
declared, "Communists can
always come up with 'statistics' to
refute the administration."
Workers in Atherton
frequently found themselves
unable to get past the maid to
speak to the homeowner. Others
were forced to discuss the war
over intercoms with invisible
residents.
Actions 'Treasonous'
Senior Robert Brody,
canvassing in Atherton's most
exclusive section, was told at the
first house he visited that he was a
traitor. Next door Brody was
informed that he and all the other
student workers were giving aid
and comfort to the North
Vietnamese and the Viet Cong.
At Stanford Shopping Center,
Moratorium protesters were given
courteous attention by most of
the stores' patrons, according to
freshman John Sloan.
Although replies of "Where are
your red flags?" and
"Comm un is t" occasionally
confronted those distributing
flyers, Sloan reported that most
people seemed sincerely
sympathetic.

Litterman talked to expressed

Student canvassers working
door-to-door in Menlo Park
reported favorable responses from
young adults, but indifference and

"The younger people took me
into their house, asked questions
about legislation they could

reported Felicity Barringer,
Stanford sophomore.
Adults IndiHereriit
For the most part she felt that
the older people to whom she
spoke "weren't so much hostile as
they were indifferent or felt too
uninformed to act."
Miss Barringer estimated that
about one-quarter of the people
she encountered refused to talk or
take any literature.
Students working in Sunnyvale
found the residents generally
favorable to Moratorium
canvassers. Sophomore Frank
Miller said that approximately 75
percent of the people found at
home expressed support for the
Moratorium and declared their
desire for a rapid withdrawal of
American troops from Vietnam.
Many Sunnyvale residents
indicated that they intended to
send telegrams to President N'xon
and to their congressman
expressing dissatisfaction with the
slow rate of withdrawal from
Vietnam.
Hostility M et
Canvassers in several areas,
however, encountered open
hostility.
John Coonrod, working 'n a
section of Los Altos near the
business district, declared, "It was
amazing the bad reception many
canvassers received."
He explained that many of the
Los Altos residents would not
take a stand on the war, but were
convinced that the Moratorium
was treasonous. One woman
declared, "Communists can
always come up with 'statistics' to
refute the administration."
Workers in Atherton
frequently found themselves
unable to get past the maid to
speak to the homeowner. Others
were forced to discuss the war
over intercoms with invisible
residents.
Actions 'Treasonous'
Senior Robert Brody,
canvassing in Atherton's most
exclusive section, was told at the
first house he visited that he was a
traitor. Next door Brody was
informed that he and all the other
student workers were giving aid
and comfort to the North
Vietnamese and the Viet Cong.
At Stanford Shopping Center,
Moratorium protesters were given
courteous attention by most of
the stores' patrons, according to
freshman John Sloan.
Although replies of "Where are
your red flags?" and
"Comm un is t" occasionally
confronted those distributing
flyers, Sloan reported that most
people seemed sincerely
sympathetic.
As scores of last-minute
volunteers swamped the ASSU
Moratorium headquarters, more
than 2,000 Stanford students and
faculty members fanned out over
the entire Mid peninsula area
yesterday to distribute leaflets
urging an immediate withdrawal
of American troops from
Vietnam.
In the largest outpouring of
voluntary support for organized
political activity in University
history, Moratorium coordinators
estimated that 1,300 students
were canvassing homes while 500
were leafleting shopping centers
from Hillsdale to Sunnyvale.
Approximately 100 students
boarded commuter trains during
the morning rush hour and
another 60 distributed flyers to
employees of four Industrial Park
firms as they arrived for work.
About 35 Chicano students
canvassed the Castro City area of
Mountain View, before expanding
their activities to Chicano areas of
Redwood City and San Jose.
Although good responses
outnumber the bad, the major
problem faced by the canvassers
was public indifference or
unwillingness to work actively for
the war's end, according to
Moratorium coordinator Rich
Luhring.
Apathy Large
Apathy was the main response
among commuters on the morning
trains to San Francisco. Not many
passengers would talk with the
Moratorium workers; but those
who did were generally polite and
open-minded, according to several
students who rode the trains.
Stanford students canvassing in
Los Altos and Mountain View

generally found sympathy and
apathy to be the predominant
community reactions to the
Moratorium, according to
freshman Bob Litterman.
Litterman explained that there
were a few slammed doors, but
