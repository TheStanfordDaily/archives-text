### CRAIG WILSON 
BERKELEYâ€”Pounding rain
put a damper on Moratorium
activities at Berkeley yesterday as
several thousand students from
the University of California can
vassed the city after a rally in
lower Sproul Plaza.
Driving winds and constant
rains kept large portions of the
28,000 student body indoors. A
march which had been planned to
the People's Park annex north of
the campus had to be canceled
when the field quickly became a
sea of mud.
An estimated three or four
thousand students who canvassed
the community spent much of
their time on Shattuck Avenue
talking to local merchants who
stayed open for business.
Students massed at noon on

campus to hear erstwhile UC
student body president Dan
Siegal, Fanny Hamer, organizer of
the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party, and Roger
Alvarado of Los Siete de la Raza
(Seven Mexican-Americans
accused of shooting two police).
The umbrella dotted assembly
grew to its largest proportions of
the day at the rally. Students
hung on to rails at the student
union and Eshelman Hall and sat
on roofs connecting various
buildings.
The peaceful gathering left in a
long procession for the business
district and various parts of the
community after that. Picket lines
which formed along Shattuck and
adjoining streets lasted less than
an hour as the miserable
weathered dampened the spirits of
