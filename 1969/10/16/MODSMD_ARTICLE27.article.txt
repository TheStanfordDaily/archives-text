# Palo Alto Noon March
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Like a giant phone booth
stuffing team, upwards of 5,000
anti-war demonstrators streamed
out of Palo Alto's block-square
Cogswell Plaza yesterday in a
noontime Vietnam Moratorium
march.
A "grandmothers' line"—four
gray haired ladies from the
Women's International League for
Peace and Freedom—led the
procession east down half of
University Avenue. Trapped in a
southbound traffic jam, motorists
watched with no apparent
hostility, as eight blocks of
marchers flowed by.
"We had five times more
people than we expected,"
commented Douglas Mattern,
co-chairman of the Peninsula
Moratorium Committee and
coordinator of the march. Graying
and ruddy faced, Mattern is an
electron microscopist at Fairchild
and worked for several years in
Bay Area citizens groups.
He recalled, "Four and a half
years ago, we drew 80 people
from Stanford and the
community for a Vietnam protest
march. Just after we resumed

bombing North Vietnam, an
all-time high of 1,000 turned out
to demonstrate. Today, by all
estimates, 5,000 people were
marching in spite of the rain."
Protestors moved eight and ten
abreast past shops, restaurants and
banks. Following a nine block
circular course, the crowd headed
down three side streets and
looped back to University.
Marchers cheered as the
procession's head passed its tail,
filling both sides of the four lane
avenue.
Chants of "Stop the war now!"
and "End Nixon's war!" rumbled
through the crowd for brief
intervals. Generally, protestors
moved quietly, and no trouble
occurred.
Most marchers were white
college age students, but the event
drew unusual numbers from other
groups. At least 10 percent of the
crowd appeared to be professors
or businessmen, wearing suits and
spiffy trench coats.
Although Palo Alto's schools
were formally in session, between
500 and 1000 high school and
junior high students turned out,
and held their own rally in nearby
Lytton Plaza after the march.

commented Douglas Mattern,
co-chairman of the Peninsula
Moratorium Committee and
coordinator of the march. Graying
and ruddy faced, Mattern is an
electron microscopist at Fairchild
and worked for several years in
Bay Area citizens groups.
He recalled, "Four and a half
years ago, we drew 80 people
from Stanford and the
community for a Vietnam protest
march. Just after we resumed

bombing North Vietnam, an
all-time high of 1,000 turned out
to demonstrate. Today, by all
estimates, 5,000 people were
marching in spite of the rain."
Protestors moved eight and ten
abreast past shops, restaurants and
banks. Following a nine block
circular course, the crowd headed
down three side streets and
looped back to University.
Marchers cheered as the
procession's head passed its tail,
filling both sides of the four lane
avenue.
Chants of "Stop the war now!"
and "End Nixon's war!" rumbled
through the crowd for brief
intervals. Generally, protestors
moved quietly, and no trouble
occurred.
Most marchers were white
college age students, but the event
drew unusual numbers from other
groups. At least 10 percent of the
crowd appeared to be professors
or businessmen, wearing suits and
spiffy trench coats.
Although Palo Alto's schools
were formally in session, between
500 and 1000 high school and
junior high students turned out,
and held their own rally in nearby
Lytton Plaza after the march.

Like a giant phone booth
stuffing team, upwards of 5,000
anti-war demonstrators streamed
out of Palo Alto's block-square
Cogswell Plaza yesterday in a
noontime Vietnam Moratorium
march.
A "grandmothers' line"—four
gray haired ladies from the
Women's International League for
Peace and Freedom—led the
procession east down half of
University Avenue. Trapped in a
southbound traffic jam, motorists
watched with no apparent
hostility, as eight blocks of
marchers flowed by.
"We had five times more
people than we expected,"
commented Douglas Mattern,
co-chairman of the Peninsula
Moratorium Committee and
coordinator of the march. Graying
and ruddy faced, Mattern is an
