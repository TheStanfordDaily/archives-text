# For What Itâ€™s Worth
## Flock Unfolds In First Release 
### COREY GOODMAN 
"Two months ago I was telling
the gentlemen of the British press
that The Flock was the best band
I'd heard in America. After
tonight's show of force, I am very
happy to repeat that personal
evaluation."
Johr Mayall said this about
The Flock after hearing them on
July 9th, i969, and I can
remember myself getting just as
excited when I saw them make

their debut performance on April
30th, 1965, in Chicago.
For their first two years they
became popular in Chicago by
making the circuit of dance halls
and clubs. They didn't play any of
their own songs, but they did the
best versions around of songs
from other groups.
Then The Flock changed. With
their individual potentials and
musical backgrounds, they wanted
to start playing their own music
and stop playing the "Top 40"
stuff they had been doing for
their high school audiences. Their
first attempts at their own music
were poor, as they became too
loud with long drawn out guitar
solos and screaching sax solos. As

they lost their pack-in crowds,
they went into temporary
isolation.
The Flock re-emerged with
new music, which is, in Mayall's
words, "a subtle fusion of sounds
drawn from the bedrock of blues,
jazz, gospel, rock, country and
many other sources." Classical
could also be added to that list.
Their album, The Flock, is a
good recording of how they are
playing today.
The album begins with
"Introduction," an avante-garde
violin concerto in which
Goodman plays pure classical
music backed by subtle
jazz-oriented guitars and rhythmic
changes. It is the perfect

introduction, telling those that
listen that this is where our minds
are, with the classical and jazz
influences, and now we'll show
you where our music is. And
suddenly, with "Clown," the hard
rock backgrounds of the group
break through with an almost
Chicago blues thing, blaring horns
and driving rhythms, only to flow
into a classical-jazz violin solo
before blending back into the
pure rock beginnings of the song.
Keep up with the Violin
"Clown" is a good example of
how the whole band is able to
keep up with Goodman's violin, us
they are able to support him using
dynamic changes: quick but
smooth instrumental breaks and
rhythm changes. The second song,
"I Am The Tall Tree," shows
where The Flock's vocals are at.
Fred Glickstein, with his mellow
voice, has taken over the vocals
joined by the rest of the group.
And then there is "Tired of
Waiting," an old Kinks song which
has come through every phase of
The Flock. They once played it
Kinks style, but their album
includes their new style of the
song. "Tired of Waiting" is their
gospel, and every instrument gets
its chance to preach.
Those four songs make up the
first side, and the second side

features "Store-Bought-Store
Thought" and"Truth" for 15
minutes. In "Truth," Goodman's
violin starts emitting wild, erotic
sounds, and he takes his classical
thoughts through wah-wah pedals
and blues progressions.
The Flock are bound to be in
San Francisco this year, but in the
meantime, their album is good
listening. They are not, as Mayall
says, the best band to come out in
America, but they are probably
one of the better new bands
around.
