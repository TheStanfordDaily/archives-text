# 'Four Faces of Blacknessâ€™
## BSU Opens Show 
### 
"The Four Faces of
Blackness," a multi-media
exploration of God, orgasm,
loneliness, and death, will be
presented by the Fourth Stream
Expression in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium at Stanford this
weekend.
An original creation by
Stanford student writers,
photographers, musicians,
dancers, and technicians, the
70-minute program will be given
five times: at 7:30 and 10 p.m.
Friday, at 7:30 and 10 p.m.
Saturday, and at 7:30 p.m.
Sunday. All proceeds from the
Sunday performance will go to
the East Palo Alto Day School,
directed by Gertrude Wilkes, to
buy books for pre-school children.

Described as a celebration of
the black arts, the independent
production is supported by the
Black Student Union and made
possible with financial assistance
from the President's Office. It
involves both black and white
performers.
Color slides, sound tracks,
dancing, strobe lights, and the
music of Smoke, a professional
jazz quintet, provide visual,
mental, physical, and musical
stimuli to participants.
Grant, one of the
show's writers, says the show grew
out of the artistic interests of
several diverse student groups last
year. Others involved in the
production include Ira Kahn and
Rick Butler, photography; John
Stolurow, lights; Gary Griffieth
(cq), Ann Worthington, and
Richard Brown, choreography;
Antoinette Culpepper, art; Owen
Daniels, sound; and the jazz group
Smoke.
Tickets are available through
the Black Student Union,
Tresidder Memorial Union, or at
the door. Prices are $2 for the
public, $1 for students.
