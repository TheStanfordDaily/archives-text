## Oct. 15: Liberals' Last Stand? 
### MARK WE IN BERGER 
Yesterday was the liberals' day. Nothing happened.
The nation was not torn asunder, no cities were burned, no angry
blacks rampaged, no massive acts of civil disobedience halted
"business as usual."
In every aspect, the October 15 Vietnam Moratorium violated no
regulation governing the use of this country's democratic tools; they
did nothing that isn't permitted each and every day. The speeches,
rallies, marches, and door-to-door salesmanship that formed the
nucleus of the Moratorium protest hardly constitute "making policy
in the streets," as this country's political leader described the
activities.
Moratorium participants did the liberal's thing: they exercised their
rights. And they did it in unprecedented numbers, across the United
States. Under the mystical formula that makes up American
democracy, our government is supposed to listen. It is supposed to
listen to the 8000 voices that cheered Linus Pauling. Carlton Goodlet,
Don Edwards, and Pete McCloskey. It is supposed to listen to the
Eugene McCarthys, the Benjamin Spocks, the William Fulbrights, and
the Alan Cranstons who spoke to thousands throughout the nation.
But the government isn't listening. Everybody's talking a,t it; it
won't hear a word they're saying. It told us so, even before the protest
day began.
For the 8000 citizens who gathered on campus last night, the spirit
which burned in the early part of 1968 was rekindled. Despite the

harsh reality of angry faces encountered in doorways during the
morning and afternoon, the spirit of community against that Asian
war flowed through last night's audience.
Those 8000 persons—hearing the self-satisfying words of Goodlett
and Pauling and McCloskey—expect to be heard. They expect it
because the American system is set up to deal with such grievances.
But the government isn't listening.
The Vietnam Moratorium is simply another expression of an
amorphous force known in the mass media as the New Politics. New
Politics means peace before war, full stomachs before full armament,
and open rather than secret government. That force of creative energy
was stifled in 1968. The same force, which is behind the Moratorium,
will certainly be shifted again. It seems rather unlikely that the energy
of the New Politics will allow itself to be stifled indefinitely.
The activities of October 15 were not attempts at subversion or
destruction. They were an attempt to redirect the course of this
country's energies through the use of persuasion and rational
dialogue —the keys to the liberal's tool box.
The time is rapidly running out when those liberal tools will
suffice, particularly if those with political power refuse to move out
of their positions of isolation and estrangment. As American political
leaders retreat further and further into their conference rooms and
strategy sessions, it is inevitable that the youth of this country will
"make policy in the streets."

because the American system is set up to deal with such grievances.
But the government isn't listening.
The Vietnam Moratorium is simply another expression of an
amorphous force known in the mass media as the New Politics. New
Politics means peace before war, full stomachs before full armament,
and open rather than secret government. That force of creative energy
was stifled in 1968. The same force, which is behind the Moratorium,
will certainly be shifted again. It seems rather unlikely that the energy
of the New Politics will allow itself to be stifled indefinitely.
The activities of October 15 were not attempts at subversion or
destruction. They were an attempt to redirect the course of this
country's energies through the use of persuasion and rational
dialogue —the keys to the liberal's tool box.
The time is rapidly running out when those liberal tools will
suffice, particularly if those with political power refuse to move out
of their positions of isolation and estrangment. As American political
leaders retreat further and further into their conference rooms and
strategy sessions, it is inevitable that the youth of this country will
"make policy in the streets."
Yesterday was the liberals' day. Nothing happened.
The nation was not torn asunder, no cities were burned, no angry
blacks rampaged, no massive acts of civil disobedience halted
"business as usual."
In every aspect, the October 15 Vietnam Moratorium violated no
regulation governing the use of this country's democratic tools; they
did nothing that isn't permitted each and every day. The speeches,
rallies, marches, and door-to-door salesmanship that formed the
nucleus of the Moratorium protest hardly constitute "making policy
in the streets," as this country's political leader described the
activities.
Moratorium participants did the liberal's thing: they exercised their
rights. And they did it in unprecedented numbers, across the United
States. Under the mystical formula that makes up American
democracy, our government is supposed to listen. It is supposed to
listen to the 8000 voices that cheered Linus Pauling. Carlton Goodlet,
Don Edwards, and Pete McCloskey. It is supposed to listen to the
Eugene McCarthys, the Benjamin Spocks, the William Fulbrights, and
the Alan Cranstons who spoke to thousands throughout the nation.
But the government isn't listening. Everybody's talking a,t it; it
won't hear a word they're saying. It told us so, even before the protest
day began.
For the 8000 citizens who gathered on campus last night, the spirit
which burned in the early part of 1968 was rekindled. Despite the

harsh reality of angry faces encountered in doorways during the
morning and afternoon, the spirit of community against that Asian
war flowed through last night's audience.
Those 8000 persons—hearing the self-satisfying words of Goodlett
and Pauling and McCloskey—expect to be heard. They expect it
because the American system is set up to deal with such grievances.
