# Thumbing Down The Road
## Palm Drive Is Not Hitcher's Paradise 
### BILL BANKS 
Masterful creators of political,
metaphysical and academic
mosaics have twirled and tangled
words artfully and with varying
surges of emotion for over two
weeks now in the grim official
medium of type. Theories of truth
and scandalous disruptions of
right by wrong come and go

utterly, joyously and trembling
quietly with inner doubt. But like
a good politician who can narrow
the issue to the local problem, I
want to speak briefly of a "little
thing" which neither astounds nor
infuriates. It is simply interesting
and perhaps, considering the
number of students who speak of
it, worthy of some thought.

Now everyone (even a Stanford
student) who has been on the
road hitch-hiking more than once
acquires a sense or system for
sizing up potential rides as he
watches cars approach. It doesn't
take a great deal of intelligence to
realize that middle-aged
housewives, employed in the
transport division of the local
ice-cream eating cub scout
battalion and old women with
little American flags on every
window of a new buick aren't
going to stop for a hitch-hiker
very often. Granted, there are
exceptions, but for the most part
a stranded hitch-hiker doesn't get
too excited when this variety of
driver approaches.
On the other hand there are
the drivers with high potential
such as men alone in big cars or,
best of all, students. Students, the
hitch-hiker reasons, are probably
the most likely to be free of the
horror stories about hitch-hikers
that flare up in front of the
average driver when he sees the
old thumb and grin on the side of
the road in front of him.
Students are probably less
likely to be in a rush to close a
crisis business deal, be worried
about sexual impotence or fail to
recognize the beggar as a peer.
Surely it's fair to assume that
few people have the ability to
really lurk around Palm Drive on a
brilliant Palo Alto day and the
chances of psychotic killers
commuting to Stanford are
reasonably remote. Well, there's
little point in drawing this out
further except to say that of
course it isn't at all easy to get a
ride on Palm Drive and this is
really very curious.
Even given the high potential
student driver, one would expect
some break-up categorically by

student stereotype. That is to say
that long haired kids in beat up
old Volkswagens would seem to
be the most likely to stop if only
because of the self-righteousness
that is constantly attributed to
that stereotype. On the other
hand it would perhaps be
reasonable to expect some prim
and trim young lady in her
Daddy's new car to be excused.
Strange Case of Palm Drive
None of these generalizations,
according to over a score of
people I have spoken with, seems
to hold true in the strange case of
Palm Drive. Perhaps it is a credit
to the "liberal" side of this liberal
institution that drivers, regardless
of their race, color, religious
beliefs or style of life, will pass
you by.
I suppose there's little point in
drawing this particular harangue
out with descriptions of the
various guilt reactions that come
over the drivers on Palm Drive
(like staring fixedly ahead or
remembering something vital that
demands immediate attention in
the glove compartment) but
surely it is a curious thing to see
the same students who break their
backs (and those of others) in
order to bring some semblance of
humanity to society in the same
light as the typical member of the
business, discount wo»\d.
Unique Honesty
This may seem an overly
generalized accusation, but in a
sense the hitch-hiker is uniquely
honest in his blindness to the

appearance of the driver who
stops and offers a ride and a
friendly smile. When you're on
the road and tired, a driver either
stops or he doesn't and for once
there really is no middle ground.
This blindness, by the way, can be
very useful to those students who
are too involved with the
machinations of their own little
plots for life-time success or their
plans for the depravity of society.
The Flakey Foonts of the
student generation await your call
by the roadside and can be
exploited with a minimum of
rationalization.

about sexual impotence or fail to
recognize the beggar as a peer.
Surely it's fair to assume that
few people have the ability to
really lurk around Palm Drive on a
brilliant Palo Alto day and the
chances of psychotic killers
commuting to Stanford are
reasonably remote. Well, there's
little point in drawing this out
further except to say that of
course it isn't at all easy to get a
ride on Palm Drive and this is
really very curious.
Even given the high potential
student driver, one would expect
some break-up categorically by

student stereotype. That is to say
that long haired kids in beat up
old Volkswagens would seem to
be the most likely to stop if only
because of the self-righteousness
that is constantly attributed to
that stereotype. On the other
hand it would perhaps be
reasonable to expect some prim
and trim young lady in her
Daddy's new car to be excused.
Strange Case of Palm Drive
None of these generalizations,
according to over a score of
people I have spoken with, seems
to hold true in the strange case of
Palm Drive. Perhaps it is a credit
to the "liberal" side of this liberal
institution that drivers, regardless
of their race, color, religious
beliefs or style of life, will pass
you by.
I suppose there's little point in
drawing this particular harangue
out with descriptions of the
various guilt reactions that come
over the drivers on Palm Drive
(like staring fixedly ahead or
remembering something vital that
demands immediate attention in
the glove compartment) but
surely it is a curious thing to see
the same students who break their
backs (and those of others) in
order to bring some semblance of
humanity to society in the same
light as the typical member of the
business, discount wo»\d.
Unique Honesty
This may seem an overly
generalized accusation, but in a
sense the hitch-hiker is uniquely
honest in his blindness to the

appearance of the driver who
stops and offers a ride and a
friendly smile. When you're on
the road and tired, a driver either
stops or he doesn't and for once
there really is no middle ground.
This blindness, by the way, can be
very useful to those students who
are too involved with the
machinations of their own little
plots for life-time success or their
plans for the depravity of society.
The Flakey Foonts of the
student generation await your call
by the roadside and can be
exploited with a minimum of
rationalization.


THE REV. A. CECIL WILLIAMS
Masterful creators of political,
metaphysical and academic
mosaics have twirled and tangled
words artfully and with varying
surges of emotion for over two
weeks now in the grim official
medium of type. Theories of truth
and scandalous disruptions of
right by wrong come and go

utterly, joyously and trembling
quietly with inner doubt. But like
a good politician who can narrow
the issue to the local problem, I
want to speak briefly of a "little
thing" which neither astounds nor
infuriates. It is simply interesting
and perhaps, considering the
number of students who speak of
it, worthy of some thought.

Now everyone (even a Stanford
student) who has been on the
road hitch-hiking more than once
acquires a sense or system for
sizing up potential rides as he
watches cars approach. It doesn't
take a great deal of intelligence to
realize that middle-aged
housewives, employed in the
transport division of the local
ice-cream eating cub scout
battalion and old women with
little American flags on every
window of a new buick aren't
going to stop for a hitch-hiker
very often. Granted, there are
exceptions, but for the most part
a stranded hitch-hiker doesn't get
too excited when this variety of
driver approaches.
On the other hand there are
the drivers with high potential
such as men alone in big cars or,
best of all, students. Students, the
hitch-hiker reasons, are probably
the most likely to be free of the
horror stories about hitch-hikers
that flare up in front of the
average driver when he sees the
old thumb and grin on the side of
the road in front of him.
Students are probably less
likely to be in a rush to close a
crisis business deal, be worried
about sexual impotence or fail to
recognize the beggar as a peer.
Surely it's fair to assume that
few people have the ability to
really lurk around Palm Drive on a

sense the hitch-hiker is uniquely
honest in his blindness to the

appearance of the driver who
stops and offers a ride and a
friendly smile. When you're on
the road and tired, a driver either
stops or he doesn't and for once
there really is no middle ground.
This blindness, by the way, can be
very useful to those students who
are too involved with the
machinations of their own little
plots for life-time success or their
plans for the depravity of society.
The Flakey Foonts of the
student generation await your call
by the roadside and can be
exploited with a minimum of
rationalization.
