(i)
When this morning window
Reveals silhouettes of fresh
desolation,
I wonder why we sing reason
When harvest is hate and
rubble,
Wonder how we shall sing
Where all is rust and decay.
But the birds still shall sing
the sun still shall rise
Though ruins assail the silent
sky.
(ii)
On this broken floor
littered with memories of in
vasion,
I remember bones in the tall
grass
and distant mother
who thinks her son is still a
soldier. . .
'The ram's mother has no
child. "
On my mat, this night,
boyhood faces flood my eyes
with silent tears -
NTCHU
EKULO
IRUS
and
GOMA . . . faces eyes
shall not see again.
On my back,
listening in the silent night,
stretching my ears across the
seven seas. . .
But rats' feet on the
ceiling
Are all ears can bear.

( Hi)
Tomorrow morning,
when early birds shall rouse
the sleeping ruins,
and the town slowly
unveils her ravished face,
The steps of once-exiled feet
Shall wake again the streets of
Owerri
Owerri,
where the sun's rays
piercing the tall grass
decorate with rainbow dew
the brave remains of a mother's
sweat:
bones and rags
bones and rags
