# Candles Light D.C. March
## 
### FD KOHN 
America's bitter division over
the Vietnam war crystallized
yesterday as hundreds of
thousands of people rallied,
debated, marched and prayed in
observance of Vietnam
Moratorium Day. The Moratorium
marked the biggest protest yet
against the government's policies
on the war.
The windup for the day took
place at an early evening rally at
the Washington Monument. It
included a speech by Mrs. Coretta
King, wife of the late Dr. Martin
Luther King, and a silent
candle-light march to the White
House. 35,000 people participated
in the march.
More than half a million
anti-war protesters wore black
armbands and peace buttons as

they denounced the war as
immoral and futile in every state
in the nation. Church bells tolled
throughout the day in New York
City where 20,000 gathered in
Bryant Park for a rally last night.
Philadelphia, Minneapolis,
Boston, Chicago and New
Brunswick, N.J. also reported
rallies with attendance of at least
10,000 persons.
No major incidents were
reported. Moratorium organizer
Sam Brown emphasized the
peaceful nature of the
demonstration, saying, it "gives
hope to the people that they can
work for change within the
democratic system . . . without
violence."
College and university
campuses were the center or the
starting point for most of the
Moratorium Day activities. Most
institutions reported high rates of
absences in the wake of the
protest.
In Churches, Streets
Around the nation, the
movement reached into the
churches and spread into the
streets. Elmer Lee Abeles, Jr. was
the first name read off at a
memorial service held at Trininty
Church at the head of Wall Street
in New York, where the names of
all war casualties were read before
assembled lawyers and financeers.
Business As Usual
In Washington, where four
young black protestors and a
blonde girl were arrested in front
of the White House, President
Nixon conducted a "business as
usual" day. Nixon spent his time
working on economic problems
and Latin American matters, and
took no pi.blic notice of the
demonstrations.
Spokesmen for the White
House insisted that the protests
had no effect on Nixon's plans for
the day. The President, it seemed
evident, had decided in advance to
sit the day out without doing
anything that could be interpreted
as Mori tori um-oriented.
Extra guards were on duty at
the White House, but, except for
the five arrests, there were no
incidents.
Congress, too, experienced a
normal working day. The House
of Representatives, which was
forced to adjourn Tuesday night
after little more than three hours
of Vietnam debate when a
quorum could not be maintained,
conducted a routine session.

In Boston, where a rally
attracted 15,000 for a march to
the Boston Common, a 70-foot
banner reading "Peace" was
stretched across one street. At
Harvard, Economist John K.
Galbraith told a rally of 1,000
that he thought ending the war
now would bring the U.S. military
establishment under control.
Also speaking in Boston was
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who
told the World Affairs Council
that he felt the United States
should announce "an irrevocable
decision" to withdraw ground
combat troops from Vietnam
within one year and all other
forces by the end of 1972.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy spoke
to 10,000 persons at Rutgers
University, New Brunswick, N.J.,
and later at the Bryant Park rally
in New York.
He declared that although
President Nixon might hold a
military withdrawal from Vietnam
to be an American military
disaster, history "would call it a
sign of great statesmanship."
Day of Observance
In New York City, Mayor John
V. Lindsay, who proclaimed the
day a day of observance and had
City Hall draped in black and
purple mourning, told a crowd of
1,000, "Anyone who says this
demonstration is unpatriotic does
not know the history of his own
nation. This form of dissent is the
highest form of patriotism."
15,000 persons attended a rally
at the city's John F. Kennedy
Plaza. The Philadelphia Evening
Bulletin said an estimated 50,000
persons in the Philadelphia area
observed the Moratorium.
Small Town Crowds
Also notable was the size of
crowds in relatively small
localities. In White Plains, N.Y., a
Westchester County suburb of
New York City, 5,000 persons
picketed draft board offices.
About 3,000 persons, arms linked
and 30 abreast, marched through
downtown Albuquerque, N.M.
In Burlington, Vt., about 4,000
persons gathered at the State
University in what observers
called one of the lurgest political
demonstrates jn state history.
Campus Protests
Campus demonstrations took a
variety of forms. Students at
Louisiana State University in
classes that did not meet and the
reduced attendance of classes that
did meet with the total
enrollment.
There was no immediate way
to estimate the impact on smaller
courses and those taught on the
graduate level, as most courses
surveyed were large undergraduate
classes.
In a News Service survey of 73
professors, 40 stated classes would
meet, while the remainder was
divided evenly between those who
rescheduled and those who
cancelled classes. A survey of 60
professors conducted by the Palo
Alto Times showed that
three-fifths would hold classes,
and one-fifth cancel classes
without immediate rescheduling.
Also, of the classes that were
held, especially in the humanities
and sciences, many were devoted
to either material that was not an
"integral" part of the course or
discussions on the war. Some
professors felt obligated to give
students a choice about
attendance, and indicated that
they would be available for
discussions or conferences,
although regular tinctures would
not be held.

Church at the head of Wall Street
in New York, where the names of
all war casualties were read before
assembled lawyers and financeers.
Business As Usual
In Washington, where four
young black protestors and a
blonde girl were arrested in front
of the White House, President
Nixon conducted a "business as
usual" day. Nixon spent his time
working on economic problems
and Latin American matters, and
took no pi.blic notice of the
demonstrations.
Spokesmen for the White
House insisted that the protests
had no effect on Nixon's plans for
the day. The President, it seemed
evident, had decided in advance to
sit the day out without doing
anything that could be interpreted
as Mori tori um-oriented.
Extra guards were on duty at
the White House, but, except for
the five arrests, there were no
incidents.
Congress, too, experienced a
normal working day. The House
of Representatives, which was
forced to adjourn Tuesday night
after little more than three hours
of Vietnam debate when a
quorum could not be maintained,
conducted a routine session.

In Boston, where a rally
attracted 15,000 for a march to
the Boston Common, a 70-foot
banner reading "Peace" was
stretched across one street. At
Harvard, Economist John K.
Galbraith told a rally of 1,000
that he thought ending the war
now would bring the U.S. military
establishment under control.
Also speaking in Boston was
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who
told the World Affairs Council
that he felt the United States
should announce "an irrevocable
decision" to withdraw ground
combat troops from Vietnam
within one year and all other
forces by the end of 1972.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy spoke
to 10,000 persons at Rutgers
University, New Brunswick, N.J.,
and later at the Bryant Park rally
in New York.
He declared that although
President Nixon might hold a
military withdrawal from Vietnam
to be an American military
disaster, history "would call it a
sign of great statesmanship."
Day of Observance
In New York City, Mayor John
V. Lindsay, who proclaimed the
day a day of observance and had
City Hall draped in black and
purple mourning, told a crowd of
1,000, "Anyone who says this
demonstration is unpatriotic does
not know the history of his own
nation. This form of dissent is the
highest form of patriotism."
15,000 persons attended a rally
at the city's John F. Kennedy
Plaza. The Philadelphia Evening
Bulletin said an estimated 50,000
persons in the Philadelphia area
observed the Moratorium.
Small Town Crowds
Also notable was the size of
crowds in relatively small
localities. In White Plains, N.Y., a
Westchester County suburb of
New York City, 5,000 persons
picketed draft board offices.
About 3,000 persons, arms linked
and 30 abreast, marched through
downtown Albuquerque, N.M.
In Burlington, Vt., about 4,000
persons gathered at the State
University in what observers
called one of the lurgest political
demonstrates jn state history.
Campus Protests
Campus demonstrations took a
variety of forms. Students at
Louisiana State University in
classes that did not meet and the
reduced attendance of classes that
did meet with the total
enrollment.
There was no immediate way
to estimate the impact on smaller
courses and those taught on the
graduate level, as most courses
surveyed were large undergraduate
classes.
In a News Service survey of 73
professors, 40 stated classes would
meet, while the remainder was
divided evenly between those who
rescheduled and those who
cancelled classes. A survey of 60
professors conducted by the Palo
Alto Times showed that
three-fifths would hold classes,
and one-fifth cancel classes
without immediate rescheduling.
Also, of the classes that were
held, especially in the humanities
and sciences, many were devoted
to either material that was not an
"integral" part of the course or
discussions on the war. Some
professors felt obligated to give
students a choice about
attendance, and indicated that
they would be available for
discussions or conferences,
although regular tinctures would
not be held.
America's bitter division over
the Vietnam war crystallized
yesterday as hundreds of
thousands of people rallied,
debated, marched and prayed in
observance of Vietnam
Moratorium Day. The Moratorium
marked the biggest protest yet
against the government's policies
on the war.
The windup for the day took
place at an early evening rally at
the Washington Monument. It
included a speech by Mrs. Coretta
King, wife of the late Dr. Martin
Luther King, and a silent
candle-light march to the White
House. 35,000 people participated
in the march.
More than half a million
anti-war protesters wore black
armbands and peace buttons as

they denounced the war as
immoral and futile in every state
in the nation. Church bells tolled
throughout the day in New York
City where 20,000 gathered in
Bryant Park for a rally last night.
Philadelphia, Minneapolis,
Boston, Chicago and New
Brunswick, N.J. also reported
rallies with attendance of at least
10,000 persons.
No major incidents were
reported. Moratorium organizer
Sam Brown emphasized the
peaceful nature of the
demonstration, saying, it "gives
hope to the people that they can
work for change within the
democratic system . . . without
violence."
College and university
campuses were the center or the
starting point for most of the
Moratorium Day activities. Most
institutions reported high rates of
absences in the wake of the
protest.
In Churches, Streets
Around the nation, the
movement reached into the
churches and spread into the
streets. Elmer Lee Abeles, Jr. was
the first name read off at a
memorial service held at Trininty

in New York, where the names of
all war casualties were read before

forces by the end of 1972.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy spoke
to 10,000 persons at Rutgers
University, New Brunswick, N.J.,
and later at the Bryant Park rally
in New York.
He declared that although
President Nixon might hold a
military withdrawal from Vietnam
to be an American military
disaster, history "would call it a
sign of great statesmanship."
Day of Observance
In New York City, Mayor John
V. Lindsay, who proclaimed the
day a day of observance and had
City Hall draped in black and
purple mourning, told a crowd of
1,000, "Anyone who says this
demonstration is unpatriotic does
not know the history of his own
nation. This form of dissent is the
highest form of patriotism."
15,000 persons attended a rally
at the city's John F. Kennedy
Plaza. The Philadelphia Evening
Bulletin said an estimated 50,000
persons in the Philadelphia area
observed the Moratorium.
Small Town Crowds
Also notable was the size of
crowds in relatively small
localities. In White Plains, N.Y., a
Westchester County suburb of
New York City, 5,000 persons
picketed draft board offices.
About 3,000 persons, arms linked
and 30 abreast, marched through
downtown Albuquerque, N.M.
In Burlington, Vt., about 4,000
persons gathered at the State
University in what observers
called one of the lurgest political
demonstrates jn state history.
Campus Protests
Campus demonstrations took a
variety of forms. Students at
Louisiana State University in
classes that did not meet and the
reduced attendance of classes that
did meet with the total
enrollment.
There was no immediate way
to estimate the impact on smaller
courses and those taught on the
graduate level, as most courses
surveyed were large undergraduate
classes.
In a News Service survey of 73
professors, 40 stated classes would
meet, while the remainder was
divided evenly between those who
rescheduled and those who
cancelled classes. A survey of 60
professors conducted by the Palo
Alto Times showed that
three-fifths would hold classes,
and one-fifth cancel classes
without immediate rescheduling.
Also, of the classes that were
held, especially in the humanities
and sciences, many were devoted
to either material that was not an
"integral" part of the course or
discussions on the war. Some
professors felt obligated to give
students a choice about
attendance, and indicated that
they would be available for
discussions or conferences,
although regular tinctures would
not be held.
America's bitter division over
the Vietnam war crystallized
yesterday as hundreds of
thousands of people rallied,
debated, marched and prayed in
observance of Vietnam
Moratorium Day. The Moratorium
marked the biggest protest yet
against the government's policies
on the war.
The windup for the day took
place at an early evening rally at
the Washington Monument. It
included a speech by Mrs. Coretta
King, wife of the late Dr. Martin
Luther King, and a silent
candle-light march to the White
House. 35,000 people participated
in the march.
More than half a million
anti-war protesters wore black
armbands and peace buttons as

they denounced the war as
immoral and futile in every state
in the nation. Church bells tolled
throughout the day in New York
City where 20,000 gathered in
Bryant Park for a rally last night.
Philadelphia, Minneapolis,
Boston, Chicago and New
Brunswick, N.J. also reported
rallies with attendance of at least
10,000 persons.
No major incidents were
reported. Moratorium organizer
Sam Brown emphasized the
peaceful nature of the
demonstration, saying, it "gives
hope to the people that they can
work for change within the
democratic system . . . without
violence."
College and university
campuses were the center or the
starting point for most of the
Moratorium Day activities. Most
institutions reported high rates of
absences in the wake of the
protest.
In Churches, Streets
Around the nation, the
movement reached into the
churches and spread into the
streets. Elmer Lee Abeles, Jr. was
the first name read off at a
memorial service held at Trininty
Church at the head of Wall Street
in New York, where the names of
all war casualties were read before
assembled lawyers and financeers.
Business As Usual
In Washington, where four
young black protestors and a
blonde girl were arrested in front
of the White House, President
Nixon conducted a "business as
usual" day. Nixon spent his time
working on economic problems
and Latin American matters, and
took no pi.blic notice of the
demonstrations.
Spokesmen for the White
House insisted that the protests
had no effect on Nixon's plans for
the day. The President, it seemed
evident, had decided in advance to
sit the day out without doing
anything that could be interpreted
as Mori tori um-oriented.
Extra guards were on duty at
the White House, but, except for
the five arrests, there were no
incidents.
Congress, too, experienced a
normal working day. The House
of Representatives, which was
forced to adjourn Tuesday night
after little more than three hours
of Vietnam debate when a
quorum could not be maintained,
conducted a routine session.

In Boston, where a rally
attracted 15,000 for a march to
the Boston Common, a 70-foot
banner reading "Peace" was
stretched across one street. At
Harvard, Economist John K.
Galbraith told a rally of 1,000
that he thought ending the war
now would bring the U.S. military
establishment under control.
Also speaking in Boston was
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who
told the World Affairs Council
that he felt the United States
should announce "an irrevocable
decision" to withdraw ground
combat troops from Vietnam
within one year and all other
forces by the end of 1972.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy spoke
to 10,000 persons at Rutgers
University, New Brunswick, N.J.,
