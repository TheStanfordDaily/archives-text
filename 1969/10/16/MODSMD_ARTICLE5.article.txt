# Crowds In Mem Aud, Church Hear Day's Effect Debated
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL TOM GIVEN 
Eight thousand Peninsula
residents overflowing last night
from Memorial Auditorium and
Memorial Church heard speakers
agree the Moratorium was a
"beautiful thing" but disagree on
what it meant.
Congressman Don Edwards
(D-San Jose) caught the mood of
his diverse audience in denouncing
the "illegal and immoral war in
Vietnam and the mounting
stockpile of unsolved domestic
problems and unfulfilled
promises."
He criticized Victimization of
the war as a "slogan being used to
conceal our staying in, not to
facilitate our getting out."
But the retiring congressman
received his greatest applause in
response to statements on
domestic policy. "We have a

deeply troubled domestic society.
Some o.f the energy generated by
the Moratorium must lead the
fight against racism in our
country.
"We, the whites; run the
country, and it is up to white
American to accept the
challengeâ€”to face this difficult
problem with imagination and
dedication, wisdom and courage.
And, yes, with love. This is
something we are learning from
the young," he said.
Anti-Clim ax
Edwards also called for the end
of the draft, and for international
agreements for the control of
nuclear weapons.
Nevertheless, what began as the
climax of this Moratorium day
became an anticlimax when
Congressman Pete McCloskey
(R-llth district) and black editor
and publisher Carleton Good lot

disagreed on the future course of
the Moratorium.
McCloskey predicted that
students could change national
policy in the next 60 days. "If
there is quiet debate, then this
country will react as it always has
to respectable protest and it will
move through the Congress to
rescind the Tonkin Gulf
Resolution," he said to loud
applause.
Suggesting that the protest
movement "has now come of
age," the Congressman cautioned
against violence. "We can no
longer burn draft cards, burn flags
in violation of the law," he said.
"Now we have the responsibility
to turn to logic and reason and
persuasion in the art of
advocacy."
Goodlet, the radical journalist
who walked last year's picket lines
at San Francisco State, disagreed.
"The tragedy is," he said, "that
we live in a nation where
non-violent petition does not lead
to action."
"Nixon addresses himself to
power and power alone. As long
as we speak and as long as we
petition, he will not act."
Goodlet then turned his
attention to what he termed the
"bleak future of America's
wretched of the earth." He said
that block Americans had "met
every challenge and paid every
price."
But he added that in an
America blighted by militarism,
racism, and poverty, "If blacks
must fight and die in freedom's
cause, let us die at home."
The other main speaker at the
rally was Nobel Laureate Linus
Pauling who received a standing
ovation at the beginning and end
of his speech
He said the Moratorium was
opposed by "the small group of
rich and powerful people who are
using their power to keep the war
going.
"And the war will continue,
he said, "unless we, the people of
the United States, say NO, STOP
THE WAR!, over and over again."
