# Rough Draft
## ROTC at Stanford 
### Mark Edwards 
Recently the Office of Special
Services has received a number of
questions about ROTC. Some
cadets are unsure of the extent of
their commitments and
obligations to their service. Some
want to know if they are in the
reserves or not. Others have been
confused about disenrollment and
discharge. This column is directed
to some of these questions.
As a rule of thumb, if you are
receiving money from ROTC you
are in the reserves. You are an
enlisted man assigned to Stanford
ROTC. This applies to all cadets
receiving financial assistance or
subsistance pay from ROTC.
If you are an ROTC cadet and
in the reserves, you are probably
obligated to six years duty. Army
non-scholarship cadets contract
for two years active duty, Navy
contract cadets for three, and all
scholarship, Navy Regular,
Marine, and Air Force category II
and 111 cadets for four. Air Force
I-P and I-N cadets (pilots and
navigators) are signed up for five
years of active duty upon receipt
of their aeronautical rating.
Whatever remains of your six-year
obligation after you've served
your active duty is spent in the
active and standby reserves.
Getting Out
Once in the reserves, getting
out can be difficult. You must
remember that you are both an
ROTC cadet and an enlisted man
in the reserves. You remain in the
enlisted reserves until you receive
your commission as an officer.
Disenrollment from ROTC is not
the same thing as discharge from
the reserves. You can be
disenrolled without being
discharged; some students have
found themselves in just that
situation. You need both
disenrollment and discharge
before you're back dealing with
your draft board.
Some reasons for
disenrollment, such as medical
disqualification, carry an almost
automatic discharge from the

reserves. Other reasons, such as
willful failure to complete
requirements or refusal to accept
a commission, can lead to
involuntary active duty in your
enlisted grade. Scholarship and
Air Force cadets can be ordered
to as much as four years
involuntary active duty, and other
cadets for up to two years
involuntary active duty.
Navy cadets can be both
disenrolled and discharged at their
own request with the detachment
commander's approval up to their
last two years of ROTC
instruction (or until they have
registered in the second year of a
two year program.) Enlisted
cadets in the other services and
Navy cadets in their last two years
must find some other grounds
such as hardship or inaptitude.
Such a request must be
investigated by some neutral
military board or individual, and
final decision is made at a level
higher than the local ROTC
detachment. The detachment
commander is required to
recommend either disenrollment
with discharge or disenrollment
and involuntary order to active
duty. Both recommendations have
been made in the past. In some
cases, such disenrollment has led
to discharge; in others, to
involuntary active duty.
F'iling a CO
All three services recognize
conscientious objection as a
reason for disenrollment and
discharge. To qualify for a CO
discharge you must meet the
criteria established by DOD
directive 1300.6 for conscientious
objectors. This involves filling out
a number of forms and seeing a
military chaplain, psychiatrist,
and legal officer. If you fail to
quality as a conscientious objector
in the opinjon of your service,
you are very likely to be
disenrolled from ROTC and
ordered involuntarily to active
duty as an enlisted man. This is a
simple procedure of changing
your inactive reserve status to

active reserve status. Your draft
board has nothing to do with this.
For these reasons, if you think
you have become a CO and are an
enlisted ROTC member, you may
wish to stop by the Office of
Special Services to discuss the
special problems and procedures
involved.
Further information about the
obligations and commitments
involved in ROTC programs may
be obtained from our office in
324 Old Union or from the ROTC
offices in the athletic building.

student in History, served as a

Committee on ROTC which

credit for ROTC at Stanford.

cadets are unsure of the extent of
their commitments and
obligations to their service. Some
want to know if they are in the
reserves or not. Others have been
confused about disenrollment and
discharge. This column is directed
to some of these questions.
As a rule of thumb, if you are
receiving money from ROTC you
are in the reserves. You are an
enlisted man assigned to Stanford
ROTC. This applies to all cadets
receiving financial assistance or
subsistance pay from ROTC.
If you are an ROTC cadet and
in the reserves, you are probably
obligated to six years duty. Army
non-scholarship cadets contract
for two years active duty, Navy
contract cadets for three, and all
scholarship, Navy Regular,
Marine, and Air Force category II
and 111 cadets for four. Air Force
I-P and I-N cadets (pilots and
navigators) are signed up for five
years of active duty upon receipt
of their aeronautical rating.
Whatever remains of your six-year
obligation after you've served
your active duty is spent in the
active and standby reserves.
Getting Out
Once in the reserves, getting
out can be difficult. You must
remember that you are both an
ROTC cadet and an enlisted man
in the reserves. You remain in the
enlisted reserves until you receive
your commission as an officer.
Disenrollment from ROTC is not
the same thing as discharge from
the reserves. You can be
disenrolled without being
discharged; some students have
found themselves in just that
situation. You need both
disenrollment and discharge
before you're back dealing with
your draft board.
Some reasons for
disenrollment, such as medical
disqualification, carry an almost
automatic discharge from the

reserves. Other reasons, such as
willful failure to complete
requirements or refusal to accept
a commission, can lead to
involuntary active duty in your
enlisted grade. Scholarship and
Air Force cadets can be ordered
to as much as four years
involuntary active duty, and other
cadets for up to two years
involuntary active duty.
Navy cadets can be both
disenrolled and discharged at their
own request with the detachment
commander's approval up to their
last two years of ROTC
instruction (or until they have
registered in the second year of a
two year program.) Enlisted
cadets in the other services and
Navy cadets in their last two years
must find some other grounds
such as hardship or inaptitude.
Such a request must be
investigated by some neutral
military board or individual, and
final decision is made at a level
higher than the local ROTC
detachment. The detachment
commander is required to
recommend either disenrollment
with discharge or disenrollment
and involuntary order to active
duty. Both recommendations have
been made in the past. In some
cases, such disenrollment has led
to discharge; in others, to
involuntary active duty.
F'iling a CO
All three services recognize
conscientious objection as a
reason for disenrollment and
discharge. To qualify for a CO
discharge you must meet the
criteria established by DOD
directive 1300.6 for conscientious
objectors. This involves filling out
a number of forms and seeing a
military chaplain, psychiatrist,
and legal officer. If you fail to
quality as a conscientious objector
in the opinjon of your service,
you are very likely to be
disenrolled from ROTC and
ordered involuntarily to active
duty as an enlisted man. This is a
simple procedure of changing
your inactive reserve status to

active reserve status. Your draft
board has nothing to do with this.
For these reasons, if you think
you have become a CO and are an
enlisted ROTC member, you may
wish to stop by the Office of
Special Services to discuss the
special problems and procedures
involved.
Further information about the
obligations and commitments
involved in ROTC programs may
be obtained from our office in
324 Old Union or from the ROTC
offices in the athletic building.

reserves or not. Others have been
confused about disenrollment and
discharge. This column is directed
to some of these questions.
As a rule of thumb, if you are
receiving money from ROTC you
are in the reserves. You are an
enlisted man assigned to Stanford
ROTC. This applies to all cadets
receiving financial assistance or
subsistance pay from ROTC.
If you are an ROTC cadet and
in the reserves, you are probably
obligated to six years duty. Army
non-scholarship cadets contract
for two years active duty, Navy
contract cadets for three, and all
scholarship, Navy Regular,
Marine, and Air Force category II
and 111 cadets for four. Air Force
I-P and I-N cadets (pilots and
navigators) are signed up for five
years of active duty upon receipt
of their aeronautical rating.
Whatever remains of your six-year
obligation after you've served
your active duty is spent in the
active and standby reserves.
Getting Out
Once in the reserves, getting
out can be difficult. You must
remember that you are both an
ROTC cadet and an enlisted man
in the reserves. You remain in the
enlisted reserves until you receive
your commission as an officer.
Disenrollment from ROTC is not
the same thing as discharge from
the reserves. You can be
disenrolled without being
discharged; some students have
found themselves in just that
situation. You need both
disenrollment and discharge
before you're back dealing with
your draft board.
Some reasons for
disenrollment, such as medical
disqualification, carry an almost
automatic discharge from the

reserves. Other reasons, such as
willful failure to complete
requirements or refusal to accept
a commission, can lead to
involuntary active duty in your
enlisted grade. Scholarship and
Air Force cadets can be ordered
to as much as four years
involuntary active duty, and other
cadets for up to two years
involuntary active duty.
Navy cadets can be both
disenrolled and discharged at their
own request with the detachment
commander's approval up to their
last two years of ROTC
instruction (or until they have
registered in the second year of a
two year program.) Enlisted
cadets in the other services and
Navy cadets in their last two years
must find some other grounds
such as hardship or inaptitude.
Such a request must be
investigated by some neutral
military board or individual, and
final decision is made at a level
higher than the local ROTC
detachment. The detachment
commander is required to
recommend either disenrollment
with discharge or disenrollment
and involuntary order to active
duty. Both recommendations have
been made in the past. In some
cases, such disenrollment has led
to discharge; in others, to
involuntary active duty.
F'iling a CO
All three services recognize
conscientious objection as a
reason for disenrollment and
discharge. To qualify for a CO
discharge you must meet the
criteria established by DOD
directive 1300.6 for conscientious
objectors. This involves filling out
a number of forms and seeing a
military chaplain, psychiatrist,
and legal officer. If you fail to
quality as a conscientious objector
in the opinjon of your service,
you are very likely to be
disenrolled from ROTC and
ordered involuntarily to active
duty as an enlisted man. This is a
simple procedure of changing
your inactive reserve status to

active reserve status. Your draft
board has nothing to do with this.
For these reasons, if you think
you have become a CO and are an
enlisted ROTC member, you may
wish to stop by the Office of
Special Services to discuss the
special problems and procedures
involved.
Further information about the
obligations and commitments
involved in ROTC programs may
be obtained from our office in
324 Old Union or from the ROTC
offices in the athletic building.

student in History, served as a
member of the Senate Ad Hoc
Committee on ROTC which
recommended discontinuance of
credit for ROTC at Stanford.
Edwards, a four year Air Force
ROTC cadet now seeking
discharge as a conscientious
objector, has a thorough
knowledge of the contractual
obligations of ROTC programs
and the problems and procedures
related to disenrollment and
discharge. He serves as a
consultant on such problems to
the Office of Special Services.)
