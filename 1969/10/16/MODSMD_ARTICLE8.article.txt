## Keeping Your Head 
### Cissie Bonini 
Dear Mom,
I injured my neck recently and
have to wear a neck brace and
collar. Many people think I am a
head transplant. What should I
do?

Dear Hedy,
It is hard to keep your head
during these troubled times. But
you mustn't be ashamed of your
new head, unless—of course —it
has dandruff. I knew they were
making heady advances in
medicine but this is really
mind-bending.
Love,
MOM
Dear Mom,
I live in the trailers and love it,
but I am bewildered about my
room-mates. They change almost
daily and I have trouble
remembering their names. Do you
think I have halitosis or a
displeasing personality quirk?
Worried

Dear Worried,
Have no fear, my dear. Like so
many other trailer residents, you
are returning to the wrong
residence each evening. This

problem is evidently unsolvable,
and I suggest you carry your
toothbrush and personal belongings
with you at all times. (You've
probably noticed trailer residents
wearing two sport coats and with
their dress shoes tied about their
necks by the shoe strings.)

However, the housing office
claims that the trailers can easily
be distinguished from one another
by the serial number on the
furnace.
The real worry, of course, is if
the trailers are used for married
housing . . .
Love,
MOM

pursuit and return to your studies.

TODAY'S ASTROLOGICAL
FORECAST: Do not attend
today. It may be cancelled for
lack of interest.
Dear Mom,
Is it true that Lewis B. Hershey
is being considered for University
Ombudsman?
Horrified
Dear Horrified?
Yes, he is being considered.
But rumor has it that a conflicting
offer from the Vatican for a Curia
position may intervene. There, as
you know, anyone over 75 is
draftable.
Religiously,
Mom
