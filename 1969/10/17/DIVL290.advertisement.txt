KLH OFFERS
SOMETHING NEW
Just for the record
I '*•I< < ■ > ■ I I
For all those people who think of the phonograph record as
THE source for music at home, KLH offers something new—A
great-sounding, all-out kind of phonograph that's just a
phonograph.
The new KLH* Model Twenty-Six has no built-in radio (AM
or FM) or tape recorder or home intercom. What it does have is
a level of performance that isn't supposed to come in some
thing as simple as a stereo phonograph. Inside it are the solid
state electronics usually reserved for an ambitious sound sys
tem, and the sort of speakers that aren't provided by many
more expensive systems and radio-phono combinations.
The specifics of the Model Twenty-Six include a Garrard auto
matic turntable made for KLH, a Pickering magnetic cartiridge
with diamond stylus, a 20 Watt (40 Watts EIA) solid-state
stereo amplifier, and a pair of two-way acoustic-suspension
speaker systems identical except for appearance to those of
the best-selling Model Twenty-Four stereo system.
If you should decide later to add a tape deck oi an AM-FM
tuner, the Model Twenty-Six has all the controls and jacks
you will need for them. But it doesn't force you, now or later, to
pay for anything you may not want.
All you have, then, is a simple and unobtrusive three-piece
stereo phonograph. Maybe the best you've ever heard. Come
in and see.
