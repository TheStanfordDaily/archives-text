# Minimum Pay Set For Staff
## 
### 
Full time University staff
members will receive a minimum
of $400 monthly, starting Dec. 1,
1969, President Pitzer announced
yesterday.
This and related changes in
staff wages and salaries are
expected to cost more than $1
million annually.
They were reported by Pitzer
in a series of budget revisions
approved by the Board of
Trustees earlier this week. Current
budget projections now indicate
the University will have to use
$1.5 million of unrestricted
reserves because anticipated
income will fall short of increased
expenditures during 1969-70.
This compares with
approximately $600,000 which
had to be used from unrestricted
reserves in the year ending Aug.
31, the first time in several years
that current income has failed to
match expenditures.
A major reduction in federal
research expenditures is the
principal reason for the much
larger call upon reserve funds
anticipated for 1969-70.
In a recent letter to Sen.
Russell Long, chairman fo the
U.S. Senate Committee on
Finance, Pitzer noted that the
University's 10-year financial
forecasts anticipate annual deficits
of $4 million or more by 1979 for
"an unacceptable minimum
program" of education, even if
private gifts grow from their
present annual rate of $29 million
to $50 million then.
The $400 monthly minimum
will cover staff members working
a 40-hour week. For those whose
current salary is above this rate,
there will be some selected
adjustments as rate ranges are
changed to reflect current local
competitive conditions. Wages and
salaries which are not changed as a
result of this special provision will
receive special attention during
the next annual reviews, covering
1970-71.

A special effort to update and
complete university-wide job
classifications and appropriate
rate ranges will be undertaken.
This study may be used in
determining the interim wage and
salary adjustments and as the basis
for the next annual reviews.
Other significant increases in
he budget revision provides for
recently announced new faculty
and staff positions related to the
University's minority programs.
Originally financed from
contingent funds, these are now
incorporated in the regular
budget.
A newly formed employees'
group, the United Stanford
Employees Steering Committee
was less than enthusiastic about
the announced pay raise. In a
statement released last night they
said, "This is not enough to live
on, as acknowledged by the
director of the Stanford
hospitalâ€”when granting a $450
minimum in response to demands
by a workers' organization at the
hospital.
"United Stanford Employees
(USF) has been circulating a
petition calling for the extension
of this $450 minimum to all
employees of the University. It
also calls for publishing the job
classifications and salary ranges.
"The possibility of an
organized drive by Stanford
employees to make the university
maintain a decent level of pay has
led the administration to make
this token response.
"Our position is that the
University should not commit
itself to establishing a minimum
pay level of $450 monthly for
salaried employees, $2.70 an hour
for hourly employees, and
comparable pay for part-time
workers. In addition, the
University must commit itself to
refrain from making cut-backs in
employment, which would force
some employees to take on the
burden of an increased work load.
