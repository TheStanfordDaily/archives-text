## Jackie's Judo 
### Art Buchwald 
Hard on the heels of Mary
Gallagher's best seller, "My Life
With Jacqueline Kennedy," comes
a new book of startling revelations
titled "I Was Jackie Kennedy
Onassis' Judo Instructor," written
by Chikara Hadaka of the
Grappling Falls Athletic Club.
Hadaka invited me to sit on his
mat as he told me how he came to
write the book.
"One day, pretty lady come to
me and say, 'Hadaka, I wish to
learn honorable sport of judo.'
"I say to lady, 'Why you want
to learn such honorable sport?'
"And she reply, 'Because I
want to go to the movies.'
"I say, 'Pretty Lady, why must
you learn honorable judo to go to
movies?'
"I Am Curious"
"And she say, 'Because I want
to see honorable "I Am Curious
(Yellow)."
"Ah, so,' I reply. 'Then I will
teach you so you will be able to
see not only honorable "I Am
Yellow" but also honorable "Oh
Calcutta."
"Pretty lady is very happy and
say, 'How much do lessons cost?'
I say, '$7 an hour.'
"She say, 'That is lot of
money.'
"I say, 'When I teach you, you
will be able to even see "Andy
Warhol." She say OK, providing I
no tell her husband how much
lessons cost."
"So," I said, "you taught her
the fundamentals of judo."
He said, "Pretty lady say she
want to learn certain techniques
to use against photographers. She
no interested in grappling or
double-knuckle rolls. She want to
concentrate on hand-and-hip
throws and the rear-double-lapel
tourniquet.
Two-Hand Slap
"I say, "I will teach you that,
but if you go to the movies you
must also learn "two-hand-slap
from a sitting position" and
"step-over-arm drag."
"She say, 'All right. Tench me
everything so I will be safe to go
to honorable "I Am Curious
(Yellow)."

"Was she a good pupil?"
"She learn fast. In one day she
shown 'single-arm hug,'
'feet-in-neck-and-hip' and
'shin-on-calf.' For exercises I hold
press camera, and she try to throw
me over shoulder. One day she
had me in near half-nelson, and she
say to me, 'Hadaka, I do not
know what I would do without
you.'
"I say, 'Jackie, I will remain in
this half-nelson as long as you
want me to.'
"We were very close to each
other. But that is not to say we
did not have trouble. For one
thing, ske keep buying new judo
pajamas, but she no want me to
tell her husband. She spend
$4,000 a week on new judo
clothes. Then she have me take to
secondhand judo clothes dealer
and sell them for her and bring
back money.
Judo Pajamas
"Once I admired a pair of judo
pajamas she was wearing and she
gave them to me for $65.
"All the same time she very
kind. One time she have me in
four-hammer lock for two hours.
And when I tell her it my wedding
anniversary, she let me go."
"It sounds as if she really was
an excellent pupil."
"Oh, yes. In short while she
become sixth-degree black belt.
When I inform her this, she bring
in beautiful jewel-encrusted
sword. Present from Shah of Iran.
She ask me to put the hewels
from sword on black belt. I say it
not possible and she very angry
and ask me, 'How can I go see
honorable "I Am Curious
(Yellow) without jewels on my
black belt?"
"Mr. Hadaka, why did you
decide to write this book and
violate Mrs. Onassis'confidence?"
"Because when she go to movie
and flip news photographer over
shoulder, she deny she know
honorable sport of judo and say
stupid photographer slip. Hadaka
lose face. So Hadaka call literary
agent and say, 'KIAI! I am ready
to talk!"

Gallagher's best seller, "My Life
