## After The Moratorium 
### Brad Cornell John Spiegel 
The paradox of a time in which
nothing seems above criticism is
that little appears worth
criticizing. Certainly meriting
attention, however, is
Wednesday's demonstration of
opposition to he war in Vietnam;
it is because we sympathize with
this opposition that we seek to
express our uneasiness with the
Moratorium.
The Vietnam Moratorium is in
the great moralistic tradition of
American political movements.
While directed toward pragmatic
political ends—prohibiting the sale
of liquor, regulating the trusts,
and now forcing troop
withdrawals—these movements are
at heart moral crusades, messianic
in their attempt to convert the un
enlightened to the proper ethical
position, and populist in their
assumption that the real cause of
social ilk is corruption in the seat
of power; in a political
Manicheanism that implicitly
identifies them with he good by
indignantly exposing the bad,
they single out for surgery a
cancer in the otherwise healthy
body politic. Thus we canvass the
suburbs to convince others of the
wrongness of the war, we "show
our concern" (and by implication
our righteousness), and we talk
constantly about the "moral
bankruptcy" of our country's
leaders.
But looking at the faces of
Cogswell Park marchers, talking to

wet and tired canvassers, we sense
that Vietnam signals the collapse
not of American morality (the
existence of which, after all, has
always been rather questionable),
but rather of American moralism.
Our generation is beginning to
suspect that, in this strange time,
good does not necessarily triumph
over evil, and that if the bad guys
have organization and technology
on their side, they will probably
win.
The government appears so
powerful, so rich, so impersonally
efficient, that it can absorb any
punch we throw; it promises to
withdraw men, sends more
instead, and when caught
red-handed ignores us and
promises more withdrawals. In
short, it can end the war or not, as
it pleases. Imperturbable and
inexorable, it grinds away
according to its own designs, such
is its control over information, its
ability to anticipate "trouble," its
reserves of force.
No More Judy Collins
Somehow the distinction
between good and evil, far from
being the essence of political
activity, has become an
anachronism, is the words of our
political scientists,
"dysfunctional". The distant
looks and resigned faces of
Wednesday's marchers were those
of the soldiers of Verdun rather
than of Judy Collins' ebullient
civil rights workers, who were
paying "freedom's price" in the

fight against "men of vice". The
optimistic enthusiasm of the early
sixties has ebbed away.
We find exceedingly welcome
the spirit of disillusionment which
we sensed at times in the
Moratorium. Our generation is
painfully disabusing itself of the
notion that our society's problems
result from a lack of moral
sensitivity among the
unenlightened or the malevolent.
Change of Consciousness
The problems ahead are simply
far too serious to be handled by
taking a day off from the routines
of everyday life. The problems
exist precisely because of the
nature of those routines and will
not be solved until we change the
routines and the consciousness
they engender. Change of
consciousness, not conscience, is
the only hope for us in the
frightening years ahead.
Such a change in consciousness
cannot, however, be brought
about by an application of the
individual's will. Though one may
attempt to become a Buddhist in
one's spare time, the essential
form of his consciousness is still
determined by the social world
into which he was socialized in
infancy and in which he continues
to live. Any real attempt to
"change one's head" requires a
concurrent change in social
institutions.
