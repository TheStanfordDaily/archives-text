## Sterling: 'Excellent Choice' 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Not all student reaction to
Chancellor Sterling's election to
the Board of Trustees was, as you
naively stated, "highly critical". I
for one, and also many of the
students I have since talked with,
think that Sterling is an excellenf
choice for the Board.
Having watched Sterling in
action since I came in the Fall of
1964, and especially having
worked with him on the
dedication of the Stanford-in-
Britain campus in 1966, I can
honestly say that he is a master at
causing progressive change in a
diplomatic manner. He has
repeatedly stated his support for
constructive change handled in a
responsible manner. His record,
just during the time I've been
here, is proof enough for me.
Chancellor Sterling is one of
the most diplomatic and tactful
men I have ever seen as well as a
believer in constructive change. In
these days of declining tact on the
part of student reformers, I think
we should all be thankful that we
have a man on the Board who can
distinguish the merits of a cause
from the manners of those
presenting it, and who can help
smooth the "ruffled feathers"
caused by the arrogance that
seems to be becoming a mark of
"the reformer".

Editor, THE DAILY:
Last week, the film critic of
The Daily confessed with humility
he had not seen, or ever heard of,
"El Verdago," an excellent film
but probably too recent to be
mentioned in the film-literature
he compiles weekly for The Daily.
This week, he considers
"Sansho the Bailiff" as an obscure
film. Still Kenji Mizoguchi is one*
of the most prestigious directors
of Japan and "Sansho the Bailiff"
is one of his major works.

I often regret that the reviews
of The Daily on films are not first
hand comments. But I would
expect the documentation
available to The Daily to be more
complete.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The article about Austria in
Friday's Daily was the fourth
stupid article about my country
that you're printed in the past
two years. Austria, says the
writer, "is a mysterious blend on
(sic) past and present, of East and
West. She can make one
uncomfortable or (sic)
comfortable depending upon
one's capacity to live with a
mystery." The writer paints a
picture of a playground and wax
museum where students can get
their "kulchur" for only 40 cents.
This superficial, tourist
attitude is a major factor in
preventing communication
between our peoples. If I came to
this country with the same
attitude, I would have arrived
wearing cowboy boots and rushed
off, to such American culture
spots as Hollywood, Disneyland
and Miami Beach. How much of
an understanding of your country
would I get if I came with such an
attitude?"
Stanford students who have
been to Austria say they were
disappointed at being unable to
get to know the natives well. This
isn't surprising since American
students in Europe travel in
groups and therefore isolate
themselves even when they aren't
on campus.
The article asks the question,
"What is surrounding
Austria . . .", which is followed by
the wrong answer, " . . .The
Eastern European Countries of
Yugoslavia, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia." In fact, Austria
shares more than half of its border

with Italy, W. Germany, and
Switzerland. Rather than going to
Europe to see police use tanks and
teargas, as the author suggests, a
Stanford student might get a
better exposure here at home.

• Riddled Sphinx
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday, I was entertained
by an incredibly asinine article
about Stanford-in-Austria. Calling
Austria a "sphinx whose riddle
seems incomprehensible to most
Americans," the article prattled
on whistfully about 40 cent opera
tickets, the Vienna Boys Chorus
and the friendly rural folk.
Apparently the author views
Austria as a story-book country
where play is the major concern
of all.
The article called to mind
many of the infantile "travelog"
films I was exposed to in
elementary school. These films all
had a characteristic patronizing
attitude. When I hear so many
people today talking about he
need for communication between
persons, such narrow-minded,
patronizing drivel is not only
stupid, it is offensive.
The article concluded by
mentioning the rare opportunity a
visitor to Austria has to view the
evils of Communism by crossing
the border. The author states, "A
student . . .can learn
much . . .from the sight of tanks
and the string of tear gas on an
anniversary day (in
Chechoslovakia)." If a student
wants to learn about teargas,
perhpas he should drop over to
Berkeley or SRI during one of the
demonstrations.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Bill Banks' hitchhiking
problem (article Oct. 16) is not all
in his thumb, some of it is located
much father up in the system.
I am middle aged, drive a big
car and usually go right on by the
guy who has his thumb out. Why,
when I have all that room and am
only slightly paranoid? Easy. I
don't know where he is going and
every time I stop it turns out he is
going to Encina and I am going to
the Med. School.
Hold up a large Med. School
sign and I'll gladly take you there.

Last week, the film critic of
The Daily confessed with humility
he had not seen, or ever heard of,
"El Verdago," an excellent film
but probably too recent to be
mentioned in the film-literature
he compiles weekly for The Daily.
This week, he considers
"Sansho the Bailiff" as an obscure
film. Still Kenji Mizoguchi is one*
of the most prestigious directors
of Japan and "Sansho the Bailiff"
is one of his major works.

I often regret that the reviews
of The Daily on films are not first

expect the documentation

•'Mysterious Blend
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article about Austria in
Friday's Daily was the fourth
stupid article about my country
that you're printed in the past
two years. Austria, says the
writer, "is a mysterious blend on
(sic) past and present, of East and
West. She can make one
uncomfortable or (sic)
comfortable depending upon
one's capacity to live with a
mystery." The writer paints a
picture of a playground and wax
museum where students can get
their "kulchur" for only 40 cents.
This superficial, tourist
attitude is a major factor in
preventing communication
between our peoples. If I came to
this country with the same
attitude, I would have arrived
wearing cowboy boots and rushed
off, to such American culture
spots as Hollywood, Disneyland
and Miami Beach. How much of
an understanding of your country
would I get if I came with such an
attitude?"
Stanford students who have
been to Austria say they were
disappointed at being unable to
get to know the natives well. This
isn't surprising since American
students in Europe travel in
groups and therefore isolate
themselves even when they aren't
on campus.
The article asks the question,
"What is surrounding
Austria . . .", which is followed by
the wrong answer, " . . .The
Eastern European Countries of
Yugoslavia, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia." In fact, Austria
shares more than half of its border

with Italy, W. Germany, and
Switzerland. Rather than going to
Europe to see police use tanks and
teargas, as the author suggests, a
Stanford student might get a
better exposure here at home.

• Riddled Sphinx
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday, I was entertained
by an incredibly asinine article
about Stanford-in-Austria. Calling
Austria a "sphinx whose riddle
seems incomprehensible to most
Americans," the article prattled
on whistfully about 40 cent opera
tickets, the Vienna Boys Chorus
and the friendly rural folk.
Apparently the author views
Austria as a story-book country
where play is the major concern
of all.
The article called to mind
many of the infantile "travelog"
films I was exposed to in
elementary school. These films all
had a characteristic patronizing
attitude. When I hear so many
people today talking about he
need for communication between
persons, such narrow-minded,
patronizing drivel is not only
stupid, it is offensive.
The article concluded by
mentioning the rare opportunity a
visitor to Austria has to view the
evils of Communism by crossing
the border. The author states, "A
student . . .can learn
much . . .from the sight of tanks
and the string of tear gas on an
anniversary day (in
Chechoslovakia)." If a student
wants to learn about teargas,
perhpas he should drop over to
Berkeley or SRI during one of the
demonstrations.

I am middle aged, drive a big

Chancellor Sterling is one of

comfortable depending upon
one's capacity to live with a
mystery." The writer paints a
picture of a playground and wax
museum where students can get
their "kulchur" for only 40 cents.
This superficial, tourist
attitude is a major factor in

attitude, I would have arrived
wearing cowboy boots and rushed

been to Austria say they were

get to know the natives well. This
isn't surprising since American
students in Europe travel in
groups and therefore isolate
themselves even when they aren't
on campus.
The article asks the question,
"What is surrounding
Austria . . .", which is followed by
the wrong answer, " . . .The
Eastern European Countries of
Yugoslavia, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia." In fact, Austria
shares more than half of its border

with Italy, W. Germany, and

teargas, as the author suggests, a
Stanford student might get a

• Riddled Sphinx
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday, I was entertained
by an incredibly asinine article
about Stanford-in-Austria. Calling
Austria a "sphinx whose riddle
seems incomprehensible to most
Americans," the article prattled
on whistfully about 40 cent opera
tickets, the Vienna Boys Chorus
and the friendly rural folk.
Apparently the author views
Austria as a story-book country
where play is the major concern
of all.
The article called to mind
many of the infantile "travelog"
films I was exposed to in
elementary school. These films all
had a characteristic patronizing
attitude. When I hear so many
people today talking about he
need for communication between
persons, such narrow-minded,
patronizing drivel is not only
stupid, it is offensive.
The article concluded by
mentioning the rare opportunity a
visitor to Austria has to view the
evils of Communism by crossing
the border. The author states, "A
student . . .can learn
much . . .from the sight of tanks
and the string of tear gas on an
anniversary day (in
Chechoslovakia)." If a student
wants to learn about teargas,
perhpas he should drop over to
Berkeley or SRI during one of the
demonstrations.

• Handy Thumb
Editor, THE DAILY:
Bill Banks' hitchhiking
problem (article Oct. 16) is not all
in his thumb, some of it is located
much father up in the system.
I am middle aged, drive a big
car and usually go right on by the
guy who has his thumb out. Why,
when I have all that room and am
only slightly paranoid? Easy. I
don't know where he is going and
every time I stop it turns out he is
going to Encina and I am going to
the Med. School.
Hold up a large Med. School

Not all student reaction to
Chancellor Sterling's election to
the Board of Trustees was, as you
naively stated, "highly critical". I
for one, and also many of the
students I have since talked with,
think that Sterling is an excellenf
choice for the Board.
Having watched Sterling in
action since I came in the Fall of
1964, and especially having
worked with him on the
dedication of the Stanford-in-
Britain campus in 1966, I can
honestly say that he is a master at
causing progressive change in a
diplomatic manner. He has
repeatedly stated his support for
constructive change handled in a
responsible manner. His record,
just during the time I've been
here, is proof enough for me.
Chancellor Sterling is one of
the most diplomatic and tactful
men I have ever seen as well as a
believer in constructive change. In
these days of declining tact on the
part of student reformers, I think
we should all be thankful that we
have a man on the Board who can
distinguish the merits of a cause
from the manners of those
presenting it, and who can help
smooth the "ruffled feathers"
caused by the arrogance that
seems to be becoming a mark of
"the reformer".

Last week, the film critic of
The Daily confessed with humility
he had not seen, or ever heard of,
"El Verdago," an excellent film

mentioned in the film-literature
he compiles weekly for The Daily.
This week, he considers
"Sansho the Bailiff" as an obscure
film. Still Kenji Mizoguchi is one*
of the most prestigious directors
of Japan and "Sansho the Bailiff"
is one of his major works.
