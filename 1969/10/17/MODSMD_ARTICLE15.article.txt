# Moratorium Explained To Area Residents
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
Wednesday's Moratorium, which drew 2,000
canvassers to Midpeninsula homes and 8,000
people to a rally on campus, was not the product
of a leader's dream-come-true. It was a mass
movement, making up in enthusiasm what it
lacked in organization.
The success or failures of its activities were the
end result of a decentralized volunteer effort. Like
the McCarthy, Kennedy, and McGovern campaigns
of 1968, it was an amateur campaign.
It began this summer in Washington when Pat
Shea, member of ASSU's Council of Presidents,
signed the statement supporting the Moratorium.
Returning to Palo Alto, he joined forces with Dr
Martin Perl and Dr. Martin Carnoy to ready
Stanford for the Moratorium.
"I l Just Grew "
Explains Shea, "From then on, it just grew."
From the original nucleus, which included
students John Kramer and John Silver, the
organization spread.
"We got volunteers from the sign-up lists in
White Plaza, indicated Sue Block, one the early
staff members. "There were some old McCarthy
lists around, but those were really out of date."
A number of staff members were recruited
from White Plaza. Pryne Clement, chariman of
Central Services, "signed up on Thursday. I was

called Friday night, although I'd put my name way
down on the list since it was a hard assignment.
When they called me, I took it."
Grad student Rich Luhring, who with
undergrad Jim Wyatt supervised the canvassing,
also got involved on Friday. "I signed up for the
canvassing committee, and when we met, the
chairman's first words were, '1 hope somebody
here knows more about this than I do.'"
Local Coordination
Working with Wyatt and Luhring were Alan
Houghtelein, an undergrad, and Mrs. Margaret
Stein of the Concerned Citizens of Palo Alto. Mrs.
Stein provided the basis of precinct organization,
getting 60-70 houses in the Midpeninsula to serve
as precinct headquarters for the Moratorium. The
Sunnyvale Democratic Club later added 16 houses
to be used in that area. Sunday night, a meeting
was held to match up volunteers with precincts.
Said Luhring, "it wouldn't have been done
without a lot of people using their heads. . . these
individual leaders deserve a lot of credit."
As for the Novemeber Moratorium, Pat Shea
said, "we hope we'll stay together for then." Other
staff members and volunteers while anticipating
better organization for November, had more
immediate concerns. "Thank God," said one girl as
she closed up her desk last night, "Now I can wash
my hair and sleep."

Stein of the Concerned Citizens of Palo Alto. Mrs.
Stein provided the basis of precinct organization,
getting 60-70 houses in the Midpeninsula to serve
as precinct headquarters for the Moratorium. The
Sunnyvale Democratic Club later added 16 houses
to be used in that area. Sunday night, a meeting
was held to match up volunteers with precincts.
Said Luhring, "it wouldn't have been done
without a lot of people using their heads. . . these
individual leaders deserve a lot of credit."
As for the Novemeber Moratorium, Pat Shea
said, "we hope we'll stay together for then." Other
staff members and volunteers while anticipating
better organization for November, had more
immediate concerns. "Thank God," said one girl as
she closed up her desk last night, "Now I can wash
my hair and sleep."

Wednesday's Moratorium, which drew 2,000
canvassers to Midpeninsula homes and 8,000
people to a rally on campus, was not the product
of a leader's dream-come-true. It was a mass
movement, making up in enthusiasm what it
lacked in organization.
The success or failures of its activities were the
end result of a decentralized volunteer effort. Like
the McCarthy, Kennedy, and McGovern campaigns
of 1968, it was an amateur campaign.
It began this summer in Washington when Pat
Shea, member of ASSU's Council of Presidents,
signed the statement supporting the Moratorium.
Returning to Palo Alto, he joined forces with Dr
Martin Perl and Dr. Martin Carnoy to ready
Stanford for the Moratorium.
"I l Just Grew "
Explains Shea, "From then on, it just grew."
From the original nucleus, which included
students John Kramer and John Silver, the
organization spread.
"We got volunteers from the sign-up lists in
White Plaza, indicated Sue Block, one the early
staff members. "There were some old McCarthy
lists around, but those were really out of date."
A number of staff members were recruited
from White Plaza. Pryne Clement, chariman of
Central Services, "signed up on Thursday. I was

called Friday night, although I'd put my name way
down on the list since it was a hard assignment.
When they called me, I took it."
Grad student Rich Luhring, who with
undergrad Jim Wyatt supervised the canvassing,
also got involved on Friday. "I signed up for the
canvassing committee, and when we met, the
chairman's first words were, '1 hope somebody
here knows more about this than I do.'"
Local Coordination
Working with Wyatt and Luhring were Alan
Houghtelein, an undergrad, and Mrs. Margaret
Stein of the Concerned Citizens of Palo Alto. Mrs.
Stein provided the basis of precinct organization,
getting 60-70 houses in the Midpeninsula to serve
as precinct headquarters for the Moratorium. The
Sunnyvale Democratic Club later added 16 houses
