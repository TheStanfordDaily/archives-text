# Protesters Leaflet Workers; High Schools Discuss War
## 
### 
Meeting little hostility, sixty
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) distributed 5000 anti-war
leaflets to employees arriving at
Stanford Industrial Park Wednes
day morning.
An estimated 50 percent of the
incoming workers slowed enough
before entering their link
fence-protected parking lots to
accept notices demanding total

withdrawal of U.S. forces from
Vietnam.
SDS had leaflets specially
prepared for Lockheed, Fairchild
and Watkins-Johnson, but the
center of activity was the
Hewlett-Packard entrance on Page
Mill Road.
There a tight-lipped security
guard with a two-way radio ("for
communications within the

plant") said no extra precautions
had been taken by the industrial
firms.
In front of him, nine protesters
passed out leaflets at the parking
entrance, and advanced and
retreated into the street to greet
cars as the traffic lights changed.
'No Difference'
"It (the demonstration) won't
make any difference," the guard
said. "We had these things before,
you know."
Meanwhile, some leaflets were
accepted in silence, some with
polite thanks. Other people
expressed disapproval with
grim-faced acceleration.
Loud or profane responses by
employees were rare, and no
incidents marred the peaceful
action.
"That's all right," said one
Lockheed employee refusing a
leaflet at the Hannover St.
entrance, "I'm with you all the
way."
Another Lockheed worker at
the same entrance joined the two
students at the driveway,
frequently taking leaflets to those
who drove in without stopping.
The demonstration had no
effect on the 7:30-8:30 rush
traffic patterns, but the rainy
weather apparently did. "There's
a bunch of idiots who can't make
left turns," said the operator of
the traffic light controls
explaining the congested lanes
funneling into the H-P lot.
Walking Tour
Wednesday afternoon SDS led a
two-hour walking tour, and 45
followers were shown prominent
locations from last spring's
demonstrations and were told of
the park's relations with the
university.
The group was followed by a
crew of picture-taking private
detectives, and was met with
movie cameras and sound
recording devices in front of
Lockheed.
High School Student? Active
Though college students
received most of the publicity,
high school students also
participated in Wednesday's
Moratorium. Almost 500 students
from Palo Alto's three high
schools stayed away from school
in order to participate while all
schools had at least some sort of
Moratorium activity on campus.
The Palo Alto schools—Gunn,
Cubberley, and Palo
Alto—allowed their students to
take "warranted" absences
providing they had written
excuses from home. Many
students left school without
permission. Students from these
three schools were much in
evidence at the noontime march
through downtown Palo Alto.
The schools of both the
Sequoia Union and Mountain
View-Los Altos Union High School
Districts all officially reported
very little change from normal
attendance. In both these districts
there were no "warranted"
excuses allowed. However, at
every school there were assemblies
or discussions of the war.
Palo Alto High had a voluntary
assembly after school on Tuesday,
attended by roughly 100 students.
Pat Shea, of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, spoke. Cubberley High
had a debate, and Gunn supported
a voluntary assembly after school
Wednesday. In addition, all three
schools encouraged discussions of
the war in all social studies classes.
Franklin Vs. Popov
The debate at Cubberley
featured Stanford's Bruce
Franklin, Maoist English
professor, and Milorad Popov of
the Hoover Institution The often
volatile debate was over the
question of removing all U.S.
forces by January, 1970. Popov
deplored US policy, but affirmed
his belief in the premises of
American involvement, warning of
more "wars of national
liberation."
Student groups and
community organizations have
been actively leafleting near all
three schools foi (lie past week.
