# God, Orgasm, Loneliness, And Death

### 
. . .sometimes when 1 am
pleased within myself, hot for him
to stride my curves, 1 look at us in
a blue-grass pastel pink
i mirror . . .my eyes wander in the
wind wishing his brown seeds
were mine, now . . .my eyes stroll
thin past the falling parks noticing
the scratchin'gs of first loven
times. . .my man and I've never
fucked or just did the
'doing-it'.. .we, he and 1 would
draw our want and thoughts on
each others' fleshy frame . . his
body .. .of oh his manly strange
body . . .while we're in our high
rise feels and our screams of that
good heavenly trimmed
satisfaction . . I see him as black
rain and wait for him to
harden . . .yeah, 1 noticed the
head stretching and reaching to
get in and thru . . .you
know . . .like a special
arrow-rod . . .with our etchings in
sweat . . .pores in oceanic ripple,
our tendons tense to admire and
worship those waves into beached
sanded oneness . . .
. . .the loser, the joker, the
lover. . .the Dutchman . . .by
baby is doomed in all his
coming.. .cause he'll be washed
to shore in time . . .no
energy . . .cold sweat stains stuck
pastely around his navel, groin
and bottom of his spine . . .with
hardly no breath for the living or
dead and he'll rise off my mound
when I think then of me being no

more place than home . . .he is
with me for sure as sure as ever
can be for sure . . .

. . .God, Orgasm, Loneliness
and Death, as experienced thru
the flesfe and Times of Black
People/alive and dead/from a
universal East Coast American hip
to the waning Sun Gods of Pacific
California, came to Stanford
University last Spring as the first
extensive multi-media exploration
as heavy ladened Trips for a
timeless feeling of artistic intent
to the end of providing final
plateaus of highs and highers for
many hands and eyes of hands left
expanding from the audience into
the minds of the Fourth Stream
Expressionists, who had just
arrived with the Sun, Eyes, Rain,
and blood . . .(breath).
And again this year on Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday, October 1
17, 18, 19 . . .
3 Pisces, 1 Cancer, 2 Geminis
(castor and Polux), one Leo, 2
Capricorns, 1 Libra (a mescaline
balance suspended for Calvin
Holland Jr., entered by the Sun
about September 23) 2
Acquarians, 2 Scorpios lending
sculpture to light as mentality,
and other artists black and white
like the drummer, John Felder,
the bass player, Chris Christy,
Kenny the saxaphonist, dancers,
photographers, sculptures, poets,
and poetess . . ./these hands of
Fourth Stream Expression are
reproducing the Four Faces of
Blackness (II)/for all the artists of

all worlds as One in Darkness of
Moon and mind.
As we said last year in
explanation of ourselves and our
work . . .'The Four Faces of
Blackness' is not a movie or a play
s in concert, it is more a difficult
1 production of beauty and
' profound projection of a
' country . . .Blackness . . .involving
| the coordination of several
different and controlled medias of
expression and insight . . .the end
is simply to collect, suggest, and
1 project what has never really been
1 told about existences in
. Blackness . . .Scenes on the streets
of Chicago's Southside, New
York's subway people and
; Harlem, San Francisco's Fillmore
and your own memories as you
have passed by 'those kind of
places' so many times before
without ever really hearing Eric
Dolphy, or Billy, or Bird . . .or
any of those crazy niggers, any
way
. . .Yeah and all this just to
promote four themes of Blackness
into the memory of its audience
with a different kind of honesty
as pure as the organsm you feel
when it's just you and your
woman this time. And that's
supposed to be a trip . . .so they
say. And it is for once, whether
you're stoned out of your skull or
as sober as the cats who did that
moon thing this summer . . .
Elementally the Moods and
Textures of the program are
painted by the Music of Smoke in
a stream of consciousness

pertormance which predicts the
future sound evolving from
contemporary Black Music. Visual
imagery, lights, synchronized
movement of space are
manipulated with the special
effects of photography
coordinated to the specific themes
acted out by four choreographers
of Black Dance. The Third
medium is the Word, and the
return of Kilory with he twisting
imagery of Black Poetry.
For those of you who dug the
show last year, two times or
whatever, check yourself again,
because this time there have been
a great number of revisions in the
photography, major changes in
the sound track and its special
effects, and the addition of
dancers . . .so things could never
be the same as long as they evolve
into a different kind" of
excellence.
Torches will be burning out in
front of Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Friday 17, Saturday 18, and
Sunday 19 at 7:30 and again at
10:00 p.m. Unfortunately there
will only be one showing on
Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Proceeds for
Sunday nights perfonnance will
be given to the East Palo Alto Day
School to buy something as basic
as books for black children in
Nairobi. Maybe Nixon really did
have an Operation Intercept and
maybe it is a tight year for highs
and that kind of other joy . . .but
if you can get it together, smoke
what you can and come by and
feel God, Orgasm, Loneliness and
Death . . .it has everything to do
with the living and the Dead . . .
