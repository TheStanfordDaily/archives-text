# Coming Home to Roost
## Trailers: People's Park? 
### Mark Weinberger 
I watched wkh dismay over the
summer as the remaining buffer
zone between the
Wilb ur-Stern - Branner-Crothers-
Toyon complex and Escondido
Village began to evaporate.
First, those yellow
monstrosities that push, pull, dig,
and generally disturb the earth
descended on the weed-top open
field next to Branner. Within two
months this patch of earth was to
be transformed into a sea of
green-painted-trailers named
Manzanita Park, a title no doubt
bestowed by some bureaurcrat
who though it would be funny to
see how far his little joke would

e The trouble is, no one saw his
?r humor. Manzanita Park shall go
e into Stanford's gilt-edged history,
s- The yard is, admittedly, better
0 than a tent city in Frost
Amphitheater, which would cause
v all sorts of social diseases,
r Escondido Village
h The other bit of construction
that will complete the bridge
3 between academia and residence is
3 the addition to Escondido Village
112 that began in late August across
j Campus Drive from the sparkling
t new trailer park. Those yellow
t beasts are now hard at work
3 chewing up the university's latest
1 offerings.
It seems that not only is the
university placating the yellow
beasts with that last open patch of
land, it is putting the current
Escondido residents into the
position of Sugar Daddy for the
Escondido addition. That's really
adding insult to injury.
But the Escondido people can
fight their own battles. It's those
vomit-green railroad cars that will
provide shelter for at least five
years' worth of undergraduates
that stick in my mind.
Memorandum
The reason I get those bad
vibes every time I skirt Campus
Drive and pass by the metal farm
is summed up by a memo passed
to trailer residents by Robert and
Linda Fries, directors of the park.
Their note reads, in part:
"So you've noticed the grim
and barren exteriors of the
trailers! Although painting is not
permitted, any show of
individuality which will not
permanently affect the
appearance is encouraged. What
are your suggestions for the
decoration of the trailors?
"Prior to our moving in, there
were many pessimistic predictions
about student reaction to the
trailer park. As it turns out,
however, people have found the
trailers very liveable. We think
that the prevailing opinion should
be made known to the Stanford
community as a whole. Writing a
letter to the Daily would be a
good way to uo this. If you feel
especially jolly about your new
home, expostulate."
Trailer lovers, unite and write!
Propagandize about those
sumptuous interiors. Educate the
community about the joys of
exterior decorating. Describe the
"flower boxes, potted plants, even
trellises" with which the Fries'
encourage you to adorn your
abode.
M uddling
If this isn't muddling through,
it comes exceedingly close. Make
the best of the situation, and be
thankful things aren't worse.
Thank your lucky stars you have a
roof over your head. Mask your
bad breath with a flower box
Cert.
There was a rumor floating
around that the student trailerites
were going to attempt to change
the park's name to Hooverville,
certainly an apt label. The Daily
staff's proposal for namehood
over the summer was The
Cannery, but the wily
administration beat us into print
with the fresh air-and-purity title.
Resist
My suggestion is to make those
bureaucrats and administrators
suffer a bit. Instead of supinely
accepting the disease of
bureaucratisitis as given, I say
resist.
A bit of psychedelia applied to
those bleak exteriors, a touch of

clinging ivy to envelop a trailer or
two, a few tents to protect those
tin roofs from the gods, and
perhaps a few outdoor barbeque
pits might make decision makers
think twice before passing up the
needs of the student community
the next time priorities for this
institution are reevaluated.
Don't baby your trailers. Make
love to them!

There was a rumor floating
around that the student trailerites
were going to attempt to change
the park's name to Hooverville,
certainly an apt label. The Daily
staff's proposal for namehood
over the summer was The

Resist
My suggestion is to make those
bureaucrats and administrators
suffer a bit. Instead of supinely
accepting the disease of
bureaucratisitis as given, I say
resist.
A bit of psychedelia applied to
those bleak exteriors, a touch of

clinging ivy to envelop a trailer or
two, a few tents to protect those
tin roofs from the gods, and
perhaps a few outdoor barbeque
pits might make decision makers
think twice before passing up the
needs of the student community

monstrosities that push, pull, dig,

It seems that not only is the
university placating the yellow

land, it is putting the current

Escondido addition. That's really
adding insult to injury.

Memorandum
The reason I get those bad
vibes every time I skirt Campus

is summed up by a memo passed
to trailer residents by Robert and
Linda Fries, directors of the park.
Their note reads, in part:
"So you've noticed the grim
and barren exteriors of the
trailers! Although painting is not
permitted, any show of
individuality which will not
permanently affect the
appearance is encouraged. What
are your suggestions for the
decoration of the trailors?
"Prior to our moving in, there
were many pessimistic predictions
about student reaction to the
trailer park. As it turns out,
however, people have found the
trailers very liveable. We think
that the prevailing opinion should
be made known to the Stanford
community as a whole. Writing a
letter to the Daily would be a
