# Roble Coed Floors Approved By Error
## 
### TINA COOPER 
When the slow wheels of
bureaucracy miss a turn, the
inevitable confusion usually does
nobody any good. Not so this
time.
There are now two coed
corridors in Roble Hall because of
a mix-up between Dean Of
Students Peter Bulkeley and the
dorm's directors over
responsibilities.
The idea of coed corridors was
first introduced early last year in
Roble by John and Nancy Palmer,
the hall directors. They polled the
Roble residents on whether or not
they would like this type of
corridor in their dormitory. The
students voted overwhelmingly in
favor of the idea, and it was
decided to suggest it as an
experiment to the Dean of
Students office.
When the suggestion was made,
the students were advised to wait
until the new Dean, Peter
Bulkeley, took office, so they
could get his approval for the
plan. The Dean's office said it
could take no action until this
approval was given.
Plans As Usual
In anticipation of Bulkeley's
sanction, a chart of the two
corridors was drawn up early in
May for interested Roble-ites to
sign up for specific rooms on the
two corridors. Priority was given
to students who had lived in more
crowded conditions that year. A
proportion was set up so that the
ratio of seniors, juniors and
sophomores on the two halls
corresponded to the ratio
throughout Roble. Since all this
occurred last year, there are no
freshmen on the corridor.
Bulkeley visited Roble early in
June. In a recent interview, he
stated that he saw the chart with
the names of students on the wall,
and received the impression that
the corridors had already been
approved by the previous dean,
Joel Smith. He said nothing about
the chart to the hall directors,
who assumed by his silence that
he had no objection to the
corridors.
In September the
administration officially
discovered that the two coed
corridors in Roble were an
accomplished fact. Since the
Housing Office tries not to change
rooming assignments once
students are established in a room,
the administration accepted the
fait accompli with a minimum of
publicity.
Why The Hell Not?
When asked his opinion of the
corridors, Bulkeley stated: "My
expectations are that the men and

women in those two corridors will
develop healthy relationships. I do
not oppose that type of living; I
approve of it if it can be
demonstrated to the University
community that these young
people will have no added
academic or social problems."
He added, "If people can do it
and get along, why the hell not?"
There are 23 women and 26
men, including tutors, on the two
corridors. Since the rooms
involved are all singles, there was a
tendency for friends to sign up for
facing or adjoining rooms. Due to
this grouping, there is as yet little
sense of community on the two
corridors.
The students in Roble do not
understand why there should be
any campus reaction at all to what
they are doing. When asked their
opinions of coed living, they
seemed to agree that it is really
not that exciting, but a perfectly
normal and natural thing. One girl
stated that the only reason she
was on the corridor was to get a
single room.
