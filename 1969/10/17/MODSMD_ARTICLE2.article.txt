# Population Con fab, Too
## Development Meeting Here 
### 
John Kenneth Galbraith,
folksinger Pete Seeger, and
Congressman Paul N (Pete)
McCloskey are among the
speakers scheduled to address two
different conferences on campus
this weekend.
Galbraith, a Harvard economist
and critic of the Vietnam war, has
served as president of the liberal
Americans for Democratic Action
and has been described as
America's "All-Purpose Critic."
His address will highlight a
day-and-a-half symposium titled
Technology and the Third World
organized by the Graduate
Student Association of Stanford
University. The Conference will
investigate different theories of
economic development.
Ernest Mandel, a Belgian
Marxist economist, was scheduled
to present an alternative
philosophy to Galbraith's.
However, Mandel, a Trotskyite
and a leader of the Fourth
International, was denied a visa by

the United States Department of
State. Efforts of the University,
Senator Alan Cranston, and
Congressman McCloskey to have
the State Department's decision
reversed were unsuccessful.
Graduate student response to
the State Department's action
ranged from disbelief to
expressions of anger. Steve
Weissman, a participant at the
symposium, pointed out that the
Department seems "to have
something against Marxist
economists. Over half the world
bases its economic policies on
Marxist ideas yet most students in
the U.S. can get no decent
understanding of those ideas or
how they might be applied to this
country."
Even though he has been
denied a visa to come to the U.S.,
Mandel will have a chance to air
his views at th< conference on
Saturday. Mandei has forwarded a
tape recording of his remarks to
Dick Miles, president of the

Graduate Student Association.
The tape will be played at 9 a.m.
in Memorial Church. After the
tape is played, Mandel will
exchange ideas with Galbraith in
an amplified trans-Atlantic
telephone conversation.
Panel Discussions
Galbraith's speech Friday
evening at eight o'clock will be
followed on Saturday by a series
of panel discussions aimed at
questions that can be approached
meaningfully from different
philosophies. Among the
participants at these discussions
will be Richard Holton, Dean of
the Business School at Cal, Art
Malville, an activist priest from
Guatamala, Paul Bundy, St. Ciair
Drake, Dudly Kirk, Peter Diets,
Mark Mancall, and others.
The symposium will be
centered at Memorial Auditorium
Friday, and Memorial Church on
Saturday morning, and is open to
all interested persons without
charge. Professor Galbraith will
meet with the press at 12:45 p.m.
today at the San Francisco
International Airport.
Population Conference
Twelve hundred students from
eight-five northern California high
schools will meet at Stanford
Saturday from 9 until 4 to debate
specific issues of the population
explosion. Among the subjects to
be considered are: birth control,
sex education, legalized abortion,
and international cooperation for
population and environmental
control.
The conference, sponsored by
the California State Teachers
Association and the Stanford
University Biological Sciences
Department, will be open only to
previously registered high school
students.
Speakers at the morning
meeting besides Seeger and
Congressman McCloskey include
President Pitzer, Bishop J. Kilmer
Myers of California's Episcopal
Diocese, and population biologist
Prof. Paul R. Ehrlich of Stanford.
The conference proceedings will
be broadcast live on radio station
KPFA-FM, 94.1.
