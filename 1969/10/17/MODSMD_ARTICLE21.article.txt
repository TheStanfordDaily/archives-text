Vul: Both Opening lead: Heart deuce
North-South were playing the weak no-trump,
where an opening bid of INT shows a balanced
hand (possibly including a five-card minor), with
no singletons or voids and at most one doubleton,
and 11 to 14 high card points.
So North ended up as declarer. East made the
disastrous lead of a low heart—his best suit—after
commenting, "Really informative bidding,
fellows." North took the trick with the queen,
successfully finessed spades, and then set up a club
trick—making five no trump, with six diamonds,
two hearts, two spades, and a club.
"Fixed," muttered East, "by the weak
no-trump. Noramlly, South would be declarer," he
added, presenting this possible bidding:

"Hold it," said South, after examining the
defenders card for a few seconds. "I think I'd
make five also despite the fact that the heart king

and club jack are both off side." And he
proceeded to explain.
West's only natural lead against 3NT is the 10
of spades. The lead pretty well tells South, now
declarer, that East has the spade king. He plays
low from dummy, East follows low, and South
wins with his queen.
"Now," South said, "I first cash three diamond
tricks (North and East pitching clubs on the third
round), so that both of you are out of that suit.
Then I lead the nine of hearts from my hand,
letting it ride if West plays low, or covering his
jack with my queen."
This leaves the following position (assuming
West covers the heart):

"East is now in with the king of hearts, and no
matter what he leads, he gives me a free finesse
and my eleventh trick. A heart finesses his ten, a
spade finesses his king, and a club finesses his
jack," concluded South.
"I get six diamonds, the queen of spades, the
aces of spades and hearts, my natural club trick,
plus whatever trick East wants to give me now."
"Big deal," said East. "How many players are
going to find an endplay at trick five anyhow?"
