# Frosh Football Team At SC
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
Before most of you had
selected your orange juice and had
helped yourself to the scrambled
eggs this morning, the 1969
Stanford freshman football team
had boarded busses for the airport
and their date with the Trojans of
use.
Coach BUI Moultrie's Papooses
concluded their final workout
yesterday with a light refresher
drill, going over their notes on the
past 14 day crash course in
winning football.
"I'm real excited about the
kids," said Coach Moultrie,
"they've done an excellent job
from a standpoint of conditioning
and learning, and I've just got to
admire their spunk. We're taking
our 32 best athletes to USC,
versatile kids who can play many
positions and play them well. The
assistant coaching staff has done a
simply remarkable job with
them."
The Papooses game plan is a
simple one: "Beat SC." "We'll be
going with a balanced attack
against the Trojans," commented

Mr. Moultrie, "we plan to do the
dictating to their defense and do
what we want to do when we
want to do it. We can't rely solely
on one weapon."
Directing the Red and White
offensive unit from the
quarterback post will be lanky
Jim Wise. He will be giving inside
to fullback Reggi Sanderson and
pitching wide to tailback Eric
Cross, and will be looking to
target split receivers Bill Scott and
Mike Boryla and tight end Bob
Berry with "big play" passes.

Up front it will be Randy
Gaynor anchoring the line at
center, with Don Mulford and
Dan Tomlinson at the guards and
with Pierre Perreault and Bill
Wiley providing the real beef at
the tackle posts.
Coach Moultrie noted that
running backs Charles McCloud
and Barr Curry and
quarterback-turned safety Steve
Murray will all see their share of
this afternnon's action as each is
"a real ball player, determined to
play football for Stanford."

"Our kids are ready,"
concluded Coach Moultrie. "We're
set to really go after'em and plan
on showing those Trojans what
the game is all about."
