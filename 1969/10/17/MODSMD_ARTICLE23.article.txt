# Poloists Vs SJS

### 
The Stanford water polo team
returns to action with a pair of
home non-league contests this
weekend. The Indians face
Foothill College Friday at 3 p.m.,
and San Jose State Saturday at 10
a.m.
Last weekend the Indians split
a pair of games, losing to
California, 7-6, and beating De

Anza, 6-4. In the Pac-8 opener
against Cal, the Indians got in
deep foul trouble as they blew a
four goal lead. But the Indians
bounced back for the victory over
De Anza on Saturday.
Coach Jim Gaughran naturally
admits that SJS will give the
Indians a stiff test, but he says
Foothill cannot be overlooked.
Although Foothill wasn't
expected to have a very good club
this year, they have started to
come around and last week they
pulled off a big upset by defeating
De Anza.
In a game during the Northern
California Tournament, the
Indians put together a fine effort
to drop the Spartans, 5-3, but
Coack Gaughran expects another
tough contest with last year's
unofficial national champions.
