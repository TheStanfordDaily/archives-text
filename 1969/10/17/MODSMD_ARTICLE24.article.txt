Many powerhouse teams were
unveiled in the first week of
competition of IM football as the
scores soared into the fifties and
sixties. Not only were there many
potent offenses, but the defenses
found that they could shut off
their oppositions â€”out of the first
26 games, 14 were shutouts.
The two top teams from last
year look tough again. The
Dislocations, last year's champion,
killed the Tonkers in their first
game, 63-0, and look like the
team to be beaten again this year.
Last year's runnerup team, the Phi
Delts, uncovered their polished
offense and defense as they
thrashed the Alpha Delts 53-6.
The KA's also showed their
power as they murdered Theta Zi
51-6, and the Delts showed they
had speed to burn as they
overpowered the Fiji's 45-0. The
well organized Second Year Law
Team crushed the Computer
Science Department 71-0, and
later the Computer Science coach
found that he had
misprogrammed the computer and
his offense and defense teams had
been switched around as a result
of a loop goof.
The Chi Psi's showed that they
could either run or pass as they
took the ATO's 33-6, and the
Zetes used their strong passing
attack to beat the Defending
Champs (the new name for the
Dekes), 26-0; Other teams that
may have potential are the Sigma
Chi's and the Theta Delts- but
neither has played so its hard to
say.
Bob Hoy made three
touchdowns as he led El Toro to a
28-6 win over Campo, and it looks
like El Toro will again be the top
team from the Eating Clubs.
The most exciting game of the
week was the First Year
Biz-Crothers Memorial game. First
Year Biz scored with two minutes
left in the game to tie the score
12-12, but Cro Mem marched
back down the field as soon as
they got the ball back. On the last
play of the game, First Year Biz
intercepted a pass on their own 20
yard line and returned it 60 yards
for the score to win 18-12. The
Kappa Sigs and Theta Chi's
showed how unpolished teams can
be at the beginning of the season
as the first four plays of the game
all resulted in interceptions.
A new rule change now permits
professional athletes to compete
in intramurals. It lets a player
participate in all sports except the
one in which he is a professional.
