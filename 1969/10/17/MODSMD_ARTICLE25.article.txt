# Cougars Tomorrow
## Tribe Must Bounce Back 
### FRED MANN 
"The spirit on the ballclub is
high. We're ready." John Ralston
spoke the words, but many
wondered whether they were true.
Will a heartbreaking defeat at
the hands of USC stay in the
minds of the Stanford football
team, like it did last year, or can
this squad overcome their
disappointment and still play
good football? The answer will
come tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. in
Stanford Stadium against
Washington State.
Last season, the Tribe
staggered to Pullman, and were
lucky to come away with a 21-21
tie. The Cougars had a 67-yard
scoring pass called back in the
fourth quarter. They were very
down after the 27-24 loss to
Southern Cal, and before they
recovered, they were tied by
WSU, gave a game to UCLA, and
were soundly clobbered by
Oregon State.
This time, the situation is
slightly different in a few ways.
For one, SC wasn't the only
traumatic loss—Purdue came just
the week before. But also this
team is not the type to give up
and quit. There is still a chance
for the Rose Bowl and the
Conference Championship, and
the Indians are after the prizes.
Rugged Cougars
One more difference
remains—this year, Washington

State is not a pushover. Even
when Cougar teams have been
fairly weak, they have been able
to ruin Stanford. WSU has won
eight of the last nine contests with
the Cards, and holds the series
edge, 14-10-1.
The visitor's season record is,
like Stanford's, deceptive. After a
19-18 upset win over Illinois, the

Cougars have dropped three in a
row. lowa wiped them out 61-35,
as did UCLA, 46-14. But their loss
to Oregon was a squeaker, 25-24.
If they could use two
quarterbacks at the same time,
they might have their record
turned around. Jack Wigmore is a
talented passer, and Chuck
Hawthorne, a great runner. The
only problem is Wigmore can't
run, and Hawthorne can't throw.
But still, WSU ranks fourth in the
league in total offense.
Flu Hits Tribe
In the Stanford camp, flu,
injuries, and rain have slowed
practice this week. Bill Alexander,
Dave Tipton, and Demea
Washington are all down with the
bug, and spent Wednesday in the
health center. Both Bubba Brown

and Jim Plunkett ended up with
shoulder pains from their efforts
at USC, and they were held out of
early week practice.
All five starters should be
ready tomorrow to lead the Tribe
back into the win column. Aside
from the 2-2 record, it has been
an outstanding year for Stanford
thus far.
Offense Ranks High
Plunkett currently ranks fourth
in the country in total offense
with 1150 yards, is eighth in
passing with 107 2 yards through
the air, and has made the Indians
the number two team in total
offense, average 512.5 yards per
game. (Houston is first with
532.5)
Jim leads the Pac-8 in nearly
everything, and is more than 100

yards ahead of his last year's pace.
And he is not the only player off
to a fine start. Don Parish has
already made 62 tackles, way
ahead of his record-setting pace of
last season. Also Pat Preston has
nailed 50 runners, and together
they form the top linebacking duo
on the coast. Parish is sure to be
an All-American selection.
If the strong spots are many,
the weaknesses are amazingly few.
One noticeable one—kick
returns—has hopefully been solved
this week. Jackie Brown and
Randy Vataha will take care of
the run backs tomorrow.
If Stanford is to make it to the
Roses at the season's end, they
can't afford any more mistakes. A
strong effort against the Cougars
is vital. UCLA comes next.
