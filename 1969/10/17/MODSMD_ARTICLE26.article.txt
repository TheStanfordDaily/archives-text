# Stickers Lose, 8-2

### 
The Stanford ice hockey team
dropped its League opener
Tuesday night as the Belmont
Oaks beat the Indians going away,
8-2, before 150 enthusiastic fans
at the Belmont rink.
The big difference was
conditioning. After an exciting
and highly proficient first period
which ended in a 1-1 tie,
Stanford's overall play became
increasingly ragged, and the Oaks,
who have been practicing and
playing together all summer, took
advantage of every opening.
On the. bright side was the
play of several individual Indians.
Dick Todd, centering one line,
impressed the crowd with his cool
playmaking and hustling
forechecking. More spectacular
was the play of the first line. Paul
Tittmann, at center, was clearly
the classiest skater on the ice. At
one point, he almost
singlehandedly killed a penalty by
a thrilling example of
old-fashioned "puck-ragging." He
also got the first goal.
Tittmann's linemates
collaborated on the prettiest goal
of the game. On a breakaway, Pat
Baldwin fired at full speed from
the blue line. His shot, wide to the
left, careened off the backboards
onto the stick of Flip Gianos.
Belmont's goalie covered the
rebound, but before he could
re-adjust, Gianos fired it back to
Baldwin, streaking in on the right,
who plunked the puck into the
now open net.
The team made the same errors
repeatedly. These deficiencies
should be correctable, and with
some added experience, the Cards
will give a better account of
themselves in the future. The next
home game is November 4 at
Belmont against the same Oaks.
