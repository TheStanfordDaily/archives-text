## Lottery Bill Approved 
### 
WASHINGTON
(AP)—President Nixon's lottery
plan to limit the draft to
19-year-olds was approved
Thursday by the House Armed
Services Committee and sent
toward the House floor for action
late next week.
This speedy action on a
surprising 31-0 vote indicated the
chances for House approval are
good and that the Senate might
take up the bill before the end of
the year.
Senate Armed Services
Chairman John C. Stennis,
D-Mass., has said his committee
may take up the President's
proposal this year if it passes the
House.
The House committee refused
even to consider eliminating draft
deferments for college students.
Such a proposal by Rep.
Richard H. Ichord, D-Mo., was
ruled out of order on a 21-10 roll
call. Ichord said "continuing the
policy of college deferments in
time of a shooting war is one of
our biggest mistakes."
The draft lottery approval was
unanimously recommended by a
special subcommittee that was
highly critical of the plan during
four days of hearings this month.
The subcommittee headed by
Rep. F. Edward Hebert, D-La.,
said in its report it is not
persuaded that Nixon's plan
"would provide any greater equity
in the selection process than is

provided by the present
old est-first system.
"However, , in view of the
strong recommendation of the
President in this regard, urging the
Congress to permit him to modify
the existing system of selection,
the subcommittee believes that
this request of the commander in
chief of our armed forces should
be honored."
Hebert indicated strong
opposition to permitting
amendments on the House floor
which he said could open up a
"Pandora's Box" for revising the
entire draft system rather than
approving the lottery only.
But committee critics said they
will carry a fight to open the bill
up to floor revision to the Rules
Committee and the floor itself if
necessary.
"This bill deals with how
people get pulled out of the hat
for the draft," said Rep. Otis G.
Pike, D-N.Y., "But it doesn't deal
in any manner with who gets put
in the hat in the first place."
Nixon's lottery plan is aimed at
giving 18-year-olds advance notice
of their prospects for being
drafted in their 19th year. The
late September or early October
lottery would set up the draft
order for the 365 birthdates for
the following year.
Men whose birthdates were
drawn first would likely be
drafted the following January.

Those whose birthdates were
drawn last would likely escape the
draft.
Students and other men with
deferments would go back into he
draft pool and be treated as
19-year-olds when their
deferments ended.
Wha it would do: Set up a
lottery, held in late September or
early October each year to
determine the draft order for the
following year's 365 birthdates.
Men whose 19th birthday falls on
the first dates drawn would know
they faced the draft in January or
February. Men whose birthdates
were drawn last would likely
escape the draft entirely.
The present system: All
able-bodied men 19 to 26 years of
age are subject to he draft on an

oldest-first basis. Since most older
men already have been drafted the
men now being called are usually
in the 20-to-21 age group.
Background: President Nixon
asked Congress Sept. 18 to repeal
the 1967 ban against a draft
lottery, saying his plan would be
the fairest and easiest way to limit
the draft to 19-year-olds.
Prognosis: Speedy scheduling
of House action late next week
indicates Nixon's proposal faces
little hard opposition there. But
its fate in the Senate remains a
question. Senate Armed Services
Committee Chairman John C.
Stennis, D-Miss., has indicated
reluctance to take up the measure
for fear Senate critics might to
revise the entire draft system with
amendments.

WASHINGTON
(AP)—President Nixon's lottery
plan to limit the draft to
19-year-olds was approved
Thursday by the House Armed
Services Committee and sent
toward the House floor for action
late next week.
This speedy action on a
surprising 31-0 vote indicated the
chances for House approval are
good and that the Senate might
take up the bill before the end of
the year.
Senate Armed Services
Chairman John C. Stennis,
D-Mass., has said his committee
may take up the President's
proposal this year if it passes the
House.
The House committee refused
even to consider eliminating draft
deferments for college students.
Such a proposal by Rep.
Richard H. Ichord, D-Mo., was
ruled out of order on a 21-10 roll
call. Ichord said "continuing the
policy of college deferments in
time of a shooting war is one of
our biggest mistakes."
The draft lottery approval was
unanimously recommended by a
special subcommittee that was
highly critical of the plan during
four days of hearings this month.
The subcommittee headed by
Rep. F. Edward Hebert, D-La.,
said in its report it is not
persuaded that Nixon's plan
"would provide any greater equity
in the selection process than is

provided by the present
old est-first system.
"However, , in view of the
strong recommendation of the
President in this regard, urging the
Congress to permit him to modify
the existing system of selection,
the subcommittee believes that
this request of the commander in
chief of our armed forces should
be honored."
Hebert indicated strong
opposition to permitting
amendments on the House floor
which he said could open up a
"Pandora's Box" for revising the
entire draft system rather than
approving the lottery only.
But committee critics said they
will carry a fight to open the bill
up to floor revision to the Rules
Committee and the floor itself if
necessary.
"This bill deals with how
people get pulled out of the hat
for the draft," said Rep. Otis G.
Pike, D-N.Y., "But it doesn't deal
in any manner with who gets put
in the hat in the first place."
Nixon's lottery plan is aimed at
giving 18-year-olds advance notice
of their prospects for being
drafted in their 19th year. The
late September or early October
lottery would set up the draft
order for the 365 birthdates for
the following year.
Men whose birthdates were
drawn first would likely be
drafted the following January.

Those whose birthdates were
drawn last would likely escape the
draft.
Students and other men with
deferments would go back into he
draft pool and be treated as
19-year-olds when their
deferments ended.
Wha it would do: Set up a
lottery, held in late September or
early October each year to
determine the draft order for the
following year's 365 birthdates.
Men whose 19th birthday falls on
the first dates drawn would know
they faced the draft in January or
February. Men whose birthdates
were drawn last would likely
escape the draft entirely.
