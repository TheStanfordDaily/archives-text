# Future Activities Cloudy
## Moratorium: Local, National Praise 
### BOB MICHELET 
Generally favorable reaction on both the national and
local level flowed yesterday in the wake of Wednesday's
Vietnam Moratorium, the largest anti-war protest in the
nation's history.
At the same time, plans were being discussed for more
extensive, and possibly more militant, action in the
following months.
More than one million persons participated in Mora
torium activities across the nation, with speeches center
ing on President Nixon and his war policies.
In Sacramento, a crowd of more than 4,000 joined in
protest at the state capital. Senator Alan Cranston and
University of California Berkeley student body president
Dan Siegel spoke at the rally.
Siegel declared that young people must "stay in the
streets until all the troops are home," while Cranston said
"it's time for us to leave. Let our people go!"
I'itzer Gives Praise
Stanford President Kenneth Pitzer Thursday congratu
lated local Moratorium leaders, saying the activities were
"very well handled," and termed the crowd of 8,000 at
Wednesday evening rallies as "impressive."
He said he would give a November Moratorium his
support if it continued the same actions, but cautioned
that if more radical actions were taken, the movement
could destroy its own effectiveness.
Provost Richard Lyman also termed the Moratorium
"impressive" and said Nixon should be impressed by the
movement.
He said he was interested in "useful protest and
constructive action," but added, in reference to the
Moratorium's call for class boycotts, that class attendance
was secondary to political action.
Kramer Elated
John Kramer, student coordinator for the Moratorium,
was "elated" at Wednesday's activities, noting the turnout
was better than expected.

He said a decision on November Moratorium actions
would be delayed until a general meeting next week.
Kramer also revealed that a weekly newspaper will be
started by the Moratorium committee next week.
Kramer noted that a split is developing in San
Francisco and Berkeley (as well as in much of the nation)
between liberals and radicals in the movement as to what
actions should be taken. He said, however, that the war is
"a big enough issue to bring liberals and radicals to
gether."
Throughout the day, speeches urged President Nixon
to heed the call of the Moratorium for troop witndrawal.
W. Averell Harriman, former chief U.S. negotiator in
Paris, told as East Meadow, N.Y. crowd, "President Nixon
said he wouldn't pay attention to your voices. Now he's
going to have to pay attention."
More Action Possible
And Sam Brown, national Moratorium coordinator,
said "if there is no change in Vietnam policy, if the
President doesn't respond, there will be a second Mora
torium."
The effects of the more than one million persons who
joined in the Moratorium was even being felt on Capitol
Hill. There, Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott (R-Pa.)
who earlier had called for a 60-day Moratorium on war
criticism, said the Moratorium was "in the tradition of
American dissent."
" 1 he President is as aware as any of us of the concern.
The President said several days ago he hoped the war
would be over in three years and he hopes it will be over
before that. Hanoi ought to hear the voices of both
sides—the hawks and the doves."
The White House, however, was not as optimistic as
Sen. Scott concerning Nixon's reaction.
Nixon Unaffected
A spokesman said "1 don't think the President can be
affected by a mass demonstration of any kind." The
White House said that telegrams received Wednesday
supported Nixon's policies by a margin of more than \ to
1.

Herbert Klein, Nixon's director of communications,
added "it's also true and clear to the President that a vast
majority of the American people are supporting his
policy."
In San Diego, Dr. Herbert Marcuse, philosophical
favorite of the New Left, said the Moratorium "was
tremendous, and it's going to escalate. Nixon had better
pay attention."
The concept of "escalating" Moratorium activities was
also expressed by Dave Jones, a member of the local
coordinating committee.
He noted that in November two days of activity will
have to be coordinated, and that these activities "can't be
just knocking on doors."
Activities Cited
Jones cited the possibility of establishing community
education centers in the near future as part of these
expanded activities. Local, war-related industry is another
possible target.
The scope of further national activity is also being
expanded. Adam Walinsky, coordinator of the massive
New York turnout, said if the President responds to
Moratorium demands for a complete pullout of U.S.
troops, "we will assist him in any steps he takes."
"If he does not respond," he added, "then it is clear
that people are already planning further efforts. They will
be left with a choice between apathy on he one hand and
another sort of political action, on he other, perhaps more
violent."
Prospects Dim
The prospects for an immediate troop withdrawal are
extremely dim, though Defense Secretary Melvin Laird
said Thursday the U.S. is planning to keep a "residual
force" of several thousand men as trainers and advisors in
Vietnam after the end of all fighting.
His statement, combined with Nixon's reluctance to
comment on the Moratorium's demands, appear to mean
that the U.S. intends to be in Vietnam far beyond Nov.
15, the date for the second round of Moratorium activity.

extensive, and possibly more militant, action in the
following months.
More than one million persons participated in Mora
torium activities across the nation, with speeches center
ing on President Nixon and his war policies.
In Sacramento, a crowd of more than 4,000 joined in
protest at the state capital. Senator Alan Cranston and
University of California Berkeley student body president
Dan Siegel spoke at the rally.
Siegel declared that young people must "stay in the
streets until all the troops are home," while Cranston said
"it's time for us to leave. Let our people go!"
I'itzer Gives Praise
Stanford President Kenneth Pitzer Thursday congratu
lated local Moratorium leaders, saying the activities were
"very well handled," and termed the crowd of 8,000 at
Wednesday evening rallies as "impressive."
He said he would give a November Moratorium his
support if it continued the same actions, but cautioned
that if more radical actions were taken, the movement
could destroy its own effectiveness.
Provost Richard Lyman also termed the Moratorium
"impressive" and said Nixon should be impressed by the
movement.
He said he was interested in "useful protest and
constructive action," but added, in reference to the
Moratorium's call for class boycotts, that class attendance
was secondary to political action.
Kramer Elated
John Kramer, student coordinator for the Moratorium,
was "elated" at Wednesday's activities, noting the turnout
was better than expected.

He said a decision on November Moratorium actions
would be delayed until a general meeting next week.
Kramer also revealed that a weekly newspaper will be
started by the Moratorium committee next week.
Kramer noted that a split is developing in San
Francisco and Berkeley (as well as in much of the nation)
between liberals and radicals in the movement as to what
actions should be taken. He said, however, that the war is
"a big enough issue to bring liberals and radicals to
gether."
Throughout the day, speeches urged President Nixon
to heed the call of the Moratorium for troop witndrawal.
W. Averell Harriman, former chief U.S. negotiator in
Paris, told as East Meadow, N.Y. crowd, "President Nixon
said he wouldn't pay attention to your voices. Now he's
going to have to pay attention."
More Action Possible
And Sam Brown, national Moratorium coordinator,
said "if there is no change in Vietnam policy, if the
President doesn't respond, there will be a second Mora
torium."
The effects of the more than one million persons who
joined in the Moratorium was even being felt on Capitol
Hill. There, Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott (R-Pa.)
who earlier had called for a 60-day Moratorium on war
criticism, said the Moratorium was "in the tradition of
American dissent."
" 1 he President is as aware as any of us of the concern.
The President said several days ago he hoped the war
would be over in three years and he hopes it will be over
before that. Hanoi ought to hear the voices of both
sides—the hawks and the doves."
The White House, however, was not as optimistic as
Sen. Scott concerning Nixon's reaction.
Nixon Unaffected
A spokesman said "1 don't think the President can be
affected by a mass demonstration of any kind." The
White House said that telegrams received Wednesday
supported Nixon's policies by a margin of more than \ to
1.

Herbert Klein, Nixon's director of communications,
added "it's also true and clear to the President that a vast
majority of the American people are supporting his
policy."
In San Diego, Dr. Herbert Marcuse, philosophical
favorite of the New Left, said the Moratorium "was
tremendous, and it's going to escalate. Nixon had better
pay attention."
The concept of "escalating" Moratorium activities was
also expressed by Dave Jones, a member of the local
coordinating committee.
He noted that in November two days of activity will
have to be coordinated, and that these activities "can't be
just knocking on doors."
Activities Cited
Jones cited the possibility of establishing community
education centers in the near future as part of these
expanded activities. Local, war-related industry is another
possible target.
The scope of further national activity is also being
expanded. Adam Walinsky, coordinator of the massive
New York turnout, said if the President responds to
Moratorium demands for a complete pullout of U.S.
troops, "we will assist him in any steps he takes."
"If he does not respond," he added, "then it is clear
that people are already planning further efforts. They will
be left with a choice between apathy on he one hand and
another sort of political action, on he other, perhaps more
violent."
Prospects Dim
The prospects for an immediate troop withdrawal are
extremely dim, though Defense Secretary Melvin Laird
said Thursday the U.S. is planning to keep a "residual
force" of several thousand men as trainers and advisors in
Vietnam after the end of all fighting.
His statement, combined with Nixon's reluctance to
comment on the Moratorium's demands, appear to mean
that the U.S. intends to be in Vietnam far beyond Nov.
15, the date for the second round of Moratorium activity.
Generally favorable reaction on both the national and
local level flowed yesterday in the wake of Wednesday's
Vietnam Moratorium, the largest anti-war protest in the
nation's history.

protest at the state capital. Senator Alan Cranston and
University of California Berkeley student body president
Dan Siegel spoke at the rally.
Siegel declared that young people must "stay in the
streets until all the troops are home," while Cranston said
"it's time for us to leave. Let our people go!"
I'itzer Gives Praise
Stanford President Kenneth Pitzer Thursday congratu
lated local Moratorium leaders, saying the activities were
"very well handled," and termed the crowd of 8,000 at
Wednesday evening rallies as "impressive."
He said he would give a November Moratorium his
support if it continued the same actions, but cautioned
that if more radical actions were taken, the movement
could destroy its own effectiveness.
Provost Richard Lyman also termed the Moratorium
"impressive" and said Nixon should be impressed by the
movement.
He said he was interested in "useful protest and
constructive action," but added, in reference to the
Moratorium's call for class boycotts, that class attendance
was secondary to political action.
Kramer Elated
John Kramer, student coordinator for the Moratorium,
was "elated" at Wednesday's activities, noting the turnout
was better than expected.

He said a decision on November Moratorium actions
would be delayed until a general meeting next week.
Kramer also revealed that a weekly newspaper will be
started by the Moratorium committee next week.
Kramer noted that a split is developing in San
Francisco and Berkeley (as well as in much of the nation)
between liberals and radicals in the movement as to what
actions should be taken. He said, however, that the war is
"a big enough issue to bring liberals and radicals to
gether."
Throughout the day, speeches urged President Nixon
to heed the call of the Moratorium for troop witndrawal.
W. Averell Harriman, former chief U.S. negotiator in
Paris, told as East Meadow, N.Y. crowd, "President Nixon
said he wouldn't pay attention to your voices. Now he's
going to have to pay attention."
More Action Possible
And Sam Brown, national Moratorium coordinator,
said "if there is no change in Vietnam policy, if the
President doesn't respond, there will be a second Mora
torium."
The effects of the more than one million persons who
joined in the Moratorium was even being felt on Capitol
Hill. There, Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott (R-Pa.)
who earlier had called for a 60-day Moratorium on war
criticism, said the Moratorium was "in the tradition of
American dissent."
" 1 he President is as aware as any of us of the concern.
The President said several days ago he hoped the war
would be over in three years and he hopes it will be over
before that. Hanoi ought to hear the voices of both
sides—the hawks and the doves."
The White House, however, was not as optimistic as
Sen. Scott concerning Nixon's reaction.
Nixon Unaffected
A spokesman said "1 don't think the President can be
affected by a mass demonstration of any kind." The
White House said that telegrams received Wednesday
supported Nixon's policies by a margin of more than \ to
1.

Herbert Klein, Nixon's director of communications,
added "it's also true and clear to the President that a vast
majority of the American people are supporting his
policy."
In San Diego, Dr. Herbert Marcuse, philosophical
favorite of the New Left, said the Moratorium "was
tremendous, and it's going to escalate. Nixon had better
pay attention."
The concept of "escalating" Moratorium activities was
also expressed by Dave Jones, a member of the local
coordinating committee.
He noted that in November two days of activity will
have to be coordinated, and that these activities "can't be
just knocking on doors."
Activities Cited
Jones cited the possibility of establishing community
education centers in the near future as part of these
expanded activities. Local, war-related industry is another
possible target.
The scope of further national activity is also being
expanded. Adam Walinsky, coordinator of the massive
New York turnout, said if the President responds to
Moratorium demands for a complete pullout of U.S.
troops, "we will assist him in any steps he takes."
"If he does not respond," he added, "then it is clear
that people are already planning further efforts. They will
be left with a choice between apathy on he one hand and
another sort of political action, on he other, perhaps more
violent."
Prospects Dim
The prospects for an immediate troop withdrawal are
extremely dim, though Defense Secretary Melvin Laird
said Thursday the U.S. is planning to keep a "residual
force" of several thousand men as trainers and advisors in
Vietnam after the end of all fighting.
His statement, combined with Nixon's reluctance to
comment on the Moratorium's demands, appear to mean
that the U.S. intends to be in Vietnam far beyond Nov.
15, the date for the second round of Moratorium activity.
Generally favorable reaction on both the national and
local level flowed yesterday in the wake of Wednesday's
Vietnam Moratorium, the largest anti-war protest in the
nation's history.
At the same time, plans were being discussed for more
extensive, and possibly more militant, action in the
following months.
More than one million persons participated in Mora
torium activities across the nation, with speeches center
ing on President Nixon and his war policies.
