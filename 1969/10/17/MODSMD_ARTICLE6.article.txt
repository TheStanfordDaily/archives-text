# Faculty Senate Makes Changes
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
With characteristic deliberate
speed, the faculty senate
yesterday approved charges to
reorganize Academic Council
committees on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aids,
and on Graduate Studies.
Dissolving into a committee of
the whole, senators discussed
recommendations for several
University-wide committees which
President Kenneth Pitzer will
establish.
Pitzer announced to the senate
that seven professors have been
named to Board of Trustees
committees. Two professors will
join committees on Academic
Affairs, Finance, and Planning and
Development; one was named to
the Investment Committee.
Nominations for students and
additional faculty members to
serve on trustee committees will
be presented to the board later.
In approving directives to two
Academic Council committees,
the senate continued the extensive
task of streamlining University
committee structure.
One Com in i t tee
Two existing committees, on
undergraduate student aid and
admissions, will be replaced by
the Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aids Committee.
Three students will serve among
the nine voting members.
In determining policies and
supervising their execution, the
committee will implement any
suggestions adopted from the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) report on admissions and
financial aid.
The newly formed Graduate
Studies Committee will supervise
graduate admission policies and
hold authority to approve
interdisciplinary graduate
programs.
Re-evaluation
It is charged with immediately
examining the entire structure of
graduate studies, including the

relationship between the Graduate
Dean's office, the committee, and
the graduate departments.
Graduate students will fill
three of eleven voting positions on
the committee.
For nearly two hours, the
senate sat as a committee of the
whole examining recommenda
tions on University committees,
which treat problems of primary
interest to administrators,
students and faculty.
Suggestions
Under senate regulations,
committee of the whole
proceedings may not be fully
reported. Discussion focused on
charges drawn up by the senate
Committee on Committees and
designed as suggestions for Pitzer
in establishing the new structure.
Areas discussed include
education and employment of
women in the University, business
and financial operations, student
services, athletics, and faculty and
staff affairs.
Faculty Appointed
Faculty appointments to
trustee committees came on the
heels of recommendations last
month by a trustee committee
headed by John Gardner.
Mark Mancall, history associate
professor and chairman of the
Academic Council's Undergradu
ate Studies Committee, and lan B.
Watt, chairman of the English
Department, will join the trustee
Academic Affairs Committee.
New finance committee
members are G.L. Bach, econ
omics and graduate business
school professor, and William
Miller, computer science professor
and associate provost.
Ezra Solomon from the gradu
ate business school will serve on
the Investment Committee. Law
professor Thomas Ehrlich and
Nobel Laureate Joshua Lederberg,
chairman of the Genetics Depart
ment, will join the Planning and
Development Committee.
