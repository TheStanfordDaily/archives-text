NEW YORK (AP)—The N.w
York Mets, laughed at for seven
longs years as one of the worst
teams in baseball history, were
toasted Thursday as baseball's
best after winning the 1969 World
Series with a 5-3 victory over the
Baltimore Orioles.
The Mets thus completed on
the the most amazing success
stories in sports by sweeping four
straight games from the
bewildered American League
champion Orioles after losing the
first game of the best-of-seven
series.
A 100-1 shot just to win the
National Leage pennant after
never finishing higher than ninth
place in their first seven years of
existence, the Mets captured that
flag by overcoming a 9V2 game
Chicago Cubs lead for the Eastern
Division title, and then won the
pennant with three straight
playoff victories over Atlanta.

Still the underdog to he
powerful Orioles the young Mets
finally made believers of everyone
when Ron Swoboda blasted a
double down the left field line,
breaking a 3-3 deadlock in the
eighth inning Thursday. Another
run scored on an error.
Jerry Koosman, who beat
McNally in the second game,
hurled a five-hitter for the victory
that touched off a wild
celebration on the field, in the
clubhouse and throughout the
streets of New York.
An improvised plastic banner
hoisted on the flag pole in
centerfield told the story:
"We went all the way, baby!"
Like a firecracker that had spewed
for years—in periods of futility,
frustration and ridicule—the New
York Mets' World Series victory
erupted into a massive explosion
Thursday.
Fans went berserk.
