The Aerospace Group of Hughes Aircraft Company is seek
ing several top MBA candidates who are interested in the
aerospace or the electronics industry.
We envision an initial program of familiarization with the
Group's principal functional activities. The program will
include working assignments in systems engineering, proj
ect administration and control, marketing, contract admin
istration, finance and manufacturing. These assignments
will not only be a significant learning opportunity while
providing the individuals with responsible working expe
rience in each area, but individuals are also expected to
make a significant improvement before taking another
assignment. In addition, individuals will have opportunities
during each assignment to undertake special staff studies
of significant importance to management, ranging from
market research studies and analyses of program control
systems to strategy formulation and implementation. The
length of the total program, the time spent in each assign
ment, and the choice of assignments will be tailored to
each individual's previous experience and career develop
ment objectives.
Following the initial program, opportunities will be avail
able in the Group and throughout the Company for the
assumption of significant management responsibilities
either in general project management or in a specialized
functional area such as marketing, finance or contract ad
ministration.
