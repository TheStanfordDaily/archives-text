FAMILIAR EQUATION?
â– t.
It describes the dynamics of a linear system.
We use such equations in solving problems in inertial guidance for ships, aircraft,
and submarines. The work involves analytical research relating to gimballed and
strapdown inertial systems & sensors including: mathematical modeling of phys
ical processes, inertial system error analysis, system synthesis, optimization and
evaluation in the area of Navagation, Guidance and Control.
We'll be an Campus Wednesday, Oct. 22nd talking to MS A Doctoral graduates
in EE, Aero/Astro or Systems who are familiar with automatic control systems
and random process theory.
The positions are located 8 miles from Boston & Cambridge and offer excellent
salaries, benefits and paid relocation.
If you're'interested in joining a small fast-moving research firm and enjoy
professional recognition of your work, plan to see us on October 22nd
