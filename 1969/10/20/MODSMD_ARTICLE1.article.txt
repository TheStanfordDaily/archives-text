# Galbraith Sees Latin Uprising
## 
### BOB MICHELET 
Harvard economist John
Galbraith predicted Friday night
un inevitable, and possibly violent,
revolution in Latin America. His
remarks opened the two-day
conference on "Technology and
the Third World."
Delivering the keynote address
in Memorial Auditorium,
Galbraith said he was not
persuaded that the differences
between the capitalistic nations
and others are not as great as the
term "Third World" implies.
Conceeding that imperfect
classifications are better than
none, he divided Third World
nations into three categoriesâ€”the
Sub-Shara (Africa), Latin America
and South Asia.
He cited problems of
education, social structure and
overpopulation, respectively, as
the major factors inhibiting
economic growth in these
countries.
Population Control
Galbraith dealt briefly with
solutions for the African and
Asian countries, but devoted most
attention to the problems of Latin
America. He did, however, stress
the urgent need for population
control in Asian nations.
The former U.S. ambassador to
India said the problem in South
America is to "disestablish the
non-functional groups who rule in
their own interest."
Revolution, he added, cannot
change the underlying economic
obstacles in Asian or African
countries. But in Latin America,
he said, revolution was progressive
and does remove these obstacles.
Early or Late Revolution
"The choice in Latin America
is not between revolution and
peaceful change," he claimed, "It
is between early and later
revolution. An early revolution
could be mild and comparatively
peaceful. A late one could be
violent."
Galbraith tenned the military
aid the U.S. has given some Latin
American countries "regressive,"
and said that when the inevitable
explosion comes, some of those
involved will have been armed by
the United States.
He added he hoped that by the
time the revolution comes in
Brazil, the U.S. will have learned
enough from Vietnam that it
"won't hear about it for several
years."
Criticizes Nixon
In a news conference at the
San Francisco Airport earlier
Friday, Galbraith predicted that
President Nixon's proposals to
curb inflation won't work.
He said Nixon "has done more
to make inflation worse than
remedy it" in disavowing any
future resort to wage and price
guidelines this year.
"Large troop withdrawals from
Vietnam would take some
pressure off" the inflationary
spiral, but the only alternative is
" unacceptably large
unemployment."
Galbraith said that last
Wednesday's Vietnam Moratorium
"certainly affected" the President,
and noted, "Nixon seems
determined to take the curse of
the war party off the Democrats
and put it on the Republicans."

Saturday morning, about 150
students listened to a taped
speech by Marxist economist
Ernest Mandel of Belgium. Mandel
was denied a visa by the State
Department to participate in the
conference, a move Galbraith
criticized as "silly, stupid,
irrational and bad politics."
Mandel blamed capitalist
nations for the present Third
World problems and accused them
of manipulating money and
distribution to maintain economic
and industrial superiority.
In a brief, trans-Atlantic
telephone debate, Galbraith asked
Mandel whether overpopulation
and similar national problems
were not factors in
underdevelopment, a point he
made in his Friday speech. /
Galbraith charged that in
India's case, the people have
tended to spend more energy
criticizing British colonial policy
than on solving their present
economic problems.
