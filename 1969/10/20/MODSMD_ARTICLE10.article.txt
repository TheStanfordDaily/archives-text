Financially, the Peninsula
October 15 Moratorium
committee nearly broke even.
Leaders approxn .at,. total
contributions at $6179, .gainst
total costs of $6460.
Contributions and sale of
bumper strips and pins during the
Action Forum rally last
Wednesday night accounted for
$4500 in receipts. In addition to
an estimated $1200 in sales at the
Moratorium booth, $479 were
received in letters responding to
last Wednesday's canvassing.
The largest cost of the
Moratorium was $1881 for
printing. The rally cost
approximately $1700, while
advertising in the Palo Alto Times
cost $665 and $391 in the Daily.
Bumper stickers added cos's of
$1121. And the ever-present arm
bands required $200.
The committee received other
bills for mailing, ASSU services,
and other activities conducted in
Palo Alto.
Positive Response
Mrs. Rachelle Marshall,
treasurer of the Peninsula
Vietnam Moratorium committee,
who made these estimates,
commented on the positive nature
of responses to the Moratorium
canvass. Of 93 letters received
Friday and Saturday, nearly all
contained checks, with 52 of the
writers offering to help and only
three negative letters.
She said that this kind of
response "clearly shows that
Stanford University students
made a great impression during
the canvass."
One letter stated, "enclosed is
my modest contribution. I've
written to both Senator Cranston,
for whom we voted, and Senator
Murphy . . .
"As a former citizen of France
and a long time resident of the
Far East, I stress the fact that we
are not fighting for the people of
unfortunate Vietnam, but for a
group of disreputable,

facist-minded, dishonest
politicians.
"And we are ruining not only
the bright image of the United
States in the eyes of the world,
but bringing the American way of
life crashing down in the process,"
the letter concluded.
A woman in Redwood City
offered her help and her
husband's. Her husband is
disabled but was willing to do
work at his home. Many other
letters contained wishes of thanks,
congratulations, and good luck.
Negative Reply
The negative letters did not
comment on the Moratorium
specifically.
One, headed "Dear Cowards"
in red felt marker seemed to be
concerned with business aspects
of the war, stating also his
approval of President Nixon's
policies.
One paragraph read "LBJ had a
25 billion deficit in 1968!
NIXON—a current $4 billion
surplus—a difference of $25+54
billion = $29 billion."
It ended "You are not even
aware that John L. Lewis paid F.
D. Roosevelt $5,000,000 for the
labor law—the "Wagner
Act"—why don't you learn?" Mrs.
Marshall said she did not
understand that last part at all.
Another Palo Alto woman
wrote:
"My husband and I are pleased
with the way the Moratorium
went. My husband is a commuter
and he was visibly impressed with
the way the Stanford students
conducted themselves at the train.
Thank you for the October 15
Peace Bulletin."
Mrs. Margaret Stein, a
representative of the Women's
International League for Peace
and Freedom, helped to arrange
for the location of homes as
headquarters for canvassers. She
told Mrs. Marshall that she had
had several phone calls afterwards,
thanking her for sending the
students.

Mrs. Margaret Stein, a

International League for Peace

for the location of homes as

told Mrs. Marshall that she had

Financially, the Peninsula
October 15 Moratorium
committee nearly broke even.
Leaders approxn .at,. total
contributions at $6179, .gainst
total costs of $6460.
Contributions and sale of
bumper strips and pins during the
Action Forum rally last
Wednesday night accounted for
$4500 in receipts. In addition to
an estimated $1200 in sales at the
Moratorium booth, $479 were
received in letters responding to
last Wednesday's canvassing.
The largest cost of the
Moratorium was $1881 for
printing. The rally cost
approximately $1700, while
advertising in the Palo Alto Times
cost $665 and $391 in the Daily.
Bumper stickers added cos's of
$1121. And the ever-present arm
bands required $200.
The committee received other
bills for mailing, ASSU services,
and other activities conducted in
Palo Alto.
Positive Response
Mrs. Rachelle Marshall,
treasurer of the Peninsula
Vietnam Moratorium committee,
who made these estimates,
commented on the positive nature
of responses to the Moratorium
canvass. Of 93 letters received
Friday and Saturday, nearly all
contained checks, with 52 of the
writers offering to help and only
three negative letters.
She said that this kind of
response "clearly shows that
Stanford University students
made a great impression during
the canvass."
One letter stated, "enclosed is
my modest contribution. I've
written to both Senator Cranston,
for whom we voted, and Senator
Murphy . . .
"As a former citizen of France
and a long time resident of the
Far East, I stress the fact that we
are not fighting for the people of
unfortunate Vietnam, but for a
group of disreputable,

facist-minded, dishonest
politicians.
"And we are ruining not only
the bright image of the United
States in the eyes of the world,
but bringing the American way of
life crashing down in the process,"
the letter concluded.
