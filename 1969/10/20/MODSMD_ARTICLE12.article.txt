# Letters
## Equal Time? 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Friday morning a candidate for
the ASSU Senate informed me
that her letter to the Daily had
not been printed because she was
a candidate. This seemed
consistent with the Daily's
"Election Policy" printed in that
morning's edition. It read, "The
Daily has refrained from
printing any columns or letters
written by students running for
seats on the Senate to avoid any
challenges of editorial bias or
violations of equal time."
This simply is not true. On
Tuesday, the Daily gave publicity
to one candidate by printing his
signed column entitled, "Oct. 15:
Pandora's Box?" Furthermore, on
Thursday, the Daily printed a
letter concerning tbe elections,
entitled, "The Real Issue: Student
Power," and signed by two
candidates.
This "violation of equal time"
could result in charges being
brought against the Daily as well
as the invalidation of the
elections.

(THE DAILY regrets its error
in printing Ihe column by Jim
Schnicder and the letter to the
ditor from Ben Burch anil David
Mannheim it during the week of
the election. Both columns were
overlooked by our page editor
when he wrote the "Election
Policy " statement last Thursday.
Oil Thursday, many letters and
columns were submitted, and the
opinions page editor then
formulated the incorrect election
policy statement.—Ed.)

Editor, THE DAILY:
# Changing only one letter or
K>ne number can completely alter
.the significance of a word or
phrase. The United Stanford
Employees (USE) has become
well aware of this in their drive
for a $450/ month minimum wage
for all Stanford employees.
We recognize and excuse the
machine error which caused our
►statement concerning the $400
minimum wage, approved recently
by thp Board of Trustees, to be
completely misconstrued. The
'not' in Friday's Daily should be
replaced to give: "Our position is
that the University should now
commit itself to establish a
minimum pay level of $450
monthly for salaried employees,
$2.70 an hour for hourly
employees, and comparable pay
or part-time workers."
But we cannot similarly excuse
the Board of Trustees' error.
$400/ month is not $450/inonth.
While $400 can make life more
tolerable than $350, since it is still
insufficient to properly feed,
clothe, and house a family, it is
still not a decent minimal wage.
$450 ,r taken to be a minimal
value.
Furthermore, while we are
happy to see that the
administration plans to "update
and complete university-wide job
classifications and appropriate
rate ranges," it still does not
appear that these are to be made
public. We realize that when these
are published and employees learn
of the discrepancy between
wage-classication guidelines and
pay check reality, Stanford might
have to dig into its coffers tc
eliminate the gap.
But the Stanford business
corporation, which surely can not
be as poor as it would have us
believe, should realign its
priorities so that no human being
who works on campus, who
performs those necessary
day-to-day tasks that keep this
fine institution running, earns less
than what is minimal for a decent
life. And none of these workers
should earn less than what their
(unpublished) job classification
acknowledges their services to be
worth.
Copies of a petition supporting
Ihese aims will continue to be
circulated by USE, and ?an be
obtained from Caroline lender

Editor, THE DAILY:
After reading Presidential Press
Secretary Ronald Ziegler's
astonishing claim that only 1300
telegrams arrived at the White
House on Vietnam Moratorium
Day, and that they ran 4 to 1 in
favor of present policies, I suggest
that every other sender like
myself who finds himself in so
select a minority should send a
follow-up telegram such as:
"PRESIDENT NIXON, THE
WHITE HOUSE,
WASHINGTON:
CONSIDERING YOUR
CLAIM THAT UNDER 300
ANTIWAR TELEGRAMS
ARRIVED MORATORIUM
DAY, SENDERS
ANTICIPATE PERSONAL
REPLIES."
Such a Political opinion message
of 15 words may be sent via
Western Union for only $1.00.
