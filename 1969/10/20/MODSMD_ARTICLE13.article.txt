## 'A Rascist in Palo Alto' 
### Arturo Barrera 
On September 2, 1969 a 17
year-old Chicano youth was tried
in Gilory for having committed
incest with his 15 year-old sister
The presiding juvenile court judge,
Gerald Chargin, apparently
expressed the views of many
Americans in his treatment of the
case.
Immediately after the contents
of the court transcript became
available to the public, popular
sentiment in the Santa Clara
Judicial District effected the
judge's reassignment to Palo Alto.
Chargin, who headed the local
Democratic Party in Santa Clara
for three years before his
appointment to the bench in
1959, now finds himself in a
personal predicament.

On Tuesday October 7, both
the Santa Clara Board of
Superintendents and the San Jose
City Council called for an
immediate investigation of
Chargin. The San Jose City
Council voted unanimously to
censure Chargin.
Formal Complaint
Moreover, a formal complaint
has been filed to the State
Commission on Judicial
Qualifications by the California
Rural Legal Assistance agency in
Gilroy. Most recently, the leaders
of the Santa Clara Democratic
Party are seeking his ouster.
For the past three days pickets
have greeted the judge at the Palo
Alto Court House. Signs reading
"A RACIST IN GILORY IS A

RACIST IN PALO ALTO"; "I
AM A MAN, NOT AN ANIMAL!"
"VIVA LA RAZA!" and others
have been constant reminders of
the feelings of Chicanos here at
Stanford and around the Palo
Alto community.
Incredible Remarks
So incredible were Judge
Chargin's remarks that we
Chicanos at Stanford have asked
that the official court transcript
be reprinted in the Stanford
Daily.
We hope that you will sign our
petitions for Chargin's removal
for, to paraphrase a common
saying: JUSTICE: LIVE IT OR
LEAVE IT!

The following is the entire text of the transcript
of the Sept. 2 hearing in Juvenile Court before
Judge Gerald Chargin.
Only the names of the 17 year old youth and
his family are omitted. The youth was represented
by Fred Lucero, deputy public defender.
Several organizations and government bodies
have called for an investigation. Tonight the Palo
Alto City Council will consider a resolution
condemning the actions of the judge and asking
for his removal.
THE COURT: There is some indication that
you more or less didn't think that it was against
the law or was improper. Haven't you had any
moral training? Have you and your family gone to
church?
THE MINOR: Yes sir.
THE COURT: Don't you know that things like
this are terribly wrong? This is one of the worst
crimes that a person can commit. I just get so
disgusted that I just figure what is the use. You are
just an animal. You are lower than an animal. Even
animals don't do that. You are pretty low.
I don't know why your parents haven't been
able to teach you anything or train you. Mexican
people, after 13 years of age it's perfectly all right
to go out and act like an animal. It's not even right
to do that to a stranger, let alone a member of
your own family. I don't have much hope for you.
You will probably end up in State's Prison before
you are 25, and that's where you belong, any how.
There is nothing much you can do.
I think you haven't got any moral principles.
You won't acquire anything. Your parents won't
teach you what is right or wrong and won't watch
out.
Apparently your sister is pregnant; is that right?
THE MINOR'S FATHER: Yes.
THE COURT: It's a fine situation. How old is
she?
THE MINOR'S MOTHER: Fifteen.
THE COURT: Well, probably she will have a
half a dozen children and three or four marriages
before she is 18.
The County will have to take care of you. You
are no particular good to anybody. We ought to
send you out of the country—send you back to
Mexico. You belong in prison for the rest of your
life for doing things of this kind. You ought to

commit suicide. That's what I think of people of
this kind. You are lower than animals and haven't
the right to live in organized society—just
miserable, lousy, rotten people.
There is nothing we can do with you. You
expect the county to take care of you. Maybe
Hitler was right. The animals in our society
probably ought to be destroyed because they have
no right to live among human beings. If you refuse
to act like a human being, then, you don't belong
among the society of human beings.
MR. LUCERO: Your Honor, I don't think I can
sit here are listen to that sort of thing.
THE COURT: You are going to have to listen
to it because I consider this a very vulgar, rotten
human being.
MR. LUCERO: The Court is indicting the
whole Mexican group.
THE COURT: When they are 10 or 12 years of
age, going out and having intercourse with
anybody without any moral training—they don't
even understand the Ten Commandments. That's
all. Apparently, they don't want to.
So if you want to act like that, the county has a
system of taking care of them. They don't care
about that. They have no personal self-respect.
MR. LUCERO: The Court ought to look at this
youngster and deal with this youngster's case.
THE COURT: All right. That's what I am going
to do. The family should be able to control this
boy and the young girl.
MR. LUCERO: What appalls me is that the
court is saying that Hitler was right in genocide.
THE COURT: What are we going to do with
the mad dogs of our society? Either we have to kill
them or send them to an institution or place them
out of the hands of good people because that's the
theory—one of the theories of punishment is if
they get to the position that they want to act like
mad dogs, then, we have to separate them from
our society.
Well, I will go along with the recommendation.
You will learn in time or else you will have to pay
for the penalty with the law because the law grinds
slowly but exceedingly well. If you are going to be
a law violator—you have to make up your mind
whether you are going to observe the law or not. If
you can't observe the law, then, you have to be
put away.

out of the hands of good people because that's the
theory—one of the theories of punishment is if
they get to the position that they want to act like
mad dogs, then, we have to separate them from
our society.
Well, I will go along with the recommendation.
You will learn in time or else you will have to pay
for the penalty with the law because the law grinds
slowly but exceedingly well. If you are going to be
a law violator—you have to make up your mind
whether you are going to observe the law or not. If
you can't observe the law, then, you have to be
put away.
On September 2, 1969 a 17
year-old Chicano youth was tried
in Gilory for having committed
incest with his 15 year-old sister
The presiding juvenile court judge,
Gerald Chargin, apparently
expressed the views of many
Americans in his treatment of the
case.
Immediately after the contents
of the court transcript became
available to the public, popular
sentiment in the Santa Clara
Judicial District effected the
judge's reassignment to Palo Alto.
Chargin, who headed the local
Democratic Party in Santa Clara
for three years before his
appointment to the bench in
1959, now finds himself in a
personal predicament.

On Tuesday October 7, both
the Santa Clara Board of
Superintendents and the San Jose
City Council called for an
immediate investigation of
Chargin. The San Jose City
Council voted unanimously to
censure Chargin.
Formal Complaint
Moreover, a formal complaint
has been filed to the State
Commission on Judicial
Qualifications by the California
Rural Legal Assistance agency in
Gilroy. Most recently, the leaders
of the Santa Clara Democratic
Party are seeking his ouster.
For the past three days pickets
have greeted the judge at the Palo
Alto Court House. Signs reading
"A RACIST IN GILORY IS A

RACIST IN PALO ALTO"; "I
AM A MAN, NOT AN ANIMAL!"
"VIVA LA RAZA!" and others
have been constant reminders of
the feelings of Chicanos here at
Stanford and around the Palo
Alto community.
Incredible Remarks
So incredible were Judge
Chargin's remarks that we
Chicanos at Stanford have asked
that the official court transcript
be reprinted in the Stanford
Daily.
We hope that you will sign our
petitions for Chargin's removal
for, to paraphrase a common
saying: JUSTICE: LIVE IT OR
LEAVE IT!

The following is the entire text of the transcript
of the Sept. 2 hearing in Juvenile Court before
Judge Gerald Chargin.
Only the names of the 17 year old youth and
his family are omitted. The youth was represented
by Fred Lucero, deputy public defender.
Several organizations and government bodies
have called for an investigation. Tonight the Palo
Alto City Council will consider a resolution
condemning the actions of the judge and asking
for his removal.
THE COURT: There is some indication that
you more or less didn't think that it was against
the law or was improper. Haven't you had any
moral training? Have you and your family gone to
church?
THE MINOR: Yes sir.
THE COURT: Don't you know that things like
this are terribly wrong? This is one of the worst
crimes that a person can commit. I just get so
disgusted that I just figure what is the use. You are
just an animal. You are lower than an animal. Even
animals don't do that. You are pretty low.
I don't know why your parents haven't been
able to teach you anything or train you. Mexican
people, after 13 years of age it's perfectly all right
to go out and act like an animal. It's not even right
to do that to a stranger, let alone a member of
your own family. I don't have much hope for you.
You will probably end up in State's Prison before
you are 25, and that's where you belong, any how.
There is nothing much you can do.
I think you haven't got any moral principles.
You won't acquire anything. Your parents won't
teach you what is right or wrong and won't watch
out.
Apparently your sister is pregnant; is that right?
THE MINOR'S FATHER: Yes.
THE COURT: It's a fine situation. How old is
she?
THE MINOR'S MOTHER: Fifteen.
THE COURT: Well, probably she will have a
half a dozen children and three or four marriages
before she is 18.
The County will have to take care of you. You
are no particular good to anybody. We ought to
send you out of the country—send you back to
Mexico. You belong in prison for the rest of your
life for doing things of this kind. You ought to

commit suicide. That's what I think of people of
this kind. You are lower than animals and haven't
the right to live in organized society—just
miserable, lousy, rotten people.
There is nothing we can do with you. You
expect the county to take care of you. Maybe
Hitler was right. The animals in our society
probably ought to be destroyed because they have
no right to live among human beings. If you refuse
to act like a human being, then, you don't belong
among the society of human beings.
MR. LUCERO: Your Honor, I don't think I can
sit here are listen to that sort of thing.
THE COURT: You are going to have to listen
to it because I consider this a very vulgar, rotten
human being.
MR. LUCERO: The Court is indicting the
whole Mexican group.
THE COURT: When they are 10 or 12 years of
age, going out and having intercourse with
anybody without any moral training—they don't
even understand the Ten Commandments. That's
all. Apparently, they don't want to.
So if you want to act like that, the county has a
system of taking care of them. They don't care
about that. They have no personal self-respect.
MR. LUCERO: The Court ought to look at this
youngster and deal with this youngster's case.
THE COURT: All right. That's what I am going
to do. The family should be able to control this
boy and the young girl.
MR. LUCERO: What appalls me is that the
court is saying that Hitler was right in genocide.
THE COURT: What are we going to do with
the mad dogs of our society? Either we have to kill
them or send them to an institution or place them
out of the hands of good people because that's the
theory—one of the theories of punishment is if
they get to the position that they want to act like

our society.

So if you want to act like that, the county has a
system of taking care of them. They don't care
about that. They have no personal self-respect.
MR. LUCERO: The Court ought to look at this
youngster and deal with this youngster's case.
THE COURT: All right. That's what I am going
to do. The family should be able to control this
boy and the young girl.
MR. LUCERO: What appalls me is that the
court is saying that Hitler was right in genocide.
THE COURT: What are we going to do with
the mad dogs of our society? Either we have to kill
them or send them to an institution or place them
out of the hands of good people because that's the
theory—one of the theories of punishment is if
they get to the position that they want to act like
mad dogs, then, we have to separate them from
our society.
Well, I will go along with the recommendation.
You will learn in time or else you will have to pay
for the penalty with the law because the law grinds
slowly but exceedingly well. If you are going to be
a law violator—you have to make up your mind
whether you are going to observe the law or not. If
you can't observe the law, then, you have to be
put away.
On September 2, 1969 a 17
year-old Chicano youth was tried
in Gilory for having committed
incest with his 15 year-old sister
The presiding juvenile court judge,
Gerald Chargin, apparently
expressed the views of many
Americans in his treatment of the
case.
Immediately after the contents
of the court transcript became
available to the public, popular
sentiment in the Santa Clara
Judicial District effected the
judge's reassignment to Palo Alto.
Chargin, who headed the local
Democratic Party in Santa Clara
for three years before his
appointment to the bench in
1959, now finds himself in a
personal predicament.

On Tuesday October 7, both
the Santa Clara Board of
Superintendents and the San Jose
City Council called for an
immediate investigation of
Chargin. The San Jose City
Council voted unanimously to
censure Chargin.
Formal Complaint
Moreover, a formal complaint
has been filed to the State
Commission on Judicial
Qualifications by the California
Rural Legal Assistance agency in
Gilroy. Most recently, the leaders
of the Santa Clara Democratic
Party are seeking his ouster.
For the past three days pickets
have greeted the judge at the Palo
Alto Court House. Signs reading
"A RACIST IN GILORY IS A

RACIST IN PALO ALTO"; "I
AM A MAN, NOT AN ANIMAL!"
"VIVA LA RAZA!" and others
have been constant reminders of
the feelings of Chicanos here at
Stanford and around the Palo
Alto community.
Incredible Remarks
So incredible were Judge
Chargin's remarks that we
Chicanos at Stanford have asked
that the official court transcript
be reprinted in the Stanford
Daily.
We hope that you will sign our
petitions for Chargin's removal
for, to paraphrase a common
saying: JUSTICE: LIVE IT OR
LEAVE IT!

The following is the entire text of the transcript
of the Sept. 2 hearing in Juvenile Court before
Judge Gerald Chargin.
Only the names of the 17 year old youth and
his family are omitted. The youth was represented
by Fred Lucero, deputy public defender.
Several organizations and government bodies
have called for an investigation. Tonight the Palo
Alto City Council will consider a resolution
condemning the actions of the judge and asking
for his removal.
THE COURT: There is some indication that
you more or less didn't think that it was against
the law or was improper. Haven't you had any
moral training? Have you and your family gone to
church?
THE MINOR: Yes sir.
THE COURT: Don't you know that things like
this are terribly wrong? This is one of the worst
crimes that a person can commit. I just get so
disgusted that I just figure what is the use. You are
just an animal. You are lower than an animal. Even
animals don't do that. You are pretty low.
I don't know why your parents haven't been
able to teach you anything or train you. Mexican
people, after 13 years of age it's perfectly all right
to go out and act like an animal. It's not even right
to do that to a stranger, let alone a member of
your own family. I don't have much hope for you.
You will probably end up in State's Prison before
you are 25, and that's where you belong, any how.
There is nothing much you can do.
I think you haven't got any moral principles.
You won't acquire anything. Your parents won't
teach you what is right or wrong and won't watch
out.
Apparently your sister is pregnant; is that right?
THE MINOR'S FATHER: Yes.
THE COURT: It's a fine situation. How old is
she?
THE MINOR'S MOTHER: Fifteen.
THE COURT: Well, probably she will have a
half a dozen children and three or four marriages
before she is 18.
The County will have to take care of you. You
are no particular good to anybody. We ought to
send you out of the country—send you back to
Mexico. You belong in prison for the rest of your
life for doing things of this kind. You ought to

commit suicide. That's what I think of people of
this kind. You are lower than animals and haven't
the right to live in organized society—just
miserable, lousy, rotten people.
There is nothing we can do with you. You
expect the county to take care of you. Maybe
Hitler was right. The animals in our society
probably ought to be destroyed because they have
no right to live among human beings. If you refuse
to act like a human being, then, you don't belong
among the society of human beings.
MR. LUCERO: Your Honor, I don't think I can
sit here are listen to that sort of thing.
THE COURT: You are going to have to listen
to it because I consider this a very vulgar, rotten
human being.
MR. LUCERO: The Court is indicting the
whole Mexican group.
THE COURT: When they are 10 or 12 years of
age, going out and having intercourse with
anybody without any moral training—they don't
even understand the Ten Commandments. That's
all. Apparently, they don't want to.
So if you want to act like that, the county has a
system of taking care of them. They don't care
about that. They have no personal self-respect.
MR. LUCERO: The Court ought to look at this
youngster and deal with this youngster's case.

to act like a human being, then, you don't belong
among the society of human beings.
MR. LUCERO: Your Honor, I don't think I can
sit here are listen to that sort of thing.
THE COURT: You are going to have to listen
to it because I consider this a very vulgar, rotten
human being.
MR. LUCERO: The Court is indicting the
whole Mexican group.
THE COURT: When they are 10 or 12 years of
age, going out and having intercourse with
anybody without any moral training—they don't
even understand the Ten Commandments. That's
all. Apparently, they don't want to.
So if you want to act like that, the county has a
system of taking care of them. They don't care
about that. They have no personal self-respect.
MR. LUCERO: The Court ought to look at this
youngster and deal with this youngster's case.
THE COURT: All right. That's what I am going
to do. The family should be able to control this
boy and the young girl.
MR. LUCERO: What appalls me is that the
court is saying that Hitler was right in genocide.
THE COURT: What are we going to do with
the mad dogs of our society? Either we have to kill
them or send them to an institution or place them
out of the hands of good people because that's the
theory—one of the theories of punishment is if
they get to the position that they want to act like
mad dogs, then, we have to separate them from
our society.
Well, I will go along with the recommendation.
You will learn in time or else you will have to pay
for the penalty with the law because the law grinds
slowly but exceedingly well. If you are going to be
a law violator—you have to make up your mind
whether you are going to observe the law or not. If
you can't observe the law, then, you have to be
put away.
