# 10 Day Convictions
## Are Dollies Really Plastic? 
### Stanford Dollies 
This, dear sir, shall not be a
sympathy note, which, at this
poir.t, is what I really think you
need. I actually would normally
pity anyone with the profound
split-second judgements you have
so prolificaly illustrated in the
October 16th issue of the Daily. I
say, normally.
However, because I am one of
those "plastic women" that you
spent so many words defining, I
can only write of my general
astonishhment. It seems to me
that you have actually forced
yourself to seek out those plastic
hellos and that freezing
insensitivity. I wonder if you
spent all hours of those eternal 10
days fitting different spoken
words into that M&M category. If
you did, which I believe your
article demonstrates, you are
really worse than the plastic
dollies you mention. You let nil
words, regardless of origin, drift
over your thoughts and your
sensitivity into that freezing level
of the stereotype. You, by
examining each word so
objectively and coldly, have
created a plastic shield around
yourself. It is no wonder to me
that everything on the outside
looks unreal and phony to you.
You have to look through that
shield.
Now, sir, with the creation of
that shield, you have lost the
opportunity to see that you are
wrong-that the majority of girls
at Stanford are not insufferable
egoists constantly searching for
"stud" heads to add to their
"elastic" belts. With that shield
surrounding you, you shall never
see that Stanford is not a
"platinum plated, diamond
studded, silk shrouded, plastic
protrusion."
I guess, in a way, this letter did
turn out to be a sympathy note. I
must say that, after my
astonishment has subsided, I can
only show forth sympathy to
anyone who has created a plastic
shield around themselves, such as
you have. This shield, sir, shall
never protect you from the
phoniness. No, instead, it enclosed
you in it and prohibits the
possibility that you will ever
break out of your 10 day
convictions and really examine
the people here at Stanford. I'm
sorrv!
An Astonished Donnerite

To newcomers, Stanford may
appear cold and isolated, an ivory
tower cut off from the world.
This view is quite understandable,
with one major point of
difference. The buildings, and the
institution, may be ivory, but the
people are real.
"Hello" need not be
hypocritical. Not every Stanford
woman is solely interested in
trapping her 2.1 counterparts, just
as not every man is simply out to
beat the odds, though some may
occasionally give that impression.
Honest and friendly people
actually exist in this world, and
some of them have even found
their way to Stanford.
Cynicism must sometimes be
set aside. Ulterior motives can
always be found or fabricated, if
one tries hard enough. However,
when that co-ed bounces down
the stairs and says "Hi!" she
doesn't know what sinister
motives are being attributed to
her. Her mind may be on drawing
those 2.1 males into some deadly
trap, but more likely she is simply
feeling good and wants to share
her feelings. And when she asks,
"How are you?", there is always
the faint possibility that she may
really want to know.
Stanford is isolated; everyone
knows and feels that. Home and
family, old friends and
schoolmates, and the world in
general seem very far away,
especially to freshmen. Stanford
seems to be a world in itself, at
times a country club, always apart
from reality.
And yet there are real people
here, and they do think real
thoughts and share real feelings.
The one who fails to share this
reality is the one who will not
accept it as real. To those who can
accept, with an open mind, the
hypothesis that good does exist in
the world and that all is not
selfishness, the idea of a Stanford
"dolly" is meaningless. There are
no "dollies" or "studs," only
human beings.
