# Flicks To Feature Cagney, Hepburn
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
James Cagney, Kararine
Hepburn, Cary Grant, James
Stewart and Humphrey Bogart are
among those appearing on campus
screens this week.
Tonight at 9 p.m. in the art
auditorium, the experimental film
series will consits of Buddha's
Party, The Nose, Swing Low Suite
Chariot, Keep Off the Grass, The
Family Fallout Shelter and All
Around the Water Tank.
After a 20-minute Laurel and
Hardy short, Below Zero, Clive
Miller will present two fine, tough
*30's dramas. James Cagney and
Joan Blondell star in The Crowd
Roars, an auto racing story
directed by auteur favorite
Howard Hawks. Barbara
Stanwyck and, again, Joan
Blondell, head the cast of Night
Nurse, a blistering expose of the
medical business. William Wellman
directed. In Geology 320 on
Tuesday.
This Wednesday in Tresidder,
the ballet and opera film series
will show Plisetskaya Dances,
which includes scenes from "Swan
Lake," "Romeo and Juliet" and
"Sparta." Also showing is Behind
the Scenes at the Royal Ballet,
featuring Fonteyn and Nureyev.
Macbeth Modernized
Siberian Lady Macbeth, this
week's International Center film,
is a Polish modernization of the
Macbeth story. The film, directed
in 1961 by the famed Andrezej
Wahda, will be shown in
Cubberley at 7:45 on Thursday.
Godard's Les Carabiniers (The
Riflemen) is a highly intellectual
attack on both war and the glossy
anti-war movies. Made in 1963
but not released stateside until

last year, the film has proved
somewhat beyond the reach of
most audiences. At the time it was
made, the film represented
Godard's deepest plunge yet into
the political cinema. At Tresidder
on Friday.
Spanish Civil War
To Die in Madrid is a
semi-documentary which pays
tribute to the defeated Loyalists
of the Spanish Civil War.
Acclaimed by many as a brilliant
mixture of newsreel and
modern-day footage, the film will
be shown on Friday in Cubberley.
Showing Saturday at Tresidder
is perhaps the epitome of the
sophisticated cocktail comedies,
The Philadelphia Story. Starring
are the peerless Katharine
Hepburn, Cary Grant and James
Stewart in his Academy
Award-winning role. The wacky
proceedings were directed by
George Cukor.
While rfind The African Queen
somewhat silly (especially the
ending) and certainly not
representative of the best work of
the artists involved, I know I am
in tiny minority here. Humphrey
Bogart received a long-overdue
Oscar for this picture and
Katharine Hepburn is his curious
companion in this
adventure/comedy written by
James Agee and directed by John
Huston. In Cubberley on Saturday
at 7 and 9:30.
The Fox should be a great deal
of fun to see at the Sunday Flicks.
For all the attention payed to the
film's lesbian angle, the love scene
between Keir Dullea and Anne
Heywood is much more intense
and torrid than Miss Heywood
and Sandy Dennis' exchange of
kisses.

film's lesbian angle, the love scene
between Keir Dullea and Anne
Heywood is much more intense
and torrid than Miss Heywood
and Sandy Dennis' exchange of
kisses.

James Cagney, Kararine
Hepburn, Cary Grant, James
Stewart and Humphrey Bogart are
among those appearing on campus
screens this week.
Tonight at 9 p.m. in the art
auditorium, the experimental film
series will consits of Buddha's
Party, The Nose, Swing Low Suite
Chariot, Keep Off the Grass, The
Family Fallout Shelter and All
Around the Water Tank.
After a 20-minute Laurel and
Hardy short, Below Zero, Clive
Miller will present two fine, tough
*30's dramas. James Cagney and
Joan Blondell star in The Crowd
Roars, an auto racing story
directed by auteur favorite
Howard Hawks. Barbara
Stanwyck and, again, Joan
Blondell, head the cast of Night
Nurse, a blistering expose of the
medical business. William Wellman
directed. In Geology 320 on
Tuesday.
This Wednesday in Tresidder,
the ballet and opera film series
will show Plisetskaya Dances,
which includes scenes from "Swan
Lake," "Romeo and Juliet" and
"Sparta." Also showing is Behind
the Scenes at the Royal Ballet,
featuring Fonteyn and Nureyev.
Macbeth Modernized
Siberian Lady Macbeth, this
week's International Center film,
is a Polish modernization of the
Macbeth story. The film, directed
in 1961 by the famed Andrezej
Wahda, will be shown in
Cubberley at 7:45 on Thursday.
Godard's Les Carabiniers (The
Riflemen) is a highly intellectual
attack on both war and the glossy
anti-war movies. Made in 1963
but not released stateside until

last year, the film has proved
somewhat beyond the reach of
most audiences. At the time it was
made, the film represented
Godard's deepest plunge yet into
the political cinema. At Tresidder
on Friday.
Spanish Civil War
To Die in Madrid is a
semi-documentary which pays
tribute to the defeated Loyalists
of the Spanish Civil War.
Acclaimed by many as a brilliant
mixture of newsreel and
modern-day footage, the film will
be shown on Friday in Cubberley.
Showing Saturday at Tresidder
is perhaps the epitome of the
sophisticated cocktail comedies,
The Philadelphia Story. Starring
are the peerless Katharine
Hepburn, Cary Grant and James
Stewart in his Academy
Award-winning role. The wacky
proceedings were directed by
George Cukor.
While rfind The African Queen
somewhat silly (especially the
ending) and certainly not
representative of the best work of
the artists involved, I know I am
in tiny minority here. Humphrey
Bogart received a long-overdue
Oscar for this picture and
Katharine Hepburn is his curious
companion in this
adventure/comedy written by
James Agee and directed by John
Huston. In Cubberley on Saturday
at 7 and 9:30.
The Fox should be a great deal
of fun to see at the Sunday Flicks.
For all the attention payed to the
film's lesbian angle, the love scene
between Keir Dullea and Anne
Heywood is much more intense
and torrid than Miss Heywood
and Sandy Dennis' exchange of
kisses.
