# Zionist Country Club

### Patricia Mihaly 
I would like to comment on
Dan Snell's article on "Israel's
War" in Thursday's Daily. He
states, regarding Israel's raids on
Arab territory, that militarism
"can also consist of continuous
aggressive actions by men with
peaceful intentions who have not
forged alternatives to war." I will
agree that there is no easy
solution to the Arab-Israeli war,
but any thought that aggression
with peaceful intentions will have
the desired effect misunderstands
the whole problem. "Aggressive
defense" by Israel will never
achieve peace—a lull in the
fighting, perhaps, while weapons
and economies are
replenished—but not peace.
The problem is one in which
Jews and Arabs can get along, but
Zionists and Arabs cannot. No
people like exclusive clubs in
which the absence of special
qualifications bar them from
entrancy or privileges. If such
clubs bar one from entrance to his
own house the person either uses
legal means of redress, or if he is
politically ineffective—he fights.
Zionism, an ideology of
exclusivism, has created it sown
club called Israel. If you are a
Jew, membership (citizenship) is
automatic, but if you are an Arab
(Moslem or Christian), even if you
were born in a house now taken
over by the club, you have at best,
great difficulty entering, and if
you ary lucky you become an
associate member (second-class
citizen) with only limited
privileges.
The Enemy Is Zionism
Arabs are not trying to fight
Jews, but they are fighting an
exclusivism (Zionism) which was
imposed on the land that in the
1920's was 90% theirs and just
before the partition in 1947 was

67% theirs—an exclusivism
imposed by the UN (defender of
self-determination?) and the
conquests of war.
The Arabs fought Zionist
exclusivism in their opposition to
the Balfour Declaration of 1917.
They fought it in their statements
to the objective U.S. King-Crane
Commission of 1919 in which
they showed how strongly they
opposed Zionist exclusivism in
their midst. They fought it before
the U.N. to stop the partition of
Palestine in 1947. And in fact, all
the countries in the area voted
against the partition—to no avail.
(These countries were
Afghanistan, Greece, India,
Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the
Arab countries.)
When all these attempts failed,
the Arabs fought Zionism with
guns. They lost three wars against
Israel but are willing to fight
again.
Jewish State
To eliminate the exclusivism of
Israel means to eliminate Zionism.
It means that Israel will no longer
be a "Jewish State" with all the
racial or religious exclusivism that
the name implies. It means that
Arabs will be able to share in
governing the land in direct
proportion to the share of land
they legally own. It does not
mean that Jews will be driven into
the sea, but only that Zionism
will.
When all this is done Arabs will
feel no need for blockades,
boycotts, fedayeen, and arms
from the East. Nor will Jews feel
the need by massive arms and
world drives for sympathy and
support. There will be no
refugees, no occupied territories,
and no "aggressive defense." In
short, Arabs and Jews will again
get along as they did for centuries.

There is only one way to a
lasting peace in the Middle East,
and only one side can insure it. In
simple terms, the Jews who
introduced exclusivism into the
Middle East must eliminate it.
