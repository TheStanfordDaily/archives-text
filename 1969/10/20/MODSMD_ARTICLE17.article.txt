## Vanquish Real World 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
A heavy opera with a grimly
symbplic title, like Twilight of the
Gods or The Force of Destiny,
would have suited my frame of
mind on Moratorium Day at the
Opera House. As it was, the S.F.
Opera swept me from the world
of the Bomb to the world of the
bom be with its delectable,
high-cholesterol production of
Donizetti's The Elixir of Love.
Such a heady change could
have been unnerving; however, I
am happy to report that—for
three hours at least—the dreary
Real World with all its concerted
problems was obliterated by force
majeure. The force majeure in this
case was as fine a quartet of
singirtg actors as imagination
could invent.
The plot of Elixir, silly when
taken; as a whole, is like most
Italiaen comic operas a loosely
connected chain of situational
imbroglios. The frolicking humor
of these episodes is what makes
the jopera a success. Hence,
Donizetti is interested in
developing the possibilities of his
very simple story, and there are
obviously very many in a love
triangle involving a strutting
sergeant-of-troop, a vain coquette
and ? naive, amorous bumpkin,
and you have The Elizir of Love
in hand.
Pride —a kind of mindless,
happy-hearted hubris—is the
comnjon trait of the characters.
Each indulges in some
monumental self-inflation—only
to be beaten severely about the
puffefl chest and ego by sudden
twists of the plot.
This pride is implicitly present
in the music. Thus, Sgt. Belcore
will intimidate his rival with a
string; of booming roulades, or
Adina will shun her rustic lover
with ! an imperious and utterly
final i high C. My point here is
simply to suggest that vocal
heroism and self-esteem are an
integral part of the comedy of
Elizir: and then to add that this
production sparkles with
intelligent dramatic and vocal
self-puffery. The soloists captured
the genuine spirit of the opera.
A Culminating Dulcamara
Though reluctant to jar the
balance of the cast, I am obliged
to isolate Sesto Bruscantini's
triumph as the (to borrow some
apt words of Christopher Fry)
"bubble-mouthing, fog-blathering,
chin-qhuntering, chap-flapping"
Doctor Dulcamara. It is the
culmination of long experience on
the stage and bespeaks the kind of
operatic excellence which is

beyond mere praise and which
evokes a kind of reverence.
Brustantini's voice is still in
good condition: he is refusing to
allow his formidable reputation to
overtake his presence. He deserves
a show-piece here in S.F. before it
is indeed too late, and I would
recommend the role of the
superannuated lover in Donizetti's
other comedy Don Pasquale.
Reri Grist's pre-eminence as
San Francisco's coloratura
coquette was reaffirmed, if such
was necessary. Her fine,
platinum-thread voice seems
comfortable in even the most
treacherous passages. There is no
trepidation or tension before the
do-or-die moments when she is in
charge.
Lovable Hayseed
Luciano Pavarotti's
tremendous vocal and physical
girth were both lent to an
unusually carefree and bumptious
portrayal of homely Nemorino.
The result: a lovable 250-pound
hayseed. A hazard of the part is a
detachment arising from
preoccupation with the difficult
aria Nemorino must sing in the
last act.
Pavarotti, however, was casual
and vocally relaxed from the
outset. He finally sang his big aria
with much success, though I was
put off by a few impertinent

pseudo-falsetto tones injected,
presumably, for artistic effect.
Pavarotti is heartily confident in
his use of his smooth, resonant
voice.
Peacocks ahve a few things to
learn about strutting from Ingvar
Wixell's Sgt. Belcore. Wixell was
the picture of military
take-charge-sim, and he sang with
just the right over-weening
bravura. But even the villian of
the opera (bel/core=good/heart) is
an engaging personage, and Wixell
was indeed charming in his
boorishness.
Lofti Mansouri's stage
direction tends to blur the
distinction between precious stage
business and abjectly precious
stage business, but by the end of
the first act all defenses were
battered down and I chuckled at
everything—even the thirsty horse.
The conductor, Giuseppe
Patane, decided to stay out of
harm's way and allowed the
singers to have their own way.
Elixir, of course, tends to
encourage a self-effacing
conductor and orchestra.
Visually, this production is,
along with Rossini's Barber of
Seville, one of the Opera's most
satisfying and pleasurable. The
opera will be repeated this Sunday
afternoon.
