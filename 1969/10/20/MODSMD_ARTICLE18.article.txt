# Student Pressure Heeded
## Overseas Restrictions Eased 
### DAVE PARKE 
Recent liberalization in the
regulations of the five overseas
campuses accords students abroad
most of the freedoms of the home
campus.
The rule changes were decided
at a meeting of the ten overseas
campus directors in Vienna last
July, after the directors were
deluged by protests from students
decrying the outdated rules at the
campuses.
The directors voted to revise
requirements to reflect more
realistically the changing customs
of the host countries.
Attendance requirements are
now left to the discretion of the
instructor. Uhder the old
regulations students were to
remain at the campus from
Sunday night through Friday
morning.
Students are required to be
enrolled in the academic program,
to attend the orientation program,
and to participate in the major
field trips of each group. In
accordance with university policy,
individual instructors may include
attendance and participation in
class work as factors in evaluating
students' performance. Students

are also required to live at the
campuses.
Prohibition Lifted
The rule with regard to liquor
consumption now simply
proscribes disturbances and
disorderly conduct resulting from
the effects of liquor. Previously all
hard liquor was prohibited.
No visitors were allowed at any
campus under the old rules. The
matter is now left to the
individual campus, which bases it. c
decision on its needs and available
facilities.
The old rule designating the
proper attire for different campus
activities was also abolished.
Student Protest
Last April members of Italy
XVII sent a signed petition to
Director of Overseas Campuses
Robert Walker protesting the class
attendance requirement and the
residence requirement.
In June, John Hughes then
president of Austria VIII said in a
six-page letter to Walker . . the
rule (with regard to the residence
and academic participation
requirement) is inconsistent with
two basic principles of the
University: (first, that education is
primarily ai matter of individual
responsibility; second, that the
rules under which a community
lives should be established by the
members of that community."
Before the directors' meeting
in Vienna many other letters in
support of rule liberalization were
sent to the different directors and
the Overseas Campus Office.

When the first Overseas
Campus was opened in Germany
in 1958 there was no formalized
system of regulations. The
directors of the program soon
realized that some rules were
necessary to protect the students
and facilitate their adjustment to
a new society.
When Germany was first
opened there was no restriction
on the purchase or use of
motorcycles. Nevertheless, the
large number of injuries resulted
in a regulation which is still in
effect prohibiting motorcycles.
George Hamrdla, Assistant
Director of the Overseas Campus
program commented, "What most
students don't realize is that the
rules and regulations make life
more difficult for us."
Organization is Needed
Hamrdla pointed out that
Germany had tried to operate
without rules but that the
functioning of the campus was
impaired. "We realize, though,
that the education of the
individual Stanford student is our
prime responsibility, not a smooth
functioning system, but a degree
of organization is needed."
Hamrdla endorsed the new
regulations and said, "There will
naturally be a certain amount of
readjustment for the student
going abroad, but we shouldn't be
in a position to demand a total
readjustment."

realized that some rules were
necessary to protect the students
and facilitate their adjustment to
a new society.
When Germany was first
opened there was no restriction
on the purchase or use of
motorcycles. Nevertheless, the
large number of injuries resulted
in a regulation which is still in
effect prohibiting motorcycles.
George Hamrdla, Assistant
Director of the Overseas Campus
program commented, "What most
students don't realize is that the
rules and regulations make life
more difficult for us."
Organization is Needed
Hamrdla pointed out that
Germany had tried to operate
without rules but that the
functioning of the campus was
impaired. "We realize, though,
that the education of the
individual Stanford student is our
prime responsibility, not a smooth
functioning system, but a degree
of organization is needed."
Hamrdla endorsed the new
regulations and said, "There will
naturally be a certain amount of
readjustment for the student
going abroad, but we shouldn't be
in a position to demand a total
readjustment."
Recent liberalization in the
regulations of the five overseas
campuses accords students abroad
most of the freedoms of the home
campus.
The rule changes were decided
at a meeting of the ten overseas
campus directors in Vienna last
July, after the directors were
deluged by protests from students
decrying the outdated rules at the
campuses.
The directors voted to revise
requirements to reflect more
realistically the changing customs
of the host countries.
Attendance requirements are
now left to the discretion of the
instructor. Uhder the old
regulations students were to
remain at the campus from
Sunday night through Friday
morning.
Students are required to be
enrolled in the academic program,
to attend the orientation program,
and to participate in the major
field trips of each group. In
accordance with university policy,
individual instructors may include
attendance and participation in
class work as factors in evaluating
students' performance. Students

are also required to live at the
campuses.
Prohibition Lifted
The rule with regard to liquor
consumption now simply
proscribes disturbances and
disorderly conduct resulting from
the effects of liquor. Previously all
hard liquor was prohibited.
No visitors were allowed at any
campus under the old rules. The
matter is now left to the
individual campus, which bases it. c
decision on its needs and available
facilities.
The old rule designating the
proper attire for different campus
activities was also abolished.
Student Protest
Last April members of Italy
XVII sent a signed petition to
Director of Overseas Campuses
Robert Walker protesting the class
attendance requirement and the
residence requirement.
In June, John Hughes then
president of Austria VIII said in a
six-page letter to Walker . . the
rule (with regard to the residence
and academic participation
requirement) is inconsistent with
two basic principles of the
University: (first, that education is
primarily ai matter of individual
responsibility; second, that the
rules under which a community
lives should be established by the
members of that community."
Before the directors' meeting
in Vienna many other letters in
support of rule liberalization were
sent to the different directors and
the Overseas Campus Office.

Campus was opened in Germany
in 1958 there was no formalized
