# Hoover Appointment
## Procedures Detaled 
### 
President Kenneth S. Pitzer
and Dr. W. Glenn Campbell,
director of the Hoover Institute,
have agreed upon a statement of
"appointment procedures in the
Hoover Institution."
In the statement issued to the
faculty, President Pitzer said that
the basic principles for
"appropriate independent review
of the quality of candidates for
appointment or promotion to
scholarly positions at a senior
level could be fulfilled within the
special trustees' resolution" made
on May 21, 1959.
The statement further said: "In
the case of a position such as
Curator, Archivist, and Librarian
(Grade IV), where there is
considerable interaction with
faculty members, there will be a
search committee containing
members from elsewhere in the
University as well as from the
Hoover Institution staff.
"In the case of a senior research
staff member, to be given the title
of Senior Fellow, a
recommendation of the Hoover
Institution, like that of an
academic department, will be
reviewed with respect to the
quality of the candidate's
scholarship by appropriate leaders
in his field of research either
within the Stanford community
or elsewhere. In either case, I will
consider the advice of the search

committee or of the reviewers
before reaching my decision.
Joint Appointments
"Nothing precludes a joint ap
pointment to a professorship in
an academic department along
with a senior fellowship in the
Hoover, and in that case the
normal review process for the
professorship would suffice.
I hope that there will be more
such joint appointments in the
future. Increased interaction
between the Hoover and academic
departments should strengthen
our international research and
educational program and make
better use of our outstanding
resources in this area.
