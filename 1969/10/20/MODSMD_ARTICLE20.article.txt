# Dist. Attorney Demands Daily Protest Pictures
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily has been
ordered to surrender its
photographs of last spring's
demonstration at the Stanford
Research Institute.
The Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office
subpoenaed all photographs and
negatives of the May 16 and 19
demonstrations taken by staff
photographers.
According to the order, issued
for the trial of non-student Steve
Kessler, the photographs must be
turned over to officials by
tomorrow.
The legal document was served
on Daily editor Mark Weinberger
while he was at last Wednesday's
Vietnam Moratorium rally in
downtown Palo Alto.
It was the second time the Palo
Alto Municipal Court tried to
force The Daily to provide photos
as evidence in trials of
demonstrators. Atty. James
Wolpman last Tuesday obtained a
court order quashing a similar
demand for Daily photos to be
used as evidence in the earlier trial

of Marc Sapir, who was arrested in
the same demonstration. The
subpoena was denied on a legal
technicality.

Wolpman is expected to
contest The Daily's current
subpoena at the opening of
Kessler's trial tomorrow. Kessler,
22, is slated to be tried for charges
of unlawful assembly, disturbing
the peace, inciting to riot,
obstructing traffic and trespassing.
More than 80 defendants still
await trial from last spring's
protests. Court dockets are
crowded, and most of the trials
have been pushed back to
November and December. About
15 warrants for arrest from the
demonstrations still remain
unserved.
In the trials already conducted,
the prosecution relied heavily on
photographic evidence, both to
depict the riotous conditions and
to show the presence of the
defendants at the scene of the
tumult. Jail sentences have been
meted out in several instances.
