# Tribe Stifles Hapless Cougars
## 
### FRED MANN 
"UCLA is not weak any place.
In fact, I would say that Stanford
and UCLA are very close.
Whoever plays a perfect game will
win."
Washington State's Jim Sweeny
had just seen his football team
destroyed by John Ralston's
squad, 49-0. But he sat calmly and
talked of the Bruins who had
mutilated his team just the week
before.
"UCLA has great speed,
especially on defense. Their big
men are amazingly fast. But
Stanford can hurt you more ways.
They have the most versatile
attack in the conference. Neither
can afford to make a mistake."
Versatile Stanford meets
UCLA next Saturday in the
Stadium in a must game for both.
The Bruins hold the inside track
for the Rose Bowl right now, and
the Tribe is on the extreme
outside.
The loss to USC last week put
the Indians on the ropes, and
UCLA could knock them out
entirely. But Stanford is not going
to play dead. They didn't
Saturday either.
Slow Start
After a slow start which looked
ominously like the feared post-SC
letdown, Jim Plunkett passed over
the middle for 37 yards and a
touchdown to Lineman of the
Game Jack Lasater. That was all
they needed, but they added six
more touchdowns and breezed
past WSU in a game that was
never in doubt.
Although it had its share of
great plays and individual
standouts, the contest did not
rival the Purdue or SC games for
excitement. It didn't even rival
San Jose State.
The Stanford offense ran up
505 total yards, gained 24 first
downs, and generally did whatever
they wanted to do. The defense
held the Cougars to six first
downs, 18 yards passing, a total of
109 yards gained all day, and
posted their second shutout of the
year.
Record Breaker
Plunkett passed for 165 yards
and two touchdowns, and came
even closer to all the Stanford
all-time offensive records. He now
has 26 TD passes, only two short
by Bobby Garrett's record, and
his 170 total yards gained make
him only 131 yards shy of Dick
Norman's total offense career
mark of 3,654 yards. Jim now has

14 games left in his Stanford
career to completely destroy the
entire record book.
The records may come falling
down around Jim Plunkett, but
Saturday's game belonged to Don
Bunce. The junior from Woodside
proved himself the second best
QB on the coast as he finally got a
chance to play.
He was great. Coming in for
the final play of the first quarter,
he pulled a quarterback delay up
the middle for 19 yards. In the
third period, Bunce ran crazy and
got nowhere.
Nowhere Fast
After two passes to Lineman of
the Game Lasater (who totaled
116 yards on seven receptions),
Bunce was dropped trying to pass
again. Suddenly it was third and
22 on the Stanford 40 yard line.
On a keeper up the middle,
Bunce went for 25, only to have it
called back on a clipping penalty.
So he scrambled on the next play
finding Bob Moore for 26 yards
and a first down. But that too was
called back on an illegal receiver
penalty.
Over all, Bunce compiled 151
yards with his running, averaging
10 yards per carry, had a long
break of 45 yards on a keeper up
the middle, and threw for the
final TD on a fourth and ten
situation to Ron Kadziel. Needless
to say, the pressbox writers voted
'lim Back of the Game.
Parish Scores
Bunce and Lasater were not
the only Stanford stars. The
leading ground gainer and scorer
on the Stanford freshman team of
1966 finally scored his first points
of the season in the second
quarter. Don Parish is now a
linebacker instead of a frosh
fullback. His interception at the
WSU 23 was returned for a score.
Rich Keller who also sparkled
against USC the week before got
into the scoring act as he picked
off a Cougar pass and raced 44
yards through the air.
Steve Horowitz never came
close to missing in his seven
straight PAT's, and now has
scored 31 points on the year.
Vataha Shines
Two other Tribe pass catchers
turned in fine afternoons. Randy
Vataha caught only one, but
found a new home for himself in
the kick return department. He
ran back three punts for 47 yards,
and one 28 yard burst that set up
the final TD.
"Bob Moore is the best tight
end in college football," said

WSUS Coach Sweeny. "Stanford
uses their tight end more than any
other school in the nation, and I
now see why. That catch Moore
made was just fantastic."
Bob made the circus grab
midway through the second
period. He went up and over the
middleat the WSU one yard line
where he juggled a high Plunkett
pass hauling it in on his way to

the ground. The next play was
Howie Williams' scoring plunge.
INlinor Injuries
Jim Cross also performed well
with four catches and one TD, but
left the game with a shoulder
injury. Dick Oliver also suffered a
hip pointer.
It was a good effort for
Stanford against a not too tough
opponent. The Cougars only ran
14 plays inside Stanford territory,

and the closest they came to
scoring was the Stanford 38 yard
line.
UCLA in the meantime was
blowing California out of the
Coliseum with a 32-0 win. USC
retained their title as the luckiest
team in any sport ever played by
gaining a tie with Notre Dame
14-14. So the picture is still
clouded. Next week will clear up
everything.
