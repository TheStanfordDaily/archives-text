# Bruins Coming Up
## Poloists Capture Two 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's water polo team
tuned up for next weekend's
encounter with league favorite
UCLA by taking a pair of
impressive weekend victories, 18-4
over Foothill and 8-6 over San
Jose State.
Against Foothill, Stanford
jumped off to a quick 4-0 lead on
four first quarter goals by
outstanding sophomore star, Rick
Massimino. The Indians were
never challenged the rest of the
way as they picked up five more
second quarter goals to take a 9-1
halftime advantage.
Despite the fact that Coach
Gaughran substituted freely, the
Indians still could not be stopped
and they equalized their first half
production to take an 18-4
victory.
Stanford's awesome scoring
display was divided primarily
between four players; Massimino
finished with five goals,
sophomore second stringer Brook
Cross looked great as he picked up
four goals, while Wayne Wilson
and Rob Jensen each added three
apiece. Despite Stanford's finest
offensive display of the year, the
play of the Indian's fantastic
sophomore goalie Peter Gadd was
once again outstanding.

With the outcome long since
decided, the biggest excitement of
the second half came when the
incomparable but undermanned
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band attempted
drumless renditions of "Come
Join the Band," "Surf City," and
"Tell Mama."
Early Saturday morning, the
Indians took on defending
national champion San Jose State.
The Indians had defeated SJS
earlier this year and the Spartans
were determined to avenge the
earlier setback.
The first quarter featured some
great defense and goalkeeping by
both teams as the Indians and
Spartans played to a 1-1 standoff.
Stanford finally took a 3-2 lead at
4:09 of the second quarter and
although tied a couple of times,
the Indians never fell behind
again.
After San Jose scored on a
penalty shot to tie the game up,
the Indians took a 4-3 halftime

lead on a shot by Jensen with less
than a minute left in the half.
But in the third quarter
Massimino really made his
presence known as he scored three
of his six goals to give Stanford a
7-4 lead. San Jose State attempted
a fourth quarter comeback, but
they ran out of time and for the
second time this season, the
Indians had held on to defeat the
tough Spartans, this time by an
8-6 count.
Although Massimino's six goal
production was truly an
unbelievable feat, Stanford might
have needed some more goals had
it not been for Gadd, who once
again made some crucial saves,
especially during the all important
third quarter.
Stanford with an 8-3 record
now has to worry about next
Saturday's must game with
UCLA, which will be played at
Stanford at 10 a.m. But before
taking on the Bruins, the Indians
have to again face De Anza at
3:30 p.m. on Friday.

although tied a couple of times,
the Indians never fell behind
again.
After San Jose scored on a
penalty shot to tie the game up,
the Indians took a 4-3 halftime

lead on a shot by Jensen with less
than a minute left in the half.
But in the third quarter
Massimino really made his
presence known as he scored three
of his six goals to give Stanford a
7-4 lead. San Jose State attempted
a fourth quarter comeback, but
they ran out of time and for the
second time this season, the
Indians had held on to defeat the
tough Spartans, this time by an
8-6 count.
Although Massimino's six goal
production was truly an
unbelievable feat, Stanford might
have needed some more goals had
it not been for Gadd, who once
again made some crucial saves,
especially during the all important
third quarter.
Stanford with an 8-3 record
now has to worry about next
Saturday's must game with
UCLA, which will be played at
Stanford at 10 a.m. But before
taking on the Bruins, the Indians
have to again face De Anza at
3:30 p.m. on Friday.
Stanford's water polo team
tuned up for next weekend's
encounter with league favorite
UCLA by taking a pair of
impressive weekend victories, 18-4
over Foothill and 8-6 over San
Jose State.
Against Foothill, Stanford
jumped off to a quick 4-0 lead on
four first quarter goals by
outstanding sophomore star, Rick
Massimino. The Indians were
never challenged the rest of the
way as they picked up five more
second quarter goals to take a 9-1
halftime advantage.
Despite the fact that Coach
Gaughran substituted freely, the
Indians still could not be stopped
and they equalized their first half
production to take an 18-4
victory.
Stanford's awesome scoring
display was divided primarily
between four players; Massimino
finished with five goals,
sophomore second stringer Brook
Cross looked great as he picked up
four goals, while Wayne Wilson
and Rob Jensen each added three
apiece. Despite Stanford's finest
offensive display of the year, the
play of the Indian's fantastic
sophomore goalie Peter Gadd was
once again outstanding.

With the outcome long since
decided, the biggest excitement of
the second half came when the
incomparable but undermanned
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band attempted
drumless renditions of "Come
Join the Band," "Surf City," and
"Tell Mama."
Early Saturday morning, the
Indians took on defending
national champion San Jose State.
The Indians had defeated SJS
earlier this year and the Spartans
were determined to avenge the
earlier setback.
The first quarter featured some
great defense and goalkeeping by
both teams as the Indians and
Spartans played to a 1-1 standoff.
Stanford finally took a 3-2 lead at
4:09 of the second quarter and
although tied a couple of times,
the Indians never fell behind
again.
