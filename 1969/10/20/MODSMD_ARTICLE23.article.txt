# The 						Bull Pen
## Rose Bowl Rat Race 
### Fred Mann 
Can Stanford go to the Rose
Bowl this year, or did the SC loss
finish everything?
The answer is yes, Stanford
still has a shot at the bowl, but
getting there will be awfully
difficult. It will depend not only
on the Tribe winning all of their
remaining games, but also on USC
and UCLA losing.
The Pacific-8 rule is one of the
most confusing ever devised for
anything. It first states that the
"Conference Champion" shall
always be determined by a
won-loss percentage. This favors
UCLA and Stanford, since USC
only plays six league games (they
do not meet Oregon).
But the "Conference
Champion" is not always the Rose
Bowl representative. So much for
the advantage. If the "Champion"
is tied with another team in the
loss and lie columns of the Pac-8
standings, the team that won the
regular season meeting between
the two teams will go to Pasadena.
If Stanford wins all the rest of
their league contests (including
UCLA), and the Bruins beat USC
in the last game of the year, then
all three teams would have one
league loss. The rule is no good
since each team both won and lost
to their opponents during the
season.
If such a situation arises, a
point system is put into effect.
This states: a conference win is
worth 4 points, a non-conference
win is worth 3 points, a
conference tie is worth 2 points,
and a non-conference tie is worth
IV4 points.

Assuming all three schools win
their remaining non-league games,
UCLA would go to the bowl.
They would have compiled 33
points (24 for their six Pac-8 wins,
and 9 for three ether victories).
USC would have 30Vi points (20
for winning five of their six league
games, 9 for their four non-league
triumphs and 1 Vi for their tie
against Notre Dame on Saturday).
Stanford would have only 30
points (24 for six Pac-8 victories,
but only 6 for non-league wins).
The Purdue loss suddenly
becomes vital. (Maybe not
changing the pass defense was a
mistake. The rule is unfair to the
JTrojansâ€”they are penalized one
point for only playing six
conference games. At the same
time, the system gives an unfair
advantage to UCLA since they
met three of the worst teams in
the country (Pittsburgh,
Wisconsin, and Northwestern) in
their non-league games.
California is still in contention
for all the marbles, but after their
staggering defeat to UCLA (32-0)
on Saturday, they can not be
counted on as a top contender.
So for Stanford to make it to
the Rose Bowl, a number of wild
things mist happen. First, they
must win all their remaining
league games. A loss to Air Force
would not hurt at all since under
the point system, Stanford can
not win.
Secondly, USC must be beaten
twice by Pac-8 teams. UCLA is
very capable of doing it, and, in
my opinion, probably will. But
someone else must do it also. If
SC ends the year with only one
league loss, in a tie with Stanford,
they would go to the bowl ahead
of the Indians by virtue of their
26-24 win.
Stanford's old friends in
Berkeley have the best
opportunity of knocking off the
Trojans when they play in two
weeks. After that, SC faces only

Washington State and Washington
before the UCLA game. So it's up
to Cal.
Finally, UCLA must lose here
next week or Stanford is
obviously dead. After thai, they
must eliminate USC by beating
them. If a two-way tie develops
between Stanford and anyone, it
must he UCLA.
So the outlook is not bright.
Chances are slim and none. Most
likely it will all come down to the
final game of the year in Los
Angeles. BUT, if Cal can come
through for the Tribe, and the
Tribe can come through for
themselves next week against the
Bruins, it is still possible. Stranger
things have happened.
