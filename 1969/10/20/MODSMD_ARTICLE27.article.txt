Nobel Laureate Robert
Hofstadter will speak on
"Discovery and Consequences—A
Personal Experience" tomorrow
in Room 100 of the Physics
lecture Hall.
His lecture is the first in a
series of six lectures titled
"Physics and Man." The lectures
are sponsored by the Department
of Physics and the Committee on
Public Exercises.
Prof. Hofstadter, who heads
the High Energy Physics
Laboratory, will discuss some of
his early research work and its
subsequent benefits to man. His
lecture is entitled "Discovery and
Consequences—A Personal
Experience." It will be open to
the public.
The Stanford physicist shared
the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics
for his precise measurements of
atomic nuclei using the
billion-volt Mark 111 accelerator in
the laboratory he now directs. It
is currently the scene of a
revolutionary new development in
accelerators—a multi-billion-volt
superconducting linear
accelerator.
The next lecture in the series,
entitled "Lasers—An Example of
the Long Road From Idea to
Usefulness," will be given by
Arthur L. Schawlow, Professor of
Physics and Executive Head of the
Department of Physics, on
Tuesday, November 18.

The hit attraction of the past
three Stanford Summer Festivals
of the Arts, the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band from New Orleans, will
return to Palo Alto to give five (5)
benefit performances Tuesday,
October 21 through Saturday,
October 25 under the sponsorship
of the Sertoma Club of Palo Alto.

All five performances will be
given in the Cubberley High
School Pavilion, 4000 Middlefield
Road, Palo Alto and all will begin
at 8:30 p.m.
Tickets for the Palo Alto
performances are priced at $4.00
and $3.00 with all proceeds going
to area charities working in the
field of mental health. Tickets
may be purchased at the door or
in advance through a number of
cooperating merchants in the Palo
Alto area. For the ticket location
nearest you call Jerry's Store for
Men in Menlo Park; 322-3735.

The New University Conference
(NUC) will hold its first meeting
tonight at 8:00 in TMU 270.
Professor Harold L. Kahn of
the History Department, interim
chairman of the group,
emphasized that the group would
concentrate on discussion which
leads to appropriate action, and
not become a "liberal forum for
debate."
NUC will address itself to
academic issues on and off
campus. It will encourage the
formation of radical caucuses
within the existing disciplines.

Students returning from
Stanford in Germany were
enthusiastic about the charms of
their foreign campus and their

Tonight at 8:30 in TMU, the
German campus will present the
last lecture in the series of
Overseas Campus Week. Slides will
be shown and former students
from the campus will be there to
discuss and answer questions.

The New University Conference
(NUC) will hold its first meeting
tonight at 8:00 in TMU 270.
Professor Harold L. Kahn of
the History Department, interim
chairman of the group,
emphasized that the group would
concentrate on discussion which
leads to appropriate action, and
not become a "liberal forum for
debate."
NUC will address itself to
academic issues on and off
campus. It will encourage the
formation of radical caucuses
within the existing disciplines.

Students returning from
Stanford in Germany were
enthusiastic about the charms of
their foreign campus and their
experiences there.
Tonight at 8:30 in TMU, the
German campus will present the
last lecture in the series of
Overseas Campus Week. Slides will
be shown and former students
from the campus will be there to
discuss and answer questions.
Nobel Laureate Robert
Hofstadter will speak on
"Discovery and Consequences—A
Personal Experience" tomorrow
in Room 100 of the Physics
lecture Hall.
His lecture is the first in a
series of six lectures titled
"Physics and Man." The lectures
are sponsored by the Department
of Physics and the Committee on
Public Exercises.
Prof. Hofstadter, who heads
the High Energy Physics
Laboratory, will discuss some of
his early research work and its
subsequent benefits to man. His
lecture is entitled "Discovery and
Consequences—A Personal
Experience." It will be open to
the public.
The Stanford physicist shared
the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics
for his precise measurements of
atomic nuclei using the
billion-volt Mark 111 accelerator in
the laboratory he now directs. It
is currently the scene of a
revolutionary new development in
accelerators—a multi-billion-volt
superconducting linear
accelerator.
The next lecture in the series,
entitled "Lasers—An Example of
the Long Road From Idea to
Usefulness," will be given by
Arthur L. Schawlow, Professor of
Physics and Executive Head of the
Department of Physics, on
Tuesday, November 18.
