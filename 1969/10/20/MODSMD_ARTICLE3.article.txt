# Panels Focus On Third World
## 
### JUDY BIRK 
"There is only one thing [the
Africans] want from the
West —those machines," Stanford's
black anthropologist St. Clair
Drake told a panel discussion
group here Saturday afternoon.
His remarks came during the
Graduate Student Association's
conference on "Technology and
the Third World."
In one of eight such panel
discussions, Stanford political
scientist Robert North spoke of
technology as a potentially
disruptive aspect of a culture.
North stated that a change in
the tools or skills of a people
challenges their old culture and
may cause societal dislocation if
the technology changes faster
than the institutions of society.
Viewing technology as a
neutral influence, North said it
can be used constructively or
destructively. In his analysis, the
contollers of technology hold
power over the Third World.

In meeting the problem of
controlling the effects of rapid
technological development in the
Third World, North suggested that
we must learn more quickly from
past mistakes, and that we
improve simulation and
experimentation techniques in
testing new machinery.
"We need to intervene in the
process of technological
development," stated North.
North concluded that
beneficial infusion of new
technology into under-developed
countries requires planning, social
invention, and development of
institutions within the Third
World.
"Fourth World" Countries
St. Clair Drake commented on
whether or not an
under-developed people accept
the values of a developed country
when they accept its technology.
He defined under-developed
countries in terms of a "third"
and a "fourth" world.
Third World countries,
according to Drake, are those of
Latin America and South East
Asia having economic systems

which are stratified into a landed
class and landless peasants The
sub-Sahara countries of Africa
comprise the "Fourth World."
Drake asserted that whether
Africa develops technologically or
not depends primarily upon the
U.S., Britain, and the U.S.S.R.
"Culture shapes the economic and
technological development of a
country," said Drake.
Revolution in Agriculture
The major consensus of
Saturday's panel on agriculture in
the Third World was that the
existing agricultural system
cannot accomodate a fundamental
change in land ownership, a
change which is vital to improving
the economic state of the Third
World.
In another panel discussion
group, a San Jose State economist
stated that multi-national
corporations prevent the
development of integrated
economies in the Third World.
Speaking on the effect of
multi-national corporations,
James O'Connor claimed that
more developed countries, like the
United States and the Soviet
Union, keep the less developed
countries poor. Economic
progress in the Third World is
greatly hindered by the fact that
these under-developed nations are
unable to integrate the
agricultural and industrial spheres
of their economies, according to
O'Connor.
No Conscious Conspiracy
O'Connor rejected the notion
that there is necessarily a
conscious conspiracy of
international businessmen.
"There doesn't have to be a
bad guy to make a lot of people
suffer," he said. "We are talking
about the fact that when all these
companies are pursuing their
accumulated profit, the interests
of the poor people are not being
served."
Steve Weissman, former
Stanford student and a present
member of the radical Pacific
Studies Center, noted that
multi-national corporations can
exert an overwhelming force upon
a country by withholding large

amounts of investment. He
acknowledged, however, that
U.S.-based multi-national
corporations may not directly
alter American foreign policy.
"In the short run," Weissman
claimed, "the under-developed
state can be independent. But in
the long run, I think it is naive to
believe that the state can hold out
against a group that can hold out
as much as $1 billion in
investment."
Panel Capitalist
Stating that O'Connor and
Weissman's analysis was "so much
bunk," Peter Deitz, Vice President
of Palo Alto-based Data
Technology, defended the
capitalist system and foreign
investment.
Deitz declared that capitalism
is the most constructive force at
work in the Third World. The
direct benefits of multi-national
corporations as stated by Deitz
are: a massive infusion of money
into the economy, a more stable
monetary system resulting from
employment increases and
consequent increases in consumer
purchasing power, and better
communications systems.
Summarizing the positive
effects of capitalism, Deitz
pointed out that the system is
characterized by self-criticism,
open communication,
people-orientation, and
change-orientation.

are: a massive infusion of money
into the economy, a more stable
monetary system resulting from
employment increases and
consequent increases in consumer
purchasing power, and better
communications systems.
Summarizing the positive
effects of capitalism, Deitz
pointed out that the system is

change-orientation.
"There is only one thing [the
Africans] want from the
West —those machines," Stanford's
black anthropologist St. Clair
Drake told a panel discussion
group here Saturday afternoon.
His remarks came during the
Graduate Student Association's
conference on "Technology and
the Third World."
In one of eight such panel
discussions, Stanford political
scientist Robert North spoke of
technology as a potentially
disruptive aspect of a culture.
North stated that a change in
the tools or skills of a people
challenges their old culture and
may cause societal dislocation if
the technology changes faster
than the institutions of society.
Viewing technology as a
neutral influence, North said it
can be used constructively or
destructively. In his analysis, the
contollers of technology hold
power over the Third World.
Learn Q uickly
In meeting the problem of
controlling the effects of rapid
technological development in the
Third World, North suggested that
we must learn more quickly from
past mistakes, and that we
improve simulation and
experimentation techniques in
testing new machinery.
"We need to intervene in the
process of technological
development," stated North.
North concluded that
beneficial infusion of new
technology into under-developed
countries requires planning, social
invention, and development of
institutions within the Third
World.
"Fourth World" Countries
St. Clair Drake commented on
whether or not an
under-developed people accept
the values of a developed country
when they accept its technology.
He defined under-developed
countries in terms of a "third"
and a "fourth" world.
Third World countries,
according to Drake, are those of
Latin America and South East
Asia having economic systems

which are stratified into a landed
class and landless peasants The
sub-Sahara countries of Africa
comprise the "Fourth World."
Drake asserted that whether
Africa develops technologically or
not depends primarily upon the
U.S., Britain, and the U.S.S.R.
"Culture shapes the economic and
technological development of a
country," said Drake.
Revolution in Agriculture
The major consensus of
Saturday's panel on agriculture in
the Third World was that the
existing agricultural system
cannot accomodate a fundamental
change in land ownership, a
change which is vital to improving
the economic state of the Third
World.
In another panel discussion
group, a San Jose State economist
stated that multi-national
corporations prevent the
development of integrated
economies in the Third World.
Speaking on the effect of
multi-national corporations,
James O'Connor claimed that
more developed countries, like the
United States and the Soviet
Union, keep the less developed
countries poor. Economic
progress in the Third World is
greatly hindered by the fact that
these under-developed nations are
unable to integrate the
agricultural and industrial spheres
of their economies, according to
O'Connor.
No Conscious Conspiracy
O'Connor rejected the notion
that there is necessarily a
conscious conspiracy of
international businessmen.
"There doesn't have to be a
bad guy to make a lot of people
suffer," he said. "We are talking
about the fact that when all these
companies are pursuing their
accumulated profit, the interests
of the poor people are not being
served."
Steve Weissman, former
Stanford student and a present
member of the radical Pacific
Studies Center, noted that
multi-national corporations can
exert an overwhelming force upon
a country by withholding large

amounts of investment. He
acknowledged, however, that
U.S.-based multi-national
corporations may not directly
alter American foreign policy.
"In the short run," Weissman
claimed, "the under-developed
state can be independent. But in
the long run, I think it is naive to
believe that the state can hold out
against a group that can hold out
as much as $1 billion in
investment."
Panel Capitalist
Stating that O'Connor and
Weissman's analysis was "so much
bunk," Peter Deitz, Vice President
of Palo Alto-based Data
Technology, defended the
capitalist system and foreign
investment.
Deitz declared that capitalism
is the most constructive force at
work in the Third World. The
direct benefits of multi-national
corporations as stated by Deitz
are: a massive infusion of money
into the economy, a more stable
monetary system resulting from
employment increases and
consequent increases in consumer
purchasing power, and better

Stating that O'Connor and
Weissman's analysis was "so much
bunk," Peter Deitz, Vice President
of Palo Alto-based Data
Technology, defended the
capitalist system and foreign
investment.
Deitz declared that capitalism
is the most constructive force at
work in the Third World. The
direct benefits of multi-national
corporations as stated by Deitz
are: a massive infusion of money
into the economy, a more stable
monetary system resulting from
employment increases and
consequent increases in consumer
purchasing power, and better
communications systems.
Summarizing the positive
effects of capitalism, Deitz
pointed out that the system is
characterized by self-criticism,
open communication,
people-orientation, and
change-orientation.
"There is only one thing [the
Africans] want from the
West —those machines," Stanford's
black anthropologist St. Clair
Drake told a panel discussion
group here Saturday afternoon.
His remarks came during the
Graduate Student Association's
conference on "Technology and
the Third World."
In one of eight such panel
discussions, Stanford political
scientist Robert North spoke of
technology as a potentially
disruptive aspect of a culture.
North stated that a change in
the tools or skills of a people
challenges their old culture and
may cause societal dislocation if
the technology changes faster
than the institutions of society.
Viewing technology as a
neutral influence, North said it
can be used constructively or
destructively. In his analysis, the
contollers of technology hold
power over the Third World.
Learn Q uickly
In meeting the problem of
controlling the effects of rapid
technological development in the
Third World, North suggested that
we must learn more quickly from
past mistakes, and that we
improve simulation and
experimentation techniques in
testing new machinery.
"We need to intervene in the
process of technological
development," stated North.
North concluded that
beneficial infusion of new
technology into under-developed
countries requires planning, social
invention, and development of
institutions within the Third
World.
"Fourth World" Countries
St. Clair Drake commented on
whether or not an
under-developed people accept
the values of a developed country
when they accept its technology.
He defined under-developed
countries in terms of a "third"
and a "fourth" world.
Third World countries,
according to Drake, are those of
Latin America and South East
Asia having economic systems

which are stratified into a landed
class and landless peasants The
sub-Sahara countries of Africa
comprise the "Fourth World."
Drake asserted that whether
Africa develops technologically or
not depends primarily upon the
U.S., Britain, and the U.S.S.R.
"Culture shapes the economic and
technological development of a
country," said Drake.
Revolution in Agriculture
The major consensus of
Saturday's panel on agriculture in
the Third World was that the
existing agricultural system
cannot accomodate a fundamental
change in land ownership, a
change which is vital to improving
the economic state of the Third
World.
In another panel discussion
group, a San Jose State economist
stated that multi-national
corporations prevent the
development of integrated
economies in the Third World.
Speaking on the effect of
multi-national corporations,
James O'Connor claimed that
more developed countries, like the
United States and the Soviet
Union, keep the less developed
countries poor. Economic
progress in the Third World is
greatly hindered by the fact that
these under-developed nations are
unable to integrate the
agricultural and industrial spheres
of their economies, according to
O'Connor.
No Conscious Conspiracy
O'Connor rejected the notion
that there is necessarily a
conscious conspiracy of
international businessmen.
"There doesn't have to be a
bad guy to make a lot of people
suffer," he said. "We are talking
about the fact that when all these
companies are pursuing their
accumulated profit, the interests
of the poor people are not being
served."
Steve Weissman, former
Stanford student and a present
member of the radical Pacific
Studies Center, noted that
multi-national corporations can
exert an overwhelming force upon
a country by withholding large

amounts of investment. He
acknowledged, however, that
U.S.-based multi-national
corporations may not directly
alter American foreign policy.
"In the short run," Weissman
claimed, "the under-developed
state can be independent. But in
the long run, I think it is naive to
believe that the state can hold out
against a group that can hold out
as much as $1 billion in
investment."
Panel Capitalist
Stating that O'Connor and
Weissman's analysis was "so much
bunk," Peter Deitz, Vice President
of Palo Alto-based Data
Technology, defended the
capitalist system and foreign
investment.
Deitz declared that capitalism
is the most constructive force at
work in the Third World. The
