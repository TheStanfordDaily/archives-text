# Population Meeting Forecasts Starvation

Stanford biologist Paul R.
Ehrlich, addressing more than
1200 high school students, said
Saturday that man is incessently
raping his environment, mainly
through overpopulation and
warfare.
"You are living in a society
which pretends to care about its
children, but is actually more
concerned about continued
growth of the gross national
product," Ehrlich told the
students, who came from 85
Northern California high schools.
The theme of the conference was
Erhlich's specialty, population
biology.
"In order to keep the shining
toys pouring out of Detroit and
two television sets in every home,
we are willing to loot and kill the
entire planet," he continued.
Also speaking at the
conference were the Rt. Rev. J.
Kilmer Meyers, bishop of the
Episcopal Diocese of California;
folksinger Pete Seeger; Rep. Paul
N. McCloskey (R-Portola Valley);
and Stanford President Kenneth
Pitzer.
Criticizes CBW
Ehrlich added that the "world
situation of diminishing
resources" is increasing tensions
among countries. The developed
countries of the world maintain a
strong base of military and
political power in the third world
in order to assure themselves of a
supply of raw materials.
He criticized his "pygmy
colleagues" who are working on
chemical and biological warfare,
and outlined what biological
warfare or a nuclear holocaust
could do to our planet.
Ehrlich stressed that the earth
could not possibly be "restored to
normal in about 20 years after a
nuclear disasterâ€”don't you believe
it."

He mentioned rumors of a
pneumonic rabies strain that
could be spread among humans by
a cough or sneeze, and could wipe
out the human race "except for
those few who have had rabies
inoculations."
DDT Kills Seas
Even in the Bay Area, some
effects of pollution are evident
over the past ten years. He cited
the examples of smog and the
"attack on plant systems," which
he considers to be the worst
example of environmental
deterioration.
Even if we stopped using DDT
today, commented Ehrlich, we
could still turn the sea into a dead
body of water in 15 years. This
would result in a lack of oxygen,
plant life, and 20 percent of the
world's protein. Massive starvation
would result.
Ehrlich closed his speech with
a word of hope and some
