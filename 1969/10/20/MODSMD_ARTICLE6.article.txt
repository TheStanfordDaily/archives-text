urged students to become aware
of all sides of these problems; "be
a generalist." He warned them not

"You can listen to religious
leaders who will tell you that
mechanically preventing sperm

"You can even listen to the
politicians who will tell you that

President Pitzer, who also

Ehrlich also challenged the
