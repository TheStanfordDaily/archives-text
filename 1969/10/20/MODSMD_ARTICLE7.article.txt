## Agnew Blasts M-Day 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP)-Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew Sunday
voiced the administration's
harshest criticism yet of last
Wednesday's Vietnam
Moratorium, saying such protests
are being pressed by hard-core
dissidents and professional
anarchists.
Speaking at a testimonial
dinner here, Agnew said American
views on the war are being greatly
distorted.

He added: "The recent
Vietnam Moratorium is a
reflection of the confusion that
exists in America today.
Thousands of well-motivated
young people, conditioned since
childhood to respond to great
emotional appeals, saw fit to
demonstrate for peace.
"Most did not stop to consider
that the leaders of the
Moratorium had billed it as a
massive public outpouring of
sentiment against the foreign
policy of the President of the
United States," he said.
Agnew said the only purpose
the Moratorium served was "as an
emotional purgative for those who
feel the need to cleanse
themselves of their lack of ability
to offer a constructive solution to
the problem.
The Vice President said the
Nixon administration is working
to end the war and said the
criticism of anti-war factions is
not justified. He repeated a list of
signs which the administration
says indicate progress in the war.
About 20 peace demonstrators
wearing hippie garb turned out for
the arrival of the Vice President
and Mrs. Agnew at New Orleans
International Airport.
The demonstrators threw
flowers under Agnew's car as it
was being driven away.
