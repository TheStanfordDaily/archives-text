WASHINGTON
(AP)â€”President Nixon may offer
the enemy an American-initiated
cease fire proposal when he
addresses the nation on Vietnam
next month, it was learned
Sunday.
Nixon is weighing
recommendations from some
advisers that American forces in
the war zone hold their fire unless
fired upon.
One White House source
indicated Nixon's television-radio
address scheduled for Nov. 3
would be the logical occasion for
him to either announce a
unilateral cease fire or, by making
no mention of it, signal that the
idea had been rejected.
Newsweek magazine said in its
latest edition that Nixon's
military advisers have been urging
him to declare an immediate and
unilateral cease-fire in Vietnam so
any enemy violations could be
used "as evidence of the enemy's
reluctance to end the war."
The magazine added in its
Periscope section of the Oct. 27
edition that the Pentagon now
thinks even a unilateral cease-fire
"would create no great risk to
U.S. troops in the field."
Meanwhile, Sen. Charles E.
Goodell, R-N.Y., defending his

proposal for a total U.S. troop
withdrawal from Vietnam by
December, 1970, said Sunday
night it is time the South
Vietnamese governmental leaders
are told "you have to shape up,
we are shipping out."
Appearing on the National
Educational Television program
"The Advocates," Goodell said
the members of Congress "must
stand up and bear our share of the
responsibility to get out of
Vietnam."
In a filmed segment, Sen. Barry
Goldwater, R-Ariz., said he
opposed Goodell's resolution and
supports the Nixon
administration's policy and is
hopeful "we can achieve peace at
Paris."
However, Goldwater added, "I
have my own program" that
would give the Paris peace
negotiators until a certain date to
come to some conclusions or the
United States would resume
bombing in the North and include
non-military targets.
He said if the President "made
this threat to Hanoi, they would
sue for peace very quickly."
