NEW YORK (AP)-Tiine
magazine said Sunday that a
14-member panel sponsored by
the federal government has
recommended to the Nixon
administration a relaxation of
laws dealing with homosexuality.
According to Time, the panel's
report calls on the states to
abolish laws making homosexual
relations between consenting
adults in private a crime. This has
been done in Great Britain.
It also recommends that the
government and private employers
"reassess their current standards
and implies that they should hire
homosexuals who can pass normal
screening procedures," the
magazine said.
The panel's report was said also
to call for establishment of a
"major U.S. center for the study
of sexualityâ€”from sex patterns in
animals to all kinds of normal and
abnormal human sexual behavior.
In addition, teachers and youth
groups counselors should be
better informed about
homosexuality so that they can
help rather than heckle the young
and law officers should be given
facts to set against their irrational
feelings."
The panel was headed by
Evelyn Hooker, a psychologist, of
the University of California at Los
An geles.
