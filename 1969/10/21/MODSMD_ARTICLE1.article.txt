# SF Rally Set For November
## 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
Barely a week has passed since
the first Vietnam Moratorium
Day, but plans for November
protests are already being
formulated.
November 13 and 14 are the
days designated for the next
Moratorium by the National
Vietnam Moratorium Committee.
On these days, Stanford
Moratorium intends to continue
and expand its October
operations, moving into more
distant communities for
canvassing and encouraging
businesses to close down.
Several other anti-war
demonstrations are also scheduled
for November. The New
Mobilization Committee to End
the War in Vietnam has planned
mass marches and rallies in San
Francisco and Washington, D.C.
And the Student Mobilization is
planning similar activities in
Chicago.
The program for San Francisco
on the 15th is intended "to bring
together both the cultural and
political protest," according to
Terence Hallinan, West Coast
Co-Chairman of the New
Mobilization.
Speakers will include Dolores
Huerta, Ralph Abernathy, and
possibly Senator Charles Goodell.

Among the entertainers will be
Buffy Sainte-Marie and PhilOchs.
The New Mobilization is hoping
to have a quarter of a million
people march from Kimble Park
to the Polo Grounds from a 2
p.m. rally on the 15th.
The American Friends Services
Committee has also scheduled a
mass protest for Washington, D.C.
Beginning on Thursday evening,
November 13, marchers will file
through he Capitol and past the
White House. Each marcher will
bear the name of one of the more
than 40,000 American soldiers
killed in Vietnam,
The relationship and degree of
cooperation between the various
war protests is still unclear. The
National Moratorium Committee
will announce its policy toward
the November 15 marches in a
press conference this morning.
Stanford Moratorium has not
yet determined its activities for
the 15th. Its main concern at
present is to build a stronger, and
lasting, organization. One step
toward this is a Moratorium
newspaper, tentatively titled the
Peace-Monger. The Peace-Monger
will be a weekly tabloid devoted
entirely to the war issue. The first
issue is scheduled for next week.
