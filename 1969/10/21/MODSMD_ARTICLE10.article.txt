# Letters to the Editor
## SDS 'Lies and Propaganda' 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have just finished reading
SDS's latest production, Maggie's
Farm. Like most SDS propaganda,
it is filled with distortions,
inaccuracies, and innuendos.
Some of these might be attributed
to naivete—other to malevolence.
For instance, on page 30 SDS
claims that SRI developed the
nozzle which malfunctioned to
kill 6,000 sheep in Dugway, Utah,
and that SRI developed the
techniques which were used in
tear-gassing the Cal campus last
year from a helicopter. When
pressed last year, Mike Sweeney
(now of Chaparral) admitted than
in fact he had no documentation
or proof that SRl's nozzle was in
fact the one which malfunctioned
or that SRl's techniques were in
fact the ones used in Berkeley.
In an outright lie, SDS claims
that Business School professor
Ezra Solomon "did a very
professional cost-benefit analysis
for the Trustees, recommending
along with Provost Lyman that
SRI be sold without restrictions."
Ezra Solomon voted with the
majority that recommended sale
with restrictions, and
furthermore, the cost-benefit
analysis presented by the SRI
Study Committee was anything
but professional.
The list continues The only
thing a student can do is look into
these questions for himself, and
hope that next time SDS comes
out with a publication it will do a
more solid job.

• Balcony Sex
Editor, THE DAILY:
Sunday night, I had the
privilege of seeing (not hearing)
Rachael. Hachael in Mem Aud.
The show began with a silent
Laurel and Hardy film. Within
two minutes, the whole balcony,
which must have been composed
entirely of male students, was
providing the sound track. Loud
wisecracks and very basic sound
effects filled the auditorium.
Rachael, Rachael started with
sound, but nothing changed.
Throughout the film, there were
funny observations and foul
comments, liberally interspersed
with obscenities.
After much thought and
investigation, 1 have come to some
startling conclusions on this
balcony behavior. The common
problem of all these male students
is very basic: sex. From the time
they find themselves all massed
together in the balcony without
any girls, to the time they exit
from Mem Aud to find Hoover
Tower pointing large and straight
into the sky, they are reminded of
sex. They are bonded together by
their knowledge of their own
sexual inadequacy compounded
by the frustrating horniness
arising from the off-balance 2:1
ratio. Hoping to find in numbers
I lie masculine power they seek so
desperately, they huddle together
high in the balcony, just as the
male spider monkey of Borneo
climbs tall trees during the mating
season to display it.self in a
physically superior position. Thev

attempt to attract females who

• 'Omn Matt'
Editor, THE DAILY:
C'mon Matt, I find it hard to
believe that Stanford is all that
bad! Last year, I, too, was one of
those kids who had just left "old,
real friends and honest
relationships," but I could hardly
say that I entered "an artificial,
plastic, superficial Stanford."
Sure, there's bound to be some
people with perpetual 'smiles'
plastered on their faces, but to
label all of us as phonies is not
really very fair.
As for the "dollies" or
"women"—as you seem so
reluctant to call them—being the
epitomy of our "total plasticity,"
may I say that was a definite
affront to my personal integrity?
There's nothing wrong with
Stanford women, be they frosh or
seniors. This fallacy of the dolly
who is dated up for eight weeks in
advance is a fallacy. So many girls
end up spending their weekends at
the UCtLY because someone
thought they would be too busy
to go out.
Take a look around, Matt;
there are some pretty cool girls in
this place. Stanford men are some
of the best you'll find anywhere,
and though this might be a bitter
pill to swallow, my dear friend, so
are the Stanford women.

Editor, THE DAILY:
C'mon Matt, I find it hard to
believe that Stanford is all that
bad! Last year, I, too, was one of
those kids who had just left "old,
real friends and honest
relationships," but I could hardly
say that I entered "an artificial,
plastic, superficial Stanford."
Sure, there's bound to be some
people with perpetual 'smiles'
plastered on their faces, but to
label all of us as phonies is not
really very fair.
As for the "dollies" or
"women"—as you seem so
reluctant to call them—being the
epitomy of our "total plasticity,"
may I say that was a definite
affront to my personal integrity?
There's nothing wrong with
Stanford women, be they frosh or
seniors. This fallacy of the dolly
who is dated up for eight weeks in
advance is a fallacy. So many girls
end up spending their weekends at
the UCtLY because someone
thought they would be too busy
to go out.
Take a look around, Matt;
there are some pretty cool girls in
this place. Stanford men are some
of the best you'll find anywhere,
and though this might be a bitter
pill to swallow, my dear friend, so
are the Stanford women.

I have just finished reading
SDS's latest production, Maggie's
Farm. Like most SDS propaganda,
it is filled with distortions,
inaccuracies, and innuendos.
Some of these might be attributed
to naivete—other to malevolence.
For instance, on page 30 SDS
claims that SRI developed the
nozzle which malfunctioned to
kill 6,000 sheep in Dugway, Utah,
and that SRI developed the
techniques which were used in
tear-gassing the Cal campus last
year from a helicopter. When
pressed last year, Mike Sweeney
(now of Chaparral) admitted than
in fact he had no documentation
or proof that SRl's nozzle was in
fact the one which malfunctioned
or that SRl's techniques were in
fact the ones used in Berkeley.
In an outright lie, SDS claims
that Business School professor
Ezra Solomon "did a very
professional cost-benefit analysis
for the Trustees, recommending
along with Provost Lyman that
SRI be sold without restrictions."
Ezra Solomon voted with the
majority that recommended sale
with restrictions, and
furthermore, the cost-benefit
analysis presented by the SRI
Study Committee was anything
but professional.
The list continues The only
thing a student can do is look into
these questions for himself, and
hope that next time SDS comes
out with a publication it will do a
