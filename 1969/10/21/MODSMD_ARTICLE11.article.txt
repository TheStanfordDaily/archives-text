# Moratorium a 'Hoax'
## Oct. 15 and Communists 
### 
(The following is an open letter
from Campus Counterattack, U.S.
Anti-Communist Congress, Inc., a
non-profit organization based in
Washington, D C.)
It is important for all
concerned Americans, and
particularly the academic
communities, to understand the
true nature and purpose of the
October 15 "moratorium" and
November "peace marches" called
by Dave Dellinger & Company.
First, who is Dave Dellinger? A
self-avowed Communist (I am a
communist but not the
Soviet-type communist"—Del
linger, statement to press,
Washington, D.C.) convicted
homosexual (N.Y. City, July 11,
1949) twice convicted criminal
(one year term and 2 year term, 3
years total in Federal
penitentiary) and associated with
no less than eight citsd
communist front organizations. IS
THIS THE KIND OF A MAN

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
ASKED TO FOLLOW?
The Dellinger demonstrations
are NOT serving the cause of
peace; they are serving the cause
of Communist victory for the Red
Vietcong—not because the U.S.
Anti-Communist Congress says so,
BUT BECAUSE THE
COMMUNISTS SAY THEY ARE.
In a cablegram to Communist
traitors in America last month
(September) the North Vietnam
dictatorship thanked their
"comrades" in America for "the
support of American
Communists," and said that this
support "constitutes a positive
contribution to the defeat of the
U.S. "imperialists". The

cablegram said that such support
"strongly encourages our people
in their struggle".
Moratorium for War
Although there are many
confused people, including a few
sincere pacifists, who have let
their names be used, THE
LEADERS of the so-called
"moratorium" are not anti-war;
they are FOR WARS OF
AGGRESSION WAGED BY THE
COMMUNISTS ALL OVER THE
WORLD. These leaders defend the
Soviet invasion of Hungary 12
years ago, they defend the Red
slaughter of Polish workers at
Poznan; they defend the
Communist crushing of freedom

in Czechoslovakia; and they
defend and support Soviet and
Communist aggression in South
Vietnam. We repeat; the leaders
are NOT FOR PEACE-THEY
ARE FOR WARS WAGED BY
THE COMMUNITST. The only
"war" they are against is any
action taken to defend people and
nations from communist death
and dictatorship.
IF the cynical leaders were in
fact against AI,I, war, they would
demonstrate against the Soviet
Union; they would demonstrate
against the Vletcong; they would
demonstrate at the Soviet
Embassy against the invasion and
continued occupation of
Czechoslovakia by Soviet troops;
they would demonstrate against
the Red Army, while at the same
time they demonstrate against
America and against
anti-communist nations and
individuals. The simple,
undeniable fact that they do one,
and not the other, is proof that
the entire "moratorium" and
alleged "peace" marches re a
sordid, corrupt, massive fraud.
Reject "Hoax"
WE THEREFORE CALL
UPON THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE, and in particular the
academic communities, to reject
the "moratorium" hoax. We call
upon the American people and
the academic community to go on
the attack against Communism
and the tools of communism,
because communism is wrong.
There may be some faults in
America, or in South Vietnam, or
in other parts of the free
world—but COMMUNISM IS
WORSE. If you don't believe it,
ask any victim of Communist
tyranny, torture and terror.
Vietnam is Communism's
War—not Nixon's war. Hence,
peace and freedom will NOT
come to pass in South Vietnam if
we stop fighting; ONLY THE
COMMUNISTS CAN STOP THE
WAR.

BUT BECAUSE THE
COMMUNISTS SAY THEY ARE.
In a cablegram to Communist
traitors in America last month
(September) the North Vietnam
dictatorship thanked their
"comrades" in America for "the
support of American
Communists," and said that this
support "constitutes a positive
contribution to the defeat of the
U.S. "imperialists". The

cablegram said that such support
"strongly encourages our people
in their struggle".
Moratorium for War
Although there are many
confused people, including a few
sincere pacifists, who have let
their names be used, THE
LEADERS of the so-called
"moratorium" are not anti-war;
they are FOR WARS OF
AGGRESSION WAGED BY THE
COMMUNISTS ALL OVER THE
WORLD. These leaders defend the
Soviet invasion of Hungary 12
years ago, they defend the Red
slaughter of Polish workers at
Poznan; they defend the
Communist crushing of freedom

in Czechoslovakia; and they
defend and support Soviet and
Communist aggression in South
Vietnam. We repeat; the leaders
are NOT FOR PEACE-THEY
ARE FOR WARS WAGED BY
THE COMMUNITST. The only
"war" they are against is any
action taken to defend people and
nations from communist death
and dictatorship.
IF the cynical leaders were in
fact against AI,I, war, they would
demonstrate against the Soviet
Union; they would demonstrate
against the Vletcong; they would
demonstrate at the Soviet
Embassy against the invasion and
continued occupation of
Czechoslovakia by Soviet troops;
they would demonstrate against
the Red Army, while at the same
time they demonstrate against
America and against
anti-communist nations and
individuals. The simple,
undeniable fact that they do one,
and not the other, is proof that
the entire "moratorium" and
alleged "peace" marches re a
sordid, corrupt, massive fraud.
Reject "Hoax"
WE THEREFORE CALL
UPON THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE, and in particular the
academic communities, to reject
the "moratorium" hoax. We call
upon the American people and
the academic community to go on
the attack against Communism
and the tools of communism,
because communism is wrong.
There may be some faults in
America, or in South Vietnam, or
in other parts of the free
world—but COMMUNISM IS
WORSE. If you don't believe it,
ask any victim of Communist
tyranny, torture and terror.
Vietnam is Communism's
War—not Nixon's war. Hence,
peace and freedom will NOT
come to pass in South Vietnam if
we stop fighting; ONLY THE
COMMUNISTS CAN STOP THE
WAR.
(The following is an open letter
from Campus Counterattack, U.S.

It is important for all
concerned Americans, and
particularly the academic
communities, to understand the
true nature and purpose of the
October 15 "moratorium" and
November "peace marches" called
by Dave Dellinger & Company.
First, who is Dave Dellinger? A
self-avowed Communist (I am a

Soviet-type communist"—Del

Washington, D.C.) convicted
homosexual (N.Y. City, July 11,
1949) twice convicted criminal
(one year term and 2 year term, 3
years total in Federal
penitentiary) and associated with
no less than eight citsd
communist front organizations. IS
THIS THE KIND OF A MAN

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
ASKED TO FOLLOW?
The Dellinger demonstrations
are NOT serving the cause of
