# War and Peace

(This poem was submitted anonymously to THE DAILY by an
elderly gentleman)
We had a Moratorium on October the fifteenth
The greatest mix of motives one has ever seen
The pacifists were moralizing they were always right,
The violent minority was spoiling for a fight,
The bitter voice of race repressed vilified us all,
One Politician trumpeted a pure party call.
The intellectually arrogant attacked our nation's heart.
Their 20/20 hindsight set them and GOP apart.
But many cause to end the war and quietly to say
"We've slowly learned there's naught to win and wish to stop the fray.
We don't condemn our leaders or hate our country flag, "
But saving foreign governments is simply not our bag.
Many people don't hold dear the freedom that we do.
Their aims to eat, to reproduce and do what they can do.
Such humble aims we don't condemn, but still we recognize
That strong and honest governments don't drop from the skies.
For sure our sons have fought and died, but surely not in vain.
The once Red World is split in half and maybe split again.
Twenty years of ring of steel and willingness to fight
Has turned back all adventures while Peace was still in sight.
But now we've overdone it as humans often will.
Defending Asian heart land is not worth the bill.
So let's stop all the moral tripe and "coil military. "
Without would law we can't rely on Cinderella's Fairy.
Let's simply say we've kept our trust if ever once committed,
And let's withdraw, our heads held high, our duty now acquitted.
No longer can we waste our time listening to the jerks
Who hopped the "no war" band wagon to sanctify their quirks.
No peace seeker will grivel an axe except the one for peace;
So let's have faith, stive for a halt and let the hate decrease.
