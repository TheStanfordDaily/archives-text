## Race and Intelligence 
### Joshua Lederberg 
Professor Arthur R Jensen, of
the University of California,
Berkeley, has provoked wide
controversy by his assertion that
racial differences in academic
achievement are based on genetic
differences in intelligence. This
controversy has, in part, arisen
from what I believe to be a
misinterpretation of Dr. Jensen's
assertions, often from a failure of
popular commentators to heed
the cautions that Dr. Jensen
himself has attached to some of
his speculations. In particular, he
has himself remarked that "High
heritability by itself does not
necessarily imply that the
characteristic is immutable. Under
greatly changed environmental
conditions, the heritability may
have some other value, or it may
remain the same while the mean
of the population changes."
This remark is however
counterbalanced by the
contradictory stress that Jensen
has placed on the futility of
compensatory education, and on
the utility of the I.CJ. as a measure
of biological competence. This
leaves some uncertainty about
whether Dr. Jensen subscribes to
"Jensenism," a popular exposition
of his writings, such as appeared
in an article by Lee Edson in he
New York Times Magazine for
August 31, 1969.
My criticisms, which follow,
are directed to "Jensenism".
Questions Raiscd
Out of many complex and
intertwined questions raised by
Jensenism, I extract two for
separate discussion: 1 ) is the
difference in average
"intelligence" scores between
races mainly hereditary? and 2) if
so, what if any pragmatic meaning
would this have?
The arguments that Jensen has
assembled for hereditary factors

in the variation of intelligence
within populations of white
Englishmen and Americans have
been discussed and accepted by
geneticists for at least 40 years.
The novelty of Jensen's discussion
is mainly that he is a psychologist,
and most educators and
psychologists have rejected or
been unaware of genetic research
on human behavior. In this, they
were not altogether unwise, for
our methods of genetic research in
this field are so feeble that it is
misleading to report these results
under a photomicrograph of
chromosomes. This could only
have been intended to convey a
flavor of experimental rigor which
human behavioral genetics is a
long way from approaching. For
precisely that reason I must
commend that part of Jensen's
exposition that encourages further
research, although I see much less
hope for useful answers from
these statistical studies than is
offered by laboratory experiments
on brain development and
function.
Jensen himself pointed out
that conclusions about the
heritability of intelligence, from
adoptions and separated twins
within a white culture, could not
fairly be transferred to the
variation between races. That
racial groups might have
hereditary differences in
intelligence is a perfectly plausible
speculation. But until the
manifest environmental factors
are correctly controlled or
assessed, any assertion about
whose genes score highest in pure
prejudice.
Dr. Jensen would not, I
believe, disagree with these
remarks; but he then adds that he
has found consistently poorer
performance of black compared
to white groups whose

"socio-economic conditions were
controlled" so as to assure
comparable environments. This
control is crucial to Jensen's
approach to these studies. In'lie
end, however, it can only relfect a
subjective judgment about which
socio-economic (not to mention
cultural) factors are most
important for intellectual
development. Can anyone
measure the total impact of being
black in a white-dominated
world? Can we say that
environmental influences have
been controlled, in the face of the
knowledge that the trends of
infant mortality and birthweight
among blacks, although
constantly improving, lag so far
behind whites?
Effect on Education
The second point is even more
important, for Mr. Edson implies
that "no amount of compensatory
education will improve this ability
(to reason abstractly) since it is
mainly inherited." This fatalism is
a vicious extrapolation of
"Jensenism" whose thrust is
contradicted by every finding of
modern biological research on
how the genes influence
development. If hypothetical
racial genes did impair
intelligence, they could operate
like diabetes or hereditary goiter
which are remediable by diet and
hormone treatment.
I would agree that effective
educational regimes are doomed
to fail if they deny the possibility
of biological as well as cultural
differences among children. I do
not agree that we know much
about racial genetic components
of those differences.
