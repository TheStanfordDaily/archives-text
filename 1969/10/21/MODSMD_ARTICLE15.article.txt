# St. Clair Drake Reviews History of Black Studies
## 
### 
Professor St. Clair Drake,
chairman of Stanford's black
studies program, discussed black
studies programs Sunday in a rare
open meeting of Stanford's Black
Student Union.
Although the meeting was
advertised as being open to all
students, the whites who attended
numbered only about ten in a
crowd of 75. They were asked to
letive at the beginning of the
meeting while the BSU discussed
official business.
After a short closed door
meeting, they were invited back
to hear Drake deliver his
hour-long history of the program.
The first period he covered was
1915 to 1950, when the Negro
history movement was rooted
mostly in the segregated schools
in the South. Drake noted that
these schools did give the students
some sense of identity, while the
integrated schools ignored the
subject completely.
It was not until 1950 that the
general white population became
interested in black studies, said
Drake. During this period,

institutions like the Ford
Foundation began issuing
individual grants for African
studies. Drake noted that he
received one of these grants.
Lily-White
In this period, the NAACP
started its movement toward
eliminating "lily-white"
textbooks. The movement worked
for texts showing that the Negro
and the lower classes were
members of the existing social
structure.
The present epoch bega in 1965
after major riots in the ghettoes
began to capture newspaper
headlines. "The year of 1965
became a turning point," Drake
told the students, "for it was in
that year that the student
movement in the North began to
burgeon."
"Non-Negotiable Demands"
Negro high school students
began to demand relevant courses,
and black college students

followed with various
presentations of "non-negotiable
demands." Basically, these
demands included calls for more
black students, more black
faculty, and the establishment of
separate black studies programs.
What made this student
movement distinct from that of
the second period, Drake
emphasized, was that it was
carried on mainly in the large
white colleges of the North, rather
than in the small Southern
colleges that were the scene of
action in the late 1950'5.
Drake spoke of the dramatic
increase in the number of black
professors in large Northern
colleges during the last few years.
Ht said that in 1941 there was
only one black professor north of
the Mason-Dixon line. At present,
there are over a dozen at Stanford
alone.
Scholar Shortage
Drake explained that there is
now a shortage of established
black scholars, since all the large
white universities are looking for
competent black historians and
sociologists to head their new
Black Studies programs.
Drake said that black
professors are making
"contributions to the basic world
culture without cutting their roots
from their people." He compared
the modern black professor to
Einstein, who, although he is most
noted for his contributions to
science, wrote widely about the
Jewish question and was a strong
supporter of the Jewish cause.
Drake emphasized that the
present year is an "experimental"
year for the Stanford Black
Studies program. As chairman of
the interdepartmental African and
Afro-American Studies program,
he will be working with black
students to try to shape a
curriculum that will be acceptable
to black students in the program.
He noted that the purpose of
the black studies major is no
different from other majors—"to
teach you something about
yourself and your world." He
explained that a black studies
major could also serve as a
springboard for graduate work in
such fields as history and
sociology.

Stanford Sailing Association will be engaged in this year. Others include bay
racing this quarter and Lake Lagunita activities during winter and spring. To join

Professor St. Clair Drake,
chairman of Stanford's black
studies program, discussed black
studies programs Sunday in a rare
open meeting of Stanford's Black
Student Union.
Although the meeting was
advertised as being open to all
students, the whites who attended
numbered only about ten in a
crowd of 75. They were asked to
letive at the beginning of the
meeting while the BSU discussed
official business.
After a short closed door
meeting, they were invited back
to hear Drake deliver his
hour-long history of the program.
The first period he covered was
1915 to 1950, when the Negro
history movement was rooted
mostly in the segregated schools
in the South. Drake noted that
these schools did give the students
some sense of identity, while the
integrated schools ignored the
subject completely.
It was not until 1950 that the
general white population became
interested in black studies, said
Drake. During this period,

institutions like the Ford
Foundation began issuing
individual grants for African
studies. Drake noted that he
received one of these grants.
Lily-White
In this period, the NAACP
started its movement toward
eliminating "lily-white"
textbooks. The movement worked
for texts showing that the Negro
and the lower classes were
members of the existing social
structure.
The present epoch bega in 1965
after major riots in the ghettoes
began to capture newspaper
headlines. "The year of 1965
became a turning point," Drake
told the students, "for it was in
that year that the student
movement in the North began to
burgeon."
"Non-Negotiable Demands"
Negro high school students
began to demand relevant courses,
and black college students

followed with various
presentations of "non-negotiable
demands." Basically, these
demands included calls for more
black students, more black
faculty, and the establishment of
separate black studies programs.
What made this student
movement distinct from that of
the second period, Drake
emphasized, was that it was
carried on mainly in the large
white colleges of the North, rather
than in the small Southern
colleges that were the scene of
action in the late 1950'5.
Drake spoke of the dramatic
increase in the number of black
professors in large Northern
colleges during the last few years.
Ht said that in 1941 there was
only one black professor north of
the Mason-Dixon line. At present,
there are over a dozen at Stanford
alone.
Scholar Shortage
Drake explained that there is
now a shortage of established
black scholars, since all the large
white universities are looking for
competent black historians and
sociologists to head their new
Black Studies programs.
Drake said that black
professors are making
"contributions to the basic world
culture without cutting their roots
from their people." He compared
the modern black professor to
Einstein, who, although he is most
noted for his contributions to
science, wrote widely about the
Jewish question and was a strong
supporter of the Jewish cause.
Drake emphasized that the
present year is an "experimental"
year for the Stanford Black
Studies program. As chairman of
the interdepartmental African and
Afro-American Studies program,
he will be working with black
students to try to shape a
curriculum that will be acceptable
to black students in the program.
He noted that the purpose of
the black studies major is no
different from other majors—"to
teach you something about
yourself and your world." He
explained that a black studies
major could also serve as a
springboard for graduate work in
such fields as history and
sociology.
