# Soviet Journalist Speaks On United States Press
## 
### 
American advertisers "as a
class" determine to a large extent
what may and may not be printed
in the American press, the Dean
of the Moscow School of
Journalism charged last Friday in
a rare session with 50 journalism
students.
Dean Yessen N. Zassoursky,
head of the Soviet Union's largest
and most prestigious school for
writers, asserted that because the
advertisers determine "the
frontiers of criticism," American
newspapers are largely "a
mouthpiece" of the advertisers.
Zassoursky, speaking fluent
English, admitted that the Soviet
press was not free to question the
basic values and assumptions of its
society. "Ideas alien to
Communism are not expressed in
our press," he told the students.
No criticism of Russian
intervention in Czechoslavakia has
been printed in the Russian press,
he said, because "J haven't yet
met a Soviet journalist who felt
our intervention was wrong."
Moratorium
In response to a question about
the Vietnam Moratorium,
Zassoursky said, "You are only
discussing the way to end the war
you lost. You are searching for a
more sane foreign policy, but you
aren't asking for a major change in
social institutions." But he
expressed hope that the
Moratorium would succeed.
When asked about how the
Soviet press was explaining the
defection of Anatoly Kuznetsov,
he confessed that he himself could
not understand Kuznetsov's
actions.
Later, in an angry reply to
comments from a Hungarian
refugee, Zassoursky said, "I don't
like these people who leave their
homelands. I dislike Anatoly
Kuznetsov."
Zassoursky was asked by
communication professor William

Rivers about the degree to which
Soviet journalists are allowed to
question authority. He explained
that while Marxism-Leninism is
not challenged, "our newspapers
do discuss insufficiencies and
ill-practices of government
officials."
Open to Criticism
I The operation of a factory or
farm, and the practical
implementation of government
policies are also open to press
criticism. "It is a Soviet
journalist's duty to ask a
government official a question on
unsolved problems," he said.
In his introductory remarks,
Zassoursky spoke of the
curriculum for the 2,600 students
in his school. Such American

writers as benjamin Franklin,
Edgar Allen Poe, Jack London,
and Theodore Dreiser are studied
in depth.
The history of the American
press is also examined.
Restrictions on the freedom of
thy press during the Civil War, the
growth of newspaper empires, the
"commercialization" of the press,
the muckraking journalists of the
20th century, and the history of
the American socialist press are
among the subjects studied by
Russia's future journalists.
Mr. Zassoursky's session with
Stanford students was part of a
coast-to-coast tour he is
conducting to study American
newspapers and visit with future
American journalists.

Open to Criticism
I The operation of a factory or
farm, and the practical
implementation of government
policies are also open to press
criticism. "It is a Soviet
journalist's duty to ask a
government official a question on
unsolved problems," he said.
In his introductory remarks,
Zassoursky spoke of the
curriculum for the 2,600 students
in his school. Such American

writers as benjamin Franklin,
Edgar Allen Poe, Jack London,
and Theodore Dreiser are studied
in depth.
The history of the American
press is also examined.
Restrictions on the freedom of
thy press during the Civil War, the
growth of newspaper empires, the
"commercialization" of the press,
the muckraking journalists of the
20th century, and the history of
the American socialist press are
among the subjects studied by
Russia's future journalists.
Mr. Zassoursky's session with
Stanford students was part of a
coast-to-coast tour he is
conducting to study American
newspapers and visit with future
American journalists.
American advertisers "as a
class" determine to a large extent
what may and may not be printed
in the American press, the Dean
of the Moscow School of
Journalism charged last Friday in
a rare session with 50 journalism
students.
Dean Yessen N. Zassoursky,
head of the Soviet Union's largest
and most prestigious school for
writers, asserted that because the
advertisers determine "the
frontiers of criticism," American
newspapers are largely "a
mouthpiece" of the advertisers.
Zassoursky, speaking fluent
English, admitted that the Soviet
press was not free to question the
basic values and assumptions of its
society. "Ideas alien to
Communism are not expressed in
our press," he told the students.
No criticism of Russian
intervention in Czechoslavakia has
been printed in the Russian press,
he said, because "J haven't yet
met a Soviet journalist who felt
our intervention was wrong."
Moratorium
In response to a question about
the Vietnam Moratorium,
Zassoursky said, "You are only
discussing the way to end the war
you lost. You are searching for a
more sane foreign policy, but you
aren't asking for a major change in
social institutions." But he
expressed hope that the
Moratorium would succeed.
When asked about how the
Soviet press was explaining the
defection of Anatoly Kuznetsov,
he confessed that he himself could
not understand Kuznetsov's
actions.
Later, in an angry reply to
comments from a Hungarian
refugee, Zassoursky said, "I don't
like these people who leave their
homelands. I dislike Anatoly
Kuznetsov."
Zassoursky was asked by
communication professor William

Rivers about the degree to which
Soviet journalists are allowed to
question authority. He explained
that while Marxism-Leninism is
not challenged, "our newspapers
do discuss insufficiencies and
ill-practices of government
officials."
