# Stanford-in-Washington
## Capitol Hill Interns Meet 
### 
While the House debated the
surtax this summer, and the
Senate voted on the crucial ABM
amendents, Stanford-in-
Washington participants were
crowding the galleries to watch.
Nearly 80 Stanford students
worked in Washington, D.C. under
the auspices of the
Stanford-in-Washington program,
and about 65 of these were in
Congressional offices. Through
speaker and seminar programs
arranged by both bipartisan intern
committees and Stanford-in-Wash
ington, and through their work in
government offices, national
problems such as military
spending, welfare, and education
took on new emphasis.
During the academic year,
Stanford-in-Washington is
quartered in the Bowman Alumni
House. Plans for next summer are
already underway, and an
organizational meeting for those

interested in participating next
summer is scheduled for 4:15
Wednesday in Tresidder Large
Lounge.
The primary purpose of
the program is to help students
obtain jobs in Washington.
Stanford-in-Washington officers
take applications back to
Congressional offices and lobby
for jobs for Stanford students.
Assistance is also given to students
who wish to work in government
agencies rather than on the Hill.
Perhaps the program's biggest
selling point is that it can offer
financial assistance to help
students meet living expenses for
the summer. Congressmen and
Senators rarely have room in their
budget to add a staff member for
the summer, but many are eager
to have what some students
referred to cynically as "free slave
labor."
Assignments Differ
Duties of interns vary
considerably. Often the most
pressing chores are running the
mimeograph machine or
alphabetizing the mailing list, but
many interns also work on
research projects and may even
draft policy statements.
All interns on the Hill had
considerable freedom to listen in
on floor debates and committee
hearings. When Stanford

University was the topic before
the McClellan committee hearing
on campus disruptions, Stanford
interns turned out en masse.
Intern Programs
Both the House and Senate had
bipartisan intern committees to
arrange programs for interns. A
number of important figures
addressed assemblies of the over
600 interns on the Hill. The
speakers included Congressman
Allard Lowenstein, Senator
George McGovern, and
Ambassador Averell Harriman.
Stanford also arranged a series
of programs for its interns. Urban
Coalition head and Stanford
trustee John Gardner spoke to
Stanford-in-Washington people,
along with former
Attorney-General Ramsey Clark,
HEW Secretary Robert Finch, and
social critic Ralph Nader.
"The main value of
Stanford-in-Washington," says
Mike Peach, one of the program's
leaders, "is to provide a program
on a smaller level, more intimate
than the bipartisan program can
provide."
Next summer, Stanford-in-
Sacramento is going to be revived,
and the program is also working
to have student interns in various
municipalities. Interested students
should contact Sarah Norton in
the Bowman Alumni House.
