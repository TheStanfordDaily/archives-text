## January Lottery Predicted 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Senate
Republicans said Monday that the
next American youths drafted
probably will be selected through
a lottery system which didn't
stand a chance until President
Nixon "put the heat" on
Congress.
"As a result of that kind of
leadership we'll probably get a
draft bill this year," said Sen.
Hugh Scott, R-Pa., the minority
leader. "It was dead until the
President put the heat on."
Nixon's draft plan, to induct
19-year-olds on the basis of a
lottery based on their birth dates,
has the unanimous approval of the
House Armed Services
Committee.
It is likely to pass the House
before the week is over.
Sen. John C. Stennis, D-Miss.,
chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, has indicated
his panel will hold hearings on the
measure if it clears the House.
That could open the way for
the Senate action which would
send it to the White House, where
Nixon repeatedly has urged its
swift enactment.
Sen. Mike Mansfield, D-Mont.,
the majority leader, said he thinks
the prospects are good for Senate
action before the end of the
current congressional session.
Sen. Karl E. Mundt, R-S.D.,
said that likelihood plus the
cancellation of November and
December draft calls, could mean
the end of the present selection
system.
"This could mean that
draft-age citizens will no longer be
vulnerable under the old system,"
Mundt said, "for if Congress
follows through on the President's
request in the next few weeks, the

administration's reform plan can
be operating when it becomes
necessary to utilize the draft
again."
Nominee Backed
WASHINGTON
(AP)—President Nixon said
yesterday his Supreme Court
nominee, Judge Clement F.
Haynsworth Jr., has been
subjected to "vicious character
assassination."
At a surprise news briefing that
intensified the battle over the
nomination, which is strongly
opposed by labor and civil rights
leaders, Nixon said he would not
withdraw the appointment even if
the judge asked him to.
"I find Judge Haynsworth an
honest man, a lawyer's lawyer and
a judge's judge," Nixon said after
stating he had gone over all the
criticism of opponents. "I think
he will be a great credit to the
Supreme Court and I intend to
stand behind him until he is
confirmed."
Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Ind., who
has spearheaded the opposition in
the Senate, said, "The President
appears to be leveling his guns at
me personally" and called this an
unfortunate attempt to distort the
issue and turn Haynsworth's
nomination into a partisan matter.
Bayh, in a statement dictated
to an aide said he never has
contended that Haynsworth, cheif
judge of the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court, is a dishonest man. But he
maintained that Haynsworth "has
not conducted himself to avoid
the appearance of impropriety."
Sens. Roman L. Hruska,
R-Neb., and Marlow W. Cook

R-Ky., expressed agreement with
Nixon's statement and said they
are glad he spoke out strongly.
Hruska, ranking GOP member
of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said that "now that
the rash of careless and
irresponsible charges has been
shown to be completely baseless
and now that attention has now at
least been turned to the positive
judicial record of Judge
Haynsworth, I am more confident
than ever that the Senate will vote
its confidence in him and confirm
his nomination."
Sen. Robert P. Griffin of
Michigan, the assistant Republican
leader in the Senate, declined
comment on < the President's
statement. He earlier had urged
Nixon to withdraw Haynsworth's
nomination, calling it an
unfortunate mistake.
While Haynsworth has been
accused of antilabor and anticivil
rights bias, opponents have
concentrated their fight on a
conflict-of-interest charges they
have raised against him on his
extensive stock holdings.
They contend he should have
disqualified himself in some court
cases in which he has participated,
but he and his supporters have
said that on the contrary he had
no valid grounds on which to
excuse himself and had a duty to
sit.
Nixon also took this position,
saying that in his review of all
facts, Haynsworth came through
as a man of integrity, "and
deserves even more the support of
the President and the Senate."
Haynsworth has furnished the
Judiciary Committee with a
complete listing of his stock
holdings and has offered to put

his holdings in trust if confirmed
by the Senate.
Nixon said he is confident that
if senators will study all the
documents and charges, a
majority will reach the same
conclusion he has and will vote to
confirm Haynsworth.
PTA Protests
BERKELEY (AP)-A Berkeley
Parent-Teacher Association has
voted to support a nation-wide
peace march in what it says is the
first PTA protest against the
Vietnam War.
The resolution, adopted by the
Jefferson Elementary School PTA
with two dissenting votes,
supports a Nov. 15 peace march in
San Francisco, part of the second
planned nation-wide anti-war
demonstration.
Mrs. Robley Berry of
Kensington, statewide PTA
president, said Monday the
resolution will be sent to a study
committee, then voted on and if
approved, sent to the national
organization for action on the
issues of the day and certainly one
of the major issues today is the
war in Vietnam," she said.
Other PTA leaders throughout
the state were less enthusiastic
about getting involved in the
antiwar movement. Los Angeles
Mayor Sam Yorty termed the
resolution "foolish and a
dis-service to the country and to
high school age boys."
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction Max Rafferty
observed: "The PTA is a private
local group. As long as it does not
violate the law, it is free to do
anything it wants to."
Mrs. Kermit Jacobson, head of
the Pasadena PTA said: "We have
so many financial problems just to
keep schools functioning, we are
not involved in any outside
activities. We wouldn't take a
stand on an issue such as this
without a study."
Mrs. W.C. McLeod, president
of the PTA district covering about
a half of Los Angeles County
outside the city, added: "We
would never officially
demonstrate. We would hold a
meeting at which both sides of a
question were discussed, so the
facts could be presented to
parents."
The Jefferson PTA said it will
participate in the Nov. 15 march
as a unit regardless of what action
is ultimately taken by other PTA
units.
