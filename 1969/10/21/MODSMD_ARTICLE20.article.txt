Villa Montalvo, Saratoga's
center for the arts, is sponsoring a
poster contest open to college art
students.
The winning entry will be sold
commercially as Montalvo's
official poster and the winner will
receive $100 for his design.
Mrs. Harriet Lundquist,
chairman of the Montalvo New
Dimensions Committee, which is
sponsoring the event, said the
griffin is the official emblem of
the Montalvo Association and
lends itself to either
contemporary or traditional
treatment. "There are many
unique features of the Villa and
the grounds which also might
inspire a special design," she said.

The poster should be
approximately 18 x 24 inches to
20 x 30 inches and the words
VILLA MONTALVO should
appear on the design, she said.
The deadline for entry is
November 8 at 4:30 p.m.
