# Nixon Urges Misdemeanor Penalty for Drug Possession
## 
### 
WASHINGTON AP-In the
hope that it will lead to better law
enforcement "and better respect
for the law," the Nixon
administration proposed Monday
that the penalty for possessing
narcotics and dangerous drugs be
reduced to misdemeanor size.
This would mean that first
offenders convicted of possession
of marijuana or other narcotics
would no longer be branded
felons subject to maximum
penalties of 2 to 10 years
imprisonment and $20,000 fine.
John E. Ingersoll, director of
the Justice Department's Bureau
of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs, said a more flexible
penalty structure is needed to

"make the punishment fit the
person" and the crime.
Testifying before the Senate
subcommittee on juvenile
delinquency, Ingersoll said: "All
too often, because of the present
penalty structure, there is a real
hesitancy on the part of
prosecutors in courts to handle
possession cases because of the
potential high penalties involved."
Reversing a previous Justice
Department stand, Ingersoll
proposed that federal laws draw a
distinction between narcotics
users and traffickers.
"By allowing the court to
prosecute the possessor who
intends to sell as a felon and the

possessor for one's own use as a
misdemeanant," Ingersoll said, "1
believe we will have better law
enforcement and better respect
for the law."
He suggested that possession
with intent to sell remain a felony
and that "possession for one's
own use, regardless of the drug
involved," be made a
misdemeanor.
This would lower the
maximum penalty for simple
possession to a $5,000 fine and a
possible sentence of up to one
year in jail, for first offenders.
Second offenders would face
stiffer penalties.
