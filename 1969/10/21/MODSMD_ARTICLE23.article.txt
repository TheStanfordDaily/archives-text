# California Not Affected By Proposed Pot Law
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO AP-State
officials said Monday the Nixon
administration's proposal to ease
narcotics penalties will have little
affect in California.
John E. Storer, chief of the
state Bureau of Narcotics
Enforcement, said the proposal
will apply only to cases
prosecuted in federal courts—"an
infinitesimal" number of
California arrests.
And H.E. Springett, acting area
supervisor for the bureau in San
Diego, said state statutes, recently
revised, are much like what
President Nixon has proposed.
The administration asked that
a misdemeanor-instead of the
present felony-penalty be handed
out for simple possession of
narcotics or dangerous drugs.
Felonies carry heavier penalties
than misdemeanors.
John E. Ingersoll, director of
the Justice Department's Bureau
of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs, said the lower penalty for
the increasingly common offense
of marijuana and drug possession
would result in prosecutors filing
more cases, and make courts less

reluctant to sentence those
convicted.
At present, advocates of
change say, police and judges are
hesitant to press felony charges
against those found with
marijuana—especially in cases
involving young people.
California law has been
changed recently. Now, those
arrested for possession are booked
for a felony, but the judge has the
discretion of lowering it to a
misdemeanor. Felony sentences
are still mandatory for those
convicted of having hard
narcotics, such as heroin.
Storer said the administration
proposal, if it becomes law, will
hit mostly those who are caught
by immigration officials with
narcotics when they cross the
border from Mexico into
California.
Most narcotics arrests, he said,
are made by local or state officials
and tried in the state courts.
Even if the administration
proposal passed, legal experts said,
California narcotics laws would
not be changed.
