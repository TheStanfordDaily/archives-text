# Court Supports Angela Davis; Law Ruled Unconstitutional

LOS ANGELES
(AP)-Communists may not be
barred from teaching at the
University of California, a
Superior Court judge ruled
yesterday.
Judge Jerry Pacht declared
unconstitutional the Board of
Regents' firing of Angela Davis
from the faculty of UCLA
because she is a Communist. Miss
Davis, 25, an assistant philosophy
professor, was fired Sept. 19.
Miss Davis will speak at Mills
College in Oakland on Thursday
at 1 p.m. The lecture, "Education,
Racism, and Politics," will be
open to the public.
Ruling in support of a
taxpayers'suit brought by a group
of faculty members, Pacht said
"mere membership" in the
Communist party is not grounds
for barring a person from public
employment.
The regents' 1940 policy to bar
Communists from teaching at the
University of California could be
logically extended Pacht said, to
mean the regents could outlaw
membership in any party out of

Attorneys for the regents, said
they would study the ruling
before deciding whether to
appeal.
Two UC regents said they do
not consider Pacht's decision final
determination.
Philip L. Boyd, a retired
banker and developer from
Riverside, said, "I don't feel such
a ruling is a final determination of
the matter. Besides being very
disappointed, I have no
comment."
Elinor Heller of Atherton said,
"In view of previous court
decisions, I'm not surprised the
regents' action was declared
unconstitutional. What surprises
me is such a quick decision."
The hearing in Superior Court
took about two hours, with Judge
Pacht denying a motion by the
regents' attorneys for a change of
venue to Alameda County. He
also denied their requests to
submit additional briefs before he
ruled.
Pacht called it "terrifying" that
Miss Davis' membership in he
Communist party disqualified her
from teaching at the Los Angeles
campus of the University.

"I'm delighted," said Wade
Savage, an assistant professor of
philosophy at UCLA. "After
accusing so many students of
violating the law, they now have
violated the law . . .Now we'll see
if they obey the law."
In giving his verbal opinion
Monday, Judge Pacht read the
regents' ruling of June 30 that
"No political test shall ever be
considered in the appointment
and promotion of any faculty
member or employee." He said he
was not convinced the Communist
Party was exempt from this
resolution of he regents,
He said it would be "unlawful
and dangerous" for the regents to
enforce a political "litmus paper
test." Such power, asserted Pacht,
would make them "a kind of
political elite entitled to decide
whose views are acceptable."
The judge prefaced his remarks
by saying he thought both sides
"have what they believe to be the
best interests of the university at
heart."
Pacht suggested that it would
be improper for the UCLA faculty
to pursue a committee hearing on
whether Miss Davis' should have
been fired.
