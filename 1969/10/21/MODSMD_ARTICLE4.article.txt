# Law Group Considers Preserving Coyote Hill
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
Means to stop the
industrialization of the top of the
Coyote Hill area by the University
were discussed last night at the
meeting of the newly-formed
Environmental Law Society.
Although various legal
procedures were discussed to halt
development of the open land,
action was delayed until next
week.
The meeting brought together
a loose coalition of
conservationists and community
attorneys in an effort to preserve
at least a portion of the wooded
ridge area of Coyote Hill as a
park or open space.
The Coyote Hill issue centers
around an area west of the present
Industrial Park which has been
proposed as the site for a
nine-parcel division of the acerage
for industrial development. Of
particular interest to those at last
night's meeting is the acreage on
the top of the hill slated for
development as an animal research
center.
The Stanford development
masterplan calls for light industry
for the foothill area. Corporations
which have expressed interest
include Syntex Laboratories,
Computer Time Sharing
Corporation, and the Opto
Electronics division of Fairchild
camera.
Animal Center
The Syntex proposal for the
hilltop, to be developed solely by
Stanford for zoning purposes,
includes an animal research
center, with open space grazing
land for animals in a joint Medical
School-Syntex research project on
birth control and animal behavior.
The conservationists seek to keep
the hilltop completely free from
man made structures.
Groups represented at the
meeting included the United
Stanford Employees, the Sierra
club, the Stanford Conservation
Group, the Palo Alto Civic
Association, the Los Altos Hills
Association, the Green Foothills
association, and the Political
Science department.
Dave Jackman and Jim
Rummonds, co-chairmen of the
group, pointed out that the
purpose of tb-} society was to
provide a forum for law students
to provide legal aid and research
for groups interested in
conservation or environmental
control.
"The legal action portion of
the society's activities constitutes

only about one fourth of the total
function of the society," Jackman
explained.
The Society will provide
chance for law students to work
with practical legal issues
involving environmental quality
questions," he added.
The meeting was in general
agreement that a legal action
should be instituted to review
zoning decisions of the Palo Alto
city council, and test the legality
of several of the councils' actions
with regard to Coyote Hill.
Any legal action taken in the
Coyote Hill case will probably
seek to have road building and
grading halted until the court can
rule on the legality of the
proposed land use.
Construction of two roads on
the Hill is underway. The
conservation groups are upset that
the roads have already marred two
of Coyote Hill's most outstanding
topographical features—Deer
Creek and Deer Gulch.

L.os Altos Hills residents are
concerned that traffic congestion
in the area will alter the tone of
their community, and destroy the
residential atmosphere.
The conservation groups plans
to fight to preserve all of the
Coyote Hill area, although they
concede that much of the land
will probably be given over to
light industry. The current issue is
the preservation of at least some
of the land from the creeping
borders of the proposed industrial
park.
Press Barred
At the beginning of the long
session, the twenty participants
voted to exclude members of the
press, claiming that the meeting
constituted a privileged
communication between lawyers
and clients.
After a protest by The Daily, a
reporter was readmitted under the
proviso that nothing be printed
without the consent of Society
co-chairman Rummonds.

involving environmental quality
questions," he added.
The meeting was in general
agreement that a legal action
should be instituted to review
zoning decisions of the Palo Alto
city council, and test the legality
of several of the councils' actions
with regard to Coyote Hill.
Any legal action taken in the
Coyote Hill case will probably
seek to have road building and
grading halted until the court can
rule on the legality of the
proposed land use.
Construction of two roads on
the Hill is underway. The
conservation groups are upset that
the roads have already marred two
of Coyote Hill's most outstanding
topographical features—Deer
Creek and Deer Gulch.

L.os Altos Hills residents are
concerned that traffic congestion
in the area will alter the tone of
their community, and destroy the
residential atmosphere.
The conservation groups plans
to fight to preserve all of the
Coyote Hill area, although they
concede that much of the land
will probably be given over to
light industry. The current issue is
the preservation of at least some
of the land from the creeping
borders of the proposed industrial
park.
Press Barred
At the beginning of the long
session, the twenty participants
voted to exclude members of the
press, claiming that the meeting
constituted a privileged
communication between lawyers
and clients.

ANOTHER INDUSTRIAL PARK?—Jim Rummonds discusses proceedings of
the Environmental Law Society, which last night considered ways to keep the
University from industrializing Coyote Hill.
Means to stop the
industrialization of the top of the
Coyote Hill area by the University
were discussed last night at the
meeting of the newly-formed
Environmental Law Society.
Although various legal
procedures were discussed to halt
development of the open land,
action was delayed until next
week.
The meeting brought together
a loose coalition of
conservationists and community
attorneys in an effort to preserve
at least a portion of the wooded
ridge area of Coyote Hill as a
park or open space.
The Coyote Hill issue centers
around an area west of the present
Industrial Park which has been
proposed as the site for a
nine-parcel division of the acerage
for industrial development. Of
particular interest to those at last
night's meeting is the acreage on
the top of the hill slated for
development as an animal research
center.
The Stanford development
masterplan calls for light industry
for the foothill area. Corporations
which have expressed interest
include Syntex Laboratories,
Computer Time Sharing
Corporation, and the Opto
Electronics division of Fairchild
camera.
Animal Center
The Syntex proposal for the
hilltop, to be developed solely by
Stanford for zoning purposes,
includes an animal research
center, with open space grazing
land for animals in a joint Medical
School-Syntex research project on
birth control and animal behavior.
The conservationists seek to keep
the hilltop completely free from
man made structures.
Groups represented at the
meeting included the United
Stanford Employees, the Sierra
club, the Stanford Conservation
Group, the Palo Alto Civic
Association, the Los Altos Hills
Association, the Green Foothills
association, and the Political
Science department.
Dave Jackman and Jim
Rummonds, co-chairmen of the
group, pointed out that the
purpose of tb-} society was to
provide a forum for law students
to provide legal aid and research
for groups interested in
conservation or environmental
control.
"The legal action portion of
the society's activities constitutes

only about one fourth of the total
function of the society," Jackman
explained.
The Society will provide
chance for law students to work
with practical legal issues
involving environmental quality
questions," he added.
