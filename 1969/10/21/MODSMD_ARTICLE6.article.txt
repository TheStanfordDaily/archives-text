# Trailer Residents Plan Food Co-Op
## 
### DAVID WEIL 
Twenty of the 500 Manzanita
Park residents met last night to
discuss suggestions for improving
life in the trailers.
Central to he discussion was a
plan for a food co-op that would
allow members to purchase name
brand products at a discount of
25 to 30 percent.
Food would be supplied by the
University Commissary and would
be distributed from an unused
campus room near Manzanita
Park. However, due to federal
laws, no fresh vegetables, bread or
meat could be sold.
The co-op would be a legal
corporation, with salaried
employees and a membership fee
of about $2.50 per person.
Another subject of discussion
was the keeping of pets. A
complaint was voiced that dogs
were "messing up" the individual
cluster courtyards. It was decided
to warn pet-owners to keep their
animals better controlled.
Current university policy on
this issue forbids the keeping of
pets in any campus residence, but
no one present at the meeting
seemed willing to assume the
responsibility of enforcing this
policy.

Parallel parking, although still
technically illegal, will have to
continue since there are not
enough parking spaces and no
more are planned. It was reported
that local police will refrain from
ticketing vehicles parked in this
manner.
Park social activities will be
handled through a
non-compulsory club, with
participants paying a small fee to
join. In this way no social dues
will be levied on trailer residents.
Painting the trailers with
water-based paints was found to
be unsuccessful and the use of
permanent paints is still
forbidden.
I. ins
Street lighting has been found
to be officially inadequate by a
university committee and action is
expected in the near future.
Hike racks have been ordered,
as has a general mail box. A
motion to re name the park was
tabled until the next general
meeting or until a poll could be
taken.
Future official Manzanita Park
matters will be handled by a
co-ordinating committee which
will take suggestions from open
meetings of all park dwellers.
