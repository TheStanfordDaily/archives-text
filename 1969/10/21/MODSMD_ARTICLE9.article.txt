## Free The Schools 
### Bill Evers 
The present system of
j education in America is unjust
I and violates fundamental human
rights.
i
At the high school level,
schools are often detention
"camps. What Paul Goodman has
Jc ailed ''compulsory
mis-education" is both a
a universal trap and no good.
d
The legislative ancestor of
present compulsory attendance
, laws is a measure passed by the
puritan theocracy of
Massachusetts in 1642. In the
March 13 Village Voice, Nat
j Hentoff wrote of New York
State's Compulsory Education
< Act: "The law here is that
education is compulsory until the
age of 17. There are no provisions
for conscientious objectors."
Trained For Obedience
Hen toff's article was
s occasioned by a test of the
constitutionality of that law. A
boy was cited for truancy in
Family Court for refusing to
attend P.S. 58 in New York City.
His attorney William Resnick
argued for his client's stand as a
deliberate conscientious objector
to compulsory attendance, saying
that the school was "essentially
custodial, not educational," and
that the function of the whole
system was "to train kids for
mediocrity and obedience."
When in 1964 Secretary of
Labor Willard Wirtz proposed
extending compulsory schooling
to the age of 18, Paul Goodman
wrote: "Twist it any way you like
and turn it how you will, there is
no logic to the proposal to extend
compulsory schooling except as a
device to keep the unemployed

off the streets by putting them
into concentration camps called
schools." Goodman charged that
Wirtz sought "to deprive
adolescents of their freedom in
order to alleviate the difficulties
of a faulty economic and political
system."
Low Quality
The infringements on human
freedom which the mandatory
attendance laws entail are unjust,
but the injustice which the high
school student suffers is further
aggravated by the low quality of
the education in public schools.
The success of freedom schools
and street academies has come
because they are able to provide a
better alternative.
Christopher Hencks offers the
following as an explanation of the
failure of public education:
"Because the slum school is
public, it is accountable to the
taxpayer. As in every other public
enterprise, this kind of minute
accountability to publicity-hungry
elected officials leads to timidity
among the employees. Public
control puts a premium not on
achieving a few spectacular
successes but on avoiding any
spectacular failures."
Students' Interests Irrelevant
The direction which
educational endeavor in American
universities takes is determined by
government, foundation, and
corporation money which goes to
finance research. The direction of
higher education is determined by
what the tenured professors can
do in the way of research for the
government and its corporate
allies, not by what both teachers
and students might find
interesting to study.

As a result, the greatest
challenge which this educational
system faces is from those
students enmeshed in the
nationalized knowledge industry
who are now in revolt.
The McClellan Committee
hearings on campus disorders this
last summer and the firing of
UCLA philosophy professor
Angela Davis by the UC regents
were not aberrations. Government
regulation of that which the
government subsidizes is to be
expected.
"Federal-grant University"
The relationship found in the
Morrill Act of 1862, which
provided federal land grants to
create state colleges with
compulsory ROTC, is mirrored in
the present-day relationship
between what Clark Kerr calls the
"federal-grant university" and the
military-industrial research which
is performed in it.
The legalized injustice of the
educational system in America is
further illustrated in the funding
of higher education. The average
income of the parents of the
students at the typical city or
state college or university is much
higher than the average income of
taxpayers. That this is robbery is
self-evident.
Ample proof exists that the
present system of education in
America, tied in as it is to the
political apparatus, is morally
bankrupt. Education needs to be
freed from the control of
government.

The direction which
educational endeavor in American
universities takes is determined by
government, foundation, and
corporation money which goes to
finance research. The direction of
higher education is determined by
what the tenured professors can
do in the way of research for the
government and its corporate
allies, not by what both teachers
and students might find
interesting to study.

As a result, the greatest
challenge which this educational
system faces is from those
students enmeshed in the
nationalized knowledge industry
who are now in revolt.

"Federal-grant University"
The relationship found in the
Morrill Act of 1862, which
provided federal land grants to
create state colleges with
compulsory ROTC, is mirrored in
the present-day relationship

"federal-grant university" and the
military-industrial research which
is performed in it.
The legalized injustice of the
educational system in America is
further illustrated in the funding
of higher education. The average
income of the parents of the
students at the typical city or
state college or university is much
higher than the average income of
taxpayers. That this is robbery is
self-evident.
Ample proof exists that the
