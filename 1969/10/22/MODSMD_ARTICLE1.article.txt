# City Council Blasts Slur
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council
Monday night condemned alleged
racial slurs made by a local judge.
The judge, Gerald S. Chargin,
made the remarks while
sentencing a Mexican-American
youth found guilty of incest.
Judge Chargin's remarks have
drawn widespread criticism from
both Mexican-American groups
and local politicians. The trial was
held in Gilroy and as a result of
the furor, Judge Chargin has been
transferred to the Palo Alto
Courthouse.
The city council resolution,
which was approved by an 8 to 2
margin, also called on the State
Commission on Judicial
Qualifications "to take action
without delay on this matter."
IMECHA Members
More than 30 chicanos, many
of them members of MECHA, the
Stanford Mexican-American
students Association, attended the
meeting.
Chargin's remarks included
statements that the youth
involved should "commit suicide"
and that he was "lower than an
animal." The judge also allegedly
said "maybe Hitler was right" and
"we have to kill. . .mad dogs of
our society."
Leading off the speakers for
the passage of the resolution was
Luis Nogales, a graduate of
Stanford law school and currently
Assistant to the President for
Mexican-American Affairs at
Stanford. Nogales argued that
"when a person is judging is
prejudiced there can be no
justice." Saying "if a child is told
he is an animal, he feels inferior,"
Nogales labeled Chargin's attitude
"a self-fulfilling prophecy."
Transfer A Hacked
Another speaker, Jack Ybarra,
attacked Chargin's transfer, saying

"Judge Chargin was brought to
Palo Alto because fewer
Mexican-Americans live here and
it was thought he would be more
acceptable to white citizens."
Ybarra called the city council's
apparent reluctance to act on the
matter being "afraid to get
involved."
After the speakers had
presented their case, they fielded
questions from the City
Councilmen.
Councilman Stanley Norton
asked if the City Council would
be "racist" if it refused to
condemn Judge Chargin. A
speaker replied "No, but it would
be an abdication of your
responsibility." Norton then
asked; "Do you have confidence
in the Judicial Qualifications
Commission?" Someone from the
floor replied, "You should take a
stand on your own."
Councilman John Beahrs
asked, "Do you believe in due
process of law?" One of the
audience replied, "You're missing
the point." Councilman Beahrs
rejoined, "We must all live by due
process of law or must face dire
consequences." Monte Perez
pointed out that due process
involves fair play, and Chargin's
remarks "are indicting a whole
people". This statement by the
judge is "hitting people
(Chicanos) below the belt.".
Councilmen's Remarks
During the remarks by the
Councilmen which followed,
Kirke Comstock stated
unequivocably that "No judge or
any person in this community has
the right to counsel suicide."
Councilman Enid Pearson
mentioned her "qualms" about
due process. "It doesn't always
solve problems," she commented.

Monday night condemned alleged
racial slurs made by a local judge.
The judge, Gerald S. Chargin,
made the remarks while
sentencing a Mexican-American
youth found guilty of incest.
Judge Chargin's remarks have
drawn widespread criticism from
both Mexican-American groups
and local politicians. The trial was
held in Gilroy and as a result of
the furor, Judge Chargin has been
transferred to the Palo Alto
Courthouse.
The city council resolution,
which was approved by an 8 to 2
margin, also called on the State
Commission on Judicial
Qualifications "to take action
without delay on this matter."
IMECHA Members
More than 30 chicanos, many
of them members of MECHA, the
Stanford Mexican-American
students Association, attended the
meeting.
Chargin's remarks included
statements that the youth
involved should "commit suicide"
and that he was "lower than an
animal." The judge also allegedly
said "maybe Hitler was right" and
"we have to kill. . .mad dogs of
our society."
Leading off the speakers for
the passage of the resolution was
Luis Nogales, a graduate of
Stanford law school and currently
Assistant to the President for
Mexican-American Affairs at
Stanford. Nogales argued that
"when a person is judging is
prejudiced there can be no
justice." Saying "if a child is told
he is an animal, he feels inferior,"
Nogales labeled Chargin's attitude
"a self-fulfilling prophecy."
Transfer A Hacked
Another speaker, Jack Ybarra,
attacked Chargin's transfer, saying

"Judge Chargin was brought to
Palo Alto because fewer
Mexican-Americans live here and
it was thought he would be more
acceptable to white citizens."
Ybarra called the city council's
apparent reluctance to act on the
matter being "afraid to get
involved."
After the speakers had
presented their case, they fielded
questions from the City
Councilmen.
Councilman Stanley Norton
asked if the City Council would
be "racist" if it refused to
condemn Judge Chargin. A
speaker replied "No, but it would
be an abdication of your
responsibility." Norton then
asked; "Do you have confidence
in the Judicial Qualifications
Commission?" Someone from the
floor replied, "You should take a
stand on your own."
Councilman John Beahrs
asked, "Do you believe in due
process of law?" One of the
audience replied, "You're missing
the point." Councilman Beahrs
rejoined, "We must all live by due
process of law or must face dire
consequences." Monte Perez
pointed out that due process
involves fair play, and Chargin's
remarks "are indicting a whole
people". This statement by the
judge is "hitting people
(Chicanos) below the belt.".
Councilmen's Remarks
During the remarks by the
Councilmen which followed,
Kirke Comstock stated
unequivocably that "No judge or
any person in this community has
the right to counsel suicide."
Councilman Enid Pearson
mentioned her "qualms" about
due process. "It doesn't always
solve problems," she commented.
