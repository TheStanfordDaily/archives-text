# Housing Discussed By Urban Coalition
## 
### SUSAN MAAS 
Housing development and
discrimination were problems
discussed by the Policy
Committee of the Mid-Peninsula
Urban Coalition last night.
The Coalition, a group of
community people, students, and
faculty members, is sponsoring a
32-unit housing development in
Mountain View. They are also
planning to form a Housing
Development Corporation for the
Mid-Peninsula area.
Before the corporation can be
formed, however, a revolving fund
of about one million dollars must
be raised.
Federal Funds Used
Funds for the Mountain View
projects willcome from the
Federal Housing Administration.
As sponsor, the Coalition
determines the type of units to be
built and the architect, as well as
rent and racial balance. The
Housing Development Task Force,
headed by Robert Moulton, is in
charge of the development.
Additional land for
development may be obtained
from Stanford. According to
Moulton, the University is
"favorably disposed" toward the
idea.

After discussing the Mountain
View project, members of the
Mid-peninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing outlined their method of
combating discrimination.
The group contacts
corporation leaders and urges

their help when their employees
face housing discrimination.
Their program, now five years
old, is endorsed by the Coalition.
According to Naomi Golden, a
member of the citizens group,
discrimination in housing is not as
bad as it was five or ten years ago,
but is still great.
By working with corporations,
the group hopes not only to help
minority people find housing, but
to inform and educate white
people as well.
Many Units Needed
Ira Hall, executive director of
the Coalition, stated that over the
next ten years the U.S. as a whole
will need one million units of
housing per year. In San Mateo
County alone, the waiting list for
low-cost housing has been closed
at over 2,000.
In order to raise money for
needed housing, the National
Coalition has called for a review
of defense expenditures as its
number one priority. The next
higher priorities are a minority
contractors institute and a
nation-wide advertising campaign.
Local Groups Separate
Local Chairman Edward
Ginzton stressed, however, that
the local is a separate organization
not bound by national priorities.
The Mid-peninsula Coalition is
one of eight such groups in
California.
Although it makes use of
Stanford resources, and the idea
orgiriated with Stanford faculty
members, the Coalition is not tied
to the University in any way.
