## Faculty Disposal 
### Cissi Bonini 
(Interview with Lewis Spitz,
Professor of Renaissance-Reform
ation History )
Mom: Dr Spitz, there's been a
great deal of criticism of the
university's policy in disposing of
dead faculty members. The
present method, as you know, is
to throw their bodies in the
WilburFood Service Garbage Bin.
But the garbage company has
threatened to increase their rates.
Donating faculty bodies for
transplants is out, as it is
especially difficult to determine
the exact moment of death with
the faculty. We all remember
Professor X who passed away
early in the quarter but remained
at his lectern until final exams.
Students claimed there was no
discernable difference in his
lectures. Have you any
suggestions, sir?
Dr. Spitz: The former
presidents and deans could be
buried in the chapel like Dukes.
And the professors could be
buried in White Plaza, covered
with Black-Top in squares like the
golden memorial class boxes
under the arcades in front of the
chapel. To save space they could
be driven into the ground toes
first, closer to each other in death
than there were in life. There
could be a small footnote bearing

name and department, composed
of discarded S. U. Press type. Hand
and finger upraised in forceful
gesture, of course. Each
generation would be standing on
the shoulders of mental giants and
would realize that they are upheld
by tradition.
Mom: This sounds like an
entirely satisfactory solution. But
would the students like it?
L)r. Spit/.: We could have a
motto: "They walked on us in
life, why not in death?" Also,
Coach Ralston could give his
Danforth scholars their skull
practice there.
Mom: All this sounds ideal. Do
you foresee any problems?
Dr. Spitz: The problem is
where to lay to rest those dimpled
darlings of yesteryear, the faculty
wives. The gentle slopes of Pine
Hill Four beckon, for they could
look down upon the Quad as they
once did from Pine Hill One, Two,
and Three where their husbands
and lovers gave their lives in
pursuit of learning.
Mom: Thank you very much,
Dr. Spitz. Have you any closing
thought?
Dr. Spit/.: "Old professors
never die, they just go under."
