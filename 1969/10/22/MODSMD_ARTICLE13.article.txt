# 'Fat Japs' & 'Commies'
## Is Spiro T. An 'Emotional Purgative'? 
### Larry Diamond 
Since his selection as Mr.
Nixon's running mate last year,
Vice President Spiro Agnew has
come to symbolize much of what
is truly detestable in Americans.
His uncouth racial references, his
Joseph McCarthy-st le
insinuations, and his
narrow-minded condemnation of
everything that his middle class
mind cannot grasp are well
documented.
After the incipient idiocy he
unleashed during the campaign,
many thought that perhaps he had
been quieted, given some
unimportant government chores
to occupy enough of his time so
that we would not have to be
subjected to any more of his
ridiculous utterances. It was bad
enough when he talked of people
not as people, but as "fat Japs,"
"Pollock " and "Wops." Worse still
when he described the American
malaise as "an artificial and
masochistic sophistication, the
vague uneasiness that our values
are false, that there is something
wrong with being partriotic, moral
and hardworking."
But Mr. Agnew's recent words
have carried him to even greater
depths of ignominy (though after
the 1968 campaign many thought
that he had reached rock bottom).
Calling the leaders of last week's
Vietnam Moratorium "impudent
snobs" unable "to offer
constructive solutions to the
problem," he charges that the
Moratorium was an "emotional
purgative" conducted in "a spirit
of national masochism."
Psychological Diarrhea
If we are impudent because we
challenge policies that are

. rnr
mistaken and misguided, then
America should thank us for our
impudence. We do propose
constructive action —stop the war
now, bring home all our troops
immediately, and redirect our
moral and economic resources
tward eliminating the disgraceful
inequities that still exist in our
own society.
From his imbecile
psycho-analysis of the
Moratorium as an "emotional
purgative," one can only conclude
that our vacuous Vice President is
so morally constipated that he
simply can't understand the
meaning of the Moratoriym. (Or
perhaps he is simply suffering
from an advanced case of
psychological diarrhea.)
Mr. Agnew charged that the
"lessons of the past" are being
ignored by the supporters of the
Moratorium. But Agnew has
ignored the most significant lesson
of the century—that we do not
have the ability and we do not
have the right to police the world.
Proclamations
Analyzing in idiotic generalities
something about which he knows
nothing has become the Agnew
trademark. And in his speech,
none of these analyses was more
inane than that which he made of
today's students. "The student
now goes to college to proclaim
rather than to learn," he said. We
do not even suggest that there is
not a huge amount of knowledge
to be gained at college. We are
here to learn knowledge, but more
important, we are here to learn to
be more decent, more human,
more sensitive and more aware.
And if this is the single most

important purpose of a
university—to enable individuals
to grow more sensitive and
aware—then Mr. Agnew stands as
a living symbol of the past failure
of our educational system.
We do not go to college to
proclaim, but neither can we be
silent when we believe our
country's policies are mistaken.
Primarily, we do not proclaim, we
question. But students almost
universally do proclaim this
much—that killing is wrong,
racism is wrong, insensitivity is
wrong, and we are not going to
tolerate it any longer.
It is quite easy to be vehement
and emotional in one's choice of
adjectives to describe Vice
President Agnew. But if nothing
else can be truthfully said about
him, this can: his narrow-minded
ness and insensitivity typify that
which is despicable in too many
Americans.
Soul Pollution
Last week, Edward Keating
aptly characterized the crisis of
this country as "soul pollution."
Spiro Agnew is, by virtue of his
thoughtless tirades, one of
America's worst polluters.
Mr. Agnew, we are tired of
your tirades of narrow-minded
ness, your verbal tantrums of
insensitivity, your rank stupidity.
Someday you will be replaced by
men who are concerned anout the
pollution that plagues America,
and who have the ability and
intelligence to act upon that
concern. The politics of humanity
are now only beginning to emerge.
But, beware. Already, sir, you are
an anachronism.(Larry Diamond is

His uncouth racial references, his
Joseph McCarthy-st le
insinuations, and his
narrow-minded condemnation of
everything that his middle class
mind cannot grasp are well
documented.
After the incipient idiocy he
unleashed during the campaign,
many thought that perhaps he had
been quieted, given some
unimportant government chores
to occupy enough of his time so
that we would not have to be
subjected to any more of his
ridiculous utterances. It was bad
enough when he talked of people
not as people, but as "fat Japs,"
"Pollock " and "Wops." Worse still
when he described the American
malaise as "an artificial and
masochistic sophistication, the
vague uneasiness that our values
are false, that there is something
wrong with being partriotic, moral
and hardworking."
But Mr. Agnew's recent words
have carried him to even greater
depths of ignominy (though after
the 1968 campaign many thought
that he had reached rock bottom).
Calling the leaders of last week's
Vietnam Moratorium "impudent
snobs" unable "to offer
constructive solutions to the
problem," he charges that the
Moratorium was an "emotional
purgative" conducted in "a spirit
of national masochism."
Psychological Diarrhea
If we are impudent because we
challenge policies that are

. rnr
mistaken and misguided, then
America should thank us for our
impudence. We do propose
constructive action —stop the war
now, bring home all our troops
immediately, and redirect our
moral and economic resources
tward eliminating the disgraceful
inequities that still exist in our
own society.
From his imbecile
psycho-analysis of the
Moratorium as an "emotional
purgative," one can only conclude
that our vacuous Vice President is
so morally constipated that he
simply can't understand the
meaning of the Moratoriym. (Or
perhaps he is simply suffering
from an advanced case of
psychological diarrhea.)
Mr. Agnew charged that the
"lessons of the past" are being
ignored by the supporters of the
Moratorium. But Agnew has
ignored the most significant lesson
of the century—that we do not
have the ability and we do not
have the right to police the world.
Proclamations
Analyzing in idiotic generalities
something about which he knows
nothing has become the Agnew
trademark. And in his speech,
none of these analyses was more
inane than that which he made of
today's students. "The student
now goes to college to proclaim
rather than to learn," he said. We
do not even suggest that there is
not a huge amount of knowledge
to be gained at college. We are
here to learn knowledge, but more
important, we are here to learn to
be more decent, more human,
more sensitive and more aware.
And if this is the single most

important purpose of a
university—to enable individuals
to grow more sensitive and
aware—then Mr. Agnew stands as
a living symbol of the past failure
of our educational system.
We do not go to college to
proclaim, but neither can we be
silent when we believe our
country's policies are mistaken.
Primarily, we do not proclaim, we
question. But students almost
universally do proclaim this
much—that killing is wrong,
racism is wrong, insensitivity is
wrong, and we are not going to
tolerate it any longer.
It is quite easy to be vehement
and emotional in one's choice of
adjectives to describe Vice
President Agnew. But if nothing
else can be truthfully said about
him, this can: his narrow-minded
ness and insensitivity typify that
which is despicable in too many
Americans.
Soul Pollution
Last week, Edward Keating
aptly characterized the crisis of
this country as "soul pollution."
Spiro Agnew is, by virtue of his
thoughtless tirades, one of
America's worst polluters.
Mr. Agnew, we are tired of
your tirades of narrow-minded
ness, your verbal tantrums of
insensitivity, your rank stupidity.
Someday you will be replaced by
men who are concerned anout the
pollution that plagues America,
and who have the ability and
intelligence to act upon that
concern. The politics of humanity
are now only beginning to emerge.
But, beware. Already, sir, you are
an anachronism.(Larry Diamond is

Nixon's running mate last year,

unleashed during the campaign,
many thought that perhaps he had
been quieted, given some
unimportant government chores
to occupy enough of his time so
that we would not have to be
subjected to any more of his
ridiculous utterances. It was bad
enough when he talked of people
not as people, but as "fat Japs,"
"Pollock " and "Wops." Worse still
when he described the American
malaise as "an artificial and
masochistic sophistication, the
vague uneasiness that our values
are false, that there is something
wrong with being partriotic, moral
and hardworking."
But Mr. Agnew's recent words
have carried him to even greater
depths of ignominy (though after
the 1968 campaign many thought
that he had reached rock bottom).
Calling the leaders of last week's
Vietnam Moratorium "impudent
snobs" unable "to offer
constructive solutions to the
problem," he charges that the
Moratorium was an "emotional
purgative" conducted in "a spirit
of national masochism."
Psychological Diarrhea
If we are impudent because we
challenge policies that are

. rnr
mistaken and misguided, then
America should thank us for our
impudence. We do propose
constructive action —stop the war
now, bring home all our troops
immediately, and redirect our
moral and economic resources
tward eliminating the disgraceful
inequities that still exist in our
own society.
From his imbecile
psycho-analysis of the
Moratorium as an "emotional
purgative," one can only conclude
that our vacuous Vice President is
so morally constipated that he
simply can't understand the
meaning of the Moratoriym. (Or
perhaps he is simply suffering
from an advanced case of
psychological diarrhea.)
Mr. Agnew charged that the
"lessons of the past" are being
ignored by the supporters of the
Moratorium. But Agnew has
ignored the most significant lesson
of the century—that we do not
have the ability and we do not
have the right to police the world.
Proclamations
Analyzing in idiotic generalities
something about which he knows
nothing has become the Agnew
trademark. And in his speech,
none of these analyses was more
inane than that which he made of
today's students. "The student
now goes to college to proclaim
rather than to learn," he said. We
do not even suggest that there is
not a huge amount of knowledge
to be gained at college. We are
here to learn knowledge, but more
important, we are here to learn to
be more decent, more human,
more sensitive and more aware.
And if this is the single most

important purpose of a
university—to enable individuals
to grow more sensitive and
aware—then Mr. Agnew stands as
a living symbol of the past failure
of our educational system.
We do not go to college to
proclaim, but neither can we be
silent when we believe our
country's policies are mistaken.
Primarily, we do not proclaim, we
question. But students almost
universally do proclaim this
much—that killing is wrong,
racism is wrong, insensitivity is
wrong, and we are not going to
tolerate it any longer.
It is quite easy to be vehement
and emotional in one's choice of
adjectives to describe Vice
President Agnew. But if nothing
else can be truthfully said about
him, this can: his narrow-minded
ness and insensitivity typify that
which is despicable in too many
Americans.
Soul Pollution
Last week, Edward Keating
aptly characterized the crisis of
this country as "soul pollution."
Spiro Agnew is, by virtue of his
thoughtless tirades, one of
America's worst polluters.
Mr. Agnew, we are tired of
your tirades of narrow-minded
ness, your verbal tantrums of
insensitivity, your rank stupidity.
Someday you will be replaced by
men who are concerned anout the
pollution that plagues America,
and who have the ability and
intelligence to act upon that
concern. The politics of humanity
are now only beginning to emerge.
But, beware. Already, sir, you are
an anachronism.(Larry Diamond is
