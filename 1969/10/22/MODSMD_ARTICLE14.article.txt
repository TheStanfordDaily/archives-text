## An Open Letter To The Trustees 
### 
Dear Sirs:
In keeping with the radical
restructuring of the trustee board,
we would like to nominate a 1969
graduate, Allan Christelow, to the
board. His qualifications for the
position indubitably surpass those
of any other nominee or, for that
matter, those of any present
trustee. Although the term
"heavy" for some students
connotes Bill Hewlett, for others
the true "heavies" are Allan
Christelow and his comrades. As a
member of the board and
hopefully the investment
committee, Allan will
enthusiastically share his insider's
knowledge on the applied

electronic research and war
research performed in Stanford's
labs. Moreover, his eagerness to
participate in previous trustee
meetings has not gone unnoticed.
His contribution to last January's
meeting left an indelible mark on
Stanford's history. There were
many others, of course, who also
demonstrated their affinity for
the board, but Allan distinguished
himself by managing to graduate
before he could be eliminated.
We enjoin you (as you have
enjoined us in the past) to make
Allan Christelow Stanford's next
trustee.
Sincerely yours,
' SAC

Students for Allan Christelow
(Allan Christelow, a Phi Beta
Kappa graduate of Stanford, is
presently a graduate student at
Michigan University. An SDS
member, Christelow was arrested
this year in relation to the SRI
demonstrations. He was also a
member of the "29" who
disrupted the trustee's meeting
last January.)

Editor, THE DAILY:
This has something to do with
the remarkable degree of
circulation that the Daily might
be fostering. True, the scarcer a
commodity becomes, the more

cherished is its worth . . . but, that
can also be carried to its logical
extreme. Mumbo-jumbo, a new
pile on every firebox, 10,000
copies by each engineering corner,
etc. etc. It all has such an easy
solution if you simply bring back
the courtesy phone to its niche in
the Union.

• Looked Doors
Editor, THE DAILY:
If you should be so bold as to
try to enter the front doors of the
new Space Engineering Building in
the morning, you won't have
much luck. They're locked in the

morning. And they're locked in
the afternoon and evening, to' in
fact, they're always lockeu.
Now if you really must get into
the building and want to get to
the 112 rst floor, you have to walk
up the outside steps to the second
floor (where one door out of four
is usually unlocked) and take the
elevator down. It has been
rumored that the front doors are
kept locked to protect the
building from "sit-ins" and
"take-overs."
The Gates of Knowledge may
always be open, but the front
doors of the Space Engineering
Building are always locked.
