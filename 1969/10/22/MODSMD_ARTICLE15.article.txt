# "He Blew His Mind Out In A Car..."
## 
### Tony Olcott 
Remember those wacky
Beatles who used to write pretty
songs and heavy songs and druggy
songs, the people who justified
earphones with the fox and hound
chase, who reaffirmed the place of
the nonsense lvric? Not a bad

record lor groups, as groups go.
However, it now seems that the
Beatles have been up to something
far different: the creation of the
first aural whodunnit. So run off
and get your four newest Beatle
albums, Sgt. Pepper's through

Abbey Road, because we're going
to play "is Paul Really Dead?"
Let's start with Sgt. Pepper's,
front cover. Why is there a guitar
on the grave, a guitar laid as a
left-hand player would leave it?
Why is the wax-work Ringo (in
black, left center) so dejected as
he stares at the grave, while wax
Paul consoles him? (Paul and
Ringo were reputed to be the
closest of the four). Why, on the
back cover, does Paul turn his face
away, while the others face front?
Why, on the inside cover, does
Paul wear an arm patch (the
patch is not the same as the one
he wears on the front cover)
which prominently displays the
British military notation for
'officially pronounced dead' or
'O.P.D.'? Probably for the same
reason that he wears that little
golden decoration in the middle
of his chest, a decoration awarded
to the families of men killed in
action. As for the album itself,
let's just consider 'A Day in the
Life' and ponder the lines about
"He blew his mind out in a
car..." Keep in mind that the
song played at the beginning of
Brian Jones' funeral was 'A Day in
the Life'. But, you say, Paul can't
be dead. Perhaps not, but let's fish
out Magical Mystery Tour.
If Paul isn't dead, why does he
have on his desk in the Major
McCartney and Sgt. Spinetti
photographs a sign which says"I
WAS"? Why in the two animal
costume pictures does Paul appear
shoeless, in lack socks? I am told
that in England people are buried
shoeless. Look at the center
picture, the two-page page one.
Why are Paul's shoes placed so
neatly side by side beneath the
cymbal? Ever see a soldiers' grave,
where they put the helmet on top
of the rifle stuck in the ground
and place the boots side by side at
the bottom? Okay, so this is all a
little silly, but then please explain
to me why Paul is the only one of
the four to wear a black carnation
in the big night club scene near
the end? As for the songs, why
does the fade-out on "Strawberry
Fields Forever" have the guttural
"I burried Paul."? Whv does the

(Rumors of the death o/ Beatle Paul McCartney have been freely circulating since the end of the
summer. Ihe following article explains the contentions which have been voiced as proof of McCartney's
death. In spite of these contentions Apple Records maintained yesterday through various local radio
stations that the Beatle is very much alive.)

fade-out for "I Am the Walrus"
include the "Oh, untimely
death ..." scene from King Lear?
Is it true, as I am told, that the
walrus is a death sign among
Eskimo peoples? Remember the
derivation of love, as in
"love-two," "love-four," etc? It's
from the French "L'oeur" or the
egg, and in "I am the eggman".
How about the lyrics, especially
Edgar Allen Poe, who wrote a
story called "The Premature
Burial"? And remember "I am the
Walrus" said John. "No, you're
not," said little Nicola? And
here's a clue for you all/the
Walrus was Paul.
The walrus was Paul. Also
worth noting is the fact that if
you play 'Revolution No. 9'
backwards, you will find the
insistent "Number nine, number
nine, number nine..."
transformed quite clearly into the
phrase "Turn me on, dead man,
turn me on dead man . . ." Try it.
The pictures in the insert then.
Why does Paul in the bathtub
look so, shall we say, inanimate?
Why in the blue picture does he
look so phenomenally stoned?
Who is the third long hair in the
small pictures of John, George,
and a bald man playing horns?
And why, for that matter, is
thanks to Linda Eastman, when
she was supposed to have become
a Linda McCartney by this time?
Maybe this all still sounds a little
odd, for Beatles just don't die
quietly, at least since Tony
Sheridan. Perhaps not, but there's
more.
Take out Abbey Road now,
the front cover. Why is Paul
dressed in black, barefoot, and
out of step? And why Abbey
Road anyway, when as well all
know, that road boasts, besides
the E.M.I, studios, the synagogue
where funeral services for Brian
Epstein were held. This is not to
slight, of course, the house Paul
McCartney has (or should we say
'had') on Abbey Road. Now listen
to "Come Together," especially
the lyrics "he got bad
production/he got walrus
gumball(?)/he got motorcycles/he
got spinal cracking/he got feet

down below his knees/hold you in
his arms yeah/can you feel his
disease." Don't forget the one line
about "he got toe-jammed" and
then look back at Magical Mystery
Tour, where Paul's toes are curled
back in each picture, as they are
on the cover of Abbey Road.
There is, I am told although I
haven't found it myself,
somewhere on the album another
reference, this one to a barefoot
dead man.
The rumor then, as I heard it,
is that Paul died between Revolver
and Sgt. Pepper's (remember the
long wait between albums, the
longest to that point), that Paul's
death was somehow connected
with drugs, that Paul was in some
way connected with Brian
Epstein's death. Nonsense, you
still say. Fine, but before you
dismiss it, please tell me why
George has become the
spokesman for the group, besides
doing, as the Chaparral tells us,
most of the work on the Abbey
Road album. John's busy, right,
but where's Paul? After all, it fell
to George to make the comments
about the new album in the
Kolling Stone article. While busy
on this, run over the fact that a
Paul McCartney look-alike contest
was run just a little over two years
ago, a dubious coincidence with
the fact that the closest the Beatles
have come to a live appearance
since then in the videotapes on
The Smothers Brothers Show, and
despite the fact that the Rolling
Stones are going back on tour, the
Beatles are still sitting tight. When
you finish chewing all this over,
forget it and go read "Alice in
Wonderland," not forgetting of
course that "I am the Walrus" is
derivative of Carroll, or that the
walrus in the book died from
eat ing too many oysters.
Finally, of course, comes the
really hard question. Suppose that
Paul did in fact die at the
supposed time. Why then was it
hushed up? The only plausible
answer is that something less than
laudable was connwted with his
death that they wished to cover
up. Incidentally, it must be really
juicy, if you think of the facts
they released at Jones' death. So

they cover it, don't say anything,
don't tour, and get a look-alike
for album covers. But why then,
this all being true, do they place
many mystifying but apparently
sensible clues on four albums,
covering a period of two and a

half years? Work on this, because
it seems that even KYA and
KFRC are on to it, and we
wouldn't want to be told by
lh<"m, would we?

doing, as the Chaparral tells us,
most of the work on the Abbey
Road album. John's busy, right,
but where's Paul? After all, it fell
to George to make the comments
about the new album in the
Kolling Stone article. While busy
on this, run over the fact that a
Paul McCartney look-alike contest
was run just a little over two years
ago, a dubious coincidence with
the fact that the closest the Beatles
have come to a live appearance
since then in the videotapes on
The Smothers Brothers Show, and
despite the fact that the Rolling
Stones are going back on tour, the
Beatles are still sitting tight. When
you finish chewing all this over,
forget it and go read "Alice in
Wonderland," not forgetting of
course that "I am the Walrus" is
derivative of Carroll, or that the
walrus in the book died from
eat ing too many oysters.
Finally, of course, comes the
really hard question. Suppose that
Paul did in fact die at the
supposed time. Why then was it
hushed up? The only plausible
answer is that something less than
laudable was connwted with his
death that they wished to cover
up. Incidentally, it must be really
juicy, if you think of the facts
they released at Jones' death. So

they cover it, don't say anything,
don't tour, and get a look-alike
for album covers. But why then,
this all being true, do they place
many mystifying but apparently
sensible clues on four albums,
covering a period of two and a

half years? Work on this, because
it seems that even KYA and

wouldn't want to be told by

Remember those wacky
Beatles who used to write pretty
songs and heavy songs and druggy
songs, the people who justified
earphones with the fox and hound
chase, who reaffirmed the place of
the nonsense lvric? Not a bad

record lor groups, as groups go.
However, it now seems that the
Beatles have been up to something
far different: the creation of the
first aural whodunnit. So run off
and get your four newest Beatle
albums, Sgt. Pepper's through

Abbey Road, because we're going
to play "is Paul Really Dead?"
Let's start with Sgt. Pepper's,
front cover. Why is there a guitar
on the grave, a guitar laid as a
left-hand player would leave it?
Why is the wax-work Ringo (in
black, left center) so dejected as
he stares at the grave, while wax
Paul consoles him? (Paul and
Ringo were reputed to be the
closest of the four). Why, on the
back cover, does Paul turn his face
away, while the others face front?
Why, on the inside cover, does
Paul wear an arm patch (the
patch is not the same as the one
he wears on the front cover)
which prominently displays the
British military notation for
'officially pronounced dead' or
'O.P.D.'? Probably for the same
reason that he wears that little
golden decoration in the middle
of his chest, a decoration awarded
to the families of men killed in
action. As for the album itself,
let's just consider 'A Day in the
Life' and ponder the lines about
"He blew his mind out in a
car..." Keep in mind that the
song played at the beginning of
Brian Jones' funeral was 'A Day in
the Life'. But, you say, Paul can't
be dead. Perhaps not, but let's fish
out Magical Mystery Tour.
If Paul isn't dead, why does he
have on his desk in the Major
McCartney and Sgt. Spinetti
photographs a sign which says"I
WAS"? Why in the two animal
costume pictures does Paul appear
shoeless, in lack socks? I am told
that in England people are buried
shoeless. Look at the center
picture, the two-page page one.
Why are Paul's shoes placed so
neatly side by side beneath the
cymbal? Ever see a soldiers' grave,
where they put the helmet on top
of the rifle stuck in the ground
and place the boots side by side at
the bottom? Okay, so this is all a
little silly, but then please explain
to me why Paul is the only one of
the four to wear a black carnation
in the big night club scene near
the end? As for the songs, why
does the fade-out on "Strawberry

"I burried Paul."? Whv does the

(Rumors of the death o/ Beatle Paul McCartney have been freely circulating since the end of the
summer. Ihe following article explains the contentions which have been voiced as proof of McCartney's
death. In spite of these contentions Apple Records maintained yesterday through various local radio
stations that the Beatle is very much alive.)

fade-out for "I Am the Walrus"
include the "Oh, untimely
death ..." scene from King Lear?
Is it true, as I am told, that the
walrus is a death sign among
Eskimo peoples? Remember the
derivation of love, as in
"love-two," "love-four," etc? It's
from the French "L'oeur" or the
egg, and in "I am the eggman".
How about the lyrics, especially
Edgar Allen Poe, who wrote a
story called "The Premature
Burial"? And remember "I am the
Walrus" said John. "No, you're
not," said little Nicola? And
here's a clue for you all/the
Walrus was Paul.
The walrus was Paul. Also
worth noting is the fact that if
you play 'Revolution No. 9'
backwards, you will find the
insistent "Number nine, number
nine, number nine..."
transformed quite clearly into the
phrase "Turn me on, dead man,
turn me on dead man . . ." Try it.
The pictures in the insert then.
Why does Paul in the bathtub
look so, shall we say, inanimate?
Why in the blue picture does he
look so phenomenally stoned?
Who is the third long hair in the
small pictures of John, George,
and a bald man playing horns?
And why, for that matter, is
thanks to Linda Eastman, when
she was supposed to have become
a Linda McCartney by this time?
Maybe this all still sounds a little
odd, for Beatles just don't die
quietly, at least since Tony
Sheridan. Perhaps not, but there's
more.
Take out Abbey Road now,
the front cover. Why is Paul
dressed in black, barefoot, and
out of step? And why Abbey
Road anyway, when as well all
know, that road boasts, besides
the E.M.I, studios, the synagogue
where funeral services for Brian
Epstein were held. This is not to
slight, of course, the house Paul
McCartney has (or should we say
'had') on Abbey Road. Now listen
to "Come Together," especially
the lyrics "he got bad
production/he got walrus
gumball(?)/he got motorcycles/he
got spinal cracking/he got feet

down below his knees/hold you in
his arms yeah/can you feel his
disease." Don't forget the one line
about "he got toe-jammed" and
then look back at Magical Mystery
Tour, where Paul's toes are curled
back in each picture, as they are
on the cover of Abbey Road.
There is, I am told although I
haven't found it myself,
somewhere on the album another
reference, this one to a barefoot
dead man.
The rumor then, as I heard it,
is that Paul died between Revolver
and Sgt. Pepper's (remember the
long wait between albums, the
longest to that point), that Paul's
death was somehow connected
with drugs, that Paul was in some
way connected with Brian
Epstein's death. Nonsense, you
still say. Fine, but before you
dismiss it, please tell me why
George has become the
spokesman for the group, besides
doing, as the Chaparral tells us,
most of the work on the Abbey

but where's Paul? After all, it fell

phrase "Turn me on, dead man,
turn me on dead man . . ." Try it.
The pictures in the insert then.
Why does Paul in the bathtub
look so, shall we say, inanimate?
Why in the blue picture does he
look so phenomenally stoned?
Who is the third long hair in the
small pictures of John, George,
and a bald man playing horns?
And why, for that matter, is
thanks to Linda Eastman, when
she was supposed to have become
a Linda McCartney by this time?
Maybe this all still sounds a little
odd, for Beatles just don't die
quietly, at least since Tony
Sheridan. Perhaps not, but there's
more.
Take out Abbey Road now,
the front cover. Why is Paul
dressed in black, barefoot, and
out of step? And why Abbey
Road anyway, when as well all
know, that road boasts, besides
the E.M.I, studios, the synagogue
where funeral services for Brian
Epstein were held. This is not to
slight, of course, the house Paul
McCartney has (or should we say
'had') on Abbey Road. Now listen
to "Come Together," especially
the lyrics "he got bad
production/he got walrus
gumball(?)/he got motorcycles/he
got spinal cracking/he got feet

down below his knees/hold you in
his arms yeah/can you feel his
disease." Don't forget the one line
about "he got toe-jammed" and
then look back at Magical Mystery
Tour, where Paul's toes are curled
back in each picture, as they are
on the cover of Abbey Road.
There is, I am told although I
haven't found it myself,
somewhere on the album another
reference, this one to a barefoot
dead man.
The rumor then, as I heard it,
is that Paul died between Revolver
and Sgt. Pepper's (remember the
long wait between albums, the
longest to that point), that Paul's
death was somehow connected
with drugs, that Paul was in some
way connected with Brian
Epstein's death. Nonsense, you
still say. Fine, but before you
dismiss it, please tell me why
George has become the
spokesman for the group, besides
doing, as the Chaparral tells us,
most of the work on the Abbey
Road album. John's busy, right,
but where's Paul? After all, it fell
to George to make the comments
about the new album in the
Kolling Stone article. While busy
on this, run over the fact that a
Paul McCartney look-alike contest
was run just a little over two years
ago, a dubious coincidence with
the fact that the closest the Beatles
have come to a live appearance
since then in the videotapes on
The Smothers Brothers Show, and
despite the fact that the Rolling
Stones are going back on tour, the
Beatles are still sitting tight. When
you finish chewing all this over,
forget it and go read "Alice in
Wonderland," not forgetting of
course that "I am the Walrus" is
derivative of Carroll, or that the
walrus in the book died from
eat ing too many oysters.
Finally, of course, comes the
really hard question. Suppose that
Paul did in fact die at the
supposed time. Why then was it
hushed up? The only plausible
answer is that something less than
laudable was connwted with his
death that they wished to cover
up. Incidentally, it must be really
juicy, if you think of the facts
they released at Jones' death. So

they cover it, don't say anything,
don't tour, and get a look-alike
for album covers. But why then,
this all being true, do they place
many mystifying but apparently
sensible clues on four albums,
covering a period of two and a

half years? Work on this, because
it seems that even KYA and
KFRC are on to it, and we
wouldn't want to be told by

songs, the people who justified

the nonsense lvric? Not a bad

However, it now seems that the
Beatles have been up to something
far different: the creation of the
first aural whodunnit. So run off
and get your four newest Beatle
albums, Sgt. Pepper's through

Abbey Road, because we're going
to play "is Paul Really Dead?"
Let's start with Sgt. Pepper's,
front cover. Why is there a guitar
on the grave, a guitar laid as a
left-hand player would leave it?
Why is the wax-work Ringo (in
black, left center) so dejected as
he stares at the grave, while wax
Paul consoles him? (Paul and
Ringo were reputed to be the
closest of the four). Why, on the
back cover, does Paul turn his face
away, while the others face front?
Why, on the inside cover, does
Paul wear an arm patch (the
patch is not the same as the one
he wears on the front cover)
which prominently displays the
British military notation for
'officially pronounced dead' or
'O.P.D.'? Probably for the same
reason that he wears that little
golden decoration in the middle
of his chest, a decoration awarded
to the families of men killed in
action. As for the album itself,
let's just consider 'A Day in the
Life' and ponder the lines about
"He blew his mind out in a
car..." Keep in mind that the
song played at the beginning of
Brian Jones' funeral was 'A Day in
the Life'. But, you say, Paul can't
be dead. Perhaps not, but let's fish
out Magical Mystery Tour.
If Paul isn't dead, why does he
have on his desk in the Major
McCartney and Sgt. Spinetti
photographs a sign which says"I
WAS"? Why in the two animal
costume pictures does Paul appear
shoeless, in lack socks? I am told
that in England people are buried
shoeless. Look at the center
picture, the two-page page one.
Why are Paul's shoes placed so
neatly side by side beneath the
cymbal? Ever see a soldiers' grave,
where they put the helmet on top
of the rifle stuck in the ground
and place the boots side by side at
the bottom? Okay, so this is all a
little silly, but then please explain
to me why Paul is the only one of
the four to wear a black carnation

fade-out for "I Am the Walrus"
include the "Oh, untimely

Is it true, as I am told, that the
walrus is a death sign among
Eskimo peoples? Remember the
derivation of love, as in
"love-two," "love-four," etc? It's
from the French "L'oeur" or the
egg, and in "I am the eggman".
How about the lyrics, especially
Edgar Allen Poe, who wrote a
story called "The Premature
Burial"? And remember "I am the
Walrus" said John. "No, you're
not," said little Nicola? And
here's a clue for you all/the
Walrus was Paul.
The walrus was Paul. Also
worth noting is the fact that if
you play 'Revolution No. 9'
backwards, you will find the
insistent "Number nine, number

If Paul isn't dead, why does he
have on his desk in the Major
McCartney and Sgt. Spinetti
photographs a sign which says"I

costume pictures does Paul appear
shoeless, in lack socks? I am told
that in England people are buried
shoeless. Look at the center
picture, the two-page page one.
Why are Paul's shoes placed so
neatly side by side beneath the
cymbal? Ever see a soldiers' grave,
where they put the helmet on top
of the rifle stuck in the ground
and place the boots side by side at
the bottom? Okay, so this is all a
little silly, but then please explain
to me why Paul is the only one of

fade-out for "I Am the Walrus"
include the "Oh, untimely
death ..." scene from King Lear?
Is it true, as I am told, that the
walrus is a death sign among
Eskimo peoples? Remember the
derivation of love, as in
"love-two," "love-four," etc? It's
from the French "L'oeur" or the
egg, and in "I am the eggman".
How about the lyrics, especially
Edgar Allen Poe, who wrote a
story called "The Premature
Burial"? And remember "I am the
Walrus" said John. "No, you're
not," said little Nicola? And
here's a clue for you all/the
Walrus was Paul.
The walrus was Paul. Also
worth noting is the fact that if
you play 'Revolution No. 9'
backwards, you will find the
insistent "Number nine, number
nine, number nine..."
transformed quite clearly into the
phrase "Turn me on, dead man,
turn me on dead man . . ." Try it.
The pictures in the insert then.
Why does Paul in the bathtub
look so, shall we say, inanimate?
Why in the blue picture does he
look so phenomenally stoned?
Who is the third long hair in the
small pictures of John, George,
and a bald man playing horns?
And why, for that matter, is
thanks to Linda Eastman, when
she was supposed to have become
a Linda McCartney by this time?
Maybe this all still sounds a little
odd, for Beatles just don't die
quietly, at least since Tony
Sheridan. Perhaps not, but there's
more.
Take out Abbey Road now,
the front cover. Why is Paul
dressed in black, barefoot, and
out of step? And why Abbey
Road anyway, when as well all
know, that road boasts, besides
the E.M.I, studios, the synagogue
where funeral services for Brian
Epstein were held. This is not to
slight, of course, the house Paul
McCartney has (or should we say
'had') on Abbey Road. Now listen
to "Come Together," especially
the lyrics "he got bad
production/he got walrus
gumball(?)/he got motorcycles/he
got spinal cracking/he got feet

down below his knees/hold you in
his arms yeah/can you feel his
disease." Don't forget the one line
about "he got toe-jammed" and
then look back at Magical Mystery
Tour, where Paul's toes are curled
back in each picture, as they are
on the cover of Abbey Road.
There is, I am told although I
haven't found it myself,
somewhere on the album another
reference, this one to a barefoot
dead man.
The rumor then, as I heard it,
is that Paul died between Revolver
and Sgt. Pepper's (remember the
long wait between albums, the
longest to that point), that Paul's
death was somehow connected
with drugs, that Paul was in some
way connected with Brian
Epstein's death. Nonsense, you
still say. Fine, but before you
dismiss it, please tell me why
George has become the
spokesman for the group, besides
doing, as the Chaparral tells us,
most of the work on the Abbey
Road album. John's busy, right,
but where's Paul? After all, it fell
to George to make the comments
about the new album in the
Kolling Stone article. While busy
on this, run over the fact that a
Paul McCartney look-alike contest
was run just a little over two years
ago, a dubious coincidence with
the fact that the closest the Beatles
have come to a live appearance
since then in the videotapes on
The Smothers Brothers Show, and
despite the fact that the Rolling
Stones are going back on tour, the
Beatles are still sitting tight. When
you finish chewing all this over,
forget it and go read "Alice in
Wonderland," not forgetting of
course that "I am the Walrus" is
derivative of Carroll, or that the
walrus in the book died from
eat ing too many oysters.
Finally, of course, comes the
really hard question. Suppose that
Paul did in fact die at the
supposed time. Why then was it
hushed up? The only plausible
answer is that something less than
laudable was connwted with his
death that they wished to cover
up. Incidentally, it must be really
juicy, if you think of the facts
they released at Jones' death. So

they cover it, don't say anything,
don't tour, and get a look-alike
for album covers. But why then,
this all being true, do they place
many mystifying but apparently
sensible clues on four albums,
covering a period of two and a

half years? Work on this, because
it seems that even KYA and
KFRC are on to it, and we
wouldn't want to be told by

Paul wear an arm patch (the
patch is not the same as the one
he wears on the front cover)
which prominently displays the
British military notation for
'officially pronounced dead' or
'O.P.D.'? Probably for the same
reason that he wears that little
golden decoration in the middle
of his chest, a decoration awarded
to the families of men killed in
action. As for the album itself,
let's just consider 'A Day in the
Life' and ponder the lines about
"He blew his mind out in a
car..." Keep in mind that the
song played at the beginning of
Brian Jones' funeral was 'A Day in
