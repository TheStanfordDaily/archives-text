# Newest Formula
## The 						Multinational Corporation

(Harry Cleaver is a graduate
student in economics and a staff
member of the Pacific Studies
Center, a recently established
nonprofit research organization
in East Palo Alto. He recently
covered the September
In ternational Ind us tria lists
Conference in San Francisco for
The Daily after originally being
denied credentials because of his
affiliation with SDS and his
participation in the April 3rd
Movement. The following are his
impressions of that conference.
This is the first of two parts).
While the San Francisco Tac
Squad prowled the baroque halls
of the Fairmont, jousling stuffed
vests, and frightening old ladies,
the world's capitalist elite met
behind well guarded doors to
make business contracts and argue
over the division of the world's
wealth.
The conference, which SRI
International's President Weldon

Gibson called "the world's
foremost international assembly of
senior business executives,"
consisted of long, rather boring
speeches, panels, round-table
discussions and banquets.
Conference delegates and
sometimes their "ladies" plodded
from session to session and from
luncheon to board room for five
tedious days. Opera, museum
tours, and demonstrations
provided the only breaks in the
routine.
But the stuffy life style of the
conference was misleading. For
five days there was a subtle but
continuous and very tense struggle
underway between he powerful
managers of international finance
and industry and the smaller,
though locally powerful, national
capitalist elites.
Third World Participation
The internationalists were
pushing the newest formulation of
their global strategy: the

multinational corporation. "The
North American manager," Wells
Fargo Chairman and Stanford
Trustee Ernest Arbuckle, told the
conference,.think of the
world as one market." As it
emerged during the conference,
the liberal internationalists had
really already won. A tradeoff
would be made: some third world
participation in the investing
subsidiaries and freer trade, in
exchange for wide-open
investment laws and more
freedom for international
business.
There was some grumbling by a
few of the internationalists that
Third World part ownership in
subsidiaries would "undermine
the concept of a concerted global
strategy for the multinational
group," William Blackie, chairman
of Catepiller Tractor, argued, for
instance, that the only elements
opposed to wholly owned
subsidiaries were the

anti-American press ("An
emotional prejudice") and
indiginous competitors who
"prefer not to be exposed to the
rigors of the market place."
But all and all, the conference
was dominated by those who
agreed with British American
Tobacco's president, Sir Duncan
Oppenheim, that international
companies insisting' on total
ownership of their subsidiaries
were unnecessarily
"ethnocentric."
Train Third World
And even the most militantly
nationalistic of the Third World
capitalists, like the Pakistanis who
waved the threat of revolution in
the face of their big brothers,
were fighting merely for part
ownership in the parent company
as well as the subsidiary. (An idea
also favored by IBM management
as it further strengthens
management's control by
diversifying ownership.)
While cautioning Third World
capitalists to expect "new
development contract" for the
seventies which would include
come foreign aid ("charity, I'm
afraid, makes a poor contractual
base"), Chairman Rockefeller
predicted an aid emphasis on
training and education—a
broadening of the managerial
class. It was surely no accident
that one of the brightest graduates
of that strategy sat with
Rockefeller on the stage during
the opening session—Mohammad
Sadli, an MIT trained economist
responsible for Indonesia's wide
open foreign investment law.
The internationalists were also
concerned with "How to Improve
the Climate for Private Foreign
Investment" (the topic of one
panel session). This theme ran
throughout the conference and a
National Industrial Conference
Board study presented at the
conference showed that the
obstacle to investment most in the
minds of the capitalists remains
"political uncertaintly or
instability." The seizure of power
by the Greek military junta for
instance, "is generally recognized
as having brought improvement in
the investment climate," the
pamphlet said.
Gap Between R icli and
Poor "Illusion"
Other reasons the
Internationalists rule out
investment were cited as Algeria's
"increasing ties with the Soviet
Union," Burma's "unfriendly
attitude to the West," Pakistan's
"threat of communist influence,"
India's "socialist doctrine." Even
some upcoming elections
indicated political uncertainty or
instability—"Several investors, for
example, have adopted a wait and
see attitude toward investing in
Chile because they cannot predict
the outcome of the presidential
election scheduled for 1970."

training and education—a
broadening of the managerial
class. It was surely no accident
that one of the brightest graduates
of that strategy sat with
Rockefeller on the stage during
the opening session—Mohammad
Sadli, an MIT trained economist
responsible for Indonesia's wide
open foreign investment law.
The internationalists were also
concerned with "How to Improve
the Climate for Private Foreign
Investment" (the topic of one
panel session). This theme ran
throughout the conference and a
National Industrial Conference
Board study presented at the
conference showed that the
obstacle to investment most in the
minds of the capitalists remains
"political uncertaintly or
instability." The seizure of power
by the Greek military junta for
instance, "is generally recognized
as having brought improvement in
the investment climate," the
pamphlet said.
Gap Between R icli and
Poor "Illusion"
Other reasons the
Internationalists rule out
investment were cited as Algeria's
"increasing ties with the Soviet
Union," Burma's "unfriendly
attitude to the West," Pakistan's
"threat of communist influence,"
India's "socialist doctrine." Even
some upcoming elections
indicated political uncertainty or
instability—"Several investors, for

Chile because they cannot predict
the outcome of the presidential
election scheduled for 1970."


The police, the delegates, their wives and the students: the International Industrialist Conference

covered the September
In ternational Ind us tria lists
Conference in San Francisco for
The Daily after originally being
denied credentials because of his
affiliation with SDS and his
participation in the April 3rd
Movement. The following are his
impressions of that conference.
This is the first of two parts).
While the San Francisco Tac
Squad prowled the baroque halls
of the Fairmont, jousling stuffed
vests, and frightening old ladies,
the world's capitalist elite met
behind well guarded doors to
make business contracts and argue
over the division of the world's
wealth.
The conference, which SRI
International's President Weldon

Gibson called "the world's
foremost international assembly of
senior business executives,"
consisted of long, rather boring
speeches, panels, round-table
discussions and banquets.
Conference delegates and
sometimes their "ladies" plodded
from session to session and from
luncheon to board room for five
tedious days. Opera, museum
tours, and demonstrations
provided the only breaks in the
routine.
But the stuffy life style of the
conference was misleading. For
five days there was a subtle but
continuous and very tense struggle
underway between he powerful
managers of international finance
and industry and the smaller,
though locally powerful, national
capitalist elites.
Third World Participation
The internationalists were
pushing the newest formulation of
their global strategy: the

multinational corporation. "The
North American manager," Wells
Fargo Chairman and Stanford
Trustee Ernest Arbuckle, told the
conference,.think of the
world as one market." As it
emerged during the conference,
the liberal internationalists had
really already won. A tradeoff
would be made: some third world
participation in the investing
subsidiaries and freer trade, in
exchange for wide-open
investment laws and more
freedom for international
business.
There was some grumbling by a
few of the internationalists that
Third World part ownership in
subsidiaries would "undermine
the concept of a concerted global
strategy for the multinational
group," William Blackie, chairman
of Catepiller Tractor, argued, for
instance, that the only elements
opposed to wholly owned
subsidiaries were the

anti-American press ("An
emotional prejudice") and
indiginous competitors who
"prefer not to be exposed to the
rigors of the market place."
But all and all, the conference
was dominated by those who
agreed with British American
Tobacco's president, Sir Duncan
Oppenheim, that international
companies insisting' on total
ownership of their subsidiaries
were unnecessarily
"ethnocentric."
Train Third World
And even the most militantly
nationalistic of the Third World
capitalists, like the Pakistanis who
waved the threat of revolution in
the face of their big brothers,
were fighting merely for part
ownership in the parent company
as well as the subsidiary. (An idea
also favored by IBM management
as it further strengthens
management's control by
diversifying ownership.)
While cautioning Third World
capitalists to expect "new
development contract" for the
seventies which would include
come foreign aid ("charity, I'm
afraid, makes a poor contractual
base"), Chairman Rockefeller
predicted an aid emphasis on
training and education—a
broadening of the managerial
class. It was surely no accident

investment laws and more
freedom for international
business.
There was some grumbling by a
few of the internationalists that
Third World part ownership in
subsidiaries would "undermine
the concept of a concerted global
strategy for the multinational
group," William Blackie, chairman
of Catepiller Tractor, argued, for
instance, that the only elements
opposed to wholly owned
subsidiaries were the

anti-American press ("An
emotional prejudice") and
indiginous competitors who
"prefer not to be exposed to the
rigors of the market place."
But all and all, the conference
was dominated by those who
agreed with British American
Tobacco's president, Sir Duncan
Oppenheim, that international
companies insisting' on total
ownership of their subsidiaries
were unnecessarily
"ethnocentric."
Train Third World
And even the most militantly
nationalistic of the Third World
capitalists, like the Pakistanis who
waved the threat of revolution in
the face of their big brothers,
were fighting merely for part
ownership in the parent company
as well as the subsidiary. (An idea
also favored by IBM management
as it further strengthens
management's control by
diversifying ownership.)
While cautioning Third World
capitalists to expect "new
development contract" for the
seventies which would include
come foreign aid ("charity, I'm
afraid, makes a poor contractual
base"), Chairman Rockefeller
predicted an aid emphasis on
training and education—a
broadening of the managerial
class. It was surely no accident
that one of the brightest graduates
of that strategy sat with
Rockefeller on the stage during
the opening session—Mohammad
Sadli, an MIT trained economist
responsible for Indonesia's wide
open foreign investment law.
The internationalists were also
concerned with "How to Improve
the Climate for Private Foreign
Investment" (the topic of one
panel session). This theme ran
throughout the conference and a
National Industrial Conference
Board study presented at the
conference showed that the
obstacle to investment most in the
minds of the capitalists remains
"political uncertaintly or
instability." The seizure of power
by the Greek military junta for
instance, "is generally recognized
as having brought improvement in
the investment climate," the
pamphlet said.
Gap Between R icli and
Poor "Illusion"
Other reasons the
Internationalists rule out
investment were cited as Algeria's
"increasing ties with the Soviet
Union," Burma's "unfriendly
attitude to the West," Pakistan's
"threat of communist influence,"
India's "socialist doctrine." Even
some upcoming elections
indicated political uncertainty or
instability—"Several investors, for
example, have adopted a wait and
see attitude toward investing in
Chile because they cannot predict
the outcome of the presidential
election scheduled for 1970."


The police, the delegates, their wives and the students: the International Industrialist Conference
(Harry Cleaver is a graduate
student in economics and a staff
member of the Pacific Studies
Center, a recently established
nonprofit research organization
in East Palo Alto. He recently
covered the September
In ternational Ind us tria lists
Conference in San Francisco for
The Daily after originally being
denied credentials because of his
affiliation with SDS and his
participation in the April 3rd
Movement. The following are his
impressions of that conference.
This is the first of two parts).
While the San Francisco Tac
Squad prowled the baroque halls
of the Fairmont, jousling stuffed
vests, and frightening old ladies,
the world's capitalist elite met
behind well guarded doors to
make business contracts and argue
over the division of the world's
wealth.
The conference, which SRI
International's President Weldon

Gibson called "the world's
foremost international assembly of
senior business executives,"
consisted of long, rather boring
speeches, panels, round-table
discussions and banquets.
Conference delegates and
sometimes their "ladies" plodded
from session to session and from
luncheon to board room for five
tedious days. Opera, museum
tours, and demonstrations
provided the only breaks in the
routine.
But the stuffy life style of the
conference was misleading. For
five days there was a subtle but
continuous and very tense struggle
underway between he powerful
managers of international finance
and industry and the smaller,
though locally powerful, national
capitalist elites.
Third World Participation
The internationalists were
pushing the newest formulation of
their global strategy: the

multinational corporation. "The
North American manager," Wells
Fargo Chairman and Stanford
Trustee Ernest Arbuckle, told the
conference,.think of the
world as one market." As it
emerged during the conference,
the liberal internationalists had
really already won. A tradeoff
would be made: some third world
participation in the investing
subsidiaries and freer trade, in
exchange for wide-open
investment laws and more
freedom for international
business.
