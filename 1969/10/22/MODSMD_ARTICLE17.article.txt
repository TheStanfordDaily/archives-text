# Impressions on Matt
## Matt Wolf & Pablum

(The following are two
responses in the continuing feud
over Stanford dollies.)
"H'warya!" Interesting, isn't
it?
By introduction, I am not a
Stanford student; yet over the
past years I have read the Daily
fairly often, and approaching
constantly for the past year and a
half, at least.
It seems that at least once a
year someone, usually a freshman,
gets a letter or article in the Daily
similar to "H'warya" claiming
that the girls of the campus are
inhumane, in various ways, in
their regard for Stanford Men.
Something needs to be pointed
out, initially. There are three
distinct groups on the campus,
with members from both of the
two most interesting sexes.
1) Those who simply aren't
interested in a "social life" These
are by definition out of
"circulation."
2) Those who are "psyched out"
by "the RATIO". These include
males who can't hack the
competition, and the girls who
likewise, but for complementary
reasons, don't compete. These are
not in "active competition," but
may enter, if proper
circumstances arise.
3) The final group consists of all
the rest—those who have, by
choice, significant interaction in
the Stanford Social Pool.
Now, obviously, the only part
of this grouping which will
noticeably, publicly complain is
the male segment of 2), who has
already psyched himself into

believing that his personal social
possibilities are nil. To retain
individual ego integrity, it is
necessary to conclude that it is
Not His Fault. This means it is
someone else's fault. Whose could
it be, but that of the (fictitious)
Stanford Dolly. After all,
everyone knows that dollies are
both plastic, and, untimately,
sex less.
I must say that from personal
experience, the Stanford variety
of Homo Sapiens, female, is
neither plastic nor sexless. But
maybe not being a student here
helps, although I can't see how.
Whatever the explanation or
conclusion, if you want a "dolly,"
buy one—after all, with all their
other characteristics, they must be
for sale. I'll stick to people.

'Holier Than Thou'
I don't know if you are to be
criticized for your
"holier-than-thou" attitude or
pitied for your complacent
blindness. After ten days,
(approximately 240 hours
presupposing that in your
tremendous eagerness to meet and
know people, you disdained all
mundane activities such as eating
and sleeping, reluctant to lose on
precious minute of getting
acquainted with the "country
club"and its members), you claim
to know them all well enough to
dismiss them as "lacquered and
preserved for antiquity."

You bewail the substitution of
"plastic women" for "real
people," yet plastics are
man-made. What have you done
to elicit from people anything but
the "artificial, plastic and
superficial"? Most people are as
sensitive and genuine as you
imagine yourself to be; however,
they do not respond to a bellicose
"the-world-owes-me-happiness"
attitude but rather to the
friendliness and interest in others
that you summarily dismiss as
"reaking of the stench of
phoniness."
Are you so afraid of being hurt
that you won't come out from
behind the walls you have erected
to shield yourself from feelings
and people, long enough to give
the world, or even Stanford, a
chance? Or do you enjoy
cowering behind those defenses,
balancing that chip carefully on
your shoulder, occasionally
hurling poorly-aimed invectives at
the world because it does't rush to
hail you as its newly-discovered
axis.
Your attitude is that of a child
who refuses to feed himself, but
who prefers to pound his spoon
against the table screaming with
frustration and wounded pride
when those around him do not
immediately scurry to feed him. If
you refuse to "feed" yourself,
you must be patient while waiting
for someone to relieve you of the
responsibility of growing up.
