# Who's Exclusive

(The following two articles
were written in response to
Patricia Mihaly's column on the
Middle East situation, "Zionist
Country Club," in Mondax's
Daily.)
Patricia Mihaly's column
contains patently false
implications about Israel, and a
suggested solution to he Middle
East situation which is totally
absurd.
First, it is simply not true, as
Miss Mihaly asserts, that
Christians and Moslems find it
difficult or impossible to enter
Israel or acquire Israeli
citizenship. Arabs in Israel are full
citizens who vote in national and
local elections and are represented
by Arabs in the Knesset (Israeli
Parliament). All Arabs receive free
public education, and one cannot
help but notice, when driving
through Arab villages, that there is
a new modern school building in
each one. All Arabs in Israel are
provided free medical care. Arab
farmers are subsidized by the
government and given technical
assistance. Arabs have joined labor
unions and vote in labor elections.
At no time, during war or peace,
have Arab citizens had their rights
curtailed, unlike Jewish citizens in
Arab countries who are frequently
harrassed and persecuted. This,
despite frequent provocations,
like the recent planting of bombs
in watermelons to be distributed
to children at a circus in Haifa, or
the setting of a bomb in a
crowded supermarket in
Jerusalem.
Furthermore, many mousands
of Arabs make daily visits to Israel
from Jordan, or travel though the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
This summer, 10,000 Arabs from
Arab countries, some even from
Egypt and Syria, visited relatives
in Israel as part of a special
visitor's program. They were free
to travel throughout Israel, and
the only trouble they ncountered
was with Jordanian officials upon
their return. Note that Jews of all
nationalities, including Americans,
have been barred from Arab
countries for years. Who is being
exclusive?
Arab Terrorists
Speaking of exclusivism and
exclusion, Arab countries have
refused to accept even one Arab
refugee, and instead have
exploited their situation. In
contrast, over half the population
of Israel consists of Jews who
were forced to flee from
persecution in Arab countries,
people who otherwise might also
have become refugees. When Gaza
was under Egyptian
administration, its inhabitants
were prohibited from even
traveling outside the area. Gaza
inhabitants now travel throughout
Israel, despite the fact that Gaza is
a center for Arab terrorists.
Miss Mihaly implies that when
Jews began to actively resettle
Palestine, that country belonged
to the Arabs. In fact, Palestine
had been ruled for hundreds of
years by the Turkish Empire, and
was later under British Mandate.
During Jewish settlement, resident
Arabs were so eager to establish
an Arab Palestine that they
willingly sold land to the
Jews—land which until then had
remained totally unworked and
undeveloped. It was only later,
when Arab nationalism became
active in other Arab countries,
that Arabs developed a strongly
anti-Zionist thesis.
Since Miss Mihaly is a student
of political science, it is somewhat
surprising that her solution to the
problem is so politically
unrealistic. She suggests that
Arabs be able to "share in
governing the land in direct
proportion to the share of land
they legally own." But Arabs lay
claim to the entire land, so in
effect this means national
self-annihilation (if not physical
annihilation) by the present
occupants of Israel. ["JIHAD"]
In other words, the Jews who
transformed Israel from desert
and swamp land into a productive
modern state, should now
good-naturedly turn over the
product o r iheir efforts to the
same people who daily, on Arab
radio and even the BBC, talk
about "jihad"—holy war —by all
Moslems against Israel. Nasser,
like other Arab leaders, describes
"liberation of the land" as a
"sacred duty". Jihad is religious
warfare, and the Arab call for

jihad is answer enough to Miss
Mihaly's claim that Arabs oppose
only Zionism and not Jews.

What Really Happened
Let us look a moment at what
really happened in the Middle
East and not what we would have
liked to happen. A long time ago
the Jews lived in Israel. The
Romans conquered them and
exiled them. Seven hundred years
later the Arabs moved in. A lot of
time goes by and the Jews get
beat up, beat down, and just plain
killed in every country they set
foot in. They keep dreaming of
the old homeland where they
took orders from nobody, just
like every other people.
Somewhere in the nineteenth
century some young radical Jews
start saying, "Are we treated like
shit here? Do we want to leave?
Then let's do it." So they do it.
They go to Israel and do things
they've never done before, plow
the fields, live in communes, dig
ditches. They dig it, they feel it,
and more people come. They buy
land and they build it with sweat
and lives and it feels right. Th_y
want to be a country as they
know they once were and they
can feel that ancient lady in the
hills and stones around them.
They are tired of eating off of
others' tables and being called
jackals for it.
But his ancient land has not
been frozen though the long
years. A new people has settled
there, the Arabs. They see in the
Jews a curious invader who points
mysteriously back in history, a
troubling foreign body which
need not, however, be rejected if
its strength can be diluted. But
the Jews have not precipitated out
of the sea of nations to be
dissolved by one more nation.
And their determination is
strengthened when several nations
dissolve them in gas chambers.

The world weeps too, for the
mothers and fathers and children,
and the United Nations votes to
give the survivors a place where
they will be safe, a small part of
Palestine.
Zionists Ar«' Human
"This is crazy," think the
Arabs. "Who needs a Jewish state?
Let them be a part of our state."
But the Jews are the world's most
experienced people at being part
of other people's states, and they
stopped buying it when they
boarded the boat for Israel. After
twenty years of bloodshed they
buy even less the idea that if they
fling their arms into the sea they
won't be flung in after them.
The Jews liked what the
United Nations was doing for
them. The Arabs didn't. The only
way to disagree was guns which
were met with guns and the arms
race, the refugees, the closed
borders are born of those guns.
I see your side, Patricia, that
the Arabs are humans to figure
large in the fate of Palestine, but
see also that Zionism=Jews
humans. Zionism cannot be
thrown into the sea except in the
corpses of 2V* million Jews. That's
one way to deal with it, but the
time is past that the Jews will
jump in. If you're not prepared to
do that, then you must deal with
it another way; you can't ignore it
or wish it away.
