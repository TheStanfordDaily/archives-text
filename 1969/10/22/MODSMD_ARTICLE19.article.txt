## Notable Experiment "In C' 
### 
B> TERR * K I'ST IN
It seems to be the lot of men
with minds, creators and
innovators, to suffer for the
idiocies of the intransigent. The
man who would change the world
had better resign himself to a
changed world after his own time
has passed.
This may seem to apply
particularly to politics and social
change, but these forces have
affected music history just as
strongly. I can find no example
better than that provided by the
opening concert of the Oakland
Symphony at the Oakland
Symphony Auditorium last
Tuesday. That evening, the winds
of change filled the sails of some,
thundered at the conservative
barricades of others.
Gerhard Samuel, conductor
and musical director, opened the
season with the type of program
and iconoclastic disregard for
convention that has made him
notorious among conductors.
House I.iulils Still On
With the house lights still on,
and only half the audience in its
seats, the clock moved to eight
thirty, concert time, and Samuel
began the concert. Chosen to
open Samuel's next-to-the-last
season in the East Bay was a piece
considered far out even in
contemporary music
circles-Terry Riley's "In C."
Composed to be played by a small
group of talented jazz musicians
who know each other well. "In C"
is actually only an outline
consisting of 53 musical figures in
thy key of C.
Backed by a "Pulse" of
constant, unchanging drumming
of the top two C's of the piano,
the players begin at Figure One,
playing it as long as desired, with
as much or as little rest between
each playing, moving on to Figure

2 when it suits them, and so on
until every player has arrived at
no. 53. All players then fade out
while the pulse continues for a
few more measures, and the music
fades into the air.

An adventurous experiment,
"In C" has never been attempted
as an orchestral piece in this part
of thy country, and it was
appropriate that Gerhard Samuel
was responsible for the piece
working.
Under the watchful eye of
composer-innovator Riley sitting
in Row C, center, the Oakland
Symphony made "In C" a
stunningly exciting experiment,
an effort of the same genre as the
first public performance of "Rite
of Spring." And like Stravinsky
that evening in Paris, Terry Riley
and Gerhard Samuel received
several handsful of boos mixed in
with the enthusiastic cheers of the
openminded
For many patrons, this total
disregard for the amenities of
symphony presentation and of
concert composition was too
uprobrious to let pass. Miscreants
Samuel and Riley were
sufficiently confident of the value
of their presentation to actually
be pleased by their
non acceptance by some of the
subscribers.
A Lasting Idiom?
I do not know if this basically
ra ndom-music-without-a-fram
ework will last as an idiom, but
the possibilities for creation are as
unlimited as the possible
permutations of notes and
instruments. This is not the
non-music of John Cage, or the
electronic dubbings of Walter
Carlos; Terry Riley is providing a
foundation for a creative group of
musicians to make their own
music.

I was pleased and impressed by
the superb job done by Samuel in
orchestrating the piece for full
orchestra plus mallet soloists, and
proud to be attending a concert
given by such a daring and
versatile musical organization.
Actually the entire concert was
built around the theme, implicit
though not stated, that
experiment and revolution in
musical composition can succeed.
This may not have been Samuel's
conscious motive, but each of the
pieces presented were by
composers who had been frowned
on by their contemporaries,
compositions now termed
"masterpieces," but then thought
disgraceful.
Beethoven's "Leonore
Overture N. 3", the second
number played by the Oakland

succeed with the piece, the effect
o f its presentation after "In C"
gave a musical-history feeling that
I have never known.
M ii sic a I Emotion
It was as if 1 were in the midst
of a musical emotion seldom seen
in this time of complacent
audiences. I disagreed with the
view taken by the booers, but 1
was glad they vented their
feelings; and it helped to put the
Beethoven in context: this work,
too, was "hideous." Musical taste,
and the absence thereof, lives in
Oakland.
The finest performance of the
evening was given by William
Masselos as soloist in Brahms'
Piano Concerto No, I, a piece first
presented by the composer
himself in 1859. The reception of
the Qoncerto that night in Leipzig
