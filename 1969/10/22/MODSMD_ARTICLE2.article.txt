# Police Nab Senior For SRI Protest
## 
### TINA COOPER 
Another arrest in connection
with last spring's SRI
demonstrations was made
yesterday. At 8:00 a.m., police
awakened John Gostovich, a
Stanford senior, at his off-campus
home to take him downtown for
booking.
Gostovich was questioned and
released on five hundred dollars
bail, provided by friends. His
arraignment was set for November
4. He will be charged on five
counts, including inciting a riot,
disturbing the peace, and
trespassing.

The arrest came as no surprise
to Gostovich, who stated he had
been expecting it since June. "I've
been waiting for this all summer,"
he said. "It's been keeping me sort
of tied down."
"I can't figure out why they
waited this long," Gostovich went
on. "I've been listed in the phone
book all summer."
When questioned about the
arrest, Santa Clara County District
Attorney Craig Brown said he had
no knowledge of it. However, he
said, the arrest had probably been
delayed because the police either
couldn't find Gastovich or were
"too busy with other things to
try."
Mr. Brown went on to say,
"There are still about fifteen
warrants outstanding. We'll
probably be picking these people
up soon, if they don't turn
themselves in."
When asked about the arrest,
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office refused to somment, saying
they would have a bulletin
prepared for release today.
