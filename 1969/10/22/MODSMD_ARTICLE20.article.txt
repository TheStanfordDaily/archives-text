Symphony, was considered an
atrocity by critics after its first
performance in 1806. One
contemporary account stated
"Never before in music has
anything been written so
disjointed, garish, muddled, and
insulting to the ear. The most
harsh modulations follow one
upon the other in truly hideous
harmony and the few paltry ideas
also contribute to remove from it
any semblance of sublimity . .
The modulations and
harmonies are still there, of
course, although Beethoven
revised the work some four times
before he was satisfied that it
would properly begin his opera
Fidelio. Today, the piece is
recognized as genius, and although
the Symphony lacked some of the
depth and fullness to completely

was described by Brahms in a
letter as "a brilliant and
decisive â€”failure."
It took thirty-six years for the
work to be pronounced worthy
by critics, and today it is regarded
as part of the very foundation of
concerto composition.
Masselos' rendition was
forceful and vigorous, matching
the tempestuous starkness of
the piece. Samuel directed the
orchestra as an equal partner with
the soloist, rather than as a
backdrop for the pianist's skill,
and the Symphony met the
measuryof Brahms' difficult score.
It was a splendid performance,
and fitting close to an exciting
musical evening. I am looking
forward to more unorthodox
greatness from Gerhard Samuel
and the Oakland Symphony.
