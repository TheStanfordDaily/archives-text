# For What It's Worth
## Joe Cocker Fills Fillmore 
### COREY GOODMAN CRAIG OKINO 
Joe Cocker had just thanked
the audience after finishing his
version of "Something" by the
Beatles, and after mumbling some
phrases into the mike, had begun
to tell us that the next song was
an old one they had revived: "Box
Top Boogie." And as the Grease
Band started up, it wasobvious
that "Box Top Boogie" was "The
Letter" by the Box Tops, and that
once again Joe Cocker had taken
an old meaningless song and had
transposed it into a song in that
Cocker style of feeling and
excitement.
Joe Cocker and the Grease
Band were featured Friday night
at the Fillmore, and with each of
their songs they took us through
an emotional trip: one letting you
feel complete depression and the
next making you feel alright.
To describe Cocker is like
trying to picture Ray Charles
singing Dylan's "Dear Landlord"
or Dave Mason's "Feeling
Alright." Cocker come from
Sheffield, England, and at the age
of twenty-four is able to capture
Charles' emotion with his spiritual
voice and transcend Charles in
doing some of the best versions of
modern songs.

Friday night Cocker did two
old Ray Charles songs, and just
listening to them reminded me of
why I came to listen to Joe
Cocker when I had a couple of
Ray Charles albums at home. Ray
Charles had done a three minute
version of "Let's Go Get Stoned,"
but Joe Cocker, in his 20 minute
version of the same old song
about one evil habit, changed it to
a more modern stoned, good old
"angel's dust," as he calls it.
Audience Entrapped
After 1 having the whole
audience entrapped within the
ringing out of "let's go get
stoned," he suddenly slowed
down the song to describe his
stoned experience: an
instrumental with occasional
singing about meeting Jesus and
Moses. At the end of the song, we
all came down, rested for a few
seconds, and then got back into
singing, as Cocker and the Grease
Band were all shouting out, "let's
go get stoned."
The instrumentals on the song
were great, as the Grease Band has
that rare quality of conveying
those same Cocker emotions in
their breaks. The two outstanding
musicians are Chris Stainton of
piano and organ (who writes some
of the songs with Cocker) and
Henry McCullough on guitar. All
of their leads are origianl and
fitting to the songs, which is
amazing when you consider taht

most of them are very young
musicians.
Cocker did a couple of songs
from his first album (With a Little
Help From My Friends: A&M SP
4182), some from his lattest
album (Joe Cocker! A&M SP
4224), and some new songs which
will probably be on his third
album. His albums are good
music, and his old material, as
well as the new songs, come off
fresh and clean in person.
His latest album was just
released in this area two weeks
ago, and in his second set Friday
night, he did three of the best
songs off that album: "She Came
in Through the Bathroom
Window", "Delta Lady", and
"Hitchcock Railway" (which he
labeled Death Valley Boggie).
Watching's A Phenomena
To watch Joe Cocker sing these
songs in person is a phenomena.
After letting the Grease Band
warm up with a few blues
numbers, he comes on stage with
his dirty beard, scraggly hair with
a bald spot coming through, pot
belly coming through his small
T-shirt, and of course, his
spasmatic and beautiful hand
movements. Watching his hand
and facial expressions during a
song is a whole experience in
itself.
His hands get caught up in the
emotion of the song, and even
when he stops singing, his hands

catch the piano or guitar leads
from the Grease Band and gyrate
as il he was playing an imaginary
guitar or piano. You almost feel
like there are real instruments in
his hands,
Friday evening, though, wasn't
all good at the Fillmore. The
audience was one of the worst I've
seen, a good deal of them leaving
before Cocker came on for his
second set, and only a core of
Cocker fans having to make all of
the noise to bring him back for
two more songs. His final song
was his version of "I Don't Need
No Doctor," and listening to his
emotional version made me
wonder if I'll ever be able to listen
to Ray Charles old version of the
same song.

Beatles, and after mumbling some
phrases into the mike, had begun
to tell us that the next song was
an old one they had revived: "Box
Top Boogie." And as the Grease
Band started up, it wasobvious
that "Box Top Boogie" was "The
Letter" by the Box Tops, and that
once again Joe Cocker had taken
an old meaningless song and had
transposed it into a song in that
Cocker style of feeling and
excitement.
Joe Cocker and the Grease
Band were featured Friday night
at the Fillmore, and with each of
their songs they took us through
an emotional trip: one letting you
feel complete depression and the
next making you feel alright.
To describe Cocker is like
trying to picture Ray Charles
singing Dylan's "Dear Landlord"
or Dave Mason's "Feeling
Alright." Cocker come from
Sheffield, England, and at the age
of twenty-four is able to capture
Charles' emotion with his spiritual
voice and transcend Charles in
doing some of the best versions of
modern songs.

Friday night Cocker did two
old Ray Charles songs, and just
listening to them reminded me of
why I came to listen to Joe
Cocker when I had a couple of
Ray Charles albums at home. Ray
Charles had done a three minute
version of "Let's Go Get Stoned,"
but Joe Cocker, in his 20 minute
version of the same old song
about one evil habit, changed it to
a more modern stoned, good old
"angel's dust," as he calls it.
Audience Entrapped
After 1 having the whole
audience entrapped within the
ringing out of "let's go get
stoned," he suddenly slowed
down the song to describe his
stoned experience: an
instrumental with occasional
singing about meeting Jesus and
Moses. At the end of the song, we
all came down, rested for a few
seconds, and then got back into
singing, as Cocker and the Grease
Band were all shouting out, "let's
go get stoned."
The instrumentals on the song
were great, as the Grease Band has
that rare quality of conveying
those same Cocker emotions in
their breaks. The two outstanding
musicians are Chris Stainton of
piano and organ (who writes some
of the songs with Cocker) and
Henry McCullough on guitar. All
of their leads are origianl and
fitting to the songs, which is
amazing when you consider taht

most of them are very young
musicians.
Cocker did a couple of songs
from his first album (With a Little
Help From My Friends: A&M SP
4182), some from his lattest
album (Joe Cocker! A&M SP
4224), and some new songs which
will probably be on his third
album. His albums are good
music, and his old material, as
well as the new songs, come off
fresh and clean in person.
His latest album was just
released in this area two weeks
ago, and in his second set Friday
night, he did three of the best
songs off that album: "She Came
in Through the Bathroom
Window", "Delta Lady", and
"Hitchcock Railway" (which he
labeled Death Valley Boggie).
Watching's A Phenomena
To watch Joe Cocker sing these
songs in person is a phenomena.
After letting the Grease Band
warm up with a few blues
numbers, he comes on stage with
his dirty beard, scraggly hair with
a bald spot coming through, pot
belly coming through his small
T-shirt, and of course, his
spasmatic and beautiful hand
movements. Watching his hand
and facial expressions during a
song is a whole experience in
itself.
His hands get caught up in the
emotion of the song, and even
when he stops singing, his hands

catch the piano or guitar leads
from the Grease Band and gyrate
as il he was playing an imaginary
guitar or piano. You almost feel
like there are real instruments in
his hands,
Friday evening, though, wasn't
all good at the Fillmore. The
audience was one of the worst I've
seen, a good deal of them leaving
before Cocker came on for his
second set, and only a core of
Cocker fans having to make all of
the noise to bring him back for
two more songs. His final song
was his version of "I Don't Need
No Doctor," and listening to his
emotional version made me
wonder if I'll ever be able to listen
to Ray Charles old version of the
same song.

Top Boogie." And as the Grease
Band started up, it wasobvious
that "Box Top Boogie" was "The
Letter" by the Box Tops, and that
once again Joe Cocker had taken
an old meaningless song and had
transposed it into a song in that
Cocker style of feeling and
excitement.
Joe Cocker and the Grease
Band were featured Friday night
at the Fillmore, and with each of
their songs they took us through
an emotional trip: one letting you
feel complete depression and the
next making you feel alright.
To describe Cocker is like
trying to picture Ray Charles
singing Dylan's "Dear Landlord"
or Dave Mason's "Feeling
Alright." Cocker come from
Sheffield, England, and at the age
of twenty-four is able to capture
Charles' emotion with his spiritual
voice and transcend Charles in
doing some of the best versions of
modern songs.

Friday night Cocker did two
old Ray Charles songs, and just
listening to them reminded me of
why I came to listen to Joe
Cocker when I had a couple of
Ray Charles albums at home. Ray
Charles had done a three minute
version of "Let's Go Get Stoned,"
but Joe Cocker, in his 20 minute
version of the same old song
about one evil habit, changed it to
a more modern stoned, good old
"angel's dust," as he calls it.
Audience Entrapped
After 1 having the whole
audience entrapped within the
ringing out of "let's go get
stoned," he suddenly slowed
down the song to describe his
stoned experience: an
instrumental with occasional
singing about meeting Jesus and
Moses. At the end of the song, we
all came down, rested for a few
seconds, and then got back into
singing, as Cocker and the Grease
Band were all shouting out, "let's
go get stoned."
The instrumentals on the song
were great, as the Grease Band has
that rare quality of conveying
those same Cocker emotions in
their breaks. The two outstanding
musicians are Chris Stainton of
piano and organ (who writes some
of the songs with Cocker) and
Henry McCullough on guitar. All
of their leads are origianl and
fitting to the songs, which is
amazing when you consider taht

most of them are very young
musicians.
Cocker did a couple of songs
from his first album (With a Little
Help From My Friends: A&M SP
4182), some from his lattest
album (Joe Cocker! A&M SP
4224), and some new songs which
will probably be on his third
album. His albums are good
music, and his old material, as
well as the new songs, come off
fresh and clean in person.
His latest album was just
released in this area two weeks
ago, and in his second set Friday
night, he did three of the best
songs off that album: "She Came
in Through the Bathroom
Window", "Delta Lady", and
"Hitchcock Railway" (which he
labeled Death Valley Boggie).
Watching's A Phenomena
To watch Joe Cocker sing these
songs in person is a phenomena.
After letting the Grease Band
warm up with a few blues
numbers, he comes on stage with
his dirty beard, scraggly hair with
a bald spot coming through, pot
belly coming through his small
T-shirt, and of course, his
spasmatic and beautiful hand
movements. Watching his hand
and facial expressions during a
song is a whole experience in
itself.
His hands get caught up in the
emotion of the song, and even
when he stops singing, his hands

catch the piano or guitar leads
from the Grease Band and gyrate
as il he was playing an imaginary
guitar or piano. You almost feel
like there are real instruments in
his hands,
Friday evening, though, wasn't
all good at the Fillmore. The
audience was one of the worst I've
seen, a good deal of them leaving
before Cocker came on for his
second set, and only a core of
Cocker fans having to make all of
the noise to bring him back for
two more songs. His final song
was his version of "I Don't Need
No Doctor," and listening to his
emotional version made me
wonder if I'll ever be able to listen
to Ray Charles old version of the
same song.
