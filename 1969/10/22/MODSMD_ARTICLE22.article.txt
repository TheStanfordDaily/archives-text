The Tresidder Box Office has
released for sale more season
tickets to the San Francisco
Symphony. Good seats are
available in all price ranges, for
either or both of the two series.
The entire season consists of
twenty-two concerts, one-third to
be directed by Josef Krips,
one-third by Seiji Ozawa, and
one-third by guest conductors.
Series A and Series B alternate
Wednesdays, so each of the two
has entirely different programs.
Series A includes eight of
Beethoven's nine symphonies and
the Violin Concerto, while Series
B will present four of the piano
concerti and the Missa Solemn is,
along with two overtures, all by
Beethoven.
In addition, each series has
many other works scheduled,
including an all-Stravinsky
evening, pieces by Ives, Bizet, and
Bruckner on "B" and works of
Haydn and Mozart, Mahler and
Satie on "A".
Prices for the concerts are as
low as $1.25 per concert on a
season pass, really a great buy on
symphonic music. The Tresidder
Box Office has the complete list
of pieces to be played and the
seats available.
