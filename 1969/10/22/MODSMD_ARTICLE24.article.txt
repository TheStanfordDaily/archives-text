# Poppycock Moves Palo Alto
## 
### 
Hiding in a small corner of
upper-middle class suburbia
(referred to as Palo Alto) near the
Stanford campus is one of the
best rock clubs in the Bay Area,
the Poppycock. Palo Alto officials
have been hassling its owners
lately because they consider it a
hangout for the undersirable
hippie and drug elements (which
it often is during the summer
months) and a blemish on the face
of the city.
But this blemish is solely
responsible for introducing a
flood of musical talent, both old
and new, to an otherwise parched
area of the Peninsula. Firmly
established groups began there
(Quicksilver Messenger Service,
Santana, the Youngbloods, and
Creedence Clearwater Revival)
much as the newer groups
(Country Weather, Linn County,
A.B. Skhy, Elvin Bishop, the
Womb, and the rest) are doing
now.

The Poppycock also features
older talent, performers who have
never achieved national
recognition but have had major
influences on the rock musicians
who have. In the past month,
featured artists have included Big
Mama Thornton (Janis Joplin's
"mentor" and writer of "Ball and
Chain" on Cheap Thrills), the
Chicago Blues All-Stars (with
bassist Willie Dixon, most noted
for his blues compositions,
"Spoonful" and"I Ain't
Superstitious"), and, most
recently, Charley Musselwhite.
Musselwhite has a deeply
rooted Chicago blues tradition,
and inevitable comparisons must
be made between him and the
otherwhite practitioner of
Chicago blues, Paul Butterfield.
Certainly Butterfield is the better
harp player. Also, while
Butterfield has augmented his
band with horns and incorporated
a jazz feeling into his music,

Musselwhite has remained in
relative obscurity by retaining the
Chicago blues format. But I think
this is not so much a matter of
musical inability to expand as it is
a matter of personal choice on
Musselwhite's part to remain that
way.
The first two numbers of the
set were done by the guitar, bass,
and drums; two funky
instrumental with Freddie, the
steel guitarist, wailing on "I've
Been Working on the Railroad."
A pianist joined them, and then a
dude who had been sitting at one
of the tables during the opening
numbers, hair greased straight
back from his forehead, long
sleeves rolled halfway up his arm,
stepped up to the mike and
started blowing his harp. Charley
Musselwhite.
Judging by their performance
at the Poppycock last Friday
night, the upcoming album on
Blue Thumb records (Zappa's

company which also records
Captain Beefheart and Ike and
Tina Turner) should be
worthwhile.
Charley Musselwhite is typical
of the caliber of musicians
regularly featured at the
Poppycock, and their
performances are all the more
enjoyable because of the small,
party atmosphere, something that
would not come off at, say,
Fillmore or Winterland. In the
coming weeks, the Loading Zone
and Lonnie Mack will be
appearing there.
