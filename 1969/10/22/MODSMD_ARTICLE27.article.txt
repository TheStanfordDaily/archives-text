# Bunce And Fuji
## Behind The Star 
### FRED LEESON 
Tnore's Plunkett on the press
book cover, the store window
placard and the Alumni Almanac
ticket ad, stepping to his right and
starting downfield with the
football gently cradled and ready
for another forward pass.
Quarterback is where the
attention is, but not customarily
for the second and third stringer.
But this is no usual year for
Stanford football.
What's it like for Don Bunce
and Ron Fujikawa to play behind
an all-American candidate who is
creeping up on Stanford total
yardage and touchdown pass
records with a whole year of
eligibility after this one?
They've been asked before.
Fujikawa looks around for an
escape route, and finding none
says he doesn't consider himself
to be very good, and hence
doesn't believe what everybody
says about Stanford having the
best depth at quarterback in the
nation.
Bunce sits silently, and then
starts after a deep breath. "It's

frustrating. It would be a lot
different if you didn't like the guy
and you could let your emotions
go. Soemtimes it's hard to hold it
in."
All three are good friends and
fraternity brothers, thus no
animosity. "You have to be
optimistic or else the season will
be a drag," adds Bunce, himself a
fine runner and passer who won
Back of the Week honors against
WSU in his substitute role.
Bunce spends most of the
g;imes leaning on a little white
table near the bench, in phone
contact with coaches in the press
box. Because of a 46 player limit
in the Pac-8, Fujikawa watches
league games from the stands, and
would be activated in case of
injury.
"You can see the dollies a lot
better from there," he jokes, but
like Bunce he'd much rather be on
the field. And whenever Fuji does
get in, like against SJS, Stanford is
so far ahead he has instructions
not to run up the score.
"It's awfully nerve-wracking to
sit there and watch," Bunce says.

In the close ones, is he just as
happy not to be playing? "I'd give
anything to be in," he emphasizes,
adding that he thinks the
challenge of pressure might make
him more effective.
Don gets one series advance
notice before entering a game, and
that's when he gets the most
nervous, warming up his arm on
the sidelines. "It takes one play to
get the feel of it,"he says, and
after that he's in full swing.
But once Fujikawa takes his
place in the stands, he doesn't
relish the thought of having to
come in during the middle, as
happened to a Cal QB in a similar
position earlier this season.
Ron has continued with
football because he likes the sport
and he likes being a part of the
team. He's essentially an observer
at practices, while Bunce runs the
team a third of the time and
Plunkett the rest.
Fuji is from Long Beach,
where, he'll tell you, he
quarterbacked ahead of good
friend Dennis Dummit, who leads
unbeaten UCLA into Stanford
Stadium this Saturday. Ron was
also recruited by the Bruins,
despite their conviction that he
was too small for a major-college
miartorhaok
Bunce turned down USC to
come to Stanford, thinking "it
would be of more value to
establish a winning tradition here"
than to be just another winner
with the Trojans.
At that time, fate had Jim
Plunkett playing defensive end for
the frosh.
A senior academically,
Fujikawa doesn't intend to use his
third year of eligibility he still has
coming. If Plunkett stays healthy,
Bunce is thinking of red-shirting
next season and playing his final
year after Plunkett graduates. Don
will attend the Italy campus next
spring-summer.

FREE AND EASY—Stanford's sensational backup quarterback Don Bunco
finally got his chance to shine against WSU. He and Hon Fujikawa have lived
two seasons in Plunkett's shadow, and tell of their experiences in the story at
right.
Tnore's Plunkett on the press
book cover, the store window
placard and the Alumni Almanac
ticket ad, stepping to his right and
starting downfield with the
football gently cradled and ready
for another forward pass.
Quarterback is where the
attention is, but not customarily
for the second and third stringer.
But this is no usual year for
Stanford football.
What's it like for Don Bunce
and Ron Fujikawa to play behind
an all-American candidate who is
creeping up on Stanford total
yardage and touchdown pass
records with a whole year of
eligibility after this one?
They've been asked before.
Fujikawa looks around for an
escape route, and finding none
says he doesn't consider himself
to be very good, and hence
doesn't believe what everybody
says about Stanford having the
best depth at quarterback in the
nation.
Bunce sits silently, and then
starts after a deep breath. "It's

frustrating. It would be a lot
different if you didn't like the guy
and you could let your emotions
go. Soemtimes it's hard to hold it
in."
All three are good friends and
fraternity brothers, thus no
animosity. "You have to be
optimistic or else the season will
be a drag," adds Bunce, himself a
fine runner and passer who won
Back of the Week honors against
WSU in his substitute role.
Bunce spends most of the
g;imes leaning on a little white
table near the bench, in phone
contact with coaches in the press
box. Because of a 46 player limit
in the Pac-8, Fujikawa watches
league games from the stands, and
would be activated in case of
injury.
"You can see the dollies a lot
better from there," he jokes, but
like Bunce he'd much rather be on
the field. And whenever Fuji does
get in, like against SJS, Stanford is
so far ahead he has instructions
not to run up the score.
"It's awfully nerve-wracking to
sit there and watch," Bunce says.

In the close ones, is he just as
happy not to be playing? "I'd give
anything to be in," he emphasizes,
adding that he thinks the
challenge of pressure might make
him more effective.
Don gets one series advance
notice before entering a game, and
that's when he gets the most
nervous, warming up his arm on
the sidelines. "It takes one play to
get the feel of it,"he says, and
after that he's in full swing.
But once Fujikawa takes his
place in the stands, he doesn't
relish the thought of having to
come in during the middle, as
