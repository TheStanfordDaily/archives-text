# Easy Victory
## Harriers Run Wild 
### 
Stanford's steady cross country
team stunned USC and scored an
unexpectedly easy victory in a
four-way meet at Long Beach
State last Saturday.

The Tribe bounced its first five
finishers into a space of 20
seconds and all made it into the
top ten to whip the second-place
Trojans by the surprising score of
31 to 45.
Cal Poly and Pepperdine trailed
with 61 and 85 points.
Sophomore Robert Coe
finished second, his strong final
kick leaving him just two seconds
behind winner Fred Ritcherson, a
Trojan freshman.
Don Kardong. Arvid Kretz,
Greg Brock, and Chuck Menze
then ganged up to finish fifth,
seventh, eighth and ninth to
guarantee the solid Stanford
victory. All five Indians finished
ahead of SC's third man.
Ritcherson, Coe and Kretz
livened up the final mile by
looping clockwise on a
counter-clockwise turn, but
because the distances were equal
it didn't shuffle the finish.
Coe's time for the six mile, 149
yard course was 30:35, and
Kardong's fifth-place finish was
30:41. Kretz, Brock and Menz
scored between 30:48 and 30:55.
Jack Lawson and Decker
Underwood were the remaining
/arsity competitors, placing 15th
and 19th respectively.
This Saturday at 10 a.m. the
Indians run their first home race,
meeting the strong UCLA Bruins
on the Stanford golf course.
Last week UCLA romped to a
20-41 dual victory over California,
placing all five runners ahead of
the Bears' second man. So
Saturday morning Stanford will
be meeting a strong pack, and the
Tribe which has been surprising in
both of its two formal outings will
be out after another one.
