# Unruh Here Politicking
## Jess Hints Candidacy 
### 
If he decides that the people o r
California are "ready to look at
the broad range of problems
facing the state rather than just at
the campuses," Jess Unruh will
run for Governor.
Speaking informally to a
handful of reporters while a busy
cocktail party began in the Palo
Alto home of Clayton Rost, the
Assembly minority leader
explained that he will only run if
he feels he can speak out honestly
on all the issues.
' I'm not ready to shunt aside
my beliefs just to get elected," the
Inglewood Democrat declared.
"So far, I have great confidence in
the California voter," he added.
Brief Slop
Unruh stopped briefly in Palo
Alto following a day urging tax
reform in San Mateo County. Last
night he spoke to more than 400
at a Sunnybale Democratic dinner
on "1970â€”Year of Decision."
The inability of this
administration to cope with the
major problems of the state: tax
reform, educational finance, the
structure and progress of
education, and the general neglect
of other social issues" will be the
major campaign issues of 1970,
according to Unruh.
Unruh cited Governor Roanld
Reagan's ability to keep the public
focused on unrest on college
campuses as being responsible for
his popularity. "This popularity

would not be the same if all the
issues were considered," he stated.
Unruh Attacked
Early yesterday Unruh was
attacked by Santa Clara County
Democratic chairman E. Day
Carman for what Carman termed
Unruh's threat to impeach
Superior Court Judge Gerald S.
Chargin.
The State Commission on
Judicial Qualifications is studying
a complaint against Chargin
alleging he made racist remarks
while sentencing a Chicano youth.
Unruh said Chargin's widely
publicized remarks "cast
unjustifiable and unconscionable
slurs on all Americans of Mexican
ancestry."
Im peachni cut?
He asked the judicial
qualifications commission to
conduct an investigation, but
warned if Chargin was not
removed from the bench or if he
did not resign, impeachment
proceedings would be initiated in
the State Legislature.
"The way I read it, it was a
threat," Carman stated. "Not just
a threat of a threat, but that he
was going to do this."
Carman added that he would
no longer support Unruh in a bid
for the governorship.
"Outrageous Action"
Last night Unruh responded, "I
said what I felt; if that's the price
for saying what is right, then

that's the price I will have to pay.
I believe tha it is necessary for
public officials to speak out when
they see this type of outrageous
action."
