# Trobabes Drop Frosh In Opener
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
"I was terribly proud of the way our guys hung in there and
slugged it out with those Trojans for a full 60 minutes of
football—they didn't once think of giving up."
So said Coach Bill Moultrie following his Frosh football squad's
25-14 loss to USC last Friday afternoon in the Coliseum.
"Of course, as a coach, I'm naturally a sore loser, but taking
inventory of the afternoon, I feel that we functioned extremely well
as a unit, and I admire the respect that we had for one another."
"The offensive line did a fantastic job of handling the SC front
four, even though they were giving up 10-20 pounds a man. The
Trojans just had the horses is all."
The Papooses drew first blood when workhorse tailback Eric Cross
broke loose on a 41 yard scoring romp and Duke Williams converted
to give the junior Tribe a 7-0 edge at the end of the first quarter.
An interception set up the Trojan's first scoriand by half time the
SC eleven had found the end zone again to make it 13-7 going into the
dressing room.
Stanford came right back in the third period, and following a
sustained drive, Eric Cross plunged across the r*oal line from one yard
out, and Williams again was on target with the extra point to put the
Indians ahead, 14-13.
S(J, howiver, not to be outdone, quickly capitalized on a blocked
punt to go out in front to stay, and then added the capper late in the
fourth quarter to close out the scoring with 25 points on the
afternoon.
Big, 215-pound Sam Cunningham," who could be starting for most
college varsity squads," packed the mail for SC and was the game's
leading ground gainer. "They never did hurt us with the deep pass,"
Commented Coach Moultrie.
Offensively for the Papooses, quarterback Jim Wise, who played
most of the game, drew high praise for his signal-calling and
on-the-field leadership, and Barr Curry and Reggie Sanderson also were
high on the coach's list of "well done's." "But if I had to name
Stanford's top offensive player for the game, it would have to be Eric
Cross," said Coach Moultrie.
"I think that defensively, Charles McCloud did an outstanding job
as did Tom Klein, Steve Murray, and A 1 Dyson. But the biggest, and
perhaps the nicest surprise of the day was Steve Hagata at split end
who's crack-back blocking really made our sweeps go."
"I was really pleased with the way the kids played ball, they were
popping leather with the best in the country," said Moultrie. "We'll be
more than ready for this week's game with UCLA and are looking
forward to winning our remaining three contests. If these guys stick
together, I'm predicting Roses in '72."
