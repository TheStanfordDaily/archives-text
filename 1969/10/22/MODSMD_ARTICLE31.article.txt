## Rose Bowl--Take Two 
### Fred Mann 
Stanford's Rose Bowl fortunes
took a small swing upwards
yesterday with a rule clarification
by Bob Sprenger, Publicity
Director for the Pacific-8
Conference.
The rules listed in Monday's
Daily concerning the Rose Bow.l
were correct. The only change
comes in discussing USCand what
must happen to them in order for
Stanford to be selected.
As previously stated, USC must
be beaten by UCLA and also by
some other Pac-8 school in order
to get Stanford to Pasadena. But
according to Mr. Sprenger, if USC
is tied by a Pac-8 school (instead
of being beaten), accompanied by
a loss to UCLA, of course,
Stanford would be in.
This small difference is due to
the point system set up by the
conference. In short (and as
simply as possible), the Rose Bowl
representative is selected in the
following way:
1. The representative shall be the
team with the least number of
losses and ties in the final
Pacific-8 standings.
2. If there are two or more teams
with the same number of losses
and ties in the final Pacific-8
standings, then the team that has
won the regular season game
between the tied schools shall be
the representative.
3. If the regular season game has
been tied, or if three teams have
both won and lost to their
co-leaders, then a point system
shall be used to determine the
representative.
4. The point system awards 4
points for every conference win, 3
points for every non-conference
win, 2 points for every conference
tie, and 1 point for every
non-conference tie.
5. The point system shall be used
to determine the Rose Bowl
representative. If three teams are
involved, the team with the
highest number of points is
declared the representative,
regardless of their regular season
record against other tied teams.
If a three way tie occurs
between Stanford, UCLA, and
USC, Stanford CAN NOT be
chosen the representative. This
situation would arise if Stanford
beats UCLA on Saturday, and
UCLA beats USC on November
22. All three teams would have
one loss and no ties in Pac-8 play.
Under the point system, UCLA
would have 33 points, USC would
have 30'/2, and Stanford would
have 30. UCLA would go to the
Rose Bowl.
Stanford's best chance lies in a
two-way tie with UCLA. In this
case the regular season winner
(Stanford) would be the
representative.

So, as stated before, USC must
finish with more losses and ties
than both Stanford and UCLA.
Assuming one loss to UCLA in the
final game of the year, the Trojans
must also lose or be tied by
California, Washington State, or
Washington. That would make
them 4-2 or 4-1-1 in league play.
This was all stated in Monday's
Daily, but much of the
misunderstanding came from the
ambiguous rule defining the
"Conference Champion." The
Pacific-8 determines their
Conference Champion on the
basis of the Pac-8 won-loss
percentage.

Assuming again a final league
standing with one loss for
Stanford, USC, and UCLA, then
only the Indians and the Bruins
would be recognized as
"Conference Champion." (USC
plays only six league games and
would finish with a percentage of
.833, while Stanford and UCLA,
playing seven league games would
finish at .857).
But-THE CONFERENCE
CHAMPION IS NOT ALWAYS
THE ROSE BOWL
REPRESENTATIVE. When
considering the representative, the
league office disregards the
percentage and looks only at the
loss and tie columns.

have 30'/2, and Stanford would
have 30. UCLA would go to the
Rose Bowl.
Stanford's best chance lies in a
two-way tie with UCLA. In this
case the regular season winner
(Stanford) would be the
representative.

So, as stated before, USC must
finish with more losses and ties
than both Stanford and UCLA.
Assuming one loss to UCLA in the
final game of the year, the Trojans
must also lose or be tied by
California, Washington State, or
Washington. That would make
them 4-2 or 4-1-1 in league play.
This was all stated in Monday's
Daily, but much of the
misunderstanding came from the
ambiguous rule defining the
"Conference Champion." The
Pacific-8 determines their
Conference Champion on the
basis of the Pac-8 won-loss
percentage.

Assuming again a final league
standing with one loss for
Stanford, USC, and UCLA, then
only the Indians and the Bruins
would be recognized as
"Conference Champion." (USC
plays only six league games and
would finish with a percentage of
.833, while Stanford and UCLA,
playing seven league games would
finish at .857).
But-THE CONFERENCE
CHAMPION IS NOT ALWAYS
THE ROSE BOWL
REPRESENTATIVE. When
considering the representative, the
league office disregards the
percentage and looks only at the
loss and tie columns.
Stanford's Rose Bowl fortunes
took a small swing upwards
yesterday with a rule clarification
by Bob Sprenger, Publicity
Director for the Pacific-8
Conference.
The rules listed in Monday's
Daily concerning the Rose Bow.l
were correct. The only change
comes in discussing USCand what
must happen to them in order for
Stanford to be selected.
As previously stated, USC must
be beaten by UCLA and also by
some other Pac-8 school in order
to get Stanford to Pasadena. But
according to Mr. Sprenger, if USC
is tied by a Pac-8 school (instead
of being beaten), accompanied by
a loss to UCLA, of course,
Stanford would be in.
This small difference is due to
the point system set up by the
conference. In short (and as
simply as possible), the Rose Bowl
representative is selected in the
following way:
1. The representative shall be the
team with the least number of
losses and ties in the final
Pacific-8 standings.
2. If there are two or more teams
with the same number of losses
and ties in the final Pacific-8
standings, then the team that has
won the regular season game
between the tied schools shall be
the representative.
3. If the regular season game has
been tied, or if three teams have
both won and lost to their
co-leaders, then a point system
shall be used to determine the
representative.
4. The point system awards 4
points for every conference win, 3
points for every non-conference
win, 2 points for every conference
tie, and 1 point for every
non-conference tie.
5. The point system shall be used
to determine the Rose Bowl
representative. If three teams are
involved, the team with the
highest number of points is
declared the representative,
regardless of their regular season
record against other tied teams.
If a three way tie occurs
between Stanford, UCLA, and
USC, Stanford CAN NOT be
chosen the representative. This
situation would arise if Stanford
beats UCLA on Saturday, and
UCLA beats USC on November
22. All three teams would have
one loss and no ties in Pac-8 play.
Under the point system, UCLA
would have 33 points, USC would
have 30'/2, and Stanford would
have 30. UCLA would go to the
Rose Bowl.
Stanford's best chance lies in a
two-way tie with UCLA. In this

(Stanford) would be the
