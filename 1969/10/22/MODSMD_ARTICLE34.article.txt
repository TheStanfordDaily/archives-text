# Mothers Club Tea Arranged
## 
### 
The annual Chrysanthemum
Tea of the Stanford Mothers Club
will be held this year in historic
Stanford Museum on the campus
from 1:30 to 4 p.m. Wednesday,
Nov. 5.
The entire museum will be
open to those attending so they
may view the many exhibits. A
student string ensemble quartet
will provide music.
Many beautiful displays of
chrysanthemums, some in the
form of topiary trees, will
ornament the rotunda, balcony
areas, and tea tables.
Unusual varieties of fall blooms
in potted plants and corsages will
be for sale as well as an added
feature, "Easy Gourmet from
Stanford," a cookbook prepared
by the Mothers Club.
Proceeds from the tea will go
to support the scholarship,
grants-in-aid and emergency aid
funds for Stanford students. The
general public as well as Club
members and their guests are
welcome to attend this annual
event.
