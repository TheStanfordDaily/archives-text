Professor Clark Reynolds will
give a lecture entitled "Second
Thoughts on the Rockefeller
Mission to Latin America" at 4:15
today in TMU 270.
Professor Reynolds was one of
three economists who
accompanied Nelson Rockefeller
on his four fact-finding trips to
Latin America. The mission has
been the object of controversy, as
has President Nixon's failure to
make public the text of the
Rockefeller report.

Presumably the report will
provide the basis for the speech
on U.S.-Latin American relations
which President Nixon will give
later this month.
Professor Reynolds is a
member of the Food Research
Institute here.
The lecture is sponsored by the
California Institute of
International Studies. There is no
admission charge.
