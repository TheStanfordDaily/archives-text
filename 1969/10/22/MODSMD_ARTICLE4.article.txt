# HEW Secretary To Speak Friday
## 
### 
Robert Finch, Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare,
will visit Stanford Friday as a
guest of the Young Republicans.
The former lieutenant governor
California will speak briefly and
answer student questions at 4:15
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
He has been a focal point of
such controversial topics as school
desegregation, medical research
funding, and so-called "anti-riot"
amendments to departmental
appropriations bills in Congress.
In recent testimony before the
Senate Appropriations
Subcommittee on the Labor and
HEW Departments, Finch said he
opposes any approach to
controlling student unrest which
threatens to cut off funds to
institutions "because it
unwittingly puts a very potent
weapon in he hands of the
disrupters," the most militant of
whom "would like nothing better
that to shut down our
universities."

He warned that another
anti-riot provision, passed by the
House of Representatives, denying
federal funds to individuals
engaged in forcible disruption of
an institution appears to place
primary responsibility for
enforcement on HEW rather than
the acadt'mic institutions and
could become an administrative
nightmare.
Finch most recently made
headlines last Saturday when he
announced that cyclamate, the
dietic sweetner in soft drinks,
would be banned from sale after
the end of the year. He cited
evidence that cyclamate caused
cancer in rats as the reason for the
prohibition.
Major soft drink makers
responded with announcements
that they would immediately
cease production of such
beverages and introduce new
dietic drinks that rely on
saccharin and small amounts of
sugar for their flavoring.
