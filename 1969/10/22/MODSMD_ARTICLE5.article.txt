# Med School Reports Minority Enrollment
## 
### 
In the past the Stanford
University School of Medicine,
like most of America's prestige
schools, has been content to wait
for applications from qualfied
black and brown students.
As a result blacks, and students
of Mexican-American or
American-Indian ancestry have
been solitary figures in the
medical school's classrooms and
laboratories.
Of the 300 medical students
enrolled in the school in 1968-69,
only three were blacks and one of
them was from Nigeria.
This year the picture has
changed drastically. After
extensive recruiting, 12 students
(7 blacks and 5 Mexican-Amer
icans) have entered medical
training here. Ten of the students
are part of a special program
designed for minorities. Two
others have been admitted to the
school through the regular
channels.
Largest Number
The group represents the
largest number of minority
students in the school's history.
To facilitate development of
the special program, the medical
school increased its entering class
size from 64 to 74 students, with
10 places available each year to
minorities, said Dr. Bernard W.
Nelson, associate dean for student
affairs.
In addition, the faculty has
decided that minority applicants
will be evaluated by criteria more
relevant to their needs and
background. Their selection will
be made by a committee on
minority admission composed of
minority group representatives
and faculty.
Funds Pledged
The medical school has pledged
to provide funds to aid minority

students who are unable to
finance their education and
tutoring help for those who need
it.
Dr. Nelson explained that
minorities are caught in the vise of
insufficient funds and inadequate
secondary education and that
recruitment and assistance in
medical school must be directed
to an easing of these pressures.
"We have come to realize," he
said, "that in selecting minority
applicants we must consider other
factors than just Medical College
Admission Test scores.
Other Factors
"It is widely recognized that a
student's accomplishment in
medical school is principally
determined by his own ability,
knowledge, and motivation.
Although grade point averages and
test scores generally reflect these
qualities, they may be inaccurate
in indicating the basic ability and
motivation of a minority student
where social, financial, and
regional barriers must be
considered.
Funds Sought
"We are searching for 112 nds to
run the program," Dr.
said. "Minority students admitted
this year have all required
financial assistance. For the first
year, we are using reserve funds to
make the program go. But
foundations, which often in the
past have been interested in
sponsoring programs for minority
students, have not been willing to
fund them."
Many of the students this year
were recruited by a special
minority search committee. Dr.
Jose Aguilar, committee
chairman, traveled through the
Southwest and arranged for
several Mexican-American

students to visit Stanford.
Members of the Mexican-Amer
ican Students Confederation
assisted him in interviewing
applicants from their minority
group.
Another committee member,
Paul Williams, a second-year
medical student and member of
the Black Student Union, talked
with black applicants who visited
the campus, and contacted and
counseled by telephone those hi
could not meet personally.
BSU Assisted
In screening applicants other
BSU members assisted, including
Dr. Cyril Fabio, a dentist from
East Palo Alto. Some applicants
who visited Stanford took lodging
at the homes of minority search
committee members, allowing
them to become personally
acquainted with the candidates.
Dr. Aguilar noted that as a
result of publicity and
recruitment efforts, G3 minority
students applied for admission to
the medical school this year. By
contrast, during the previous year,
when Stanford had no formal
program, only 9 Candida es
applied.
"Minorities have not shown
much interest in entering
professional schools, because pu;;t
promises have never amounted to
anything," Dr. Aguilar said. "Our
program for the first time spells
out exactly what the opportunity
consists of in terms of positions
promised, and what the support
will be.
"The fact that we have a
program will undoubtedly have an
impact on the educational system
farther down the line. It will point
out the inadequacies of education
at the grade and high levels and
the failure to produce the talent
medical schools require."
