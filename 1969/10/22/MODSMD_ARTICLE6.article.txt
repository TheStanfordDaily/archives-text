# Angela Davis Expects Credit For Course, Ruling Attacked

LOS ANGELES
(AP)—Admitted Communist
Angela Davis said Tuesday she
feels her UCLA philosophy course
will be given academic credit

because of a Superior Court ruling
against her dismissal.
"From what I have been told
the decision means that I am
restored as a full faculty
member—and that means credit
for my course," Miss Davis, 25,
told a news conference Tuesday.
Judge Jerry Pacht ruled
Tuesday that University of
California regents acted
unconstitutionally Sept. 19 when
they dismissed Miss Davis under a
1940 policy barring employment
of Communists as faculty
members.
Assemblyman Floyd L.
Wakefield, R-South Gate, said he
would ask Gov. Reagan and the
regents to file a "Declaration of
Prejudice" against Pacht in an
attempt to have the decision
voided.
In a statement, Wakefield said
a 1948 California Senate
Fact-Finding Report listed Pacht
as a speaker at a 1945 convention
of American Youth for
Democracy. Wakefield said the
organization was formerly the
Young Communist League.
Pacht said he would not
"dignify" Wakefield's statement
with a reply and refused
comment.

Charles H. Phillips, an attorney
who represented three UCLA
faculty members and two students
in challenging the dismissal of
Miss Davis, said Wakefield's action
was "too late" because the court
already had ruled and the case was
out of Pacht's hands.
Pacht said a decision on credit
Miss Davis' course in the light of
his ruling rested with the
university administration.
Miss Davis called Reagan and
the, regents "unscrupulous
demagogues" and said "we need a
new 'three R's'-oust Reagan,
Rafferty and the regents." She
referred to Dr. Max Rafferty,
state superintent of public
instruction, who has criticized the
hiring of Miss Davis.
They wasted thousands of
dollars of taxpayer's funds to
effect this illegal move in firing
here, Miss Davis said, calling
Pacht's ruling "a tremendous
victory."
UC General Counsel Thomas J.
Cunningham, who did not attend
Monday's hearing before Pacht,
said the ruling "denied the regents
the opportunity to present
evidence why an admitted
member of the Communist party
is unable to teach objectively."
