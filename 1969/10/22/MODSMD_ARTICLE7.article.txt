"I don't think we should ally
ourselves with the Moratorium at
all. We can't maintain a united
front; their views are diametrically
opposed to ours."
Several members of the
Stanford Students for a
Democratic Society voiced this
opinion at last night 's meeting in
Branner Hall. The leaders of the
Moratorium, they stressed, are not
against imperialism. "But we have
to convince people," one member
said, "that it's not just Nixon, not
just the war—it's the system and
society."
Despite some differences of
opinion, the Stanford chapter of
SDS is already planning for the
November Moratorium, especially
for heavy activity at the Industrial
Park.
In addition to leafleting the
workers, several students said they
had hopes for staging a noon-time
rally in Industrial Park which
would do more good than the
October 15 rally at Cogswell
Plaza. "It was difficult for people
who have real power in this
country to participate in that
rally," one person commented.

It was suggested that the rully
could then move out onto El
Camino; and perhaps a march
could be sustained all the way to
Moffett Field.
Bruce Pollock and Lenny
Siegal said they were concerned
about getting radicals onto the
planning committee for the
Moratorium. Even if they did not
agree with the views of most of
the Moratorium's supporters, still
they felt that they could help
educate and radicalize people.
In addition, Pollock said, we
can "make sure that when he
liberals drop out in December, w»
keep escalating the Moratorium,
whether in the number of days or
the style of protest."
Several students also said they
planned to push for cancellation
of classes on Nov. 14 and 15.
"You listen to some of the
things that come out of Pitzer's
and Lyman's mouth."
"Pitzer says, you have to hold
or reschedule classes bee uuse
people have a right to to
school," Siegal remarked. "We
say. No, people don't have a rip t
to go to school when we're tr\ n ■
to stop a war in Vietnam."
