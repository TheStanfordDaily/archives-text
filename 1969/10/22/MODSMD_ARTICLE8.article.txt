ATLANTA, Ga. (AP)-Liberal
Democrat Sam Massell rode a
surge of black votes to victory
Tuesday night over Republican
Rodney Cook in Atlanta's runoff
mayor's race.
With virtually all of the votes
counted, the 48-year-old vice

mayor had an 11,000 lead over
Cook, an alderman and state
legislator.
The decisive vote was in the
predominantly Negro 3rd Ward,
where Massell had a better than
10-1 margin.

Cook, a moderate, took the
lead early in the nonpartisan
election for a successor to retiring
Democratic Mayor Ivan Allen Jr.,
and held a shaky lead for four
hours.
But as returns from Negro
precincts poured in, Massell
overcame the deficit and jumped
to a commanding lead.
