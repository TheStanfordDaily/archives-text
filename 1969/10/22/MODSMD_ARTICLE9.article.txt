WASHINGTON
(AP)—President Nixon appeared
Tuesday to by trying to
disassociate himself from Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew's
denunciation of last week's peace
demonstration.
For the second day in a row
presidential press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler said the Agnew
speech had not been seen nor
reviewed in advance by the White
House.
At the State Department, press
officer Robert J. McCloskey said a
very different kind of statement
which had been made by
Secretary William P. Rogers in
New York Monday night was
made known to the White House
in advance of its delivery.
Agnew was thus pictured by
the White House as having acted
on his own—so far as the President
is concerned —when he said in a
New Orleans speech Sunday night
that the Moratorium Day
demonstration was encouraged by
"an effete corps of impudent
snobs" and "hard core dissidents
and professional anarchists" were
planning for violent action in he
streets next month
Rogers, in sharp contrast,
deplored "some unpleasant
sights" in the demonstration last
Wednesday. But he said that many
of the demonstrators were simply
trying to "register dramatic but
dignified expression of their deep
concern for peace in Vietnam.
And we listened to these voices
with respect ..."
