# You Are What You Eat
## Committee Report Roasts Food Service 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Once upon a time a Branner
sponsor skipped the ice cream at
lunch. They were serving
peppermint, and he liked
chocolate. A few minutes after he
sat down in the dining room, he
noticed other students with
chocolate ice cream. So he went
back to the kitchen to get some,
but the checker wouldn't let him
in.
"You've had some already, and
there are no seconds. " When the
sponsor tried to explain, the
checker retorted, "I just don't
believe you. "
Enraged, the sponsor marched
off to see William Myers, Food
Service Director. After a number
of rather acute remarks in which
the sponsor accused Myers of not
believing in students, the plaintiff
started to leave. One of the
secretaries flipped the sponsor a
quarter and suggested he try
Baskin-Robbins if he still wanted
some chocolate.

Like most good legends, this
story is only partly true, but it
does stand as a good example of
the headaches that perenially
plague the Stanford Food Service.
No one likes it or most of what
it serves. The people who work
for it are dyspeptic ogres that
charge outrageous prices.
On the other hand, the Food
Service feels that some distrust is
warranted when students illegally
share meal tickets and feed their
friends free.
To fathom all these problems,
President Pitzer set up a
student-faculty committee last
December to look into the Food
Service. Late in May the report
was submitted, but the Dean of
Student's Office refuses to release
it, claiming the report is still
"under study." But already there
are strong opinions on it.
"The present bureaucratic
organization of the Food Service
virtually insures that local desires
will not be satisfied," firmly states
the committee report, in a copy
obtained by The Daily.
Myers in turn declares, "Most
of the information is based on
personal observations that could
have been written the day the
committee was formed."
Report's Two Points
The report centered
around two basic points:
"Although the constant demands
that students place on the Food
Service are ever-changing, even
whimsical, they are nonetheless
immediately important to the
comfort of those who make them;
if they are apparently reasonable
and unmet, discontent or
sullenness can swiftly follow."

Secondly, the report claimed:
"This Committee recommends
that . . . directors be given greater
discretion over the operation of
their dining rooms . . . Such a step
is essential if the problem of
institutional inflexibility is to be
solved."
In addition to calling for a
more sensitive and decentralized
administration, the committee
recommends multiple board
options that would allow students
to choose the meals they wanted,
integration of the Food Service
into the Dean of Student's office
instead of the Business Office, and
a meal transfer program with
fraternities.
To begin with, Myers feels that
the committee membership
"wasn't representative. The
make-up was quite interesting.
There was no one from the Food
Service."
There were four students: Joe
Brooks, who graduated last June,
Jill Arens,John Ordway.and Mary
Ann Flitter. Other members were
English professor John Bender,
Branner faculty resident, Margaret
Burke, former director of Lagunita
and now with the Dean of Students
Office, and Bob Freelen, Assoc
iate Dean of Students.
Food Service Unsympathetic
The 28-page report uses its
strongest language with the claim
that the Food Service is
unsympathetic and inconsiderate.
The committee cited "arbitrary
attitudes on the part of Food
Service personnel (especially
hashers), inflexible rules, a lack of
responsiveness . . . and an attitude
of distrust towards students

The report concluded that
"where authority is centralized in
one office for the entire campus,
responses to demands for change
are slow, cumbersome, and give
the impression of unconcern."
The committee quoted from a
report written by Branner
students last fall that stated "the
personnel problem at Branner is
compounded by certain
intolerable assumptions on the
part of the Food Service
Officialdom about Stanford
students and the way they should
be treated."
Gun-Shy of Students
Myers agrees that some hashers
"can be pretty unpleasant," but
he added, "We're gun-shy of
students because we're taken so
often." He mentioned a student
who asked for a special meal
program but continued to eat
other meals despite the
agreement. "I told her I wasn't
angry but that it made me doubt
the next student who came in
asking for something special. It's
hard not to have preconceived

notions about students
sometimes."
With regard to student opinion
of the Food Service, Myers
maintains "I'm not aware of a
great deal of animosity." The
report surprised him in its tone.
"I've eaten in the dorms when the
food wasn't very good, but lately
we've been getting many
compliments in Wilbur on the way
things are going."
Myers points out "we're not
really capable of satisfying all the
students. If we change something
either way, criticism will be just as
bad."
In answer to the second charge
of Myers feels
that more autonomy simply is not
feasible. "All the halls operate
under one budget." For example,
Branner loses money on its
operations, but in larger dorms
money can be saved. A close
watch must be kept on all
expenditures to keep the budget
balanced, Myers claims.
Centralized Administration
Professor John Bender argues

that "all the centralized
administration worries about are
silly things instead of trying to
really save money. There are
widely varying needs.
Centralization is the malady of
the Food Service."
But the director considers his
organization "more flexible than
ever before. Four years ago there
were none of the opportunities
that students have today like open
meal transfers, additional servings,
and meal options." He pointed to
the optional breakfast plan this
year along with liberalized meal
exemptions for work, class, or
medical reasons.
Part of the reason for strong
central planning, Myers says, is
the four year budget plan. The
university freezes the board cost
for four years, and the Food
Service makes long range
estimates on its food expenses. In
practice the Service tries to
accumulate a surplus during its
first two years to pay for rising
costs in the last two years. "It's a
very complex system," states

Myers, and in his view tampering
with these predictions makes
planning difficult, especially in
the face of rising labor and food
expenses.
The committee paid little
attention to fiscal considerations,
the director felt. "Most of their
comments were strictly personal."
Financial Data Difficult
Bender declares that "the
financial data is difficult for a
layman to understand. It's
impossible for a committee
without professional help or a
budget." He added that because
of this weakness, "the statistical
and financial credibility severely
hampered the report."
Financial considerations aside,
the committee declared, "It is
incomprehensible . . . why the
residents of various living units
cannot be allowed to determine
their own priorities within the
established budget limitations."
Says Bender: "If the students
way to have moochers share their
meals, why not?"

Committee member John
Ordway claims "there is just no
imagination. Nobody over there
thinks up anything."
Committee Suggestions
To improve dorm life, the
report suggested that the Service
"employ one very good chef who
would spend a specified amount
of time in each of the system's
kitchens" or possibly a "retraining


FRIEND OK FOE-William Myers,
Food Service Director, says he is
"gun-shy" of students tor good reason.
of cooks for improved
performance and morale."
Board options were also
discussed, with the committee
recommending that students be
allowed to choose among several
options. The choices included
four alternatives: breakfast, lunch,
and dinner during the week and
all meals on the weekend. There
would be a two choice minimum.
Myers admits that readjusting
the board system would be more
equitable, but it would necessitate
a new price scale as well. "The
only people who can change the
board rate are the trustees."
Myers said that new prices would
be difficult to reconcile with the
four year planning cycle, even
though annual readjustments
might be easier.
Food Service Committee
Myers thinks that a standing
Food Service committee is a good
idea, but hopes "there could be
someone on it from this office."
The r€»port recommends that the
committee continue for another
quarter so that the members can
study financial problems of the
Service more fully.
In general the committee itself
has mixed feelings on the report.
Ordway complains that "Besides
being thanked by Pitzer for our
work, I haven't heard a thing from
anyone about the report." But
Bender is "convinced the
breakfast option is an outgrowth
of the report, though there is a
great deal of institutional inertia
on the other points."
Once upon a time a Branner
sponsor skipped the ice cream at
lunch. They were serving
peppermint, and he liked
chocolate. A few minutes after he

angry but that it made me doubt
the next student who came in
asking for something special. It's
hard not to have preconceived

notions about students
sometimes."
With regard to student opinion
of the Food Service, Myers
maintains "I'm not aware of a
great deal of animosity." The
report surprised him in its tone.
"I've eaten in the dorms when the
food wasn't very good, but lately
we've been getting many
compliments in Wilbur on the way
things are going."
Myers points out "we're not
really capable of satisfying all the
students. If we change something
either way, criticism will be just as
bad."
In answer to the second charge
of Myers feels
that more autonomy simply is not
feasible. "All the halls operate
under one budget." For example,
Branner loses money on its
operations, but in larger dorms
money can be saved. A close
watch must be kept on all
expenditures to keep the budget
balanced, Myers claims.
Centralized Administration
Professor John Bender argues

that "all the centralized
administration worries about are
silly things instead of trying to
really save money. There are
widely varying needs.
Centralization is the malady of
the Food Service."
But the director considers his
organization "more flexible than
ever before. Four years ago there
were none of the opportunities
that students have today like open
meal transfers, additional servings,
and meal options." He pointed to
the optional breakfast plan this
year along with liberalized meal
exemptions for work, class, or
medical reasons.
Part of the reason for strong
central planning, Myers says, is
the four year budget plan. The
university freezes the board cost
for four years, and the Food
Service makes long range
estimates on its food expenses. In
practice the Service tries to
accumulate a surplus during its
first two years to pay for rising
costs in the last two years. "It's a
very complex system," states

Myers, and in his view tampering
with these predictions makes
planning difficult, especially in
the face of rising labor and food
expenses.
The committee paid little
attention to fiscal considerations,
the director felt. "Most of their
comments were strictly personal."
Financial Data Difficult
Bender declares that "the
financial data is difficult for a
layman to understand. It's
impossible for a committee
without professional help or a
budget." He added that because
of this weakness, "the statistical
and financial credibility severely
hampered the report."
Financial considerations aside,
the committee declared, "It is
incomprehensible . . . why the
residents of various living units
cannot be allowed to determine
their own priorities within the
established budget limitations."
Says Bender: "If the students
way to have moochers share their
meals, why not?"

Committee member John
Ordway claims "there is just no
imagination. Nobody over there
thinks up anything."
Committee Suggestions
To improve dorm life, the
report suggested that the Service
"employ one very good chef who
would spend a specified amount
of time in each of the system's
kitchens" or possibly a "retraining


FRIEND OK FOE-William Myers,
Food Service Director, says he is
"gun-shy" of students tor good reason.
of cooks for improved
performance and morale."
Board options were also
discussed, with the committee
recommending that students be
allowed to choose among several
options. The choices included
four alternatives: breakfast, lunch,
and dinner during the week and
all meals on the weekend. There
would be a two choice minimum.
Myers admits that readjusting
the board system would be more
equitable, but it would necessitate
a new price scale as well. "The
only people who can change the
board rate are the trustees."
Myers said that new prices would
be difficult to reconcile with the
four year planning cycle, even
though annual readjustments
might be easier.
Food Service Committee
Myers thinks that a standing
Food Service committee is a good
idea, but hopes "there could be
someone on it from this office."
The r€»port recommends that the
committee continue for another
quarter so that the members can
study financial problems of the
Service more fully.
In general the committee itself
has mixed feelings on the report.
Ordway complains that "Besides
being thanked by Pitzer for our
work, I haven't heard a thing from
anyone about the report." But
Bender is "convinced the
breakfast option is an outgrowth
of the report, though there is a
great deal of institutional inertia
on the other points."
Once upon a time a Branner
sponsor skipped the ice cream at
lunch. They were serving
peppermint, and he liked
chocolate. A few minutes after he
sat down in the dining room, he
noticed other students with
chocolate ice cream. So he went
back to the kitchen to get some,
but the checker wouldn't let him
in.
"You've had some already, and
there are no seconds. " When the
sponsor tried to explain, the
checker retorted, "I just don't
believe you. "
Enraged, the sponsor marched
off to see William Myers, Food
Service Director. After a number
of rather acute remarks in which
the sponsor accused Myers of not
believing in students, the plaintiff
started to leave. One of the
secretaries flipped the sponsor a
quarter and suggested he try
Baskin-Robbins if he still wanted
some chocolate.
* * *
Like most good legends, this
story is only partly true, but it
does stand as a good example of
the headaches that perenially
plague the Stanford Food Service.
No one likes it or most of what
it serves. The people who work
for it are dyspeptic ogres that
charge outrageous prices.
On the other hand, the Food
Service feels that some distrust is
warranted when students illegally
share meal tickets and feed their
friends free.
To fathom all these problems,
President Pitzer set up a
student-faculty committee last
December to look into the Food
Service. Late in May the report
was submitted, but the Dean of
Student's Office refuses to release
it, claiming the report is still
"under study." But already there
are strong opinions on it.
"The present bureaucratic
organization of the Food Service
virtually insures that local desires
will not be satisfied," firmly states
the committee report, in a copy
obtained by The Daily.
Myers in turn declares, "Most
of the information is based on
personal observations that could
have been written the day the
committee was formed."
Report's Two Points
The report centered
around two basic points:
"Although the constant demands
that students place on the Food
Service are ever-changing, even
whimsical, they are nonetheless
immediately important to the
comfort of those who make them;
if they are apparently reasonable
and unmet, discontent or
sullenness can swiftly follow."

Secondly, the report claimed:
"This Committee recommends
that . . . directors be given greater
discretion over the operation of
their dining rooms . . . Such a step
is essential if the problem of
institutional inflexibility is to be
solved."
In addition to calling for a
more sensitive and decentralized
administration, the committee
recommends multiple board
options that would allow students
to choose the meals they wanted,
integration of the Food Service
into the Dean of Student's office
instead of the Business Office, and
a meal transfer program with
fraternities.
To begin with, Myers feels that
the committee membership
"wasn't representative. The
make-up was quite interesting.
There was no one from the Food
Service."
There were four students: Joe
Brooks, who graduated last June,
Jill Arens,John Ordway.and Mary
Ann Flitter. Other members were
English professor John Bender,
Branner faculty resident, Margaret
Burke, former director of Lagunita
and now with the Dean of Students
Office, and Bob Freelen, Assoc
iate Dean of Students.
Food Service Unsympathetic
The 28-page report uses its
strongest language with the claim
that the Food Service is
unsympathetic and inconsiderate.
The committee cited "arbitrary
attitudes on the part of Food
Service personnel (especially
hashers), inflexible rules, a lack of
responsiveness . . . and an attitude
of distrust towards students

The report concluded that
"where authority is centralized in
one office for the entire campus,
responses to demands for change
are slow, cumbersome, and give
the impression of unconcern."
The committee quoted from a
report written by Branner
students last fall that stated "the
personnel problem at Branner is
compounded by certain
intolerable assumptions on the
part of the Food Service
Officialdom about Stanford
students and the way they should
be treated."
Gun-Shy of Students
Myers agrees that some hashers
"can be pretty unpleasant," but
he added, "We're gun-shy of
students because we're taken so
often." He mentioned a student
who asked for a special meal
program but continued to eat
other meals despite the
agreement. "I told her I wasn't
angry but that it made me doubt
the next student who came in
asking for something special. It's
hard not to have preconceived

notions about students
sometimes."
With regard to student opinion
of the Food Service, Myers
maintains "I'm not aware of a
great deal of animosity." The
report surprised him in its tone.

sponsor skipped the ice cream at
lunch. They were serving
peppermint, and he liked
chocolate. A few minutes after he
sat down in the dining room, he
noticed other students with
chocolate ice cream. So he went
back to the kitchen to get some,
but the checker wouldn't let him
in.
"You've had some already, and
there are no seconds. " When the
sponsor tried to explain, the
checker retorted, "I just don't
believe you. "
Enraged, the sponsor marched
off to see William Myers, Food
Service Director. After a number
of rather acute remarks in which
the sponsor accused Myers of not
believing in students, the plaintiff
started to leave. One of the
secretaries flipped the sponsor a
quarter and suggested he try
Baskin-Robbins if he still wanted
some chocolate.

Like most good legends, this
story is only partly true, but it
does stand as a good example of
the headaches that perenially
plague the Stanford Food Service.
No one likes it or most of what
it serves. The people who work
for it are dyspeptic ogres that
charge outrageous prices.
On the other hand, the Food
Service feels that some distrust is
warranted when students illegally
share meal tickets and feed their
friends free.
To fathom all these problems,
President Pitzer set up a
student-faculty committee last
December to look into the Food
Service. Late in May the report
was submitted, but the Dean of
Student's Office refuses to release
it, claiming the report is still
"under study." But already there
are strong opinions on it.
"The present bureaucratic
organization of the Food Service
virtually insures that local desires
will not be satisfied," firmly states
the committee report, in a copy
obtained by The Daily.
Myers in turn declares, "Most
of the information is based on
personal observations that could
have been written the day the
committee was formed."
Report's Two Points
The report centered
around two basic points:
"Although the constant demands
that students place on the Food
Service are ever-changing, even
whimsical, they are nonetheless
immediately important to the
comfort of those who make them;
if they are apparently reasonable
and unmet, discontent or
sullenness can swiftly follow."

Secondly, the report claimed:
"This Committee recommends
that . . . directors be given greater
discretion over the operation of
their dining rooms . . . Such a step
is essential if the problem of
institutional inflexibility is to be
solved."
In addition to calling for a
more sensitive and decentralized
administration, the committee
recommends multiple board
options that would allow students
to choose the meals they wanted,
integration of the Food Service
into the Dean of Student's office
instead of the Business Office, and
a meal transfer program with
fraternities.
To begin with, Myers feels that
the committee membership
"wasn't representative. The
make-up was quite interesting.
There was no one from the Food
Service."
There were four students: Joe
Brooks, who graduated last June,
Jill Arens,John Ordway.and Mary
Ann Flitter. Other members were
English professor John Bender,
Branner faculty resident, Margaret
Burke, former director of Lagunita
and now with the Dean of Students
Office, and Bob Freelen, Assoc
iate Dean of Students.
Food Service Unsympathetic
The 28-page report uses its
strongest language with the claim
that the Food Service is
unsympathetic and inconsiderate.
The committee cited "arbitrary
attitudes on the part of Food
Service personnel (especially
hashers), inflexible rules, a lack of
responsiveness . . . and an attitude
of distrust towards students

The report concluded that
"where authority is centralized in
one office for the entire campus,
responses to demands for change
are slow, cumbersome, and give
the impression of unconcern."
The committee quoted from a
report written by Branner
students last fall that stated "the
personnel problem at Branner is
compounded by certain
intolerable assumptions on the
part of the Food Service
Officialdom about Stanford
students and the way they should
be treated."
Gun-Shy of Students
Myers agrees that some hashers
"can be pretty unpleasant," but
he added, "We're gun-shy of
students because we're taken so
often." He mentioned a student
who asked for a special meal
program but continued to eat
other meals despite the
agreement. "I told her I wasn't
angry but that it made me doubt
the next student who came in
asking for something special. It's
hard not to have preconceived

notions about students
sometimes."
With regard to student opinion
of the Food Service, Myers
maintains "I'm not aware of a
great deal of animosity." The
report surprised him in its tone.
"I've eaten in the dorms when the
food wasn't very good, but lately
we've been getting many
compliments in Wilbur on the way
things are going."
Myers points out "we're not
really capable of satisfying all the
students. If we change something
either way, criticism will be just as
bad."
In answer to the second charge
of Myers feels
that more autonomy simply is not
feasible. "All the halls operate
under one budget." For example,
Branner loses money on its
operations, but in larger dorms
money can be saved. A close
watch must be kept on all
expenditures to keep the budget
balanced, Myers claims.
Centralized Administration
Professor John Bender argues

that "all the centralized
administration worries about are
silly things instead of trying to
really save money. There are
widely varying needs.
Centralization is the malady of
the Food Service."
But the director considers his
organization "more flexible than
ever before. Four years ago there
were none of the opportunities
that students have today like open
meal transfers, additional servings,
and meal options." He pointed to
the optional breakfast plan this
year along with liberalized meal
exemptions for work, class, or
medical reasons.
Part of the reason for strong
central planning, Myers says, is
the four year budget plan. The
university freezes the board cost
for four years, and the Food
Service makes long range
estimates on its food expenses. In
practice the Service tries to
accumulate a surplus during its
first two years to pay for rising
costs in the last two years. "It's a
very complex system," states

Myers, and in his view tampering
with these predictions makes
planning difficult, especially in
the face of rising labor and food
expenses.
The committee paid little
attention to fiscal considerations,
the director felt. "Most of their
comments were strictly personal."
Financial Data Difficult
Bender declares that "the
financial data is difficult for a
layman to understand. It's
impossible for a committee
without professional help or a
budget." He added that because
of this weakness, "the statistical
and financial credibility severely
hampered the report."
Financial considerations aside,
the committee declared, "It is
incomprehensible . . . why the
residents of various living units
cannot be allowed to determine
their own priorities within the
established budget limitations."
Says Bender: "If the students
way to have moochers share their
meals, why not?"

Committee member John
Ordway claims "there is just no
imagination. Nobody over there
thinks up anything."
Committee Suggestions
To improve dorm life, the
report suggested that the Service
"employ one very good chef who
would spend a specified amount
of time in each of the system's
kitchens" or possibly a "retraining


FRIEND OK FOE-William Myers,
Food Service Director, says he is
"gun-shy" of students tor good reason.
of cooks for improved
performance and morale."
Board options were also
discussed, with the committee
recommending that students be
allowed to choose among several
options. The choices included
four alternatives: breakfast, lunch,
and dinner during the week and
all meals on the weekend. There
would be a two choice minimum.
Myers admits that readjusting
the board system would be more
equitable, but it would necessitate
a new price scale as well. "The
only people who can change the
board rate are the trustees."
Myers said that new prices would
be difficult to reconcile with the
four year planning cycle, even
though annual readjustments
might be easier.
Food Service Committee
Myers thinks that a standing
Food Service committee is a good
idea, but hopes "there could be
someone on it from this office."
The r€»port recommends that the
committee continue for another
quarter so that the members can
study financial problems of the
Service more fully.
In general the committee itself
has mixed feelings on the report.
Ordway complains that "Besides
being thanked by Pitzer for our
work, I haven't heard a thing from
anyone about the report." But
Bender is "convinced the
breakfast option is an outgrowth
of the report, though there is a
great deal of institutional inertia
on the other points."
Once upon a time a Branner
sponsor skipped the ice cream at
lunch. They were serving
peppermint, and he liked
chocolate. A few minutes after he
sat down in the dining room, he
noticed other students with

asking for something special. It's
hard not to have preconceived

notions about students
sometimes."
With regard to student opinion
of the Food Service, Myers
maintains "I'm not aware of a
great deal of animosity." The
report surprised him in its tone.
"I've eaten in the dorms when the
food wasn't very good, but lately
we've been getting many
compliments in Wilbur on the way
things are going."
Myers points out "we're not
really capable of satisfying all the
students. If we change something
either way, criticism will be just as
bad."
In answer to the second charge
of Myers feels
that more autonomy simply is not
feasible. "All the halls operate
under one budget." For example,
Branner loses money on its
operations, but in larger dorms
money can be saved. A close
watch must be kept on all
expenditures to keep the budget
balanced, Myers claims.
Centralized Administration
Professor John Bender argues

that "all the centralized
administration worries about are
silly things instead of trying to
really save money. There are
widely varying needs.
Centralization is the malady of
the Food Service."
But the director considers his
organization "more flexible than
ever before. Four years ago there
were none of the opportunities
that students have today like open
meal transfers, additional servings,
and meal options." He pointed to
the optional breakfast plan this
year along with liberalized meal
exemptions for work, class, or
medical reasons.
Part of the reason for strong
central planning, Myers says, is
the four year budget plan. The
university freezes the board cost
for four years, and the Food
Service makes long range
estimates on its food expenses. In
practice the Service tries to
accumulate a surplus during its
first two years to pay for rising
costs in the last two years. "It's a
very complex system," states

Myers, and in his view tampering
with these predictions makes
planning difficult, especially in
the face of rising labor and food
expenses.
The committee paid little
attention to fiscal considerations,
the director felt. "Most of their
comments were strictly personal."
Financial Data Difficult
Bender declares that "the
financial data is difficult for a
layman to understand. It's
impossible for a committee
without professional help or a
budget." He added that because
of this weakness, "the statistical
and financial credibility severely
hampered the report."
Financial considerations aside,
the committee declared, "It is
incomprehensible . . . why the
residents of various living units
cannot be allowed to determine
their own priorities within the
established budget limitations."
Says Bender: "If the students
way to have moochers share their
meals, why not?"

Committee member John
Ordway claims "there is just no
imagination. Nobody over there
thinks up anything."
Committee Suggestions
To improve dorm life, the
report suggested that the Service
"employ one very good chef who
would spend a specified amount
of time in each of the system's
kitchens" or possibly a "retraining


FRIEND OK FOE-William Myers,
Food Service Director, says he is
"gun-shy" of students tor good reason.
of cooks for improved
performance and morale."
Board options were also
discussed, with the committee
recommending that students be
allowed to choose among several
options. The choices included
four alternatives: breakfast, lunch,
and dinner during the week and
all meals on the weekend. There
would be a two choice minimum.
Myers admits that readjusting
the board system would be more
equitable, but it would necessitate
a new price scale as well. "The
only people who can change the
board rate are the trustees."
Myers said that new prices would
be difficult to reconcile with the
four year planning cycle, even
though annual readjustments
might be easier.
Food Service Committee
Myers thinks that a standing
Food Service committee is a good
idea, but hopes "there could be
someone on it from this office."
The r€»port recommends that the
committee continue for another
quarter so that the members can
study financial problems of the
Service more fully.
In general the committee itself
has mixed feelings on the report.
Ordway complains that "Besides
being thanked by Pitzer for our
work, I haven't heard a thing from
anyone about the report." But
Bender is "convinced the
breakfast option is an outgrowth
of the report, though there is a
great deal of institutional inertia
on the other points."
Once upon a time a Branner
sponsor skipped the ice cream at
lunch. They were serving
peppermint, and he liked
chocolate. A few minutes after he
sat down in the dining room, he
noticed other students with
chocolate ice cream. So he went
back to the kitchen to get some,
but the checker wouldn't let him
in.
"You've had some already, and
there are no seconds. " When the
sponsor tried to explain, the
checker retorted, "I just don't
believe you. "
Enraged, the sponsor marched
off to see William Myers, Food
Service Director. After a number
of rather acute remarks in which
the sponsor accused Myers of not
believing in students, the plaintiff
started to leave. One of the
secretaries flipped the sponsor a
quarter and suggested he try
Baskin-Robbins if he still wanted
some chocolate.
* * *
Like most good legends, this
story is only partly true, but it
does stand as a good example of
the headaches that perenially
plague the Stanford Food Service.
No one likes it or most of what
it serves. The people who work
for it are dyspeptic ogres that
charge outrageous prices.
On the other hand, the Food
Service feels that some distrust is
warranted when students illegally
share meal tickets and feed their
friends free.
To fathom all these problems,
President Pitzer set up a
student-faculty committee last
December to look into the Food
Service. Late in May the report
was submitted, but the Dean of
Student's Office refuses to release
it, claiming the report is still
"under study." But already there
are strong opinions on it.
"The present bureaucratic
organization of the Food Service
virtually insures that local desires
will not be satisfied," firmly states
the committee report, in a copy
obtained by The Daily.
Myers in turn declares, "Most
of the information is based on
personal observations that could
have been written the day the
committee was formed."
Report's Two Points
The report centered
around two basic points:
"Although the constant demands
that students place on the Food
Service are ever-changing, even
whimsical, they are nonetheless
immediately important to the
comfort of those who make them;
if they are apparently reasonable
and unmet, discontent or
sullenness can swiftly follow."

Secondly, the report claimed:
"This Committee recommends
that . . . directors be given greater
discretion over the operation of
their dining rooms . . . Such a step
is essential if the problem of
institutional inflexibility is to be
solved."
In addition to calling for a
more sensitive and decentralized
administration, the committee
recommends multiple board
options that would allow students
to choose the meals they wanted,
integration of the Food Service
into the Dean of Student's office
instead of the Business Office, and
a meal transfer program with
fraternities.
To begin with, Myers feels that
the committee membership
"wasn't representative. The
make-up was quite interesting.
There was no one from the Food
Service."
There were four students: Joe
Brooks, who graduated last June,
Jill Arens,John Ordway.and Mary
Ann Flitter. Other members were
English professor John Bender,
Branner faculty resident, Margaret
Burke, former director of Lagunita
and now with the Dean of Students
Office, and Bob Freelen, Assoc
iate Dean of Students.
Food Service Unsympathetic
The 28-page report uses its
strongest language with the claim
that the Food Service is
unsympathetic and inconsiderate.
The committee cited "arbitrary
attitudes on the part of Food
Service personnel (especially
hashers), inflexible rules, a lack of
responsiveness . . . and an attitude
of distrust towards students

The report concluded that
"where authority is centralized in
one office for the entire campus,
responses to demands for change
are slow, cumbersome, and give
the impression of unconcern."
The committee quoted from a
report written by Branner
students last fall that stated "the
personnel problem at Branner is
compounded by certain
intolerable assumptions on the
part of the Food Service
Officialdom about Stanford
students and the way they should
be treated."
Gun-Shy of Students
Myers agrees that some hashers
"can be pretty unpleasant," but
he added, "We're gun-shy of
students because we're taken so
often." He mentioned a student
who asked for a special meal
program but continued to eat
other meals despite the
agreement. "I told her I wasn't
angry but that it made me doubt
the next student who came in
asking for something special. It's
hard not to have preconceived

notions about students
sometimes."
With regard to student opinion
of the Food Service, Myers
maintains "I'm not aware of a
great deal of animosity." The
report surprised him in its tone.
"I've eaten in the dorms when the

peppermint, and he liked
chocolate. A few minutes after he
sat down in the dining room, he
noticed other students with
chocolate ice cream. So he went
back to the kitchen to get some,
but the checker wouldn't let him
in.
"You've had some already, and
there are no seconds. " When the
sponsor tried to explain, the
checker retorted, "I just don't
believe you. "
Enraged, the sponsor marched
off to see William Myers, Food
Service Director. After a number
of rather acute remarks in which
the sponsor accused Myers of not
believing in students, the plaintiff
started to leave. One of the
secretaries flipped the sponsor a
quarter and suggested he try
Baskin-Robbins if he still wanted
some chocolate.
* * *
Like most good legends, this
story is only partly true, but it
does stand as a good example of
the headaches that perenially
plague the Stanford Food Service.
No one likes it or most of what
it serves. The people who work
for it are dyspeptic ogres that
charge outrageous prices.
On the other hand, the Food
Service feels that some distrust is
warranted when students illegally
share meal tickets and feed their
friends free.
To fathom all these problems,
President Pitzer set up a
student-faculty committee last
December to look into the Food
Service. Late in May the report
was submitted, but the Dean of
Student's Office refuses to release
it, claiming the report is still
"under study." But already there
are strong opinions on it.
"The present bureaucratic
organization of the Food Service
virtually insures that local desires
will not be satisfied," firmly states
the committee report, in a copy
obtained by The Daily.
Myers in turn declares, "Most
of the information is based on
personal observations that could
have been written the day the
committee was formed."
Report's Two Points
The report centered
around two basic points:
"Although the constant demands
that students place on the Food
Service are ever-changing, even
whimsical, they are nonetheless
immediately important to the
comfort of those who make them;
if they are apparently reasonable
and unmet, discontent or
sullenness can swiftly follow."

Secondly, the report claimed:
"This Committee recommends
that . . . directors be given greater
discretion over the operation of
their dining rooms . . . Such a step
is essential if the problem of
institutional inflexibility is to be
solved."
In addition to calling for a
more sensitive and decentralized
administration, the committee
recommends multiple board
options that would allow students
to choose the meals they wanted,
integration of the Food Service
into the Dean of Student's office
instead of the Business Office, and
a meal transfer program with
fraternities.
To begin with, Myers feels that
the committee membership
"wasn't representative. The
make-up was quite interesting.
There was no one from the Food
Service."
There were four students: Joe
Brooks, who graduated last June,
Jill Arens,John Ordway.and Mary
Ann Flitter. Other members were
English professor John Bender,
Branner faculty resident, Margaret
Burke, former director of Lagunita
and now with the Dean of Students
Office, and Bob Freelen, Assoc
iate Dean of Students.
Food Service Unsympathetic
The 28-page report uses its
strongest language with the claim
that the Food Service is
unsympathetic and inconsiderate.
The committee cited "arbitrary
attitudes on the part of Food
Service personnel (especially
hashers), inflexible rules, a lack of
responsiveness . . . and an attitude
of distrust towards students

The report concluded that
"where authority is centralized in
one office for the entire campus,
responses to demands for change
are slow, cumbersome, and give
the impression of unconcern."
The committee quoted from a
report written by Branner
students last fall that stated "the
personnel problem at Branner is
compounded by certain
intolerable assumptions on the
part of the Food Service
Officialdom about Stanford
students and the way they should
be treated."
Gun-Shy of Students
Myers agrees that some hashers
"can be pretty unpleasant," but
he added, "We're gun-shy of
students because we're taken so
often." He mentioned a student
who asked for a special meal
program but continued to eat
other meals despite the
agreement. "I told her I wasn't
angry but that it made me doubt
the next student who came in
asking for something special. It's
hard not to have preconceived

notions about students
sometimes."
With regard to student opinion
of the Food Service, Myers
maintains "I'm not aware of a
great deal of animosity." The
report surprised him in its tone.
"I've eaten in the dorms when the
food wasn't very good, but lately
we've been getting many
compliments in Wilbur on the way
things are going."
Myers points out "we're not
really capable of satisfying all the
students. If we change something
either way, criticism will be just as
bad."
In answer to the second charge
of Myers feels
that more autonomy simply is not
feasible. "All the halls operate
under one budget." For example,
Branner loses money on its
operations, but in larger dorms
money can be saved. A close
watch must be kept on all
expenditures to keep the budget
balanced, Myers claims.
Centralized Administration
Professor John Bender argues

that "all the centralized
administration worries about are
silly things instead of trying to
really save money. There are
widely varying needs.
Centralization is the malady of
the Food Service."
But the director considers his
organization "more flexible than
ever before. Four years ago there
were none of the opportunities
that students have today like open
meal transfers, additional servings,
and meal options." He pointed to
the optional breakfast plan this
year along with liberalized meal
exemptions for work, class, or
medical reasons.
Part of the reason for strong
central planning, Myers says, is
the four year budget plan. The
university freezes the board cost
for four years, and the Food
Service makes long range
estimates on its food expenses. In
practice the Service tries to
accumulate a surplus during its
first two years to pay for rising
costs in the last two years. "It's a
very complex system," states

Myers, and in his view tampering
with these predictions makes
planning difficult, especially in
the face of rising labor and food
expenses.
The committee paid little
attention to fiscal considerations,
the director felt. "Most of their
comments were strictly personal."
Financial Data Difficult
Bender declares that "the
financial data is difficult for a
layman to understand. It's
impossible for a committee
without professional help or a
budget." He added that because
of this weakness, "the statistical
and financial credibility severely
hampered the report."
Financial considerations aside,
the committee declared, "It is
incomprehensible . . . why the
residents of various living units
cannot be allowed to determine
their own priorities within the
established budget limitations."
Says Bender: "If the students
way to have moochers share their
meals, why not?"

Committee member John
Ordway claims "there is just no
imagination. Nobody over there
thinks up anything."
Committee Suggestions
To improve dorm life, the
report suggested that the Service
"employ one very good chef who
would spend a specified amount
of time in each of the system's
kitchens" or possibly a "retraining

of cooks for improved
performance and morale."
Board options were also
discussed, with the committee
recommending that students be
allowed to choose among several
options. The choices included
four alternatives: breakfast, lunch,
and dinner during the week and
all meals on the weekend. There
would be a two choice minimum.
Myers admits that readjusting
the board system would be more
equitable, but it would necessitate
a new price scale as well. "The
only people who can change the
board rate are the trustees."
Myers said that new prices would
be difficult to reconcile with the
four year planning cycle, even
though annual readjustments
might be easier.
Food Service Committee
Myers thinks that a standing
Food Service committee is a good
idea, but hopes "there could be
someone on it from this office."
The r€»port recommends that the
committee continue for another
quarter so that the members can
study financial problems of the
Service more fully.
In general the committee itself
has mixed feelings on the report.
Ordway complains that "Besides
being thanked by Pitzer for our
work, I haven't heard a thing from
anyone about the report." But
Bender is "convinced the
breakfast option is an outgrowth
of the report, though there is a
great deal of institutional inertia
on the other points."
