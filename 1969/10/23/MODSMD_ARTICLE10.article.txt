# Israel Today
## Discrimination Against Christians 
### Dan Snell 
! Jerusalem, Oct. 11, 1969—This
City is full of people, but A. Paul
McGarvey seems a lonely man.
A missionary for the Christian
Missionary Alliance Church on the
Street of the Prophets in the New
City here, he can expect seven to
twenty people in church these
Sunday mornings.
. "My wife and I were in Japan
as missionaries for fifteen years
before we came here last year. I
had always wanted to come to
Israel, and they needed someone
here."
His accent was that of the
Middle West, and his service,
which 1 had gone to earlier in the
week, was straight out of the
genteel sawdust tradition. He had
the congregation sing slow hymns
Straight through—even obscure
hymns which no one seemed to
know.
Pious Pilgrims
i "We're not really here to
Convert anybody. We're here as a

a service to English-speaking
Protestants who live here in
Jerusalem or who visit it. There
are maybe 300 who live here the
year around, with about 60,000
tourists each year."
But McGarvey, sitting in his
carpeted little study next to the
Mea Sherim district, where live
many conservative Jews who wear
long ghetto coats and beards, see
few of either the residents or the
tourists.
"We have three or four ladies
whom I call 'pious pilgrims' who
come here and rent a room in
Jerusalem to spend their last
days."
Conversions
Missionary activity is not
1 united among Arabs, and
McGarvey's church has a
missionary couple who work to
convert Orthodox Christian Arabs
in the Old City to Protestantism. I
didn't ask why they bothered.

Missionary activity among Jews
of all ages is circumscribed.
Missionaries who are caught
'witnessing,' as McGarvey calls it,
among Jews, do not have their
visas renewed. Denominations can
maintain only the number ot
missionaries in Israel that they
had in the area in 19 18.
Occasionally a Jew will come
to McGarvey asking about
converting to Christianity. But
McGarvey, wary of the authorities
and concerned for an honest
conversion, sends the would-be
convert to a converted Jew who
speaks Hebrew to talk it over, as
he doesn't speak the language.
Disci imination
"Many times in cases like these
the people want to convert
because it is easier to leave the
country if they swear in court
that they are Christians. The
government doesn't ask any
questions at all of a Christian who

wants to leave," he said, smiling
waniy.
McGarvey said there is
definitely discrimination against
Christians who want to work in
Israel enterprises. They can expect
little advancement and usually
have trouble finding a job in the
first place. That partially explains
why McGarvey's flock is so small
and transient.
But Jerusalem is first a Jewish
city, and Israel a Jewish state, he
said. But as far as free access to
holy places is concerned,
McGarvey has observed no
restrictions at all, except
sometimes a site may be closed
for a few hours because of bomb
threat.
Soul Matters
Occasionally he helps the Old
City missionaries with a program
for their Arab converts, and he
says it is more rewarding than his
usual work. But many of the
Arabs don't want to talk about

"soul matters," as McGarvey
terms it. They are disturbed about
injustices done to them by the
Jews. "They ask how God can be
the true God if he loves both
them and the Jews. That's the
level of understanding we're
working with over here."
1 was planning to ask him how
he justified missionary work in a
country with developed
educational and medical services,
but it was out of place. He is a
service to tourists and his "pious
pilgrims."
He sits in his study, and works
on sermons, hoping to return to
the U.S. within a year, where his
two sons are in seminary. And he
looks out occasionally on he
miniscule green garden behind the
church, in the land where his Lord
once walked.

Occasionally a Jew will come

McGarvey said there is

little advancement and usually
have trouble finding a job in the

Arabs don't want to talk about

"soul matters," as McGarvey
terms it. They are disturbed about
injustices done to them by the
Jews. "They ask how God can be
the true God if he loves both
them and the Jews. That's the
level of understanding we're
working with over here."

country with developed

looks out occasionally on he

church, in the land where his Lord
once walked.
