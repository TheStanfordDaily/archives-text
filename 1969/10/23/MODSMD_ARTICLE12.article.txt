## 'Dead' Beatle Debated 
### 
Without either agreeing or
disagreeing with the
pronouncement of "dead" issued
by the world on Paul McCartney's
fallen carcass, 1 would like to
disagree with one statement made
by Tony Alcott in Wednesday's
Daily. Although, as stated, the
Beatles haven't gone on an active
tour for years, I do recall a
personal appearance made by
Lennon and McCartney on the
Tonight Show (with Joe Garagiola
sitting in) in the late winter or
spring of 1968, which was long
after my Sgt. Pepper album was
scratched and warped.
I suppose it could have been a
convincing job by Paul's look
alike, but anybody that good
deserves to fool the world.

Editor, THE DAILY:
For once in my life I got
something published in The Daily
and what happens? You leave out
the last sentence and my name,
even after you personally asked
me what year I am and what
major I have and we
congratualated each other on
being Seniors.
What happened? Zionists are
human and so am I. I wanted to
be recognized in order to be easily
available for praise and violent
attack. Instead I am anonymous.

Continual Replay
So let us recognize each other
and each other's aspirations and
move beyond a continual replay
of the argument to a solution.

• Low Wages
Editor, THE DAILY:
Stanford University has always
paid low wages. It has paid low
wages to students, to women,
especially to wives of students,
faculty and employees, to
minority groups, to immigrants,
to foreigners—to all who are
compelled by their circumstances
to accept any wages offered.
We must establish equitable
and uniform wages for all part
time and temporary employees.

This is necessary in order to
protect the wages of regular full
time employees. United Stanford
Employees (USE) has recognized
this need and is encouraging
membership by all non-faculty
Stanford wage earners.
My heart does not bleed for
Stanford because it must dip into
reserves to update wages long
overdue. Kenneth Cuthbertson,
Vice-President of Finances,
admitted the inequities of wages,
especially those of "loyal, long

term employees" and promised
action over a year ago. Again,
adjustments of wages and
classifications are promised by the
Administrator. Again these
promises are made because
employees, long apathetic, are
moving toward organization. Are
concessions promised to forestall
this organization?
Employees must be protected
from the fluctuations of grants
and from the whims of individual
faculty and administrators.
We must hold the Board of
Trustees and its administrators
financially responsible for
guaranteeing equitable wages and
for guaranteeing job security for
each and every Stanford
employee. At their last meeting,
the Trustees accepted this
responsibility in principle, and
partially in practice, by
establishing a minimum wage for
all employees.
United Stanford Employees
must bridge the gap and unite
blue collar and white collar
workers; black, brown, and white,
young and old, around our
common interests. It mast do so
in order to build one organization
powerful enough to win full
citizenship rights for employees,
in this, our community.

• Low Wages
Editor, THE DAILY:
Stanford University has always
paid low wages. It has paid low
wages to students, to women,
especially to wives of students,
faculty and employees, to
minority groups, to immigrants,
to foreigners—to all who are
compelled by their circumstances
to accept any wages offered.
We must establish equitable
and uniform wages for all part
time and temporary employees.

This is necessary in order to
protect the wages of regular full
time employees. United Stanford
Employees (USE) has recognized
this need and is encouraging
membership by all non-faculty
Stanford wage earners.
My heart does not bleed for
Stanford because it must dip into
reserves to update wages long
overdue. Kenneth Cuthbertson,
Vice-President of Finances,
admitted the inequities of wages,
especially those of "loyal, long

term employees" and promised
action over a year ago. Again,
adjustments of wages and
classifications are promised by the
Administrator. Again these
promises are made because
employees, long apathetic, are
moving toward organization. Are
concessions promised to forestall
this organization?
Employees must be protected
from the fluctuations of grants
and from the whims of individual
faculty and administrators.
We must hold the Board of
Trustees and its administrators
financially responsible for
guaranteeing equitable wages and
for guaranteeing job security for
each and every Stanford
employee. At their last meeting,
the Trustees accepted this
responsibility in principle, and
partially in practice, by
establishing a minimum wage for
all employees.
United Stanford Employees
must bridge the gap and unite
blue collar and white collar
workers; black, brown, and white,
young and old, around our
common interests. It mast do so
in order to build one organization
powerful enough to win full
citizenship rights for employees,
in this, our community.

Without either agreeing or
disagreeing with the
pronouncement of "dead" issued
by the world on Paul McCartney's
fallen carcass, 1 would like to
disagree with one statement made
by Tony Alcott in Wednesday's
Daily. Although, as stated, the
Beatles haven't gone on an active
tour for years, I do recall a
personal appearance made by
Lennon and McCartney on the
Tonight Show (with Joe Garagiola
sitting in) in the late winter or
spring of 1968, which was long
after my Sgt. Pepper album was
scratched and warped.
I suppose it could have been a
convincing job by Paul's look
alike, but anybody that good
deserves to fool the world.

For once in my life I got
something published in The Daily
and what happens? You leave out
the last sentence and my name,
even after you personally asked
me what year I am and what
major I have and we
congratualated each other on
being Seniors.
What happened? Zionists are
human and so am I. I wanted to
be recognized in order to be easily
available for praise and violent
attack. Instead I am anonymous.
