## Fight Smog 
### John Sumner 
Cars pollute. They account for
71% of the air pollution in the
Bay Area. They so foul the air
with their exhaust that we usually
cannot see the hills across the
Bay. The roads on which they run
are considered sources of
pollution and cannot he built near
reservoirs which hold public
drinking water.
The automobile rritviiiu'.cturers
say that improved emuissions
control devices w ; ii give us "1940
air by 1980". (Did y< *ver see
1940 air? I'll bet could.) I
challenge anyone who says that he
has a perfect smog control device
to connect a hose to the exhaust
pipe and breathe what comes out.
In fact, the only perfect smog
control device is one that allows
the exhaust to pour directly into
the drivers seat. That is the only
smog control device that will
work. Try it and see. Might be a
good way to stop the population
explosion, too.
If you believe in letting people
"do their own thing" as long as it

doesn't harm anyone else, then
you'd better not drive a car. Every
living thing has to breathe the air
that cars pollute. The pine trees in
the San Bernadino Mountains
breathe Los Angeles air and
they're dying. What about the
people that breathe Los Angeles
air? What about the people that
breathe Bay Area air?
K i<li* a Bike
Would you like to help clean
up the air? If you live within four
or five miles of the Stanford
campus, ride a bike—you'll
probably be able to make it
door-to-door faster than if you
drive. If you live more than five
miles from campus, join a car pool
(place an ad in the Daily or on the
bulletin boards around campus) or
use public transportation (a full
train or bus doesn't pollute any
more than an empty one).
