# Hypocrisy at IIC
## 'Progressive' Capitalism 
### Harry Cleaver 
(The following is the second
half of an article by Harry Cleaver
on his impressions of the
September International
Industrialist c Conference in San
Franc ifco.)
But by and large the talk was
of "democratizing" management
hierarchies, of "managing
democracy" by which the worker
is "given the sence" of having
helped make decisions while
management in fact maintains its
authority. Such talk can be
expected to dominate
"progressive" capitalism at least
until that next lIC four years
from now.
But occasionally, even with all
the rhetoric, the more sincere or
the more naive, saw the
contradiction between rhetoric
and reality. "We are measured by
the market place, earnings,
profitable growth," Koppers
Company president Fletcher
Byrom told a panel on the role of
the chief executive. "The hiftory

of our civilization is the
accumulation and concentration
of wealth and then its
redistribution by violent or
nonviolent means. Our problem is
how to redistribute it by
nonviolent means. Unfortunately
that is in contradiction with the
measurement of the market
place." And you know what—he's
right.
Where they were willing to
invest, the international capitalists
complained about government
restrictions on their operations,
requirements that they use local
materials, price control, and
restrictions on importing
expatriot management and
technicians.
At least part of the strategy
they offered the Third World
results from the increasing blind
capitalism finds itself in at its
metropoles. Suggesting it is an
"illusion" that inequalities
between rich and poor countries
are great, Rockefeller admitted
that in the seventies the rich
nations will be preoccupied "as
never before" with inflation—that
is, with the scarcity of capital—"as
a consequence of their own
development problems."
The rich countries, Rockefeller
said, will need "an increasing flow
of imports" from Third World
countries to "help discipline"
their economies. This means
increasing exports of Third World
resources, agricultural crops and
the location of some
manufacturing for export there,
where the international companies
will take advantage of cheap
labor.
But despite some broadening
of the export base in Third World
countries this type of growth will
not serve well to develop them.
Rather it will further their
integration into international
economy dominated by
multinational corporations. They
will remain rural satellites using
export credits to pay for
consumer goods and for the

infrastructure needs dictated by
their specialization.
Rockefeller to the contrary,
the capitalists' concern with
future inflation was not a concern
with its impact on the Third
World. Marjolin hinted that Third
World aid would be treated "as a
residue—measured by what is left
after all the other needs have been
satisfied." Those needs will be
great, he said. He foresaw a capital
pinch in which military
expenditures modernizing
industrial equipment, "massively"
increased costs for government
services, health, housing,
transportation, pollution, and
"exploration of the universe" will
predominate.
David Rockefeller set the tone
of the conference by announcing
the new version of 19th century
"free trade" policy by pushing
imports from the Third World and
by refering to the demonstration
outside as "young people." When
the maladroit Mausrice Stans, U.S.
Secretary of Commerce, spoke on
the same subjects and emphasized
U.S. expansion and refered to the
"young people" as "kooks from
SDS" who should "crawl back
under their rocks," he was met on
the most part by embarrassed
silence.
"I do not think that the profit
motive is any more the prime or
sole objective of our enterprise,"
Gerd Tacke, chairman of
Germany's Siemens and master of
268,000 employees, told one
panel. "If we want to attract the
younger generation, we have to
give them some more
motivations." Tacke was forced to
retract that and to admit that
"profit and the best growth rate
must be first in the mind of the
chief executive." But some of the
industrialists went so far as to call
the liberal rhetoric leftist.
"Should it really be our objective
to close the income gap?" Blackie
asked, "To me the term has a
rather odious Marxist
implication."
