# Ups and Downs
## 'Physics And Man' 
### 
Nobel Laureate Robert
Hofstader related a highly
personal tale of the ups and
downs, excitement and
disappointments of scientific
investigation when he opened the
"Physics and Man" lecture series
Tuesday night before a crowd of
more than 300 people.
Professor Hofstadter recounted
his laborious search for a good
material to detect gamma rays and
particle radiation. It led to his
discovery of sodium iodide
crystals "doped" with thallium
impurity, which have proved
enormously successful as
detectors.
His presentation included slides
showing important events in his
search, and also several

demonstrations involving sodium
iodide.
"My career has been
intertwined with this unusual
crystalline substance for over 21
years," he said. "It is very much
like the more common table salt,
sodium chloride.
"The principal difference is
that sodium iodide is
deliquescent; it attracts water to
itself and dissolves in its own
water. It becomes a messy brown
liquid with iodine staining
properties."
When Prof. Hofstadter first
published his findings on sodium
iodide, he said "it attracted some
interest and some disbelief as
well." His patience was further
tried by the fact that the photo
illustrating his findings was
printed upside down (which
tended to muddle the results).
"The publication printed a
correction in the next issue,"said
the Stanford physicist, "but
imagine my disappointment.
However, other people soon
checked my observations and
found them to be correct. But
because of the instability of the
material, very few individuals
actually used it."
Crystals
In 1948, working with one of
his doctoral students, John A.
Mclntyre, he used the crystals in a
new experiment to see if they
could measure the intensity of
gamma rays. The experiment was
a great success.
"This was the first application
of sodium iodide as a real
spectrometer for measuring
gamma ray energies," said Prof.
Hofstadter. "Mclntyre and I
stayed up all night accumulating
data.
"We published papers
immediately on these results, but
the news got around even before
publication, and the whole world
started to use sodium iodide as a
gamma ray spectrometer.
When the high-energy particles
from an accelerator or other
source enter the crystal, he
explained, reactions with other
particles or nuclei occur within a
short distance. The energy
released causes flashes of light,
and light-sensitive photomultiplier
tubes around the crystal measure
thy brightness and timing of
thyflashes, thereby providing data

to identify the types of particles
and their energies.
"From that point on sodium
iodide was a fabulous success,"
continued Prof. Hofstadter. "I
cannot detail the tens of
thousands of applications for it,
but I can give some idea of its
usefulness by saying thaat one
cannot pick up a single journal in
nuclear physics without finding it
in one or more papers as a
fundamental tool.
Decay Processes
"One of the most important
experiments was done by Miss Wu
and her collaborators in 1957 in
which they discovered the
non-conservation of parity in
weak decay processes. In this
experiment sodium iodide was
used as a crucial detector of the
condition of polarization of the
nuclei.
"An independent application
of these crystals arose in the
medical field in the early 1950'5.
Medical research investigators
began to use radioactive tracer
techniques in studying and
diagnosing tumors and other
disorders of the various organs of
the body.
"For example, the thyroid
gland takes up large quantities of
iodine when this element is
introduced in the human body.
lodine can be made radioactive,
and in this form it emits gamma
rays.
"By using a (sodium iodide)
gamma ray detector and a
scanning technique, one can
actually obtain a pictury of the
thyroid gland. Any abnormality
of thy gland can then be seen. The
same type of technique, using
other radioisotopes which are
taken up selectively by certain
organs, can be used to discover
other abnormalities or
malfunctions."
At the University Hospital
alone, one doctor revealed he has
employed this technique on
10,000 patients.
Prof. Hofstadter received the
Nobel Prize in physics in 1961,
but not for his work on sodium
iodide. Instead it was for
extremely accurate measurements
of atomic nuclei using the
billion-volt linear electron
accelerator of the High Energy
Physics Laboratory, which he now
directs.
