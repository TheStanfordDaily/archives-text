# Help For All
## People's Med Center 
### 
In the impersonal routine of
modern life, everyone likes to feel
that somebody cares about him.
This is especially true of medical
care; however, personal warmth
and rapport between doctor and
patient is seldom found in a large,
busy hospital. It has never
occurred to many that such a
situation might be possible.
Yet a small group of people,
headed by personnel from the
Stanford Hospital, is working to
make this ideal a reality. Led by
Dr. Norton Kalishman, this group
is trying to establish a community
clinic, which they will call the
People's Medical Center. The
Center, tentatively located in
Whisky Gulch, will be mainly for
the youth of the Peninsula. All
patients, however, will be
welcome.
The idea first took form last
summer, when some of the staff
at Stanford Hospital grew
dissatisfied with the quality and
amount of care they were able to
give to nonpaying patients. It was
almost impossible, within the
hospital system, to treat people
who could not afford treatment.
There was no profit in it.
These people wanted to
practice what they felt medicine
should be: help for all, regardless
of how much money they might
have. They felt they could do this
in their own clinic.

A committee was formed to
meet every other week and
organize activities to raise funds
for the Center. A goal of $50,000
was set for January, 1970.
Fund-raising projects, to date,
include: a letter writing campaign
for donations, a rummage sale,
and a benefit sale at the
coffeehouse. There is a possibility
of benefit concerts later.
So far, $10,000 has been
raised.
Judy Wasserman, in charge of
public relations for the project,
says the target month may have to
be moved back to February.
The committee has the staff
lined up for when the clinic is
opened. There will be two doctors
on full-time duty: Dr. Kalishman,
a pediatrician; and Dr. Michael
Jacobs, in general medicine. Other
doctors will be involved on a
part-time basis. The staff will also
include a dietician, a laboratory
technician, a social worker,
nurses, and personnel to teach
basic medicine to the patients.
Location
Whisky Gulch, between Palo
Alto and the East Bayshore, is
centrally located so as many
people as possible can easily reach
the clinic, especially the young
people to which it is geared. Miss
Wasserman stated:
"We want the dropouts, the
purposely poor whose parents

could probably help but won't.
The government won't help,
either, because these kids aren't
popular."
"We can all help each other. If
a patient can't pay he'll bring
goods or work in the clinic."
Miss Wasserman stated that
payment would be by
subscription, if a patient could
afford it. If he could not, he
would pay as much as he could,
and make up the balance in goods
or services around the clinic.
Members of the staff, from Dr.
Kalishman to the day secretary,
will all be paid the same amount.
"We don't want any board of
directors Lhing," she said. "We'll
govern the clinic by vote of the
staff and any patients who are
interested. If it gets too big for
that, we'll elect a steering
committee to decide policy."
Reactions around Whisky
Gulch to the idea were varied.
Another asked, "What do they
want?"
"We don't just want a clinic,"
says Judy Wasserman. "We want
to build a community, and we
want it to work."
