# Students Take Schools To Court
## 
### 
Three Palo Alto High School
students brought suit against the
Palo Alto Unified School District
Monday, charging that a policy
banning school groups from
political activity was
unconstitutional.
The students behind the suit,
which was filed in U.S. District
Court, San Francisco, are David
Jacobs, 17, Palo Alto High senior;
Claudia Wax, 17, Cubberly High
senior; and Andrea Holman, 15,
Gunn High sophomore.
Larry Sleizer, Stanford Law
School student and Midpeninsula
chairman of the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU), filed the
case for the youths.
The students' petition asks for
a preliminary injunction against
the district's political ban, and
asks for a ruling that the ban is
unconstitutional. Judge Robert
Peckham is to hold a hearing on
the matter Oct. 23, in San Jose.
A policy adopted by the
district trustees in January, 1968,
is the object of the suit. It reads:
"No club or organization shall be
permitted to use school facilities

or student time for the purpose of
presenting consistently only one
point of view."
Student groups in all three high
schools in the district began
circulating petitions against the
political ban two weeks ago.
Student Body President Joe
Simitian, of Palo Alto High, calls
the ban "outmoded, outdated,
and not conducive to providing
the best possible education."
Harold Santee, district
superintendent, has agreed to
form a committee of board
members, parents, and students to
review the school policy.
Since the opening of school,
this fall, students have brought
pressure on the policy through
various political activities. A
memorial service for Che Guevara,
Cuban revolutionary, was held
without incident last week at Palo
Alto High.
Watching developments is the
conservative Citizens for Excel
lence in Education, which has ob
jected to political activity in the
schools.
