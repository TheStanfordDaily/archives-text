## Scott Calls For Unilateral Cease-Fire 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Senate
Republican Leader Hugh Scott
proposed Wednesday that the
United States unilaterally
proclaim a cease-fire in Vietnam,
but Secretary of Defense Melvin
R. Laird rejected the idea.
"I do not believe that would be
a successful approach," Laird told
a group of reporters.
"As Secretary of Defense I
would caution against a unilateral
action on the part of the United
States without some firm
indication from the other side
that we would have assurance that
they would go along with it."
Scott said he hopes President
Nixon will set a date on which
American forces will stop
shooting unless attacked.
"This is not a trial balloon for
the President," Scott said, "it's a
personal hope."
But Scott's expression of that
hope, for a course long advocated
by Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield, was certain to heighten
speculation that Nixon plans some
such dramatic move in his Nov. 3
Vietnam report to the nation.
Scott said he was speculating
himself.
"I wouldn't think anything
could happen of that kind before
Nov. 3," he said.

The Pentagon official, who
stipulated that he not be named,
cautioned against speculation on
what Nixon will say in his speech
10 days hence.
Both Scott and Mansfield said
the administration's new
battlefield policy of protective
reaction represents a major step
toward a cease-fire.
Under that policy, Mansfield
said, U.S. troops fire only to
forestall enemy attack.
"This is certainly a far cry
from the tactics of maximum

pressure, and search and destroy,"
Mansfield said "and to me is an
indication that the President is
moving toward a cease-fire and
stand-fast policy."
