## 
### 
The ballots have not been
counted yet, but the new Student
Senate already has important
business waiting to be done.
The selection of a new
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
will be on the agenda when the
Senate holds its first meeting
Monday night. There are 15 cases
pending which must be acted
upon by the SJC, and an SJC
must be chosen first.
Students are encouraged to
apply for positions on the SJC,
according to ASSU Council of
Presidents member Pat Shea.
Applications may be obtained
from the ASSU office. The
deadline for completed
applications is Tuesday, October
28.
Actually, the Senate does not
select the SJC members directly.
The Senate will choose three
students for a selection committee
which, in turn, acts on
applications to the SJC.
Other members of the
committee sire one student and

one faculty member of last year's
SJC, and a faculty member chosen
by the Academic Senate. The
committee will select four
students to serve on the SJC from
the applications received by the
ASSU office.
The function of the SJC is
primarily to deal with violations
of the Honor Code and offenses
against the university. According
to Professor Jack Friedenthal,
chairman of last year's SJC, these
may range from trivial malicious
mischief to more serious events
such as sit-ins.
