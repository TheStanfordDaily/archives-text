# A 						Conspiracy? Two Real Pat Sheas?
## 
### SUSIE DAY 
It's really a modified replay
of Shakespeare's "Comedy of
Errors, "—set a few hundred
years later under Stanford's
not-quite-Elizabethan palm
trees.
The central figures in the
confusion aren't hampered by
similar appaerances, however.
It's just that they have the same
name.
Pat Shea.
Mail, phone calls, and various
doctor's bills have been
exchanged with amusing
regularity by Patrick A. Shea,
and Patrick C. Shea during the

space of a little more than a year
that both have been on campus.
To complicate matters, at least
for most of the student body,
both are active in the broadly
defined arena of 'campus
affairs.'
Pat C. Shea, the less
publicized of the pair, is a
philosophy major living in Sigma
Chi, a residence which he terms
"the best of two worlds."
Arriving at Stanford last year

after two years at San Francisco
State, he has served as president
of the Student-Alumni
Association.
Pat A. Shea, native of Salt
Lake City, Utah, living off
campus this year, has been
immersed in student activities
since his arrival at Stanford,
ranging from the
Volunteers-in-Asia program to
his present position as a member

of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, elected to head the
student executive last Spring.
"A," as he has been
nicknamed by his sound-alike
"C", has had substantial political
experience in Washington as well
as on campus. Sure enough, so
has "C". "A" worked with the
campaign of the Attorney
General for Utah two years ago,
and as a member of the
Stanford-in-Washington program

worked this summer in the
office of Senator Moss (D-Utah).
Also a member of the
American Commission of
Education, "A" was nominated
this summer for membership on
a new Commission on Higher
Education recommended to
Nixon by the McClellan
Commission.
While "A" worked in
Washington for Moss, "C" was

also in the Capital City in the
office of Senator Reagel of
Michigan working closely with
"A" to formulate a list of
student leaders for the new
commission.
How does "C" evaluate "A's"
politics? "I agree not only with
his principles but with the way
he does about things," "C"
remarked.
As a candidate in the Student
Senate Elections, "C" has now
joined "A" in the arena of
student politics.
Not content with confusing
postmen and doctors, they're
out to confuse the whole
campus.

It's just that they have the same
name.
Pat Shea.
Mail, phone calls, and various
doctor's bills have been
exchanged with amusing
regularity by Patrick A. Shea,
and Patrick C. Shea during the

space of a little more than a year
that both have been on campus.
To complicate matters, at least
for most of the student body,
both are active in the broadly
defined arena of 'campus
affairs.'
Pat C. Shea, the less
publicized of the pair, is a
philosophy major living in Sigma
Chi, a residence which he terms
"the best of two worlds."
Arriving at Stanford last year

after two years at San Francisco
State, he has served as president
of the Student-Alumni
Association.
Pat A. Shea, native of Salt
Lake City, Utah, living off
campus this year, has been
immersed in student activities
since his arrival at Stanford,
ranging from the
Volunteers-in-Asia program to
his present position as a member

of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, elected to head the
student executive last Spring.
"A," as he has been
nicknamed by his sound-alike
"C", has had substantial political
experience in Washington as well
as on campus. Sure enough, so
has "C". "A" worked with the
campaign of the Attorney
General for Utah two years ago,
and as a member of the
Stanford-in-Washington program

worked this summer in the
office of Senator Moss (D-Utah).
Also a member of the
American Commission of
Education, "A" was nominated
this summer for membership on
a new Commission on Higher
Education recommended to
Nixon by the McClellan
Commission.
While "A" worked in
Washington for Moss, "C" was

also in the Capital City in the
office of Senator Reagel of
Michigan working closely with
"A" to formulate a list of
student leaders for the new
commission.
How does "C" evaluate "A's"
politics? "I agree not only with
his principles but with the way
he does about things," "C"
remarked.
As a candidate in the Student
Senate Elections, "C" has now
joined "A" in the arena of
student politics.
Not content with confusing
postmen and doctors, they're
out to confuse the whole
campus.


It's really a modified replay
of Shakespeare's "Comedy of
Errors, "—set a few hundred
years later under Stanford's
not-quite-Elizabethan palm
trees.
The central figures in the
confusion aren't hampered by
similar appaerances, however.
