# Our Man Knowles
## Playing It By Ear 
### BILL BANKS 
Our man Knowles, instructor
of the newly established Bible
class in Sunnyton High was
dispensing with the messy
business of explaining the creation
of that famous radical from
Bethlehem when he was
somewhat rudely interrupted by a
cute wide-eyed freshman co-ed.
"Excuse me," the young lady
said waving her hand impatiently,
"but I don't understand. Did this
Joseph have a history of
hallucinations? My psychologist
says that's important so if he did I
think we should discuss it."
Knowles touched his finger to
his glasses and cleared his throat
to stifle the amused chuckle that
was bouncing up his throat. He
smiled patiently.
"Miss Young, that was no
hallucination. That was divine
revalation. An Angel came to
Joseph and told him that God
was bringing His son to earth to
save mankind from sin. The angel
brought great tidings saying
Joseph's wife had been chosen to
bear this Blessed Gift."
The young lady grinned and,
rubbing his ear with her pencil
said, "An angel? Really? That's a
trip. Must have been one of those
pre-Intercept grapes."
Immediately laughter
threatened on all sides. Knowles
raised his hands and bellowed
"that's enough! I will not have
you making light of this."
Suddenly a patient martyred
expression came over Knowles's
face.
"Miss Young, this was
revelation. Utterly Divine

relevation. It had nothing to do
with fruit." He patted down what
was left of his soft grey hair and
continued. "Now then; the angel
told Joseph that God had planted
the seed of Holiness in his wife
and that she, according to
scripture, would be the virgin
mother."
Against The Scriptures
"Mr. Knowles?" another
freshman raised his hand on the
boys' side of the room. "Are you
saying she was . . .uh . . .made
pregnant out of wedlock? Wasn't
that against the scriptures?"
"This was an immaculate
conception, Mr. Dolt. God is holy,
not filthy," Knowles said waxing
a bit pink about the collar.
"But I thought ..." the boy
began and then hesitated, "I mean
in the books I read they say . . ."
"Smut!" Knowles shouted
raising his hand in rightousness.
"That filthy smut has nothing,
absolutely nothing to do with the
Holy Ghost."
"But doesn't something special
happen on the wedding night?" It
was the cute young lady again.
"That, my dear, is conception
within holy wedlock. It is not
filth!"
"Oh," Young Dolt said
apparently coming upon some
form of relevation himself, "Then
it's your way when your married
and the books' way when you're
not."
"Well not exactly," Knowles
said removing his glasses and
lossing his tie. "Marriage is holy,
yes, but in marriage you
don't . . .that is .. ." Knowles
hesitated searching for his word
and then suddenly was reminded
of the course he had so recently
replaced. Breaking into a light
filmy sweat he gurgled and then
said hurriedly ". . .Man and
woman do as they always have in
the past. Is that clear? Well we
musn't waste time discussing such
things. The Holy Ghost went in
unto Mary and ..."
"How?" A second young man
spoke from the back row on the
boys side.
"Spiritually!!" Knowles
shrieked. The sweat was now
running down both sides of his
face.

"But in this book I read by
somebody and Johnson (I'd show
it to you but I can't take it out of
the library until I'm eighteen.)
they say ..."
"Smut! Pornography! Dirt!
Knowles screamed in
exasperation. Quite adroitly, for a
man of his age he scrambled up
onto his desk, nearly knocking his
autographed copy of Max
Rafferty onto the floor.
"I will not discuss it!" he cried
defiantly and wrenched at his tie
with one hand while the other
circled nervously in front of his
abdomen." "Sexual intercourse,"
he shouted and then, seeing the
blank expressions on the faces of
his students, lowered his voice for
dramatic effect as he had heard
Mr. Rafferty do many times. He
continued in a low, hoarse
whisper, " . . .is filth and will not
be spoken of in this school."
Retribution Cometh
At this moment the door burst
open and the principal bounded
into the room with a burly man
wearing a trenchcoat at his heels.
"That's enough Knowles." The
principal cried raising high an
indignant finger. "I heard your
filthy voice all the way down the
hall. It's a good thing I decided to
escort Sgt. Hamhocks, here on his
rounds of the lockers. The deceit
of it all Knowles. Pretending to
teach the Word and instead filling
these little minds with dirt."
Ignoring Knowles's attempts to
explain the principal turned to the
Sgt. "Better take him with us,
Hamhocks." The sergeant grunted
and walked over to Knowles who
was still standing on his desk. He
ordered him down and led him
from the room gently trying to
talk him into releasing the framed
photograph he clutched tightly to
his chest.
The class was, of course,
dismissed and among the chatter
of gleeful students the careful
listener might have overheard
young Dolt proposing a new game
to Miss Young. Miss Young
expressed doubt when Dolt
explained how he would play
God, but finally, as they paused
for a drink in the hallway, it was
agreed that they would have to
play it by ear behind the
scoreboard after the game.
