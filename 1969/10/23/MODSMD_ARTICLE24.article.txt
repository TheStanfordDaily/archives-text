# Proud Indians Tested

### FRED MANN 
What a difference a year makes.
Last season at this time, the UCLA Bruins were well on their way
to a terrible finish and total humiliation in the Pacific-8. The team
finished 3-7 on the year, and miserably low in every offensive and
defensive department.
But after picking up a junior college transfer quarterback who
played behind Ron Fujikawa in high school, UCLA is a new team. In
fact, they're an awesome new team.
Dennis Dummit has led a rejuvinated Westwood offense to six
straight victories in as many tries, and has had the unit averaging 37.8
points per game, eighth best in the nation.
And the Bruin defense is number six in the country in allowing
only 7.5 points per game.
Associated Press says Stanford will beat this monster team
Saturday afternoon in Stanford Stadium. A casual observer might say
AP is obviously crazy, that nobody will beat Tommy Prothro's team
all year, and that the number six team in the land (AP poll) couldn't
possibly lose to a twice defeated team that hasn't beaten them in six
years.
This casual observer might need to reassess the situation however,
and look at the Stanford Indians. Currently ranked 19th and 14th in
the two absurd wire service polls, the Tribe has suffered more grief all
ready than most teams do in a number of seasons. Their streak of
horrendous luck is bound to end.
John Ralston's football team has pride. And they are winners. A
last minute loss to 15th ranked Purdue and a last second loss to
number 7 USC has not destroyed the morale. Lesser teams would
never recover from back to back blows like that, but this year's
Indians seem to be a rather special group.
For the first time in recent years, Stanford was picked in pre-season
polls as a top contender, and the Rose Bowl was a definite possibility.
Plunkett, Parish, and Sande were thought of as All-American material.
They had a cohesiveness and team spirit that a winner should. They
went out and murdered their first two opponents easily.
Then came Purdue. But even after that setback, the team bounced
back and knew that they were ready for USC and the biggest victory
of the year.
After the Los Angeles disaster, players were down and the
fall-apart was imminent. Somehow, it never happened. The offense
responded to all the troubles with five touchdowns last weekend and
the defense did their share with two TD's of their own and a shutout.
Saturday is another big game in what seems to be a never-ending
series of important contests. The bowl is still distantly in sight for the
Indians, and so is the nebulous Top Ten. But the main item at stake
Saturday will be pride.
UCLA has waltzed through a powder-puff schedule so far and has
turned it into national prominence (number 6 according to AP), and
furthermore, they are sitting atop the Pac-8 standings all alone (3-0).
Stanford has met the real teams and has done admirably. Although
they did have San Jose State on their schedule, they unfortunately

missed the likes of Pittsburgh, Wisconsin, and Northwestern—the three
teams that may well have put UCLA into the Rose Bowl.
The Tribe has their share of impressive statistics, and they are even
more impressive considering the enemies they were facing. Jim
Plunkett has moved Stanford to 39.8 points per game, third highest in
the country, and the Indians rank second in total offense piling up
511 yards per game.
But the record is only 3-2, and that doesn't win any prizes.
So the team that has already proved that they are as good as
Purdue, and probably better (though not luckier) than USC, is now
out to show pollsters that they can play ball with UCLA.
It is not that the Bruins are a bad team. In fact, they are most
likely the best in the entire Pacific-8. Dummit ranks just behind
Plunkett in total offense and passing, and the Jones-Cureton running
attack is, without doubt, the best in all of college football.
Mike Ballou has been called the second best linebacker on the coast
(second to Don Parish), and Gwen Cooper and George Farmer rank
first and sixth in the league in receiving.
Ron Carver has pulled in four interceptions for the Bruins, and
leads the conference in punt returns. Three of the top five scorers in
the league are Bruins.
And Prothro teams don't lose very often. They also have pride and
talent and a winning spirit. The only difference between Stanford and
UCLA seems to be in the won-lost columns, and the Indians will be
out to even that score very soon. After all, they deserve a win.

Durst of the Cougars go up to block the pass, but Howie Williams and Dan
Lightfoot are there to keep defenders away. The Indians must move their flashy
offense on a stubborn UCLA defense on Saturday. Tickets are still available.
