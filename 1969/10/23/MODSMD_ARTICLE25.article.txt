# Freitas Finished
## 
### 
Stanford's Frosh football team,
coming off a tough loss to the
USC freshmen last Saturday,
25-14, got some more bad news
this week. Jesse Freitas, one of
the talented quarterbacks on
Coach Bill Moultrie's squad has
been lost for probably the entire
year with mononucleosis.
The former All-Northern
California prep from San Mateo
was recovering from a shoulder
injury when the disease was
discovered. The frosh meet the
UCLA Brubabes Saturday at
10:00 a.m. in the Stadium in just
one part of the big
Stanford-UCLA weekend.
The Bruin Frosh won their
opener last week scoring three
touncdowns in the last quarter to
beat Cal, 21-20.
Other Saturday events against
UCLA include the varsity game at
1:30 p.m., and the water polo,
cross country, and soccer contests
all beginning at 10:00 a.m.
