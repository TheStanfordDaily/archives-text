LONDON (AP)—"I am alive
and well and unconcerned about
the rumors of my death," says
Beatle Paul McCartney. "But if I
were dead, I would be the last to
know."
At least, that's what the
Beatles' business organization
Apple said he said. The millionaire
pop musician was on a motoring
tour somewhere in England with
his wife, two children and a dog
and refused to let it be known
where he could be found.
Apple said Wednesday that
McCartney telephoned the denial
of his demise to london Tuesday
night.
"Paul refuses to say anything
more than that," said Derek
Taylor, Apple's chief spokesman.
"Even if he appeared in public
just to deny rumors it wouldn't
do any good. If people want to
believe he's dead, then they'll
believe it—the truth is not at all
persuasive."
Apple and U.S. news media
have been flooded with telephone
calls, cables and letters about
rumors in the United Sates thnt
McCartney has been dead for
years.
"They are all ridiculous,"
Apple said.
