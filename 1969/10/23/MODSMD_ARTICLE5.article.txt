# War Protesters Won't Pay Taxes
## 
### 
Members of the university
faculty and staff are refusing to
pay part of their federal income
tax as a protest against the
Vietnam war.
Special Services Director Alan
Strain is one of those withholding
his money. "We could not
voluntarily write a check for
which 80% goes directly to the
military," he said.

So, instead of paying the taxes
which finance what Strain calls "a
criminal action against mankind,"
he and the protesters contribute
to governmental and private
agencies that are "solving rather
than creating the problem."
"We do not oppose paying
taxes," Strain says, "but if we are
going to bring about institutional
changes, we must emphasize the
importance of changing personal
priorities."
"I would like to see this raised
as an issue because it is something
more than marching and attending
meetings. We must reinforce what
we believe has to be our national
priorities."
Among others in the group are
Roy Kepler, pacifist owner of
Kepler's Bookstore in Menlo Park
and John Eisler, attorney for Joan
Baez. Neither could be reached
for comment last night.
Protesters pay no Telephone
Excise Tax or the Income Tax
Surcharge. They also boycott the
portions of "mixed taxes" which
they think will go for military
expenditures.
Since nonpayment of taxes is
criminal, Strain and the others
face legal charges. Nevertheless
none have been filed.
The Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) has taken the only
governmental action against the
group. The IRS has deducted
delinquent funds from salaries and
bank accounts.
Last year Strain had $883
taken from his salary. That figure
is approximately equal to the
percentage of income tax used for
the military which Strain did not
pay
