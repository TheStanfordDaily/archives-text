# Stereos Stolen
## Thieves Hit Frats 
### 
House stereos were stolen from
both Theta Delta Chi and Lambda
Nu fraternities early Wednesday
morning despite measures to
prevent such thefts. Chains and
bolts securing the stereos did not
deter the thieves.
Lambda Nu estimated the
value of the stereo, speakers,
turntable, and amplifier at $505.
The equipment had been chained
to the wall but was ripped loose
sometime between midnight and
8:30 a.m. Wednesday.
The Theta Delt stereo,
amplifier, speakers and tuner were
stolen sometime after 3:30 a.m.
from the house living room. The
speakers had been securely bolted
to ledges near the ceiling, but they
were torn away from the bolts.
The amplifier and tuner were not
secured. The Stanford Police had
not yet received a report of the
theft yesterday, so the estimated
loss is unknown.
Food was stolen from the
Lambda Nu kitchen sometime
between dinner Tuesday night and

breakfast Wednesday morning.
The missing hamburger meat and
pork was valued at $37.20.
Neither of the fraternities
know how they will go about
recovering the stolen items. It is
uncertain if records of the stereo
serial numbers were kept.
The Stanford Police encourages
owners of valuables such as
stereos, tape decks, and
typewriters to make a record of
the serial numbers of the items
and keep the number in a separate
place. The Police also have an
engraving set students may use to
mark valuables making them
identifiable should they be stolen.
Desk Officer Donalds at the
police station stressed that owners
of tope decks, especially, were
welcome to use the engraving set.
Many tape decks have been stolen
from cars on campus recently. He
indicated that it did not seem to
make any difference whether the
cars were locked or not. He
recommended marking tape decks
as an additional safeguard.
