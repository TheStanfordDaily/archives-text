# Plans Passed
## Coyote Hill Go-Ahead 
### GREG WHITE 
Palo Alto's Planning
Commission last night approved a
zoning motion that allows the
Syntex Corporation, in
conjunction with Stanford
Medical Center, to proceed with
the development of Coyote Hill.
Final approval now lies with the
City Council itself.
Specifically, the commission
okayed splitting a 38-acre parcel
of land, which includes the hill
crest, into two parts, each with a
different zoning regulation.
Twenty-six of these acres are
designated "Agricultural-Conser
vation District" and are to be set
aside in a natural state. However,

12 acres have been designated as
"Limited Manufacturing-Large
Site (LM-5)."
These 12 acres will be the site
of an animal research facility and
surrounding buffer strips. If the
commission's action is approved
by the City Council, it is possible
that the University could develop
the whole site, within the limits of
zone regulations for L-M-5
districts. John Horndack, Medical
Center architect, denied that the
University has any current plans
for expansion of the research
facility.
Small Meeting
Horndack presented the
University's case before the

Commission at the sparsely
attended meeting. He presented a
letter from Medical School Dean
Robert Glaser asking that the
Commission adopt the proposed
zoning change.
The architect then went on to
say that "buildings have been
designed with extreme care to
preserve the beauty of the great
bulk of the hill." All but one
building will be one-story wood
frame structures, "hidden back in
a hollow," and disguised by
landscaping.
Horndack revealed that the
University, which originally
wanted a 200-foot buffer strip
around the facility, was willing to
settle for a 120-foot strip. The
space is required because
researchers will be doing field
studies on animal behavior and
don't want the animals disturbed.
Horndack did not explain why
the facility had been expanded to
twelve acres from an original
proposal of five acres that was
submitted months ago.
Conservation Proposal
Nanette Hanko of the Palo
Alto Civic League and Jill Sand of
the Stanford Conservation group
spoke against the proposed
rezoning, urging that the entire 38
acres be designated as "Planned
Community." This would have
required that any future
development of the site be
approved in advance by the City
Council. Hanko pointed out that
in 1967 Stanford promised to
protect the entire hill and to
locate the research facility
elsewhere.
The Commission did not
accept their suggestion, and voted
4-1, after brief debate, to approve
the original rezoning proposal.
Councilwoman Frances Brenner
cast the opposing vote after an
amendment of hers to reduce the
12-acre "L-M-5" site to the
acreage actually occupied by
buildings died for lack of a
second.

IN DUBIOUS BATTLE-Students have learned to view meals with something less than enthusiasm. To improve this
situation, a university committee called for better communications and decentrali7.ation along with suggestions that
students be allowed to choose from four different meal plans.
