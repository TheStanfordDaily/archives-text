# SRI Demonstrator Busted On Campus
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
Palo Alto police made their
first arrest on campus yesterday
in connection with last spring's
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
demonstrations.
Officers took Michael Beeson
into custody at the Math Corner
about four o'clock in the
afternoon, on a warrant charging
him with disturbing the peace,
inciting to riot, trespass, blocking
traffic, and unlawful assembly.
Four others turned themselves
in after receiving phone calls from
Palo Alto detectives advising them
to do so.
A sixth student, John
Gostovich, was arrested Tuesday
by Palo Alto police.
More Students Called
According to reliable sources,
about ten more students have
been called and may turn
themselves in tomorrow.
Eighty-seven defendants were
named on warrants issued in June
and July, but as of yet only 72
have been arrested.
It is expected that all the
remaining defendants will be
arrested within the week.
Sources close to the April 3rd
Movement (A3M) legal defense
committee indicated that the
committee had planned to seek a
federal injunction this week.
Lawyers had planned to enjoin
the state from serving outstanding
warrants or prosecuting people
who have been arrested on
previous warrants since the
beginning of school.
"Although several people were
in Palo Alto all summer, there was
no effort made to arrest them,"
said committee member Jack
Hartog. "When school began, they
took one person who headed
5.W.0.P.5.1., one author of the
SRI report, and one person
identified with SDS."
Police Harrassment
"By arresting them, and
arresting Tim Haight at an
anti-war rally and all the time
holding warrants over people's
heads, the police have been
harrassing them," Hartog
explained. He indicated that this
prevented them from participating
in demonstrations and other
activities, thus preventing their
exercise of the rights guaranteed
by the first amendment.
Hartog continued, "By
arresting people a few at a time,
they deny the defendants their
rights of due process. We feel that
in this case, this was done to

prepare the cases a few at a time.
The defendants never knew when
they woke up in the morning
whether there would be a knock
on the door that day, and they
couldn't turn themselves in
because that would force the state
to prosecute."
Arrested today, in addition to
Beeson, were Lucy Wieland, Brad
Cornell, Paul Witt, and Laura
Castle. They, like John Gostovich,
were charged with disturbing the
peace, inciting to riot, trespass,
blocking traffic, and unlawful
assembly.
Of the seventy-two defendants
arrested, eleven have pleaded no
contest to the charges.
Three—Jean Friedman, Scott
Johnson, and Myron Filene—have
been convicted and are appealing.
One student, Steve Kessler, is
currently in court.
Yet another student, Mark
Sapir, saw his trial end in a hung
jury and reprosecution. He asked
for a continuance of a few months
to take medical exams, but in a
surprise move, the court denied
his continuance.

arrested within the week.
Sources close to the April 3rd
Movement (A3M) legal defense
committee indicated that the
committee had planned to seek a
federal injunction this week.
Lawyers had planned to enjoin
the state from serving outstanding
warrants or prosecuting people
who have been arrested on
previous warrants since the
beginning of school.
"Although several people were
in Palo Alto all summer, there was
no effort made to arrest them,"
said committee member Jack
Hartog. "When school began, they
took one person who headed
5.W.0.P.5.1., one author of the
SRI report, and one person
identified with SDS."
Police Harrassment
"By arresting them, and
arresting Tim Haight at an
anti-war rally and all the time
holding warrants over people's
heads, the police have been
harrassing them," Hartog
explained. He indicated that this
prevented them from participating
in demonstrations and other
activities, thus preventing their
exercise of the rights guaranteed
by the first amendment.
Hartog continued, "By
arresting people a few at a time,
they deny the defendants their
rights of due process. We feel that
in this case, this was done to

prepare the cases a few at a time.
The defendants never knew when
they woke up in the morning
whether there would be a knock
on the door that day, and they
couldn't turn themselves in
because that would force the state
to prosecute."
Arrested today, in addition to
Beeson, were Lucy Wieland, Brad
Cornell, Paul Witt, and Laura
Castle. They, like John Gostovich,
were charged with disturbing the
peace, inciting to riot, trespass,
blocking traffic, and unlawful
assembly.
Of the seventy-two defendants
arrested, eleven have pleaded no
contest to the charges.
Three—Jean Friedman, Scott
Johnson, and Myron Filene—have
been convicted and are appealing.
One student, Steve Kessler, is
currently in court.
Yet another student, Mark
Sapir, saw his trial end in a hung
jury and reprosecution. He asked
for a continuance of a few months
to take medical exams, but in a
surprise move, the court denied
his continuance.
Palo Alto police made their
first arrest on campus yesterday
in connection with last spring's
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
demonstrations.
Officers took Michael Beeson
into custody at the Math Corner
about four o'clock in the
afternoon, on a warrant charging
him with disturbing the peace,
inciting to riot, trespass, blocking
traffic, and unlawful assembly.
Four others turned themselves
in after receiving phone calls from
Palo Alto detectives advising them
to do so.
A sixth student, John
Gostovich, was arrested Tuesday
by Palo Alto police.
More Students Called
According to reliable sources,
about ten more students have
been called and may turn
themselves in tomorrow.
Eighty-seven defendants were
named on warrants issued in June
and July, but as of yet only 72
have been arrested.
It is expected that all the
remaining defendants will be
arrested within the week.
