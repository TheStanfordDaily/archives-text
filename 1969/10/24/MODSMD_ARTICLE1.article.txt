# Be-In Organizers Defend Concerts To Paly Council
## 
### 
A Palo Alto City Council
committee heard from local be-in
organizers about the "conflict of
morality" last night in a calm,
friendly meeting.
While members of the Free
People's Free Music Company
(FPFMC) passed out fresh-baked
bread and flowers to the audience,
of more than 120 people,
committee chairman Frank
Gallagher explained "it is our
resolve to study the be-in with a
view of recommending to the
Council on the advisability of
continuing them, and if they are,
what the conditions will be."
The committee is investigating
the Saturday night free dances in
Lytton Plaza as well as complaints
stemming from two be-ins last
summer.
In explaining the FPFMC's
position. Free University leader

Bob Cullenbine declared, "We
weren't looking for a
confrontation. We wanted a
concert. When we got two
complaints, we'd split like the
police asked."
Cullenbine blamed the alleged
Lytton Plaza trouble on local new
coverage. "If you want to
investigate, take the clippings
from the Times. I think you'll
find the Palo Alto Times has done
a magnificent job of polarizing the
community with its deceptions
and outright lies."
In addition he complained of
police harrassment and cited over
315 jay walking tickets that have
been handed out by officers at the
Plaza dances during the past year.
"Would they do this at a Lions
Club meeting?" Cullenbine asked.
"How can the city in good
faith enforce these laws? It takes

us about 35 to 40 dollars a night
to rent the sound equipment.
Hell, the city took more out of
the Plaza with their fines than we
have," declared Cullenbine.
Gallagher had no rebuttal and
thanked Cullenbine for speaking.
The next speaker led the
audience in a hand clapping song
while more bread was distributed.
The next few speakers tried to
persuade the committee to change
sound level regulations so that the
bands could play at their
accustomed volume.
Saul Wasserman from the
Peninsula Observer addressed the
committee to point out that "It's
iastitutions like the Free
University and the be-ins that
provide one of the most useful
activities for youth." Without
them, he said, "there will be drug
abuse, alienation, and profound
despair."

been handed out by officers at the
Plaza dances during the past year.
"Would they do this at a Lions
Club meeting?" Cullenbine asked.
"How can the city in good
faith enforce these laws? It takes

us about 35 to 40 dollars a night
to rent the sound equipment.
Hell, the city took more out of
the Plaza with their fines than we
have," declared Cullenbine.
Gallagher had no rebuttal and
thanked Cullenbine for speaking.
The next speaker led the
audience in a hand clapping song
while more bread was distributed.
The next few speakers tried to
persuade the committee to change
sound level regulations so that the
bands could play at their
accustomed volume.
Saul Wasserman from the
Peninsula Observer addressed the
committee to point out that "It's
iastitutions like the Free
University and the be-ins that
provide one of the most useful
activities for youth." Without
them, he said, "there will be drug
abuse, alienation, and profound
despair."
A Palo Alto City Council
committee heard from local be-in
organizers about the "conflict of
morality" last night in a calm,
friendly meeting.
While members of the Free
People's Free Music Company
(FPFMC) passed out fresh-baked
bread and flowers to the audience,
of more than 120 people,
committee chairman Frank
Gallagher explained "it is our
resolve to study the be-in with a
view of recommending to the
Council on the advisability of
continuing them, and if they are,
what the conditions will be."
The committee is investigating
the Saturday night free dances in
Lytton Plaza as well as complaints
stemming from two be-ins last
summer.
In explaining the FPFMC's
position. Free University leader

Bob Cullenbine declared, "We
weren't looking for a
confrontation. We wanted a
concert. When we got two
complaints, we'd split like the
police asked."
Cullenbine blamed the alleged
Lytton Plaza trouble on local new
coverage. "If you want to
investigate, take the clippings
from the Times. I think you'll
find the Palo Alto Times has done
a magnificent job of polarizing the
community with its deceptions
and outright lies."
In addition he complained of
police harrassment and cited over
315 jay walking tickets that have
been handed out by officers at the
Plaza dances during the past year.
