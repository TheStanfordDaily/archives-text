## VP's New Post 
### Art Buchwald 
President Richard Nixon
caused a great deal of speculation
when he announced so far in
advance that he was going to
make a major pronouncement
concerning Vietnam. Be selecting
Nov. 3 as the date, he has given
the press and other news media an
opportunity to guess what he is
going to say and do. The rumors
are getting wilder each day.
I can reliably report that,
despite all the trial balloons that
the White House is sending up,
one of the things he plans to
announce is that he is making
Vice President Spiro Agnew his
liaison between the White House
and the intellectual community.
A spokesman said, "No one in
the Administration has a better
understanding or a deeper interest
in the intellectuals than the Vice
President. Time and time again
Mr. Agnew has gone to bat for the
educated classes in the country,
particularly the students.
"The President feels that by
announcing Mr. Agnew's
appointment as his personal
representative, he will be able to
take some of the steam out of the
moratorium protests. The feeling
is that the Vice President is the
only one who can communicate
with the students and protesters."
I asked the spokesman how the
President had discovered this.
Always Known
"The President has always
known that his Vice President has
been a popular figure on the
nation's campuses. Not only has
Mr. Agnew had rapport with
students, but he is also respected
and admired by professors and
college presidents. They see in Mr.
Agnew a man of warmth,
generosity and intelligence and
someone who can state their case
to the President."
"Did the President come to
this decision on his own?"
"No, he did not," the
spokesman said. "He discussed it
with representative college
students."
"Which ones?"

"David Eisenhower and his
wife, Julie. I don't think there is
any doubt that they speak for the
entire college generation."
"Will Vice President Agnew be
to the Nixon Administration what
Eric Goldman was to the Johnson
Administration?"
"Yes, except that, as Vice
President, Mr. Agnew will have
more influence on intellectual
matters in the country. It is hoped
that when students or educators,
writers, historians, philosophers
and artists have something to say,
they will put it in the willing ear
of Mr. Agnew. We want them to
feel the Vice President is one of
them."
"Has the Vice President been
informed of his appointment?"
Vcry Excitcd
"Yes, and he's very excited
about it. He loves working with
youth and with educated people.
He feels that they're the hope of
the future and that what they
have to say is important to the
direction in which this country is
going. He is particularly impressed
with their eagerness to speak out
on he issues of the day, and he
feels that the more the intellectual
community is heard from, the less
mistakes the Administration will
make. He doesn't believe if you've
seen one campus, you've seen
them all."
"The President was most
fortunate to have someone of Mr.
Agnew's intellectual standing
available," I said.
Better Choice
"President Nixon feels that
way. At first he was going to
appoint Gen. Lewis B. Hershey to
the job, but David and Julie
persuaded the President that Mr.
Agnew would be a better choice."
"I don't see how Vice
President Agnew can take on this
job with everything else he has to
do," I said.

"The President hopes to ease
up on Mr. Agnew's other duties so
he can devote all his attention to
he intellectuals and students. For
a start, he told the Vice President
he no longer has to meet him at
the airport."

"Will Vice President Agnew be
to the Nixon Administration what
Eric Goldman was to the Johnson
Administration?"
"Yes, except that, as Vice
President, Mr. Agnew will have
more influence on intellectual
matters in the country. It is hoped
that when students or educators,
writers, historians, philosophers
and artists have something to say,
they will put it in the willing ear
of Mr. Agnew. We want them to
feel the Vice President is one of
them."
"Has the Vice President been
informed of his appointment?"
Vcry Excitcd
"Yes, and he's very excited
about it. He loves working with
youth and with educated people.
He feels that they're the hope of
the future and that what they
have to say is important to the
direction in which this country is
going. He is particularly impressed
with their eagerness to speak out
on he issues of the day, and he
feels that the more the intellectual
community is heard from, the less
mistakes the Administration will
make. He doesn't believe if you've
seen one campus, you've seen
them all."
"The President was most
fortunate to have someone of Mr.
Agnew's intellectual standing
available," I said.
Better Choice
"President Nixon feels that
way. At first he was going to
appoint Gen. Lewis B. Hershey to
the job, but David and Julie
persuaded the President that Mr.
Agnew would be a better choice."
"I don't see how Vice
President Agnew can take on this
job with everything else he has to
do," I said.

"The President hopes to ease
up on Mr. Agnew's other duties so
he can devote all his attention to
he intellectuals and students. For
a start, he told the Vice President
he no longer has to meet him at
the airport."
President Richard Nixon
caused a great deal of speculation
when he announced so far in
advance that he was going to
make a major pronouncement
concerning Vietnam. Be selecting
Nov. 3 as the date, he has given
the press and other news media an
opportunity to guess what he is
going to say and do. The rumors
are getting wilder each day.
I can reliably report that,
despite all the trial balloons that
the White House is sending up,
one of the things he plans to
announce is that he is making
Vice President Spiro Agnew his
liaison between the White House
and the intellectual community.
A spokesman said, "No one in
the Administration has a better
understanding or a deeper interest
in the intellectuals than the Vice
President. Time and time again
Mr. Agnew has gone to bat for the
educated classes in the country,
particularly the students.
"The President feels that by
announcing Mr. Agnew's
appointment as his personal
representative, he will be able to
take some of the steam out of the
moratorium protests. The feeling
is that the Vice President is the
only one who can communicate
with the students and protesters."
I asked the spokesman how the
President had discovered this.
Always Known
"The President has always
known that his Vice President has
been a popular figure on the
nation's campuses. Not only has
Mr. Agnew had rapport with
students, but he is also respected
and admired by professors and
college presidents. They see in Mr.
Agnew a man of warmth,
generosity and intelligence and
someone who can state their case
to the President."
"Did the President come to
this decision on his own?"
"No, he did not," the
spokesman said. "He discussed it
with representative college
students."
"Which ones?"

"David Eisenhower and his
wife, Julie. I don't think there is
any doubt that they speak for the
entire college generation."
"Will Vice President Agnew be
to the Nixon Administration what
Eric Goldman was to the Johnson
Administration?"
"Yes, except that, as Vice
