## Write Columns 
### David Grey 
This column is written in
support of writing columns. Or,
more specifically, to support the
editorial call (Oct. 3) by editor
Mark Weinberger for more
community input into the Daily's
opinion pages:
"We. are now contracting
faculty and staff groups to
encourage them to submit letters,
columns, and articles for
publication, looking toward the
day when the Daily can become a
true community newspaper.
Faculty and staff, and often
students, have felt a great deal of
hesitancy about expressing ideas
through the Daily's pages, either
from fear that their copy would
be mistreated or from
disagreement with Daily editorial
bias. That bias will undoubtedly
live on, but our opinion pages arc
open to expression of literally any
point of view."
and to support the Daily's Oct. 6
editorial page boxed notice:
"Contribute! . . although space
limitations sometimes necessitates
editing of copy, the Daily will
attempt to preserve the form and
content of all material submitted
for publication. "
As a promoter of the idea of
greater faculty participation in
University affairs (first as
individuals and only secondarily
as members of "special interest"
groups), I'd like to urge serious
consideration of involvement in
the Daily's opinion pages.

Faculty, in particular, too
often limit their on-campus
sharing of feelings to a few
colleagues and only on occasional
moments to students during or
after classes. One result, of course,
has been lack of adequate
dialogue on such matters as the
meaning of academic freedom and
the roles of the university and
university research in society.
Reasons for hesitancy in
committing oneself in writing are
often valid. But it would seem
that over time, topics of special
relevance arise which almost
"require" comment.
Take Initiative
Certainly faculty from all
ranges of viewpoint should feel no
presumptuousness in taking the
initiative to comment to the
community; rather, there should
be a spirit of obligation at times
to step forward and get involved
in this symbolic way.
All tht-se thoughts obviously
apply to more than just the
faculty members at Stanford. But
there would seem to be no group
with a greater responsibility to
join in at these still very troubled
times. It is one thing to spring
into action when crises arise. It is
quite another to help stay ahead
or even stay with community
problems, especially those
problems where faculty members
have very special old and new
interests and obligations.
