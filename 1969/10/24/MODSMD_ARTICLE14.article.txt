# Killing Crops
## CBW In Vietnam 
### Sharon Endow 
Despite declarations that the
U.S. would never resort to CBW
except in response to first use by
another country, the United
States has been actively pursuing a
program of chemical warfare in
Vietnam for the past eight years.
A major part of its chemical
warfare program consists of the
aerial application of herbicides
and defoliants, which are sprayed
on forests and jungles to expose
enemy hiding places and which
are also effective in killing crops
in enemy-held territory.
The use of herbicides and
foliants in South Vietnam dates
back to 1961 when 60 spray
sorties were flown as a part of the
spraying program "Operation
Ranch Hand". Since then the
program has increases enormously
in scale. But 1966 the combined
defoliation and crop-spraying
operations had amounted to an
estimated total of over 1,300,000
gallons of herbicides sprayed over
more than 5 million acres.
Estimates through September,
1967 indicated that a total of
more than 2 million acres had
been sprayed, with contracts for
$57.7 million worth of chemicals
for defoliation and crop
destruction being awarded in that
year. In May, 1969, the U.S.
announced that the budget for
defoliation operations would be
increased 24.9% in the fiscal year
1969.
The extent of damage effected
by picloram and other herbicides
is difficult to estimate, not only
because of the limited number of
studies carried out thus far and
the possible long-term nature of
the ecological impacts in the areas
concerned, but also and primarily
because of the lack of
understanding of the topical
ecosystem by western man.
The basic structure of the
tropical rainforest ecosystem,
which represents the most
complex interaction of vegetation
and organisms on the earth, is
provided by the forest itself. The
various zones of the forest,
ranging from the forest canopy to
the forest floor, provide a
diversity of niches for the great
variety or organisms dependent on
the forest for their way of life.
The destruction of the forest
canopy and other types of
vegetation is the immediate and
obvious effect of the herbicides.
Perhaps less obvious is the
disruption of the many organisms
which depend on the forest for
their very existence.
Because the mechanism of
defoliant action on the tropical
ecosystem is imperfectly
understood, the U.S. is, in short,
setting into motion on a large
scale a biological process whose
action and consequences cannot
be foreseen or controlled.
But the implications of our
defoliating activities are not
confined to the ecological systems
of South Vietnam. We are
presently engaged in establishing a
precedent of herbicides as warfare
agents. This means that any
country at will may bring
herbicides and defoliants into its
arsenal as weapons against any
other country.
The toxic effects of widespread
aerial spraying of herbicides can
affect the land, the water, the
gaseous composition of the air—in
short, our entire environment, and
thus, all living things. And upon
the acceptance of any chemical as
a warfare agent there arises the

difficulty in discriminating
between one chemical and
another, one use of chemicals and
another.
The U.S. has been able to use
these types of chemicals in
Vietnam thus far without
escalation to other classes of

chemical weapons on either side.
How much longer we will
maintain the present level of use
of chemical weapons in Vietnam
without escalation is a matter of
conjecture.

Despite declarations that the
U.S. would never resort to CBW
except in response to first use by
another country, the United
States has been actively pursuing a
program of chemical warfare in
Vietnam for the past eight years.
A major part of its chemical
warfare program consists of the
aerial application of herbicides
and defoliants, which are sprayed
on forests and jungles to expose
enemy hiding places and which
are also effective in killing crops
in enemy-held territory.
The use of herbicides and
foliants in South Vietnam dates
back to 1961 when 60 spray
sorties were flown as a part of the
spraying program "Operation
Ranch Hand". Since then the
program has increases enormously
in scale. But 1966 the combined
defoliation and crop-spraying
operations had amounted to an
estimated total of over 1,300,000
gallons of herbicides sprayed over
more than 5 million acres.
Estimates through September,
1967 indicated that a total of
more than 2 million acres had
been sprayed, with contracts for
$57.7 million worth of chemicals
for defoliation and crop
destruction being awarded in that
year. In May, 1969, the U.S.
announced that the budget for
defoliation operations would be
increased 24.9% in the fiscal year
1969.
The extent of damage effected
by picloram and other herbicides
is difficult to estimate, not only
because of the limited number of
studies carried out thus far and
the possible long-term nature of
the ecological impacts in the areas
concerned, but also and primarily
because of the lack of
understanding of the topical
ecosystem by western man.
The basic structure of the
tropical rainforest ecosystem,
which represents the most
complex interaction of vegetation
and organisms on the earth, is
provided by the forest itself. The
various zones of the forest,
ranging from the forest canopy to
the forest floor, provide a
diversity of niches for the great
variety or organisms dependent on
the forest for their way of life.
The destruction of the forest
canopy and other types of
vegetation is the immediate and
obvious effect of the herbicides.
Perhaps less obvious is the
disruption of the many organisms
which depend on the forest for
their very existence.
Because the mechanism of
defoliant action on the tropical
ecosystem is imperfectly
understood, the U.S. is, in short,
setting into motion on a large
scale a biological process whose
action and consequences cannot
be foreseen or controlled.
But the implications of our
defoliating activities are not
confined to the ecological systems
of South Vietnam. We are
presently engaged in establishing a
precedent of herbicides as warfare
agents. This means that any
country at will may bring
herbicides and defoliants into its
arsenal as weapons against any
other country.
The toxic effects of widespread
aerial spraying of herbicides can
affect the land, the water, the
gaseous composition of the air—in
short, our entire environment, and
thus, all living things. And upon
the acceptance of any chemical as
a warfare agent there arises the

difficulty in discriminating
between one chemical and
another, one use of chemicals and
another.
The U.S. has been able to use
these types of chemicals in
Vietnam thus far without
escalation to other classes of

chemical weapons on either side.
How much longer we will
maintain the present level of use
of chemical weapons in Vietnam
without escalation is a matter of
conjecture.
