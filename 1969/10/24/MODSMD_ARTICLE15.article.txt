# Hukari Tactics
## Rational Dialogue? 
### Jim Spickard 
Last Spring there was much
talk at Stanford about the
University as a center for
dispassionate learning and inquiry.
During the hectic months of April
and May, as many students rallied
to fight defense research and
counter-insurgency beneath our
sunlit palm trees, other segments
of our community grouped
themselves for a counterblow, and
proclaimed a struggle for the
liberation of minds—under the
banner of Rational Dialogue.
Claiming to be the true
representatives of American
higher education, they rose to
support the equal competition of
ideas in an atmosphere free from
intimidation. They sought to
prevent "neo-fascist tactics" from
disrupting the course of "getting
an education".
Just as it is important for us to
compare the ideology of the Left
with its practice, so we must
know how these "newer"
elements translate their
high-sounding phrases into action.
This is especially true as one of
these groups has raised 11,000
with which to spread its message
this year.
We have to know what we're
paying for.
Activities in Washington
During the past summer this
columnist was employed in the
Stanford-in-Washington program
as a summer intern in the office of
a liberal Democratic Congressman.
I was writing speeches, answering
constituents' letters, and
performing other tasks of vital
national importance.
At the same time, another
Stanford student—one of the
prime spokesmen for Rational
Dialogue, is one is to believe his
words—was working for Human
Events in the same city, a
newsletter described by those in
newspaper work as "somewhere
to the left of the John Birch
Society, but not much."
Harvey H. Hukari, Jr.—past
president of the Stanford YAF
and an editor of the Stanford
Arena—and I were both at the
hearings of the McClellan
Committee towards the end of
June when that body was
investigating the events of Last
Spring at our fine institution.
Having met Harvey many times
before—usually across a debating
table, but occasionally in more
informal instances—l sauntered
over and passed the time of day
with him for a short while. We
exchanged ammenities, asked as
to the others employment, and so
on, and after a while returned to
our seats as the hearings began.
While I had differed with
Harvey politically in the past, I
had never regarded him as an

enemy. I was quite surprised,
then, when the next day my boss
received a call from a Mr. Ryskind
of Human Events—whom I assume
to be one of Harvey's
employers—inquiring rather
beligerently as to why in the hell a
Congressman had an
"SDS-radical" working in his
office.
After a short exchange in
which my boss told Ryskind that
I was doing fine work, my salary
was a matter of record, and that
the political convictions of his
employees were a matter between
them and their consciences, the
conservation ended. Later in the
afternoon I talked with Ryskind's
secretary and was called by
Ryskind himself, inquiring as to
my "SDS-affiliations" and as to
the fact that I was arrested after
the Hanover Street
demonstrations last May.
I got the "are you now or have
you ever been ..." bit, and that

was the last I heard, except that
Ryskind's secretary said that "a
Stanford student had reported
___ . >»
me.
Rational Dialogue
While in none of these
conversations were overt threats
made to either my employer or
myself, and while my political
feelings had been no secret, there
was an undercurrent of innuendo
in it all that was felt by the whole
office staff. The question kept
coming up: "Will they try to use
this in the next election?? Will
they try to recreate the McCarthy
era in the Second District??"
If these are the true tactics of
Rational Dialogue I ask you to
beware. The true test of an
ideology is the action it supports,
and I would not want anyone to
be seduced by the vacuous words
self-proclaimed "apostles" may
speak.
