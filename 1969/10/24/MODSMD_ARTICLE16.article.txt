## Adult Education In The Home 
### Greg White 
The following is taken from
a pamphlet put out by Save Our
Parents (SOP), a conservative
organization which opposes adult
education. The excerpt is from a
panel discussion involving noted
children, among them Billy, Mary,
Jane, and Rex. It is reprinted here
so that the general public may
better make up its mind on the
crucial subject of adult education
in our schools.
Billy: Well, golly, I just don't
think that adult education should
be played around with by the
school system. As a child of some
years, I am quite concerned with
the effects that it might have on
my parents.
Jane: I agree. Why just the
other day my parents were
snickering about Vietnam, and
I'm sure that they didn't
understand half of what they were
saying. Also, a couple of weeks
ago I caught my father in the
bathroom trying on a peace
button. Now, where did he learn
that but in school?
Billy: Too often parents just
aren't ready for adult education.
It can't be rushed.
Latent Period
Rex: It's what Freud called the
latent period. After a parent
reaches a certain age he is no
longer interested in education.
Especially about things dealing
with social problems, democratic
politics, or pollution. This is a
time when a parent is caught up in
living the joys of middle age.
Education only serves to confuse
him.
Mary: Right. It seems to take
years to go through this phase.
Eventually, however, adults show
natural urges and this is the right
time for education. When that

time comes for my parents, I plan
to start them out on personal
things before I explain everything,
you know, things like death and
loneliness. But you have to be
careful not to tell them too much
at once, or they are liable to
experiment.
Simple Solution
Jane: I'm not going to tell my
folks anything unless they ask. So
far they haven't asked anything
that a simple solution couldn't
answer.
Billy: You two have brought
out an important point—adult
education has got to be kept in
the home, where it belongs. God
planned it that way ever since
Bible times. The home is the only
place where adults can
comfortably learn, in the secure
and moral atmosphere created by
the presence of their children who
have been through it all. We
children once had the same
problems and so can understand
what our parents are going
through.
Mary: When it is taken out of
the home, too many nasty things
can happen. For instance, it is a
rare teacher who can make an
adult understand what education
is all about. Can we trust just
anyone to answer our parent's
questions like "Why are there
only two systems, Communist and
Capitalist?" and "Does
Communist China really finance
the world youth revolution?"
Carried Away
Jane: And some teachers really
get carried away. Why, I heard of
one in Peoria who took off all his
clothes to show his class war
wounds and stitches he got at
Chicago last summer. My parent
came home asking all sorts of
embarrassing questions about
what he saw.
Rex: A teacher told my mom
all about different methods of
dissent, and showed her pictures
graphically illustrating what was
happening. Now, I believe
education between two
consenting children is 0.K., but
something like this is forcing
parents to see something they
don't like.

Billy: That's really going too
far. It just points out to me that
the whole adult education plot is
a left wing-communist plot to
undermine the qualities that have
made this nation great—ignorance
and apathy.
Rex: Especially since they
teach it from an atheistic point of
view. Education is god-given. By
taking morals out of education, he
Reds will crumble our basic value
system.
Mary: My mommy brought me
up to be Catholic, so I have
religious reason for opposing adult

education in public schools. I have
been given no assurance that some
form of artificial mind control
won't be publicized. Mind control
is acceptable only if it is done by
natural means.
Jane: Well, I'm not so sure
about what the Pope says though:
If everybody practiced natural
mind control, who'd there by left
to think?
Billy: I think we can all agree
that adult education should be
kept in the hands of the children.
If we can't educate our parents,
then who can? j*
