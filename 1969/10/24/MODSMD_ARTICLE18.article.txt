# Committee To Seek Corporation Action
## 
### 
A group of Stanford Business
School students is organizing an
information-action project
designed to step up and
consolidate efforts of Bay Area
big business in attacking social
problems.
The Committee for Corporate
Responsibility plans to go directly
to the top management of about
100 of the largest Bay Area
companies to gather information
about the extent of corporate
involvement in social action.
The students announced that
they would set up a data bank for
information about corporate
projects and that they planned to
volunteer their organizational
managerial skills to corporations
and to other organizations
through volunteer task forces.
Seminar Brainchild
The idea of converting social
concerns into a social action
project emerged from the Business
School's annual ethics seminar, a
pre-school retreat at which forty
selected students discussed
business ethics with a group of
top executives. Since then, the
number of volunteers has
increased to 150, roughly
twenty-five percent of the
Business School students.
Harold Gaffin, a second-year
MBA student and spokesman for
the committee, characterized the
student plan as a constructive
effort by an essentially
middle-of-the-road student group.
"The students' consciences are
moving and what we are doing is
to stimulate them in more positive
directions," said Gaffin.
The students will request
personal interviews with the top
executives of the biggest Bay Area
businesses in letters to go out in
early November. Teams of three
students each will make the
personal visits to the companies.
Assess Attitudos
"We are interested in talking to
top management about company
plans and attitudes, and how the
corporations view their role in the
area of social involvement," said
Gaffin. "We want to know what
problems they have had and
where they've failed as well as
they've succeeded," he said. "We
also want to know where
companies think the Business

School students could be of
help," he added.
The students plan to round up
the result of these interviews
and be ready to name whatever
student task forces will be
necessary before the end of the
year. The students will also send
questionnaires to top
managements of the 250 largest
companies in the U.S., but do not
now plan personal visits to
companies outside the Bay Area.
Positive Approach Stressed
Gaffin said the students are
anxious that the companies see
their efforts as a positive
approach, not as a threat or an
attack. "We want to find out how
serious the corporations are about
social involvement, in terms of
what resources they are willing to
commit to solving or reducing
social problems. And we want to
develop action-oriented projects
that business and the Business
School can enter into jointly."
Gaffin said the group had no
proprietary interests in the
project. "We are not looking for a
Business School Sierra Club,"he
said. "We would like to see others
pick up the idea."
Students of the Committee will
also call on schools and
governmental agencies to find out
what others are doing and to
identify additional resources.
