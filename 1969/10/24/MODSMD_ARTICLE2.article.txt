# Council of Presidents Member
## Pat Shea On The Move 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
A dart arched through the air
and thudded into the snapshot on
the bulletin board.
"The thing I've been telling
myself lately is that you just can't
take yourself so seriously,"
declared Pat Shea as he aimed the
next throw at the small picture of
himself on his office wall.
Strange words from an ASSU
Council of Presidents member
whose crowded schedule takes
him out of the state constantly.
Last weekend he went to Denver,
and this weekend he will be in
Washington, D.C. "I don't have
any time for friends anymore.
You get so busy going "from
meeting to meeting. There's never
any time to sit down and talk, to
explore each other and do new
things." He smiled his Mac Leans
smile and brushed back his Salt
Lake City natural. The phone rang
and he took the call.
Out of the four Council
members, Shea has clearly
emerged as the public figure, the
spokesman, the one asked to
comment or make a statement. He
speaks articulately in a witty,
easy-going manner with quick
flashes of the smile; above all Shea
never loses control of the
situation.
But beyond this firm facade of
pleasant sophistication, Shea has a
clear vision of how this university
works, along with its personalities
and its present condition.
"Stanford is going through a
period of fluctuation. When this
stops, when things begin to settle
down, 1 want it all to be in the
best interests of the students. I'm

trying to represent the student
point of view."
Too Big A Job
The Council ran for election
last spring partly on the theory
that the ASSU presidency was too
big a job for one man. "You
shouldVe seen Denis Hayes (last
year's ASSU president). He was a
wreck at the end of the year."
Along with Shea the Council
includes Barry Askinas, Joyce
Kobayashi, and John Grube. They
each have separate responsibilities
and areas of interest. Shea
concentrates on relations between
the new student senate and the
faculty's Academic Council as
well as with the trustees. If he
receives more publicity, "It's
natural because I deal with more
people. I have greater visibility."
Shea works hard on the job,
usually going to bed after two and
waking up for early morning
appointments and committee
meetings. But he seems to thrive
on these rounds. "I'm busy all day
here. It's a job that maintains a
kind of creative tension." The
phone rang a second time, and he
answered it.
What is it about the job that
attracts him? Isn't there a lot of
paper-pushing to wade through
before anything happens? "I
enjoy being on the spot when
important decisions are being
made and changing things for the
better. But those opportunities
are few."
His biggest problems are the
bureaucrats and their maneuvers
that take up so much of his time.
"They just don't realize that
things have to change. There are

even student bureaucrats here in
Tresidder."
Dealing With Stereotypes
Shea says, "There's a real
temptation to deal in stereotypes
when you talk to administrators,
faculty, or students. You think
that each group has shared points
of view. But you can't get
anything done that way."
Radicals can't stand him and
his set of liberal assumptions. For
others, he's too slick and
scheming, forever chasing the
limelight and pleading for
cooperation and working within
the system. Yet for Shea there's
no doubt that students are gaining
more and more control over their
education. "It takes a long time to
achieve much around here, but I
think it's possible.
Before the election Shea was
deeply involved in student affairs
as a member of the Coalition, a
group that felt the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
recommendations didn't go far
enough. He was later a member of
the Education Council, the
student assembly that met to
consider the SES report.
As well as missing out on most
student life, he has little time for
studying. "I went to my class on
17th and 18th century intellectual
thought. IVe been to five classes
so far. What a mind Hobbes had.
But when class is over, and I want
to write something or read the
books, I have to follow my little
list of dates and meetings instead.
"I'm not really a student
anymore."

"There have been significant
steps. Committees that have never
had students on them now have at
least one." Shea is committed to
the hope that students can get
through to the university.
Students can change it, he feels,
through a gradual shift of power
in the committee structure.
Coupled with this involvement
in the slow-moving world of
committees and memos are some
hard realizations about university
structure and operations. "What
should exist in place of the
present university government is
community government where
everyone involved has a part in
the decision. Bur this is an ideal."
ImpoB»Shlt Now
Shea thinks it's impossible to
have this type of government right
now. The present scene has many
"strong interest groups —faculty,
students, administrators, and
many smaller groups within each
of these." Shea views himself as a
representative of the students, one
pledged to see that the students
emerge from changing situations
in a fair position.

least one." Shea is committed to
the hope that students can get
through to the university.
Students can change it, he feels,
through a gradual shift of power
in the committee structure.
Coupled with this involvement
in the slow-moving world of
committees and memos are some
hard realizations about university
structure and operations. "What
should exist in place of the
present university government is
community government where
everyone involved has a part in
the decision. Bur this is an ideal."
ImpoB»Shlt Now
Shea thinks it's impossible to
have this type of government right
now. The present scene has many
"strong interest groups —faculty,
students, administrators, and
many smaller groups within each
of these." Shea views himself as a
representative of the students, one
pledged to see that the students
emerge from changing situations
in a fair position.
A dart arched through the air
and thudded into the snapshot on
the bulletin board.
"The thing I've been telling
myself lately is that you just can't
take yourself so seriously,"
declared Pat Shea as he aimed the
next throw at the small picture of
himself on his office wall.
Strange words from an ASSU
Council of Presidents member
whose crowded schedule takes
him out of the state constantly.
Last weekend he went to Denver,
and this weekend he will be in
Washington, D.C. "I don't have
any time for friends anymore.
You get so busy going "from
meeting to meeting. There's never
any time to sit down and talk, to
explore each other and do new
things." He smiled his Mac Leans
smile and brushed back his Salt
Lake City natural. The phone rang
and he took the call.
Out of the four Council
members, Shea has clearly
emerged as the public figure, the
spokesman, the one asked to
comment or make a statement. He
speaks articulately in a witty,
easy-going manner with quick
flashes of the smile; above all Shea
never loses control of the
situation.
But beyond this firm facade of
pleasant sophistication, Shea has a
clear vision of how this university
works, along with its personalities
and its present condition.
"Stanford is going through a
period of fluctuation. When this
stops, when things begin to settle
down, 1 want it all to be in the
best interests of the students. I'm

trying to represent the student
point of view."
Too Big A Job
The Council ran for election
last spring partly on the theory
that the ASSU presidency was too
big a job for one man. "You
shouldVe seen Denis Hayes (last
year's ASSU president). He was a
wreck at the end of the year."
Along with Shea the Council
includes Barry Askinas, Joyce
Kobayashi, and John Grube. They
each have separate responsibilities
and areas of interest. Shea
concentrates on relations between
the new student senate and the
faculty's Academic Council as
well as with the trustees. If he
receives more publicity, "It's
natural because I deal with more
people. I have greater visibility."
Shea works hard on the job,
usually going to bed after two and
waking up for early morning
appointments and committee
meetings. But he seems to thrive
on these rounds. "I'm busy all day
here. It's a job that maintains a
kind of creative tension." The
phone rang a second time, and he
answered it.
What is it about the job that
attracts him? Isn't there a lot of
paper-pushing to wade through
before anything happens? "I
enjoy being on the spot when
important decisions are being
made and changing things for the
better. But those opportunities
are few."
His biggest problems are the
bureaucrats and their maneuvers
that take up so much of his time.
"They just don't realize that
things have to change. There are

even student bureaucrats here in
Tresidder."
Dealing With Stereotypes
Shea says, "There's a real
temptation to deal in stereotypes
when you talk to administrators,
faculty, or students. You think
that each group has shared points
of view. But you can't get
anything done that way."
Radicals can't stand him and
his set of liberal assumptions. For
others, he's too slick and
scheming, forever chasing the
limelight and pleading for
cooperation and working within
the system. Yet for Shea there's
no doubt that students are gaining
more and more control over their
education. "It takes a long time to
achieve much around here, but I
think it's possible.
Before the election Shea was
deeply involved in student affairs
as a member of the Coalition, a
group that felt the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
recommendations didn't go far
enough. He was later a member of
the Education Council, the
student assembly that met to
consider the SES report.
As well as missing out on most
student life, he has little time for
studying. "I went to my class on
17th and 18th century intellectual
thought. IVe been to five classes
so far. What a mind Hobbes had.
But when class is over, and I want
to write something or read the
books, I have to follow my little
list of dates and meetings instead.

anymore."

Before the election Shea was
deeply involved in student affairs
as a member of the Coalition, a
group that felt the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
recommendations didn't go far
enough. He was later a member of
the Education Council, the
student assembly that met to
consider the SES report.
As well as missing out on most
student life, he has little time for
studying. "I went to my class on
17th and 18th century intellectual
thought. IVe been to five classes
so far. What a mind Hobbes had.
But when class is over, and I want
to write something or read the
books, I have to follow my little
list of dates and meetings instead.
"I'm not really a student
anymore."

"There have been significant
steps. Committees that have never
had students on them now have at
least one." Shea is committed to
the hope that students can get
through to the university.
Students can change it, he feels,
through a gradual shift of power
in the committee structure.
Coupled with this involvement
in the slow-moving world of
committees and memos are some
hard realizations about university
structure and operations. "What
should exist in place of the
present university government is
community government where
everyone involved has a part in
the decision. Bur this is an ideal."
ImpoB»Shlt Now
Shea thinks it's impossible to
have this type of government right
now. The present scene has many
"strong interest groups —faculty,
students, administrators, and
many smaller groups within each
of these." Shea views himself as a
representative of the students, one
pledged to see that the students
emerge from changing situations
in a fair position.
A dart arched through the air
and thudded into the snapshot on
the bulletin board.
"The thing I've been telling
myself lately is that you just can't
take yourself so seriously,"
declared Pat Shea as he aimed the
next throw at the small picture of
himself on his office wall.
Strange words from an ASSU
Council of Presidents member
whose crowded schedule takes
him out of the state constantly.
Last weekend he went to Denver,
and this weekend he will be in
Washington, D.C. "I don't have
any time for friends anymore.
You get so busy going "from
meeting to meeting. There's never
any time to sit down and talk, to
explore each other and do new
things." He smiled his Mac Leans
smile and brushed back his Salt
Lake City natural. The phone rang
and he took the call.
Out of the four Council
members, Shea has clearly
emerged as the public figure, the
spokesman, the one asked to
comment or make a statement. He
speaks articulately in a witty,
easy-going manner with quick
flashes of the smile; above all Shea
never loses control of the
situation.
But beyond this firm facade of
pleasant sophistication, Shea has a
clear vision of how this university
works, along with its personalities
and its present condition.
"Stanford is going through a
period of fluctuation. When this
stops, when things begin to settle
down, 1 want it all to be in the
best interests of the students. I'm

trying to represent the student
point of view."
Too Big A Job
The Council ran for election
last spring partly on the theory
that the ASSU presidency was too
big a job for one man. "You
shouldVe seen Denis Hayes (last
year's ASSU president). He was a
wreck at the end of the year."
Along with Shea the Council
includes Barry Askinas, Joyce
Kobayashi, and John Grube. They
each have separate responsibilities
and areas of interest. Shea
concentrates on relations between
the new student senate and the
faculty's Academic Council as
well as with the trustees. If he
receives more publicity, "It's
natural because I deal with more
people. I have greater visibility."
Shea works hard on the job,
usually going to bed after two and
waking up for early morning
appointments and committee
meetings. But he seems to thrive
on these rounds. "I'm busy all day
here. It's a job that maintains a
kind of creative tension." The
phone rang a second time, and he
answered it.
What is it about the job that
attracts him? Isn't there a lot of
paper-pushing to wade through
before anything happens? "I
enjoy being on the spot when
important decisions are being
made and changing things for the
better. But those opportunities
are few."
His biggest problems are the
bureaucrats and their maneuvers
that take up so much of his time.
"They just don't realize that
things have to change. There are

even student bureaucrats here in
Tresidder."
Dealing With Stereotypes
Shea says, "There's a real
temptation to deal in stereotypes
when you talk to administrators,
faculty, or students. You think
that each group has shared points
of view. But you can't get
anything done that way."
Radicals can't stand him and
his set of liberal assumptions. For
others, he's too slick and
scheming, forever chasing the
limelight and pleading for
cooperation and working within
the system. Yet for Shea there's
no doubt that students are gaining
more and more control over their
education. "It takes a long time to
achieve much around here, but I
think it's possible.
