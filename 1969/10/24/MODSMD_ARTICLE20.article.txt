# 'Second Thoughts'
## Rockefeller Report Faulted 
### 
Professor Clark Reynolds, a
member of N.Y. Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller's mission to Latin
America, spoke at Tresidder
Wednesday on "Second Thoughts
on the Rockefeller Mission to
Latin America."
Prof. Reynolds was upset with
the handling of the mission's
report. He contended that the
report was not a coordinated
effort, but was written by merely
a few of the advisors.
Also, the report is being kept
confidential, and will be evaluated
by the National Security Council
rather than the State Department
as was expected. Reynolds called
the handling of the report "very
serious and potentially dangerous
to the democratic process."
According to Prof. Reynolds,
President Nixon was to have made
a statement on October 20 in
response to reports from the
mission. Economic ministers of
the countries involved seem to be
awaiting this statement,
postponed to October 31, before
taking further action.
Leadership Questioned
Because of this, he said, many
members of the trip have
refrained from much comment.
Prof. Reynolds, disappointed by
the delay, finally decided to give
his views. He discussed questions
such as the best means of
conducting the mission.
Reynolds pointed out the
inadequacy of time in each
country, the number of

unnecessary advisors, and the
question of Rockefeller leading
such a group in the first place. He
was apparently picked because of
his knowledge and past work in
the area.
Rockefeller, he stated, is fluent
in the languages, as well as being
generally "optimistic about
everything." Though his image
and holdings in Latin America
would open him to criticism, they
should not effect the total
efficiency.
Effect of U.S.
The primary finding of the
mission, in Reynolds' view, was
the realization of the tremendous
effect of U.S. internal decisions
on Latin America. He pointed out
that, while we may strive to aid
and develop these countries, we
are actually tearing them down by
our internal decisions.

Connected with this idea, he
continued, was the fact that Latin
Americans have no "clear channel
to the top" in airing their
grievances; Decisions are made
concerning the citizens which
they have no control over.

Because of this, he said, many
members of the trip have
refrained from much comment.
Prof. Reynolds, disappointed by
the delay, finally decided to give
his views. He discussed questions
such as the best means of
conducting the mission.
Reynolds pointed out the
inadequacy of time in each
country, the number of

unnecessary advisors, and the
question of Rockefeller leading
such a group in the first place. He
was apparently picked because of
his knowledge and past work in
the area.
Rockefeller, he stated, is fluent
in the languages, as well as being
generally "optimistic about
everything." Though his image
and holdings in Latin America
would open him to criticism, they
should not effect the total
efficiency.
Effect of U.S.
The primary finding of the
mission, in Reynolds' view, was
the realization of the tremendous
effect of U.S. internal decisions
on Latin America. He pointed out
that, while we may strive to aid
and develop these countries, we
are actually tearing them down by
our internal decisions.

Connected with this idea, he
continued, was the fact that Latin
Americans have no "clear channel
to the top" in airing their
grievances; Decisions are made
concerning the citizens which
they have no control over.
