# From 20 Countries
## African Students Organize 
### BOB MIChELET 
Attempting to expand its
activities, members of the
Organization of African Students
met Thursday to consider plans
for the year.
Under the leadership of
president Robert Youdi, the
group elected officers and
discussed this year's activities.
Youdi and secretary Joseph
Mavega were elected at a meeting
last Monday.
Although only 12 attended the
Thursday meeting, the
organization's membership
numbers about 40.
Last year, the group sponsored
its African Table, which is slated
to continue, an African Culture
Week and various social activities.
"Moderate Success"
Mayega termed last year's work
"a moderate success."
The purpose of the
organization, as outlined in its
constitution, is "to encourage
closer relationship among African
Students at Stanford; to foster
public awareness and
understanding of events in Africa;
to promote a deeper
understanding of African culture;
to help incoming African students
to settle (and) to cooperate with
other organizations working
towards these objectives."
One of the most important
problems, Youdi says, is to fill the
"vacuum" in African cultural
activities left during the summer,
when most students are gone.
Lack of Attendance Criticized
Last year, the organization
held weekly luncheon meetings,
occasionally including guest
speakers. But this plan was
criticized Thursday for not
drawing enough members.
Alternatives for group action
were discussed but nothing was
formally decided. It was noted
that while more African students

are needed in the group's
activities, other students cannot
be excluded, so a better exchange
of ideas may take place.
Officers Elected
Other officers elected
Thursday were vice-president
Godwin Olbi, treasurer Kofi
Baidoo and social chairman
Akpabios Ekerete.
Following the meeting, Youdi
discussed the organization, and
said that the main difference
between his group and other
organizations, such as the BSU, is
that the OAS is "an organization
of a whole continent, not just one
country."
He said that as many as 20
countries are represented in the
membership. Youdi added that
the group "has something else to
give. We want to let people know
about our countries."
He noted the group tries to
promote knowledge about Africa
as well as destroy incorrect or
misleading knowledge that may
already exist.*
