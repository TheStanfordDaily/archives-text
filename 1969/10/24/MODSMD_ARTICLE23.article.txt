# Professors Offer New Publications
## 
### 
| The "publish or perish"
syndrome has produced works
ranging from an examination of
trash disposal to an erudite study
of Supreme Court Justice John
Marshall during recent months.
Professor Bruce F. Johnston,
an economist in the Food
Research Institute, has just
returned from a trip to Taiwan,
India, and West Pakistan. His
views are detailed in an article
co-authored with John Cownie of
the Institute, scheduled for
publication this fall in the
American Economic Review.
"In countries where the
absolute size of the farm labor
force is increasing rapidly," he
writes, "investment in tractor
mechanization is likely to be
uneconomic for society's point of
view, even though it is profitable
to the large farm operators . . .The
social costs of . . .under-employ
ment and unemployment do not
enter into their assessment of
costs and returns."
Professor Johnston suggests
that in underdeveloped countries,
land holdings should be kept
relatively small and investment in
tractors and other highly
expensive equipment minimized.
Johnston is co-editor of a new
book on "Agriculture and
Economic Growth: Japan's
Experience," just published by
the Tokyo University Press.
Trash to Concrete
A new proposal for getting rid
of city trash collections come
from Stanford Prof. Cedric W.
Richards.
By means of chemical and
magnetic refining processes, said
Richards, most of the metal can
be removed from incinerated
refuse. The glass powder finally
produced should make a
satisfactory substitute for natural
sand, the principal raw material in
aerated concrete. Mixed with
cement and aerated chemically or
mechanically, it can be formed
into reinforced precast floor and
wall panels, or into short beams.
"Advantages of aerated
concrete include ease in handling
because of its light weight," said
the engineer, "and the ease of
working it. It can be sawed,
nailed, screwed, planed, chiseled,
and glued. It is ideally suited to
prefabricated construction."
Marshall Supported
Prof. Gerald Gunther of the
Stanford Law School has
discovered that John Marshall,
one of the greatest chief justices
of the U.S. Supreme Court, twice
adopted a pen name and waged

newspaper war with critics of his
most famous decision, McGulloch
vs. Maryland.
Marshall's action remains
without precedent in Supreme
Court history. Much of it was
undiscovered and unreported until
this year, a century and a half
later.
Faced with a "most ferocious
hurricane" of criticism from
states' rights advocates, Marshall
twice used a nom de plume and
wrote journalistic essays
defending the Court's verdict.
Centralization
The full text of Marshall's
decision, both series of articles he
wrote in its defense, and the
criticism which spurred him to
this unique action are published
together for the first time this
month in "John Marshall's
Defense of McCulloch vs.
Maryland." It has an introduction
by Gunther.
"In throwing its weight on the
centralizing side in the recurrent
struggle about allocation of
authority between nation and
states," Gunther comments, "the
Court provided a reservoir for
national action perhaps even fuller
than Marshall intended. The
degree of centralization that has
taken place since that time may
well have come about in the face
of his intent rather than in accord
with his expectations . . .
"Centralization may be in
inevitable consequence of
economic and social
changes . . .(but) if virtually
unlimited congressional discretion
is indeed required to meet 20th
century needs, candid argument
to that effect rather than ritual
invoking of Marshall's authority
would seem to me to be more
closely in accord with the Chief
Justice's stance.
A nationally prominent
authority on constitutional law,
Prof. Gunther is now working on
a major analysis of the Marshall
Court. It will be published as part
of a multi-volume history of the
Supreme Court.
On Civil Law
Prof. John Henry Merryman of
the Stanford Law School is the
author of a new book on "Civil
Law Tradition."
Designed for a general
audience, the book includes a
concise history and analysis of the
civil law tradition which is
dominant in most of Western
Europe, all of Latin America, and
many parts of Asia, Africa and the
Middle East.

Marshall Supported
Prof. Gerald Gunther of the
Stanford Law School has
discovered that John Marshall,
one of the greatest chief justices
of the U.S. Supreme Court, twice
adopted a pen name and waged

newspaper war with critics of his
most famous decision, McGulloch
vs. Maryland.
Marshall's action remains
without precedent in Supreme
Court history. Much of it was
undiscovered and unreported until
this year, a century and a half
later.
Faced with a "most ferocious
hurricane" of criticism from
states' rights advocates, Marshall
twice used a nom de plume and
wrote journalistic essays
defending the Court's verdict.
Centralization
The full text of Marshall's
decision, both series of articles he
wrote in its defense, and the
criticism which spurred him to
this unique action are published
together for the first time this
month in "John Marshall's
Defense of McCulloch vs.
Maryland." It has an introduction
by Gunther.
"In throwing its weight on the
centralizing side in the recurrent
struggle about allocation of
authority between nation and
states," Gunther comments, "the
Court provided a reservoir for
national action perhaps even fuller
than Marshall intended. The
degree of centralization that has
taken place since that time may
well have come about in the face
of his intent rather than in accord
with his expectations . . .
"Centralization may be in
inevitable consequence of
economic and social
changes . . .(but) if virtually
unlimited congressional discretion
is indeed required to meet 20th
century needs, candid argument
to that effect rather than ritual
invoking of Marshall's authority
would seem to me to be more
closely in accord with the Chief
Justice's stance.

authority on constitutional law,
Prof. Gunther is now working on
a major analysis of the Marshall
Court. It will be published as part
of a multi-volume history of the
Supreme Court.
On Civil Law
Prof. John Henry Merryman of
the Stanford Law School is the
author of a new book on "Civil
Law Tradition."
Designed for a general
audience, the book includes a
concise history and analysis of the
civil law tradition which is
dominant in most of Western
Europe, all of Latin America, and
many parts of Asia, Africa and the
Middle East.
| The "publish or perish"
syndrome has produced works
ranging from an examination of
trash disposal to an erudite study
of Supreme Court Justice John
Marshall during recent months.
Professor Bruce F. Johnston,
an economist in the Food
Research Institute, has just
returned from a trip to Taiwan,
India, and West Pakistan. His
views are detailed in an article
co-authored with John Cownie of
the Institute, scheduled for
publication this fall in the
American Economic Review.
"In countries where the
absolute size of the farm labor
force is increasing rapidly," he
writes, "investment in tractor
mechanization is likely to be
uneconomic for society's point of
view, even though it is profitable
to the large farm operators . . .The
social costs of . . .under-employ
ment and unemployment do not
enter into their assessment of
costs and returns."
Professor Johnston suggests
that in underdeveloped countries,
land holdings should be kept
relatively small and investment in
tractors and other highly
expensive equipment minimized.

Trash to Concrete
A new proposal for getting rid
of city trash collections come
from Stanford Prof. Cedric W.
Richards.
By means of chemical and
magnetic refining processes, said
Richards, most of the metal can
be removed from incinerated
refuse. The glass powder finally
produced should make a
satisfactory substitute for natural
sand, the principal raw material in
aerated concrete. Mixed with
cement and aerated chemically or
mechanically, it can be formed
into reinforced precast floor and
wall panels, or into short beams.
"Advantages of aerated
concrete include ease in handling
because of its light weight," said
the engineer, "and the ease of
working it. It can be sawed,
nailed, screwed, planed, chiseled,
and glued. It is ideally suited to
prefabricated construction."
