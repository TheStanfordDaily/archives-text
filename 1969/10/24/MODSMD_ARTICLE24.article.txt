# Sympathetic Vibrations
## This Weekend Jazz Is Happy 
### 
The happiest music going will
be filling Cubberley High School
Pavilion tonight and tomorrow
night starting at 8:30.
Yes, the Preservation Hall Jazz
Band, led by Billie and DeDe
Pierce, are back in town, bringing
with them Mighty Willie
Humphrey, probably the best
Dixieland clarinetist alive; Jim
Robinson, who at 77 years old
can still blow out the rafters with
his trombone; Big Dave Owley,
drummer and blues singer; and
bass horn man A 1 Jaffe. The PHJB
plays the original old-time New
Orleans Jazz; they have come
from Bayou Country as a benefit
for the Miramonte Mental Health
Center.
This is the real article, not the
commercial Dixieland of A 1 Hirt.

These people have lived this
music, and it is a part of them.
More Jazz: The great Dizzy
Gillespie brings his fly-away
trumpet to he Jazz Workshop at
473 Broadway in the City at 9:30
each evening. The JW is a sort-of
nightclub, minors welcome, no
booze; in fact, Sunday evening
students get in free with student
body cards.
Versatile
Roland Kirk plays every reed
instrument you ever heard of, plus
a few he invented himself, and
several at the same time; he's at
the Both/And this weekend. Call
them for show times.
In a semi-classical vein, the
Lamplighters are doing Gilbert
and Sullivan's "The Mikado" at
the Presentation Theater at 8:30
tonight and Saturday. If you have
heard of Gilbert and Sullivan's
operettas, but have never seen
one, "The Mikado" will be your
best introduction to their wit and
marvelous music. This was the
original underground theater,
biting and slashing at Victorian
England through the guise of a
parody of Oriental culture. "The
Mikado" will be presented each
weekend through November 8.
Novaes Will Perform
Brazilian Pianist Guiomar
Novaes, known in this country
primarily through her recordings,
will play works by Bach,
Beethoven, Chopin, Villa-Lobos,
and Debussy Sunday evening at
8:30 in Zellerback Auditorium at
UC Berkeley. Miss Novaes is
particularly well-known for her
interpretations of Beethoven
sonatas.

Aaron Stern will conduct the
Peninsula Symphony Orchestra
tonight and tomorrow night in
Vaughn Williams' "Sancta Civitas"
with the Schola Contorum. Other
works to be played are
Prokovieff's "Alexander Nevsky,"
and Beethoven's "Egmont
Overture." Both concerts begin at
8:30, tonight's at San Mateo High
School and tomorrow's at
Foothill.
One last note: The Far West
Section of the Society for the

Preservation and Encouragement
of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in
America is holding their annual
convention in he City this week,
and the eleminations and finals
for the annual competition will be

10 AM and 2 PM Saturday, with
finals at 8 PM that evening. All
events will be held at Nourse
Auditorium in the City. Call the
