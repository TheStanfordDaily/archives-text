# First SRT Offering
## 'Iceman' Opens Season 
### 
The Stanford Repertory
Theater opens its new season
Wednesday night with Eugene
O'Neill's "The Iceman Cometh."
Performances are scheduled for
Wednesday through Saturday at 8
p.m. for the next two weeks, plus
a matinee Nov. 1 at 1 p.m.
The play is set in a dingy
saloon where fifteen drunks live
on alcohol and their dream of
returning someday, but not today,
to a decent life. Hickey, the flash
traveling salesman tells them they
must forget their illusions if they
want to attain peace. They
cannot; the death of their illusion
would be the end o f their lives.
Leading roles will be played by
SRT acting fellows Richard

Rekow and Gene Parseghian,
acting student Wes Finlay, and
special guest artist John Cochran.
Experienced Director
Cochran founded and directed
the New San Francisco Players,
the Pittsburgh Black Art Society,
and Dialogue Black/White, Inc.
Last year at Stanford he directed
a program initiated by the Black
Students Union for the
development of Black Theater
Arts. His television credits include
"Name of the Game," "Man from
UNCLE,"and "Tarzan."
Rekow and Finlay appeared in
last season's SRT production
"Blood Wedding." Parseghian
played here in "A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the
Forum" and"The Queen and the
Rebels" last year.
"The Iceman Cometh" will be
directed by Howard Brown, a
third-year candidate for the
Master of Fine Arts degree in
directing.
Unswerving Genuineness
Brown feels O'Neill's play
reveals a sense of unswerving
genuineness and comedy in its
dialogue and characterizations.
The plays characters cannot face
their hollowness without the
opium of their illusions. But
another theme is equally
important, says Brown. O'Neill

shows there is a limit to the
amount of guilt a man can bear
and still survive.
The set designed by Prof.
Wendell Cole, will emphasize
thynon-realistic elements of the
drama with see-through and
unfinished walls to give the
appearance of rooms that are
disintegrating. Cole has designed
over 200 productions at Stanford.
O'Neill's play reflects on his
own life. "Iceman's" barroom is
the waterfront boardinghouse
where O'Neill stayed in 1912. He
spent several years in destitution
and alcoholism, and died alone in
a hotel room in 1953
Information concerning tickets
for all SRT productions can be
obtained by calling the Memorial
Hall Box Office. SRT tickets will
also be handled by all
TRS-Ticketron agencies in the
Bay Area.

dialogue and characterizations.
The plays characters cannot face
their hollowness without the
opium of their illusions. But
another theme is equally
important, says Brown. O'Neill

shows there is a limit to the
amount of guilt a man can bear
and still survive.
The set designed by Prof.
Wendell Cole, will emphasize
thynon-realistic elements of the
drama with see-through and
unfinished walls to give the
appearance of rooms that are
disintegrating. Cole has designed
over 200 productions at Stanford.
O'Neill's play reflects on his
own life. "Iceman's" barroom is
the waterfront boardinghouse
where O'Neill stayed in 1912. He
spent several years in destitution
and alcoholism, and died alone in
a hotel room in 1953

LIFE'S AN ALCOHOLIC ILLUSION, at least that's the way Cecily Morgan, (far
left) SRT guest actor John H. Cocran, (center), and acting fellow Richard Rekow
find it in Eugene O'Neill's "The Iceman Cometh," opening Wednesday for a
two-week run in the Little Theater.
The Stanford Repertory
Theater opens its new season
Wednesday night with Eugene
O'Neill's "The Iceman Cometh."
Performances are scheduled for
Wednesday through Saturday at 8
p.m. for the next two weeks, plus
a matinee Nov. 1 at 1 p.m.
The play is set in a dingy
saloon where fifteen drunks live
on alcohol and their dream of
returning someday, but not today,
to a decent life. Hickey, the flash
traveling salesman tells them they
must forget their illusions if they
want to attain peace. They
cannot; the death of their illusion
would be the end o f their lives.
Leading roles will be played by
SRT acting fellows Richard

Rekow and Gene Parseghian,
acting student Wes Finlay, and
special guest artist John Cochran.
Experienced Director
Cochran founded and directed
the New San Francisco Players,
the Pittsburgh Black Art Society,
and Dialogue Black/White, Inc.
Last year at Stanford he directed
a program initiated by the Black
Students Union for the
development of Black Theater
Arts. His television credits include
"Name of the Game," "Man from
UNCLE,"and "Tarzan."
Rekow and Finlay appeared in
last season's SRT production
"Blood Wedding." Parseghian
played here in "A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the
Forum" and"The Queen and the
Rebels" last year.
"The Iceman Cometh" will be
directed by Howard Brown, a
third-year candidate for the
Master of Fine Arts degree in
directing.
Unswerving Genuineness
Brown feels O'Neill's play
reveals a sense of unswerving
genuineness and comedy in its
dialogue and characterizations.

opium of their illusions. But
