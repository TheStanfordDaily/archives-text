# Doubled Up
## Hogging At Night 
### Marshall Schwartz 
The British bridge writer,
Victor Mollo, has created a pair of
characters now well known to
many afficionados of the game.
The first is Hideous Hog, who
distorts the bidding so that he can
play the hand—and makes up for
being in strange contracts (such as
a classic 6 Diamond contract
played in a 3-2 trump fit—making
6) by superb play. The other is
Rueful Rabbit, who never quite
knows what he's doing, but
stumbles from error to error with
fantastic luck, usually coming out
on top.
Few players would admit to
being the Rabbit, but there are an
awful lot of gleeful Hogs around.
When Hog plays with Hog, the
standard greeting is, "Weaker
minor, partner?" acknowledging
the fact that they open in their
shorter minor suit, to prevent the
lead of that suit in the anticipated
no-trump contract.
A recent rubber bridge game
played in Crothers Memorial
brought out best of a pair of
Hogs.

The Ridding:
E S W N
P 111 P 2NT
P 3NT P P
P
Vul: Neither
Opening Lead: Spade 4
South started the bidding off
normally with 1 Heart. But North

decided to play the Hog. He
refused to bid spades, figuring
that would only lead to his
partner's playing the hand in 3
NT. He therefore came up with
the cldssic Hog bid of 2 NT. South
had no choice but to raise to
game.
East, not unnnaturally, decided
to lead the unbid major, spades,
especially since it was his longest
suit—right into the jaws of North's
well-concealed five-bagger. North
could see that the hands would
make four or five
spades—depending on whether the
heart king was onside—without
any difficulty, and so his task was
to produce a better result. He
immediately finessed hearts
(hoping, if the hook lost, West
wouldn't find the club switch).
And when he found East with
king-third of hearts, proceeded to
make seven.
Later in he evening, South
came across this beautiful hand:

The Bidding:
SEWN
1C P ID P
1H P 3H P
3NT P P P
Vul: Neither
Opening Lead: Cluh 4
Naturally, he opened his
weaker minor. North, as witnessed
by the previous hand, was an
accomplished Hog, and smelled

something funny. Systematically,
he should have responded 1 heart,
his four-card major. Instead he bid
1 diamond. South somehow
found one heart—another
lead-inhibiting bid. Naturally
enough, North jump-raised his
partner, kicking himself for not
bidding hearts originally. But
when South took it back to three
no-trump, North knew what was
going on.
But their opponents didn't.
West suspected South's opening
bid, but figured that the heart
rebid was natural. Forced to
choose between his two four-card
suits, he picked clubs. This proved
to be fatal. South's jack won the
trick, and when the finesse for the
king of spades worked, he had
nine tricks—three clubs, two
spades, and four diamonds.
West glared as North smiled.
"Nice bid, partner," he said, as
the two hogged on into he night.
