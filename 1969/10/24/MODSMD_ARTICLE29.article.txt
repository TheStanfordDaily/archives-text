# Bruins To Invade Tomorrow
## 
### FRED MANN 
80,000 people are expected
tomorrow afternoon when
Stanford's Indians take on the
most difficult opponent of a
difficult year, the UCLA Bruins.
Game time is 1:30 p.m.
A loss by the Tribe would end
all hope of a Rose Bowl bid for
this season, and furthermore
would drop the pre-season
co-favorites to a .500 record. A
loss for the Bruins on the other
hand would be the first of the
year, and a minor upset to the
oddsmakers who have reversed
themselves and make UCLA a slim
one point favorite.
The game was rated even two
days ago.
In any Stanford game, fans can
rest assured that passes will fly,
and touchdowns will be scored.
The Tribe has averaged 40 points
per game. But Saturday will see
what could be the biggest scoring
explosion in some time. UCLA
averages 38 per game, and their

quarterback can really throw a
football.
I) ummit Connects
Dennis Dummit has thrown
107 times for 61 completions,
1201 total yards, and 11
touchdowns. He has also had only
three intercepted.
But UCLA's quiet Southern
gentleman, Coach Tommy
Prothro has called Jim "lunkett,
"maybe the best passer who ever
played the game," so you know
there is respect on both sides.
Each team's defense will have to
adjust for the game.
The Bruins who have the
stingiest defense in the league will
be out to make Plunkett throw
faster than he wants to. A big rush
by the UCLA quick front linemen
is designed to force the Tribe's
head Indian to make a mistake.
Jim has had seven intercepted this
year, and the UCLAns have their
own specialist in steals, safety
Ron Carver.
Pass Protection
Plunkett has not been dropped
all season due to his great front
wall of protection formed by Pete
Seymour, George Crooks, John
Sande, Bob Reinhard, and Dave
Sharp. Also, the great quarterback
has the ability to read blitzes
quickly and release the ball before
the trouble hits.
"Plunkett is one of the great
college passers," said Washington
State's Coach Jim Sweeny after
last week's 49-0 Stanford win.
"The whole Stanford offense is
great. If you take away one
pattern, they'll kill you on
another one. They are so much
better than last year it's hard to
believe."
Blitzing Bruins
The UCLA blitzers will give
even Plunkett quite a time. Mike
"Cat" Ballou anchors the
aggressive linebackers, and big
Floyd Reese leads the front four.
This is the first year in Prothro's
UCLA career that his team is
playing a pro-type defense. The

Bruins use four rushers, three
backers, and four deep men. The
formation is designed to protect
against the pass, and it has been
effective.
The Westwooders are second in
the league in total pass defense
(first overall), and have given up
only one TD through the air. But
then again they have never been
tested by a real passer and real
receivers. (Oregon State did not
complete a pass until the fourth
quarter against UCLA).
With so much attention being
paid to Plunkett, often the players
catching the passes go unnoticed.
Bob Moore ("the best tight end in
the country"), Jack Lasater, and
Jim Cross are all coming off great
efforts last week.
Of the Pac-B's top ten
receivers, four are Indians. Lasater
ranks third, followed by Moore
(4), Randy Vataha (8), and Howie
Williams (9).
Drop Back Passer
The Bruins' defense may have
their hands full, but so will John
Ralston's. In Dummit, the Cards

face another drop-back passer.
The last time the Stanford defense
met up with one of them, it was
Mike Phipps of Purdue who
connected for five touchdowns
and over 400 yards through the
air.
At that time, Coach Ralston
said he had not changed the
defense for a non-league game.
(The Stanford down-six defense
with three deep backs is designed
primarily to contain the run and
roll-out passers). This time, you
can bet there will be changes.
But the front line for the
Indians cannot change too much,
because they have a pair of pretty
fair runners to stop. Senior
tailback Greg Jones is the second
leading scorer in UCLA history,
and currently leads the league
with nine touchdowns.
Workhorse
Jones is the workhorse in the
backfield, having carried 107
times for a 5 yard-per-run average.
He is explosive, much like Bubba
Brown of the Tribe, and still
strong in short yardage situations
like Howie Williams.
Mickey Cureton has been even
better. The junior fullback and
twice CIF Player-of-the-Year in
high school has slimmed down,
and picked up added speed this
year. He is averaging 8.4
yards-per-carry, and has broken
away for a 75-yard TD romp.
His real talent lies in his speed
coming out of the backfield. A
few times, Dummit has nearly

missed handoffs because Cureton
is too far coming through.
When the runners occasionally
get bogged down, Dummit opens
up and throws to his favorite
target, split-end Gwen Cooper.
Despite his name, Gwen has
out-muscled league deep backs for
23 catches, 537 yards, and five
TD's.
Bolden Returns
A recent surprise has been the
revival of Bill Bolden. Bolden was
the starting quarterback most of
last season when the Bruins hit
rock bottom. A good runner but
poor passer, Bolden found his QB
career over when Dummit arrived.
He is now a third string tailback,
and carried three times last week
against Cal.
The first run was for two
yards, but the next two were
touchdown runs of 41 and 65
yards. UCLA is tough.
The battle should be a classic
one. "We'll need our best game of
the year," said Coach Ralston.
"Dummit is a fine team leader. He
likes to throw (often to tailback
Jones) and utilizes those great
runners.
"We are healthy and the spirit
is up. Dick Oliver is back, and
only Cross is questionable with a
sore shoulder."
WSU's Sweeny put it another
way: "Stanford has the most
versatile attack in the conference,
but UCLA is strong all over.
Whoever plays a perfect game will
win."
No one could say it any better.

HOWlE—After a hand-off from Plunkett, Howie Williams finds room up the
middle against Washington State. The Indian offense faces a strong challenge
against UCLA's powerful pass-minded defense, and a good running game will be
a strong asset.


LINE-UP—Stanford passers haven't been dumped yet
once this year, due to the excellent work of the offensive
line. Mere Pete Seymour (71), John Sande (55) and Bob

banks its hopes on getting to the quarterback faster, a
task at which even USC tailed.
