# Theta Chi Pensive

### 
Coming off a disappointing
opening fame win (7-6), the Theta
Chi 7+ Touch Football Team has
scrambled back for a decisive loss.
Team co-captain "Ref"
Ritchey firmly asserts that this is
only the beginning. With two
games left on the schedule, "We
could easily make it three for
four, with our momentum and
any kind of luck."
Pensively looking forward to
the next contest, massive lineman
Steve Voophah philosophizes:
"Touch football is definitely a
game of breaks." Blocking back
(Viet) Cong concurs, "My body is
broken in twenty places. I used to
have a neck."
Touch football being a game of
only seven players, Theta Chi was
forced to red-shirt several brilliant
prospects. They may be found
shooting pool back at the house at
gametime. Otherwise, the likely
starting lineup consists of:
Dum-Dum Dillon. Dum-Dum
was converted from wingback
after he molested an unidentified
defensive player. He now operates
out of the triple threat wishbone
spinal formation at left freeb.
Steve Voophah, at 7 feet, 98
pounds, is a pretty impressive

sight right up until the first
offensive play. He was forced to
leave the second game after
tripping and receiving cuts on
both hands while trying to catch
his glasses.
Greg Psaltisâ€”house president
and feared defensive back was
overheard mumbling as an end ran
past him. "Pbizzare, pbizzare . . ."
"Ref" Ritchey, left large
lineman, is known for his "cool."
Once during a pass play he turned
around and with no apparent
concern uttered to the
quarterback, "Watch out!"
Fearless Dorvel, the
quarterback, has done an amazing
job thus far of saving his skin and
catching his own passes that the
charging linemen bat down.
Other receivers of batted passes
are: "Indian" Folsom, "Hands"
McClure, Viet Cong, "Speed"
Arima, Painter the Cripple, Bull
Durham, Nebulous Gray, Straight
A 1 Hails and Woman Wee.
Wisely reflecting on the fact
that this year many football
games seem to be won on last
second plays at the drop of a hat,
Theta Chi has stocked up and is
ready.
