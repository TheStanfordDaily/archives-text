# Dutch: Indian Scout
## 
### HALL DAILY 
"UCLA has an extremely
explosive offense. Obviously, the
more they get the ball, the better
their chances to score. In (Dennis)
Dummit, a 58% passer, the Bruins
command a fine pass attack that
includes a variety of great
receivers. They'll be more difficult
to cover than Purdue was."
So says Dutch Fehring, head
scout for the Indians' varsity
football team.
"With runners like Greg Jones
and Mickey Cureton who can go
all the way in one play, and Bill
Bolden who was outstanding
against Cal last week, our
defensive line is in for a busy
afternoon.
"Their offense is very unique.
The Bruins spread their linemen
wider than any team in the college
ranks. This makes blocking much
easier. As usual, Prothro's front
line isn't all that big, but they're
really quick."
Fehring also believes that the
Uclans "have all the weapons to
beat USC."
Scouts Important
When asked what the scout's
place is in a football era where
game films are exchanged, Fehring
outined three reasons why scouts
are needed.
"First, films can either show
detailed pass protection and
blocking or pass patterns and
coverage, but not both. The â– 
wide-angle lens just can't show
enough detail.
Secondly, even distant cameras
can't accurately record kick
protection and coverage and
blocking. It demands a trained eye
on the scene watching the play

develop to fully understand the
strategy.
Film Fails
Third, a film simply can't catch
the tempo of the game. For
example in the Purdue-Notre
Dame game, you have to be there
to see how charged up Purdue
really was."
Fehring describes his job as
"harder than it used to be. When I
played football, there was only
one defense. Today, teams run
eighty offensive plays a game
from many different variations.
The defense has ten to twelve
plays and formations plus
countless stunts.
"Coach John Ralston asks
three things of his scouts: 1) how
can we gain? 2) how can we stop
them? 3) how can we win? Since
it's impossible to get all the
information, we employ a detailed
system of analysis."
Long Weekend
Fehring's reports, which take
twelve hours to compile, are
delivered to the coaches on the
Sunday night prior to the next
game. He then addresses the team
on Monday.
The scouting reports, one for
offense and one for defense,
include seven main categories. The
report begins with a line-up

description of names and sizes for
the opposing players, followed by
a thumb-nail sketch designed to
acquaint the Indian starters with
their opponent's specialties,
strengths or weaknesses. Fehring
then writes some general
recommendations for game
strategy.
This report is followed by the
opponent's best plays, formation
tendencies and play effectiveness,
hit charts, and kicking formations.
These diagrams and charts are
compiled from IBM cards filled
out at game time.
Ratings Meaningless
When asked about football
ratings, Fehring replied: "I don't
believe in them. Ratings don't
mean a thing. The only way to
determine true standings is to
have each conference team play
everyone in their conference.
"Ohio State is probably the
best national team. But if Texas
beat Cal 17-0 and UCLA beat Cal
32-0, why is Texas so much higher
than UCLA?"
In an optimistic conclusion,
Fehring capsulized his view of this
season's Stanford football team.
"If there are ten or more better
teams in the nation (than
Stanford), I'd like to see them."
