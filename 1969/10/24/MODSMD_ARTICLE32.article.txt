# Hockey Team Bombed, 10-3
## 
### 
Despite a remarkable 57-save
performance by goalie Gary
Aitken, the Stanford hockey
teams was shelled, 10-3, Monday
night by the Berkeley Bruins, in a
fight-marred game played at
Legg's Arena in San Francisco.
Aitken was nearly a one-man
gang; the Indian attack was
disorganized and desultory, and
the defense sloppy and porous.
The bright hopes that shined
through last week's loss to
Belmont were nowhere in
evidence this time; the team
simply did not have it.
The Indians have a formidable
task ahead of them next week in
another road game against the San
Francisco Hawks. The Hawks
were 6-5 winners over Berkeley a
week ago, and on that basis must
be considered several goal
favorites over Stanford. The
Cards' next home game will be
November 4.
