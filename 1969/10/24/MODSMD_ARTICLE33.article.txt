# Polo: Indians vs. No. I Bruins
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Working on a three game
winning streak, the Stanford
water polo team swings back into
action this weekend with a pair of
games against De Anza and
UCLA. Friday the Indians travel
to Cupertino to take on De Anza
Junior College whom they
defeated two weeks ago, 6-4.
Saturday morning the Indians
return to Encina Pool for an all
important 10:00 a.m. contest
with the undefeated Pac-8
favorites, UCLA. In the first week
of the season, the Bruins defeated
Stanford 10-4 in the finals of the
UC Irvine Tournament.
Tribe Comes Back
But since that time, the young
Stanford team has made great
strides in compiling an 8-3 record,
and Coach Jim Gaughran expects
a close contest on Saturday.
Leading the Bruin attack will
be two All-American AAU
performers, Torrey Webb and Jim
Ferguson. While Webb and

Ferguson have been leading the
offensive attack, goalie Kevin
Craig has also done an outstanding
job. Last weekend the Bruins
maintained their perfect record by
dumping a good California team,
6-2. Coach Gaughran pointed out
that not only do the Bruins have

outstanding front liners, but they
also have great depth.
Broken Eardrum
As far as Stanford is
concerned, Gaughran reports that
the team is ready for UCLA, but
they will have to overcome a
couple of costly injuries.
