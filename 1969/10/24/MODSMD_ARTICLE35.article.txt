# Frosh Alert To Bruins Bombs
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
It will be Jim Wise at
quarterback again tomorrow as
the Papooses meet the Baby
Bruins ot UCLA in the freshman
home opener at Stanford
Stadium. Kick-off is set for 10
a.m.
"We're coming off a good week
of practice," commented Coach
Bill Moultrie. "We've gotten in a
lot of hard work and I'm
confident that the kids are really
ready for this one. We're looking
to knock off the Bruins and then
go after San Jose and Cal."
Eric Cross, who accounted for
both Indian touchdowns last week
in the Coliseum, has been hobbled
by a sore leg, and Barr Curry may
draw the starting nod ahead of
him. "We'll have Curry in that
backfield somewhere," said Coach
Moultrie, "he's done a real good
job this week."
DEFENSE READY
UCLA scored three times in
the final quarter last week to nip
Berkeley, 21-20. "They just stood
back and heaved the football and
beat the Bears' safety on three
plays. If we're up by 20 going into

the final period you can bet fairly
safely that we'll still have more
points on the scoreboard when he
gun goes off," noted the oach.
New Assistant
One assurance might be the
addition to Tom Massey to the
assistant coaching staff. Massey,
who graduated from Stanford a
year ago and had a try-out with
the Dallas Cowbpys, has been
working all week with he
defensive backs. "We're delighted
to have him aboard," commented
Head Coach Moultrie.
"I'm very optimistic about this
game," the coach concluded.
"Our kids have been under the
gun and know what it's like to
play 60 minutes of football. I
definitely feel they're ready, nd I
guess we'll know for sure round
about noon-time Saturday."

UCLA scored three times in
the final quarter last week to nip
Berkeley, 21-20. "They just stood
back and heaved the football and
beat the Bears' safety on three
plays. If we're up by 20 going into

the final period you can bet fairly
safely that we'll still have more
points on the scoreboard when he
gun goes off," noted the oach.
New Assistant
One assurance might be the
addition to Tom Massey to the
assistant coaching staff. Massey,
who graduated from Stanford a
year ago and had a try-out with
the Dallas Cowbpys, has been
working all week with he
defensive backs. "We're delighted
to have him aboard," commented
Head Coach Moultrie.
"I'm very optimistic about this
game," the coach concluded.
"Our kids have been under the
gun and know what it's like to
play 60 minutes of football. I
definitely feel they're ready, nd I
guess we'll know for sure round
about noon-time Saturday."
Game Broadcast
The KZSU Sports Department
will broadcast the Stanford-UCLA
frosh game Saturday morning at
9:50 a.m.
The play by play broadcast will
be anchored by KZSU sports
director Dave Hosley with John
Bennett and Chris Hendrickson.
The campus station will also
broadcast the freshman game next
week at San Jose State. KZSU is
90.1 on the FM dial and 880 AM
in dorms.
It will be Jim Wise at
quarterback again tomorrow as
the Papooses meet the Baby
Bruins ot UCLA in the freshman
home opener at Stanford
Stadium. Kick-off is set for 10
a.m.
"We're coming off a good week
of practice," commented Coach
Bill Moultrie. "We've gotten in a
lot of hard work and I'm
confident that the kids are really
ready for this one. We're looking
to knock off the Bruins and then
go after San Jose and Cal."
Eric Cross, who accounted for
both Indian touchdowns last week
in the Coliseum, has been hobbled
by a sore leg, and Barr Curry may
draw the starting nod ahead of
him. "We'll have Curry in that
backfield somewhere," said Coach
Moultrie, "he's done a real good
job this week."
