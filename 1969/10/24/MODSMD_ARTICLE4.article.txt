# Painters, Carpenters Face Layoffs From Rising Costs
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
â€¢ Rising production costs due to
inefficient work by the staff is
blamed for the tentative layoff of
the university's painters and
carpenters Jan. 1. But the men say
the problem is in administration.
University business manager
Dwight Adams told the angry
group of Stanford maintenance
employees yesterday that rising
production costs had precipitated
the decision. While stating he was
sympathetic with the problems in
the shop, he said he considered
the department inefficient, and
said that "on the whole, outside
contractors could do the work
more economically."
Adams talked with the
carpenters and painters to
"squelch unfounded rumors and

learn the problems of the men,"
according to a statement prepared
by the business manager.
The carpenters were insistent
that they could compete, and one
man, who asked to remain
unidentified, said that "the
quality of our work often
surpasses that of contractors, and
will save money and time."
Several of the men remarked
that negligent ordering of
materials was a big factor in
pushing the cost up. "If a part is
not in stock, it may take eight
weeks to get it; work conditions
change, and our costs go way up,"
pointed out another employee.
Cost Prohibitive
Adams said he had received no
complaints about quality of work,

but that cost was becoming
prohibitive.
"If you men can't find out
why, and do something about it,
we'll have to eliminate the
department," Adams said.
Adams explained that the gap
between the University's income
and expenses was forcing it to
look for means of cutting costs.
"The painting and carpentry
departments are a luxury, and in
hard times we can do without
them," he said.
Many workers were shocked by
this decision, because they felt
they were accepting lower pay in
return for job security, arid will
now lose the retirement benefits,
except for the money they had
put in.

Stanford employees are not
covered by unemployment
compensation, which leaves these
men, many of whom are in their
late 50's, with no source of
income.
The men contended that in
many cases they were faced with
conditions, such as having to work
around students and faculty,
whereas contractors work in clear
areas. Rising costs can result from
administrative inefficiency, as well
as inefficient labor, the men
pointed out.
INo Coordination
Adams said he would look into
charges of non-coordination
between front office and workers,
alleged double billing on several
purchases, and the fact that there
is little or no chance for the men
to express their ideas to
management.
Adams charged that the
non-competitive cost of the shop
was due to the loafing of a few
men, who ruin the good record of
the other workers.
The men are extremely fearful
of losing their jobs and are still
hopeful that the layoffs will not
occur. Workers were reticent to
talk, and wanted no publicity.
Julia Harvie of the United
Stanford Employees was at the
meeting, and told the Daily that
men had contacted her and asked
for the help of the USK.
A petition, signed by 1 7 men,
asks that they not be fired, but
that they be either relocated or
retained.
for the help of the United Stan
ford Employees, a newly-formed
staff group.
