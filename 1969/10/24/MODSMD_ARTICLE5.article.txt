# Hoover Man, ACLU Test Army Security
## 
### 
The Northern California
chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU-NC) has
joined Hoover Institution
researcher Julius Epstein in a
court battle for access to some
top secret World War II
documents.
At stake is a provision of the
1964 Freedom of Information
Act, which allows court review of
military classifications. Under the
act, Epstein contends, the
government has the burden of

justifying its classification when a
suit is brought for disclosure.
In an amicus curiae brief filed
with the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals, the ACLU-NC argues
that "the Army has not shown
why its subsidiary papers must
remain hidden fro view when the
far more sensitive, important, top
secret, and directly related Yalta
papers were open to public view
almost 15 years ago."
Epstein has been trying since
1954 to see U.S. Army records
concerning "Operation Keelhaul,"
the forced repatriation of almost a
million anti-communist Russians
to the Soviet Union in the closing
days of World War 11. He wants
the documents for a nearly
completed book on the subject.
After passage of the Freedom
of Information Act, Epstein
brought suit in a Federal District
Court against the Secretary of the
Army, Department of the Army
and Department of Defense. Hs is
the first case involving military
secrecy under the act.
Last February, Judge Oliver J.
Carter granted the Army's request
for a summary judgment in its
favor, saying the Army need only

show its classification of sensitive
documents was not "capricious"
or "clearly arbitrary." Epstein
appealed the decision to the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Under the law, the ACLU-NC
brief contends, the trial court
"should have used its own
judgment and determined whether
the Army had sustained its burden
that the information requested
under the statute was properly
withheld."
Epstein said the documents
pose no security risk today. The
court should not rule on their
classification before it sees them,
he said.
Of those returned to Russia
under Operation Keelhaul,
Epstein claims hundreds were
executed and thousands forced to
spend up to a decade in Siberian
labor camps. When the prisoners
were politically rehabilitated in
1955, Pravda asserted that British
and American bayonets were used
to back their repatriation near the
end of World War 11.
Epstein pointed out that
decisions made at Yalta involving
the repatriation have never been
fully publicized.

act, Epstein contends, the
government has the burden of

justifying its classification when a
suit is brought for disclosure.
In an amicus curiae brief filed
with the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals, the ACLU-NC argues
that "the Army has not shown
why its subsidiary papers must
remain hidden fro view when the
far more sensitive, important, top
secret, and directly related Yalta
papers were open to public view
almost 15 years ago."
Epstein has been trying since
1954 to see U.S. Army records
concerning "Operation Keelhaul,"
the forced repatriation of almost a
million anti-communist Russians
to the Soviet Union in the closing
days of World War 11. He wants
the documents for a nearly
completed book on the subject.
After passage of the Freedom
of Information Act, Epstein
brought suit in a Federal District
Court against the Secretary of the
Army, Department of the Army
and Department of Defense. Hs is
the first case involving military
secrecy under the act.
Last February, Judge Oliver J.
Carter granted the Army's request
for a summary judgment in its
favor, saying the Army need only

show its classification of sensitive
documents was not "capricious"
or "clearly arbitrary." Epstein
appealed the decision to the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Under the law, the ACLU-NC
brief contends, the trial court
"should have used its own
judgment and determined whether
the Army had sustained its burden
that the information requested
under the statute was properly
withheld."
Epstein said the documents
pose no security risk today. The
court should not rule on their
classification before it sees them,
he said.
Of those returned to Russia
under Operation Keelhaul,
Epstein claims hundreds were
executed and thousands forced to
spend up to a decade in Siberian
labor camps. When the prisoners
were politically rehabilitated in
1955, Pravda asserted that British
and American bayonets were used
to back their repatriation near the
end of World War 11.
Epstein pointed out that
decisions made at Yalta involving
the repatriation have never been
fully publicized.
