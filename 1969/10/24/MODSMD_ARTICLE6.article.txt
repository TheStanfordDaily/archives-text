## Beckett Awarded Nobel Prize 
### 
STOCKHOLM y\P)-The 1969
Nobel Prize for literature was
awarded Thursday to Samuel
Beckett, the Irish emigrant
playwright of the absurd, whose
work was described as "a muffled
minor key sounding liberation for
the oppressed."
Beckett, 63, has written both
plays and novels. Two of his most
widely known plays premiered in
the United States: "Waiting for
Godot" and "Endgame," in which
two characters spoke their lines
while sitting in trash cans.
Beckett has lived in Paris for
more than three decades, and
writes in both French and English.
The Swedish Academy said he
was awarded the $72,800 prize
for "his writing which, in new
forms of the novel and drama,
acquires its elevation from the
destitution of modern man."
The Nobel Prize for literature
is the first to go to a French
writer since existentialist
philosopher-playwright Jean-Paul
Sarte turned down the award for
literature in 1964, saying he
wanted to remain free to bring
together the cultures of
communism and capitalism.
Davis AI Mills
OAKLAND, Calif.
(AP)—Communist Angela Davis
said Thursday the University of
California Regents have provided
her with "an audience of a million
people all over the country."
She said "by attempting to
prevent me from teaching 50 or

60 students on the UCLA
campus," the regents drew
nationwide publicity and
consequently increased her
audience 20,000 times.
The 25-year-old philosophy
instructor, in the San Francisco
Bay Area for speaking
engagements, was cheered by an
estimated 1,000 students at
Hayward State College. She then
went on to Mills College here
where she was greeted
enthusiastically by a crowd of
about 750.
At Hayward, she said
University of California education
is "a plot" to train and
indoctrinate students to take their
place in industry.
"They (UC) indoctrinate and
train people to go into firms like
Dow Chemical Co. and be
assimilated into industry," she
said.
"The last thing in the world
I'm interested in its indoctrinating
students. This does not mean that
I would not present Marxist
perspectives when they are
relevant," she added.
This week, UCLA Chancellor
Charles E. Young ordered credit
restored to Miss Davis' course
entitl d "Recurring
Philosophical Themes in
Black Literature."
His decision came after a
Superior Court judge said the
regents could not fire Miss Davis
because she belonged to the
Communist Party. She had been
teaching the course without credit
since regents fired her Sept. 19.

Arab Infights
BERUIT (AP)—Arab guerrillas
from Syria struck hard into
neighboring Lebanon Thursday in
retaliation for a Lebanese army
crackdown against
semiunderground commando
forces organized to harass Israel.
The guerrillas hit three border
posts and kidnaped 24 fromtier
guards, military sources reported.
In order Middle East
developments:
—Arab mortar fire Thursday
night raked five Lsraeli farm
settlements in the Jordan valley in
their heaviest shelling across the
Jordan River in more than a year,
Israeli sources said. Spokesmen
said one Israeli soldier was killed
and two were wounded in the
resulting duel, which raged at
times along a 20-mile front.
—In Cairo, a military
spokesman said an Israeli jet was
downed Thursday by Egyptian
interceptor craft when "a number
of enemy planes attempted to
bomb our positions in the
northern sector of the Suez Canal.
Apparently carried out with
Syria government encouragement
or acquiescence, the raid by a
force of about 300 irregular:; was
bigger than any launched by the
guerrillas against Israel since the
six-day war of June 1967.
Al Fatah, the Arab guerrilla
organization, claimed
responsibility for the three-headed
attack and later exchanged the
abducted guards for the body of a
slain guerrilla.

"Today's operations were only
a warning to Lebanese
authorities," A1 Fatah said in a
communique Thursday from its
headquarters in Damascus, the
Syrian capital.
Agnew Firm
LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP)-Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew said
Thursday he stands by his
description of some antiwar
leaders as "an effete corps of
impudent snobs."
He said he referred to "people
who are in the leadership of some
of the movements today "and not
to young people.
The description has drawn
criticism from Democratic leaders
and some Republicans. Agnew
spoke Sunday night at New
Orleans.
As he arrived in Palm Springs
he told newsmen "I stand 100
percent behind my statements,
but I think some of them have
been misunderstood and
misinterpreted."
In his New Orleans speech,
Agnew discussed the Oct. 15
Moratorium participants and said:
"A spirit of national masochism
prevails, encouraged by an effete
corps of impudent snobs who
characterize themselves as
intellectuals."
Asked about the speech,
Agnew said he was not criticizing
all the nation's young people.

"Nor was I criticizing all of the
demonstrators who march; in the
Moratorium.
"What I said was that the hard
core leadership of the Moratorium
were people whom I thought for
the most part had reprehensible
motives."

STOCKHOLM y\P)-The 1969
Nobel Prize for literature was
awarded Thursday to Samuel
Beckett, the Irish emigrant
playwright of the absurd, whose
work was described as "a muffled
minor key sounding liberation for
the oppressed."
Beckett, 63, has written both
plays and novels. Two of his most
widely known plays premiered in
the United States: "Waiting for
Godot" and "Endgame," in which
two characters spoke their lines
while sitting in trash cans.
Beckett has lived in Paris for
more than three decades, and
writes in both French and English.
The Swedish Academy said he
was awarded the $72,800 prize
for "his writing which, in new
forms of the novel and drama,
acquires its elevation from the
destitution of modern man."
The Nobel Prize for literature
is the first to go to a French
writer since existentialist
philosopher-playwright Jean-Paul
Sarte turned down the award for
literature in 1964, saying he
wanted to remain free to bring
together the cultures of
communism and capitalism.
Davis AI Mills
OAKLAND, Calif.
(AP)—Communist Angela Davis
said Thursday the University of
California Regents have provided
her with "an audience of a million
people all over the country."
She said "by attempting to
prevent me from teaching 50 or

60 students on the UCLA
campus," the regents drew
nationwide publicity and
consequently increased her
audience 20,000 times.
The 25-year-old philosophy
instructor, in the San Francisco
Bay Area for speaking
engagements, was cheered by an
estimated 1,000 students at
Hayward State College. She then
went on to Mills College here
where she was greeted
enthusiastically by a crowd of
about 750.
At Hayward, she said
University of California education
is "a plot" to train and
indoctrinate students to take their
place in industry.
"They (UC) indoctrinate and
train people to go into firms like
Dow Chemical Co. and be
assimilated into industry," she
said.
"The last thing in the world
I'm interested in its indoctrinating
students. This does not mean that
I would not present Marxist
perspectives when they are
relevant," she added.
This week, UCLA Chancellor
Charles E. Young ordered credit
restored to Miss Davis' course
entitl d "Recurring
Philosophical Themes in
Black Literature."
His decision came after a
Superior Court judge said the
regents could not fire Miss Davis
because she belonged to the
Communist Party. She had been
teaching the course without credit
since regents fired her Sept. 19.

Arab Infights
BERUIT (AP)—Arab guerrillas
from Syria struck hard into
neighboring Lebanon Thursday in
retaliation for a Lebanese army
crackdown against
semiunderground commando
forces organized to harass Israel.
The guerrillas hit three border
posts and kidnaped 24 fromtier
guards, military sources reported.
In order Middle East
developments:
—Arab mortar fire Thursday
night raked five Lsraeli farm
settlements in the Jordan valley in
their heaviest shelling across the
Jordan River in more than a year,
Israeli sources said. Spokesmen
said one Israeli soldier was killed
and two were wounded in the
resulting duel, which raged at
times along a 20-mile front.
—In Cairo, a military
spokesman said an Israeli jet was
downed Thursday by Egyptian
interceptor craft when "a number
of enemy planes attempted to
bomb our positions in the
northern sector of the Suez Canal.
Apparently carried out with
Syria government encouragement
or acquiescence, the raid by a
force of about 300 irregular:; was
bigger than any launched by the
guerrillas against Israel since the
six-day war of June 1967.
Al Fatah, the Arab guerrilla
organization, claimed
responsibility for the three-headed
attack and later exchanged the
abducted guards for the body of a
slain guerrilla.

"Today's operations were only
a warning to Lebanese
authorities," A1 Fatah said in a
communique Thursday from its
headquarters in Damascus, the
Syrian capital.

The description has drawn
criticism from Democratic leaders
and some Republicans. Agnew
spoke Sunday night at New
Orleans.
As he arrived in Palm Springs
he told newsmen "I stand 100
percent behind my statements,
but I think some of them have
been misunderstood and
misinterpreted."
In his New Orleans speech,
Agnew discussed the Oct. 15
Moratorium participants and said:
"A spirit of national masochism
prevails, encouraged by an effete
corps of impudent snobs who
characterize themselves as
intellectuals."
Asked about the speech,
Agnew said he was not criticizing
all the nation's young people.

"Nor was I criticizing all of the
demonstrators who march; in the
Moratorium.
"What I said was that the hard
core leadership of the Moratorium
were people whom I thought for
the most part had reprehensible
motives."
STOCKHOLM y\P)-The 1969
Nobel Prize for literature was
awarded Thursday to Samuel
Beckett, the Irish emigrant
playwright of the absurd, whose
work was described as "a muffled
minor key sounding liberation for
the oppressed."
Beckett, 63, has written both
plays and novels. Two of his most
widely known plays premiered in
the United States: "Waiting for
Godot" and "Endgame," in which
two characters spoke their lines
while sitting in trash cans.
Beckett has lived in Paris for
more than three decades, and
writes in both French and English.
The Swedish Academy said he
was awarded the $72,800 prize
for "his writing which, in new
forms of the novel and drama,
acquires its elevation from the
destitution of modern man."
The Nobel Prize for literature
is the first to go to a French
writer since existentialist
philosopher-playwright Jean-Paul
Sarte turned down the award for
literature in 1964, saying he
wanted to remain free to bring
together the cultures of
communism and capitalism.
Davis AI Mills
OAKLAND, Calif.
(AP)—Communist Angela Davis
said Thursday the University of
California Regents have provided
her with "an audience of a million
people all over the country."
She said "by attempting to
prevent me from teaching 50 or

60 students on the UCLA
campus," the regents drew
nationwide publicity and
consequently increased her
audience 20,000 times.
The 25-year-old philosophy
instructor, in the San Francisco
Bay Area for speaking
engagements, was cheered by an
estimated 1,000 students at
Hayward State College. She then
went on to Mills College here
where she was greeted
enthusiastically by a crowd of
about 750.
At Hayward, she said
University of California education
is "a plot" to train and
indoctrinate students to take their
place in industry.
"They (UC) indoctrinate and
train people to go into firms like
Dow Chemical Co. and be
assimilated into industry," she
said.
"The last thing in the world
I'm interested in its indoctrinating
students. This does not mean that
I would not present Marxist
perspectives when they are
relevant," she added.
This week, UCLA Chancellor
Charles E. Young ordered credit
restored to Miss Davis' course
entitl d "Recurring
Philosophical Themes in
Black Literature."
His decision came after a
Superior Court judge said the
regents could not fire Miss Davis
because she belonged to the
Communist Party. She had been
teaching the course without credit
since regents fired her Sept. 19.

Arab Infights
BERUIT (AP)—Arab guerrillas
from Syria struck hard into
neighboring Lebanon Thursday in
retaliation for a Lebanese army
crackdown against
semiunderground commando
forces organized to harass Israel.
The guerrillas hit three border
posts and kidnaped 24 fromtier
guards, military sources reported.
In order Middle East
developments:
—Arab mortar fire Thursday
night raked five Lsraeli farm
settlements in the Jordan valley in
their heaviest shelling across the
Jordan River in more than a year,
Israeli sources said. Spokesmen
said one Israeli soldier was killed
and two were wounded in the
resulting duel, which raged at
times along a 20-mile front.
—In Cairo, a military
spokesman said an Israeli jet was
downed Thursday by Egyptian
interceptor craft when "a number
of enemy planes attempted to
bomb our positions in the
northern sector of the Suez Canal.
Apparently carried out with
Syria government encouragement
or acquiescence, the raid by a
force of about 300 irregular:; was
bigger than any launched by the
guerrillas against Israel since the
six-day war of June 1967.
Al Fatah, the Arab guerrilla
organization, claimed
responsibility for the three-headed
attack and later exchanged the
abducted guards for the body of a
slain guerrilla.

"Today's operations were only
a warning to Lebanese
authorities," A1 Fatah said in a
communique Thursday from its
headquarters in Damascus, the
Syrian capital.
