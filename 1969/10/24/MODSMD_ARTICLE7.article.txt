# Message To The Zodiac Killer
## 
### 
(Last Sunday, the San Francisco
EXAMINER printed an impassioned
message for the now-famous Zodiac
killer. Below, we offer our own
version of the EXAMINER'S eloquent
statement).
Let there be no more killing. But if
you must, try Paul McCartney.
Police say you are intelligent. If
you are, give yourself up and face
execution.
You are being hunted everywhere
in he state and nation. But don't get
jumpy.
You are alone in this world. Have
you noticed that most of your friends

have deserted you?
You are as much a victim of your
crimes as those whoses lives you
snuffed out. Of course you do seem to
be in better condition.
You cannot walk the streets a free
man. Of course, we have no idea who
you are.
But you will be caught, there is no
doubt. The police have staked out
every school bus in town and Melvin
Belli has been made a permanent guest
on every talk show in the Bay Area.
You face life as a hunted,
tormented animal—unless you help
yourself. Surrender. We have plenty of

cages available.
We ask that you give yourself up to
The Daily.
We offer you no protection, and no
sympathy. But we do offer you the
best medical help available and all the
benefits your legal rights afford. We
offer you the opportunity to transfer
into our fine institution. We offer you
a trailer in Manzanita Park. We offer
you a ticket to see Stanford in the
Rose Bowl. We offer you all the
plastic cups we can produce with your
signature and photograph. The food
service has consented to feed your
chocolate ice cream even if it isn't

available. We offer you a plastic dolly.
We offer you a seat in the balcony at
the flicks. We offer you credit in
Professor Erlich's Population Biology
course.
And best of all we offer to tell
YOUR STORY!
Why have you killed? We will give
you everything.
Your horoscope for today says
your anger at society is unwarranted,
that you will soon come into great
fortune. We offer you a subscription
to Fortune magazine.
We invite you to our staff meeting
on Monday at noon. Lunch is free. If

you have other things to do, call the
Daily anytime. Ask for anyone. We
are a community newspaper. The
telephone number is 321-2300 x 4632.
Call collect, what the hell. Your call
will not be traced.
We cordially invite our neighborly
newspaper The Palo Alto Times to
give you a better deal. Just cut your
hair and mumble kk l hate radicals."
Chances are they will make a more
promising overture.
Just remember Mr. Zodiac, you are
being hunted everywhere in he state
and nation. There is no safety for you,
anywhere.

you are.
But you will be caught, there is no
doubt. The police have staked out
every school bus in town and Melvin
Belli has been made a permanent guest
on every talk show in the Bay Area.
You face life as a hunted,
tormented animal—unless you help
yourself. Surrender. We have plenty of

cages available.
We ask that you give yourself up to
The Daily.
We offer you no protection, and no
sympathy. But we do offer you the
best medical help available and all the
benefits your legal rights afford. We
offer you the opportunity to transfer
into our fine institution. We offer you
a trailer in Manzanita Park. We offer
you a ticket to see Stanford in the
Rose Bowl. We offer you all the
plastic cups we can produce with your
signature and photograph. The food
service has consented to feed your
chocolate ice cream even if it isn't

available. We offer you a plastic dolly.
We offer you a seat in the balcony at
the flicks. We offer you credit in
Professor Erlich's Population Biology
course.
And best of all we offer to tell
YOUR STORY!
Why have you killed? We will give
you everything.
Your horoscope for today says
your anger at society is unwarranted,
that you will soon come into great
fortune. We offer you a subscription
to Fortune magazine.
We invite you to our staff meeting
on Monday at noon. Lunch is free. If

you have other things to do, call the
Daily anytime. Ask for anyone. We

hair and mumble kk l hate radicals."
Chances are they will make a more
promising overture.
Just remember Mr. Zodiac, you are
being hunted everywhere in he state
and nation. There is no safety for you,

Let there be no more killing. But if
you must, try Paul McCartney.
Police say you are intelligent. If
you are, give yourself up and face
execution.
You are being hunted everywhere
in he state and nation. But don't get
jumpy.
You are alone in this world. Have
you noticed that most of your friends

have deserted you?
You are as much a victim of your
crimes as those whoses lives you
snuffed out. Of course you do seem to
be in better condition.
You cannot walk the streets a free
man. Of course, we have no idea who
you are.
