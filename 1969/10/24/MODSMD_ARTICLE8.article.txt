# Greatest Vice-President
## Nixon's Back-up Man 
### Dan Bernstein 
Spiro T. Agnew could possibly
be the greatest vice-president in
the history of the United States.
Until now, I have hesitated to
come to his defense, knowing that
1 lacked concrete evidence to
prove my point. But by virtue of
the recent Moratorium, I have
everything I need to back the
overflowing group of
Agnew-critics into the corner
where they belong.
The entire sequence of events
began when, shortly before the
Moratorium, President Nixon
answered a reporter's question
about the October 15 protest by
uttering that "under no
circumstances will I be affected
by it." Confident that he again
had the nation in the palm of his
hand, President Nixon walked
back to his office, only to be
confronted by two of his top
aides.
"You went a little overboard
on the Moratorium issue, Mr.
President," said his first aide.
"First reaction from Congress is
pretty hostile, and you know the
kids aren't going to like it."
It was true. Richard Nixon had
slipped again. Reports were
flowing in teadily, most of them
indicating the President had
alienated himself from the public.

Even David and Julie were
reported to have been threatening
to cut their P.E. classes when the
fifteenth rolled around. Nixon
tried to call his wife, but she was
conveniently out of reach—an
unplanned visit to a nearby
hospital. Even his top advisors,
Bebe Rebozo, John Wayne, and
Ted Williams, all left messages
that they were not home. And
then, it happened.
"Mr. President, Vice-president
Agnew is in his office. You're to
meet him right away."
"Hello, Mr. Vice-president.
You wanted to see me?"
"Yes, Dick. Please sit down,"
was Mr. Agnew's reply. "Pretty
fiery speech you made this
morning, Dick. Perhaps you'd like
to explain yourself."
"Well, yes sir," said Nixon as
he squirmed uneasily, the steel
eyes of the vice-president glaring
into his own. "I suppose I got a
little carried away. I-"
"Carried away!!! Listen,
Nixon, we're trying to win a war
here in the best way we know
how—very slowly. At any rate, I
don't need you popping off at
press conferences, antagonizing
millions of people just to prove
you're regained your Whittier
College debate form."

"Nixon, if you expect to keep
me on the ticket in 1972, we're
going to have to come to a better
understanding about our
relationship. The fact if, X in sick
of bailing you out. Oh, sure i'll do
it this time, but only because I
consider Vietnam to be a little
more significant than my political
image. But mark my words, Dick,
if you pull something like you did
today, I won't call another press
conference. You'll be on your
own—you won't have Agnew to
kick around anymore."
Needless to say, the
Vice-president handled the
situation like a pro. He knew that
in order to offset Nixon's
untimely remarks, his would have
to be even worse. Thus, a selfless
crusader, and a man dedicated to
peace above all, Spiro T. Agnew
restored legitimacy of the
presidency by going much further
than Nixon in labeling the
Moratorium "an effete corps of
impudent snobs who characterize
themselves an intellectuals."
Naturally, after a statement like
this, there would be a growing
anxiety about the quality of the
nation's leadership. But when the
White House, according to plan,
released a statement indicating
that Vice-presidnet Agnew's views
were his own, the American

ftp ,
people were to console
themselves, reajisijjpthat at' least
the President was a man of reason,
whose judgment was superior to

his atrocious back-up man. And
once, ITgain, the people were
thankful for Richard Nixon's
good health.


"Ladies And Gentlemen—
The President and the Vice
President of the United States. "
