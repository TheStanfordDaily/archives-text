## Middle East: Any Alternatives? 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I do not think there is anyone
who believes that the present
fighting in the Middle East will
lead to any productive settlement
of the Arab-Israeli problem. But
what is your alternative, Miss
Mihaly? Do you propose that
Golda Meier turn over the
government to the fedayeen, and
slowly walk into he
Mediterranean? No, you seem to
be suggesting that all Israel has to
do is to rid itself of its "Exclusive
Zionism" and the Arabs will
welcome the errant Jews to their
bosoms as brothers. The simple
fact of the matter is that the
survival of individual Jews in the
Middle East would cease with the
ending of the "Jewish State."
The State of Israel is an
established fact. Any solution to
the problem must start with this
as its foundation. Any lasting
solution to he problem must
safely guarantee the borders of
each of the existing countries in
the area, and this must be done by
direct negotiations between the
conflicting parties. There is no
reason to believe that once this is
accomplished, other outstanding
problems cannot be settled
peacefully.
Miss Mihaly must have thought
that her term, "Zionism, ideology
of exclusivism," was her own
novel idea. I must regretfully
inform her that these words are
not new, but have been used for
many years as an excuse to
humiliate, restrict and
exterminate the Jewish people.
This is precisely why the Jewish
State must continue to exist.
Eretz Israel—the land of Israel —is
so much more than a reclaimed
desert. It is a haven from the
persecution and slaughter of the
last two thousand years.

Rose Bowl
Editor, THE DAILY:
Fred Mann's analysis of he
Rose Bowl race contains an error.
If the season ends with a
three-way tie between Stanford,
USC and UCLA, the point system
is used only to eliminate the third
team, not to decide who goes to
the Rose Bowl. Then the two
remaining teams are compared as
if it had been a two-way tie. Our
only change to go comes if USC
finishes third since we lost to
them. Thus we must win all the
rest of our games including the

Air Force game; UCLA must beat
USC and lose no more than one
nonconference game; and USC
must fail to win at least one other
game of any kind besides the
UCLA game if we are to go.
Whew!

Damaged Brain
Editor, STANFORD DAILY:
It was suggested in a recent
Daily that the University is the
brain of military-industrial-com
plex (MIC) that rules this country,
and that by controlling the
university, the MIC could be
brought to heel—a sort of "the
hand that rocks the cerebellum
rules the country" theory.
Analogies are fun to play with.
Psychologists have expended a
great deal of effort trying to
achieve brain control with limited
success. Drugs of various sorts dull
the mind, or in some cases make it
bigger. In cases of severe
pathology, isolation' or

destruction of certain areas of the
brain may be carried out. The
exact function of these areas in
the neocortex is unknown—the
result of such prefrontal
lobotamies is to reduce certain
types of behavior but at the cost
of an apparent lose of
individualism. Thus efforts at
"brain control" have seen only
limited success at best.
Damage to the brain, widescale
or occurring in certain critical
areas, can lead to impairment of
various functions, including
thought, language, and motor
control—and in many cases to
death.
The moral of the analogy? Be
careful with your brains—or
maybe its a bad analogy.

ASS (J Coverage
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your coverage of the recent
ASSU Senate election, or rather
your lack of coverage, 1 asert to

be a gross neglect of responsibility
to the Stanford student body.
I depend on the Daily for 99
per cent of my information about
what goes on here, and I believe
that there are a great many others
in my position. But all I find in
your paper are two inch inserts
that state only that there is an
election. Am I to base my choice
of candidates on the eye appeal of
their posters?
It is unfortunate that the
elections followed the October 15
Moratorium so closely. I
appreciate that a lot of time and
effort went into reporting and
editorializing on the Moratorium.
But surely there must be some
time left over to print the names,
affiliations, and capsule platforms
of the candidates.
Your policy of not printing
letters written by candidates
further deepens the gloom of
non-information.

A trocious Projections
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is about time that all film
buffs on campus stepped
muttering under their breaths
about the atrocious projections at
Tresidder and let it be known that
unless the quality of the
projection of Tresidder movies
improves they will simply boycott
the Friday and Saturday series.
Jumping pictures, no sound or
inaudible sound, long sequences
out of focus, and even reels shown
out of order have come to be
expected at Tresidder movies.
Why?
Are Tresidder projectionists
being paid enough? Ls the
equipment adequate? If the
Tresidder movies are suffering
financially, one reason must
surely be the number of movie
fans who have dropped out of the
Tresidder audience because of the
wretched quality of the
projections. There is little joy in
seeing good movies butchered
each week by technical
incompetence.
The Godard series on Friday
night is a real contribution to the
cultural life of Stanford, and
those who planned this series
deserve our praise. But should we
not reasonably expect that this
fine series be adequately
projected? The first showing of
the Godard film on last Friday
night was botched—the film wms
jumping most of the time, it was

frequently out of focus, and the
sound was lost for a while—but we
are not complaining of an isolated
breakdown. There is no excuse for
the rotten technical quality of
Tresidder projections for the past
two years.

Parking Situation
Editor, THE DAILY:
The parking situation on this
campus, once distressing, has now
become unbearable. Rather than
acknowledge the acute lack of
parking facilities for off campus
students, faculty, and staff, the
university seems to be determined
to maintain its unrealistic parking
regulations by means of the club.
If you, like us, are fed up with
getting five dollar Santa Clara
tickets for the crime of
attempting to park somewhere
within two miles of the nearest
civilization, THERE IS
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.
You have a right to a trial in
municipal court on every parking
ticket you receive. If everyone
who receives a Santa Clara ticket
demands a court trial, two
important results will occur. First
our campus cops will spend
practically every morning and
afternoon in court which means
they won't be available to write
tickets. Second, after several
weeks of parking ticket trials,
angry municipal court judges will
be calling somebody at Stanford
to fi.id out why the hell their
calendars are so clogged with
parking ticket cases that they
can't hear any other cases! At
least one possible legal question
arises. When the same police
officer can give either a $2
Stanford ticket or a $5 Santa
Clara ticket for the same offense
it seems that this practice might
be a denial of equal protection of
the law. Also there might be
illegal delegation of legislative
authority because Stanford is
given broad power to define what
constitutes illegal parking, and
then is allowed to give county
tickets to enforce its regulations.
In a campus where there is
parking for only a small
percentage of off campus vehicles
within walking distance of the
Quad, students are being made to
pay for the administration's
failure to plan adequately for
student parking needs.
