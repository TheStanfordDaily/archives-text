# Nader Claims Law Forgets Public Area
## 
### 
Social critic Ralph Nader
lambasted the legal profession
Friday afternoon, as an audience
composed largely of law students
crowded the physics tank to
applaud his criticisms.
It a meeting arranged by he
Law Forum, Nader attacked
lawyers for failing "to meet their
obligation to pay attention to the
integrity of the legal system." He
also blamed law schools for
reinforcing the existing structure
by "one of the most exquisite
patterns of thought control at the
graduate school level."
Changes are underway, Nader
said however, pointing to such
steps as consumer poverty courses
in law school and pro bono work
by established law firms. He said
the legal profession is
experiencing "a real shake-up."
Corporate Emphasis
Nader called the education
students get in most law schools
"a unilateral type of process."
Emphasis is on private and
corporate law, Professors usually
have experience only incorporate
law firms, he said. This emphasis
leads to a "decisive structuring of
the profession," Nader believes.
Corporate power has developed
largely "without control of law,"
Nader explained, and law firms
have been more concerned with
protecting their corporation
clients than ith protecting the
public interests.
There has been a "paucity of
thinking on corporate crime,"
Nader continued, despite
widespread violation by such
industries as food and
automobiles. Yet in terms of
population risk and frequency of
violation, "corporations are the
number one criminal."
Changes Foreseen
Nader did express hope for the
future, however. Even as the
present legal system is a product
of the past actions of law schools,
he believes that changes now
occurring in law schools will

eventually be reflected in the legal
system.
He described two events at
Harvard Law School, his alma
mater, which point to increased
interest in public service. Harvard
students have sent out a
questionnaire to law firms coming
to interview at Harvard asking
how the firms resolve conflicts
between public responsibility and
corporation retainers.
Also, the third-year class is
planning to establish a public
interest firm of eleven of its
members, which he others will
support with three per cent of
their annual incomes. The only
problem, Nader reports, is that
"everyone wants to sign up to be
part of the 11-man firm."
Nader urged Stanford law
students to set up a summer
program in California similar to
his program in Washington, D.C.
in which lawyers-to-be do
extensive research and
investigation. He mentioned
several "great opportunities for
study here in Reagan-land—land
use, the budget, pollution, and
many more."

planning to establish a public
interest firm of eleven of its
members, which he others will
support with three per cent of
their annual incomes. The only
problem, Nader reports, is that
"everyone wants to sign up to be
part of the 11-man firm."
Nader urged Stanford law
students to set up a summer
program in California similar to
his program in Washington, D.C.
in which lawyers-to-be do
extensive research and
investigation. He mentioned
several "great opportunities for
study here in Reagan-land—land
use, the budget, pollution, and
many more."


LEGAL OBLIGATIONS—Lawyer
Ralph Nader switched his concern
from social criticism to the legal
profession itself Friday at Stanford.
Social critic Ralph Nader
lambasted the legal profession
Friday afternoon, as an audience
composed largely of law students
crowded the physics tank to
applaud his criticisms.
It a meeting arranged by he
Law Forum, Nader attacked
lawyers for failing "to meet their
obligation to pay attention to the
integrity of the legal system." He
also blamed law schools for
reinforcing the existing structure
by "one of the most exquisite
patterns of thought control at the
graduate school level."
Changes are underway, Nader
said however, pointing to such
steps as consumer poverty courses
in law school and pro bono work
by established law firms. He said
the legal profession is
experiencing "a real shake-up."
Corporate Emphasis
Nader called the education
students get in most law schools
"a unilateral type of process."
Emphasis is on private and
corporate law, Professors usually
have experience only incorporate
law firms, he said. This emphasis
leads to a "decisive structuring of
the profession," Nader believes.
Corporate power has developed
largely "without control of law,"
Nader explained, and law firms
have been more concerned with
protecting their corporation
clients than ith protecting the
public interests.
There has been a "paucity of
thinking on corporate crime,"
Nader continued, despite
widespread violation by such
industries as food and
automobiles. Yet in terms of
population risk and frequency of
violation, "corporations are the
number one criminal."
Changes Foreseen
Nader did express hope for the
future, however. Even as the
present legal system is a product
of the past actions of law schools,
he believes that changes now
occurring in law schools will

eventually be reflected in the legal
system.
He described two events at
Harvard Law School, his alma
mater, which point to increased
interest in public service. Harvard
students have sent out a
questionnaire to law firms coming
to interview at Harvard asking
how the firms resolve conflicts
between public responsibility and
corporation retainers.
Also, the third-year class is
planning to establish a public
interest firm of eleven of its
members, which he others will
support with three per cent of
their annual incomes. The only
problem, Nader reports, is that
"everyone wants to sign up to be
