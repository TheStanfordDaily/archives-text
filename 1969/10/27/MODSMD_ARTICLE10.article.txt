Twelve persons in every 100 in
their twenties say they have tried
marijuana, according to the
Gallup Poll released Saturday. The
proportion for the public as a
whole is four in 100, or about five
million adults, the poll indicates.
These findings were recorded
in a nationwide survey of adults
21 years of age and older. A
previous Gallup survey of college
students showed 22 percent
saying they tried marijuana.
If all age groups, including
teen-agers, are taken into account,
an estimated total of 10 million
Americans have tried marijuana.
And five million more adults say
they would try a marijuana
cigarette if it were offered to
them.
"Have you, yourself, ever
happened to try marijuana?"
The results show not only
sharp differences on the basis of

age, but by education and region
as well, as seen in the following
table:

21-29 years 12

All persons in the survey who
said they have not tried marijuana
were asked if they would try a
marijuana cigarette if it were
offered them.
Four adults in 100 nationally,
and 10 in 100 among adults in
their twenties, said they would do
so.
