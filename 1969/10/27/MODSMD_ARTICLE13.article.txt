# Students Shot Near Fillmore
## 
### 
Two Stanford fraternity
brothers were reported in good
condition Sunday at San
Francisco General Hospital, after
being shot and wounded Friday
night.
George Williamson, 20, a junior
in engineering and member of
Kappa Sigma, and Mike Cooper,
22, a graduate student in business
and Resident Assistant at Alpha
Delta, were accosted by two
youths in the 1500 block of
Broderick Street in the city.
The men offered to provide the
students with women, and were
refused. One of the men pulled a
gun, and began firing, wounding
Cooper in the stomach, and
Williamson in the kidney.
Cooper was able to get out of
bed Sunday, and will probably be
released this week.
Williamson was still restricted
to bed. No date was given for his
release from the hospital.
