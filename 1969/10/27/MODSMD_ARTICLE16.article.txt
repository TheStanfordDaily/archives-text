# Campus Films
## Week's Flicks Previewed 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Spencer Tracy, Bette Davis,
Jeanne Moreau, Alec Guinness
and Steve McQueen are among
those making appearances on
campus screens this week.
Showing at the Monday night
experimental film series is
Kenneth Anger's underground
motorcycle classic, Scorpio
Rising. Also on the bill at 9 p.m.
in the art auditorium are Bruce
Conner's amusing Cosmic Ray and
Vivien * and Joris Ivens' 1928
short, The Bridge.
This Tuesday in Geology 320,
Clive Miller will present a Laurel
and Hardy feature film, Pack Up
Your Troubles, the first 15
minutes of which offers the team
at their best. 20,000 Years in Sing
Sing is a very curious prison
drama, which is occasionally naive
in outlook but which is also a
trenchant expose of prison
conditions as Roosevelt entered
office. Spencer Tracy is excellent
and the young Bette Davis is very
interesting, in that in 1933, it had
not yet been determined whether
she was an actress or a glamour
girl. Michael Curtiz directed.
Joseph Losey's Eva, this week's
International Center film, was
greeted with severely differing
reviews back in 1962, and
although the producers' artless
cutting and dubbing impaired
Losey's original vision, the film
remains a favorite in some circles.
The songs and life of Billie
Holiday and Michel Legrand's

score form the musical framework
for the film, which stars Jeanne
Moreau, Stanley Baker and Virna
Lisi. In Cubberley at 7:45 on
Thursday.
Coda id's Gangsters
Godard's Band of Outsiders
represents a return to the
Gallicized American gangster
milieu of Breathless with added
aspects of emotional distancing
and analysis which the director
had since incorporated into his
style. Nonetheless, it is a very
romantic and nostalgic work with
Godard, perhaps for the last time
in his career, looking back with
fondness to the movie past. The
picture, which features Anna
Karina and Claude Brasseur, will
be shown on Friday at Tresidder.
Though acclaimed from all
sides as having attained new
heights in the Czechoslovakia!!
cinema and predicted to become
an enduring classic, I found The
Shop on Main Street only vaguely
interesting and occasionally
pretentious. That there are some
powerfully dramatic scenes in the
film is as undeniable as the picture
is too long. The film's director,
Jan Kadar, has since sought refuge
in the West. At Cubberley on
Friday.
Kind Hearts and Coronets is
generally known as a showcase for
the versatility of Alec Guiness,
but it also contains a sterling,
charmingly sinister performance
by Dennis Price and one of the
most fabulous plots ever devised

for a film. This classic in the
British comic murder mystery
genre will be shown Saturday at
Tresidder.

Though The Thomas Crown
Affair seems to find favor with
most audiences on its dußious
strength as entertainment,

Norman Jewison's crime romance
represents the ultimate argument
against the currently popular
theory that "style is content."
Haskell Wexler's strenuous
cinematography is very pretty
indeed but is to little avail since
there is nothing in the story to get
excessively expressive about.
Steve McQueen and Faye
Dunnaway star in the Sunday
Flick.

SHORT TAKES: Even more
exciting than the San Francisco
Film Festival, which I'll report on
this Wednesday, has been the
Buster Keaton festival at the Surf
and Berkeley Telegraph. The
Cameraman, which ends Tuesday,
is among the master's most
brilliant works and is
accompanied in Berkeley by
Samuel Beckett's Film, which
features Keaton.
The Wanderer, now at the
Paris, is a sympathetic and
beautiful film but suffers from the
common disease of
artsy-craftsincss, even though the
stylishness is artistically justified
in this case. The film is like a nice
dream but it almost caused this
viewer to have some of his own.

Spencer Tracy, Bette Davis,
Jeanne Moreau, Alec Guinness
and Steve McQueen are among
those making appearances on
campus screens this week.
Showing at the Monday night
experimental film series is
Kenneth Anger's underground
motorcycle classic, Scorpio
Rising. Also on the bill at 9 p.m.
in the art auditorium are Bruce
Conner's amusing Cosmic Ray and
Vivien * and Joris Ivens' 1928
short, The Bridge.
This Tuesday in Geology 320,
Clive Miller will present a Laurel
and Hardy feature film, Pack Up
Your Troubles, the first 15
minutes of which offers the team
at their best. 20,000 Years in Sing
Sing is a very curious prison
drama, which is occasionally naive
in outlook but which is also a
trenchant expose of prison
conditions as Roosevelt entered
office. Spencer Tracy is excellent
and the young Bette Davis is very
interesting, in that in 1933, it had
not yet been determined whether
she was an actress or a glamour
girl. Michael Curtiz directed.
Joseph Losey's Eva, this week's
International Center film, was
greeted with severely differing
reviews back in 1962, and
although the producers' artless
cutting and dubbing impaired
Losey's original vision, the film
remains a favorite in some circles.
The songs and life of Billie
Holiday and Michel Legrand's

score form the musical framework
for the film, which stars Jeanne
Moreau, Stanley Baker and Virna
Lisi. In Cubberley at 7:45 on
Thursday.
Coda id's Gangsters
Godard's Band of Outsiders
represents a return to the
Gallicized American gangster
milieu of Breathless with added
aspects of emotional distancing
and analysis which the director
had since incorporated into his
style. Nonetheless, it is a very
romantic and nostalgic work with
Godard, perhaps for the last time
in his career, looking back with
fondness to the movie past. The
picture, which features Anna
Karina and Claude Brasseur, will
be shown on Friday at Tresidder.
Though acclaimed from all
sides as having attained new
heights in the Czechoslovakia!!
cinema and predicted to become
an enduring classic, I found The
Shop on Main Street only vaguely
interesting and occasionally
pretentious. That there are some
powerfully dramatic scenes in the
film is as undeniable as the picture
is too long. The film's director,
Jan Kadar, has since sought refuge
in the West. At Cubberley on
Friday.
Kind Hearts and Coronets is
generally known as a showcase for
the versatility of Alec Guiness,
but it also contains a sterling,
charmingly sinister performance
by Dennis Price and one of the
most fabulous plots ever devised

for a film. This classic in the
British comic murder mystery
genre will be shown Saturday at
Tresidder.

Though The Thomas Crown
Affair seems to find favor with
most audiences on its dußious
strength as entertainment,

Norman Jewison's crime romance
represents the ultimate argument
against the currently popular
theory that "style is content."
Haskell Wexler's strenuous
cinematography is very pretty
indeed but is to little avail since
there is nothing in the story to get
excessively expressive about.
Steve McQueen and Faye
Dunnaway star in the Sunday
Flick.

SHORT TAKES: Even more
exciting than the San Francisco
Film Festival, which I'll report on
this Wednesday, has been the
Buster Keaton festival at the Surf
and Berkeley Telegraph. The
Cameraman, which ends Tuesday,
is among the master's most
brilliant works and is
accompanied in Berkeley by
