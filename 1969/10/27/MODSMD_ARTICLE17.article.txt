# No Justice For Tribe; Victory Escapes Again
## 
### FRED MANN 
John Ralston sat with his head down and stared
into his empty coffee cup. The shoulders were
hunched and the dimples that accompany his smile
were no where to be seen.
It was a pose he had struck much too
frequently in this supposed championship year. In
three of the season's six weeks, Stanford had failed
to win. Yet on the somewhat obscure bright side,
they did not lose on Saturday.
"I'm very disappointed," he said. His voice was
more telling than his words. After Purdue, and
especially USC, Ralston was hurt and upset. But
after this standoff, he seemed bewildered as well.
84,000 people, the largest home crowd in years,
had seen justice dessert the Indians once again.
Ralsion was the most concerned spectator. "We
won a lot of individual battles, but couldn't win
the ball game," he said quietly. "The boys are very
down."
Even Ralston, the eternal optimist, was hard
pressed to find happy subjects. "We can still finish
with the best Stanford record in years, and a very
high conference finish." But the words seemed
empty. The Rose Bowl was gone, and the way the
polls vote, even a 20-20 tie with the sixth rated team
probably would not raise Stanford's position.
Teams with 3-2-1 records just don't get a lot of
votes.
Over on he other side, things were just as
gloomy. The perfect UCLA season was ruined. The
fact that they came within a hand of losing never
got discussed.
"There's no such thing as a successful tie," said
Tommy Prothro. The Tenessee businessman-coach
was also upset. But he could find one bit of
satisfaction. "We hadn't come close to blocking a
field goal all year," he quipped, "before today."
The block in question frustrated the Indians in
their last minute victory march—the same tactic
that had destroyed the Cards themselves in Los
Angeles. But on no one was the frustration more
evident than place-kicker Steve Horowitz.
The junior from Beverly Hills, whose field goal
problems ended with the near game-winning boot
against SC, had already scored eight points with
two field goals (30 and 27 yards), and two PAT's.
When he got his final chance, there were four
seconds on the clock. He had a chance to be Ron
Ayala all over again.

But Vince Bischof and Mike Ballou broke
through a porous Stanford line, and Bischof
blocked the attempt. "It felt good," Horowitz
said. "I thought it would have been good if they
hadn't blocked it."
Coach Ralston agreed, "Steve was not late on
the kick at all. He got a good foot into it, but
UCLA just wanted to block it, and they did."
The tie ended any Stanford dreams of roses,
but did not substantially hurt UCLA. It all boils
down to theSouthern California Big Game with the
Bruins and SC. After their first touchdown and
missed conversion, UCLA never went for a
two-point PAT to make up the difference. Perhaps
they didn't want to gamble with a loss which
would have hurt their bowl chances seriously.
Although the afternoon proved unkind to
Stanford in general, with their comeback hopes
dashed, individuals again showed brilliance. Bubba
Brown and Randy Vataha stole the show for the
Tribe, while Dennis Dummit proved he is for real
for the Bruins.
Brown ran on UCLA like no one has all year.
The flashy halfback used his great acceleration to
advantage, flying by the close Bruin backers. He
totaled 100 yards on the ground, showing up the
Bruins' pair of volatile backs, Greg Jones and
Mickey Cureton. Coming in with an 8-yard per
carry average, Cureton was held to 71 yards in 20
attempts.
Vataha was brilliant in hauling in Jim Plunkett's
passes, and the numerous great catches resulted in
two TD's. A final pass to the tiny flanker was in his
hands in the end zone with :1 7 on the clock, but a
murderous tackle by Danny Graham jarred it
loose.
Plunkett, although not at his best (26 for 44
and 263 yards), became the all-time Stanford
offense leader with 3,771 career yards. He topped
Dick Norman's record of 3,654 and Jim still has
another whole season to improve this mark. His
two TD passes to Vataha tied him for most
touchdown tosses with Bobby Garrett (28).
Dummit really stole the quarterbacking show
however, as he controlled the tempo of the second
half, and the third quarter in particular. He moved
the Bruins time and again, and mixed his calls
beautifully. Stanford, as always won the statistical
battle—just not the ball game.

Plunkett, although not at his best (26 for 44
and 263 yards), became the all-time Stanford
offense leader with 3,771 career yards. He topped
Dick Norman's record of 3,654 and Jim still has
another whole season to improve this mark. His
two TD passes to Vataha tied him for most
touchdown tosses with Bobby Garrett (28).
Dummit really stole the quarterbacking show
however, as he controlled the tempo of the second
half, and the third quarter in particular. He moved
the Bruins time and again, and mixed his calls
beautifully. Stanford, as always won the statistical
battle—just not the ball game.
John Ralston sat with his head down and stared
into his empty coffee cup. The shoulders were
hunched and the dimples that accompany his smile
were no where to be seen.
It was a pose he had struck much too
frequently in this supposed championship year. In
three of the season's six weeks, Stanford had failed
to win. Yet on the somewhat obscure bright side,
they did not lose on Saturday.
"I'm very disappointed," he said. His voice was
more telling than his words. After Purdue, and
especially USC, Ralston was hurt and upset. But
after this standoff, he seemed bewildered as well.
84,000 people, the largest home crowd in years,
had seen justice dessert the Indians once again.
Ralsion was the most concerned spectator. "We
won a lot of individual battles, but couldn't win
the ball game," he said quietly. "The boys are very
down."
Even Ralston, the eternal optimist, was hard
pressed to find happy subjects. "We can still finish
with the best Stanford record in years, and a very
high conference finish." But the words seemed
empty. The Rose Bowl was gone, and the way the
polls vote, even a 20-20 tie with the sixth rated team
probably would not raise Stanford's position.
Teams with 3-2-1 records just don't get a lot of
votes.
Over on he other side, things were just as
gloomy. The perfect UCLA season was ruined. The
fact that they came within a hand of losing never
got discussed.
"There's no such thing as a successful tie," said
Tommy Prothro. The Tenessee businessman-coach
was also upset. But he could find one bit of
satisfaction. "We hadn't come close to blocking a
field goal all year," he quipped, "before today."
The block in question frustrated the Indians in
their last minute victory march—the same tactic
that had destroyed the Cards themselves in Los
Angeles. But on no one was the frustration more
evident than place-kicker Steve Horowitz.
The junior from Beverly Hills, whose field goal
problems ended with the near game-winning boot
against SC, had already scored eight points with
two field goals (30 and 27 yards), and two PAT's.
When he got his final chance, there were four
seconds on the clock. He had a chance to be Ron
Ayala all over again.

But Vince Bischof and Mike Ballou broke
through a porous Stanford line, and Bischof
blocked the attempt. "It felt good," Horowitz
said. "I thought it would have been good if they
hadn't blocked it."
Coach Ralston agreed, "Steve was not late on
the kick at all. He got a good foot into it, but
UCLA just wanted to block it, and they did."
The tie ended any Stanford dreams of roses,
but did not substantially hurt UCLA. It all boils
down to theSouthern California Big Game with the
Bruins and SC. After their first touchdown and
missed conversion, UCLA never went for a
two-point PAT to make up the difference. Perhaps
they didn't want to gamble with a loss which
would have hurt their bowl chances seriously.
Although the afternoon proved unkind to
Stanford in general, with their comeback hopes
dashed, individuals again showed brilliance. Bubba
Brown and Randy Vataha stole the show for the
Tribe, while Dennis Dummit proved he is for real
for the Bruins.
Brown ran on UCLA like no one has all year.
The flashy halfback used his great acceleration to
advantage, flying by the close Bruin backers. He
totaled 100 yards on the ground, showing up the
Bruins' pair of volatile backs, Greg Jones and
Mickey Cureton. Coming in with an 8-yard per
carry average, Cureton was held to 71 yards in 20
attempts.
Vataha was brilliant in hauling in Jim Plunkett's
passes, and the numerous great catches resulted in
two TD's. A final pass to the tiny flanker was in his
hands in the end zone with :1 7 on the clock, but a
murderous tackle by Danny Graham jarred it
loose.

advantage, flying by the close Bruin backers. He
totaled 100 yards on the ground, showing up the
Bruins' pair of volatile backs, Greg Jones and
Mickey Cureton. Coming in with an 8-yard per
carry average, Cureton was held to 71 yards in 20
attempts.
Vataha was brilliant in hauling in Jim Plunkett's
passes, and the numerous great catches resulted in
two TD's. A final pass to the tiny flanker was in his
hands in the end zone with :1 7 on the clock, but a
murderous tackle by Danny Graham jarred it
loose.
Plunkett, although not at his best (26 for 44
and 263 yards), became the all-time Stanford
offense leader with 3,771 career yards. He topped
Dick Norman's record of 3,654 and Jim still has
another whole season to improve this mark. His
two TD passes to Vataha tied him for most
touchdown tosses with Bobby Garrett (28).
Dummit really stole the quarterbacking show
however, as he controlled the tempo of the second
half, and the third quarter in particular. He moved
the Bruins time and again, and mixed his calls
beautifully. Stanford, as always won the statistical
battle—just not the ball game.
John Ralston sat with his head down and stared
into his empty coffee cup. The shoulders were
hunched and the dimples that accompany his smile
were no where to be seen.
It was a pose he had struck much too
frequently in this supposed championship year. In
three of the season's six weeks, Stanford had failed
to win. Yet on the somewhat obscure bright side,
they did not lose on Saturday.
"I'm very disappointed," he said. His voice was
more telling than his words. After Purdue, and
especially USC, Ralston was hurt and upset. But
after this standoff, he seemed bewildered as well.
84,000 people, the largest home crowd in years,
had seen justice dessert the Indians once again.
Ralsion was the most concerned spectator. "We
won a lot of individual battles, but couldn't win
the ball game," he said quietly. "The boys are very
down."
Even Ralston, the eternal optimist, was hard
pressed to find happy subjects. "We can still finish
with the best Stanford record in years, and a very
high conference finish." But the words seemed
empty. The Rose Bowl was gone, and the way the
polls vote, even a 20-20 tie with the sixth rated team
probably would not raise Stanford's position.
Teams with 3-2-1 records just don't get a lot of
votes.
Over on he other side, things were just as
gloomy. The perfect UCLA season was ruined. The
fact that they came within a hand of losing never
got discussed.
"There's no such thing as a successful tie," said
Tommy Prothro. The Tenessee businessman-coach
was also upset. But he could find one bit of
satisfaction. "We hadn't come close to blocking a
field goal all year," he quipped, "before today."
The block in question frustrated the Indians in
their last minute victory march—the same tactic
that had destroyed the Cards themselves in Los
Angeles. But on no one was the frustration more
evident than place-kicker Steve Horowitz.
The junior from Beverly Hills, whose field goal
problems ended with the near game-winning boot
against SC, had already scored eight points with
two field goals (30 and 27 yards), and two PAT's.
When he got his final chance, there were four
seconds on the clock. He had a chance to be Ron
Ayala all over again.

But Vince Bischof and Mike Ballou broke
through a porous Stanford line, and Bischof
blocked the attempt. "It felt good," Horowitz
said. "I thought it would have been good if they
hadn't blocked it."
Coach Ralston agreed, "Steve was not late on
the kick at all. He got a good foot into it, but
UCLA just wanted to block it, and they did."
The tie ended any Stanford dreams of roses,
but did not substantially hurt UCLA. It all boils
down to theSouthern California Big Game with the
Bruins and SC. After their first touchdown and
missed conversion, UCLA never went for a
two-point PAT to make up the difference. Perhaps
they didn't want to gamble with a loss which
would have hurt their bowl chances seriously.
Although the afternoon proved unkind to
Stanford in general, with their comeback hopes
dashed, individuals again showed brilliance. Bubba
Brown and Randy Vataha stole the show for the
Tribe, while Dennis Dummit proved he is for real
for the Bruins.
