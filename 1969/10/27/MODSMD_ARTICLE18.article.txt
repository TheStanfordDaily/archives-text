# Squeak By UCLA
## Frosh Win First, 21-20 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
It was left to the Stanford
freshman football team to provide
the bright spot in an otherwise
dismal weekend, when they evened
their record at 1-1 by knocking
off the Baby Bruins. 21-20.

Pat Moore, fdling in for the
injured Jim Wise was outstanding
as the Papoose field general
hitting Mike Boryla, Bill Scott,
and Bob Berry with pin-point
passes, and handing the football
off inside and out to Eric Gross,

Reggie Sanderson and Barr Curry.
The Indians kicked off and
UCLA wasted little time in
marching right down to and across
the Papoose goal line. But a
missed extra point, which was to
hurt later on left the score at 6-0.
Following Joe Martin's alert
interception of a Bruin aerial, the
Junior Tribe put together a
43-yard drive in seven plays, some
of the big ones being passes to
Boryla. But the biggest was Eric
Cross's two yard plunge into the
endzone. Duke Williams converted
to put the Papooses out in front,
7-6.
The Bruins weren't to be
denied however, and came
charging back following an
exchange of punts. Moving the
ball well, UCLA sprang their
tailback for a 50-yard ramble that,
despite a tremendous effort by
safety Ned Chambers, was enough
to set up the next touchdown. A
two point conversion followed,
and the Bruins carried a 14-7 lead
into the dressing room.
With the score standing at
20-19, Coach Bill Moultrie
gambled, and Bill Scott made a
diving catch just inside pay dirt
for the two biggest points of the
ball game, putting Stanford out in
front to stay, 21-20.
The Tribe dug in and stopped a
sustained UCLA drive at the
Stanford eight, then had a drive of
their own halted when a Moore
pass was picked off at the Bruin
20 and returned to the Indian 38.
With a big win under their
belts, the Junior Tribe looks set to
meet the Spartans of San Jose
next Friday, Halloween night, at
San Jose. The Little Big Game
with Berkeley comes up the week
after, on Novembers.

passes, and handing the football
off inside and out to Eric Gross,

Reggie Sanderson and Barr Curry.
The Indians kicked off and
UCLA wasted little time in
marching right down to and across
the Papoose goal line. But a
missed extra point, which was to
hurt later on left the score at 6-0.
Following Joe Martin's alert
interception of a Bruin aerial, the
Junior Tribe put together a
43-yard drive in seven plays, some
of the big ones being passes to
Boryla. But the biggest was Eric
Cross's two yard plunge into the
endzone. Duke Williams converted
to put the Papooses out in front,
7-6.
The Bruins weren't to be
denied however, and came
charging back following an
exchange of punts. Moving the
ball well, UCLA sprang their
tailback for a 50-yard ramble that,
despite a tremendous effort by
safety Ned Chambers, was enough
to set up the next touchdown. A
two point conversion followed,
and the Bruins carried a 14-7 lead
into the dressing room.
With the score standing at
20-19, Coach Bill Moultrie
gambled, and Bill Scott made a
diving catch just inside pay dirt
for the two biggest points of the
ball game, putting Stanford out in
front to stay, 21-20.
The Tribe dug in and stopped a
sustained UCLA drive at the
Stanford eight, then had a drive of
their own halted when a Moore
pass was picked off at the Bruin
20 and returned to the Indian 38.
With a big win under their
belts, the Junior Tribe looks set to
meet the Spartans of San Jose
next Friday, Halloween night, at
San Jose. The Little Big Game
with Berkeley comes up the week
after, on Novembers.
