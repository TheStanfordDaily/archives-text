# Stanford Poloists Fall To Top Ranked Bruins
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's water polo team
came up against the number one
team in the nation this weekend,
and when the contest was over,
UCLA had shown that they
definitely deserved this
distinction. They soundly
defeated the Indians, 10-5.
In a tuneup for Saturday's
game against the Bruins, the
Indians held on for an unexciting
5-4 win over De Anza oft Friday
afternoon. The Tribe couldn't
seem to get up for the game, and
after they took a 5-1 third quarter
lead, they let up. It almost cost
them the game. De Anza picked
up three goals to cut the margin
to 5-4, but the Indians stalled
away the last 1:46 to preserve the
victory.
On Saturday morning,
Stanford returned to Encina Pool
for its long awaited Pac-8
showdown with league favorites
UCLA. In front of a large crowd,
the Indians had hopes of an upset,
but the experienced Bruins took
control early as they jumped off
to a 3-0 first quarter advantage.
The Bruins maintained their
lead with a 5-2 halftime lead.
Stanford tried to fight back in the
second half, but the Bruins added

three more third quarter goals for
a 7-3 lead, and then they coasted
for the 10-5 victory.
Leading the attack for the
Bruins were two veteran AAU
All-Americans, Torrey Webb and
Jim Ferguson. Also outstanding
was Bruin goalie Kevin Graig.
From the start of the game, the
Indians seemed extremely
nervous, and they never really got
an effective attack going. The
cards seemed to depend too much
on Rick Massimino, who although
he scored four goals, could not
beat the Bruins by himself.
Too often the Indians failed to
move around and it is very hard to
beat a good team with a one man
offense. Stanford, was definitely
hurt by the loss of Wayne Wilson
and Ray Collins who were both
out with injuries.
On the other hand, the
experienced and well-trained
Bruins played to near perfection.
They showed a balanced offensive
attack and their passing and
defense were excellent.
The Indians now have a 9-4
record, but their league record is
0-2. Next weekend, they take on
USC at Stanford on Friday, and
University of the Pacific on
Saturday at Stockton.
