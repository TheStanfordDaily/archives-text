# Residents' Needs Not Met
## Hospital's Salary Crisis 
### PAUL D. GRUSHKIN 
Prospects of a fiscal crisis loom
large at Stanford University
Hospital as the institution
struggles to provide adequate
salaries for its interns and resident
physicians.
According to both hospital
administration and the doctors,
salaries are not keeping pace with
the rising costs of living. No one is
certain where the additional funds
are to come from to augment the
doctors' salaries.
Hospital director Dr. Thomas
A. Gonda said cutbacks to many
hospital departments are "certain
eventualities." He said that
because the hospital is wholly
dependent on patient revenue, in
the form of bed rates, and
ancillary services such as X-ray
testing. Both of these are fairly
constant, so hospital funds must
be redistributed.
"We must get the interns and
residents to a point where at least
all their basic needs are met,"said
Dr. Gonda. "We must give a man
a equate compensation
commensurate with his financial
situation, his basic living costs, his
long education, and his age—often
30 and over."
$8,700 Maxim um
Starting salary for first year
interns is $6000. These salaries are
increased by $500 yearly. If a
doctor has a family, he is given a
$1,000 dependency allowance.
Also, a chief resident MD, in his

third year as a resident, receives
an extra $600.
About 150 doctors presently
serve at the hospital, with
approximately 300 others
involved in a rotating program
between several hospitals.
Dr. Gonda declined to predict
salary increases for this year.
However, in the near future, he
hopes to see the starting level
raised to the vicinity of
$8-12,000.
A "Horrifying Situation"
He termed the salary lag
between faculty and resident
MD-students a "horrifying
situation."
Many financial obsticles must
be overcome before the hospital
can raise the salaries significantly.
The hospital itself is subsidized by
the government and medical
students are not aided beyond
certain fellowships and grants.
The hospital cannot raise its
bed rates forever, particularly
when it is striving to provide for
more patients at a reduced cost
per patient. Medicare and
Medicaid do not provide the
hospital with adequate
compensation.
Rising Costs
There are internal priorities in
the hospital. While two-thirds of
the annual budget goes toward
meeting labor costs, maintenance
costs and research costs,
expenditures in the specialized
programs, such as Nuclear

Medicine, are rising rapidly.
"There is no such thing as
maintaining the status quo in
research medicine," said Dr.
Gonda. If a hospital has made a
committment to do research in a
specialized area, it must continue
to allocate funds for maintenance
of that research. These research
committments may become a
serious drain on hospital
resources, he added.
Rapid Obsolence
Dr. Gonda pointed out that
"some of our machinery is
obsolete within six months of
installation." This constant
replacement of equipment drives
up hospital costs at an
unpredictable and rapid rate.
Stanford, like many other
hospitals across the nation, is
urged by the government to take
in more residents. Yet it cannot
adequately pay those presently in
residence.
"Thus," said Dr. Gonda, "we
are re-exploring our priorities.
There will be cutbacks, perhaps
extending to the clinics and the
School of Medicine. It is our
obligation to pay adequately. It is
a time for soul searching at
Stanford University Hospital."

a time for soul searching at
Stanford University Hospital."
Prospects of a fiscal crisis loom
large at Stanford University
Hospital as the institution
struggles to provide adequate
salaries for its interns and resident
physicians.
According to both hospital
administration and the doctors,
salaries are not keeping pace with
the rising costs of living. No one is
certain where the additional funds
are to come from to augment the
doctors' salaries.
Hospital director Dr. Thomas
A. Gonda said cutbacks to many
hospital departments are "certain
eventualities." He said that
because the hospital is wholly
dependent on patient revenue, in
the form of bed rates, and
ancillary services such as X-ray
testing. Both of these are fairly
constant, so hospital funds must
be redistributed.
"We must get the interns and
residents to a point where at least
all their basic needs are met,"said
Dr. Gonda. "We must give a man
a equate compensation
commensurate with his financial
situation, his basic living costs, his
long education, and his age—often
30 and over."
$8,700 Maxim um
Starting salary for first year
interns is $6000. These salaries are
increased by $500 yearly. If a
doctor has a family, he is given a
$1,000 dependency allowance.
Also, a chief resident MD, in his

third year as a resident, receives
an extra $600.
About 150 doctors presently
serve at the hospital, with
approximately 300 others
involved in a rotating program
between several hospitals.
Dr. Gonda declined to predict
salary increases for this year.
However, in the near future, he
hopes to see the starting level
raised to the vicinity of
$8-12,000.
A "Horrifying Situation"
He termed the salary lag
between faculty and resident
MD-students a "horrifying
situation."
Many financial obsticles must
be overcome before the hospital
can raise the salaries significantly.
The hospital itself is subsidized by
the government and medical
students are not aided beyond
certain fellowships and grants.
The hospital cannot raise its
bed rates forever, particularly
when it is striving to provide for
more patients at a reduced cost
per patient. Medicare and
Medicaid do not provide the
hospital with adequate
compensation.
Rising Costs
There are internal priorities in
the hospital. While two-thirds of
the annual budget goes toward
meeting labor costs, maintenance
costs and research costs,
expenditures in the specialized
programs, such as Nuclear

Medicine, are rising rapidly.
"There is no such thing as
maintaining the status quo in
research medicine," said Dr.
Gonda. If a hospital has made a
committment to do research in a
specialized area, it must continue
to allocate funds for maintenance
of that research. These research
committments may become a
serious drain on hospital
resources, he added.
Rapid Obsolence
Dr. Gonda pointed out that
"some of our machinery is
obsolete within six months of
installation." This constant
replacement of equipment drives
up hospital costs at an
unpredictable and rapid rate.
Stanford, like many other
hospitals across the nation, is
urged by the government to take
in more residents. Yet it cannot
adequately pay those presently in
residence.
"Thus," said Dr. Gonda, "we
are re-exploring our priorities.
There will be cutbacks, perhaps
extending to the clinics and the
School of Medicine. It is our
obligation to pay adequately. It is
a time for soul searching at
Stanford University Hospital."
