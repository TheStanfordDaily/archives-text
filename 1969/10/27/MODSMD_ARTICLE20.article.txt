# IM Power
## Phi Delts Team To Beat 
### SCOTT BURNS 
The rule change that allows professional
athletes to play intramurals has really helped the
already tough Phi Delt football team to become
the team to beat in IM football.
Frank Duffy and Hi Lewis, both pro baseball
players, have really bolstered the Phi Delt's
attack— Duffy's precision quarterbacking has
created an unbelieveable offense. The Phi Delts
showed their power for the second time this
season as they rolled up the season's highest score,
81-0, over the Lambda Nu's last week.
Their power may have been overused though,
for the game was a mismatch from the beginning,
and the Phi Delt's disregarded that fact and did
everything they could to run up the score as high
as passible against the hapless Nu's.
There still remain 23 other undefeated teams,
and some look almost as good as the Phi Delts.
The Dislocations, another great team, won their
second game, 57 0, over Minoso, and that gives
them 1 20 points in two games.
They are a tough team, but have not played a
good opponent yet. They may be beaten in their
very tough league. The KA's, another top team,
won their second game of the season over the
DU's, 31-7, on the pinpoint passing of sophomore

Scott Stillinger. He tossed 5 touchdown
passes—three of them to speedy Jack Robertson.
The SEA's, led by stalwart Fred Nold who
scored four touchdowns, downed the Theta Xi's
for their second win of the season, while the Chi
Psi's used the great passing combination of Gary
Garland to Jim Eakin (an awesome 6'7" end with
great speed and hands) to beat the Fiji's 20-0.
The Theta Delts also won their second game by
using six interceptions to beat the ATO's, 27-6.
The Theta Chi's took it in the seat of the pants as
they were beaten by two powerful teams, 25-6 by
the Sigma Chi's, and 31-2 by the Zetes.
The Computer Science team gets the Fickle
Finger of Football award for the week for it
finally got its offensive program debugged, and it
scored. It only has one minor problem to
overcome—its defense is still somewhat porous for
it has allowed 104 points in two games. But the
Comp Sci people shouldn't feel so bad for the
"Swiss Cheese Defense" of the Theta Xi's has
allowed 130 points so far this season.
There are three big games coming up this week
between strong unbeaten teams. Today, the Phuds
meet the Second Year Law team, and tomorrow,
the Chi Psi's play the Delts and the Dislocations
meet the Second Year Biz team.

scored. It only has one minor problem to
overcome—its defense is still somewhat porous for
it has allowed 104 points in two games. But the
Comp Sci people shouldn't feel so bad for the
"Swiss Cheese Defense" of the Theta Xi's has
allowed 130 points so far this season.
There are three big games coming up this week
between strong unbeaten teams. Today, the Phuds
meet the Second Year Law team, and tomorrow,
the Chi Psi's play the Delts and the Dislocations
meet the Second Year Biz team.
The rule change that allows professional
athletes to play intramurals has really helped the
already tough Phi Delt football team to become
the team to beat in IM football.
Frank Duffy and Hi Lewis, both pro baseball
players, have really bolstered the Phi Delt's
attack— Duffy's precision quarterbacking has
created an unbelieveable offense. The Phi Delts
showed their power for the second time this
season as they rolled up the season's highest score,
81-0, over the Lambda Nu's last week.
Their power may have been overused though,
for the game was a mismatch from the beginning,
and the Phi Delt's disregarded that fact and did
everything they could to run up the score as high
as passible against the hapless Nu's.
There still remain 23 other undefeated teams,
and some look almost as good as the Phi Delts.
The Dislocations, another great team, won their
second game, 57 0, over Minoso, and that gives
them 1 20 points in two games.
They are a tough team, but have not played a
good opponent yet. They may be beaten in their
very tough league. The KA's, another top team,
won their second game of the season over the
DU's, 31-7, on the pinpoint passing of sophomore

Scott Stillinger. He tossed 5 touchdown
passes—three of them to speedy Jack Robertson.
The SEA's, led by stalwart Fred Nold who
scored four touchdowns, downed the Theta Xi's
for their second win of the season, while the Chi
Psi's used the great passing combination of Gary
Garland to Jim Eakin (an awesome 6'7" end with
great speed and hands) to beat the Fiji's 20-0.
The Theta Delts also won their second game by
using six interceptions to beat the ATO's, 27-6.
The Theta Chi's took it in the seat of the pants as
they were beaten by two powerful teams, 25-6 by
the Sigma Chi's, and 31-2 by the Zetes.
The Computer Science team gets the Fickle
Finger of Football award for the week for it
finally got its offensive program debugged, and it
scored. It only has one minor problem to
overcome—its defense is still somewhat porous for
it has allowed 104 points in two games. But the
