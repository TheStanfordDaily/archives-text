## 147,000 Union Workers Strike G.E. 
### 
NEW YORK (AP)—Unions
representing 147,000 workers—9o
percent of the production
employees—at General Electric
Co. struck at midnight Sunday in
a bid for higher wages and
cost-of-living protection.
"Third shift" workers put up
picket lines at GE plants around
the country, several hours after
the company rejected a
last-minute bid for binding
arbitration of the national
contract dispute.
The first reported picket line
appeared outside the Hudson
Falls, N.Y., plant at 9:30 p.m., to
prevent workers from beginning a
10 p.m. shift.
The unsuccessful contract
negotiations had been led by two
unions representing a large
proportion of the company's
147,000 unionized employees.
The International Union of
Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO
represents 88,500 GE workers,
and the independent United
Electrical Workers represents
16,000. The UE and lUE
contracts expired at 12:01 a.m.
Monday.
Eleven other unions
representing GE workers promised
to support the strike.
GE negotiators offered an
immediate 20-cent increase in
hourly wages averaging $3.25,
with terms for wage reopeners in
the second and third years of a
three-year pact. The company had
also offered up to 25 cents hourly
in additional wages for special
skills.
The United Electrical strike
order was issued by union
president Albert J. Fitzgerald
following a one-hour meeting with
company representatives at GE's

50-story mid-Manhattan
headquarters.
"The General Electric Co.,
convinced of its divine wisdom,
has refused to change one penny,
one period or one comma of the
offer it delivered on Oct. 7,"
Fitzgerald said in a letter to the
independent union's 28 locals.
Pickets are expected at all
entrances of the General Electric
Co. Nuclear Division plant at San
Jose Monday morning, but
operations will continue, officials
said.
"All facilities will remain open
and operating," said plant
spokesman Lois Walker. "Salaried
employees are expected to come
to work, and hourly employees
are being encouraged to do so."
The plant employs about
3,000, a number of them white
collar workers, officials added.

SAIGON ( AP)—The
clandestine Viet Cong radio says
three captive American soldiers
will be released to show the Viet
Cong's "lenient and humane"
policies, U.S. radio monitors said
Monday.
The broadcast said all three,
from the American Division, were
captured by Viet Cong forces on
dates ranging from Jan. 10, 1968,
to March 9 this year south of Da
Nang. It was not known when
they would be freed.
The Vietnamese-language
broadcast called on American
fighting men in South Vietnam to
"resolutely stand up and protest
against their crime-studded
war ..."
It urged them to join with the
"American people to struggle to
force the U.S. government to

seriously negotiate" with North
Vietnam and the Viet Cong at the
Paris peace talks.
The broadcast also urged them
to press for the withdrawal of "all
U.S. and satellite troops in South
Vietnam, to end the war soon
and create conditions for tens of
thousands of U.S. troops to return
to their families."
One U.S. officer commented,
"The Viet Cong might try to get. a
little extra propaganda mileage
out of that when they release
these guys."

MEMPHIS, Tenn.
(AP)—Thousands of Negro
students in Memphis are expected
to stay home from school today,
the third "Black Monday" in as
many weeks.
The "Black Mondays" are part
of a pressure campaign by an
alliance of Negro organizations
leading up to a general work
stoppage by Negroes in the city
Nov. 3.
Two weeks ago, 62,000
youngsters out of 134,635
students in the school system did
not attend classes. Last Monday,
65,723 pupils and 675 teachers,
most of them Negro, were out of
school.
Negroes are demanding more
representation on the city's school
board—about 54 percent of the
school population is Negro—and a
strike by workers at a Catholic
operated hospital in Memphis still
remains unsettled.
City school officials have
warned they will use the state
compulsory attendance law to
punish children who skip classes.
Teachers have been told they face

dismissal for being absent without
cause.
The school board has approved
a plan to name a five-member,
biracial advisory committee by
Dec. 1 to ease tensions. The board
rejected a Negro demand that at
least two of the five white
members on the board resign to
make room for Negroes.
The school board has endorsed
a proposal for state legislation to
enlarge the board and elect
members by districts, thus
insuring Negro board members.
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Shah of Iran said Sunday that if
the United States would increase
its Iranian oil purchase quotas,
Iran would spend all the money
on American-made military and
capital goods.
"What we can offer you—l
don't know if other countries
could—is that for every barrel of
oil we sell here and every cent
that we make we are going to
spend it here locally to buy
American goods," the Shah,
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, said.
"What we need is in
accordance to the problems that
we should eventually face. So it's
a question of every kind of
equipment, but what I want to
buy here is not only military
hardware and equipment, it's also
capital goods . . ." the Shah said.

NEW ORLEANS (AP)-The
Secretary of the Navy said Sunday
that all U.S. naval "operating
forces" may be out of Vietnam by
next June because "we are
conducting the ultimate in the
Vietnamization program."
"We are training Vietnamese

sailors to take over our craft as
soon as they are capable of doing
so, " said Navy Secretary John H.
Chafee.
Chafee said at a news
conference here that as soon as
South Vietnam has one man
trained, he immediately replaces
an American. So far more than
200 U.S. vessels have been turned
over to the South Vietnamese, he
said.
"It is part of the whole
effort ... to get Americans out as
fast as their jobs can be handled
or the overall job can be handled
by the South Vietnamese," he
said.

LAPAZ, Mexico (AP)—The
United States has not, as
promised, eased its intensive
search for narcotics along the
U.S.-Mexican border, a Baja
California official told the
Commission of the Californias.
Ignacio Garcia Batista, director
of Baja California's economic and
industrial promotion, said
Saturday that U.S. customs
methods continue to hinder the
economies of border towns.
The federal government had
announced it was withdrawing its
Operation Intercept, a
multi-agency land, sea and air
attack on drug smuggling, on a
promise from Mexican officials
that they would lend a hand south
of the border in controlling
marijuana and drug production
and smuggling.
Batista said, that shorter
waiting lines now prevalent along
the border "are due primarily to
the considerable drop in tourist
activity, not to any speeding up of
inspections or easing of
procedures."
