# Finch Calls On Protest To Define Priorities
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare Robert H. Finch told
a Stanford audience Friday his
only criticism of the Vietnam
Moratorium was that leaders
"confined dialogue to the war
itself."
"It should have embraced the
whole spectrum of domestic
priorities," Finch suggested to a
peaceable crowd of 700 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
In an hour long appearance
sponsored by the Young
Republicans, Finch countered
students' questions with low-key
responses. He defended his
department's progress on school
integration, categorically denied
the existence of an HEW blacklist
of researchers, and said he will not
challenge incumbent Republican
George Murphy in the Senate
primary.
Finch's reaction to the
Moratorium stood in contrast to
icy and lukewarm responses
recorded by Vice-President Sprio
Agnew and Secretary of State
William Rogers.
"We as an administration had
no objection to the protest,"
Finch said. His daughter Maureen,
a sophomore at Occidental
College in Los Angeles, canvassed
door to door on Oct. 15.
School Integration
His explanation of the much
criticized pace of school
integration closely followed the
administration groove. "Just
cutting off funds hurts the very
people you're trying to help," he
asserted.
HEW has set terminal dates for
integration and worked with
school districts to achieve feasible
plans in several Southern states,
Finch said.
In Mississippi, freedom of
choice plans were judged
unacceptable in court only 16
days before schools were to open.
Finch claimed this and Hurricane
Camille made it "logistically
impossible" to integrate for this
year's opening.
Related Problems
The secretary acknowledged
problems related to school
integration. He voiced HEW's
concern about more than 100
black colleges, which are in "a
desperate state" because public
and private institutions lure away
their best students and faculty.
His department has also set up
a clearing house to place black
secondary school teachers laid off
when integration eliminated
all-black school systems.
"The North is dissatisfied that
we're not moving fast enough and
the South is demanding my
impeachment," he observed. "The
only people you have left (in my
position) are the fat ones, and we
lost them with cyclamates," Finch
added, drawing laughter and
applause.
Blacklisting
Finch said charges that HEW
blacklisted researchers for

political or personal reasons were
"absolutely untrue."
He has ordered that cases
involving denial of funds for
reasons other than competence be
brought directly to him.
Everyone who said he's on the
blacklist has at some time received
a grant from HEW, Finch claimed.
In a press conference before his
Stanford appearance, he explained
that the Civil Service commission
screens applicants for grants and
returns acceptable names to the
agency doing the hiring. He
speculated that rumors of a
blacklist developed when someone
was investigated by the Civil
Service, but did not receive a
contract.
Won't Run
Finch also told reporters he
was "enjoying his chores at
HEW." He said if Murphy were
not running he "would take a
look at the seat," but he was
supporting the incumbant
Republican Senator now.
The secretary reiterated
satisfaction with his job when
questioned about a
liberal-conservative split in the
cabinet. Finch said President
Nixon had followed his advice in
proposing new welfare measures
and in speaking out on
overpopulation.
"You win your battles and you
lose them," Finch observed.
"Those two things have given me
great satisfaction."
DDT, Clean Air
Finch took another major step
last week banning cyclamates, the
sweetener used in diet drinks.

HEW is also studying the effects
of monosodium glutonate and
DDT, and working for control of
air pollution. "By 1978 we should
be down to 1940 air—a relatively
clear period," Finch said.
Discussing the structure of
society, Finch agreed with a
student questioner that the
syndrome of a military-industrial
complex did exist.
Quasi-Incest
"There is a relationship
between the captains of industry
and many college presidents on
boards; there are close groups in
defense work and quasi-incest in
the health field. If you're part of
the club you do well, if not, you
don't. Of course this is an
oversimplification," he said.
In a brief speech before
questionning began, Finch told
students, "Making a bad world
better is tough, grinding,
never-ending work." Students too
often turn to the "Joshua effect,"
he said, by "getting a trumpet and
blasting away." He urged
translating rhetoric into action.
Finch said he is often troubled
by the uncertainty of the data on
which he makes decisions. Many
choices do not lend themselves to
systems analysis, a fact which
makes HEW "the most challenging
department in government," he
suggested.
Finch's primary purpose for
visiting the Bay Area was to
keynote a $100 a plate dinner
given by the Santa Clara County
Republican Central Committee.
The fund raiser was sold out
several weeks in advance.


ONE MAN ACT—Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Robert Finch
walked the tight rope of student criticism and inquiry last Friday in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. He called on Moratorium supporters to face the problems involved
in rectifying domestic inequities.
