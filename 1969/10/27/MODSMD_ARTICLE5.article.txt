# Radical Move Urged By Marcuse, Davis
## 
### 
Herbert Marcuse and his
former student Angela Davis both
attacked the University of
California Regents and
encouraged students to begin the
radical reordering of American
society on the college campus in
speeches Friday at the Berkeley
campus.
Marcuse spoke first to more
than 5,000 people crowded into
the lower Sproul Plaza area and
told the cheering audience "the
fight against these powers must go
on. They want to block your
mind and protect you from
controversial ideas."
The controversial philosophy
professor from UC San Diego
declared that America is "the
richest nation in the world living
off the world's poor, of death,
and off pollution." Marcuse
stated, "This capitalist society has
spent one trillon dollars in he last
twenty years on what it calls
national security."
The Marxist theorist is the
author of several influential books
on New Left thought including
"One Dimensional Man" and "an
Essay on Liberation."
Marcuse cited defense
contracts that many universities
hold and said "It is here that the
university trains America's
cadres."
Ideal Enemy
In introducing Angela Davis, a
former student of his, Marcuse
commented, "The regents picked
an ideal enemy: she is black,
militant, communist, very
intelligent, and she is pretty. This
is more than the system can
take."
With the introduction, the
25-year-old assistant professor of
philosophy at UCLA received a
standing ovation. She declared,
"Freedom to speak and to learn
are important when they're linked
to other freedoms.
Chemical-biological warfare

research and defense
contracts—these things are not
academic freedom."
The tall, light-skinned radical
added, "Academic freedom means
nothing without political ,
economic, or social freedom.
Referring to the regents, the
attractive, brown-haired teacher
added, "They're afraid and they
have every right to be afraid." She
pointed out that "There are no
blacks, no chicanos, and there are
only three women on the Board
of Regents."
"A lot of professors think they
have a monopoly on academic
freedom. Well, I think that
students ought to have a
monopoly on the issue."
Political Statements
Speaking before a capacity
crowd at Rossevelt Junior High
School in San Jose Friday night,
Miss Davis declared that she will
not keep her own political view
points out of her classroom
courses.
"No, I will not keep my
political opinions out of the
classroom when we have Facist
opinions in the classrooms
already," she said.
"I think we need to talk about
all political alternatives, not play a
game of indoctrination. Governor
Ronald Reagan and regents see
schools, though, as an
indoctrination."
Indoctrinated Already
According to Miss Davis,
schools have always been
"inherently political" and need to
be related to reality.
It is her thesis that many
radicals all over the country are
saying we need a complete change
before these "problems of
repression" can be solved.
She said that "socialism is the
framework to attack racism—and
eliminate the society that allows it
to exist."

nine-year old program attended the conference Friday and Saturday.
Herbert Marcuse and his
former student Angela Davis both
attacked the University of
California Regents and
encouraged students to begin the
radical reordering of American
society on the college campus in
speeches Friday at the Berkeley
campus.
Marcuse spoke first to more
than 5,000 people crowded into
the lower Sproul Plaza area and
told the cheering audience "the
fight against these powers must go
on. They want to block your
mind and protect you from
controversial ideas."
The controversial philosophy
professor from UC San Diego
declared that America is "the
richest nation in the world living
off the world's poor, of death,
and off pollution." Marcuse
stated, "This capitalist society has
spent one trillon dollars in he last
twenty years on what it calls
national security."
The Marxist theorist is the
author of several influential books
on New Left thought including
"One Dimensional Man" and "an
Essay on Liberation."
Marcuse cited defense
contracts that many universities
hold and said "It is here that the
university trains America's
cadres."
Ideal Enemy
In introducing Angela Davis, a
former student of his, Marcuse
commented, "The regents picked
an ideal enemy: she is black,
militant, communist, very
intelligent, and she is pretty. This
is more than the system can
take."
With the introduction, the
25-year-old assistant professor of
philosophy at UCLA received a
standing ovation. She declared,
"Freedom to speak and to learn
are important when they're linked
to other freedoms.
Chemical-biological warfare

research and defense
contracts—these things are not
academic freedom."
The tall, light-skinned radical
added, "Academic freedom means
nothing without political ,
economic, or social freedom.
Referring to the regents, the
attractive, brown-haired teacher
added, "They're afraid and they
have every right to be afraid." She
pointed out that "There are no
blacks, no chicanos, and there are
only three women on the Board
of Regents."
"A lot of professors think they
have a monopoly on academic
freedom. Well, I think that
students ought to have a
monopoly on the issue."
Political Statements
Speaking before a capacity
crowd at Rossevelt Junior High
School in San Jose Friday night,
Miss Davis declared that she will
not keep her own political view
points out of her classroom
courses.
"No, I will not keep my
political opinions out of the
classroom when we have Facist
opinions in the classrooms
already," she said.
"I think we need to talk about
all political alternatives, not play a
game of indoctrination. Governor
Ronald Reagan and regents see
schools, though, as an
indoctrination."
Indoctrinated Already
According to Miss Davis,
schools have always been
"inherently political" and need to
be related to reality.
It is her thesis that many
radicals all over the country are
saying we need a complete change
before these "problems of
repression" can be solved.
She said that "socialism is the
framework to attack racism—and
eliminate the society that allows it
to exist."
