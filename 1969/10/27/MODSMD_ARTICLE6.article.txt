## In Matt's Defense 
### 
Over the past week or two we
have read some interesting attacks
against Matt Wolf. Such notable
amateur psychiatrists as Maas,
Austin, and Basset (or is that
"Passet"?) have done him he favor
of telling him that he is a misfit,
and have offered as therapy a
mixture of ire and false pity. I
find it amusing that 1) all are
women, and 2) of our three
illustrious analysts, only one of
them has been personally
acquainted with the cad whom
they condemn with such
vehemence.
It did not occur to them that
1) Matt, rather than being a
recluse, is bold to the extent that
he is often obnoxious, and 2) that
he was putting into words what a
good many of us hapless freshman
males really think, but lack the
guts to say openly.
Richard Wright, in Native Son,
observed that one always hates
someone who makes him feel
ashamed. In that all his attackers
are females, it appears obvious to
me that Herr Wolf has struck a
sensitive nerve in some of his
readers, has inserted an irritating
grain of truth inside the plastic
oyster.
Matt was a bit unfair in his
overgeneralization, but his
observations hold true for a large
group of manikins. He is worthy
of laud for his courage, not
perdition.

Urban Diseases
During my three years as a
graduate student at Stanford I've
probably heard as well as
reaffirmed every gripe concerning
such things as the ratio, the
indifference of Stanford women
toward men, and the lack of
places to meet people. There is
much truth in these complaints,
but they fail to indicate
Stanford's more serious social
problems.
By some unknown mechanism,
our little community of 12,000
has acquired ills which are usually
reserved for only the largest of
cities.
I have sat in Tresidder on many
an afternoon and watched sad
people sitting alone. Not just
alone, but seated as far away as
possible from other people. As
they consume their purchase, they
look in greater detail at the people
they chose not to sit too near to.
Oh! don't worry, its allright to
look, but just remember that if
the person you're watching sees
you, then you must turn away,
because its very awkard and
perhaps even dangerous to be
looking at a stranger the same
time he looks at you. Oh! maybe
its not so dangerous, but why take
chances. Anyway its very
awkward—rude even. What am I
doing thinking about talking to
that character? Probably a really
dull person. Any way I came here
for a hamburger and not to meet
people. Almost 2:3o—better go
get some work done.
So it goes day after day, a
thousand times a day.
Incidentally, I'm sorry if I was
staring at you today in Tresidder.
I was actually thinking of coming
over and joining you but . . .
It will take a conscious effort
by many of us to rid our campus
of this sickness and the burden of
responsibility falls upon those of
us who feel the pain. From the
others we may ask only for
tolerance.

Dollies, Studs & Toilet Seats
"Plastic dollies." "Studs."
"People . . .lacquered and
preserved for antiquity." Do any
of these things actually exist at
Stanford? Of course not, but
some people seem to try their best
to make these labels become
reality. Obviously, Matt Wolf's
article concerning the plasticity of
this university was exaggerated
and overdone—what good satire
isn't? Anyone who would take

very word of a satire such as his
literally would be a moron. But
the realities behind the
exaggerations are the extremely
sad, but unfortunately true facts
which give the article its strength.
Although everyone hates to
admit it, there is a good deal of
phoniness and lack of true
emotional compassion for fellow
men (and women) at Stanford. No
one here is a truly humane and
understanding individual at all
times—this is an impossibility. But
it seems as if most people don't
really even make honest efforts to
be kind and sympathetic human
beings here. Everyone is too
wrapped up in "doing his or her
own thing" to care about other
people as well. I'll be the first to
admit that I too am guilty of not
caring enough about other people.
I also realize that in the short time
I have been here at this university,
I have not met everyone there is
to meet. But I am attempting to
consciously improve my lack of
understanding and compassion for
others.
I think that Matt was trying to
say just that in his article
(although his writing style
happens to be quite a bit more
biting and dramatic than mine).
But regardless of what Matt
wanted to say, here is what I
would like to say to the students
of Stanford University: We should
all attempt to care more about
each other—for it we don't try to
improve ourselves now, this
university may develop into the
"platinum plated, diamond
studded, silk shrouded, plastic
protrusion" with "the colossal
sensitivity of a toilet seat"
described by Matt Wolf.
