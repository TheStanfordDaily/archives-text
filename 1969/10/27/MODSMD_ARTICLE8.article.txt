## Wolf: Zenith Of Irrationality? 
### 
Dear Matt:
H'warya? Inundated with
replies to your mini-tirade? Well, I
can sympathize. Y'see, I'm new
here too, and I have met the same
enthusiastic hospitalities you
speak of—but I'm not upset. I'm
not goint ot make the mistake
you've made—charging that the
Stanford institution is at fault,
with its 2.1:1 ratio and platinum
sealed isolation. Come now,
Matt—why should this institution
be any more antisocial than any
other? You claim you had honest
relationships at home—tell me,
what was your first day in high
school like? Did strange people
fall all over friendly, lovable you?
Or was there a slow but honest
interrevelation as you got to know
each other? Didn't it last longer
than ten days? Didn't it, in fact,
last-throughout the three or four
years you spent in high school?
Didn't it take this long for those
"familiar surroundings" to
become familiar. Why should
college be any different? Perhaps
you can see why your article
bothers me—you dare, after a
mere ten days, to charge Leland
Stanford Jr. with being the ghost
of an unfriendly institution.
The problem, lonely heart, is
not a problem at all—it's called
"human nature", and it's a
perfectly normal interaction of
people strange to each other. I
don't fall all over every new
person I meet, but I'd like to get
to know him. What's a good
introduction—instead of "hi" or
"hello" should I say "I'd like to
greet you warmly but I'm not sure
you are yet worthy of an honest
relationship with me so state your
qualifications as 'friend' material
and let me decided how to react
to you"? I think "hi" is easier.
And if someone says it to me, sure
it may be insincere, but time will
tell me who means it and who
doesn't, and then I can begin to
develop "honest relationships".
And the "dollies"—one third of
a column's worth of inanimate
polyethylene playmates, right,
Matt? This, I'm afraid, is the
zenith of your irrationality. You
don't deal with he Stanford
women as women, but as plastic

people. Fact: anyone can liken a
set of people to a substance, and
then describe them by listing the
eature of the substance. More
Important Fact: This is illogical:
besides, it's one hell of a dirty
trick. I'm tempted to call you
nitro-glycerin and say that you
must be handled delicately or you
react violently. By your standards
this analogy is perfectly OK. You
may discount it, though, by he
M.I.F. I have stated above. And I
will apologize for having tried to
de-humanize you. Will you do the
same toward Stanford women?
You admit that you have
reacted just on first impressions.
Are you after the annual Spiro T.
Agnew Award for Irresponsible
Journalism? Ah, but I have faith
in you, Matt. You're a sensitive
person, and therefore valuable as a
journalist. But please, don't let
yourself get carried away, or the
rest of us may decide that you are
not good friend material, and
you'll suffer a miserable four
years.

article so we can all write in more
indignant rebuttals? What a

Just to clarify one point of
word useage in the "Stanford
Plastic Woman" feud: tradition
holds it that a Stanford Dolly
does not officially become a
Stanford Woman until she is
kissed under Memorial Arch at
midnight of full moon by a

Graduate Dollies
Editor, THE DAILY:
May I speak for graduate
dollies? There are many warm
attractive female graduate
students at Stanford who are
eager to give and would like to be
watched out for by strong and
understanding fellows. They are
often lonely and frustrated
because the men do not seem to
take an interest or, when interest

is there, do not take the initiative
and pursue. Sometimes it is
tempting to conclude bitterly that
Stanford men are spineless, but
surely the situation is not so final.
More likely, many Stanford men
are as why as Stanford women
and, distracted by academic
concerns and short on time, are
less inclined to step out of pace
long enough to seek out new
people, or to speak to that
pleasant-looking stranger over
there who caught their eye.
For graduates Stanford seems
limited when it comes to sociable
things to do, or places to go on
campus where they may meet
each other beyond their
departments. It is hard to know
what to do about it. But they do
walk past each other every day on
their way somewhere. Perhaps the
answer is to remain open and
aware, look at one another and
even stop each other in passing,
seek out new faces and talk to
new people chanced upon during
the day, nd forget fears of getting
bitten, at least long enough to try
freedom.
Be venturesome, hazard a
smile, remember, that he or she is
probably preoccupied and hence
startled rather than hostile, and if
you get bitten, shrug it off and try
again. A lot of people do not
mean to bite. It is a shame to
withhold that lace smile from the
many because one beclouded
countenance did not respond.

It's easy to say that Stanford
girls are plastic. It's easy to say
that half the time they think
they're so good that they won't
even talk to you,and when they do
break down and talk, they won't
let you see what they're really
like, they won't let you see their
honest feelings and reactions;
instead they put on an act and
you never really get to know them
because there's such a big pile of
bullshit you're got to wade
through.

It's also easy to sit back and
tell everyone that the reason you
can't become real friends with any
girls around here is that they're
plastic. But its not so easy to ask
yourself why they all seem so
plastic.
It's not so easy to see that
Stanford females are simply
reacting to Stanford males—males
who decide that they've really got
to impress some chicks if they
want to have any fun around here;
males who go on the prowl,
knocking on doors, deciding to
wear the cool, mature man mask
this time, or the comedian suit, or
play the role of the big stud who
has to keep his distance lest
anymore women fall in love with
him.
It's not so easy to see that if a
girl is confronted with a plastic
guy its very hard for her to be
honest and open with him about
herself—it's much more natural
for her to either keep quiet until
the guy gets tired of his one man
show and leaves, or for her to pliy
along, keeping everything on a
false, "let's impress each other"
level.
Alright, not every Stanford guy
is all that bad, but then not every
Stantord guy goes on the prowl.
Enough of them do, though
(especially freshmen like myself),
that pretty soon the Stanford girls
start to get an image in their heads
of Stanford guys, and they
automatically start reacting to that
image when they see a guy. Then
we call them plastic and decide we
don't like the school.

Dear Matt:
H'warya? Inundated with
replies to your mini-tirade? Well, I
can sympathize. Y'see, I'm new
here too, and I have met the same
enthusiastic hospitalities you
speak of—but I'm not upset. I'm
not goint ot make the mistake
you've made—charging that the
Stanford institution is at fault,
with its 2.1:1 ratio and platinum
sealed isolation. Come now,
Matt—why should this institution
be any more antisocial than any
other? You claim you had honest
relationships at home—tell me,
what was your first day in high
school like? Did strange people
fall all over friendly, lovable you?
Or was there a slow but honest
interrevelation as you got to know
each other? Didn't it last longer
than ten days? Didn't it, in fact,
last-throughout the three or four
years you spent in high school?
Didn't it take this long for those
"familiar surroundings" to
become familiar. Why should
college be any different? Perhaps
you can see why your article
bothers me—you dare, after a
mere ten days, to charge Leland
Stanford Jr. with being the ghost
of an unfriendly institution.
The problem, lonely heart, is
not a problem at all—it's called
"human nature", and it's a
perfectly normal interaction of
people strange to each other. I
don't fall all over every new
person I meet, but I'd like to get
to know him. What's a good
introduction—instead of "hi" or
"hello" should I say "I'd like to
greet you warmly but I'm not sure
you are yet worthy of an honest
relationship with me so state your
qualifications as 'friend' material
and let me decided how to react
to you"? I think "hi" is easier.
And if someone says it to me, sure
it may be insincere, but time will
tell me who means it and who
doesn't, and then I can begin to
develop "honest relationships".
And the "dollies"—one third of
a column's worth of inanimate
polyethylene playmates, right,
Matt? This, I'm afraid, is the
zenith of your irrationality. You
don't deal with he Stanford
women as women, but as plastic

people. Fact: anyone can liken a
set of people to a substance, and
then describe them by listing the
eature of the substance. More
Important Fact: This is illogical:
besides, it's one hell of a dirty
trick. I'm tempted to call you
nitro-glycerin and say that you
must be handled delicately or you
react violently. By your standards
this analogy is perfectly OK. You
may discount it, though, by he
M.I.F. I have stated above. And I
will apologize for having tried to
de-humanize you. Will you do the
same toward Stanford women?
You admit that you have
reacted just on first impressions.
Are you after the annual Spiro T.
Agnew Award for Irresponsible
Journalism? Ah, but I have faith
in you, Matt. You're a sensitive
person, and therefore valuable as a
journalist. But please, don't let
yourself get carried away, or the
rest of us may decide that you are
not good friend material, and

Graduate Dollies
Editor, THE DAILY:
May I speak for graduate
dollies? There are many warm
attractive female graduate
students at Stanford who are
eager to give and would like to be
watched out for by strong and
understanding fellows. They are
often lonely and frustrated
because the men do not seem to
take an interest or, when interest

is there, do not take the initiative
and pursue. Sometimes it is
tempting to conclude bitterly that
Stanford men are spineless, but
surely the situation is not so final.
More likely, many Stanford men
are as why as Stanford women
and, distracted by academic
concerns and short on time, are
less inclined to step out of pace
long enough to seek out new
people, or to speak to that
pleasant-looking stranger over
there who caught their eye.
For graduates Stanford seems
limited when it comes to sociable
things to do, or places to go on
campus where they may meet
each other beyond their
departments. It is hard to know
what to do about it. But they do
walk past each other every day on
their way somewhere. Perhaps the
answer is to remain open and
aware, look at one another and
even stop each other in passing,
seek out new faces and talk to
new people chanced upon during
the day, nd forget fears of getting
bitten, at least long enough to try
freedom.
Be venturesome, hazard a
smile, remember, that he or she is
probably preoccupied and hence
startled rather than hostile, and if
you get bitten, shrug it off and try
again. A lot of people do not
mean to bite. It is a shame to
withhold that lace smile from the
many because one beclouded
countenance did not respond.

Editor, THE I) AILY:
It's easy to say that Stanford
girls are plastic. It's easy to say
that half the time they think
they're so good that they won't
even talk to you,and when they do
break down and talk, they won't
let you see what they're really
like, they won't let you see their
honest feelings and reactions;
instead they put on an act and
you never really get to know them
because there's such a big pile of
bullshit you're got to wade
through.

It's also easy to sit back and
tell everyone that the reason you
can't become real friends with any
girls around here is that they're
plastic. But its not so easy to ask
yourself why they all seem so
plastic.
It's not so easy to see that
Stanford females are simply
reacting to Stanford males—males
who decide that they've really got
to impress some chicks if they
want to have any fun around here;
males who go on the prowl,
knocking on doors, deciding to
wear the cool, mature man mask
this time, or the comedian suit, or
play the role of the big stud who
has to keep his distance lest
anymore women fall in love with
him.
It's not so easy to see that if a
girl is confronted with a plastic
guy its very hard for her to be
honest and open with him about
herself—it's much more natural
for her to either keep quiet until
the guy gets tired of his one man
show and leaves, or for her to pliy
along, keeping everything on a
false, "let's impress each other"
level.
Alright, not every Stanford guy
is all that bad, but then not every
Stantord guy goes on the prowl.
Enough of them do, though
(especially freshmen like myself),
that pretty soon the Stanford girls
start to get an image in their heads
of Stanford guys, and they
automatically start reacting to that
image when they see a guy. Then

It's not so easy to see that if a
girl is confronted with a plastic
guy its very hard for her to be
honest and open with him about
herself—it's much more natural
for her to either keep quiet until
the guy gets tired of his one man
show and leaves, or for her to pliy
along, keeping everything on a
false, "let's impress each other"
level.
Alright, not every Stanford guy
is all that bad, but then not every
Stantord guy goes on the prowl.
Enough of them do, though
(especially freshmen like myself),
that pretty soon the Stanford girls

Dear Matt:
H'warya? Inundated with
replies to your mini-tirade? Well, I
can sympathize. Y'see, I'm new
here too, and I have met the same
enthusiastic hospitalities you
speak of—but I'm not upset. I'm
not goint ot make the mistake
you've made—charging that the
Stanford institution is at fault,
with its 2.1:1 ratio and platinum
sealed isolation. Come now,
Matt—why should this institution
be any more antisocial than any
other? You claim you had honest
relationships at home—tell me,
what was your first day in high
school like? Did strange people
fall all over friendly, lovable you?
Or was there a slow but honest
interrevelation as you got to know
each other? Didn't it last longer
than ten days? Didn't it, in fact,
last-throughout the three or four
years you spent in high school?
Didn't it take this long for those
"familiar surroundings" to
become familiar. Why should
college be any different? Perhaps
you can see why your article
bothers me—you dare, after a
mere ten days, to charge Leland
Stanford Jr. with being the ghost
of an unfriendly institution.
The problem, lonely heart, is
not a problem at all—it's called
"human nature", and it's a
perfectly normal interaction of
people strange to each other. I
don't fall all over every new
person I meet, but I'd like to get
to know him. What's a good
introduction—instead of "hi" or
"hello" should I say "I'd like to
greet you warmly but I'm not sure
you are yet worthy of an honest
relationship with me so state your
qualifications as 'friend' material
and let me decided how to react
to you"? I think "hi" is easier.
And if someone says it to me, sure
it may be insincere, but time will
tell me who means it and who
doesn't, and then I can begin to
develop "honest relationships".
And the "dollies"—one third of
a column's worth of inanimate
polyethylene playmates, right,
Matt? This, I'm afraid, is the
zenith of your irrationality. You
don't deal with he Stanford
women as women, but as plastic

people. Fact: anyone can liken a
set of people to a substance, and
then describe them by listing the
eature of the substance. More
Important Fact: This is illogical:
besides, it's one hell of a dirty
trick. I'm tempted to call you
nitro-glycerin and say that you
must be handled delicately or you
react violently. By your standards
this analogy is perfectly OK. You
may discount it, though, by he
M.I.F. I have stated above. And I
will apologize for having tried to
de-humanize you. Will you do the
same toward Stanford women?
You admit that you have
reacted just on first impressions.
Are you after the annual Spiro T.
Agnew Award for Irresponsible
Journalism? Ah, but I have faith
in you, Matt. You're a sensitive

Graduate Dollies
Editor, THE DAILY:
May I speak for graduate
dollies? There are many warm
attractive female graduate
students at Stanford who are
eager to give and would like to be
watched out for by strong and
understanding fellows. They are
often lonely and frustrated
because the men do not seem to
take an interest or, when interest

is there, do not take the initiative
and pursue. Sometimes it is
tempting to conclude bitterly that
Stanford men are spineless, but
surely the situation is not so final.
More likely, many Stanford men
are as why as Stanford women
and, distracted by academic
concerns and short on time, are
less inclined to step out of pace
long enough to seek out new
people, or to speak to that
pleasant-looking stranger over
there who caught their eye.
For graduates Stanford seems
limited when it comes to sociable
things to do, or places to go on
campus where they may meet
each other beyond their
departments. It is hard to know
what to do about it. But they do
walk past each other every day on
their way somewhere. Perhaps the
answer is to remain open and
aware, look at one another and
even stop each other in passing,
seek out new faces and talk to
new people chanced upon during
the day, nd forget fears of getting
bitten, at least long enough to try
freedom.
Be venturesome, hazard a
smile, remember, that he or she is
probably preoccupied and hence
startled rather than hostile, and if
you get bitten, shrug it off and try
again. A lot of people do not
mean to bite. It is a shame to
withhold that lace smile from the
many because one beclouded
countenance did not respond.

that half the time they think
they're so good that they won't

break down and talk, they won't
let you see what they're really

you never really get to know them

It's also easy to sit back and

can't become real friends with any

plastic. But its not so easy to ask
yourself why they all seem so
plastic.
It's not so easy to see that
Stanford females are simply
reacting to Stanford males—males
who decide that they've really got
to impress some chicks if they
want to have any fun around here;
males who go on the prowl,
knocking on doors, deciding to

plastic. But its not so easy to ask
yourself why they all seem so
plastic.
It's not so easy to see that
Stanford females are simply
reacting to Stanford males—males
who decide that they've really got
to impress some chicks if they
want to have any fun around here;
males who go on the prowl,
knocking on doors, deciding to
wear the cool, mature man mask
this time, or the comedian suit, or
play the role of the big stud who
has to keep his distance lest
anymore women fall in love with
him.
It's not so easy to see that if a
girl is confronted with a plastic
guy its very hard for her to be
honest and open with him about
herself—it's much more natural
for her to either keep quiet until
the guy gets tired of his one man
show and leaves, or for her to pliy
along, keeping everything on a
false, "let's impress each other"
level.
Alright, not every Stanford guy
is all that bad, but then not every
Stantord guy goes on the prowl.
Enough of them do, though
(especially freshmen like myself),
that pretty soon the Stanford girls
start to get an image in their heads
of Stanford guys, and they
automatically start reacting to that
image when they see a guy. Then
we call them plastic and decide we
don't like the school.

Dear Matt:
H'warya? Inundated with
replies to your mini-tirade? Well, I
can sympathize. Y'see, I'm new
here too, and I have met the same
enthusiastic hospitalities you
speak of—but I'm not upset. I'm
not goint ot make the mistake
you've made—charging that the
Stanford institution is at fault,
with its 2.1:1 ratio and platinum
sealed isolation. Come now,
Matt—why should this institution
be any more antisocial than any
other? You claim you had honest
relationships at home—tell me,
what was your first day in high
school like? Did strange people
fall all over friendly, lovable you?
Or was there a slow but honest
interrevelation as you got to know
each other? Didn't it last longer
than ten days? Didn't it, in fact,
last-throughout the three or four
years you spent in high school?
Didn't it take this long for those
"familiar surroundings" to
become familiar. Why should
college be any different? Perhaps
you can see why your article
bothers me—you dare, after a
mere ten days, to charge Leland
Stanford Jr. with being the ghost
of an unfriendly institution.
The problem, lonely heart, is
not a problem at all—it's called
"human nature", and it's a
perfectly normal interaction of
people strange to each other. I
don't fall all over every new
person I meet, but I'd like to get
to know him. What's a good
introduction—instead of "hi" or
"hello" should I say "I'd like to
greet you warmly but I'm not sure
you are yet worthy of an honest
relationship with me so state your
qualifications as 'friend' material
and let me decided how to react
to you"? I think "hi" is easier.
And if someone says it to me, sure
it may be insincere, but time will
tell me who means it and who
doesn't, and then I can begin to
develop "honest relationships".
And the "dollies"—one third of
a column's worth of inanimate
polyethylene playmates, right,
Matt? This, I'm afraid, is the
zenith of your irrationality. You
don't deal with he Stanford
women as women, but as plastic

people. Fact: anyone can liken a
set of people to a substance, and
then describe them by listing the
eature of the substance. More
Important Fact: This is illogical:
besides, it's one hell of a dirty
trick. I'm tempted to call you
nitro-glycerin and say that you
must be handled delicately or you
react violently. By your standards
this analogy is perfectly OK. You
may discount it, though, by he
M.I.F. I have stated above. And I
will apologize for having tried to
de-humanize you. Will you do the
same toward Stanford women?
You admit that you have
reacted just on first impressions.
Are you after the annual Spiro T.
Agnew Award for Irresponsible
Journalism? Ah, but I have faith
in you, Matt. You're a sensitive
person, and therefore valuable as a
journalist. But please, don't let
yourself get carried away, or the
rest of us may decide that you are
not good friend material, and
you'll suffer a miserable four
years.

Graduate Dollies
Editor, THE DAILY:
May I speak for graduate
dollies? There are many warm
attractive female graduate
students at Stanford who are
eager to give and would like to be
watched out for by strong and
understanding fellows. They are
often lonely and frustrated
because the men do not seem to
take an interest or, when interest

is there, do not take the initiative
and pursue. Sometimes it is
tempting to conclude bitterly that
Stanford men are spineless, but
surely the situation is not so final.
More likely, many Stanford men
are as why as Stanford women
and, distracted by academic
concerns and short on time, are
less inclined to step out of pace
long enough to seek out new
people, or to speak to that
pleasant-looking stranger over
there who caught their eye.
For graduates Stanford seems
limited when it comes to sociable
things to do, or places to go on
campus where they may meet
each other beyond their
departments. It is hard to know
what to do about it. But they do
walk past each other every day on
their way somewhere. Perhaps the
answer is to remain open and
aware, look at one another and
even stop each other in passing,
seek out new faces and talk to
new people chanced upon during
the day, nd forget fears of getting
bitten, at least long enough to try
freedom.
Be venturesome, hazard a
smile, remember, that he or she is
probably preoccupied and hence
startled rather than hostile, and if
you get bitten, shrug it off and try
again. A lot of people do not
mean to bite. It is a shame to
withhold that lace smile from the
many because one beclouded
countenance did not respond.

It's easy to say that Stanford

instead they put on an act and
you never really get to know them
