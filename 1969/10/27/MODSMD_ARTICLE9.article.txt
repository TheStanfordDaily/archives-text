## Dolly Operatics 
### Andy Israel 
If HAIR and other modern
musicals can deal with modern
social issues, why not an opera
concerning the matter of the
Stanford Dolly? Dolly Follies is
such a story ....
ACT I
As the curtain goes up, a group
of dorm men living in one of the
various co-ed complexes on the
Stanford campus are sitting in the
lobby of their dorm drinking milk
and talking with the girl they all
love—Dolly Leland. Their
dilemma is expressed in song as
their voices join in the opening
aria—"i'VE BEEN WORKING ON
A DOLLY."
"I've been working on a
dolly—following her upstairs,
I've been working on a dolly—but
I don't think she cares;
When I pass her on the sidewalk, I
always smile and shout:
Hey there tell me Stanford
dolly—can I take you out?
chorus:
Dolly won't you go, dolly won't
you go, see what fun thai it can
be-e-e.
Dolly won't you go, dolly won't
you go, won 'tcha go to bed with
me?
Dolly sings:
Men you know that I would love
to but I'm booked through
'73-e-e-e
If I knew that it was this bad,
would have gone to U.S.C.
The crowd clears and a lone
figure is left alone. Freshman Matt
Wolf soliloquizes his frustration
over not being able to penetrate
the plastic shell which Dolly has
formed around herself. There is
only one way he can let his pent
up carnal frustrations out . . .he
goes to his room . . .locks the
door . . .draws the blind . . .and
the act closes--with Matt starting
to sing softly to himself.
ACT II:
The curtain rises with the
opening chords of Matt's

lamenting ana, coincidentally
sounding very much like Dylan's
RAINY DAY WOMEN.
Oh, she 11 say no when you have
her in your car,
and she'll say no when you take
her to a bar,
she'll say no if you try to get too
near,
and if you don't try she'll think
that you are queer.
Well I'll tell you friend it has to be
a folly—
to try to matte time with a
Stanford Dolly.
The curtain falls on a gently
cobbing Matt —it doesn't hurt him.
ACT III:
Dolly has crept into the
hallway outside Matt's room and
has overheard his song. Tears fill
her eyes and the plastic insulation
that has so long been part of her
personality is dramatically
shattered and she croons: I
THINK I'VE HAD A
REVELATION.
I think I've had a REVELATION
-oh yeah-1 know-o-o I think
I've seen the light (shoobee
doowah, a oh shoobee doowah)
I understand your frustration-og
yeah-and now-ow-ow
I want to help you with your
fight, yeah
I see the torture you've been
forced to sta-a-and
So let me help you frosh, now
take my hand.
Don't you know it's going to
be-e-e/all right
I'll go out with you/Friday night
All the things that we can do/all
night
bum-bum bum-bum-bum
bum-bum bum-bum-bum
Dolly's aria ends and Matt and
Dolly rush together with a
passionate handshake and a fiery
"howarya." They h.we seen he
light and walk hand in hand into
the shadow of Hoover Tower on
their way to the WLF meeting . . .

ACT II:
The curtain rises with the
opening chords of Matt's

lamenting ana, coincidentally
sounding very much like Dylan's
RAINY DAY WOMEN.
Oh, she 11 say no when you have
her in your car,
and she'll say no when you take
her to a bar,
she'll say no if you try to get too
near,
and if you don't try she'll think
that you are queer.
Well I'll tell you friend it has to be
a folly—
to try to matte time with a
Stanford Dolly.
The curtain falls on a gently
cobbing Matt —it doesn't hurt him.
ACT III:
Dolly has crept into the
hallway outside Matt's room and
has overheard his song. Tears fill
her eyes and the plastic insulation
that has so long been part of her
personality is dramatically
shattered and she croons: I
THINK I'VE HAD A
REVELATION.
I think I've had a REVELATION
-oh yeah-1 know-o-o I think
I've seen the light (shoobee
doowah, a oh shoobee doowah)
I understand your frustration-og
yeah-and now-ow-ow
I want to help you with your
fight, yeah
I see the torture you've been
forced to sta-a-and
So let me help you frosh, now
take my hand.
Don't you know it's going to
be-e-e/all right
I'll go out with you/Friday night
All the things that we can do/all
night
bum-bum bum-bum-bum
bum-bum bum-bum-bum
Dolly's aria ends and Matt and
Dolly rush together with a
passionate handshake and a fiery
"howarya." They h.we seen he
light and walk hand in hand into
the shadow of Hoover Tower on
their way to the WLF meeting . . .
(Andy Israel is a freshman)
If HAIR and other modern
musicals can deal with modern
social issues, why not an opera
concerning the matter of the
Stanford Dolly? Dolly Follies is
such a story ....
ACT I
As the curtain goes up, a group
of dorm men living in one of the
various co-ed complexes on the
Stanford campus are sitting in the
lobby of their dorm drinking milk
and talking with the girl they all
love—Dolly Leland. Their
dilemma is expressed in song as
their voices join in the opening
aria—"i'VE BEEN WORKING ON
A DOLLY."
"I've been working on a
dolly—following her upstairs,
I've been working on a dolly—but
I don't think she cares;
When I pass her on the sidewalk, I
always smile and shout:
Hey there tell me Stanford
dolly—can I take you out?
chorus:
Dolly won't you go, dolly won't
you go, see what fun thai it can
be-e-e.
Dolly won't you go, dolly won't
you go, won 'tcha go to bed with
me?
Dolly sings:
Men you know that I would love
to but I'm booked through
'73-e-e-e
If I knew that it was this bad,
would have gone to U.S.C.
The crowd clears and a lone
figure is left alone. Freshman Matt
Wolf soliloquizes his frustration
over not being able to penetrate
the plastic shell which Dolly has
formed around herself. There is
only one way he can let his pent
up carnal frustrations out . . .he
goes to his room . . .locks the
door . . .draws the blind . . .and
the act closes--with Matt starting
to sing softly to himself.
