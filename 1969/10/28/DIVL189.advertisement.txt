ENGINEERS
COME GROW WITH US
WE ARE:
• A rapidly expanding division of one of America's
fastest growing company in the health care in
dustry.
• A multi-plant operation with over 400 plastic,
glass, metal and liquid items in our largely dis
posable product line.
• Big enough to be exciting, but small enough to
recognize the individual you're a name, not just
a number.
Our engineers and scientists re growing because they
are experiencing satisfaction derived from making sig
nificant contributions in the challenging field of med
cal and health care products.
If this makes sense to you, you are the person to grow
with us. Check us out to learn more about our products,
our plans and our opportunities. It could be more most
important phase of your career.
