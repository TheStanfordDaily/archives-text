# Stolen Encina Files Reveal Faculty, Administration Pay
## 
### 
Some of Stanford's most
sensitive and highly guarded
secrets—faculty and staff
salaries—were blown open
yesterday with the surprise
underground publication of
detailed payment figures for
1968-69.
Distribution of the figures,
stolen during last May's Encina
sit-in, is the most extensive and
potentially explosive revelation
of internal University workings in
Stanford's history.

The 31-page mimeographed
document, randomly and sparsely
circulated on campus yesterday,
delineates most faculty and
administration salaries, running
from $60,000 a year for the
president to $7000 for visiting
lecturers.
The document shows disparate
payment scales from department
to department, with larger salaries
found in the sciences and the
Medical School.
L) epartm en 1 Evaluations
The detailed report also
ontained evaluations by five
department heads of their faculty
members.
The Daily obtained a copy of
the confidential file from among a
pile of about 25 left yesterday
morning outside the campus post
office. The same amount were left
at History Corner. Thus far, there
have been no other reports of
copies distributed on campus.
The mimeographed sheets are
signed only by the "Underground
Press, Stanford, Ca." It closes
with a quotation from Mao.
No Comment from Pitzer
President Kenneth Pitzer last
night declined to comment on the
appearance of the secret listings.
Other administration sources
indicated that officials have no

leads on the Encina purloiners.
Provost Richard Lyman
defended the salary differentials
evident between several of the
university's schools. "The
differences between salaries in the
humanities and sciences are
perceptible, but they are not wide
ones."
Interspersed Comm en Is
The authors of the
mimeographed salary data
interspersed the administration
salary listings with quotations of
salaries of non-academic
personnel. The document also
listed outside agencies which
contributed to individual's pay.
Although The Daily, upon
advice of legal counsel, decided
not to print names and salaries of
individual professors, one
significant observation gleaned
from the report was the
consistently higher salaries
afforded professors lured away
from other institutions.
In addition, assistant professors
in several departments receive
higher salaries than the lowest
paid full professors in their
department.
Small Differences
Also striking were the small
differences between salaries paid
to assistant professors and

associate professors. In several
instances, associate professor pay
was only several hundred dollars
above assistant professors'
stipends.
Professors in he graduate
schools of law, business, and
medicine received generally higher
salaries than undergraduate
professors.
Most of these salaries were in
the $20,000 range, with salaries
listed for selective members of the
medical school all exceeding
$30,000.
Several administrators
indicated that the faculty
evaluation data was not in Encina
at the time of the sit-in. All the
memoranda were addressed to
Lincoln Moses, then associate
dean of humanities and sciences.
Dean Moses was not available last
night for comment on whether or
how the five evaluation sheets
were pilfered.
One long-lived student
complaint—that professors are
judged by their research rather
than teaching performance—was
given compelling support by
political science department
figures.
The political science
department has long embroiled in
a bitter fight over various
approaches to he discipline.
Disclosure of the salary
differentials could add flames to
the smoldering feud.
For example, two full
professors noted for their
undergraduate teaching receive
$10,000 less per year than
professors better known for their
research activities.

Salary Raise
About one professor the
department head wrote in 1967,
"I am recommending that his
salary be raised to $20,000 a year.
This represents an increase of
$2,5000 . . .It has been quite
evident as (his) career has
developed that he is among the
most original and productive
scholars in political science, on a
national and international scale."
He then details the various offers
the professor has received from
other universities.
Speaking about a
non-behavioural ist who receives
only $14,000: "He has been
advanced and promoted in the
department principally on the
basis of a credible teaching record
and participation in Department
administration and committee
activities. His only book was a
revision of his doctoral
dissertation. In my report last
year I referred to the fact that (his
book) has been very favorably
received and represented a
contribution to he literature.
"Since that time he has
produced two book reviews. He
has a book in progress. In the last
year or two his contribution to
the department has somewhat
declined. Again I am reluctant to
recommend no raise in his case if
only because the cost of living has
undoubtedly increased not to
receive a raise means a genuine
drop in income. But again, the
scarcity of resources and the more
impressive record of
accomplishment of his colleagues
make such decision unavoidable."
