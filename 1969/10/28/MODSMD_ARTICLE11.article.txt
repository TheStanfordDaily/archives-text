# Thumb Sucking
## An Elementary Smear 
### Chris Hocker 
The October 24 edition of the
Daily provided on its third page
what must be regarded as a gross
exercise in journalistic
thumb-sucking on the part of one
Jim Spickard.
In his article, Spickard, in the
guise of a warning against
right-wing groups in general and
the YAF in particular, indulges in
the character-destruction of one
(1) individual, Harvey H. Hukari,
Jr. "Harvey did me a no-no once,"
sniffs Jimmy, "so all YAF'ers are
no-no's." Such logic! And the way
in which he "proves" Hukari's
crime leaves no doubt that no one
to the left of Gene McCarthy is to
be tolerated, espeically in an
atmosphere of academic freedom.
He sets the stage by revealing
that Hukari worked in the offices
of Human Events which, says
Spickard, is a "newsletter
described by those in newspaper
work" as a right-wing publication,
to say the least. Wait, how do we
know that Human Events is
right-wing? From anonymous
people in newspaper work who
may not even exist. This tactic is
of the Elementary Smear variety.
So Hukari reported the
presence of Spickard on the
''liberal Democratic"
Congressman's staff and prompted
Human Events to investigate,
right? That is, Harvey marched up
to Ryskind and said, "There's an
SDS-radical on so-and-so's staff."
Sure. Thore's no possibility that
the information was passed on in
another way. Such as:
Ryskind: Who was that you
were talking to at the hearing?
Hukari: He's a guy who goes to
Stanford.
Ryskind: What's he doing
here?
Hukari: He's working in
Congressman X's office.

Ryskind, smelling a story: Did
he participate in any of those
demonstrations?
Hukari: Well, yes, he did.
I'm not saying this is what
happened, because I don't know
what happened, but the
possibility exists, just the same.
Even more importantly, even if
Hukari indeed stabbed Spickard in
the back intentionally, what
business is this of the Stanford
community?
Injustices
Take all the injustices done to
you during the past year and
multiply by 11,000, and then
publish them in the Daily, and the
Daily will get even worse. The
point of this article by Spickard,
of course, is to indict the YAF
through he unproven actions of its
leader, Harvey Hukari, who, next
to Spiro Agnew and Max
Rafferty, is the leading Stanford
villain, thanks to the impartial
efforts of the unbiased Daily.
It is amazing that, in a
community which describes itself
as free-thinking, there is such a
mass ignorance of and resistance
to libertarian conservatism, which
calls for individual action and, if
you will, "doing your own thing"
more than any ideology short of
Objectivism or pure anarchy,
which is not an ideology.
The number of students who
can define libertarian
conservatism is unbelievably
small. (I have not met one except
Hukari, who I met briefly once. I
am not a member of YAF.) But
the time and energy spent ot
oppose this movement, witness
the most recent tantrum by
Spickard, is unbelievably large. To
say that the Stanford community
is unfair to Hukari and his group

is like saying that Hitler was
unfair to the Jews.
Afraid to Join
I have met people who are
afraid to join YAF or even admit
to sympathy with the Republican
party. Sure, that's their problem,
but they didn't bring that
problem here to Stanford. Many
libertarians really don't like Spiro
Agnew or Max Rafferty either.
Some even break down and work
in the Moratorium.
People have forgotten, or
rather, have been made to forget
the panel discussion during
Pre-Reg week when, while
Schnieder, Rupert, and Franklin
babbled unintelligibly, Hukari
made real, live, concrete sense
even to such a rather recalcitrant
audience as I. But no, we are
informed under the auspices of
the Daily, Hukari is responsible
for the revival of McCarthyism
(Joe, not Gene) in the second
district, and the possible defeat of
this Congressman who, by virtue
of the fact that he is a liberal
Democrat, should not be defeated
though, for all we know, he beats
his wife or accepts kickbacks or
runs to the Stanford Daily with
the report that a former employee
of Human Events is president of
the Stanford YAF and should not
be tolerated. (Interestingly
enough, Hukari, in the ten
minutes that we talked over
lunch, admitted freely that
Human Events was by no means
an ideal periodical.)
Anyway, the YAF, comprised
of about ninety people of of
11,000, should be given some sort
of hearing that means more than a
personal pout in the Daily.
Personally, I am gradually coming
to the opinion that any tiny
organization that raises this much
blind opposition is worth
investigating, even if under an
assumed name. And anyone who
can rationally persuade me
otherwise, I'll be happy to give a
hearing.

an ideal periodical.)
Anyway, the YAF, comprised
of about ninety people of of
11,000, should be given some sort
of hearing that means more than a
personal pout in the Daily.
Personally, I am gradually coming
to the opinion that any tiny
organization that raises this much
blind opposition is worth
investigating, even if under an
assumed name. And anyone who
can rationally persuade me
otherwise, I'll be happy to give a
hearing.

The October 24 edition of the
Daily provided on its third page
what must be regarded as a gross
exercise in journalistic
thumb-sucking on the part of one
Jim Spickard.
In his article, Spickard, in the
guise of a warning against
right-wing groups in general and
the YAF in particular, indulges in
the character-destruction of one
(1) individual, Harvey H. Hukari,
Jr. "Harvey did me a no-no once,"
sniffs Jimmy, "so all YAF'ers are
no-no's." Such logic! And the way
in which he "proves" Hukari's
crime leaves no doubt that no one
to the left of Gene McCarthy is to
be tolerated, espeically in an
atmosphere of academic freedom.
He sets the stage by revealing
that Hukari worked in the offices
of Human Events which, says
Spickard, is a "newsletter
described by those in newspaper
work" as a right-wing publication,
to say the least. Wait, how do we
know that Human Events is
right-wing? From anonymous
people in newspaper work who
may not even exist. This tactic is
of the Elementary Smear variety.
So Hukari reported the
presence of Spickard on the
''liberal Democratic"
Congressman's staff and prompted
Human Events to investigate,
right? That is, Harvey marched up
to Ryskind and said, "There's an
SDS-radical on so-and-so's staff."
Sure. Thore's no possibility that
the information was passed on in
another way. Such as:
Ryskind: Who was that you
were talking to at the hearing?
Hukari: He's a guy who goes to
Stanford.
Ryskind: What's he doing
here?
Hukari: He's working in
Congressman X's office.

Ryskind, smelling a story: Did
he participate in any of those
demonstrations?
Hukari: Well, yes, he did.
I'm not saying this is what
happened, because I don't know
what happened, but the
possibility exists, just the same.
Even more importantly, even if
Hukari indeed stabbed Spickard in
the back intentionally, what
business is this of the Stanford
community?
Injustices
Take all the injustices done to
you during the past year and
multiply by 11,000, and then
publish them in the Daily, and the
Daily will get even worse. The
point of this article by Spickard,
of course, is to indict the YAF
through he unproven actions of its
leader, Harvey Hukari, who, next
to Spiro Agnew and Max
Rafferty, is the leading Stanford
villain, thanks to the impartial
efforts of the unbiased Daily.
It is amazing that, in a
community which describes itself
as free-thinking, there is such a
mass ignorance of and resistance
to libertarian conservatism, which
calls for individual action and, if
you will, "doing your own thing"
more than any ideology short of
Objectivism or pure anarchy,
which is not an ideology.
The number of students who
can define libertarian
conservatism is unbelievably
small. (I have not met one except
Hukari, who I met briefly once. I
am not a member of YAF.) But
the time and energy spent ot
oppose this movement, witness
the most recent tantrum by
Spickard, is unbelievably large. To
say that the Stanford community
is unfair to Hukari and his group

is like saying that Hitler was
unfair to the Jews.
Afraid to Join
I have met people who are
afraid to join YAF or even admit
to sympathy with the Republican
party. Sure, that's their problem,
but they didn't bring that
problem here to Stanford. Many
libertarians really don't like Spiro
Agnew or Max Rafferty either.
Some even break down and work
in the Moratorium.
People have forgotten, or
rather, have been made to forget
the panel discussion during
Pre-Reg week when, while
Schnieder, Rupert, and Franklin
babbled unintelligibly, Hukari
made real, live, concrete sense
even to such a rather recalcitrant
audience as I. But no, we are
informed under the auspices of
the Daily, Hukari is responsible
for the revival of McCarthyism
(Joe, not Gene) in the second
district, and the possible defeat of
this Congressman who, by virtue
of the fact that he is a liberal
Democrat, should not be defeated
though, for all we know, he beats
his wife or accepts kickbacks or
runs to the Stanford Daily with
the report that a former employee
of Human Events is president of
the Stanford YAF and should not
be tolerated. (Interestingly
enough, Hukari, in the ten
minutes that we talked over
lunch, admitted freely that
Human Events was by no means
an ideal periodical.)

(Joe, not Gene) in the second
district, and the possible defeat of
this Congressman who, by virtue
of the fact that he is a liberal
Democrat, should not be defeated
though, for all we know, he beats
his wife or accepts kickbacks or
runs to the Stanford Daily with
the report that a former employee
of Human Events is president of
the Stanford YAF and should not
be tolerated. (Interestingly
enough, Hukari, in the ten
minutes that we talked over
lunch, admitted freely that
Human Events was by no means
an ideal periodical.)
Anyway, the YAF, comprised
of about ninety people of of
11,000, should be given some sort
of hearing that means more than a
personal pout in the Daily.
Personally, I am gradually coming
to the opinion that any tiny
organization that raises this much
blind opposition is worth
investigating, even if under an
assumed name. And anyone who
can rationally persuade me
otherwise, I'll be happy to give a
hearing.

The October 24 edition of the
Daily provided on its third page
what must be regarded as a gross
exercise in journalistic
thumb-sucking on the part of one
Jim Spickard.
In his article, Spickard, in the
guise of a warning against
right-wing groups in general and
the YAF in particular, indulges in
the character-destruction of one
(1) individual, Harvey H. Hukari,
Jr. "Harvey did me a no-no once,"
sniffs Jimmy, "so all YAF'ers are
no-no's." Such logic! And the way
in which he "proves" Hukari's
crime leaves no doubt that no one
to the left of Gene McCarthy is to
be tolerated, espeically in an
atmosphere of academic freedom.
He sets the stage by revealing
that Hukari worked in the offices
of Human Events which, says
Spickard, is a "newsletter
described by those in newspaper
work" as a right-wing publication,
to say the least. Wait, how do we
know that Human Events is
right-wing? From anonymous
people in newspaper work who
may not even exist. This tactic is
of the Elementary Smear variety.
So Hukari reported the
presence of Spickard on the
''liberal Democratic"
Congressman's staff and prompted
Human Events to investigate,
right? That is, Harvey marched up
to Ryskind and said, "There's an
SDS-radical on so-and-so's staff."
Sure. Thore's no possibility that
the information was passed on in
another way. Such as:
Ryskind: Who was that you
were talking to at the hearing?
Hukari: He's a guy who goes to
Stanford.
Ryskind: What's he doing
here?
Hukari: He's working in
Congressman X's office.

Ryskind, smelling a story: Did
he participate in any of those
demonstrations?
Hukari: Well, yes, he did.
I'm not saying this is what
happened, because I don't know
what happened, but the
possibility exists, just the same.
Even more importantly, even if
Hukari indeed stabbed Spickard in
the back intentionally, what
business is this of the Stanford
community?
Injustices
Take all the injustices done to
you during the past year and
multiply by 11,000, and then
publish them in the Daily, and the
Daily will get even worse. The
point of this article by Spickard,
of course, is to indict the YAF
through he unproven actions of its
leader, Harvey Hukari, who, next
to Spiro Agnew and Max
Rafferty, is the leading Stanford
villain, thanks to the impartial
efforts of the unbiased Daily.
It is amazing that, in a
community which describes itself
as free-thinking, there is such a
mass ignorance of and resistance
to libertarian conservatism, which
calls for individual action and, if
you will, "doing your own thing"
more than any ideology short of
Objectivism or pure anarchy,
which is not an ideology.
The number of students who
can define libertarian
conservatism is unbelievably
small. (I have not met one except
Hukari, who I met briefly once. I
am not a member of YAF.) But
the time and energy spent ot
oppose this movement, witness
the most recent tantrum by
Spickard, is unbelievably large. To
say that the Stanford community
is unfair to Hukari and his group

is like saying that Hitler was
unfair to the Jews.
Afraid to Join
I have met people who are
afraid to join YAF or even admit
to sympathy with the Republican
party. Sure, that's their problem,
but they didn't bring that
problem here to Stanford. Many
libertarians really don't like Spiro
Agnew or Max Rafferty either.
Some even break down and work
in the Moratorium.
People have forgotten, or
rather, have been made to forget
the panel discussion during
Pre-Reg week when, while
Schnieder, Rupert, and Franklin
babbled unintelligibly, Hukari
made real, live, concrete sense
even to such a rather recalcitrant
audience as I. But no, we are
informed under the auspices of
the Daily, Hukari is responsible
for the revival of McCarthyism
(Joe, not Gene) in the second
district, and the possible defeat of
