# Look At The Facts
## Jewish Anti-Zionism 
### Patricia Mihaly 
(The following article written
by Political Science senior Patricia
Mi Italy, is in reply to a column
printed in last week's Daily. The
column questioned Miss Mihaly's
earlier charges of an Anti-Zionist
movement reputed to exist among
Jews.)
The American public has been
nurtured to a pro-Israeli stand by
propaganda like the two responses
Wednesday to my article on
Zionism. But let's look at the
facts. The unsigned article made
the equation Zionism=Jews--
Humans. The question of the
humanness of the Jews is not
under question, however, I would
refer to the American Council for
Judaism to show that there are
not only Jews that are non-Zionist
but a significant number that are
anti-Zionist as well.
Their Statement of Principles
as printed on one of their
pamphlets states: "We oppose the
effort to establish a National
Jewish State in Palestine or
anywhere else as a philosophy of
defeatism, and one which does
not offer a practical solution of
the Jewish problem, We dissent
from all those related doctrines
that stress the racialism, the
nationalism and the theoretical
homelessness of Jews."
The same unsigned response to
my article stated, "The Jews are
the world's most experienced
people at being part of other
people's states, and they stopped
buying it when they boarded the
boat for Israel." I won't deny the
truth of the last part, for Zionist's
from the beginning had no
intention of sharing government
with the Palestinian Arabs as one
can readily see from any even
limited reading of Zionist works.
I will however denounce such a
flagrant violation of
self-determination when over 67%
of the Palestine population in
1947 was Arab, and when every
U.N. member from Asia, Africa
and the Middle East voted against
the creation of a Jewish State in
Palestine at the U.N. except the
Union of South Africa, itself ruled
by an alien minority.
Critical Subtlety
The article by Joseph and
Carole Offir is more difficul to
answer because it has the subtlety
to catch the layman off guard and
make him believe all he reads
despite its falsity. On the
treatment of Arabs in Israel I
would reply by the following
quote from the Israeli Ihud
Party's statement of 1958, signed
by two professors at the Hebrew
University: "The bulk of Israel's
Arab population is subject to a
military rule that denies them the
rights of any free citizen. They
have no freedom of movement or
residence. They are not accepted
as equal members of the trade
unions and are not employed on
the same basis as others in most
organizations or government
departments. Their entire life
depends on the good graces of the
military governors and their
aides."
Or from William Zukerman,
editor of the Jewish Newsletter, in
this publication in 1959, writing
about the Arab refugees, "The
most tragic aspect of this entire
affair is not only that a grave
collective injustice has been
committed but that the majority
of Israelis and Diaspora Jews
justify and glorify it as an act of
patriotic pride, historic justice and
heroism."
The Offirs note that Palestine
was controlled by the Turkish
Empire and was under British
Mandate as a fact that Palestine
did not belong to the Arabs prior
to 1948. And I suppose Algeria

belonged to he French and Africa
to the various European countries
who controlled them until
recently? I presume you would
have denied the right of these
peoples to self-determination and
would agree with the apartheid
policy of South Africa?—or are
the Palestine Arabs a case by
themselves even though they
constituted the undeniable
majority in Palestine until Israel
was formed.
Typical Distortion
To say that Arab land in
Palestine was totally un worked
and undeveloped is a typical
distortion of facts. Much of the
"unclaimed" lands of fleeing
Arabs had been cultivated with
olive and orange groves and one
only need look at Israeli statistics
to know the very significant
number of Arab shops, homes,
hospitals and farms that were
owned by Arabs and never
reimbursed after Israel's creation.
Palestine was no desert and
Arabs there were far more
educated than their counterparts
in most developing nations before
1948. Certainly they, too, could
have created an impressive
economy if they had been given
the phenomenal amounts of aid
that Israel has received since its
creation.
The prospects of the Palestine
Arabs were good even without
such aid until they became a
political embarrassment to Zionist
ambitions and, far from
encouraging them to stay in the
new state, Dr. Weizmann, a noted
Zionist wrote in 1948, regarding
the flight of Arabs from Israel, "It
was a miraculous cleaning of the

land; the miraculous
simplificaiton of Israel's task."
National Community
A last remark that I would
make involves the Offir's
statement that Arab nationalism
and znti-Zionism came "only
later," obviously later than
Zionism, but presumably after the
point of no return to he
establishment of a Jewish state.
An article was quoted in a
Congressional committee hearing
in 1944, well before Israel's
establishment, by an avowed
Zionist, Oscar I. Janowsky
regarding Arab nationalism, "To
ignore the Arabs would be neither
statesmanlike nor helpful. They
constitute a national community
and form today the numerical
majority of the population of
Palestine . . .That their influence
will wane or that the Arab masses
will remain lethargic are
assumptions not borne out by
similar developments in other
countries."
The findings of the U.S.
King-Crane Commission of 1919
are conclusive evidence to the
anti-Zionist attitudes of the Arabs
almost 40 years before the
creation of Israel.
I would go on answering other
points of the two articles but fear
the limits of Daily space would
only make me victim to editing
procedures. If 1 am requested I
will make further comments in a
later article. I can give detailed
citat ions of the quotations & facts
I've used as well as give non-Arab,
non-Israeli material to anyone
interested in studying the subject
further.

not only Jews that are non-Zionist
but a significant number that are
anti-Zionist as well.
Their Statement of Principles
as printed on one of their
pamphlets states: "We oppose the
effort to establish a National
Jewish State in Palestine or
anywhere else as a philosophy of
defeatism, and one which does
not offer a practical solution of
the Jewish problem, We dissent
from all those related doctrines
that stress the racialism, the
nationalism and the theoretical
homelessness of Jews."
The same unsigned response to
my article stated, "The Jews are
the world's most experienced
people at being part of other
people's states, and they stopped
buying it when they boarded the
boat for Israel." I won't deny the
truth of the last part, for Zionist's
from the beginning had no
intention of sharing government
with the Palestinian Arabs as one
can readily see from any even
limited reading of Zionist works.
I will however denounce such a
flagrant violation of
self-determination when over 67%
of the Palestine population in
1947 was Arab, and when every
U.N. member from Asia, Africa
and the Middle East voted against
the creation of a Jewish State in
Palestine at the U.N. except the
Union of South Africa, itself ruled
by an alien minority.
Critical Subtlety
The article by Joseph and
Carole Offir is more difficul to
answer because it has the subtlety
to catch the layman off guard and
make him believe all he reads
despite its falsity. On the
treatment of Arabs in Israel I
would reply by the following
quote from the Israeli Ihud
Party's statement of 1958, signed
by two professors at the Hebrew
University: "The bulk of Israel's
Arab population is subject to a
military rule that denies them the
rights of any free citizen. They
have no freedom of movement or
residence. They are not accepted
as equal members of the trade
unions and are not employed on
the same basis as others in most
organizations or government
departments. Their entire life
depends on the good graces of the
military governors and their
aides."
Or from William Zukerman,
editor of the Jewish Newsletter, in
this publication in 1959, writing
about the Arab refugees, "The
most tragic aspect of this entire
affair is not only that a grave
collective injustice has been
committed but that the majority
of Israelis and Diaspora Jews
justify and glorify it as an act of
patriotic pride, historic justice and
heroism."
The Offirs note that Palestine
was controlled by the Turkish
Empire and was under British
Mandate as a fact that Palestine
did not belong to the Arabs prior
to 1948. And I suppose Algeria

belonged to he French and Africa
to the various European countries
who controlled them until
recently? I presume you would
have denied the right of these
peoples to self-determination and
would agree with the apartheid
policy of South Africa?—or are
the Palestine Arabs a case by
themselves even though they
constituted the undeniable
majority in Palestine until Israel
was formed.
Typical Distortion
To say that Arab land in
Palestine was totally un worked
and undeveloped is a typical
distortion of facts. Much of the
"unclaimed" lands of fleeing
Arabs had been cultivated with
olive and orange groves and one
only need look at Israeli statistics
to know the very significant
number of Arab shops, homes,
hospitals and farms that were
owned by Arabs and never
reimbursed after Israel's creation.
Palestine was no desert and
Arabs there were far more
educated than their counterparts
in most developing nations before
1948. Certainly they, too, could
have created an impressive
economy if they had been given
the phenomenal amounts of aid
that Israel has received since its
creation.
The prospects of the Palestine
Arabs were good even without
such aid until they became a
political embarrassment to Zionist
ambitions and, far from
encouraging them to stay in the
new state, Dr. Weizmann, a noted
Zionist wrote in 1948, regarding
the flight of Arabs from Israel, "It
was a miraculous cleaning of the

land; the miraculous
simplificaiton of Israel's task."
National Community
A last remark that I would
make involves the Offir's
statement that Arab nationalism
and znti-Zionism came "only
later," obviously later than
Zionism, but presumably after the
point of no return to he
establishment of a Jewish state.
An article was quoted in a
Congressional committee hearing
in 1944, well before Israel's
establishment, by an avowed
Zionist, Oscar I. Janowsky
regarding Arab nationalism, "To
ignore the Arabs would be neither
statesmanlike nor helpful. They
constitute a national community
and form today the numerical
majority of the population of
Palestine . . .That their influence
will wane or that the Arab masses
will remain lethargic are
assumptions not borne out by
similar developments in other
countries."
The findings of the U.S.
King-Crane Commission of 1919
are conclusive evidence to the
anti-Zionist attitudes of the Arabs
almost 40 years before the
creation of Israel.
I would go on answering other
points of the two articles but fear
the limits of Daily space would
only make me victim to editing
procedures. If 1 am requested I
will make further comments in a
later article. I can give detailed
citat ions of the quotations & facts
I've used as well as give non-Arab,
non-Israeli material to anyone
interested in studying the subject
further.
(The following article written
by Political Science senior Patricia
Mi Italy, is in reply to a column
printed in last week's Daily. The
column questioned Miss Mihaly's
earlier charges of an Anti-Zionist
movement reputed to exist among
Jews.)
The American public has been
nurtured to a pro-Israeli stand by
propaganda like the two responses
Wednesday to my article on
Zionism. But let's look at the

the equation Zionism=Jews--

boat for Israel." I won't deny the
truth of the last part, for Zionist's
from the beginning had no
intention of sharing government
with the Palestinian Arabs as one
can readily see from any even
limited reading of Zionist works.
I will however denounce such a
flagrant violation of
self-determination when over 67%
of the Palestine population in
1947 was Arab, and when every
U.N. member from Asia, Africa
and the Middle East voted against
the creation of a Jewish State in
Palestine at the U.N. except the
Union of South Africa, itself ruled
by an alien minority.
Critical Subtlety
The article by Joseph and
Carole Offir is more difficul to
answer because it has the subtlety
to catch the layman off guard and
make him believe all he reads
despite its falsity. On the
treatment of Arabs in Israel I
would reply by the following
quote from the Israeli Ihud
Party's statement of 1958, signed
by two professors at the Hebrew
University: "The bulk of Israel's
Arab population is subject to a
military rule that denies them the
rights of any free citizen. They
have no freedom of movement or
residence. They are not accepted
as equal members of the trade
unions and are not employed on
the same basis as others in most
organizations or government
departments. Their entire life
depends on the good graces of the
military governors and their
aides."
Or from William Zukerman,
editor of the Jewish Newsletter, in
this publication in 1959, writing
about the Arab refugees, "The
most tragic aspect of this entire
affair is not only that a grave
collective injustice has been
committed but that the majority
of Israelis and Diaspora Jews
justify and glorify it as an act of
patriotic pride, historic justice and
heroism."
The Offirs note that Palestine
was controlled by the Turkish
Empire and was under British
Mandate as a fact that Palestine
did not belong to the Arabs prior
to 1948. And I suppose Algeria

belonged to he French and Africa
to the various European countries
who controlled them until
recently? I presume you would
have denied the right of these
peoples to self-determination and
would agree with the apartheid
policy of South Africa?—or are
the Palestine Arabs a case by
themselves even though they
constituted the undeniable
majority in Palestine until Israel
was formed.
Typical Distortion
To say that Arab land in
Palestine was totally un worked
and undeveloped is a typical
distortion of facts. Much of the
"unclaimed" lands of fleeing
Arabs had been cultivated with
olive and orange groves and one
only need look at Israeli statistics
to know the very significant
number of Arab shops, homes,
hospitals and farms that were
owned by Arabs and never
reimbursed after Israel's creation.
Palestine was no desert and
Arabs there were far more
educated than their counterparts
in most developing nations before
1948. Certainly they, too, could
have created an impressive
economy if they had been given
the phenomenal amounts of aid
that Israel has received since its
creation.
The prospects of the Palestine
Arabs were good even without
such aid until they became a
political embarrassment to Zionist
ambitions and, far from
encouraging them to stay in the
new state, Dr. Weizmann, a noted
Zionist wrote in 1948, regarding
the flight of Arabs from Israel, "It
was a miraculous cleaning of the

land; the miraculous
simplificaiton of Israel's task."
National Community
A last remark that I would
make involves the Offir's
statement that Arab nationalism
and znti-Zionism came "only
later," obviously later than
Zionism, but presumably after the
point of no return to he
establishment of a Jewish state.
An article was quoted in a
Congressional committee hearing
in 1944, well before Israel's
establishment, by an avowed
Zionist, Oscar I. Janowsky
regarding Arab nationalism, "To
ignore the Arabs would be neither
statesmanlike nor helpful. They
constitute a national community
and form today the numerical
majority of the population of
Palestine . . .That their influence
will wane or that the Arab masses
will remain lethargic are
assumptions not borne out by
similar developments in other
countries."
The findings of the U.S.
King-Crane Commission of 1919
are conclusive evidence to the
anti-Zionist attitudes of the Arabs
almost 40 years before the
creation of Israel.
I would go on answering other
points of the two articles but fear
the limits of Daily space would
only make me victim to editing
procedures. If 1 am requested I
will make further comments in a
later article. I can give detailed
citat ions of the quotations & facts
I've used as well as give non-Arab,
non-Israeli material to anyone
interested in studying the subject
further.
(The following article written
by Political Science senior Patricia
Mi Italy, is in reply to a column
printed in last week's Daily. The
column questioned Miss Mihaly's
earlier charges of an Anti-Zionist
movement reputed to exist among
Jews.)
The American public has been
nurtured to a pro-Israeli stand by
propaganda like the two responses
Wednesday to my article on
Zionism. But let's look at the
facts. The unsigned article made
the equation Zionism=Jews--
Humans. The question of the
humanness of the Jews is not
under question, however, I would
refer to the American Council for
Judaism to show that there are
not only Jews that are non-Zionist
but a significant number that are
anti-Zionist as well.
Their Statement of Principles
as printed on one of their
pamphlets states: "We oppose the
effort to establish a National
Jewish State in Palestine or
anywhere else as a philosophy of
defeatism, and one which does
not offer a practical solution of
the Jewish problem, We dissent
from all those related doctrines
that stress the racialism, the
nationalism and the theoretical
homelessness of Jews."
The same unsigned response to
my article stated, "The Jews are
the world's most experienced
people at being part of other
people's states, and they stopped
buying it when they boarded the
boat for Israel." I won't deny the
truth of the last part, for Zionist's
