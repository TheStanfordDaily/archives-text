# Write On!
## In The Arena 
### Ed Kohn 
Write on, brothers. What a
pleasant surprise to wake up
Thursday morning to read of
Cousin Ken's resignation, the
South's New Rising, and the
massive traffic jams caused by the
SRI demonstrations.
Oh wow! It's certainly nice to
know that someone cares.
Lest we forget, Pitzer's
promotion to Civilian Director of
Research at Fort Dix represents a
major increase in social
responsibility. At least he won't
have to appoint three committees,
four subcommmittees and five
sub-subcommittees to study each
problem, and if he's really
concerned about CBW research,
here's his big chance.
And Trenton, N.J. is such a
beautiful city. It combines the
best of all possible worlds into
one thriving metropolis: the smog
of Los Angeles and Newark, the
overcrowding of Chinatown, the
unemployment of Wheeling and
Watts, and manageability of New
York City, the money of the
Mafia, and "rapid transit"
courtesy of the Pensey.
Cable Car Defense
God, what an improvement.
S.F. can hardly offer a cablecar to
its defense, much less Melvin
Belli's offices. Ken should really
get along well at the Dix. There
aren't that many leftists in the
Army—at least at Fort Dix. All 38
are in the brig.
What a great cartoon. Really dig
those stereotypes. But, Mr. Cobb,
are everyone's eyes really that
wide open when they are shouting
at the top of their lungs? Are
people's mouths really all that

huge in comparison to heir ears?
Funny is funny, but . . .
Naturally, here was great
reading about Marc Sapir, J.K.
Galbraith, and Leftist Fascism. It
could have been taken from the
Manion Forum, a Brich Society
newsletter, the Paly Times, the
N.Y. Daily News, or even from
the personal files of the immortal
Charles "Amen" Mclntyre. Would
have been nice, though, if they'd
come up with a new line or even a
new slant—just something to make
it distinguishable from everything
that we've read in he past.
Bolt From Blue
Only one part of the paper was
incomprehensible. "Bay Area
Radio Rocks," complete with a
pic of a non-caucasian, was a true
bolt from the blue (or perhaps a
bolt from the white) and was
completely out of line with the
rest of the matter contained in the
Arena. Don't know what
prompted editor Hukari, Jr., to
include it; perhaps he was hard up
for filler or was trying to emulate
the Chappie. Left and Right
getting it on together? Hardly
likely.
One article was missing from
the Arena's first issue; perhaps it
will appear shortly. What we need
is a good multi-pronged attack on
campus drugs. Next time, maybe
we'll see that instead of another
article on rock music stations.
Aside from this shortcoming, the
Arena did a fine job, and certainly
scooped the Daily. Mission
accomplished.
I won't hold my breath.
