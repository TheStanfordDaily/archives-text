# SES Overseas Report Attacked By Students
## 
### 
In individually written reports,
students at the overseas campuses
have reacted critically to several
of the recommendations
contained in the "Report on
Study Abroad" sections of the
SES (Study of Education at
Stanford) Report.
The recommendation that
drew the most fire was one calling
for the establishment of
twenty-five man committees on
each campus to function as the
main decision and policy-making
organ for the group.
Under the SES proposals, the
Overseas Campus Co-ordination
Committee would have only

nominal authority. As Mike
Duncheon, President of Britain
VII, said, "It was our fear that
such a system as advocated by the
SES report would sacrifice
program efficiency and program
unity, and a certain amount of
central control is desireable."
British Group Proposals
The recommendations of the
British VII students were to
establish one Overseas Campus
Committee composed of five
faculty, five students, and the
head of the Overseas Campus
program, who would vote only to
break ties. In addition, there
would be a subcommittee on
which one Stanford professor, one

local professor, the resident
assistant, and three students
selected by the student body
would serve.
The Academic Senate, in a
ruling on the SES
recommendations, voted in favor
of a committee-subcommittee
governing body of the type
formulated by the British VII
report.
Other Suggestions
The report submitted by
Britain VII also criticized the
suggestion by the SES that
campuses abroad be specialized.
This would mean, for instance,
that only those students with a
special interest in art would be
eligible to attend the Italian
campus.
In their letter, the students of
Britain VII stated, "It is our
firmly held belief that the
overseas campus program should
be designed to allow the
involvement of as many students
of as varied academic backgrounds
as is possible."
Other areas criticized by
Britain VII and the Italian group,
which also sent in a
comprehensive reaction to the
SES, included an expanded
orientation program (a
recommendation which has been
passed by the Academic Senate),
and increased opportunities for
independent study and field trips.
