# Meditation Expands Minds At Esalen Workshop
## 
### JANE CORRIGAN 
A Stanford Esalen Center
workshop attempted to expand
consciousness in experiments with
hypnosis instead of drugs over the
weekend.
Led by Dr. Bernard Aaronson,
a psychologist and head of
experimental psychology of the
New Jersey Department of
Neurology and Psychiatry, the
varied participants experimented
with a variety of hypnotic and
meditational techniques.
Dr. Aaronson defended
hypnosis and dismissed common
misconceptions about it saying
that people who live movies,
meditate or daydream are all in
hypnotic states. "The hypnotic
state is one which you go in and
out of all day." He feels that
hypnosis is nothing to be afraid
of, but rather a perfectly normal
activity.
"All hypnosis is auto-hypnosis.
The hypnotist is a catalyst, an
occasion, a doorway. There are
many avenues into the hypnotic
state and they all parallel
meditation [because meditation]
is hypnosis."
Breathing Exercises
After requesting that shoes be
removed because "shoes hurt
when you're being hypnotized,"

Dr. Aaronson proceeded to
demonstrate the interrelationship
between hypnosis and meditation
by having the group do two deep
breathing exercises, one a classic
self-hypnotic technique and the
other one of the oldest and most
basic forms of Zen meditation.
After this introduction, the
main activity of the workshop was
the exploration and use of various
hypnotic and meditational
techniques, including chanting,
concentration on specific visual
images, and listening to poetry
while hypnotized in the attempt
to actually become what is being
heard.
Dr. Aaronson also stressed the
practical benefits of self-hypnosis.
He said that it could be used to
block out interfering stimuli when
concentration is required, to
improve sleep, and even to control
the body by cutting off pain or
stopping bleeding.
This workshop was one of a
series planned by the Stanford
Esalen Center. The Center, which
is a branch of the Esalen Center in
Big Sur, has been operating for
three years, during which more
than two thousand Stanford
community members have
participated in its workshops and
seminars.
