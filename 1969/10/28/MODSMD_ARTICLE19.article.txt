# Sterling Receives Prize At Berkeley
## 
### 
Chancellor J.E. Wallace
Sterling last week received the
Clark Kerr award of the faculty of
the University of California at
Berkeley.
Presented by Prof. Richard E.
Powell, chairman of the Berkeley
faculty Senate, the award consists
of a gold medal financed through
voluntary faculty contributions.
It is made in recognition of
"extraordinarily distinguished
contributions to the advancement
of higher education." Sterling is
the second recipient of the award,
which was established by the
faculty in 1967 and initially given
to Kerr.

Adopted by unanimous
acclaim of the Berkeley faculty,
the award committee report noted
that "during his presidency,
1949-68, Wallace Sterling
provided leadership for Stanford's
greatest period of growth in terms
of numbers of faculty and
students, in facilities, and in
financial and other resources.
"More important was the
steady advance in the qualify of
undergraduate and graduate
instruction and in scholarly,
scientific, and professional
recognition."
Earlier this month, Sterling was
elected to the Stanford Board of
Trustees.
