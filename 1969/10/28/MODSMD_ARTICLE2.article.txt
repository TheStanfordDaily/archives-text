# Three Month Sentence Given Student For Rock Throwing
## 
### JOHN COONROD 
The harshest penalty to date
stemming from last spring's
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
disturbances went yesterday to
former Stanford student Larry
Christiani. One of over ninety
demonstrators charged, he has
begun serving a three month jail
sentence.
The decision was handed down
in San Mateo Superior Court
following Christiani's plea of
guilty to a charge of throwing
rocks at a police vehicle, a
misdemeanor. He was orginally
charged with felonious rock
throwing to do great bodily harm,
but District Attorney Edward
Pliska agreed to accept a guilty
plea to the lesser charge, in which
case Christiani could not be tried
for the felony. A report from the
probation committee
recommended a $100 fine and
one year probation; both the
District Attorney and defense
attorney Jim Wolpman accepted
the recommendation.

In setting the punishment,
however, Judge Robert F. Kane
overruled the probation
committee report. Judge Kane, an
appointee of Governor Reagan,
cited previous actions against
Christiani which had been
mentioned in he report. These
were an arrest in Lytton Plaza for
which Christiani had been
aquitted, and a juvenile offense.
Wolpman told the Daily that
the juvenile offense was not
admissible as it was part of a
sealed record, but "that as the
judge's reasons disappeared," it
was evident that the sentence
would still stand.
Wolpman stated he beleived
the judge "abused his discretion in
setting the prison term.
Alter Demonstration
According to Wolpman, the
incident that led to the arrest
occured after the SRI
demonstration had ended. He said
Christiani and some others were
walking across a play field near
SRI and the city hall, tossing

rocks at trees. A police car
stopped, the officers questioned
them, and the questioning became
an argument.
Wolpman said that one of the
students was taken into the car,
and that some rocks were thrown.
He said "Larry admitted throwing
a rock, but that it did not hit the
car." Christiani, however, was the
only one arrested.
Christiani began his term at 5
p.m. yesterday. There is a
possibility that he could serve the
term in a work-furlough program,
working during the day and
returning to jail at night. As of
yet, however, he has not been able
to find a job. Otherwise he will
have to serve the term in jail or
the county prison farm.
Wolpman added that there is
no grounds for an appeal as the
plea was guilty. He said "the
situation is awful, but legally not
awful enough for a method of
relief."

It was erroneously reported in
Monday's Daily that Michael
James Beeson, one of six recently

in fact, is a graduate math student

plea was guilty. He said "the
situation is awful, but legally not
awful enough for a method of

It was erroneously reported in
Monday's Daily that Michael
James Beeson, one of six recently
arrested in the SRI case, was "an
engineering instructor." Beeson,
in fact, is a graduate math student
and was a math TA.
The harshest penalty to date
stemming from last spring's
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
disturbances went yesterday to
former Stanford student Larry
Christiani. One of over ninety
demonstrators charged, he has
begun serving a three month jail
sentence.
The decision was handed down
in San Mateo Superior Court
following Christiani's plea of
guilty to a charge of throwing
rocks at a police vehicle, a
misdemeanor. He was orginally
charged with felonious rock
throwing to do great bodily harm,
but District Attorney Edward
Pliska agreed to accept a guilty
plea to the lesser charge, in which
case Christiani could not be tried
for the felony. A report from the
probation committee
recommended a $100 fine and
one year probation; both the
District Attorney and defense
attorney Jim Wolpman accepted
the recommendation.

In setting the punishment,
however, Judge Robert F. Kane
overruled the probation
committee report. Judge Kane, an
appointee of Governor Reagan,
cited previous actions against
Christiani which had been
mentioned in he report. These
were an arrest in Lytton Plaza for
which Christiani had been
aquitted, and a juvenile offense.
Wolpman told the Daily that
the juvenile offense was not
admissible as it was part of a
sealed record, but "that as the
judge's reasons disappeared," it
was evident that the sentence
would still stand.
Wolpman stated he beleived
the judge "abused his discretion in
setting the prison term.
Alter Demonstration
According to Wolpman, the
incident that led to the arrest
occured after the SRI
demonstration had ended. He said
Christiani and some others were
walking across a play field near
SRI and the city hall, tossing

rocks at trees. A police car
stopped, the officers questioned
them, and the questioning became
an argument.
Wolpman said that one of the
students was taken into the car,
and that some rocks were thrown.
He said "Larry admitted throwing
a rock, but that it did not hit the
car." Christiani, however, was the
only one arrested.
Christiani began his term at 5
p.m. yesterday. There is a
possibility that he could serve the
term in a work-furlough program,
working during the day and
returning to jail at night. As of
yet, however, he has not been able
to find a job. Otherwise he will
have to serve the term in jail or
the county prison farm.
Wolpman added that there is
no grounds for an appeal as the
plea was guilty. He said "the
situation is awful, but legally not
awful enough for a method of
relief."
