# Prophet on Parade At Sunday Service
## 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
The "Children of Lsrael"
occupied the pulpit during
Sunday's services in Memorial
Church and delivered a message of
doom for- mankind. Thirty
members of the communal sect
marched down the main aisle
pounding the floor with their
staffs, while the congregation sang
the sermon hymn.
James Ballester, leader of the
group, delivered a warning of the
destruction of the world found in
chapter 18 of the Old Testament
Book of Jeremiah. He then
smashed a flower pot on the floor
of the church.
Rev. Napier and his sanctuary
guest, the Rev. Carol Gotten, dean
of students at Chapman College,
were not visibly disturbed by the
intrusion. Napier later told the
congregation that the warning was
"in Jeremiah's time an authentic
Word," adding that he did "not
request it but I'm grateful for its
being spoken."
The self-appointed prophets,
who call themselves "The Children
of Israel," were identically dressed
in red burlap robes and wore
imitation oxen yokes around their
necks. Each member of the group
had a streak of ash on his
forehead, and many carried
Bibles.
It rads Bible
Waiting till the sermon hymn

was concluded, Ballester unfolded
a scroll before the congregation
and read the portions of Jeremiah
which predict God's destruction
of the ancient Israelites who had
forsaken God's law.
Ballester then smashed the
flower pot of the mosaic floor of
the chancel. In the Bible,
Jeremiah's breaking of an
imperfect potter's vessel
symbolized God's impending
destruction of imperfect man.
Afterwards. Ballester rolled up
his scroll and led the group up the
main aisle and out of the church.
Sing "Amen"
Several "Children of Lsrael"
were stationed in the
Congregation and sang our
"Amen" when Napier said in his
sermon that there was "the
possibility that civilization will be
smashed as violently and
ruthlessly as the pot."
An unidentified youth
interrupted the service just before
the recessional and shouted that
Memorial Church was not a
"building of God" and that the
"Bible is not being practiced in
the schools and universities."
To giggles of laughter and sighs
ot boredom, he continued,
America is going down to
Communism . . .the Communists
are going to take over the whole
nation . . .God will destroy
America very soon, saith the
Lord "

RADICAL DISSENT—Five different and often conflicting viewpoints towards
the radical movement were presented at an SDS-sponsored panel discussion last
night in Bishop Auditorium. The speakers, representing anarchists, the "radical
youth culture," the Progressive Labor Party, the Revolutionary Union, and the
Stantord New Left, first presented their own positions and later answered
questions from the audience. Coverage of the meeting will appear in the DAILY
tomorrow.

was concluded, Ballester unfolded
a scroll before the congregation
and read the portions of Jeremiah
which predict God's destruction
of the ancient Israelites who had
forsaken God's law.
Ballester then smashed the
flower pot of the mosaic floor of
the chancel. In the Bible,
Jeremiah's breaking of an
imperfect potter's vessel
symbolized God's impending
destruction of imperfect man.
Afterwards. Ballester rolled up
his scroll and led the group up the
main aisle and out of the church.
Sing "Amen"
Several "Children of Lsrael"
were stationed in the
Congregation and sang our
"Amen" when Napier said in his
sermon that there was "the
possibility that civilization will be
smashed as violently and
ruthlessly as the pot."
An unidentified youth
interrupted the service just before
the recessional and shouted that
Memorial Church was not a
"building of God" and that the
"Bible is not being practiced in
the schools and universities."
To giggles of laughter and sighs
ot boredom, he continued,
America is going down to
Communism . . .the Communists
are going to take over the whole
nation . . .God will destroy
America very soon, saith the

RADICAL DISSENT—Five different and often conflicting viewpoints towards
the radical movement were presented at an SDS-sponsored panel discussion last
night in Bishop Auditorium. The speakers, representing anarchists, the "radical
youth culture," the Progressive Labor Party, the Revolutionary Union, and the
Stantord New Left, first presented their own positions and later answered
questions from the audience. Coverage of the meeting will appear in the DAILY
tomorrow.
The "Children of Lsrael"
occupied the pulpit during
Sunday's services in Memorial
Church and delivered a message of
doom for- mankind. Thirty
members of the communal sect
marched down the main aisle
pounding the floor with their
staffs, while the congregation sang
the sermon hymn.
James Ballester, leader of the
group, delivered a warning of the
destruction of the world found in
chapter 18 of the Old Testament
Book of Jeremiah. He then
smashed a flower pot on the floor
of the church.
Rev. Napier and his sanctuary
guest, the Rev. Carol Gotten, dean
of students at Chapman College,
were not visibly disturbed by the
intrusion. Napier later told the
congregation that the warning was
"in Jeremiah's time an authentic
Word," adding that he did "not
request it but I'm grateful for its
being spoken."
The self-appointed prophets,
who call themselves "The Children
of Israel," were identically dressed
in red burlap robes and wore
imitation oxen yokes around their
necks. Each member of the group
had a streak of ash on his
forehead, and many carried
Bibles.
