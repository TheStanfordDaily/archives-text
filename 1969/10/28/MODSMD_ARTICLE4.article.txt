# 'Here To Hear
## GOP Touring Campus 
### 
Three Republican legislators
will attempt to bridge the
communication gap today and
listen to students' political
concerns.
Stanford marks the start of a
six campus tour this fall by a team
appointed last Spring by
Republican Speaker Bob Monahan
to explore the campus issues.
Based on the results this fall, the
"Here to Hear" program will
probably be repeated in the
spring, according to committee
head Assemblyman Frank
Murphy, Jr. of Santa Cruz.
Joining Murphy for the busy
all-day schedule that includes
disucssions with students, meals in
the residences, and an afternoon
panel discussion, are
Assemblymen Craig Biddle of
Riverside and George Milias of
Santa Clara County.
A forum is scheduled at 3:30
in Tresidder large lounge on the
"Future of Higher Education in
California." Joining the legislators
for the discussion are ASSU
Council of Presidents member Pat
Shea and two other students.
President Kenneth Pitzer has
joined other California educators
in endorsing "Students benefit by
the efforts of both parties to bring

their legislators closer to the
student constituency of today."
Few Campus Appearances
Murphy claims it is
"unfortunate" that the "many
young, articulate, and
knowledgeable Republican
members of the Assembly"
haven't appeared on campus.
Besides meals in the residences
and the forum, an intensive
interview is scheduled in the
morning with all the campus
student newspapers.
Afternoon arrangements
include a meeting with university
administrators, ap<ess co ference,
a meeting with student leaders,

and a reception with faculty
members.
Murphy serves on three key
Assembly committees. He is
chairman of the Committee on
Criminal Procedure, and a
member of the Revenue and
Taxation Committee and the
Elections and Constitutional
Amendments Committee.
Criminal Law Expert
Biddle is an expert in the area
of criminal law and law
enforcement, having authored
landmark legislation in the areas of
juvenile courts, abortion, and drug
abuse.
