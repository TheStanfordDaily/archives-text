The November Moratorium
will begin to take definite shape
with a community meeting
planned for this Sunday night The
meeting, which will be held in
either Memorial Auditorium or
Memorial Church, is for anyone
interested, according to
Moratorium chairman John
Karmer.
The meeting will deal with
specific plans and issues in the
Moratorium. Professor Martin
Carnoy will explain what the
Moratorium is at a national and
local level. Later a vote will be
held on reaffirming the objective
of the Moratoriumâ€”"an
immediate, timetabled withdrawal
of all our troops from Vietnam,"
in Kramer's words.
There will also be a vote to set
priorities for the activities on
November 13 and 14. Possibilities
for the main thrust of the
November Moratorium include
marches, canvassing, leafleting,
and picketing in the Industrial
Park.
