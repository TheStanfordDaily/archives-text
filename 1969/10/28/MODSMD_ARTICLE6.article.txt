## Crime Versus Law 
### JUDY BIRK 
Political lawlessness on college
campuses and the overwhelming
increase of crime in the streets are
threatening the rule of law in our
society, State Senator George
Deukmejian asserted yesterday
before a small gathering in the
Tresidder Large Lounge.
The appearance of
Deukmejian, a candidate for the
Republican nomination for state
Attorney General was sponsored
by the Republican Club and the
Young Republicans.
Deukmejian also the present
Senate majority floor leader has
chosen campus unrest as one of
his major issues against incumbent
Attorney General Thomas Lynch,
Democrat. "I plan to take a
leading role as the state's chief
prosecutor and to make it clear
that anarchists and revolutionaries
who disrupt college campuses and
our cities should not be granted
any kind of amnesty," declared
Deukmejian.
Denouncing leniency in the
courts, Deukmejian aims "to get
rid of the dangerous policy of
granting amnesty for violating the
law." There should bo no double
standard in dealing with campus
rioters and revolutionaries in his
belief.
"Laws are the avenues for
progress in our society," stated
Deukmejian. During his seven
years in the California legislature
Deukmejian has authored much
legislation in the field of crime
prevention and punishment.

His efforts have been directed
toward increased penalties for
criminals convicted of inflicting
great bodily harm on their
victims, reduction of court delays
by elimination of frivolous
criminal appeals, controlling
pornography, and opposing
legislation that would weaken
narcotics laws.
Deukmejian expressed concern
lor improving the entire system of
criminal justice. He emphasized
the need to enforce existing laws
over the need for more laws or for
changes in the law
Describing marijuana as "an
unpredictable, mind-altering
drug," Deukmejian adamantly
opposes its legislation Discussion
of drug abuse monopolized the
question-and-answer period
following his address.
Marijuana represents a threat
both to the individuals who use it
and to society in general,
according to Deukmejian. He
correlated alcohol and marijuana,
explaining that our society has
enough problems stemming from
alcohol, ranging from broken
families to death and injuries on
our highways.
Deukmejian is basing his
campaign for the Republican
nomination for state Attorney
General on his firm conviction
that the law is the cornerstone of
our government and our society.
He faces competition from
Republican State Senator John
Harmer of Los Angeles who will
announce hiscandidac\ today.
