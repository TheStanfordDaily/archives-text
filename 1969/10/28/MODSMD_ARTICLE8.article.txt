## Talks In Lebanon 
### 
BEIRUT (AP)—Lebanon's
political and military leaders
mapped strategy yesterday in
preparation for crucial talks with
Arab guerrillas about their
conflict that has left some 30
dead and scores wounded.
Tension eased in most of
Lebanon's main cities but gunfire
crackled again in the Old City of
Tripoli, still in the grip of
insurgent guerrillas. A 1 Fatah, the
Arab guerilla organization,
reported new fighting with
Lebanese troops in southern
Lebanon.
President Charles Helou
conferred wi'h outgoing Premier
Rashid Karami, the commander in
chief and chief of staff of the
army, and his top political
advisers in advance of Karami's
expected departure for Cairo for
talks with the guerrilla leadership.
He will be accompanied by
military chiefs, sources said.
Egypt Role
The talks are being fostered by
Egypt. A personal envoy of
Egyptian President Gamal Abdel
Nasser has been touring Arab
capitals to arrange negotiations.
Lebanon says publicly it
supports the Palestinian resistance
movements but wants operations
against Israel from this country
coordinated with the Lebanese
army. Such operations must not
expose its population to Israeli
reprisals, the Lebanese say. But
Lebanese officials do not say how
such operations could be carried
out in a way that would avoid
Israeli retaliation.
The guerrillas demand
complete freedom of operation
anywhere along the twisting
rugged border with Israel.

CHICAGO (AP)—An antiwar
leader said today that North
Vietnam plans to release the
names of U.S. prisoners of war
and open the way for
correspondence bwtween the
captured men and their families.
David Dellinger, an organizer
of the National Mobilization
Committee to End the Vietnam
War, spoke at a news conference

between sessions of the trial
where he and seven other men are
charged with conspiring to incite
rioting during the 1968
Democratic National Convention.
Dellinger did not say how
many names will be released and
he added that, "It might be some
time before this takes place."
William M. Kunstler, a New
York lawyer who is representing
Dellinger, was in Paris over the
weekend and spoke with North
Vietnamese officials as
representative of Dellinger and
Rennard C. "Rennie" Davis.
Davis and Dellinger were
denied permission to go to Paris
by Judge Julius J. Hoffman of
U.S. District Court who is
presiding in their trial.
During the morning session of
the trial, an undercover policeman
testified that he heard six of the
defendants participate in meetings
prior to the convention.
William Frapolly said he heard
Davis urge demonstrators to be
careful not to provoke federal or
National Guard troops. He quoted
Davis as referring to the Chicago
police and saying, "We can't avoid
a confrontation with them
anyway so we should provoke
them every time we get a chance."
