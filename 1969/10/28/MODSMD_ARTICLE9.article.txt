# SDS Position
## Call For Strike 
### Leonard Sirgel 
Last month's Vietnam
Moratorium probably had more
active participation than any
single political event in Stanford
history. Though the War
continues, a "moratorium" which
builds each month can help bring
the War to an end. And as it
grows, those involved can become
an active base working for social
change in America.
To grow, the Moratorium—or
the community which
participated in it—must begin to
determine its political direction. It
can emphasize precinct work and
congressional hearings (Bring the
Congressmen home now!) leading
to participation in "Peace"
electoral campaigns; or can
continue to develop as an
independent political force,
emphasizing community
organizing and building toward
direct action.
Whatever direction the
Moratorium takes, it should be
decided by the community which
participated. WE ASK THAT THE
VIETNAM MORATORIUM
COMMITTEE HOLD A
COMMUNITY MEETING ON OR
BEFORE October 31 to plan (he
November Moratorium activities.
The class boycott October 15
reflected the Moratorium slogan
"No business as usual until the
troops are home." It was an act of
conscience. But the act of keeping
ourselves out of class in itself did
very little to effect the war, for
research and training supporting
the war effort continued.
Call For Strike
If we really want to halt "war
business," then we should be
prepared to shut down Stanford.
WE ASK THAT THE
MORATORIUM ACTIVITIES
FOR NOVEMBER INCLUDE A
STRIKE AT STANFORD
Though Stanford as a
University plays a role in
continuing the War, the industries
on Stanford land have a much
bigger role. Lockheed, Varian,
Watkins-Johnson and David
Packard's Hewlett Packard are just
four of the many war factories
and laboratories in the Stanford
Industrial Park, located South of
the main campus.
WE SUGGEST THAT THE
NOVEMBER MORATORIUM
FOCUS ON THE WAR
"DEFENSE" INDUSTRY BY

MARCHING THROUGH OR
HOLDING A RALLY IN THE
STANDORD INDUSTRIAL
PARK ON NOVEMBER 1 4.
Community Education
These activities are suggested as
a complement to the continuing
program of community education.
We would like to see an expansion
of the work being done with
industrial production workers—to
see if work stoppages are possible.
We would like to see some
"peace" organizing done at SRI.
But we don't want to campaign
for Pete McCloskey, Jess Unruh,
or Alan Cranston.
Finally, we would like to see
everyone in the Stanford
community participate in the
November Moratorium and the
November 15 March in San
Francisco, and come to he
community meeting which we
expect soon.
