# Poli Sci Profs React
## Research Ability Rewarded 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
Publication of salary differ
entials between teaching-oriented
and research-oriented political
science professors has generated
mixed reactions, more data and a
request to President Pitzer for
reform.
The political scientists praised
and castigated the disclosure of
the document stolen from Encina
Hall last spring. "I was dis
appointed at the journalistic
standards. During my tenure in
the department there were three
promotions to full professor made
merely because of excellent teach
ing," said Gabriel Almond.
"I don't think I can comment
on that."- Robert Horn.
"I thought the article high
lighted some significant prob
lems."- Hubert Marshall.
"This issue is very hot over
there, so I don't think I had better
comment."—Edward Greenberg.
"When I saw the article in this
morning's paper I figured The
Daily would call and I decided I
should not use the opportunity to
make the department less unified
than it is."—Kurt Steiner.

Despite the general air of
caution, Marshall did not hesitate
to express dissatisfaction with
present salary procedures and to
appeal to Pitzer for change.
"An absolutely resolute presi
dent has the means available to
correct the salary inequities.
Lose Researchers
"It may mean that the presi
dent will from time to time lose
some researchers because he does
not have enough money. But I
think a resolute president needs to
take some risks.
"That means the university
might lose some of its inter
national luster . . . But I think we
can afford that, don't you?" he
said.
Marshall was careful to note he
does not oppose higher salaries for
"competent" research-oriented
professors. His objection is to
salaries inflated beyond measure
ments of competence by inter
university competition.
While members of the political
science department responded to
the publicity, Daily analysis of the
salary recommendation document
uncovered data showing correla

tions between high salaries and
graduate teaching and research
orientation.
Five Over $20,000
Of the fourteen full professors
in political science, five earned
$20,000 or over during the
1968-69 school year. These five
are listed in the 1967-68 Stanford
catalogue as having taught only
four of 35 undergraduate courses
taught by full professors. Salaries
for 1968-69 were predicated on
performance during 1967-68.
Those who taught the re
mainder of the courses all received
less than $18,000.
A December 1967 memoran
dum from the executive head of
the department to the then
Associate Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Lincoln Moses recom
mends no raises for four full
professors. These four were the
lowest paid full professors in the
department. Between them, they
taught almost half of the under
graduate courses taught by full
professors.
Three of the four not only
taught most courses, but> they
were among the top four full
professors in the number of
students instructed.
Higher paid professors were
more heavily concentrated in the
graduate instruction.
Almond attributed the concen
tration to the way in which the
university has developed.
"Probably what happened," he
said, "is that those who are
concentrated at the undergraduate
level are the older members of the
department who were here ten
years ago when Stanford was
primarily an undergraduate insti
tution.
Basic to the controversy over
salaries are the criteria against
which each professor is measured.
The memorandum from Almond
to Moses mentions the standards
of judgement.
It says that teaching, research
productivity, activity with grad
uate students, and activity within
the university community are

criteria for excellence.
Prior to last year, the depart
ment head in political science was
solely responsible for determining
these judgements. The Almond-
Moses memorandum includes
these critiques.
Since then, however, reform
elements in the department have
transplanted the responsibility to
the shoulders of a salary commit
tee composed this year of
Marshall, George, and the new
department head Heinz Eulau.
Their views on the relative impor
tance of the criteria will shape the
salary policies of the next year.
Eulau emphasizes that all four
factors should be considered as a
whole. But he admits, "Given the
nature of the university as one of
the leading research universities in
the country, probably more
emphasis is placed on research.
Maybe, even, one should say most
emphasis is placed there. But one
should then say that a good
researcher is not necessarily a bad
teacher.
"The people who do research
and hence publish become
nationally visible and their salary
is determined by the market."
Eulau continued explaining
that the committee will review
each professor's list of publica
tions by analyzing their yearly
"Report to the President."
The publications are pegged in
importance by the reputation of
the publisher.
Eulau claims that this data
provides a better measure of the
professor than does teaching
because "research is fairly easy to
judge while teaching is more
difficult."
He says it is important to look
for more than teaching ability
because, "Just teaching is a nice
life. You have two office hours
and a light load of classes each
week, and then you go off who
knows where.
"In every university there are
people who drag their heels. God
knows what they are doing. Some
are with it and some are not."

of left-wing intellectuals were discussed. See details in tomorrow's DAILY.

these judgements. The Almond-
Moses memorandum includes
these critiques.
Since then, however, reform
elements in the department have
transplanted the responsibility to
the shoulders of a salary commit
tee composed this year of
Marshall, George, and the new
department head Heinz Eulau.
Their views on the relative impor
tance of the criteria will shape the
salary policies of the next year.
Eulau emphasizes that all four
factors should be considered as a
whole. But he admits, "Given the
nature of the university as one of
the leading research universities in
the country, probably more
emphasis is placed on research.
Maybe, even, one should say most
emphasis is placed there. But one
should then say that a good

"The people who do research
and hence publish become

is determined by the market."
Eulau continued explaining
that the committee will review
each professor's list of publica
tions by analyzing their yearly
"Report to the President."
The publications are pegged in
importance by the reputation of
the publisher.
Eulau claims that this data
provides a better measure of the
professor than does teaching
because "research is fairly easy to
judge while teaching is more
difficult."
He says it is important to look
for more than teaching ability
because, "Just teaching is a nice
life. You have two office hours
and a light load of classes each
week, and then you go off who
knows where.
"In every university there are

Publication of salary differ
entials between teaching-oriented
and research-oriented political
science professors has generated
mixed reactions, more data and a
request to President Pitzer for
reform.
The political scientists praised
and castigated the disclosure of
the document stolen from Encina
Hall last spring. "I was dis
appointed at the journalistic
standards. During my tenure in
the department there were three
promotions to full professor made
merely because of excellent teach
ing," said Gabriel Almond.
"I don't think I can comment

"I thought the article high

"This issue is very hot over

"When I saw the article in this

Despite the general air of
caution, Marshall did not hesitate
to express dissatisfaction with
present salary procedures and to
appeal to Pitzer for change.
"An absolutely resolute presi

"It may mean that the presi

some researchers because he does

think a resolute president needs to
take some risks.
"That means the university

said.
Marshall was careful to note he
does not oppose higher salaries for
"competent" research-oriented
professors. His objection is to
salaries inflated beyond measure

university competition.
While members of the political
science department responded to
the publicity, Daily analysis of the
salary recommendation document
uncovered data showing correla

graduate teaching and research
orientation.
Five Over $20,000
Of the fourteen full professors
in political science, five earned
$20,000 or over during the
1968-69 school year. These five
are listed in the 1967-68 Stanford
catalogue as having taught only
four of 35 undergraduate courses
taught by full professors. Salaries
for 1968-69 were predicated on
performance during 1967-68.
Those who taught the re
mainder of the courses all received
less than $18,000.
A December 1967 memoran
dum from the executive head of
the department to the then
Associate Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Lincoln Moses recom
mends no raises for four full
professors. These four were the
lowest paid full professors in the
department. Between them, they
taught almost half of the under
graduate courses taught by full
professors.
Three of the four not only
taught most courses, but> they
were among the top four full
professors in the number of
students instructed.
Higher paid professors were
more heavily concentrated in the
graduate instruction.
Almond attributed the concen
tration to the way in which the
university has developed.
"Probably what happened," he
said, "is that those who are
concentrated at the undergraduate
level are the older members of the
department who were here ten
years ago when Stanford was
primarily an undergraduate insti
tution.

salaries are the criteria against

$20,000 or over during the
1968-69 school year. These five
are listed in the 1967-68 Stanford
catalogue as having taught only
four of 35 undergraduate courses
taught by full professors. Salaries
for 1968-69 were predicated on
performance during 1967-68.
Those who taught the re
mainder of the courses all received
less than $18,000.
A December 1967 memoran
dum from the executive head of
the department to the then
Associate Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Lincoln Moses recom
mends no raises for four full
professors. These four were the
lowest paid full professors in the
department. Between them, they
taught almost half of the under
graduate courses taught by full
professors.
Three of the four not only
taught most courses, but> they
were among the top four full
professors in the number of
students instructed.
Higher paid professors were
more heavily concentrated in the
graduate instruction.
Almond attributed the concen
tration to the way in which the
university has developed.
"Probably what happened," he
said, "is that those who are
concentrated at the undergraduate
level are the older members of the
department who were here ten
years ago when Stanford was
primarily an undergraduate insti
tution.
Basic to the controversy over
salaries are the criteria against
which each professor is measured.
The memorandum from Almond
to Moses mentions the standards
of judgement.
It says that teaching, research
productivity, activity with grad
uate students, and activity within
the university community are

criteria for excellence.
Prior to last year, the depart
ment head in political science was
solely responsible for determining
these judgements. The Almond-
Moses memorandum includes
these critiques.
Since then, however, reform
elements in the department have
transplanted the responsibility to
the shoulders of a salary commit
tee composed this year of
Marshall, George, and the new
department head Heinz Eulau.
Their views on the relative impor
tance of the criteria will shape the
salary policies of the next year.
Eulau emphasizes that all four
factors should be considered as a
whole. But he admits, "Given the
nature of the university as one of
the leading research universities in
the country, probably more
emphasis is placed on research.
Maybe, even, one should say most
emphasis is placed there. But one
should then say that a good
researcher is not necessarily a bad
teacher.
"The people who do research
and hence publish become
nationally visible and their salary
is determined by the market."
Eulau continued explaining
that the committee will review
each professor's list of publica
tions by analyzing their yearly
"Report to the President."
The publications are pegged in
importance by the reputation of
the publisher.
Eulau claims that this data
provides a better measure of the
professor than does teaching
because "research is fairly easy to
judge while teaching is more
difficult."
He says it is important to look
for more than teaching ability
because, "Just teaching is a nice
life. You have two office hours
and a light load of classes each
week, and then you go off who
knows where.
"In every university there are
people who drag their heels. God
knows what they are doing. Some
are with it and some are not."


MEETING—The New University Conference meet last night in Tresidder Union. The Moratorium and alleged oppression
of left-wing intellectuals were discussed. See details in tomorrow's DAILY.
Publication of salary differ
entials between teaching-oriented
and research-oriented political
science professors has generated
mixed reactions, more data and a
request to President Pitzer for
reform.
The political scientists praised
and castigated the disclosure of
the document stolen from Encina
Hall last spring. "I was dis
appointed at the journalistic
standards. During my tenure in
the department there were three
promotions to full professor made
merely because of excellent teach
ing," said Gabriel Almond.
"I don't think I can comment
on that."- Robert Horn.
"I thought the article high
lighted some significant prob
lems."- Hubert Marshall.
"This issue is very hot over
there, so I don't think I had better
comment."—Edward Greenberg.
"When I saw the article in this
morning's paper I figured The
Daily would call and I decided I
should not use the opportunity to
make the department less unified
than it is."—Kurt Steiner.

Despite the general air of
caution, Marshall did not hesitate
to express dissatisfaction with
present salary procedures and to
appeal to Pitzer for change.
"An absolutely resolute presi
dent has the means available to
correct the salary inequities.
Lose Researchers
"It may mean that the presi
dent will from time to time lose
some researchers because he does
not have enough money. But I
think a resolute president needs to
take some risks.
"That means the university
might lose some of its inter
national luster . . . But I think we
can afford that, don't you?" he
said.
Marshall was careful to note he
does not oppose higher salaries for
"competent" research-oriented
professors. His objection is to
salaries inflated beyond measure
ments of competence by inter
university competition.
While members of the political
science department responded to
the publicity, Daily analysis of the
salary recommendation document
uncovered data showing correla

tions between high salaries and
graduate teaching and research
orientation.
