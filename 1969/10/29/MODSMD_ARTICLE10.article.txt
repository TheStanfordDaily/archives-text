# Misinterpretation
## Snell's Blunders 
### David Axelrad 
The Daily has committed an
incredible blunder by publishing
Dan Snell's letter from Israel
(Daily, Oct. 23). In an interview
with Christian missionary A. Paul
McGarvey, Mr. Snell presents
information which is almost
totally untrue.
The first contention of any
importance is that missionary
activity in Israel is severely
limited. Mr. McGarvey asserts that
missionaries "caught"
proselytizing among .Jews are not
granted new visas. Further, he
states that there is a legal quota of
missionaries (based on the number
each denomination maintained in
1948). These statements are false,
having no foundatior in Israeli law
or practice. On the contrary, the
Ministry of Religious Affai' in
Jerusalem is specifically charged
with insuring the freedom of all
religious groups, a freedom which
has been guaranteed since the
creation of the State. I need not
go further in this matter; I simply
challenge Mr. Snell to provide one
factual example of either charge.
Mr. McGarvey next tries to
imply that Israel is anxious to see
Christians leave the country. He
asserts that it is extremely easy
for Christians to emigrate since
the "government doesn't ask any
questions" of those who affirm
their Christianity. Rather than
being a snide implication this
statement is actually indicative of
a service provided to Christian
citizens. Any Israeli is permitted
to leave the country when he
chooses (although there are some
restrictions for soldiers). It
happens that many Christians who
wish to leave are sponsored by
various churches in other
countries, churches which require
legal certification of an
individual's religious preference.
Israeli courts certify these

depositions (as in Mr. McGarvey's
example) in order to comply with
the desires of individual citizens.
Parenthetically, it is interesting
that an Israeli never loses his
citizenship regardless of where he
does or what he does.
Israeli Discrimination
Mr. McGarvey now makes a
most grievous error, charging the
Israelis with discrimination
against Christians seeking
employment. This charge is also
false. The Jews have been trying
to escape this discrimination for
2000 years. In the land they
created everyone who is capable
of working will have a job unless
there is an economic shortage of
employment. In fact, Israel is one
of the few countries in the world
which does not require a labor
permit of its citizens, a permit
which the United States does
require. In his case I also challenge
Mr. Snell to provide a concrete
example of this fantasy.
The trouble with Dan Snell is
that he is both ignorant of Israeli
life and a very poor judge of
character. According to the article
Mr. McGarvey has only been in
Israel one year; he does not even
speak the language of the people
there. Disgruntled and
disillusioned at the small size of
his flock, he "looks out
occasionally on the miniscule
green garden behind the church,"
probably dreaming of his return
to the United States, which he
mentioned to Mr. Snell in the
article. A man so new, so
unsettled, and so obviously bitter
could not be a fair judge of Israeli
domestic life. Poor Dan is going to
have to be more perceptive if he
expects to report an accurate
picture of the State of Israel.

depositions (as in Mr. McGarvey's
example) in order to comply with
the desires of individual citizens.
Parenthetically, it is interesting
that an Israeli never loses his
citizenship regardless of where he
does or what he does.
Israeli Discrimination
Mr. McGarvey now makes a
most grievous error, charging the
Israelis with discrimination
against Christians seeking
employment. This charge is also
false. The Jews have been trying
to escape this discrimination for
2000 years. In the land they
created everyone who is capable
of working will have a job unless
there is an economic shortage of
employment. In fact, Israel is one
of the few countries in the world
which does not require a labor
permit of its citizens, a permit
which the United States does
require. In his case I also challenge
Mr. Snell to provide a concrete
example of this fantasy.
The trouble with Dan Snell is
that he is both ignorant of Israeli
life and a very poor judge of
character. According to the article
Mr. McGarvey has only been in
Israel one year; he does not even
speak the language of the people
there. Disgruntled and
disillusioned at the small size of
his flock, he "looks out
occasionally on the miniscule
green garden behind the church,"
probably dreaming of his return
to the United States, which he
mentioned to Mr. Snell in the
article. A man so new, so
unsettled, and so obviously bitter
could not be a fair judge of Israeli
domestic life. Poor Dan is going to
have to be more perceptive if he
expects to report an accurate
picture of the State of Israel.

The Daily has committed an
incredible blunder by publishing
Dan Snell's letter from Israel
(Daily, Oct. 23). In an interview
with Christian missionary A. Paul
McGarvey, Mr. Snell presents
information which is almost
totally untrue.
The first contention of any
importance is that missionary
activity in Israel is severely
limited. Mr. McGarvey asserts that
missionaries "caught"
proselytizing among .Jews are not
granted new visas. Further, he
states that there is a legal quota of
missionaries (based on the number
each denomination maintained in
1948). These statements are false,
having no foundatior in Israeli law
or practice. On the contrary, the
Ministry of Religious Affai' in
Jerusalem is specifically charged
with insuring the freedom of all
religious groups, a freedom which
has been guaranteed since the
creation of the State. I need not
go further in this matter; I simply
challenge Mr. Snell to provide one
factual example of either charge.
Mr. McGarvey next tries to
imply that Israel is anxious to see
Christians leave the country. He
asserts that it is extremely easy
for Christians to emigrate since
the "government doesn't ask any
questions" of those who affirm
their Christianity. Rather than
being a snide implication this
statement is actually indicative of
a service provided to Christian
citizens. Any Israeli is permitted
to leave the country when he
chooses (although there are some
restrictions for soldiers). It
happens that many Christians who
wish to leave are sponsored by
various churches in other
countries, churches which require
legal certification of an
individual's religious preference.
