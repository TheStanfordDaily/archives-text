# "Z" Rated Tops...
## Revolutionary Film Highlights Festival 
### TODD McCARTHY 
I would wager that the
pie-pitching Pierrot's (or at least
their cohorts) on opening night
of the San Francisco Film Festival
were among those most
vociferously leading the two
minute standing ovation which
followed the revolutionary Z on
Saturday night, thus rendering the
pastry pranks indefensibly
hypocritical.
Perhaps I lack the necessary
humor in regard to the whole
affair, but in that my first
awareness of any turmoil on
Wednesday night came upon
witnessing, at dangerously close
range, one of the clowns being
pushed through a plate glass
window (and sustaining head
injuries requiring 15 stitches). I
was perhaps less amused than I
might otherwise have been as I
watched San Francisco society try
to look sophisticated while
drenched in a mass of meringue.
Nonetheless, Mack Sennet
inspired the best part of the
evening, for Stanley Kramer's The
Secret of Santa Victoria, while
free of any overblown messages,
was quite tiresome. The audience
loved it, though, just as audiences
loved The Sound of Music, Guess
'Who's Coming to Dinner, and The
Love-Bug. Kramer's picture is
aimed to illicit 12 year-old
emotional responses and contains
the hammiest acting since Lion in
Winter. The premiere party at
the Fairmont was just as big a
drag. Old lady: "Are you with the
Mayor's party?" (No ma'am, do I
really look like a mafioso?)
Frederick Wiseman's
controversial documentary High
School perceptively analyzes (and
condemns) America's public

school system by focusing on a
middle class Jewish institution in
Philadelphia. The problems of the
students are all too recognizable
and the need for reform, if not
upheavel, undeniable, but
Wiseman perhaps overlooks the
strain on ill-equipped teachers to
challenge and stimulate already
apathetic teenagers.
Unfortunately, Wiseman's vision is
just a bit too biased to be
considered the last word on the
subject.

I suppose director Barbet
Schroeder can consider himself
lucky, for though his film More is,
for the most part, ineffectively
acted, vaguely written and
emotionally and morally
deficient, it got to me in a
disturbing way. Even though it
accepts the world of drugs, sun
worshippers and free love as a fact
of life and not a deviation, More is
a more severe indictment on drug
use than such "social dilemma"
pictures as Man with the Golden

Arm. The ending seems like a
rejection of the very principles
and beliefs on which the film is
based, thus rendering the project
curiously self-defeating. But a film
which is masochistic not only in
content but in its own attitude
toward itself is somehow
intriguing.
Saturday was a truly
extraordinary day at the festival,
starting as it did at 10:30 a.m.
with a showing of glorious The
Adventures o! Robin Hood in its

original 35mm technicolor print.
These film academicians who
think color has just begun to be
used with creativity by Antonioni,
Fellini, etc., ought to see what
Michael Curtiz and William
Keighley were doing back in the
Thirties.
The selection of film clips in
the John Schlesinger retrospective
proved beyong a doubt the
director's brillance with actors.
However, it also lay bare a talent
whose art has become more
visually cluttered and emotionally
oblique with each film. Billy Liar
and Darling remain highly
creditable achievements and
timely revivals of both A Kind of
Loving and Far From the Madding
Crowd would appear very much in
order.
Satyajit Ray's The Adventures
of Goopy and Bagha was an
absolute delight for the first hour
but then became unnecessarily
distended as the many plot
contrivances had to be explained
away. Fortunately, he film ended
on a high note with, quite
literally, a surge of color. Ray is a
master story teller and here uses
rather naive special effects to
charming effect.
Z is the best film I've seen at
the Masonic in two years of
festival going. Due to limited
space, a more detailed analysis
will have to come at a later day,
but the film strikes me as a
perfect example of a work which
is relevant and exciting both
politically and artistically. The
feeling of unanimity amongst the
audience in its overwhelming
response to this picture merely
re-enforced my affection for the
festival, as attendance is definitely
something more than "going to
the movies."
