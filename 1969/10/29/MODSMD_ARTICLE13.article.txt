# Director of Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid Aims At Variety
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
George Roy Hill is a handsome,
very friendly man, whose son
wants to go to Stanford next year
and who directed one of the most
entertaining movies released so far
this year, Hutch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid.
Hill was briefly grounded in
San Francisco in the midst of
flying his own plane across the
country on a promotional tour
when he succumbed to he
questioning of a Daily reporter.
The director immediately wanted
to make clear that he did not steal
from Bonnie and Clyde, Jules and
Jim or The Wild Bunch on his
present picture, as the project has
been in the planning stages for six
years. "Actually, I was the first to

use slow motion in a feature film
since Leni Riefenstahl's Olympiad
in 1936," referring to The World
of Henry Orient which, along with
Butch Cassidy, is his favorite
among his films.
Hill is quick to dismiss the
auteur theory as irresponsible and
denies the importance of a
"consistant theme" in a director's
work. "After all, variety is what
makes movies, and life, exciting."
This philosophy is immediately
borne out by the director's track
record. Henry Orient was a light
comedy and frankly captures the
atmosphere of New York more
accurately than any of the many
other subsequent films shot on
location there. Hill prefers not to
talk about Hawaii, for he was

brought into the project just two
weeks before shooting began. He
was then fired midway over
"artistic differences" with the
producer, but it is to Hill's credit
that the entire cast refused to
continue work unless the director
was re-hired.
Hill's original cut of
Thoroughly Modern Millie was
one hour and 50 minutes, but the
film was then taken out of his
hands and loaded down with
additional sequences in order to
fit so-called roadshow
classifications. Thus, what was
initially a delightful "cream puff"
of a picture was transformed into
another over-long extravaganza.
By contrast, Butch Cassidy, was
originally two hours and 45
minutes but fortunately, Hill was
permitted to oversee recutting and
is totally satisfied with the final
version.
"I screened more than 50 old
westerns before starting work on
Butch Cassidyâ€”l didn't want the
traditional stuff one usually sees
in these films." Hill was especially
intent on creating a special "look"
for this picture and feels he found
the perfect collaborater in
cameraman Conrad Hall. "Hall is
probably the best cameraman in
Hollywood. The old pros are good
inside the studio, but if you want

a special camera effect, they'll
say, "Let me shoot it my way and
you do what you want in the
lab." Hall knew exactly the kind
of washed-out color I wanted so
we got in in the first place by
simply over-exposing by a couple
of stops."
An interesting note is the
progression of casts planned for
Butch Cassidy. Originally, Jack
Lemmon was to have played
Butch with Paul Newman as the
kid. However, Lemmon became
scared off by the part and bowed
out. "It was very difficult to
persuade Paul to play Butch, for
he had always conceived of Jack
in the role." He was finally
convinced and though Steve
McQueen was thought of for the
kid, Robert Redford was brought
in and was provided with the
biggest break in his career.
Hill has been more fortunate
than some of his young directorial
colleagues in that most of his
films have been financially
successful and he now maintains a
high degree of control over the
choice and handling of projects.
Next on the list is Listen to the
Silence, a psychological drama.
After that will be Indians, based
on the current controversial
Broadway hit, in which Paul
Newman will portray a radically
different Buffalo Bill.
