„ Saturday's Airplane and Dead
concert at Winterland turned into
a spontaneous music festival. And
as many people had been turned
away earlier in the night for lack
of room, Bill Graham announced
that all the performers, Hot Tuna,
,J"he Sons, The Greatful Dead,
Steve Stills and Graham Nash, the
Airplane, and Glen McKay's
Headlights, would be back on
Sunday night to do the whole
thing over again.
Hot Tuna, Yourma's and
Cassidy's new group, appeared for
the first time at Winterland as a
solid blues group. Both of them
have been jamming around
City for a while and the group,
with a heavier sound than I
expected, featured the interaction
between Cassidy's bass and
Yourma's guitar.
The last two groups on the bill
that night were the Dead and the
Airplane, and these two members
of the "First Wave" of San
Francisco groups are still the best.
Both have stayed together,
resolved personal problems, have
jammed with others (Riders of the
Purple Sage and Hot Tuna) and
both groups are friends (as
Cassidy and Lesh get together and
copy licks from each other).
Saturday night, the Dead were
the best I've seen them—they were
the greatest. They came on stage
doing "Good Lovin" (the old
Rascal song) and from the start,
they were together with a sort of
enthusiasm: a powerful crowd and
the presence with them of another
guitar and voice, Steve Stills,

seeming to be the reasons. Stills,
by his presence alone, seemed to
give some life to the Dead.
The Dead didn't wander
around, but each song evolved
perfectly out of the previous song.
During St. Stephen, they went
into their quietest and most
extended instrumental of the
night. It captured the crowd's
emotions for their final song,
"Turri on Your Love-Light." This
old song has been revived by the
Dead as their last and powerful
number. The group, behind
Pigpen's vocals, takes off on some
complex instrumental breaks from
the song's simple chord pattern.
.The night and "Love-Light" was
the Dead at their best.
At the end of the Dead, we
were surprised as Steve Stills and
Graham Nash decided to come on
stage and play some new songs.
Playing acoustic guitars, they left
the soft Crosby, Stills, Nash, and
Young format and got into more
of a blues thing, with Stiles voice
coming across strongest.
The Airplane finished off the
night with one of their best sets;
Yourma's guitar being on that
night as well as the vocals. They
did a lot of songs from their new
album, Volunteers, with one of
the best being "Wooden Ships,"
dedicated to one of its authors,
Steve Stills, who sat on the side of
the stage the whole set. As the
Airplane finished "Other Side of
This Life" around 4:30 (on the
old time system) in the morning,
we all walked out of one of the
most spontaneous music festivals
in San Francisco.

solid blues group. Both of them
have been jamming around
City for a while and the group,
with a heavier sound than I
expected, featured the interaction
between Cassidy's bass and
Yourma's guitar.
The last two groups on the bill
that night were the Dead and the
Airplane, and these two members
of the "First Wave" of San
Francisco groups are still the best.
Both have stayed together,
resolved personal problems, have
jammed with others (Riders of the
Purple Sage and Hot Tuna) and
both groups are friends (as
Cassidy and Lesh get together and
copy licks from each other).
Saturday night, the Dead were
the best I've seen them—they were
the greatest. They came on stage
doing "Good Lovin" (the old
Rascal song) and from the start,
they were together with a sort of
enthusiasm: a powerful crowd and
the presence with them of another
guitar and voice, Steve Stills,

seeming to be the reasons. Stills,
by his presence alone, seemed to
give some life to the Dead.
The Dead didn't wander
around, but each song evolved
perfectly out of the previous song.
During St. Stephen, they went
into their quietest and most
extended instrumental of the
night. It captured the crowd's
emotions for their final song,
"Turri on Your Love-Light." This
old song has been revived by the
Dead as their last and powerful
number. The group, behind
Pigpen's vocals, takes off on some
complex instrumental breaks from
the song's simple chord pattern.
.The night and "Love-Light" was
the Dead at their best.
At the end of the Dead, we
were surprised as Steve Stills and
Graham Nash decided to come on
stage and play some new songs.
Playing acoustic guitars, they left
the soft Crosby, Stills, Nash, and
Young format and got into more
of a blues thing, with Stiles voice
coming across strongest.
The Airplane finished off the
night with one of their best sets;
Yourma's guitar being on that
night as well as the vocals. They
did a lot of songs from their new
album, Volunteers, with one of
the best being "Wooden Ships,"
dedicated to one of its authors,
Steve Stills, who sat on the side of
the stage the whole set. As the
Airplane finished "Other Side of
This Life" around 4:30 (on the
old time system) in the morning,
we all walked out of one of the
most spontaneous music festivals
in San Francisco.
„ Saturday's Airplane and Dead
concert at Winterland turned into
a spontaneous music festival. And
as many people had been turned
away earlier in the night for lack
of room, Bill Graham announced
that all the performers, Hot Tuna,
,J"he Sons, The Greatful Dead,
Steve Stills and Graham Nash, the
Airplane, and Glen McKay's
Headlights, would be back on
Sunday night to do the whole
thing over again.
