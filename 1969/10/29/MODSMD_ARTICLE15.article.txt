# Radicals Discuss Leftist Movements
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
The political unbrella "radical
viewpoint" encompassed a wide
range of opinions Monday night in
a panel discussion at Bishop
Auditorium. Participants in the
SDS sponsored program
represented anarchists, the "youth
culture movement," the
Progressive Labor Party (PLP), the
Revolutionary Union, and the
Stanford New Left.
Bill Evers, representing the
anarchist's, advocated "Social
revolution producing a society
based on voluntary association, a
free society of voluntary
communities."
"We are not opposed to
organization," he said, "but
opposed to rule." Explaining how
he viewed the other groups, Evers
said, "The radical movement has
from its inception acted
anarchistically." He noted that,
"decentralist and anti-author
itarian aspects are what makes the
New Left new."
Alliance Proposed
Ivo Banac, speaking from an
opposing viewpoint, called for a
student-worker alliance leading to
the emergence of a socialist world.
Representing the PLP,, he
denounced all contemporary
nationalism as reactionary and
notedthat the National Liberation
Front is betraying the
Vietnamese.

Exclaiming, "I can't dig this,"
Bruce Rappaport began his speech
by suggesting the audience break
into small groups which could
relate to the speakers easier, but
the audience refused.
Head Changing Needed
He disclaimed the need to
immediately erect new political
and economic institutions. He said
the final goal of "changing
peoples heads" should be the
primary force in youth. "We must
change the basic ways people
relate to each other."
Beginning with a criticism of
Rappaport's views, English
professor Bruce Franklin
presented the position of the
Marxist-Leninist Revolutionary
Union. He charged that it is easy
for affluent Americans to talk
about "changing peoples heads
and to disregard heavy intellectual
ideas, but for most of the world
these ideas are matters of life and
death."
Experimental Outlook
Lenard Siegal, speaking for the
New Left, said that Stanford SDS
is taking an experimental outlook.
He said that conditions in
America today are unique and,
"contemporary society guides us
better than historical outlooks."
Siegal also stated, "Repression
is based on capitalism and a
concentration of power and
wealth. Until we have a national
ethic of cooperation, we cannot
have a socialist society."
He emphasized that SDS is
taking a flexible approach. "As we
build a revolution, we must
experiment on social forms which
will form the new society."
