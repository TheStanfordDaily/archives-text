# SDS Sets Chaplin Films
## 
### 
Charlie Chaplin is most famous
for his accomplishments on the
screen. But there is another aspect
to Chaplin—the politics he
developed during his life.
Tonight and tomorrow night
SDS will sponsor screenings of
two of his most important films:
"The Great Dictator" and
"Modern Times."
"Dictator" was made during
one of the great crises in human
history: the rise of Hitler's
Germany. Typical of Chaplin, the
satire is caustic and the humor is
both slap-stick and deep. Most
powerful is the final scene, in
which Charlie thwarts "hymkel's"
juggernaut and makes an appeal
directly to his audience.

Tomorrow night the Stanford
community will see another side
of Chaplin's politics. The Left has
often spoken of the oppressive
nature of American society and
the key role that labor must play
in remaking it. "Modern Times" is
Chaplin's statement of this theme;
his wit and the use of his medium
sparkle.
The comedian received
tremendous criticism in the
United States for the political
nature of his films and for his own
outspoken views. In his
autobiography, Chaplin sums up
to antagonism he met in this
country:
"Although I am not a
Communist I refused to fall in line
by hating them. This, of course,
has offended many, including the
American Legion . . .When the
legionnaires go beyond their
legitimate rights, and under the
guise of patriotism use their
power to encroach upon others,
then they commit an offense
against the fundamental structure
of American government. Such
superpatriots could be the cells to
turn America into a fascist state."
Both films will be shown in the
Physics Tank, Room 100, at 7:30
and 9:30. SDS is asking a
donation of 75c for each
screening.
