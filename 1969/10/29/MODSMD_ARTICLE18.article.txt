# Sternglass To Speak
## 
### 
Professor Ernest Sternglass of
the University of Pittsburgh will
speak tonight on "Evidence for
the Correlation Between Nuclear
Weapons Testing and Infant
Mortality Rates in the United
States."
Prof. Sternglass' ideas have
prompted wide interest and
controversy ever since he
expressed them early this year.
The correlation, if correct,
could have improtant implications
for the Plowshare programs for
peaceful uses of nuclear
explosions and for underground
testing of weapons such as the
ABM.
Prof. Sternglass also says that
studies such as the ones that led
to his suggested correlations are
also important in the disposal of
radioactive waste from nuclear
power plants.
The talk is set for 8:30 p.m. in
Room 101 of the Varian Physics
Building and is sponsored by the
Stanford Chapter of Scientists and
Engineers for Social and Political
Action.
Questions and open discussion
are planned following his speech.
