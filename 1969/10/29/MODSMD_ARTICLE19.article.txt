# Lose, 8-5
## Hockey Team Improves 
### 
Only a streak of incredibly bad
luck in the middle of the final
period prevented the Stanford
hockey team from chalking up its
first win of the season Monday
night as they bowed to the San
Francisco Hawks, 8-5, at Legg's
Arena in the City.
Ahead, 4-3, and apparently
well in control with only 12
minutes to go in the game, the
redshirts watched their upset
hopes go out the window as three
consecutive Hawk goals over a

four minute period were scored
on caroms and deflections off
legs, skates, and sticks of
scrambling Indian defenders.
A new defensive system
installed by player-coach Fuller
Torrey to correct some of the
flaws so obvious in last week's
disaster was responsible for much
of the improvement. But more
apparent was the fact that the
Cards were skating hard from the
opening face-off. Stanford scored
the first two goals, and had per d
leads of 3-1 and 4-2.
Another encouraging note Was
the wide geographic advantage the
team held even after the third
period calamity, as they fought
back in a vain attempt to get the
equalizing goals. Dick Toad, Pat
Baldwin, Torrey, Eddie Leonard,
and Paul Tittmann each tallied
once for the Indians.
Now that the first round is
completed, two general
observations can be made. First,
in point of recent team skating
time, and the resulting physical
conditioning and mutual player
familiarity, Stanford started way
behind the other three teams. This
deficiency should be lessened as
time goes on.
Secondly, although the Indians
do not have anyone in the same

class as San Francisco's Jack
Leach, former Boston University
All-American, or Eddie
Panagabko, the ex-pro now
playing with Belmont, as a team
they do have sufficient talent to
compete.
The thrashing administered by
Berkeley last week was probably
typical; Stanford should win its
share of games as the season
progresses.
Beginning November 4, the
Indians will be at home on four
consecutive Tuesdays. Home
games are played at "Iceland,"
one block east of El Camino and
one block north of Ralston
Avenue in Belmont. All games
start at 8:00 p.m.; admission is
free.
