# Interest, Confusion Greet Salary Lists
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
The reaction to Monday's illicit
publication of faculty salaries and
evaluations was one of confusion,
tight-lipped responses, and a
tremendous curiousity to know
what professors really do make.
Radical students were reluctant
to talk for the most part. Yet
those who would talk said only
that they had no idea who had
put out the 31-page document.
They all seemed to agree,
however, that both the faculty
salary information and evaluations
were stolen during the May 1
occupation of Encina.
Administrators yesterday also
stated that the faculty evaluation
sheets (which were originally
thought to have been located
elsewhere) were probably from
Encina.
Confusion was the keynote of
the administration's reaction.
Hurried meetings, many refusals
to speak to Daily reporters, and a
fear that the Daily was going to
publish the entire list of faculty
salaries were prominent in the
day's activities.
For most students, the main
reaction was one of curiosity. For
the first time in Stanford history,
students had a chance to learn
how the faculty rated each other.
Administration
Among the administrators and
deans there was a mixed feeling
about the Monday morning
release of the previously
confidential data. Dean of
Students Peter Bulkley expressed
a common opinion when he noted
that employers usually try to keep
two things secret: their customers
and the wages they pay their
employees.
Prof. William Clebsch,
chairman of the faculty Senate,
said yesterday:"The tactics by
which this information has been
published are entirely deplorable.
First, they are underhanded.
Second, they obviously intend to
embarrass the University rather
than inform the public. Third,
their net effect, predictably, will
be to delay the time when the
University can and will do what I
have always felt it should doâ€”that
is to publish actual, not just
average, faculty and

administrative salary scales
without reference to individuals."
Defense of Salaries
Other faculty members were
suddenly forced to defend their
departments salary structure. For
example, students for the first
time found out that in 1968-69,
ten of the eleven professors of
economics received over $20,000
a year. Only the medical school
paid such high salaries.
Robert McKinnon, executive
department head defended the
high salaries saying, "That's what
the market demands for
economists: even with this pay
cale we've lot a number of well
known scholars.
"We've slipped relatively in the
past ten years. We pay much less
than Yale, Chicago, Harvard, MIT
and company." He criticized the
illegal publication of the salaries
and opposed any future
publication of salaries.
"Publication of salaries would
reduce our flexibility in getting
and holding people," he declared.
Others weren't quite as sure
that publication of faculty salaries
would be detrimental. H. Thomas
James, dean of the school of
education, declared that "The
great public institutions of the
Midwest have long published this
sort of data: I think people here
would be ble to live with it."
Dean Joseph Pettit of the
engineering school agreed that the
loss of secrecy involved isn't
really that important. But he
disagreed with any conclusions
which condemn university policy
because science professors are too
well paid.
"Rationalization of salaries
between departments may be
difficult to accomplish. Among
the professions, a marketplace
phenomenon exists: but, among
scholars this is not true."
He said that he works with
department heads on individual
salaries and that he advises them
of the salaries that professors in
other departments receive,
without naming names.
Both Barry Askinas and Pat
Shea of the ASSU Council of
Presidents expressed a desire for
wide distribution of the salary
lists. Askinas said, "Why doesn't
everyone have a copy? I wish I
did. I'd like one. That stuff could
be devastating."
