# First Tribe Loss
## Bruins Trip Runners 
### FRED LEESON 
Stanford lost its first cross
country race of the season
Saturday morning, falling a single
point short of UCLA in a
magnificent race on the dewy
fairways of the Stanford golf
course.
At the end, Bruin Ron Fister
kicked back a strong challenge
from Stanford's Robert Coe to
cinch at 27-28 decision, handing
the Tribe its first dual meet loss in
two seasons under Coach Marshall
Clark.
For four miles each team had
its first five runners bunched
together, all ten running stride for
stride. UCLA managed to stay
together better than Stanford in
tho final two miles, and scored

with a 14 4 second gap for its top
five at the finish.
Coe, Arvid Kretz and Chuck
Menz placed two, three and four
only three seconds apart, but the
Bruins swept places five through
eight, leaving Jack Lawson and
Greg Brock to end the Indian
scoring in ninth and tenth.
"Performance-wise it was our
best meet of the year," Clark said
afterward, "but they (UCLA) held
together much better than I
thought they would. They didn't
break."
After four stunning miles, Coe,
Kretz, Menz, Brock and Don
Kardong were all running between
20:04 and 20:06, and five Bruins
were right with them. Brock and

Kardong slipped back during the
final two miles, leaving UCLA
running ahead five men to three.
With a mile left Kretz picked
up the Stanford pace and sparked
the Indian 2-3-4 finish, but it still
fell a point shy.
Fister's winning time was
29:51.6 and Coe, Kretz and Menz
followed at 29:54, 56 and 57.
Sophomore Lawson, scoring for
the first time in a varsity race, was
ninth at 30:16 and Brock was
tenth at 30:22. Decker
Underwood and Kardong
followed in 11th and 12th place.
"The bubble broke a little,"
Clark said, even though Stanford
times were good. With four
runners under 30 minutes
for six miles in one race, Clark
indicated that "it will take more
to win the conference than we
thought."
A better indication of league
strength will come this weekend
when Washington State and
Oregon, powers of the north, will
run full strength against each
other. Stanford will not face
either of those teams until the
Pac-8 championship race to be run
here late in November.
Meanwhile, the Indians would
like to return to the winning side
Saturday in San Jose when they
challenge the Spartans on a course
which will be about 4.5 miles.
