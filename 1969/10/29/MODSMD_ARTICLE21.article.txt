# Kickers Drop Pair
## 
### 
Last week the Stanford Indians
soccer team invaded the Santa
Clara Bronco's corral sometimes
known as "Buck Shaw Stadium,"
and got kicked right back to the
Farm.
With one minute and 47
seconds left in the second
overtime period, a Stanford
defender was caught fouling a
Bronco. A direct free kick, a goal,
and it was all over for the Indians.
Santa Clara had beaten Stanford,
2-1, for the first time in the long
history of soccer relations.
Going into the game, the Tribe
was favored; but Santa Clara soon
turned it into a kick and run
match. Stanford forgot their skills
and tried to out kick the Santa
Clarans, but they were no match
for the more rugged home team.
At times the game resembled a
free for all with the referees
allowing the game to get out of
control, fouling was ignored,

players went for the man and not
the ball. When the referees did
regain control, a Santa Clara
player was ejected from the game
and many on both sides were
cautioned.
All of the scoring was done in
the first quarter, with the
Bronco's getting the first score,
and a few minutes later Alan
Houghton evened it for the
Indians on an assist from Linus
Lau. The remaining three quarters
were scoreless as was the first
overtime period. Then came the
fateful free kick and the Tribe
record dropped to 3-2-0. On
Saturday, the record fell even
farther.
The team suffered its second
loss in a week, meeting a strong,
well balanced and skillful UCLA
team which was unbeaten and
winners of the All California
tournament. They remained
unbeaten, clobbering the Indians,
8-0.
Stanford was able to force
UCLA to play their type of game
early in the contest. Then, for
some reason, the Indians started
to concede almost every loose ball
to the Bruins.
On Wednesday Stanford meets
Cal State, Hay ward, at 1:00 p.m.
on Maloney Field.
