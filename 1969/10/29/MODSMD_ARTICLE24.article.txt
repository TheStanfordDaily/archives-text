# Black Artists Display Works
## 
### 
Works of two prominent black
painters, John Yeates and
Langston Bowen, are on display
through October at Florence
Moore Hall.
Yeates, a Menlo Park resident
and member of the Palo Alto Art
Club, has received several awards
for his work. He is interested in
teaching techniques of art and
watercolors, especially to
children, and has helped organize
a local children's art class.
Yeates' paintings have been on
display in several local galleries as
well as in the studio he opened in
1959.
Bowen has been internationally
acclaimed for his locally

developed technique of mixing
native sands and earth colors to
form a "bas-relief design."
He teaches junior high school
currently in Pacifica. His work is
mainly centered in African art,
but he also draws inspriation from
ancient Mexican motifs.
Bowen believes "art can be a
powerful vehicle for
communication among mankind.
One of the highest goals of an
artist is to use his gift to point out
the universality and brotherhood
of man."
Works by both artists will be
displayed in a special showing at
the Stafford Research Institute in
May, 1970.
