# Republicans Tour Campus, Discuss Education Problems
## 
### JOHN BOWEN 
In an effort to bridge the
"communication gap" between
college students and the
government, a team of California
state legislators has begun a tour
of universities throughout the
state. Yesterday, Stanford was the
"kickoff" campus, visited by
three of those legislators.
After a lunch in the student
residences and a meeting with
President Pitzer, they attended a
press conference for Bay Area
newspapers in Tresidder Union.
Assemblyman Frank Murphy,
Jr. of Santa Cruz began by
outlining the purposes of their
visit. "As Republicans, we have an
obligation, that has perhaps not
been lived up to in the past, to
communicate with the young
people in our constituency."
The senior member of the
group, Assemblyman Craig Biddle
of Riverside, had a number of
comments on the
"communication gap." He found
"an emotional rather than an
intellectual gap. If this continues,
the only one that will be hurt will
be the university." He hoped,
however, that student response to
the committee's activities would
be good enough to allow the
continuation of such visits on a
regular basis.
Tuition Discussed
The third member of the group
at Stanford was Assemblyman

George Milias of Santa Clara
County. Mr. Milias fielded
questions concerning tuition at
the state colleges and universities.
He explained that a decision to
enact tuition would come from
the Board of Regents, not from
the legislatures, and then observed
that "the legislature has been
enacting a number of proposals
that have increased the financial
aid to persons of lower-income
families." Based on this trend, "I
wouldn't be surprised to see a
more effective policy of aids
accompany a tuition change."
The legislators next attended a
forum on "The Future of Higher
Education in California" in the
Tresidder lounge. Although there
was a very poor turnout for the
program, all three legislators
participated in debate with the
several students present.
The focus of the forum fell on
two key issues: the role of the
legislator in allocating funds for
higher education, and the
questions involved in the
responsibility of the public
university, particularly in the
recent case of Angela Davis at
UCLA.

The three legislators were first
asked: "Aside from the question
of the conflict between
Chancellor Young and the Board
of Regents, do you think that a
Communist should be allowed to

teach in a state university?" Mr.
Biddle replied: "No." Mr. Murphy
said "I am totally behind the
thinking of the Board of
Regents." Mr. Milias' statement
was that "I think that there are
plenty of other teachers to hire."
Mr. Biddle then elaborated on
his earlier comment by stating
that "the issue isn't Angela Davis,
it's who is running the
universities. The Chancellor had
an economic responsibility to fire
Miss Davis when ordered to do so
by his boss, the Board."
Mr. Biddle's statement was
then challenged from the floor.
"Chancellor Young had a moral
and legal responsibility to obey
the constitution and hence
disobey the unconstitutional
directive of the Regents." The
Assemblyman's reply was that the
unconstitutionality of the specific
Board policy was never actually
established.
The Legislators also discussed
the many conflicting pressures on
them to allocate in different ways
the budgetary "pie."
Assemblyman Murphy stated that
"careful legislative examination of
the university budgets is for the
purpose of improving, not of
hampering the university,
whatever the critics may say."
The overall reception to the
Assemblymen was, according to
Mr. Murphy, "courteous,
somewhat reserved, probing."
