# University Weighs Legal Move Against Pay Scale Publication
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
The Stanford administration is
prepared to bring legal action
against any publication choosing
to reprint the salary lists and
faculty raise recommendations
anonymously distributed on
campus Monday morning.
In a flurry of hastily-arranged
conferences yesterday afternoon,
top administration officials
decided that the documents
apparently stolen from Encina
Hall files during last May's sit-in
were of a deeply confidential
nature.
Present at the meetings were
President Kenneth Pitzer, Provost
Richard Lyman, presidential
assistants Fred Glover and Willard
Wyman, News Service Director
Bob Beyers, Director of
University Relatioas Lyle Nelson,

and university legal counsel Daryl
Dawson.
University officials made it
clear that they were most
concerned about the confidential
comments from five department
chairmen evaluating professors
within the department.
Dissemination of such privileged
information, they feel, might
seriously hamper "honest and
complete evaluation in the
future."
Anonymous Pamphlet
The anonymously-printed
pamphlet revealed salary levels
from President Pitzer to staff
clerks. It documented the
amounts received by individual
assistant, associate, and full
professors in nearly every
department of the university's
graduate and undergraduate
schools.
Approximately 50 of the
mimeographed lists were
deposited on campus Monday.
Additional copies were received
yesterday in the mail by Bay Area
media, including the Daily,
Chaparral, Chronicle, and San
Jose Mercury. Thus far, no further
public distribution has been
reported.
Provost Lyman indicated in a
meeting with Daily editors last
night that legal action by the
university was being considered
against any publication that might
or that did publish the purloined
documents.
Most Sensitive Issues
Lyman also declared that in
the administration's opinion the
salary recommendations and
evaluations of the department
chairmen of political science,
communication, psychology,
sociology, and mathematics were
the most sensitive issues.
At the same meeting, Lyman
also warned Chaparral spokesman

Michael Sweeney against printing
any of the documents under
penalty of possible legal action.
Sweeney indicated that the
Chaparral had not ruled out the
possibility of reprinting the
document in its next issue Nov. 5.
Lyman outlined two possible
legal maneuvers. First, the
university could bring action
against the publisher of the
documents on grounds of
dissemination of stolen property,
referring to the fact that the
salary and raise recommendations
were stolen from university files.
Invasion ol Privacy
Further, individuals mentioned
within the document could bring
action if their salaries were
printed on grounds of invasion of
privacy.
The appearance of the figures
caught most campus radicals
off-guard, and most claimed no
knowledge of those responsible
for it. Some claimed that there
were additional documents also
stolen from Encina and that these
might possibly be released in the
future.
They declined to state what
the content of the other material
was and refused any further
comment.
One point of confusion was
partly clarified yesterday. Both
administrators and radicals agreed
that the five faculty evaluation
documents were probably taken
from Encina along with the salary
lists.
The university first gave notice
of its intent to bring legal action
against those responsible for
taking the documents in a letter
circulated to local news media on
May 15, 1969, two weeks after
the sit-in.
Files Removed
In a letter to the April Third
Movement (A3M), addressed to

ASM Attorney James Wolpman,
the university charged that
"members of your organization
removed from Encina Hall certain
Stanford University files
containing information relating to
the University budget for the
years 1966-67 and 1968-69 and,
more particularly, to the salaries
of certain faculty members and
administrators."
In addition the letter, sent by
university lawyers, demanded that
the files be returned and that "no
repetition, publication, or
distribution of such files or of any
of the information contained
therein be made."
The letter concluded:
"Stanford University will consider
taking whatever action is
necessary in order to fully protect
its interest."
The next action came later in
May when one-page leaflets were
circulated on campus that
threatened to reveal salary
information if the university
complied with a subpoena from
Senator John McClellan's
Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations.
Leaflet Appears
On May 29, another one-page
leaflet appeared which listed
several top administrative salaries.
University officials claimed the
list contained several inaccuracies.
At President Pitzer's
inauguration on June 14, the
university news service reported
that several students called out
salary data to professors as they
passed by in the processional and
recessional.
The news service also released
figures that showed Stanford
ranked sixth nationally in average
compensation for full-time faculty
members at $18,195 during
1968-69.

for it. Some claimed that there
were additional documents also
stolen from Encina and that these
might possibly be released in the
future.
They declined to state what
the content of the other material
was and refused any further
comment.
One point of confusion was
partly clarified yesterday. Both
administrators and radicals agreed
that the five faculty evaluation
documents were probably taken
from Encina along with the salary
lists.
The university first gave notice
of its intent to bring legal action
against those responsible for
taking the documents in a letter
circulated to local news media on
May 15, 1969, two weeks after
the sit-in.
Files Removed
In a letter to the April Third
Movement (A3M), addressed to

ASM Attorney James Wolpman,
the university charged that
"members of your organization
removed from Encina Hall certain
Stanford University files
containing information relating to
the University budget for the
years 1966-67 and 1968-69 and,
more particularly, to the salaries
of certain faculty members and
administrators."
In addition the letter, sent by
university lawyers, demanded that
the files be returned and that "no
repetition, publication, or
distribution of such files or of any
of the information contained
therein be made."
The letter concluded:
"Stanford University will consider
taking whatever action is
necessary in order to fully protect
its interest."
The next action came later in
May when one-page leaflets were
circulated on campus that
threatened to reveal salary
information if the university
complied with a subpoena from
Senator John McClellan's
Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations.
Leaflet Appears
On May 29, another one-page
leaflet appeared which listed
several top administrative salaries.
University officials claimed the
list contained several inaccuracies.
At President Pitzer's
inauguration on June 14, the
university news service reported
that several students called out
salary data to professors as they
passed by in the processional and
recessional.
The news service also released
figures that showed Stanford
ranked sixth nationally in average
compensation for full-time faculty
members at $18,195 during
1968-69.
The Stanford administration is
prepared to bring legal action
against any publication choosing
to reprint the salary lists and
faculty raise recommendations
anonymously distributed on
campus Monday morning.
In a flurry of hastily-arranged
conferences yesterday afternoon,
top administration officials
decided that the documents
apparently stolen from Encina
Hall files during last May's sit-in
were of a deeply confidential
nature.
Present at the meetings were
President Kenneth Pitzer, Provost
Richard Lyman, presidential
assistants Fred Glover and Willard
Wyman, News Service Director
Bob Beyers, Director of
University Relatioas Lyle Nelson,

and university legal counsel Daryl
Dawson.
University officials made it
clear that they were most
concerned about the confidential
comments from five department
chairmen evaluating professors
within the department.
Dissemination of such privileged
information, they feel, might
seriously hamper "honest and
complete evaluation in the
future."
Anonymous Pamphlet
The anonymously-printed
pamphlet revealed salary levels
from President Pitzer to staff
clerks. It documented the
amounts received by individual
assistant, associate, and full
professors in nearly every
department of the university's
graduate and undergraduate
schools.
Approximately 50 of the
mimeographed lists were
deposited on campus Monday.
Additional copies were received
yesterday in the mail by Bay Area
media, including the Daily,
Chaparral, Chronicle, and San
Jose Mercury. Thus far, no further
public distribution has been
reported.
Provost Lyman indicated in a
meeting with Daily editors last
night that legal action by the
university was being considered
against any publication that might
or that did publish the purloined
documents.
Most Sensitive Issues
Lyman also declared that in
the administration's opinion the
salary recommendations and
evaluations of the department
chairmen of political science,
communication, psychology,
sociology, and mathematics were
the most sensitive issues.
At the same meeting, Lyman
also warned Chaparral spokesman

Michael Sweeney against printing
any of the documents under
penalty of possible legal action.
Sweeney indicated that the
Chaparral had not ruled out the
possibility of reprinting the
document in its next issue Nov. 5.
Lyman outlined two possible
legal maneuvers. First, the
university could bring action
against the publisher of the
documents on grounds of
dissemination of stolen property,
referring to the fact that the
salary and raise recommendations
were stolen from university files.
Invasion ol Privacy
Further, individuals mentioned
within the document could bring
action if their salaries were
printed on grounds of invasion of
privacy.
The appearance of the figures
caught most campus radicals
off-guard, and most claimed no
knowledge of those responsible
for it. Some claimed that there
were additional documents also

assistants Fred Glover and Willard
Wyman, News Service Director
Bob Beyers, Director of
University Relatioas Lyle Nelson,

and university legal counsel Daryl
Dawson.
University officials made it
clear that they were most
concerned about the confidential
comments from five department
chairmen evaluating professors
within the department.
Dissemination of such privileged
information, they feel, might
seriously hamper "honest and
complete evaluation in the
future."
Anonymous Pamphlet
The anonymously-printed
pamphlet revealed salary levels
from President Pitzer to staff
clerks. It documented the
amounts received by individual
assistant, associate, and full
professors in nearly every
department of the university's
graduate and undergraduate
schools.
Approximately 50 of the
mimeographed lists were
deposited on campus Monday.
Additional copies were received
yesterday in the mail by Bay Area
media, including the Daily,
Chaparral, Chronicle, and San
Jose Mercury. Thus far, no further
public distribution has been
reported.
Provost Lyman indicated in a
meeting with Daily editors last
night that legal action by the
university was being considered
against any publication that might
or that did publish the purloined
documents.
Most Sensitive Issues
Lyman also declared that in
the administration's opinion the
salary recommendations and
evaluations of the department
chairmen of political science,
communication, psychology,
sociology, and mathematics were
the most sensitive issues.
At the same meeting, Lyman
also warned Chaparral spokesman

Michael Sweeney against printing
any of the documents under
penalty of possible legal action.
Sweeney indicated that the
Chaparral had not ruled out the
possibility of reprinting the
document in its next issue Nov. 5.
Lyman outlined two possible
legal maneuvers. First, the
university could bring action
against the publisher of the
documents on grounds of
dissemination of stolen property,
referring to the fact that the
salary and raise recommendations
were stolen from university files.
Invasion ol Privacy
Further, individuals mentioned
within the document could bring
action if their salaries were
printed on grounds of invasion of
privacy.
The appearance of the figures
caught most campus radicals
off-guard, and most claimed no
knowledge of those responsible
for it. Some claimed that there
were additional documents also
stolen from Encina and that these
might possibly be released in the
future.
They declined to state what
the content of the other material
was and refused any further
comment.
One point of confusion was
partly clarified yesterday. Both
administrators and radicals agreed
that the five faculty evaluation
documents were probably taken
from Encina along with the salary
lists.
The university first gave notice
of its intent to bring legal action
against those responsible for
taking the documents in a letter
circulated to local news media on
May 15, 1969, two weeks after
the sit-in.
Files Removed
In a letter to the April Third
Movement (A3M), addressed to

ASM Attorney James Wolpman,
the university charged that
"members of your organization
removed from Encina Hall certain
Stanford University files
containing information relating to
the University budget for the
years 1966-67 and 1968-69 and,
more particularly, to the salaries
of certain faculty members and
administrators."
In addition the letter, sent by
university lawyers, demanded that
the files be returned and that "no
repetition, publication, or
distribution of such files or of any
of the information contained
therein be made."
The letter concluded:
"Stanford University will consider
taking whatever action is
necessary in order to fully protect
its interest."
The next action came later in
May when one-page leaflets were
circulated on campus that
threatened to reveal salary
information if the university
complied with a subpoena from
Senator John McClellan's
Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations.
Leaflet Appears
On May 29, another one-page
leaflet appeared which listed
several top administrative salaries.
University officials claimed the
list contained several inaccuracies.
At President Pitzer's
inauguration on June 14, the
university news service reported
that several students called out
salary data to professors as they
passed by in the processional and
recessional.
The news service also released
figures that showed Stanford
ranked sixth nationally in average
compensation for full-time faculty
members at $18,195 during
1968-69.
The Stanford administration is
prepared to bring legal action
against any publication choosing
to reprint the salary lists and
faculty raise recommendations
anonymously distributed on
campus Monday morning.
In a flurry of hastily-arranged
conferences yesterday afternoon,
top administration officials
decided that the documents
apparently stolen from Encina
Hall files during last May's sit-in
were of a deeply confidential
nature.
Present at the meetings were
President Kenneth Pitzer, Provost
Richard Lyman, presidential
assistants Fred Glover and Willard
Wyman, News Service Director
Bob Beyers, Director of
University Relatioas Lyle Nelson,

and university legal counsel Daryl
Dawson.
