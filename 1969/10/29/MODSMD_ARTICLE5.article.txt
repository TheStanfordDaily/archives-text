JERUSALEM (AP)-Israeli
voters dealt a prestige blow to
prime Minister Golda Meir in
Tuesday's national election but
apparently left her with a
mandate to govern with a policy
of "no retreat" before the Arab
world.
Returns from 732 of the 3,474
precincts polled showed a steady
swing to the right early
Wednesday that could cost Mrs.
Meir's ruling Labor party
alignment an outright majority in
the 120-seat Knesset-Parliament.
One computer forecast Labor
would wind up with 56 seats,
seven less than it currently has.
It predicted the right-wing
opposition Gahal party would get
28 seats, a gain of two, and also
forecast the pro-Moscow,
pro-Arab Community party would
gain one seat for a total of four.
The 71-year-old prime minister
looked despondent as she
examined the results, contrasting
with the jubilation of Gahal
members.

NEW YORK (AP)—Minor
picket line violence broke out in
five cities Tuesday on the second
day of the nation-wide strike
against General Electric Co., the
nation's fourth largest company.
The strike is affecting at least
125,000 production employees.
At the company's large
Schenectady, N.Y., plant, police
wielding clubs beat back three
white collar workers who sought
to cross picket lines. Police said
they feared mass violence would
erupt if they did not stop the
attempted crossing.
There were minor picket line
flareups also in Bloomington,
Ind., Lynn and Pittsfield, Mass.,
and in Collingdale, Pa. But
picketing of company plants in
some 30 states generally was
peaceful.
At a GE stockholders'
informational meeting in
Minneapolis, Herman L. Weiss, a
company executive officer, said
he had heard indirectly that 13
striking unions were prepared to
stay out until Christmas. The
strike is being spearheaded by
GE's two largest unions, the
AFL-CIO International Union of
Electrical Workers and the
independent Union of Electrical
Workers.
GE reported all of its 280
plants in 33 states were open, but
production was at a halt in an
undetermined number of them.
At least 25 plants were not
struck—either because they were
manned by nonunion workmen or
had union contracts that ran
beyond the Sunday midnight
expiration date of most. In
addition, the company said some
workers have crossed picket lines.
The company claimed about
1 25,000 of its 310,000 employees
were on strike. The unions, which
represent 147,000 GE production
employees, said at least 132,000
were out.
Guerillas Firm
BERUIT (AP)—Guerrilla
leader Yasser Arafat dashed hopes
Tuesday for a negotiated
settlement of the violent conflict
between his Arab commandos and
the Lebanese army. Scattered
fighting was reported throughout
Lebanon.
"We fedayeen guerrillas will be
inflexible in any peace talks or
negotiations with the Lebanese
authorities as far as the complete
freedom of action of guerrilla
operations and movements is
concerned," the AI Fatah
commander told a news
conference in Damascus, the
Syrian capital.
"I am doubtful," he said, "if
any talks can lie held."

Arafat accused the United
States of meddling in the
Lebanese-guerrilla crisis.
Lebanon, fearful that guerrilla
raids from its territory will bring
painful Israeli retaliation, has been
demanding that the guerrillas
coordinate their activities with the
Lebanese army.
An army crackdown on the
guerrillas last week triggered the
crisis in which at least 30 persons
have been killed and scores more
wounded.
As Arafat spoke, Lebanon's
army commander-in-chief, Gen.
Emile Boustany, flew to Cairo for
talks with President Gamal Abdel
Nasser of Egypt. Arafat declined
to say whether he would go to
Cairo or send a representative.
The Cairo talks were intended to
pave the way for negotiations
between the disputants.
The guerrilla leader accused
Lebanon of agreeing to negotiate
the dispute as a ploy to gain time
for its army to push back the
commandos from Lebanon's
southern border with Israel.

LOS ANGELES (AP)-State
college trustees acted Tuesday to
tighten control over student
newspapers in the 18-campus
system but said they did not wish
to impose censorship.
By a 6-to-l vote the trustees'
committee on educational policy
recommended that Chancellor
Glenn Dumke be "directed to
insure that each state college
review methods of administration
that will most likely solve the
problems of student publications
without censorship."
The lone dissenting vote came
from trustee James Thacher of
San Francisco who said he feared
the diversity of viewpoints in the
college papers would be lessened.
Some trustees have expressed
concern over alleged instances of
obscenity in student publications
and what they regarded as radical
political positions.
Dumke predicted there would
be "another episode" of
controversy unless trustees acted
"We've got some problems that
need to be corked up," he said.
There has been no
"overwhelming evidence" that
local colleges acted effectively to
maintain responsibility on their
student publications, said
committee chairman Charles
Luckman of Los Angeles.
The committee acted over the
objections of campus student
body presidents at the meeting.
They wanted trustees to confine
themselves to recommendations,
rather than directives to the
chancellor.

NEW YORK (AP)—Minor
picket line violence broke out in
five cities Tuesday on the second
day of the nation-wide strike
against General Electric Co., the
nation's fourth largest company.
The strike is affecting at least
125,000 production employees.
At the company's large
Schenectady, N.Y., plant, police
wielding clubs beat back three
white collar workers who sought
to cross picket lines. Police said
they feared mass violence would
erupt if they did not stop the
attempted crossing.
There were minor picket line
flareups also in Bloomington,
Ind., Lynn and Pittsfield, Mass.,
and in Collingdale, Pa. But
picketing of company plants in
some 30 states generally was
peaceful.
At a GE stockholders'
informational meeting in
Minneapolis, Herman L. Weiss, a
company executive officer, said
he had heard indirectly that 13
striking unions were prepared to
stay out until Christmas. The
strike is being spearheaded by
GE's two largest unions, the
AFL-CIO International Union of
Electrical Workers and the
independent Union of Electrical
Workers.
GE reported all of its 280
plants in 33 states were open, but
production was at a halt in an
undetermined number of them.
At least 25 plants were not
struck—either because they were
manned by nonunion workmen or
had union contracts that ran
beyond the Sunday midnight
expiration date of most. In
addition, the company said some
workers have crossed picket lines.
The company claimed about
1 25,000 of its 310,000 employees
were on strike. The unions, which
represent 147,000 GE production
employees, said at least 132,000
were out.

BERUIT (AP)—Guerrilla
leader Yasser Arafat dashed hopes
Tuesday for a negotiated
settlement of the violent conflict
between his Arab commandos and
the Lebanese army. Scattered
fighting was reported throughout
Lebanon.
"We fedayeen guerrillas will be
inflexible in any peace talks or
negotiations with the Lebanese
authorities as far as the complete
freedom of action of guerrilla
operations and movements is
concerned," the AI Fatah
commander told a news
conference in Damascus, the

Lebanese-guerrilla crisis.
Lebanon, fearful that guerrilla
raids from its territory will bring
painful Israeli retaliation, has been
demanding that the guerrillas
coordinate their activities with the
Lebanese army.
An army crackdown on the
guerrillas last week triggered the
crisis in which at least 30 persons
have been killed and scores more
wounded.
As Arafat spoke, Lebanon's
army commander-in-chief, Gen.

had union contracts that ran
beyond the Sunday midnight
expiration date of most. In
addition, the company said some
workers have crossed picket lines.
The company claimed about
1 25,000 of its 310,000 employees
were on strike. The unions, which
represent 147,000 GE production
employees, said at least 132,000
were out.
Guerillas Firm
BERUIT (AP)—Guerrilla
leader Yasser Arafat dashed hopes
Tuesday for a negotiated
settlement of the violent conflict
between his Arab commandos and
the Lebanese army. Scattered
fighting was reported throughout
Lebanon.
"We fedayeen guerrillas will be
inflexible in any peace talks or
negotiations with the Lebanese
authorities as far as the complete
freedom of action of guerrilla
operations and movements is
concerned," the AI Fatah
commander told a news
conference in Damascus, the
Syrian capital.
"I am doubtful," he said, "if
any talks can lie held."

Arafat accused the United
States of meddling in the
Lebanese-guerrilla crisis.
Lebanon, fearful that guerrilla
raids from its territory will bring
painful Israeli retaliation, has been
demanding that the guerrillas
coordinate their activities with the
Lebanese army.
An army crackdown on the
guerrillas last week triggered the
crisis in which at least 30 persons
have been killed and scores more
wounded.
As Arafat spoke, Lebanon's
army commander-in-chief, Gen.
Emile Boustany, flew to Cairo for
talks with President Gamal Abdel
Nasser of Egypt. Arafat declined
to say whether he would go to
Cairo or send a representative.
The Cairo talks were intended to
pave the way for negotiations
between the disputants.
The guerrilla leader accused
Lebanon of agreeing to negotiate
the dispute as a ploy to gain time
for its army to push back the
commandos from Lebanon's
southern border with Israel.

LOS ANGELES (AP)-State
college trustees acted Tuesday to
tighten control over student
newspapers in the 18-campus
system but said they did not wish
to impose censorship.
By a 6-to-l vote the trustees'
committee on educational policy
recommended that Chancellor
Glenn Dumke be "directed to
insure that each state college
review methods of administration
that will most likely solve the
problems of student publications
without censorship."
The lone dissenting vote came
from trustee James Thacher of
San Francisco who said he feared
the diversity of viewpoints in the
college papers would be lessened.
Some trustees have expressed
concern over alleged instances of
obscenity in student publications
and what they regarded as radical
political positions.
Dumke predicted there would
be "another episode" of
controversy unless trustees acted
"We've got some problems that
need to be corked up," he said.
There has been no
"overwhelming evidence" that
local colleges acted effectively to
maintain responsibility on their
student publications, said
committee chairman Charles
Luckman of Los Angeles.
The committee acted over the
objections of campus student
body presidents at the meeting.
They wanted trustees to confine
themselves to recommendations,
rather than directives to the
chancellor.
JERUSALEM (AP)-Israeli
voters dealt a prestige blow to
prime Minister Golda Meir in
Tuesday's national election but
apparently left her with a
mandate to govern with a policy
of "no retreat" before the Arab
world.
Returns from 732 of the 3,474
precincts polled showed a steady
swing to the right early
Wednesday that could cost Mrs.
Meir's ruling Labor party
alignment an outright majority in
the 120-seat Knesset-Parliament.
One computer forecast Labor
would wind up with 56 seats,
seven less than it currently has.
It predicted the right-wing
opposition Gahal party would get
28 seats, a gain of two, and also
forecast the pro-Moscow,
pro-Arab Community party would
gain one seat for a total of four.
The 71-year-old prime minister
looked despondent as she
examined the results, contrasting
with the jubilation of Gahal
members.

NEW YORK (AP)—Minor
picket line violence broke out in
five cities Tuesday on the second
day of the nation-wide strike
against General Electric Co., the
nation's fourth largest company.
The strike is affecting at least
125,000 production employees.
At the company's large
Schenectady, N.Y., plant, police
wielding clubs beat back three
white collar workers who sought
to cross picket lines. Police said
they feared mass violence would
erupt if they did not stop the
attempted crossing.
There were minor picket line
flareups also in Bloomington,
Ind., Lynn and Pittsfield, Mass.,
and in Collingdale, Pa. But
picketing of company plants in
some 30 states generally was
peaceful.
At a GE stockholders'
informational meeting in
Minneapolis, Herman L. Weiss, a
company executive officer, said
he had heard indirectly that 13
striking unions were prepared to
stay out until Christmas. The
strike is being spearheaded by
GE's two largest unions, the
AFL-CIO International Union of
Electrical Workers and the
independent Union of Electrical
Workers.
GE reported all of its 280
plants in 33 states were open, but
production was at a halt in an
undetermined number of them.
At least 25 plants were not
struck—either because they were
manned by nonunion workmen or
had union contracts that ran
beyond the Sunday midnight
expiration date of most. In
addition, the company said some
workers have crossed picket lines.
The company claimed about
1 25,000 of its 310,000 employees
