A message to prospective Stanford
faculty members: It you can teach, don't
come here. You might go bankrupt.
To quote a former chairman of the
Political Science department, "Professor
continues to make a significant
contribution to undergraduate teaching,
but he has been making little progress in
research and participation in the graduate
program . . . he shows no signs of being
able to complete a research project which
he undertook seven or eight years ago ... I
could not recommend an (salary)
increase ..."
The university administration is quite
embarrassed at so revealing a glance at
Stanford. University officials are naturally
anxious to cover their tracks, and one
obvious attempt is the threat of legal action
against any publication that might reprint
the data.
The Daily at this time will continue to
refrain from reprinting the documents for
fear of legal action by the university and by
individuals whose salaries might be listed.
But this does not mean that we wish to
prevent discussion of those documents.
Aside from the fact that the data was
obtained illegally, the information
contained in the heretofore secret
documents makes quite evident that reform

of university salary structure and professor
evaluation methods is definitely needed.
There has been a feeling for some time
among students that faculty were left to
the whims of the department chairman
when it came time for salary review.
Examination of the contraband data bears
out that suspicion, particularly in the case
of the longstanding political science feud.
It matters not whether the salary
discrepencies were due to discrimination by
deans against certain departments, or to
department head discrimination against
non-researchers and those who hold
non-establishment views, or to simple
personal prejudices. Whatever the reason
for these discrepancies, the time has come
to look at the entire issue openly.
We sympathize with those professors
who would hope that their confidential
expressions of opinion would remain
privileged information. However, wide
discussion of the present process of faculty
evaluation will hopefully lead to more
equitable forms of salary distribution,
including just reward for those who excell
in undergraduate teaching. Despite
administration concerns about faculty
sensibilities, far more important questions
about the distribution of power within the
university must now be fully examined.
