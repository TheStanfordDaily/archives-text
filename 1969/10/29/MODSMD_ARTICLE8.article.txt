# Enrollment Drive
## Minority Doctor Quotas 
### Dr. I. A. Aguilar 
The strong point of the
Stanford effort to increase
'minority' enrollment to the
medical school was the
designation of a quota system.
This one factor made my own
operation of attracting a high level
of intelligence to Stanford quite
easy. There was no great problem
in further adorning Stanford's
windows with the prime
pre medical material from two or
three schools in the Southwest.
The Dean's staff has stated a
sincere awareness of the inequities
in the educational preparation of
the minority student and the need
for making special provisions for
their success once having entered.
It is unlikely, however, that the
school will have to implement the
likes of special tutorial programs
to have the present generation of
students realize their M.D.
I doubt that many other
schools in the nation will have to
do much of the same thing. The
Chicano students who elected to
come here were bristling with
ambition, energy, a native
intelligence, and motivation. Also,
in the tradition of the pre-med
student, they were fully equipped
with a fine scholarly record.

I am certain that most of the
black students admitted to the
same program were in a similar
category. These students are not
to be confused with any
candidates having a 'marginal'
preparation. They will
undoubtedly prove to be a credit
to the medical school and
Stanford should be proud to have
them. Except for a minor deficit
of 10 or 20 points in some
categories of the M.C.A.T.
(actually, not bad considering
their masterful facility with at
least two languages) and slight
excesses in the shades of brown to
their hair color, they were little
different from any of the 1,500 or
so other applicants for the Class
of 1973.
In fact, two of the five (and
also others who were rejected)
had applied to Stanford on their
own initiative and had no
connection with the special
program. All they needed was a
second look. The "Search
Program," in effect, involved no
search at all but consisted mainly
of a raid in the applicant pool of
(ither medical schools. The total

number of doctors occurring
nationally in 1973 will not be any
greater because of the Stanford
effort. Simply, more of those
graduating will have come from
Stanford.
Figure Competition
By the time this medical school
could be positive with the
minority student in April of 1969,
they already had reasonable
promise of being admitted to
other schools. It is perhaps a
credit to Stanford's program that
these schools found themselves
better prepared for a prompt
"yes" to the students, in the wake
of the Stanford courtship.
Typically, the students' earliest
applications to schools in their
own region produced only a
pessimistic prospect of
acceptance. There is a hint in all
of this action that a shortage
exists in the number of young,
fully qualified candidates and,
undoubtedly, there will be keen
competition for their presence on
campuses of states with a high
Chicano Population.
The Stanford Program did
make it possible to bring the best
talent here. (Stanford maintains a
prestigious place in the eyes of the
Mexican-American; besides, "it's
an education just to get out of
New Mexico" as one student
eagerly stated.) The Stanford
program did cause some red faces
and angry deans in other schools
of the Southwest. The Stanford
program did bring us one step
closer to that ideal situation for a
truly sincere invitation to the
"new student."
Specifically, the situation
would be that of creating a
surplus of committed positions
through a pledge from every
school in the U.S. to reserve at
least 15% of their medical school
class for the minorities. The
number of this total remaining
unfilled would provide some
index of the depth of the pool of
"qualified" students, and I have a
feeling it is pretty shallow.
Such a program would give us
reason to focus on that larger
group of "qualifiable"
candidates —science grade school
teachers, biology majors, social
workers, lab technicians, etc., for
whom the dream of white coats
and stethoscopes had vanished by
the time they were age 25-30.
The "empty room in the

penthouse" can be the greatest
motivation for the grade-school
student to orient himself
positively to a career in medicine.
As long as the President's suite
remains empty, the open door is
the open finger pointing an

accusation at the grade schools to
come up with the right talent.

number of this total remaining
unfilled would provide some
index of the depth of the pool of
"qualified" students, and I have a
feeling it is pretty shallow.
Such a program would give us
reason to focus on that larger

candidates —science grade school
teachers, biology majors, social
workers, lab technicians, etc., for
whom the dream of white coats

The strong point of the
Stanford effort to increase
'minority' enrollment to the
medical school was the
designation of a quota system.
This one factor made my own
operation of attracting a high level
of intelligence to Stanford quite
easy. There was no great problem
in further adorning Stanford's
windows with the prime
pre medical material from two or
three schools in the Southwest.
The Dean's staff has stated a
sincere awareness of the inequities
in the educational preparation of
the minority student and the need
for making special provisions for
their success once having entered.
It is unlikely, however, that the
school will have to implement the
likes of special tutorial programs
to have the present generation of
students realize their M.D.
I doubt that many other
schools in the nation will have to
do much of the same thing. The
Chicano students who elected to
come here were bristling with
ambition, energy, a native
intelligence, and motivation. Also,
in the tradition of the pre-med
student, they were fully equipped
with a fine scholarly record.

I am certain that most of the
black students admitted to the
same program were in a similar
category. These students are not
to be confused with any
candidates having a 'marginal'
preparation. They will
undoubtedly prove to be a credit
to the medical school and
Stanford should be proud to have
them. Except for a minor deficit
of 10 or 20 points in some
categories of the M.C.A.T.
(actually, not bad considering
their masterful facility with at
least two languages) and slight
excesses in the shades of brown to
their hair color, they were little
different from any of the 1,500 or
so other applicants for the Class
of 1973.
In fact, two of the five (and
also others who were rejected)
had applied to Stanford on their
own initiative and had no
connection with the special
program. All they needed was a
second look. The "Search
Program," in effect, involved no
search at all but consisted mainly
of a raid in the applicant pool of
(ither medical schools. The total

number of doctors occurring
nationally in 1973 will not be any
greater because of the Stanford
effort. Simply, more of those
graduating will have come from
Stanford.

By the time this medical school
could be positive with the
minority student in April of 1969,
they already had reasonable
promise of being admitted to
other schools. It is perhaps a
credit to Stanford's program that
these schools found themselves
better prepared for a prompt
"yes" to the students, in the wake
of the Stanford courtship.
Typically, the students' earliest
applications to schools in their
own region produced only a
pessimistic prospect of
acceptance. There is a hint in all
of this action that a shortage
exists in the number of young,
fully qualified candidates and,
undoubtedly, there will be keen
competition for their presence on
campuses of states with a high
Chicano Population.
The Stanford Program did
make it possible to bring the best
talent here. (Stanford maintains a
prestigious place in the eyes of the
Mexican-American; besides, "it's
an education just to get out of
New Mexico" as one student
eagerly stated.) The Stanford
program did cause some red faces
and angry deans in other schools
of the Southwest. The Stanford
program did bring us one step
closer to that ideal situation for a
truly sincere invitation to the
"new student."

"yes" to the students, in the wake
of the Stanford courtship.
Typically, the students' earliest
applications to schools in their
own region produced only a
pessimistic prospect of
acceptance. There is a hint in all
of this action that a shortage
exists in the number of young,
fully qualified candidates and,
undoubtedly, there will be keen
competition for their presence on
campuses of states with a high
Chicano Population.
The Stanford Program did
make it possible to bring the best
talent here. (Stanford maintains a
prestigious place in the eyes of the
Mexican-American; besides, "it's
an education just to get out of
New Mexico" as one student
eagerly stated.) The Stanford
program did cause some red faces
and angry deans in other schools
of the Southwest. The Stanford
program did bring us one step
closer to that ideal situation for a
truly sincere invitation to the
"new student."
Specifically, the situation
would be that of creating a
surplus of committed positions
through a pledge from every
school in the U.S. to reserve at
least 15% of their medical school
class for the minorities. The
number of this total remaining
unfilled would provide some
index of the depth of the pool of
"qualified" students, and I have a
feeling it is pretty shallow.
Such a program would give us
reason to focus on that larger
group of "qualifiable"
candidates —science grade school
teachers, biology majors, social
workers, lab technicians, etc., for
whom the dream of white coats
and stethoscopes had vanished by
the time they were age 25-30.
The "empty room in the

penthouse" can be the greatest
motivation for the grade-school
student to orient himself
positively to a career in medicine.
As long as the President's suite
remains empty, the open door is
the open finger pointing an

accusation at the grade schools to
come up with the right talent.

The strong point of the
Stanford effort to increase
'minority' enrollment to the
medical school was the
designation of a quota system.
This one factor made my own
operation of attracting a high level
of intelligence to Stanford quite
easy. There was no great problem
in further adorning Stanford's
windows with the prime
pre medical material from two or
three schools in the Southwest.
The Dean's staff has stated a
sincere awareness of the inequities
in the educational preparation of
the minority student and the need
for making special provisions for
their success once having entered.
It is unlikely, however, that the
school will have to implement the
likes of special tutorial programs
to have the present generation of
students realize their M.D.
I doubt that many other
schools in the nation will have to
do much of the same thing. The
Chicano students who elected to
come here were bristling with
ambition, energy, a native
intelligence, and motivation. Also,
in the tradition of the pre-med
student, they were fully equipped
with a fine scholarly record.
Similar Category
I am certain that most of the
black students admitted to the
same program were in a similar
category. These students are not
to be confused with any
candidates having a 'marginal'
preparation. They will
undoubtedly prove to be a credit
to the medical school and
Stanford should be proud to have
them. Except for a minor deficit
of 10 or 20 points in some
categories of the M.C.A.T.
(actually, not bad considering
their masterful facility with at
least two languages) and slight
excesses in the shades of brown to
their hair color, they were little
different from any of the 1,500 or
so other applicants for the Class
of 1973.
In fact, two of the five (and
also others who were rejected)
had applied to Stanford on their
own initiative and had no
connection with the special
program. All they needed was a
second look. The "Search
Program," in effect, involved no
search at all but consisted mainly
of a raid in the applicant pool of
(ither medical schools. The total

number of doctors occurring
nationally in 1973 will not be any
greater because of the Stanford
effort. Simply, more of those
graduating will have come from
Stanford.
Figure Competition
By the time this medical school
could be positive with the
minority student in April of 1969,
they already had reasonable
promise of being admitted to
other schools. It is perhaps a
credit to Stanford's program that
these schools found themselves
better prepared for a prompt
"yes" to the students, in the wake
of the Stanford courtship.
Typically, the students' earliest
applications to schools in their
