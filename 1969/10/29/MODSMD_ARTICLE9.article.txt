# Israel and Zionism
## Miss Mihaly Set Straight 
### Howard L. Selznick 
I would like to set Miss Patricia
Mihaly straight. Her "Zionist
Country Club" (l)ail>, October
20) was somewhat of a
misrepresentation of the situation.
Zionism is a movement for
re-establishing a Jewish national
homeland in the very place where
the Jewish People achieved its
spiritual, religious, and national
identity. The return to Palestine,
to the land of the Forefathers, has
been a part of Jewish ritual since
Jews were expelled from Israel
some 1800 years ago. This
historical association plus the hard
reality of European ghetto
life—where Jews were at best
second-class citizens, living in fear
of the pogrom, which can be
defined as genocide on the
installment plan—set in motion
the Zionist movement in the late
19th century.
Encouraged by the writings of
Theodore Herzl and others, Jews
began emigrating to Palestine;

some sixty thousand came
between 1882 and 1911. Here,
hopefully, they would become
first-class citizens in their own
country rather than second or
lower-class citizens in someone
else's country. That hope became
reality on May 14, 1948.
Israel's Tolerance
Zionism is not a movement of
exclusivism, but quite the
opposite. Although Israel is a
Jewish State—in much the same
sense that the United States,
Great Britain, and Italy are
Christian nations—Arabs in Israel
are generally better off than Arabs
in Arab nations. There may be
some distinction, however,
between Arab and Jew because of
past events and the current
mideast situation, that may indeed
cause an Arab to feel that he is an
outsider in Israel. The feeling is
not entirely unjustified, but is
hardly "exclusivism."
Nevertheless, anyone can
become a citizen of Israel: Jew,
Moslem, or Christian. Israel is a
parliamentary democracy, and all
ethnic groups are included in
governing the country, both in he
Parliament and the Cabinet. (Can
the same be said for Arab Moslem
nations?).
Land Compensation
Miss Mihaly's statement that
the Arabs "are fighting an
exclusivism (Zionism) which was
imposed on he land that in the
1920's was 90% theirs and just
before the partitions in 1947 was
67% theirs" is misleading at best.
First of all, whatever land Jews
acquired from Arab landowners
was by legal sale of such land,
often at ridiculously high prices.
No Arab was ever displaced from
his land without just
compensation, either by money or
other land. Secondly, nothing was
ever "imposed" on the indigenous
Arab population, except perhaps
improved environmental health,
higher eages, and a better standard
of living.
Miss Mihaly then calls the 1947
Partition "an exclusivism imposed
by the UN". Miss Mihaly, the UN
cannot impose anything on
anyone, you should know that by
now. In fact, the Israelis had to
fight for their part of the Partition
in defense of invading Arab
armies. Indeed, the uncomprising
demands of Arab nationalism
made a mockery of the UN
Partition plan, and caused the
1948 War.
It is unfortunate that the rise
of Arab nationalism coincided
with the rise of Zionism. Such
nationalism was manifested in a
desire to rid the mideast of all
foreigners. However, the Jews

were not foreigners. There have
been Jews in Palestine throughout
history. Emigration to Palestine
by Jews was always legal both
under Turkish rule (16th century
to 1917) and the British Mandate
(1917-18). Whatever illegal
immigration occurred (some
31,000 out of 512,000) must be
understood in terms of
circumstances forcing such
immigration, namely Nazi
persecution. Victims of the Third
Reich's "solutions" had no place
to go; no other country offered
even a remote possibility of a
permanent haven. Palestine and
the Jewish National Home was
their only hope. But when the
British sealed the borders of
Palestine, responding to Arab
pressure, pent-up Jewish
frustration and resentment
erupted into open defiance, hence
"illegal" entry.
Arab Illegalities
While the Jews were willing to
compromise on Partition of
Palestine —an independent Arab
State and a Jewish State—the
Arabs would have no part of this.
Ignoring the UN Resolution of
1947, they invaded Israel and,
although failing to push Israel into
the Mediterranean, illegally

occupied (until 1967) ihe Old
City of Jerusalem and the West
Bank of the Jordan River (the
Resolution called for the
internationalization of Jerusalem
and the independent Arab State in
the West Bank area). Why are
Arabs expected and encouraged to
be fanatical and uncompromising
and Israelis always expected to
give in?
It is very easy to say that
elimination of Zionism and a
Jewish State will bring lasting
peace. But any scJlution to the
mideast problem must account for
the security of the Jews; a
thousand years of ghetto life has
given the Jews much experience in
evaluating their security. If one
reads some of Nasser's speeches,
there is some doubt that
elimination of the Jewish State
will provide such security.
Are the Arab nations waging a
war against Jews or Zonism? It
matters little; what is certain is
that there is an unnecessary war
going on in the Middle East. What
is needed is a rational, intelligent
dialogue among the parties, not
more fuel to the fire in the form
of name calling ("exclusivism")
and innuendoes ("Zionist country
club").

made a mockery of the UN
Partition plan, and caused the
1948 War.
It is unfortunate that the rise
of Arab nationalism coincided
with the rise of Zionism. Such
nationalism was manifested in a
desire to rid the mideast of all
foreigners. However, the Jews

were not foreigners. There have
been Jews in Palestine throughout
history. Emigration to Palestine
by Jews was always legal both
under Turkish rule (16th century
to 1917) and the British Mandate
(1917-18). Whatever illegal
immigration occurred (some
31,000 out of 512,000) must be
understood in terms of
circumstances forcing such
immigration, namely Nazi
persecution. Victims of the Third
Reich's "solutions" had no place
to go; no other country offered
even a remote possibility of a
permanent haven. Palestine and
the Jewish National Home was
their only hope. But when the
British sealed the borders of
Palestine, responding to Arab
pressure, pent-up Jewish
frustration and resentment
erupted into open defiance, hence
"illegal" entry.
Arab Illegalities
While the Jews were willing to
compromise on Partition of
Palestine —an independent Arab
State and a Jewish State—the
Arabs would have no part of this.
Ignoring the UN Resolution of
1947, they invaded Israel and,
although failing to push Israel into
the Mediterranean, illegally

occupied (until 1967) ihe Old
City of Jerusalem and the West
Bank of the Jordan River (the
Resolution called for the
internationalization of Jerusalem
and the independent Arab State in
the West Bank area). Why are
Arabs expected and encouraged to
be fanatical and uncompromising
and Israelis always expected to
give in?
It is very easy to say that
elimination of Zionism and a
Jewish State will bring lasting
peace. But any scJlution to the
mideast problem must account for
the security of the Jews; a
thousand years of ghetto life has
given the Jews much experience in
evaluating their security. If one
reads some of Nasser's speeches,
there is some doubt that
elimination of the Jewish State
will provide such security.
Are the Arab nations waging a
war against Jews or Zonism? It
matters little; what is certain is
that there is an unnecessary war
going on in the Middle East. What
is needed is a rational, intelligent
dialogue among the parties, not
more fuel to the fire in the form
of name calling ("exclusivism")
and innuendoes ("Zionist country
club").
I would like to set Miss Patricia
Mihaly straight. Her "Zionist
Country Club" (l)ail>, October
20) was somewhat of a
misrepresentation of the situation.
Zionism is a movement for
re-establishing a Jewish national
homeland in the very place where
the Jewish People achieved its
spiritual, religious, and national
identity. The return to Palestine,
to the land of the Forefathers, has
been a part of Jewish ritual since
Jews were expelled from Israel
some 1800 years ago. This
historical association plus the hard
reality of European ghetto
life—where Jews were at best
second-class citizens, living in fear
of the pogrom, which can be
defined as genocide on the
installment plan—set in motion
the Zionist movement in the late
19th century.
Encouraged by the writings of
Theodore Herzl and others, Jews
began emigrating to Palestine;

some sixty thousand came
between 1882 and 1911. Here,
hopefully, they would become
first-class citizens in their own
country rather than second or
lower-class citizens in someone
else's country. That hope became
reality on May 14, 1948.
Israel's Tolerance
Zionism is not a movement of
exclusivism, but quite the
opposite. Although Israel is a
Jewish State—in much the same
sense that the United States,
Great Britain, and Italy are
Christian nations—Arabs in Israel
are generally better off than Arabs
in Arab nations. There may be
some distinction, however,
between Arab and Jew because of
past events and the current
mideast situation, that may indeed
cause an Arab to feel that he is an
outsider in Israel. The feeling is
not entirely unjustified, but is
hardly "exclusivism."
Nevertheless, anyone can
become a citizen of Israel: Jew,
Moslem, or Christian. Israel is a
parliamentary democracy, and all
ethnic groups are included in
governing the country, both in he
Parliament and the Cabinet. (Can
the same be said for Arab Moslem
nations?).
Land Compensation
Miss Mihaly's statement that
the Arabs "are fighting an
exclusivism (Zionism) which was
imposed on he land that in the
1920's was 90% theirs and just
before the partitions in 1947 was
67% theirs" is misleading at best.
First of all, whatever land Jews
acquired from Arab landowners
was by legal sale of such land,
often at ridiculously high prices.
No Arab was ever displaced from
his land without just
compensation, either by money or
other land. Secondly, nothing was
ever "imposed" on the indigenous
Arab population, except perhaps
improved environmental health,
higher eages, and a better standard
of living.
Miss Mihaly then calls the 1947
Partition "an exclusivism imposed
by the UN". Miss Mihaly, the UN
cannot impose anything on
anyone, you should know that by
now. In fact, the Israelis had to
fight for their part of the Partition
in defense of invading Arab
armies. Indeed, the uncomprising
demands of Arab nationalism
made a mockery of the UN
Partition plan, and caused the
1948 War.

second-class citizens, living in fear
of the pogrom, which can be
defined as genocide on the
installment plan—set in motion
the Zionist movement in the late
19th century.
Encouraged by the writings of
Theodore Herzl and others, Jews
began emigrating to Palestine;

some sixty thousand came
between 1882 and 1911. Here,
hopefully, they would become
first-class citizens in their own
country rather than second or
lower-class citizens in someone
else's country. That hope became
reality on May 14, 1948.
Israel's Tolerance
Zionism is not a movement of
exclusivism, but quite the
opposite. Although Israel is a
Jewish State—in much the same
sense that the United States,
Great Britain, and Italy are
Christian nations—Arabs in Israel
are generally better off than Arabs
in Arab nations. There may be
some distinction, however,
between Arab and Jew because of
past events and the current
mideast situation, that may indeed
cause an Arab to feel that he is an
outsider in Israel. The feeling is
not entirely unjustified, but is
hardly "exclusivism."
Nevertheless, anyone can
become a citizen of Israel: Jew,
Moslem, or Christian. Israel is a
parliamentary democracy, and all
ethnic groups are included in
governing the country, both in he
Parliament and the Cabinet. (Can
the same be said for Arab Moslem
nations?).
Land Compensation
Miss Mihaly's statement that
the Arabs "are fighting an
exclusivism (Zionism) which was
imposed on he land that in the
1920's was 90% theirs and just
before the partitions in 1947 was
67% theirs" is misleading at best.
First of all, whatever land Jews
acquired from Arab landowners
was by legal sale of such land,
often at ridiculously high prices.
No Arab was ever displaced from
his land without just
compensation, either by money or
other land. Secondly, nothing was
ever "imposed" on the indigenous
Arab population, except perhaps
improved environmental health,
higher eages, and a better standard
of living.
Miss Mihaly then calls the 1947
Partition "an exclusivism imposed
by the UN". Miss Mihaly, the UN
cannot impose anything on
anyone, you should know that by
now. In fact, the Israelis had to
fight for their part of the Partition
in defense of invading Arab
armies. Indeed, the uncomprising
demands of Arab nationalism
made a mockery of the UN
Partition plan, and caused the
1948 War.
It is unfortunate that the rise
of Arab nationalism coincided
with the rise of Zionism. Such
nationalism was manifested in a
desire to rid the mideast of all
foreigners. However, the Jews

were not foreigners. There have
been Jews in Palestine throughout
history. Emigration to Palestine
by Jews was always legal both
under Turkish rule (16th century
to 1917) and the British Mandate
(1917-18). Whatever illegal
immigration occurred (some
31,000 out of 512,000) must be
understood in terms of
circumstances forcing such
immigration, namely Nazi
persecution. Victims of the Third
Reich's "solutions" had no place
to go; no other country offered
even a remote possibility of a
permanent haven. Palestine and
the Jewish National Home was
their only hope. But when the
British sealed the borders of
Palestine, responding to Arab
pressure, pent-up Jewish
frustration and resentment
erupted into open defiance, hence
"illegal" entry.
Arab Illegalities
While the Jews were willing to
compromise on Partition of
Palestine —an independent Arab
State and a Jewish State—the
Arabs would have no part of this.
Ignoring the UN Resolution of
1947, they invaded Israel and,
although failing to push Israel into
the Mediterranean, illegally

occupied (until 1967) ihe Old
City of Jerusalem and the West
Bank of the Jordan River (the
Resolution called for the
internationalization of Jerusalem
and the independent Arab State in
the West Bank area). Why are
Arabs expected and encouraged to
be fanatical and uncompromising
and Israelis always expected to
give in?
It is very easy to say that
elimination of Zionism and a
Jewish State will bring lasting
peace. But any scJlution to the
mideast problem must account for
the security of the Jews; a
thousand years of ghetto life has
given the Jews much experience in
evaluating their security. If one
reads some of Nasser's speeches,
there is some doubt that
elimination of the Jewish State
will provide such security.
Are the Arab nations waging a
war against Jews or Zonism? It
matters little; what is certain is
that there is an unnecessary war
going on in the Middle East. What
is needed is a rational, intelligent
dialogue among the parties, not
more fuel to the fire in the form
of name calling ("exclusivism")
and innuendoes ("Zionist country
club").
I would like to set Miss Patricia
Mihaly straight. Her "Zionist
Country Club" (l)ail>, October
20) was somewhat of a
misrepresentation of the situation.
Zionism is a movement for
re-establishing a Jewish national
homeland in the very place where
the Jewish People achieved its
spiritual, religious, and national
identity. The return to Palestine,
to the land of the Forefathers, has
been a part of Jewish ritual since
Jews were expelled from Israel
some 1800 years ago. This
historical association plus the hard
reality of European ghetto
life—where Jews were at best
second-class citizens, living in fear
of the pogrom, which can be
defined as genocide on the
installment plan—set in motion
the Zionist movement in the late
19th century.
