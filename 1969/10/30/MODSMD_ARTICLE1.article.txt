# Pitzer Prepared For Legal Action

### FELICITY BARRINGER BILL FREIVOGEL 
Amid the receding shock waves
generated by the underground
publication Monday of Stanford's
professorial and administrative
pay scale, President Kenneth
Pitzer announced that Stanford
would explore all "appropriate"
legal steps "to prevent publication
of this confidential and personal
information."
Publication of the documents is
"a clear case of invasion of
privacy," Pitzer said.
"Through its in
the American Association *of
University Professors (AAUP) and
other surveys, the Univeristy has
for many years made faculty
salary data publicly available in a
way which did not infringe on
individual privacy."
Stanford contributes an annual
report to the AAUP including
figures on salary ranges and on the
average salaries of assistant,
associate, and full professors,
according to Sanford Dornbusch,
professor of sociology.
Recent AAUP Report
The most recent AAUP report,
published last April, rated
Stanford sixth among American
Universities on a salary level basis.
Revelation of the information
contained in the documents has
brought out previously submerged
discussion of the significance of
certain pay differentials—chiefly
the discrepancy between the
salaries of research-oriented and
teaching-oriented professors, and
also that between humanities and
the more technical disciplines.
Most professors contacted
explained the former differential
as arising from an open-market
situation, from which the more
visible research-oriented,
well-published professor benefits.
Professor Heintz Eulau,
executive head of the Political
Science Department, explained
that "the market determines the
salaries; the market is determined
by reputation, and reputation by
publication."
Humanities Scale Lever
Most universities, estimated
philosophy professor Philip
Hhinelander, a former Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, have
pay scales "lower in the
Humanities than in other areas."
Intense inter-university
competition in the more technical
fields of sciences and medicine,
creates an inflated salary demand.
"The universities have to meet
this demand," Rhinelander
explained.
According to Gabriel Almond,
former executive head of the
political science department,
"Stanford, in an effort to grow
from a primarily undergraduate
institution into an integrated
undergraduate and graduate
university, built large salary
differentials to attract the "stars".
Commenting on this situation,
Rhinelander stated, "It's fine to
go out for prestigious faculty, but
you need bench strength."
Efforts To Reduce Inequities
Several professors emphasized
that while differentials remain
there has been a considerable
effort in the past decade to reduce
inequities caused by "market"
conditions.

Almond remarked that if the
University brings in people with
higher salaries, "in the long run
you bring up the lower salaries."
Faculty discussion of remedies
for the inequities in the present
salary structure were only
tentative, but the prevalent feeling
was that increased recognition of
the contribution of
teaching-oriented professors is
necessary.

In other developments, Bay
Area media continued to heed the
University's warning that those
who republish the contents of the
documents will face legal action.
However, Daily editor Mark
Weinberger said yesterday that
"The Daily has not ruled out the
possibility of reprinting the
information contained in the
document. We are currently
exploring all legal avenues."
Weinberger indicated that the
Daily has no plans to reprint the
five confidential faculty
evaluation documents.
