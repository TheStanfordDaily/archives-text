## Health In Reverse

information presented in Biology
199, a seminar on chemical and
biological warfare.)
The idea of using biological
weapons against an enemy is a
fairly recent one, as techniques of
warfare go, but the capacity of
various nations to do so has
developed rapidly since WW II
At Fort Detrick, the Army's
center for biological research,
workers have been studying such
agents as tularemia (rabbit fever),
brucellosis (undulant fever),
psittacosis, Rift Valley fever,
Q-fever, anthrax, plague, and
rabies. These diseases cover a wide
spectrum of effects, from the
temporary disabilities of Rift
Valley fever and Q-fever through
the chronic disabling effect of
brucellosis to the high fatality
rates of pneumonic plague and the
newly developed variety oi
pneumonic rabies.
It is also considered likely that
researchers are studying the use of

bacteria to produce various
toxins, by-products of bacterial
metabolism which are often more
lethal than the original organisms.
One example of this is botulinus
toxin, a virulent poison which acts
on the synapses of the central
nervous system.
Preventing Release
By preventing the release of
acetylcholine, a chemical
transmitter of neural 'messages,'
the toxin stops the body's
reflexes, such as breathing.
Because the toxin acts only on
neural cells, it is lethal even in
very small quantities, as little as
.12 milligrams. On this basis, one
ounce of botulinus toxin could be
enough to poison as many as
twenty-four million people.
Botulinus toxin is also favored
as a biological weapon because it
lacks some of the obvious
drawbacks of the living organisms.
Chief among these drawbacks is
the same property which makes
bacteria and viruses interesting as
agents of war: the capacity to
mutate and give rise to new forms.
At the same time that workers
in Fort Detrick are working to
develop agents which are not
vulnerable to the usual antibiotics
or natural immunity, they must
consider the possibility that, once
the agents are released, they may
undergo new mutations which
would make them a threat to the
attacking force as well as the
original targets.
Another argument against their
use is that biological warfare is, in
many cases, more specifically war
against a civilian population than
any other form of attack. Those
who are likely to be most
vulnerable to biological agents
include children, old people,
pregnant women, and the sick—all
non-combatants. A third
objection is an ecological one.
There is absolutely no way of
knowing what ihe effect of
saturating an area with

micro-organisms would be;
whether native animals, birds, or
insects would or would not
become carriers of new strains of
disease is completely
unpredictable. The possible
repercusson could be
unique—and disastrous.
Research Goes On
In the meantime, the research
goes on. New methods for
culturing bacteria in massive
numbers have been developed; in
six hours, Brucella organisms
sufficient to infect several million
people with brucellosis can be
grown. Projects designed to
produce antibiotic-resistant
bacteria coexist with projects to
add various 'mortality-enhancing
factors' to already existing strains.
Engineers study problems of
transport, storage, and delivery
systems, with interest centering
around the use of aerosols. Past
research has indicated that, when
dispersed as small particles in an
aerosol cloud, many agents
increase their infectivity by as
much as a thousand times.
Researchers are now
concentrating on the problem of
stabilizing germs which may be
destroyed by air and sunlight in
order to make them more easily
dispersed in the aerosol form.
The United States is certainly
not the only nation involved in
research in bacteriological
warfare. In fact, the relative
cheapness and ease of
development of these agents
practically assures a world-wide
interest in them. The potential for
a CBW arms race is greater than
that of the nuclear arms race, but
as yet, there has been no real
international effort at control.
Whether such controls will be or
can be developed remains to be
seen.
