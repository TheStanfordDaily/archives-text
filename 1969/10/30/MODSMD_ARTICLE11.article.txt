# From Israel
## Not So Distant 
### Dan Snell 
JERUSALEM, Oct. 18, 1969-1
am holding open the possibility
that I have already caught my
death of cold.
I am in an odd backwater area
of my life, before the beginning of
the university year here. I am still
planning to adventure a bit
around this two-hour busride
country. (That is from one
border, or rather front, to another
in two hours.) But my nose and
throat are flowing with impurities,
and the aspirin keeps me in a state
of near-awakeness.
But wishing my life to have
some momentary redeeming social
importance, I have been thinking
about travelling and why you do.
And I have only extracted from
experience the fact that when you
travel, you always accompany
yourself.
I would like to think Herodotus
or some other silly Greek first said
that. But since the rains began
here recently, I've perceived it to
be true for me too.
I came here, among other
reasons, to escape the memory of
a girl whose ghost has been
following me delicately and at a
distance for a couple of years
now. We used to walk around the
Outer Quad and read strange
books to each other, trying to
empathize with the grass growing.
But I was hoping that
Jerusalem—as Golda Meir duddily
put it,"the city of prophecy and
universal inspiration,"—would be
a place entirely distant.
The rain nowadays comes
sometimes in the late afternoon,

even occasionally after very bright
and hot days. And it usually
comes with violent and constant
lightening and thunder that for a
minute make everything shine
with a strange bright light. And
then there is darkness again.
When it rains hard, people in
Jerusalem jossle each other with a
special vehemence to get onto the
buses. And the sidewalks on hilly
streets get very slippery.
The Jewish New Year festival
that recently ended was originally
designed to ask for rain after the
long dry summers here—like the
New Year festival of the
Canaanites before them. This year
again the prayers have been
answered.
My prayers, or what passes for
prayers, are not answered, though.
Neither can I forget or can the
distant lady write me. One gets up
in the morning, brushes one's
teeth, and thinks about her some
more.
A while ago I met a friend of
hers who is here in the same
program as I at the Hebrew
University. But that is not the
problem. The friend was charming
enough.
Yet I have a cold, and a
classical conceit that in matters of
the heart there is a very small cat
egory of decision. What happens
to you, largely, happens.
And the lady is in the rain and
in the wind.

and the aspirin keeps me in a state
of near-awakeness.
But wishing my life to have
some momentary redeeming social
importance, I have been thinking
about travelling and why you do.
And I have only extracted from
experience the fact that when you
travel, you always accompany
yourself.
I would like to think Herodotus
or some other silly Greek first said
that. But since the rains began
here recently, I've perceived it to
be true for me too.
I came here, among other
reasons, to escape the memory of
a girl whose ghost has been
following me delicately and at a
distance for a couple of years
now. We used to walk around the
Outer Quad and read strange
books to each other, trying to
empathize with the grass growing.
But I was hoping that
Jerusalem—as Golda Meir duddily
put it,"the city of prophecy and
universal inspiration,"—would be
a place entirely distant.
The rain nowadays comes
sometimes in the late afternoon,

even occasionally after very bright
and hot days. And it usually
comes with violent and constant
lightening and thunder that for a
minute make everything shine
with a strange bright light. And
then there is darkness again.
When it rains hard, people in
Jerusalem jossle each other with a
special vehemence to get onto the
buses. And the sidewalks on hilly
streets get very slippery.
The Jewish New Year festival
that recently ended was originally
designed to ask for rain after the
long dry summers here—like the
New Year festival of the
Canaanites before them. This year
again the prayers have been
answered.
My prayers, or what passes for
prayers, are not answered, though.
Neither can I forget or can the
distant lady write me. One gets up
in the morning, brushes one's
teeth, and thinks about her some
more.
A while ago I met a friend of
hers who is here in the same
program as I at the Hebrew
University. But that is not the
problem. The friend was charming
enough.
Yet I have a cold, and a
classical conceit that in matters of
the heart there is a very small cat
egory of decision. What happens
to you, largely, happens.
And the lady is in the rain and
in the wind.

JERUSALEM, Oct. 18, 1969-1
am holding open the possibility
that I have already caught my
death of cold.
I am in an odd backwater area
of my life, before the beginning of
the university year here. I am still
planning to adventure a bit
around this two-hour busride
country. (That is from one
border, or rather front, to another
in two hours.) But my nose and
throat are flowing with impurities,
and the aspirin keeps me in a state
of near-awakeness.
