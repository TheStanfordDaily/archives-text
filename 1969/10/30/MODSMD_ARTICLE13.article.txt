# Preservation Hall Jazz Band
## Dixieland Played With Spunk 
### EDISON LIU 
When I was at the Reno Jazz
Festival, the ensemble that
brought the house down was an
elementary school jazz band from
Sunnyvale. They came out on top
of some of the most technically
advanced high school and college
jazz bands, not because of their
virtouosity—their set consisted of
three charts in a blues pattern
and basic arrangement—but be
cause of the enthusiasm. The
emotional impetus they displayed
is often the differentiating factor
between good sounds and poor
sounds.
At Cubberly High School last
Wednesday night, the Presentation
Hall Jazz Band demonstrated
what a bit of spunk could do to a
supposedly dying musical genre
called Dixieland Jazz.

Six mus 4 cians, five of whom are
over 65 yeard old, played their
instruments, pulled jokes, and
even danced around with childish
candor while performing both
popular and little known Dixie
land tunes—childish not in the
derogatory sense, but in the sense
that they have captured and
suspended within themselves the
playfulness and frovolity of child
hood and in turn, projected this
onto their audience.
Feeling The Way
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band is not a tight sounding band,
but this gave them the freedom of
expression where the chordal
structure of each tune restricted
them. Each musician had such an
ingrown feeling for Dixieland that
he didn't have to know what the
others were doing; he was feeling
it.
The concert started out with
Billie and DeDe Pierce in a lazy
but heavy blues. Billie, the only
female jazz pianist I have ever
heard, was consistant throughout
the concert in laying down rich,
moving chords with her right
hand, and a strong bass line with
her left—a style comparable to
gospel but differing in that the
emphasis is dispersed evenly
between the hands while gospel
relies much on a driving bass.
DeDe's coronet playing was
strong, weighed, and a bit out of
tune, but he was great. A musician
who cannot see his audience has
only his music by which to
communicate. Each time DeDe
played his horn or sang, he passed
on to his audience a bit of the
excitement he felt.
Jim Robinson, the Trombonist,
gave power to the ensemble's
sound with occasional trombone
blasts, driving solos and a strong
bass line. Though he was a reliable
musician, the tubist Allan Jaffe
did not match the rest of the band
in its hard, driving sounds. He is
also the owner of New Orlean's
Preservation Hall where the Band
is currently playing.
Outstanding Performance
But the two most exciting
musicians of the ensemble were
undoubtedly clarinetist, Willie
Humphrey, and drummer Dave

Oxley. Willie had not only the
technical ability but also an
understanding of his music and his
instrument. His solos were fluent,
full phrases saturated with runs
and arpeggios that built up and
lead to high tense notes.
Where Willie immediately
impresses you, Dave takes a while
before he is noticed. In the New
Orleans style of Dixieland, the
drummer is almost required to lay
down each beat, and in doing so,
Dave seemed like another
rinky-tink drummer. But dispel all
such thoughts. His solos and
breaks proved him to be a
talented percussionist. Snappy
rimshots, and ingenious rhythmic
combinations marked his style, a
style reminiscent of Buddy Rich
but not as long winded.
Results Are Good
When you put together such a
fine cast of performers, good
things happen, and they did. The
melody of a tune would be played

out by one ot the front line men
(DeDe, Jim, Willie) with the
others participating harmonically.
Then solos would come-each had
at least two solos throughout the
program; no one tried to be a
super star. The recapitulation of
the melody was the grand finale
where all the horn players stood
and played their hearts out in
Dixieland counterpoint—music
coming from all sides.
Though the forte of the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band was in
enthusiasm, two underlying
qualities became apparent as the
program progressed: showmanship
and spontaneity. They knew how
to get their audience involved
with their music. During the final
number, the band left the stage
and led the audience in a trot
around the auditorium to "When
the Saints Come Marching In."
The spontaneity comes in with
the freshness of their sound and
the soul that goes behind their
music.

and led the audience in a trot

The spontaneity comes in with
the freshness of their sound and
the soul that goes behind their
music.

When I was at the Reno Jazz
Festival, the ensemble that
brought the house down was an
elementary school jazz band from
Sunnyvale. They came out on top
of some of the most technically
advanced high school and college
jazz bands, not because of their
virtouosity—their set consisted of
three charts in a blues pattern
and basic arrangement—but be
cause of the enthusiasm. The
emotional impetus they displayed
is often the differentiating factor
between good sounds and poor
sounds.
At Cubberly High School last
Wednesday night, the Presentation
Hall Jazz Band demonstrated
what a bit of spunk could do to a
supposedly dying musical genre
called Dixieland Jazz.

Six mus 4 cians, five of whom are
over 65 yeard old, played their
instruments, pulled jokes, and
even danced around with childish
candor while performing both
popular and little known Dixie
land tunes—childish not in the
derogatory sense, but in the sense
that they have captured and
suspended within themselves the
playfulness and frovolity of child
hood and in turn, projected this
onto their audience.
Feeling The Way
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band is not a tight sounding band,
but this gave them the freedom of
expression where the chordal
structure of each tune restricted
them. Each musician had such an
ingrown feeling for Dixieland that
he didn't have to know what the
others were doing; he was feeling
it.
The concert started out with
Billie and DeDe Pierce in a lazy
but heavy blues. Billie, the only
female jazz pianist I have ever
heard, was consistant throughout
the concert in laying down rich,
moving chords with her right
hand, and a strong bass line with
her left—a style comparable to
gospel but differing in that the
emphasis is dispersed evenly
between the hands while gospel
relies much on a driving bass.
DeDe's coronet playing was
strong, weighed, and a bit out of
tune, but he was great. A musician
who cannot see his audience has
only his music by which to
communicate. Each time DeDe
played his horn or sang, he passed
on to his audience a bit of the
excitement he felt.
Jim Robinson, the Trombonist,
gave power to the ensemble's
sound with occasional trombone
blasts, driving solos and a strong
bass line. Though he was a reliable
musician, the tubist Allan Jaffe
did not match the rest of the band
in its hard, driving sounds. He is
also the owner of New Orlean's
Preservation Hall where the Band
is currently playing.
Outstanding Performance
But the two most exciting
musicians of the ensemble were
undoubtedly clarinetist, Willie
Humphrey, and drummer Dave

Oxley. Willie had not only the
technical ability but also an
understanding of his music and his
instrument. His solos were fluent,
full phrases saturated with runs
and arpeggios that built up and
lead to high tense notes.
Where Willie immediately
impresses you, Dave takes a while
before he is noticed. In the New
Orleans style of Dixieland, the
drummer is almost required to lay
down each beat, and in doing so,
Dave seemed like another
rinky-tink drummer. But dispel all
such thoughts. His solos and
breaks proved him to be a
talented percussionist. Snappy
rimshots, and ingenious rhythmic
combinations marked his style, a
style reminiscent of Buddy Rich
but not as long winded.
Results Are Good
When you put together such a
fine cast of performers, good
things happen, and they did. The
melody of a tune would be played

out by one ot the front line men
(DeDe, Jim, Willie) with the
others participating harmonically.
Then solos would come-each had
at least two solos throughout the
program; no one tried to be a
super star. The recapitulation of
the melody was the grand finale
where all the horn players stood
and played their hearts out in
Dixieland counterpoint—music
coming from all sides.
Though the forte of the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band was in
enthusiasm, two underlying
qualities became apparent as the
program progressed: showmanship
and spontaneity. They knew how
to get their audience involved
with their music. During the final
number, the band left the stage
and led the audience in a trot
around the auditorium to "When
the Saints Come Marching In."
The spontaneity comes in with
the freshness of their sound and
the soul that goes behind their

Though the forte of the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band was in
enthusiasm, two underlying
qualities became apparent as the
program progressed: showmanship
and spontaneity. They knew how
to get their audience involved
with their music. During the final
number, the band left the stage
and led the audience in a trot
around the auditorium to "When

The spontaneity comes in with
the freshness of their sound and

When I was at the Reno Jazz
Festival, the ensemble that
brought the house down was an
elementary school jazz band from
Sunnyvale. They came out on top
of some of the most technically
advanced high school and college
jazz bands, not because of their
virtouosity—their set consisted of
three charts in a blues pattern
and basic arrangement—but be
cause of the enthusiasm. The
emotional impetus they displayed
is often the differentiating factor
between good sounds and poor
sounds.
At Cubberly High School last
Wednesday night, the Presentation
Hall Jazz Band demonstrated
what a bit of spunk could do to a
supposedly dying musical genre
called Dixieland Jazz.

Six mus 4 cians, five of whom are
over 65 yeard old, played their
instruments, pulled jokes, and
even danced around with childish
candor while performing both
popular and little known Dixie
land tunes—childish not in the
derogatory sense, but in the sense
that they have captured and
suspended within themselves the
playfulness and frovolity of child
hood and in turn, projected this
onto their audience.
Feeling The Way
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band is not a tight sounding band,
but this gave them the freedom of
expression where the chordal
structure of each tune restricted
them. Each musician had such an
ingrown feeling for Dixieland that
he didn't have to know what the
others were doing; he was feeling
it.
The concert started out with
Billie and DeDe Pierce in a lazy
but heavy blues. Billie, the only
female jazz pianist I have ever
heard, was consistant throughout
the concert in laying down rich,
moving chords with her right
hand, and a strong bass line with
her left—a style comparable to
gospel but differing in that the
emphasis is dispersed evenly
between the hands while gospel
relies much on a driving bass.
DeDe's coronet playing was
strong, weighed, and a bit out of
tune, but he was great. A musician
who cannot see his audience has
only his music by which to
communicate. Each time DeDe
played his horn or sang, he passed
on to his audience a bit of the
excitement he felt.
Jim Robinson, the Trombonist,
gave power to the ensemble's
sound with occasional trombone
blasts, driving solos and a strong
bass line. Though he was a reliable
musician, the tubist Allan Jaffe
did not match the rest of the band
in its hard, driving sounds. He is
also the owner of New Orlean's
Preservation Hall where the Band
is currently playing.
Outstanding Performance
But the two most exciting
musicians of the ensemble were
undoubtedly clarinetist, Willie
Humphrey, and drummer Dave

Oxley. Willie had not only the
technical ability but also an
understanding of his music and his
instrument. His solos were fluent,
full phrases saturated with runs
and arpeggios that built up and
lead to high tense notes.
Where Willie immediately
impresses you, Dave takes a while
before he is noticed. In the New
Orleans style of Dixieland, the
drummer is almost required to lay
down each beat, and in doing so,
Dave seemed like another
rinky-tink drummer. But dispel all
such thoughts. His solos and
breaks proved him to be a
talented percussionist. Snappy
rimshots, and ingenious rhythmic
combinations marked his style, a
style reminiscent of Buddy Rich
but not as long winded.
Results Are Good
When you put together such a
fine cast of performers, good
things happen, and they did. The
melody of a tune would be played

out by one ot the front line men
(DeDe, Jim, Willie) with the
others participating harmonically.
Then solos would come-each had
at least two solos throughout the
program; no one tried to be a
super star. The recapitulation of
the melody was the grand finale
where all the horn players stood
and played their hearts out in
Dixieland counterpoint—music
coming from all sides.
