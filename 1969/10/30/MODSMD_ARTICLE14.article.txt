# Protest Moves Monday Night

### LARRY DIAMOND 
The November Vietnam
Moratorium will move into high
gear on November 3, when
Stanford students and faculty go
to the homes of citizens in the
surrounding communities to
watch and discuss the President's
nationally televised speech on
Vietnam.
Precinct leaders who led the
canvassing in last month's
Moratorium are being asked now
to contact the homeowner in their
precinct who offered his home as
a base for the canvassing in
October. This homeowner, and
any others in the precinct who
expressed an interest in working
for the Moratorium, will be asked
to open their house to their
neighbors and friends on the
evening of November 3. Together
with Stanford students they will
watch the President's speech and
discuss what it means to the
Moratorium.
Rich Luhring, a member of the
Moratorium planning committee,
told the Daily yesterday that
individual precinct leaders will be
encouraged to use their own
initiative in organizing the
November 3 discussion groups.
They will be given total
responsibility for arranging the
discussion groups in the
community and seeing that at
least two students (and possibly a
professor) are at each home where
the speech will be watched and
discussed.
Precinct leaders will also
arrange for discussion groups in
their dormitories, fraternities, or
whatever group they represent, on
the night of Nixon's speech.
At a meeting Monday night,
Moratorium Chairman John
Kramer told precinct captains, "It
is of the utmost importance that
people do not watch Nixon's

speech alone, but that they watch
it together and exchange views on
it." Kramer emphasised that the
exchange of ideas following the
speech is crucial, and that
Stanford students can offer a
viewpoint in this exchange that
might otherwise not be heard.
Citizens in the community are
more likely to be receptive to
Nixon's remarks, he said,
especially if the President
announces the withdrawal of
more troops. But the students,
Kramer said, must remind the
community of the objective of the
Moratorium —a rapid, timetabled
withdrawal of all our troops.
Kramer told the precinct
leaders that the discussion groups
in the community should also
consider what kinds of activities
should be conducted on Nov. 13
and 14. He expressed the hope
that the discussion groups would
"evolve into action groups."
Luhring pointed out that there
will be a new leaflet for students
to pass out on November 3. These
will be available beginning today
in the ASSU office.
The direction and activities of
the November Moratorium to be
held Nov. 13 and 14 is presently
being considered. A large
Community meeting is planned
for Sunday night at 7:30 in
Memorial Church to discuss this
subject. Kramer urges all those
with specific proposals for the
Moratorium to come to a meeting
at 4:15 on Thursday in the ASSU
office.
On November 5 or 6, Kramer
said, there will be a convocation
on campus where two political
experts will discuss the meaning
of the President's speech, and a
panel of students will comment
on it. More information on this
will be coming shortly.

to contact the homeowner in their
precinct who offered his home as
a base for the canvassing in
October. This homeowner, and
any others in the precinct who
expressed an interest in working
for the Moratorium, will be asked
to open their house to their
neighbors and friends on the
evening of November 3. Together
with Stanford students they will
watch the President's speech and
discuss what it means to the
Moratorium.
Rich Luhring, a member of the
Moratorium planning committee,
told the Daily yesterday that
individual precinct leaders will be
encouraged to use their own
initiative in organizing the
November 3 discussion groups.
They will be given total
responsibility for arranging the
discussion groups in the
community and seeing that at
least two students (and possibly a
professor) are at each home where
the speech will be watched and
discussed.
Precinct leaders will also
arrange for discussion groups in
their dormitories, fraternities, or
whatever group they represent, on
the night of Nixon's speech.
At a meeting Monday night,
Moratorium Chairman John
Kramer told precinct captains, "It
is of the utmost importance that
people do not watch Nixon's

speech alone, but that they watch
it together and exchange views on
it." Kramer emphasised that the
exchange of ideas following the
speech is crucial, and that
Stanford students can offer a
viewpoint in this exchange that
might otherwise not be heard.
Citizens in the community are
more likely to be receptive to
Nixon's remarks, he said,
especially if the President
announces the withdrawal of
more troops. But the students,
Kramer said, must remind the
community of the objective of the
Moratorium —a rapid, timetabled
withdrawal of all our troops.
Kramer told the precinct
leaders that the discussion groups
in the community should also
consider what kinds of activities
should be conducted on Nov. 13
and 14. He expressed the hope
that the discussion groups would
"evolve into action groups."
Luhring pointed out that there
will be a new leaflet for students
to pass out on November 3. These
will be available beginning today
in the ASSU office.
The direction and activities of
the November Moratorium to be
held Nov. 13 and 14 is presently
being considered. A large
Community meeting is planned
for Sunday night at 7:30 in
Memorial Church to discuss this
subject. Kramer urges all those
with specific proposals for the
Moratorium to come to a meeting
at 4:15 on Thursday in the ASSU
office.
On November 5 or 6, Kramer
said, there will be a convocation
on campus where two political
experts will discuss the meaning
of the President's speech, and a
panel of students will comment
on it. More information on this
will be coming shortly.
The November Vietnam
Moratorium will move into high
gear on November 3, when
Stanford students and faculty go
to the homes of citizens in the
surrounding communities to
watch and discuss the President's
nationally televised speech on
Vietnam.
Precinct leaders who led the
canvassing in last month's
Moratorium are being asked now
to contact the homeowner in their
