# Film on Pickets
## SDS Aids Strikes 
### 
Striking s t e e 1 workers,
employed by the Pittsburgh-Des
Moines Steel Company (PDM) in
Santa Clara, received welcome
support as more than 100 radicals,
students and non-students, turned
out for picket lines.
A film record of this strike,
accompanied by a
question-and-answer period led by
a worker from the PDM plant, will
be shown tonight at 7:30 by the
SDS Labor Committee.
Earlier this month, the
steelworkers (local 4028 of the
United Steelworkers of America),
had been out for six weeks in an
increasingly militant strike. They
were happy to see students out in
support.
At issue in the strike are PDM's
pay rates (between $.61 and
$1.42 an hour less than industry
scale in the Bay Area) and the
local's contract. The Steelworkers
have three-year contracts with
clauses barring strikes between
contract negotiation periods.
The strikers have been served
an injunction barring more than
four people from picketing
together. The student support
made a substantial difference,
since strikebreakers had to run the
gauntlet through the students
before they even got to the picket
line.
Fifty to sixty Santa Clara
policemen and sheriff's deputies

were necessary to guard the
strikebreaking workers.
PDM is clearly feeling the pinch
of the strike. One steelworker said
that the company had shipped out
hardly any structural steel since it
began; and that recently, PDM
had sent out a letter to the
workers complaining about their
treatment of strikebreakers.
The workers are becoming
increasingly militant, especially
towards strikebreakers, in their
effort to win the strike. A truck
which tried to run down a picket
was reportedly destroyed soon
afterwards, and on October 6
there were thirty flat tires outside
the plant.
Local 4028 is expecting a long
strike. Support is coming in from
local unions and from the
International. There is talk of
setting up a day nursery so wives
can help out with the strike.
Student support is growing.
Tonight, at 7:30 the SDS Labor
Committee is showing a film
about the PDM strike. A worker
from the plant will also speak and
answer questions. Also shown will
be a film about the Richmond Oil
Strike and one dealing with the
National Guard's occupation of
Wilmington, Del.
The program, which will last
about an hour and a half, will be
held in the Muir Lounge, Stern
Hall.

increasingly militant, especially
towards strikebreakers, in their
effort to win the strike. A truck
which tried to run down a picket
was reportedly destroyed soon
afterwards, and on October 6
there were thirty flat tires outside
the plant.
Local 4028 is expecting a long
strike. Support is coming in from
local unions and from the
International. There is talk of
setting up a day nursery so wives
can help out with the strike.
Student support is growing.
Tonight, at 7:30 the SDS Labor
Committee is showing a film
about the PDM strike. A worker
from the plant will also speak and
answer questions. Also shown will
be a film about the Richmond Oil
Strike and one dealing with the
National Guard's occupation of
Wilmington, Del.
The program, which will last
about an hour and a half, will be
held in the Muir Lounge, Stern
Hall.
Striking s t e e 1 workers,
employed by the Pittsburgh-Des
Moines Steel Company (PDM) in
Santa Clara, received welcome
support as more than 100 radicals,
students and non-students, turned
out for picket lines.
A film record of this strike,
accompanied by a
question-and-answer period led by
a worker from the PDM plant, will
be shown tonight at 7:30 by the
SDS Labor Committee.
Earlier this month, the
steelworkers (local 4028 of the
United Steelworkers of America),
had been out for six weeks in an
increasingly militant strike. They
were happy to see students out in
support.
At issue in the strike are PDM's
pay rates (between $.61 and
$1.42 an hour less than industry
scale in the Bay Area) and the
local's contract. The Steelworkers
have three-year contracts with
clauses barring strikes between
contract negotiation periods.
The strikers have been served
an injunction barring more than
four people from picketing
together. The student support
made a substantial difference,
since strikebreakers had to run the
gauntlet through the students
before they even got to the picket
line.
Fifty to sixty Santa Clara
policemen and sheriff's deputies

were necessary to guard the
strikebreaking workers.
PDM is clearly feeling the pinch
of the strike. One steelworker said
that the company had shipped out
hardly any structural steel since it
began; and that recently, PDM
had sent out a letter to the
workers complaining about their
treatment of strikebreakers.
The workers are becoming
increasingly militant, especially
towards strikebreakers, in their
effort to win the strike. A truck

was reportedly destroyed soon
