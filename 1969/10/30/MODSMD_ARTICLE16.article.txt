# Cards Out To Clean Up
## 
### FRED MANN 
One. Stanford and Oregon State have nearly identical season
records. Two. Last year, the Beavers easily beat the Indians, 29-7.
Three. OSU has been a last second winner this season while Stanford
has been the late game loser.
It all adds up to bad news for the Tribe when they go north to
booming Corvailis, Oregon, this Saturday for their seventh game of
the unhappy football season.
However, the facts sometimes lie. The Indians have been installed as
13-point favorites to clean up on the inconsistent Beavers, and the
spread may be low at that. If the visitors play anything close to a
decent game, Dee Andros, "the Great Pumpkin," may find his day
after Halloween quite a let down.
Oregon State is coming off a typical-Stanford loss, giving up a
touchdown in the final minutes to Utah, and losing, 7-3. It has been
that kind of a year for the Beavers as well as the Indians.
OSU played dead for UCLA in their opener and did not even
complete a pass until the fourth quarter of their 37-0 loss. After
murdering lowa and Arizona State, the Beavers then met USC, and
fell 31-7. But the highlight of the OSU season was two weeks ago,
against the winless Washington Huskies.
Washington shut out OSU for 60 minutes, and still lost the game.
The Beavers sailed a field goal through the goal posts with no time left
on the clock in the first half, and then came back to throw a TD pass
at the final gun of the game to win, 10-6.

The up and down season was expected of Oregon State from the
very beginning. The mighty almost-winners of last year are all gone
this time, and Coach Andros has been trying to salvage a successful
season with no experienced quarterbacks, nearly no black players, and
no Bill Enyart.
The Andros-Fred Milton beard controversy last winter shook the
club, and ended the careers of nearly all of the handful of blacks at
OSU. (The OSU Press Book pictures the IS squad members, only two
of them blacks).
The Beavers have simply not been able to jell thus far, and have
shown only flashes of excellence. They have a fairly good passing
defense which has never really been tested because every opponent
has been able to run on them instead.
Offensively, OSU has Billy Main, a very talented runner, and Steve
Endicott an adequate passer. That's all.
Jim Plunkett and Bubba Brown should find the Beavers quite a bit
easier than UCLA was last Saturday. Plunkett had one of his off-days
passing while Brown sparkled gaining 100 yards and the Outstanding
Offensive Player award. Defensive lineman Bill Alexander played his
best game of the year with 12 tackles to win the Outstanding
Defensive Player trophy.
The Tribe leads the league in total and passing offense, and ranks
among the top three teams in every department except pass defense
(where they are last).
