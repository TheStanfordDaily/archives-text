## Lag Seca 
### 
The annual Lake Lag car race
for the first place keg of beer in
being held November 2. For this
year's Lag Seca the course has
been considerably lengthened; it
includes the usual ramp jump,
figure of eight and the mud pit,
which could conceivably stretch
the entire lakebed. Added to the
course is the three hundred yard
drag straightaway ending in a 130
degree banked turn or onto the
golf course.
The three divisions for the race
are men's and women's
production, and foreign or off the
road vehicles. Lag Seca will start
promptly at 1:30 Sunday and best
viewing is from the boathouse
where concessions will be sold.
Entry fee for each race is ten
dollars and applications can be
obtained from Zeta Psi, the
perennial host of Lag Seca.
