# Faculty Club Dry!!!!
## 
### 
The Stanford faculty club is on
the wagon.
The ghost of Prohibition, dead
to the American public for 35
years, has returned to haunt the
faculty. The Alcoholic Beverages
Commission (ABC) has ordered
faculty members away from their
drink for at least a month.
The reason: keeping or serving
alcohol without a license is a
"public nuisance." The Club must
await formal licensing from the
state, a procedure that normally
takes 30 days.
On receipt of the notice from
ABC, Club president Roger Grey
closed the faculty liquor room.
The room is walled with small
lockers, each holding a professor's
favorite beverages. The locker
system allows spirits without a
formal bar, a system designed to
stretch the law.
Faculty reaction has been
restrained. Says Professor Sandy
Dornbush, "It's a real university
crisis." Presidential Assistant
Willard Wyman notes that in these
days of faculty hardship, the loss
of liquor is a "sad event." Says
Wyman, "It's our own booze and
we can't even get at it."
ABC's letter stated in part: "It
is a public nuisance for any person
to maintain any clubroom in
which any alcoholic beverage is
received or kept, or to which any
alcoholic beverage is brought, for
consumption on the
premises . . .unless the persons or
premises are licensed."
According to Grey, "they are
invoking a statute regarding bottle
clubs. This statute has been on the
books, but hasn't been enforced."
He indicated that the ABC is
apparently embarking on a
state-wide enforcement of the
statute.
The closing of the lockers will
be temporary. The club has
applied for a license. Meanwhile,
members will settle for Coca-Cola
and iced tea.

Grey sees change for the
faculty club once it is licensed.
"In addition to our present
system (where each member
provides his own liquor), we
would propose to serve beer at
lunch and wine at dinner."
Reports from other campuses
where ABC has invoked similar
rulings paint a bleak picture. One
school applied for a license two
years ago. Wyman warns students
to expect a siege of suddenly

returned papers and lively
lectures.
Legitimate business at the Club
has been proceeding as usualâ€”in
fact at a brisker pace. In addition
to the lockers, the club provides a
variety of dining facilities,
lounges, and guest accomodations.
According to Tresidder Union
director Forest Treagea, "the last
two days we've had the best lunch
business we've ever had."
