CHICAGO (AP)â€”Black Panther
Bobby G. Seale was gagged and
manacled to a metal folding chair
Wednesday after he refused to
remain silent in U.S. District
Court where he is on trial.
Judge Julius J. Hoffman, who
warned Seale repeatedly during
several outbursts Wednesday
morning, ordered Seale again at
the start of the afternoon session
to remain silent until the jury was
brought in.
Seale shouted, "Let me defend
myself, This is a form of racism."
Judge Hoffman ordered:"Take
that defendant into the other
room and deal with him as he
should be dealt with." Moments
later Seale was brought back into
the courtroom. A long white rag
was wrapped around his mouth
and his feet and hands were
individually handcuffed to a metal
folding chair.
Seale, 33, is national chairman
of the Black Panther Party, the
militant group that contends
Negroes should form a colony
within a white "mother country"
and advocates revolution.
During the trial, Seale has been

lodged in the federal tier of the
Cook County Jail on a fugitive
warrant from New Haven, Conn.,
where he is wanted on a murder
charge in connection with the
death of another Panther.
Just prior to Seale's third
outburst of the day, Judge
Hoffman warned William
Kunstler, defense counsel, for
asserting that the judge was
intimidating the defendants and
their lawyers.
"I will not listen to this
invective," the judge said, "I've
been called a racist, a fascist, and I
didn't think I'd live to sit in a
courtroom where a judge was
criticized for having George
Washington's picture on a wall."
This was in reference to Seale's
remark that "George Washington
was a slave owner."
For the last four days and
through many of the earlier
sessions of the trial Seale has
insisted that he is not represented
by counsel. He said he fired
Kunstler but the judge has ruled
that since Kunstler filed a general
appearance in behalf of all eight
defendants, Seale is represented.
