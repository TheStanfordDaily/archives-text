# Student Senate Results Revealed After Delay
## 
### CLINTON FROBISH 
After two weeks of computer
foul-ups, ASSU student senate
results were finally announced
yesterday with black students
appearing as the only sizable
voting block.
At the same time, election
commissioner Jim Galloway
announced his resignation. "This
has bombed out about four weeks
of my life and it's going to take
another four to straighten it all
out."
Eight members of the Black
Student Union (BSU) were
elected to the forty-man senate:
Leo Bazile, BSU chairman, Sloan
Blocker, Black House Director,
Mike Dawson, Freeman
Sensabaugh, Jon Sylvester, Doug
McHenry, Paul Williams, and
Loudin Beam.
The BSU had presented the
only organized slate during the
election.
BSU Senate Plans
Blocker commented "I didn't
think this many would be
elected." In regard to BSU plans
for the senate, he said that "first
and foremost is the matter of
budget organization. The BSU
can't do anything without
money."
Galloway stated that the
Vietnam referendum will take
another week to tabulate due to

difficulties with the senate
balloting.
Ann Kimball, sophomore in
General Studies, was the only
female elected. She ran "because I
was interested in making
government more human." She
was a member of LASSU for two
semesters last year and felt that
the old legislature was hampered
by an unworkably large number
of members and too strict reliance
on parliamentary procedure.
She is not involved in the
Women's Liberation Movement
but "I'm interested in some of
their ideas."
The new senate was approved
last spring by the student body in
a referendum to replace the old
legislature. The senate's
composition is intended to
represent students in proportion
to the size of their undergraduate
and graduate schools.
Since there are roughly an
equal number of graduate and
undergraduate students, the
forty-man senate is divided into
two twenty-seat groups.
Senate Composition
Within the undergraduate
ranks, ten members will represent
students majoring in Humanities
and Sciences, eight members from
General Studies (undeclared
majors), and two members from
Earth Science and Engineering.

For graduate students, six will
be from Humanities and Sciences,
six from Engineering, two from
the Business School, two from the
School of Medicine, and two from
the Law School.
There are also an equal number
of alternates for all positions.
Should any regular member of the
senate cease his senate
membership, his position shall be
awarded to the highest-ranking
alternate.
Hare System Complicated
N 1
The method used in electing
students to the senate was the
Hare system, a complicated
process in which voters list
preferences in descending order.
According to Galloway, "It was a
lot of work, and I don't know
whether it was worth it.
"As long as we're using the
Hare system, we'll have to use the
computer. But from now on I
don't think it will be this bad. I
spent the last ten days working
eighteen hours a day. I had to
write out the computer program."
ASSU Council of Presidents
member John Grube announced
that tonight's meeting will focus
on choosing student
representatives for the Student
Judicial Council selection
There will be an informal
meeting of elected students today
at noon in the ASSU office and a
work session tonight in room 75

The method used in electing

Hare system, a complicated

According to Galloway, "It was a

whether it was worth it.
"As long as we're using the
Hare system, we'll have to use the
computer. But from now on I
don't think it will be this bad. I
spent the last ten days working
eighteen hours a day. I had to
write out the computer program."

After two weeks of computer
foul-ups, ASSU student senate
results were finally announced
yesterday with black students
appearing as the only sizable
voting block.
At the same time, election
commissioner Jim Galloway
announced his resignation. "This
has bombed out about four weeks
of my life and it's going to take
another four to straighten it all
out."
Eight members of the Black
Student Union (BSU) were
elected to the forty-man senate:
Leo Bazile, BSU chairman, Sloan
Blocker, Black House Director,
Mike Dawson, Freeman
Sensabaugh, Jon Sylvester, Doug
McHenry, Paul Williams, and
Loudin Beam.
The BSU had presented the
only organized slate during the
election.
BSU Senate Plans
Blocker commented "I didn't
think this many would be
elected." In regard to BSU plans
for the senate, he said that "first
and foremost is the matter of
budget organization. The BSU
can't do anything without
money."
Galloway stated that the
Vietnam referendum will take
another week to tabulate due to

difficulties with the senate
balloting.
Ann Kimball, sophomore in
General Studies, was the only
female elected. She ran "because I
was interested in making
government more human." She
was a member of LASSU for two
semesters last year and felt that
the old legislature was hampered
by an unworkably large number
of members and too strict reliance
on parliamentary procedure.
She is not involved in the
Women's Liberation Movement
but "I'm interested in some of
their ideas."
The new senate was approved
last spring by the student body in
a referendum to replace the old
legislature. The senate's
composition is intended to
represent students in proportion
to the size of their undergraduate
and graduate schools.
Since there are roughly an
equal number of graduate and
undergraduate students, the
forty-man senate is divided into
two twenty-seat groups.
Senate Composition
Within the undergraduate
ranks, ten members will represent
students majoring in Humanities
and Sciences, eight members from
General Studies (undeclared
majors), and two members from
Earth Science and Engineering.

For graduate students, six will
be from Humanities and Sciences,
six from Engineering, two from
the Business School, two from the
School of Medicine, and two from
the Law School.
There are also an equal number
of alternates for all positions.

After two weeks of computer
foul-ups, ASSU student senate
results were finally announced
yesterday with black students
appearing as the only sizable
voting block.
At the same time, election
commissioner Jim Galloway
announced his resignation. "This
has bombed out about four weeks
of my life and it's going to take
another four to straighten it all
out."
Eight members of the Black
Student Union (BSU) were
elected to the forty-man senate:
Leo Bazile, BSU chairman, Sloan
Blocker, Black House Director,
Mike Dawson, Freeman
Sensabaugh, Jon Sylvester, Doug
McHenry, Paul Williams, and
Loudin Beam.
The BSU had presented the
only organized slate during the
election.
BSU Senate Plans
Blocker commented "I didn't
think this many would be
elected." In regard to BSU plans
for the senate, he said that "first
and foremost is the matter of
budget organization. The BSU
can't do anything without
money."
Galloway stated that the
Vietnam referendum will take
another week to tabulate due to

difficulties with the senate
balloting.
Ann Kimball, sophomore in
General Studies, was the only
female elected. She ran "because I
was interested in making
government more human." She
was a member of LASSU for two
semesters last year and felt that
the old legislature was hampered
by an unworkably large number
of members and too strict reliance
on parliamentary procedure.
She is not involved in the
Women's Liberation Movement
but "I'm interested in some of
their ideas."
The new senate was approved
last spring by the student body in
a referendum to replace the old
legislature. The senate's
composition is intended to
represent students in proportion
to the size of their undergraduate
and graduate schools.
Since there are roughly an
equal number of graduate and
undergraduate students, the
forty-man senate is divided into
two twenty-seat groups.
Senate Composition
Within the undergraduate
ranks, ten members will represent
students majoring in Humanities
and Sciences, eight members from
General Studies (undeclared
majors), and two members from
Earth Science and Engineering.

For graduate students, six will
be from Humanities and Sciences,
six from Engineering, two from
the Business School, two from the
School of Medicine, and two from
the Law School.
There are also an equal number
of alternates for all positions.
Should any regular member of the
senate cease his senate
membership, his position shall be
awarded to the highest-ranking
alternate.
Hare System Complicated
N 1
The method used in electing
students to the senate was the
Hare system, a complicated
process in which voters list
preferences in descending order.
According to Galloway, "It was a
lot of work, and I don't know
whether it was worth it.
"As long as we're using the
Hare system, we'll have to use the
computer. But from now on I
don't think it will be this bad. I
spent the last ten days working
eighteen hours a day. I had to
write out the computer program."
ASSU Council of Presidents

that tonight's meeting will focus
