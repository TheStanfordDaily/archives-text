# Conservatives Plan Programs
## Militant Moods Within YAF 
### TOM GIVEN 
Undaunted by jeers from
liberals and the left, the Stanford
chapter of the Young Americans
for Freedom (YAF) continues to
fight for the right. According to
Harvey Hukari, president of the
chapter, "We are moving to more
a militantly pro-freedom approach
than a gut anti-radical form."
Most significant of the plans
formulated at a meeting last night
was one to abolish the
compulsory aspects of student
government at Stanford. Hukari
claims that, "each student has to
pay $10 a year to finance political
pornographers such as Pat Shea
and his hydra-headed presidency."
They plan to collect the
signatures needed to call a
referundum next month to repeal
Article II of the ASSU
constitution. The article, makes
each Stanford student a member
of the ASSU and allows the
deductions for the financial
support of the organization.
"There are a lot of students
here who get no benefits from the
ASSU," explained Hukari. "It
should be put on a more
businesslike basis."
Also slated are speakers and

panel presentations, featuring a
wide range of opinions. First
speaker will be Rodger Manis, of
the Hoover Institution. A former
member of the national YAF
speaker's bureau, he will
explore the benefits of a volunteer
army next Wednesday at Q:3O at
the YAF house, 547 Lane B.
Panel presentations are still in
the planning stage, with the
first—on Rhodesia—to be held
sometime next month.
Considers Disaffiliation
Also on the agenda was a
discussion of the future of the
group's affiliation with the
national YAF. Chosen this
summer as the best chapter in the
nation, it is considering
disaffiliation should the state
chairman post go to the wrong
person.
This is but a reflection of the
enduring split within the radical
right. Vying for control of the
movement are the
traditionalists—a mixed bag
including pseudo-Birchers and
segregationists, and the
libertarians—radicals in the mold
of Ayn Rand and Milton
Friedman who fear the
encroachments of the state on the
individual.

The libertarians who compose
the Stanford chapter are not a
group of rednecks. Despite
popular stereotypes equating
conservatives with your Uncle
Henry in Des Moines, they are
well road in both general political
information and mo re
conservative tracts. They appear
to deplore what some members
term "a creeping Young
Republicanism, which is
concerned with its image,"
preferring, much like other radical
groups, to stand for its principles.
Strive For Popular Support
They are not unaware to the
power of popular support,
however. Leaders of the group
hope that future activities will
weaken the left's hold on the
political limelight, and that
continued weekly publication of
the Arena will continue to present
news and comment that other
campus publications might ignore.
The hope to accomplish this
without abandoning the fight
against SDS and other left-wing
organizations. "The radicals are
going to be tied up in court for
about three months," indicated
Hukari. "Nonetheless, we may
have to man the barricades again."
