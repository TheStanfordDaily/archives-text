## Woman At The Top 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Joyce Kobayashi brushed back
a few strands of her waist-length
black hair and said, "A student
body president operates
somewhere between tolerance and
impatience.
"The impatience comes with
the amount of time it takes to get
something through. I don't have
such a grand image of the
university and its structure
anymore." She smiled. "But
there's tolerance too when you
see that there's a close tie between
yourself and other individuals."
She speaks carefully, weighing
each word. The other members of
the Council of Presidents describe
her as the less political one, an
individual who focuses herself
intensely on her specific interests.
According to another Council
member, Joyce is "a kind of
Japanese Jewish mother."
But she doesn't come across as
any sort of management
perfectionist. She talks quietly,
betraying no nervousness, and her
smooth, frequent smiles come
quickly and naturally.
"My one main interest this
quarter is the SES
recommendatioas." Already she
has helped to set up SWOPSI
(Student Workshops on Political
and Social Issues), a series of
student and faculty initiated
courses with concerns ranging
from logging policies in California
to disarmament negotiations.
"I want it. to stay flexible with

a policy board of six students and
five faculty members with maybe
a small staff. The courses are
primarily direct action ones."
Along with her SWOPSI plans,
she is trying to integrate the
Volunteer Services Center into
classroom courses so that students
can receive credit for their outside
volunteer work.
Her interests also extend to the
Committee on Education and
Employment of Women. "There
are many role stereotypes here
that militate against women.
There are no part-time graduate
programs for women with
families. The committee's useful
because it provides an organized
focus on these problems."
After cataloging all her interests
she smiled and said, "I don't
consider any of it earth-shaking."
She has not met with total
success on all her programs, and
the real problems surface when
she tries to carry out her ideas.
"The basic core project itself isn't
too hard to work out. It's
peripheral things that get in the
way, the bureaucratic structure.
For instance, there are no obvious
fund sources for some things. Or
they'll be ad hoc efforts, and its
not clear whose responsibility the
new plan is."
With SWOPSI Joyce had her
introduction to these "tolerance
and impatience" hassles. "A lot of
the work was fruitless. There was
a great deal of typing and work
like that that I just couldn't ask

friends to do. Just secretarial
dogwork." She paused and then
added, "You find that leadership
turns to management."
All of this work takes up a
great deal of time. "I spend half
my time going to school, half of
my time here with ASSU matters,
and half my time with my
friends," she joked. "You really
need friends to keep a soul in
basic peace. I'm afraid my
classwork suffers most."
She pointed to a Sierra Club
poster on the wall that said "In
wildness is the preservation of the
world," and remarked, "That's
the way we feel around here."
She turned back to her job. "I
gueas I've learned a lot from my
work here. SWOPSI if expanded
could reilly be worthwhile. Also
with this job I'm always meeting
different people. But you find
people are always trying to put
you in an administrational slot."
Joyce likes the four member
Council set-up with its divided
responsibilities. "Working alone
affords us a great deal of
independence," she said. So far
each of the four have gone their
own way to the point that they
don't meet together as often as
they should she feels. "It thwarts
our ideas, and we lose touch with
each other."
"We don't always agree, but I
worry when we stop yelling at
each other. You know you have
to do it, and we're all friend's as
well."
