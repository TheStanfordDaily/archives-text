Editor, THE DAILY :
Over the past two years during
which I have been in residence at
Stanford, I have witnessed
numerous acts of journalistic
irresponsibility on the part of the
Daily to which the accusatory
phrase, "You have reached a new
low," might justly have been
applied. There is, however, no
doubt of its applicability to your
action in reprinting confidential
faculty evaluations from the
Political Science Department (and
possibly other departments, as
you threaten to do) pilfered from
Administration files last spring.
In this case your real motives
are even more transparent than
usual, and you failed to obfuscate
them very much in the editorial
statement of self-justification
printed in today's issue under the
ironic title "Academic
Freedom?".
In both the editorial and in the
earlier article disclosing
confidential salary and evaluation
data, you refer to the
"longstanding feud" in which the
Political Science Department
allegedly "has been embroiled,"
between faculty members favoring
behavioral or non-behavioral
approaches to the discipline.
You betray yourselves with the
line which follows this factually
inaccurate reference: "Disclosure
of the salary differentials [to say
nothing of the confidential
evaluations] could add flames to
the smoldering feud."
Pouring "Oil on troubled water
has been a specialty of the Daily
during the period in which I have
monitored its "output" (perhaps
the least pejorative term which
could be used); and the faculty
evaluation "expose" clearly stands
in this sorry tradition.
Your readers should know,
however, that the conflict which
you hope to exacerbate by raising
the cry of discrimination against
those favoring a traditional
approach in political science has
not "embroiled" members of the
Department in "a bitter fight over
various approaches to the
discipline" for many years.
Your reference is to a
controversy which did affect most
of the major Political Science
departments in the nation during
the late 1950's and early '60's,
including the department at
Stanford. It has long since been
resolved in favor of peaceful

coexistence and a pluralistic
approach to the discipline.
Your editorial effort to imbue
the act of campus-wide
dissemination of illegally obtained

faculty data with an air of
righteousness and sincere concern
for correcting certain imbalances
in salary schedules fails
pathetically.
It is obvious that your real
concern lies in altering the
"distribution of power within the
university" and in "adding llames
to smoldering feuds" within the
university structure, even if the
latter may exist only as a figment
of your overactive imagination.
Hopefully the Daily and any
other campus publication which
has been responsible for
dissemination of the stolen data
will be prosecuted, to the fullest
extent of the law. Unfortunately
it appears that this sort of
punitive action will be necessary
to restore some measure of
journalistic responsibility and
integrity to student publications
at Stanford.
