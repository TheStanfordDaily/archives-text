# Senate Told Budget Squeeze May Reduce Some Programs
## 
### 
Top University officers told the
Faculty Senate yesterday that
Stanford must prepare for a $2.5
million belt-tighteningprogram over
the next four years.
For the first time in recent
years, Provost Richard Lyman
explained, the University must
face cuts in existing programs and
elimination of some faculty and
staff positions. Lyman and
President Kenneth Pitzer asked
help in planning a major fund
drive to offset decreases in growth
of federal and foundation grants.
Lyman secured unanimous
Senate approval for a six-person
ad hoc Committee on Longrange
Financial Planning to help in the
budget pruning process. The
committee will include two
students and four faculty
members.

The Senate will also create a
committee to plan a major fund
drive equal in scope to Stanford's
successful PACE drive of the early
sixties.
Although the total budget will
continue to grow, it will not be
growing as fast as in recent years.
Only "substantial reductions" in
present programs will permit the
University to fund needed
innovations and escape "a
downward spiral of
ever-deepening deficits," Lyman
said.
Stanford's fiscal problems are
"serious, but not insoluble," he
added
Partial Hiring Freeze
Pending administrative review
of next year's budget base and
effective operation of a new
student-faculty committee on
long-range financial planning,
Lyman has asked deans and
department heads to hold any
current vacancies open until they
are individually reviewed and
authorized.
"While the budget base is under
review, it would be foolhardy to
undertake commitments to new
personnel one week, only to
decide the week following that
the position in question was
dispensable or at least a likely
candidate for elimination," he
explained.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice
president for finance, said the
biggest single factor slowing the
University's fiscal growth is a
projected decline in federally
sponsored research from $44
million in 1968 to $42 million in
1969, $40 million in 1970 and

possibly as low as $37 million in
academic 1970-71.
Cold Climate
"There seems to be no reason
to expect, given the climate
throughout the country and
particularly in Washington, that
there will be any substantial
federal programs which will offset
the kind of reduced support of
research and graduate programs
that we are now experiencing," he
said.
Lyman said "the marked
cooling of public affection for the
universities in the face of building
takeovers, arson, and the rest"
comes at a time when many
campuses are anxious to innovate
and also to partially democratize
decision-making.
Changes in research policy last
spring cost Stanford about
$500,000 annually in unrestricted
income which otherwise would
have been paid as indirect costs on
classified research projects, he
reported.
In the past, Stanford's
budgeting practices have focused
on "how to divide the added pie
that rising income provided, not
how to reslice a pie of unchanged
or only very slowly growing size,"
Lyman noted.
More Severe
Pitzer said several other
institutions in the Association of
American Universities face
"considerably more severe" fiscal
crises.
Cuthbertson told the faculty
Senate that the largest single
increase in 1970-71 expenditures
will be increases in non-faculty
salaries, tentatively set at 6.5 per
cent on the average. This

compares with a faculty average
of about 4.5 per cent "making no
improvement vis-a-vis the
competition," in his words.
Increases in social security and
health benefits paid by the
University for both groups would
be in addition to the salary
increases.
Personnel Reductions
Cuts in the present budget base
are necessary to help fund these
increases, he pointed out. This
will mean reductions in
personnel" because that's where
the bulk of our expenditures go."
The $2.5 million reduction
amounts to a little less than five
per cent of the University's
operating budget, which now runs
about $52 million annually. This
figure does not include sponsored
research, self-supporting auxiliary
enterprises (such as housing), or
capital expenditures on new
buildings.
In a similar vein, Lyman noted,
"The great bulk of Stanford's
operating budget is academic,
which makes somewhat illusory
the notion that we could save vast
quantities of money while leaving
the present academic operation
untouched."
Lyman indicated that broader
partipation in University
decision-making probably will
have inflationary effects. "Budget
making by consensus is bound to
carry with it strong inflationary
tendencies and marked
disadvantages for the politically
weak programs, regardless of their
quality or their long-run
importance to the University."
