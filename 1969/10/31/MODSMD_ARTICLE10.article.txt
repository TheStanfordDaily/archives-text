# Worker Protest
## Wage Crisis 
### 
(The following statement was
released by the Steering
Committee of the United
Stanford Employees, USE)
The Stanford Administration
has escalated its efforts to 'cut
costs' by proposing to eliminate
the painting and carpentry shops.
All eighteen employees, many of
them older workers and some near
retirement, were advised to look
for another job and were given
several months to prepare
themselves for premature
retirement.
The claim that Stanford
employees do not need
unemployment insurance or more
job security because Stanford is
such a 'good place to work' is
revealed as a bitter joke. It's not
even a good place to get fired
from.
Management, unable to
organize and manage a shop that
can compete with outside
contractors in maintainence work
at Stanford, is now threatening to
fire the workers and keep the
overhead. How is it going to cut
costs if of the $9.50/ hr. charged
for the job, only $4.50/ hr. goes to
pay the worker's salary?
The effort is an escalation
because they are not just 'cutting
back' on painting and repairs,
they are proposing to cut them
out! We shall see whether the rest
of the campus can do without.
But if contracting-out is so
efficient then why don't they
contractors contract-out? Also
why shouldn't the Stanford
Electronics Lab be contracted-out
to Hewlett-Packard or SLAC to
Varian Associates?
Real Motives
But the Administration's real
motives are still hidden as they
say this action concerns only
them and the eighteen. The
United Stanford Employees
(USE) challenges that attitude and
calls on all Stanford employees,
students, faculty, benevolent
administrators—all members of
the Stanford community to
respond to this violation of
justice.
The USE Steering Committee
proposes that:

1. As employees were not
hired in order to throw away
money so they should not be fired
in order to save money. They
were hired to do a job and if the
job requirements have changed
then reorganization and/or
retraining can preserve the
employee's proven worth. No
layoffs
2. That Management shall
cease their psychological warfare
in threatening employees with
layoffs. Workers, students and
faculty are all hard at work
making Stanford 'work' and all
should be able to function free of
threats and coercion and have
some say in their working
conditions. No threats
3. That the Trustees respect
the human dignity of their
poorest employees and raise the
minimum wage to the $450 per
month established for Hospital
employees. Equal treatment
4. That job classifications and
salary ranges be declassified and
publicized. No secrecy
5. That Stanford recognize
inflation and provide for
cost-of-living increases separately
from merit increases. No wage
cuts

overhead. How is it going to cut
costs if of the $9.50/ hr. charged
for the job, only $4.50/ hr. goes to
pay the worker's salary?
The effort is an escalation
because they are not just 'cutting
back' on painting and repairs,
they are proposing to cut them
out! We shall see whether the rest
of the campus can do without.
But if contracting-out is so
efficient then why don't they
contractors contract-out? Also
why shouldn't the Stanford
Electronics Lab be contracted-out
to Hewlett-Packard or SLAC to
Varian Associates?
Real Motives
But the Administration's real
motives are still hidden as they
say this action concerns only
them and the eighteen. The
United Stanford Employees
(USE) challenges that attitude and
calls on all Stanford employees,
students, faculty, benevolent
administrators—all members of
the Stanford community to
respond to this violation of
justice.
The USE Steering Committee
proposes that:

1. As employees were not
hired in order to throw away
money so they should not be fired
in order to save money. They
were hired to do a job and if the
job requirements have changed
then reorganization and/or
retraining can preserve the
employee's proven worth. No
layoffs
2. That Management shall
cease their psychological warfare
in threatening employees with
layoffs. Workers, students and
faculty are all hard at work
making Stanford 'work' and all
should be able to function free of
threats and coercion and have
some say in their working
conditions. No threats
3. That the Trustees respect
the human dignity of their
poorest employees and raise the
minimum wage to the $450 per
month established for Hospital
employees. Equal treatment
4. That job classifications and
salary ranges be declassified and
publicized. No secrecy
5. That Stanford recognize
inflation and provide for
cost-of-living increases separately
from merit increases. No wage
cuts
(The following statement was
released by the Steering
Committee of the United
Stanford Employees, USE)
The Stanford Administration
has escalated its efforts to 'cut
costs' by proposing to eliminate
the painting and carpentry shops.
All eighteen employees, many of
them older workers and some near
retirement, were advised to look
for another job and were given
several months to prepare
themselves for premature
retirement.
The claim that Stanford
employees do not need
unemployment insurance or more
job security because Stanford is
such a 'good place to work' is
revealed as a bitter joke. It's not
even a good place to get fired
from.
Management, unable to
organize and manage a shop that
can compete with outside
contractors in maintainence work
at Stanford, is now threatening to
fire the workers and keep the
overhead. How is it going to cut
costs if of the $9.50/ hr. charged
for the job, only $4.50/ hr. goes to
pay the worker's salary?
