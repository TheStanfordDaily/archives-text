# Need For Action
## Campus Alienation 
### Pat Windham PAT WINDHAM 
Stanford's basically a groovy
place for freshmen. The new
people, the new ideas, and the
new freedom make the University
a great place to be.
But Stanford can also be a
lonely place sometimes. A lot of
it, of course, is just being away
from home and old friends; and
there are a great many new friends
and a lot of fun in this place. One
doesn't feel lonely often; with
classes, homework, and beer busts
there really isn't too much time
for it.
Yet, in still moments like early
on a Saturday night or on a
Sunday afternoon, one can feel
very lonely. And it goes deeper
than just being away from home.
It's the problem, at least for
myself and I believe many others,
of being unable to always easily
relate to other people in a society
which often truly produces
alienation.
People need to be alone with
themselves at times; they need to
be unique and individual. And
Stanford students are especially
unique and independent of the
mainstream of society
Unusual Intelligence
They are supposedly here
because of their unusual
intelligence and sensitivity. So if
many of them are somewhat
loners, as I am, I think it's
understandable that they may
have some problems completely
fitting in.
The University doesn't help the
situation too much. There isn't a
great deal of alienation here; and
the issue is, of course, by no
means simply a problem at
Stanford and no where else.
But of all human institutions a
university should try to help
break down the barriers in
interpersonal relationships. And
so far Stanford has not really
made such an effort. They provide
psychiatric for those in serious
trouble; and yet do little for
others whose problem, while not
so extreme, is nonetheless real.
Close Fricnds
Dorms and coed living help
somewhat. They give one the
opportunity to make some close
friends from members of both
sexes. Coed living is naturally
limited, though, by the lopsided
boy-girl ratio, and as a male I
must Say I feel the crunch. But it's
not my point here to go into that.

What is important here is that
these measures don't go far
enough in promoting more
meaningful relationships. I think
every student here must have felt
at one time or another that life at
Stanford seems artifical, that the
University is often a plastic,
unreal place. And, as someone
pointed out in a recent Daily, how
many times have you seen people
eating all alone in the cafeteria?
Or, for that matter, how many
times have you eaten alone and
wished there was someone to talk
to? No, Stanford remains very
often a somewhat lonely paradise.
Some University people realize
that there is a real problem, but
they are a distinct minority in
facing up to the situation.
University Failed
Dr. Joseph Katz, a psychiatrist
at the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems, said in
Cross-Currents a while ago that
the University is often full of
"loneliness, isolation, and
alienation," that the dorms are
places which don't provide the
"important emotional needs for
closeness and intimacy." The
article went on to cite how the
university environment has failed
in many ways, in and out of the
classroom, to meet the needs of
its students.
Encounter groups may be the
answer, but I must admit that
personally I don't really know
much about them. The
above-mentioned article said that
Cowell officials are studying the
encounter concept closely, with
due consideration to possible
misuses of it.
But properly led encounters,
especially those conducted by
regular faculty members with
encounter training, seem to have
met with considerable success
over the past couple of years. One
was started in my dorm a few
weeks ago, but I didn't then think
I'd have the time for it. If they
start another, I'll make the time.
I can't say if encounter groups
are the answer to breaking down
the barriers which certainly exist
here. But something should and
must be done. The problem of
alienation on campus is real, and
it should not be ignored by
anyoneâ€”not if Stanford is to
claim it is truly providing relevent
preparation for useful and
meaningful roles in society.
