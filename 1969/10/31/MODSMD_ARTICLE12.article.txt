WASHINGTONâ€”A lady has
written to the Washington Post
accusing me of writing Vice
President Sprio Agnew's funny
speech in New Orleans,
concerning the people who
participated in the moratorium.
I am very flattered that this
lady would think that I am
writing Vice President Agenw's
speeches, as they are probably the
best humor being produced in this
country at the moment. But I
must disclaim all credit. Mr.
Agnew has never asked me to
write humorous speeches for him
and I have never volunteered.
The question of who wrote the
antimoratorium speech, which the
Vice President gave with his
typical socko delivery, is being
speculated all over Washington.
Mr. Agnew is a very close
friend of Bob Hope, and it is
believed he might have gotten
help from Mr. Hope's writers. But
the Vice President also happens to
have friends on Laugh-In, and
many people swear Mr. Agnew's
reference to "impudent snobs and
intellectuals" is a typical Laugh-In
throwaway line.
All His Own
Jackie Gleason, who happens
to be President Nixon's good
friend, may have had a hand in
the final draft of the speech,
particularly where the Vice
President called everyone
masochists.
But from all I can discover the

Vice President is, for the main,
writing his own stuff. While he
may consult a comedy writer for
an occasional thought or gag, the
Vice President prefers to write his
own material which he delivers in
his now famous dead-pan style.
This, according to an intimate
friend, is how the Vice President
works on his speeches. First he
studies the occasion. The
Republican fund-raising dinner in
New Orleans obviously was a
lighthearted affair and Mr. Agnew
knew he was expected to be
humorous and topical.
Nixon Copy Reads
Since the Oct. 15 moratorium
had just taken place, the Vice
President decided to do his funny
monologue around the people
who participated in he protest.
For every good laugh, the Vice
President discarded 10. Finally, he
had it shaped up, and he took it
to the President who read it and
chuckled all the way through.
"You're going to knock 'em
dead with this one," the President
said.
"How do you like that line
about impudent snobs?" the Vice
President said.
Household Words
The President could hardly
contain himself. "This thing about
'effete corps' is beautiful. I wish I
could come down and see you
give it."
"I wish you could, too."
"Spiro, you've said some funny
things in your time, but you've
outdone yourself on this one. This
speech will make you another
household word."
Sense of Humor
"You don't think anyone will
take me seriously, do you?" Mr.
Agnew asked.
The President wiped tears of
laughter from his eyes. "How
could they? This country hasn't
lost its sense of humor yet."
With the President's approval,
Mr. Agnew went to New Orleans
and, as everyone knows, he
wowed not only the audience, but
millions who saw him on
television. Overnight, the Vice
President lifted the country out of
its depression and had everyone
laughing.
AII His Oh n
No Vice President in modern
times has been able to constantly
do this as well as Spiro Agnew.
And the thing that has official
Washington amazed is that he's
doing almost all of it by himself.
