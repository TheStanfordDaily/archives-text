# Housing Proposal
## Cluster Colleges 
### John Bowen 
The problems of student
housing, proper use of
undeveloped land on Stanford
property, and restricted
admissions have been aired
frequently this year, figuring
heavily in the recent Student
Senate campaigns, in the activities
of campus political organizations,
and in the formation of many
on-and-off-campus groups.
Until now, these issues have
been approached largely as
separate entities, perhaps
accounting partially for the
seeming dominance in
decision-making in these areas by
some of the more conservative
interests in the community.
A recently introduced plan
would attempt to resolve some of
these issues by capitalizing on
their commonalities to create an
educational-residential
environment in the open lands
west of the present campus.
The idea was originally
conceived by Jack Truher, an
engineering physicist at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC). It would entail
the construction of a number of
small residential colleges, to be
associated with the main campus
through sharing of major lectures
and scientific laboratories.
First Priority
The notion of a cluster college
system is not without precedent.
De Anza, Foothill, and Claremont
Colleges have been organized in
similar manners. In fact, our own
University-sponsored Study of
Education at Stanford
recommended that "it (the
University) give first priority to
the creation of. . .campus towns,
which will be the residential
focuses for communities of up to
1,500 epople each." (emphasis
mine)

More Students
In addition to providing
necessary new housing, the
proposal would greatly expand
the undergraduate capacity of the
University, something the
administration hasn't seen fit to
do in spite of steep rises in the
demand for undergraduate
education.
The University has yet to take
any action to consider or discuss
Truber's proposal (unusual in view
of the high degree of pressure for
solutions to the housing problem,
perhaps not so in view of the
financially attractive proposals for
industrial use of the land under
discussion).
Unnamed Source
Indeed, their sole
"contribution" to date was to
send an "unnamed source" to do
battle with Truber in the Palo
Alto Tim es
An article on Truber's plan,
which appeared in the October
10th issue, included a statement
by the above-described "person"
that accused the proposal of being
"pie-in-the-sky," and compared it
to a 1946 proposal to blanket
Stanford acreage with tract
houses.
According to Truber, "I was
assured by the news service that
the individual in quesiton had not
even seen the proposal." That
became ovbious upon reading the
text of the proposal, since
Truber's plan would not
"blanket" anything, would not
involve tract houses, and has as its
major goal the improvement of
education, rather than housing per
se.
Financing
Obviously, a choice will have to
be made by the University as to
the uses that are to be made of
available monetary and terrain

resources. With this statement, the
endless industry-education debate
is called to mind, with its many
justifications for spending large
amounts on both aspects of the
university (pardon the
simplification).
However, Truber's plan carries
with it some unique monetary
justifications that might weigh
heavily in the cerebrums of
University officials. The first is
contained in the fact that separate
colleges would exist, with separate
money-raising capacities.
Louis Benezet, formerly
president of the Claremont college
group, demonstrated that a fund
drive in the name of the individual
college will flourish when a united
drive by the parent organization
will fail. Truber's proposal would
allow the creation of innovative
environmental entities, an idea
that evidently carries more appeal
to many potential doners than
does a request for simply an
addition to the present structure.
Low Cost Housing
Another important portion of
the plan is its capacity for
construction of housing which
could, although not necessarily
would, be utilized for low-cost
housing for the community. This
unique combination of "social
action" with expanded education
and opportunity for innovative
experimentation would provide
foundations and federal officials
with a more attriactive approach
than simply requests for "more
money" for fewer people.
The cluster-college plan would
demand a greater share of the
university's resources to be
allocated for liberal education
than has been the case preciously.
The increasing technologization of
society (coming in part from the
universities), and the inability of
an increasing number of citizens
to relate effectively to that
technology have been seen by
many, e.g. economist Robert
Theobold, to demand a
re-emphasis on the development
of the "classically-educated"
citizen. This, unlike the pursuit of
pure research, is a function that
can, given our present structures,
only be performed by the
universities. Ironically, it is an
individual deeply involved in the
"industrialization function" (as he
terms it) who is proposing such a
re-allocation.
Perhaps the best course of
action at present is a
"moratorium" on further land
development until plans such as
Truber's can be fully studied.

and in the formation of many
on-and-off-campus groups.
Until now, these issues have
been approached largely as
separate entities, perhaps
accounting partially for the
seeming dominance in
decision-making in these areas by
some of the more conservative
interests in the community.
A recently introduced plan
would attempt to resolve some of
these issues by capitalizing on
their commonalities to create an
educational-residential
environment in the open lands
west of the present campus.
The idea was originally
conceived by Jack Truher, an
engineering physicist at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC). It would entail
the construction of a number of
small residential colleges, to be
associated with the main campus
through sharing of major lectures
and scientific laboratories.
First Priority
The notion of a cluster college
system is not without precedent.
De Anza, Foothill, and Claremont
Colleges have been organized in
similar manners. In fact, our own
University-sponsored Study of
Education at Stanford
recommended that "it (the
University) give first priority to
the creation of. . .campus towns,
which will be the residential
focuses for communities of up to
1,500 epople each." (emphasis

More Students
In addition to providing
necessary new housing, the
proposal would greatly expand
the undergraduate capacity of the
University, something the
administration hasn't seen fit to
do in spite of steep rises in the
demand for undergraduate
education.
The University has yet to take
any action to consider or discuss
Truber's proposal (unusual in view
of the high degree of pressure for
solutions to the housing problem,
perhaps not so in view of the
financially attractive proposals for
industrial use of the land under
discussion).
Unnamed Source
Indeed, their sole
"contribution" to date was to
send an "unnamed source" to do
battle with Truber in the Palo
Alto Tim es
An article on Truber's plan,
which appeared in the October
10th issue, included a statement
by the above-described "person"
that accused the proposal of being
"pie-in-the-sky," and compared it
to a 1946 proposal to blanket
Stanford acreage with tract
houses.
According to Truber, "I was
assured by the news service that
the individual in quesiton had not
even seen the proposal." That
became ovbious upon reading the
text of the proposal, since
Truber's plan would not
"blanket" anything, would not
involve tract houses, and has as its
major goal the improvement of
education, rather than housing per
se.
Financing
Obviously, a choice will have to
be made by the University as to
the uses that are to be made of
available monetary and terrain

resources. With this statement, the
endless industry-education debate
is called to mind, with its many
justifications for spending large
amounts on both aspects of the
university (pardon the
simplification).
However, Truber's plan carries
with it some unique monetary
justifications that might weigh
heavily in the cerebrums of
University officials. The first is
contained in the fact that separate
colleges would exist, with separate
money-raising capacities.
Louis Benezet, formerly
president of the Claremont college
group, demonstrated that a fund
drive in the name of the individual
college will flourish when a united
drive by the parent organization
will fail. Truber's proposal would
allow the creation of innovative
environmental entities, an idea
that evidently carries more appeal
to many potential doners than
does a request for simply an
addition to the present structure.
Low Cost Housing
Another important portion of
the plan is its capacity for
construction of housing which
could, although not necessarily
would, be utilized for low-cost
housing for the community. This
unique combination of "social
action" with expanded education
and opportunity for innovative
experimentation would provide
foundations and federal officials
with a more attriactive approach
than simply requests for "more
money" for fewer people.
The cluster-college plan would
demand a greater share of the
university's resources to be
allocated for liberal education
than has been the case preciously.
The increasing technologization of
society (coming in part from the
universities), and the inability of
an increasing number of citizens
to relate effectively to that
technology have been seen by
many, e.g. economist Robert
Theobold, to demand a
re-emphasis on the development
of the "classically-educated"
citizen. This, unlike the pursuit of
pure research, is a function that
can, given our present structures,
only be performed by the
universities. Ironically, it is an
individual deeply involved in the
"industrialization function" (as he
terms it) who is proposing such a
re-allocation.
Perhaps the best course of
action at present is a
"moratorium" on further land
development until plans such as
Truber's can be fully studied.

some of the more conservative
interests in the community.
A recently introduced plan
would attempt to resolve some of
these issues by capitalizing on
their commonalities to create an
educational-residential
environment in the open lands
west of the present campus.
The idea was originally
conceived by Jack Truher, an
engineering physicist at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC). It would entail
the construction of a number of
small residential colleges, to be
associated with the main campus
through sharing of major lectures
and scientific laboratories.
First Priority
The notion of a cluster college
system is not without precedent.
De Anza, Foothill, and Claremont
Colleges have been organized in
similar manners. In fact, our own
University-sponsored Study of
Education at Stanford
recommended that "it (the
University) give first priority to
the creation of. . .campus towns,
which will be the residential
focuses for communities of up to
1,500 epople each." (emphasis
mine)

More Students
In addition to providing
necessary new housing, the
proposal would greatly expand
the undergraduate capacity of the
University, something the
administration hasn't seen fit to
do in spite of steep rises in the
demand for undergraduate
education.
The University has yet to take
any action to consider or discuss
Truber's proposal (unusual in view
of the high degree of pressure for
solutions to the housing problem,
perhaps not so in view of the
financially attractive proposals for
industrial use of the land under
discussion).
Unnamed Source
Indeed, their sole
"contribution" to date was to
send an "unnamed source" to do
battle with Truber in the Palo
Alto Tim es
An article on Truber's plan,
which appeared in the October
10th issue, included a statement
by the above-described "person"
that accused the proposal of being
"pie-in-the-sky," and compared it
to a 1946 proposal to blanket
Stanford acreage with tract
houses.
According to Truber, "I was
assured by the news service that
the individual in quesiton had not
even seen the proposal." That
became ovbious upon reading the
text of the proposal, since
Truber's plan would not
"blanket" anything, would not
involve tract houses, and has as its
major goal the improvement of
education, rather than housing per
se.
Financing
Obviously, a choice will have to
be made by the University as to
the uses that are to be made of
available monetary and terrain

resources. With this statement, the
endless industry-education debate
is called to mind, with its many
justifications for spending large
amounts on both aspects of the
university (pardon the
simplification).
However, Truber's plan carries
with it some unique monetary
justifications that might weigh
heavily in the cerebrums of
University officials. The first is
contained in the fact that separate
colleges would exist, with separate
money-raising capacities.
Louis Benezet, formerly
president of the Claremont college
group, demonstrated that a fund
drive in the name of the individual
college will flourish when a united
drive by the parent organization
will fail. Truber's proposal would
allow the creation of innovative
environmental entities, an idea
that evidently carries more appeal
to many potential doners than
does a request for simply an
addition to the present structure.
Low Cost Housing
Another important portion of
the plan is its capacity for
construction of housing which
could, although not necessarily
would, be utilized for low-cost
housing for the community. This
unique combination of "social
action" with expanded education
and opportunity for innovative
experimentation would provide
foundations and federal officials
with a more attriactive approach
than simply requests for "more
money" for fewer people.
The cluster-college plan would
demand a greater share of the
university's resources to be
allocated for liberal education
than has been the case preciously.
The increasing technologization of
society (coming in part from the
universities), and the inability of
an increasing number of citizens
to relate effectively to that
technology have been seen by
many, e.g. economist Robert
Theobold, to demand a
re-emphasis on the development
of the "classically-educated"
citizen. This, unlike the pursuit of
pure research, is a function that
can, given our present structures,
only be performed by the
universities. Ironically, it is an
individual deeply involved in the
"industrialization function" (as he
terms it) who is proposing such a
re-allocation.
Perhaps the best course of
action at present is a
"moratorium" on further land
development until plans such as
Truber's can be fully studied.

in Donner).

The problems of student
housing, proper use of
undeveloped land on Stanford
property, and restricted
admissions have been aired
frequently this year, figuring
heavily in the recent Student
Senate campaigns, in the activities
of campus political organizations,
and in the formation of many
on-and-off-campus groups.
Until now, these issues have
been approached largely as
separate entities, perhaps
accounting partially for the
seeming dominance in
decision-making in these areas by
some of the more conservative
interests in the community.
