# An Anarchist View
## Kill Off Government 
### Paul Roasberry 
(Editor's Note: This column
was submitted to THE DAILY by
the Stanford Radical Libertarian
Alliance. It first appeared in the
October 23 issue of the
COLORADO DAILY.)
In his denunciation of the
October 15 Moratorium, Senator
Dominick assured us that he
"doesn't know anybody in the
country who's for war." What a
naive thing to say—or perhaps it's
just another lie. I know on a
personal level dozens of
war-lovers. I'm one of them I'm
for war against fat-cat politicians
and other bureaucratic scum who
pose as guardians of "freedom"
and "justice" while conducting
criminal enterprises against the
people under guise of "defending
the common welfare."
The practice of attacking and
overthrowing governments and
the mobsters who comprise them
is not an exceptionally new one.
Recall the Boston Tea Party—a
few nasty radicals forcibly
disrupting the status quo. And
they didn't even "go through
accepted channels!" The theory
of anarchism proposes that all
government can be resolved into
one dominant element: crime.
Government means in its simplest
form institutionalized slavery and
legalized theft. Through
conscription, taxation, and other
coercive means the State sustains
itself. Note that I said ains
itself."

While arguing with another
student about the SDS actions in
Chicago, I was told that "the
police have to defend
themselves." Right on! Because
they never defend anyone else.
And the same can be said of Big
Brother and his gang of pigs in
Washington or San Clemente or
wherever they happen to be
hiding out today.
Foolish Claims
Oh, I realize that all you
clean-cut spit-shined god-fearing
young American "patriots" must
be fuming at the brashness of such
heresy. But despite what you so
foolishly claim—that the pigs and
the government and the military
exist to "protect the
people"—there has never been a
political order in history which
has come close to fulfilling this
promise.
Last fall, I was mugged by six
thugs in broad daylight while
distributing political leaflets. As
the blood flowed out of my
mangled right eye I managed to
catch the license number of the
getaway car. What a waste of
time! The pigs did absolutely
nothing. And the point isn't that
they should have protected
me—for that it would be necessary
to post uniformed goons at six
foot intervals throughout the
country. The thing which really
peeved me was the fact that even
after I had identified the six
creeps who had jumped me, a

"magistrate" in Tucson declared
that there was "insufficient
evidence" for prosecution. My
tough luck. And nothing shows
that it wouldn't probably be your
tough luck as well under similar
circumstances.
Guns Good Protection
I now realize that I should have
been carrying a gun. Guns are
good protection, cost less than
maintaining police forces, and one
doesn't need a badge to fire one.
Anyway, while I was lying in a
hospital bed with a permanently
damaged eye, the pigs were out
nabbing potheads and peddlers of
"girlie magazines." Here you must
realize that police nearly always
concern themselves with the
activities of persons who aire not
really committing any sort of
crime whatsoever. "Crimes"
which have no victims are not
crimes at all. So it is that in most
places carrying a gun, committing
suicide, evading payment of taxes,
and blowing up induction centers
are all "illegal." Meanwhile, the
real crimes (murder, assault, theft,
etc.) are left virtually unchecked
because the pigs are too busy
chasing down pornographic
movies to worry about who's
getting his head bashed in on a
street corner.
Gestapo Patrols
Just examine the facts—we have
an elaborate "judicial" system and
one of the worst crime rates in the
world. American gestapo patrols

can't halt the murders. It's
obvious that governments do not
deter coercive violence (witness
the war—any war), much less stop
such violence altogether. With this
in mind, of what possible value is
a government?
Some idiot will argue that a
"good" police system is possible;
that we could establish a "truly
democratic government." Absurd.
Or it will be said: "If it weren't
for the police we'd have anarchy."
That happens to be an astute
observation. Every State is by
nature a leech which sucks its
life-blood from the people. It is
necessary that any government
oppress the very people
government is designed to
"protect." But if I possess
anything worth defending, I'll
protect it myself. I'll have
to— one lesson I learned the hard
way. The State can't protect my
property by robbing me. Neither
can it salvage my freedom by
drafting (enslaving) me.
Government is Criminal
So far I've been leading up to
the really crucial point. It is not
that governments simply fail to
prevent real crimes—it is that the
very nature of government itself is
criminal. Suppose that I threaten
to lock a man up or to beat him if
he refused to forfeit 10% of
everything he owns. That's called
extortion. But when the
government does it it's called
taxation. And even that's not the
worst of it—tax revenue is used to
put seismographs on the moon, to
pay General Hershey, to build
bombs and missiles, and to keep
Richard Nixon's friends wined,
dined and supplied with circuses.
The victims of IRS have no
choice. Unless they pay up, they
are deprived of their livelihood or
heaved into jail. In a "free"
country! The same account can be
given of conscription. Because
you breath you are "responsible"
to the flag and to the fatherland.
Anyone refusing to sacrifice
himself to the Leviathan State by
submitting to involuntary
servitude is fined or imprisoned
(please read the 13th Amendment
plus Noah Webster on
"involuntary servitude").
"I Don't Like It."
Quite frankly, I don't like it.
Others have expressed a similar
distaste for "authority." Give me
liberty or give me death. Sic
semper tyrannis. Extremism in the
defense of liberty is no vice. All
power to the people. Smash the
State. Smash ROTC.
The philosophy of government
seems to be summed up in a
statement made by Adolf Hitler:
"The activities of the individual
must not clash with the interests
of the whole, but must proceed
within the framework of the
community and must be for the
general good." Undoubtedly,
most of the refutations of this
column would have to consist in
one way or another of an approval
of what Hitler had to say. It is
precisely this idea that men must
be subordinate to the "whole"
which underlies all government.
Pig Politicians
The comparison is not at all
ridiculous—like Hitler, American
pig politicians have already
created concentration camps. At
least twelve of them are presently
maintained under the provisions
of the Internal Security Act of
1950—a1l of which can be filled
within twenty-four hours by a
simple executive decree, without
due process. That's what
government has already achieved
under your noses.
Clearly, anything a government
can do is not worth doing in the
first place. The "choice" offered
by modern political figures is no
choice at all—instead of attacking
anyone particular government, it
is more worthwhile to attack
government per sc. Conservatives
desire the suppression of leftist
totalitarianism; liberals seek the
abolition of rightist
totalitarianism; anarchists oppose
all politics as such and place
blame for tyranny upon the only
party which could possibly bear
responsibility: The State. All
States.

country who's for war." What a
naive thing to say—or perhaps it's
just another lie. I know on a
personal level dozens of
war-lovers. I'm one of them I'm
for war against fat-cat politicians
and other bureaucratic scum who
pose as guardians of "freedom"
and "justice" while conducting
criminal enterprises against the
people under guise of "defending
the common welfare."
The practice of attacking and
overthrowing governments and
the mobsters who comprise them
is not an exceptionally new one.
Recall the Boston Tea Party—a
few nasty radicals forcibly
disrupting the status quo. And
they didn't even "go through
accepted channels!" The theory
of anarchism proposes that all
government can be resolved into
one dominant element: crime.
Government means in its simplest
form institutionalized slavery and
legalized theft. Through
conscription, taxation, and other
coercive means the State sustains
itself. Note that I said ains
itself."

While arguing with another
student about the SDS actions in
Chicago, I was told that "the
police have to defend
themselves." Right on! Because
they never defend anyone else.
And the same can be said of Big
Brother and his gang of pigs in
Washington or San Clemente or
wherever they happen to be
hiding out today.
Foolish Claims
Oh, I realize that all you
clean-cut spit-shined god-fearing
young American "patriots" must
be fuming at the brashness of such
heresy. But despite what you so
foolishly claim—that the pigs and
the government and the military
exist to "protect the
people"—there has never been a
political order in history which
has come close to fulfilling this
promise.
Last fall, I was mugged by six
thugs in broad daylight while
distributing political leaflets. As
the blood flowed out of my
mangled right eye I managed to
catch the license number of the
getaway car. What a waste of
time! The pigs did absolutely
nothing. And the point isn't that
they should have protected
me—for that it would be necessary
to post uniformed goons at six
foot intervals throughout the
country. The thing which really
peeved me was the fact that even
after I had identified the six
creeps who had jumped me, a

"magistrate" in Tucson declared
that there was "insufficient
evidence" for prosecution. My
tough luck. And nothing shows
that it wouldn't probably be your
tough luck as well under similar
circumstances.
Guns Good Protection
I now realize that I should have
been carrying a gun. Guns are
good protection, cost less than
maintaining police forces, and one
doesn't need a badge to fire one.
Anyway, while I was lying in a
hospital bed with a permanently
damaged eye, the pigs were out
nabbing potheads and peddlers of
"girlie magazines." Here you must
realize that police nearly always
concern themselves with the
activities of persons who aire not
really committing any sort of
crime whatsoever. "Crimes"
which have no victims are not
crimes at all. So it is that in most
places carrying a gun, committing
suicide, evading payment of taxes,
and blowing up induction centers
are all "illegal." Meanwhile, the
real crimes (murder, assault, theft,
etc.) are left virtually unchecked
because the pigs are too busy
chasing down pornographic
movies to worry about who's
getting his head bashed in on a
street corner.
Gestapo Patrols
Just examine the facts—we have
an elaborate "judicial" system and
one of the worst crime rates in the
world. American gestapo patrols

can't halt the murders. It's
obvious that governments do not
deter coercive violence (witness
the war—any war), much less stop
such violence altogether. With this
in mind, of what possible value is
a government?
Some idiot will argue that a
"good" police system is possible;
that we could establish a "truly
democratic government." Absurd.
Or it will be said: "If it weren't
for the police we'd have anarchy."
That happens to be an astute
observation. Every State is by
nature a leech which sucks its
life-blood from the people. It is
necessary that any government
oppress the very people
government is designed to
"protect." But if I possess
anything worth defending, I'll
protect it myself. I'll have
to— one lesson I learned the hard
way. The State can't protect my
property by robbing me. Neither
can it salvage my freedom by
drafting (enslaving) me.
Government is Criminal
So far I've been leading up to
the really crucial point. It is not
that governments simply fail to
prevent real crimes—it is that the
very nature of government itself is
criminal. Suppose that I threaten
to lock a man up or to beat him if
he refused to forfeit 10% of
everything he owns. That's called
extortion. But when the
government does it it's called
taxation. And even that's not the
worst of it—tax revenue is used to
put seismographs on the moon, to
pay General Hershey, to build
bombs and missiles, and to keep
Richard Nixon's friends wined,
dined and supplied with circuses.
The victims of IRS have no
choice. Unless they pay up, they
are deprived of their livelihood or
heaved into jail. In a "free"
country! The same account can be
given of conscription. Because
you breath you are "responsible"
to the flag and to the fatherland.
Anyone refusing to sacrifice
himself to the Leviathan State by
submitting to involuntary
servitude is fined or imprisoned
(please read the 13th Amendment
plus Noah Webster on
"involuntary servitude").
"I Don't Like It."
Quite frankly, I don't like it.
Others have expressed a similar
distaste for "authority." Give me
liberty or give me death. Sic
semper tyrannis. Extremism in the
defense of liberty is no vice. All
power to the people. Smash the
State. Smash ROTC.
The philosophy of government
seems to be summed up in a
statement made by Adolf Hitler:
"The activities of the individual
must not clash with the interests
of the whole, but must proceed
within the framework of the
community and must be for the
general good." Undoubtedly,
most of the refutations of this
column would have to consist in
one way or another of an approval
of what Hitler had to say. It is
precisely this idea that men must
be subordinate to the "whole"
which underlies all government.
Pig Politicians
The comparison is not at all
ridiculous—like Hitler, American
pig politicians have already
created concentration camps. At
least twelve of them are presently
maintained under the provisions
of the Internal Security Act of
1950—a1l of which can be filled
within twenty-four hours by a
simple executive decree, without
due process. That's what
government has already achieved
under your noses.
Clearly, anything a government
can do is not worth doing in the
first place. The "choice" offered
by modern political figures is no
choice at all—instead of attacking
anyone particular government, it
is more worthwhile to attack
government per sc. Conservatives
desire the suppression of leftist
totalitarianism; liberals seek the
abolition of rightist
totalitarianism; anarchists oppose
all politics as such and place
blame for tyranny upon the only
party which could possibly bear
responsibility: The State. All
States.

people under guise of "defending
the common welfare."
The practice of attacking and
overthrowing governments and
the mobsters who comprise them
is not an exceptionally new one.
Recall the Boston Tea Party—a
few nasty radicals forcibly
disrupting the status quo. And
they didn't even "go through
accepted channels!" The theory
of anarchism proposes that all
government can be resolved into
one dominant element: crime.
Government means in its simplest
form institutionalized slavery and
legalized theft. Through
conscription, taxation, and other
coercive means the State sustains
itself. Note that I said ains
itself."

While arguing with another
student about the SDS actions in
Chicago, I was told that "the
police have to defend
themselves." Right on! Because
they never defend anyone else.
And the same can be said of Big
Brother and his gang of pigs in
Washington or San Clemente or
wherever they happen to be
hiding out today.
Foolish Claims
Oh, I realize that all you
clean-cut spit-shined god-fearing
young American "patriots" must
be fuming at the brashness of such
heresy. But despite what you so
foolishly claim—that the pigs and
the government and the military
exist to "protect the
people"—there has never been a
political order in history which
has come close to fulfilling this
promise.
Last fall, I was mugged by six
thugs in broad daylight while
distributing political leaflets. As
the blood flowed out of my
mangled right eye I managed to
catch the license number of the
getaway car. What a waste of
time! The pigs did absolutely
nothing. And the point isn't that
they should have protected
me—for that it would be necessary
to post uniformed goons at six
foot intervals throughout the
country. The thing which really
peeved me was the fact that even
after I had identified the six
creeps who had jumped me, a

"magistrate" in Tucson declared
that there was "insufficient
evidence" for prosecution. My
tough luck. And nothing shows
that it wouldn't probably be your
tough luck as well under similar
circumstances.
Guns Good Protection
I now realize that I should have
been carrying a gun. Guns are
good protection, cost less than
maintaining police forces, and one
doesn't need a badge to fire one.
Anyway, while I was lying in a
hospital bed with a permanently
damaged eye, the pigs were out
nabbing potheads and peddlers of
"girlie magazines." Here you must
realize that police nearly always
concern themselves with the
activities of persons who aire not
really committing any sort of
crime whatsoever. "Crimes"
which have no victims are not
crimes at all. So it is that in most
places carrying a gun, committing
suicide, evading payment of taxes,
and blowing up induction centers
are all "illegal." Meanwhile, the
real crimes (murder, assault, theft,
etc.) are left virtually unchecked
because the pigs are too busy
chasing down pornographic
movies to worry about who's
getting his head bashed in on a
street corner.
Gestapo Patrols
Just examine the facts—we have
an elaborate "judicial" system and
one of the worst crime rates in the
world. American gestapo patrols

can't halt the murders. It's
obvious that governments do not
deter coercive violence (witness
the war—any war), much less stop
such violence altogether. With this
in mind, of what possible value is
a government?
Some idiot will argue that a
"good" police system is possible;
that we could establish a "truly
democratic government." Absurd.
Or it will be said: "If it weren't
for the police we'd have anarchy."
That happens to be an astute
observation. Every State is by
nature a leech which sucks its
life-blood from the people. It is
necessary that any government
oppress the very people
government is designed to
"protect." But if I possess
anything worth defending, I'll
protect it myself. I'll have
to— one lesson I learned the hard
way. The State can't protect my
property by robbing me. Neither
can it salvage my freedom by
drafting (enslaving) me.
Government is Criminal
So far I've been leading up to
the really crucial point. It is not
that governments simply fail to
prevent real crimes—it is that the
very nature of government itself is
criminal. Suppose that I threaten
to lock a man up or to beat him if
he refused to forfeit 10% of
everything he owns. That's called
extortion. But when the
government does it it's called
taxation. And even that's not the
worst of it—tax revenue is used to
put seismographs on the moon, to
pay General Hershey, to build
bombs and missiles, and to keep
Richard Nixon's friends wined,
dined and supplied with circuses.
The victims of IRS have no
choice. Unless they pay up, they
are deprived of their livelihood or
heaved into jail. In a "free"
country! The same account can be
given of conscription. Because
you breath you are "responsible"
to the flag and to the fatherland.
Anyone refusing to sacrifice
himself to the Leviathan State by
submitting to involuntary
servitude is fined or imprisoned
(please read the 13th Amendment
plus Noah Webster on
"involuntary servitude").
"I Don't Like It."
Quite frankly, I don't like it.
Others have expressed a similar
distaste for "authority." Give me
liberty or give me death. Sic
semper tyrannis. Extremism in the
defense of liberty is no vice. All
power to the people. Smash the
State. Smash ROTC.
The philosophy of government
seems to be summed up in a
statement made by Adolf Hitler:
"The activities of the individual
must not clash with the interests
of the whole, but must proceed
within the framework of the
community and must be for the
general good." Undoubtedly,
most of the refutations of this
column would have to consist in
one way or another of an approval
of what Hitler had to say. It is
precisely this idea that men must
be subordinate to the "whole"
which underlies all government.
Pig Politicians
The comparison is not at all
ridiculous—like Hitler, American
pig politicians have already
created concentration camps. At
least twelve of them are presently
maintained under the provisions
of the Internal Security Act of
1950—a1l of which can be filled
within twenty-four hours by a
simple executive decree, without
due process. That's what
government has already achieved
under your noses.
Clearly, anything a government
can do is not worth doing in the
first place. The "choice" offered
by modern political figures is no
choice at all—instead of attacking
anyone particular government, it
is more worthwhile to attack
government per sc. Conservatives
desire the suppression of leftist
totalitarianism; liberals seek the
abolition of rightist
totalitarianism; anarchists oppose
all politics as such and place
blame for tyranny upon the only
party which could possibly bear
responsibility: The State. All
States.

one dominant element: crime.
Government means in its simplest
form institutionalized slavery and
legalized theft. Through
conscription, taxation, and other
coercive means the State sustains
itself. Note that I said ains
itself."

While arguing with another
student about the SDS actions in
Chicago, I was told that "the
police have to defend
themselves." Right on! Because
they never defend anyone else.
And the same can be said of Big
Brother and his gang of pigs in
Washington or San Clemente or
wherever they happen to be
hiding out today.
Foolish Claims
Oh, I realize that all you
clean-cut spit-shined god-fearing
young American "patriots" must
be fuming at the brashness of such
heresy. But despite what you so
foolishly claim—that the pigs and
the government and the military
exist to "protect the
people"—there has never been a
political order in history which
has come close to fulfilling this
promise.
Last fall, I was mugged by six
thugs in broad daylight while
distributing political leaflets. As
the blood flowed out of my
mangled right eye I managed to
catch the license number of the
getaway car. What a waste of
time! The pigs did absolutely
nothing. And the point isn't that
they should have protected
me—for that it would be necessary
to post uniformed goons at six
foot intervals throughout the
country. The thing which really
peeved me was the fact that even
after I had identified the six
creeps who had jumped me, a

"magistrate" in Tucson declared
that there was "insufficient
evidence" for prosecution. My
tough luck. And nothing shows
that it wouldn't probably be your
tough luck as well under similar
circumstances.
Guns Good Protection
I now realize that I should have
been carrying a gun. Guns are
good protection, cost less than
maintaining police forces, and one
doesn't need a badge to fire one.
Anyway, while I was lying in a
hospital bed with a permanently
damaged eye, the pigs were out
nabbing potheads and peddlers of
"girlie magazines." Here you must
realize that police nearly always
concern themselves with the
activities of persons who aire not
really committing any sort of
crime whatsoever. "Crimes"
which have no victims are not
crimes at all. So it is that in most
places carrying a gun, committing
suicide, evading payment of taxes,
and blowing up induction centers
are all "illegal." Meanwhile, the
real crimes (murder, assault, theft,
etc.) are left virtually unchecked
because the pigs are too busy
chasing down pornographic
movies to worry about who's
getting his head bashed in on a
street corner.
Gestapo Patrols
Just examine the facts—we have
an elaborate "judicial" system and
one of the worst crime rates in the
world. American gestapo patrols

can't halt the murders. It's
obvious that governments do not
deter coercive violence (witness
the war—any war), much less stop
such violence altogether. With this
in mind, of what possible value is
a government?
Some idiot will argue that a
"good" police system is possible;
that we could establish a "truly
democratic government." Absurd.
Or it will be said: "If it weren't
for the police we'd have anarchy."
That happens to be an astute
observation. Every State is by
nature a leech which sucks its
life-blood from the people. It is
necessary that any government
oppress the very people
government is designed to
"protect." But if I possess
anything worth defending, I'll
protect it myself. I'll have
to— one lesson I learned the hard
way. The State can't protect my
property by robbing me. Neither
can it salvage my freedom by
drafting (enslaving) me.
Government is Criminal
So far I've been leading up to
the really crucial point. It is not
that governments simply fail to
prevent real crimes—it is that the
very nature of government itself is
criminal. Suppose that I threaten
to lock a man up or to beat him if
he refused to forfeit 10% of
everything he owns. That's called
extortion. But when the
government does it it's called
taxation. And even that's not the
worst of it—tax revenue is used to
put seismographs on the moon, to
pay General Hershey, to build
bombs and missiles, and to keep
Richard Nixon's friends wined,
dined and supplied with circuses.
The victims of IRS have no
choice. Unless they pay up, they
are deprived of their livelihood or
heaved into jail. In a "free"
country! The same account can be
given of conscription. Because
you breath you are "responsible"
to the flag and to the fatherland.
Anyone refusing to sacrifice
himself to the Leviathan State by
submitting to involuntary
servitude is fined or imprisoned
(please read the 13th Amendment
plus Noah Webster on
"involuntary servitude").
"I Don't Like It."
Quite frankly, I don't like it.
Others have expressed a similar
distaste for "authority." Give me
liberty or give me death. Sic
semper tyrannis. Extremism in the
defense of liberty is no vice. All
power to the people. Smash the
State. Smash ROTC.
The philosophy of government
seems to be summed up in a
statement made by Adolf Hitler:
"The activities of the individual
must not clash with the interests
of the whole, but must proceed
within the framework of the
community and must be for the
general good." Undoubtedly,
most of the refutations of this
column would have to consist in
one way or another of an approval
of what Hitler had to say. It is
precisely this idea that men must
be subordinate to the "whole"
which underlies all government.
Pig Politicians
The comparison is not at all
ridiculous—like Hitler, American
pig politicians have already
created concentration camps. At
least twelve of them are presently
maintained under the provisions
of the Internal Security Act of
1950—a1l of which can be filled
within twenty-four hours by a
simple executive decree, without
due process. That's what
government has already achieved
under your noses.
Clearly, anything a government
can do is not worth doing in the
first place. The "choice" offered
by modern political figures is no
choice at all—instead of attacking
anyone particular government, it
is more worthwhile to attack
government per sc. Conservatives
desire the suppression of leftist
totalitarianism; liberals seek the
abolition of rightist
totalitarianism; anarchists oppose
all politics as such and place
blame for tyranny upon the only
party which could possibly bear
responsibility: The State. All
States.
