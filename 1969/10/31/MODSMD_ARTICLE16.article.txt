Mastic Crisis
Today's section on plastic,
featuring a column entitled
"Plastic Crisis" by Make Zadig,
will be the last THE DAILY edit
page will publish. So keep your
plastic remarks to yourself.
Once upon a time there was a
wonderful school known as
Standard University full of happy
serious minded students. They
were all happy because the
wonderful Standard University
was helping them to be rich by
giving them all the tools to
manipulate the Greater Society.
While they were studying they
manipulated each other (just for
practice), and sometimes they
even let a genuine smile slip
through which made everyone
extremely happy. They all agreed
that Standard U was a very
wonderful place, better than New
Yo k way.
day wicked fairies

against Society and
happiness , *nted the seeds of
discontent. People began to search
for sincerity and no longer did a
little smile make everyone happy.
Great unrest followed as Standard
U began to shake to its very
foundations; even the Graduates
looked up from their cells in
dismay.
But Standard did not have to
worry long for one Hermann
Closure had found a solution that
saved the day.
We discussed Mr. Closure's
solution in an exclusive interview:
We: Tell us Mr. Closeure, what
exactly is your solution?
Malcontent
Closure: (humbly) Well, first of
all I must say that it was not
exactly my idea. The idea was
given to me by a letter to the
editor in Standard U's Standard
Daily. A malcontent was
lamenting the coldness of the
Standard women comparing their
coldness to a plastic shield.
We: Shield? Is that one of those
shields.
Closure: (Proudly tapping the
plastic bubble surrounding him)
Yes, in a way. You see, this is my
solution to the problems of
Standard and the Greater
Societies. I intend to supply every
man, woman, and child with their

own self contained plastic bubble.
Think of the savings on soap and
deoderant, and clothes, if one
should choose the opaque model.
We: Don't you think the inside
would get rather. . .
Closure: I see your point, but
each unit has its own air
conditioning system.
Prctaped Messages
You see that large bubble over
in the corner. That's for the
president ">f Standard University.
An introductory sample. It has a
public address system with
pretaped messages, all very
cheery, and a reclining seat. When
the day gets too hectic he can just
switch off the world.
We: Well, Mr. Closure, doesn't
the bubble make communication
a bit difficult.
Closure: (smiling paternally)
My dear sirs, that is the entire
point. If it wasn't for

communication this University
wouldn't be in such a sad state.
With these bubbles no one has to
communicate at all. Each bubble
is equipped with tape recorded
greetings of the most sincere
quality so that you and your
bubble are in the most sincere and
happy of moods, and so is
everyone else. No one will ever
have to worry about sincerity
again.
We: Suppose, by some chance,
some bubble, .ah. . .decided it
liked another bubble?
Closure: (grinning) For that I
have just the thing. You see, I've
equipped each bubble with little
hand holes (he shoved his hand
through an aperture). So the
bubbles can hold, ha, ha, hands,
so to speak.
We: Ingenious!
Closure: Here I'll give you a
demonstration. Say good

morning. (He snapped his opaque
bubble shut.)
We: Ah. . .Good morning.
Bubble: Gooood morning and
how are you. . . .today?
We: Quite well, thank you.
Now. Mr
Bubble: That is wonderful. It's
such a nice cheery day, don't you
think? I think so, I just love. . .
We: Well, we'll be running
along noww. . ..sir? Mr. Closure?
Sir?
Bubble: That's nice, I do have
to be popping off too; I think I'll
just take a little. . .
We left the Closure sales office
and made our way through the
bubble filled corridors of
Standard U to our next
assignment.
Moral: Take a bubble t<-» lunch;
they might enjoy it.

saved the day.
We discussed Mr. Closure's
solution in an exclusive interview:
We: Tell us Mr. Closeure, what
exactly is your solution?
Malcontent
Closure: (humbly) Well, first of
all I must say that it was not
exactly my idea. The idea was
given to me by a letter to the
editor in Standard U's Standard
Daily. A malcontent was
lamenting the coldness of the
Standard women comparing their
coldness to a plastic shield.
We: Shield? Is that one of those
shields.
Closure: (Proudly tapping the
plastic bubble surrounding him)
Yes, in a way. You see, this is my
solution to the problems of
Standard and the Greater
Societies. I intend to supply every
man, woman, and child with their

own self contained plastic bubble.
Think of the savings on soap and
deoderant, and clothes, if one
should choose the opaque model.
We: Don't you think the inside
would get rather. . .
Closure: I see your point, but
each unit has its own air
conditioning system.
Prctaped Messages
You see that large bubble over
in the corner. That's for the
president ">f Standard University.
An introductory sample. It has a
public address system with
pretaped messages, all very
cheery, and a reclining seat. When
the day gets too hectic he can just
switch off the world.
We: Well, Mr. Closure, doesn't
the bubble make communication
a bit difficult.
Closure: (smiling paternally)
My dear sirs, that is the entire
point. If it wasn't for

communication this University
wouldn't be in such a sad state.
With these bubbles no one has to
communicate at all. Each bubble
is equipped with tape recorded
greetings of the most sincere
quality so that you and your
bubble are in the most sincere and
happy of moods, and so is
everyone else. No one will ever
have to worry about sincerity
again.
We: Suppose, by some chance,
some bubble, .ah. . .decided it
liked another bubble?
Closure: (grinning) For that I
have just the thing. You see, I've
equipped each bubble with little
hand holes (he shoved his hand
through an aperture). So the
bubbles can hold, ha, ha, hands,
so to speak.
We: Ingenious!
Closure: Here I'll give you a
demonstration. Say good

morning. (He snapped his opaque
bubble shut.)
We: Ah. . .Good morning.
Bubble: Gooood morning and
how are you. . . .today?
We: Quite well, thank you.
Now. Mr
Bubble: That is wonderful. It's
such a nice cheery day, don't you
think? I think so, I just love. . .
We: Well, we'll be running

Sir?

exactly is your solution?
Malcontent
Closure: (humbly) Well, first of
all I must say that it was not
exactly my idea. The idea was
given to me by a letter to the
editor in Standard U's Standard
Daily. A malcontent was
lamenting the coldness of the
Standard women comparing their
coldness to a plastic shield.
We: Shield? Is that one of those
shields.
Closure: (Proudly tapping the
plastic bubble surrounding him)
Yes, in a way. You see, this is my
solution to the problems of
Standard and the Greater
Societies. I intend to supply every
man, woman, and child with their

own self contained plastic bubble.
Think of the savings on soap and
deoderant, and clothes, if one
should choose the opaque model.
We: Don't you think the inside
would get rather. . .
Closure: I see your point, but
each unit has its own air
conditioning system.
Prctaped Messages
You see that large bubble over
in the corner. That's for the
president ">f Standard University.
An introductory sample. It has a
public address system with
pretaped messages, all very
cheery, and a reclining seat. When
the day gets too hectic he can just
switch off the world.
We: Well, Mr. Closure, doesn't
the bubble make communication
a bit difficult.
Closure: (smiling paternally)
My dear sirs, that is the entire
point. If it wasn't for

communication this University
wouldn't be in such a sad state.
With these bubbles no one has to
communicate at all. Each bubble
is equipped with tape recorded
greetings of the most sincere
quality so that you and your
bubble are in the most sincere and
happy of moods, and so is
everyone else. No one will ever
have to worry about sincerity
again.
We: Suppose, by some chance,
some bubble, .ah. . .decided it
liked another bubble?
Closure: (grinning) For that I
have just the thing. You see, I've
equipped each bubble with little
hand holes (he shoved his hand
through an aperture). So the
bubbles can hold, ha, ha, hands,
so to speak.
We: Ingenious!
Closure: Here I'll give you a
demonstration. Say good

morning. (He snapped his opaque
bubble shut.)
We: Ah. . .Good morning.
Bubble: Gooood morning and
how are you. . . .today?
We: Quite well, thank you.
Now. Mr
Bubble: That is wonderful. It's
such a nice cheery day, don't you
think? I think so, I just love. . .
We: Well, we'll be running
along noww. . ..sir? Mr. Closure?
Sir?
Bubble: That's nice, I do have
to be popping off too; I think I'll
just take a little. . .
We left the Closure sales office
and made our way through the
bubble filled corridors of
Standard U to our next
assignment.
Moral: Take a bubble t<-» lunch;
they might enjoy it.
