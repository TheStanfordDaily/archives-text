## Say "Yes" To Anything

Question: Are Stanford Dollys
plastic?
Faculty Response: "I don't know.
My wife won't let me touch
them."
Dear Mom,
The girl next to me in Prof.
Seaver's class has a string with a
ring at the end coming out below
her ear. What does this mean?

Dear Astounded,
Do not be alarmed. She is
obviously a talking doll of the
"Cuddly Mildred" series and was
made in Los Angeles or environs.
Our registrar got a very good price
on a batch of Cuddly Mildreds in
1969. They are programmed for a
B.A. in History in 1972 and have
real hair. Unfortunately, the LA.
firm has stooped producine
Cuddly Mildreds due to a flaw in
the voice mechanismâ€”some
Cuddly Mildreds will say "yes" to
anything. Why don't you pull her

string and see . . .
Playfully yours,
Mom
