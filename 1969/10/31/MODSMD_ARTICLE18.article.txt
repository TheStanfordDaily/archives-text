### CISSI BONINI 
My Diet-Rite has cyclamatcâ€”
My grade point's something
drastic.
My Winston fag is full of tar
And now my girlfriend's plastic!
/ knew she wore a vinyl wig
And a coat of naughyde.

But never once did I suspect
Her heart was plasticide!
The thought that all those sighs
were false
My shattered ego rends . . .
Could perchance the fault by in
my eye
Through my plastic contact lens?
