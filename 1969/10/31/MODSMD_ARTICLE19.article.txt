# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Old Pieces Superb In New Recordings 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
The Capitol Recording Company,
which among other things,
distributes Capitol, Angel,
Seraphim and Apple labels, has
been doing its best to appeal to all
segments of the music market; its
recent releases have done just
that. I'd like to mention a few of
the better Rock LP's in passing,
and then- discuss one of the best
releases I've heard in a good long
time.

There are three factions in the
rock scene today. They bicker
over what the proper way to play
rock really is. The conservatives,
represented on Capitol by the
Grand Funk Railroad and the
Sons (formerly the Sons 'a'
Champlain), play rock on rock
instruments, electric guitar and
bass, organ, drums, occasionally a
sax or horn.
The Liberals feel that rock
should continue to progress in the

same direction as it has been, and
support the use of more advanced
electronic gear. Capital has a
couple of records out by Douglas
Leedy playing Moog and Buchla
Synthesizers and his own
invention, the Ognob generator.
The Radical elements are
supporting the use of way-out
instrumental combinations, and
have met with much opposition
from the establishment.
Douglas Leedy's album is not
really rock; it is continuous,
strange electronic music that
defies further description. The
album is called Electric Zodiac,
although there is no attempt to
represent the Twelve Signs in
sound. Rather, it is an attempt to
capture the "music of the
spheres," and if you just relax and
let the music envelope you, it can
be both frightening and exciting.
The Jacket notes do not tell
you what to think or do. It's up
to you. Leedy's compositions
have more feeling than most
electronic productions; although I
don't usually think much of such
stuff, this particular album is
intriguing. Be sure to listen to it
with headphones.
The best set now being
distributed by Capitol is on the
Seraphim label, the low-cost
cousin to the marvelous
recordings on Angel. Under the
general category "Great
Recordings of the Century," they
have assembled some of the
outstanding muscial performances
since recording instruments were
developed.
Having reposed for years on
ancient tape and fragile discs,
Seraphim engineers have managed
to transfer priceless performances
by Rudolf Serkin, Arthur
Schnabel, Pablo Casals, Alfred

Cortot, Adolf Busch, Nadia
Boulanger, and many others to
modern LP's, while removing
most of the static, scratches, and
record noise. On these discs are
the musical treasures of this era.
Do not expect the sound of
these performances to match that
of your contemporary recordings
of the same pieces. Most of these
tapes were done before World War
11, in a time very different from
the present. These recordings,
speak of a musical style less
hurried than that of today, more
intent on the text, more faithful
to the composer's style.
There is mellowness and full
orchestration here where today's
performances too often go in for
brashness, and showy style. The
object of the performers in these
albums was to present the
greatness of the music as clearly
and purely as possible.
The six concertos in the first
set are illustrative of the care
taken with these interpretations.
The Beethoven Piano Concerto
No. 2 is played by Artur
Schnabel, and the Philharmonia
Orchestra led by Issay Dobrowen
with the feeling that comes only
with years of living with
Beethoven's music. Relatively
small in scale, the Piano Concerto
No. 2 has never gained the
admiration given to the Fourth,
for it is more like a chamber
work.
Mr. Schnabel leads us and
carries us through the music,
carefully unfolding the genius of
the composer who he understands
best. It is a magnificent
performance, as are most of the
others in this set: Mozart Piano
Concerto No. 24 with Edwin
Fischer and the London
Philharmonic led by Lawrance

Collingwood; Brahms Double
Concerto for violin and cello with
Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals,
and Alfred Cortot directing the
Pablo Casals Orchestra of
Barcelona; Fritz Kreisler playing
the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto
with Sir Landon Ronald and the
London Philharmonic, and
Maurice Ravel conducting
Marguerite Long in his Piano
Concerto in G. All these are
superb and justly famous
performances.
Soloists Not True
I take issue with one piece on
the album, however: Bach's
Brandenberg Concerto No. 5 is
played by Adolf Busch's great
chamber orchestra, but the
soloists are simply not true to the
score. The musicians are the
world's finest, but they play the
wrong instruments. The Concerto
was scored for violin, recorder and
harpsichord, but this recording
presents instead violin, flute and
piano (Adolf Busch, Marcel Moyse
and Rudolf Serkin).
Few chamber groups use the
recorder (substituting flute), but
most are able to find a competent
harpsichord and hear a piano.
However, the other five pieces
make this album most
worthwhile.
Six Chamber Music Masterpieces
is the title of the second of the
three boxes in this set, and that is
no understatement. Pieces
presented are Mozart Piano
Quartet K. 478 with Artur
Schnabel and members of the Pro
Arte Quartet; Fritz Kriesler and
Franz Rupp playing Beethoven
Violin Sonata No. 9 ("Kreutzer");
Thibaud, Casals and Cortot with
the Piano Trio in D Minor by
Mendelssohn; Thibaud, Long,
Pierre Fournier and Maurice

Vieux in Faure's Piano Quartet
No. 2 (probably his best work);
the Debussy Piano Sonata played
by Robert Casadesus and Maurice
Marechal; and finally, -the finest
piece on the album, Brahms'
exciting Horn Trio in E flat,
played by Serkin, Busch, and the
legendary Aubrey Brain, probably
the greatest horn player who ever
lived.
This recording was felt to be so
perfect by Brain's contemporaries
that for years no one else dared to
record it â€”and this performance is
undeniably one of the most
superb recordings of horn music
ever made.
The final three records contain
piano solo pieces by Edwin
Fischer, Walter Giesking, Dame
Myra Hess, Artur Schnabel,
Solomon, and Alfred Cortot. Only
the Fischer, Giesking and Cortot
selections measure up to the
quality of the other two volumes,
partly because of the extremely
high quality of the other pieces,
but also because the selections are
not the best ones recorded by
these soloists.

Six Chamber Music Masterpieces
is the title of the second of the
three boxes in this set, and that is
no understatement. Pieces
presented are Mozart Piano
Quartet K. 478 with Artur
Schnabel and members of the Pro
Arte Quartet; Fritz Kriesler and
Franz Rupp playing Beethoven
Violin Sonata No. 9 ("Kreutzer");
Thibaud, Casals and Cortot with
the Piano Trio in D Minor by
Mendelssohn; Thibaud, Long,
Pierre Fournier and Maurice

Vieux in Faure's Piano Quartet
No. 2 (probably his best work);
the Debussy Piano Sonata played
by Robert Casadesus and Maurice
Marechal; and finally, -the finest
piece on the album, Brahms'
exciting Horn Trio in E flat,
played by Serkin, Busch, and the
legendary Aubrey Brain, probably
the greatest horn player who ever
lived.
This recording was felt to be so
perfect by Brain's contemporaries
that for years no one else dared to
record it â€”and this performance is
undeniably one of the most
superb recordings of horn music
ever made.
The final three records contain
piano solo pieces by Edwin
Fischer, Walter Giesking, Dame
Myra Hess, Artur Schnabel,
Solomon, and Alfred Cortot. Only
the Fischer, Giesking and Cortot
selections measure up to the
quality of the other two volumes,
partly because of the extremely
high quality of the other pieces,
but also because the selections are
not the best ones recorded by
these soloists.


DOUGLAS LEEDY, composer and peri'onner of electronic music presents the
ELECTRIC ZODIAC on Capitol Records.
The Capitol Recording Company,
which among other things,
distributes Capitol, Angel,
Seraphim and Apple labels, has
been doing its best to appeal to all
segments of the music market; its
recent releases have done just
that. I'd like to mention a few of
the better Rock LP's in passing,
and then- discuss one of the best
releases I've heard in a good long
time.

There are three factions in the
rock scene today. They bicker
over what the proper way to play
rock really is. The conservatives,
represented on Capitol by the
Grand Funk Railroad and the
Sons (formerly the Sons 'a'
Champlain), play rock on rock
instruments, electric guitar and
bass, organ, drums, occasionally a
sax or horn.
The Liberals feel that rock
should continue to progress in the

same direction as it has been, and
support the use of more advanced
electronic gear. Capital has a
couple of records out by Douglas
Leedy playing Moog and Buchla
Synthesizers and his own
invention, the Ognob generator.
The Radical elements are
supporting the use of way-out
instrumental combinations, and
have met with much opposition
from the establishment.
Douglas Leedy's album is not
really rock; it is continuous,
strange electronic music that
defies further description. The
album is called Electric Zodiac,
although there is no attempt to
represent the Twelve Signs in
sound. Rather, it is an attempt to
capture the "music of the
spheres," and if you just relax and
let the music envelope you, it can
be both frightening and exciting.
The Jacket notes do not tell
you what to think or do. It's up
to you. Leedy's compositions
have more feeling than most
electronic productions; although I
don't usually think much of such
stuff, this particular album is
intriguing. Be sure to listen to it
with headphones.
The best set now being
distributed by Capitol is on the
Seraphim label, the low-cost
cousin to the marvelous
recordings on Angel. Under the
general category "Great
Recordings of the Century," they
have assembled some of the
outstanding muscial performances
since recording instruments were
developed.
Having reposed for years on
ancient tape and fragile discs,
Seraphim engineers have managed
to transfer priceless performances
by Rudolf Serkin, Arthur
Schnabel, Pablo Casals, Alfred

Cortot, Adolf Busch, Nadia
Boulanger, and many others to
modern LP's, while removing
most of the static, scratches, and
record noise. On these discs are
the musical treasures of this era.
Do not expect the sound of
these performances to match that
of your contemporary recordings
of the same pieces. Most of these
tapes were done before World War
11, in a time very different from
the present. These recordings,
speak of a musical style less
hurried than that of today, more
intent on the text, more faithful
to the composer's style.
There is mellowness and full
orchestration here where today's
performances too often go in for
brashness, and showy style. The
object of the performers in these
albums was to present the
greatness of the music as clearly
and purely as possible.
The six concertos in the first
set are illustrative of the care
taken with these interpretations.
The Beethoven Piano Concerto
No. 2 is played by Artur
Schnabel, and the Philharmonia
Orchestra led by Issay Dobrowen
with the feeling that comes only
with years of living with
Beethoven's music. Relatively
small in scale, the Piano Concerto
No. 2 has never gained the
admiration given to the Fourth,
for it is more like a chamber
work.
Mr. Schnabel leads us and
carries us through the music,
carefully unfolding the genius of
the composer who he understands
best. It is a magnificent
performance, as are most of the
others in this set: Mozart Piano
Concerto No. 24 with Edwin
Fischer and the London
Philharmonic led by Lawrance

Collingwood; Brahms Double
Concerto for violin and cello with
Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals,
and Alfred Cortot directing the
Pablo Casals Orchestra of
Barcelona; Fritz Kreisler playing
the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto
with Sir Landon Ronald and the
London Philharmonic, and
Maurice Ravel conducting
Marguerite Long in his Piano
Concerto in G. All these are
superb and justly famous
performances.
Soloists Not True
I take issue with one piece on
the album, however: Bach's
Brandenberg Concerto No. 5 is
played by Adolf Busch's great
chamber orchestra, but the
soloists are simply not true to the
score. The musicians are the
world's finest, but they play the
wrong instruments. The Concerto
was scored for violin, recorder and
harpsichord, but this recording
presents instead violin, flute and
piano (Adolf Busch, Marcel Moyse
and Rudolf Serkin).
Few chamber groups use the
recorder (substituting flute), but
most are able to find a competent
harpsichord and hear a piano.
However, the other five pieces
make this album most
worthwhile.

No. 2 has never gained the
admiration given to the Fourth,
for it is more like a chamber
work.
Mr. Schnabel leads us and
carries us through the music,
carefully unfolding the genius of
the composer who he understands
best. It is a magnificent
performance, as are most of the
others in this set: Mozart Piano
Concerto No. 24 with Edwin
Fischer and the London
Philharmonic led by Lawrance

Collingwood; Brahms Double
Concerto for violin and cello with
Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals,
and Alfred Cortot directing the
Pablo Casals Orchestra of
Barcelona; Fritz Kreisler playing
the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto
with Sir Landon Ronald and the
London Philharmonic, and
Maurice Ravel conducting
Marguerite Long in his Piano
Concerto in G. All these are
superb and justly famous
performances.
Soloists Not True
I take issue with one piece on
the album, however: Bach's
Brandenberg Concerto No. 5 is
played by Adolf Busch's great
chamber orchestra, but the
soloists are simply not true to the
score. The musicians are the
world's finest, but they play the
wrong instruments. The Concerto
was scored for violin, recorder and
harpsichord, but this recording
presents instead violin, flute and
piano (Adolf Busch, Marcel Moyse
and Rudolf Serkin).
Few chamber groups use the
recorder (substituting flute), but
most are able to find a competent
harpsichord and hear a piano.
However, the other five pieces
make this album most
worthwhile.
Six Chamber Music Masterpieces
is the title of the second of the
three boxes in this set, and that is
no understatement. Pieces
presented are Mozart Piano
Quartet K. 478 with Artur
Schnabel and members of the Pro
Arte Quartet; Fritz Kriesler and
Franz Rupp playing Beethoven
Violin Sonata No. 9 ("Kreutzer");
Thibaud, Casals and Cortot with
the Piano Trio in D Minor by
Mendelssohn; Thibaud, Long,
Pierre Fournier and Maurice

Vieux in Faure's Piano Quartet
No. 2 (probably his best work);
the Debussy Piano Sonata played
by Robert Casadesus and Maurice
Marechal; and finally, -the finest
piece on the album, Brahms'
exciting Horn Trio in E flat,
played by Serkin, Busch, and the
legendary Aubrey Brain, probably
the greatest horn player who ever
lived.
This recording was felt to be so
perfect by Brain's contemporaries
that for years no one else dared to
record it â€”and this performance is
undeniably one of the most
superb recordings of horn music
ever made.
The final three records contain
piano solo pieces by Edwin
Fischer, Walter Giesking, Dame
Myra Hess, Artur Schnabel,
Solomon, and Alfred Cortot. Only
the Fischer, Giesking and Cortot
selections measure up to the
quality of the other two volumes,
partly because of the extremely
high quality of the other pieces,
but also because the selections are
not the best ones recorded by
these soloists.


DOUGLAS LEEDY, composer and peri'onner of electronic music presents the
ELECTRIC ZODIAC on Capitol Records.
The Capitol Recording Company,
which among other things,
distributes Capitol, Angel,
Seraphim and Apple labels, has
been doing its best to appeal to all
segments of the music market; its
recent releases have done just
that. I'd like to mention a few of
the better Rock LP's in passing,
and then- discuss one of the best
releases I've heard in a good long
time.

There are three factions in the
rock scene today. They bicker
over what the proper way to play
rock really is. The conservatives,
represented on Capitol by the
Grand Funk Railroad and the
Sons (formerly the Sons 'a'
Champlain), play rock on rock
instruments, electric guitar and
bass, organ, drums, occasionally a
sax or horn.
The Liberals feel that rock
should continue to progress in the

same direction as it has been, and
support the use of more advanced
electronic gear. Capital has a
couple of records out by Douglas
Leedy playing Moog and Buchla
Synthesizers and his own
invention, the Ognob generator.
The Radical elements are
supporting the use of way-out
instrumental combinations, and
have met with much opposition
from the establishment.
Douglas Leedy's album is not
really rock; it is continuous,
strange electronic music that
defies further description. The
album is called Electric Zodiac,
although there is no attempt to
represent the Twelve Signs in
sound. Rather, it is an attempt to
capture the "music of the
spheres," and if you just relax and
let the music envelope you, it can
be both frightening and exciting.
The Jacket notes do not tell
you what to think or do. It's up
to you. Leedy's compositions
have more feeling than most
electronic productions; although I
don't usually think much of such
stuff, this particular album is
intriguing. Be sure to listen to it
with headphones.
The best set now being
distributed by Capitol is on the
Seraphim label, the low-cost
cousin to the marvelous
recordings on Angel. Under the
general category "Great
Recordings of the Century," they
have assembled some of the
outstanding muscial performances
since recording instruments were
developed.
Having reposed for years on
ancient tape and fragile discs,
Seraphim engineers have managed
to transfer priceless performances
by Rudolf Serkin, Arthur
Schnabel, Pablo Casals, Alfred

Cortot, Adolf Busch, Nadia
Boulanger, and many others to
modern LP's, while removing
most of the static, scratches, and
record noise. On these discs are
the musical treasures of this era.
Do not expect the sound of
these performances to match that
of your contemporary recordings
of the same pieces. Most of these
tapes were done before World War
11, in a time very different from
the present. These recordings,
speak of a musical style less
hurried than that of today, more
intent on the text, more faithful
to the composer's style.
There is mellowness and full
orchestration here where today's
performances too often go in for
brashness, and showy style. The
object of the performers in these
albums was to present the
greatness of the music as clearly
and purely as possible.
The six concertos in the first
set are illustrative of the care
taken with these interpretations.
The Beethoven Piano Concerto
No. 2 is played by Artur
Schnabel, and the Philharmonia
Orchestra led by Issay Dobrowen
with the feeling that comes only
with years of living with
Beethoven's music. Relatively
small in scale, the Piano Concerto
No. 2 has never gained the
admiration given to the Fourth,
for it is more like a chamber
work.

recordings on Angel. Under the
general category "Great
Recordings of the Century," they
have assembled some of the
outstanding muscial performances
since recording instruments were
developed.
Having reposed for years on
ancient tape and fragile discs,
Seraphim engineers have managed
to transfer priceless performances
by Rudolf Serkin, Arthur
Schnabel, Pablo Casals, Alfred

Cortot, Adolf Busch, Nadia
Boulanger, and many others to
modern LP's, while removing
most of the static, scratches, and
record noise. On these discs are
the musical treasures of this era.
Do not expect the sound of
these performances to match that
of your contemporary recordings
of the same pieces. Most of these
tapes were done before World War
11, in a time very different from
the present. These recordings,
speak of a musical style less
hurried than that of today, more
intent on the text, more faithful
to the composer's style.
There is mellowness and full
orchestration here where today's
performances too often go in for
brashness, and showy style. The
object of the performers in these
albums was to present the
greatness of the music as clearly
and purely as possible.
The six concertos in the first
set are illustrative of the care
taken with these interpretations.
The Beethoven Piano Concerto
No. 2 is played by Artur
Schnabel, and the Philharmonia
Orchestra led by Issay Dobrowen
with the feeling that comes only
with years of living with
Beethoven's music. Relatively
small in scale, the Piano Concerto
No. 2 has never gained the
admiration given to the Fourth,
for it is more like a chamber
work.
Mr. Schnabel leads us and
carries us through the music,
carefully unfolding the genius of
the composer who he understands
best. It is a magnificent
performance, as are most of the
others in this set: Mozart Piano
Concerto No. 24 with Edwin
Fischer and the London
Philharmonic led by Lawrance

Collingwood; Brahms Double
Concerto for violin and cello with
Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals,
and Alfred Cortot directing the
Pablo Casals Orchestra of
Barcelona; Fritz Kreisler playing
the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto
with Sir Landon Ronald and the
London Philharmonic, and
Maurice Ravel conducting
Marguerite Long in his Piano
Concerto in G. All these are
superb and justly famous
performances.
Soloists Not True
I take issue with one piece on
the album, however: Bach's
Brandenberg Concerto No. 5 is
played by Adolf Busch's great
chamber orchestra, but the
soloists are simply not true to the
score. The musicians are the
world's finest, but they play the
wrong instruments. The Concerto
was scored for violin, recorder and
harpsichord, but this recording
presents instead violin, flute and
piano (Adolf Busch, Marcel Moyse
and Rudolf Serkin).
Few chamber groups use the
recorder (substituting flute), but
most are able to find a competent
harpsichord and hear a piano.
However, the other five pieces
make this album most
worthwhile.
Six Chamber Music Masterpieces
is the title of the second of the
three boxes in this set, and that is
no understatement. Pieces
presented are Mozart Piano
Quartet K. 478 with Artur
Schnabel and members of the Pro
Arte Quartet; Fritz Kriesler and
Franz Rupp playing Beethoven
Violin Sonata No. 9 ("Kreutzer");
Thibaud, Casals and Cortot with
the Piano Trio in D Minor by
Mendelssohn; Thibaud, Long,
Pierre Fournier and Maurice

Vieux in Faure's Piano Quartet
No. 2 (probably his best work);
the Debussy Piano Sonata played
by Robert Casadesus and Maurice
Marechal; and finally, -the finest
piece on the album, Brahms'
exciting Horn Trio in E flat,
played by Serkin, Busch, and the
legendary Aubrey Brain, probably
the greatest horn player who ever
lived.
This recording was felt to be so
perfect by Brain's contemporaries
that for years no one else dared to
record it â€”and this performance is
undeniably one of the most
superb recordings of horn music
ever made.
The final three records contain
piano solo pieces by Edwin
Fischer, Walter Giesking, Dame
Myra Hess, Artur Schnabel,
Solomon, and Alfred Cortot. Only
the Fischer, Giesking and Cortot
selections measure up to the
quality of the other two volumes,
partly because of the extremely
high quality of the other pieces,
but also because the selections are
not the best ones recorded by
these soloists.
