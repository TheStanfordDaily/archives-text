# Doubled Up
## Lose Time, Lose Tricks 
### Marshall Schwartz 
Procrastination is the thief of
time, according to the old saw.
Sometimes, it can also be the thief
of tricks. Witness the following
hand.

The Bidding:
W N E S
Pass Pass Pass ID
Pass IS Pass 2NT
Pass 3H Pass 3NT
Pass Pass Pass
Opening Lead: Club 5
The bidding was quite standard.
North showed his two majors, but
South, with only doubletons in
the majors, would have no part of
it, and proceeded to the natural
no-trump game.
West's opening lead was far
from thrilling, but clubs was his
longest suit. East covered
dummy's nine with his king, and
South won with his ace. Declarer
now cashed his ace of diamonds,
and then paused for some
thought. He wanted to get to
board to take a diamond finesse,
but he didn't want to leave spades
wide open.
So he decided to see if he could
set up hearts before crossing to
the board. He first led the
queen —and West, not being
omniscient, held up his ace.
Actually, he thought it likely his
partner held the king. When South
led the king on the next trick, he
now correctly refused to
cover —for, if he did, he could see
that dummy's heart suit would be
established.
South, with only thyspade ace
as an entry to dummy, decided to
play diamonds out of his own
hand. The queen fell under his
king, and he rejoiced. He began
running diamonds, and West began
to squirm. This is the position
before South led his last diamond:

Wh declarer played the
diamo; deuce, West was
squeezed. If he threw his club,
hoping his partner had the 10,
South would just pitch the heart
nine from dummy, lead the club
ten, and squeeze West again—and
take all 13 tricks. If West pitched
his heart ace, declarer would pitch
thyspade jack from dummy and
the board would be good.

So West sadly parted with his
spade king, grimacing. South,
realizing the position, pitched a
heart, led to dummy, and
conceded the last trick to West's
ace of hearts. Making six no
trump.
West could obviously have
avioded the debacle if he had led a
spade honor. Then, when he got
in with the heart ace, he could
have cashed his spade trick. But
he could also have succeeded if he
had taken South's queen with his
ace. Now, he merely returns a
spade honor, knocking out
declarer's sole entry to dummy
before he can unblock the heart
suit.
South can still make 11 tricks
by ducking the lead of the honor,
and pitching his losing club on the
jack of spades later. But that's one
trick better than the defense
managed.
All they got was the lonely ace
of hearts which West waited with
until it was too late.
