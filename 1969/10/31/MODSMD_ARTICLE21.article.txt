# Gilbert & Sullivan: 'Sparkling Show'
## 
### 
So you say Gilbert and Sullivan
is not your thing. The
Lamplighter's prodion of The
Mikado, directed by Ann Mac Nab,
may change your mind. From the
first to the last chorus, it is a
sparkling show which picks up its
audience and never lets it down.
The plot is an absurd spoof
which involves a sweet young
thing, Yum-Yum, her lecherous
I guardian, Ko-Ko, Lord High
Executioner; and a wandering
[ minstrel, Nanki-Poo, in i ty the
\ son of the Mikado of Jap
The story musically ts its
! way through various typi G and
| 3 complications to the i itable
, lappy ending. Ko-Ko i ads it
t difficult because of his
, jqueamishness to carry out his
| duties as executioner. He
therefore recounts an imaginary
execution for the Mikado, only to
, discover he has supposedly slain
, the Mikado's son.
, It looks like the axe for Ko-Ko,
; but salvation appears in the form
, of Katisha, a noble lady in love
, with Nanki-Poo. She is
, successfully persuaded to transfer
. her affections to Ko-Ko, who has
previously hungered after
Yum-Yum, who is of course in
love with Nanki-Poo. At any
excuse, the chorus leaps on stage
to sing an operatic number.
William Neil as the Mikado gave
the famous song "Let the
Punishment Fit the Crime" a truly

diabolical laugh. June Wilkins, as
Katisha, played a magnificant
rich-voiced shrew, discoursing
upon her beauty, which may not
be obvious to the casual beholder.
Peggy Overshiner was a suitably
cloying Yum-Yum and Orva
Hoskinson a romantic Nanki-Poo.
Eugene Bartlett as Poo-Bah,
"Lord High Everything Else"
(besides executioner), nearly
stopped the show each time he
undertook a new official post.
I was pleased to hear the words
in all the songs—something even
D'Oyly Carte comr n\
always seem able
choreography of si
on the small stag« and
there were som' r bits
using Oriental fan.
Someone who understands
music better than I, will
appreciate the operatic subtitles
of the score. A few of the
"schoolgirls" are well on the far
side of eighteen, but they simper
and sing well enough to make up
for that slight drawback.
All in all, a fantastic funny
show. And an excellent
introduction to Gilbert and
Sullivan. Tickets can be bought
through TICKETRON, Memorial
Hall Box Office, on campus.
Performances continue Fridays
and Saturdays, as well as a Sunday
matinee, through November 8, at
the Presentation Theatre in San
Francisco.
