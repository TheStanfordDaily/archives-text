# 'Iceman' Opens
## O'Neill Vignette Stunning 
### MARILYN MORRIS 
A three and one-half hour
descent into the amber,
fly-specked dusk of Harry Hope's
bar was exhausted—with
safaction—the opening-night
audience of Eugene O'Neill's "The
Iceman Cometh," the initial
production of the Stanford
Repertory Theater's (SRT)
1969-70 season.
The Nobel Prize winning drama
concerns the derelict habitus of a
"palace of pipe dreams" who
nourish their fantasies on rot-gut
until jarred from paralysis by the
iconoclastic evangelism of a
former drinking mate.
Bot Bates, as Harry Hopem
complaisant patron of the pipe
dream, rendered the parsimonious
bar keeper with lipped control.
His accent, which might have
collapsed into broad caricature by
one less skillful, remained a rich,
subtle brogue.
Roger Hardy's manner and d
delivery as Rocky, the
bartender-procurer, were mature
beyond the expectations derived
from his fresh-faced youthfulness.
Sympathetic Portrayal
Larry, the world-weary
anarchist-turned-grandstand
philosopher, was portrayed
sympathetically by Richard
Rekow. Although the theatrical
presence of Rekow the actor was,
at times, too much in evidence, he
evoked just empathy for the
dilemma of the contemplative
man. He recognizes the sustaining
value of others' dreams, though
hollow and unrealizable.
Richard Rekow was a tragic
buffoon as Hugo, larry's Slavic
comrade in anarchism. His
sporadic fits of drunken ranting
damning his bougeois companions
or fantasizing about the
revolutionary promised
land—provided a wistful comic
refrainttvo v the heavy dialogue.
Hugo's realization of the bloody
hue of his pipe dream and his
guilty demagogic pleasure in
leading the proletariat was a
minor miracle.
Roger Kozol as Willie Oban,
brilliant young degenerate, at first
obscured the terror of a tenuously
controlled delerium with a
clownish bravado. Kozol's
characterization flowered in the
third act, however, as Willie
emerged in his true vulnerability.
Molasses Movements
Molasses movements and
mellow inflection marked John H.
Cochran's exquisite portrait of
Joe Mott, the "white Negro"
gambling man. The camaraderie of
two Boer War veterans from
opposite camps was played to a
fine absurdity by Michael Murphy
and Gene L. Engene.
The solidarity of O'Neill's
dipsomanic tribe is ironically
shattered by the guest whom they
await, the salesman Hickey, whose
jests are turned to deflating their

fantasies with an evangelistic zeal.
Wes Finley's bravura
performance peaked in act four
with a long recitative before
dispassionate police and alienated
friends. It is at once his personal
testament to self-knowledge and
his justification for the murder of
his wife as perpetrator of his pipe
dream, the "good woman," the
source of his guilt.
V irtuosic Stain ina
Finley sustains the tragic
tension with virtuosic stamina. He
regresses from the salesman's
jovial heartiness (punctuated by a
perfect fist in palm gesture) to a
final desperate ambivalence about
his own motives. The scene of his
avowal is a beautiful synthesis of
the persuasive sales-pitch and the
interior monolouge.
Gene Paraseghian was earnest,
if a bit foppish, as Don Farrit, a
child Judas whose love-hate for
his revolutionary mother drives
him to betray her. This violent
emotional dualism about the
women in his life is a rough
analogue of Hickey's dilemma.
Both, bereft of the sustaining
dream, are destroyed.
The questions emerge. What are
the limits of constructive guilt?
Should the Lotus-eaters be
granted the honey of peace in
illusion? To what degree is
everyman sustained by a pipe
dream?


IN THE DREGS of a saloon, Joe Moll, a cameo character in SRT's production of
"'lTm' Iceman Cometh," strains to express himself. The play opened a two-week
run at the Little Theater Wednesday night. Performances are Wednesdays through
Saturdays.
