# Cochran: Social Worker Revamps Career As Actor
## 
### GARY LINDSEY 
Six years ago John Cochran was a psychiatric
social worker in the black ghetto of Los Angeles.
Today he is guest artist in the Stanford Repertory
Theater's production of "The Iceman Cometh,"
which opened Wednesday in The Little Theater.
Cochran discovered he could say more to more
people from a stage. So he put his Master's degree
in Social Work in a drawer and set out to make it
as an actor. His long list of television credits is just
one criterion of his success.
SRT's guest performer did not sit by the phone
and wait for Hollywood to call. He wanted steady
work in the theater so he created the opportunities
himself.
In 1964 he founded the San Francisco Players.
Then in 1965, while a producer-director for the
Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, he founded
the Pittsburgh Black Art Society. His most recent
endeavor was Dialogue Black/White, Inc.which
produced "Big Time Buch White" in San
Francisco.
Last winter Cochran was invited by Stanford's
Black Student Union to direct a program that
would develop Black Theater Arts at the
university. Starting with students, many of whom
had no dramatic background, he produced and
directed "Experiments in Black" which featured
the West Coast premieres of three off-Broadway
plays.
An Artist First
Although Cochran's work has been concerned

with black drama, he considers himself an artist
before anything else. "But sometimes," he
explains, "my art just happens to come out
black."
In O'Neill's "The Iceman Cometh," Cochran
plays the part of a 60-year-old one-time gambling
hall owner, Joe Mott.
"I don't want him coming off as an Uncle Tom,"
said Cochran, "but that's what he was, I guess. Joe
has a dream, a dream that he is white. But Hickey
forces him to realize that all he is doing is running
away from himself. What Joe really wants is to be
accepted, and in the play, that is possible only as a
white man.
Still the Same Story
"Today the kids scream 'Black is beautiful,'but
it's still the same story," explained Cochran. "In a
sense, they are also trying to be white. They only
want their share of that pie.
"When I came along the word black was a
terrible thing. So I threw out color and grew up only
as a part of society.
"Now it's different. Black people are proud to
be black, but sometimes I think we are falling into
the kind of false pride that the white man has.
"Color differences are so trite, so banal. They
are just an excuse to hate. What we need now
more than anything else is to laugh at ourselves.
It's a sign of healthiness," said Cochran.
"The dream of Joe Mott was just that, a dream.
But don't feel sorry for him. Perhaps it is still the
dream of today."

In 1964 he founded the San Francisco Players.
Then in 1965, while a producer-director for the
Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, he founded
the Pittsburgh Black Art Society. His most recent
endeavor was Dialogue Black/White, Inc.which
produced "Big Time Buch White" in San
Francisco.
Last winter Cochran was invited by Stanford's
Black Student Union to direct a program that
would develop Black Theater Arts at the
university. Starting with students, many of whom
had no dramatic background, he produced and
directed "Experiments in Black" which featured
the West Coast premieres of three off-Broadway
plays.
An Artist First
Although Cochran's work has been concerned

with black drama, he considers himself an artist
before anything else. "But sometimes," he
explains, "my art just happens to come out
black."
In O'Neill's "The Iceman Cometh," Cochran
plays the part of a 60-year-old one-time gambling
hall owner, Joe Mott.
"I don't want him coming off as an Uncle Tom,"
said Cochran, "but that's what he was, I guess. Joe
has a dream, a dream that he is white. But Hickey
forces him to realize that all he is doing is running
away from himself. What Joe really wants is to be
accepted, and in the play, that is possible only as a
white man.
Still the Same Story
"Today the kids scream 'Black is beautiful,'but
it's still the same story," explained Cochran. "In a
sense, they are also trying to be white. They only
want their share of that pie.
"When I came along the word black was a
terrible thing. So I threw out color and grew up only
as a part of society.
"Now it's different. Black people are proud to
be black, but sometimes I think we are falling into
the kind of false pride that the white man has.
"Color differences are so trite, so banal. They
are just an excuse to hate. What we need now
more than anything else is to laugh at ourselves.
It's a sign of healthiness," said Cochran.
"The dream of Joe Mott was just that, a dream.
But don't feel sorry for him. Perhaps it is still the
dream of today."
Six years ago John Cochran was a psychiatric
social worker in the black ghetto of Los Angeles.
Today he is guest artist in the Stanford Repertory
Theater's production of "The Iceman Cometh,"
which opened Wednesday in The Little Theater.
Cochran discovered he could say more to more
people from a stage. So he put his Master's degree
in Social Work in a drawer and set out to make it
as an actor. His long list of television credits is just
one criterion of his success.
SRT's guest performer did not sit by the phone
and wait for Hollywood to call. He wanted steady
work in the theater so he created the opportunities
himself.
