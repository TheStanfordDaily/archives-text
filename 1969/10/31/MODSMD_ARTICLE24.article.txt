# For What It's Worth
## Airplane Album-Good Growls 
### CRAIG OKINO 
One of the major problems the
Airplane has had, and they
themselves are the first to admit
it, is the inability to come across
as well in the studio as they do in
person (a dilemma they share with
many other bands).
They were even dissatisfied
with various live tapes of
themselves, that is, until Bless Its
Pointed Little Head came slong.
Tha album had the Airplane
doing what it does best: growling
hard rock—Grace, Marty and Paul
screaming their guts out, Casady's
rampant bass grunts and Spencer's
drum punches pushing them on,
Jorma's guitar on the verge of
hysteria.
All the Airplane freaks ate it
up, and those who weren't hot on
the Airplane before found
themselves believers. I had some
minor complaints with the album,
namely the song choices and the
concert choices, but it still ranks
as one of the best live rock
albums, a shade below
Quicksilver's Happy Trailerss.
After incredible hassles over
lyrics by RCA (whom the
Airplane, by now know full well
isn't the most understanding
company in the recording
industry), their new album,
Volunteers (RCA LSP-4238) was
released earlier this week. The
newspaper logo cover is
outrageous, mocking the
Chronicle's "Question Man" and
rock festivals in general (The Paz
Chin—ln), and the inside
newsletter is a further example of
the Airplane's weird brand of
humor.
Not as Good as Live
Unfortunately, the record
inside the jacket reveals that the
Airplane still have not resolved
the studio vs. live performance
problem. Everything is there
except the intangible ingredient,
the stinging bite of the live
Airplane. And 1 think one reason
for this is the tinkling of Nicky
Hopkin's piano in the
background. Although he is an
excellent pianist (remember the
job he did on the Stones' Beggar's
Banquet?), he contributes nothing
to this album, occupying most of
his time playing the same chords
Kantner does on rhythm guitar.
The tracks Hopkins plays on

sound very studioish because of
this.
The songs, however, are up to
their usual standard—in other
words, very good. Ever since A iter
Bathing at Baxter's, Paul Kantner
has assumed the burden of
songwriting, and his "We Can Be
Together" is an excellent opening
tune. The Airplane have long since
resolved any ego trips and
member conflicts they might have
had, and the result is a very loose
framework which lets each
member do what he pleases and
still remain in the band—for
example, Jorma, Casady and Balin
have another group. Hot Tuna.
Freedom Shows in Music
This freedom within the
structure shows itself in the
Airplane's music, which consists
of a central core from which each
musician can create and interact.
Again, they resemble the Dead in
this aspect, although the Dead's
music is more complex. "We Can
Be Together" is one of those
songs. It also contains that
naughty, naughty word RCA
objected to.
Lyrically, while Balin is earthy
and Grace is abstract, Kantner is
perched somewhere in between.
All three are fine songwriters,
Marty being the most melodic and
Grace the least; but this does not
apply to Dryden. His
contribution, "A Song for All
Seasons," is musically out of
context with the album and with
the Airplane. Jorma is a capable
songwriter, but not a very good
singer, like Spence. They do the
vocals on their own compositions,
which is as it should be, I guess,
though I'm sure one of the others
could have done a better job.
However, the vocal power of the
Plane prevails, especially in
Crosby, Stills, and Nash's
"Wooden Ships" and in Balin's
lone composition, "Volunteers."
In reviewing a band of the
Airplane's caliber, there is bound
to be more critical comment
involved, simply because they are
an established group—they must
maintain a standard to stay that
way. They have maintained it
with Volunteers; although it
won't win album of the year
honors, it will get played a lot,
and it'll do nicely until the
Airplane perform again—very
nicely.
