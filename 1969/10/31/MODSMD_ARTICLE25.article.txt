### TODD McCARTHY 
As many of us have guessed all
along, Mike Nichols will not be
showing an excerpt from Catch-22
at his retrospective at the San
Francisco Film Festival.
Apparently, studio executives at
Paramount got paranoid about the
great amount of publicity the
advance screening was receiving
and thus refused Nichols a print.
Film festival officials had been
worried about this possibility even
from the first press conference.
Frankly, they shouldn't have said
a word about it and then sprung
the sequences on an unexpecting
audience. As it is, Nichols will
appear at the Masonic at 1 P.M.
this afternoon with clips from
Virginia Wooll' and Graduate and,
hopefully, some witty comments.
A benefit party for Ad Hoc
Film Society will be held on
Saturday night at the Old House,
2126 Broadway, in San Francisco.
Admission is $5 and from there,
you may consume all the liquor
and old movies you want.
Proceeds will go into production
costs for the society's upcoming
films.
Double Bill
One of the best double bills to
come along in quite a while is
Yellow Submarine and That Man
From Rio, now at the Aquarius 11.
Go see if there are any visual clues
suggesting that Paul McCartney is
dead (this observer thinks
McCartney is really Spiro T.
Agnew. Have you ever seen them
in a picture together? How do you
explain the song, "Fool on the
Hill?' 1 ).
That Man From Rio is one of
the great "fun" pictures of
all-time. The film's director,
Phillipe de Broca, is probably the
most neglected of the younger
French artists (he also did the
brilliant King of Hearts. De
Broca's Devil by the Tail, with
Yves Montand, is still the best
new film I've seen so far this year
but to my knowledge, it hasn't
played anywhere but New York,
where it opened and closed within
a couple of weeks. C'est
dommage.
The Real Thing
Though the theatre is using the
surprisingly cautious title of Viva
and Louis, Berkeley's Telegraph
Repertory is showing Andy

Warhol's new picture which has,
at various times, been named Blue
Mo\ie and Fuck. The later title
explains what happens during one
section of the film (and, for those
who care, it Docs happen, unlike
the simulated silliness in 1 Am
Curious and Oh! Calcutta!)'
The film was confiscated by the
authorities after a week's run in
New York this summer; the
obscenity of such self-righteous
action is further compounded by
the fact that is is the theater
manager, ticker taker and
projectionist who are charged in
these cases, not those responsible.

Hill?' 1 ).
That Man From Rio is one of
the great "fun" pictures of
all-time. The film's director,
Phillipe de Broca, is probably the
most neglected of the younger
French artists (he also did the
brilliant King of Hearts. De
Broca's Devil by the Tail, with
Yves Montand, is still the best
new film I've seen so far this year
but to my knowledge, it hasn't
played anywhere but New York,
where it opened and closed within
a couple of weeks. C'est
dommage.
The Real Thing
Though the theatre is using the
surprisingly cautious title of Viva
and Louis, Berkeley's Telegraph
Repertory is showing Andy

Warhol's new picture which has,
at various times, been named Blue
Mo\ie and Fuck. The later title
explains what happens during one
section of the film (and, for those
who care, it Docs happen, unlike
the simulated silliness in 1 Am
Curious and Oh! Calcutta!)'
The film was confiscated by the
authorities after a week's run in
New York this summer; the
obscenity of such self-righteous
action is further compounded by
the fact that is is the theater
manager, ticker taker and
projectionist who are charged in
these cases, not those responsible.

As many of us have guessed all
along, Mike Nichols will not be
showing an excerpt from Catch-22
at his retrospective at the San
Francisco Film Festival.
Apparently, studio executives at
Paramount got paranoid about the
great amount of publicity the
advance screening was receiving
and thus refused Nichols a print.
Film festival officials had been
worried about this possibility even
from the first press conference.
Frankly, they shouldn't have said
a word about it and then sprung
the sequences on an unexpecting
audience. As it is, Nichols will
appear at the Masonic at 1 P.M.
this afternoon with clips from
Virginia Wooll' and Graduate and,
hopefully, some witty comments.
A benefit party for Ad Hoc
Film Society will be held on
Saturday night at the Old House,
2126 Broadway, in San Francisco.
Admission is $5 and from there,
you may consume all the liquor
and old movies you want.
Proceeds will go into production
costs for the society's upcoming
films.
Double Bill
One of the best double bills to
come along in quite a while is
Yellow Submarine and That Man
From Rio, now at the Aquarius 11.
Go see if there are any visual clues
suggesting that Paul McCartney is
dead (this observer thinks
McCartney is really Spiro T.
Agnew. Have you ever seen them
in a picture together? How do you
explain the song, "Fool on the
Hill?' 1 ).
