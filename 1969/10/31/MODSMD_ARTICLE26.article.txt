# New University Conference
## NUC Will Support Moratorium 
### 
The Stanford chapter of the
New University Conference
decided this week to support the
upcoming November Moratorium,
but "recognized the need to raise
the level of the political
consciousness of those people
participating in the Moratorium
with specific reference to the role
of American Imperialism in
Southeast Asia," according to
Professor Harold Kahn, acting
chairman of the meeting.
Five resolutions where
presented to the approximately
30 people present by Professor
Charles Stein, spokesman for the
NUC Subcommitte on
Moratorium Policy. The
resolutions were approved as
follows:
to carry out a drive for faculty
members to cancel classes on Nov.
14 and 15 in order to allow them
and their students to participate
in the Moratorium;
to support the right of Stanford
employees to stay away from
work on the 14th and 15th in
order to participate in the
Moratorium;
to join the Moratorium
Committee in sponsoring a noon
rally in the Stanford Industrial
Park on Thursday, Nov. 13;
to support the action of the

Concerned Asian Scholars in
demonstrating at the South
Vietnamese Consulate on Nov. 13j
to support the Provisional
Revolutionary Government as the
sole legitimate government of
South Vietnam.
Members of the NUC
subcommittee which originally
drew up these resolutions include
Profs. Charles Drekmeier, Bruce
Franklin, Steve Weissman, Bruce
Pollock, Mark Weiss, Janet Weiss,
and Joe Hardigree.
National Organization
The NUC, as described by Prof.
Stein, is "a national organization
formed to enable radical faculty
members, graduate students and
other members of the university
community to study the
relationship between their

political beliefs and their work at
the University, and to act in
accordance with their
conclusions."
Although a number of people
on campus over the last few years
have been members of the
national NUC, the Stanford
chapter itself is less than two
weeks old. On the local level it is
autonomous within the very
broadly defined goals of the
national organization.
In a leaflet circulated at the
first NUC meeting on Octover 20,
Prof. Kahn wrote "Events of the
past few years have indicated that
radically committed intellectuals
are all too often divided
intellectuals: 'concerned faculty'
follow causes rather than define
them; political science graduate
students work for curriculum

changes in a vacuum; resistance
work is silently assumed to be
extra-curricular, mid-peninsula
intellectuals, having no formal ties
to the university, as isolated. .
He hopes that the NUC will help
solve this problem by bringing
radical people of all kinds
together.
Radical Critique
According to Prof. Kahn the
Stanford NUC is concerned with
a radical critique of the whole
university structure. Areas of
interest include the role of
professional organizations and the

possibilities of establishing radical
caucuses in them, the restrictive
nature of formalized disciplines;
and support of graduate students
in political science and other
departments who are trying to
organize courses relevant to
radical political concerns.
The next meeting of the NUC is
scheduled for Sunday, 4:30 p.m.
in TMU, Room 274. Topics to be
discussed include implementation
of the resolutions on the
Moratorium and the underground
publication of professors' salaries
earlier this week.


GUAIEMALAN PAINTINGSâ€”An exhibition of 29 paintings by local artist Lois
Paul will be on display from November 2 through 21 at Tresidder. An
anthropologist and field worker among the Guatemalan Indians from
1941-1969, Mrs. Paul is heavily influenced by native art, architecture and
textiles of that country. A recurring theme in her work is the gradual intrusion
of modern technology into Indian culture.
