# Peace Corps To Name Rep
## 
### 
Although the Peace Corps has
chosen to swell its ranks with
specialists, it still relies on the
involvement of college graduates
to carry on its committments.
In order to inform and interest
students at Stanford, long the
source of many volunteers, there
will be established for the first
time a permanent Corps
representative on campus.
Jane Mingori, of the San
Fransisco office, would like to
clear up the confusion
surrounding recent changes in the
agency's personnel policies.
Due to overseas requests, the
quota of occupational workers,
such as engineers, farmers,
teachers, and architects, has been
increased this year from a tenth to
a quarter of the total volunteer
recruitment. This new group will
include a number of families.
However, she emphasizes the
continuing need for idealistic,
widely-educated young people in
overseas social aid.

She quotes a recent speech by
Director Joseph Blatchford:
"The new directions of Peace
Corps aren't going to alter its role;
they are intended to help better
carry out that role. They aren't
going to shut the recent college
graduate out of the Peace Corps.
They are going to place people
from all works of life, from all
backgrounds, and of all ages side
by side."
It is hoped that the new
campus representative will be able
to aid understanding of issues in
conflict in the Peace Corps and of
the new directions it has taken to
preser.ve its value in
underdeveloped countries.
Returned Peace Corps
volunteers currently registered at
Stanford are being considered for
this part-time paid position. Those
who are interested may contact
Peace Corps representatives today
in the Volunteer Services Center
anytime before 4 p.m.
