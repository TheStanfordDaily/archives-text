# Third World Speaker To Report On U.S. â€“ Iran Relations, Demonstrations
## 
### 
"The demonstration, the pigs,
the Shah, Iran, American
Imperialism in Iran. . are
problems bothering Ferwz Pejhan
and other Iranian students.
Pejhan, a Berkeley student and
member of the Iranian Student
Association (ISA) of Northern
California, will explain these
problems in Rinconada Lounge,
Wilbur, at 8 p.m. tonight. His
speech is sponsored by the Third
World Liberation Front.
The demonstration in question
took place in San Francisco on
October 21 when 200 to 300
Iranian students, Pejhan included,

and some SDS members set out to
picket the Iranian Consulate.
After one arrest, several bruises,
and some discussion, the San
Francisco Tactical Squad allowed
the demonstration to continue
across the street. The protest was
set off by the visit of the Shah of
Iran to the United States as a
guest of President Nixon.
Pejhan will speak about many
of the ills of Iran, but primarily
about the man he considers to be
responsible for these ills, the Shah
of Iran. He describes the Shah as
"a puppet out looking for aid to
further imperialistic aims."

Although Iran has been called a
"representative constitutional
monarchy," all power essentially
lies with the Shah. Anything
passed through the two house
system (half of the senate is
directly appointed by the Shah)
must obtain the Shah's seal of
approval.
The present Shah, Mohammed
Reza Pahlevi, has been in power
for 26 years, with the throne
destined for the eldest of his two
sons.
Pejhan denounces not only the
Shah, but also the U.S. for its role
in his government. He states that
the U.S. has its own imperialistic
motives, and when coupled with
those of the Shah, the only result
can be the "exploitation of the
Iranian people."
Russia, Iran's neighbor, is seen
in much the same light as the

U.S., "both having neo-colonistic
policies."
Repression of dissent in Iran
was pointed out in the
demonstration. Execution,
torture, and imprisonment are
reportedly dealt out frequently to
dissenters under the watchful eye
of an organization known as the
Savak, the government's vigilant
watchdog.
Pejhan spoke of one student
who was "arrested at the border
upon return to Iran. He was
dragged off to jail and sentenced
to three years imprisonment" for
hii, participation in protest
activities in Germany.
The solution for Iran, as seen
by Ferwz Pejhan, is to overcome
the imperialism of the Shah's
government, a military
government which Pejhan says
"closely resembles those of Latin
America."
