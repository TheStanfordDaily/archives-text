# Kornberg, Lederberg Get Endowed Chairs
## 
### 
Two Nobel prize-winning
scientists have been named to
endowed professorships at the
University School of Medicine.
They are Dr. Arthur Kornberg,
Emma Pfeiffer Merner Professor
of Biochemistry, and Dr. Joshua
Lederberg, Joesph D. Grant
Professor of Genetics.

The two endowed chairs were
made possible by a gift from the
Gustavus and Louise Pfeiffer
Research Foundation of New
York and a bequest from the
estate of Joseph D. Grant.
"I take particular pleasure in
announcing these two
appointments," Dr. Robert J.
Glaser, vice-president for medical
affairs and dean of the School of
Medicine, said today. "Dr.
Kornberg and Dr. Lederberg are
and will continue to be leaders on
the frontiers of medical
knowledge and understanding in
the basic medical sciences. It is
especially fitting, therefore, that
they should be named to endowed
chairs bearing the distinguished
names of Emma Pfeiffer Merner
and Joseph D. Grant."
Dr. Kornberg received the
Nobel Prize in 1959 for
synthesizing DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid), the
genetic material believed to
determine the heredity of all
living things. Dr. Lederberg was
awarded the Nobel Prize in 1958
for his work in bacterial genetics.

Emma Louise Pfeiffer was born
in Cedar Falls, lowa in 1860 and
lived there for 63 years. After the
death of her husband, David C.
Merner, a pharmacist, she moved
to California to be with her family
in Palo Alto. Her brother,
Gustavus, and his wife established
the Pfeiffer Research Foundation
of New York 27 years ago.
