# Sunday Rally To Plan Vietnam Moratorium
## 
### 
Stanford organizers of the
Vietnam Moratorium are focusing
on Sunday night's community
meeting . as the organizational
rallying point for the November
Moratorium. The meeting, slated
for 7:30 p.m. in Memorial
Church, will discuss the direction
and the activities of next month's
war protest.
Chairman John Kramer also
hopes the meeting will provide
impetus to the movement by
continuing to generate "the spirit
of community which has been so
important to the Moratorium."
Everyone will be allowed to
vote on the propositions and
resolutions considered, including
whether the main focus of the
Moratorium should be on
canvassing, marches, picketing in
the Industrial Park, etc.
Another Moratorium
Committee project—the four-page
tabloid, Peacemonger, bowed this
morning.
The first issue of the
publication, termed "A Forum for
the Vietnam Moratorium," is
devoted to the Oct. 15
Moratorium's political
significance.
The first issue of the planned
tri-weekly paper includes editorial
statements urging a strike against
Stanford and Industrial Park war
contractors, the development of
counter-institutions as a strategy
for overcoming citizenship
apathy, and involvement in he
electoral process for candidates
who support immediate
withdrawal and an end to
American imperalism abroad.
The Pcacemonger notes it is not
the official voice of the
Moratorium—a reflection of the
coalition politics of the
organization and a desire to keep
decision-making decentralized and
community-wide.
Included in the agenda of
Sunday night's organizational
rally are:
A report on the nation-wide
Moratorium by Pat Shea, who has
just returned from a meeting in

Washington with the national
organizers;
A vote to reaffirm the
Moratorium's goal of an
immediate, timetabled withdrawal
of all U.S. troops;
An explanation of what is being
planned for the November protest
by community leaders, including
Douglas Mattern, presently
organizing a community
noon-hour march on Stanford
Industrial Park Nov. 14;
Voting on a resolution by Mark
Weiss that the Stanford group
would not lend official support or
endorsement to any political
organization or candidate;
Discussion on activities before
the Nov. 13 and 14 Moratorium,
including 120 discussion groups
throughout the community on
Nov. 3, the night of President
Nixon's nation-wide television
address;
Discussion of the specific
Moratorium activities, with
specific action proposals to be
mimeographed and distributed to
participants at Sunday's meeting.
Kramer said anyone with specific
ideas for the Moratorium should
attend a meeting at 1 p.m.
Saturday in the ASSU office.

Those who attend the Sunday
meeting will also learn about the
San Francisco peace march
organized for Nov. 15 by the
Student Mobilization Committee.
The massive demonstration will
culminate in a rally at the Polo
Grounds in Golden State Park,
with speeches by Senator Wayne
Morse and Dr. Ralph Abernathy.
Kramer is enthusiastic about
the prospects of the November
Moratorium, and is looking
forward to a large turnout at
Memorial Church Sunday night.
He told the Daily yesterday the
Moratorium has placed the names
of 2,000 community members
who have expressed a willingness
to work for the Moratorium on
computer cards. They will be
receiving various mailings in the
next two weeks to keep them
informed of what is happening,
and what they can do to help.
He also said that there are plans
to open up a Moratorium booth
not only in White Plaza, but also
in two or three of the major
shopping centers in the area. The
booths will probably open after
Nov. 3.
