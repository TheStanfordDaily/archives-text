# Committee Compiling Listing Of Firms Doing Social Work
## 
### 
Social work with private
industry as the vehicle is the goal
of a recently established student
group known as "Socially
Concerned Industrial Placement,"
or "SCIP."
Student workers for SCIP will
compile a listing of companies
with openings in particular fields
such as pollution control, urban
development, education, and the

like and will publicize these
openings at the Placement Office
and elsewhere. Graduates with
social concerns can thus be
steered towards employers with
active interests in solving social
problems.
The existance of the program
will also serve notice that many
Stanford graduates want their
talents to be used for social
improvement in some area of
need. Similar attempts at
communication have sprung up
independently in the last few
weeks in the Stanford Business
and Law Schools.
This quarter, SCEP is sponsoring
a student workshop as part of the
Student Workshops on Political
and Social Issues (SWOPSI). The
workshop meets on Tuesdays at
4:15 p.m. in Undergraduate
Library Room 146, and is open to
all.

Last summer, as a first step in
collecting information for SCIP's
job listing, the Placement Service
sent out questionnaires to a
representative sample of
companies which interview here.
To gather more information,
concerned students who are
interviewed by companies on
campus will be asked to fill out a
short question. The information
from this will be utilized by SCIP
in locating sympathetic business
concerns. Question sheets and
return boxes are provided at the
Placement Service desk.
Ideas and suggestions from
interested people are welcome.
Any questions or suggestions
should be directed to SCIP via the
ASSU Office or the Placement
Service, or to Ben Segal or Gregg
Dixon at ext. 2564.
