# Children's Clinic Provides Day Care
## 
### SUSAN MAAS 
A boy of about ten greets
visitors with a hug and a smiling
"Hello!" In the music room,
children are trying to sing, "Look
at pretty Mary," as adult helpers
point toward the girl, who is
looking rather aimlessly around
the room.
"To get these children to the
point where they can go on to
special classes in public school" is
the goal of the Peninsula
Children's Center (PCC), states
the program coordinator, Mrs.
Gail Switzer.
P.C.C., located in Palo Alto, is a
center for emotionally disturbed
children of the area. It was
originally set up as a "last resort"
for parents who wanted to keep
their children at home, but
needed a place to send them
during the day.
The children range in age from
three to sixteen, although most
are from seven to twelve.
Most of them are unable to
communicate intelligently with
other people. According to Mrs.
Switzer, their problems are most
likely caused by birth defects
resulting in perceptional
difficulty.
Special therapists and
teachers, as well as volunteers,
work with the children. Ideally,
there would be a one-to-one ratio
of volunteers to children, but such
is not now the case.
Dwindling Volunteers
The number of Stanford
volunteers, once great, has
dwindled to one. Mrs. Switzer, in

charge of volunteers, comments,
"We really miss them, especially
the men."
Twenty children are now at the
center, but plans are to expand to
25 by Christmas, and 30 next
year.
Most of the children have
difficulty relating to people. The
songs they sing are designed to
help them gain an awareness of
themselves and others.
In art class, the children are
preparing for Halloween. "This is
an Indian head band," the art
therapist comments, holding up a
strip of brightly-painted cloth. On
the counter is the beginning of a
large paper mac he pumpkin.
Unofficial Staff Members
In the playground, an older boy
is sitting silently on top of the
slide. Stella, the music therapist's
dog and an unofficial member of
the staff, wanders around, visiting
her friends.
"No child is too badly
disturbed to get in here," states
Mrs. Switzer. "If anything, they
might be too well, in which case,
we refer them to someplace else."
Once admitted, each child is
given a special program suited to
his needs. The program consists of
both individual and group
activities, including art, music,
physical education, free play, and
school for five of the older boys.
The center was more closely
affiliated with Stanford until the
beginning of July, when it moved
to its new location. It is supported
by parent fees and by
contributions by groups and
individuals.

during the day.
The children range in age from
three to sixteen, although most
are from seven to twelve.
Most of them are unable to
communicate intelligently with
other people. According to Mrs.
Switzer, their problems are most
likely caused by birth defects
resulting in perceptional
difficulty.
Special therapists and
teachers, as well as volunteers,
work with the children. Ideally,
there would be a one-to-one ratio
of volunteers to children, but such
is not now the case.
Dwindling Volunteers
The number of Stanford
volunteers, once great, has
dwindled to one. Mrs. Switzer, in

charge of volunteers, comments,
"We really miss them, especially
the men."
Twenty children are now at the
center, but plans are to expand to
25 by Christmas, and 30 next
year.
Most of the children have
difficulty relating to people. The
songs they sing are designed to
help them gain an awareness of
themselves and others.
In art class, the children are
preparing for Halloween. "This is
an Indian head band," the art
therapist comments, holding up a
strip of brightly-painted cloth. On
the counter is the beginning of a
large paper mac he pumpkin.
Unofficial Staff Members
In the playground, an older boy
is sitting silently on top of the
slide. Stella, the music therapist's
dog and an unofficial member of
the staff, wanders around, visiting
her friends.
"No child is too badly
disturbed to get in here," states
Mrs. Switzer. "If anything, they
might be too well, in which case,
we refer them to someplace else."
Once admitted, each child is
given a special program suited to
his needs. The program consists of
both individual and group
activities, including art, music,
physical education, free play, and
school for five of the older boys.
The center was more closely
affiliated with Stanford until the
beginning of July, when it moved
to its new location. It is supported
by parent fees and by
contributions by groups and
individuals.
A boy of about ten greets
visitors with a hug and a smiling
"Hello!" In the music room,
children are trying to sing, "Look
at pretty Mary," as adult helpers
point toward the girl, who is
looking rather aimlessly around
the room.
"To get these children to the
point where they can go on to
special classes in public school" is
the goal of the Peninsula
Children's Center (PCC), states
the program coordinator, Mrs.
Gail Switzer.
P.C.C., located in Palo Alto, is a
center for emotionally disturbed
children of the area. It was
originally set up as a "last resort"
for parents who wanted to keep
their children at home, but
needed a place to send them
during the day.
