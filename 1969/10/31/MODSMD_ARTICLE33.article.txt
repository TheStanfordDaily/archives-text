# Beware Of Salesmen
## 
### 
Joseph Ostle, president of the
Better Business Bureau of the
Santa Clara Valley, has a warning
for Stanford students who are
approached by solicitors for
magazine subscriptions.
Ostle told The Daily yesterday
that the Universal Readers
Service, which has been selling
subscriptions door-to-door in
University residences, is not a
member of the Central Registry in
New York, an organization which
guarantees the delivery of
magazines.
University regulations do not
permit solicitation in the
dormitories. In addition, the Palo
Alto police say that no license has
been issued to this firm.
