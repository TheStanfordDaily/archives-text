# Tribe Starts Last Trip
## 
### FRED MANN 
At 8:15 a.m. this morning, the
Stanford football team departs for
their second and last road trip of
the year. The first stop on this
jaunt is Corvallis, Oregon
(followed by Seattle next week),
and this working vacation should
be happier than the last.
In their only other away games,
a back-to-back pair with Purdue
and USC, the Indians saw their
season blown out the window.
The two now-famous defeats were
enough to make anyone
homesicK.
The Tribe recovered and
clobbered Washington State, 49-0,
at home, and then tied UCLA just
last week. Now they again venture
into hostile territory looking for a
win. But this trip is different. The
pressure is off, the crowds
couldn't possibly be as vocal, and
the competition is not as tough.
Tribe Favored
Washington has yet to win a
football game (0-6), and Oregon
State is only 1-2 against league
foes. In tomorrow's contest,
Stanford is favored by 8 or 13
points, depending upon who
handles your action.
The OSU squad could hardly be
termed explosive—the term that
PR men from all over the country
have stuck on the Indians. In
Stanford's three non-winning
efforts, they have scored 79
points, and only five more would
make them 6-0, in the Rose Bowl,

and ranked well within the top
five in the country.
Beavers Outclassed
The Beavers on the other hand
have scored only 10 points in
their three losses, and were
outclassed in defeat. In preparing
for Stanford, OSU may have even
more troubles than usual. Their
two offensive mainstays, running
back Billy Main and quarterback
Steve Endicott are both down
with injuries, and questionable
starters tomorrow.
Main Threat
Last year, Main ran up 126
yards against Stanford, and his
now-graduated running mate Bill
Enyart rolled to 164 yards in he
worst beating the Tribe got all
year. The Beavers took the mud
bowl, 29-7.
Again this week, Coach John
Ralston's varsity is a question
mark. Three traumatic setbacks
have hurt them so far, and still
they have never let down. It just
doesn't seem natural.
Perhaps Stanford is due for a
disasterous game this time around.
As they found against San Jose
State, it is often harder to get up
for a mediocre team; and never
having won on the road all year
may have a psychological effect.

As an athletic department
spokesman said, either Stanford
will win, 35-0, or lose 14-0.
Still, it is hard to imagine the
Tribe, or anybody for that matter,
losing to Oregon State. They have
played the same kind of hard luck
football that the Indians have, but
their defeats have been against
lesser competition. When facing
USC and UCLA, the Beavers were
outscored, 68-7.
The Tribe is healthy once again.
It has been a lucky season at least
in that respect for Ralston's club.
All-America nominee Bob
Reinhard strained his kicking knee
in practice Wednesday, but is
expected to start tomorrow.
Knee Hampers Moore
Another All-America candidate,
tight end Bob Moore is still
bothered by a bad knee, and both
Dave Sharp and Mike Ewing are
recovering from injuries suffered
against UCLA. All should see
action in Corvallis.
"I'm happy with the team's
progress throughout the year,"
said Coach Ralston. "It's been a
tough road, but they've never
given up. And they won't start
now."
Place your money on the
Indians.

said Coach Ralston. "It's been a
tough road, but they've never
given up. And they won't start
now."
Place your money on the
Indians.


KELLER THE KlLLER—Stanford defensive back Kick Keller stops a UCLA
drive, picking off a Dunimit pass. Jini Kauffman trails the play. Keller has
intercepted three passes this year, and has returned theni for 62 yards, including
a touchdown against Washington State.
At 8:15 a.m. this morning, the
Stanford football team departs for
their second and last road trip of
the year. The first stop on this
jaunt is Corvallis, Oregon
(followed by Seattle next week),
and this working vacation should
be happier than the last.
In their only other away games,
a back-to-back pair with Purdue
and USC, the Indians saw their
season blown out the window.
The two now-famous defeats were
enough to make anyone
homesicK.
The Tribe recovered and
clobbered Washington State, 49-0,
at home, and then tied UCLA just
last week. Now they again venture
into hostile territory looking for a
win. But this trip is different. The
pressure is off, the crowds
couldn't possibly be as vocal, and
the competition is not as tough.
Tribe Favored
Washington has yet to win a
football game (0-6), and Oregon
State is only 1-2 against league
foes. In tomorrow's contest,
Stanford is favored by 8 or 13
points, depending upon who
handles your action.
The OSU squad could hardly be
termed explosive—the term that
PR men from all over the country
have stuck on the Indians. In
Stanford's three non-winning
efforts, they have scored 79
points, and only five more would
make them 6-0, in the Rose Bowl,

and ranked well within the top
five in the country.
Beavers Outclassed
The Beavers on the other hand
have scored only 10 points in
their three losses, and were
outclassed in defeat. In preparing
for Stanford, OSU may have even
more troubles than usual. Their
two offensive mainstays, running
back Billy Main and quarterback
Steve Endicott are both down
with injuries, and questionable
starters tomorrow.
Main Threat
Last year, Main ran up 126
yards against Stanford, and his
now-graduated running mate Bill
Enyart rolled to 164 yards in he
worst beating the Tribe got all
year. The Beavers took the mud
bowl, 29-7.
Again this week, Coach John
Ralston's varsity is a question
mark. Three traumatic setbacks
have hurt them so far, and still
they have never let down. It just
doesn't seem natural.
Perhaps Stanford is due for a
disasterous game this time around.
As they found against San Jose
State, it is often harder to get up
for a mediocre team; and never
having won on the road all year
may have a psychological effect.

As an athletic department
spokesman said, either Stanford
will win, 35-0, or lose 14-0.
Still, it is hard to imagine the
Tribe, or anybody for that matter,
losing to Oregon State. They have
played the same kind of hard luck
football that the Indians have, but
their defeats have been against
lesser competition. When facing
USC and UCLA, the Beavers were
outscored, 68-7.
The Tribe is healthy once again.
It has been a lucky season at least
in that respect for Ralston's club.
All-America nominee Bob
Reinhard strained his kicking knee
in practice Wednesday, but is
expected to start tomorrow.
Knee Hampers Moore
Another All-America candidate,
tight end Bob Moore is still
bothered by a bad knee, and both
Dave Sharp and Mike Ewing are
recovering from injuries suffered
against UCLA. All should see
action in Corvallis.
"I'm happy with the team's
progress throughout the year,"
said Coach Ralston. "It's been a
tough road, but they've never
given up. And they won't start
now."
