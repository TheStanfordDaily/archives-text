# Ghosts For Frosh Gridders?
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
The victory expected from
tonight's frosh football game with
San Jose turned out to be as
hollow as a Halloween
jack-o-lantern when Coach Bill
Moultrie received word that the
Spartans had been forced to
forfeit simply because they
couldn't muster enough players to
put a team on the field.
"Of course we would have liked
to have played San Jose,"
commented Moultrie," but we
have to take advantage of every
adverse situation, and this will
help us better prepare for the big
one with Berkeley."
Scrimmage Slated
The afternoon will be spent in a
game-type scrimmage with the
red-shirts and varsity subs and
films will be taken for player
evaluation purposes.
Moultrie felt that the
cancellation would have little
effect on the players' morale.
"They're all thoroughbreds," he
smiled, "they've learned to take

disappointments in stride. There's
no question about the fact thyt
this was a disappointment for
them. They've responded real well
and have been working hard for
the Cal game."
Balanced Attack
The Papooses expect to go out
and just play solid football against
the Bear Cubs, again going with a
balanced offensive attack and the
philosophy of making California
stop them.
"I definitely feel that if you
worry too much about what
Berkeley is going to do and then
they don't, you've wasted time
that could have been spent on
your own attack. We'll stick with
our game and go from there," said
Moultrie.
UCLA nipped Cal 21-20 in the
fourth quarter of their game, and
then the Cubs ran over San Jose,
35-12. Berkeley hosts USC
tomorrow at 10 a.m. in Memorial
Stadium.
The Indians will be healthy for
the Little Big Game, now only a

week away, as there have been
only two serious injuries this year.
Jim Wise and Norman Kong, both
sustained knee injuries.
Tribe Lucky
"We have been fortunate this
year injury-wise," commented
Coach Moultrie. "I think that the
emphasis on conditioning has
played a major role in the
reduction of pulls and strains. All
of the kids have worked hard in
this area of our program."
"It's been really exciting
heading up the frosh program this
year," concluded the coach.
"We've had just an outstanding
staff of assistant coaches, and it's
been a real pleasure working with
them and with the caliber of kids
who turned out for freshman ball.
"Their enthusiasm and sparkle
and respect for one another as
men has grown tremendously
since October 1. They're just now
reaching their full maturity as a
team and are learning that they
really have to depend on one
another to get the job done.


LOOK OUTâ€”Papoose quarterback Patrick Moore (18) spots an open recei\er in
last week's 21-20 victory over the UCLA frosh. Blocking is Reggie Sanderson
(32) who rushed for 104 yards on 17 carries in the same game. The Tribe frosh
are automatic winners in today's proposed game with San Jose Slate, which is
unable to field a team.
