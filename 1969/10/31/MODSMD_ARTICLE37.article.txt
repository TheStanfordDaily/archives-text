# IM Football
## Phi Delts, Phuds Roll 
### SCOTT BURNS 
The Phi Delts and Dislocations
still predominate IM football. The
Phi Delts won their third game of
the season by crushing the Phi
Sigs, 53-6, and the Phi Sigs are not
considered a pushover team.
The Dislocations scored a 45-6
win over the Second Year Biz
team to win their third as well.
Mike Evans has quarterbacked the
Dislocations' well-drilled offense
to 165 points in three games, and
they look almost as good as the
Phi Delts.
The big game of the week saw
the Phuds (now 3-0) defeat the
Second Year Law team, 12-7. The
Phuds showed a good offense, but
it was their tenacious defense that
won the game.

Their "Big D" stopped the Law
team's offense cold (Law had
scored 71 points in its first game)
with a great rush and a good
defensive secondary.
In other big games the Kappa
Sigs held the tough Zetes' offense
down, but still lost, 7-0. The Betas
showed that they are still in the
running as they upset the Phi
Kapps, 13-7, and the Chi Psi's
handled the Delts, 21-0.
Lagunita and the Panthers also
won their third games and look
like heavy favorites in their
respective leagues.
In "B" football action the
Theta Delt B's, last year's champs,
beat the Bad Omens, 13-12, in a
real thriller. Ross Laybourn made
a fantastic diving catch for the

winning touchdown and also
made two key interceptions to
lead the Thumpty Dumps to
victory.
The Computer Science team
seems to be improving. Even
though it lost its fourth game in a
row (25-6 to Cro Mem), the 25
points it allowed were well below
its average of 48 points allowed
per game. They still have room for
improvement, for they have one
game left.
There are some really big games
coming up. Tomorrow the Med
School team meets the
Dislocations, and the winner
should take the league crown. On
Monday, the SAE's meet Kappa
Alpha and on Wednesday and Phi
Delts play the Phi Kapps. The
biggest game next week, though,
will be the Sigma Chi-Zete game
on Tuesday.
In other IM news, the
Intramural Advisory Council has
been selected, and in coordination
with Dutch Fehring, these
students will make the major
decisions for intramurals. They
are Rocky Rodriquenz (dorms),
John Chang (grads), Mark Wells
(clubs), Paul Ormond (frats), Mike
Fuller (BSU), and Alan Bell
(independents).

handled the Delts, 21-0.
Lagunita and the Panthers also
won their third games and look
like heavy favorites in their
respective leagues.
In "B" football action the
Theta Delt B's, last year's champs,
beat the Bad Omens, 13-12, in a
real thriller. Ross Laybourn made
a fantastic diving catch for the

winning touchdown and also
made two key interceptions to
lead the Thumpty Dumps to
victory.
The Computer Science team
seems to be improving. Even
though it lost its fourth game in a
row (25-6 to Cro Mem), the 25
points it allowed were well below
its average of 48 points allowed
per game. They still have room for
improvement, for they have one
game left.
There are some really big games
coming up. Tomorrow the Med
School team meets the
Dislocations, and the winner
should take the league crown. On
Monday, the SAE's meet Kappa
Alpha and on Wednesday and Phi
Delts play the Phi Kapps. The
biggest game next week, though,
will be the Sigma Chi-Zete game
on Tuesday.
In other IM news, the
Intramural Advisory Council has
been selected, and in coordination
with Dutch Fehring, these
students will make the major
decisions for intramurals. They
are Rocky Rodriquenz (dorms),
John Chang (grads), Mark Wells
(clubs), Paul Ormond (frats), Mike
Fuller (BSU), and Alan Bell
(independents).
The Phi Delts and Dislocations
still predominate IM football. The
Phi Delts won their third game of
the season by crushing the Phi
Sigs, 53-6, and the Phi Sigs are not
considered a pushover team.
The Dislocations scored a 45-6
win over the Second Year Biz
team to win their third as well.
Mike Evans has quarterbacked the
Dislocations' well-drilled offense
to 165 points in three games, and
they look almost as good as the
Phi Delts.
The big game of the week saw
the Phuds (now 3-0) defeat the
Second Year Law team, 12-7. The
Phuds showed a good offense, but
it was their tenacious defense that
won the game.

Their "Big D" stopped the Law
team's offense cold (Law had
scored 71 points in its first game)
with a great rush and a good
defensive secondary.
In other big games the Kappa
Sigs held the tough Zetes' offense
down, but still lost, 7-0. The Betas
showed that they are still in the
running as they upset the Phi
Kapps, 13-7, and the Chi Psi's
handled the Delts, 21-0.
Lagunita and the Panthers also
won their third games and look
like heavy favorites in their
