# Poloist Plan For League Win Today
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
An undermanned Stanford
water polo team will try to get
back into the league race when
they take on USC today at 3:OC
p.m. in Encina Pool. The Indians
9-4 overall but 0-2 in their tough
league will try to comeback from
last weekend's loss to league
leader UCLA.
The Indians played valiantly in
their 10-5 loss to UCLA, but the
veteran Bruins finally wore down
the inexperienced and nervous
Indians. Rick Massimino and Pete
Gadd played well as usual and the
performance of the
sophomore-dominated team gave
hope for an outstanding team in
the years ahead. The Indians
could still salvage a berth in the
NCAA tournament by finishing
second in the league, and today's
game will go a long way in
determining that possibility.
The Indians, who have already
lost Wayne Wilson for the rest of
the season with a broken nose,

and Ray Collins for a couple of
weeks with a broken eardrum,
came up with more injuries this
week. Against UCLA, Rob Jensen
suffered a gash which required six
stitches and he is doubtful for this
weekend's contests. Veterans
Kevin Eagleston and Tom Hill
have not worked out all week, but
they should be able to see action
today.
USC is led by high scoring Jerry
Norris and a couple of extremely
fast sprinters. Stanford saw the
Trojans in the UC Irvine
Tournament, but they were in
different brackets and did not
meet. In their last game against
UCLA, the Trojans lost by only
two and they are expected to give
Stanford a stiff test.
After the USC game, the
Indians travel to Stockton
tomorrow for a game against a not
too strong UOP team whom the
Indians beat 11-4 earlier this year
in the Northern California
Invitational Tournament.
