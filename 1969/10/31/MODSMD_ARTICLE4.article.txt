# Bomb Hoax Alarms Stanford Firemen
## 
### 
A bomb hoax called the
Stanford Fire Department to the
heavily traveled Willow Road
bridge across San Francisquito
Creek yesterday afternoon.
At 4:21 p.m. a "muffled,
young-sounding male" voice on
the telephone alerted the firemen,
and at 4:43 Assistant Chief .John
W. Barr removed the device from
a steel beam beneath the bridge
and disarmed it.

Barr said the device could not
have exploded because the three
sticks of dynamite were only
"simulated" tubes stuffed with
dirt. "The rest of it was okay,
though," he added.
Barr turned the device over to
the Stanford Police, who sent it
on to the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Department.
