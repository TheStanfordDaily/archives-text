# Purloined Documents
## Salary Discussion Opened 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
During the four days since
highly confidential salaries were
disclosed, those most concerned
with the documents, the
professors, have shown themselves
to be perhaps the least perturbed
of any group.
Surrounded by strident
administrative threats on one
hand and angry, bewildered
student questioning on the other,
Stanford faculty opened some
candid discussion of the complex
problems inherent in determining
professorial salaries. Such
discussion couuld well lead the
University towards establishing
uniformity in base level salaries
throughout University
departments.
Debate over the advisability of
a move toward a classification
-scaling of salaries has continued
for several years with few
significant results. Alternative
measures for reducing inequalities
in the salary scale have not
received support equal to that for
a move toward base-level
uniformity.
"I do think there's a general
faculty desire for some sort of
[publicized] categorization," said
sociology professor Sanford
Dornbusch.

salary discrepencies is that
between the humanities and the
scientific disciplines. Approximate
median figures taken from the
'liberated' document released on
Monday indicate there is valid
cause for concern—full professors
in the humanities receive
approximately $1,700 less, on the
average, than full professors in the
sciences.
A table published in David G.
Brown's The Mobile Professor.
(1967) points up the obvious and
chief reason for this
discrepancy—the current high
prestige of and high premium on
professors of the sciences and
technical fields.
Four of the five disciplines in
greatest demand fall into this
category. These are: electrical
engineering, mechanical
engineering, mathematics, and
physics. Economics, the
highest-ranking humanistic field,
; s sixth.
Slep-R ale Scale
Some have suggested a step-rate
scale, which prescribes minimum
and maximum salaries for several
levels of achievement. Would
implementation of such a scale or
of a standard base-level salary help

resolve the inequities which
'market' demand helps create?
Quite possibly. Fixed base-level
salaries would help eliminate some
glaring inequities—the differential
in starting salaries of young,
unproven professors, for instance.
Extending strict salary
classifications to all levels,
however, would lead to
considerable difficulties.
One arguement raised against
such extensive classification by
philosophy professor Philip
Rhinelander was that it would
lead to complacency. "It could
cause people to advance on the
basis on seniority, not of work,"
Rhinelander said.
Differentials in the salaries of
'research-oriented' and
'teaching-oriented' professors are
far harder to identify, since nnlv a

tiny number of faculty are not
engaged in both pursuits.
Figures on the teaching-loads of
professors whose salaries could be
documented were not available at
the time of this writing, therefore,
only tenuous conclusions could be
drawn from the salary documents.
It is interesting to note,
however, that the Stanford
psychology department, ranked
highest in graduate teaching in its
field by the American Council on
Education in 1966 was also the
origin of the following 1967
salary evaluations: a
recommendation for a salary raise
of $1,000 for a professor
"because he is one of our most
effective graduate and
undergraduate teachers"; or a
recommendation for a comparable
raise for a professor, "one of our

outstanding undergr duate
teachers."
Complex Issues
There are, of course, far more
complex issues underlying the
question of the inflated emphasis
weighted salary scales put on
certain disciplines. The most
compelling arguements for
balancing these scales without
severely weakening individual
departments would point toward
establishment of some base-level
scale.
Perhaps, after the shower of
sparks that have fallen in the past
.'ew days thins out, purposeful
discussion of the problems will
lead to a fairier allocation of
rewards—at least of those rewards
than can be counted.

between the humanities and the

median figures taken from the
'liberated' document released on

in the humanities receive
approximately $1,700 less, on the
average, than full professors in the
sciences.
A table published in David G.

(1967) points up the obvious and
chief reason for this
discrepancy—the current high

Slep-R ale Scale
Some have suggested a step-rate
scale, which prescribes minimum
and maximum salaries for several
levels of achievement. Would
implementation of such a scale or
of a standard base-level salary help

resolve the inequities which
'market' demand helps create?
Quite possibly. Fixed base-level
salaries would help eliminate some
glaring inequities—the differential
in starting salaries of young,
unproven professors, for instance.
Extending strict salary
classifications to all levels,
however, would lead to
considerable difficulties.
One arguement raised against
such extensive classification by
philosophy professor Philip
Rhinelander was that it would
lead to complacency. "It could
cause people to advance on the
basis on seniority, not of work,"
Rhinelander said.
Differentials in the salaries of
'research-oriented' and
'teaching-oriented' professors are
far harder to identify, since nnlv a

tiny number of faculty are not
engaged in both pursuits.
Figures on the teaching-loads of
professors whose salaries could be
documented were not available at
the time of this writing, therefore,
only tenuous conclusions could be
drawn from the salary documents.
It is interesting to note,
however, that the Stanford
psychology department, ranked
highest in graduate teaching in its
field by the American Council on
Education in 1966 was also the
origin of the following 1967
salary evaluations: a
recommendation for a salary raise
of $1,000 for a professor
"because he is one of our most
effective graduate and
undergraduate teachers"; or a
recommendation for a comparable
raise for a professor, "one of our
