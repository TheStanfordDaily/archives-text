# No Rose Garden
## Zionist Pressure 
### Ali M. Sbeta 
There were many statements in
the articles under the title
"Zionism=Jews=Humans" which
appeared in Wednesday's Daily
that looked like facts for people
who do not know much about the
Middle East. Actually these
statements are false and I do not
go too far when I say that some of
them are lies.
The first statement was "Arabs
in Israel are full citizens." In
response to this I want to quote
what the Israeli minister of
information said about the topic
in his speech at the United
Kibbutz Conference: "We do not
consider the Arabs of the land an
ethnic group nor a people with
distinct nationalistic character."
Without any comment this is what
Israeli officials believe. This denies
the fact that Arabs are full
citizens and suggests that they are
unimportant natives with no
identity or rights.
The second statement was
"when driving through Arab
villages there is a new modern
school building in every one." It is
correct that some school buildings
are new in some villages but I
really pity the authors if they
concluded from what they saw
during their drive means a good
educational system in those Arab
villages. Actually educational
standards in the Arab schools are
extremely low in comparison not
only with Jewish schools in Israel
but also with present standards all
over the Middle East. Reasons
being (other than shortage of
buildings and equipment) books,
professional teachers and curricula
which keeps changing according
to what the Israeli government
wants.
According to Israel government
sources almost 50% of all teachers
in Arab schools are below proper
standards while less than 25% of
teachers in Jewish schools fall in
that category. In addition to this
there is an imposed subject matter
to teach in all schools, Arab and
Jewish, especially the Old
Testament and subjects dealing
with Jewish history and culture,
and the Arab student is deprived
of many chapters of Arab history
which do not suit Israel.
Mayor Expelled
The third statement was about
10,000 people entering the West
Bank of Jordan to visit their
families. Usually these visits do
not exceed one or two weeks. The
writers of the article forgot to
mention that there are more than
10,000 people expelled from the
West Bank of Jordan, among them
are hundreds of Arab leaders who
disagree with Israel authorities for
one reason or another. Among
these was the Mayor of Jerusalem
and an important Moslem
religious leader.
Next comes the statement that
"Arabs were so eager to establish

an Arab state in Palestine that
they willingly sold land to the
Jews." A look at the facts shows
that the Jews owned only 5.67%
of the land in Palestine up to May,
1948. In the same year the
Palestine government informed
the U.N. Special Committee for
Palestine which visited Palestine
to try to look for a settlement to
the Palestinian problem, that
"Jews held 15% of the cultivable
area of Palestine." This fact alone
that Jews up to 1948 had only
15% of the cultivable land is
enough to explode the myth that
the Jews have turned the desert
swampy Palestine into a rose
garden when all they own is 15%
of the cultivable land.
Up till now all the material
presented are mere facts that one
can get form authorized
references in the Hoover Library.
Jewish Stale
Zionism promised the Jews a
national revival in Palestine of an
exclusive Jewish state. Jews from
all the world could immigrate and
settle in such a state. This is a fact
admitted by Israeli authorities.
Whereas the populations (Jews) in
Palestine in 1948 was 800,000, it
was 2,800,000 in 1967. More than
2/3 of the increase came from
immigration. This continuous
process is done at the expense of
the poor Arabs who have to be
pushed out to the nearest border
in order to provide room for the
coming immigrant. So as long as
the goals of Zionism are pursued
in Israel there will be no peace in
the Middle East. The natural thing
for the Jew who wants to live
with the Arab in one country is to
resist Zionist pressures.
