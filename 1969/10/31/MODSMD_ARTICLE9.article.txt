SWOPSI what?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Yesterday's Daily article
entitled "Joyce, Woman at the
Top" (my ethnic background
leads me to the conclusion that
this title might be a case of yellow
journalism) confused two
educational programs with which
I've been associated: SWOPSI and
the Student Center for Innovation
in Research and Education.
Because they are relatively new,
and because their success depends

on student participation and
interest. I would like to
differentiate them here briefly.
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops
on Political and Social fesues),
primarily organized by Robert
Jaffe, Joel Primack and myself,
are a group of 10 Undergraduate
Specials offered this fall which are
directed toward problems of
social concern and to the
elaboration of possible solutions
of those problems. They go
beyond a problem-orientation and
social "relevance" to exploring
the possibilities of social change
and programs of action.
A proposal for the Student
Center is being considered at
present by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, and if it is
approved, we hope to have it
ready to function by winter
quarter. The Center would have a
staff of a part-time director, an
administrative assistant and
secretary who would be available
to help put students in contact
with interested faculty members,
draft proposals, and generally help
to decrease the peripheral,
procedural obstacles that face
students wishing to bring about
educational change.

"Tell it like it is"
Editor, THE DAILY:
Why don't you tell it like it is,
and not identify Lennie Siegel
incorrectly, as with today's article
by him? He is not listed as a
registered student on official
records. Instead, he apparently
devotes full-time to attempts to
radicalize students . . .

Rambling "Ug/i"s
Editor, THE DAILY:
I was quite surprised to see a
column like Ed Kohn's of Oct. 28
appear in the Daily. The letter
seems to be a criticism of the Oct.
23 edition of Arena, but it's hard

to be really certain of this. In
some 400 words Ed fails to come
to terms with a single idea in any
of the articles. Instead we have
what Chris Hocker, in an adjacent
article on the same day, called "a
personal pout in the Daily." Ed
just kinda rambles along, very
wordily, and every once in a while
a vague characterization or
sterotype peeks out at you. The
article as a whole is a sort of
prolonged "ugh!" This may be an
eloquent expression of Ed's
reaction (ug, or thoughts), but it
is hardly coherent enough to
qualify for our Daily.
There are a few tendencies in
his rambling that resemble ideas.
These exhibit, if anything,
stereotyped thinking. Those of
you who think that Stanford is a
place to have your perspectives
broadened and your mind freed
should take note. Ed seems to be
disturbed that there are some
among us who don't buy the
party line. Real deviates.
Better look out Ed, baby.
Things are really getting out of
hand. Next thing you know one
of us is gonna want to take your
sister out.

"Amicus Curiae"ad nauseum
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am grateful to the Daily that
it has informed the Stanford
community about the Amicus
Curiae brief filed by the American
Civil Liberties Union of Northern
California in support of my legal
action against the Secretary of the
Army, Mr. Stanley Resor.
With your permission, I want to
illustrate the senseless and
unjustifiable overclassification of
historically as well as politically
meaningless, purely administrative
documents.
Among the four documents
declassified by the Secretary of
the Army after the latest review
of the "Operation Keelhaul"
dossier is the following:

". . .ALCOM is unable to
furnish interpreters at Separation
Points or any person who will be
able to identify individuals
wanted imperative that individuals
qualified to perform the above
mentioned duties in order that
mission may be accomplished."
This document, in its rather
awkward language, was four times
stamped "Top Secret." It also
shows the printed notation: "The
making of an exact copy of this
message is forbidden." The
document is dated: "3 August
1946." Since that day, its Top
Secret classification continued for
more than twenty-three years.
Several reviews of the "Operation
Keelhaul" file resulted in as many
denials of its declassification for
reasons of "foreign policy and
national defense." It was classified
a few weeks ago and released to
me.
Such procedure allows the
historian to draw certain
conclusions concerning the
Pentagon's custom to overclassify
documents. Interestingly, the
administration saw fit in 1955 to
declassify most of the Yalta
documents and in 1961 those
concerning the Teheran
Conference. In 1967, the
Department of State even
declassified most embarrassing
documentary evidence about
President F.D. Roosevelt's policy
of "Acquiescence of his
Government in the Murder of the
Jews."

Poor Taste
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your "Message to the Zodiac
Killer" in my opinion is a stupid
and tasteless statement. I had
come to expect more sense and
maturity from Stanford students.
Satire is a legitimate form of
social comment, but in my
opinion, inappropriate when
applied to mentally twisted and
distorted individuals.
This sort of callous insensitivity
surprises and distresses me on the
Stanford campus.
