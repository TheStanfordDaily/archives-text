Good music, of course. Realism that makes you think it's
I good as live—or betterl
But, besides that good music, you want assurance of two
things when you buy:
One, that you didn't get taken—that you paid a fair price
for your equipment, with all the discounts anyone else could
get, anywhere.
And two, that you bought from a reliable dealer who will
stand back of the equipment if anything should go wrong—
who will put himself out to make sure you get the satisfaction
ypu paid for.
That's why more and more people buy from Lafayette—
where the VALUES (what you get for what you pay) are best
and the after-sales service is everything you could wish.
