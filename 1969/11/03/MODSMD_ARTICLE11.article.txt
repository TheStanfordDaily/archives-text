### 
Just One Meal
Editor, THE DAILY:
We, the employees of Tresidder
Memorial Union, are petitioning
the management for the
improvement of our working
conditions. Specifically, we are
asking that one meal per working
day be served all employees of
TMU.
Stanford's salaries are small,
especially when put in the context
of the inflated Bay Area cost of
living. For a non-specialized foot
service employee, the beginning
salary is a meager $1.90 an hour.
Even at the normal rate of salary
advancement, the worker's annual
income is below $4,000. Many
employees are forced to work
long hours overtime, or must take
on full or part time jobs to
supplement their incomes.
President Pitzer finally
recognized the need for a
guaranteed minimum wage for
full-time Stanford employees, and
as of December 1, this wage will
be set at $400 a month or only
$4,800 per year. This is still not
enough to support a family
comfortably and extra jobs will
still be necessary.
Most of the full-time workers
are forced to commute daily from
as far away as San Jose and
Sunnyvale. This is a result of the
general scarcity of low-cost
housing in the Palo Alto area. To
compound the problem, these
TMU employees face extra
mileage and larger gas bills.

The student employee's salary
is also low. The Stanford student
has a starting salary of $1.65. San
Jose starts at $1.97, Berkeley at
$2.07.
One free meal per working day
would obviously be an
inexpensive way for Tresidder to
begin remedying the problems of
its employees.
We hope that the entire
Stanford community will support
our request.

Tresidder Employees
Chained and Gagged
Editor, THE DAILY:
Bobby Seale, Chairman of the
Black Panther Party, has been
chained to a chair and gagged. He
insisted on cross-examining a
police agent who had testified
against him. For six weeks he has
been on trial without his lawyer.
The Judge chose a lawyer for him
but refused to let him defend
himself. This Black man is
defending himself against racist,
railroad justice. In trying to
exercise his constitutional rights
to due process and equality under
the law he is defending you and
me.
Many have assumed that these
blatant judicial errors will be
corrected on appeal. But the
purpose of this trial is not justice
but jail and the victims will be
jailed even if the cost is the
credibility of our courts. Years in
jail without bail during the appeal
period will serve the purpose as it
has in Huey P. Newton's case. All
who cherish justice, oppose terror,
fascism and racism must demand
that this trial be stopped. Mistrial!
Defend yourself! A rally to
support this demand will be held
at noon today, Monday, Nov. 3, in
front of the Feneral Building at
Golden Gate and Larkin in San
Francisco. Car pools will leave at
11:00 am and again at 12:00 am
from Tresidder parking lot.

Shortsighted
Editor, THE DAILY:
Yesterday's letter about
insufficient parking is very
shortsighted. There is something
A 1 Pick and Martin Eichner can do
in place of hassling the cops and
the courts about so trivial a
problem. They can hitchhike,
carpool, or ride bikes.
A look at the planning office's
land use projections shows that a
huge area to both sides of Palm
Drive and around the oval may
soon be paved over for parking
spaces. The planning office
justifies such conversion of grass
to pavement on the grounds that
cars and parking spaces are what
the people want.
About 50% of the Stanford
off-campus population lives
within three miles of the campus.

If they would give up their cars or
carry more passengers in them,
there would be no need for
additional parking spaces for
many years.
John Cady
Giant L A.
Editor, THE DAILY:
The letter in Friday's Daily by
Messers. Pick and Eichner includes
the allegation that there is
"parking for only a small
percentage of off-campus vehicles
within walking distance of the
Quad." For over two years, I have
parked my car in a large lot south
of the Comp Center, a lot that is
never even half full. Admittedly, I
have to walk about a block to get
to Quad, but to me the advantages
of exercise, unhurried choice of
parking space, and retention of
$10 that would otherwise have

purchased a parking sticker are
enjoyable alternatives to fighting
for a space in crowded lots and
having my car plastered by
myopic drivers.
I regrei that supposedly
able-bodies and able-minded
students would apparently rather
see Stanford paved over into a
giant L.A.-type wasteland than
preserve the few remaining acres
of grass and trees close to Quad.
The five minutes it takes Pick and
Eichner to dream up cleaver legal
maneuvers might be better spent
walking and contemplating the
many other universities that
simply do not provide any parking
space for students. What is their
definition of acceptable "walking
distance to Quad?" Ten feet?
