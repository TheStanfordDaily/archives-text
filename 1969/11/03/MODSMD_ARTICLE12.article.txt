## Gene Damage 
### Joshua Lederberg 
Genetic damage is one of the
most frightening of the potential
side-effects of the continued
pollution of our environment. It is
also the least understood. It is a
rare layman who understands at
all clearly just what "genetic
damage" might mean to his own
health and survival, or his
children's. The expert has every
reason to point the finger ol
suspicion at a great many
potential hazards, but he also
lacks proven criteria by which to
translate scattered laboratory
findings into reliable estimates of
human risk. '
Radiation was the first
environmental factor proven, in
the late H.J. Muller's experimental
studies with fruit flies, to cause
genetic damage, or as we might
now say, to cause mutations or
chemical changes in DNA. This
mutagenic effect has been found
in every one of many hundreds of
biological systems tested, and no
one doubts that human genes are
also susceptible to radiation
effects.
The kind of cell in which a
mutation occurs is all-important.
Every cell of the body is
programmed by a copy of the
individual's DNA, and is subject
to mutation. Only if the cell in
question is a germ cell, leading to
an egg or sperm, is there a
possibility of transmitting the
mutation to the offspring; and
then it will have no effect on the
persom him (or her-)self.
Alternatively, mutations may

occur in body cells, which can
have no effect on later
generations. Their effect on the
person is problematical, however,
there is grave concern that some
cancer-like diseases such as
leukemia stem from mutations in
blood-forming tissues. In
additional, the disorganization of
an increasing proportion of body
cells by mutation is one of the
plausible theories of aging. The
main evidence for these concerns
is that large doses of radiation will
induce leukemias and accelerate
ageing as well as produce
mutations in a proportion of all
exposed cells.
Mutations
Germ-cell mutations are what
we commonly think of as genetic
effects. They must still be
distinguished from direct effects
on the growing fetus—like thosyof
thaliodomide; the deformations
caused by this drug involved only
the limbs, and not the germ cells,
and will not be transmitted to
further generations.
Mutations are classified along
several lines. The function or
organ affected may range from
color vision to thought, from
toenail to scalp. The severity of
effect may be a cosmetic nicety
like a white forelock, or an
inviable monstrosity, or most
tragic of all, a physical deformity
or mental handicap. The mutation
may be dominant, immediately
expressed in one generation, or
recessive, reshuffled through
posterity until it appears
simultaneously in a uniting egg
and sperm. In recent years, we
have also become more aware of
the significance of chromosome
mutations where a whole
chromosome or a large segment of
one is imperfectly transmitted,
and mimics a dominant mutation.
Man's hereditary makeup is so
complex and diversified, and so
many environmental factors
influence the health and survival
of infants, that it is almost
impossible to get direct evidence
of genetic injury in man.
Even the studies of the
survivors of the bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki have
given only marginal, inconclusive
evidence of such effects. This is
no surprise to geneticists who
have calcualted the expected level
of changes from animal studies,
and who know how difficult it is
to standardize observations on
people.
Spontaneous Abortions
Our historical legacy of
mutations also obscures the
observation of additional,con
temporary damage to the genes.
That a third of fertilized eggs fail
to complete a normal life cycle is
the simplest way to describe the
genetic load. Fortunately, most of
these events are manifest as
spontaneous abortions; but all too
much misery already spills over
into the lives of born children and
their families.

programmed by a copy of the
individual's DNA, and is subject
to mutation. Only if the cell in
question is a germ cell, leading to
an egg or sperm, is there a
possibility of transmitting the
mutation to the offspring; and
then it will have no effect on the
persom him (or her-)self.
Alternatively, mutations may

occur in body cells, which can
have no effect on later
generations. Their effect on the
person is problematical, however,
there is grave concern that some
cancer-like diseases such as
leukemia stem from mutations in
blood-forming tissues. In
additional, the disorganization of
an increasing proportion of body
cells by mutation is one of the
plausible theories of aging. The
main evidence for these concerns
is that large doses of radiation will
induce leukemias and accelerate
ageing as well as produce
mutations in a proportion of all
exposed cells.
Mutations
Germ-cell mutations are what
we commonly think of as genetic
effects. They must still be
distinguished from direct effects
on the growing fetus—like thosyof
thaliodomide; the deformations
caused by this drug involved only
the limbs, and not the germ cells,
and will not be transmitted to
further generations.
Mutations are classified along
several lines. The function or
organ affected may range from
color vision to thought, from
toenail to scalp. The severity of
effect may be a cosmetic nicety
like a white forelock, or an
inviable monstrosity, or most
tragic of all, a physical deformity
or mental handicap. The mutation
may be dominant, immediately
expressed in one generation, or
recessive, reshuffled through
posterity until it appears
simultaneously in a uniting egg
and sperm. In recent years, we
have also become more aware of
the significance of chromosome
mutations where a whole
chromosome or a large segment of
one is imperfectly transmitted,
and mimics a dominant mutation.
Man's hereditary makeup is so
complex and diversified, and so
many environmental factors
influence the health and survival
of infants, that it is almost
impossible to get direct evidence
of genetic injury in man.
Even the studies of the
survivors of the bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki have
given only marginal, inconclusive
evidence of such effects. This is
no surprise to geneticists who
have calcualted the expected level
of changes from animal studies,
and who know how difficult it is
to standardize observations on
people.
Spontaneous Abortions
Our historical legacy of
mutations also obscures the
observation of additional,con
temporary damage to the genes.
That a third of fertilized eggs fail
to complete a normal life cycle is
the simplest way to describe the
genetic load. Fortunately, most of
these events are manifest as
spontaneous abortions; but all too
much misery already spills over
into the lives of born children and
their families.
Genetic damage is one of the
most frightening of the potential
side-effects of the continued
pollution of our environment. It is
also the least understood. It is a
rare layman who understands at
all clearly just what "genetic
damage" might mean to his own
health and survival, or his
children's. The expert has every
reason to point the finger ol
suspicion at a great many
potential hazards, but he also
lacks proven criteria by which to
translate scattered laboratory
findings into reliable estimates of
human risk. '
Radiation was the first
environmental factor proven, in
the late H.J. Muller's experimental
studies with fruit flies, to cause
genetic damage, or as we might
now say, to cause mutations or
chemical changes in DNA. This
mutagenic effect has been found
in every one of many hundreds of
biological systems tested, and no
one doubts that human genes are
also susceptible to radiation
effects.
The kind of cell in which a
mutation occurs is all-important.
Every cell of the body is
programmed by a copy of the
individual's DNA, and is subject
to mutation. Only if the cell in
question is a germ cell, leading to
an egg or sperm, is there a
possibility of transmitting the
mutation to the offspring; and
