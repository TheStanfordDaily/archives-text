# Self-Determination?
## Zionism's Purpose 
### Patricia Mihaly 
(The following article was
written by Pat Mihaly in response
to a column by David Selznick
which appeared in the October 29
issue of the DAILY).
1) Zionism's purpose was not
to establish a Jewish "homeland"
as he puts it but a Jewish "state"
in a land 90% Arab in 1920 and
67% Arab in 1947 (population,
not land, figures)—how's that for
self-determination?
2) The UN Partition Plan of
1947 allotted 56% of Palestine
(the most fertile areas) to the
Jewish state at a time when
Jewish ownership of land did not
exceed 6% in all Palestine and 9%
in the part to become the Jewish
state. In this the land legally
bought from Arabs that Selznick
refers to as justification for
partition?
3) To say that no Arabs were
ever displaced from their land is
to forget such terrorist activities
such as the slaughter of the whole
Arab village of Deir Yassin (men,
women and children) and others
like it which were a main factor in
causing unarmed Arabs to flee in
terror to refugee camps never to
this day to be compensated for
their homes and lands now being
used by Jewish immigrants.

4) Have you ever questioned,
Mr. Selznick, why there was no
"remote possibility" for Jews to
go any place but Palestine after
the Nazi pogroms? President
Roosevelt tried to remedy this at
the Bermuda Conference of 1943
through a proposal to open
European and American
immigration quotas to greater
numbers of Jews. The Zionists,
however, strongly opposed this,
since it would destroy their
argument that there was no place
to go but Palestine, and their
pressure caused the proposal to be
dropped.
5) Zonist "compromise" on
the partition of Palestine was easy
enough since they were being
generous with land they didn't
own anyway. Even at that, the
sincerity of their "compromise"
might be questioned when one
views the press statement by
David Ben Gurion, then head of
the Zionist Executive, in favor of
partition: "The debate has not
been for or against the indivisibility
of Eretz Israel (land of Israel). No
Zonist can forego the smallest
portion of Eretz Israel. The
debate was over which of the two
routes would lead quicker to the
common goal." The Arabs could

not accept to compromise their
own land under any circumstances
let alone these stated by Ben
Gurion.
6) Numerous testimonies by
Red Cross, UN personnel, and
non-Zionist Jews lead me to
question the equal treatment of
Arabs in Israel in the whole 21
years of Israeli statehood—and
tend to put Israeli propaganda to
the contrary on shaky grounds.
7) Last, an "intelligent
dialogue," as sought by Selznick,
must be based on full
understanding of both sides of the
issue. I am supporting that idea by
giving readers little-known facts
on the issue. I am not trying to
engage in a battle of polemics—the
title "Zionist Country Club" was
a Daily creation, not mine.
