# No Unilateral Ceasefire
## Cranston Speaks At Dinner 
### CHRIS COBEY 
Two alumni of Stanford
returned to the area Saturday
evening to voice opinions on the
Vietnam War and the Moratorium
at a press conference preceding a
Democratic fund-raising dinner.
Senators Alan Cranston of
California and Frank Church of
Idaho began an informal news
conference at a Los Altos
residence by citing examples of
recent teamwork in the Senate.
Cranston pointed out that he had
supported Church's attempts to
nullify Rule 22 of the Senate
procedures, the filibuster
regulation. "As usual, we lost,"
Church said.
The senior Senator from Idaho
praised Cranston's efforts
supporting a resolution of Senator
Aiken of Vermont which would
clarify a long-standing
misinterpretation of US foreign
policy. Cranston's amendment to
the resolution states that this
country's diplomatic recognition
of another nation does not
constitute American approval of

that nation. This resolution could
ease the way of future attempts to
extend US diplomatic recognition
to Communist China.
Both Senators were in
substantial agreement as to the
withdrawal of US forces from
South Vietnam. Senator Cranston
clarified his position by stating
that he would not support a
unilateral ceasefire, because that
would leave US troops at the
mercy of an army which has
shown little respect for past
ceasefire agreements.
De fusing Peace Movements
Senator Church, while
commending the Moratorium, said
that it had "dangerous potential,"
and that the Administration
would probably continue
attempts to "defuse" the grass
roots movement. Such an attempt
would consist of two steps: First,
a stepped-up withdrawal rate of
US combat forces, and second, a
full, complete military
disengagement from the conflict.
The Idaho legislator said that
no "halfway attempt" of the

President would placate
Americans in regard to the
cessation of hostilities in Vietnam.
Church felt that Nixon's
announcement of a speech on the
subject (set for tonight) was
meant to take some of the steam
from the October 15th protest.
Cranston added that the President
probably does not know exactly
what his talk will propose even at
this late date.
Senator Church favored a
pullout of all US combat troops
from Laos and Cambodia at the
same time as the Vietnam
disengagement. He criticized the
fighting in Laos as the "first time
the United States has engaged in
an undisclosed foreign war."
Chinese War Averted
In conversation later, Senator
Church stated that if public
opinion had not been so intense
against the policies of the Johnson
Administration in Southeast Asia,
"we would now be involved in a
land war with China."
A member of the Senate for ten
years, Church said that he would

support the Moratorium as long as
it remained peaceful and as long
as the President did not
substantially change his policies
on the war.
Senator Cranston reported that
he had been working with
members of the House, including
Representatives Reid (R-New
York), Don Edwards
( D-Ca li fornia), and Allard
Lowenstein (D-New York) to
sustain the Moratorium as a
"peaceful, non-violent" protest.
Future LIS Policy
In response to a question as to
whether he conceived of
America's purpose as one to act as
"policeman" of the world, Church
replied that, while the US should
remain free to offer non-military
assistance to foreign nations,
foreign governments "should look
to their own resources." To
substantiate this view, Church
reported that President Kennedy's
original intention was to aid the
South Vietnamese regime with
everything but combat troops.

original intention was to aid the
South Vietnamese regime with
everything but combat troops.
Two alumni of Stanford
returned to the area Saturday
evening to voice opinions on the
Vietnam War and the Moratorium
at a press conference preceding a
Democratic fund-raising dinner.
Senators Alan Cranston of
California and Frank Church of
Idaho began an informal news
conference at a Los Altos
residence by citing examples of
recent teamwork in the Senate.
Cranston pointed out that he had
supported Church's attempts to
nullify Rule 22 of the Senate
procedures, the filibuster
regulation. "As usual, we lost,"
Church said.
The senior Senator from Idaho
praised Cranston's efforts
supporting a resolution of Senator
Aiken of Vermont which would
clarify a long-standing
misinterpretation of US foreign
policy. Cranston's amendment to
the resolution states that this
country's diplomatic recognition
of another nation does not
constitute American approval of

that nation. This resolution could
ease the way of future attempts to
extend US diplomatic recognition
to Communist China.
Both Senators were in
substantial agreement as to the
withdrawal of US forces from
South Vietnam. Senator Cranston
clarified his position by stating
that he would not support a
unilateral ceasefire, because that
would leave US troops at the
mercy of an army which has
shown little respect for past
ceasefire agreements.
De fusing Peace Movements
Senator Church, while
commending the Moratorium, said
that it had "dangerous potential,"
and that the Administration
would probably continue
attempts to "defuse" the grass
roots movement. Such an attempt
would consist of two steps: First,
a stepped-up withdrawal rate of
US combat forces, and second, a
full, complete military
disengagement from the conflict.
The Idaho legislator said that
no "halfway attempt" of the

President would placate
Americans in regard to the
cessation of hostilities in Vietnam.
Church felt that Nixon's
announcement of a speech on the
subject (set for tonight) was
meant to take some of the steam
from the October 15th protest.
Cranston added that the President
probably does not know exactly
what his talk will propose even at
this late date.
Senator Church favored a
pullout of all US combat troops
from Laos and Cambodia at the
same time as the Vietnam
disengagement. He criticized the
fighting in Laos as the "first time
the United States has engaged in
an undisclosed foreign war."
Chinese War Averted
In conversation later, Senator
Church stated that if public
opinion had not been so intense
against the policies of the Johnson
Administration in Southeast Asia,
"we would now be involved in a
land war with China."
A member of the Senate for ten
years, Church said that he would

support the Moratorium as long as
it remained peaceful and as long
as the President did not
substantially change his policies
on the war.
Senator Cranston reported that
he had been working with
members of the House, including
Representatives Reid (R-New
York), Don Edwards
( D-Ca li fornia), and Allard
Lowenstein (D-New York) to
sustain the Moratorium as a
"peaceful, non-violent" protest.
Future LIS Policy
In response to a question as to
whether he conceived of
America's purpose as one to act as
"policeman" of the world, Church
replied that, while the US should
remain free to offer non-military
assistance to foreign nations,
foreign governments "should look
to their own resources." To
substantiate this view, Church
reported that President Kennedy's
original intention was to aid the
South Vietnamese regime with
everything but combat troops.
