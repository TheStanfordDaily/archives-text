San Francisco Mayor Joseph L.
Alioto will speak on "A City
Perspective" today at 4:15 in
Memorial Auditorium. His speech
will be a part of the Political
Union's fall symposium "America
on the Threshold of the
Seventies."
Mayor Alioto was elected in
January, 1968. He has gained a
national reputation as an urban
planner and innovator. He has also
worked for the Department of
Justice.

Admission to the symposium is
free. Mayor Alioto will be the
guest at a reception to be held in
the large lounge at Tresidder
immediately following his speech.
The Stanford Community
Against War and Fascism said in a
leaflet distributed over the
weekend that they would
establish an "informational
picket" line outside the
auditorium during Alioto's
speech.
