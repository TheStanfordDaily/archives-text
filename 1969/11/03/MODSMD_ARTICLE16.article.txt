# Libel Responsibility Changed For Daily
## 
### 
The ASSU Publications Board
last Friday voted to require new
procedures by editors of The
Daily to insure the legality of its
copy.
The Board, which consists of
the editors and business managers
of all official student publications
in addition to several university
officials, voted 6-4 that Daily
editors must seek Counsel on
copy that Daily editors consider
to be potentially libelous.
Stanford Staff Counsel are
lawyers working for the
university, most of them
employed in the Stanford
Business Office. Daily staff could
appeal Staff Counsel's decision to
the Publications Board.
Further, the resolution further
states that "if in the opinion of
Staff Counsel the fact or
statement is actionable, the editor
shall modify or omit the
actionable fact or statement." The
motion, in the form of an
amendment to Publications Board
Standing Rules, was introduced
by Student Financial Manager
David Swift and backed by Pat
Shea of the Council of Presidents.
In the past, The Daily has been
free to consult counsel without
being constrained by their advice.
However, the student-owned
newspaper lost its libel insurance
this fall, as heightened campus
tensions have discouraged agencies
from insuring student
organizations. Because of this loss,
the ASSU Executive has moved to

protect ASSU from damaging
lawsuits by proposing the motion
that gives Staff Counsel veto
power over questionable material.
Daily editor Mark Weinberger
opposed the motion, claiming that
it was "a very clear censorship
move that clearly intrudes on the
editorial independence of the
paper." While acknowledging that
the ASSU needed to take steps to
protect itself financially until the
newspaper can achieve its
independence, Weinberger decried
the "conflict of interest inherent
in giving business office
employees veto power over Daily
copy" under certain
circumstances.
The Publications Board is
scheduled to meet this afternoon
to consider recommendations by
Swift that would exert similar
controls over the Chaparral, a
magazine independent of the
ASSU. Possibilities include
exertion of tighter controls over
Chaparral copy or complete
severance of all Chaparral-ASSU
ties that would absolve ASSU of
all legal responsibilities.
