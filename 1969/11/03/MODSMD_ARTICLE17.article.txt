# Chaplin, 'Blow-Up' On Tap For Week
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Unqualified rilm classics by
Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles and
Billy Wilder highlight this week's
crowded movie schedule though
space limitations force me to
wait until Wednesday to comment
on the weekend's films.
The Monday night
experimental film series will be
presenting a special program of
shorts by San Franciscan John
Sunier at which the film maker
will appear and answer questions
afterwards. The one-man show
consists of Rennaisance Pleasure
Fair, Aerodrome, Water Cycle,
Monterey Pop Festival,
Impressions, Rite and Ride and
Skunk. Also being shown at 9
P.M. in the art auditorium are two
old classics, the fabulous Bride of
Frankenstein and The Great Train
Robbery.
On Tuesday in Geology 320,
Clive Miller will present an
enjoyable, light-hearted musical,
Love Me Tonight directed by
Rouben Mamoulian. Featuring
songs by Rodgers and Hart, the
picture stars Maurice Chevalier,
Jeanette Mac Donald, Charlie
Ruggles and Myrna Loy. The
second feature is Blessed Event, a
frantic newspaper comedy with
Lee Tracy, Mary Brian and Dick
Powell.
At 7:30 and 8:30 on
Wednesday, Aida will be shown as
part of Tresidder's Ballet and
Opera film series. The 1954
production features Sophia Loren
and the singing voices of Renata
-Tebaldi, Ebe Stegnani and
Guiseppe Lampora.
A special showing of Charlie
Chaplin's The Gold Rush has been
arranged for Wednesday evening
in Physics Tank. The heights of
Chaplin's artistry and humanity
come into play in this silent
classic, voted at the Brussels
World's Fair as the second greatest
film of all time. Also on the bill
are two shorts from the San
Francisco Newsreel, High School
Rising an expose of conditions in
local public schools, and People's
Park, which not only includes
footage of last year's disturbances
but tries to determine the causes
and forces behind them.

Closing out a busy Wednesday
is Antonioni's famed Blow Up. It
is held that this film was a
pace-setter, since it was followed
by a rash of "swinging" films
featuring alienated heroes, nude
romps, vague philosophical ideas
and visual elements even more
pretentious than those employed
by Antonioni. Thus, Blow Up's
distinction at the head of this
group remains dubious.
Nonetheless, the film was a smash
hit and was liked by many, so a
look at it in retrospect should be
enlightening. Watch The Daily for
time and place.
This week's International
Center film is Casque d'Or.
Directed by the late Jacques
Becker, the picture is a simple,
poetic evocation of the Parisian
underworld of 1900 and offers
the young and beautiful Simone
Signoret in one of her best
performances. Abounding in
tenderness and detail, the film will
be shown on Thursday at 7:45 in
Cubberley.

pace-setter, since it was followed
by a rash of "swinging" films
featuring alienated heroes, nude
romps, vague philosophical ideas
and visual elements even more
pretentious than those employed
by Antonioni. Thus, Blow Up's
distinction at the head of this
group remains dubious.
Nonetheless, the film was a smash
hit and was liked by many, so a
look at it in retrospect should be
enlightening. Watch The Daily for
time and place.
This week's International
Center film is Casque d'Or.
Directed by the late Jacques
Becker, the picture is a simple,
poetic evocation of the Parisian
underworld of 1900 and offers
the young and beautiful Simone
Signoret in one of her best
performances. Abounding in
tenderness and detail, the film will
be shown on Thursday at 7:45 in
Cubberley.
Unqualified rilm classics by
Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles and
Billy Wilder highlight this week's
crowded movie schedule though
space limitations force me to
wait until Wednesday to comment
on the weekend's films.
The Monday night
experimental film series will be
presenting a special program of
shorts by San Franciscan John
Sunier at which the film maker
will appear and answer questions
afterwards. The one-man show
consists of Rennaisance Pleasure
Fair, Aerodrome, Water Cycle,
Monterey Pop Festival,
Impressions, Rite and Ride and
Skunk. Also being shown at 9
P.M. in the art auditorium are two
old classics, the fabulous Bride of
Frankenstein and The Great Train
Robbery.
On Tuesday in Geology 320,
Clive Miller will present an
enjoyable, light-hearted musical,
Love Me Tonight directed by
Rouben Mamoulian. Featuring
songs by Rodgers and Hart, the
picture stars Maurice Chevalier,
Jeanette Mac Donald, Charlie
Ruggles and Myrna Loy. The
second feature is Blessed Event, a
frantic newspaper comedy with
Lee Tracy, Mary Brian and Dick
Powell.
At 7:30 and 8:30 on
Wednesday, Aida will be shown as
part of Tresidder's Ballet and
Opera film series. The 1954
production features Sophia Loren
and the singing voices of Renata
-Tebaldi, Ebe Stegnani and
Guiseppe Lampora.
A special showing of Charlie
Chaplin's The Gold Rush has been
arranged for Wednesday evening
in Physics Tank. The heights of
Chaplin's artistry and humanity
come into play in this silent
classic, voted at the Brussels
World's Fair as the second greatest
film of all time. Also on the bill
are two shorts from the San
Francisco Newsreel, High School
Rising an expose of conditions in
local public schools, and People's
Park, which not only includes
footage of last year's disturbances
but tries to determine the causes
and forces behind them.

Closing out a busy Wednesday
is Antonioni's famed Blow Up. It
is held that this film was a
pace-setter, since it was followed
by a rash of "swinging" films
featuring alienated heroes, nude
romps, vague philosophical ideas
and visual elements even more
