## Lindsay Holds Lead In Poll 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)- Mayor
John V. Lindsey's bid for a
second term in New York City
holds national attention in
Tuesday's off-year elections.
Lindsay, rated a potential
presidential candidate after his
election in 1965, was defeated last
June for the Republican
nomination. But he is running as
an independent and is heavily
favored over two opponents.
Meanwhile, the final straw poll
of the New York Daily News
Sunday night gave Mayor John V.
Lindsay a 21-percentage point
lead over Democrat Mario
Procaccino and 25 points over
Republican-Conservative John J.
Marchi.
The final poll—the fifth taken
by the newspaper at three-day
intervals—showed:
Lindsay 48, Procaccino 27,
Marchi 23, with 2 percent
undecided.
It was Lindsay's best showing
in any of the five polls, his lowest
being 44 percent in the first poll.
Marchi,too, had his best showing,
up from 19 percent in the second
poll.
Procaccino's figure was a new
low, marking a steady decline
from the 33 percent he achieved
in the first poll.
Each straw poll was a citywide
sampling of about 3,000 ballots.
The newspaper has picked the
winner in every majoral election
since its straw poll was begun four
decades ago.
Hijackers
PLATTSBURGH, N.Y.
(AP)- Six Americans accused of
separate airplane hijackings to
Cuba returned voluntarily to the
United States Sunday and were

charged by the FBI with air
piracy.
Seven FBI agents took charge
of the men as they stepped into
the country after the inspection.
If convicted, they could be
sentenced to death.
One of them brought along his
4-year-old daughter whom the
FBI said he had taken from her
mother last December. They said
he had taken the child with him
to Cuba.
The six men and child sailed
into Montreal Saturday night on
the Cuban freighter Luis Arces
Bergnes. At Montreal they asked
Canadian authorities to escort
them to the international border
at Champlain, near here, the FBI
said.
U.S. officials said they would
offer no immediate explanation of
why the men had volunteered to
return to their native land despite
the charges that faced them.
But comments from relative
indicated that they had become
disillusioned, disenchanted with
Cuba and the lives they led th< o.
The accused hijackers were
arraigned and then placed in jail.
Bail was set at amounts ranging
from $100,000 to $200,000 each.
The FBI said the girl, Jennifer
Washington, had accompanied her
father last December when he
commandeered an airplane over
Florida and forced the crew to fly
it to Cuba. Thomas George
Washington, 29, of Gary, Ind.,
had taken the girl from the home
of his estranged wife in
Philadelphia, the agents said. He
was held in lieu of $100,000 bail
The FBI identified the other
as: Thomas J. Boynton, 32
Raymond Anthony, Sr., 56, of
Baltimore; Ronald Thomas Bohle
22, from Michigan City, Ind.; A.
Vollis, whose age was given as 24

to 30, and Joseph C. Crawford,
listed as 25 to 36 years old.
Violence
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
national violence commission said
Sunday the threat of assassination
still stalks the land and the Secret
Service should be empowered to
guard any federal official or
candidate deemed to be in danger.
Even state and local
governments, the commission
said, should look to the
protection afforded governors,
mayors and other officeholders.
It said presidents and
presidential candidates should cut
down risky public appearances.
Congress should require free
television time for candidates —not
only to establish a new pattern in
presidential campaigning but "to
reduce significantly the pressure
toward personal appearances in all
parts of the country."
The National Commission on
the Causes and Prevention of
Violence, headed by Dr. Milton S.
Eisenhower, was formed after the
June 5, 1968, assassination of
Robert F. Kennedy, who was slain
while campaigning for the
Democratic presidential
nomination.
Seventeen months later, the
commission said, "present trends
warn of an escalating risk of
assassination, not only for
presidents but for other
officeholders at every level of
government, as well as leaders of
civil rights and political-interest
groups."
The commission's
recommendations include:
— Restrictive licensing of
handguns.
—Development and use of

electronic devices to detect
concealed weapons and
ammunition on persons entering
public meeting places.
—Less attention by the press to
the personal lives of the president
and his family "with
correspondingly greater attention
to the working nature and
limitations of the presidency,"
thus discouraging "a simplistic
notion of the presidency that
assassins are not alone in
holding."
Hijack
ROME ( A P ) — J u d i c i al
authorities went ahead Sunday
with plans to try Raphael
Minichiello in Italy as the crew of
the Trans World Airlines jet he
hijacked from California to Rome
returned to the United States.
Assistant Rome Prosecutor
Massimo Carli questioned the
20-year-old U.S. Marine in an
isolation cell of Rome's grimly
imposing Regina Coeli-Queen of
Heaven-jail overlooking the Tiber
River.
At Rome's Leonardo da Vinci
Airport, where the younger
Minichiello had arrived Saturday
morning in a Boeing 707 at the
end of history's longest air hijack,
crew members of the hijacked
plane got a regular TWA flight and
flew back to New York.
They were Capt. Donald Cook
of New York, first officer Wenzell
Williams of Shallowater, Tex.,
engineer Lloyd Halloran of St.
Charles, Mo., and hostess Tracey
Coleman of Cincinnati, Ohio.
Before departure, Capt. Cook
blasted the FBI in an interview as
causing "a fiasco" at Kennedy
