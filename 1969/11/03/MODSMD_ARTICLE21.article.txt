# Stanford's Asian-Americans Meet
## Japanese, Chinese, Koreans Consider Common Problems

By BETTY NISHIOKA
"I'm an individual first, an
American second , and a
Japanese-American third. We are
all trying to be Americans, but
our faces tell us that we aren't and
our parents tell us that we aren't
either. So we come to Stanford
thinking that we aren'i but that
we want to be."
At a meeting of the Stanford
A si a n - A m e r i c a n students
Thursday night, Gary Hoshiyama
thus elucidated one of the
dilemmas of the Oriental student
in American society. About 90
students gathered in the Donner
Lounge of Stern Hall to explore
the possibilities, if any, for
Asian-Americans at Stanford to
organize and act as a community.
The gathering was a result of a
small group of Japanese, Chinese,
and Korean students at Stanford
who had met about a week and a
half ago to discuss what it was to
be Oriental. They decided to
extend their discussion to the

entire Stanford Asian community,
and letters were sent to each of
the 220 Asian-American students
at Stanford informing them of a
meeting to discuss whether there
is a community of interest among
Asian-Americans at Stanford,
whether there is a need to
articulate these interests, and
whether there are common
Asian-American problems that can
be solved.
Variety of Viewpoints
Five students initiated the
discussion by presenting various
viewpoints on he Asian-American
si tuation.
Shirley Tung, a second-year
medical student, reported on a
conference that took place in
Berkeley two weeks ago in which
Chinese people discussed the
possibility of preserving a culture
without being isolated from the
community ar large. The
discussion at the conference
brought out the point that
Chinatown in a ghetto with all the
symptoms of feelings of
inferiority and lack of motivation
which characterizes ghetto life.
It was also noted by the second
speaker, Shirley Sun, a graduate
student in art history, that
"Chinatown does have the highest
suicide rate in San Francisco."
Miss Sun emphasized the
importance of an ethnic studies
program on campus: "Although
ethnic studies have become as
respectable as anti-war protest, on
this campus we need some kind of
rationale." She remarked that an
Oriental cannot ignore the fact
that he looks Oriental and is
viewed as such. For example, the
situation is such that people
immediately expect an
Asian—American to know either
Japanese or Chinese.
Miss Sun stated that the "myth
that Orientals are super-proud of
their culture" is true to some

extent but in terms of a white
world, a feeling which probably is
more likely to prevail is that of
inferiority. Therefore, most
Orientals don't speak their native
language anymore, purposely
avoid Asian studies, and turn
away from anything that "smacks
of their native country."
On the subject of
discrimination, Miss Sun noted
the small number of
Asia -American teachers (not
even 1%) and complete lack of
Oriental counsellors in the Palo
Alto School District which has an
enrollment of 3 V2 %
Asia n- Americans.
In her own area of study, Miss
Sun found that only 3% of world
history books are dedicated to
Asian history while none of the
large major art books deal with
Oriental art. At Stanford there are
no studio art classes on Asian art
at all.
Multi-Ethnic Center
One of the long-range projects
that Miss Sun suggested was an
Asian Community Center, perhaps
something similar to the
multi-media, multi-ethnic center
in Berkeley where children go to
see, hear, and feel their culture
through such things as hearing
stories about Asian-Americans,
blacks, etc. and watching films in
a "24-screen, all-around movie
room." An ethnic center,
according to Miss Sun, could

coordinate activities with school
districts and the community, such
as tutoring and taking advantage
of cultural exhibitions in San
Francisco.
Neal Okabayashi, speaking on
political aspects, asserted that the
lack of racial identity was in some
way "brought about by American
society." He noted how Leland
Stanford made his fortune
through railroad built by
Chinese coolies. Then for the
Centennial last year, the
University was not even going to
invite Chinese representatives
until they stated that they would
come anyway.
"Where Wp Are"
Nelson Dong, a senior in
economics, informed the
gathering of "what and where"
the Asian-Americans are— Every
one of us got in here [Stanford]
on the basis of admission
requirements . . .we are
supposedly the cream of the
crop . . .70% of the
Asian-Americans are either from
Hawaii or California. The rest are
from New York, Oregon, or
Washington.
Nelson raised the question of
why most Orientals go into fields
such as medicine, engineering, and
the sciences in general and
observed that these were the areas
where one is least likely to
encounter prejudice and racism.
