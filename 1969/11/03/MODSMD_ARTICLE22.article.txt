# Oriental's Meeting Called To Discuss Local Adjustment
## 
### CHRISTING SHIH 
The Asian-American students
are a silent minority.
Black students at Stanford have
the Black Student Union to
reflect the black position on
issues, to articulate black
problems, to press for black
demand . Mexican-American
students have a similar
organization in MECHA. The
oriental student has no such
organization.
During the past week,
Asian-American students received
letters from Alan Grundman,
Assistant to the Provost, stating
that some students were forming
as Asian-American Association.
Grundman sent the letters on
behalf of the student organizers,
since they were unable to obtain
access to the confidential records
listing students by race.
The letters were sent only to
U.S.-born Orientals.
This movement originated
informally from conversations
between individual students.
Debbie Leong, sophomore living
in Roble, said, "I suddenly
realized that there was nothing on
campus for oriental students other
than the Chinese Students
Association, which is basically
social.
There is need for a social
organization, but there was no
group, no organization where we
could talk to other Orientals
about prejudice, or for organizing
Chinese art courses, or anything."
UC at Berkeley has seven
oriental student groups whose
purposes range from purely social
to militantly political. Stanford
has the one social Chinese
Students Association. Why is
there such a large discrepancy in
activism between Stanford's and
Berkeley's oriental student
population?
"The first difference is a matter
of numbers," explained Nelson
Dong, junior in Serra. "Out of a
population of 28,000 students at
Berkeley, 2,700 or almost ten
percent are Oriental. At Stanford,
here are only 220 Asian-American
students out of a population of
12,000. Orientals make up a little
less than two percent of the
student body."
Another difference is in the
makeup of the Oiental student
population itself. Among the
organizers of the proposed
association, some striking
similarities appear. Most or all of
them have been raised in suburbs.
None have lived in Chinatown or
the Japanese or Korean
equivalent. Many were the only
Orientals in their high schools.
