# Indians Crush Oregon State
## Everyone Stars As Tribe Rolls Easily 
### FRED LEESON 
The key breaks which have been so elusive this season were all
Stanford's—even a last-second field goal by Steve Horowitz—during a
golden Saturday afternoon in Corvallis, Oregon.
Though the Indians unquestionably played good football in their
facile 33-0 win, Oregon State beneficently contributed six fumbles
and four bad passes to make the job much easier.
Beaver Coach Dee Andros, looking glum despite his orange jacket,
tie and socks, distributed his bulk on an oak desk deep in the
' basement of Gill Coliseum and said slowly, "We fumbled and we
stumbled and we put too much pressure on the defense. If we hadn't
played great defense we'd have been run out of the ballpark."
They almost were anyway.
Tribe R oils
The Tribe traveled 493 total yards, had two fourth quarter drives
stopped on the OSU 10 and six yard lines, and were on the eight when
the game ended. Not to mention a Miles Moore pass interception run
55 yards for a score that was nullified.
Down the hall from Andros, Coach John Ralston savored the
pleasure of easy victory, calmly shaking hands with friends and
complimenting his coaches and individuals on both sides.
All those breaks? "We'll take a few when we can get them," he
smiled, and added that his defense "was the real plus for us."
In scoring its third shutout, Stanford's defense scored a safety,
stifled the Beavers to 14 net yards rushing (dumping quarterbacks
Endicott and Barton for losses of 72), allowed but 166 offensive
yards, picked off four passes and forced seven punts.
And if you're looking for individual stars, count nearly the whole
46* man travelling squad.
Everyone Stars
Jim Kauffman, Pat Preston, Jody Graves, Tim McClure, Phil Satre
and Pete Lazetich all snared Beaver fumbles; Jack Schultz and Satre
intercepted passes and Miles Moore captured two, one halting an OSU
drive in the endzone.
"They're a great offensive football team," Andros said, "but I think
we gave them 19 points."
The trend of the game was set mid-way in the first quarter when
Stanford drove 78 yards to the OSU two, and fumbled. Kauffman got
the ball back on the Beavers' first play and Jackie Brown then carried
for the touchdown.
Another fumble on he OSU seven led to Stanford's second score, a
seven yard pass from Jim Plunkett to Howie Williams which gave
Plunkett Stanford's all-time touchdown pass record with 29.
Schultz's interception and 21-yard return set up Horowitz's
excellent 41-yard field goal which ended the half.
Shockley Shines
Int he third period, Hillary Shockley took a right side pitch-out 16
yards for a touchdown, running right over the last defender on the
one. "It was right there," he said over a cool drink in the dressing
room. "I hit the hole and ran to daylight."
After that score, OSU suffered its worst humiliation: Terrel Smith
dropped Endicott for six yards on his 14, and on the next play, Wade
Kiliefer chased the Beaver quarterback all the way to the goal line and
pulled him down for a safety.
Stanford's 230 yards rushing were distributed mainly between Don
Bunce with 49, Bubba Brown with 44, Jackie Brown with 43,
Williams with 42 and Shockley with 34.
Bunce engineered the final scoring drive of 29 yards, following
Satre's fumble recovery, hitting Ron Kadziel with a 14-yard
touchdown pass.
Plunkett <,)uits Early
Plunkett retired to the bench mid-way in he third period with 191
yards passing, 15-25, and 205 total yards.
Oregon State's strong pass rush, led by NCAA heavyweight
wrestling champion Jess Lewis, buried Plunkett three times in the
game, but the Indians more than retaliated against Endicott.
Dennis Moore and Jeff Siemon got to him first, then Moore did it
again, then Smith and Killefer put together their successive charges
ending in the safety, and in he final period, Dave Grossi broke through
twice in a row before Satre's interception.
Ralston Pleased
"We saw some good young players," Ralston said afterward, noting
performances by Miles Moore, Satre, Grossi and Shockley.
Andros, whose physical resemblance to a well-rounded pumpkin is
blatantly advertised by himself and the OSU publicity agents, dangled
his legs off the desk and said things like, "This is one of the longest
afternoons I've ever spent," and "we gotta regroup."
Meanwhile Kauffman was silently escorting his own pumpkin
around the locker room area, a small jack-o-lantern with a distinctly
sad frown.
Stanford had more than compensated for its dismal 29-7 loss to the
Beavers the year before, and thus the Indians left Corvallis, the sun
setting red behind the Coast Range.

55 yards for a score that was nullified.
Down the hall from Andros, Coach John Ralston savored the
pleasure of easy victory, calmly shaking hands with friends and
complimenting his coaches and individuals on both sides.
All those breaks? "We'll take a few when we can get them," he
smiled, and added that his defense "was the real plus for us."
In scoring its third shutout, Stanford's defense scored a safety,
stifled the Beavers to 14 net yards rushing (dumping quarterbacks
Endicott and Barton for losses of 72), allowed but 166 offensive
yards, picked off four passes and forced seven punts.
And if you're looking for individual stars, count nearly the whole
46* man travelling squad.
Everyone Stars
Jim Kauffman, Pat Preston, Jody Graves, Tim McClure, Phil Satre
and Pete Lazetich all snared Beaver fumbles; Jack Schultz and Satre
intercepted passes and Miles Moore captured two, one halting an OSU
drive in the endzone.
"They're a great offensive football team," Andros said, "but I think
we gave them 19 points."
The trend of the game was set mid-way in the first quarter when
Stanford drove 78 yards to the OSU two, and fumbled. Kauffman got
the ball back on the Beavers' first play and Jackie Brown then carried
for the touchdown.
Another fumble on he OSU seven led to Stanford's second score, a
seven yard pass from Jim Plunkett to Howie Williams which gave
Plunkett Stanford's all-time touchdown pass record with 29.
Schultz's interception and 21-yard return set up Horowitz's
excellent 41-yard field goal which ended the half.
Shockley Shines
Int he third period, Hillary Shockley took a right side pitch-out 16
yards for a touchdown, running right over the last defender on the
one. "It was right there," he said over a cool drink in the dressing
room. "I hit the hole and ran to daylight."
After that score, OSU suffered its worst humiliation: Terrel Smith
dropped Endicott for six yards on his 14, and on the next play, Wade
Kiliefer chased the Beaver quarterback all the way to the goal line and
pulled him down for a safety.
Stanford's 230 yards rushing were distributed mainly between Don
Bunce with 49, Bubba Brown with 44, Jackie Brown with 43,
Williams with 42 and Shockley with 34.
Bunce engineered the final scoring drive of 29 yards, following
Satre's fumble recovery, hitting Ron Kadziel with a 14-yard
touchdown pass.
Plunkett <,)uits Early
Plunkett retired to the bench mid-way in he third period with 191
yards passing, 15-25, and 205 total yards.
Oregon State's strong pass rush, led by NCAA heavyweight
wrestling champion Jess Lewis, buried Plunkett three times in the
game, but the Indians more than retaliated against Endicott.
Dennis Moore and Jeff Siemon got to him first, then Moore did it
again, then Smith and Killefer put together their successive charges
ending in the safety, and in he final period, Dave Grossi broke through
twice in a row before Satre's interception.
Ralston Pleased
"We saw some good young players," Ralston said afterward, noting
performances by Miles Moore, Satre, Grossi and Shockley.
Andros, whose physical resemblance to a well-rounded pumpkin is
blatantly advertised by himself and the OSU publicity agents, dangled
his legs off the desk and said things like, "This is one of the longest
afternoons I've ever spent," and "we gotta regroup."
Meanwhile Kauffman was silently escorting his own pumpkin
around the locker room area, a small jack-o-lantern with a distinctly
sad frown.
Stanford had more than compensated for its dismal 29-7 loss to the
Beavers the year before, and thus the Indians left Corvallis, the sun
setting red behind the Coast Range.

THEY AINT DEAD YET—John Ralston steals a trick from OSU's Dee Andros, and leads his team out onto the field.
Hie Indians are technically still in the Rose Bowl race, and the way they have been playing all year, they probably
deserve the hid. The Tribe faces Washington (0-7) on Saturday, and finish the season at home with Air Force and
California.
The key breaks which have been so elusive this season were all
Stanford's—even a last-second field goal by Steve Horowitz—during a
golden Saturday afternoon in Corvallis, Oregon.
Though the Indians unquestionably played good football in their
facile 33-0 win, Oregon State beneficently contributed six fumbles
and four bad passes to make the job much easier.
Beaver Coach Dee Andros, looking glum despite his orange jacket,
tie and socks, distributed his bulk on an oak desk deep in the
' basement of Gill Coliseum and said slowly, "We fumbled and we
stumbled and we put too much pressure on the defense. If we hadn't
played great defense we'd have been run out of the ballpark."
They almost were anyway.
Tribe R oils
The Tribe traveled 493 total yards, had two fourth quarter drives
stopped on the OSU 10 and six yard lines, and were on the eight when
the game ended. Not to mention a Miles Moore pass interception run
55 yards for a score that was nullified.

intercepted passes and Miles Moore captured two, one halting an OSU
drive in the endzone.
"They're a great offensive football team," Andros said, "but I think
we gave them 19 points."
The trend of the game was set mid-way in the first quarter when
Stanford drove 78 yards to the OSU two, and fumbled. Kauffman got
the ball back on the Beavers' first play and Jackie Brown then carried
for the touchdown.
Another fumble on he OSU seven led to Stanford's second score, a
seven yard pass from Jim Plunkett to Howie Williams which gave
Plunkett Stanford's all-time touchdown pass record with 29.
Schultz's interception and 21-yard return set up Horowitz's
excellent 41-yard field goal which ended the half.
Shockley Shines
Int he third period, Hillary Shockley took a right side pitch-out 16
yards for a touchdown, running right over the last defender on the
one. "It was right there," he said over a cool drink in the dressing
room. "I hit the hole and ran to daylight."
After that score, OSU suffered its worst humiliation: Terrel Smith
dropped Endicott for six yards on his 14, and on the next play, Wade
Kiliefer chased the Beaver quarterback all the way to the goal line and
pulled him down for a safety.
Stanford's 230 yards rushing were distributed mainly between Don
Bunce with 49, Bubba Brown with 44, Jackie Brown with 43,
Williams with 42 and Shockley with 34.
Bunce engineered the final scoring drive of 29 yards, following
Satre's fumble recovery, hitting Ron Kadziel with a 14-yard
touchdown pass.
Plunkett <,)uits Early
Plunkett retired to the bench mid-way in he third period with 191
yards passing, 15-25, and 205 total yards.
Oregon State's strong pass rush, led by NCAA heavyweight
wrestling champion Jess Lewis, buried Plunkett three times in the
game, but the Indians more than retaliated against Endicott.
Dennis Moore and Jeff Siemon got to him first, then Moore did it
again, then Smith and Killefer put together their successive charges
ending in the safety, and in he final period, Dave Grossi broke through
twice in a row before Satre's interception.
Ralston Pleased
"We saw some good young players," Ralston said afterward, noting
performances by Miles Moore, Satre, Grossi and Shockley.
Andros, whose physical resemblance to a well-rounded pumpkin is
blatantly advertised by himself and the OSU publicity agents, dangled
his legs off the desk and said things like, "This is one of the longest
afternoons I've ever spent," and "we gotta regroup."
Meanwhile Kauffman was silently escorting his own pumpkin
around the locker room area, a small jack-o-lantern with a distinctly
sad frown.
Stanford had more than compensated for its dismal 29-7 loss to the
Beavers the year before, and thus the Indians left Corvallis, the sun
setting red behind the Coast Range.

THEY AINT DEAD YET—John Ralston steals a trick from OSU's Dee Andros, and leads his team out onto the field.
Hie Indians are technically still in the Rose Bowl race, and the way they have been playing all year, they probably
deserve the hid. The Tribe faces Washington (0-7) on Saturday, and finish the season at home with Air Force and
California.
The key breaks which have been so elusive this season were all
Stanford's—even a last-second field goal by Steve Horowitz—during a
golden Saturday afternoon in Corvallis, Oregon.
Though the Indians unquestionably played good football in their
facile 33-0 win, Oregon State beneficently contributed six fumbles
and four bad passes to make the job much easier.
Beaver Coach Dee Andros, looking glum despite his orange jacket,
tie and socks, distributed his bulk on an oak desk deep in the
' basement of Gill Coliseum and said slowly, "We fumbled and we
stumbled and we put too much pressure on the defense. If we hadn't
played great defense we'd have been run out of the ballpark."
They almost were anyway.
Tribe R oils
The Tribe traveled 493 total yards, had two fourth quarter drives
stopped on the OSU 10 and six yard lines, and were on the eight when
the game ended. Not to mention a Miles Moore pass interception run
55 yards for a score that was nullified.
Down the hall from Andros, Coach John Ralston savored the
pleasure of easy victory, calmly shaking hands with friends and
complimenting his coaches and individuals on both sides.
All those breaks? "We'll take a few when we can get them," he
smiled, and added that his defense "was the real plus for us."
In scoring its third shutout, Stanford's defense scored a safety,
stifled the Beavers to 14 net yards rushing (dumping quarterbacks
Endicott and Barton for losses of 72), allowed but 166 offensive
yards, picked off four passes and forced seven punts.
And if you're looking for individual stars, count nearly the whole
46* man travelling squad.
