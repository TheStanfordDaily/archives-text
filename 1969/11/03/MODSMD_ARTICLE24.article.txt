## SC Dumps Stanford 
### 
Stanford's water polo team lost
almost any chance of qualifying
for the NCAA championships

Friday when thev lost to USC,
5-4.
The Indians now have a 10-5
record, but unfortunately three of
the five losses have come in league
play where the Indians have failed
to win a game.
In Friday's game played at
Stanford, the Indians made a fine
comeback to tie up the game in
the final period, but USC scored
the final and winning goal with
less than two minutes remaining
in the game.
The Stanford team which had
been greatly handicapped by
injuries all last week, suffered
another bad break on Friday
when veteran star Kevin Eagleston
suffered torn ligaments in his
shoulder. Eagleston will probably
not be able to see any more action
this season.
On Saturday the Indians fought
back from Friday's disappointing
loss to defeat University of the
Pacific, 8-5.
