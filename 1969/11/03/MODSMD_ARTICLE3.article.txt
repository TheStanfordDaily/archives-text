# Nairobi College Opens Drive; Collects Textbooks, Donations
## 
### 
Nairobi College, a volunteer,
community-organized school in
East Palo Atlo, launched its
two-week book drive yesterday.
The newly-opened independent
college was created by East Palo
Alto educators and citizens. The
school needs contributions of
money and books to expand its
programs and facilities.
The goal of Nairobi College is
to "develop and train leaders for
Third World communities" in East
Palo Alto and the Bay Area.
Hopefully the fifty stud .its now
attending classes at the college are
just beginning to benefit from the
self-help approach to which the
school is dedicated.
Rejecting the idea of the
traditional "college campus,"
Nairobi holds classes in private
homes, garages, and churches
throughout East Palo Alto.
Direct Social Involvement
A 1 Nelson, a student at the new
school, suggested at the meeting

of Stanford Representatives for
the book drive that, "a campus
frequently barracades student*,
from the surrounding
community."
Much of the educatior offered
at the college is to be uind in
direct social involvement. Eat 1
student must spent a minimum .112
four hours daily working for
service organizations "such s
health centers and legal aid
agencies."
No tuition fees are charged at
Nairobi and it has of yet no
wealthy alumni to fund its
operations. Consequently, there is
no library and no money to pay
the volunteer academic
instructors.
Many Nairobi students cannot
afford books for their classes.
Hundreds of volumes have already
been pledged by universities, high
schools and public libraries.
R eps Throughout C.ampti*
There are three ways for

individuals to donate books
during the next two weeks.
Representatives are in every donn,
row house and fraternity
collecting contributions from
campus residents. Off-campus
students, faculty and staff my
deposit books and donations at a
table set up near the Post Office
on White Plaza. There is a free
pick up service for donations from
outside the Stanford community.
All kinds of books are
welcome. Nairobi students and
faculty will select the books they
can use at the end of the drive and
they will sell the remainder to buy
new books.
To be successful, the book
drive must enlist hundreds of
students to help with
tra nspoita ti on, telephoning,
leafletting and secretarial work.
The book drive headquarters are
in Manzanita Park.
