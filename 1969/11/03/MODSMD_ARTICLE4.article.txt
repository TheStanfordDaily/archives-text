# Low Attendence Mars Moratorium Meeting
## 
### MARIAN JOHNSTOM 
Vietnam Moratorium called a
community meeting last night to
discuss future activity. The meeting
which began with unscheduled
guerilla theater never arrived at a
consensus and the audience
displayed more devisiveness than
community spirit.
The audience was rather small,
never exceeding 250 and
dwidling as the evening
progressed, but leaders of the
Moratorium attribute this more to
general approval of the direction
the Moratorium is headed than to
lack of interest or dissatisfaction.
The activities which the group
decided to support include a
march to the Industrial Park on
November 14, in connection with
the Palo Alto Concerned Citizens.
Proposals to extend the march to
the Pittsburgh-Des Moines steel
strike or Coyote Hill were tabled.
The one resolution which
passed unanimously and without
discussion did reaffim the original
demand for immediate withdrawal
of American forces from Vietnam.
This seems to indicate that
members are still united behind
the idea of the Moratorium if not
on specific tactics.
Other resolutions ratified only
after extensive discussion and
amendment supported the right of
Stanford employees to participate
in the Moratorium without
penalty and reaffirmed the
non-partisan nature of the
Moratorium.
Prevailing Theme
The prevailing theme was to
encourage "individual action."
There was generally agreement to
encourage participation in the
various activities already planned
by anti-war groups. A press
conference at 11 this morning in
White Plaza will predict Nixon's
Vietnam speech. Nixon-watching
parties will be held tonight and a
convocation with East Asian
expert Franz Schurmann
tomorrow night at 8 in Memorial
Church will evaluate Nixon's
speech. Also scheduled are
continuation of leafleting and
canvassing November 13 and 14, a
march to Stanford Industrial Park
at noon on he fourteenth, and a
march and rally in San Francisco
on November 1 5.
Just as co-chairman Pat Shea
was opening the meeting in

Memorial Church and describing
the Moratorium as "mobilizing
support at the grass roots level," a
troupe of eight actors entered
down the center aisle. They
portrayed the trial of the Chicago
8, including a gagged and shackled
"Bobby Seale."
Support of Employees
After a brief pause, the meeting
continued, and the wide range of
political differences was evidenced
by the discussion. The meeting
first considered a resolution
supporting the right of Stanford
employees to take off from work
to participate in the Moratorium.
Opinions voiced ranged from
encouraging "individual action"
to demanding a "Moratorium
work holiday with full pay." An
amended resolution calling for
employees to have "equal rights
with students and faculty to
suspend work activity without
penalty" passed by a 3-to-l vote.
Next the Moratorium
reaffirmed unanimously and
without debate "its stand for
immediate withdrawal of all
United States military and civilian
personnel and supplies from
Vietnam."
Finally, the group ratified a
resolution not to lend the
Stanford Moratorium's support to
any political parties or candidates.
A Growing Split
Discussion then turned to the
San Francisco march and rally on
November 15 sponsored by the
New Mobilization Committee to
End the War in Vietnam and the
Student Mobilization Committee
(SMC). Sharon Cabaniss of SMC
described the set of speakers, but
was contradicted by Doug
Mattern who said that the New
Mobilization planned to limit the
rally to three or four speakers.
San Francisco papers in the last
week have described a growing
split between anti-war groups, and
co-chairman Martin Perl pleased,
"We have no time for these things.
Every bit of our energies should
be devoted to making some dent
in the enormous, powerful, and
clever opposition." And Lennie
Siegel broke the tension with his
explanation of the true planning
group, "meeting at 11 a.m. in
Sebastopol." He suggested, "We
get on with our own planning and
table this discussion."
Various proposals for the

coming month were then
presented, but no consensus on
priorities for action was reached.
Art Bushkin, a Lockheed
employee, explained a statement
that Peninsula Moratorium
Committee is distributing to
managements asking them to
recognize that "it is an inalienable
American right to express one's
political views in a responsible
manner without fear of reprisal,"
and to permit employees to
participate in the Moratorium.
Marches to the Industrial Park
and Stanford Research Institute
were proposed, and the wife of a
striking steel worker pleaded for
support of the Pittsbur|*h-Des
Moines steel strike. Doug Mattern
announced that Concerned
Citizens in Palo Alto was
sponsoring a march to the
Industrial Park on the 14th.
The group later voted to
support the march, but a motion
to include support for the
Pittsburgh-Des Moines steel strike
was tabled. A motion to distribute
leaflets supporting the strike with
the signature of the Vietnam
Moratorium was made and then
withdrawn. And a motion to
extend the march to the site of a
industrial park, Coyote Hill, was
also tabled. The group remaining
was too small and opinions were
too divided to continue the
discussion.
MIC
In a meeting earlier yesterday,
the New University Conference
discussed proposed November
Moratorium actions, and made
plans to extend the scope of its
own activities.
No definite action was taken
concerning the Moratorium, but
plans were formulated for
involvement in the current faculty
salary dispute.
The group voted to distribute a
petition among faculty (including
TA's) and staff members stating
that the individual does not
consider publishing his salary as
an invasion of privacy.
It then leaves room for name,
department, position and salary of
the individual. About 15 names
were collected at the meeting.
Discussion also centered on
NUC action concerning the
"Chicago Eight" trial.
