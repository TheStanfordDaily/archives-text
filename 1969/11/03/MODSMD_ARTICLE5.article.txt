# Policemen Arrest Ten In PDM Demonstration
## 
### JULIE ROEMER 
Police from six cities were used
against workers, their families,
and student supporters last Friday
afternoon. Numerous people were
beaten and 10 were arrested for
participating in a demonstration
supporting the strike at
Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel
Company (PDM) in Santa Clara.
The police said that it was
necessary to use riot batons to
subdue demonstrators attacking
them.
For a while, Friday's
demonstration looked like others
that have been held at PDM since
the strike began on Sept. 1. Four
strikers of Steelworkers local
4028 (the union is limited by a
court injunction to 2 groups of 2
pickets 10 feet apart) walked
slowly across the driveway as
strikebreakers left the plant on
their way home. Police lined the
driveway, keeping about 80

people—workers from other plants
and students—from interfering
with traffic.
Then a strikebreaker's car
brushed a picket. The picket,
dropping his sign on the car, leapt
out of the way as the driver
floored his accelerator. Police
moved immediately to arrest the
picketer, and began to swing their
clubs as people moved to defend
him. Several supporters were
singled out and chased down
Lafayette St., which crosses the
front of the plant. Squad cars
began to move in and police
continued chasing and beating
people for 20 minutes.
By then, they had arrested 10
people (4 PDM workers and 6
supporters, one a Stanford
student). All arrested were
charged with misdemeanors.
Felony assault charges were added
to four of them later.
Nine of those arrested were

released on bail totaling $10,000
early Friday evening. Che of
them, a high school student, was
detained in the Santa Clara jail for
interrogation until 1:00
a.m.—even though his parents had
been notified by police that he
had been sent immediately to
juvenile hall.
Supporters of the strike
speculated that the police
crackdown in Santa Clara may
have been prompted by the
decision of the PDM plant in
Sacramento to go on strike on
Monday.
The Stanford SDS Labor
Committee has announced plans
to participate in another
demonstration supporting the
strike on Tuesday afternoon. A
carpool will leave from the
Tresidder parking lot at 3:30 p.m.
SDS is also encouraging
supporters to contribute food to
the striking families.
