# Environmental Law Society To Sue Over Coyote Hill
## 
### 
The fight to stop the
industrialization of the top of
Coyote Hill will take a dramatic
turn this week when
conservationists file a complaint
against Stanford University in
Santa Clara County Superior
Court. According to Robert Mark,
acting President of the Stanford
Conservation Group, the
complaint will seek to establish
the illegality of the present
sub-divisions on Coyote Hill.
The lawsuit is being prepared
by members of the newly formed
Environmental Law Society of
Stanford, led by law student
David Jackman. It will name as
defendants Stanford University,
the City of Palo Alto, City
Councilmen Frank Gallagher and
Jack Wheatley, and City Planning
Officer Louis Fourcroy.

It will be filed in the name of
all the residents of Palo Alto, Los
Altos Hills, and neighboring
communities as represented by a
still unnamed plaintiff. The
plaintiff, to be either an individual
or a conservation group, will be
announced sometime this week.
The purpose of the suit is to
insure that Stanford will follow its
stated intentions of developing a
golf course and of keeping the top
of Coyote Hill open. The present
sub-division plans do not reflect
these intentions.
It will seek to void the
sub-division because of faulty
approval procedures and to
establish a "conflict of interest"
in the votes of Gallagher and
Whoatley in the City Council
decision of Sept. H that gave
initial 5 to 4 approval of the
sub-division.

Gallagher is director of housing
for married students at Stanford
and Wheatley, partner in a large
contracting firm, has said he is
negotiating a construction
contract for a potential tenant of
the sub-division.
The suit also alleges that
planning officer Fourcroy failed
to report the filing, in August,
1968, of the land division
application from Stanford. It
charges he did not report the
application for nine months,
violating the city municipal code,
which requires monthly reports of
new applications.
The present sub-divisions
include 12 acres that are zoned
for light industry and slated for
development as an animal research
center. A Syntex corporation
proposal for the foothill area calls
for the joint development of the

research center by Syntex and the
Medical School. Other light
industries are feasible under the
present zoning regulations.
Several alternative proposals for
the Coyote Hill area have been
discussed by the conservationists.
They include the golf course, a
30-acre, open space natural park
dedicated to the city of Palo Alto,
a system of bicycle riding and
hiking trails along the creek at the
top of the hill and throughout the
Stanford lands, and a separate
park for the Stanford community.
Mark emphasizes the
importance of this park. The
Stanford community, he says, has
over 15,000 people, yet not one
park for its own needs The
athletic fields and arboretum that
now exist are not sufficient, he
claims.
