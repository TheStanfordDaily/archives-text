1 The Stanford Daily's Tuesday
(Oct. 29) editorial on the current
jaculty pay controversy was
■entitled "Academic Freedom?"
"The title as well as the contents of
that editorial seriously
miscomprehend the controversy
surrounding the relatively large
differentials in Stanford faculty
salaries.
I The Daily presented to its
wders only the fact that
Stanford professors are paid in
different amounts, depending
upon discipline, rank and, in some
instances, concentration, i.e.,
research versus teaching. Its
conclusion from this fact alone
was: Stanford University practices
salary discriminations—" . . .if you
can teach, don't come here. You
might go bankrupt."
A proper analysis of the salary
differentials recognizes that
faculty pay levels are established
by supply and demand conditions.
Some disciplines are unique to an
institution of higher learning and
have highly limited utilization
outside the university in
government or in industry.
A Renaissance history professor
or a Shakespearean scholar faces
little demand for his intellectual
talents outside the teaching field.
Does American Motors have or
need a vice president in charge of
history and literature, for
example? Contrast this with the
myriad of positions for engineers,
scientists, economists,
researchers—to list only several
occupational alternatives open to
many Stanford faculty-in
industry and government.
Additional instances of strong
outside demand for professors in
certain study areas can be cited.
Medical school professors could
just as easily be private
practitioners, law professors by
law firm partners, business school
professors be company managers.
Implicit in this statement is the
view that a major university offers
a wide range of study areas,
including the sciences and
professional schools as well as the
humanities.

Similarly, demand factors
affect the teacher versus
researcher identity. Government
and industry in their self-interests
support research heavily. Such
support means the university
researcher is probably better paid
than the non-researcher because
of this outside wealth. The need
in government and industry for
research personnal combined with
the like need in universities,
inclduing Stanford, yield a
demand far in excess of available
supply. There would appear to be
no comparable excess demand for
university teachers.
The Daily's fact that Stanford
professors are paid in different
amounts is, in essence, nothing
more than a relection of the price
mechanism working in a
competitive market. Industry and
government compete strongly
with the university in particular
occupational areas, while not at
all in others. The university, in
order to attract and keep faculty
in these areas and thereby
maintain a balance in disciplines,
must therefore pay the "going
rate." This "going rate" is
necessarily higher for some
professors than for others.
If Stanford University had
unlimited funds, it could pay all
faculty in excess of the highest
"going rate" for any single faculty
member. Unfortunately, Stanford
not only does not have unlimited
funds but also faces strong
competition for existing limited
funds. If the current budget
cannot provide sufficient enough
funds for minority groups
programs, sorely needed
dormitory expansion and the
necessary building of academic
facilities, then the University does
not have funds to pay faculty
members in excess of their "going
rates," let alone all of them in
excess of the highest "going rate."
Essentially, our disagreement is
with the Daily in its failure to
present a proper analysis of the
faculty pay differentials involved
in the current controversy. The
Daily neglected to recognize other
relevant issues, such as outside
consulting time of self-purported
''teachers.'' Certainly,
unjustifiable salary discrimination
may exist at Stanford. The
revelation of differentials in salary
is not conclusive proof of such
discrimination per se.
