# Pat's Fantasy World
## Mihaly Propaganda 
### David Axelrad 
, Patricia Mihaly drifts ever
'farther from the truth as she
in an ever more classical
•style of propaganda. (Daily, Oct.
!28). One or two examples will
•suffice to reveal the fantasy world
in which she thinks.
In her most recent article Miss
Mihaly states that Arabs who fled
Israel at the time of its creation
lost much valuable property for
which they have never been
reimbursed. In a style typical of
inflammatory propaganda she has
stopped with only half the truth.
In 1948 large numbers of Arabs
did leave Israel at the insistence of
surrounding Arab leaders who
promised swift destruction of the
Jews. Certainly these individuals
sacrificed much property.
Recognizing this situation the new
Israeli government immediately
appointed a Custodian of
Abandoned Property to
administer all land lost by the
Arabs as a result of the 1948 war.
The property is now held by
the Israeli government outside the
public domain for the express
purpose of paying restitution
when a peace treaty is signed.
Indeed, any Israeli using any
portion of this property must pay
rental to a special restitution fund
administered by the Custodian.
The cruel irony is that Israel is
prevented by the Arab
governments from paying this
restitution. Most who fled in 1948
are trapped in refugee camps,
living in merciless limbo as
political pawns of the Arabs. Until
there is peace Israel cannot repay
these people who are cut off from
the world.
Jewish Anti-Zionists
More grevous and heartbreaking
are Miss Mihaly's foolish
references to Jewish anti-Zionists.
Of course there are Jews who hate
Israel, who wish to disassociate
themselves from their past and
their present. There are Jews who
seek to assimilate themselves,
deny their identity, and blend
uneasily into their surrounding
communities. But, Miss Mihaly,
these people are really no longer
Jewish in their minds and hearts;

for to hate what is indeed the
heritage you are part of is to
suffer the self-immolation of
self-hatred.
I suppose we can really expect
no more than we have received
from Miss Mihaly. Those who
commit themselves to irrational
fantasies must always justify
themselves through falsehoods
and twisted facts. To do any more
is to come dangerously close to the
truth. Perhaps Miss Mihaly and
others will continue the tirades.
But they will matter little. Those
who look carefully will see the
method and intention behind this
kind of argument and will then
pity its advocates.

•suffice to reveal the fantasy world
in which she thinks.
In her most recent article Miss
Mihaly states that Arabs who fled
Israel at the time of its creation
lost much valuable property for
which they have never been
reimbursed. In a style typical of
inflammatory propaganda she has
stopped with only half the truth.
In 1948 large numbers of Arabs
did leave Israel at the insistence of
surrounding Arab leaders who
promised swift destruction of the
Jews. Certainly these individuals
sacrificed much property.
Recognizing this situation the new
Israeli government immediately
appointed a Custodian of
Abandoned Property to
administer all land lost by the
Arabs as a result of the 1948 war.
The property is now held by
the Israeli government outside the
public domain for the express
purpose of paying restitution
when a peace treaty is signed.
Indeed, any Israeli using any
portion of this property must pay
rental to a special restitution fund
administered by the Custodian.
The cruel irony is that Israel is
prevented by the Arab
governments from paying this
restitution. Most who fled in 1948
are trapped in refugee camps,
living in merciless limbo as
political pawns of the Arabs. Until
there is peace Israel cannot repay
these people who are cut off from
the world.
Jewish Anti-Zionists
More grevous and heartbreaking
are Miss Mihaly's foolish
references to Jewish anti-Zionists.
Of course there are Jews who hate
Israel, who wish to disassociate
themselves from their past and
their present. There are Jews who
seek to assimilate themselves,
deny their identity, and blend
uneasily into their surrounding
communities. But, Miss Mihaly,
these people are really no longer
Jewish in their minds and hearts;

for to hate what is indeed the
heritage you are part of is to
suffer the self-immolation of
self-hatred.
I suppose we can really expect
no more than we have received
from Miss Mihaly. Those who
commit themselves to irrational
fantasies must always justify
themselves through falsehoods
and twisted facts. To do any more
is to come dangerously close to the
truth. Perhaps Miss Mihaly and
others will continue the tirades.
But they will matter little. Those
who look carefully will see the
method and intention behind this
kind of argument and will then
pity its advocates.
