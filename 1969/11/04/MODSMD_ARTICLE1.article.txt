# Campus Listens To Speech In Silence
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
and JOHN BOWEN
For half an hour last night,
Stanford was silent.
Clustered around televisions,
faculty members and students all
over campus listened to Richard
Nixon give his much-heralded
address to the nation. Some
snickered, some laughed, some
nodded—almost all heard him out
patiently.
When Nixon finished, a
collective, quiet sigh came from
the eighty people crowded into
Roble's basement, mingled with
several grunts of disdain and
disgust. One student buried his
head briefly in his arms.
On the stair landing, another
student cynically remarked, "He's
done it again." Nixon had once
more played his trump card in
appealing to the silent majority.
"Unless President Nixon
chooses to change the course of
the American war, he's going to
have to face a majority of very
frustrated citizens, young and old
alike," said Pat Shea, a member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents,
in reaction to Nixon's speech.
"The speech was geared to a
fifth-grade audience," said Barry

Askinas, another member of the
Council of Presidents. "Nixon said
nothing new.
"The silent majority is going to
be satisfied," Askinas added. "The
articulate minority is going to be
upset and angry. He's trying to
lump all opposition into one camp
of misinformed idealism."
Echoing through many
comments on Nixon's speech was
one theme—there's nothing new.
"There should be substantial
repercussions because he didn't
say anything new," said Robert
Chase, executive head of the
surgery department at the
Stanford Medical Center.
"Substantial Gamble"
Chase termed the President's
pitch to the "silent majority" a
"substantial gamble."
Milorad Drachkovitch, a senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution,
said that the crucial question was
"whether the President is right in
thinking that there is a silent
majority to which he can appeal. I
personally think there is."
Mike Kuhl, president of the
California College Republicans,
had this reaction:
"Nixon reiterated the sort of
gutsy stand that brought him the

support of the silent majority in
his campaign.
"Right And Left"
"As a result, it is not going to
appease his constant critics on the
right and left. Instead he offers an
unequivocal stance for his
staunchest supporters."
Among a large group of
students in the I-Center lounge, a
few expressed support for Nixon's
position. A student who had been
a refuge from Hungary in 1956
said that "Nixon was right.
"America does stand for peace
and freedom [in the conflict],"
he said.
One Japanese-American student
stated he was "disappointed." His
reaction was shared by many.
Professors Sanford Dornbusch,
sociology, and Martin Perl, SLAC,
both faculty leaders within the
Moratorium, said that they were
"very disappointed" with the
President's remarks.
"Passive Coalition" Appeal
David W. Jones, Jr., editor of
Peacemonger, the Moratorium
newspaper, commented that
"Nixon's statements concerning
students were not aimed at
students so much as at those who

are fed up with students. He is
appealing to a passive coalition
that only appears once every four
years at the polls ... He spoke to
no-one."
"What Nixon said is
tremendously bad news for the
country," said John Kramer, West
Coast co-ordinator of the Vietnam
Moratorium. "For the country
and for Vietnam," he added.
"The rigidity of his position,
that he afforded nothing new,
can't help but rekindle dwindling
spirit and commitment among
Moratorium supporters."
"Highly Pleased"
Mike Wolf, president of the
Stanford chapter of the Young
Republicans, had a different
reaction. Wolf was "highly pleased
with Mr. Nixon's eloquent
statement, despite a few political
touch-up motions."
"I support his policy, a policy
of gradual withdrawal without
further concessions to the
enemy," Wolf said.
"What Nixon left unsaid was
more important than what he did
say," was the view of Arjay Miller,
dean of the graduate school of
business.
"I don't think we have heard
the fin;<l position on Vietnam, for
the remainder of this year."
'The speech didn't live up to
its build up," Miller added.
At over a hundred different
locations around Palo Alto and
Los Altos, small groups of
stud nts, professors, and
community residents met to hear
and discuss the President's speech.
Reaction of Disbelief
Professor Martin Carnoy,
education, said that the reaction
of the fifteen people, "many on
their forties and fifties," who met
in the house of a Republican

resident of Los Altos, was "one of
disbelief."
"Nixon didn't say anything,"
said Carnoy. "He's trying to tell
people he has a secret plan."
Jim Schneider, president of the
Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC), said from his
seat on the floor of the student
Senate that he "shared many of
the President's concerns.
Unilateral Cease-Fire
"As an individual," he
continued, "I would like to see an
immediate unilateral cease-fire,
with the U.S. looking for an
international means for resolving
the issue."
Further reactions:
Askinas: "The speech gets
through to the same people that
Agnew gets through to . . . there
was nothing in it for people
concerned about a quick peace."
Miller: "The 'silent majority' is
questionable. Polls show various
different majorities. The speech
didn't live up to its build-up.
Shea: "I find it extremely
difficult to maintain a
'responsible' attitude toward
action, when my seemingly
responsible actions have not had
one iota of effect on American
foreign policy."
Daily editor Mark Weinberger:
". . . we are due for more of the
same errors and misconceptions
that dragged us into this national
catastrophe .. . Nixon has
responded with a 'plan' that he
once again refuses to define."
Jones: "The real issues of
policemanship and Adminstration
determinization of foreign
countries has been
ignored . . . Locating his support
in the 'silent majority' indicates
that Agnew has been speaking for
him."

TOYON RAP—A few students got together alter Nixon's Vietnam speech last
night to discuss the President's thoughts. Reactions ranged from laughter to
jeers, thoughtful silence to anger.
and JOHN BOWEN
For half an hour last night,
Stanford was silent.
Clustered around televisions,
faculty members and students all
over campus listened to Richard
Nixon give his much-heralded
address to the nation. Some
snickered, some laughed, some
nodded—almost all heard him out
patiently.
When Nixon finished, a
collective, quiet sigh came from
the eighty people crowded into
Roble's basement, mingled with
several grunts of disdain and
disgust. One student buried his
head briefly in his arms.
On the stair landing, another
student cynically remarked, "He's
done it again." Nixon had once
more played his trump card in
appealing to the silent majority.
"Unless President Nixon
chooses to change the course of
the American war, he's going to
have to face a majority of very
frustrated citizens, young and old
alike," said Pat Shea, a member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents,
in reaction to Nixon's speech.
"The speech was geared to a
fifth-grade audience," said Barry

Askinas, another member of the
Council of Presidents. "Nixon said
nothing new.
"The silent majority is going to
be satisfied," Askinas added. "The
articulate minority is going to be
upset and angry. He's trying to
lump all opposition into one camp
of misinformed idealism."
Echoing through many
comments on Nixon's speech was
one theme—there's nothing new.
"There should be substantial
repercussions because he didn't
say anything new," said Robert
Chase, executive head of the
surgery department at the
Stanford Medical Center.
"Substantial Gamble"
Chase termed the President's
pitch to the "silent majority" a
"substantial gamble."
Milorad Drachkovitch, a senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution,
said that the crucial question was
"whether the President is right in
thinking that there is a silent
majority to which he can appeal. I
personally think there is."
Mike Kuhl, president of the
California College Republicans,
had this reaction:
"Nixon reiterated the sort of
gutsy stand that brought him the

support of the silent majority in
his campaign.
"Right And Left"
"As a result, it is not going to
appease his constant critics on the
right and left. Instead he offers an
unequivocal stance for his
staunchest supporters."
Among a large group of
students in the I-Center lounge, a
few expressed support for Nixon's
position. A student who had been
a refuge from Hungary in 1956
said that "Nixon was right.
"America does stand for peace
and freedom [in the conflict],"
he said.
One Japanese-American student
stated he was "disappointed." His
reaction was shared by many.
Professors Sanford Dornbusch,
sociology, and Martin Perl, SLAC,
both faculty leaders within the
Moratorium, said that they were
"very disappointed" with the
President's remarks.
"Passive Coalition" Appeal
David W. Jones, Jr., editor of
Peacemonger, the Moratorium
newspaper, commented that
"Nixon's statements concerning
students were not aimed at
students so much as at those who

are fed up with students. He is
appealing to a passive coalition
that only appears once every four
years at the polls ... He spoke to
no-one."
"What Nixon said is
tremendously bad news for the
country," said John Kramer, West
Coast co-ordinator of the Vietnam
Moratorium. "For the country
and for Vietnam," he added.
"The rigidity of his position,
that he afforded nothing new,
can't help but rekindle dwindling
spirit and commitment among
Moratorium supporters."
"Highly Pleased"
Mike Wolf, president of the
Stanford chapter of the Young
Republicans, had a different
reaction. Wolf was "highly pleased
with Mr. Nixon's eloquent
statement, despite a few political
touch-up motions."
"I support his policy, a policy
of gradual withdrawal without
further concessions to the
enemy," Wolf said.
"What Nixon left unsaid was
more important than what he did
say," was the view of Arjay Miller,
dean of the graduate school of
business.
"I don't think we have heard
the fin;<l position on Vietnam, for
the remainder of this year."
'The speech didn't live up to
its build up," Miller added.
At over a hundred different
locations around Palo Alto and
Los Altos, small groups of
stud nts, professors, and
community residents met to hear
and discuss the President's speech.
Reaction of Disbelief
Professor Martin Carnoy,
education, said that the reaction
of the fifteen people, "many on
their forties and fifties," who met
in the house of a Republican

resident of Los Altos, was "one of
disbelief."
"Nixon didn't say anything,"
said Carnoy. "He's trying to tell
people he has a secret plan."
Jim Schneider, president of the
Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC), said from his
seat on the floor of the student
Senate that he "shared many of
the President's concerns.
Unilateral Cease-Fire
"As an individual," he
continued, "I would like to see an
immediate unilateral cease-fire,
with the U.S. looking for an
international means for resolving
the issue."
Further reactions:
Askinas: "The speech gets
through to the same people that
Agnew gets through to . . . there
was nothing in it for people
concerned about a quick peace."
Miller: "The 'silent majority' is
questionable. Polls show various

'The speech didn't live up to
its build up," Miller added.
At over a hundred different
locations around Palo Alto and
Los Altos, small groups of
stud nts, professors, and
community residents met to hear
and discuss the President's speech.
Reaction of Disbelief
Professor Martin Carnoy,
education, said that the reaction
of the fifteen people, "many on
their forties and fifties," who met
in the house of a Republican

resident of Los Altos, was "one of
disbelief."
"Nixon didn't say anything,"
said Carnoy. "He's trying to tell
people he has a secret plan."
Jim Schneider, president of the
Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC), said from his
seat on the floor of the student
Senate that he "shared many of
the President's concerns.
Unilateral Cease-Fire
"As an individual," he
continued, "I would like to see an
immediate unilateral cease-fire,
with the U.S. looking for an
international means for resolving
the issue."
Further reactions:
Askinas: "The speech gets
through to the same people that
Agnew gets through to . . . there
was nothing in it for people
concerned about a quick peace."
Miller: "The 'silent majority' is
questionable. Polls show various
different majorities. The speech
didn't live up to its build-up.
Shea: "I find it extremely
difficult to maintain a
'responsible' attitude toward
action, when my seemingly
responsible actions have not had
one iota of effect on American
foreign policy."
Daily editor Mark Weinberger:
". . . we are due for more of the
same errors and misconceptions
that dragged us into this national
catastrophe .. . Nixon has
responded with a 'plan' that he
once again refuses to define."
Jones: "The real issues of
policemanship and Adminstration
determinization of foreign
countries has been
ignored . . . Locating his support
in the 'silent majority' indicates
that Agnew has been speaking for
him."

TOYON RAP—A few students got together alter Nixon's Vietnam speech last
night to discuss the President's thoughts. Reactions ranged from laughter to
jeers, thoughtful silence to anger.
and JOHN BOWEN
For half an hour last night,
Stanford was silent.
Clustered around televisions,
faculty members and students all
over campus listened to Richard
Nixon give his much-heralded
address to the nation. Some
snickered, some laughed, some
nodded—almost all heard him out
patiently.
When Nixon finished, a
collective, quiet sigh came from
the eighty people crowded into
Roble's basement, mingled with
several grunts of disdain and
disgust. One student buried his
head briefly in his arms.
On the stair landing, another
student cynically remarked, "He's
done it again." Nixon had once
more played his trump card in
appealing to the silent majority.
"Unless President Nixon
chooses to change the course of
the American war, he's going to
have to face a majority of very
frustrated citizens, young and old
alike," said Pat Shea, a member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents,
in reaction to Nixon's speech.
"The speech was geared to a
fifth-grade audience," said Barry

Askinas, another member of the
Council of Presidents. "Nixon said
nothing new.
"The silent majority is going to
be satisfied," Askinas added. "The
articulate minority is going to be
upset and angry. He's trying to
lump all opposition into one camp
of misinformed idealism."
Echoing through many
comments on Nixon's speech was
one theme—there's nothing new.
"There should be substantial
repercussions because he didn't
say anything new," said Robert
Chase, executive head of the
surgery department at the
Stanford Medical Center.
"Substantial Gamble"
Chase termed the President's
pitch to the "silent majority" a
"substantial gamble."
Milorad Drachkovitch, a senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution,
said that the crucial question was
"whether the President is right in
thinking that there is a silent
majority to which he can appeal. I
personally think there is."
Mike Kuhl, president of the
California College Republicans,
had this reaction:
"Nixon reiterated the sort of
gutsy stand that brought him the

support of the silent majority in
his campaign.
"Right And Left"
"As a result, it is not going to
appease his constant critics on the
right and left. Instead he offers an
unequivocal stance for his
staunchest supporters."
Among a large group of
students in the I-Center lounge, a
few expressed support for Nixon's
position. A student who had been
a refuge from Hungary in 1956
said that "Nixon was right.
"America does stand for peace
and freedom [in the conflict],"
he said.
One Japanese-American student
stated he was "disappointed." His
reaction was shared by many.
Professors Sanford Dornbusch,
sociology, and Martin Perl, SLAC,
both faculty leaders within the
Moratorium, said that they were
"very disappointed" with the
President's remarks.
"Passive Coalition" Appeal
David W. Jones, Jr., editor of
Peacemonger, the Moratorium
newspaper, commented that
"Nixon's statements concerning
students were not aimed at
students so much as at those who

are fed up with students. He is
appealing to a passive coalition
that only appears once every four
years at the polls ... He spoke to
no-one."
"What Nixon said is
tremendously bad news for the
country," said John Kramer, West
Coast co-ordinator of the Vietnam
Moratorium. "For the country
and for Vietnam," he added.
"The rigidity of his position,
that he afforded nothing new,
can't help but rekindle dwindling
spirit and commitment among
Moratorium supporters."
"Highly Pleased"
Mike Wolf, president of the
Stanford chapter of the Young
Republicans, had a different
reaction. Wolf was "highly pleased
with Mr. Nixon's eloquent
statement, despite a few political
touch-up motions."
"I support his policy, a policy
of gradual withdrawal without
further concessions to the
enemy," Wolf said.
"What Nixon left unsaid was
more important than what he did
say," was the view of Arjay Miller,
dean of the graduate school of
business.
"I don't think we have heard
the fin;<l position on Vietnam, for
the remainder of this year."
'The speech didn't live up to
its build up," Miller added.
