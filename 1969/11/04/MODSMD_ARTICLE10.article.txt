# U.S. Radical Movement
## Intellectual Backwardness 
### T.H. Andre 
(First of 2 parts, 2nd part
on Progressive Labour Party.)
The Stanford chapter of SDS
held a meeting of various factions
of the US radical movement
(Monday, Oct. 27); these factions
were called sects in the publicity
leaflets. This carelessness with
words turned out to be only one
instance of a general intellectual
backwardness, wished by these
people themselves.
The exchanges were directed by
Andy Parnes who did two bad
things: He brought in a knave
from Berkeley who covered all
important issues with unnameable
matter out of his mouth, so that
everyone was driven away from
them.
Mr. Parnes wasted people's
time on this drivel and
compounded this with preventing
the only promising exchange to
occur, the defense 'of the
Progressive Labour Party's
position on Vietnam and
nationalism.
Parnes studies economics and

should have known better than to
so misallocate the scarcest
resource of all, our time; but he
does not know any better and
there are reasons for this. These
three groups, the Youth Culture
Movement (of People's Park), the
group of which Parnes is a
specimen, and PL will be
examined here.
For the record, there was there
an anarchist who said he believed
in a community based on
voluntary association. We all
believe in that: "America love it
or leave it." This triviality will not
stir any mind or body.
Then came the one who
became the star of that evening:
From People's Park. It is
embarrassing to think how
favourably the audience
responded to what he had to say.
Part of the fight against the
contemporary social structure is
to provide alternatives that might
break the monopoly on social
activities. The self-sufficient

communities that he (presumably)
stood for are such alternatives-.
But it should be clear that
opting out (in the large sense) is a
necessary but not sufficient
condition for radical progress; far
from sufficient, viz.
schizophrenics. To continue to be
progressive, the members of those
communities must understand the
objective social roles of the
groups they are joining, their
significance as social coalitions
and forces. But this man did not
seem to have any such
understanding: People's Park was
described as "a pile of shovels, a
group of people converging to it,
and the pile disappeared." What
about the university (students),
the police, the residents, the social
context? What about the future
(Many Vietnams, one in San
Francisco)?
As long as they are not aware
of their possible historical role,
the people of the Park will remain
folklore to those who have the
power, like the African or Asian
peasant who is opted out of the
system (by the system), sticks to
his old customs (his thing), and,
for the time being, is as unaware
of his revolutionary possibilities;
very innocuous.
They cannot handle large
groups in thought or in action: "I
can't relate to this at all"; the
"this" happened to be thinking of
wars, misery, human destitution
and deaths, but these realities
were not immediately in the room
then. "Let's break up into small
groups of ten or twelve"; the
world of the child is "spatially
small (the cradle, the events of the
nursery), his units of action are
small in scope and of brief
duration." We support the
Vietnamese just because they are
beautiful people: The strata of

reality and unreality are still only
slightly separated. His thinking for
example, shows traces of magic.
What they call "personalized
liberation" is hedonism, their
ideas on social ideals and actions
are body-talk (viz. LSD liberates).
"Can't Know"
The statement (valid in a sense)
"You can't know what it
[People's Park] was, unless you
were there" became an effective
refusal to communicate, hence to
think, shows a snobbish
parochialism, and is an excuse not
to think out the larger
(non-egoistic) significance of the
Park: because such an awareness
might put demands on their (style
of) life, demands not immediately
physical but moral, not "the
moralistic hassle" but an accepted
imperative.
All ti-ln tellectualism
Behind this narrow-mindedness
is a mindlessness, an
anti-intellectualism that is
radically American, not leftist or
hippie. The predisposed audience
reacted by following the first
sheep and all talked of their
immediate realities (defended
implicitly as "pragmatism"),
which gave occasion to a former
(?) SDS member to go into an
ego-trip. The confusion was again
abated by Mr. Parnes who, having
ushered in the Berkeley angel of
darkness, refused to let any
discussion last long enough to
grow coherent or incoherent. This
narrow horizon, this myopic
pragmatism is characteristic of
infants, quasi-narcisstic: This
socialistic dream is too wet (after
Ferlinghetti). PL deserves greater
attention in this review.
