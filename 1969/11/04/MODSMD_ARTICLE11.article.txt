Secrets Out
Editor, THE DAILY:
The secrets are out. Thank God
for that. The University and the
Political Science Department have
been caught in a clear abuse of the
privilege of secrecy. Yet they have
chosen to threaten and bluster
rather than right the wrongs
committed.
Not content with legal and
sanctimonious bluster, they have
tried to hush the episode up, it
would appear. First they have
prevented the press from printing
any details; second they nearly
succeeded in keeping it out of the
Palo Alto Times. Even when it
appeared on Wednesday, the
contents of the papers were
buried in the last two paragraphs
of the story on page two. If it
were not for your courage, they
might have succeeded in managing
news. Freedom of the press? Not
in a world run by insurance
companies and tort law.
One must assume one of two
reasons determined this petty
action: 1) the abuse has continued
so long that the administration
collectively have forgotten what
honor and integrity are, or 2) they
are aware that not all the files
stolen have been released, and
they are desparately trying to
recapture some of the initiative.
Once again the radicals,
castigated for opening the
gentleman's fly in public, have
shown us his chancres. Right on.

Enjoys Meals
Editor, THE DAILY:
After reading the article
regarding University Food Service
by Marshall Kilduff in the
October 23rd issue, I decided to
put in writing the fact that all

Stanford students do not share
the view of some of the
statements in the article.
My daughter has stated many
times that she really enjoys the
meals served in our residence halls
and has even suggested new ideas
for our meals at home, which she
particularly liked at Stanford. Her
older sister, visiting as a guest, also
commented that the food at
Stanford was much better than
the colleges that she had attended.
It's difficult to believe that
there is a lack of imagination and
consideration when foreign food
buffets and special dinners are
often served. I personally visited
an outdoor barbeque in which the
salads, steaks and decorations
were outstanding.
I certainly believe that the
so-called 4 ' b u r e aucratic
organization of the Food Service"
is trying to fill the needs of
students in offering the open meal
transfer and meal options which is
a recent major innovation.

/Vever-Ending Problem
Editor, THE DAILY:
The lack of adequate single and
married student housing seems
destined to be a never-ending
problem at Stanford. We
obviously have the land for such
housing but not the capital outlay
required for construction. Why
then doesn't Stanford lease some
of its land to one of the newly
formed investment firms that
specializes in building permanent
student housing which they rent
at rates that are competitive with
existing room fees?
These firms can construct such
housing in less than a year (even
with red tile roofs) and without
any capital outlay by Stanford.
The resulting housing would be
ready for next fall, would be

located on campus, would remove
a number of administrative
burdens from the University and
might eventually permit us to
return to the status of a residence
university. Vacancies in this type
of residence could also be made
available to university employees
who desire low cost campus
housing.
Such a plan places any
attendant risks on the investors
rather than on either the
University (through its capital) or
the students (through a
continuing lack of housing). I
challenge Stanford to ask for bids
on this type of projectâ€”who
knows, private enterprise might
surprise us all!
