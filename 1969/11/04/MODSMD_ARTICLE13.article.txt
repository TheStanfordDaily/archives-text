# Shockley Calls For Research On Racial Genetic Differences
## 
### JOHN JOHNSTON 
A major controversy has
erupted in the National Academy
of Sciences (NAS), over Nobel
Laureate Dr. William Shockley's
call for more research on genetic
differences between races.
Dr. Shockley, currently
teaching at Stanford, won a
significant victory in his nearly
four-yearlong campaign to
persuade the academy to launch a
major study of this topic
especially with regard to
intelligence. A special committee
was set up to study Dr. Shockley's
resolution at the fall meeting of
the scientific society. However,
opposition to his proposals
remains strong.
In answer to questions about
his views, Dr. Shockley has said,
"My position is not that all
Negroes are inferior to all whites;
instead I do believe that many
Negroes are superior to many
whites. In fact, my statistical

studies show that American
Negroes achieve almost every
eminent distinction that whites
achieve and are about 50% more
successful per capita in winning
Olympic medals.
"However, so far as distinction
dependent upon mental powers is
concerned, the probability on a
per capita basis is between 10 and
100 times smaller for Negroes
than for the national average and
it is this probability that I fear is
falling as a result of the high birth
rates of the most disadvantaged."
In other words, those people
with the lowest IQ are producing
offspring at a faster rate than the
more intelligent people because of
the encouragement by our welfare
system to raise large families. As
these people multiply, they
consitute ever-increasing
percentages of the whole Negro
population.
The result is that the average IQ
of the whole population
decreases. The Negro hereditary
potential for intelligence is being
lowered so that "the result may
be a form of genetic enslavement
that may provoke extremes of
racism with resultant misery for
all our citizens."
Few scholars dispute Dr.
Shockley's arguments, except the
exact genetic effect on
intelligence. This may be cleared
up with more research, precisely
what Dr. Shockley is advocating.
Yet popular opposition to the
doctor's ideas continue. The
Stanford Genetics Department has

used such words as "malice,"
"mischief," "psuedoscience," and
"hackneyed" in reference to these
ideas as they were expressed in a
US News & World Report
interview with Dr. Shockley.
However, the chairman of the
Committee on Science and Public
Policy of the NAS commented,
"If the statement [in the
interview] about mean white and
nonwhite IQ's did not have such
touchy implications, it probably
would have remained
unnoticed ... I am afraid at this
point that any study, no matter
how objectively conducted, with
which your name is in any way
associated will henceforth be
doomed to attack as being
'racist'."
Last week at Dartmouth
College 30 black students
prevented Dr. Shockley from
delivering a paper by
demonstrations in the auditorium.
Dr. Shockley deplores the
"wishful thinking rather than
sound diagnosis" of his colleagues.
He feels that "to fail to raise these
unpopular questions because of
fear of the resentment towards me
that might ensue is an
irresponsibility that I am not
willing to have on my conscience.
"I believe and hope that my
determination to see that these
questions are faced and answered
may be the greatest contribution
anyone can make to American
Negro welfare for thy next
generation."

100 times smaller for Negroes
than for the national average and
it is this probability that I fear is
falling as a result of the high birth
rates of the most disadvantaged."
In other words, those people
with the lowest IQ are producing
offspring at a faster rate than the
more intelligent people because of
the encouragement by our welfare
system to raise large families. As
these people multiply, they
consitute ever-increasing
percentages of the whole Negro
population.
The result is that the average IQ
of the whole population
decreases. The Negro hereditary
potential for intelligence is being
lowered so that "the result may
be a form of genetic enslavement
that may provoke extremes of
racism with resultant misery for
all our citizens."
Few scholars dispute Dr.
Shockley's arguments, except the
exact genetic effect on
intelligence. This may be cleared
up with more research, precisely
what Dr. Shockley is advocating.
Yet popular opposition to the
doctor's ideas continue. The
Stanford Genetics Department has

used such words as "malice,"
"mischief," "psuedoscience," and
"hackneyed" in reference to these
ideas as they were expressed in a
US News & World Report
interview with Dr. Shockley.
However, the chairman of the
Committee on Science and Public
Policy of the NAS commented,
"If the statement [in the
interview] about mean white and
nonwhite IQ's did not have such
touchy implications, it probably
would have remained
unnoticed ... I am afraid at this
point that any study, no matter
how objectively conducted, with
which your name is in any way
associated will henceforth be
doomed to attack as being
'racist'."
Last week at Dartmouth
College 30 black students
prevented Dr. Shockley from
delivering a paper by
demonstrations in the auditorium.
Dr. Shockley deplores the
"wishful thinking rather than
sound diagnosis" of his colleagues.
He feels that "to fail to raise these
unpopular questions because of
fear of the resentment towards me
that might ensue is an
irresponsibility that I am not
willing to have on my conscience.
"I believe and hope that my
determination to see that these
questions are faced and answered
may be the greatest contribution
anyone can make to American
Negro welfare for thy next
generation."
A major controversy has
erupted in the National Academy
of Sciences (NAS), over Nobel
Laureate Dr. William Shockley's
call for more research on genetic
differences between races.
Dr. Shockley, currently
teaching at Stanford, won a
significant victory in his nearly
four-yearlong campaign to
persuade the academy to launch a
major study of this topic
especially with regard to
intelligence. A special committee
was set up to study Dr. Shockley's
resolution at the fall meeting of
the scientific society. However,
opposition to his proposals
remains strong.
In answer to questions about
his views, Dr. Shockley has said,
"My position is not that all
Negroes are inferior to all whites;
instead I do believe that many
Negroes are superior to many
whites. In fact, my statistical

studies show that American
Negroes achieve almost every
eminent distinction that whites
achieve and are about 50% more
successful per capita in winning
Olympic medals.
"However, so far as distinction
dependent upon mental powers is
concerned, the probability on a
per capita basis is between 10 and
100 times smaller for Negroes
than for the national average and
it is this probability that I fear is
falling as a result of the high birth
rates of the most disadvantaged."
