# Seltzer Announced Director Of Summer Arts Festival
## 
### 
Leon Seltzer, director of the
Stanford University Press, will
serve as director of the 1969-70
Summer Festival of the Arts,
President Kenneth S. Pitzer
announced last week.
Seltzer, as chairman of the
Summer Festival Committee, will
supervise faculty guidance for the
program, which has consistently
linked the performing arts with
Stanford's summer educational
programs.

Financial support for the
season has been assured through a
grant from the San Francisco
Foundation and by anonymous
private donors. Last year there
was fear that the Festival would
have to be discontinued because
of lack of money. It loses money
each year and needs subsidies to
continue to exist.
The festival recently completed
the most successful season in its
six-year history, attracting a paid
attendance of nearly 72,000 at
last summer's events.
Seltzer succeeds Professor
Virgil Whitaker, former dean of

the graduate division, who now
holds the Sadie Dernham Patek
endowed professorship in the
humanities. Stephen A. Baffrey
serves as executive producer for
the festival.
Whitaker and Baffrey together
built the festival into one of the
best known summer cultural
programs in the West. The festival
introduced the American
Conservatory Theater to the Bay
Area, and played a key part in
ACT's decision to become a
resident company in San
Francisco.
The summer program has
provided a model for similar
efforts at Lincoln Center in New
York City, and the Temple
Festival in Philadelphia, among
others.
Stanford Summer Festival
bookings have contributed
growing public recognition to
such varied groups as the Joffrey
Ballet, the Preservation Hall Jazz
Band, and the New York City
Opera, which now visits Los
Angeles regularly.
The summer festival also has
sponsored the American debut of
the Orchestra de la Suisse
Romande and the national or
regional premieres of such
individual artists as pianist Bruno
Gelber and singers Isabel Rivas,
and Elly Ameling.
Seltzer came to Stanford in
1956 from Columbia University,
where he was editor-in-chief of
the Columbia-Lippincott Gazetter
of the World and assistant editor
of the Columbia Encyclopedia.
