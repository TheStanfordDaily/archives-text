# Lyman Offers Profs Legal Aid
## 
### 
Stanford University today
promised legal aid to faculty
members whose privacy might be
invaded by publication of the
detailed lists of faculty salaries
that have been circulated on
campus.
In a related action, the student
publications board voted to
require editors of the Daily to
check potentially libelous stories
with staff lawyers.
Both moves were the result of
the circulation of the
mimeographed lists of the faculty
salaries by an anonymous group.
The material, stolen last spring
from university files during the
occupation of Encina Hall,
included evaluations of instructors
made by department superiors.
The Daily has reported the lists
of salaries without mentioning
names, but Editor Mark
Weinberger has indicated that
publication of the complete data
by the Daily has not yet been
ruled out.
In a letter to faculty members
today, Provost Richard Lyman
revealed that the university has
attempted to use "moral suasion"
to prevent the publication of the
confidential data.

Recognizing, however, "the
uncertain degree of protection"
such suasion provides, he said that
"the University is prepared to
provide legal advice in aid of any
faculty or staff member and his
counsel in steps necessary to
determine if his privacy has been
invaded."
In the letter, Lyman disclosed
that Stanford has been providing
aggregate salary information "by
rank" to the American
Association of University
Professors. It is presently
preparing to make public salary
information by rank and academic
division "in a manner that will
safeguard the privacy of individual
salaries."
Lyman strongly defended the
principle of individual privacy. If
invasion of privacy cannot be
prevented, he said, "vigorous
action should follow against those
responsible for the action."
He expressed the hope that
legal action and advice would be
unnecessary and that "the
unscrupulous actions of a few will
be rejected and rebuked as they
deserve to be."
