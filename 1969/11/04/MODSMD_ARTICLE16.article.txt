# Big Game Activities Enter Final Stages
## 
### 
Big game preparations have
already begun and today is the
deadline for the annual living
group decoration contest
The theme for this year's
Homecoming decorations has
been chosen: "Bears Who Don't
Score, Can't Get the Axe in '69!"
Plans for this traditional event of
Big Game Week are complete.
Details have been sent to all house
presidents or homecoming
chairmen. The deadline for entries
is today. Complete decorations
plans must be submitted by next
Monday, November 10.
Traditionally, all houses have
built decorations along the Old
Row (Lasuen Street and Mall) to
facilitate viewing. This year
permission has been granted to
extend the decoration area along
Campus Drive and down into
White Plaza.
Sites are mapped out along the
Old Mall and Campus and are
available on a first come, first
served basis at the Cardinal's
Board desk in the ASSU office.
Over 30 sites are available, yet
houses are encouraged to begin
plans and choose sites
immediately.
Possibilities for Homecoming
decorations are almost unlimited.
In the past most have been
constructed of crepe paper and
chicken wire. They may be
billboards, 3D, mechanical, or just
about anything.
The theme is offered as a
starting point only. There will be
five divisions of judging: humor,
theme, originality, animation, and
sweepstakes. Imaginative
decorations are sought. The

winners will be awarded kegs of
beer and their names will be
announced during halftime at the
Big Game.
In addition to Homecoming
Decorations Competition, and the
preparations for the Bonfire,
Cardinal's Board also plans a
campus-wide street dance to be
held Friday, November 21, after
the Bonfire.
Each living group is encouraged
to participate in Homecoming by
the Cardinal's Board in order to
make it an outstanding event for
both students and alumni. There
will not be another Homecoming
until 1971. If there are any
questions, please contact Pat
Willard, Bob Cookson, or Bob
Mallek of Cardinal's Board in the
ASSU office.
