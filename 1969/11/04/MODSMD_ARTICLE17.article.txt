# New Lit Course
## 
### 
This winter, the English
Department will offer an
experimental course under the
direction of Larry Friedlander
entitled "Literature and the
Performing Arts."
It will be an interdisciplinary
investigation into the nature of
the various arts, with particular
concentration on the relationship
of the individual artist to the form
of creation he chooses â€”how his
temperament and creative impulse
drive him to a given form of
expression.
Students will attend lectures,
discuss issues with visiting
professors and/or artists, and
work on projects of their own.
An important part of the
learning experience in this course
will be the presentation, in class,
by the students of their work.
Professor Friedlander hopes these
presentations, and the discussions
which follow, will lead to a better
understanding of the specific
experience of the artist or
performer.
All students will be required to
write a paper and to undertake
projects, some assigned, some
free, in their own field (writing,
music, theater, painting, dance,
etc.)
The reading will emphasize
primarily literary creation; novels,
plays, and poems will be studied
both in themselves and in the
ways they have been adapted to
other art forms.
In addition, visiting artists and
writers will display and discuss
their work.
Prof. Friedlander urges all
students interested in this course
to sign up in the English office as
soon as possible.
Great creative talent is not
crucial, he says.
He also asks that competent
people interested in directing
student work contact him in the
English office.
