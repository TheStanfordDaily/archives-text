# Chairman For New Student Senate
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF BOB MICHELET 
David C. Edwards, BSU
co-ordinator for relations with
East Palo Alto, was elected to the
chairmanship of the new student
Senate last night.
Edwards polled 25 of the 37
votes cast, in a meeting clouded
with intricate procedural
questions and punctuated by
shouting matches between ASSU
Council of presidents member Pat
Shea, Student Senator Yale
Braunstein, former LASSU
speaker, and student senator Jim
Schneider, president of the
Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC).
Prior to the vote there was
running debate on the method of
selecting the chairman. It was
finally decided after a series of
complicated votes that if no
candidate received the majority
vote of the Senate on the first
ballot a runoff would be held
between the two leading
candidates.
However, Edwards was elected
on the first ballot, obviating the
need for a runoff. At the Senate's
previous meeting, it had been
decided that the chairman must
receive an absolute majority of
the Senate, not just a plurality of
the members present and voting.
Braunstein's outburst was
precipatated by a speech by
Schnieder supporting Peter
Carpenter, a candidate for
chairman who was absent.
Schnieder passed around leaflets
outlining Carpenter's positions.
Braunstein then passed around
a card implying that the candidate
was closely connected with the
military industrial complex.
Schnieder tried to grab the card
and prevent others from seeing it.
In the ensuing debate over

whether the contents of the card
should be read to the Senate,
Braunstein blew up at Pat Shea.
In his speech to the Senate,
Edwards said that he recognized
that there were various factions in
the Senate, but that he would
work for a Senate in which the
students could talk and work
together.
Edwards is a black, and worked
as campaign manager for the BSU
slate of candidates. Notes passed
during the meeting indicated close
cooperation between BSU and
radical white Senate members.
The election was apparently
decided when two other
candidates threw their support
behind Edwards during their
candidacy speeches. Owen Blank
and Rick Atkins both stated that
they thought that Edwards would
be the best man for the job.
John Shoch was elected Senate
vice-chairman on a vote of 19 to
18, over Patrick C. Shea.
Carpenter received one vote.
Shoch, however, needed the vote
of Edwards to receive a majority
of 20.
In other actions, the Senate
voted an emergency expenditure
of $300 for the Publications
Board to hire an attorney to
investigate the relationship
between ASSU, the Chaparral,
and its business trust, the Hammer
and Coffin Society.
Five Senate members were
selected, at random, to form a
committee to screen nominations
for the ASSU Committee on
Nominations.
They are undergraduates Mike
Dawson and Jon Sylvester, grad
students Paul Rutala and Russ
Taplin and Sloan Blocker, at large.
Applications for the committee
are available in the ASSU office
and are due Wednesday.

Board to hire an attorney to

Nominations.
They are undergraduates Mike
Dawson and Jon Sylvester, grad

NEW SENATE CHAIRMAN—Dave Edwards (left), newly-elected chairman of
the student Senate, receives congratulations of Pat Shea, Council of Presidents
member and interim floor chairman. The often-stormy meeting also saw the
election of John Shoch as vice chairman.
David C. Edwards, BSU
co-ordinator for relations with
East Palo Alto, was elected to the
chairmanship of the new student
Senate last night.
Edwards polled 25 of the 37
votes cast, in a meeting clouded
with intricate procedural
questions and punctuated by
shouting matches between ASSU
Council of presidents member Pat
Shea, Student Senator Yale
Braunstein, former LASSU
speaker, and student senator Jim
Schneider, president of the
Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC).
Prior to the vote there was
running debate on the method of
selecting the chairman. It was
finally decided after a series of
complicated votes that if no
candidate received the majority
vote of the Senate on the first
ballot a runoff would be held
between the two leading
candidates.
However, Edwards was elected
on the first ballot, obviating the
need for a runoff. At the Senate's
previous meeting, it had been
decided that the chairman must
receive an absolute majority of
the Senate, not just a plurality of
the members present and voting.
Braunstein's outburst was
precipatated by a speech by
Schnieder supporting Peter
Carpenter, a candidate for
chairman who was absent.
Schnieder passed around leaflets
outlining Carpenter's positions.
Braunstein then passed around
a card implying that the candidate
was closely connected with the
military industrial complex.
Schnieder tried to grab the card
and prevent others from seeing it.
In the ensuing debate over

whether the contents of the card
should be read to the Senate,
Braunstein blew up at Pat Shea.
In his speech to the Senate,
Edwards said that he recognized
that there were various factions in
the Senate, but that he would
work for a Senate in which the
students could talk and work
together.
Edwards is a black, and worked
as campaign manager for the BSU
slate of candidates. Notes passed
during the meeting indicated close
cooperation between BSU and
radical white Senate members.
The election was apparently
decided when two other
candidates threw their support
behind Edwards during their
candidacy speeches. Owen Blank
and Rick Atkins both stated that
they thought that Edwards would
be the best man for the job.
John Shoch was elected Senate
vice-chairman on a vote of 19 to
18, over Patrick C. Shea.
Carpenter received one vote.
Shoch, however, needed the vote
of Edwards to receive a majority
of 20.
In other actions, the Senate
voted an emergency expenditure
of $300 for the Publications
Board to hire an attorney to
investigate the relationship
between ASSU, the Chaparral,
and its business trust, the Hammer
and Coffin Society.
