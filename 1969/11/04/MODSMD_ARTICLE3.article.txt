# Alioto: Dissent OK But Not Violence
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
While calling for the freedom of
dissent in his campus speech
yesterday, Mayor Joseph Alioto
was at the same time the object of
picketing and the bizarre
presentation of a pie by four
hooded students.
The pranksters, including one
costumed as a chef, apparently
were not affiliated with the
Stanford Community Against War
and Fascism which had picketed
the speech at Memorial
Auditorium.
Dissent, said the San Francisco
Mayor, is rooted in the First and
Fourteenth Amendments to the
U.S. Constitution, and "we can
best arrive at a consensus from
wide and uninhibited debate."
"Anybody ought to be able to
advocate anything, even the most
hateful of ideas," he said, "and
the University is the place to
advocaty them."
The Mayor predicted that
dissent will be an important force
in the next decade. He supported
free discussion and
demonstrations, but said that
when violence is used, "It will be
put down by any constitutional
means."
Pollution of the air, land and
seas will be a major problem in
the future according to Alioto. He
said that if elected governor he
would outlaw the internal
combustion engine within six
years. He attributed most of the
problems to the powerful oil and
automobile lobbies.

"The auto industry says 'Give
us 15 years and we will solve the
air pollution problem.' They
haven't got 15 years," he
answered. "In fifteen years they'll
be signing death certificates with
air pollution or smog as the cause
of death."
He predicted that California
mayors, including himself, will
appeal the recent consent decree
entered into between the auto
industry and the Federal
government over smog control
devices. "We had hoped that the
competition among the auto
companies would spur a solution
to the smog problem, but the
court ruled against us."
After his speech the mayor
answered questions and made the
following observations: "Political
interference with the campuses of
the University of California will
cost 30,000 students admission.
"I am for a negotiated
settlement in Vietnam without
dropping everything and running
for the boats . . .
"I wouldn't like to see a
communist government in South
Vietnam, but I don't think we can
impose our views all over the
world . . .
At the reception afterwards,
Alioto commented that he is still
pressing his libel suit against, Look
magazine, but that Look is
deliberately trying to keep quiet
and is slowing down thy court
procedings.
