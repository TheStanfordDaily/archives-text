# Viet Referendum
## Students Vote Pull-Out 
### TINA COOPER 
The majority of students voting
in the campus referendum on
Vietnam support an immediate
cease fire and rapid withdrawal of
all U.S. forces now fighting there.
The referendum was conducted
during the student elections Oct.
16-17. Students were asked to
rate seven alternatives, indicating
those which were unacceptable.
In all, more than six out of ten
students that voted endorsed an
immediate cease fire. The second
most popular choice was
withdrawal of all forces by
December 1970.
Only 15 per cent of those
voting listed continuation of
present policies among their first
three choices. Nearly four out of
10 said gradual withdrawal of U.S.
forces and "Vietnamization of he
combat operations" was an
"unacceptable" policy.
Several alternatives for
escalation of the war were favored
by less than one in 10 students
voting.
Results to Nixon
The referendum was organized
by the Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC). Results were
compiled and telegraphed to
President Nixon today by CAC
chairman James Schnieder.
"The President made it quite
clear that he was not going to

recognize standard kinds of
student protest as being a valid
measurement of sentiment on the
war," Schnieder said. "We believe
the poll will present him with an
objective analysis of student
opinion, one which he would be
more apt to accept."
John Kramer, one of the
Moratorium leaders on campus,
commented: "These results show
far more passive support for our
desire to get out of Vietnam than
we ever could ha\o c p' ted. The
problem, now, will bo to translate
this passive support into active
support for the Moratorium."
No Real Impact
On the other hand, editor of the
Moratorium newspaper, The
Peacemonger, David Jones, said
"Personally I voted for immediate
withdrawal, but I don't really
think the referendum means a
damn thing. It says nothing about
now to accomplish the cease-fire
and the withdrawal, and so will
have no real impact in Washington
or on public opinion."
Results, in summary, were as
follows:
The top three choices:
Immediate cease fire, withdrawal
by December, 1970, 50% yes,
10% unacceptable; immediate
cease fire, rapid withdrawal, 50%
yes, 18% unacceptable; gradual
phasedown, withdrawal by

December, 1970, 46% yes, 12%
unacceptable.
Choices least favored by the
students were: expanded bombing
until negotiated settlement, 5%
yes, 57% unacceptable; all-out
military win policy, 4% yes, 60%
unacceptable.

have no real impact in Washington
or on public opinion."
Results, in summary, were as
follows:
The top three choices:
Immediate cease fire, withdrawal
by December, 1970, 50% yes,
10% unacceptable; immediate
cease fire, rapid withdrawal, 50%
yes, 18% unacceptable; gradual
phasedown, withdrawal by

December, 1970, 46% yes, 12%
unacceptable.
Choices least favored by the
students were: expanded bombing
until negotiated settlement, 5%
yes, 57% unacceptable; all-out
military win policy, 4% yes, 60%
unacceptable.
The majority of students voting
in the campus referendum on
Vietnam support an immediate
cease fire and rapid withdrawal of
all U.S. forces now fighting there.
The referendum was conducted
during the student elections Oct.
16-17. Students were asked to
rate seven alternatives, indicating
those which were unacceptable.
In all, more than six out of ten
students that voted endorsed an
immediate cease fire. The second
most popular choice was
withdrawal of all forces by
December 1970.
Only 15 per cent of those
voting listed continuation of
present policies among their first
three choices. Nearly four out of
10 said gradual withdrawal of U.S.
forces and "Vietnamization of he
combat operations" was an
"unacceptable" policy.
Several alternatives for
escalation of the war were favored
by less than one in 10 students
voting.
Results to Nixon
The referendum was organized
by the Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC). Results were
compiled and telegraphed to
President Nixon today by CAC
chairman James Schnieder.
"The President made it quite
clear that he was not going to

recognize standard kinds of
student protest as being a valid
measurement of sentiment on the
war," Schnieder said. "We believe
the poll will present him with an
objective analysis of student
opinion, one which he would be
more apt to accept."
John Kramer, one of the
Moratorium leaders on campus,
commented: "These results show
far more passive support for our
desire to get out of Vietnam than
we ever could ha\o c p' ted. The
problem, now, will bo to translate
this passive support into active
support for the Moratorium."
No Real Impact
On the other hand, editor of the
Moratorium newspaper, The
Peacemonger, David Jones, said
"Personally I voted for immediate
withdrawal, but I don't really
think the referendum means a
damn thing. It says nothing about
now to accomplish the cease-fire
and the withdrawal, and so will
have no real impact in Washington
or on public opinion."
