# Nixon Hints At Troop Withdrawal Timetable

WASHINGTON
(AP)—President Nixon told the
nation last night he has a secret
time-table for withdrawing all
U.S. ground combat forces from
South Vietnam but declared
Hanoi could sabotage it by
stepping up military pressure.
At the same time, in a
nationwide television-radio
address, Nixon disclosed a
hitherto secret exchange of
correspondence last summer with
the late President Ho Chi Minh of
North Vietnam which he said
bolsters his contention that Hanoi
is blocking the road to peace.
The Nixon address broke no
new ground in the realm of peace

initiatives. It added up to a
carefully-prepared appeal for
homefront support of the
administration's Vietnam policies.
"I have chosen a plan for
peace," he said. "I believe it will
succeed . . .
Calls For Unity
"Let us be united for peace.
Let us also be united against
defeat. Because let us understand:
North Vietnam cannot defeat or
humiliate the United States. Only
Americans can do that."
Declaring that he would not
reveal any details, Nixon talked
about his withdrawal program in
these words:
"We have adopted a plan which
we have worked out in
cooperation with the South
Vietnamese for the complete
withdrawal of all U.S. ground
combat forces and their
replacement by South Vietnamese
forces on an orderly scheduled
timetable."
The chief executive said that if
enemy infiltration and the current
battlefield lull continues,
withdrawals probably could be
speeded. But he said should Hanoi
step up military pressure and
jeopardize U.S. forces in Vietnam,
"I shall not hesitate to take strong
and effective measures to deal
with that situation."

Initial congressional response to
President Nixon's Vietnam speech
divided along predictable lines
Monday night with administration
supporters saying it opens the
door to peace while war critics
asserted it sticks with old policies.
"I am deeply discouraged by
it," Sen. George S. McGovern
(D-S.D.) said, adding that the
speech represented the "same,
tired, old, discredited policy" that
has led to the death of 40,000
Americans.
"It can only be characterized as
a disappointment," commented
Sen. Jacob K. Javits, (R-N.Y.)
saying that "The President's
statement, eloquent and moving
as it was, hasn't changed
anything."
Hail Presidential Policy
Praise for the President's policy
came from House Republican
Leader Gerald R. Ford, assistant
Senate GOP Leader Robert P.
Griffin, and Democratic Senators
John C. Stennis of Mississippi and
Henry C. Jackson of Washington,
the chairman and a senior member
of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
"An act of great courage and an
address that promises to be a
turning point in history," Griffin
said. "A most frank and forthright
statement," aid Ford.
"I'm satisfied that the President
is doing all he can and it's up to
everyone to back him up,"
Stennis said.
Sen. Harry F. Byrd Jr., (D-Va.)
said while "there was very little
new in the President's speech" it
is clear "he has been making a
determined effort to achieve an
honorable peace."
Brown Disappointed
Sam Brown, a coordinator of
the Vietnam Moratorium
Committee which conducted
nationwide demonstrations Oct.
15 and plans a second round Nov.
13-14, expressed grave
disappointment and said "It is
clear that those of us who are
opposed to the war must continue
to work against the war." He
added that the message of the
Oct. 15 protests "has not reached
the President."
Sen. J.W. Fulbright (D-Ark.)
who had delayed hearings on
Vietnam by his Foreign Relations
Comm ttee pending the
President's speech, withheld
comment pending a study of the
President's text.
But Sen. Albert Gore,
(D-Tenn.) a member of the
committee, criticized Nixon's
address and said "There is no
choice now but for the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
constructively to try to contribute
to the finding of a policy for
peace."
Communist Reactions
Communist delegations to the
Paris peace talks made it clear
early Tuesday they wanted time
to study the text of President
Nixon's speech before making any
comments.
A telephone call to the
residence of the North
Vietnamese delegation in Paris
brought an unusual response—the
phone was answered with the
distant sound of Nixon's voice
apparently from a short wave
radio, and then was hung up after
a few moments.
At the headquarters of the Viet
Cong's provisional revolutionary
government delegation, callers
were politely asked to "please call
back in the morning after 9 a.m.".
