## Mayoral Contest 
### 
NEW YORK (AP)Mayor John
V. Lindsay is a shoo-in for
re-election Tuesday—if the
poll takers are right.
The final Daily News straw poll
Monday showed Lindsay with 48
per cent of the vote, nearly
equalling the combined total of
two rivals—Democratic City
Comptroller Mario A. Procaccino
with 27 per cent and State. Sen.
John J. Marchi the
Republican-Conservative
candidate, with 23. Two per cent
were undecided.
Detroit Race Close
Whether the next mayor of the
nation's fifth largest city, Detroit,
will be Richard Austin, a
56-year-old Negro accountant, or
Roman Gribbs, 43, a white
lawyer, is rated a toss-up, polls
indicate.
The final poll of the Detroit
News had Austin, Wayne County's
auditor, leading Gribbs, the
county's sheriff, but conceded
that Tuesday's contest would be
decided by the large number—lB
percent—of undecided voters.
In a city whose recent racial
history remains scarred from
devastating race riots, there are
signs that for some voters the
nonpartisan election is a simple
matter of black vs. white.
Stokes Slated to Win
In Cleveland, newspaper polls
gave incumbent Democrat Carl B.
Stokes a small and shaky edge
over Republican Ralph J. Perk in
today's mayoral election. The race
was said to be extremely close.
Election officials predict a
turnout of about 237,000 of
Cleveland's 316,000 registered
voters.
LSI) Report
CHICAGO (AP)-Three
researchers reported yesterday
that in contrast to previous

studies they have found that the
use of LSD does not cause
significant changes in the users'
chromosomes.
LSD is the popular abbreviation
for lysergic acid diethylamide, an
hallucigenic drug which has had
widespread illicit use.
There has been concern among
doctors and others over the
possible damage to chromosomes,
the carriers of genes which affect
heredity. The offspring of LSD
users might be born with physical
or mental defects, thev feared.
The researchers said the results
of their studies "would seem to
sustain the conclusion that at this
time there is no definite evidence
that LSD damages chromosomes
of human white blood cells."
However, they added, "Further
research in this complex field is
obviously needed."
Draft Cited
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Selective Service System must be
stopped from using the draft to
punish antidraft and antiwar
protestors, former Atty. Gen.
Ramsey Clark told a Senate panel
Monday.
Clark said fines might be
substituted for the official policy
of speeding up induction into the
Army as a rebuke for actions
ranging from protests to failure to
carry a draft card.
He said the delinquency rules
have been used unconstitutionally
to stifle protest and limit freedom
of speech and should be repealed
by Congress.
And he said criminal
prosecutions of draft violators
should be held to a minimum as a
matter of national policy.

matter of black vs. white.
Stokes Slated to Win
In Cleveland, newspaper polls
gave incumbent Democrat Carl B.
Stokes a small and shaky edge
over Republican Ralph J. Perk in
today's mayoral election. The race
was said to be extremely close.
Election officials predict a
turnout of about 237,000 of
Cleveland's 316,000 registered
voters.
LSI) Report
CHICAGO (AP)-Three
researchers reported yesterday
that in contrast to previous

studies they have found that the
use of LSD does not cause
significant changes in the users'
chromosomes.
LSD is the popular abbreviation
for lysergic acid diethylamide, an
hallucigenic drug which has had
widespread illicit use.
There has been concern among
doctors and others over the
possible damage to chromosomes,
the carriers of genes which affect
heredity. The offspring of LSD
users might be born with physical
or mental defects, thev feared.
The researchers said the results
of their studies "would seem to
sustain the conclusion that at this
time there is no definite evidence
that LSD damages chromosomes
of human white blood cells."
However, they added, "Further
research in this complex field is
obviously needed."
Draft Cited
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Selective Service System must be
stopped from using the draft to
punish antidraft and antiwar
protestors, former Atty. Gen.
Ramsey Clark told a Senate panel
Monday.
Clark said fines might be
substituted for the official policy
of speeding up induction into the
Army as a rebuke for actions
ranging from protests to failure to
carry a draft card.
He said the delinquency rules
have been used unconstitutionally
to stifle protest and limit freedom
of speech and should be repealed
by Congress.
And he said criminal
prosecutions of draft violators
should be held to a minimum as a
matter of national policy.
NEW YORK (AP)Mayor John
V. Lindsay is a shoo-in for
re-election Tuesday—if the
poll takers are right.
The final Daily News straw poll
Monday showed Lindsay with 48
per cent of the vote, nearly
equalling the combined total of
two rivals—Democratic City
Comptroller Mario A. Procaccino
with 27 per cent and State. Sen.
John J. Marchi the
Republican-Conservative
candidate, with 23. Two per cent
were undecided.
Detroit Race Close
Whether the next mayor of the
nation's fifth largest city, Detroit,
will be Richard Austin, a
56-year-old Negro accountant, or
Roman Gribbs, 43, a white
lawyer, is rated a toss-up, polls
indicate.
The final poll of the Detroit
News had Austin, Wayne County's
auditor, leading Gribbs, the
county's sheriff, but conceded
that Tuesday's contest would be
decided by the large number—lB
percent—of undecided voters.
In a city whose recent racial
history remains scarred from
devastating race riots, there are
signs that for some voters the
nonpartisan election is a simple
matter of black vs. white.
