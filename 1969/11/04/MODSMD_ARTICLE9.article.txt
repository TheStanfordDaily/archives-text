# On The Bandwagon
## Moratorium Divisions 
### David Jones 
Sunday's Community meeting
of the Stanford Moratorium
Cjommittee illustrated the
uneasiness of a coalition united on
issues rather than tactics or
analysis.
I Liberals and radicals agreed
that the Moratorium must be
iicpanded to include workers,
ftorticularly blue collar production
vjTorkers. They disagree on tactics,
/ind polarities of analysis came
(Jose to breaking open the
(|balition over the support of the
Pittsburgh-Des Moines steel strike.
; Overly distilled, the debate
Revealed deep divisions—in the
Conception of the needs of
workers, in assumptions as to the
location of both power and
£sponsibility for the Vietnam
War, and in the conception of the
Moratorium.
The radical argument called for
Solidarity with the wage demands
of striking workers at
Pittsburgh-Des Moines. Strike
support, they argued, could be
translated into a direct offensive
nfgainst "the ruling class" and
Industrial elite. This elite, the
argument cogently notes, has an
interest in American
policemanship abroad and

military protection of a system of
multi-national extractive industry.
But, the radical argument
begins and ends, I think, with a
faulty assumption: that the
"working class" American is
exploited, conscious of his
exploitation, and can be won with
symbolic gestures of solidarity.
On the contrary, strike action
at PDM is an illustration of
American labor's traditional
capacity to win a piece of the
action: better wages, fringe
benefits, limited upward mobility.
The thrust is for a fair share, not
specifically for self-determination
in Vietnam or a crippling blow
against international steel
availability. This, I suppose, is the
"liberal view."
That liberal view suggests
considerably different
tactics—canvassing and electoral
involvement and support for the
PDM strike, but support with a
deeply different rationale: the
justice of wage demands by those
who are the basis of productivity.
The liberal analysis, I think,
places responsibility for the
prosecution of the war with five
constituencies: with the
presidency, with the Congress,

with an apathetic electorate fed
by myth-preserving mass media,
with multi-national corporations,
with the military and their
researchers in the academic
community.
The questions, become then:
which of these loci can be
effectively influenced toward a
policy of immediate withdrawal;
and how can they be influenced
witho t destroying the
Moratorium's broadening base of
support.
The military and the
multi-national corporation—both
largely above the law and the
check of public opinion—are
amenable only, I think, to
coercive action. That action, I
believe, would serve dissipate the
Moratoirum's broad-based support
and vitiate its principles.
That would argue for placing
the Moratorium's thrust upon
influencing public opinion, the
Congress and the President. This
kind of thrust, I believe, calls for
an intensification of the
canvassing effort,
person-to-person communication,
massive symbolic gestures such as
marches.
It also calls, I think, for

individual support of the PDM
strikers through SDS and
individual support of peace
candidates through the
Committee for New Politics.

"liberal view."
That liberal view suggests
considerably different
tactics—canvassing and electoral
involvement and support for the
PDM strike, but support with a
deeply different rationale: the
justice of wage demands by those
who are the basis of productivity.
The liberal analysis, I think,
places responsibility for the
prosecution of the war with five
constituencies: with the
presidency, with the Congress,

with an apathetic electorate fed
by myth-preserving mass media,
with multi-national corporations,
with the military and their
researchers in the academic
community.
The questions, become then:
which of these loci can be
effectively influenced toward a
policy of immediate withdrawal;
and how can they be influenced
witho t destroying the
Moratorium's broadening base of
support.
The military and the
multi-national corporation—both
largely above the law and the
check of public opinion—are
amenable only, I think, to
coercive action. That action, I
believe, would serve dissipate the
Moratoirum's broad-based support
and vitiate its principles.
That would argue for placing
the Moratorium's thrust upon
influencing public opinion, the
Congress and the President. This
kind of thrust, I believe, calls for
an intensification of the
canvassing effort,
person-to-person communication,
massive symbolic gestures such as
marches.
It also calls, I think, for

individual support of the PDM
strikers through SDS and
individual support of peace
candidates through the
Committee for New Politics.

Sunday's Community meeting
of the Stanford Moratorium
Cjommittee illustrated the
uneasiness of a coalition united on
issues rather than tactics or
analysis.
I Liberals and radicals agreed
that the Moratorium must be
iicpanded to include workers,
ftorticularly blue collar production
vjTorkers. They disagree on tactics,
/ind polarities of analysis came
(Jose to breaking open the
(|balition over the support of the
Pittsburgh-Des Moines steel strike.
; Overly distilled, the debate
Revealed deep divisions—in the
Conception of the needs of
workers, in assumptions as to the
location of both power and
£sponsibility for the Vietnam
War, and in the conception of the
Moratorium.
The radical argument called for
Solidarity with the wage demands
of striking workers at
Pittsburgh-Des Moines. Strike
support, they argued, could be
translated into a direct offensive
nfgainst "the ruling class" and
Industrial elite. This elite, the
argument cogently notes, has an
interest in American
policemanship abroad and

military protection of a system of
multi-national extractive industry.
But, the radical argument
begins and ends, I think, with a
faulty assumption: that the
"working class" American is
exploited, conscious of his
exploitation, and can be won with
symbolic gestures of solidarity.
On the contrary, strike action
at PDM is an illustration of
American labor's traditional
capacity to win a piece of the
action: better wages, fringe
benefits, limited upward mobility.
The thrust is for a fair share, not
specifically for self-determination
in Vietnam or a crippling blow
against international steel
availability. This, I suppose, is the
"liberal view."
