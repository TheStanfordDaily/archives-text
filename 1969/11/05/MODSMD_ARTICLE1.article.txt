# Moratorium Panel Hits Nixon 'Non-Speech'
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
President Nixon's Monday
night Vietnam speech is
"promising us war abroad and
revolution at home," according to
Asian expert Franz Schurmann of
the Berkeley Center for Chinese
Studies.
Schurmann agreed with five
other speakers last night that the
President's speech was little more
than a collection of platitudes and
a "trust the expertsâ€”we know
what we're doing" approach.
Speaking with Schurmann at a
meeting sponsored by the
Peninsula Moratorium Committee
were Harry Cleaver, Admiral
Arnold True, Robert Clarke, and
Professors Lyman Van Slyke and
Barton Bernstein.
Schurmann told the crowd of
approximately 650 in Memorial
Church that the time has past for
platitudes, and that Nixon's
message was that the U.S. will not
withdraw from South Vietnam
until we are assured that the
Thieu regime can remain in
power.
"Pressure from the generals,
empire-builders, and the
military-industrial-complex forced
Nixon to, in effect, continue
policy which originated in 1954,"
Schurmann commented.
Cold War Spectre
Schurmann predicted that our
failure to get out of Vietnam now
will lead to escalation of the arms
race, and a "resurection of the
spectre of the Cold War."
The Asian expert also
commented that "the war will not
fade away, and if it continues, we
can expect more trouble in Korea,
and the Middle East.
"Nixon's speech is promising us
war abroad and revolution at
home. He appealed to the
ingrained fear in this country, a
fear which grows directly from
our policies."

Retired Navy Admiral Arnold
True, member of a study group
which visited Vietnam, said that
Nixon was in effect saying that
"we can prevent a bloodbath of
Vietnamese by staying in the war
and killing them ourselves."
Honorable Act
True also said that it was a
dishonorable act for us to get in
the war, and it would be a very
honorable act to get out of this
immoral war.
Harry Cleaver, graduate student
in Economics, commented that a
U.S. pullout would not be an
humiliation for the country, but
merely an embarrassment for the
leadership of the nation.
Cleaver called on the U.S. to
get out of the entire pacific area
as the only means to peace.
N on-Speech
Professor Lyman Van Slyke of
Asian studies, called Nixon's

address a "non-speech, reminicent
of the man who says that for the
next minute he will not think of
the hippopotamus." The peace
movement is Nixon's
hippopotamus, which can't be
ignored much longer, he asserted.
The alleged "Vietnamization"
of the war was decried by
graduate student Robert Clarke as
being a policy which failed once
before, under John F. Kennedy,
and which will fail again, costing
many more lives. "You can't
support a regime which doesn't
have thy support of the people,"
he said.
History professor Barton
Bernstein completed the
presentations, by stating that the
speech "articulated the obvious."
He said the speech advocated
different tactics to achieve the
same goals of U.S. domination in
Vietnam.
