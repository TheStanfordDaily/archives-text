## 'All Nationalism Is Reactionary'

The Progressive Labor Party
claims marxism should be
confronted in its own terms. As
.said, the controversy is over the
.stand it has taken on the question
of nationalism. Right now, this is
not "only theory" but has led
them to denounce the present
policies of the NLF and the DRV
for the solution of the Vietnamese
war: "All nationalism is
reactionary"; they specify, "all
contemporary nationalism." The
refutation of this conclusion
requires a lengthy (though still
schematic) recital of marxist
political theory, perhaps
excusable as a useful reminder of
basic ideas.
Marxism repudiates "romantic
nationalism," an ideology that
would divide mankind into
separate distinct nations, have
those nations constituted into
sovereign States, whose claim is
that the freedom and fulfillment
of man are to be worked out in
terms of his national identity, his
goals expressed in terms of the
national totality however defined.
It is true enough that this kind
of nationalism is pervasive in the
world today, especially in
countries that have nothing to
offer their people but ideologies;
used to justify a reactionary
sacralisation of the nation, hence
of the State, in units whose
boundaries were drawn in Berlin
or London; in another presently
engaged in an imperial expansion
as if to retaliate for 2000 years of
oppression.
But marxism does not say that
all nationalism is reactionary; it so
happens also that certain
contemporary nationalist
movements are progressive, in the
present historical conditions.
Materialist Understanding
Marxism is characterized by the
materialist understanding of
history: This says that the motives
of historical movements are the
interests, in particular (but not
only) material ones, of individuals
and groups.
Within a nation there is a
"national class" that serves the
interests of the nation by serving
its own; the enlightened patriot
supports the proletarian struggle
because it is the true national
class, that does not have any
vested interest in the oppression
of other groups, the class whose
interests are socialistic.
When the Communist
Manifesto claims that
"proletarians have no fatherland,"
this is not anti-nationalism; It
means that the capitalist society
has deprived proletarians of any
participation in charting the
national history (viz. colonial
situations).
N ationliood
Socialism will give them
nationhood. Put plainly, it is
because nationhood has
substantial reality that an
American radical does not, should
not move to Communist China as
Spiro Agnew has urged radicals to

The PLP is right to this extent:
No nationalism has an
unconditional right to the support
of the socialist movement. The
socialist's conditions are that the
nationalistic interests should
coincide with the advancement of
the proletarian struggle.
If one admits that even the
proletarians of the United States
are privileged by the present
capitalist system because of the
exploitation of other countries,
then the true "imperial" (rather
than national) class is the
oppressed of those countries:
These are the ones whose struggle
a non-myopic socialist ought to
support: These struggles advance
the "imperial society" towards
the socialist ideal of
non-exploitation.

The fundamental premises of
historical materialism forbid PL to
condemn the nationalism of these
people. The answer to PL's
accusation of the Vietnamese is
the answer to the question, why
did Marx see the proletariat as the
progressive class? Because its
particularistic interests coincide
with those of mankind.
There was a time in the history
of Europe when the bourgeoisie
was the progressive class. The
same thing as of now with
Vietnamese, Palestinian, African
nation alism, if it is
anti-imperialist.
(At this point I am willing to
grant a parenthesis to Bruce
Franklin's objection to the PL
Party: You should not attack the

leadership of the most heroic
anti-imperialist movement; we are
Americans, if we were Vietnamese
we would not dare do it . . . But
this is against historical
materialism, in other words,
idealistic: The leaders are believed
to be the conscience or
consciousness of the Vietnamese
struggle, so that the motive force
lays in their prestige and
authority, i.e., charisma; there is
some of that by now, sure, but
isn't Franklin succumbing to an
(anglo-) saxon hero worship? The
Vietnamese are fighting not for
their leadership but for their land,
their children, their political
economic integrity.)
Authoritarian
But the PL Party's position is

also authoritarian: There is no
voluntaristic nation. People are
not moved to form a nation by
some nationalist ideology. A
national community is formed by
objective conditions already there,
consequences of extended
historical process, that bind and
identify people together, that
make them want to live together.
Few countries have as extended
and vigorous a history of
nationalism as Vietnam, an almost
secular resistance against foreign
domination: This resistance of
communal integrity is what PL in
effect denies as it condemns the
nationalist aspect of this war.
PL wants to ignore the
objective local conditions, causes
and aims of the war, and impose
its ends over those of the
Vietnamese people. The French
Communist Party too wanted to
ignore nationalism : What were the
Algerians to say to a marxist who
told them their independence
would be won in Paris not in
Algeria?
The revolutionary duty to
criticize presupposes an ability to
understand.
I It is sad that the radicals should
be so primitive and rural in the
society that is at the vanguard of
international capitalism. When
will they break out of this ivory
tower, "an old rotten tooth"?
There is a certain complacency
no doubt in the knowledge that
one is living at the heart of the
problem. Knowing oneself to be
at the vanguard of the vanguard
inevitably fosters racist
temptations, now expressed as
provincialism.
Responsibility Greater
These people's responsibility is
greater because they are in the
most important country, and
begins with giving up parochial
perspectives.
Even PL's doctrine seems to
imply a practical imperative to
channel all energies into the
internal US scene: This is
strategically justified yet there is
there the prejudice similar to that
of Marx and Engels towards
Germany and the "Western
European" proletariat in general,
fonin proved them wrong; as he
proved PL wrong on nationalism
by rallying the nationalistic
movements to the revolution
against czarism.
One final remark: People were
apparently disturbed by what
they thought to be quasi-racist
overtones in Malik's statement
that he is from the Third World
and does know better. That
evenin, the fact did seem to be
that only he knew what goes on in
the Third World, as when arguing
for nationalism against PL.
Besides, as said, there is an
anti-authoritarian justification for
such a statement. Malik is no
racist.
What he was doing was pointing
out the ignorance of the people
who were there and the
irresponsibility of their
statements. A proverb says,
"When a man points at the moon,
the fool looks at the finger."

Spiro Agnew has urged radicals to

The PLP is right to this extent:
No nationalism has an
unconditional right to the support
of the socialist movement. The
socialist's conditions are that the
nationalistic interests should
coincide with the advancement of
the proletarian struggle.
If one admits that even the
proletarians of the United States
are privileged by the present
capitalist system because of the
exploitation of other countries,
then the true "imperial" (rather
than national) class is the
oppressed of those countries:
These are the ones whose struggle
a non-myopic socialist ought to
support: These struggles advance
the "imperial society" towards
the socialist ideal of
non-exploitation.

The fundamental premises of
historical materialism forbid PL to
condemn the nationalism of these
people. The answer to PL's
accusation of the Vietnamese is
the answer to the question, why
did Marx see the proletariat as the
progressive class? Because its
particularistic interests coincide
with those of mankind.
There was a time in the history
of Europe when the bourgeoisie
was the progressive class. The
same thing as of now with
Vietnamese, Palestinian, African
nation alism, if it is
anti-imperialist.
(At this point I am willing to
grant a parenthesis to Bruce
Franklin's objection to the PL
Party: You should not attack the

leadership of the most heroic
anti-imperialist movement; we are
Americans, if we were Vietnamese
we would not dare do it . . . But
this is against historical
materialism, in other words,
idealistic: The leaders are believed
to be the conscience or
consciousness of the Vietnamese
struggle, so that the motive force
lays in their prestige and
authority, i.e., charisma; there is
some of that by now, sure, but
isn't Franklin succumbing to an
(anglo-) saxon hero worship? The
Vietnamese are fighting not for
their leadership but for their land,
their children, their political
economic integrity.)
Authoritarian
But the PL Party's position is

also authoritarian: There is no
voluntaristic nation. People are
not moved to form a nation by
some nationalist ideology. A
national community is formed by
objective conditions already there,
consequences of extended
historical process, that bind and
identify people together, that
make them want to live together.
Few countries have as extended
and vigorous a history of
nationalism as Vietnam, an almost
secular resistance against foreign
domination: This resistance of
communal integrity is what PL in
effect denies as it condemns the
nationalist aspect of this war.
PL wants to ignore the
objective local conditions, causes
and aims of the war, and impose
its ends over those of the
Vietnamese people. The French
Communist Party too wanted to
ignore nationalism : What were the
Algerians to say to a marxist who
told them their independence
would be won in Paris not in
Algeria?
The revolutionary duty to
criticize presupposes an ability to
understand.
I It is sad that the radicals should
be so primitive and rural in the
society that is at the vanguard of
international capitalism. When
will they break out of this ivory
tower, "an old rotten tooth"?
There is a certain complacency
no doubt in the knowledge that
one is living at the heart of the
problem. Knowing oneself to be
at the vanguard of the vanguard
inevitably fosters racist
temptations, now expressed as
provincialism.
Responsibility Greater
These people's responsibility is
greater because they are in the
most important country, and
begins with giving up parochial
perspectives.
Even PL's doctrine seems to
imply a practical imperative to
channel all energies into the
internal US scene: This is
strategically justified yet there is
there the prejudice similar to that
of Marx and Engels towards
Germany and the "Western
European" proletariat in general,
fonin proved them wrong; as he
proved PL wrong on nationalism
by rallying the nationalistic
movements to the revolution
against czarism.
One final remark: People were
apparently disturbed by what
they thought to be quasi-racist
overtones in Malik's statement
that he is from the Third World
and does know better. That
evenin, the fact did seem to be
that only he knew what goes on in
the Third World, as when arguing
for nationalism against PL.
Besides, as said, there is an
anti-authoritarian justification for
such a statement. Malik is no
racist.
What he was doing was pointing
out the ignorance of the people
who were there and the
irresponsibility of their
statements. A proverb says,
"When a man points at the moon,
the fool looks at the finger."
(I .H. Andre is a graduate
Undent in Economics.)
(This is the second half of an
article concerning various factions
of the radical movement. Todays

The Progressive Labor Party
claims marxism should be
confronted in its own terms. As
.said, the controversy is over the
.stand it has taken on the question
of nationalism. Right now, this is
not "only theory" but has led
them to denounce the present
policies of the NLF and the DRV
for the solution of the Vietnamese
war: "All nationalism is
reactionary"; they specify, "all
contemporary nationalism." The
refutation of this conclusion
requires a lengthy (though still
schematic) recital of marxist
political theory, perhaps
excusable as a useful reminder of
basic ideas.
Marxism repudiates "romantic
nationalism," an ideology that
would divide mankind into
separate distinct nations, have
those nations constituted into
sovereign States, whose claim is
that the freedom and fulfillment
of man are to be worked out in
terms of his national identity, his
goals expressed in terms of the
national totality however defined.
It is true enough that this kind
of nationalism is pervasive in the
world today, especially in
countries that have nothing to
offer their people but ideologies;
used to justify a reactionary
sacralisation of the nation, hence
of the State, in units whose
boundaries were drawn in Berlin
or London; in another presently
engaged in an imperial expansion
as if to retaliate for 2000 years of
oppression.
But marxism does not say that
all nationalism is reactionary; it so
happens also that certain
contemporary nationalist
movements are progressive, in the
present historical conditions.
Materialist Understanding
Marxism is characterized by the
materialist understanding of
history: This says that the motives
of historical movements are the
interests, in particular (but not
only) material ones, of individuals
and groups.
Within a nation there is a
"national class" that serves the
interests of the nation by serving
its own; the enlightened patriot
supports the proletarian struggle
because it is the true national
class, that does not have any
vested interest in the oppression
of other groups, the class whose
interests are socialistic.
When the Communist
Manifesto claims that
"proletarians have no fatherland,"
this is not anti-nationalism; It
means that the capitalist society
has deprived proletarians of any
participation in charting the
national history (viz. colonial
situations).
N ationliood
Socialism will give them
nationhood. Put plainly, it is
because nationhood has
substantial reality that an
American radical does not, should
not move to Communist China as
Spiro Agnew has urged radicals to

I It is sad that the radicals should
be so primitive and rural in the

There is a certain complacency
no doubt in the knowledge that
one is living at the heart of the

temptations, now expressed as

Responsibility Greater
These people's responsibility is
greater because they are in the
most important country, and
begins with giving up parochial
perspectives.
Even PL's doctrine seems to
imply a practical imperative to
channel all energies into the
internal US scene: This is
strategically justified yet there is
there the prejudice similar to that
of Marx and Engels towards
Germany and the "Western
European" proletariat in general,
fonin proved them wrong; as he
proved PL wrong on nationalism
by rallying the nationalistic
movements to the revolution
against czarism.
One final remark: People were
apparently disturbed by what
they thought to be quasi-racist
overtones in Malik's statement
that he is from the Third World
and does know better. That
evenin, the fact did seem to be
that only he knew what goes on in
the Third World, as when arguing
for nationalism against PL.
Besides, as said, there is an
anti-authoritarian justification for
such a statement. Malik is no
racist.
What he was doing was pointing
out the ignorance of the people
who were there and the
irresponsibility of their
statements. A proverb says,
"When a man points at the moon,
the fool looks at the finger."

The Progressive Labor Party
claims marxism should be
confronted in its own terms. As
.said, the controversy is over the
.stand it has taken on the question
of nationalism. Right now, this is
not "only theory" but has led
them to denounce the present
policies of the NLF and the DRV
for the solution of the Vietnamese
war: "All nationalism is
reactionary"; they specify, "all
contemporary nationalism." The
refutation of this conclusion
requires a lengthy (though still
schematic) recital of marxist
political theory, perhaps
excusable as a useful reminder of
basic ideas.
Marxism repudiates "romantic
nationalism," an ideology that
would divide mankind into
separate distinct nations, have
those nations constituted into
sovereign States, whose claim is
that the freedom and fulfillment
of man are to be worked out in
terms of his national identity, his
goals expressed in terms of the
national totality however defined.
It is true enough that this kind
of nationalism is pervasive in the
world today, especially in
countries that have nothing to
offer their people but ideologies;
used to justify a reactionary
sacralisation of the nation, hence
of the State, in units whose
boundaries were drawn in Berlin
or London; in another presently
engaged in an imperial expansion
as if to retaliate for 2000 years of
oppression.
But marxism does not say that
all nationalism is reactionary; it so
happens also that certain
contemporary nationalist
movements are progressive, in the
present historical conditions.
Materialist Understanding
Marxism is characterized by the
materialist understanding of
history: This says that the motives
of historical movements are the
interests, in particular (but not
only) material ones, of individuals
and groups.
Within a nation there is a
"national class" that serves the
interests of the nation by serving
its own; the enlightened patriot
supports the proletarian struggle
because it is the true national
class, that does not have any
vested interest in the oppression
of other groups, the class whose
interests are socialistic.
When the Communist
Manifesto claims that
"proletarians have no fatherland,"
this is not anti-nationalism; It
means that the capitalist society
has deprived proletarians of any
participation in charting the
national history (viz. colonial
situations).
N ationliood
Socialism will give them
nationhood. Put plainly, it is
because nationhood has
substantial reality that an
American radical does not, should
not move to Communist China as
Spiro Agnew has urged radicals to

The PLP is right to this extent:
No nationalism has an
unconditional right to the support
of the socialist movement. The
socialist's conditions are that the
nationalistic interests should
coincide with the advancement of
the proletarian struggle.
If one admits that even the
proletarians of the United States
are privileged by the present
capitalist system because of the
exploitation of other countries,
then the true "imperial" (rather
than national) class is the
oppressed of those countries:
These are the ones whose struggle
a non-myopic socialist ought to
support: These struggles advance
the "imperial society" towards
the socialist ideal of
non-exploitation.

The fundamental premises of
historical materialism forbid PL to
condemn the nationalism of these
people. The answer to PL's
accusation of the Vietnamese is
the answer to the question, why
did Marx see the proletariat as the
progressive class? Because its
particularistic interests coincide
with those of mankind.
There was a time in the history
of Europe when the bourgeoisie
was the progressive class. The
same thing as of now with
Vietnamese, Palestinian, African
nation alism, if it is
anti-imperialist.
(At this point I am willing to
grant a parenthesis to Bruce
Franklin's objection to the PL
Party: You should not attack the

leadership of the most heroic
anti-imperialist movement; we are
Americans, if we were Vietnamese
we would not dare do it . . . But
this is against historical
materialism, in other words,
idealistic: The leaders are believed
to be the conscience or
consciousness of the Vietnamese
struggle, so that the motive force
lays in their prestige and
authority, i.e., charisma; there is
some of that by now, sure, but
isn't Franklin succumbing to an
(anglo-) saxon hero worship? The
Vietnamese are fighting not for
their leadership but for their land,
their children, their political
economic integrity.)
Authoritarian
But the PL Party's position is

also authoritarian: There is no
voluntaristic nation. People are
not moved to form a nation by
some nationalist ideology. A
national community is formed by
objective conditions already there,
consequences of extended
historical process, that bind and
identify people together, that
make them want to live together.
Few countries have as extended
and vigorous a history of
nationalism as Vietnam, an almost
secular resistance against foreign
domination: This resistance of
communal integrity is what PL in
effect denies as it condemns the
nationalist aspect of this war.
PL wants to ignore the
objective local conditions, causes
and aims of the war, and impose
its ends over those of the
Vietnamese people. The French
Communist Party too wanted to
ignore nationalism : What were the
Algerians to say to a marxist who
told them their independence
would be won in Paris not in
Algeria?

schematic) recital of marxist
political theory, perhaps
excusable as a useful reminder of
basic ideas.
Marxism repudiates "romantic
nationalism," an ideology that
would divide mankind into
separate distinct nations, have
those nations constituted into
sovereign States, whose claim is
that the freedom and fulfillment
of man are to be worked out in
terms of his national identity, his
goals expressed in terms of the
national totality however defined.
It is true enough that this kind
of nationalism is pervasive in the
world today, especially in
countries that have nothing to
offer their people but ideologies;
used to justify a reactionary
sacralisation of the nation, hence
of the State, in units whose
boundaries were drawn in Berlin
or London; in another presently
engaged in an imperial expansion
as if to retaliate for 2000 years of
oppression.
But marxism does not say that
all nationalism is reactionary; it so
happens also that certain
contemporary nationalist
movements are progressive, in the
present historical conditions.
Materialist Understanding
Marxism is characterized by the
materialist understanding of
history: This says that the motives
of historical movements are the
interests, in particular (but not
only) material ones, of individuals
and groups.
Within a nation there is a
"national class" that serves the
interests of the nation by serving
its own; the enlightened patriot
supports the proletarian struggle
because it is the true national
class, that does not have any
vested interest in the oppression
of other groups, the class whose
interests are socialistic.
When the Communist
Manifesto claims that
"proletarians have no fatherland,"
this is not anti-nationalism; It
means that the capitalist society
has deprived proletarians of any
participation in charting the
national history (viz. colonial
situations).
N ationliood
Socialism will give them
nationhood. Put plainly, it is
because nationhood has
substantial reality that an
American radical does not, should
not move to Communist China as
Spiro Agnew has urged radicals to

The PLP is right to this extent:
No nationalism has an
unconditional right to the support
of the socialist movement. The
socialist's conditions are that the
nationalistic interests should
coincide with the advancement of
the proletarian struggle.
If one admits that even the
proletarians of the United States
are privileged by the present
capitalist system because of the
exploitation of other countries,
then the true "imperial" (rather
than national) class is the
oppressed of those countries:
These are the ones whose struggle
a non-myopic socialist ought to
support: These struggles advance
the "imperial society" towards
the socialist ideal of
non-exploitation.

The fundamental premises of
historical materialism forbid PL to
condemn the nationalism of these
people. The answer to PL's
accusation of the Vietnamese is
the answer to the question, why
did Marx see the proletariat as the
progressive class? Because its
particularistic interests coincide
with those of mankind.
There was a time in the history
of Europe when the bourgeoisie
was the progressive class. The
same thing as of now with
Vietnamese, Palestinian, African
nation alism, if it is
anti-imperialist.
(At this point I am willing to
grant a parenthesis to Bruce
Franklin's objection to the PL
Party: You should not attack the

leadership of the most heroic
anti-imperialist movement; we are
Americans, if we were Vietnamese
we would not dare do it . . . But
this is against historical
materialism, in other words,
idealistic: The leaders are believed
to be the conscience or
consciousness of the Vietnamese
struggle, so that the motive force
lays in their prestige and
authority, i.e., charisma; there is
some of that by now, sure, but
isn't Franklin succumbing to an
(anglo-) saxon hero worship? The
Vietnamese are fighting not for
their leadership but for their land,
their children, their political
economic integrity.)
Authoritarian
But the PL Party's position is

also authoritarian: There is no
voluntaristic nation. People are
not moved to form a nation by
some nationalist ideology. A
national community is formed by
objective conditions already there,
consequences of extended
historical process, that bind and
identify people together, that
make them want to live together.
Few countries have as extended
and vigorous a history of
nationalism as Vietnam, an almost
secular resistance against foreign
domination: This resistance of
communal integrity is what PL in
effect denies as it condemns the
nationalist aspect of this war.
PL wants to ignore the
objective local conditions, causes
and aims of the war, and impose
its ends over those of the
Vietnamese people. The French
Communist Party too wanted to
ignore nationalism : What were the
Algerians to say to a marxist who
told them their independence
would be won in Paris not in
Algeria?
The revolutionary duty to
criticize presupposes an ability to
understand.
I It is sad that the radicals should
be so primitive and rural in the
society that is at the vanguard of
international capitalism. When
will they break out of this ivory
tower, "an old rotten tooth"?
There is a certain complacency
no doubt in the knowledge that
one is living at the heart of the
problem. Knowing oneself to be
at the vanguard of the vanguard
inevitably fosters racist
temptations, now expressed as
provincialism.
Responsibility Greater
These people's responsibility is
greater because they are in the
most important country, and
begins with giving up parochial
perspectives.
Even PL's doctrine seems to
imply a practical imperative to
channel all energies into the
internal US scene: This is
strategically justified yet there is
there the prejudice similar to that
of Marx and Engels towards
Germany and the "Western
European" proletariat in general,
fonin proved them wrong; as he
proved PL wrong on nationalism
by rallying the nationalistic
movements to the revolution
against czarism.
One final remark: People were
apparently disturbed by what
they thought to be quasi-racist
overtones in Malik's statement
that he is from the Third World
and does know better. That
evenin, the fact did seem to be
that only he knew what goes on in
the Third World, as when arguing
for nationalism against PL.
Besides, as said, there is an
anti-authoritarian justification for
such a statement. Malik is no
racist.
What he was doing was pointing
out the ignorance of the people
who were there and the
irresponsibility of their
statements. A proverb says,
"When a man points at the moon,
the fool looks at the finger."
