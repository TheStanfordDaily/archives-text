Silent Majority
Editor, THE DAILY:
Has anyone wondered why the
famous "silent majority" is silent?
Maybe it's because they have
nothing to say, and no real reason
to say it anyway. Maybe the war
just does not personally affect
them enough to make it worth
their while to think about
alternatives.
The cornerstone of Nixonian
democratic theory seems to be
that a voting majority will nearly
always acquiesce in a policy,
however unwise, that invokes the
ancient virtues ("keeping our
nerve," etc.) and that only
personally impinges on a small,
discrete group.
The function of the Chief
Executive, within this theory, is
to supply a simple rationale for
those inclined to acquiesce.
Nixon's speech of November 3
came up with an image for the
easy use of those who have
learned to live with the war.
The image is Hue, and the
millions that will be slaughtered if
we withdraw from Vietnam.
The answer to this, it seems to
me, is the counter-example of
Taiwan. Surely, if the Nixon
Administration has even
considered the possibility of U.S.
withdrawal, a contingency plan
exists somewhere for the
transportation of those in South
Vietnam who fear for their lives
to a place of safety. Surely one of
our "allies," Australia, Japan, or
the Philippines, will be anxious to
lend sanctuary. No doubt it is too
much to suggest that our own
immigration laws might be relaxed
to make those whom we have
given lives to defend eligible for
residence in our own country.
The truth is, obviously, that it
has never even occurred to the
President that slaughter after
withdrawal might somehow be
avoided. The President needs the
spectre of apocalypse to bolster
his position, and so the spectre

takes on, in his eyes, a political
sort of truth. It supplies an absurd
rationale for an absurd war:
prolongation of the war saves
lives.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The people of Nairobi College
were very glad to see that the
Stanford Community is going to
actively participate in the
development and training of third
world leaders in their own
communities. This is something
that we have recognized for a long
time and which Stanford and its
students are just beginning to
realize.
While we see this as an attempt
to accomplish something that is
very necessary, we still believe
that the student body at Stanford
can do more. The Stanford

representatives have done a good
deal of organization both in the
dorms and off campus to facilitate
your giving books. While the Daily
did report this, it left out the
most important organizational
aspect of the book drive. What the
Daily failed to mention was that if
a person who lives off campus has
books he would like to have
picked up, he is to call 324-0444
at the Community House, or, in
the evenings or on the weekends,
327-7577 or 327-2920, ext. 253.
Another aspect of the drive that
was not mentioned was that
financial contributions for the
creation of a library are to be
mailed to P.O. Box 6170,
Stanford, California. The
headquarters for this book drive is
29W in Manzanita Park.
Thank you for your support.

exists somewhere for the
transportation of those in South
Vietnam who fear for their lives
to a place of safety. Surely one of
our "allies," Australia, Japan, or
the Philippines, will be anxious to
lend sanctuary. No doubt it is too
much to suggest that our own
immigration laws might be relaxed
to make those whom we have
given lives to defend eligible for
residence in our own country.
The truth is, obviously, that it
has never even occurred to the
President that slaughter after
withdrawal might somehow be
avoided. The President needs the
spectre of apocalypse to bolster
his position, and so the spectre

takes on, in his eyes, a political
sort of truth. It supplies an absurd
rationale for an absurd war:
prolongation of the war saves
lives.

Nairobi College
Editor, THE DAILY:
The people of Nairobi College
were very glad to see that the
Stanford Community is going to
actively participate in the
development and training of third
world leaders in their own
communities. This is something
that we have recognized for a long
time and which Stanford and its
students are just beginning to
realize.
While we see this as an attempt
to accomplish something that is
very necessary, we still believe
that the student body at Stanford
can do more. The Stanford

representatives have done a good
deal of organization both in the
dorms and off campus to facilitate
your giving books. While the Daily
did report this, it left out the
most important organizational
aspect of the book drive. What the
Daily failed to mention was that if
a person who lives off campus has
books he would like to have
picked up, he is to call 324-0444
at the Community House, or, in
the evenings or on the weekends,
327-7577 or 327-2920, ext. 253.
Another aspect of the drive that
was not mentioned was that
financial contributions for the
creation of a library are to be
mailed to P.O. Box 6170,
Stanford, California. The
headquarters for this book drive is
29W in Manzanita Park.
Thank you for your support.

Silent Majority
Editor, THE DAILY:
Has anyone wondered why the
famous "silent majority" is silent?
Maybe it's because they have
nothing to say, and no real reason
to say it anyway. Maybe the war
just does not personally affect
them enough to make it worth
their while to think about
alternatives.
The cornerstone of Nixonian
democratic theory seems to be
that a voting majority will nearly
always acquiesce in a policy,
however unwise, that invokes the
ancient virtues ("keeping our
nerve," etc.) and that only
personally impinges on a small,
discrete group.
The function of the Chief
Executive, within this theory, is
to supply a simple rationale for
those inclined to acquiesce.
Nixon's speech of November 3
came up with an image for the
easy use of those who have
learned to live with the war.
The image is Hue, and the
millions that will be slaughtered if
we withdraw from Vietnam.
The answer to this, it seems to
me, is the counter-example of
Taiwan. Surely, if the Nixon
Administration has even
considered the possibility of U.S.
withdrawal, a contingency plan
exists somewhere for the
transportation of those in South
Vietnam who fear for their lives
to a place of safety. Surely one of
our "allies," Australia, Japan, or
the Philippines, will be anxious to
lend sanctuary. No doubt it is too
