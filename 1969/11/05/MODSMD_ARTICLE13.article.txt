# Davis Review

University of California Regent
Glenn Campbell has urged a
review of Angela Davis's "fitness
to teach, based on her own public
statements."
The self-admitted Communist
and black UCLA philosophy
professor came under fire from
I Campbell, director of Stanford's
Hoover Institution, at a talk
Sunday on "The University and
Society" during the course of a
day-long meeting of 300 Stanford
alumni Sunday.
Campbell suggested that a
review of Miss Davis' fitness to
teach by the Academic Senate of
the University of California
"would go a long way toward
"restoring the confidence of the
people of the State of California
in their institutions of higher
learning."
He explained that his reference
to Miss Divis' public statements
included quotes in San Francisco
and Palo Alto papers of Oct. 25,
in which the UCLA professor
called "struggles to expose
imperialism" the real measure of
academic freedom and warned
that she would not "keep my
political opinions out of the
classroom when we have Fascist
opinions in the classroom
already."
Campbell, was quick to add his
conviction that "the holding or
advocacy of communist views is
not reason per se for
disqualification of an individual
from a teaching position. The
individual remains free
intellectually, restricted only by
the dictates of his conscience.
"It is, however, my contention
that an individual who is both a
Communist and a member of the
Communist Party is no longer free
intellectually.
"In addition to his conscience
and the norms of intellectual
honesty a Party member is
constrained by the strict
disciplinary rules of 'democratic
centralism' that govern
membership in any Communist
Party."
On the meaning of democratic
centralism, Campbell quoted the
speech of Chairman Henry

Winston to the 19th annual
convention of the Communist
Party, U.S.A., in May 1969:
"Democratic centralism in
indivisible. It must apply to all
policies, all decisions without
exception."
In the same talk, Campbell
continued, Winston urged that
"our organization of curricula, of
classes, of schools has to be
completely adapted to the
struggles to realize the program of
this Party."
The Regent said that in
proposing Academic Senate
review of Miss Davis' fitness to
teach based on her own
utterances:
"I want to make it very clear
that I am not questioning Miss
Davis' right to appear in Sproul
Hall Plaza (at Berkeley) or in the
places where public and political
speeches are allowed in any
other branch of the thiversity of
California or similar facilities in
other colleges and universities,
whether public or private.
"What I am questioning is her
ability to be objective in a
classroom—both on the basis of
her membership in the
Communist Party as well as her
own public statements."

"would go a long way toward
"restoring the confidence of the
people of the State of California
in their institutions of higher
learning."
He explained that his reference
to Miss Divis' public statements
included quotes in San Francisco
and Palo Alto papers of Oct. 25,
in which the UCLA professor
called "struggles to expose
imperialism" the real measure of
academic freedom and warned
that she would not "keep my
political opinions out of the
classroom when we have Fascist
opinions in the classroom
already."
Campbell, was quick to add his
conviction that "the holding or
advocacy of communist views is
not reason per se for
disqualification of an individual
from a teaching position. The
individual remains free
intellectually, restricted only by
the dictates of his conscience.
"It is, however, my contention
that an individual who is both a
Communist and a member of the
Communist Party is no longer free
intellectually.
"In addition to his conscience
and the norms of intellectual
honesty a Party member is
constrained by the strict
disciplinary rules of 'democratic
centralism' that govern
membership in any Communist
Party."
On the meaning of democratic
centralism, Campbell quoted the
speech of Chairman Henry

Winston to the 19th annual
convention of the Communist
Party, U.S.A., in May 1969:
"Democratic centralism in
indivisible. It must apply to all
policies, all decisions without
exception."
In the same talk, Campbell
continued, Winston urged that
"our organization of curricula, of
classes, of schools has to be
completely adapted to the
struggles to realize the program of
this Party."
The Regent said that in
proposing Academic Senate
review of Miss Davis' fitness to
teach based on her own
utterances:
"I want to make it very clear
that I am not questioning Miss
Davis' right to appear in Sproul
Hall Plaza (at Berkeley) or in the
places where public and political
speeches are allowed in any
other branch of the thiversity of
California or similar facilities in
other colleges and universities,
whether public or private.
"What I am questioning is her
ability to be objective in a
classroom—both on the basis of
her membership in the
Communist Party as well as her
own public statements."
University of California Regent
Glenn Campbell has urged a
review of Angela Davis's "fitness
to teach, based on her own public
statements."
The self-admitted Communist
and black UCLA philosophy
professor came under fire from

Hoover Institution, at a talk
Sunday on "The University and

alumni Sunday.
Campbell suggested that a
