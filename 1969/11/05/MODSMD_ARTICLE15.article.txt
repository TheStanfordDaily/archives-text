# Daily Free To Get Outside Legal Aid
## 
### 
The ASSU Publications Board
Monday eased an earlier
restriction that would have forced
I)ai 1 > editors to be bound by
decisions of University lawyers in
cases of questionable copy.
The Board, which oversees the
operations of student
publications, voted to allow the
I)aily to consult either Staff
Counsel (university lawyers) or an
outside attorney designated by
Publications Board and approved
by the Daily.
The new ruling allows
newspaper editors the option to
seek legal advice from outside the
University, particularly in cases
where university interests are at
stake.
Concern about procedures to
review potentially actionable copy
grew up among some members of
the ASSU Executive after Daily
libel insurance was cancelled this
fall. This is part of a trend of
reluctance by agencies to insure
student organizations. ASSU itself

is undergoing a rapid rise in its
insurance premium.
In similar action, the Board
asked that a legal study be
commissioned to study legal ties
between ASSU and the Chaparral,
and its Hammer and Coffin
Society business trust.
Student Financial Manager
David Swift and Council of
Presidents member Pat Shea urged
that steps be taken to protect the
Associated Students and the
university from the possibility of
lawsuits stemming from libelous
statements printed by the
biweekly magazine.
Swfit asked that Chaparral
either be brought under tighter
ASSU control or that all
ASSU-Chaparral ties be dissolved.
Chaparral spokesman Michael
Sweeney maintained that no legal
connection exists at present. The
legal advice, for which $300 was
appropriated by the student
Senate Monday night, will study
the relationship.
