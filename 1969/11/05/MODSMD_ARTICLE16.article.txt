# Firms Lure Grads
## 
### 
The proportion of June '69
graduates of Stanford Graduate
School of Business joining small
businesses (those with less than
1,000 employees) is up 75 per
cent over a year ago, according to
a placement study from the
School.
Forty-two percent of the class
joined small firms, compared with
24 percent in each of the last two
years. The very small businesses
(less than 100 employees) alone
attracted almost one-fourth (24%)
of the graduates. The percentage
joining small firms is the largest
since the School first started
issuing employment reports in
1964. By contrast, large firms
(more than 10,000 employees)
attracted 35 percent of the
graduates,a drop from 48 percent
in 1968, and from 56 percent two
years ago.
William L. Lowe, Stanford
Business School director of

placement, said, "The shift
toward small companies can
possibly be explained by several
factors unique to this graduating
class. This class is older, has had
more previous experience and
appears to be seeking
entrepreneurial opportunities
commensurate with its work
experience and education."
Other highlights of the survey:
Starting salaries â€”Average
starting salaries rose to $13,887, a
14.2 percent increase over last
year. Average salaries for those
with technical backgrounds were
up 11.9 percent, while those with
non-technical backgrounds rose
16.3 percent. However, Lowe said
the large number of graduates
with prior work experience
accounts for some of this high
increase. The experienced
category excludes military or
Peace Corps service.
