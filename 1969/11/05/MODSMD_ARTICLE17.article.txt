# Trailers Called A Success
## 
### DAVID HOSLEY 
| "Manzanita Park is the greatest
thing since creation."
Perhaps an exaggeration, but
that's how one resident describes
the new mobile home park off
Campus Drive.
The $1.3 million park, which
consists of 117 double trailers
grouped generally in clusters of
four, is nearly completed. New
residents found construction still
underway when they arrived in
late September.
Final landscaping touches were
completed this week, with only a
recreation center still under
construction. It will be finished
by November 16th, according to
Linda Fries, who directs the park
along with her husband, Robert, a
law student.
Puppet I) irector
Mrs. Fries describes her job as
that of a puppet. "But I've
rebelled," she adds. "I refuse to
be a policeman. The students and
I are powerless. The real problem
is with the administration."
On such issues as decoration of
trailers or protruding aerials, Mrs.
Fries says "I will not walk the
administration tightrope. I am
totally on the side of students."
She added that her part-time job
has turned into a full-time affair.
Mrs. Fries sees the
responsibility for structure in the
park falling on the residents, who
range from sophomores to grad
students. "I would like to see a
sense of community. I wish to
encourage students to make their
own rules."
Problem of Pets
Mrs. Fries specifically referred
to the problem of pets in the
trailer park. She feels residents
should petition for a rule change
if they want pets in their homes.
To date, the policy toward pets
has been the same as for illegally
parked cars. Violations are
officially ignored unless a specific
complaint is received by the
directors.
The exteriors of trailers have
remained unblemished except for
two homes, One was painted with
fluorescent Halloween symbols
last week. Just a cluster away, a
group painted their trailer with a
wide assortment of slogans and
symbols while they were high.
One of the park rules prohibits
painting of trailers except with
water-based paints.
Interiors of many trailers,
however, have been innovatively
decorated. The original decor was
described by one resident, Bill
Bower, as that of "a $16 motel
room." The mock wood paneling
is uniform throughout the three
bedrooms, two baths, kitchen and
living rooms of the trailers. It is
complemented by white ceilings.
A green carpet covers the living
room and hallway floors, and the
floors are all linoleum elsewhere.
I) or or Ideas
Posters and paintings are among
the usual decorations. But Asian
rugs have been used on walls and
to separate rooms. Many residents
have constructed book cases and
more daring have taken legs off
chairs, couches and beds and set
the furniture on the floor.
The mobile homes have held up
well, with only a few broken
windows and chairs. Escondido
Village's repair service drew praise

from many residents for quick
response to minor repairs. Upon
moving into the homes, renters
found vents unsecured, drapes and
light fixtures missing, reversed
water lines and faucets which
turned on backwards. After initial
corrections, the homes have
functioned well.
The primary complaint among
residents is the thinness of walls
which allows penetration of noise
from neighboring trailers.
Graduate students, wanting quiet
for studying, are most upset,
according to Mrs. Fries. Two
bands which practice at the park
have been a problem, but they
have been unable to find any
other place on campus to jam.
Meal Arrangements
Most trailerites agree they eat
well. Three alternatives have been
exercised. Some students,
primarily males, have joined
eating clubs or become associates
at dorms. The majority are
cooking for themselves in the
attractive gas kitchens, which are
complete with disposal,
refrigerator, oven and four-burner
stove. The food bill ranges from
$30 to $50 for a week's supply
for four persons.
A co-op to cut food costs is
being developed by Diane Parsons,
a member of the informal
committee which discusses
problems in the park and is open
to every resident. Now under
consideration by he
administration, Miss Parsons says
the co-op could be approved
within two weeks. She plans to
have the store, which would
supply canned, frozen and staple
foods at ten percent above
wholesale, operating a week later.
The food will come from the
school commissary and will
average 20 percent below local
• The co-op will be
housed in the
ba? w>n.
hallenge
"We rove ourselves,"
says Miss i ins, a food specialist
who quotes food prices with ease.
"Escondido has been trying to
have a co-op for four years and
hasn't succeeded. We will have to
form a corporation and obtain a
freezer. If the freezer is paid for
by the university, then the
membership fee will be one dollar.
If not, it will probably be three
dollars."
The inventory of co-op
products will be compiled after
the current consumption survey is
completed. A master list will be
made and the food purchased.
Law prohibits the sale of fresh
meat or produce.
Total cost of Manzanita Park,
according to Assistant Business

Manager for University Housing
Ed Scoles, is $1,350,000. The
mobile homes cost $900,000 and
development of the site was
$260,000. Furnishing for the
homes cost $108,000.
landscaping, which includes 800
new trees and shrubs, cost
$30,000. Iceplant was put in this
week, and the addition of a lawn
around the recreation room next
week will complete the
beautification program.
New Recreation C*
The recreation r will
contain eight washer two
large dryers, a kitch nding
machines,social room color
television set. Residents may
check out ironing boards and
vacuum cleaners at the recreation
room. A volleyball court and
mailbox will be nearby.
The clusters generally consist of
three trailers housing males and
one housing females, with a few
clusters having two of each. Some
cluster residents have gotten
together for barbecues, and many
of the males seek cooking advice
from their female neighbors. But
Mrs. Fries added that many of the
residents don't know their
neighbors.
Several persons interviewed
expressed a longing for social
involvement in the park. There is
a loosely organized social
committee which has decided to
charge a small fee for membership
in the park social club. While
regretting the lack of social
activities, Mrs. Fries added, "I
don't know if the club will work.
Students want some social life but
they don't want to pay."
Additional Items
A carpet sweeper for each
cluster has been ordered and
portable two-cycle bike racks will
arrive wi ; in two weeks. One item
missing i he beginning, a fourth
desk f< trailer, will not
arrive f< lother two months.
Resid> is generally feel the
rent price of $205 per quarter
compared with $160 in the dorms
in just. Ann Pollock thinks "the
price is fair in comparison with
other Stanford residences." There
are cases of more than the
assigned four students living in
each trailer. Adrian Arima says,
"If we pay rent then we should be
able to have as many people live
here as we want." Mrs. Fries says
she doesn't care how many people
live in one unit.
Stanford hopes to earn back
their investment by selling the
trailers at the end of five years.
Most students think they'll be
standing, but as one said, "I
wouldn't want to live in them
then." Mrs. Fries thinks students
will be forced to take good care of
the homes. "Escondido is very

tough on the condition of its
units. They will be in better
condition than the students
expect now. If they aren't, they'll
pay for everything that's wrong."
Quick Construction
The park was constructed in
less than four months. Assistant
Dean of Students William Leland
thinks a mobile home park is a
good response to an immediate
problem, "but we need long range
plans." Asked about the future of
the park site, he commented,
"There are no plans yet to
specifically replace the Manzanita
Park housing. There is no question
that there is a need for increased
graduate and undergraduate
housing." Two projects,
Escondido A and B, are already
under construction across the
street from the park.
Leland thinks the big demand
in the past several years for
campus housing is due to the
change to coed living. He is
chairman of a committee on
housing needs which will report to
President Pitzer next month.
The turnover at Manzanita Park
has been slight, with mostly males
who didn't like cooking moving
out. They have primarily been
replaced by females. There is a
waiting list of 100 girls wanting to
live in the park.

"Escondido has been trying to
have a co-op for four years and
hasn't succeeded. We will have to
form a corporation and obtain a
freezer. If the freezer is paid for
by the university, then the
membership fee will be one dollar.

Total cost of Manzanita Park,
according to Assistant Business

Manager for University Housing
Ed Scoles, is $1,350,000. The
mobile homes cost $900,000 and
development of the site was
$260,000. Furnishing for the
homes cost $108,000.
landscaping, which includes 800
new trees and shrubs, cost
$30,000. Iceplant was put in this
week, and the addition of a lawn
around the recreation room next
week will complete the
beautification program.
New Recreation C*
The recreation r will
contain eight washer two
large dryers, a kitch nding
machines,social room color
television set. Residents may
check out ironing boards and
vacuum cleaners at the recreation
room. A volleyball court and
mailbox will be nearby.
The clusters generally consist of
three trailers housing males and
one housing females, with a few
clusters having two of each. Some
cluster residents have gotten
together for barbecues, and many
of the males seek cooking advice
from their female neighbors. But
Mrs. Fries added that many of the
residents don't know their
neighbors.
Several persons interviewed
expressed a longing for social
involvement in the park. There is
a loosely organized social
committee which has decided to
charge a small fee for membership
in the park social club. While
regretting the lack of social
activities, Mrs. Fries added, "I
don't know if the club will work.
Students want some social life but
they don't want to pay."
Additional Items
A carpet sweeper for each
cluster has been ordered and
portable two-cycle bike racks will
arrive wi ; in two weeks. One item
missing i he beginning, a fourth
desk f< trailer, will not
arrive f< lother two months.
Resid> is generally feel the
rent price of $205 per quarter
compared with $160 in the dorms
in just. Ann Pollock thinks "the
price is fair in comparison with
other Stanford residences." There
are cases of more than the
assigned four students living in
each trailer. Adrian Arima says,
"If we pay rent then we should be
able to have as many people live
here as we want." Mrs. Fries says
she doesn't care how many people
live in one unit.
Stanford hopes to earn back
their investment by selling the
trailers at the end of five years.
Most students think they'll be
standing, but as one said, "I
wouldn't want to live in them
then." Mrs. Fries thinks students
will be forced to take good care of
the homes. "Escondido is very

tough on the condition of its
units. They will be in better
condition than the students
expect now. If they aren't, they'll
pay for everything that's wrong."
Quick Construction
The park was constructed in
less than four months. Assistant
Dean of Students William Leland
thinks a mobile home park is a
good response to an immediate
problem, "but we need long range
plans." Asked about the future of
the park site, he commented,
"There are no plans yet to
specifically replace the Manzanita
Park housing. There is no question
that there is a need for increased
graduate and undergraduate
housing." Two projects,
Escondido A and B, are already
under construction across the
street from the park.
Leland thinks the big demand
in the past several years for
campus housing is due to the
change to coed living. He is
chairman of a committee on
housing needs which will report to
President Pitzer next month.
The turnover at Manzanita Park
has been slight, with mostly males
who didn't like cooking moving
out. They have primarily been
replaced by females. There is a
waiting list of 100 girls wanting to
live in the park.
| "Manzanita Park is the greatest
thing since creation."
Perhaps an exaggeration, but
that's how one resident describes
the new mobile home park off
Campus Drive.
The $1.3 million park, which
consists of 117 double trailers
grouped generally in clusters of
four, is nearly completed. New
residents found construction still
underway when they arrived in
late September.
Final landscaping touches were
completed this week, with only a
recreation center still under
construction. It will be finished
by November 16th, according to
Linda Fries, who directs the park
along with her husband, Robert, a
law student.
Puppet I) irector
Mrs. Fries describes her job as
that of a puppet. "But I've
rebelled," she adds. "I refuse to
be a policeman. The students and
I are powerless. The real problem
is with the administration."
On such issues as decoration of
trailers or protruding aerials, Mrs.
Fries says "I will not walk the
administration tightrope. I am
totally on the side of students."
She added that her part-time job
has turned into a full-time affair.
Mrs. Fries sees the
responsibility for structure in the
park falling on the residents, who
range from sophomores to grad
students. "I would like to see a
sense of community. I wish to
encourage students to make their
own rules."
Problem of Pets
Mrs. Fries specifically referred
to the problem of pets in the
trailer park. She feels residents
should petition for a rule change
if they want pets in their homes.
To date, the policy toward pets
has been the same as for illegally
parked cars. Violations are
officially ignored unless a specific
complaint is received by the
directors.
The exteriors of trailers have
remained unblemished except for
two homes, One was painted with
fluorescent Halloween symbols
last week. Just a cluster away, a
group painted their trailer with a
wide assortment of slogans and
symbols while they were high.
One of the park rules prohibits
painting of trailers except with
water-based paints.
Interiors of many trailers,
however, have been innovatively
decorated. The original decor was
described by one resident, Bill
Bower, as that of "a $16 motel
room." The mock wood paneling
is uniform throughout the three
bedrooms, two baths, kitchen and
living rooms of the trailers. It is
complemented by white ceilings.
A green carpet covers the living
room and hallway floors, and the
floors are all linoleum elsewhere.
I) or or Ideas
Posters and paintings are among
the usual decorations. But Asian
rugs have been used on walls and
to separate rooms. Many residents
have constructed book cases and
more daring have taken legs off
chairs, couches and beds and set
the furniture on the floor.
The mobile homes have held up
well, with only a few broken
windows and chairs. Escondido
Village's repair service drew praise

from many residents for quick
response to minor repairs. Upon
moving into the homes, renters
found vents unsecured, drapes and
light fixtures missing, reversed
water lines and faucets which
turned on backwards. After initial
corrections, the homes have
functioned well.
The primary complaint among
residents is the thinness of walls
which allows penetration of noise
from neighboring trailers.
Graduate students, wanting quiet
for studying, are most upset,
according to Mrs. Fries. Two
bands which practice at the park
have been a problem, but they
have been unable to find any
other place on campus to jam.
Meal Arrangements
Most trailerites agree they eat
well. Three alternatives have been
exercised. Some students,
primarily males, have joined
eating clubs or become associates
at dorms. The majority are
cooking for themselves in the
attractive gas kitchens, which are
complete with disposal,
refrigerator, oven and four-burner
stove. The food bill ranges from
$30 to $50 for a week's supply
for four persons.
A co-op to cut food costs is
being developed by Diane Parsons,
a member of the informal
committee which discusses
problems in the park and is open
to every resident. Now under
consideration by he
administration, Miss Parsons says
the co-op could be approved
within two weeks. She plans to
have the store, which would
supply canned, frozen and staple
foods at ten percent above
wholesale, operating a week later.
The food will come from the
school commissary and will
average 20 percent below local
• The co-op will be
housed in the

The $1.3 million park, which
consists of 117 double trailers
grouped generally in clusters of
four, is nearly completed. New
residents found construction still
underway when they arrived in
late September.
Final landscaping touches were
completed this week, with only a
recreation center still under
construction. It will be finished
by November 16th, according to
Linda Fries, who directs the park
along with her husband, Robert, a
law student.
Puppet I) irector
Mrs. Fries describes her job as
that of a puppet. "But I've
rebelled," she adds. "I refuse to
be a policeman. The students and
I are powerless. The real problem
is with the administration."
On such issues as decoration of
trailers or protruding aerials, Mrs.
Fries says "I will not walk the
administration tightrope. I am
totally on the side of students."
She added that her part-time job
has turned into a full-time affair.
Mrs. Fries sees the
responsibility for structure in the
park falling on the residents, who
range from sophomores to grad
students. "I would like to see a
sense of community. I wish to
encourage students to make their
own rules."
Problem of Pets
Mrs. Fries specifically referred
to the problem of pets in the
trailer park. She feels residents
should petition for a rule change
if they want pets in their homes.
To date, the policy toward pets
has been the same as for illegally
parked cars. Violations are
officially ignored unless a specific
complaint is received by the
directors.
The exteriors of trailers have
remained unblemished except for
two homes, One was painted with
fluorescent Halloween symbols
last week. Just a cluster away, a
group painted their trailer with a
wide assortment of slogans and
symbols while they were high.
One of the park rules prohibits
painting of trailers except with
water-based paints.
Interiors of many trailers,
however, have been innovatively
decorated. The original decor was
described by one resident, Bill
Bower, as that of "a $16 motel
room." The mock wood paneling
is uniform throughout the three
bedrooms, two baths, kitchen and
living rooms of the trailers. It is
complemented by white ceilings.
A green carpet covers the living
room and hallway floors, and the
floors are all linoleum elsewhere.
I) or or Ideas
Posters and paintings are among
the usual decorations. But Asian
rugs have been used on walls and
to separate rooms. Many residents
have constructed book cases and
more daring have taken legs off
chairs, couches and beds and set
the furniture on the floor.
The mobile homes have held up
well, with only a few broken
windows and chairs. Escondido
Village's repair service drew praise

from many residents for quick
response to minor repairs. Upon
moving into the homes, renters
found vents unsecured, drapes and
light fixtures missing, reversed
water lines and faucets which
turned on backwards. After initial
corrections, the homes have
functioned well.
The primary complaint among
residents is the thinness of walls
which allows penetration of noise
from neighboring trailers.
Graduate students, wanting quiet
for studying, are most upset,
according to Mrs. Fries. Two
bands which practice at the park
have been a problem, but they
have been unable to find any
other place on campus to jam.
Meal Arrangements
Most trailerites agree they eat
well. Three alternatives have been
exercised. Some students,
primarily males, have joined
eating clubs or become associates
at dorms. The majority are
cooking for themselves in the
attractive gas kitchens, which are
complete with disposal,
refrigerator, oven and four-burner
stove. The food bill ranges from
$30 to $50 for a week's supply
for four persons.
A co-op to cut food costs is
being developed by Diane Parsons,
a member of the informal
committee which discusses
problems in the park and is open
to every resident. Now under
consideration by he
administration, Miss Parsons says
the co-op could be approved
within two weeks. She plans to
have the store, which would
supply canned, frozen and staple
foods at ten percent above
wholesale, operating a week later.
The food will come from the
school commissary and will
average 20 percent below local
• The co-op will be
housed in the
ba? w>n.
hallenge
"We rove ourselves,"
says Miss i ins, a food specialist
who quotes food prices with ease.
"Escondido has been trying to
have a co-op for four years and
hasn't succeeded. We will have to
form a corporation and obtain a
freezer. If the freezer is paid for
by the university, then the
membership fee will be one dollar.
If not, it will probably be three
dollars."
The inventory of co-op
products will be compiled after
the current consumption survey is
completed. A master list will be
made and the food purchased.
Law prohibits the sale of fresh
meat or produce.
Total cost of Manzanita Park,
according to Assistant Business

Manager for University Housing
Ed Scoles, is $1,350,000. The
mobile homes cost $900,000 and
development of the site was
$260,000. Furnishing for the
homes cost $108,000.
landscaping, which includes 800
new trees and shrubs, cost
$30,000. Iceplant was put in this
week, and the addition of a lawn
around the recreation room next
week will complete the
beautification program.
New Recreation C*
The recreation r will
contain eight washer two
large dryers, a kitch nding
machines,social room color
television set. Residents may
check out ironing boards and
vacuum cleaners at the recreation
room. A volleyball court and
mailbox will be nearby.
The clusters generally consist of
three trailers housing males and
one housing females, with a few
clusters having two of each. Some
cluster residents have gotten
together for barbecues, and many
of the males seek cooking advice
from their female neighbors. But
Mrs. Fries added that many of the
residents don't know their
neighbors.
Several persons interviewed
expressed a longing for social
involvement in the park. There is
a loosely organized social
committee which has decided to
charge a small fee for membership
in the park social club. While
regretting the lack of social
activities, Mrs. Fries added, "I
don't know if the club will work.
Students want some social life but
they don't want to pay."
Additional Items
A carpet sweeper for each
cluster has been ordered and
portable two-cycle bike racks will
arrive wi ; in two weeks. One item
missing i he beginning, a fourth
desk f< trailer, will not
arrive f< lother two months.
Resid> is generally feel the
rent price of $205 per quarter
compared with $160 in the dorms
in just. Ann Pollock thinks "the
price is fair in comparison with
other Stanford residences." There
are cases of more than the
assigned four students living in
each trailer. Adrian Arima says,
"If we pay rent then we should be
able to have as many people live
here as we want." Mrs. Fries says
she doesn't care how many people
live in one unit.
Stanford hopes to earn back
their investment by selling the
trailers at the end of five years.
Most students think they'll be
standing, but as one said, "I
wouldn't want to live in them
then." Mrs. Fries thinks students
will be forced to take good care of
the homes. "Escondido is very

tough on the condition of its
units. They will be in better
condition than the students
expect now. If they aren't, they'll
pay for everything that's wrong."
Quick Construction
The park was constructed in
less than four months. Assistant
Dean of Students William Leland
thinks a mobile home park is a
good response to an immediate
problem, "but we need long range
plans." Asked about the future of
the park site, he commented,
"There are no plans yet to
specifically replace the Manzanita
Park housing. There is no question
that there is a need for increased
graduate and undergraduate
housing." Two projects,
Escondido A and B, are already
under construction across the
street from the park.
Leland thinks the big demand
in the past several years for
campus housing is due to the
change to coed living. He is
chairman of a committee on
housing needs which will report to
President Pitzer next month.
The turnover at Manzanita Park
has been slight, with mostly males
who didn't like cooking moving
out. They have primarily been
replaced by females. There is a
waiting list of 100 girls wanting to
live in the park.

thing since creation."

freezer. If the freezer is paid for
by the university, then the
membership fee will be one dollar.

dollars."

Total cost of Manzanita Park,
according to Assistant Business

Manager for University Housing
Ed Scoles, is $1,350,000. The
mobile homes cost $900,000 and
development of the site was
$260,000. Furnishing for the
homes cost $108,000.
landscaping, which includes 800
new trees and shrubs, cost
$30,000. Iceplant was put in this
week, and the addition of a lawn
around the recreation room next
week will complete the
beautification program.
New Recreation C*
The recreation r will
contain eight washer two
large dryers, a kitch nding
machines,social room color
television set. Residents may
check out ironing boards and
vacuum cleaners at the recreation
room. A volleyball court and
mailbox will be nearby.
The clusters generally consist of
three trailers housing males and
one housing females, with a few
clusters having two of each. Some
cluster residents have gotten
together for barbecues, and many
of the males seek cooking advice
from their female neighbors. But
Mrs. Fries added that many of the
residents don't know their
neighbors.
Several persons interviewed
expressed a longing for social
involvement in the park. There is
a loosely organized social
committee which has decided to
charge a small fee for membership
in the park social club. While
regretting the lack of social
activities, Mrs. Fries added, "I
don't know if the club will work.
Students want some social life but
they don't want to pay."
Additional Items
A carpet sweeper for each
cluster has been ordered and
portable two-cycle bike racks will
arrive wi ; in two weeks. One item
missing i he beginning, a fourth
desk f< trailer, will not
arrive f< lother two months.
Resid> is generally feel the
rent price of $205 per quarter
compared with $160 in the dorms
in just. Ann Pollock thinks "the
price is fair in comparison with
other Stanford residences." There
are cases of more than the
assigned four students living in
each trailer. Adrian Arima says,
"If we pay rent then we should be
able to have as many people live
here as we want." Mrs. Fries says
she doesn't care how many people
live in one unit.
Stanford hopes to earn back
their investment by selling the
trailers at the end of five years.
Most students think they'll be
standing, but as one said, "I
wouldn't want to live in them
then." Mrs. Fries thinks students
will be forced to take good care of
the homes. "Escondido is very

tough on the condition of its
units. They will be in better
condition than the students
expect now. If they aren't, they'll
pay for everything that's wrong."
Quick Construction
The park was constructed in
less than four months. Assistant
Dean of Students William Leland
thinks a mobile home park is a
good response to an immediate
problem, "but we need long range
plans." Asked about the future of
the park site, he commented,
"There are no plans yet to
specifically replace the Manzanita
Park housing. There is no question
that there is a need for increased
graduate and undergraduate
housing." Two projects,
Escondido A and B, are already
under construction across the
street from the park.
Leland thinks the big demand
in the past several years for
campus housing is due to the
change to coed living. He is
chairman of a committee on
housing needs which will report to
President Pitzer next month.
The turnover at Manzanita Park
has been slight, with mostly males
who didn't like cooking moving
out. They have primarily been
replaced by females. There is a
waiting list of 100 girls wanting to
live in the park.
| "Manzanita Park is the greatest
thing since creation."
Perhaps an exaggeration, but
that's how one resident describes
the new mobile home park off
Campus Drive.
The $1.3 million park, which
consists of 117 double trailers
grouped generally in clusters of
four, is nearly completed. New
residents found construction still
underway when they arrived in
late September.
Final landscaping touches were
completed this week, with only a
recreation center still under
construction. It will be finished
by November 16th, according to
Linda Fries, who directs the park
along with her husband, Robert, a
law student.
Puppet I) irector
Mrs. Fries describes her job as
that of a puppet. "But I've
rebelled," she adds. "I refuse to
be a policeman. The students and
I are powerless. The real problem
is with the administration."
On such issues as decoration of
trailers or protruding aerials, Mrs.
Fries says "I will not walk the
administration tightrope. I am
totally on the side of students."
She added that her part-time job
has turned into a full-time affair.
Mrs. Fries sees the
responsibility for structure in the
park falling on the residents, who
range from sophomores to grad
students. "I would like to see a
sense of community. I wish to
encourage students to make their
own rules."
Problem of Pets
Mrs. Fries specifically referred
to the problem of pets in the
trailer park. She feels residents
should petition for a rule change
if they want pets in their homes.
To date, the policy toward pets
has been the same as for illegally
parked cars. Violations are
officially ignored unless a specific
complaint is received by the
directors.
The exteriors of trailers have
remained unblemished except for
two homes, One was painted with
fluorescent Halloween symbols
last week. Just a cluster away, a
group painted their trailer with a
wide assortment of slogans and
symbols while they were high.
One of the park rules prohibits
painting of trailers except with
water-based paints.
Interiors of many trailers,
however, have been innovatively
decorated. The original decor was
described by one resident, Bill
Bower, as that of "a $16 motel
room." The mock wood paneling
is uniform throughout the three
bedrooms, two baths, kitchen and
living rooms of the trailers. It is
complemented by white ceilings.
A green carpet covers the living
room and hallway floors, and the
floors are all linoleum elsewhere.
I) or or Ideas
Posters and paintings are among
the usual decorations. But Asian
rugs have been used on walls and
to separate rooms. Many residents
have constructed book cases and
more daring have taken legs off
chairs, couches and beds and set
the furniture on the floor.
The mobile homes have held up
well, with only a few broken
windows and chairs. Escondido
Village's repair service drew praise

from many residents for quick
response to minor repairs. Upon
moving into the homes, renters
found vents unsecured, drapes and
light fixtures missing, reversed
water lines and faucets which
turned on backwards. After initial
corrections, the homes have
functioned well.
The primary complaint among
residents is the thinness of walls
which allows penetration of noise
from neighboring trailers.
Graduate students, wanting quiet
for studying, are most upset,
according to Mrs. Fries. Two
bands which practice at the park
have been a problem, but they
have been unable to find any
other place on campus to jam.
Meal Arrangements
Most trailerites agree they eat
well. Three alternatives have been
exercised. Some students,
primarily males, have joined
eating clubs or become associates
at dorms. The majority are
cooking for themselves in the
attractive gas kitchens, which are
complete with disposal,
refrigerator, oven and four-burner
stove. The food bill ranges from
$30 to $50 for a week's supply
for four persons.
A co-op to cut food costs is
being developed by Diane Parsons,
a member of the informal
committee which discusses
problems in the park and is open
to every resident. Now under
consideration by he
administration, Miss Parsons says
the co-op could be approved
within two weeks. She plans to
have the store, which would
supply canned, frozen and staple
foods at ten percent above
wholesale, operating a week later.
The food will come from the
school commissary and will
average 20 percent below local
• The co-op will be
housed in the
ba? w>n.
