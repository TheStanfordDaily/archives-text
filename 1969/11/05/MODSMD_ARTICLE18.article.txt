# Political Union Dispute Settled
## 
### 
It looks as if the controversies
and problems which have plagued
the Stanford Political Union
Board (PUB) for the past year
may possibly be over.
Newly-appointed board member
Jerry Offstein reports that he has
been successful in, as he says,
"stabilizing the board and getting
to work on constructive actions."
The troubles of the PUB started
last spring when President Neil
Gordon resigned leaving many
problems behind him. After
Gordon resigned, board members
Roger Reed and Charles Marz
were made interim president and
vice president and they were left
with the task of trying to save the
board. Reed and Marz worked
over the summer to plan this
month's "America on the
Threshold of the Seventies"
symposium. Working with an
expected $5,000 budget, the PUB
lined up speakers including Sen.
Barry Goldwater, Rep. John
Tunney, San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto and Lt. Gov. Eld
Reinecke.
But early this fall the PUB was
once again hit by a number of
large problems. First of all, the
board was given only $1500 to
finance their activities including

the sumposium. And a large
controversy arose in early October
when Roger Wilner, President of
the Stanford Democratic Club,
charged the board with inviting
only right-wing speakers to their
symposium. Wilner accused both
Reed and Marz of "trying to
promulgate their own beliefs,"
and of "going after the Stanford
student body funds."
So the future of the PUB was in
dire jeopardy when three new
appointments to the board were
announced a few weeks ago.
Joining Reed and Marz on the
five-member board were Connie
Collier, Bob Cory, and Offstein.
Immediately after joining the
board, Offstein went to work to
try to alleviate the problems
facing the PUB.
Rivals Appeased
First of all, Offstein was
successful in getting long-time
rivals Wilner and Reed together
and he says he had "some
success" in mediating their
differences. Then realizing the
financial problems of this month's
symposium, Offstein tried
unsuccessfully to break the $2000
contract with Goldwater. As a last

measure Offstein and the board
decided to charge admission to
the symposium for people outside
of the Stanford community.
When questioned about the
charges that Reed had set up a
biased group of speakers, Offstein
claimed that such charges were
unfair. He claimed that Reed and
Marz had been put in inenviable
positions when they were
suddenly made leaders of the
board. He claimed that the
symposium is "pretty well
balanced politically.''
Furthermore he denied charges by
Wilner that an invitation had been
issued to New York conservative
William Buckley. Offstein said
that "no invitation was ever
to Buckley for this symposium.
Offstein says that if this
symposium is a financial success,
the PUB will be in "good shape."
He says that the five board
members are all quite interested in
constructive work and he says
they present the "necessary
political balance for the board's
success." He says that "all actions
of the board will be only by
complete agreement of the five
members."

Following the symposium,
Offstein plans to go before th,ki.
student Senate to try to get thV
funds necessary for the activities
of the board. He claims that the
PUB is the "most prestigious
group on campus as far as drawing
speakers is concerned," and thus
it deserves its fair share of ASSU
funds. Offstein says that once
they can get sufficient financial
backing, the PUB will begin
working on plans for another large
political symposium in the spring.
More immediate PUB plans call
for a speaking date by Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Jesse
Unruh.

Rivals Appeased
First of all, Offstein was
successful in getting long-time
rivals Wilner and Reed together
and he says he had "some
success" in mediating their
differences. Then realizing the
financial problems of this month's
symposium, Offstein tried
unsuccessfully to break the $2000
contract with Goldwater. As a last

measure Offstein and the board
decided to charge admission to
the symposium for people outside
of the Stanford community.
When questioned about the
charges that Reed had set up a
biased group of speakers, Offstein
claimed that such charges were
unfair. He claimed that Reed and
Marz had been put in inenviable
positions when they were
suddenly made leaders of the
board. He claimed that the
symposium is "pretty well
balanced politically.''
Furthermore he denied charges by
Wilner that an invitation had been
issued to New York conservative
William Buckley. Offstein said
that "no invitation was ever
to Buckley for this symposium.
Offstein says that if this
symposium is a financial success,
the PUB will be in "good shape."
He says that the five board
members are all quite interested in
constructive work and he says
they present the "necessary
political balance for the board's
success." He says that "all actions
of the board will be only by
complete agreement of the five
members."

Following the symposium,
Offstein plans to go before th,ki.
student Senate to try to get thV
funds necessary for the activities
of the board. He claims that the
PUB is the "most prestigious
group on campus as far as drawing
speakers is concerned," and thus
it deserves its fair share of ASSU
funds. Offstein says that once
they can get sufficient financial
backing, the PUB will begin
working on plans for another large
political symposium in the spring.
More immediate PUB plans call
for a speaking date by Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Jesse
Unruh.
It looks as if the controversies
and problems which have plagued
the Stanford Political Union
Board (PUB) for the past year
may possibly be over.
Newly-appointed board member
Jerry Offstein reports that he has
been successful in, as he says,
"stabilizing the board and getting
to work on constructive actions."
The troubles of the PUB started
last spring when President Neil
Gordon resigned leaving many
problems behind him. After
Gordon resigned, board members
Roger Reed and Charles Marz
were made interim president and
vice president and they were left
with the task of trying to save the
board. Reed and Marz worked
over the summer to plan this
month's "America on the
Threshold of the Seventies"
symposium. Working with an
expected $5,000 budget, the PUB
lined up speakers including Sen.
Barry Goldwater, Rep. John
Tunney, San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto and Lt. Gov. Eld
Reinecke.
But early this fall the PUB was
once again hit by a number of
large problems. First of all, the
board was given only $1500 to
finance their activities including

the sumposium. And a large
controversy arose in early October
when Roger Wilner, President of
the Stanford Democratic Club,
charged the board with inviting
only right-wing speakers to their
symposium. Wilner accused both
Reed and Marz of "trying to
promulgate their own beliefs,"
and of "going after the Stanford
student body funds."
So the future of the PUB was in
dire jeopardy when three new
appointments to the board were
announced a few weeks ago.
Joining Reed and Marz on the
five-member board were Connie
Collier, Bob Cory, and Offstein.
Immediately after joining the
board, Offstein went to work to
try to alleviate the problems
facing the PUB.
