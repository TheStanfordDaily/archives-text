# Dogs Kill Calves
## 
### 
Seven newborn calves have
been viciously mauled by dogs
roaming the hills behind Stanford
since September 1.
Manuel I. Piers, owner of the
Piers Dairy and of the slain cattle,
believes that the dogs, usually
German Shepherds, are family

pets illegally allowed to roam the
2300 acres bounded by Foothill
Boulevard, Alpine Road, and Page
Mill Road.
Piers has been threatening since
March to shoot any dogs he finds
bothering the cattle, but has not
been able to catch any so far.
Animal experts agree, however,
that the dogs are not a threat to
humans, since a dog can readily
distinguish between an animal and
a human, including a child.
