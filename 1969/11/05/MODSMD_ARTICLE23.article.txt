## 
### 
Two Stanford graduate
students, ardent conservationists,
have joined with some 71 others
to seek a nationwide, university
teach-in on environmental
problems.
In a letter to President Nixon,
Which students David P. Sachs and
David Rubin helped draft on
behalf of the Institute for the
Study of Health and Society, they
pointed out that: " . . .We are
convinced that Federal programs
for solving environmental
problems must be complemented
by relentless local action aimed at
increasing public awareness of this
situation's urgency. It is evident
that piecemeal, narrow,

uni disciplinary attempts to solve
these problems have not been, and
cannot be successful."
Therefore, in addition to
seeking a nationwide university
teach-in, the conservationists will
seek the help of "existing
professional societies,
environmental organizations and
(offer) guided tours of the leading
local polluters-government,
industry, or municipality," the
letter said.
The organization claims to
represent 350,000 "active young
professionals," according to the
letter. It also asked for creation of
a Federal advisory board and a
review commission "to correct
environmental degradation."
