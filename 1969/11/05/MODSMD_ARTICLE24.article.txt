# Stanford Climbers Scale El Capitan
## 
### MEL MALINOWSKI 
Few climbers venture onto the
awesome 3000 foot face of El
Capitan—greatest of the granite
monoliths in Yosemite Valley.
Yet the grandeur of this white
giant attracts many to study its
smooth face, and to yearn to
climb it, someday.
And some have. Five great
routes have been developed on El
Cap during the last 10 years. All
require tremendous skill, courage,
and endurance for their multiday
ascents.
Of these, the most recently
developed is the North American
Wall route: perhaps the most
fearsome climb in this country.
Yet two Stanford rock climbers,
Chuck Kroger and Scott Davis,
attempted the 3rd ascent of the
N.A. Wall just a few weeks ago.
First Climb Takes Nine Days
They are among just a handful
of climbers who have ever set foot
on the Wall. And of these, only
two teams had been successful.
The route was pioneered in
Cfctober 1964 by a team of four
led by Royal Robbins—the most
talented American climber today.
He said it involved the most
challenging climbing he had ever
encountered—working and living
up on the face for over nine
continuous days. Not until three
years later was another successful
attempt made.
And so as of this summer the
record of the North American
Wall stood at only two ascents in
five years.
During Reg week word spread
among Stanford Alpine Club
(SAC) climbers that a big climb
was in the offing. Chuck and
Scott were gathering together
dozens of extra knifeblade pitons,
rurps, and 'hero loops', items
needed only for delicate direct aid
climbing. And with all the fanfare
and publicity climbers usually
get—none—they set off for the
Valley.
Special Equipment Required
Climbing a 'Big Wall' requires
some very special equipment. This
is especially true of routes on
smooth El Capitan, which are
80-90% direct aid. Direct aid
enables climbing over sections so
featureless that free climbing isn't
possible. Metal pitons, orpins, are
driven into cracks and used as
supports as you proceed up, and
are removed behind you as you
go. .
With 100 lbs. of equipment,
including over 80 pitons ranging
from little postage-stamp size
RURPS to big 4 in. by 6 in.
'bong-bongs', Kroger and Davis
started up the North America Wall
on Thursday, October 2.
That first afternoon brought
them to the first extremely
difficult (A 5) direct aid section. It
was here that the leader of the
2nd ascent had fallen 30 feet and
broken several ribs. But Scott led
expertly, and finished the section
just after dark. As there weren't
any ledges handy, they spent the
night suspended in lightweight
nylon hammocks.
Nights Spent on Mountain Face
Hanging in a hammock on a
vertical face is much more
thrilling and spectacular than
comfortable, unfortunately, and
so at the first glow of dawn they
were off again. Friday was spent
working up over 700 feet of
moderate to difficult direct aid,
with a few spots of tricky free
climbing. This section alone
would be a challenging climb; but
it was merely the easiest day on
the N.A. Wall.
That night was spent on roomy
Big Sur Ledge—the only bivouac
during the whole ascent that
allowed sleeping on "solid
ground."
Chuck led the striking
"Borderline Traverse" the next
morning. After working 60 feet

up a crack, he clipped the rope
onto an anchor left by Robbins,
and lowered himself back to level
with Scott, but 30 feet away.
Then Scott, using a separate rope
attached to Chuck's waist, pulled
him sideways like a big pendulem,
and then let go. Swinging in a big
arc across the smooth face, Chuck
grabbed onto a rickety flake of
rock. He inched left by hanging
loops of nylon webbing from
small knobs on the edge of the
flake. A blank wall forced another
pendulum; after these two
difficult pendulums, retreat would
be extremely slow and difficult.
Close Calls for Climbers
They continued up to the
rotten, overhanging "Black
Dihedral"—a 400 foot "rotten,
ugly mess." And then came an
accident of the sort that gives
climbers nightmares. While
removing a piton, Scott cracked
his hammer. But they had the
foresight to carry a spare.
The Black Dihedral held yet
another close call. Chuck
accidently dislodged a 300 lb.
rock, which luckily missed Scott
as it plummeted 1500 feet to the
Valley floor. Being very careful
can reduce but not eliminate some
dangers in mountaineering: a
similar accident took a life this
summer on Klickitat Ridge of
Mount Rainier.
Nightfall found them at the
"Black Cave," a large indentation
with an overhanging ceiling, but
no bottom. So another night was
spent in hammocks. To conserve
weight, they had left their
sleeping bags behind, and they
found the nights uncomfortably
cold; but great fatigue made sleep
possible.
'Most Spectacular Lead'
Sunday morning came very
slowly, as they waited for enough
skyglow to reveal cracks so you
can push on. Scott aided up one
side of the overhang above, and
dangling from the lip of the
overhang, followed a horizontal
dike of aplite around the top. Due
to the difficult piton placements
and the incredible 1700 ft.
exposure, Royal Robbins feels
this is "the most spectacular lead
in American climbing."
Chuck led on up a series of
loose rock flakes that sprung out
more and more as you drove
pitons behind them. The pitons
below him wiggled out and jingled
down the rope to Scott. Certainly
no time for a fall! Finally Chuck
stepped up into the "Cyclops
Eye," an unlikely 200 ft. high,
100 ft. wide by 30 ft. deep
depression in the face—as with
most features on El Capitan,
bigger than life-size.
A nice place to rest? Yes. But
they pushed on, working the third
extremely difficult (A 5) section
on the Wall. In order to appreciate
how difficult A 5 really is, one
must realize that A 5 is the
category of the most difficult
direct aid possible. It often means
hanging from the tied-off tip of a
thin knifeblade piton, or from a
razorblade-like RURP (short for
Realized Ultimate Ifeality Piton).
Hammock Rips Out
Darkness forced the third
hanging bivouac. They ate a
modest meal of salami, cheese and
chocolate; they had taken only
about 2 lbs. of sausage, lVfe lbs.
cheese, a pound of chocolate, a
box of raisins, a gallon of grape
juice, and 5 gallons of water —for
five days.
Scott's hammock ripped out
that night, forcing him to
improvise with slings. Many nights
like that would be ruinous; but
fortunately, only one more day
remained.
Morning brought the most
dangerous pitch of the climb:
large angle pitons had to be placed
straight up between loose,
overhanging blocks. Scott made

this nerve-wracking lead without a
hitch. Several more sections of A 4
brought them to the "Igloo," a
sandy-floored cave just 300 feet
short of the top.
'Wall of Walls' Conquered
The last barrier faced them—a
tricky lead requiring many shakey
thin kniveblade placements.
Chuck led the truly fitting end to
this "Wall of Walls."
A few minutes after 2 on the
afternoon of Monday, October 6,
1969, Chuck Kroger and Scott
Davis stepped up on the top of El
Capitan—having achieved the 3rd
ascent of the formidable North
America Wall.

A few minutes after 2 on the
afternoon of Monday, October 6,
1969, Chuck Kroger and Scott
Davis stepped up on the top of El
Capitan—having achieved the 3rd
ascent of the formidable North
America Wall.

Few climbers venture onto the
awesome 3000 foot face of El
Capitan—greatest of the granite
monoliths in Yosemite Valley.
Yet the grandeur of this white
giant attracts many to study its
smooth face, and to yearn to
climb it, someday.
And some have. Five great
routes have been developed on El
Cap during the last 10 years. All
require tremendous skill, courage,
and endurance for their multiday
ascents.
Of these, the most recently
developed is the North American
Wall route: perhaps the most
fearsome climb in this country.
Yet two Stanford rock climbers,
Chuck Kroger and Scott Davis,
attempted the 3rd ascent of the
N.A. Wall just a few weeks ago.
First Climb Takes Nine Days
They are among just a handful
of climbers who have ever set foot
on the Wall. And of these, only
two teams had been successful.
The route was pioneered in
Cfctober 1964 by a team of four
led by Royal Robbins—the most
talented American climber today.
He said it involved the most
challenging climbing he had ever
encountered—working and living
up on the face for over nine
continuous days. Not until three
years later was another successful
attempt made.
And so as of this summer the
record of the North American
Wall stood at only two ascents in
five years.
During Reg week word spread
among Stanford Alpine Club
(SAC) climbers that a big climb
was in the offing. Chuck and
Scott were gathering together
dozens of extra knifeblade pitons,
rurps, and 'hero loops', items
needed only for delicate direct aid
climbing. And with all the fanfare
and publicity climbers usually
get—none—they set off for the
Valley.
Special Equipment Required
Climbing a 'Big Wall' requires
some very special equipment. This
is especially true of routes on
smooth El Capitan, which are
80-90% direct aid. Direct aid
enables climbing over sections so
featureless that free climbing isn't
possible. Metal pitons, orpins, are
driven into cracks and used as
supports as you proceed up, and
are removed behind you as you
go. .
With 100 lbs. of equipment,
including over 80 pitons ranging
from little postage-stamp size
RURPS to big 4 in. by 6 in.
'bong-bongs', Kroger and Davis
started up the North America Wall
on Thursday, October 2.
That first afternoon brought
them to the first extremely
difficult (A 5) direct aid section. It
was here that the leader of the
2nd ascent had fallen 30 feet and
broken several ribs. But Scott led
expertly, and finished the section
just after dark. As there weren't
any ledges handy, they spent the
night suspended in lightweight
nylon hammocks.
Nights Spent on Mountain Face
Hanging in a hammock on a
vertical face is much more
thrilling and spectacular than
comfortable, unfortunately, and
so at the first glow of dawn they
were off again. Friday was spent
working up over 700 feet of
moderate to difficult direct aid,
with a few spots of tricky free
climbing. This section alone
would be a challenging climb; but
it was merely the easiest day on
the N.A. Wall.
That night was spent on roomy
Big Sur Ledge—the only bivouac
during the whole ascent that
allowed sleeping on "solid
ground."
Chuck led the striking
"Borderline Traverse" the next
morning. After working 60 feet

up a crack, he clipped the rope
onto an anchor left by Robbins,
and lowered himself back to level
with Scott, but 30 feet away.
Then Scott, using a separate rope
attached to Chuck's waist, pulled
him sideways like a big pendulem,
and then let go. Swinging in a big
arc across the smooth face, Chuck
grabbed onto a rickety flake of
rock. He inched left by hanging
loops of nylon webbing from
small knobs on the edge of the
flake. A blank wall forced another
pendulum; after these two
difficult pendulums, retreat would
be extremely slow and difficult.
Close Calls for Climbers
They continued up to the
rotten, overhanging "Black
Dihedral"—a 400 foot "rotten,
ugly mess." And then came an
accident of the sort that gives
climbers nightmares. While
removing a piton, Scott cracked
his hammer. But they had the
foresight to carry a spare.
The Black Dihedral held yet
another close call. Chuck
accidently dislodged a 300 lb.
rock, which luckily missed Scott
as it plummeted 1500 feet to the
Valley floor. Being very careful
can reduce but not eliminate some
dangers in mountaineering: a
similar accident took a life this
summer on Klickitat Ridge of
Mount Rainier.
Nightfall found them at the
"Black Cave," a large indentation
with an overhanging ceiling, but
no bottom. So another night was
spent in hammocks. To conserve
weight, they had left their
sleeping bags behind, and they
found the nights uncomfortably
cold; but great fatigue made sleep
possible.
'Most Spectacular Lead'
Sunday morning came very
slowly, as they waited for enough
skyglow to reveal cracks so you
can push on. Scott aided up one
side of the overhang above, and
dangling from the lip of the
overhang, followed a horizontal
dike of aplite around the top. Due
to the difficult piton placements
and the incredible 1700 ft.
exposure, Royal Robbins feels
this is "the most spectacular lead
in American climbing."
Chuck led on up a series of
loose rock flakes that sprung out
more and more as you drove
pitons behind them. The pitons
below him wiggled out and jingled
down the rope to Scott. Certainly
no time for a fall! Finally Chuck
stepped up into the "Cyclops
Eye," an unlikely 200 ft. high,
100 ft. wide by 30 ft. deep
depression in the face—as with
most features on El Capitan,
bigger than life-size.
A nice place to rest? Yes. But
they pushed on, working the third
extremely difficult (A 5) section
on the Wall. In order to appreciate
how difficult A 5 really is, one
must realize that A 5 is the
category of the most difficult
direct aid possible. It often means
hanging from the tied-off tip of a
thin knifeblade piton, or from a
razorblade-like RURP (short for
Realized Ultimate Ifeality Piton).
Hammock Rips Out
Darkness forced the third
hanging bivouac. They ate a
modest meal of salami, cheese and
chocolate; they had taken only
about 2 lbs. of sausage, lVfe lbs.
cheese, a pound of chocolate, a
box of raisins, a gallon of grape
juice, and 5 gallons of water —for
five days.
Scott's hammock ripped out
that night, forcing him to
improvise with slings. Many nights
like that would be ruinous; but
fortunately, only one more day
remained.
Morning brought the most
dangerous pitch of the climb:
large angle pitons had to be placed
straight up between loose,
overhanging blocks. Scott made

this nerve-wracking lead without a
hitch. Several more sections of A 4
brought them to the "Igloo," a
sandy-floored cave just 300 feet
short of the top.
'Wall of Walls' Conquered
The last barrier faced them—a
tricky lead requiring many shakey
thin kniveblade placements.

brought them to the "Igloo," a
sandy-floored cave just 300 feet
short of the top.

Chuck led the truly fitting end to

A few minutes after 2 on the
afternoon of Monday, October 6,
1969, Chuck Kroger and Scott
Davis stepped up on the top of El
Capitan—having achieved the 3rd
ascent of the formidable North
America Wall.

Few climbers venture onto the
awesome 3000 foot face of El
Capitan—greatest of the granite
monoliths in Yosemite Valley.
Yet the grandeur of this white
giant attracts many to study its
smooth face, and to yearn to
climb it, someday.
And some have. Five great
routes have been developed on El
Cap during the last 10 years. All
require tremendous skill, courage,
and endurance for their multiday
ascents.
Of these, the most recently
developed is the North American
Wall route: perhaps the most
fearsome climb in this country.
Yet two Stanford rock climbers,
Chuck Kroger and Scott Davis,
attempted the 3rd ascent of the
N.A. Wall just a few weeks ago.
First Climb Takes Nine Days
They are among just a handful
of climbers who have ever set foot
on the Wall. And of these, only
two teams had been successful.
The route was pioneered in
Cfctober 1964 by a team of four
led by Royal Robbins—the most
talented American climber today.
He said it involved the most
challenging climbing he had ever
encountered—working and living
up on the face for over nine
continuous days. Not until three
years later was another successful
attempt made.
And so as of this summer the
record of the North American
Wall stood at only two ascents in
five years.
During Reg week word spread
among Stanford Alpine Club
(SAC) climbers that a big climb
was in the offing. Chuck and
Scott were gathering together
dozens of extra knifeblade pitons,
rurps, and 'hero loops', items
needed only for delicate direct aid
climbing. And with all the fanfare
and publicity climbers usually
get—none—they set off for the
Valley.
Special Equipment Required
Climbing a 'Big Wall' requires
some very special equipment. This
is especially true of routes on
smooth El Capitan, which are
80-90% direct aid. Direct aid
enables climbing over sections so
featureless that free climbing isn't
possible. Metal pitons, orpins, are
driven into cracks and used as
supports as you proceed up, and
are removed behind you as you
go. .
With 100 lbs. of equipment,
including over 80 pitons ranging
from little postage-stamp size
RURPS to big 4 in. by 6 in.
'bong-bongs', Kroger and Davis
started up the North America Wall
on Thursday, October 2.
That first afternoon brought
them to the first extremely
difficult (A 5) direct aid section. It
was here that the leader of the
2nd ascent had fallen 30 feet and
broken several ribs. But Scott led
expertly, and finished the section
just after dark. As there weren't
any ledges handy, they spent the
night suspended in lightweight
nylon hammocks.
Nights Spent on Mountain Face
Hanging in a hammock on a
vertical face is much more
thrilling and spectacular than
comfortable, unfortunately, and
so at the first glow of dawn they
were off again. Friday was spent
working up over 700 feet of
moderate to difficult direct aid,
with a few spots of tricky free
climbing. This section alone
would be a challenging climb; but
it was merely the easiest day on
the N.A. Wall.
That night was spent on roomy
Big Sur Ledge—the only bivouac
during the whole ascent that
allowed sleeping on "solid
ground."
Chuck led the striking
"Borderline Traverse" the next
morning. After working 60 feet

up a crack, he clipped the rope
onto an anchor left by Robbins,
and lowered himself back to level
with Scott, but 30 feet away.
Then Scott, using a separate rope
attached to Chuck's waist, pulled
him sideways like a big pendulem,
and then let go. Swinging in a big
arc across the smooth face, Chuck
grabbed onto a rickety flake of
rock. He inched left by hanging
loops of nylon webbing from
small knobs on the edge of the
flake. A blank wall forced another
pendulum; after these two
difficult pendulums, retreat would
be extremely slow and difficult.
Close Calls for Climbers
They continued up to the
rotten, overhanging "Black
Dihedral"—a 400 foot "rotten,
ugly mess." And then came an
accident of the sort that gives
climbers nightmares. While
removing a piton, Scott cracked
his hammer. But they had the
foresight to carry a spare.
The Black Dihedral held yet
another close call. Chuck
accidently dislodged a 300 lb.
rock, which luckily missed Scott
as it plummeted 1500 feet to the
Valley floor. Being very careful
can reduce but not eliminate some
dangers in mountaineering: a
similar accident took a life this
summer on Klickitat Ridge of
Mount Rainier.
Nightfall found them at the
"Black Cave," a large indentation
with an overhanging ceiling, but
no bottom. So another night was
spent in hammocks. To conserve
weight, they had left their
sleeping bags behind, and they
found the nights uncomfortably
cold; but great fatigue made sleep
possible.
'Most Spectacular Lead'
Sunday morning came very
slowly, as they waited for enough
skyglow to reveal cracks so you
can push on. Scott aided up one
side of the overhang above, and
dangling from the lip of the
overhang, followed a horizontal
dike of aplite around the top. Due
to the difficult piton placements
and the incredible 1700 ft.
exposure, Royal Robbins feels
this is "the most spectacular lead
in American climbing."
Chuck led on up a series of
loose rock flakes that sprung out
more and more as you drove
pitons behind them. The pitons
below him wiggled out and jingled
down the rope to Scott. Certainly
no time for a fall! Finally Chuck
stepped up into the "Cyclops
Eye," an unlikely 200 ft. high,
100 ft. wide by 30 ft. deep
depression in the face—as with
most features on El Capitan,
bigger than life-size.
A nice place to rest? Yes. But
they pushed on, working the third
extremely difficult (A 5) section
on the Wall. In order to appreciate
how difficult A 5 really is, one
must realize that A 5 is the
category of the most difficult
direct aid possible. It often means
hanging from the tied-off tip of a
thin knifeblade piton, or from a
razorblade-like RURP (short for
Realized Ultimate Ifeality Piton).
Hammock Rips Out
Darkness forced the third
hanging bivouac. They ate a
modest meal of salami, cheese and
chocolate; they had taken only
about 2 lbs. of sausage, lVfe lbs.
cheese, a pound of chocolate, a
box of raisins, a gallon of grape
juice, and 5 gallons of water —for
five days.
Scott's hammock ripped out
that night, forcing him to
improvise with slings. Many nights
like that would be ruinous; but
fortunately, only one more day
remained.
Morning brought the most
dangerous pitch of the climb:
large angle pitons had to be placed
straight up between loose,
overhanging blocks. Scott made

this nerve-wracking lead without a
hitch. Several more sections of A 4
brought them to the "Igloo," a
sandy-floored cave just 300 feet
short of the top.

improvise with slings. Many nights
like that would be ruinous; but
fortunately, only one more day
remained.
Morning brought the most
dangerous pitch of the climb:
large angle pitons had to be placed
straight up between loose,
overhanging blocks. Scott made

this nerve-wracking lead without a
hitch. Several more sections of A 4
brought them to the "Igloo," a
sandy-floored cave just 300 feet
short of the top.
'Wall of Walls' Conquered
The last barrier faced them—a
tricky lead requiring many shakey
thin kniveblade placements.
Chuck led the truly fitting end to
this "Wall of Walls."
A few minutes after 2 on the
afternoon of Monday, October 6,
1969, Chuck Kroger and Scott
Davis stepped up on the top of El
Capitan—having achieved the 3rd
ascent of the formidable North
America Wall.

Few climbers venture onto the
awesome 3000 foot face of El
Capitan—greatest of the granite
monoliths in Yosemite Valley.
Yet the grandeur of this white
giant attracts many to study its
smooth face, and to yearn to
climb it, someday.
And some have. Five great
routes have been developed on El
Cap during the last 10 years. All
require tremendous skill, courage,
and endurance for their multiday
ascents.
Of these, the most recently
developed is the North American
Wall route: perhaps the most
fearsome climb in this country.
Yet two Stanford rock climbers,
Chuck Kroger and Scott Davis,
attempted the 3rd ascent of the
N.A. Wall just a few weeks ago.
First Climb Takes Nine Days
They are among just a handful
of climbers who have ever set foot
on the Wall. And of these, only
two teams had been successful.
The route was pioneered in
Cfctober 1964 by a team of four
led by Royal Robbins—the most
talented American climber today.
He said it involved the most
challenging climbing he had ever
encountered—working and living
up on the face for over nine
continuous days. Not until three
years later was another successful
attempt made.
And so as of this summer the
record of the North American
Wall stood at only two ascents in
five years.
During Reg week word spread
among Stanford Alpine Club
(SAC) climbers that a big climb
was in the offing. Chuck and
Scott were gathering together
dozens of extra knifeblade pitons,
rurps, and 'hero loops', items
needed only for delicate direct aid
climbing. And with all the fanfare
and publicity climbers usually
get—none—they set off for the
Valley.
Special Equipment Required
Climbing a 'Big Wall' requires
some very special equipment. This
is especially true of routes on
smooth El Capitan, which are
80-90% direct aid. Direct aid
enables climbing over sections so
featureless that free climbing isn't
possible. Metal pitons, orpins, are
driven into cracks and used as
supports as you proceed up, and
are removed behind you as you
go. .
With 100 lbs. of equipment,
including over 80 pitons ranging
from little postage-stamp size
RURPS to big 4 in. by 6 in.
'bong-bongs', Kroger and Davis
started up the North America Wall
on Thursday, October 2.
That first afternoon brought
them to the first extremely
difficult (A 5) direct aid section. It
was here that the leader of the
2nd ascent had fallen 30 feet and
broken several ribs. But Scott led
expertly, and finished the section
just after dark. As there weren't
any ledges handy, they spent the
night suspended in lightweight
nylon hammocks.
Nights Spent on Mountain Face
Hanging in a hammock on a
vertical face is much more
thrilling and spectacular than
comfortable, unfortunately, and
so at the first glow of dawn they
were off again. Friday was spent
working up over 700 feet of
moderate to difficult direct aid,
with a few spots of tricky free
climbing. This section alone
would be a challenging climb; but
it was merely the easiest day on
the N.A. Wall.
That night was spent on roomy
Big Sur Ledge—the only bivouac
during the whole ascent that
allowed sleeping on "solid
ground."
Chuck led the striking
"Borderline Traverse" the next
morning. After working 60 feet

up a crack, he clipped the rope
onto an anchor left by Robbins,
and lowered himself back to level
with Scott, but 30 feet away.
Then Scott, using a separate rope
attached to Chuck's waist, pulled
him sideways like a big pendulem,
and then let go. Swinging in a big
arc across the smooth face, Chuck
grabbed onto a rickety flake of
rock. He inched left by hanging
loops of nylon webbing from
small knobs on the edge of the
flake. A blank wall forced another
pendulum; after these two
difficult pendulums, retreat would
be extremely slow and difficult.
Close Calls for Climbers
They continued up to the
rotten, overhanging "Black
Dihedral"—a 400 foot "rotten,
ugly mess." And then came an
accident of the sort that gives
climbers nightmares. While
removing a piton, Scott cracked
his hammer. But they had the
foresight to carry a spare.
The Black Dihedral held yet
another close call. Chuck
accidently dislodged a 300 lb.
rock, which luckily missed Scott
as it plummeted 1500 feet to the
Valley floor. Being very careful
can reduce but not eliminate some
dangers in mountaineering: a
similar accident took a life this
summer on Klickitat Ridge of
Mount Rainier.
Nightfall found them at the
"Black Cave," a large indentation
with an overhanging ceiling, but
no bottom. So another night was
spent in hammocks. To conserve
weight, they had left their
sleeping bags behind, and they
found the nights uncomfortably
cold; but great fatigue made sleep
possible.
'Most Spectacular Lead'
Sunday morning came very
slowly, as they waited for enough
skyglow to reveal cracks so you
can push on. Scott aided up one
side of the overhang above, and
dangling from the lip of the
overhang, followed a horizontal
dike of aplite around the top. Due
to the difficult piton placements
and the incredible 1700 ft.
exposure, Royal Robbins feels
this is "the most spectacular lead
in American climbing."
Chuck led on up a series of
loose rock flakes that sprung out
more and more as you drove
pitons behind them. The pitons
below him wiggled out and jingled
down the rope to Scott. Certainly
no time for a fall! Finally Chuck
stepped up into the "Cyclops
Eye," an unlikely 200 ft. high,
100 ft. wide by 30 ft. deep
depression in the face—as with
most features on El Capitan,
bigger than life-size.
A nice place to rest? Yes. But
they pushed on, working the third
extremely difficult (A 5) section
on the Wall. In order to appreciate
how difficult A 5 really is, one
must realize that A 5 is the
category of the most difficult
direct aid possible. It often means
hanging from the tied-off tip of a
thin knifeblade piton, or from a
razorblade-like RURP (short for
Realized Ultimate Ifeality Piton).
Hammock Rips Out
Darkness forced the third
hanging bivouac. They ate a
modest meal of salami, cheese and
chocolate; they had taken only
about 2 lbs. of sausage, lVfe lbs.
cheese, a pound of chocolate, a
box of raisins, a gallon of grape
juice, and 5 gallons of water —for
five days.

fortunately, only one more day
