# Week's Films
## Wells and Wilder Coming to Campus 
### 
Any weekend during which
Citizen Kane is shown is at least
noteworthy, but when Welles is
joined by Wilder, Godard and
Lester, campus screens become
very well filled indeed.
The Married Woman is one of
Jean-Luc Godard's least successful
films, less entertaining and more
arbitrary in its effects than most
of his other works. Upon its
completion in 1964, the picture
was suppressed in France, not for
the usual political reasons, but
because of its highly
uncomplimentory portrait of
French women and married life.
At Tresidder on Friday.
As it is universally accepted as
one of the two or three greatest
films of all time, there isn't much
one can add about Orson Welles'
Citizen Kane. Those who have
never seen it must consider it
mandatory viewing and those who
have will undoubtedly want to see
it again. This cinematic feast will
be shown Friday evening in
Cubberley.

After Sunset Boulevard, most
of Hollywood's reflections upon
itself have seemed tame and
relatively frivolous. Drawing upon
the myths of Hollywood's past
with the aid of Gloria Swanson,
William Holden, Erich von
Stroheim, Fred Clark, Cecil B. De
Mille, Hedda Hopper and Buster
Keaton, Billy Wilder has created a
hauntingly devastating picture,
which will be shown at Tresidder
on Saturday.
Despite increasing criticism of
Richard Lester's rapid fire
technique, the director was the
ideal collaborator for the Beatles
and Help! remains a highly
engaging film, if not as ultimately
satisfying as A Hard Day's Night.
The group's second film is
Sunday's flick at Mem Aud.
In Monday's column, I
anticipated tonight's showing of
Blow lip. Unfortunately, Blow Up
will not be shown tonight, as
indicated on the University
calendar. It will be presented
November 15, in Cubberley, at
7,9, and 11.
