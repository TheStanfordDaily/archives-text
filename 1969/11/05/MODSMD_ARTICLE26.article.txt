### Elizabeth Hecker 
Once upon a time
there was a Maker
Slowly the Maker designed
a world full of
many beautiful things
sky
green growing things
fertile things
fluid things
dry things
and last of all
he fashioned
Man.
Some legends claim
that man and woman
were created together
as one body
But the gods
seeing how powerful
man was
divided him into
man and woman.
So that man could
no longer compete
with the gods but
would spend their
lifetimes searching
for their other half.
Of all of the creatures
which the Maker designed
he was the most generous
with man.
Giving him the ability
to think
to be creative
to survive.
He made him curious
inventive
and able to make full
use of his environment.
The Maker provided man
with clean air to breathe
pure water to drink
clean soil to grow his food
flowers for his senses
fish which were good to eat
and birds to delight
his eye and feed him.
These were all given freely.
And in addition every
man was given one body
each designed a
little different.
Some tall, some small
some dark, some light
some frail, some sturdy.
Every man given their
body to use in whatever
way they might choose.
Some people choose
to go without clothes
and others prefer
a covering
which they wear
niglit and day.
Some become so fond of
their coverings that they
use them to distinguish
one brother from another
forgetting that we are
all held together
by bones of the same fiber.
And then the first
men explored their world
to see what the Maker
had given.
They adapted the rivers
and oceans and lakes
to their own purposes.
Man fished, many bathed
and many channeled the wati
for use in industry.
And some found thai they
had wastes and byproducts
to get rid of and they
put them into the waters.
And after awhile the plants

which grow in the water
died.
And the fish could
not survive.
Other men used air in the
same way.
They sent their smoke and
chemicals up into the air
forgetting that they were
befouling the air
for their brothers.
But there were some men
who looked after their
brothers. However they
felt that their brothers
included only those
who saw the world
as they did.
So they went to war
every body
against
some body
and burned people
and wounded
and killed
in order to
protect their belief.
And they forgot that
the men who had other
beliefs
were also their brothers.
But still there were
some men and women
who did remember
that in the beginning
we were all one.
One body (perhaps)
one spirit, in many bodies
Bodies of all shades
all persuasions
Bodies with all of the
senses to enjoy
to smell
to taste
to know what it is to
hear and see another person
to touch another person
with your hand
with your heart
and to be touched
by another person
warmly
deeply
with respect
with gentleness
what it means to unit
with another person
in thought
in body
in rhythm
what it means to feel
complete
with another person
and from this completion
to create
to be like the Maker
To bring forth
another man
another woman
a small creature
capable of love
a creature
able to be loving
not only of other
creatures exactly
like himself
but all of his brothers
all of man family
the old as well as the young
the lonely
the desparate
the tired
the discouraged
the angry
the bitter
the weak
and especially those
who are not
able to return
love.

with the gods but
would spend their
lifetimes searching
for their other half.
Of all of the creatures
which the Maker designed
he was the most generous
with man.
Giving him the ability
to think
to be creative
to survive.
He made him curious
inventive
and able to make full
use of his environment.
The Maker provided man
with clean air to breathe
pure water to drink
clean soil to grow his food
flowers for his senses
fish which were good to eat
and birds to delight
his eye and feed him.
These were all given freely.
And in addition every
man was given one body
each designed a
little different.
Some tall, some small
some dark, some light
some frail, some sturdy.
Every man given their
body to use in whatever
way they might choose.
Some people choose
to go without clothes
and others prefer
a covering
which they wear
niglit and day.
Some become so fond of
their coverings that they
use them to distinguish
one brother from another
forgetting that we are
all held together
by bones of the same fiber.
And then the first
men explored their world
to see what the Maker
had given.
They adapted the rivers
and oceans and lakes
to their own purposes.
Man fished, many bathed
and many channeled the wati
for use in industry.
And some found thai they
had wastes and byproducts
to get rid of and they
put them into the waters.
And after awhile the plants

which grow in the water
died.
And the fish could
not survive.
Other men used air in the
same way.
They sent their smoke and
chemicals up into the air
forgetting that they were
befouling the air
for their brothers.
But there were some men
who looked after their
brothers. However they
felt that their brothers
included only those
who saw the world
as they did.
So they went to war
every body
against
some body
and burned people
and wounded
and killed
in order to
protect their belief.
And they forgot that
the men who had other
beliefs
were also their brothers.
But still there were
some men and women
who did remember
that in the beginning
we were all one.
One body (perhaps)
one spirit, in many bodies
Bodies of all shades
all persuasions
Bodies with all of the
senses to enjoy
to smell
to taste
to know what it is to
hear and see another person
to touch another person
with your hand
with your heart
and to be touched
by another person
warmly
deeply
with respect
with gentleness
what it means to unit
with another person
in thought
in body
in rhythm
what it means to feel
complete
with another person
and from this completion
to create
to be like the Maker
To bring forth
another man
another woman
a small creature
capable of love
a creature
able to be loving
not only of other
creatures exactly
like himself
but all of his brothers
all of man family
the old as well as the young
the lonely
the desparate
the tired
the discouraged
the angry
the bitter
the weak
and especially those
who are not
able to return
love.
