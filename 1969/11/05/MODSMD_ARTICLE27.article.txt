# SES Seeks Athletic Changes
## 
### FRED MANN First of a Two Part Series 
Radical structural and
directional changes for the
Department of Athletics have
been recommended in the recent
report of the Athletics
Subcommittee of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES).
The report on sports and
recreation is a part of the larger
"Report to the University on the
Extra-Curriculum," researched
and written last year. The
Athletics Subcommittee was
composed of two students and
seven faculty members.
In the -17 pages devoted to
athletics, the committee called for
a total overhaul of the current
departmental structure, to be
replaced by two separate
departmentsâ€”one of Physical
Education, and the other of
Athletics.
They further requested the
merger of the men's and women's
physical education departments,
more emphasis on the intramural
sports program, and the closer
integration of the intercollegiate
athletic program with the
Stanford community.
Changes were also
recommended in the procedures
of coach selections, athletic
recruiting, scheduling, and athlete
admission standards.

Generally speaking, the
tradition-minded department
welcomed the proposed changes.
"I'm pleased with the report,"
said Stanford Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor. "They (the
committee) seemed to react
favorably to our department as a
whole. I think their ideas will help
improve our program overall."
Under the current system,
Taylor is head of all athletic
activities at Stanford. These
include the physical education
program, intramurals, the
professional graduate program,
and all intercollegiate sports.
Due to the large scale of the
intercollegiate program and its
financial importance to the whole
department, Taylor necessarily
must devote most of his time to
this area.
Shift Emphasis
The committee felt that a
separation of departments into
Athletics (handling just the
intercollegiate program) and
Physical Education (combining
everything else) would be more
effective. It would place greater
emphasis on the recreational
sports (phys ed classes and
intramurals) which currently
involve nearly 9,000 students.
Many participate i.. n'ibre f.han
one activity.
The report termed athletics

"the major, organized
extra-curricular activity of the
University."
The committee, chaired by
Marvin Chodorow, Professor of
Applied Physics, felt that with the
separation of the men's
department, men's and women's
physical education should be
combined for economic reasons.
Approximately 60 per cent of all
American universities operate in
this fashion.
''With, a combined
department," stated Taylor, "One
director could run one larger
a ministrative facility. It's
practical."
Women and Men
Miss Pamela Strathairn,
chairman of the Women's Physical
Education Department, agreed.
"Physical education is a single
discipline," she said. "There is no
women's course that a man could
not enroll in. Putting men and
women together would increase
the teaching faculty and give us
greater flexability in offering
courses. With more talent in
teaching comes improvement in
quality."
Economic Decision
The economic aspects of the
switch over played an important
part in the committee's decision.
Committee member Robert A.
Helliwell, Professor of Electrical
Engineering, called for a boosting
in support for the phys ed
programs. "Sports (physical
education and intramurals) need a

bigger guaranteed income to
grow," he remarked. "Separating
the intercollegiate program should
help in this area."
Currently, the intercollegiate
sports more than pay for
themselves. Football carries the
burden in all universities of being
the real money maker.
Any profits trom the program
are shared by the intercollegiate
sports and PE program. The
University annually subsidizes the
physical education program for
$328,000. But both Taylor and
Helliwell agree that it is not
enough.
With a separate budget and
administration, the PE
department could improve its
programs both instructionally and
in facilities for intramurals and
.club sports.
Department Disent
Although many members of the
Athletic Department supported
the recommended split, the
acceptance was not unanimous.
Wesley K. Ruff, Associate
Professor of Physical Education
and Education, stated he would
"hate to see them (the sports
programs) split. I want changes
made, but only for the right
reasons."
He invited the SES committee
to "come see the program before
condemning it. The athletic
program is a learning situation. If

it is not educational, then we
should not have it at all."
Ruff felt faculty effectiveness
would not greatly improve with a
combined men's and women's
department. "The physical
facilities are so spread out across
the campus that the same
manpower would have to be used.
One person would be operating
each facility, and that's the way it
is now."
Fair Report?
Members of he staffs differed
on their views of the report itself.
"No effort was made to judge the
program," said Ruff. "They (the
committee) imply that it's not top
quality."
Miss Strathairn disagreed,
calling it "a well-writen,
thoughtful, highly objective
report. It's too bad some people
see the report as a spanking to the
department."
Professor Helliwell defended
the committee, noting the time
handicap under which they
labored. "We did the best we
could in such a short period," he
commented. "Many aspects of the
problem need further study. We
recommend an implementation
committee to look into the
situation."
A second set of
recommendations concerned the
intercollegiate program and the
athlete at Stanford.
(The problems of the athlete
will be discussed in Part Two,
tomorrow.)
