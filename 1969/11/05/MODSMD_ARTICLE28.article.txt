Goals by Chip Jessup and Mark
Smith and a pair of assists by left
wing A 1 Houghton were combined
with a non-porous defense last
Saturday to power the Indians to
a 2-0 soccer win over California.
But remembrance of the upset
triumph will be short-lived if the
Tribe can't stay hot against its
next two opponents: University
of San Francisco and San Jose
State. Stanford travels to face the
number two ranked Dons this
afternoon, then plays Saturday
night in San Jose against the
number four ranked Spartans.
The Cal game opened with both
teams using a fast break and a
strong man-to-man defense, but
with six minutes remaining in the
first quarter, Jessup used
Houghton's pass in front of the
Bear net to score.
The second and third periods

were scoreless, but the Indians
iced the contest with a goal
seventeen minutes into the fourth
quarter as Smith tallied after a
goal-mouth pass from Houghton.
The defense was anchored
throughout by goalie Woody
Hagge and center half Ben White.
In the eight games to date the
Stanford defense has allowed an
average of 1.9 goals per game
while the offense has averaged 2.5
goals per game.
The triumph brought the
Indians' record to 5-3, with five
games remaining.

Cal coach Bob DiGrazia was
less than pleased with his team's
performance. Although missing
the game himself (he had the flu),
after hearing from JV pilot
George Roussakis DiGrazia
complained that "we just got
beaten to the ball too often. We

appeared to be the better team, as
we took 17 first half shots to their
two, but they put it in the net."
Cal's sports publicity
department, meanwhile, gripes
that "looking ahead to (their) San
Jose struggle may have cost the
Bears a win over Stanford." But
DiGrazia claims that his team
won't be looking past anyone
when they host the Spartans
today. Neatly summing up his
opponent, the Cal coach said of
SJS, "They have excellent
balance. They seem to have no
weakness, although they're a bit
weak in the goalie position."
In other games, the Stanford
Frosh shut out the Bear Cubs 2-0
for their first win. Reserve goalie
Stan Smith blocked a penalty shot
to insure the shutout and Rocky
Barber scored both goals.
Stanford's Braves lost 2-1 to the

won't be looking past anyone
when they host the Spartans
today. Neatly summing up his
opponent, the Cal coach said of
SJS, "They have excellent
balance. They seem to have no
weakness, although they're a bit
weak in the goalie position."
In other games, the Stanford
Frosh shut out the Bear Cubs 2-0
for their first win. Reserve goalie
Stan Smith blocked a penalty shot
to insure the shutout and Rocky
Barber scored both goals.
Stanford's Braves lost 2-1 to the
Berkeley JV.
Goals by Chip Jessup and Mark
Smith and a pair of assists by left
wing A 1 Houghton were combined
with a non-porous defense last
Saturday to power the Indians to
a 2-0 soccer win over California.
But remembrance of the upset
triumph will be short-lived if the
Tribe can't stay hot against its
next two opponents: University
of San Francisco and San Jose
State. Stanford travels to face the
number two ranked Dons this
afternoon, then plays Saturday
night in San Jose against the
number four ranked Spartans.
The Cal game opened with both
teams using a fast break and a
strong man-to-man defense, but
with six minutes remaining in the
first quarter, Jessup used
Houghton's pass in front of the
Bear net to score.
The second and third periods

were scoreless, but the Indians
iced the contest with a goal
seventeen minutes into the fourth
quarter as Smith tallied after a
goal-mouth pass from Houghton.
The defense was anchored
throughout by goalie Woody
Hagge and center half Ben White.
In the eight games to date the
Stanford defense has allowed an
average of 1.9 goals per game
while the offense has averaged 2.5
goals per game.
The triumph brought the
Indians' record to 5-3, with five
games remaining.
Sour Grapes in Berkeley
Cal coach Bob DiGrazia was
less than pleased with his team's
performance. Although missing
the game himself (he had the flu),
after hearing from JV pilot
George Roussakis DiGrazia
complained that "we just got
beaten to the ball too often. We

appeared to be the better team, as
we took 17 first half shots to their
two, but they put it in the net."
Cal's sports publicity
department, meanwhile, gripes
that "looking ahead to (their) San
Jose struggle may have cost the
Bears a win over Stanford." But
DiGrazia claims that his team
won't be looking past anyone
when they host the Spartans
today. Neatly summing up his
opponent, the Cal coach said of
SJS, "They have excellent
balance. They seem to have no
weakness, although they're a bit
weak in the goalie position."
In other games, the Stanford
Frosh shut out the Bear Cubs 2-0

Stan Smith blocked a penalty shot
to insure the shutout and Rocky
