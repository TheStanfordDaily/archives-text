Environmental pollution,
rapidly multiplying population,
and drug abuse are three of the
major California crises that
students can and should offer
constructive action on, Lieutenant
Governor Ed Reinecke said
yesterday.
"If you are not willing to do
something about the problems that
plague California," Reinecke said,
"You should not criticize those
who are trying."
Though urging constructive
action on the part of students,
Reinecke reiterated his opposition
to a voting age of 18. He admitted
that the setting of any specific age
is in a sense "arbitrary" and that
his views on the subject had
"softened" recently. Still, the
national voting age is 21, and
"that is where I feel the California
voting age should remain," he told
the group of about 1 00 students.
Dealing first with the problem
of drug abuse, Reinecke said that
students could effectively help
curb the problem by talking to
friends who use drugs and urging
them to stop. He challenged
students to show drug users how
seriously user's ability and
productivity is being impaired.
Reinecke, who also serves as
Chairman of the Governor's Task
Force on Narcotics Enforcement,
revealed that he spent more than

three hours last week as an
anonymous observer in a therapy
session with 12 narcotics addicts.
He has concluded, that the
narcotics problem is symptomatic
of a basic problem which goes far
deeper.
"There is a drastic gap of belief
in our society, a basic
disenchantment with our values,"
Reinecke declared. He said this
was contributing to many drug
addicts' decision to "drop out."
In his initial remarks, he issued
a serious warning of the problems

that California's rapid population
growth will create. Between now
and the year 2000, he said, the
population of California will
double. "This means that every
service we have today —every
hospital, every school, every
highway—will have to be doubled
in 30 years."
In relation to his remarks on
population increase, he was asked
why he opposed the legalization
ot abortions. Reinecke answered
that abortions are a moral and
legal issue and that "government
cannot legislate in the area of
morality."
In discussing California's
environmental problems, the
Lieutenant Governor warned, "We
are going to go down in a cloud of
pollution just from the increase in
population alone." In thirty years,
he said, we will be using four to
six times the amount of polluting
resources, such as oil, that we are
using now.
He told the group that he was
"delighted" to see the State
Senate pass the Petris bill, which
would have eventually eliminated
the internal combustion engine in
California cars. The bill, which
was defeated in the Assembly,
"would have served notice to
Detroit that they better get
moving on developing a new type
of engine."
