# Harriers Beat SJS But Car Drowns

### FRED LEESON 
Reports of suicide have been
discounted in favor of accidental
death in the case of the car which
plunged into the lake at Coyote
Park in San Jose following the
SJS-Stanford cross country
Saturday morning.
Witnesses reported that
following Stanford's five-man first
place sweep of the Spartans, an
unmanned auto silently rolled
into the lake during the junior
varsity race, also won by
Stanford. The varsity score was
15-46.
"Despite futile efforts by
members of the Stanford varsity
and the car's owner," reported
Indian Coach Marshall Clark, "the
car disappeared to the bottom of
the lake within a matter of
minutes."
Greg Brock, Chuck Menz, Don
Kardong, Robert Coe and Jack
Lawson all covered the 4.1 mile
course in 21:06, 35 seconds ahead
of Buck Black, SJS's first runner.
Freshman Brian Mittelstaedt
won the second race in 22:09.5,

leading the frosh to a 33-35-66
finish over the Stanford Braves
and the San Jose State junior
varsity.
The other two varsity
competitors, Decker Underwood
and Chuck Dyer, places seventh
and 10th.
This Saturday at 10:30 a.m. the
Stanford harriers take on
California at the second tee of the
Stanford golf course.
If comparative scores from
common opponents are any
indication, the Tribe should
stretch its dual meet record to 4-1
with a victory over the Bears.
However, Cal's Bob Waldon has
been consistently strong all year,
and Cliff West, who ran with a
cold in the Bears' close loss to
USC last week, should be back at
full strength.
Cal Coach Dave Maggard rates
the Indians as co-favorites with
Oregon to win the PAC-8 title,
but the Tribe will need a strong
team effort to hold off the Bears.
