was Tom Jordan's (El Toro)
10:05, followed by Sterling
Speirn (Soto) in 1 0:11, Ray White
(Stanford Running Club) in
10:14, Whiting (Angell Field
Ancients) in 10:18, and Wagstaff
(Soto) in 10:23, over the two mile
course.
The times were somewhat
slower '.han last year, partly due
to the course being about 50
yards longer this year.
The official scoring was broken
down into graduate and
undergraduate divisions, with the
low score winning. The
undergraduate champions are, as
in the previous two years, El Toro
with Jordan, Heffern, and Rund.
Their score was 17 to Soto's 26
and Theta Chi's 39.
The graduate division was
dominated by the year old

Stanford Running Club with its
considerable depth. If both
divisions were scored together the
SRC would have beaten El Toro
17 to 28. The SRC team of White,
Broker, and Spurr took 8 points
to 15 for the Angell Field
Ancients (up to 61 years in age),
and 39 for the Dislocations.
