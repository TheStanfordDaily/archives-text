# Phi Delts Triumph A-Sigs Upset KA's
## 
### SCOTT BURNS 
As the IM football season heads down the stretch, the games get
tougher and more exciting as the good teams face off against each
other. This past week saw some real thrillers.
Monday, the Alpha Sigs pulled a big upset by beating the previously
unbeaten KA's, 31-0. A really tough rush put lots of pressure on KA
quarterback, Scott Stillinger, and the KA offense died. Tom Watson
guided the Alpha Sig offense, using delay pass patterns with great
success.
The Phi Delts proved on Saturday that they have got the class of
being the top IM team as they beat the Beta's in a real thriller, 26-12.
The Beta's, previously unbeaten, played well as they used Ted
Bleymaier, the starting quarterback on last year's frosh team, to guide
their offense. But they were no match for the Phi Delts who showed
all-around finesse.
The Dislocations finally faced a good team, the Medical School, and
won, 13-7. The Med School team looked sharp, and proved that the
highly touted Dislocation offense (which had scored 165 points in
three games) could be stopped.
They regained the ball with 1:30 left, and marched down to the
Sigma Chi 8 yard line, only to have a pass on the last play of the game
deflected in the end zone, and lose, 14-19.
In other games, Branner upset unbeaten Lagunita, 19-0, and Lassen
upset Burbank, 6-0. The Phuds all but cinched the title of their league
by beating Cro Mem, 19-7, and Toro barely cinched the Eating Club
league by taking El Cuadro on yardage after tying, 6-6.
The Computer Science team finished out the season with a 0-5
record as they lost their last game 38-6 to Libido. The season was not
all a loss for they did score 3 touchdowns in five games, even though
they gave up a total of 207 points.
A spokesman for the team was quoted as saying: "We didn't give
away one point—each team had to work 'guts out' to get everv single
point they got!"
Game Time Change Due to the change in time, all IM football
games now start at 4 :00 p.m. so they can be finished by dark.
