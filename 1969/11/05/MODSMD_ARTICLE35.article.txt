# All-American Nominees
## 
### 
The Stanford Athletic Publicity
department has made their move,
and nominated five football
players for All-American honors.
Named by the department in
their release as "Stanford
All-American Nominees," are
quarterback Jim Plunkett,
line-backer Don Parish, tight end
Bob Moore, strong side guard Bob
Reinhard, and center John Sande
The release does not rival that
of USC's, but does provide the
needed publicity players must
have to win writers' votes and
post-season honors. Last year, the
Trojans came out with a huge full
color booklet plugging O.J.
Simpson.
Although most felt the expense
and effort was unnecessary,
Simpson did walk off with
everything. At the same time,
Stanford released very little
information on their great receiver
Gene Washington, and he was
slighted in nearly every all-star
selection.
Currently Simpson is enjoying a
so-so first year as a pro running
back with Buffalo while
Washington is the only bright spot
for the San Francisco 49ers. Gene
led the entire NFL in pre season
games as the top receiver, and
currently ranks in the top ten.
Page one of the four page black
and white spread is devoted to
Stanford's all-time offensive
leader, the junior signal caller
from San Jose. "Jim Plunkett has
the size, (6-3, 204) poise, and
passing ability to be the greatest
quarterback that has ever played
in a Stanford uniform," says the
Pub Department.
And the statement is not just
propaganda. The quotes are long
and numerous from opposing
coaches and players:
UCLA's Tommy
Prothro—"Plunkett just may be

the best passer that's ever played
the game."
WSU's Jim Sweeny —"Plunkett
is the country's best passer."
USC's John McKay —"Plunkett
is the strongest college
quarterback I've ever seen. He's
not just a dropback passer. He can
do a lot of things well. He can
half-roll, scramble, run when he's
in trouble, and get rid of the ball
with guys hanging on him."
The list goes on. Yet it will be a
minor upset if Plunkett becomes a
first-string All American. There
are a number of talented

quarterbacks this year, many of
them seniors. Purdue's Mike
Phipps has the Midwestern voters
wrapped up, and SMU's Chuck
Nixson (nations leading passer)
controls the South.
Plunkett ranks fifth in the
nation (first in Pac-8) in total
offense, and also fifth in passing.
Don Parish has a better chance
at winning the honors this year.
He is a senior, and far and away
the best linebacker on the coast.
McKay calls him "one of the
greatest I've ever seen at his
position," and Sweeny makes it
even more definite. "Parish is the
best."
The question of tight end Bob
Moore is confusing. Often
All-American teams just pick
three wide receivers, and ignore
the tight end spot. But the big
junior from Klamath Falls,
Oregon, is no one to slight.
Once again, the opposition
recognizes excellence. "Bob
Moore must be the best tight end
in the country," remarked UCLA
Assistant Coach and scout Jerry
Long. Alter seeing More in action
the verbous McKay commented,
fetanlord uses its tight end more
than anybody else in the
country and with good reason."
Ileinhard and Sande labor
under the handicap of being
unknowns, like all interior
linemen. But again we must go to
McKay for some glowing prose.
"The thing that is overlooked
about Stanford's offense is that
someone is blocking for
Plunkett . . .we didn't get to him
very often. I wasn't exactly
sending girls after him, either."
Sande, a junior may gain
national honorable mention, and
Reinhard, a senior, may be able to
reach even higher heights.
