# Administration Reveals Average Salary Data
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
The University administration
responded yesterday to the debate
over secret salary data by releasing
average pay figures of its own.
In explaining the move, Provost
Richard Lyman declared last
night, "I would like a more
informed debate than the kind of
hit-or-miss discussion that is going
on right now."
The University's figures are
broken down by school, in
contrast to the individual
departments and professors listed
in the 31-page anonymously
published leaflet circulated on
campus 10 days ago. No
individual professors are named in
the University-released data.
Monday the Daily received a
letter from 32 professors and staff
members stating "I do not
consider publication of my salary
an invasion of privacy, and
include the following data for
your information." The letter
includes full salary information on
each of the signers. (The list is
reprinted below.)
Salaries Analyzed
Highest professional salaries go
to the Schools of Law, Medicine,
and Business, respectively.
The reason for these areas
ranking above other disciplines is
clear: a doctor or a lawyer who is
a professor cannot practice his
profession on the side.
On the other hand, a scientist
or engineer can consult while also
being a teacher, earning extra
income from their outside work.
Since 1963 64, salaries have
generally increased about
one-third for professors and
associate professors, while pay for
assistant professors has gone up
by 40 percent.
The Business School and the
School of Earth Sciences, for
professors and associate
professors, have gotten bigger
increases than other areas.
In general, professors make
about one-third more than
associate professors. The gap

between associate profs and
assistant profs is less, however.
One interesting item is the
assistant professors of medicine,
on the average, make more than
associate professors in Humanities
and Sciences.
Lyman Hits Theft
In a written statement
accompanying the University's
release, Lyman declared that the
theft of confidential files during
last spring's Encina Hall sit-in
"transgressed widely shared
ethical standards and betrayed a
profound lack of concern for the
sensibilities of others."
Referring to the mimeographed
document's sections in which five
department chairmen evaluated
their staff, Lyman stated,
"Judgements about individuals
must be made. Unless they are
made in confidence, they are
likely to be bad judgements and
to be harmful as well."
The Provost cited a further
justification for confidential
individual salary figures: "An
individual's salary is his own
business and his alone unless he
chooses, on his own initiative, to
disclose it to others."
Individuals Protected
In releasing the statistics,
Lyman explained, "While it is
clearly improper for the
University or anyone else to make
public individual salaries, it is
clearly proper and wise for the
University to make public
information about salaries in a
manner that protects individuals
and at the same time provides
enough information for informed
judgements about the inadequacy
and equity of the University's
policies on compensation."
The release then listed the
median and mean salaries for full,
associate, and assistant professors
and instructors in the current
academic year in the schools of
Business, Earth Sciences,
Education, Engineering,
Humanities, Social Sciences,
Physical Sciences, Law, and
Medicine.
Included in the data also were
comparisons of minimum,
maximum, median, and mean
salaries for each of the four
positions in the schools over the
last seven years. (The mean is the
arithmetic average. The median is
the middle salary, with half the
salaries higher and half lower.)
No Department Listings
Last night Lyman said he had
refrained from printing salary data
by department because "There are
so few people in some humanities
departments. There are something
like five assistant professors in one
department." Singling out such
departments, he felt, would be an
invasion of privacy.
What was needed, Lyman
claimed, was a "much better
over-all picture instead of looking
for the sensational." He stated,
"If we stuck to department by
department, the results would be
pretty spotty."
He admitted that "Perhaps we

shoult. released this
informal.on before," but he
pointed out that much of it in a
more generalized form was
published by the American
Association of University
Professors.
"It seemes like a logical thing
to do. We needed to clear the
atmosphere and provide
meaningful figures," Lyman
explained.
Legal Aid Promised
Sunday the Provost released a
statement promising that "The
University is prepared to provide
legal advice in aid of any faculty
or staff member and his counsel in
steps necessary to determine if his
privacy has been invaded."
A week ago President Kenneth
Pitzer had announced that the
University "is exploring every
appropriate avenue for legal
action to prevent publication of
the stolen documents."
One high-ranking faculty
member informed Daily editor
Mark Weinberger that a number of
professors were prepared to sue
any publication that revealed their
salaries. The professor, who
preferred to remain anonymous,
claimed that some in fact had
already consulted lawyers on the
matter of invasion of privacy.
Chaparral spokesman Michael
Sweeney said that the magazine
would not print any direct data
from the Encina documents in
tomorrow's edition. "The data is
widely available," he said. "What
is needed is analysis, and we see
no rush."
The group of 32 professors and
staff members who submitted the
letter to the Daily are members of
the New University Conference, a

loose coalition of radicals. Their
statement also declared, "We
strongly urge all Stanford faculty,
teaching assistants, research
assistants, staff, and
administrators who agree with this
statement to send a copy of it
together with information on
their own salary to the Daily."
