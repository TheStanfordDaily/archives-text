## Allies Salute Nixon 
### 
LONDON (AP)—Two of
America's European allies, Great
Britain and West Germany
Tuesday saluted President Nixon's
aims for peace in Vietnam but the
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
delegations at the Paris peace talks
charged Nixon with prolonging a
"war of aggression."

President Nguyen Van Thieu of
South Vietnam warmly supported
Nixon's speech.
"The people of Vietnam,"
Thieu said in a statement in
Saigon, "want nothing more than
to gradually take the
responsibility to preserve their
own independence and freedom
with the efficient assistance of the
allied countries, especially that of
the people of the United States."
Most European newspapers that
commented on Monday's
presidential address expressed
disappointment. Some predicted
the speech would add force to
Moratorium demonstrations in the
United States later this month.
Soviet news media dismissed the
speech as an attempt to lull the
American public.
The North Vietnamese
delegation in Paris, however,
denounced the speech as "a
defiance not only of the
Vietnamese people but of the
American people and all the
peace-loving people in the world."
A statement from the
delegation demanded that the
United States withdraw its troops
rapidly, totally and
unconditionally and contended
Nixon's address revealed the
"warlike and perfidious nature of
his administration."

SAN FRANCISCO
(AP)-Superior Court Judge
Gerald S. Chargin apologized
Tuesday for the "intemperance"
of his remarks against
Mexican-Americans in sentencing
a 17-year-old youth for incest
with a younger sister.
( hargin, a Santa Clara County
judge, expressed his apology in a
letter declining an invitation from
a San Francisco Board of
Supervisors committee.
The committee had asked that
the judge explain himself at a
public hearing after Supervisor
Robert Gonzales demanded that
the San Francisco board censure
Chargin.
Judge Chargin said the incident
was under investigation by the
Judicial Qualifications Committee
and that it would be inappropriate
to accept the committee's
invitation now.

Judicial Apology
SAN FRANCISCO
(AP)-Superior Court Judge
Gerald S. Chargin apologized
Tuesday for the "intemperance"
of his remarks against
Mexican-Americans in sentencing
a 17-year-old youth for incest
with a younger sister.
( hargin, a Santa Clara County
judge, expressed his apology in a
letter declining an invitation from
a San Francisco Board of
Supervisors committee.
The committee had asked that
the judge explain himself at a
public hearing after Supervisor
Robert Gonzales demanded that
the San Francisco board censure
Chargin.
Judge Chargin said the incident
was under investigation by the
Judicial Qualifications Committee
and that it would be inappropriate
to accept the committee's
invitation now.

LONDON (AP)—Two of
America's European allies, Great
Britain and West Germany
Tuesday saluted President Nixon's
aims for peace in Vietnam but the
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
delegations at the Paris peace talks
charged Nixon with prolonging a
"war of aggression."

President Nguyen Van Thieu of
South Vietnam warmly supported
Nixon's speech.
"The people of Vietnam,"
Thieu said in a statement in
Saigon, "want nothing more than
to gradually take the
responsibility to preserve their
own independence and freedom
with the efficient assistance of the
allied countries, especially that of
the people of the United States."
Most European newspapers that
commented on Monday's
presidential address expressed
disappointment. Some predicted
the speech would add force to
Moratorium demonstrations in the
United States later this month.
Soviet news media dismissed the
speech as an attempt to lull the
American public.
The North Vietnamese
delegation in Paris, however,
denounced the speech as "a
defiance not only of the
Vietnamese people but of the
American people and all the
peace-loving people in the world."
A statement from the
delegation demanded that the
United States withdraw its troops
