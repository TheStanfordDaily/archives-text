# Biased Mihaly
## Arab Propaganda 
### Joshua Ronen 
(This is the first of a series of
columns by Joshua Roncn, who is
a Ph.D. candidate in Business
Administration.)
Miss Mihaly's second article
entitled Look at the Facts-Jewish
Anti-Zionism (Stanford Daily,
October 28, 1969) is not only
outrageous in its unabashed claim
to objectivity ("Look at the
Facts"), but also (as in her first
article) in its consistent attempt
to select, quote out of context,
and distort facts and figures to
achieve a cheap propagandists
effect.
A first "gem" of Miss Mihaly's
cheap propagandism that almost
"explodes" in the eyes of the
enlightened reader with its
arrogance is the contention that
"the American public has been
nurtured to a pro-Israeli stance."
In other words, Miss Mihaly
would have us believe that NOT
the widely known and
undisputable facts of Arab
intransigence and destructive
designs have created the rich
reservoir of goodwill for Israel in
the hearts of millions of
Americans of every race, color
and creed, but rather an alleged
organized campaign aimed at
establishing a favorable image for
the Jewish State. But rather than
get into a discussion with the
biased Miss Mihaly at this point,
let us "give the floor" to the
official Arab spokesman to tell
the depressing story of blind
hatred and genocidai intentions:
"We want a decisive battle to
annihilate that germ, Israel."
(Speech by Nasser in Alexandria,
July 26, 1959). "We will launch a
full-scale war when the right
moment arrives." (Radio Cairo,
May 18, 1962). "We aim at the
destruction of the State of Israel."
(Speech in Cairo, November 18,
1965); "The Arab nation has
decided to embark on the part of
war . . . We will move on to the

containment of Israel, and after
that to . . . its eradication."
(Radio Cairo, April 10, 1968).
Not less revealing is what AL
FATAH's (major terrorist group)
leader has to say. For, although he
attempts to measure his words
aimed at Western audiences, he is
not too shy to reveal what his
murder organization really intends
to do (as he told Gavin Young of
the London Observer and as
quoted in the Washington Post,
November 7, 1968):
"We are not trying to destroy
the Israeli army, of course. But
Israel is not just an army. It is a
society that can only survive and
prosper on peace and security. We
aim to disrupt that society.
Insecurity will make a mess of
their agriculture and commerce. It
will halt immigration and
encourage emigration. We will
even disrupt their tourist
industry." There might have been,
perhaps, a little grain of
consistency in Miss Mihaly's
contention, had the Arabs
confined themselves only to the
generous outpouring of verbal
invective. But the last two decades
in the history of the Middle East
abound in instances attesting to
the contrary.
Gangs of terrorists trained and
supported by the official
authorities of the Arab countries
neighboring Israel have conducted
for more than twenty years a
senseless and ruthless war against
Israel's civilian population
â€”workers, farmers, school
children, old people. The list is
endless: the attacks against El A 1
passenger planes, the shelling of
kibbutzim and of Israeli towns
and settlements, the explosions
set off in market places and
foodstores, the bombing of holy
sites, the mining of school
grounds, sports stadiums and
roads, and many other acts of
terrorism.
