# Coed Living
## 'Brothers And Sisters With Sexual Overtones' 
### CRAIG WILSON 
"It's like a brother-sister
relationship with sexual
overtones. Everything is really
relaxed and casual. At first it was
sort of 'forced' relaxed. Now its
sort of like a family. We see the
boys as friends not dates. If
something happens, it just does."
Thats the conclusion of one
resident after living in a coed
dorm for more than a month.
Stanford is well into its third
full year of coed living, but even
with the experience of a full year
under its belt, the success of coed
living is something few are able to
measure.
Undertaken originally in Grove
house as part of the creativity
houses in the winter of 1967,
coed living since has spread to
Branner, parts of Stern and
Wilbur, Durand, Lagunita, Toyon,
Roble and now even Florence
Moore.
Coeducational housing has
become so popular that two
campus fraternities, Lambda Nu
and Beta Chi have added women
to their houses, and a third, Phi
Gamma Delta has seriously
considered the possibility.
Not Enough Worni'll
The coed living plan has
developed to the point that the
prospect of finding enough
women to make the living
experience a valuable one has
become a problem of its own.
Margaret Burk of the housing
office has observed that the desire
to move into coeducational
residences has been far greater in
men than women. Limited by the
ratio of men to women the
question is becoming more
serious.
If the success of the coed
experiment is unknown, the
popularity of it is not. One dolly
observed, "sometimes it seems
like an unsupervised summer
camp, but coed living is the only
way to go."
'Incest Tahoo'
One of the most significant
effects of coed living and one
which few had bargained for has
been the development of what
Psychology Professor Joseph Katz
calls the "incest taboo." It
became obvious soon after coed
livmg was undertaken that a sort
of platonic relationship was built
up among residents which broke
down the sexual roles students
traditionally exercised upon one
another.
History professor Mark
Mancall, the original faculty
resident of Grove, seemed to
point a finger toward it at the
beginning when he expressed hope
that the students create "a less
structured environment in which
tension is lessened, and which
seems more conducive to study."
Katz, in an article in a

September issue of Look
magazine, traced relationships to
an "incest taboo" saying that
"familiarity of a certain kind
particularly in groups, breeds
non-romantic friendship."
Students themselves have
voiced all sort of theories for this
brother-sister relationship. One
student told Look that "dating
leads to more intercourse than
this. There's more anticipation of
sex. It's more of a goal. Of course,
in a different way, there's more
'sex' living like this just because
girls are here. Sex is sort of in the
air."
Better, Not Sexier
"When you are with boys all
the time," one coed told Look,
"it gets to be really important
what kind of person you are. So
you try to be a better person.
Before, all you needed to be was a
sexier person. Its the order of
things that matters, I wouldn't
want to marry someone who
wasn't my friend first."
The general feeling seems to be
that living in an environment with
the opposite sex leads to a
breaking down of artificiality.
"It's hard to maintain pretense
for any duration of time,"
according to one coed. "Coed
dorms force people to be natural
in a coed situation."
No Courtship
A male in Serra stated that
coeducation has become taken for
granted. "The social situation
hasn't affected many people very
much. It's just more natural. The
students have found it rewarding
to be able to establish
relationships that are not bound
by courtship rules."
The development of this
natural relationship wasn't always
easy—at least in the beginning.
At Grove house women were
forced to wear skirts to meals, and
a swinging door spearated the
male living section from the
female section. After 11 p.m. the
door would swing in only one
direction barring entrance to the
women's section. It was installed
especially for the Grove
experiment.
Self-Conscious
Self-consciousness was said to
pervade Grove House. Residents
felt a strong sense of their ro'-
influencing the course
coeducational living at Stanford.
Phil Taubman, an original
Grove resident, said that "in the
beginning stages, coeducation was
very tentative. People were unsure
what to expect; would the boys
date the girls, or become their
non-romantic friends? What effect
would curlers at breakfast have?
"We were dealing with an

unknown and everyone was
watching to see if co-educational
living would work. It differed
from today's patterns only in its
newness and gradual
development."
One of the fears shared by
many observors initially was the
feeling that sexual promiscuity
would drastically increase and
that coeducational living was only
an excuse for sexual orgies.
Sex Activity Low
Dr. David Katz in a study
entitled "Growth and Constraint
in College Students," published
data which showed conclusively
last year that though sexual
attitudes liberalized considerably
in college, sexual activity was still
quite low. In a list of fourteen
interests and activities only
between seven and seventeen per
cent of male and female students
ranked sexual needs among the
three most important.
Scholarsh ip
One of the really difficult
problems that Stanford has been
forced to face up to in recent
years has been the fact that
though the University ranks
extraordinary high in academic
scholarship this does not
contribute to a cohesive sort of
community. A poll taken last year
by Professor C.R. Pace of UCLA

and The American Council of
Education (ACE), pointed this
out.
The emphasis according to the
study was on isolated and
competitive achievement, rather
than effective sharing of the
intellectual life among students
and faculty or even among
students themselves.
It was hoped by many that the
University's coeducational living
centers would reduce this
problem.
Last year Branner House in a
letter to the housing dean
reported that students the year
before had found coeducation an
unqualified success. The letter
pointed out that GPA's averaged
out to 2.86 whereas the average at
Wilbur and Roble, then both one
sex houses, were 2.76 and 2.83
respectively. This they attributed
to more comfortable and realistic
personal relationships in the
house.
Many Critics
In spite of all these
endorsements coed living has
many critics and it's not unusual
for residents of coed houses to
move out after experiencing the
living conditions.
Seventy-one people moved out
of coed houses at the end of fall
quarter last year.
Said one, "Its noise, it's lack of
privacy. It's a plethora of
meaningful relationships and a
scarcity of romance ."
Sell (onluinrd
One girl who lived in Soto
House for a quarter and then
moved said, "It was hard to meet
people outside they assumed you
had a self-contained world." Her
greatest objection was one held by
most students interviewed who
left coed dorms to move off
campus. "1 wanted a home rather
than a room—a place to have my
independence.'
Asserted one coed, "I don't
think they look at us as dates at
all. This ratio thing's been
drummed into them so much that
they just assume we're all booked
up."
One male who made the move
said that "some of the ridiculous
illusions about the opposite sex
are broken up. This is good and
bad. I'm tired of people saying
'I'm sick of the dating game.' I
think you need to play that game
for a while—you get to know a girl
slowly. I had experienced the
brother-sister relationship in high
school and in Magnolia (with
Olivo women), fall quarter. I was
ready for some social life."
Artificial
One student said "1 like the
informality of Roble, but people
formed groups very quickly and
then the informality stopped.
Relationships were artificial."
But Joseph Katz, says he feels
the important thing is that the
students were getting the choice
of residence situations.
He feels that one of the major
problems in institutions the size
of Stanford is the lack of
communication between the
university and the student and
among students themselves.
Personalized dorm units help to

create more channels tor
communication and interaction.
"For two reasons—because
women mature faster and because
boys grow up under a woman'd
dominance (their mothers)—many
men grow up afraid of women,"
Look quoted Katz as saying."So
the old fraternity system afforded
more of an opportunity to let out
feelings of strangeness and threat
through invective and teasing,
which is often quite sadistic, you
know.
"Rather thai colleges
encouraging this, it seems a good
time to correct it. In living with
girls, the boys find out that, just
because they are more than
submissive sex objects, they are
not going to destroy masculinity.
They learn that masculinity is
more than a superficial
toughness—an attitude that
all-male situations seem to
harbor."
But if many of the experts are
sure that coed living is beneficial,
many of the students aren't.
As one student put it,"I don't
know what it's like to have girls in
the same dorm. There's always a
crowd in front of them."
