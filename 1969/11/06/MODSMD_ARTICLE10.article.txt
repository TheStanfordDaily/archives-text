## The
						Gray Month 
### 
Disappointments are coming in rather
heavily these days. It looks like a pretty
gray winter coming on, and not just in
meteorological terms.
Secret peace plans remain secret.
America fights on to save the Asian people
from communist totalitarianism. Spiro T.
Agnew strains at his leash, spouting slogans
to rival those of the most militant
left-winger. The black race is symbolically
emasculated before the entire country as
Bobby Seale is dragged into court bound
and gagged. Seventy-seven per cent of the
American people support Nixon's non-plan
to end the war, while only six per cent
oppose it. But what is there to oppose?
Nixon is trying to bore the country into
submission. He appeals to the amorphous,
bored, resentful, and dutiful voter (the
middle American), the "great silent
majority." His aim is clearly to dull
America's senses, isolating the 'excitable'
minority on the campuses.
Appeasement is not the way to answer
the anger and frustration breeding at
Stanford and at other universities. The war
must end, as must this society's other

malignant diseases; no amount of secret
peace plans, appeals to national honor, and
Vietnamization can quiet the dissent of
Agnew's "parasites of passion."
The university has no choice but to draw
itself together as a stronghold for the gray
months that lay ahead. Antiwar activity
must continue to be carried to surrounding
communities; but peace marches and
doorbell ringing might ultimately be acts of
self-deception-the silent majority doesn't
like noise.
Likewise, the university deceives itself as
it continues to call for propriety and
decorum above all else. If the Nixons,
Agnews, and Mitchells of this country are
to be resisted, it is the academic
community that must serve as the unified
base for such a movement. The college
campuses, including Stanford, now provide
a vital link in the military-industrial-educa
tion combine that keeps the war machine
operative. Stanford, and other educational
institutions, should move now to break
that link, or be willing to suffer through he
inevitable dark winter of repression.
