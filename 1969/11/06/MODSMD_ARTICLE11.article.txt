# More of the Same
## Your Senate And Mine 
### F. H 
(F.H. is a "somewhat portly"
student senator from
Undergraduate Humanities and
Sciences, who refuses to be
categorized in any other way.)
"You know what I think?" said
one ASSU activist to another. "I
think that the new ASSU Senate
is simply the old, hundred
member, ASSU Legislature, with
the sixty sane people taken out.
The forty worst flamers in the old
Legislature are all in the new
Senate, in full force and best of
form."
The performance of the new
ASSU Senate on Monday night
was—we should all hope— not
characteristic of what will be the
spirit and action of the body this
year. The group considered three
items of business: the selection of
a screening committee for
applications for the ASSU
Committee on Nominations, the
appropriation of funds for an
independent attorney for the
Publications Board, and the
election of a Chairman. All three
of these matters (and particularly
the last) were discussed and
decided amid Machiavellian
engineering, parliamentary
wrangles, and shouting matches
reminiscent of the dear old
LASSU at its worst.
The following incidents
occurred, for example, in the
course of the election of the
Chairman:
Pink Card
Y. 8., prominent member of the
old LASSU, added his unique
contribution to the discussion of
candidates for Chairman. That
contribution came in the form of
a pink, 3x5 index card on which
were written the name of one
candidate, references to the armed
forces and counter-insurgency
research, and the innuendo
"C.1.A.??" This card was passed
among the Senate, was the object
of a physical struggle at one point,
and finally was read—with its
cryptic abbreviations—before the
whole body. Said Y.B. later in the
evening: "I assassinated his
character inadvertently." Garbage.
In the course of the election
speeches, Senate members were
treated to a reminder of their high
school "student government"
glories as several student politics
red-hots spoke glibly in their own
behalf. The image projected by
one or two of these was a
too-familiar Stanford type: the

clean-cut All-American, with
broad-shouldered good sense and
supreme desire to cut the bull:
"OK, so you ask me what I think
the Chairmanship should be. I'm
gonna tell you. I think it needs a
dynamic person who's willing to
work. And I'm willing to work."
Clear crisp sentences. Like the
fair-haired boy wowing the brass
at his first board meeting. Like
the youthful candidate, collar
open behind the tie, humming
"Hail to the Chief" as he ran for
the Central High School head yell
leadership.
Reverse Order
Several senators thought they
smelled something faintly foul in
theelection proceedings. Item: On
the motion of one of the more
radical senators, the speeches
made by candidates were given in
reverse alphabetical order. No real
reason was given for this
seemingly capricious arrangement;
it ignored the traditional LASSU
expedient of following the order
in which nominations are listed on
the chalkboard. The consequence
of this provision was that the two
candidates (last names beginning
with Band A) who decided to
"throw their support" to a third
candidate spoke in the two last
slots. Result: an apparent
"snowballing of support" for one
candidate. Perhaps the conclusion
to be drawn is that capricious
motions can result in the
appearance of impropriety.
The Senate does, however, have
reasons to be optimistic about its
future. Its elected Chairman
shows every promise of being
masterful and decisive in the most
confusing of situations. It is to the
Senate's great credit that David
Edwards, a black, was elected
Chairman for reasons other than
his blackness. (The legislature and
other student voters have too
often shown their willingness to
vote for blacks as an act of liberal
assertiveness at best, or
self-flagellation at worst.) It is, in
turn, to Edwards' great credit that
he chose an able and efficient
assistant for parliamentary and
bylaws matters in former ASSU
Presidential Assistant Bennett
Cullum.
Hope for Comm if tees
It is to be hoped that the
Senate can apply some of the
energy it has already shown in
floor debate to the work to be
done by its committees. The

intimacy and intensity of
committee work will, one expects,
show senators that their fellow
members are people and not
political abstractions. Committee
work can predictably make or
break the new body.
A final word, my fellow
students: Your Senate and
mine—(the ASSUS?)—will be
meeting this Thursday night in
Room 75 of the Business School.
Show up, if you can.
