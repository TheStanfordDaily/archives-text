# All Open Letter
## Dear Mr. President 
### 
Dear Mr. Nixon,
Your speech of November 3
will provide more impetus to the
Vietnam Moratorium than all the
offensive buffoonery of your
Vice-President has ever been able
to do. On October 15, Americans
of all political persuasions came
together in the largest anti-war
protest in the history of America.
They called for an immediate end
to our involvement in Vietnam
and a redirection of our moral and
economic energy. You, as you had
promised, were not affected by it.
You reiterated in your speech
the same kind of tired
justification for this war that
three Presidents before you have
used: that our immediate
withdrawal would "inspire
recklessness in the councils of
great powers who have not yet
abandoned their goal of world
power." We made our plea in
October; we will increase its
volume in November, and in
December, and every month
thereafter until you accept it as
the essence of wise policy. We
cannot police the world. We do
not have the right, and we do not

have the ability. Our pressing
domestic crises simply will not
allow it.
You offered a new justification
for continuation of this war: "As
we eventually saw the
consequences" of immediate
withdrawal, you said, "inevitable
remorse and divisive recrimination
would scar our spirit as a people."
Can't you see that this war has
caused more bitterness and
remorse and divisiveness than any
other American policy in history,
and that every day the war
continues these poisonous feelings
will continue to mushroom in our
society? How can it not be clear
that our own national spirit and
purpose will be far more deeply
scarred by prelonging this war
than by ending it immediately?
Right and Wrong
You claimed we have made
many specific proposals for a
bilateral peace which Hanoi has
repeatedly and emphatically
rejected. You insist that the
continuation of this war is a direct
result of their obstinacy and
refusal to negotiate responsibility;
that this makes them "wrong"
and us "right."
Nine thousand American boys
have died in Vietnam since you
came into office. None of our
major domestic problems have
gotten any better since January
because you don't have the funds
to attack them effectively. This
war is killing us.
So I'm not concerned with
whose wrong and whose right, I
am concerned with getting out. If
we can't disengage from Vietnam
through bilateral negotiations,
then we must do it
unilaterally—but we must do it
immediately. When American
boys are dying needlessly we do
not have the right to leave our
troops in Vietnam and blame the
continuation of the war on the
enemy.
'Honorable' What?
You claim that you want an
"honorable" peace for America,
that you will not preside over an
American defeat and humiliation.
Can't you see that there is honor
in a policy which has the courage
to admit the mistakes of the past
and to act immediately to reverse
them?
The swift and complete reversal
of our Vietnam policy would not
be a defeat for America, it would
be a redirection; one that would
inspire considerably more hope
than your present policies do.
On November 3 you said that
"North Vietnam cannot defeat
and humiliate the United States,
only Americans can do that." The
self-defeating and humiliating
nature of present American
policy—stubbornly refusing to
recognize and reverse our
mistakes—is evidence that your
above statement is true.
You said in your speech that
your present plan will "end the
war and serve the cause of peace."
When will it end the war? In ten
years? What peace will it serve?
Why are you unable to see that
the chances for peace within
America grow dimmer every day
this war goes on? If our domestic
crises do not receive effective
treatment in the next decade they
will explode in our face. And the
allies that we are supposedly
serving by fighting in Vietnam will
have neither the desire nor the
ability to pick up the pieces of
what was once America.
Massive Movement
May I suggest, sir, that you
have become so obsessed with the
international implications of this
war that you have been blinded as
to its effects on this country.
Americans, many ot whom
voted for you last November, are

only now beginning to speak out
against this war. The massive
public movement that was the
October Moratorium was only a
beginning.
This November we are going to
double our efforts. Twice as many
people will march for peace,
canvass for peace, leaflet for
peace, write for peace, pray for
peace. And if you choose again
not to heed our pleas, we will
escalate our efforts even further in
December.
Self-Betrayal
Millions of concerned
Americans demand a redirection
in our policies. They are not only
from the universities. They are
from that silent majority you so
often speak of. And they will be
silent no longer.
Eventually, if you are not to
betray your own words, you will
have to listen to our voices.
You said in your speech, "If a
vocal minority prevails over
reason and the will of the
majority, this nation has no future
as a free society."
The Majority
We of the Moratorium are
vocal, but as you will see, we are
not a minority. The majority of
Americans will embrace the spirit
of the Vietnam Moratoirum in the
coming months. To remain in
Vietnam will be to disregard the
will of the majority.
It will also be to disregard
reason, for reason clearly demands
that we stop this gross
misdirection of our resources and
channel them instead into the
crises that now threaten our
destruction.
So, beware, sir, of your own
rhetoric.
I hope you will find in this next
month the courage and the
decency to reverse your mistaken
policies.

whose wrong and whose right, I
am concerned with getting out. If
we can't disengage from Vietnam
through bilateral negotiations,
then we must do it
unilaterally—but we must do it
immediately. When American
boys are dying needlessly we do
not have the right to leave our
troops in Vietnam and blame the
continuation of the war on the
enemy.
'Honorable' What?
You claim that you want an
"honorable" peace for America,
that you will not preside over an
American defeat and humiliation.
Can't you see that there is honor
in a policy which has the courage
to admit the mistakes of the past
and to act immediately to reverse
them?
The swift and complete reversal
of our Vietnam policy would not
be a defeat for America, it would
be a redirection; one that would
inspire considerably more hope
than your present policies do.
On November 3 you said that
"North Vietnam cannot defeat
and humiliate the United States,
only Americans can do that." The
self-defeating and humiliating
nature of present American
policy—stubbornly refusing to
recognize and reverse our
mistakes—is evidence that your
above statement is true.
You said in your speech that
your present plan will "end the
war and serve the cause of peace."
When will it end the war? In ten
years? What peace will it serve?
Why are you unable to see that
the chances for peace within
America grow dimmer every day
this war goes on? If our domestic
crises do not receive effective
treatment in the next decade they
will explode in our face. And the
allies that we are supposedly
serving by fighting in Vietnam will
have neither the desire nor the
ability to pick up the pieces of
what was once America.
Massive Movement
May I suggest, sir, that you
have become so obsessed with the
international implications of this
war that you have been blinded as
to its effects on this country.
Americans, many ot whom
voted for you last November, are

only now beginning to speak out
against this war. The massive
public movement that was the
October Moratorium was only a
beginning.
This November we are going to
double our efforts. Twice as many
people will march for peace,
canvass for peace, leaflet for
peace, write for peace, pray for
peace. And if you choose again
not to heed our pleas, we will
escalate our efforts even further in
December.
Self-Betrayal
Millions of concerned
Americans demand a redirection
in our policies. They are not only
from the universities. They are
from that silent majority you so
often speak of. And they will be
silent no longer.
Eventually, if you are not to
betray your own words, you will
have to listen to our voices.
You said in your speech, "If a
vocal minority prevails over
reason and the will of the
majority, this nation has no future
as a free society."
The Majority
We of the Moratorium are
vocal, but as you will see, we are
not a minority. The majority of
Americans will embrace the spirit
of the Vietnam Moratoirum in the
coming months. To remain in
Vietnam will be to disregard the
will of the majority.
It will also be to disregard
reason, for reason clearly demands
that we stop this gross
misdirection of our resources and
channel them instead into the
crises that now threaten our
destruction.
So, beware, sir, of your own
rhetoric.
I hope you will find in this next
month the courage and the
decency to reverse your mistaken
policies.

Dear Mr. Nixon,
Your speech of November 3
will provide more impetus to the
Vietnam Moratorium than all the
offensive buffoonery of your
Vice-President has ever been able
to do. On October 15, Americans
of all political persuasions came
together in the largest anti-war
protest in the history of America.
They called for an immediate end
to our involvement in Vietnam
and a redirection of our moral and
economic energy. You, as you had
promised, were not affected by it.
You reiterated in your speech
the same kind of tired
justification for this war that
three Presidents before you have
used: that our immediate
withdrawal would "inspire
recklessness in the councils of
great powers who have not yet
abandoned their goal of world
power." We made our plea in
October; we will increase its
volume in November, and in
December, and every month
thereafter until you accept it as
the essence of wise policy. We
cannot police the world. We do
not have the right, and we do not

have the ability. Our pressing
domestic crises simply will not
allow it.
You offered a new justification
for continuation of this war: "As
we eventually saw the
consequences" of immediate
withdrawal, you said, "inevitable
remorse and divisive recrimination
would scar our spirit as a people."
Can't you see that this war has
caused more bitterness and
remorse and divisiveness than any
other American policy in history,
and that every day the war
continues these poisonous feelings
will continue to mushroom in our
society? How can it not be clear
that our own national spirit and
purpose will be far more deeply
scarred by prelonging this war
than by ending it immediately?
Right and Wrong
You claimed we have made
many specific proposals for a
bilateral peace which Hanoi has
repeatedly and emphatically
rejected. You insist that the
continuation of this war is a direct
result of their obstinacy and
refusal to negotiate responsibility;
that this makes them "wrong"
and us "right."
Nine thousand American boys
have died in Vietnam since you
came into office. None of our
major domestic problems have
gotten any better since January
because you don't have the funds
to attack them effectively. This
war is killing us.
So I'm not concerned with
whose wrong and whose right, I
am concerned with getting out. If
we can't disengage from Vietnam
through bilateral negotiations,
then we must do it
unilaterally—but we must do it
immediately. When American

peace. And if you choose again
not to heed our pleas, we will
escalate our efforts even further in
December.
Self-Betrayal
Millions of concerned
Americans demand a redirection
in our policies. They are not only
from the universities. They are
from that silent majority you so
often speak of. And they will be
silent no longer.
Eventually, if you are not to
betray your own words, you will
have to listen to our voices.
You said in your speech, "If a
vocal minority prevails over
reason and the will of the
majority, this nation has no future
as a free society."
The Majority
We of the Moratorium are
vocal, but as you will see, we are
not a minority. The majority of
Americans will embrace the spirit
of the Vietnam Moratoirum in the
coming months. To remain in
Vietnam will be to disregard the
will of the majority.
It will also be to disregard
reason, for reason clearly demands
that we stop this gross
misdirection of our resources and
channel them instead into the
crises that now threaten our
destruction.
So, beware, sir, of your own
rhetoric.
I hope you will find in this next
month the courage and the
decency to reverse your mistaken
policies.

Dear Mr. Nixon,
Your speech of November 3
will provide more impetus to the
Vietnam Moratorium than all the
offensive buffoonery of your
Vice-President has ever been able
to do. On October 15, Americans
of all political persuasions came
together in the largest anti-war
protest in the history of America.
They called for an immediate end
to our involvement in Vietnam
and a redirection of our moral and
economic energy. You, as you had
promised, were not affected by it.
You reiterated in your speech
the same kind of tired
justification for this war that
three Presidents before you have
used: that our immediate
withdrawal would "inspire
recklessness in the councils of
great powers who have not yet
abandoned their goal of world
power." We made our plea in
October; we will increase its
volume in November, and in
December, and every month
thereafter until you accept it as
the essence of wise policy. We
cannot police the world. We do
not have the right, and we do not

have the ability. Our pressing
domestic crises simply will not
allow it.
You offered a new justification
for continuation of this war: "As
we eventually saw the
consequences" of immediate
withdrawal, you said, "inevitable
remorse and divisive recrimination
would scar our spirit as a people."
Can't you see that this war has
caused more bitterness and
remorse and divisiveness than any
other American policy in history,
and that every day the war
continues these poisonous feelings
will continue to mushroom in our
society? How can it not be clear
that our own national spirit and
purpose will be far more deeply
scarred by prelonging this war
than by ending it immediately?
Right and Wrong
You claimed we have made
many specific proposals for a
bilateral peace which Hanoi has
repeatedly and emphatically
rejected. You insist that the
continuation of this war is a direct
result of their obstinacy and
refusal to negotiate responsibility;
that this makes them "wrong"
and us "right."
Nine thousand American boys
have died in Vietnam since you
came into office. None of our
major domestic problems have
gotten any better since January
because you don't have the funds
to attack them effectively. This
war is killing us.
So I'm not concerned with
whose wrong and whose right, I
am concerned with getting out. If
we can't disengage from Vietnam
through bilateral negotiations,
then we must do it
unilaterally—but we must do it
immediately. When American
boys are dying needlessly we do
not have the right to leave our
troops in Vietnam and blame the
continuation of the war on the
enemy.
'Honorable' What?
You claim that you want an
"honorable" peace for America,
that you will not preside over an
American defeat and humiliation.
Can't you see that there is honor
in a policy which has the courage
to admit the mistakes of the past
and to act immediately to reverse
them?
The swift and complete reversal
of our Vietnam policy would not
be a defeat for America, it would
be a redirection; one that would
inspire considerably more hope
than your present policies do.
On November 3 you said that
"North Vietnam cannot defeat
and humiliate the United States,
only Americans can do that." The
self-defeating and humiliating
nature of present American
policy—stubbornly refusing to
recognize and reverse our
mistakes—is evidence that your
above statement is true.
You said in your speech that
your present plan will "end the
war and serve the cause of peace."
When will it end the war? In ten
years? What peace will it serve?
Why are you unable to see that
the chances for peace within
America grow dimmer every day
this war goes on? If our domestic
crises do not receive effective
treatment in the next decade they
will explode in our face. And the
allies that we are supposedly
serving by fighting in Vietnam will
have neither the desire nor the
ability to pick up the pieces of
what was once America.
Massive Movement
May I suggest, sir, that you
have become so obsessed with the
international implications of this
war that you have been blinded as
to its effects on this country.
Americans, many ot whom
voted for you last November, are

only now beginning to speak out
against this war. The massive
public movement that was the
October Moratorium was only a
beginning.
This November we are going to
double our efforts. Twice as many
people will march for peace,
canvass for peace, leaflet for
peace, write for peace, pray for
peace. And if you choose again
not to heed our pleas, we will
escalate our efforts even further in
December.
Self-Betrayal
