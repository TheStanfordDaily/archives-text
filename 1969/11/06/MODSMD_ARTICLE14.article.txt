### Charles F. Bennet 
(Castâ€”Julius "Caesar"
Hoffman, Magistrate William
Kunstler, Defender of the Meek
Robert Seale, Sensitive Young
Black.)
Hoffman: Very well, call your
next witness.
Kunstler: Your Honor, for its
final witness the defense calls the
defendant, Bobby Seale.
Hoffman: You can't do that.
Kunstler: Why not, your
Honor?
Hoffman: Because I've bound
and gagged him.
Kunstler: It is our legal right,
your Honor.
Hoffman: THAT has nothing to
do with it . . . oh, well, all right.
Let him go.
Bailiff: Do you swear
tote 11 the whole truth nothingbut
thetruetcetcamen?
Seale: Right.
Baliff: Takastand.
Kunstler: Now, Bobby,
Seale: Mr. Seale, dammit.
Kunstler: Now, Mr. Seale, have
you ever, at any time, considered
the possibility of participating in
or organizing a riot?
Seale: Are you talking to me?
Hoffman: Answer the question,
Seale.
Seale: Goddamn it, I don't
need your help.
Hoffman: Don't you swear at
me, you colored man, you.
Seale: Racist! Fascist Pig!
Kunstler: Mr. Seale, if we could
continue with the

testimony . . . have you ever
considered any such thing?
Seale: Hey, man, I grew up in a
convent.
K unstler: Sure you did.
Hoffman: Is counsel attempting
to impeach his own witness?
Kunstler: Would the Court like
to do it for me?
Hoffman: Go ahead, you're
doing fine.
Kunstler: Mr. Seale, you know
what the charges are against you.
Are you guilty or innocent of
those charges?
Scalr: Innocent as the day I
was born.
Hoffman: EXACTLY!
Seale: Goddamn racist pig!
FASCIST! FASCIST!
Hoffman: Bolt that man to the
floor and pour molten lead in his
mouth!
Kunstler: That could do him
bodily harm, your Honor, and
would interfere with the
completion of his testimony.
Hoffman: Testimony be
damned! I want that man bolted
down where I can stomp on him!
Seale: (Being led away)
HONK V! I WANT MY
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO
A FAIR TRIAL! FASCIST!
The moral to this story is, if
you want something done wrong,
you'll rarely to able to do it all by
yourself.
(Charles F. Bennett is trying to
incite riot through a display of
profound contempt for the
human race.)
