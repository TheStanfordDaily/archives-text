# Job Challenge For New Dean
## 
### 
All too often, university
administration becomes a haven
for educators no longer able to
educateâ€”where expediency
replaces effectiveness.
Peter Z. Bulkeley, new Dean of
Students, is striving to avoid this
stereotype.
Bulkeley views his job as "a
challenging new arena of people,
rather than things, to work with;
of subjective uncertainty, rather
than definite answers to
questions."
He deals with the institution's
interaction with disaffected
people, with whom he "shares
many of these disaftections.
Bulkeley was named Dean of
Students June 3, succeeding Joel
Smith, who became the president
of Denison University.
The 35 year old professor of
Engineering Mechanics received
his doctorate from Stanford in
1962.
Bulkeley commented that an
ideal university, an open
community of scholars, must have
a sense of responsibility for the
actions of its members. But, he
said, it is not correct that one
agency, such as the Dean's office,
should have responsibility both
for maintaining the quality of
student life and atmosphere for
learning, as well as having an
active role in discipline.
Drug Abuse
Bulkeley stressed that the
University is not a sanctuary for
drug use, for instance, and that
community peace officers could
not and should not be excluded
from the campus. He said that his
office is generally informed of
raids as they are occuring and that
he wants to know when such
actions are taken.
Of the war in Vietnam,
Bulkeley stated that the United
States "should admit its mistake
and not exacerbate it."

Bulkeley said, in reference to
last spring's disturbances, that
"there is no need for that type of
thing to happen again. There is an

increasing understanding of social
responsibilities of an institution of
this kind. There is an increasing
awareness of student attitudes on
social issues. Administrators are
more receptive, and there is more
student participation in
governance, as illustrated by the
fact that almost all major
decisions of the past few months
have been made with student
consultation."
He enjoys this job because of
the many problems to be found,
well defined, and then solved.
Although the job is often
exhausting, Bulkeley finds the
stimulation is worth the time
involved.


PETEK BULKELEY: "The central
business of a university should be
education, not discipline."
