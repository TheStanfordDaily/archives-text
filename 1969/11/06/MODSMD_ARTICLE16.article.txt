confined existence at Palo Alto
High School.

Rafferty. SDS has been banned
from California high schools by
another Rafferty ruling.
The Palo Alto Unified School
District has established additional
restrictions. They have banned the
Radical Students Union (RSU)
along with other organizations
which "present consistently only
one point of view." Political
rallies, assemblies and other
programs can be held only if a
balanced spectrum of viewpoints
is presented. Leafleting is strictly
prohibited.
Surprise
Considering such unfriendliness
to political activity, it is perhaps
surprising that the school's
participants in the October 15
Vietnam Moratorium will go
virtually unpunished. Equally
surprising is how little controversy
this leniency has generated.
Officially the school regards
October 15 no differently than
any other day. Absent students
must bring written parental
excuses to avoid being considered
truant. Non-medical excuses must
be submitted before the date of
absence.
About 200 of the school's 1500
students obtained such excuses
for the Moratorium. Another 200
left school without excuses,
according to attendance statistics

supplied by student body
president Joe Simitian.
Whether or not the treatment
given Moratorium participants is
special, it is certainly lenient.
Apparently no one has been or
will be suspended, nor has anyone
been given "detention," a
common punishment before this
year. The most severe action
probably will be phone calls to
parents.
Satisfaction
Despite strong emotions for
and against the Moratorium,
Millar's policies have come close
to satisfying everybody.
Interviews with students, teachers
and school board members reveal
acceptance of the policies by
people of all opinions.
Student Moratorium supporters
generally feel the school's policies
went far towards enabling
students to participate. RSU
member Howard Besser said that
the administration found out lots
of students would be leaving and
they "wanted to pacify us." More
typical is Gary Fazzio, who felt
simply that the administration
treated everyone fairly.
Conservative faculty members
generally agree that Millar had no
choice but to allow students with
notes from their parents to leave
school on the 15th.
Were Moratorium participants
sincere?
Most were genuinely concerned
about the war, says student body
president Simitian, but some went
"just for kicks."
"Few took off for the beach,"
he added. "It was raining."

The Palo Alto Unified School
District has established additional
restrictions. They have banned the
Radical Students Union (RSU)
along with other organizations
which "present consistently only
one point of view." Political
rallies, assemblies and other
programs can be held only if a
balanced spectrum of viewpoints
is presented. Leafleting is strictly
prohibited.
Surprise
Considering such unfriendliness
to political activity, it is perhaps
surprising that the school's
participants in the October 15
Vietnam Moratorium will go
virtually unpunished. Equally
surprising is how little controversy
this leniency has generated.
Officially the school regards
October 15 no differently than
any other day. Absent students
must bring written parental
excuses to avoid being considered
truant. Non-medical excuses must
be submitted before the date of
absence.
About 200 of the school's 1500
students obtained such excuses
for the Moratorium. Another 200
left school without excuses,
according to attendance statistics

supplied by student body
president Joe Simitian.
Whether or not the treatment
given Moratorium participants is
special, it is certainly lenient.
Apparently no one has been or
will be suspended, nor has anyone
been given "detention," a
common punishment before this
year. The most severe action
probably will be phone calls to
parents.
Satisfaction
Despite strong emotions for
and against the Moratorium,
Millar's policies have come close
to satisfying everybody.
Interviews with students, teachers
and school board members reveal
acceptance of the policies by
people of all opinions.
Student Moratorium supporters
generally feel the school's policies
went far towards enabling
students to participate. RSU
member Howard Besser said that
the administration found out lots
of students would be leaving and
they "wanted to pacify us." More
typical is Gary Fazzio, who felt
simply that the administration
treated everyone fairly.
Conservative faculty members
generally agree that Millar had no
choice but to allow students with
notes from their parents to leave
school on the 15th.
