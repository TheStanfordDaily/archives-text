# Construction Crew At Work
## Men, Machines Bring Change 
### LAURIE PRICE 
Have you noticed the corps of
trained yellow monsters at work
at Stanford?
Perhaps you've heard their low
grumbles as they are prodded into
action. The creatures are hard at
work in the construction site
across from the woman's gym.
The deep pit they had eaten in the
earth leered at my feet; but, their
trainers seemed to be completely
in control.
To the left was a lethargic,
long-necked beast; I shuddered as
a man rode bravely across the pit,
clinging to a rope from its nose. A
grinding noise came from a huge
primeval crab, morosely chewing a
lump of dirt with its jagged
mouth.
Walking through the
silver-ceilinged darkness of the
basement in the newly
constructed Earth Sciences
Building, I considered the future
walkers of those hallways, who
would never know the nakedness
of this building without its skin:
the dangling arterial wires; the

massive hearing organs; the
thrusting emptiness of the shaft
without its elevator.
Workers' Viewpoint
It's lunch hour for the
construction workers. They look
young and not-so-young, healthy
and oddly at ease. Some sit on the

edge of the second floor, trying to
eat and harass passing Stanford
women at the same time. A
second group sits on the corner,
watching students go by, but for
the most part, reserving comment.
Working on the Stanford
campus is to many of those men
not different from working
anywhere else, but some are quite
curious about students and their
lives here.
The workers were exhilarated
by the idea of coed living. "How
the hell do they study?" asked
one fellow, half perplexed, half
envious. Another commented, "If
my son was in one of them sit-ins,
I'd smash his head in so fast, he'd
change his mind real quick!"
Statements of this type were
exactly what most students
expect to hear from construction
workers.
Sunny on the Root'
Up on the roof it was sunny
and congenial. Roofing is one of
the harder and hotter jobs; the
men were all very young. The
seven, three with tatoos, two with

headbands, and two with both,
walked around on the steep,
slooping sides without ropes.
They were wiring Stanford's
famous red tiles on one by one, in
intricate copper continuity.
The construction workers often
mentioned the chance to be
outside and active as a reason for
choosing the job, but more than
one of them indicated sadly that
builders are virtually isolated from
human exchanges during their
labors.
"What? The kids here? No,
they all think I'm too lame, too
out ol it, to talk to." This remark
came from an Army veteran
avowed Zen Buddhist who said he
had converted while in Korea, and
had since read quite a bit about
the philosophy of the religion.
In most cases previous contact
with the Stanford community had
been nonexistent, or at best
limited to answering queries as to
spare bricks and empty wire
spools. It is understandable that
they have no concept of this
campus as a place of life and feel
not a part of it in any way. Even
campus work-shirts, so popular
with Stanford students, have yet
to be sentenced to hard labor.
Many of the workers are
students, too, in their own way.
They must complete four-year,
on-the-job apprenticeships to
master the intricacies of building.
No units of B.S. credit, of course,
and no draft deferments.
Although not bitter, the men at
work were quite aware of the
differences between themselves
and the "intellectual" inhabitants
of this campus. Some separations
are the result of the institutions of
our society, such as the draft;
some are the effect of personal
attitudes, such as my own when I
approached these people to talk,
that is, with fear and a minimum
of confidence in what I could
learn from them.
Those flyers on he roof like to
take off in San Jose; they urged
me to come along next time.
Maybe I will.
