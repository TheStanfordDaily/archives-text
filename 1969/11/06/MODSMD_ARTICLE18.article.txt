## A
						Coach In Trouble 
### Fred Mann 
Everyone knew that this football season at the
University of Washington was going to be
different. They just weren't sure how different.
Coach Jim Owens entered this season as a
changed man. He was ready to answer BSU
demands and listen to his athletes. He was out to
rebuild the winning tradition that Seattle had
known for so many years.
Last week, all of his black players refused to go
to Los Angeles to play UCLA (they lost, 57-14),
his daughter was driven off the road one night and
hit in the face by an angry black, and his
rebuilding program for the year recorded its
seventh straight loss—the worst UW record in 10
years.
What went wrong?
Jim Owens studies his football under Paul Bear
Bryant, and gained a reputation as a tough
disciplinarian. He demanded supreme sacrifice
from his players. The dedicated stayed—those late
to practice went.
Washington football players wore uniform street
dress and crew cuts. There was always silence and
thought in the dressing room.
And the practice paid off. Washington won
games. In college football where the emphasis is on
winning, Owens became the king of West Coast
action. The Huskies went to he Rose Bowl in
1959, 1960, and 1964.
Owens also took on the job of Athletic
Director, a time-consuming chore that divided his
hours and alligence.
As times changed, the Washington football
program did not. In '64 and '65, athletes began to
show discontent with the Owens system. Blacks
were unhappy, and charges of "racist" began to fly
all over the place.
In 1967, the problem reached a peak. The BSU
called the Athletic Department racist and held the
Athletic Director responsible. Owens' own football

trainer was accused of making bigoted remarks.
Owens was told he had unreasonable regulations
and did not communicate.
The big, tough 42-year-old coach responded.
The trainer was fired, a black assistant coach was
hired, and the rules were softened. The result was
the demise of UW football. Last year, the
once-proud Huskies and Owens finished 3-5-2, and
still unhappy. So Owens needed to move again,
and he did. He quit as Athletic Director, and
worked hard with football. But luck was not with
him.
His top runner and receiver, Harvey Blanks
injured an ankle in the spring, and never recovered.
The loss of the black halfback was severe. Also,
the Huskies had to face the schedule that Owens,
as Athletic Director, had set up for them. Michigan
State, Michigan, and Ohio State all mauled
Washington, and made them 0-3 going into league
play. The walking wounded never recovered.
The record continued to slip—to 0-6—and
changes were bound to be made. Last week,
Owens suspended four blacks for "failure to
pledge 100 per cent support to the UW football
program."
When time came to board the plane for LA,
eight other black players refused to go. The black
community joined the fight, and Owens found this
year's problems bigger than ever. The Black
Athletes Alumni Club demanded Owens resign or
be fired. The black assistant hired in the crisis two
years ago joined in demanding reinstatement for
the four suspended players. Jim Owens has had
unhappy teams before, but never an unhappy
losing team. Only winning saves a coach's job.
Stanford plays the Huskies in Seattle, Saturday,
and the game is on TV (channel 7). The
odds-makers took the game off the board.
Unfortunately for Owens, a 0-8 team has even
more troubles than a 0-7 one.
