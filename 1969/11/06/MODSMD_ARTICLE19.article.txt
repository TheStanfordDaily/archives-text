# Ski Organization Starts
## 
### 
Stanford students will be able
to obtain sizable discounts on ski
lift tickets, lessons, and rentals
through a new campus ski group,
the Stanford Ski Association.
Members, when they ski at such
prominent areas as Alpine
Meadows and Bear Valley, will
receive a $1 discount on their lift
tickets on weekends and during

holiday weeks. At all other times
lift tickets, lessons, and rentals are
discounted 50%.
Ski Association members will
receive these discounts whether
they ski by themselves or with a
group.
The discounts are made
available by the Stanford's group
affiliation with the Student Ski

Association of Berkeley. Among
the other schools with students
affiliated with the Berkeley
organization are UCLA, Harvard,
Vassar, and, naturally, Cal.
Although a primary purpose of
the club is the acquisition of
discounts for its members at ski
areas, Pam Devel, spokesman for
the new club, announces that
other activities are planned as
well.
"Negotiations are under way to
get a chalet near Alpine
Meadows," Miss Deuel reports. "If
they are successful, we will be
running a bus up to the chalet
every weekend.
In this way students will have
an inexpensive place to stay, as
well as the chance to meet
students from the other campuses
with whom we'll share the
chalet."
Membership in the new group
costs $3. Interested students
should stop by the Stanford Ski
Association's desk in the AUSC
on Mondays and Fridays between
1 and 3 p.m., or write to the
Stanford Ski Association, Box
2352, Stanford.
