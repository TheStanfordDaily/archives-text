(From Associated Press)
Bobby G. Seale, national
chairman of the Black Panther
Party, was sentenced Wednesday
in a U.S. District Court to four
years in prison on contempt of
court charges by Judge Julius J.
Hoffman.
Hoffman sentenced Seale to a
three-month term for each of 16
different incidents which had
occured during the conspiracy
trial of Seale and seven others.
At the same time, a mistrial was
declared in Seale's case, and he
was separated from the other

seven defendants. April 23 was set
as the date of his new trial.
The courtroom dispute which
has raged since Seale was bound
and gagged in court last October
29, reached the breaking point
early Wednesday when defense
attorneys Kunstler and Weinglass
refused to cross-examine a witness
against Seale.
Seale went to the lectern and
began to cross-examine the
witness. At this point, Hoffman
excused the jury and recessed the

court half an hour early. He then
spent 90 minutes preparing his
citation.
Seale is being held in Cook
County jail in Chicago on a
fugitive warrant from New Haven,
Conn., where he is charged with
the murder of another member of
the Black Panther Party.
Hoffman ordered Seale gagged
and chained after Seale repeatedly
shouted epithets at the judge,
demanding to be allowed to serve
as his own counsel.
