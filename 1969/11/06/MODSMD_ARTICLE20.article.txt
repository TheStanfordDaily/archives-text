# Scandia Seminar
## 
### 
Scandinavian Seminar is now
accepting applications for its
study abroad program in
Denmark, Finland, Norway, or
Sweden for the academic year
1970-71. This living-and-learning
experience is particularly designed
for college students, graduates and
other adults who want to become
part of another culture while
acquiring a second language.
The program is geared to meet
each student's individual needs.
During the year he is separated
from the other Seminar
participants except during the
intensive language courses and the
three general sessions conducted
under the supervision of the

Seminar's American Director, Dr.
Adolph G. Anderson.
A family stay early in he year
gives the student the opportunity
to begin practicing the use of the
language on a daily basis, and to
share in the activities of the
community. For the major part of
the year he lives and studies
among Scandinavians at a
residential school for continuing
adult education or other
specialized institution.
The focus of the Seminar
program is the student's
Independent Study Project in his
special field of interest. Many
American colleges and universities
give* full or partial credit for the
Seminar year.
