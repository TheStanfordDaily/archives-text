# Pratt's Easy Ride
## 
### 
With most of the Western
Hemisphere's dust collected on his
motorcycle, Paul Pratt, British
electronics engineer and world
traveller, has roared into the Bay
Area.
Pratt, 39, has logged over
35,000 miles on his various
journeys. He comes to Northern
California after a trip which took
him throughout almost all of
Latin America and a great deal of
the United States. He says now,
though, that he wants "to settle
down" which means he is going to
stay put in this area for four
months. Then he is off to Japan.
His last trip started'from New
Orleans and went through
extensive areas of Mexico, Central
America, Columbia, Ecuador,
Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Brazil.
Pratt earns his way by giving
lectures on his demonstrations in
both Spanish and English. He also
writes for various British and
American cycle and travel
magazines.
Few difficulties have bes>
Roads have been difficult in some
countries, and his travel in Bolivia
was restricted because of guerrila
activity. He has also had his cycle
impounded for four days in
Columbia. The people of the

countries were generally
friendlyâ€”"it depended on the area
where there had been any
communist propaganda". Most
people recognized his motorcycle
as a "form of adventure".
"I made the trip because I'm an
avid motorcyclist, I love to travel
and also to promote products.
Pratt has already made several
previous trips including one from
1961-63 which carried him
through 34 states. However in all
his travels he has yet to be
wrecked.
"With a good motorcycle, an
experienced rider and a bit of
luck" there were no real troubles
at all.
Wearied a bit by his travels, and
because he really likes San
Francisco, Pratt is "visiting a bit
longer than usual". He is looking
for groups interested in his
experiences and has several
programs, using slides, that he
presents. He also would enjoy part
time electronics work. Pratt is still
looking for a place to stay in this
area. He would appreciate a call to
593-4844 by those with interest
in his lectures.
