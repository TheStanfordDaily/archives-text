The Daily was mistaken when it
reported in yesterday's edition
that all university personnel who
voluntarily made their salaries
public are members of the New
Ihiversity Conference (NUC).
The fact is that the salary release
move was sponsored by NUC, but
many who participated have no
connection to the group.

The Stanford Daily received the
following letter from the campus
in Austria;
Students and faculty of
Stanford University in Austria will
present a petition during an
audience with Pope Paul
questioning his failure to

excommunicate all Roman
Catholics who continue to
participate in or support the war
in Vietnam.
The petition, to be presented at
the Vatican on the morning of
Wednesday, November fifth, also
praises the Pope for his repeated
efforts for peace and for his
decree defining the immorality of
wars such as the one now being
waged in Southeast Asia.
