# Stanford YAF Chapter Mar Cut National Ties
## 
### PAUL PAPANEK 
Repercussions from this
morning's press conference called
by Stanford Young Americans for
Freedom (YAF) are expected to
have an important effect on the
severely factionalized national
organization.
The Stanford chapter of YAF is
under the leadership of Harvey
Hukari, a graduate student in
communications and the editor of
The Arena who has recently
declared himself a "liberatarian."
The chapter is still associated with
the national organization, but
there is widespread doubt that
this affiliation will continue after
today.
Hukari has called the press
conference today, and there is
speculation that he will announce
the secession of the Stanford
chapter of YAF from the national
organization. The immediate
reasons go back to this summer.
In the middle of August, the
California state board of YAF
fired its executive director on
charges of financial incompetence.
However, since he differed rather
sharply with the board on basic
issues, it has been suggested that
mismanagement of funds was not
the real reason.
The fired executive director
then appealed to the YAF
national office for reinstatement;
after the smoke cleared, the entire
California organization found
itself dissolved.
Crisis Here
YAF's internal crisis has come
to a head. The national board is
due to appoint a new state
chairman in California; and the
candidate most likely to be named
is unacceptable to Hukari and his
associates.
"If the national appoints who
we think they will, Stanford will
pull OUt of YAF," Hukari has
declared.
Because of Hukari's influence
and prestige in the California

organization, quite a few chapters
may follow his example.
In general, the traditionalist
faction in YAF hold strongly for
maintenance of the status quo,
and sacredness of historical
continuity and tradition, and very
gradual change.
Libertarians, a vocal minority
in YAF, oppose the draft, support
non-interventionist government
policies, and advocate
liberalization of existing drug
laws.
Some Libertarians Skeptical
Some extreme libertarians are
members of SDS and declare
themselves openly to be
anarchistic. Most of these have
been purged from YAF.

These self-proclaimed
libertarians find it hard to classify
Hukari as a libertarian, in spite of
what he now says. He believes in
cooperating with the police to end
unruly demonstrations; and it has
been said that the "litmus test" to
determine whether a YAFer is
truly a libertarian is: Does he call
in the police in a political crisis.
"It's not a problem of lowa
conservatives discriminating
against Louisiana libertarians,"
Hukari maintains. "It's a situation
in which a few powerful people in
Washington, D.C., hold the
purse-strings in a centralized
national office."

YAF's internal crisis has come
to a head. The national board is
due to appoint a new state
chairman in California; and the
candidate most likely to be named
is unacceptable to Hukari and his
associates.
"If the national appoints who
we think they will, Stanford will
pull OUt of YAF," Hukari has
declared.
Because of Hukari's influence
and prestige in the California

organization, quite a few chapters
may follow his example.
In general, the traditionalist
faction in YAF hold strongly for
maintenance of the status quo,
and sacredness of historical
continuity and tradition, and very
gradual change.
Libertarians, a vocal minority
in YAF, oppose the draft, support
non-interventionist government
policies, and advocate
liberalization of existing drug
laws.
Some Libertarians Skeptical
Some extreme libertarians are
members of SDS and declare
themselves openly to be
anarchistic. Most of these have
been purged from YAF.

These self-proclaimed
libertarians find it hard to classify
Hukari as a libertarian, in spite of
what he now says. He believes in
cooperating with the police to end
unruly demonstrations; and it has
been said that the "litmus test" to
determine whether a YAFer is
truly a libertarian is: Does he call
in the police in a political crisis.
"It's not a problem of lowa
conservatives discriminating
against Louisiana libertarians,"
Hukari maintains. "It's a situation
in which a few powerful people in
Washington, D.C., hold the
purse-strings in a centralized
national office."
Repercussions from this
morning's press conference called
by Stanford Young Americans for
Freedom (YAF) are expected to
have an important effect on the
severely factionalized national
organization.
The Stanford chapter of YAF is
under the leadership of Harvey
Hukari, a graduate student in
communications and the editor of
The Arena who has recently
declared himself a "liberatarian."
The chapter is still associated with
the national organization, but
there is widespread doubt that
this affiliation will continue after
today.
Hukari has called the press
conference today, and there is
speculation that he will announce
the secession of the Stanford
chapter of YAF from the national
organization. The immediate
reasons go back to this summer.
In the middle of August, the
California state board of YAF
fired its executive director on
charges of financial incompetence.
However, since he differed rather
sharply with the board on basic
issues, it has been suggested that
mismanagement of funds was not
the real reason.
The fired executive director
then appealed to the YAF
national office for reinstatement;
after the smoke cleared, the entire
California organization found
itself dissolved.
