## Kirk Calls Ideology 'Invented Religion' 
### BOB MICHELET 
Criticizing ideology as "invented religion," Dr. Russell Kirk spoke
to about 200 persons in Cubberly Auditorium Wednesday as part of
the Political Union's symposium "America on the Threshold of the
Seventies."
Speaking on "Fanatical Ideologies in Our Midst," the noted
conservative said ideology "promises salvation here and now through
political, and probably violent, means."
Kirk defined ideology as "political dogmatism." He added it is a
series of abstract theories, an inversion of religious beliefs, that
promises perfection by establishment of a new moral order.
Religion Declining
"Mankind always has to believe in something," Kirk said in
outlining the causes of ideology. "He needs a body of moral
principles. Usually, this has taken the form of religion, but more and
more, he asserted, people are giving up a religious nature of
understanding and are seeking political or ideological answers.
Kirk said that since 1789, the U.S. and other nations have been "in
the grip of an armed doctrine ideology."
The famed educator and columnist said a rise of ideological
passions in America has corresponded to a decay in the religious
nature of the people.

Another cause is "the phenomena of the uprooted." As masses of
people move to the city, they become discontented and are persuaded
by coherent movements that offer them a position and a job to do.
He said this is a more important factor than poverty. "Poverty, as

such, does not support ideology. It is being uprooted that gives rise to
ideology."
Kirk also cited "mal-education," especially among young people,
about government as a base for ideology.
Escapes Outlined
Kirk outlined two "escapes from ideology." One is to experience
the fruits of it and recover and the other is to "escape from the clutch
of ideology."
Yugoslavia is one country that is emerging from the clutch, he
asserted. There, "Communist ideology is already dead." Remarking
that the nation was no longer a police state, he said Tito (the
country's ruler) "is a shield from Soviet Communism."
He cited examples of a drift from hard-line Communism and said
there are even signs in Communist China of a slipping of ideology and
a rise in opposition to central power.
Kirk charged it is only a question of time until "the policy of
inverted religion is abandoned."
Violence Rejected
In response to questions, most of which challenged his conservative
stance, Kirk said the U.S. has never believed in violence as a means of
effective change, while the ideologue has.
He said the Red Chinese are close to a march on eastern Russia to
conquer inner part of Asia.
Kirk said "we don't need to search for Utopia, but for
re-establishment of the community. The world needs a high rate of
imagination, not slogans of ideology."
lie maintained "moral imagination" is needed and that he looked
to the younger generation to provide it.

Yugoslavia is one country that is emerging from the clutch, he
asserted. There, "Communist ideology is already dead." Remarking
that the nation was no longer a police state, he said Tito (the
country's ruler) "is a shield from Soviet Communism."

there are even signs in Communist China of a slipping of ideology and
a rise in opposition to central power.

inverted religion is abandoned."
Violence Rejected
In response to questions, most of which challenged his conservative
stance, Kirk said the U.S. has never believed in violence as a means of
effective change, while the ideologue has.
He said the Red Chinese are close to a march on eastern Russia to
conquer inner part of Asia.
Kirk said "we don't need to search for Utopia, but for
re-establishment of the community. The world needs a high rate of
imagination, not slogans of ideology."

Criticizing ideology as "invented religion," Dr. Russell Kirk spoke
to about 200 persons in Cubberly Auditorium Wednesday as part of
the Political Union's symposium "America on the Threshold of the
Seventies."
Speaking on "Fanatical Ideologies in Our Midst," the noted
conservative said ideology "promises salvation here and now through
political, and probably violent, means."
Kirk defined ideology as "political dogmatism." He added it is a
series of abstract theories, an inversion of religious beliefs, that

such, does not support ideology. It is being uprooted that gives rise to
ideology."
Kirk also cited "mal-education," especially among young people,
about government as a base for ideology.
Escapes Outlined
Kirk outlined two "escapes from ideology." One is to experience
the fruits of it and recover and the other is to "escape from the clutch
of ideology."
