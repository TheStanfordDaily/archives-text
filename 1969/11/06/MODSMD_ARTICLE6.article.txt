# City Council Zones Coyote Hill For Industry And Agriculture
## 
### 
Palo Alto's City Council has
given the go ahead for the
development of the top of Coyote
Hill as light industry.
The decision allows Stanford
Medical School to proceed with
plans to build an animal research
facility near the top of the hill.
Part of the area will be returned
to agricultural conservation use.
The action, taken Monday
night, did not please everyone
concerned, especially
conservationists who wanted the
entire 38 acre parcel designated
planned community. This would
have required development of a
master plan and formal council
approval of any future deviations
from that plan.
Instead, 28 acres have been set
aside for agricultural
conservation: the other ten
remain as LM-5, or limited
industrial use.
The site, above Foothill
Expressway and Hillview Ave.,
includes the top of Coyote Hill.
The research facility, however,
will be built on its slopes on the
10-acre zone. The University's
plans for the buildings include
landscaping and minimal grading
in order that the facility not be an
eyesore.
The Councils' only change in
Stanford's original plans,
submitted to the council months
ago, v/as to trim about two acres
from the facility's LM-5 zoning
and add it to the agricultural
reserve.
Robert Mark, President of the
Stanford Conservation Group,
said his group "is pleased that the
remainder of the hill has gone
back to agricultural
zoning . . .Coyote Hill was first
zoned as LM-5 back about 1960."

However, Mark adds that this
"doesn't solve the problem of the
rest of the hill."
Nothing Legally Binding
Mark points out there is
nothing that legally binds the
University to limit its
development of the LM-5 region
only to the research facility. He
says, "We would have liked to
have seen some mechanism for
guaranteeing that Stanford can't
change this agreement in the
future."
The University's real estate
manager, Boyd Smith, points out
that the University has been more
than open about its plans for
Coyote Hill. "With LM-5 you
don't have to show your plans,
but we decided to do so out of
courtesy." Smith, who is
representing the Medical School's

position before the Council, is
upset at the criticism the
University has received over
Coyote Hill.
He challenges conservationists
to find anywhere in the nation "a
better land development program
than Stanford has," pointing out
that 75% of Stanford's academic
reserve has not even been
touched, as compared to the
"great deal of land development
in cities like Los Altos Hills, who
are doing . . .much of the
complaining."
Law Suit
There remains the suit that will
be filed against Stanford and Palo
Alto City nest week by the
Environmental Law Society.
According to conservationist
Joan Heimbigner, "The City
Council move does not change out

plans," because the suit will not
deal with the now approved
zoning change, but with actions
Stanford took last year.
According to Mark, "A year
ago Stanford subdivided parcels of
Coyote Hill . . .now it appears
they are asking to further
subdivide the subdivisions."
Stanford, in doing this, is using a
regulation which allows a parcel
of land to be divided into four or
less subdivisions without getting
formal approval.
But there are restrictions on
this practice, one of them being
that at the time of original
subdivision there was no intent to
further subdivide. According to
Heimbigner, "We are contesting
the validity of that first
subdivision."

Stanford took last year.
According to Mark, "A year
ago Stanford subdivided parcels of
Coyote Hill . . .now it appears
they are asking to further
subdivide the subdivisions."
Stanford, in doing this, is using a
regulation which allows a parcel
of land to be divided into four or
less subdivisions without getting
formal approval.
But there are restrictions on
this practice, one of them being
that at the time of original
subdivision there was no intent to
further subdivide. According to
Heimbigner, "We are contesting
the validity of that first
subdivision."
Palo Alto's City Council has
given the go ahead for the
development of the top of Coyote
Hill as light industry.
The decision allows Stanford
Medical School to proceed with
plans to build an animal research
facility near the top of the hill.
Part of the area will be returned
to agricultural conservation use.
The action, taken Monday
night, did not please everyone
concerned, especially
conservationists who wanted the
entire 38 acre parcel designated
planned community. This would
have required development of a
master plan and formal council
approval of any future deviations
from that plan.
Instead, 28 acres have been set
aside for agricultural
conservation: the other ten
remain as LM-5, or limited
industrial use.
The site, above Foothill
Expressway and Hillview Ave.,
includes the top of Coyote Hill.
The research facility, however,
will be built on its slopes on the
10-acre zone. The University's
plans for the buildings include
landscaping and minimal grading
in order that the facility not be an
eyesore.
The Councils' only change in
Stanford's original plans,
submitted to the council months
ago, v/as to trim about two acres
from the facility's LM-5 zoning
and add it to the agricultural
reserve.
Robert Mark, President of the
Stanford Conservation Group,
said his group "is pleased that the
remainder of the hill has gone
back to agricultural
zoning . . .Coyote Hill was first
zoned as LM-5 back about 1960."

However, Mark adds that this
"doesn't solve the problem of the
rest of the hill."
Nothing Legally Binding
Mark points out there is
nothing that legally binds the
University to limit its
development of the LM-5 region
only to the research facility. He
says, "We would have liked to
have seen some mechanism for
guaranteeing that Stanford can't
change this agreement in the
future."
The University's real estate
manager, Boyd Smith, points out
that the University has been more
than open about its plans for
Coyote Hill. "With LM-5 you
don't have to show your plans,
but we decided to do so out of
courtesy." Smith, who is
representing the Medical School's

position before the Council, is
upset at the criticism the
University has received over
Coyote Hill.
He challenges conservationists
to find anywhere in the nation "a
better land development program
than Stanford has," pointing out
that 75% of Stanford's academic
reserve has not even been
touched, as compared to the
"great deal of land development
in cities like Los Altos Hills, who
are doing . . .much of the
complaining."
Law Suit
There remains the suit that will
be filed against Stanford and Palo
Alto City nest week by the
Environmental Law Society.
According to conservationist
Joan Heimbigner, "The City
Council move does not change out

plans," because the suit will not
deal with the now approved
zoning change, but with actions
Stanford took last year.
