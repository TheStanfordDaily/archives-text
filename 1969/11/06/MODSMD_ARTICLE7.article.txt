# Continuing Debate
## Six Profs Reveal Salaries 
### 
A growing number of
University faculty have taken
individual stands on the
continuing salary controversy by
publicly disclosing their salaries.
Six members of the history
department, listed below, have
joined the 33 faculty members
whose salaries were printed in
yesterday's Daily.
Although the New University
Conference (NUC) solicited the
salary data, those faculty who
complied are not necessarily
members of the NUC, as was
erroneously reported in
yesterday's article.

Figures released by the
University administration Tuesday
show that three top administrative
officers receive 12-month salaries
of $40,000 or more. Another
half-dozen are paid between
$35,000 and $40,000.
Lyman Statement
In a statement accompanying
the University's salary figures,
Provost Lyman said "an
individual's salary is his own
business and his alone unless he
chooses, on his own initiative, to
disclose it to others ..."
Data sent the faculty by Lyman
included average, median,
maximum salaries by broad
academic fields over the past
seven years at Stanford.
The 1969-70 information
showed the average salary of 223
associate professors is now
$15,712, compared to $13,001
among 279 assistant professors.
When grouped into nine broad
academic fields, the median
salaries paid ranged from lows of
$19,113 in earth sciences and
$19,150 in education to highs of

$21,479 in business and $24,500
in law.
M edians
Medians of $19,400 in the
humanities, $20,000 in the social
sciences, and $20,928 in the
physical sciences compared with
$20,050 for engineering and
$21,000 for medicine on a
nine-month basis.
In actuality, medical faculty are
paid on an 11-month basis.
The report also showed that
instructors in the humanities and
sciences receive a median salary of
$8,200, while those in medicine
have a median of $9,000.
On the administrative side, 15
individuals receive 12-month
salaries of $30,000 to $35,000.
The following history
department faculty have released
their salaries to the Daily:
Paul S. Seaver, Assist. Prof.,
$12,300; Martin A. Miller,
Instructor, $8,700; Paul
Robinson, Assist. Prof., $10,450;
Peter Mellini, Instructor, $8,500;
Kenneth Jackson, Assist. Prof.,
$10,000; Barton Bernstein, Assoc.
Prof., $13,750.
