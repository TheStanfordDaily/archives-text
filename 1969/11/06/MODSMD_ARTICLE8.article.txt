# Clash At MIT Lab
## 
### 
CAMBRIDGE (AP)- Squads of
police drove some 300 anti war
protestors away from a
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology research laboratory
Wednesday.
The police marched in on the
protestors after some of them had
forcibly prevented research
workers from entering the
instrumentation laboratory.
Some ten persons were treated
for minor injuries. An MIT
spokesman said seven of the
number wore not MIT students.

The disturbance took place at
laboratory five, where researchers
are working on the guidance
system for the Poseidon missile,
MlRVâ€”which is one of the targets
of the demonstrators, who
demand that MIT get out of any
war-related research.
The demonstrations are being
directed by the November Action
Coalition, which in a statement
later claimed a victory because it
said research in laboratory five
was halted for two hours.
MIT said the work went on as
usual.
