# Toxicologist Cites Pollution Solution
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Medical school professor
Kobert H. Dreisbach has some
startling solutions to ecological
catastrophe in the Bay Area.
Put all the houses where the
streets are now, he wistfully
suggests. Then plow and plant the
land, using treated human waste
for fertilizer. Replace cars with
well-developed mass transit
systems. Distribute population
over sparsely settled regions
elsewhere in the country.
See page three of Uxlay's edition for
excerpts from "Handbook of the San
Francisco Region."
Extreme? Think of the price
we're paying now, Dreisbach
admonished.
"A few individuals are
beginning to talk about ecological
catastrophe coming in 10 to 20
years," the toxicologist and
pharmacy professor pointed out.
"I contend that ecological
catastrophe is here now and we
only need to open our eyes to see
it."
Dreisbach has been
considerably more meticulous in
his approach. Yesterday he
announced completion of his
full-time two-year study of human
ecology in the Bay Area. The
576-page report contains some
"obvious, but apaprently
unthinkable answers" to pollution
and waste of natural resources.
"The key is to consume
nothing—use it, but don't
consume it," Dreisbach explained.
To "get into equilibrium" with
the environment is the goal.
He singled out automobiles as
the greatest culprits in upsetting
the balance. Each year they burn
half the world's refined petroleum
and lead, spewing them into the
air as unrecoverable pollution.
"We're sold a bill of goods
about the automobile," Dreisbach
said He predicted buses could
provide better transportation for
half the cost and one-tenth the
pollution per person.
Dreisbach admitted with a
blush that he owns a car. "I'm as
crazy as everyone else. But if
there were adequate
transportation, I'd be happy to
give it up," he said.
"I'm not so sure I'd like to live
under those circumstances
(prescribed for the future),"
Dreisbach continued. "It will take
100 years not to have too great a
psychological impact."
But he contended that the
situation is too desperate to wait
for future generations to initiate
solutions. When today's babies
die, Dreisbach predicted, the
world as we know it will be gone.
Involves Everyone
Dreisbach said ecological
problems were so complex that
"hero leaders" cannot furnish
solutions. Everyone must become
involved.
Housewives can purchase only
containers which are not thrown
away, he suggested and drivers can
switch to walking, bicycling or
public transportation.
An educated public can press
for testing of factories one at a
time on week-ends to ferret out

the worst polluters, Dreisbach
suggested. Citizens can also fight
"irresponsible" plans like one to
dump sewage twenty miles from
shore in the Pacific.
Not only does this Bay Area
scheme ruin the ocean's ecological
balance, Dreisbach said, but it also
costs about $1000 per person and
throws away valuable organic
matter.
Dreisbach said his "eyes were
opened" to the problem about ten
years ago. While travelling in
Europe, he discovered a
"fantastically impressive" French
fort.
"The rock walls have been
lovingly chiseled by hand in the
1850'5," he explained, "to protect
against the Germans. Of course,
they eventually went right around
it and conquered the city."

it and conquered the city."
Medical school professor
Kobert H. Dreisbach has some
startling solutions to ecological
catastrophe in the Bay Area.
Put all the houses where the
streets are now, he wistfully
suggests. Then plow and plant the
land, using treated human waste
for fertilizer. Replace cars with
well-developed mass transit
systems. Distribute population
over sparsely settled regions
elsewhere in the country.
See page three of Uxlay's edition for
excerpts from "Handbook of the San
Francisco Region."
Extreme? Think of the price
we're paying now, Dreisbach
admonished.
"A few individuals are
beginning to talk about ecological
catastrophe coming in 10 to 20
years," the toxicologist and
pharmacy professor pointed out.
"I contend that ecological
catastrophe is here now and we
only need to open our eyes to see
it."
Dreisbach has been
considerably more meticulous in
his approach. Yesterday he
announced completion of his
full-time two-year study of human
ecology in the Bay Area. The
576-page report contains some
"obvious, but apaprently
unthinkable answers" to pollution
and waste of natural resources.
"The key is to consume
nothing—use it, but don't
consume it," Dreisbach explained.
To "get into equilibrium" with
the environment is the goal.
He singled out automobiles as
the greatest culprits in upsetting
the balance. Each year they burn
half the world's refined petroleum
and lead, spewing them into the
air as unrecoverable pollution.
"We're sold a bill of goods
about the automobile," Dreisbach
said He predicted buses could
provide better transportation for
half the cost and one-tenth the
pollution per person.
Dreisbach admitted with a
blush that he owns a car. "I'm as
crazy as everyone else. But if
there were adequate
transportation, I'd be happy to
give it up," he said.
"I'm not so sure I'd like to live
under those circumstances
(prescribed for the future),"
Dreisbach continued. "It will take
100 years not to have too great a
psychological impact."
But he contended that the
situation is too desperate to wait
for future generations to initiate
solutions. When today's babies
die, Dreisbach predicted, the
world as we know it will be gone.
Involves Everyone
Dreisbach said ecological
problems were so complex that
"hero leaders" cannot furnish
solutions. Everyone must become
involved.
Housewives can purchase only
containers which are not thrown
away, he suggested and drivers can
switch to walking, bicycling or
public transportation.
An educated public can press
for testing of factories one at a
time on week-ends to ferret out

the worst polluters, Dreisbach
suggested. Citizens can also fight
"irresponsible" plans like one to
dump sewage twenty miles from
shore in the Pacific.
Not only does this Bay Area
scheme ruin the ocean's ecological
balance, Dreisbach said, but it also
costs about $1000 per person and
throws away valuable organic
matter.
Dreisbach said his "eyes were
opened" to the problem about ten
years ago. While travelling in
Europe, he discovered a
"fantastically impressive" French
fort.
"The rock walls have been
lovingly chiseled by hand in the
1850'5," he explained, "to protect
against the Germans. Of course,
they eventually went right around
it and conquered the city."
