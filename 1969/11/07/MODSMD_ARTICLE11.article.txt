# Confront Reality
## Become People 
### Marc Sapir 
The U.S. presence in Vietnam
has nothing to do with the
interests of the American people.
The people voted for peace in '64,
so we went to war. The people
voted against war in '68 so we
have more war. Of course the
people will vote for peace in '70
and '72; it seems probable that
the war will slow down, but the
U.S. presence in S.E. Asia will
continue no matter what the
people want or think. (Maybe the
people will learn something about
U.S. democracy).
We will stay in S.E. Asia
because stability of the nation is
based upon stability of the
corporate capitalist economy. As
any high school senior knows,
capitalism requires expansion. If
you don't expand, a lot of
' money gets taken out of the
system as non re-invested profit,
and unemployment goes wild. A
few other things and the system
collapses.
So while the U.S. presence in
Vietnam has been costly—too
costly, in fact, to be called a
mistake that just can't be
ended -that presence is based
upon a well-developed strategy of
economic growth of U.S.
corporations.
As David Rockefeller and
Stanford Trustee William
Hewletts' Chase Manhattan Bank
puts it (referring to Thailand):
"Thailand will he an important
investment area for big business
once the guerrilla insurgency there
has been contained."
Rigger and Richer
Thailand is, of course, bigger
and richer in resources than
Vietnam; and Indonesia—one of
the many places where SRI holds
big business strategy
conferences—is the real treasure in
S.E. Asia. The question for the
leaders (political and economic)
is: now that winning the war
against an indigenous
communist-led revolution is no
longer conceivable, how to
strengthen the U.S. position
politically, militarily and thereby
economically in the long run.
How to leave and yet stay. How
to fake left and cut right. How to
stay in Vietnam long enough to
win in Thailand, Laos, or
Indonesia, if necessary.
Unfortunately, the Moratorium
is helping the leaders to leave and
yet stay. For the Moratorium is
the moral outcry of a nation in
agony rather than the political
outcry o! a people in revolt. While
most of us became opposed to the
war morally first, we should
recognize that moral outcry is a
shield behind which even the devil
may hide. (Why, we might ask,
has t he moral outrage of President
Pitzer not caused him to resign
from the board of the RAND
Corporation, which is designing
the methods our Armies will use
to put down the Thais, Latin
Americans, and other peoples.)
Another way of putting it is,
action speaks louder than words,
and the Moratorium appears to be
preoccupied not only with words,
I)ut with words that don't tell the
truth about the U.S. Vietnam is
not a mistake!
Confront Reality
The Moratorium has been
unwilling to confront the reality
which created Vietnam, and the
entire cold war before it. It has
been unwilling to draw the
perfectly clear lines between the
Vietnam war and the growing
political repression at home. It
talks door-to-door about how bad
inflation is, but it doesn't talk
anywhere about why inflation is.
It doesn't mention the fact that
profits along with prices are sky
high Why doesn't the Moratorium
put its followers up against
reality? Possibly it is because the
Moratorium wants to maintain its
broad-based support. But it is also
possible that Moratorium leaders
ire men who do not want to face

up to the real choices that people
must make in our country today
about whether to accept or reject
the basic institutions and values of
U.S. capitalism.
In the real world which the
Moratorium shuns, the U.S.
today is a battlefield. Almost
every leader of the
anti-draft/anti-war movement
prior to the Moratorium is either
in jail or facing heavy jail
sentences. In this context Spiro
Agnew's statement that "we can
afford to separate anti-war
demonstrators from society with
no more regret than we should
feel over discarding rotten apples
from a barrel" is not in the least
frivolous.
No leadership
Today there is no longer a
national leadership of the Black
Panther party because 20 Panthers
have been assasinated and
hundreds are in prison oi phoney
charges that parallel the
governments Palmer raids against
the Left in 1917. Today the
government has begun to cut back
tens of thousands of jobs at s* time
when rampant inflation has made
it difficult to get by even with a
job.
The Moratorium is
student-faculty based. It does not
have contact with the world of
workers, blacks, older radicals;
but how can it dare to ignore the
reality which those groups are
facing?
Opponents of the Vietnam war
must understand that all of the
many groups fighting for control
of their local communities (blacks
and chicanos), for better working
conditions (all workers), for an
end to the war and the draft, etc.
are really fighting a common
enemy which uses here the
Marines, and there the police, the
FBI and puppet judges like Julius
Hoffman in order to protect their
international holdings.
Common Enemy
We say that even the Building
Trade workers in Chicago who
fought the blacks and the radicals
last month have a common enemy
with ourselves. They like most
workers must become aware
through strikes and organizing and
contact with young insurgents, of
who controls their jobs and pits
them against the black worker
who also has a family and needs a
job.
We say that the struggle for
black liberation in the U.S. is at
least as important to the
Vietnamese and to ourselves as
canvassing against the war. We say
that the fighting in Tokyo, in
Thailand, in Paris represents the
best interests of all of the worlds'
peoples and deserves our active
support.
Therefore we ask the people to
make the Moratorium a significant
organization. We ask you to
support, through the Moratorium,
the Vietnamese resistance
movement, which has been led by
the NLF; we ask you to support
the labor strikes throughout the
Bay Area even if the workers do
not at first appear to be
supporting you. For when they
see that students are sincere they
will become receptive and will
join the movement to create a
mass base for fundamental change
in America.
We ask you to reject and avoid
politicians in search of a
following, or those who will
counsel, "speak, march, but please
don't get to that 'no business as
usual' stuff." We ask you finally
to hange you life styles as we
have. Don't become businessmen,
professionals, scholars,
researchers. Become people. Sieze
the time. And make the
revolution. That is the only way
to peace with freedom for all
people.

ire men who do not want to face

up to the real choices that people
must make in our country today
about whether to accept or reject
the basic institutions and values of
U.S. capitalism.
In the real world which the
Moratorium shuns, the U.S.
today is a battlefield. Almost
every leader of the
anti-draft/anti-war movement
prior to the Moratorium is either
in jail or facing heavy jail
sentences. In this context Spiro
Agnew's statement that "we can
afford to separate anti-war
demonstrators from society with
no more regret than we should
feel over discarding rotten apples
from a barrel" is not in the least
frivolous.
No leadership
Today there is no longer a
national leadership of the Black
Panther party because 20 Panthers
have been assasinated and
hundreds are in prison oi phoney
charges that parallel the
governments Palmer raids against
the Left in 1917. Today the
government has begun to cut back
tens of thousands of jobs at s* time
when rampant inflation has made
it difficult to get by even with a
job.
The Moratorium is
student-faculty based. It does not
have contact with the world of
workers, blacks, older radicals;
but how can it dare to ignore the
reality which those groups are
facing?
Opponents of the Vietnam war
must understand that all of the
many groups fighting for control
of their local communities (blacks
and chicanos), for better working
conditions (all workers), for an
end to the war and the draft, etc.
are really fighting a common
enemy which uses here the
Marines, and there the police, the
FBI and puppet judges like Julius
Hoffman in order to protect their
international holdings.
Common Enemy
We say that even the Building
Trade workers in Chicago who
fought the blacks and the radicals
last month have a common enemy
with ourselves. They like most
workers must become aware
through strikes and organizing and
contact with young insurgents, of
who controls their jobs and pits
them against the black worker
who also has a family and needs a
job.
We say that the struggle for
black liberation in the U.S. is at
least as important to the
Vietnamese and to ourselves as
canvassing against the war. We say
that the fighting in Tokyo, in
Thailand, in Paris represents the
best interests of all of the worlds'
peoples and deserves our active
support.
Therefore we ask the people to
make the Moratorium a significant
organization. We ask you to
support, through the Moratorium,
the Vietnamese resistance
movement, which has been led by
the NLF; we ask you to support
the labor strikes throughout the
Bay Area even if the workers do
not at first appear to be
supporting you. For when they
see that students are sincere they
will become receptive and will
join the movement to create a
mass base for fundamental change
in America.
We ask you to reject and avoid
politicians in search of a
following, or those who will
counsel, "speak, march, but please
don't get to that 'no business as
usual' stuff." We ask you finally
to hange you life styles as we
have. Don't become businessmen,
professionals, scholars,
researchers. Become people. Sieze
the time. And make the
revolution. That is the only way
to peace with freedom for all
people.

The U.S. presence in Vietnam
has nothing to do with the
interests of the American people.
The people voted for peace in '64,
so we went to war. The people
voted against war in '68 so we
have more war. Of course the
people will vote for peace in '70
and '72; it seems probable that
the war will slow down, but the
U.S. presence in S.E. Asia will
continue no matter what the
people want or think. (Maybe the
people will learn something about
U.S. democracy).
We will stay in S.E. Asia
because stability of the nation is
based upon stability of the
corporate capitalist economy. As
any high school senior knows,
capitalism requires expansion. If
you don't expand, a lot of
' money gets taken out of the
system as non re-invested profit,
and unemployment goes wild. A
few other things and the system
collapses.
So while the U.S. presence in
Vietnam has been costly—too
costly, in fact, to be called a
mistake that just can't be
ended -that presence is based
upon a well-developed strategy of
economic growth of U.S.
corporations.
As David Rockefeller and
Stanford Trustee William
Hewletts' Chase Manhattan Bank
puts it (referring to Thailand):
"Thailand will he an important
investment area for big business
once the guerrilla insurgency there
has been contained."
Rigger and Richer
Thailand is, of course, bigger
and richer in resources than
Vietnam; and Indonesia—one of
the many places where SRI holds
big business strategy
conferences—is the real treasure in
S.E. Asia. The question for the
leaders (political and economic)
is: now that winning the war
against an indigenous
communist-led revolution is no
longer conceivable, how to
strengthen the U.S. position
politically, militarily and thereby
economically in the long run.
How to leave and yet stay. How
to fake left and cut right. How to
stay in Vietnam long enough to
win in Thailand, Laos, or
Indonesia, if necessary.
Unfortunately, the Moratorium
is helping the leaders to leave and
yet stay. For the Moratorium is
the moral outcry of a nation in
agony rather than the political
outcry o! a people in revolt. While
most of us became opposed to the
war morally first, we should
recognize that moral outcry is a
shield behind which even the devil
may hide. (Why, we might ask,
has t he moral outrage of President
Pitzer not caused him to resign
from the board of the RAND
Corporation, which is designing
the methods our Armies will use
to put down the Thais, Latin
Americans, and other peoples.)
Another way of putting it is,
action speaks louder than words,
and the Moratorium appears to be
preoccupied not only with words,
I)ut with words that don't tell the
truth about the U.S. Vietnam is
not a mistake!
Confront Reality
The Moratorium has been
unwilling to confront the reality
which created Vietnam, and the
entire cold war before it. It has
been unwilling to draw the
perfectly clear lines between the
Vietnam war and the growing
political repression at home. It
talks door-to-door about how bad
inflation is, but it doesn't talk
anywhere about why inflation is.
It doesn't mention the fact that
profits along with prices are sky
high Why doesn't the Moratorium
put its followers up against
reality? Possibly it is because the
Moratorium wants to maintain its
broad-based support. But it is also
possible that Moratorium leaders
ire men who do not want to face

up to the real choices that people
must make in our country today
about whether to accept or reject
the basic institutions and values of
U.S. capitalism.

voted against war in '68 so we
have more war. Of course the
people will vote for peace in '70
and '72; it seems probable that
the war will slow down, but the
U.S. presence in S.E. Asia will
continue no matter what the
people want or think. (Maybe the
people will learn something about
U.S. democracy).
We will stay in S.E. Asia
because stability of the nation is
based upon stability of the
corporate capitalist economy. As
any high school senior knows,
capitalism requires expansion. If
you don't expand, a lot of
' money gets taken out of the
system as non re-invested profit,
and unemployment goes wild. A
few other things and the system
collapses.
So while the U.S. presence in
Vietnam has been costly—too
costly, in fact, to be called a
mistake that just can't be
ended -that presence is based
upon a well-developed strategy of
economic growth of U.S.
corporations.
As David Rockefeller and
Stanford Trustee William
Hewletts' Chase Manhattan Bank
puts it (referring to Thailand):
"Thailand will he an important
investment area for big business
once the guerrilla insurgency there
has been contained."
Rigger and Richer
Thailand is, of course, bigger
and richer in resources than
Vietnam; and Indonesia—one of
the many places where SRI holds
big business strategy
conferences—is the real treasure in
S.E. Asia. The question for the
leaders (political and economic)
is: now that winning the war
against an indigenous
communist-led revolution is no
longer conceivable, how to
strengthen the U.S. position
politically, militarily and thereby
economically in the long run.
How to leave and yet stay. How
to fake left and cut right. How to
stay in Vietnam long enough to
win in Thailand, Laos, or
Indonesia, if necessary.
Unfortunately, the Moratorium
is helping the leaders to leave and
yet stay. For the Moratorium is
the moral outcry of a nation in
agony rather than the political
outcry o! a people in revolt. While
most of us became opposed to the
war morally first, we should
recognize that moral outcry is a
shield behind which even the devil
may hide. (Why, we might ask,
has t he moral outrage of President
Pitzer not caused him to resign
from the board of the RAND
Corporation, which is designing
the methods our Armies will use
to put down the Thais, Latin
Americans, and other peoples.)
Another way of putting it is,
action speaks louder than words,
and the Moratorium appears to be
preoccupied not only with words,
I)ut with words that don't tell the
truth about the U.S. Vietnam is
not a mistake!
Confront Reality
The Moratorium has been
unwilling to confront the reality
which created Vietnam, and the
entire cold war before it. It has
been unwilling to draw the
perfectly clear lines between the
Vietnam war and the growing
political repression at home. It
talks door-to-door about how bad
inflation is, but it doesn't talk
anywhere about why inflation is.
It doesn't mention the fact that
profits along with prices are sky
high Why doesn't the Moratorium
put its followers up against
reality? Possibly it is because the
Moratorium wants to maintain its
broad-based support. But it is also
possible that Moratorium leaders
ire men who do not want to face

up to the real choices that people
must make in our country today
about whether to accept or reject
the basic institutions and values of
U.S. capitalism.
In the real world which the
Moratorium shuns, the U.S.
today is a battlefield. Almost
every leader of the
anti-draft/anti-war movement
prior to the Moratorium is either
in jail or facing heavy jail
sentences. In this context Spiro
Agnew's statement that "we can
afford to separate anti-war
demonstrators from society with
no more regret than we should
feel over discarding rotten apples
from a barrel" is not in the least
frivolous.
No leadership
Today there is no longer a
national leadership of the Black
Panther party because 20 Panthers
have been assasinated and
hundreds are in prison oi phoney
charges that parallel the
governments Palmer raids against
the Left in 1917. Today the
government has begun to cut back
tens of thousands of jobs at s* time
when rampant inflation has made
it difficult to get by even with a
job.
The Moratorium is
student-faculty based. It does not
have contact with the world of
workers, blacks, older radicals;
but how can it dare to ignore the
reality which those groups are
facing?
Opponents of the Vietnam war
must understand that all of the
many groups fighting for control
of their local communities (blacks
and chicanos), for better working
conditions (all workers), for an
end to the war and the draft, etc.
are really fighting a common
enemy which uses here the
Marines, and there the police, the
FBI and puppet judges like Julius
Hoffman in order to protect their
international holdings.
Common Enemy
We say that even the Building
Trade workers in Chicago who
fought the blacks and the radicals
last month have a common enemy
with ourselves. They like most
workers must become aware
through strikes and organizing and
contact with young insurgents, of
who controls their jobs and pits
them against the black worker
who also has a family and needs a
job.
We say that the struggle for
black liberation in the U.S. is at
least as important to the
Vietnamese and to ourselves as
canvassing against the war. We say
that the fighting in Tokyo, in
Thailand, in Paris represents the
best interests of all of the worlds'
peoples and deserves our active
support.
Therefore we ask the people to
make the Moratorium a significant
organization. We ask you to
support, through the Moratorium,
the Vietnamese resistance
movement, which has been led by
the NLF; we ask you to support
the labor strikes throughout the
Bay Area even if the workers do
not at first appear to be
supporting you. For when they
see that students are sincere they
will become receptive and will
join the movement to create a
mass base for fundamental change
in America.
We ask you to reject and avoid
politicians in search of a
following, or those who will
counsel, "speak, march, but please
don't get to that 'no business as
usual' stuff." We ask you finally
to hange you life styles as we
have. Don't become businessmen,
professionals, scholars,
researchers. Become people. Sieze
the time. And make the
revolution. That is the only way
to peace with freedom for all
people.

U.S. capitalism.
In the real world which the
Moratorium shuns, the U.S.
today is a battlefield. Almost
every leader of the
anti-draft/anti-war movement
prior to the Moratorium is either
in jail or facing heavy jail
sentences. In this context Spiro
Agnew's statement that "we can
afford to separate anti-war
demonstrators from society with
no more regret than we should
feel over discarding rotten apples
from a barrel" is not in the least
frivolous.
No leadership
Today there is no longer a
national leadership of the Black
Panther party because 20 Panthers
have been assasinated and
hundreds are in prison oi phoney
charges that parallel the
governments Palmer raids against
the Left in 1917. Today the
government has begun to cut back
tens of thousands of jobs at s* time
when rampant inflation has made
it difficult to get by even with a
job.
The Moratorium is
student-faculty based. It does not
have contact with the world of
workers, blacks, older radicals;
but how can it dare to ignore the
reality which those groups are
facing?
Opponents of the Vietnam war
must understand that all of the
many groups fighting for control
of their local communities (blacks
and chicanos), for better working
conditions (all workers), for an
end to the war and the draft, etc.
are really fighting a common
enemy which uses here the
Marines, and there the police, the
FBI and puppet judges like Julius
Hoffman in order to protect their
international holdings.
Common Enemy
We say that even the Building
Trade workers in Chicago who
fought the blacks and the radicals
last month have a common enemy
with ourselves. They like most
workers must become aware
through strikes and organizing and
contact with young insurgents, of
who controls their jobs and pits
them against the black worker
who also has a family and needs a
job.
We say that the struggle for
black liberation in the U.S. is at
least as important to the
Vietnamese and to ourselves as
canvassing against the war. We say
that the fighting in Tokyo, in
Thailand, in Paris represents the
best interests of all of the worlds'
peoples and deserves our active
support.
Therefore we ask the people to
make the Moratorium a significant
organization. We ask you to
support, through the Moratorium,
the Vietnamese resistance
movement, which has been led by
the NLF; we ask you to support
the labor strikes throughout the
Bay Area even if the workers do
not at first appear to be
supporting you. For when they
see that students are sincere they
will become receptive and will
join the movement to create a
mass base for fundamental change
in America.
We ask you to reject and avoid
politicians in search of a
following, or those who will
counsel, "speak, march, but please
don't get to that 'no business as
usual' stuff." We ask you finally
to hange you life styles as we
have. Don't become businessmen,
professionals, scholars,
researchers. Become people. Sieze
the time. And make the
revolution. That is the only way
to peace with freedom for all
people.
