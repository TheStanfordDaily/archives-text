# Let's Get Out
## Shadowy Reflections 
### Jesse Cedarbaum 
Okay, it's been a week or
thereabouts since Papa Dick made
his "speech" to the nation, and
it's probably a little late to be
reacting directly to that futile
exercise in pedanticism, but a
week's reflection in the shadow of
the upcoming Moratorium
celebration dredges up some
long-dormant thoughts.
Whose face are we trying to
save in Viet Nam? It seems that
what we are doing is merely
protecting a mask that has been
worn through the centuries by
Ceaser, Napoleon, Hitler, and
other despots who, in their
benevolence, have sought to bring
peace to a united world. Our
pre-occupation with containing
the evils of Communism in the
jungles of far-off Asia is but a
paranoid manifestation of a
weakness inherent in the highly
confused and complex structure
of our nation. It is the insecurity
of the "top dog," the king of the
mountain, the player with the
power. For along with the
ascedance of power comes the
agonizing fear of losing that
power, of being evicted from the
driver's seat.
In his Farewell Address, George
Washington warned his successors
against forming "alliances with
any portion of the foreign world."

He knew what he was talking
about. Our involvement in Viet
Nam has led us by the nose into
the amazingly credible position of
supporting a military-fascist
dictatorship in the name of Life,
Liberty, and the Pursuit of
Happiness. Our allies and disciples
can be immensely proud of us for
offering them the dictatorship of
the right as protection from the
oppression of the left. It's rather
like putting a dog to sleep to spare
him the agony of dying. Six of
one, half a dozen of the other.
Constitutional Government
We've already blown one
chance for getting out of Viet
Nam, saving face and all. That was
in 1966, when "free" elections
were held in the South. At that
point we could have said simply,
"We've accomplished our purpose
here; a constitutional government
has been elected. Now we're
leaving." Never mind the fact that
less than half the South
Vietnamese were allowed to vote,
and the "elected" government
failed to garner even a simple
majority of the votes that were
cast. We'll also ignore the fact that
the most popular candidates were
not allowed to run, and that the
Communists and NLF were not
allowed to participate at all. Never
mind all that. At least we fulfilled

our part of the Geneva
bargain—ten years late.
However, we still can take
advantage of such an opportunity
to get out in a halfway decent
fashion. All we have to do is make
sure that the next elections held
in South Viet Nam (hopefully
soon) are indeed "free"—open to
all as candidates and voters. Then,
having truly fulfilled our part of
the 1956 Geneva agreement, we
can disengage ourselves from the
conflict and put an end to the
senseless slaughter of our men,
and enormous drain on our
economy, and the discontent that
is shredding our nation from
within.
Right or Wrong
"My country, right or wrong!"
is a familiar quote which has
become a conditioned response of
the "hawks" to those who
criticize the war. But very few of
those who throw those words
around ever bother to complete
the thought "when right, to be
kept right; when wrong to be put
right." Right or wrong, Mr.
Nixon, it's our country as well as
yours. Let's make certain it's
right.
