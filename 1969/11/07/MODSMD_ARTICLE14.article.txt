Quite Another Matter
Editor, THE DAILY:
With respect to your front page
revelation of salaries, I wish to
state that I am so "loosely
coalesced" with NUC as actually
to be a non-member of that
organization. The point is
important, for it is not only the
members of NUC who feel as
others of us do about privacy of
salaries. Injustices have often been
perpetrated in the name of
confidentiality, and by stating our
salaries many of us hoped to take
•» step toward eliminating financial
confidentiality as a key factor in
employment and promotion
practices. Although I urge all
Stanford faculty and staff to take
this step, I oppose the publication
of stolen confidential evaluations
of individuals; such a thing is
quite another matter.

Editor, THE DAILY:
As a participant in the October
Moratorium, I am becoming
increasingly concerned with the
• character of the protest as it
escalates, and I believe there are

many who share my concern.
Therefore, I would like to ask the
leaders of the Moratorium for
some public answers to a few
questions.
First, would the term
"immediate withdrawal" please be
defined Although the resolution
for immediate withdrawal easily
passed at the Sunday meeting, I
know many October workers who
will not work in November
because of uncertainties
concerning "immediate
withdrawal." At a house meeting
in Donner last week, John Kramer
said that a withdrawal by a
definite date (such as Senator
Goodell's December 1970) would
be considered an "immediate
withdrawal." This is far different
from the reckless extraction of
troops that many fear is implied. I
think some public clarification is
needed here.
Furthermore, the real beauty of
the October Moratorium seemed
to be the way in which it allowed
a huge mass of people the
opportunity to voice their
opinions, whatever they may have
been, to their community and to
their government. It seems,
however, as the protest escalates,
the Moratorium is asking people

to confrom to a certain set of
ideals. Not only must one support
"immediate withdrawal" to show
his disenchantment with the war,
he also must support the PDM
strike.
The Moratorium in October
was a group of people with a wide
variety uniting in a common
cause—that of ending the war in
Vietnam. It seems to me that
restrictions on the opinions of the
Moratorium participants will
certainly reduce the number of
participants, resulting in a decline
in the effectiveness of a program
based on massive numbers. I ask
the Moratorium leaders to
respond to these charges, hoping
that their response will allow mt
and others like me to continue
working within the Moratorium in
our quest for peace.

Students arc laughing at
President Nixon and his sidekick

on Vietnam more than on
religion. Harvey's crusaders are

burying YAF in a white coffin.
Thefts on campus are increasing

"The Tramp" and"The
Thomas Crown Affair" deserved
much better than they got at
Memorial Auditorium Sunday
night. Watching them was an
audience whose sound effects and
humor were no more human than
those heard when sailors are
permitted ashore after six months
in the Arctic; in other words an
audience not quite ready for the
sophistication of Pinky Ix>e.
Having just arrived in (he Bay
Area from the East, where I
attended an institution to which
Stanford claims some kinship, I
really expected more from
Leland's Junior University. What
is this place, where not one, not

ten, but hundreds of
cleverly-designed paper airplaces
can be tossed from the balcony
and universally cheered; where
comments, foul and otherwise,
can rarely be clever yet always be
roaringly approved? What kind of
subteenage mentality lies so close
to the surface of the men of
Stanford?
I know all too well that
students need to freak out and be
moronic once in a while, but why
not be silly where you're expected
to be, like at football games and
frat parties? I personally know of
three people who actually came to
see the movies, and left the
auditorium in a state of
ill-concealed fury. Why not give
them a chance?

Regarding the article "Trailers

Assuming full occupancy of all
117 4-person units for 3 quarters
per year at $205 per quarter
realizes a gross annual income of
$287,820. For five years, this will
result in a total income of

figures for the cost of the park as

results. Operating expenses
(utilities, bookkeeping, part-time

be balanced by rent during the
summer quarter. It is unrealistic,
furthermore, to assume that after
five years the rent will still be
$205 per quarter.
After five years the University
plans to sell the trailers. 1 have no
real idea what the return would be
but I would guess that 1 /3rd of
the purchase price ($900,000)
would be a fair estimate. This
would result in a total profit on

Editor, THE DAILY:
As a participant in the October
Moratorium, I am becoming
increasingly concerned with the
• character of the protest as it
escalates, and I believe there are

many who share my concern.
Therefore, I would like to ask the
leaders of the Moratorium for
some public answers to a few
questions.
First, would the term
"immediate withdrawal" please be
defined Although the resolution
for immediate withdrawal easily
passed at the Sunday meeting, I
know many October workers who
will not work in November
because of uncertainties
concerning "immediate
withdrawal." At a house meeting
in Donner last week, John Kramer
said that a withdrawal by a
definite date (such as Senator
Goodell's December 1970) would
be considered an "immediate
withdrawal." This is far different
from the reckless extraction of
troops that many fear is implied. I
think some public clarification is
needed here.
Furthermore, the real beauty of
the October Moratorium seemed
to be the way in which it allowed
a huge mass of people the
opportunity to voice their
opinions, whatever they may have
been, to their community and to
their government. It seems,
however, as the protest escalates,
the Moratorium is asking people

to confrom to a certain set of
ideals. Not only must one support
"immediate withdrawal" to show
his disenchantment with the war,
he also must support the PDM
strike.
The Moratorium in October
was a group of people with a wide
variety uniting in a common
cause—that of ending the war in
Vietnam. It seems to me that
restrictions on the opinions of the
Moratorium participants will
certainly reduce the number of
participants, resulting in a decline
in the effectiveness of a program
based on massive numbers. I ask
the Moratorium leaders to
respond to these charges, hoping
that their response will allow mt
and others like me to continue
working within the Moratorium in
our quest for peace.

Editor, THE DAILY:
As a participant in the October
Moratorium, I am becoming
increasingly concerned with the
• character of the protest as it
escalates, and I believe there are

many who share my concern.
Therefore, I would like to ask the
leaders of the Moratorium for
some public answers to a few
questions.
First, would the term
"immediate withdrawal" please be
defined Although the resolution
for immediate withdrawal easily
passed at the Sunday meeting, I
know many October workers who
will not work in November
because of uncertainties
concerning "immediate
withdrawal." At a house meeting
in Donner last week, John Kramer
said that a withdrawal by a
definite date (such as Senator
Goodell's December 1970) would
be considered an "immediate
withdrawal." This is far different
from the reckless extraction of
troops that many fear is implied. I
think some public clarification is
needed here.
Furthermore, the real beauty of
the October Moratorium seemed
to be the way in which it allowed
a huge mass of people the
opportunity to voice their
opinions, whatever they may have
been, to their community and to
their government. It seems,
however, as the protest escalates,
the Moratorium is asking people

to confrom to a certain set of
ideals. Not only must one support
"immediate withdrawal" to show
his disenchantment with the war,
he also must support the PDM
strike.
The Moratorium in October
was a group of people with a wide
variety uniting in a common
cause—that of ending the war in
Vietnam. It seems to me that
restrictions on the opinions of the
Moratorium participants will
certainly reduce the number of
participants, resulting in a decline
in the effectiveness of a program
based on massive numbers. I ask
the Moratorium leaders to
respond to these charges, hoping
that their response will allow mt
and others like me to continue
working within the Moratorium in
our quest for peace.

"The Tramp" and"The

much better than they got at
Memorial Auditorium Sunday
night. Watching them was an
audience whose sound effects and
humor were no more human than
those heard when sailors are
permitted ashore after six months
in the Arctic; in other words an
audience not quite ready for the
sophistication of Pinky Ix>e.
Having just arrived in (he Bay

Stanford claims some kinship, I
really expected more from
Leland's Junior University. What
is this place, where not one, not

ten, but hundreds of
cleverly-designed paper airplaces
can be tossed from the balcony
and universally cheered; where
comments, foul and otherwise,
can rarely be clever yet always be
roaringly approved? What kind of
subteenage mentality lies so close
to the surface of the men of
Stanford?
I know all too well that
students need to freak out and be
moronic once in a while, but why
not be silly where you're expected
to be, like at football games and

Assuming full occupancy of all
