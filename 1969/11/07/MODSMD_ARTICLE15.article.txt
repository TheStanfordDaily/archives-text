# Would You Believe?
## Silent Majority? 
### Art Buchwald 
The strategy of the Nixon
Administration is now clear to
everyone. It is to condemn the
critics and appeal to the people
who aren't saying anything.
Monday evening President Nixon
once asked support from the
"Great Silent Majority of Fellow
Americans," otherwise known as
the GSMFA
Is there a GSMFA, or is it a
political figment of the
Administration's imagination? I
decided to find out.
I chose a typical American
street with typical American
houses and typical American cars
parked in the driveways.
I went up to the first house and
rang the bell.
"I beg your pardon," I said to
the lady who answered the door.
"I wish to speak to a member of
the Great Silent Majority of
Fellow Americans."
"You can't," she said
brusquely.
"Why not?"
Flakes Out
"He's asleep. He's always
asleep. Comes home from work,
eats his dinner and then flakes out
immediately." She slammed the
door.
I went to the next house,
knocked and a child came to the
door.
"May I speak to one of the
Great Silent Majority of Fellow
Americans, please?"
She pointed toward the living
room.
A man, bald head, in his forties,
drinking a can of beer, was seated
in front of his television set
watching replays of last Sunday's
professional football games.
"Sir, I'm doing a survey of the
vast, silent American majority
President Nixon is appealing to.
What did you think of the
President's plan to get us out of
Vietnam?"
The man belched.
Refuses Peace
"Do you agree with President
Nixon," I asked, "that it is not us

but Hanoi who refuses to make
peace?"
The man grunted but refused to
take his eyes off his TV set.
"Sir, don't you have any
opinion on the efforts of the
President to bring about peace
with honor to the most troubled
spot in all of Southeast Asia?"
A commercial came on and the
man turned slowly to me. "Get
the hell out of here."
I skipped two houses and then
rang the bell. A man came to the
door and smiled.
Silent Americans
"Sir, are you one of the great
majority of silent Americans to
whom President Nixon addressed
his remarks last Monday?" I
asked.
"Well," he said, "If you aske
me .. ." Suddenly his wife
appeared at the door.
"Who is it? What does he
want?" she asked.
"Fellow wants to talk to me
about President Nixon's speech."
"Hah, that's the biggest joke of
the year. When they start asking
you what you think, then you
know the country's in trouble,"
his wife shouted.
"But," the husband said, "I
believe that ..."
"Bowling!" his wife said to me.
"Ask him about bowling. That's
the only thing he knows anything
about. The furance is on the fritz,
but that doesn's stop him from
going out to bowl, while the rest
of us catch pneumonia. Mister,
you got the wrong house."
I decided to try one more
house. I rang the bell, and there
was no answer. I rang again. Still
no answer. Then I saw a man
jump out the back window in his
underwear and run down the
alley. I chased him. "Sir, could I
speak to you a moment?"
"Don't kill me," he begged.
"She told me she wasn't married."
"It's about President Nixon and
his silent majority."
"Believe," he said. "I'm not a
guy who talks."

A commercial came on and the
man turned slowly to me. "Get
the hell out of here."
I skipped two houses and then
rang the bell. A man came to the
door and smiled.
Silent Americans
"Sir, are you one of the great
majority of silent Americans to
whom President Nixon addressed
his remarks last Monday?" I
asked.
"Well," he said, "If you aske
me .. ." Suddenly his wife
appeared at the door.
"Who is it? What does he
want?" she asked.
"Fellow wants to talk to me
about President Nixon's speech."
"Hah, that's the biggest joke of
the year. When they start asking
you what you think, then you
know the country's in trouble,"
his wife shouted.
"But," the husband said, "I
believe that ..."
"Bowling!" his wife said to me.
"Ask him about bowling. That's
the only thing he knows anything
about. The furance is on the fritz,
but that doesn's stop him from
going out to bowl, while the rest
of us catch pneumonia. Mister,
you got the wrong house."
I decided to try one more
house. I rang the bell, and there
was no answer. I rang again. Still
no answer. Then I saw a man
jump out the back window in his
underwear and run down the
alley. I chased him. "Sir, could I
speak to you a moment?"
"Don't kill me," he begged.
"She told me she wasn't married."
"It's about President Nixon and
his silent majority."
"Believe," he said. "I'm not a
guy who talks."
The strategy of the Nixon
Administration is now clear to
everyone. It is to condemn the
critics and appeal to the people
who aren't saying anything.
Monday evening President Nixon
once asked support from the
"Great Silent Majority of Fellow
Americans," otherwise known as
the GSMFA
Is there a GSMFA, or is it a
political figment of the
Administration's imagination? I
decided to find out.
I chose a typical American
street with typical American
houses and typical American cars
parked in the driveways.
I went up to the first house and
rang the bell.
"I beg your pardon," I said to
the lady who answered the door.
"I wish to speak to a member of
the Great Silent Majority of
Fellow Americans."
"You can't," she said
brusquely.
"Why not?"
Flakes Out
"He's asleep. He's always
asleep. Comes home from work,
eats his dinner and then flakes out
immediately." She slammed the
door.
I went to the next house,
knocked and a child came to the
door.
"May I speak to one of the
Great Silent Majority of Fellow
Americans, please?"
She pointed toward the living
room.
A man, bald head, in his forties,
drinking a can of beer, was seated
in front of his television set
watching replays of last Sunday's
professional football games.
"Sir, I'm doing a survey of the
vast, silent American majority
President Nixon is appealing to.
What did you think of the
President's plan to get us out of
Vietnam?"
The man belched.
Refuses Peace
"Do you agree with President
Nixon," I asked, "that it is not us

but Hanoi who refuses to make
peace?"
The man grunted but refused to
take his eyes off his TV set.
"Sir, don't you have any
opinion on the efforts of the
President to bring about peace
with honor to the most troubled
spot in all of Southeast Asia?"
A commercial came on and the
man turned slowly to me. "Get
