# Protect Yourself
## Is Privacy Dead? 
### Judith Strasser 
The current scuffle over
publication of faculty salaries
raises a question which is
considerably more important than
whether I know the price paid for
my major professor. In an era of
increasing computer applications
and concern with information
retrieval, we must all consider just
what privacy is, and what it
implies.
Traditionally, our society has
considered certain subjects and
certain facts private; public
revelation of these facts without
the permission of the concerned
individual or organization has
been called "invasion of privacy."
In fact, it is not the information
itself which requires secrecy.
Individuals and organizations
maintain privacy in he hope of
preventing the possible use of the
information against their own
interests. Publication of the salary
schedule of an institution makes
that institution liable to attack for
poor salary management.
Publication of classified research
reports open the researcher's work
to questions of scientific and
ethical validity.
The privacy question was raised
in Congress several years ago when
a national data bank was
proposed. Many of the same
people who questioned the

"invasion of privacy" implicit in a
government controlled
information retrieval system have
gone on to set up their own,
private information systems in
which they gather (for example)
credit information and enable
banks, businesses, or government
agencies to access supposedly
"private" information without the
permission or the knowledge of
the individuals concerned. To be
more blunt, much of the
opposition to a federal data bank
was presented by businessmen
who desired the unregulated
opportunity to make a profit on
"private" information.
Electronic Bugging
As technology advances, this
problem grows. Even today, we
cannot keep information private
from those who would use that
information against us. Telephone
taps, electronic bugging devices,
and existing information retrieval
systems ensure that our salaries,
our credit ratings, our political
associations and our sex lives are
knowable if someone wants to
know them. We certainly cannot
protect information about our
income, for example, from the
government, which uses that
information to assess taxes. But
we can insist that those who have
access to information about us,
make available to us similar
information about them.
In fact, insisting on the end to
false concepts of privacy is our
only means of protecting
ourselves from the misuse of
private information. We need not
fear the government's knowledge
of our income if we know, and
therefore can take action to
control, the uses to which our
income taxes are put. We need not
fear the university's control over
faculty salaries if we know how
salaries are determined and can
take action against inequities. We
need have less fear of police files
on individuals if we can ee the
additional files which indicate
who has had, or can have, access
to that information.
The experts now working in the
field of information retrieval take
special pains to invent hard-and
software guarantees of file
privacy. They claim to provide
secrecy for users' filesâ€”a
guarantee particularly important
to government and management
users of information systems. Yet
the use of computers enables
governemnt and management to
intrude more deeply and
systematically into your privacy.
You can no longer maintain this
traditionally private information
as secret. But you can protect,
yourself against its misuse: (a)
insist that you have access to, and
the ability to change, all
information stored about
yourself, and (b) insist that you
have access to similar information
about those who have collected
information about you.
