# Environmental Chaos

### 
A grim warning that the San
Francisco Bay Area Region either
start to clean up its precious
environment or face burial under
its own garbage was sounded
yesterday by a Stanford
University pharmacologist.
Dr. Robert H. Dreisbach,
professor of pharmacology at the
Stanford University School of
Medicine, said:
"The San Francisco Bay Region
serves as a prime example of
ecological imbalance. It is
increasing its population and, at
the same time, is unwilling to pay
the price to control sewage and
garbage disposal, air pollution,
crime, and traffic congestion.
"If man continues to exist
without destroying himself in the
next century, iu'"re generations
will look upon us as ecological
primitives.
Equilibrium
"We sneer at stone-age man,
considering him primitive and not
worth our attention. At least he
was in equilibrium with his
environment. If man is to survive,
the essential key is equilibrium."
"San Francisco, queen of the
cities, is equal to the rest of the
Bay Region communities in
ecological idiocy," Dr. Dreisbach
wrote.
He explained that the city is
piling office buildings and
apartments higher and higher in a
desperate attempt to get into
balance with expenses. At the
same time, the city is unwilling to
pay the price for its sewage
disposal, and dumps garbage in
the Bay, where all who pass may
see.
Dr. Dreisbach added:
"We think that the ocean will
tolerate our wastes, proposing to
dump inadequately treated sewage
and compressed garbage miles at
sea without thought to ecological
consequences.
Feed Billions
"At the same time we think the
ocean will be able to feed untold
billions of people. We make this
contention in the face of declining
production of fish from pesticide
contamination."
Dr. Dreisbach blames the
destruction of the Bay Area
environment to these factors:
The automobile has made
possible the widespread
subdivision of agricultural land.
Some cities even advertise with
pride that they still have
agricultural land to subdivide.
Developers and builders want
to profit from inexpensive
agricultural land.
City administrators want to
get as much tax income as
possible.
Lax home building regulations
allow cheap construction.
Rapid population growth in
the remainder of the country
supplies a mobile population to
move to the Bay Area.
Tax Base
The idea of an ever-expanding
tax base, so enthusiastically
supported by most local
governments, is a myth, the
pharmacologist said.
"Why should we be trying
desperately to fill open space?
Open space has no inherent cost
of operation. It does not need
sewers, classrooms, administration
buildings, police," Dr. Dreisbach
said.
He cited the city by the Golden
Gate as an example of the tax
myth.
"San Francisco has more jobs
than residents but is still unable to
pay the cost of its operation and
must tax commuters," he said.
"They must build higher and
higher office buildings in a
never-ending spiral of increasing
costs as population density rises."

To halt the destruction of the
Bay Area, Dr. Dreisbach
recommended what he regards as
"obvious, but apparently
unthinkable, answers."
First, the Bay Area Region
must control its growth rate.
Second, it must ban the
individual automobile and develop
mass transportation.
Tax Revenue
"The need of cities for more
tax revenue forces them to
convert all open land to houses
and industry," he said. "However,
cities fail to consider that costs of
government do not stem Irom
open space but from people and
their needs."
He said one approach to
discourage cities from expanding
is to put all tax money into a
common statewide pool that
would be redistributed to cities
according to population.
"Communities would seek to i
stay small since costs per person
go up in relation to population j
density," Dr. Dreisbach explained.
"Cities would be relieved of the I
pressure to subdivide open space,
and the distribution of tax wealth j
would be equalized."
He suggested that remaining /
open space and agricultural land
in the Bay Area be freed from <
taxation or purchased. Public
ownership would allow planning j
and development of the land in a
manner that is compatible with i
the needs of Bay Region
communities.
Purchase Land
Dr. Dreisbach said that outright
purchase of desirable land for |
parks and agriculture might cost i
$3 to $10 billion. The money'
might come by taxing affluence
and those things that have the I
most destructive effect on the
environment.
One of these is the automobile,
which accounts for more than half
of the air pollution of the Bay
Area.
"The cost of the automobile to
the individual and to society is
totally unjustified in relation to
the benefits derived," Dr.
Dreisbach commented. "The
enormous amount of money and
effort now going into the
automobile could begin to search
for solutions to many of the
pressing problems of our cities.
"The automobile has always
been sacrosanct, like the sacred
cows of India, but is there a valid
reason for the sanctity? Its main
justification is an economic crutch
because we are unable to create a
stable economy in any other way.
"The automobile is the single
most destructive element to living
quality, and as such it should be
taxed."
Justify Taxation
He said the damage caused by
the automobile to society,
including its use of a
disproportionate share of the

world s resources, could justity
taxation of at least 50 cents per
mile. A tax of 10 to '20 cents per
mile would be an appropriate
beginning.
The Stanford pharmacologist
added that with increasing
taxation of the automobile,
public transportation would come
into demand, and this could be
supplied at not less than cost.
Turning to the issue of waste
disposal, Dr Dreisbach said that
in 1960 the nine Bay Area
counties generated 2,607,000 tons
of refuse. Estimated at about 4
pounds per person a day, the same
cities today dump 4,560,000 tons
of garbage into the Bay annually.
This would be enough to build a
wall 36 feet wide by 30 feet high
from San Francisco to San Jose.
"The harmful effects of
disposing wastes by covering them
under layers of dirt include

reduction o! ine Bay and
consequently reduction in tidal
currents and oxygenation of
water," he said. Continued filling,
coupled with excessive escape of
organic matter, would suffocate
fish and other wildlife."
Reduction of the Bay would
increase the likelihood of
temperatury inversions. This in
turn would increase the
concentration of pollutants,
which may reach that of Los
Angeles, he said.
An alternative to filling the
Bay, Dr. Dreisbach said, would be
to collect wet garbage and sewage
solids at the source, treat them to
make them bacteriologically safe
and odorless, and use them for
agriculture.
Cans could be recovered for
their metal content, and paper
could be used almost indefinitely,
he added. As for disposable items,
he urged that they be banned

"obvious, but apparently
unthinkable, answers."
First, the Bay Area Region
must control its growth rate.
Second, it must ban the
individual automobile and develop
mass transportation.
Tax Revenue
"The need of cities for more
tax revenue forces them to
convert all open land to houses
and industry," he said. "However,
cities fail to consider that costs of
government do not stem Irom
open space but from people and
their needs."
He said one approach to
discourage cities from expanding
is to put all tax money into a
common statewide pool that
would be redistributed to cities
according to population.
"Communities would seek to i
stay small since costs per person
go up in relation to population j
density," Dr. Dreisbach explained.
"Cities would be relieved of the I
pressure to subdivide open space,
and the distribution of tax wealth j
would be equalized."
He suggested that remaining /
open space and agricultural land
in the Bay Area be freed from <
taxation or purchased. Public
ownership would allow planning j
and development of the land in a
manner that is compatible with i
the needs of Bay Region
communities.
Purchase Land
Dr. Dreisbach said that outright
purchase of desirable land for |
parks and agriculture might cost i
$3 to $10 billion. The money'
might come by taxing affluence
and those things that have the I
most destructive effect on the
environment.
One of these is the automobile,
which accounts for more than half
of the air pollution of the Bay
Area.
"The cost of the automobile to
the individual and to society is
totally unjustified in relation to
the benefits derived," Dr.
Dreisbach commented. "The
enormous amount of money and
effort now going into the
automobile could begin to search
for solutions to many of the
pressing problems of our cities.
"The automobile has always
been sacrosanct, like the sacred
cows of India, but is there a valid
reason for the sanctity? Its main
justification is an economic crutch
because we are unable to create a
stable economy in any other way.
"The automobile is the single
most destructive element to living
quality, and as such it should be
taxed."
Justify Taxation
He said the damage caused by
the automobile to society,
including its use of a
disproportionate share of the

world s resources, could justity
taxation of at least 50 cents per
mile. A tax of 10 to '20 cents per
mile would be an appropriate
beginning.
The Stanford pharmacologist
added that with increasing
taxation of the automobile,
public transportation would come
into demand, and this could be
supplied at not less than cost.
Turning to the issue of waste
disposal, Dr Dreisbach said that
in 1960 the nine Bay Area
counties generated 2,607,000 tons
of refuse. Estimated at about 4
pounds per person a day, the same
cities today dump 4,560,000 tons
of garbage into the Bay annually.
This would be enough to build a
wall 36 feet wide by 30 feet high
from San Francisco to San Jose.
"The harmful effects of
disposing wastes by covering them
under layers of dirt include

reduction o! ine Bay and
consequently reduction in tidal
currents and oxygenation of
water," he said. Continued filling,
coupled with excessive escape of
organic matter, would suffocate
fish and other wildlife."
Reduction of the Bay would
increase the likelihood of
temperatury inversions. This in
turn would increase the
concentration of pollutants,
which may reach that of Los
Angeles, he said.
An alternative to filling the
Bay, Dr. Dreisbach said, would be
to collect wet garbage and sewage
solids at the source, treat them to
make them bacteriologically safe
and odorless, and use them for
agriculture.
Cans could be recovered for
their metal content, and paper
could be used almost indefinitely,
he added. As for disposable items,
he urged that they be banned
A grim warning that the San
Francisco Bay Area Region either
start to clean up its precious
environment or face burial under
its own garbage was sounded
yesterday by a Stanford
University pharmacologist.
Dr. Robert H. Dreisbach,
professor of pharmacology at the
Stanford University School of
Medicine, said:
"The San Francisco Bay Region
serves as a prime example of
ecological imbalance. It is
increasing its population and, at
the same time, is unwilling to pay
the price to control sewage and
garbage disposal, air pollution,
crime, and traffic congestion.
"If man continues to exist
without destroying himself in the
next century, iu'"re generations
will look upon us as ecological
primitives.
Equilibrium
"We sneer at stone-age man,
considering him primitive and not
worth our attention. At least he
was in equilibrium with his
environment. If man is to survive,
the essential key is equilibrium."
"San Francisco, queen of the
cities, is equal to the rest of the
Bay Region communities in
ecological idiocy," Dr. Dreisbach
wrote.
He explained that the city is
piling office buildings and
apartments higher and higher in a
desperate attempt to get into
balance with expenses. At the
same time, the city is unwilling to
pay the price for its sewage
disposal, and dumps garbage in
the Bay, where all who pass may
see.
Dr. Dreisbach added:
"We think that the ocean will
tolerate our wastes, proposing to
dump inadequately treated sewage
and compressed garbage miles at
sea without thought to ecological
consequences.
Feed Billions
"At the same time we think the
ocean will be able to feed untold
billions of people. We make this
contention in the face of declining
production of fish from pesticide
contamination."
Dr. Dreisbach blames the
destruction of the Bay Area
environment to these factors:
The automobile has made
possible the widespread
subdivision of agricultural land.
Some cities even advertise with
pride that they still have
agricultural land to subdivide.
Developers and builders want
to profit from inexpensive
agricultural land.
City administrators want to
get as much tax income as
possible.
Lax home building regulations
allow cheap construction.
Rapid population growth in
the remainder of the country
supplies a mobile population to
move to the Bay Area.
Tax Base
The idea of an ever-expanding
tax base, so enthusiastically
supported by most local
governments, is a myth, the
pharmacologist said.
"Why should we be trying
desperately to fill open space?
Open space has no inherent cost
of operation. It does not need
sewers, classrooms, administration
buildings, police," Dr. Dreisbach
said.
He cited the city by the Golden
Gate as an example of the tax
myth.
"San Francisco has more jobs
than residents but is still unable to
pay the cost of its operation and
must tax commuters," he said.
"They must build higher and
higher office buildings in a
never-ending spiral of increasing
costs as population density rises."

from San Francisco to San Jose.
"The harmful effects of
disposing wastes by covering them
under layers of dirt include

reduction o! ine Bay and
consequently reduction in tidal
currents and oxygenation of

coupled with excessive escape of

fish and other wildlife."
Reduction of the Bay would
increase the likelihood of
temperatury inversions. This in
turn would increase the
concentration of pollutants,
which may reach that of Los

A grim warning that the San
Francisco Bay Area Region either
start to clean up its precious
environment or face burial under
its own garbage was sounded
yesterday by a Stanford
University pharmacologist.
Dr. Robert H. Dreisbach,
professor of pharmacology at the
Stanford University School of
Medicine, said:
"The San Francisco Bay Region
serves as a prime example of
ecological imbalance. It is
increasing its population and, at
the same time, is unwilling to pay
the price to control sewage and
garbage disposal, air pollution,
crime, and traffic congestion.
"If man continues to exist
without destroying himself in the
next century, iu'"re generations
will look upon us as ecological
primitives.
Equilibrium
"We sneer at stone-age man,
considering him primitive and not
worth our attention. At least he
was in equilibrium with his
environment. If man is to survive,
the essential key is equilibrium."
"San Francisco, queen of the
cities, is equal to the rest of the
Bay Region communities in
ecological idiocy," Dr. Dreisbach
wrote.
He explained that the city is
piling office buildings and
apartments higher and higher in a
desperate attempt to get into
balance with expenses. At the
same time, the city is unwilling to
pay the price for its sewage
disposal, and dumps garbage in
the Bay, where all who pass may
see.
Dr. Dreisbach added:
"We think that the ocean will
tolerate our wastes, proposing to
dump inadequately treated sewage
and compressed garbage miles at
sea without thought to ecological
consequences.
Feed Billions
"At the same time we think the
ocean will be able to feed untold
billions of people. We make this
contention in the face of declining
production of fish from pesticide
contamination."
Dr. Dreisbach blames the
destruction of the Bay Area
environment to these factors:
The automobile has made
possible the widespread
subdivision of agricultural land.
Some cities even advertise with
pride that they still have
agricultural land to subdivide.
Developers and builders want
to profit from inexpensive
agricultural land.
City administrators want to
get as much tax income as
possible.
Lax home building regulations
allow cheap construction.
Rapid population growth in
the remainder of the country
supplies a mobile population to
move to the Bay Area.
Tax Base
The idea of an ever-expanding
tax base, so enthusiastically
supported by most local
governments, is a myth, the
pharmacologist said.
"Why should we be trying
desperately to fill open space?
Open space has no inherent cost
of operation. It does not need
sewers, classrooms, administration
buildings, police," Dr. Dreisbach
said.
He cited the city by the Golden
Gate as an example of the tax
myth.
"San Francisco has more jobs
than residents but is still unable to
pay the cost of its operation and
must tax commuters," he said.
"They must build higher and
higher office buildings in a
never-ending spiral of increasing
costs as population density rises."

To halt the destruction of the
Bay Area, Dr. Dreisbach
recommended what he regards as
"obvious, but apparently
unthinkable, answers."
First, the Bay Area Region
must control its growth rate.
Second, it must ban the
individual automobile and develop
mass transportation.
Tax Revenue
"The need of cities for more
tax revenue forces them to
convert all open land to houses
and industry," he said. "However,
cities fail to consider that costs of
government do not stem Irom
open space but from people and
their needs."
He said one approach to
discourage cities from expanding
is to put all tax money into a
common statewide pool that
would be redistributed to cities
according to population.
"Communities would seek to i
stay small since costs per person
go up in relation to population j
density," Dr. Dreisbach explained.
"Cities would be relieved of the I
pressure to subdivide open space,
and the distribution of tax wealth j
would be equalized."
He suggested that remaining /
open space and agricultural land
in the Bay Area be freed from <
taxation or purchased. Public
ownership would allow planning j
and development of the land in a
manner that is compatible with i
the needs of Bay Region
communities.
Purchase Land
Dr. Dreisbach said that outright
purchase of desirable land for |
parks and agriculture might cost i
$3 to $10 billion. The money'
might come by taxing affluence
and those things that have the I
most destructive effect on the
environment.
One of these is the automobile,
which accounts for more than half
of the air pollution of the Bay
Area.
"The cost of the automobile to
the individual and to society is
totally unjustified in relation to
the benefits derived," Dr.
Dreisbach commented. "The
enormous amount of money and
effort now going into the
automobile could begin to search
for solutions to many of the
pressing problems of our cities.
"The automobile has always
been sacrosanct, like the sacred
cows of India, but is there a valid
reason for the sanctity? Its main
justification is an economic crutch
because we are unable to create a
stable economy in any other way.
"The automobile is the single
most destructive element to living
quality, and as such it should be
taxed."
Justify Taxation
He said the damage caused by
the automobile to society,
including its use of a
disproportionate share of the

world s resources, could justity
taxation of at least 50 cents per
mile. A tax of 10 to '20 cents per
mile would be an appropriate
beginning.
The Stanford pharmacologist
added that with increasing
taxation of the automobile,
public transportation would come
into demand, and this could be
supplied at not less than cost.
Turning to the issue of waste
disposal, Dr Dreisbach said that
in 1960 the nine Bay Area
counties generated 2,607,000 tons
of refuse. Estimated at about 4
pounds per person a day, the same
cities today dump 4,560,000 tons
of garbage into the Bay annually.
This would be enough to build a
wall 36 feet wide by 30 feet high
from San Francisco to San Jose.

Lax home building regulations
allow cheap construction.
Rapid population growth in
the remainder of the country
supplies a mobile population to
move to the Bay Area.
Tax Base
The idea of an ever-expanding
tax base, so enthusiastically
supported by most local
governments, is a myth, the
pharmacologist said.
"Why should we be trying
desperately to fill open space?
Open space has no inherent cost
of operation. It does not need
sewers, classrooms, administration
buildings, police," Dr. Dreisbach
said.
He cited the city by the Golden
Gate as an example of the tax
myth.
"San Francisco has more jobs
than residents but is still unable to
pay the cost of its operation and
must tax commuters," he said.
"They must build higher and
higher office buildings in a
never-ending spiral of increasing
costs as population density rises."

To halt the destruction of the
Bay Area, Dr. Dreisbach
recommended what he regards as
"obvious, but apparently
unthinkable, answers."
First, the Bay Area Region
must control its growth rate.
Second, it must ban the
individual automobile and develop
mass transportation.
Tax Revenue
"The need of cities for more
tax revenue forces them to
convert all open land to houses
and industry," he said. "However,
cities fail to consider that costs of
government do not stem Irom
open space but from people and
their needs."
He said one approach to
discourage cities from expanding
is to put all tax money into a
common statewide pool that
would be redistributed to cities
according to population.
"Communities would seek to i
stay small since costs per person
go up in relation to population j
density," Dr. Dreisbach explained.
"Cities would be relieved of the I
pressure to subdivide open space,
and the distribution of tax wealth j
would be equalized."
He suggested that remaining /
open space and agricultural land
in the Bay Area be freed from <
taxation or purchased. Public
ownership would allow planning j
and development of the land in a
manner that is compatible with i
the needs of Bay Region
communities.
Purchase Land
Dr. Dreisbach said that outright
purchase of desirable land for |
parks and agriculture might cost i
$3 to $10 billion. The money'
might come by taxing affluence
and those things that have the I
most destructive effect on the
environment.
One of these is the automobile,
which accounts for more than half
of the air pollution of the Bay
Area.
"The cost of the automobile to
the individual and to society is
totally unjustified in relation to
the benefits derived," Dr.
Dreisbach commented. "The
enormous amount of money and
effort now going into the
automobile could begin to search
for solutions to many of the
pressing problems of our cities.
"The automobile has always
been sacrosanct, like the sacred
cows of India, but is there a valid
reason for the sanctity? Its main
justification is an economic crutch
because we are unable to create a
stable economy in any other way.
"The automobile is the single
most destructive element to living
quality, and as such it should be
taxed."
Justify Taxation
He said the damage caused by
the automobile to society,
including its use of a
disproportionate share of the

world s resources, could justity
taxation of at least 50 cents per
mile. A tax of 10 to '20 cents per
mile would be an appropriate
beginning.
The Stanford pharmacologist
added that with increasing
taxation of the automobile,
public transportation would come
into demand, and this could be
supplied at not less than cost.
Turning to the issue of waste
disposal, Dr Dreisbach said that
in 1960 the nine Bay Area
counties generated 2,607,000 tons
of refuse. Estimated at about 4
pounds per person a day, the same
cities today dump 4,560,000 tons
of garbage into the Bay annually.
This would be enough to build a
wall 36 feet wide by 30 feet high
from San Francisco to San Jose.
"The harmful effects of
disposing wastes by covering them
under layers of dirt include

reduction o! ine Bay and
consequently reduction in tidal
currents and oxygenation of
water," he said. Continued filling,
coupled with excessive escape of
organic matter, would suffocate
fish and other wildlife."
Reduction of the Bay would
increase the likelihood of
temperatury inversions. This in
turn would increase the
concentration of pollutants,
which may reach that of Los
Angeles, he said.
An alternative to filling the
Bay, Dr. Dreisbach said, would be
to collect wet garbage and sewage
solids at the source, treat them to
make them bacteriologically safe
and odorless, and use them for
agriculture.
Cans could be recovered for
their metal content, and paper
could be used almost indefinitely,
he added. As for disposable items,
he urged that they be banned
