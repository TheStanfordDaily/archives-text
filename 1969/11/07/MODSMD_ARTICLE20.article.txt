# Marine Study
## Threatened Life 
### 
Marine life which thrives in the
tide pools along California's
1,200-mile coast line is in danger
of being studied to death, a
Stanford University
pharmacologist reports.
"Increasing numbers of tourists
and students, laden with buckets,
jars, and plastic bags, are
swarming over state beaches by
the thousands, collecting anything
and everything in sight," writes
Dr. Robert H. Dreisbach,
professor of pharmacology at the
Stanford University School of
Medicine.
His comments appear in an
ecological report about the San
Francisco Bay Region to be
published this month.
Dr. Dreisbach said that flights
by state aircraft have observed 59
buses on one day, parked at access
areas from Tomales Bay to
Natural Bridges State Park, and
large groups of collectors. On
another beach as many as 400
children were observed collecting
at one time.

On a single day at Moss Beach
in San Mateo County, a warden
counted 12 busloads of students
collecting specimens. Three days
later, another 12 busloads of
students arrived.
Another warden reported 30
schoolbuses in the
Duxberry-Agate Beach of Marin
County on a single day. All the
children were collecting marine
specimens.
In Santa Cruz County nearly
7,000 visits of collectors annually
have been recorded by wardens in
the Elkhorn Slough area. The
collectors are students from five
state colleges.
There is clear evidence that
uncontrolled collecting of marine
specimens is common throughout
the California coast. Dr. Dreisbach
said.
Collecting is poorly supervised
by parents and teachers, he said.
Students turn every loose rock in
the area and leave it upside down,
with little or no regard for the
welfare of the marine organisms.
Some students pick up more
specimens than they need, and
dump them in the parking lots
before they leave.
"The result of such activity is
that starfish, gastropods, limpets,
and chitons are becoming scarce,"
Dr. Dreisbach said.
He added:
"The waste of marine life by
unthinking persons is deplorable.
And even the legitimate uses of
collecting for scientific and
educational purposes can seriously
deplete marine life species in tide
pools, if the activity is not
regulated."
Dr. Dreisbach said that
threatened depletion of marine
life at Bodega, Tomales and
Bolinas, prompted the director of
the Pacific Marine Station at
Dillon's Beach to develop a study
program in marine environment
for teachers and students.
He sttid that possible steps to
prevent extinction of marine life
should include establishment of
marine reserves whore collecting
would be prohibited, enabling
legislation that would give a state
agency authority to regulate
collecting (at present no single
agency is responsible), and
programs to train teachers in
proper collecting philosophy and
techniques.

the thousands, collecting anything
and everything in sight," writes
Dr. Robert H. Dreisbach,
professor of pharmacology at the
Stanford University School of
Medicine.
His comments appear in an
ecological report about the San
Francisco Bay Region to be
published this month.
Dr. Dreisbach said that flights
by state aircraft have observed 59
buses on one day, parked at access
areas from Tomales Bay to
Natural Bridges State Park, and
large groups of collectors. On
another beach as many as 400
children were observed collecting
at one time.

On a single day at Moss Beach
in San Mateo County, a warden
counted 12 busloads of students
collecting specimens. Three days
later, another 12 busloads of
students arrived.
Another warden reported 30
schoolbuses in the
Duxberry-Agate Beach of Marin
County on a single day. All the
children were collecting marine
specimens.
In Santa Cruz County nearly
7,000 visits of collectors annually
have been recorded by wardens in
the Elkhorn Slough area. The
collectors are students from five
state colleges.
There is clear evidence that
uncontrolled collecting of marine
specimens is common throughout
the California coast. Dr. Dreisbach
said.
Collecting is poorly supervised
by parents and teachers, he said.
Students turn every loose rock in
the area and leave it upside down,
with little or no regard for the
welfare of the marine organisms.
Some students pick up more
specimens than they need, and
dump them in the parking lots
before they leave.
"The result of such activity is
that starfish, gastropods, limpets,
and chitons are becoming scarce,"
Dr. Dreisbach said.
He added:
"The waste of marine life by
unthinking persons is deplorable.
And even the legitimate uses of
collecting for scientific and
educational purposes can seriously
deplete marine life species in tide
pools, if the activity is not
regulated."
Dr. Dreisbach said that
threatened depletion of marine
life at Bodega, Tomales and
Bolinas, prompted the director of
the Pacific Marine Station at
Dillon's Beach to develop a study
program in marine environment
for teachers and students.
He sttid that possible steps to
prevent extinction of marine life
should include establishment of
marine reserves whore collecting
would be prohibited, enabling
legislation that would give a state
agency authority to regulate
collecting (at present no single
agency is responsible), and
programs to train teachers in
proper collecting philosophy and
techniques.
Marine life which thrives in the
tide pools along California's
1,200-mile coast line is in danger
of being studied to death, a
Stanford University
pharmacologist reports.
"Increasing numbers of tourists
and students, laden with buckets,
jars, and plastic bags, are
swarming over state beaches by
the thousands, collecting anything
and everything in sight," writes
