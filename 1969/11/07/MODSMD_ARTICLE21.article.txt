# Trifled Welfare
## Air Pollution Grows 
### 
People would be appalled if
they knew how their welfare is
being trifled with because of
failure of San Francisco Bay Area
cities to come to grips with air
pollution, a Stanford University
pharmacologist contends.
"We are conscious of air
pollutants only when they restrict
visibility," comments Dr Robert
H. Dreisbach, professor of
pharmacology at the Stanford
University School of Medicine, in
his new book, "Handbook of the
San Francisco Region."
However, only 210 tons or 2
percent of the 10,215 tons of
injurious pollutants emitted daily
are visibility limiting," he writes.
One of these is ozone which is not
emitted as such, but is generated
by the action of light and other
pollutants and oxygen, he said.
Colorless, gaseous pollutants, such
as carbon monoxide, ozone, and
hydrocarbons and other organic
compounds are as transparent to
visible light as the normal
constituents of air

Only nitrogen dioxide absorbs
in the visible range of light and
contributes a brown color to the
atmosphere, he explained. "If all
pollutants were as visibility
limiting as the particulate matters,
our range of vision would be
limited to only a few hundred feet
instead of a mile or two during
our worst air pollution episodes,"
Dr. Dreisbach said.
He questioned the validity of
standards for air proposed for
adoption by the California Air
Resources Board last June. The
standards prescribe the levels of
air pollutants which humans can
inhale without danger to health.
There is no evidence to indicate
that these standards are
completely harmless," Dr.
Dreisbach said. "The levels are
determined, in part, by the
possibility of being
(technologically) able to control
emissions in the foreseeable
future. At present,
recommendations for oxidant,

nitrogen, and dioxide visibility are
frequently exceeded," he added.
The Stanford pharmacologist
called for a series of bold
experiments to determine the
source of air pollution that would
indicate the guilty unequivocally.
The experiments would be run
every second weekend. First,
every possible source ot air
pollution would be shut
down—automobiles, trucks, buses,
aircraft, ships, trains, factories,
backyard and agricultural burning.
On succeeding weekends,
polluters would bo permitted to
operate in succession—buses,
trucks, aircraft, trains, industry,
agricultural burning, automobiles
and so forth.
The series would be repeated
often to obtain convincing data.
During each experiment, visual
range would be monitored
carefully, along with other
measurements of air pollution
already being taken by the Bay-
Area Air Pollution Control
Hist riot .

One of these is ozone which is not
emitted as such, but is generated
by the action of light and other
pollutants and oxygen, he said.
Colorless, gaseous pollutants, such
as carbon monoxide, ozone, and
hydrocarbons and other organic
compounds are as transparent to
visible light as the normal
constituents of air

Only nitrogen dioxide absorbs
in the visible range of light and
contributes a brown color to the
atmosphere, he explained. "If all
pollutants were as visibility
limiting as the particulate matters,
our range of vision would be
limited to only a few hundred feet
instead of a mile or two during
our worst air pollution episodes,"
Dr. Dreisbach said.
He questioned the validity of
standards for air proposed for
adoption by the California Air
Resources Board last June. The
standards prescribe the levels of
air pollutants which humans can
inhale without danger to health.
There is no evidence to indicate
that these standards are
completely harmless," Dr.
Dreisbach said. "The levels are
determined, in part, by the
possibility of being
(technologically) able to control
emissions in the foreseeable
future. At present,
recommendations for oxidant,

nitrogen, and dioxide visibility are
frequently exceeded," he added.
The Stanford pharmacologist
called for a series of bold
experiments to determine the
source of air pollution that would
indicate the guilty unequivocally.
The experiments would be run
every second weekend. First,
every possible source ot air
pollution would be shut
down—automobiles, trucks, buses,
aircraft, ships, trains, factories,
backyard and agricultural burning.
On succeeding weekends,
polluters would bo permitted to
operate in succession—buses,
trucks, aircraft, trains, industry,
agricultural burning, automobiles
and so forth.
The series would be repeated
often to obtain convincing data.
During each experiment, visual
range would be monitored
carefully, along with other
measurements of air pollution
already being taken by the Bay-
Area Air Pollution Control
Hist riot .
People would be appalled if
they knew how their welfare is
being trifled with because of
failure of San Francisco Bay Area
cities to come to grips with air
pollution, a Stanford University
pharmacologist contends.
"We are conscious of air
pollutants only when they restrict
visibility," comments Dr Robert
H. Dreisbach, professor of
pharmacology at the Stanford
University School of Medicine, in
his new book, "Handbook of the
San Francisco Region."
However, only 210 tons or 2
percent of the 10,215 tons of
injurious pollutants emitted daily
are visibility limiting," he writes.
