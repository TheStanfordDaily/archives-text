# Mysteries Revealed
## I-A Problems, Goals 
### BILL KINSEY 
Contrary to rumors circulating
through the undergraduates at
Stanford, the International Center
is not a dormitory for foreign
students, nor is the International
Association a clubby organization
for the non-American jet set.
For the past two years the IA
has served two main purposes:
providing a medium through
which foreign students could
increase their impact on campus,
and promoting interaction and
understanding between American
and foreign students.
Through a series of "Saturday
Evenings Abroad," Current Events
Coffee Hours, language exchange
programs and international
conferences, foreign students have
had an impact on the intellectual
and academic life of the campus.
Existing programs such as the
Foreign Policy Workshop and the
Institute for the Study of
Comtemporary Cultures will
ensure that this sphere of activity
continues to be effective.
The second goal—promoting
interaction between American and
foreign students—has enjoyed less
success, and the central problem
faced by the IA is the involvement

of more Americans in IA
activities. This is a problem
because most American students
don't realize that half the lA's
activities are social and open to
all.
Americans Not Involved
It is ironic that there is a
regular flow back to Stanford
from the five overseas campuses
(plus Peace Corps, VIA, etc.) of
students who are presumably
interested in international affairs
yet who never actively express
their interest through an
organization explicitly committed
to internationalism.
Perhaps there is a new breed of
intellectual and cultural tourists
who sample the local fare while
overseas but consider it too rich
for an everyday American diet.
How can American students who
are eager for cross-cultural
contacts find out when, where,
and how they can meet foreign
students?
In a referendum last spring, IA
membership voted to empower
the IA policy board to issue
position statements on both
foreign and domestic political
issues. In response, the IA has this
year established a newspaper

which will publish material of a
political and cultural nature in the
field of international affairs. The
IA Political Committee is anxious
to have people with journalistic
and/or international interests on
the staff or as contributors.
Students who have a potential
interest in the IA are urged to
come to Policy Board meetings, to
drop by the I-Center, or to come
to one of the regularly scheduled
social events. The regular IA
Happy Hour will be held from
four to six this afternoon in
Alondra Lounge of Flo Mo. All
graduate and undergraduate men
and women are invited.
Policy Board Openings
Next week the IA will hold
elections for half of the positions
on the Policy Board. Five
positions are open to Americans
and five to foreign students—both
graduate and undergraduate —and
nominations may be submitted to
the I-Center through 5 PM
Tuesday.
The present Policy Board urges
any student interested in effective
and rewarding contacts between
American and foreign students to
consider running for one of these
positions. The Board is
particularly interested in new
ideas and directions for social and
political activities. IA
memberships are available at the
i-Center.
