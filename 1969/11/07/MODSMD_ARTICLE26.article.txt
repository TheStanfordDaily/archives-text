# Group Reports Ideas On Social Sciences
## 
### 
Establishment of "Graduate
Schools of Applied Behavioral
Science" that could" grant Ph.D.
degrees and "educate students for
inventive development relevant to
social problems" is one
recommendation in the newly
released report of a joint National
Academy of Sciences and Social
Science Research Council
committees headed by psychology
Prof. Ernest R. Hilgard.
"We are living in social crisis,"
begins the report of the
21-member Survey Committee on
the Behavioral and Social
Sciences. The group was formed
nearly three years ago to survey
the country's resources in the
behavioral and social sciences and
to recommend ways of using them
more effectively against social ills.
"There have been riots in our
cities and in our universities," says
the report. An unwanted war
defies efforts to end it. Population
expansion threatens to overwhelm
our social institutions. Our
advanced technology can destroy
natural beauty and pollute the
environment if we do not control
its development and thus its
effects.
"Even while scientific progress
in biology and medicine helps to
relieve pain and prolong life, it
raises new problems relating to
organ transplants, drugs that alter
behavior, and voluntary control of
genetic inheritance.
"At the root of many of these
crises are perplexing problems of
human behavior and relationships.
The behavioral and social sciences,
devoted to studying these
problems, can help us survive
current crises and avoid them in
the future."
Specific Problem Areas
In recommending the
establishment of applied
behavioral science graduate
schools in universities, the
committee envisions schools "of
scientific stature commensurate
with that of the best medical and
engineering schools.
"Beyond (the) methodological
problems, each (school) should
have some specialized areas of
research, for the whole of applied
behavioral science is too broad to
tackle all at once. The problems
of the cities, of poverty, of crime,
of nation-building, of
conservation, of regional
governments, of individual growth
and development, of early
education—any one of a range of
problems—could serve among the
specialties in one school."
Current prototypes of such
schools which the ( omii ittee says
are worth studying iclude Yale's
Institute of Social Science, UC's
statewide Public Policy Research
Organization based at Irvine, the
doctoral program in the policy
sciences at SUNY-Buffalo, and the
College of Human Development at
Penn State.
Social Information
The committee also urges
development of "social
indicators," such as health

measures, education, crime, and
highway safety programs, to
investigate effects of social
innovations and policy changes.
"Most social changes are
gradual," says the report. "A
sensitive social indicator should
tell us whether, in the area to
which it pertains, things are
getting better or worse, and to
what degree. Just as the annual
Economic Report of the President
interprets economic indicators, an
annual social report should
eventually be produced that will
call attention to the significance
of changes in social indicators."
The committee further
recommends establishing a
"national data system" to
centralize and make usefully
available the vast amounts of data
now collected by the government.
At the same time it cautions
strongly against the danger of
invasion of privacy in such a
system.
"The benefits of having policy
guided by accurate information
about the welfare and quality of
life of the citizen can be very
great," says the report. "But it

should be a sad consequence if, in
the, process of obtaining this
information the availability of the
data about individuals became a
limitation on their freedom." To
prevent this they suggest a "high
level" supervisory group to guard
against it.
More Money Needed
A final recommendation is for
an annual increase of 12 to 18
percent in behavioral and social
science research funds to "sustain
normal growth" in these fields
over the next decade.
"The costs of projected new
programs are not included in the
normal-growth projections..." the
report goes on. "The new
programs require abrupt increases
in funding, with each program
having minimum start-up costs."
"The social sciences will
provide no easy solutions in the
near future," the report
concludes, "but they are our best

Social Information
The committee also urges
development of "social
indicators," such as health

measures, education, crime, and
highway safety programs, to
investigate effects of social
innovations and policy changes.
"Most social changes are
gradual," says the report. "A
sensitive social indicator should
tell us whether, in the area to
which it pertains, things are
getting better or worse, and to
what degree. Just as the annual
Economic Report of the President
interprets economic indicators, an
annual social report should
eventually be produced that will
call attention to the significance
of changes in social indicators."
The committee further
recommends establishing a
"national data system" to
centralize and make usefully
available the vast amounts of data
now collected by the government.
At the same time it cautions
strongly against the danger of
invasion of privacy in such a
system.
"The benefits of having policy
guided by accurate information
about the welfare and quality of
life of the citizen can be very
great," says the report. "But it

should be a sad consequence if, in
the, process of obtaining this
information the availability of the
data about individuals became a
limitation on their freedom." To
prevent this they suggest a "high
level" supervisory group to guard
against it.
More Money Needed
A final recommendation is for
an annual increase of 12 to 18
percent in behavioral and social
science research funds to "sustain
normal growth" in these fields
over the next decade.
"The costs of projected new
programs are not included in the
normal-growth projections..." the
report goes on. "The new
programs require abrupt increases
in funding, with each program
having minimum start-up costs."
"The social sciences will

committees headed by psychology
Prof. Ernest R. Hilgard.
"We are living in social crisis,"
begins the report of the
21-member Survey Committee on
the Behavioral and Social
Sciences. The group was formed
nearly three years ago to survey
the country's resources in the
behavioral and social sciences and
to recommend ways of using them
more effectively against social ills.
"There have been riots in our
cities and in our universities," says
the report. An unwanted war
defies efforts to end it. Population
expansion threatens to overwhelm
our social institutions. Our
advanced technology can destroy
natural beauty and pollute the
environment if we do not control
its development and thus its
effects.
"Even while scientific progress
in biology and medicine helps to
relieve pain and prolong life, it
raises new problems relating to
organ transplants, drugs that alter
behavior, and voluntary control of
genetic inheritance.
"At the root of many of these
crises are perplexing problems of
human behavior and relationships.
The behavioral and social sciences,
devoted to studying these
problems, can help us survive
current crises and avoid them in
the future."
Specific Problem Areas
In recommending the
establishment of applied
behavioral science graduate
schools in universities, the
committee envisions schools "of
scientific stature commensurate
with that of the best medical and
engineering schools.
"Beyond (the) methodological
problems, each (school) should
have some specialized areas of
research, for the whole of applied
behavioral science is too broad to
tackle all at once. The problems
of the cities, of poverty, of crime,
of nation-building, of
conservation, of regional
governments, of individual growth
and development, of early
education—any one of a range of
problems—could serve among the
specialties in one school."
Current prototypes of such
schools which the ( omii ittee says
are worth studying iclude Yale's
Institute of Social Science, UC's
statewide Public Policy Research
Organization based at Irvine, the
doctoral program in the policy
sciences at SUNY-Buffalo, and the
