# Union Asks SDS To End Picketing
## 
### 
A Santa Clara union official
said yesterday that striking
steelworkers have asked the
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) to keep out of a strike
against the Pittsburgh-Des Moines
Steel Co.
SDS members, many from
Stanford, have been joining the
picket lines in support of the
two-month old strike. The
strikers, members of Steelworkers
Union Local 4028, have been
limited to four pickets in front of
the plant at any one time by a
court order.
The SDS pickets have been
involved in several clashes with
Santa Clara police, including one
Friday night in which ten persons
were arrested and many injured.
Members of the police riot
squad were prepared for another
violent clash Tuesday night, but
the SDS pickets did not show up
as predicted.
Union Treasurer Jack Wallace
said that union officials told
members of the SDS Tuesday
"not to come back any more."
Wallace added that "we asked
them nicely," and that the union
plans to send a letter to the group
thanking the students for their
help.
However, SDS participation in
the strike "kind of backfired for
us," Wallace said. The breaking
point was Friday's violent
demonstration.
"We don't want to see people
roughed up," he continued. "Only
time will tell how much this hurt

us. It was just one of those
things-—everyone blew up."
Wallace said that the steel plant
has asked the riot squad to return
Tuesday night. He termed the
situation "real bad." So the SDS
was asked not to return to "cool
things down and get the police
out of here," he said.
