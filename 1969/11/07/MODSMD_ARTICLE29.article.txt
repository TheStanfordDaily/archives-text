# Film Review
## Fest Over; 'Young Girls' Here 
### TODD McCarthy 
In that it would be all but
impossible for any one person to
cover the San Francisco Film
Festival (especially for a student
an hour's drive away), I will
refrain from making any
generalizations about the standard
of excellence maintained over the
festival's ten days.
Perhaps the festival could have
used one or two more outright
hits (only Z and Ma Nuit Chez
Maud thoroughly impressed me),
and in retrospect, a greater
emphasis might be placed on
older, more experienced artists,
rather than the likes of Widerberg,
John Schlesinger, Mike Nichols,
and Milos Forman, who, while
talented and interesting, have
relatively limited filmographies.
The quality of the pre-feature
shorts was distressing, as only
Ryan Larkin's animated Walking
demonstrated an unusual creative
talent at work.
This said, let's get on to the
films.
Z: As I pointed out last week,
political and "thriller" elements
are combined here to create a
work which is relevant both as
social commentary and as
entertainment.
Barters to Bourgeois?
The mere fact that Z is popular
with audiences has caused some
European radicals to denounce
the film as catering to bourgeois
sentiments, but such a stand is
just as fallacious as praising a
Samuel Fuller film simply because
it has not been widely seen.
A major reason for Z's success
is that, rather than indulging in
sloganeering and cheap plays for
sympathy, the causes and
intricacies of the murder of an
opposition leader are brought into
focus as much as factual evidence
permits. We are properly but
superficially outraged by the
right-wingers' conduct at the
beginning, but as the case is
opened up, we discover, at the
same time the investigator does,
the appalling circumstances
surrounding the "accidental"
death.
Our hostility toward the fascist
government grows quickly and,
for once, actually becomes

reinforced and irrevocably based
in fact. Perhaps Z reaches the
ultimate in manipulative cinema,
but it is too honest and, simply,
too engrossing to be slighted even
for that reason.
Lions Love: This picture, along
with comments made by Mike
Nichols and Bette Davis, merely
reinforces the idea that people,
not technology or social
importance, are what make
movies vital and enjoyable. When
Agnes Varda points her camera at
Viva!, Ragin and Rado, who are
very pleasant people to spend
time with and who let loose with
some wonderful non sequiturs and
puns, the film is very nice indeed.
Charm Fades
However, when we are faced
with Shriley Clarke's problems in
making a film and the
"importance" of the Kennedy and
Warhol shootings, the film's
charm is lost among the harsh
sounds and images of a television
set. All along, it had been the
charm and relative obliviousness
of the principals which had given
Lions Love life. As a footnote,
Viva! may be potentially one of
the best comidiennes currently
working in a comedically bleak
cinema.
The Boi'ors Gun: This film is
unusual for a festival in that it is
given stature only by the actors,
but even in this light, the film is
disappointing. It is a case of actors
working with a conviction beyond
that demonstrated by the script.
With the unlikely setting of a
British army outpost in post-war
Germany, the drama seems so
trivial that even the label of an
"actors' showcase" amounts to
excessive praise. Fortunately,
David Warner and, even moreso,
Nicol Williamson, are strong
forces on any screen and it is
reasonably intriguing to watch
them dig for character motivation
where it simply does not exist.
Ma Nuit Chez Maud: This third
installment in director Eric
Rohmer's sextet on modern ethics
must be seen and especially heard
to be comprehended. The mere
concept of it (two hours of
talk—and a little plot—concerning
Catholicism, morals and
contemporary life) may put off

those with so-call "cinematic"
sensibilities.
What Talk!
But what talk! A teasing sexual
undercurrent runs throughout the
characters' fascinating
conversations and the fateful
moment of amorous decision
between the staunch Catholic and
the more open-minded Maud is a
hilariously yet bitingly accurate
reflection of the relationship of
men and women in modern
society.
While many recent films and
plays have dramatized our
hangups, self-destruction and
devices for emotional
self-protection, none have done so
with quite the maturity and
intellectual integrity of Ma Nuit
Chez Maud.
Sympathy for the Devil: It
seems futile to try to determine
where Jean-Luc Godard is at on
the basis of this film. Godard, the
most intellectual of directors,
seems here to be severely
questioning his role as a
film-maker and, indeed, whether
he should be making films at all.
He is considerably disturbed by
the concept of the "intellectual
revolutionary," for to be a
revolutionary, the director insists
that one must give up being an
intellectual.
In the film's extraordinary final
shot, Godard himself "kills"
actress-wife Anne Wiazemski, has
her placed on the end of a camera
crane, and photographs the
ascendence of the crane with its
abandoned camera and bloody
dead body.
This may signify many things
or nothing at all, but indicated to
me Godard's belief in the
incompatibility of meaningful
action (revolution) and the
cinema. Yet the fact that Godard
is expressing his views through the
film medium results in an
incredible paradox and reveals
that Godard has not resolved the
issues in his own mind.
Another paradox is that
Godard is both the most
self-consciously stylized and most
realistic director working in the
cinema. Yet another is that, after
directing several films, Godard
decided that the most important

element in the shaping of a
picture is determining the proper
length for individual shots and
scenes, but in this film, he seems
totally oblivious to the demands
of pacing, and has all but
abandoned a concept of structure
in his works.
Intriguing Issue
The most intriguing issue of all
is that under ordinary
circumstances, consideration of a
given film should come before
consideration of the director, but
Godard is reaching the point
where an awareness of his
previous work and idiosyncracies
is virtually required in order to
even put up with his newest
releases.
As it is, Sympathy For The
Devil is somewhat tedious,
intellectually frustrating, but
necessarily fascination to anyone
concerned about where the
cinema is headed.

Currently at the Surf theater,
on a double bill with Truffaut's
Stolen Kisses is Jacques Demy's
musical, The Young Girls of
Rochefort. Finally arriving in San
Francisco after nearly two years,
the film has the curious
distinction among musicals of
actually being under-produced.

Demy, who made the
Umbrellas of Cherbourg,
obviously loves the genre, and the
fact that we sense his passion and
know he is trying as hard as he
can makes up for certain
inadequacies, most of which can
be attributed to financial
depravation. If just one-tenth the
resources poured into such
abominations as Star had been

available to Demy, he probably
would have had a great picture.
There are more than enough
reasons to see the film, not the
least of which is Francoise
Dorleac, who, though tragically
killed shortly after finishing this
picture, remains one of the '60's
most fascinating females. It's also
nice to see her sister, Catherine
Deneuve, smile and move around

with some spunk, in light of her
recent porcelain performances.
The presence of Gene Kelly in this
French language musical merely
brings into focus Demy's love
affair with Hollywood at its
musical best. However, few
Hollywood musicals could ever
boast better scores than Michel
Legrand's for The Young Girls of
Rochefort. It's brilliant.


JOIE DE VIVRE—The cast of "The Young Girls of Rochefort" (I. to r. Grover Dale, Francoise Dorleac, Catherine
Deneuve, and George Chakiris) musicalize their search for love. Jacques Demy's film is non at the Surf.
In that it would be all but
impossible for any one person to
cover the San Francisco Film
Festival (especially for a student
an hour's drive away), I will

resources poured into such
abominations as Star had been

available to Demy, he probably
would have had a great picture.
There are more than enough
reasons to see the film, not the
least of which is Francoise
Dorleac, who, though tragically
killed shortly after finishing this
picture, remains one of the '60's
most fascinating females. It's also
nice to see her sister, Catherine

with some spunk, in light of her

JOIE DE VIVRE—The cast of "The Young Girls of Rochefort" (I. to r. Grover Dale, Francoise Dorleac, Catherine
Deneuve, and George Chakiris) musicalize their search for love. Jacques Demy's film is non at the Surf.
In that it would be all but
impossible for any one person to
cover the San Francisco Film
Festival (especially for a student
an hour's drive away), I will
refrain from making any
generalizations about the standard
of excellence maintained over the
festival's ten days.
Perhaps the festival could have
used one or two more outright
hits (only Z and Ma Nuit Chez
Maud thoroughly impressed me),
and in retrospect, a greater
emphasis might be placed on
older, more experienced artists,
rather than the likes of Widerberg,
John Schlesinger, Mike Nichols,
and Milos Forman, who, while
talented and interesting, have
relatively limited filmographies.
The quality of the pre-feature
shorts was distressing, as only
Ryan Larkin's animated Walking
demonstrated an unusual creative
talent at work.
This said, let's get on to the
films.
Z: As I pointed out last week,
political and "thriller" elements
are combined here to create a
work which is relevant both as
social commentary and as
entertainment.
Barters to Bourgeois?
The mere fact that Z is popular
with audiences has caused some
European radicals to denounce
the film as catering to bourgeois
sentiments, but such a stand is
just as fallacious as praising a
Samuel Fuller film simply because
it has not been widely seen.
A major reason for Z's success
is that, rather than indulging in
sloganeering and cheap plays for
sympathy, the causes and
intricacies of the murder of an
opposition leader are brought into
focus as much as factual evidence
permits. We are properly but
superficially outraged by the
right-wingers' conduct at the
beginning, but as the case is
opened up, we discover, at the
same time the investigator does,
the appalling circumstances
surrounding the "accidental"
death.
Our hostility toward the fascist
government grows quickly and,
for once, actually becomes

reinforced and irrevocably based
in fact. Perhaps Z reaches the
ultimate in manipulative cinema,
but it is too honest and, simply,
too engrossing to be slighted even
for that reason.
Lions Love: This picture, along
with comments made by Mike
Nichols and Bette Davis, merely
reinforces the idea that people,
not technology or social
importance, are what make
movies vital and enjoyable. When
Agnes Varda points her camera at
Viva!, Ragin and Rado, who are
very pleasant people to spend
time with and who let loose with
some wonderful non sequiturs and
puns, the film is very nice indeed.
Charm Fades
However, when we are faced
with Shriley Clarke's problems in
making a film and the
"importance" of the Kennedy and
Warhol shootings, the film's
charm is lost among the harsh
sounds and images of a television
set. All along, it had been the
charm and relative obliviousness
of the principals which had given
Lions Love life. As a footnote,
Viva! may be potentially one of
the best comidiennes currently
working in a comedically bleak
cinema.
The Boi'ors Gun: This film is
unusual for a festival in that it is
given stature only by the actors,
but even in this light, the film is
disappointing. It is a case of actors
working with a conviction beyond
that demonstrated by the script.
With the unlikely setting of a
British army outpost in post-war
Germany, the drama seems so
trivial that even the label of an
"actors' showcase" amounts to
excessive praise. Fortunately,
David Warner and, even moreso,
Nicol Williamson, are strong
forces on any screen and it is
reasonably intriguing to watch
them dig for character motivation
where it simply does not exist.
Ma Nuit Chez Maud: This third
installment in director Eric
Rohmer's sextet on modern ethics
must be seen and especially heard
to be comprehended. The mere
concept of it (two hours of
talk—and a little plot—concerning
Catholicism, morals and
contemporary life) may put off

those with so-call "cinematic"
sensibilities.
What Talk!
But what talk! A teasing sexual
undercurrent runs throughout the
characters' fascinating
conversations and the fateful
moment of amorous decision
between the staunch Catholic and
the more open-minded Maud is a
hilariously yet bitingly accurate
reflection of the relationship of
men and women in modern
society.
While many recent films and
plays have dramatized our
hangups, self-destruction and
devices for emotional
self-protection, none have done so
with quite the maturity and
intellectual integrity of Ma Nuit
Chez Maud.
Sympathy for the Devil: It
seems futile to try to determine
where Jean-Luc Godard is at on
the basis of this film. Godard, the
most intellectual of directors,
seems here to be severely
questioning his role as a
film-maker and, indeed, whether
he should be making films at all.
He is considerably disturbed by
the concept of the "intellectual
revolutionary," for to be a
revolutionary, the director insists
that one must give up being an
intellectual.
In the film's extraordinary final
shot, Godard himself "kills"
actress-wife Anne Wiazemski, has
her placed on the end of a camera
crane, and photographs the
ascendence of the crane with its
abandoned camera and bloody
dead body.
This may signify many things
or nothing at all, but indicated to
me Godard's belief in the
incompatibility of meaningful
action (revolution) and the
cinema. Yet the fact that Godard
is expressing his views through the
film medium results in an
incredible paradox and reveals
that Godard has not resolved the
issues in his own mind.
Another paradox is that
Godard is both the most
self-consciously stylized and most
realistic director working in the
cinema. Yet another is that, after
directing several films, Godard
decided that the most important

element in the shaping of a
picture is determining the proper
length for individual shots and
scenes, but in this film, he seems
totally oblivious to the demands
of pacing, and has all but
abandoned a concept of structure
in his works.
Intriguing Issue
The most intriguing issue of all
is that under ordinary
circumstances, consideration of a
given film should come before
consideration of the director, but
Godard is reaching the point
where an awareness of his
previous work and idiosyncracies
is virtually required in order to
even put up with his newest
releases.
As it is, Sympathy For The
Devil is somewhat tedious,
intellectually frustrating, but
necessarily fascination to anyone
concerned about where the
cinema is headed.

Currently at the Surf theater,
on a double bill with Truffaut's
Stolen Kisses is Jacques Demy's
musical, The Young Girls of
Rochefort. Finally arriving in San
Francisco after nearly two years,
the film has the curious
distinction among musicals of
actually being under-produced.

Demy, who made the
Umbrellas of Cherbourg,
obviously loves the genre, and the
fact that we sense his passion and

self-consciously stylized and most
realistic director working in the
cinema. Yet another is that, after
directing several films, Godard
decided that the most important

element in the shaping of a
picture is determining the proper
length for individual shots and
scenes, but in this film, he seems
totally oblivious to the demands
of pacing, and has all but
abandoned a concept of structure
in his works.
Intriguing Issue
The most intriguing issue of all
is that under ordinary

Godard is reaching the point
where an awareness of his
previous work and idiosyncracies

Currently at the Surf theater,
on a double bill with Truffaut's
Stolen Kisses is Jacques Demy's
musical, The Young Girls of
Rochefort. Finally arriving in San
Francisco after nearly two years,
the film has the curious
distinction among musicals of
actually being under-produced.

Demy, who made the
Umbrellas of Cherbourg,
obviously loves the genre, and the
fact that we sense his passion and
know he is trying as hard as he
can makes up for certain
inadequacies, most of which can
be attributed to financial
depravation. If just one-tenth the
resources poured into such
abominations as Star had been

available to Demy, he probably
would have had a great picture.
There are more than enough
reasons to see the film, not the
least of which is Francoise
Dorleac, who, though tragically
killed shortly after finishing this
picture, remains one of the '60's
most fascinating females. It's also
nice to see her sister, Catherine
Deneuve, smile and move around

with some spunk, in light of her
recent porcelain performances.
The presence of Gene Kelly in this
French language musical merely
brings into focus Demy's love
affair with Hollywood at its
musical best. However, few
Hollywood musicals could ever
boast better scores than Michel
Legrand's for The Young Girls of
Rochefort. It's brilliant.


JOIE DE VIVRE—The cast of "The Young Girls of Rochefort" (I. to r. Grover Dale, Francoise Dorleac, Catherine
Deneuve, and George Chakiris) musicalize their search for love. Jacques Demy's film is non at the Surf.
In that it would be all but
impossible for any one person to
cover the San Francisco Film
Festival (especially for a student
an hour's drive away), I will
refrain from making any
generalizations about the standard
of excellence maintained over the
festival's ten days.
Perhaps the festival could have
used one or two more outright
hits (only Z and Ma Nuit Chez
Maud thoroughly impressed me),
and in retrospect, a greater
emphasis might be placed on
older, more experienced artists,
rather than the likes of Widerberg,
John Schlesinger, Mike Nichols,
and Milos Forman, who, while
talented and interesting, have
relatively limited filmographies.
The quality of the pre-feature
shorts was distressing, as only
Ryan Larkin's animated Walking
demonstrated an unusual creative
talent at work.
This said, let's get on to the
films.
Z: As I pointed out last week,
political and "thriller" elements
are combined here to create a
work which is relevant both as
social commentary and as
entertainment.
Barters to Bourgeois?
The mere fact that Z is popular
with audiences has caused some
European radicals to denounce
the film as catering to bourgeois
sentiments, but such a stand is
just as fallacious as praising a
Samuel Fuller film simply because
it has not been widely seen.
A major reason for Z's success
is that, rather than indulging in
sloganeering and cheap plays for
sympathy, the causes and
intricacies of the murder of an
opposition leader are brought into
focus as much as factual evidence
permits. We are properly but
superficially outraged by the
right-wingers' conduct at the
beginning, but as the case is
opened up, we discover, at the
same time the investigator does,
the appalling circumstances
surrounding the "accidental"
death.
Our hostility toward the fascist
government grows quickly and,
for once, actually becomes

reinforced and irrevocably based
in fact. Perhaps Z reaches the
ultimate in manipulative cinema,
but it is too honest and, simply,
too engrossing to be slighted even
for that reason.
Lions Love: This picture, along
with comments made by Mike
Nichols and Bette Davis, merely
reinforces the idea that people,
not technology or social
importance, are what make
movies vital and enjoyable. When
Agnes Varda points her camera at
Viva!, Ragin and Rado, who are
very pleasant people to spend
time with and who let loose with
some wonderful non sequiturs and
puns, the film is very nice indeed.
Charm Fades
However, when we are faced
with Shriley Clarke's problems in
making a film and the
"importance" of the Kennedy and
Warhol shootings, the film's
charm is lost among the harsh
sounds and images of a television
set. All along, it had been the
charm and relative obliviousness
of the principals which had given
Lions Love life. As a footnote,
Viva! may be potentially one of
the best comidiennes currently
working in a comedically bleak
cinema.
The Boi'ors Gun: This film is
unusual for a festival in that it is
given stature only by the actors,
but even in this light, the film is
disappointing. It is a case of actors
working with a conviction beyond
that demonstrated by the script.
With the unlikely setting of a
British army outpost in post-war
Germany, the drama seems so
trivial that even the label of an
"actors' showcase" amounts to
excessive praise. Fortunately,
David Warner and, even moreso,
Nicol Williamson, are strong
forces on any screen and it is
reasonably intriguing to watch
them dig for character motivation
where it simply does not exist.
Ma Nuit Chez Maud: This third
installment in director Eric
Rohmer's sextet on modern ethics
must be seen and especially heard
to be comprehended. The mere
concept of it (two hours of
talk—and a little plot—concerning
Catholicism, morals and
contemporary life) may put off

those with so-call "cinematic"
sensibilities.
What Talk!
But what talk! A teasing sexual
undercurrent runs throughout the
characters' fascinating
conversations and the fateful
moment of amorous decision
between the staunch Catholic and
the more open-minded Maud is a
hilariously yet bitingly accurate
reflection of the relationship of
men and women in modern
society.
While many recent films and
plays have dramatized our
hangups, self-destruction and
devices for emotional
self-protection, none have done so
with quite the maturity and
intellectual integrity of Ma Nuit
Chez Maud.
Sympathy for the Devil: It
seems futile to try to determine
where Jean-Luc Godard is at on
the basis of this film. Godard, the
most intellectual of directors,
seems here to be severely
questioning his role as a
film-maker and, indeed, whether
he should be making films at all.
He is considerably disturbed by
the concept of the "intellectual
revolutionary," for to be a
revolutionary, the director insists
that one must give up being an
intellectual.
In the film's extraordinary final
shot, Godard himself "kills"
actress-wife Anne Wiazemski, has
her placed on the end of a camera
crane, and photographs the
ascendence of the crane with its
abandoned camera and bloody
dead body.
This may signify many things
or nothing at all, but indicated to
me Godard's belief in the
incompatibility of meaningful
action (revolution) and the
cinema. Yet the fact that Godard
is expressing his views through the
film medium results in an
incredible paradox and reveals
that Godard has not resolved the
issues in his own mind.
Another paradox is that
Godard is both the most
self-consciously stylized and most
realistic director working in the
cinema. Yet another is that, after

self-protection, none have done so
with quite the maturity and
intellectual integrity of Ma Nuit
Chez Maud.
Sympathy for the Devil: It
seems futile to try to determine
where Jean-Luc Godard is at on
the basis of this film. Godard, the
most intellectual of directors,
seems here to be severely
questioning his role as a
film-maker and, indeed, whether
he should be making films at all.
He is considerably disturbed by
the concept of the "intellectual
revolutionary," for to be a
revolutionary, the director insists
that one must give up being an
intellectual.
In the film's extraordinary final
shot, Godard himself "kills"
actress-wife Anne Wiazemski, has
her placed on the end of a camera
crane, and photographs the
ascendence of the crane with its
abandoned camera and bloody
dead body.
This may signify many things
or nothing at all, but indicated to
me Godard's belief in the
incompatibility of meaningful
action (revolution) and the
cinema. Yet the fact that Godard
is expressing his views through the
film medium results in an
incredible paradox and reveals
that Godard has not resolved the
issues in his own mind.
Another paradox is that
Godard is both the most
self-consciously stylized and most
realistic director working in the
cinema. Yet another is that, after
directing several films, Godard
decided that the most important

element in the shaping of a
picture is determining the proper
length for individual shots and
scenes, but in this film, he seems
totally oblivious to the demands
of pacing, and has all but
abandoned a concept of structure
in his works.
Intriguing Issue
The most intriguing issue of all
is that under ordinary
circumstances, consideration of a
given film should come before
consideration of the director, but
Godard is reaching the point
where an awareness of his
previous work and idiosyncracies
is virtually required in order to
even put up with his newest
releases.
As it is, Sympathy For The
Devil is somewhat tedious,
intellectually frustrating, but
necessarily fascination to anyone
concerned about where the
cinema is headed.

Currently at the Surf theater,
on a double bill with Truffaut's
Stolen Kisses is Jacques Demy's
musical, The Young Girls of
Rochefort. Finally arriving in San
Francisco after nearly two years,
the film has the curious
distinction among musicals of
actually being under-produced.

Demy, who made the
Umbrellas of Cherbourg,
obviously loves the genre, and the
fact that we sense his passion and
know he is trying as hard as he
can makes up for certain
inadequacies, most of which can
be attributed to financial
depravation. If just one-tenth the
resources poured into such
abominations as Star had been

available to Demy, he probably
would have had a great picture.
There are more than enough
reasons to see the film, not the
least of which is Francoise
Dorleac, who, though tragically
killed shortly after finishing this
picture, remains one of the '60's
most fascinating females. It's also
nice to see her sister, Catherine
Deneuve, smile and move around

with some spunk, in light of her
recent porcelain performances.
The presence of Gene Kelly in this
French language musical merely
brings into focus Demy's love
affair with Hollywood at its
musical best. However, few
Hollywood musicals could ever
boast better scores than Michel
Legrand's for The Young Girls of
Rochefort. It's brilliant.


JOIE DE VIVRE—The cast of "The Young Girls of Rochefort" (I. to r. Grover Dale, Francoise Dorleac, Catherine
Deneuve, and George Chakiris) musicalize their search for love. Jacques Demy's film is non at the Surf.
In that it would be all but
impossible for any one person to
cover the San Francisco Film
Festival (especially for a student
an hour's drive away), I will
refrain from making any
generalizations about the standard
of excellence maintained over the
festival's ten days.
Perhaps the festival could have
used one or two more outright
hits (only Z and Ma Nuit Chez
Maud thoroughly impressed me),
and in retrospect, a greater
emphasis might be placed on
older, more experienced artists,
rather than the likes of Widerberg,
John Schlesinger, Mike Nichols,
and Milos Forman, who, while
talented and interesting, have
relatively limited filmographies.
The quality of the pre-feature
shorts was distressing, as only
Ryan Larkin's animated Walking
demonstrated an unusual creative
talent at work.
This said, let's get on to the
films.
Z: As I pointed out last week,
political and "thriller" elements
are combined here to create a
work which is relevant both as
social commentary and as
entertainment.
Barters to Bourgeois?
The mere fact that Z is popular
with audiences has caused some
European radicals to denounce
the film as catering to bourgeois
sentiments, but such a stand is
just as fallacious as praising a
Samuel Fuller film simply because
it has not been widely seen.
A major reason for Z's success
is that, rather than indulging in
sloganeering and cheap plays for
sympathy, the causes and
intricacies of the murder of an
opposition leader are brought into
focus as much as factual evidence
permits. We are properly but
superficially outraged by the
right-wingers' conduct at the
beginning, but as the case is
opened up, we discover, at the
same time the investigator does,
the appalling circumstances
surrounding the "accidental"
death.
Our hostility toward the fascist
government grows quickly and,
for once, actually becomes

reinforced and irrevocably based
in fact. Perhaps Z reaches the
ultimate in manipulative cinema,
but it is too honest and, simply,
too engrossing to be slighted even
for that reason.
Lions Love: This picture, along
with comments made by Mike
Nichols and Bette Davis, merely
reinforces the idea that people,
not technology or social
importance, are what make
movies vital and enjoyable. When
Agnes Varda points her camera at
Viva!, Ragin and Rado, who are
very pleasant people to spend
time with and who let loose with
some wonderful non sequiturs and
puns, the film is very nice indeed.
Charm Fades
However, when we are faced
with Shriley Clarke's problems in
making a film and the
"importance" of the Kennedy and
Warhol shootings, the film's
charm is lost among the harsh
sounds and images of a television
set. All along, it had been the
charm and relative obliviousness
of the principals which had given
Lions Love life. As a footnote,
Viva! may be potentially one of
the best comidiennes currently
working in a comedically bleak
cinema.
The Boi'ors Gun: This film is
unusual for a festival in that it is
given stature only by the actors,
but even in this light, the film is
disappointing. It is a case of actors
working with a conviction beyond
that demonstrated by the script.
With the unlikely setting of a
British army outpost in post-war
Germany, the drama seems so
trivial that even the label of an
"actors' showcase" amounts to
excessive praise. Fortunately,
David Warner and, even moreso,
Nicol Williamson, are strong
forces on any screen and it is
reasonably intriguing to watch
them dig for character motivation
where it simply does not exist.
Ma Nuit Chez Maud: This third
installment in director Eric
Rohmer's sextet on modern ethics
must be seen and especially heard
to be comprehended. The mere
concept of it (two hours of
talk—and a little plot—concerning
Catholicism, morals and
contemporary life) may put off

those with so-call "cinematic"
sensibilities.
What Talk!
But what talk! A teasing sexual
undercurrent runs throughout the
characters' fascinating
conversations and the fateful
moment of amorous decision
between the staunch Catholic and
the more open-minded Maud is a
hilariously yet bitingly accurate
reflection of the relationship of
men and women in modern
society.
While many recent films and
plays have dramatized our
hangups, self-destruction and
devices for emotional
self-protection, none have done so
with quite the maturity and
intellectual integrity of Ma Nuit
Chez Maud.
Sympathy for the Devil: It
