opportunity to be free to be
political and to participate in the

University." The measure passed

Edwards to the rules, by-laws, and
finance committees.
Edwards Appointments
Some Senate members
protested that Edwards had no
right to appoint members, and
instead the right to constitute the
committees lay with the Senate
itself. "The size of the Senate was
reduced so that we could take the
time to decide these questions,"
declared Patrick C. Shea. Other
members felt the appointments
were arbitrary and not approved
by vote of the Senate.
Chairman Edwards pointed out,
"The Senate always had the

power to decide and always will
make the decision on the
committees' decisions." He
stressed the important roles of
each of the committees and the
urgent matters that lie ahead lor
each such as relations with the
Academic Senate and the ASSU
budget.
A resolution preventing
Edwards from making the
committee appointments was
defeated 16 to 14.
Three Committees
The rules committee decides on
each meeting's agenda, wording of
proposals, and relations with the
faculty Senate. The finance
committee consults with the
student financial manager and
makes recommendations on the
ASSU budget. The by-laws
committee is charged with
studying the ASSU constitution
and suggesting changes.
The Senate also moved to set
up a Liaison Committee to
maintain communications with
the general student body.
Selection of a Committee on
Nominations was postponed until
next Tuesday.
All students nominated to the
committees on Land and
Development, Undergraduate
Studies, and the search committee
for a Dean of Undergraduate
Studies were approved by
acclamation.

A substitute motion with more
moderate language narrowly was
defeated by a 15 to 11 margin.
The full text of the lengthy

approved resolution will be
printed in Monday's Daily .
Most of the meeting was taken
up by appointments of Senate
members by Chairman Dave
Edwards to the rules, by-laws, and
finance committees.
Edwards Appointments
Some Senate members
protested that Edwards had no
right to appoint members, and
instead the right to constitute the
committees lay with the Senate
itself. "The size of the Senate was
reduced so that we could take the
time to decide these questions,"
declared Patrick C. Shea. Other
members felt the appointments
were arbitrary and not approved
by vote of the Senate.
Chairman Edwards pointed out,
"The Senate always had the

power to decide and always will
make the decision on the
committees' decisions." He
stressed the important roles of
each of the committees and the
urgent matters that lie ahead lor
each such as relations with the
Academic Senate and the ASSU
budget.
A resolution preventing
Edwards from making the
committee appointments was
defeated 16 to 14.
Three Committees
The rules committee decides on
each meeting's agenda, wording of
proposals, and relations with the
faculty Senate. The finance
committee consults with the
student financial manager and
makes recommendations on the
ASSU budget. The by-laws
committee is charged with
studying the ASSU constitution
and suggesting changes.
The Senate also moved to set
up a Liaison Committee to
maintain communications with
the general student body.
Selection of a Committee on
Nominations was postponed until
next Tuesday.
All students nominated to the
committees on Land and
Development, Undergraduate
Studies, and the search committee
for a Dean of Undergraduate
Studies were approved by
acclamation.
