# The 						Classical Groove: Verdi
## Voices, Melody Vitalize Opera 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
With this year's production of
La Forza del Destino (The Force
of Destiny) the S.F. Opera shot
off a fusillade of booming Verdian
vocalism the likes of which have
not been heard at the Opera
House in recent years.
The quality of the voices was so
spectacular, in fact, that the
lame-brained plot, rather primitive
acting, and boorish scenery were
all, in the balance, outweighed.
No one, I suppose, who knows
about Verdi's Middle-Period
operas goes to one looking for
high drama or even sublime

musical sophistication. The plot
groans with age: Leonora comes
home with a prince whose mother
was of Incan blood; her Spaniard
father—this not being the
enlightened age of "Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner"—rejects the
marriage; the prince shoots the
old man; Leonora's brother swears
vengeance. The rest, as Hector
Berlioz wrote in another context,
is very etc., etc.
Verdi and his accomplice add
to this plot some very heavy,
musty Catholicism (both lovers
flee to monasteries) and some
trashy comic relief in the form of
a one-woman Selective Service
system, a boob in monk's habit,
and a bricabrac peddler.
Verdi's score, too, offers little
in the way of structure and depth.
The set-piece arias tend to be
one-dimensional (i.e., a vengeance
aria), and the rhythms and
orchestration verge on the
pedestrian.
Melody Conquers
So far, so bad; what could
possibly redeem all this? The
answer is Verdi's invigorating
melody. If nothing else in the
opera seems very much alive,
Verdi's melodies certainly are.
They give the opera a curiously
pulsating vitality, and when they
are sung as beautifully as they
were last night—well, all cavilling
about other matters palls in
significance. Like good, hearty
chianti, the music of Forza may
not do much for the mind; but,
God, it does quicken the spirit.
The main interest of this year's
Forza is the debut of Italian tenor
Carlo Bergonzi, reputedly one of
the greatest active singers in the
Italian romantic repertory. Little
mystery was involved, since the

quality of his voice is well-known
through recordings. The only
anxiety was over whether
Bergonzi would measure up in
person. He most assuredly did.
There may be larger tenor
voices in the world, but certainly
none so consistently smooth and
so nicely infused with emotion.
There was not the faintest hint of
a rough edge or a failure of nerve
the entire evening. In the upper
register he is a paradigm of
suppleness, and unlike so many
tenors, he knows what to do with
a high C once he has hit it.
Mr. Bergonzi acts like —well,
like the world's greatest tenor. He
seemed to be watching the
beautiful tones coming out of his
mouth most of the evening. I
assume his usual Italian
actually go to
hear an opera rather than see
it—have not encouraged him to
improve his stage presence, since
his vocal presence is so potent.
A Great Baritone
Swedish baritone Ingvar Wixell,
as Leonora's vengeance-obsessed
brother, accomplished some
strange feats: he stole the opera
from Mr. Bergonzi; he acted quite
credibly; and he caused me to
search in memory for a more
satisfying and capacious baritone
performance.
The search was in vain. Since
his debut as Rossini's Figaro a few
years ago, Wixell has developed an
enviable ease on stage, and his
voice has grown immensely—as
has the intelligence behind it.
Wixell is tottering precariously on
the edge of greatness, if indeed he
didn't take the plunge last night.
The debut of American Nancy
Tatum introduced a very knowing
a capable Verdian

soprano that is, a voice which is
powerful, agile, and yet inspired
at its core with a soft,
warmblooded romanticism.
Sizeable Singer
American critics have
oh-so-slyly remarked upon Miss
Tatum's large physique. Such
comments are not so much rude
as they are meretricious: Tatum
has had a great career in Europe,
where audiences are, first of all,
interested in how well a singer (of
all things!) sings. They realize that
one gets more woof from a 15"
woofer than a 4" one and that
perhaps the same idea applies to
voice production. To descend
from the husting, Tatum sang a
big and very enjoyable Leonora.
Giorgio Tozzi sings two
operatic roles especially well:
Mozart's profligate Don Juan and
Padre Guardiano of Forza. This
implies Tozzi is either a latent
schizophrenic or is simply quite
versatile—l trust the latter. As
usual, he boomed his basso off the
rafters in fine style.
Poor Renato Capecchi! The
great comedian had his one aria
cut, and hence had to pack all his
funny ideas into a few brief
walk-ons. He was so clever,
though, that he threw into painful
relief the relatively turgid acting
of the rest of the cast.
Sylvia Anderson unfortunately
did not present the necessary
coloratura agility to make
Preziosilla's digressions from the
plot worthwhile or enjoyable.
Giuseppe Patane turned in
another amiable conducting
assignment.
(FORZA will be repeated on
November 7, 9, and 12).
