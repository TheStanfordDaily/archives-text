# Among The Best In Britain
## Fleetwood Mac Offers Pure Blues 
### CRAIG OKINO 
Ask anyone with a knowledge
of British blues which of John
MayaH's Biuesbreakers was the
best, and chances are he'd say the
"Hard Road" band, consisting of
Mayall, quitarist Peter Green,
bassist John McVie, and drummer
Anysley Dunbar. Green replaced
the legendary Eric Clapton, who
left the band for "new
directions," eventually leading to
Cream and Blind Faith.
As Mayall stated on the Hard
Road liner notes, comparisons
between the two guitarists are
inevitable. I hate to disappoint all
the hardened Clapton
worshippers, but Peter Green,
although not as notorious, is the
better blues guitarist. Clapton was
more inventive than Green, and a
hit faster, but his solos tended to
be of identical tone—different
tempos, perhaps, but of the same
harsh, biting, stuttering quality.
Green can do this just as well, but
he can also get off some sweet,
flowing, melodic blues runs, in the
style of 8.8. King.
As is usually the case with a
Mayall guitarist, Green left the
band (in mid-1967) to form his
own group. He took John McVie
with him, and was joined by
drummer Mick Fleetwood (who

was also briefly with Mayall), and
slide-guitarist Jeremy Spencer.
Strictly Blues
But where Clapton's Cream
explored the blues-rock idiom,
Green's group (called Fleetwood
Mac, formed from the names of
the drummer and bassist),
puritans all, stuck strictly to the
blues for their first album. The
music was solid, moving, but very
derivative.
However, between their first
and second American albums,
Danny Kirwan, a 19-year old
guitarist formerly with the
unsuccessful Boiler House, joined
the group. Kirwan, though not as
matured a guitarist as Green,
played in much the same style.
Fleetwood Mac showed
tremendous potential now with
three lead guitarists, but their
second album was very patchy—it
had four of Green's songs, four of
Kirwan's songs, and four of
Spencer's songs, but none by all
of them.
Green and Kirwan are excellent
composers, but Spencer cannot
rid himself of his fascination with
the Elmore James "Dust My
Broom" riff, and all his songs
show this. While the other two
were expanding on the blues with
pieces like Green's "Albatross" or

Kirwan's "Jigsaw Puzzle Blues,"
Spencer remained in his slide
guitar bag.
'Then Play On'
Fortunately, all of Fleetwood
Mac's major problems have been
resolved in their just-released LP,
Then Play On (Reprise 6368). The
album is a beautiful cohesive
work, one song flowing into
another, and Jeremy Spencer is
nowhere to be found (except on
Green's "Show-Biz Blues"). The
album contains some fierce
blues—a long jam entitled
"Fighting/Searching for Madge,"
and some flowing stuff
(reminiscent of the guitar lines on
Hendrix' "Little Wing") which
cannot be classified as blues or
rock.
The entire album is pervaded
by something unusual for a British
group: a lack of ego-tripping on
the part of the musicians. There is
no fuzz tone triple speed guitar a
la Alvin Lee, no screaming, throat
killing vocals a la Robert Plant.
The volume controls are set at
medium the majority of the time.
Green's and Kirwan's guitars
complement each other perfectly,
building together, or providing
backing for their excellent vocals.
Fleetwood Mac's entire focus is
on subtlety and restraint. McVie's
bass lines are solid and

uncluttered, and Mick
Fleetwood's drumming is simple
but direct. His drums are absent
from a few cuts, and on the softer
songs he makes good use of
cymbals and mallets.

Not everyone will like
Fleetwood Mac, but it is one of
the best bands in Britain, and its
members have done it with a
minimun of fanfare and hype. All
they do is play.

tremendous potential now with
three lead guitarists, but their
second album was very patchy—it
had four of Green's songs, four of
Kirwan's songs, and four of
Spencer's songs, but none by all
of them.
Green and Kirwan are excellent
composers, but Spencer cannot
rid himself of his fascination with
the Elmore James "Dust My
Broom" riff, and all his songs
show this. While the other two
were expanding on the blues with
pieces like Green's "Albatross" or

Kirwan's "Jigsaw Puzzle Blues,"
Spencer remained in his slide
guitar bag.
'Then Play On'
Fortunately, all of Fleetwood
Mac's major problems have been
resolved in their just-released LP,
Then Play On (Reprise 6368). The
album is a beautiful cohesive
work, one song flowing into
another, and Jeremy Spencer is
nowhere to be found (except on
Green's "Show-Biz Blues"). The
album contains some fierce
blues—a long jam entitled
"Fighting/Searching for Madge,"
and some flowing stuff
(reminiscent of the guitar lines on
Hendrix' "Little Wing") which
cannot be classified as blues or
rock.
The entire album is pervaded
by something unusual for a British
group: a lack of ego-tripping on
the part of the musicians. There is
no fuzz tone triple speed guitar a
la Alvin Lee, no screaming, throat
killing vocals a la Robert Plant.
The volume controls are set at
medium the majority of the time.
Green's and Kirwan's guitars
complement each other perfectly,
building together, or providing
backing for their excellent vocals.
Fleetwood Mac's entire focus is
on subtlety and restraint. McVie's
bass lines are solid and

uncluttered, and Mick
Fleetwood's drumming is simple
but direct. His drums are absent
from a few cuts, and on the softer
songs he makes good use of
cymbals and mallets.

Not everyone will like
Fleetwood Mac, but it is one of
the best bands in Britain, and its
members have done it with a
minimun of fanfare and hype. All

BLUESY BOYS—Fleetwood Mac, a group puritaiicial about sticking to blues, let
loose on their third album, "Then Play On," a cohesive, fierce work.
Ask anyone with a knowledge
of British blues which of John
MayaH's Biuesbreakers was the
best, and chances are he'd say the
"Hard Road" band, consisting of
Mayall, quitarist Peter Green,
bassist John McVie, and drummer
Anysley Dunbar. Green replaced
the legendary Eric Clapton, who
left the band for "new
directions," eventually leading to
Cream and Blind Faith.
As Mayall stated on the Hard
Road liner notes, comparisons
between the two guitarists are
inevitable. I hate to disappoint all
the hardened Clapton
worshippers, but Peter Green,
although not as notorious, is the
better blues guitarist. Clapton was
more inventive than Green, and a
hit faster, but his solos tended to
be of identical tone—different
tempos, perhaps, but of the same
harsh, biting, stuttering quality.
Green can do this just as well, but
he can also get off some sweet,
flowing, melodic blues runs, in the
style of 8.8. King.
As is usually the case with a
Mayall guitarist, Green left the
band (in mid-1967) to form his
own group. He took John McVie
with him, and was joined by
drummer Mick Fleetwood (who

was also briefly with Mayall), and
slide-guitarist Jeremy Spencer.
Strictly Blues
But where Clapton's Cream
explored the blues-rock idiom,
Green's group (called Fleetwood
Mac, formed from the names of
the drummer and bassist),
puritans all, stuck strictly to the
blues for their first album. The
music was solid, moving, but very
derivative.
However, between their first
and second American albums,
Danny Kirwan, a 19-year old
guitarist formerly with the
unsuccessful Boiler House, joined
the group. Kirwan, though not as
matured a guitarist as Green,
played in much the same style.
Fleetwood Mac showed
tremendous potential now with
three lead guitarists, but their
second album was very patchy—it
had four of Green's songs, four of
Kirwan's songs, and four of
Spencer's songs, but none by all
of them.
Green and Kirwan are excellent
composers, but Spencer cannot
rid himself of his fascination with
the Elmore James "Dust My
