# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Choose Your Music 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
What to do this weekend?
Several excellent opportunities to
enjoy some good music are
available, in town, on campus and
in San Francisco.
Bobby Stevens of the
Checkmates Ltd., has opened a
club in East Palo Alto with his
brothers. Called the Checkmate
Inn, the club plans to book top
talent, including Aretha Franklin,
Dionne Warwick and Re
Checkmates Ltd., who wrote and
recorded the song "Black Girl"
and who has cut an LP for Phil
Spector.
This weekend, Phil Flowers will
be playing. The Inn is a
membership club, but there are no
"restrictions" (except minors). No
cover charge for members, no
drink minimum—lifetime
membership is $50. Go out and
visit them this weekend at 1605
Bay Road, tell them you read
about their club in the Daily, and
they'll give you and your guest a
free pass. There is no obligation to
join, of course. Actually,
membership would not be very
economical for most
undergraduates, but tenured
faculty and Physics grad students
might be interested. Perhaps they
can arrange group membership for
living groups.
Tonight and Saturday at the
Masonic in the City, John
Kornfeld is presenting two superb
musical productions. Tonight at
8:30, the Romanian Madrigal
makes their West Coast debut
after having been an overshelming
success in Now York. They
perform Medieval and Renaissance
vocal music, in a manner much
like the New York Pro Musica—in
16th century costume, as if they
were performing for royalty.
Their appearance here has not
been as well-publicized as it
should have been, for this
promises to be an exciting
evening.
Van Cliburn
Saturday night, Van Cliburn
takes the Masonic stage for a
concert of solo piano music,
feturing Chopin and
Tchaikowsky. After winning the
Tchaikowsky Prize in Moscow
several years ago, Cliburn became
one of the top recording stars in
the country. It was he who
brought classical music into the
homes of millions of Americans
with excellent recording of
Chopin, Beethoven and Liszt. His

concert this Saturday in the City
will no doubt be an extremely
popular one, so I would suggest
you reserve tickets soon (available
through the Ticketron agency in
Mem Aud).
One note on productions by
John Kornfeld: if you call them in
the City at 781-7833, and tell
them you are a diligent and
hard-working Stanford student,
they'll leave a "Rush" ticket at
the box office for you—which
means you can get in for
half-price. Any seat in the house
which is unsold half an hour or so
before curtain is yours at a 50%
discount. Be sure to bring your
student body card, and be sure to
call ahead of time. Van Cliburn
may be sold out, however, so you
had better check on it right away.
If you don't like leaving the
campus, the Stanford Music
Department invites you to a free
concert this Sunday afternoon at
3 pm in Dinkelspiel. Sandor Salgo
and the Stanford Chamber
Orchestra open the program with
Bach's "Brandenburg Concerto
No. 2"; the Stanford Chorale,
under the direction of Harold
Schmidt, will present a group of
Renaissance madrigals; and
violinist Kenneth Goldsmith and
pianist Anthony Doheny will
perform two Mozart Sonatas.
Finally, if you just feel like not
going anywhere tonight, but
you'd like to relax, go to Mem
Chu at 8 p.m. Samuel Swartz,
assistant and pupil of University
Organist Herbert Nanney, will
present a recital of early and
modern organ works. We have an
excellent organ in the Church, and
the acoustics are just right for
Bach and Buxtehude. The recital
is, of course, free.
Oakland Symphony
The Oakland Symphony's
second concert this season, next
Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, November 11, 12 and
13, promises to be as exciting and
unconventional as its first, in
which Maestro Gerhard Samuel
presented the West Coast
Orchestral Premiere of Terry
Riley's "In C." Five pieces will be
performed by the orchestra; three
are standard concert are, but the
two others are not.
Opening the concerts will be
Mozart's "Overture to the Magic
Flute," a lovely, sensitive piece,
followed by Bartok's "Violin
Concerto No. 2" with Israeli
violinist Ivry Gitlis in his second

appearance with the Oakland
Symphony. Also on the program
is Ravel's "Daphis and Chloe Suite
No. 2," originally composed for
the Ballet Russe.
The concert will also include
two works which have just
recently appeared. The first is a
newly discovered movement to
Mahler's "Symphony No. 1," a
movement which Mahler's
publisher rejected.
Then, Maestro Samuel again
challenges timid minds with Larry
Austin's new piece, "Catharsis:
Open Style for Two Improvisiz
Ensembles, Tapes and
Conductor." This will be the
work's West Coast premiere (it
was first performed in 1968). It
shuns conventional music
notation for the use of an
"Instruction Sheet" to each
player) the orchestra, the
composer-performer, and solo
pianist Robert Floyd will be
guided through the adventurous
piece by the conductor. It should
be another interesting experiment.

are standard concert are, but the
two others are not.
Opening the concerts will be
Mozart's "Overture to the Magic
Flute," a lovely, sensitive piece,
followed by Bartok's "Violin
Concerto No. 2" with Israeli
violinist Ivry Gitlis in his second

appearance with the Oakland
Symphony. Also on the program
is Ravel's "Daphis and Chloe Suite
No. 2," originally composed for
the Ballet Russe.
The concert will also include
two works which have just
recently appeared. The first is a
newly discovered movement to
Mahler's "Symphony No. 1," a
movement which Mahler's
publisher rejected.
Then, Maestro Samuel again
challenges timid minds with Larry
Austin's new piece, "Catharsis:
Open Style for Two Improvisiz
Ensembles, Tapes and
Conductor." This will be the
work's West Coast premiere (it
was first performed in 1968). It
shuns conventional music
notation for the use of an
"Instruction Sheet" to each
player) the orchestra, the
composer-performer, and solo
pianist Robert Floyd will be
guided through the adventurous
piece by the conductor. It should
be another interesting experiment.
What to do this weekend?
Several excellent opportunities to
enjoy some good music are
available, in town, on campus and
in San Francisco.
Bobby Stevens of the
Checkmates Ltd., has opened a
club in East Palo Alto with his
brothers. Called the Checkmate
Inn, the club plans to book top
talent, including Aretha Franklin,
Dionne Warwick and Re
Checkmates Ltd., who wrote and
recorded the song "Black Girl"
and who has cut an LP for Phil
Spector.
This weekend, Phil Flowers will
be playing. The Inn is a
membership club, but there are no
"restrictions" (except minors). No
cover charge for members, no
drink minimum—lifetime
membership is $50. Go out and
visit them this weekend at 1605
Bay Road, tell them you read
about their club in the Daily, and
they'll give you and your guest a
free pass. There is no obligation to
join, of course. Actually,
membership would not be very
economical for most
undergraduates, but tenured
faculty and Physics grad students
might be interested. Perhaps they
can arrange group membership for
living groups.
Tonight and Saturday at the
Masonic in the City, John
Kornfeld is presenting two superb
musical productions. Tonight at
8:30, the Romanian Madrigal
makes their West Coast debut
after having been an overshelming
success in Now York. They
perform Medieval and Renaissance
vocal music, in a manner much
like the New York Pro Musica—in
16th century costume, as if they
were performing for royalty.
Their appearance here has not
been as well-publicized as it
should have been, for this
promises to be an exciting
evening.
Van Cliburn
Saturday night, Van Cliburn
takes the Masonic stage for a
concert of solo piano music,
feturing Chopin and
Tchaikowsky. After winning the
Tchaikowsky Prize in Moscow
several years ago, Cliburn became
one of the top recording stars in
the country. It was he who
brought classical music into the
homes of millions of Americans
with excellent recording of
Chopin, Beethoven and Liszt. His

concert this Saturday in the City
will no doubt be an extremely
popular one, so I would suggest
you reserve tickets soon (available
through the Ticketron agency in
Mem Aud).
One note on productions by
John Kornfeld: if you call them in
the City at 781-7833, and tell
them you are a diligent and
hard-working Stanford student,
they'll leave a "Rush" ticket at
the box office for you—which
means you can get in for
half-price. Any seat in the house
which is unsold half an hour or so
before curtain is yours at a 50%
discount. Be sure to bring your
student body card, and be sure to
call ahead of time. Van Cliburn
may be sold out, however, so you
had better check on it right away.
If you don't like leaving the
campus, the Stanford Music
Department invites you to a free
concert this Sunday afternoon at
3 pm in Dinkelspiel. Sandor Salgo
and the Stanford Chamber
Orchestra open the program with
Bach's "Brandenburg Concerto
No. 2"; the Stanford Chorale,
under the direction of Harold
Schmidt, will present a group of
Renaissance madrigals; and
violinist Kenneth Goldsmith and
pianist Anthony Doheny will
perform two Mozart Sonatas.
Finally, if you just feel like not
going anywhere tonight, but
you'd like to relax, go to Mem
Chu at 8 p.m. Samuel Swartz,
assistant and pupil of University
Organist Herbert Nanney, will
present a recital of early and
modern organ works. We have an
excellent organ in the Church, and
the acoustics are just right for
Bach and Buxtehude. The recital
is, of course, free.
Oakland Symphony
The Oakland Symphony's
second concert this season, next
Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, November 11, 12 and
13, promises to be as exciting and
unconventional as its first, in
which Maestro Gerhard Samuel

Orchestral Premiere of Terry

3 pm in Dinkelspiel. Sandor Salgo
and the Stanford Chamber
Orchestra open the program with
Bach's "Brandenburg Concerto
No. 2"; the Stanford Chorale,
under the direction of Harold
Schmidt, will present a group of
Renaissance madrigals; and
violinist Kenneth Goldsmith and
pianist Anthony Doheny will
perform two Mozart Sonatas.
Finally, if you just feel like not
going anywhere tonight, but
you'd like to relax, go to Mem
Chu at 8 p.m. Samuel Swartz,
assistant and pupil of University
Organist Herbert Nanney, will
present a recital of early and
modern organ works. We have an
excellent organ in the Church, and
the acoustics are just right for
Bach and Buxtehude. The recital
is, of course, free.
Oakland Symphony
The Oakland Symphony's
second concert this season, next
Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, November 11, 12 and
13, promises to be as exciting and
unconventional as its first, in
which Maestro Gerhard Samuel
presented the West Coast
Orchestral Premiere of Terry
Riley's "In C." Five pieces will be
performed by the orchestra; three
are standard concert are, but the
two others are not.
Opening the concerts will be
Mozart's "Overture to the Magic
Flute," a lovely, sensitive piece,
followed by Bartok's "Violin
Concerto No. 2" with Israeli
violinist Ivry Gitlis in his second

appearance with the Oakland
Symphony. Also on the program
is Ravel's "Daphis and Chloe Suite
No. 2," originally composed for
the Ballet Russe.
The concert will also include
two works which have just
recently appeared. The first is a
newly discovered movement to
Mahler's "Symphony No. 1," a
movement which Mahler's
publisher rejected.
Then, Maestro Samuel again
challenges timid minds with Larry
Austin's new piece, "Catharsis:
Open Style for Two Improvisiz
Ensembles, Tapes and
Conductor." This will be the
work's West Coast premiere (it
was first performed in 1968). It
shuns conventional music
notation for the use of an
"Instruction Sheet" to each
player) the orchestra, the
composer-performer, and solo
pianist Robert Floyd will be
guided through the adventurous
piece by the conductor. It should
be another interesting experiment.
What to do this weekend?
Several excellent opportunities to
enjoy some good music are
available, in town, on campus and
in San Francisco.
Bobby Stevens of the
Checkmates Ltd., has opened a
club in East Palo Alto with his
brothers. Called the Checkmate
Inn, the club plans to book top
talent, including Aretha Franklin,
Dionne Warwick and Re
Checkmates Ltd., who wrote and
recorded the song "Black Girl"
and who has cut an LP for Phil
Spector.
This weekend, Phil Flowers will
be playing. The Inn is a
membership club, but there are no
"restrictions" (except minors). No
cover charge for members, no
drink minimum—lifetime
membership is $50. Go out and
visit them this weekend at 1605
Bay Road, tell them you read
about their club in the Daily, and
they'll give you and your guest a
free pass. There is no obligation to
join, of course. Actually,
membership would not be very
economical for most
undergraduates, but tenured
faculty and Physics grad students
might be interested. Perhaps they
can arrange group membership for
living groups.
Tonight and Saturday at the
Masonic in the City, John
Kornfeld is presenting two superb
musical productions. Tonight at
8:30, the Romanian Madrigal
makes their West Coast debut
after having been an overshelming
success in Now York. They
perform Medieval and Renaissance
vocal music, in a manner much
like the New York Pro Musica—in
16th century costume, as if they
were performing for royalty.
Their appearance here has not
been as well-publicized as it
should have been, for this
promises to be an exciting
evening.
Van Cliburn
Saturday night, Van Cliburn
takes the Masonic stage for a
concert of solo piano music,
feturing Chopin and
Tchaikowsky. After winning the
Tchaikowsky Prize in Moscow
several years ago, Cliburn became
one of the top recording stars in
the country. It was he who
brought classical music into the
homes of millions of Americans
with excellent recording of
Chopin, Beethoven and Liszt. His

concert this Saturday in the City
will no doubt be an extremely
popular one, so I would suggest
you reserve tickets soon (available
through the Ticketron agency in
Mem Aud).
One note on productions by
John Kornfeld: if you call them in
the City at 781-7833, and tell
them you are a diligent and
hard-working Stanford student,
they'll leave a "Rush" ticket at
the box office for you—which
means you can get in for
half-price. Any seat in the house
which is unsold half an hour or so
before curtain is yours at a 50%
discount. Be sure to bring your
student body card, and be sure to
call ahead of time. Van Cliburn
may be sold out, however, so you
had better check on it right away.
