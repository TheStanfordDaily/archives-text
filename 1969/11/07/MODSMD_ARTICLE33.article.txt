# Are Huskies Hapless?
## Gridders Set For TV Tilt 
### 
Stanford makes its television
debut tomorrow afternoon, and
viewers all down the coast should
be mightly impressed.
The Tribe is so heavily favored
over winless Washington, that the
odds-makers refuse to even handle
the game. Don't be surprised if
the visiting Indians rack up their
fourth shutout of the year, and
even break a few of their own
league records for offense, set this
season.
Coach John Ralston has been
playing the polite coach's role all
week, publicly worrying about a
Washington uprising. Although a
TV win over Stanford would go a
long way in solving their
numerous troubles, Ralston and
everyone else will be in total
shock if it happens.
Washington Last
The Huskies rank last in the
Pac-8 in total offense while
Stanford is first. In the Indians'
one weak department, pass
defense (last in the league), they
should not have much worry this
week. Washington is last in passing
offense.
To add to UW's problems, the
Tribe has just completed a very
successful week of practice. The
passing game has been sharp, with
both Jim Plunkett and Don Bunce
hitting receivers regularly, and all
running backs have been going full
speed.
The only injury on the team at
the moment is a deep charley
horse suffered by safety Jim
Kauffman, but he is expected to
be ready for action tomorrow.
On the Washington side of the
fence, nobody really knows what

is happening. It is expected that
the eight black players who
missed the trip to Los Angeles last
week will play against Stanford.
The four blacks suspended by
Coach Jim Owens last week for
"not pledging 100 per cent to the
UW football program," remain off
the squad, and the controversy is
still raging.
Last year at this time, the
Indians were coming off a 29-7
loss to Oregon State, and beat the
Huskies, 35-20. It was the finest

day of the year for Bunce and
fullback Howie Williams.
Bunce Hot
Bunce came on when Plunkett
was injured on the first play of
the second quarter, and threw
three touchdown passes and
scored another himself.
Williams carried for 133 yards
in the game and scored one TD.
A victory over Washington—un
less its a preposterously big one
(and coaches don't like to do that
sort of thing)—won't do much for

the Tribe in the national rankings,
but a loss would probably drop
them out of the top 20.

Kauffman, but he is expected to
be ready for action tomorrow.
On the Washington side of the
fence, nobody really knows what

is happening. It is expected that
the eight black players who
missed the trip to Los Angeles last
week will play against Stanford.
The four blacks suspended by
Coach Jim Owens last week for
"not pledging 100 per cent to the
UW football program," remain off
the squad, and the controversy is
still raging.
Last year at this time, the
Indians were coming off a 29-7
loss to Oregon State, and beat the
Huskies, 35-20. It was the finest

day of the year for Bunce and
fullback Howie Williams.
Bunce Hot
Bunce came on when Plunkett
was injured on the first play of
the second quarter, and threw
three touchdown passes and
scored another himself.
Williams carried for 133 yards
in the game and scored one TD.
A victory over Washington—un
less its a preposterously big one
(and coaches don't like to do that
sort of thing)—won't do much for

the Tribe in the national rankings,
but a loss would probably drop
them out of the top 20.
Stanford makes its television
debut tomorrow afternoon, and
viewers all down the coast should
be mightly impressed.
The Tribe is so heavily favored
over winless Washington, that the
odds-makers refuse to even handle
the game. Don't be surprised if
the visiting Indians rack up their
fourth shutout of the year, and
even break a few of their own
league records for offense, set this
season.
Coach John Ralston has been
playing the polite coach's role all
week, publicly worrying about a
Washington uprising. Although a
TV win over Stanford would go a
long way in solving their
numerous troubles, Ralston and
everyone else will be in total
shock if it happens.
Washington Last
The Huskies rank last in the
Pac-8 in total offense while
Stanford is first. In the Indians'
one weak department, pass
defense (last in the league), they
should not have much worry this
week. Washington is last in passing
offense.
To add to UW's problems, the
Tribe has just completed a very
successful week of practice. The
passing game has been sharp, with
both Jim Plunkett and Don Bunce
hitting receivers regularly, and all
running backs have been going full
speed.
The only injury on the team at
the moment is a deep charley
horse suffered by safety Jim
Kauffman, but he is expected to
be ready for action tomorrow.
