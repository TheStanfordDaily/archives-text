# Honolulu Pair Paces Meager Frosh Water Polo Contingent
## 
### GREG JACOBS 
This year's freshman water polo
team is plagued by the same
problem that has hampered
previous Stanford frosh teamsâ€”a
lack of experienced players.
Stanford has always had
difficulty in recruiting water polo
players from high school;
consequently, many of Stanford's
finest polo players have been
"converted swimmers" who first
learned the game in their
freshman year.
There are only two players on
the frosh who have had much
previous experience: Bob Warren,
the team captain, and Dan
Powilson, who are both from
Punaho prep school in Honolulu.
Although polo competition in
Hawaii generally isn't up to the
level of play on the mainland,
particularly in California, both
boys have enough polish to lead
the frosh in scoring.
After nine games, the team
record stands at 6-3.
Warren has scored 23 goals on a
variety of ingenious shots, at a 42
percent shooting average.
Powilson has backed him up with
19 goals, and an excellent 48
percent clip.
Unfortunately, the fact that the
two have taken most of the shots
attempted by the team reflects,
again, the general inexperience of
the other players. Good polo
strategy dictates a balanced team
offense.
Other frosh in action are Don

Mitchell, Stu Rowe, M.J. May,
Chris Avery, Tim Broderick, Ollie
Press, Mark van Brusselman, and
Bob Wilson.
Jimmy Smith is the man who
coaches the future varsity, and he
is faced every season with the task
of preparing the frosh for the
upper level of college
competition.
Smith is in his fifth year at
Stanford, and his frosh teams have
won the Northern California
Closed Polo Tournament two out
of four times. The Tribe mentor is

quick to praise this year's frosh
even if they are inexperienced.
Coach Smith says, "They are
constantly improving, but they
are handicapped by a shortage of
players. This is the smallest
turnout for the team in my five
years here."
Smith usually cannot run an
all-frosh scrimmage in practice so
he uses players from his regular
polo classes, and graduate
students who are former Stanford
players to provide the frosh with
daily competition.
