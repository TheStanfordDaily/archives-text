# Hockey Team Falls Again
## 
### 
The third period blues struck
Stanford's ice hockey forces again
Tuesday night as they dropped
their fourth straight, this time to
the still undefeated Belmont
Oaks, 7-2.
Failure to cash in on golden
scoring opportunities in the first
two frames, when they enjoyed a
margin of superiority, left the
redshirts trailing, 4-1, going into
the final 20 minutes. But the game
was not out of reach until what
seems now to be a semi-traditional
collapse about ten minutes from
the end.
Gary Aitken was again a tower
of strength in the Stanford nets.
The Indian scorers were Doug
Adams, whose family was here to
watch him get the game's first

goal on a defenseman's rush, and
Ed Leonard, whose picture goal
came too late to be of any
influence on the final outcome.
Stanford sorely missed the
services of top scorer Paul
Tittmann, who has a class conflict
that may permanently affect his
usefulness to the team.
Next Tuesday, the Cards get
their second shot at the Berkeley
Bruins. The young Bruins, only a
game ahead of Stanford in the
standings, gave the Indians a
physical beating in their first
rough and dirty meeting three
weeks ago. Revenge might be a
factor in the rematch.
