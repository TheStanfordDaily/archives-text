# Bear Cubs Await Papooses Saturday
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
Coming off what Coach Bill Moultrie describes as "our best set of
practice sessions this season," Stanford's squad of win-hungry
Papooses will be going Bear hunting tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.
Looking for their second and, of course, biggest victory of the year,
they meet California in the Little Big Game.
"If we can play tomorrow with the same spirit and determination
we demonstrated against UCLA," commented Coach Moultrie, "we'll
beat the Bears."
Cubs Lose
Berkeley was beaten in their last outing by the USC Frosh, 33-21,
but they moved the ball well on the ground and clicked with their
passing game also. They need a win tomorrow to even their season at
2-2, their only victory coming over hapless San Jose.
"They'll be after us for sure," smiled Moultrie. "They need a win to
have a .500 year, and of course they're always up for the Stanford
game. "But we're up for this one too; we're ready offensively and
defensively and we're set to settle down and slug it out with them.
Defense Ready
"Defensively we'll have to stop them on the ground, make them
put the ball in the air, but our guys know what this entails. I feel that
our entire squad is really beginning to get a taste of college football.
"Offensively we'll be looking to Eric Cross who has scored all of
our touchdowns, to have a good day. Eric will be 1 00 per cent healthy
after hobbling through he UCLA game and will be returning to his
home ground in Alameda County.
"Eric and our other two running threats, Reggi Sanderson, and Barr
Curry, all looked good this week on a dry field and in the mud. We've
got some real mudhens on the squad and I don't think that the rain
will bother us at all if it should come to that."
Moore to Start
Pat Moore will draw the starting nod at quarterback and Steve
Fhgata has earned himself a starting spot at flanker after his
performance in the UCLA game. Ned Chambers and Steve Murray,
who have been carrying on a real dogfight for the safety post are still
awaiting a decision.
The Papooses will run through a light, 30-minute, loosening up drill
this afternoon in final preparation for Berkeley. They'll board busses
tomorrow at 7 a.m. for the hour drive to Memorial Stadium and their
date with the Bears.
"I'm expecting a wide open game with Cal," concluded Moultrie.
"They're a real physical bunch but our guys, though giving away size
and weight all year long, have earned everything that they have
received through hustle and spirit.
"I just can't see them quitting now. I still hold to my claim that if
this group sticks together with the same kind of enthusiasm and
dedication and picks up a pound or two along the way, you can make
reservations in Pasadena for '72 now."
