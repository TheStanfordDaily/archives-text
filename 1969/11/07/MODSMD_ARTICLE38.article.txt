# Exploring A Stanford Athlete
## 
### FRED MANN Second in a two-part series 
(The SES Subcommittee on
Athletics has recommended
numerous changes in the
operation and direction of the
Athletic Department. Many of the
recommendations regard the
athlete at Stanford, and his
relationships with coaches, other
students, and the academic
community. Today's article
explores the difficult world of the
"student-athlete ".)
The report states, "if one were
designing American universities
from scratch, he certainly would
not include in the design
intercollegiate competition as it
now exists. While its practices
have been part of the university
structure for about half a century,
they have only marginal relevance
to the main function of the
university."
To be certain, sports play a
large part at Stanford.
Intercollegiate teams compete in
15 sports, and student support
judged by football rooter ticket
sales is one of the highest in the
country.
But are the athletes happy at
Stanford? Are they accepted by
other students or kept too busy
with sports to explore other
activities? Are they really
student-athletes as the Athletic
Department says, or are they
athletes first and students second?
Negative Effects
The committee found that
there are negative effects on
athletes due to interschool
competition. Often they have no
time for other extra-curricular
activities, and they are segregated
in certain living units.
The report urged a close study
of excessive time demands on
athletes, and called for closer
integration of coaches into the
academic community.
"The coach has probably the
greatest personal contact with a
boy," said Helliwell. "He should
be a part of the faculty and must
be kept informed of events and
decisions in all areas of the
University."
In respect to academics, the
committee found "no snap
courses designed for athletes and
no attempts to provide special

curricula for ar. athlete to get
through the University in any way
different from the average
student."
Those opposed to athletics
often point to individual teachers
however, who favor the football
player over other students.
Happy Kids
"On the whole, the kids aren't
unhappy," said Taylor.
"Nowadays, the athlete can hold
his own with other students
academically. They don't feel
different from the others."
Football coach John Ralston
went even further stating players
were, "definitely happy."
A survey cited by the
committee showed athletes in
general to be happy, but nearly
half of the football players
questioned felt "not totally
accepted" at Stanford.
"I don't know why it's just the
football team," said reserve
quarterback Don Bunce. "Maybe
it's the publicity. Everyone
recognizes you as an athlete.
"Personally, I am happy. I'd
probably be alot happier playing
every day, but that is nobody's
fault. It's a great university."
Safety Jim Kauffman who does
play every day is happier this
season than last, but admitted
that "football often doesn't give
you time for anything else."
When questioned as to why his
football players especially felt
"not accepted," Ralston stated he
did not know the answer. "But
athletes can be happy with their
sport. I feel sorry for those who
don't play ball—they miss the
greatest part of their education."
Selection Panel
The committee generally
heaped praise on the
intercollegiate program, but
suggested a panel of coaches and
athletes be used to select new
coaches. (Players questioned loved
the idea. Coach Ralston was
undecided). The report also called
for a "concerted effort" to hire
black coaches attuned to the
problems of today's black
athletes.
The level of competition in the
Pacific-8 Conference, and
recruiting procedures were

discussed in the report, and left
for further evaluation.
"It would be great to play
football on a scale like Harvard,"
commented Kauffman. "But I
also love to play with the big
teams in front of 85,000 people.
Rugby is more of a fun
sport—football here is closer to
big business."
Unique Setup
Stanford currently holds a
rather unique position, playing in
a league composed of six state
schools (and USC). Entrance
requirements are higher at
Stanford than elsewhere, so
athletic teams are working from a
much smaller pool. Still Stanford
manages to play on a par with the
top conference teams in all sports.
"We sell Stanford on its

academics," said Taylor. He
grinned. "We sure can't promise
them the Rose Bowl."
Coach Ralston agreed, but
hoped it would someday be
different. "There is no doubt that
academically, Stanford is the
Harvard of the West. But I would
like to make Stanford the Ohio
State of the West in athletics," he
said.
Taylor has led a somehwat
lonely campaign to lower the level
of recruiting of high school
athletes in the league. "There
must be controls," he remarked.
"The real agressive recruiting is
not healthy for the boy or the
school. All parts of the University
recruit, and it is necessary in

athletics, but the policy must not
be abused."
Ralston called recruiting, "the
Amercian way. It's a search for
excellence."
The committee
recommendations will hopefully
help provide the athlete with a
greater exposure to "the
educational and cultural
opportunities at Stanford."
The report added, "Stanford
has been able to live, in a sense, in
two worlds—that of academic
excellence and that of athletic
excellence—without a great
compromise in either direction.
Yet its intercollegiate
commitment has led to strains for
which the committee has tried to
find remedies."

"I don't know why it's just the
football team," said reserve
quarterback Don Bunce. "Maybe
it's the publicity. Everyone
recognizes you as an athlete.
"Personally, I am happy. I'd
probably be alot happier playing
every day, but that is nobody's
fault. It's a great university."
Safety Jim Kauffman who does
play every day is happier this
season than last, but admitted
that "football often doesn't give
you time for anything else."
When questioned as to why his
football players especially felt
"not accepted," Ralston stated he
did not know the answer. "But
athletes can be happy with their
sport. I feel sorry for those who
don't play ball—they miss the
greatest part of their education."
Selection Panel
The committee generally
heaped praise on the
intercollegiate program, but
suggested a panel of coaches and
athletes be used to select new
coaches. (Players questioned loved
the idea. Coach Ralston was
undecided). The report also called
for a "concerted effort" to hire
black coaches attuned to the
problems of today's black
athletes.
The level of competition in the
Pacific-8 Conference, and
recruiting procedures were

discussed in the report, and left
for further evaluation.
"It would be great to play
football on a scale like Harvard,"
commented Kauffman. "But I
also love to play with the big
teams in front of 85,000 people.
Rugby is more of a fun
sport—football here is closer to
big business."
Unique Setup
Stanford currently holds a
rather unique position, playing in
a league composed of six state
schools (and USC). Entrance
requirements are higher at
Stanford than elsewhere, so
athletic teams are working from a
much smaller pool. Still Stanford
manages to play on a par with the
top conference teams in all sports.
"We sell Stanford on its

academics," said Taylor. He
grinned. "We sure can't promise
them the Rose Bowl."
Coach Ralston agreed, but
hoped it would someday be
different. "There is no doubt that
academically, Stanford is the
Harvard of the West. But I would
like to make Stanford the Ohio
State of the West in athletics," he
said.
Taylor has led a somehwat
lonely campaign to lower the level
of recruiting of high school
athletes in the league. "There
must be controls," he remarked.
"The real agressive recruiting is
not healthy for the boy or the
school. All parts of the University
recruit, and it is necessary in

athletics, but the policy must not
be abused."
Ralston called recruiting, "the
Amercian way. It's a search for
excellence."
The committee
recommendations will hopefully
help provide the athlete with a
greater exposure to "the
educational and cultural
opportunities at Stanford."
The report added, "Stanford
has been able to live, in a sense, in
two worlds—that of academic
excellence and that of athletic
excellence—without a great
compromise in either direction.
Yet its intercollegiate
commitment has led to strains for
which the committee has tried to
find remedies."

To be certain, sports play a

Intercollegiate teams compete in

Negative Effects
The committee found that
there are negative effects on
athletes due to interschool
competition. Often they have no
time for other extra-curricular
activities, and they are segregated
in certain living units.
The report urged a close study
of excessive time demands on
athletes, and called for closer
integration of coaches into the
academic community.
"The coach has probably the
greatest personal contact with a
boy," said Helliwell. "He should
be a part of the faculty and must
be kept informed of events and

University."
In respect to academics, the
committee found "no snap
courses designed for athletes and
no attempts to provide special

curricula for ar. athlete to get

often point to individual teachers

recruit, and it is necessary in

Ralston called recruiting, "the

excellence."

ARE ATHLETES HAPPY?—DAILY investigation
definitively concludes that sometimes Stanford athletes
are happy and sometimes not. After the (JSC football
(The SES Subcommittee on
Athletics has recommended
numerous changes in the
operation and direction of the
Athletic Department. Many of the
recommendations regard the
athlete at Stanford, and his
relationships with coaches, other
students, and the academic
community. Today's article
explores the difficult world of the
"student-athlete ".)
The report states, "if one were
designing American universities
from scratch, he certainly would
not include in the design
intercollegiate competition as it
now exists. While its practices
have been part of the university
structure for about half a century,
they have only marginal relevance
to the main function of the
university."
To be certain, sports play a
large part at Stanford.
Intercollegiate teams compete in
15 sports, and student support
judged by football rooter ticket
sales is one of the highest in the
country.
But are the athletes happy at
Stanford? Are they accepted by
other students or kept too busy
with sports to explore other
activities? Are they really
student-athletes as the Athletic
Department says, or are they
athletes first and students second?
Negative Effects
The committee found that
there are negative effects on
athletes due to interschool
competition. Often they have no
time for other extra-curricular
activities, and they are segregated
in certain living units.
The report urged a close study
of excessive time demands on
athletes, and called for closer
integration of coaches into the
academic community.
"The coach has probably the
greatest personal contact with a
boy," said Helliwell. "He should
be a part of the faculty and must
be kept informed of events and
decisions in all areas of the
University."
In respect to academics, the
committee found "no snap
courses designed for athletes and
no attempts to provide special

curricula for ar. athlete to get
through the University in any way
different from the average
student."
Those opposed to athletics
often point to individual teachers
however, who favor the football
player over other students.
Happy Kids
"On the whole, the kids aren't
unhappy," said Taylor.
"Nowadays, the athlete can hold
his own with other students
academically. They don't feel
different from the others."
Football coach John Ralston
went even further stating players
were, "definitely happy."
A survey cited by the
committee showed athletes in
general to be happy, but nearly
half of the football players
questioned felt "not totally
accepted" at Stanford.
"I don't know why it's just the
football team," said reserve
quarterback Don Bunce. "Maybe
it's the publicity. Everyone
recognizes you as an athlete.
"Personally, I am happy. I'd
probably be alot happier playing
every day, but that is nobody's
fault. It's a great university."
Safety Jim Kauffman who does
play every day is happier this
season than last, but admitted
that "football often doesn't give
you time for anything else."
When questioned as to why his
football players especially felt
"not accepted," Ralston stated he
did not know the answer. "But
athletes can be happy with their
sport. I feel sorry for those who
don't play ball—they miss the
greatest part of their education."
Selection Panel
The committee generally
heaped praise on the
intercollegiate program, but
suggested a panel of coaches and
athletes be used to select new
coaches. (Players questioned loved
the idea. Coach Ralston was
undecided). The report also called
for a "concerted effort" to hire
black coaches attuned to the
problems of today's black
athletes.
The level of competition in the
Pacific-8 Conference, and
recruiting procedures were

discussed in the report, and left
for further evaluation.
"It would be great to play
football on a scale like Harvard,"
commented Kauffman. "But I
also love to play with the big
teams in front of 85,000 people.
Rugby is more of a fun
sport—football here is closer to
big business."
Unique Setup
Stanford currently holds a
rather unique position, playing in
a league composed of six state
schools (and USC). Entrance
requirements are higher at
Stanford than elsewhere, so
athletic teams are working from a
much smaller pool. Still Stanford
manages to play on a par with the
top conference teams in all sports.
"We sell Stanford on its

academics," said Taylor. He
grinned. "We sure can't promise
them the Rose Bowl."
Coach Ralston agreed, but
hoped it would someday be
different. "There is no doubt that
academically, Stanford is the
Harvard of the West. But I would
like to make Stanford the Ohio
State of the West in athletics," he
said.
Taylor has led a somehwat
lonely campaign to lower the level
of recruiting of high school
athletes in the league. "There
must be controls," he remarked.
"The real agressive recruiting is
not healthy for the boy or the
school. All parts of the University
recruit, and it is necessary in

athletics, but the policy must not
be abused."
Ralston called recruiting, "the
Amercian way. It's a search for
