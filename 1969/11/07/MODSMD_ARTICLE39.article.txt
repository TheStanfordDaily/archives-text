# Theta Delts, Zetes Score Mural Wins
## 
### SCOTT BURNS 
Aiming for the biggest upset in
IM football this season, the
determined Phi Kapps scared the
Phi Delts with a tough defense
alignment Wednesday, but it was
not enough.
A tenacious rush and good
defensive secondary held the Phi
Delts scoreless in the first half.
The only real offensive threat all
day from the Phi Kapps left them
stranded, and also scoreless, on
the Phi Delt goal line as the first
half gun sounded. It took a couple
of incredible catches in the second
half by center Greg Kowal to put
the Phi Delts on the scoreboard as
they went on to win, 12-0.
On Tuesday, the Zetes won a
fantastic come-from-behind
victory over the tough Sigma
Chi's. It was an amazing game in
that there were not many
consistent offensive drives, and
most of the scoring was done on
long passes.
The Sigma Chi's led 19-7 early
in the second half, but the passing
combinations of quarterback
Steve Kistler to Steve
Longbotham and Rob Towner
brought the score back to 19-19
late in the game.
Then Longbotham intercepted
a long Chi pass in his endzone,
and it did not take long for the
Zetes to score again. The game
ended with the Zetes winning,
26-19.
The Theta Delts showed a well

balanced offense and tough
defense as they defeated the
Delts, 27-0, on Wednesday. Boog
Parker, the Theta Delt
quarterback, used all six of his
receivers equally well as he kept
the Delt defensive backfield
guessing where the next pass was
going to go.
An amazing play resulted when
a member of the Delt bench
stepped on the field just in time
to tag a Theta Delt rounding the
corner with the ball. The whistle
blew and the astonished Theta
Delt returned to the huddle
wondering how the Delts had
diagnosed the play so well, as the
tagger slowly retired to the
sidelines with a big grin on his
face.
The refs had been tricked along
with the guy with the ball, but the
spectators on the sidelines from
both teams knew the truth and
were breaking up with laughter.
A few cries for help have been
heard coming from the KA house
lately. In their game earlier this
week with the Alpha Sigs, both
their first and second string
quarterbacks were injured.
The first string quarterback
hurt his shoulder and may be out
for the rest of the season, and the
second stringer has a dislocated
Adam's apple and might as well be
out for the rest of the year for he
can't call signals. They have a big
game coming up with the SAE's,
and their offense needs help.
