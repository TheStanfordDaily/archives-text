# Protesters Block MTT Office

### 
C A M B R 1 DGE, Mass.
(AP)— About 250 protestors
blocked a corridor outside the
office of President Howard W.
Johnson of Massachusetts
Institute of Technology for three
hours Thursday in an antiwar
demonstration.
Provost Jerome B. Weisner was
shouted down when he asked
demonstrators to clear the path to
Johnson's locked and empty
office in the MIT administration
building.
There was no damage in the
corridor although the
demonstrators littered it with
papers and tacked up wall posters
reading "building condemned."
The group demands a halt to MIT
participation in military research.
The blockade of the corridor
was made despite a court
injunction barring obstruction of
any university facility.
Police were not called in to
evict the demonstrators, who
dispersed voluntarily. Vice
President Kenneth R. Wadleigh
stood in front of Johnson's office
throughout the three-hour
protest, and he estimated that as
many as 100 of the demonstrators
who had marched into the
building sat down around him.
Prof. Paul E. Gray, associate
provost, estimated that "not more
than 20 per cent" of the
protesters were MIT students.

They were led by the November
Action Coalition, a group of
Greater Boston protest
organizations.
Desegregation
NEW ORLEANS (AP)-The 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave
30 Mississippi school districts
until Dec. 31 to implement
effective desegregation plans
Thursday and said it would issue
orders Friday on just what those
plans should be.
One court source said the
individual orders would generally
follow guidelines of the U.S.
Department of Health, Education

and Welfare but will give the
school districts some freedom in
making alterations with court
approval.
The action of the 5th Circuit
rejected a Justice Department
proposal made Wednesday that
the school boards be allowed to
draft their own final desegregation
plans.
Some of the Mississippi school
officials attending the preorder
conference here said the court
order would hurt public education
but a spokesman for the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund said after the
conference, "We feel we've won."
The conference was called to
give Mississippi school districts a
chance to discuss their proposals
to end separate school systems for
whites and Negroes. The U.S.
Supreme Court Oct. 22 ordered
such dual systems ended
immediately.

LOS ANGELES (AP)-The
chairman of a legislative
committee considering proposals
to lower the voting age to 19 or
18 in California said Thursday the
chances are "better than ever" a
measure on the matter will be on
the 1970 ballot.
Assemblyman Paul Priolo,
R-Santa Monica, added that such
a measure may also include

lowering the age at which young
persons are considered responsible
adults—removing some or all of
the special legal protections they
now enjoy.
Priolo's comments were made
at an interim hearing of the
assembly's Committee on
Elections and Constitutional
Amendments held at UCLA.
Peace March
WASHINGTON (AP)-Force
will be used if necessary to block
a mass march down Pennsylvania

"The Army, as far as the
District of Columbia is concerned,
is always standing by," said
Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kleindienst as he reiterated that
there is "a substantial likelihood
of serious violence."
He told newsmen the Guard
and the Army will be ready if
needed to bolster District of
Columbia police, U.S. Park Police
and the White House police force.
The Pentagon, saying it has
started precautionary planning,
reported 28,000 soldiers and
Marines are available in the
general Washington area for use if
needed.

Desegregation
NEW ORLEANS (AP)-The 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave
30 Mississippi school districts
until Dec. 31 to implement
effective desegregation plans
Thursday and said it would issue
orders Friday on just what those
plans should be.
One court source said the
individual orders would generally
follow guidelines of the U.S.
Department of Health, Education

and Welfare but will give the
school districts some freedom in
making alterations with court
approval.
The action of the 5th Circuit
rejected a Justice Department
proposal made Wednesday that
the school boards be allowed to
draft their own final desegregation
plans.
Some of the Mississippi school
officials attending the preorder
conference here said the court
order would hurt public education
but a spokesman for the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund said after the
conference, "We feel we've won."
The conference was called to
give Mississippi school districts a
chance to discuss their proposals
to end separate school systems for
whites and Negroes. The U.S.
Supreme Court Oct. 22 ordered
such dual systems ended
immediately.
Voting Agp
LOS ANGELES (AP)-The
chairman of a legislative
committee considering proposals
to lower the voting age to 19 or
18 in California said Thursday the
chances are "better than ever" a
measure on the matter will be on
the 1970 ballot.
Assemblyman Paul Priolo,
R-Santa Monica, added that such
a measure may also include

lowering the age at which young
persons are considered responsible
adults—removing some or all of
the special legal protections they
now enjoy.
Priolo's comments were made
at an interim hearing of the
assembly's Committee on
Elections and Constitutional
Amendments held at UCLA.
Peace March
WASHINGTON (AP)-Force
will be used if necessary to block
a mass march down Pennsylvania
Avenue on Nov. 15 to protest the

Department said Thursday, citing
availability of the National Guard

"The Army, as far as the
District of Columbia is concerned,
is always standing by," said
Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kleindienst as he reiterated that
there is "a substantial likelihood
of serious violence."
He told newsmen the Guard
and the Army will be ready if
needed to bolster District of
Columbia police, U.S. Park Police
and the White House police force.
The Pentagon, saying it has
started precautionary planning,
reported 28,000 soldiers and
Marines are available in the
general Washington area for use if
needed.
