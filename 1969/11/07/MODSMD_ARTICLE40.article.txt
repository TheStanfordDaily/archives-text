## Poloists Not Out Yet 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's varsity water polo
team, down but not out, travels to
Los Angeles this weekend for a
pair of tough league games against
UCLA and USC.
Both the Bruins and the
Trojans hold previous victories
over the Indians. The Indians have
compiled a 10-5 record, but have
a disappointing 0-3 league
performance.
One of the main problems
plaguing the Indians have been
injuries, and the situation is no
better this week. Captain Tom
Hill had his appendix removed
this week and he will see no more
action this season. Hill joins
Wayne Wlson (broken nose) and
Kevin Eagleston (torn shoulder
ligaments) on the already costly
injury list.
Coach Jim Gaughran agrees
that injuries have hurt the team,
but he also says that the team has
not been playing up to their
capabilities. "We have been

making the kind of mental lapses
we can't afford with our
inexperience." He adds that
"some of the players just haven't
been thinking carefully about
what they're doing."
The Indians have only a
mathematical possibility of
finishing second in their league
and thus qualifying for a berth in
the NCAA championships. But
Gaughran says that a berth in the
tournament is not at all
impossible.
Gaughran admits that the
inexperienced and injury ridden
Indians have little chance against

the Bruins today. But he says, "If
we can beat USC and Cal in our
las two games, we might be
awarded an "at large" bid to the
NCAA Championship.
"Having already beat UC Irvine
and San Jose State, we know we
are among the top three or four
teams in the nation, and we feel
we deserve a berth.
"At least one of the teams
which will probably be invited,
Texas, has decided not to come
and this may open up a position
for us. Nothing is certain at this
time, but we're still hopeful
something might work out."
