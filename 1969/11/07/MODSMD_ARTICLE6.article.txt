# YAF Leaves National, Blasts Reactionaries
## 
### FRED SHARKEY BUZZ THOMPSON 
The local Y.A.F. has died—or
so says Harvey Hukari. Yesterday
he confirmed rumors, during a
well-planned press conference,
that the Stanford Chapter would
disaffiliate itself from the national
Young Americans for Freedom
organization.
The chapter will continue
independently and under the
name of the "Free Campus
Movement."
Hukari cited five reasons for
breaking with the 40,000-member
conservative youth group. Two
philosophical divisions were
mentioned initially. First, the
unbridgeable split between the
Traditionalists (authoritarian,
force of law, status quo
conservatives) and the
Libertarians (more
individual-conscious conservatives
who are opposed to government
intervention in the lives of
individuals and the affairs of other
nations while still strongly
supporting the principles of
capitalism). Second is the gap
between student members and the
older leaders and fund raisers.
Other reasons for the
disaffiliation were the national
group's continued indulgence of
segregationists and reactionaries
on its national advisory board, the
destruction of the California
Y.A.F. organization by the

national hierarchy, and the
national leadership's insensitivity
to the concerns and feelings of
young people in general.
Break Continues
Other California chapters have
already broken with the national
Y.A.F. and still more will
probably make the move. The
break of the Stanford Chapter will
be an especially hard blow; it was
chosen best large college chapter
at the Y.A.F. national convention.
Doug Greene, Vice-President of
Stanford Y.A.F. and graduate
physics student, was one of three
speakers at yesterday's press
conference. He said the move was
not a spontaneous reaction but
rather the result of a long series of
events.
"We've tried very hard to work
within the national organization,
but it is very top heavy in design
to help keep the philosophy that
is already there," he said.
Distasteful Events
Qie of the most distasteful
events involved the use of funds,
said Hukari. The Stanford Chapter
"felt that they had been
exploited" through the use of
their name in national fund raising
projects from which they received
no money, he said.
The final rupture, Hukari said,
was caused by the appointment of
Bill Saracino of the University of
Southern California as chairman
of the California Y.A.F.

Saracino is a traditionalist to
Hukari's way of thinking. He
supported such candidates as
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction Max Rafferty and
Mayor Sam Yorty of Los
Angeles—whom Hakari says he'd
have disavowed.
Rod Manis, third speaker and a
research economist at Stanford,
cited the importance of the move
by stating that "authoritarians on
both the right and the left cannot
exist if they lose the libertarian
support." Manis, a former Y.A.F.
state chairman, was purged from
the national organization earlier
this year for his extreme
libertarian viewpoints. He is now
the head of the Stanford Radical
Libertarian Alliance.
Y .A.F.—K.I.P.
Hukari emphasized that the
Stanford group wanted to
continue their present activities.
While continuing to combat the
radical left, the "Free Campus
Movement" will also be active in
sponsoring seminars in libertarian
philosophy and in working for
conservative political candidates
like Governor Ronald Reagan.
The press conference was
followed by a brief ceremony in
which Hukari and 13 other
chapter members burned their
Y.A.F. membership cards, then
ceremoniously placed the ashes
and two piaques of recognition
into a white coffin.

Hukari's way of thinking. He
supported such candidates as
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction Max Rafferty and
Mayor Sam Yorty of Los
Angeles—whom Hakari says he'd
have disavowed.
Rod Manis, third speaker and a
research economist at Stanford,
cited the importance of the move
by stating that "authoritarians on
both the right and the left cannot
exist if they lose the libertarian
support." Manis, a former Y.A.F.
state chairman, was purged from
the national organization earlier
this year for his extreme
libertarian viewpoints. He is now
the head of the Stanford Radical
Libertarian Alliance.
Y .A.F.—K.I.P.
Hukari emphasized that the
Stanford group wanted to
continue their present activities.
While continuing to combat the
radical left, the "Free Campus
Movement" will also be active in
sponsoring seminars in libertarian
philosophy and in working for
conservative political candidates
like Governor Ronald Reagan.
The press conference was
followed by a brief ceremony in
which Hukari and 13 other
chapter members burned their
Y.A.F. membership cards, then
ceremoniously placed the ashes
and two piaques of recognition
into a white coffin.
The local Y.A.F. has died—or
so says Harvey Hukari. Yesterday
he confirmed rumors, during a
well-planned press conference,
that the Stanford Chapter would
disaffiliate itself from the national
Young Americans for Freedom
organization.
The chapter will continue
independently and under the
name of the "Free Campus
Movement."
Hukari cited five reasons for
breaking with the 40,000-member
conservative youth group. Two
philosophical divisions were
mentioned initially. First, the
unbridgeable split between the
Traditionalists (authoritarian,
force of law, status quo
conservatives) and the
Libertarians (more
individual-conscious conservatives
who are opposed to government
intervention in the lives of
individuals and the affairs of other
nations while still strongly
supporting the principles of
capitalism). Second is the gap
between student members and the
older leaders and fund raisers.
Other reasons for the
disaffiliation were the national
group's continued indulgence of
segregationists and reactionaries
on its national advisory board, the
destruction of the California
Y.A.F. organization by the

national hierarchy, and the
national leadership's insensitivity
to the concerns and feelings of
young people in general.
Break Continues
Other California chapters have
already broken with the national
Y.A.F. and still more will
probably make the move. The
break of the Stanford Chapter will
be an especially hard blow; it was
chosen best large college chapter
at the Y.A.F. national convention.
Doug Greene, Vice-President of
Stanford Y.A.F. and graduate
physics student, was one of three
speakers at yesterday's press
conference. He said the move was
not a spontaneous reaction but
rather the result of a long series of
events.
"We've tried very hard to work
within the national organization,
but it is very top heavy in design
to help keep the philosophy that
is already there," he said.
Distasteful Events
Qie of the most distasteful
events involved the use of funds,
said Hukari. The Stanford Chapter
"felt that they had been
exploited" through the use of
their name in national fund raising
projects from which they received
no money, he said.
The final rupture, Hukari said,
was caused by the appointment of
Bill Saracino of the University of
Southern California as chairman
of the California Y.A.F.

Saracino is a traditionalist to
Hukari's way of thinking. He
supported such candidates as
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction Max Rafferty and
Mayor Sam Yorty of Los
Angeles—whom Hakari says he'd
have disavowed.
