# Lowenstein To Visit Stanford on Sunday
## 
### 
Congressman Allard K.
Lowenstein (D-N.Y.), one of the
early leaders of the McCarthy and
Dump Johnson campaigns and a
former Stanford dean and
political science instructor, will
speak Sunday night at 7:30 in
Cubberley auditorium.
Lowenstein is scheduled to
speak on the direction and effect
of the Moratorium. Normally,
however, he ends up talking also
about whatever else his audience
wants to hear.
A first term congressman,
Lowenstein represents the Fifth
District of New York, comprising
the southwestern portion of Long
Island. He moved to the district to
run for Congress last year.
Lowenstein graduated from the
University of North Carolina in
1949. The following year he was
the third president of the National
Student Association, before the
organization began receiving CIA
funds.
While at Yale Law School he
was national chairman of Students
for Stevenson in 1952. Following
two years in the Army, he was
appointed educational consultant
to the American Association for
the United Nations by Eleanor
Roosevelt.
In 1959, at the invitation of
tribal leaders in South West
Africa, he conducted a
fact-finding mission there and was
subsequently the first
non-member to testify before the
U.S. Trusteeship Council. It was
largely because of this testimony,

which formed the basis of his
book The Brutal Mandate, that
the Trusteeship Council took up
the matter of South West Africa's
trust arrangement.
