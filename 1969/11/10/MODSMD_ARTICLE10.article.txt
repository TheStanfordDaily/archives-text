# Unlimited Shit
## Administration Dodge 
### Marshall Kilduff 
Almost everyone respects
administrators. They work
incredible hours and take
unlimited shit for their
efforts.They're polite, responsive,
and honest. About these qualities
there's little doubt, but is it
enough?
Take for example the recent
salary disclosures, an issue that
everybody should look at closely.
When the documents first
appeared, the administration
chose to dodge the issue. A release
from the News Service said
nothing about why econ
professors earn so much or
language professors so little.
Instead the statement railed on
about when and where the files
were stolen, complete with quotes
from a few heavies about how
terrible the whole thing was. At
the end there was a table of

overall salary averages for
University professors during the
past few years.
But none of this helped anyone
to understand what was
happening. Students and faculty
members wondered why salary
differences existed within
departments, why the poli sci
department rewarded
behavioralists so well, and why
students play no role in the
promotion process.
But a few days later the
University adopted a firmer
approach: obtain a temporary
restraining order if the Daily or
Chaparral try to print names or
figures. Provost Lyman came to
the Daily offices and declared
there was "a strong possibility" of
legal action if the editors of either
publication refused to heed the
warnings.
Liberated Documents
So discussion remained on a
vague, generalized level. People
heard about the controversy by
rumor, or if lucky they got a
glimpse of the original "liberated
documents." The Daily could
print only a few facts out of fear
of a restraining order and lawsuit.
The administration remained
tight-lipped, with their chief
utterance being a letter from
Lyman to the faculty: "the
University is prepared to provide
legal advice in aid of any faculty
or staff member and his counsel in
steps necessary to determine if his
privacy have been invaded. . ."
Why was there little real
discussion or information? The
fault lay with the University
administration, which was ready
to shut down student publications
if any facts were printed, while
refusing to comment on its own.
But this situation didn't last
long. Lyman worked up a series of
salary means, medians, minimums,
and maximums. "I would like a
more informed debate than the
kind of hit-or-miss discussion that
is going on right now," the
Provost said.
Salary Privacy
But the tables snowed the
ranges within schools, not
departments. According to
Lyman, the reason was that some
departments were small, and
exhaustive data would be too
specific, leaving no "salary
privacy." Sure, some of it makes
sense, but the administration's
tone during the salary affair has
been to avoid the implications and
reveal as little as possible. No one
wants a ''hit-or-miss
discussion"-so instead we get an
"informed debate" on Lyman's
terms with his figures.
Be fair, say administrators.
Stanford is a vast and delicate
operation, and any kind of public
salary information needs
discussion, they say. This takes
time, and it is not a high-priority
matter. This salary issue is an old
concern; it wasn't innovated this
year when those leaflets appeared,
they conclude.
But the salaries are only part of
the issue. They represent
judgements, a process few people

know much about. No one has
offered any explanation so far of
these actions.

and honest. About these qualities
there's little doubt, but is it
enough?
Take for example the recent
salary disclosures, an issue that
everybody should look at closely.
When the documents first
appeared, the administration
chose to dodge the issue. A release
from the News Service said
nothing about why econ
professors earn so much or
language professors so little.
Instead the statement railed on
about when and where the files
were stolen, complete with quotes
from a few heavies about how
terrible the whole thing was. At
the end there was a table of

overall salary averages for
University professors during the
past few years.
But none of this helped anyone
to understand what was
happening. Students and faculty
members wondered why salary
differences existed within
departments, why the poli sci
department rewarded
behavioralists so well, and why
students play no role in the
promotion process.
But a few days later the
University adopted a firmer
approach: obtain a temporary
restraining order if the Daily or
Chaparral try to print names or
figures. Provost Lyman came to
the Daily offices and declared
there was "a strong possibility" of
legal action if the editors of either
publication refused to heed the
warnings.
Liberated Documents
So discussion remained on a
vague, generalized level. People
heard about the controversy by
rumor, or if lucky they got a
glimpse of the original "liberated
documents." The Daily could
print only a few facts out of fear
of a restraining order and lawsuit.
The administration remained
tight-lipped, with their chief
utterance being a letter from
Lyman to the faculty: "the
University is prepared to provide
legal advice in aid of any faculty
or staff member and his counsel in
steps necessary to determine if his
privacy have been invaded. . ."
Why was there little real
discussion or information? The
fault lay with the University
administration, which was ready
to shut down student publications
if any facts were printed, while
refusing to comment on its own.
But this situation didn't last
long. Lyman worked up a series of
salary means, medians, minimums,
and maximums. "I would like a
more informed debate than the
kind of hit-or-miss discussion that
is going on right now," the
Provost said.
Salary Privacy
But the tables snowed the
ranges within schools, not
departments. According to
Lyman, the reason was that some
departments were small, and
exhaustive data would be too
specific, leaving no "salary
privacy." Sure, some of it makes
sense, but the administration's
tone during the salary affair has
been to avoid the implications and
reveal as little as possible. No one
wants a ''hit-or-miss
discussion"-so instead we get an
"informed debate" on Lyman's
terms with his figures.
Be fair, say administrators.
Stanford is a vast and delicate
operation, and any kind of public
salary information needs
discussion, they say. This takes
time, and it is not a high-priority
matter. This salary issue is an old
concern; it wasn't innovated this
year when those leaflets appeared,
they conclude.
But the salaries are only part of
the issue. They represent
judgements, a process few people

know much about. No one has
offered any explanation so far of
these actions.

Almost everyone respects
administrators. They work
incredible hours and take
unlimited shit for their
efforts.They're polite, responsive,
and honest. About these qualities
there's little doubt, but is it
