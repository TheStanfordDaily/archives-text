## NAIROBI: Educational Alternative 
### Jimm Parker 
On September 29, 1969 a new
community college, Nairobi
College, was opened in East Palo
Alto. This college was opened in
order to give all students,
particularly those of color, an
alternative to an educational
system which serves all people
badly and those of color not at all.
For the past three years the
East Palo Alto Community has
recognized that its young people
are being short-changed by an
educational system that refuses to

admit that people of color can
learn or that they have many
things to teach. The children of
this community have been
"turned off," "pushed out,"
"de-educated," and have ended up
unprepared for jobs, college, life,
or their roles in the community.
For a few years the University
of California at Berkeley, San
Francisco State College, Stanford
University, and the College of San
Mateo were making concerted
efforts to compensate for this

inadequate educational system,
but in the last year these same
institutions, concerned with
student unrest, demands for
relevant education, and increased
hiring of faculty of color have
begun excludingstudentleaders of
the peoples of color. When these
so called "high risk" students
started presenting these
institutions with "non-negot
iables," bubas, dashikas, and
naturals, these institutions
decided that they no longer
wanted the "high risk" student
and this is the type of student
needed by the community
because he will return to it.
For some reason these
institutions have come to
associate militancy with
destruction and this is not always
the case. The streets and campuses
are filled with expelled,
suspended, or alienated students
who know the problems of their
communities and who believe that
they are less and less likely to
solve these problems with the
education they will receive on a
college campus. It is the Black,
Brown, Yellow, Red, and White
student who is tired of seeing

buildings which are still functional
leveled in order to create
walled-off fortresses of hallowed
learnings; who are tired of seeing
their culture destroyed and
replaced by one which fits it
badly; tired of seeing generation
separated from generation or race
from race so that one may climb
on the shaky foundation of the
destruction of the other; tired of
being stripped of their dignity or
their ability to determine their
own destinies, and being forced to
follow a leadership they neither
understand nor respect.
Colleges Without Walls
Nairobi College was created as
an attempt to answer some of
these needs. The courses being
offered there include
Introductory Psychology,
Philosophy, English Composition,
Beginning and Advanced
Journalism, Afro-American music,
Community Organization, Black
Legal Problems, Racism and the
Community, and many others.
The courses are taught by
volunteer instructors who teach
their classes wherever there is
space in the community.
Nairobi College is being
designed to produce doctors,
lawyers, engineers, skilled
businessmen, capable technicians,
able public officials, and social
scientists who are a part of the
community that they intend to
serve and who serve that
community while they develop
their expertise. This is probably
the principal feature that makes
Nairobi College different: that it
believes that colleges can be built
without walls and that they can
be an integrated part of the
community. The faculty and
students are deciding on various
ways of implementing this
philosophy. v
One of the examples is that a
student who plans to become an
elementary school teacher may
spend one half of his first year
working in East Palo Alto Day
School and in the Elementary
Schools, one fourth of his time
taking traditional courses at
Stanford University, and one
fourth of his time doing
independent course work with the
County Board of Education. A
student who plans to rebuild East
Palo Alto to better suit the needs
of the community might spend
one fourth of his time at the
College of San Mateo studying
drafting, one half time working
with local architects, and one
fourth time studying sociology
and mathematics at Nairobi.
Relevancy
This is just an example of how
the faculty and students at
Nairobi are going to keep their
education relevant to their
community. They will continue to
build for the future with esteem
for traditional "knowledge," but
with pragmatic emphasis on the
present experiences of vbeing.
