# Letter To The Editor
## Nairobi Book Drive 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY :
The problem at hand can be
stated very simplyâ€”Nairobi High
School and Nairobi College need
books. Needless to say, the
Stanford Community has books.
The question then, is what will it
take to get the white Stanford
Community to give books to the
Nairobi High School and College.
Too often, we have heard
frustrated white cries of "what
can we do?" Now is the chance
for white people to "do"
something. Many of us blacks
realize that whites will not
participate in anything concerning
black liberation unless they can
control it. If this white attitude
still persists, then there will be an
eventual confrontation between

white and black. Black people
have resolved to control their own
lives. Whites must accept that. It
is ironic that we should have to go
such great lengths to encourage
white folks to give up their books.
But such are the ironies of dealing
with a racist society. There is no
excuse for lack of participation in
this book drive. Consequently, if
participation is low, it will only be
another strike against the
Stanford Community. And I can
assure you, we as black people are
keeping track of the strikes. Need
anymore be said?

Censorship
Editor, THE DAILY:
Call it censorship or something

else with a prettier title but no
less odious implication: The
recent decision of the Publications
Board to nEQUIRE the Daily to
clear potentially controversial
material with University or other
legal counsel, represents in
principle, a step backwards in a
university supposedly seeking to
liberate itself. The fact that this
step was initiated by part of the
ASSU Executive is unfortunate.
TTie lesson for the Daily is too
free itself as quickly as possible
from the ASSU, from the
university, and from censorship,
and to become an independent
journal, following the example of
the Harvard Crimson and the
Coltim hia Spec tutor.
