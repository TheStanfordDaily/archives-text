# Prof Says Chicanos Lack Support
## 
### MURIEL CYRUS 
The Chicano movement has
been suppressed and lacks popular
support, according to a San Jose
Stae Professor.
Professor Feliciano Rivera
emphasized the lack of unity
within the Chicano movement in
an address last Thursday before
members of the Latin American
Students' Association (LASA) and
the Mexican-American Students'
Association (MECHA).
Citing the lack of a common
uniting factor for Chicanos,
Rivere said that even the meaning
of the word "Chicano" differs in
various parts of the
Mexican-American community.
"The Chicano movement
started as an offshoot of the black
civil rights movement," he said,
"but lacks the nationwide
appeal." Rivera pointed out that
knowledge of the Chicano
movement is largely confined to
the West and Southwest.
"The black man is the white
man's burden, but the Chicano is
only an intruder."
Summing up progress thus far,
Rivera said that "this is not a
revolution, for nothing has
happened to justify calling it a
revolution. It is not a new thing.
It has existed, but has been
completely supressed. Only in the
mining and agricultural areas has
there been evidence of resistance,
but the Chicano community as a
whole has not joined the
movement."
According to Rivera, the
challenge of the movement is to
organize the youth and unite the
movement. He pointed out that
the Chicano community is stirred
to action only by drastic events,
and it is hard to convince the
people that they are being
exploited. "Must one stage the
massacre of a few Chicano youths
to bring the community to its
feet?" he asked.
Professor Rivera cited the
"Third World" movement in New
Mexico as an example of an
attempt at action. Leaders of this
movement are seeking to have the
Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo
invalidated and to regain the
territory for third world people.
Rivera received his degree from
the University of New Mexico, a
Master's in Spanish from the
University of Denver, and a
Master's in History from the
University of Colorado.
He is presently an Associate
Professor at San Jose State
specializing in Contemporary
Mexico and Mexican History.
Rivera has worked for six years in
East Los Angeles as a community
liason for the Department of
Urban Affairs, and is currently
working towards his Ph.D.
