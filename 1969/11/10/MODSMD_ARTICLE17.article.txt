# 'Beclch' Lays Bare Civilized Soul
## 
### JIM SPICKARD 
"The Marquis de Sade is so disgustingly pat,"a
member of the Beta Chi Community for the
Performing Arts told me after a preview of
Itochelle Owens' Beclch, opening tomorrow at 8
p.m. at the Beta Chi house, 624 San Juan.
"But that really isn't the point!"
And while the West Coast Premiere of this play
may seem to outdo that good gentlemen of
Charenton, we must look beneath the surface at
the picture of ourselves so displayed.
Set among the "savages of Africa," Beclch is a
laying bare of the soul of supposedly "civilized"
man.
It is a portrayal of the disintegration of man
into the polarities of corruption and
innocence—the two supports of human
personality, without which creation, or even
action, is impossible.
Human Perversion
Queen Beclch is the expression of human
perversion and aggressiveness. Played by Louise
Shimmel, she is the "white" ruler of a native
kingdom, who dominates and terrorizes her
subjects, imposes upon them the power of her
animal nature.
She is the wolf, who slaughters and maims
those who cross her path as much to prove that
she is not susceptible to "human" considerations
as to satisfy her own unihibited sensuality. An
anti-Christ, she displays the natural depravity
which most of us attempt to deny in ourselves.
Her two foils, Yago (Jody Schepps) and Jose
(Greg Martinelli) are, on the other hand, each
expressions of innocence—though in vastly
differing forms.
Masterful Creator
Yago, the weakling, the subservient one, is a
romantic idealist, wishing to be important, to hold
power, and with it to be loving and tender. He
does not want to dominate and destroy, but rather
to be the masterful creator. Yet he is unable to
deal with Beclch's cruelty, and tries to wish it out
of existence. He tries to deny the destructive side
of life, and is consumed by it.
Beclch toys with him, makes him a powerless
"king," inflicts him with elephantiasis, and at last
decrees his death by his own hand, a fate to which
he submits because he cannot offer any
alternative.
Jose, on the other hand, is the ideal of boyish
purity. He too is led by Beclch, hurt by her, made
"king" without power. Yet he never descends to
the shining survility that was Yago, and retains a
power over her which only the impotence of pure
corruption in the face of pure innocence can
explain. When he leaves her at the end of the play,
she willingly, even joyfully, submits to death.
Corruption and Innocence
As in Conrad's Heart of Darkness, it is the
supposedly "civilized" man in whom the polarity
of corruption and innocence is portrayed.
In the portrayal of human of corruption and
human innocence it is natural that the former
receive the most treatment.
Beclch's perversions and cruelty must be
strongly stressed, if the viewer is to later place
them in perspective. Her murders must shock, her
corrupt sexuality must offend.
Audience Involvement
But for this reason Beclch is a hard play with
which to get the audience involved. Too many are
turned away before they see their own desires in
Beclch's rapaciousness.
The script is largely to blame, as Rochelle
Ownes has filled the opening section with
numerous lines of meaning, from which the viewer

is left dangling until later in the play. One has little
sense of what is going on.
No general intellectual context is established to
orient one to the subject matter; Beclch's actions
become impossible to comprehend without such a
context, and so are not accepted.
Breaking of Rules
While it is generally desirable to avoid
over-intellectualization at the outset of a theatrical
effort, the necessity to involve the audience at
once in the particular piece is great enough to
warrant a breaking of the rules.
Often the lack of an intellectual framework will
force an especially intellectually-oriented
audience—a Stanford audience-Ho attempt to
construct its own, to the detrement of its
involvement in the play itself.
In order to overcome, the Beta Chi troupe has
opened the play with a ritual dance in which it has
tried to create audience enthusiasm. Let in
blindfolded, the viewer discovers himself in a
jungle alive with the sound of congas. The players
girate wildly in a bawdy ritual, and when the
music stops Beclch begins to lay her path of
destruction.
This succeeds to some extent, and other changes
made in the first act have considerably improved
the performace.

The opening act is still scarred, however, by the
somewhat spotty performance of Jody Schepps as
Yago. Moments of skill are achieved but he seems
unable to display the fervor necessary to entice the
audience into involvement.
Anti-Christ, Corruption
However, the exceptional skills of the other
actors triumph over the failings of the script, and
most of the audience is fully involved with the
show. The superficial Sade-like perversions no
longer turn one away, and one becomes aware that
one is laughing the anti-Christ, the corruption in
oneself.
Louise Shimmel deserves most of the credit for
this. Her portrayal of Beclch arouses the audience
to an awareness of "the wolf" in themselves. They
are disgusted by her, yet enjoy watching her
cruelty.
Perhaps the most terrifying performance is
presented by the Ensemble, who dance in the
background and on the wings throughout the
show, lending support to Beclch as well as
imitating the main action. As the animal instinct,
they rise up at the end of the play to pull Beclch
down, but only after they have destroyed in the
audience any illusions of innocence that might
have been brought into the theater.
In all it is a very successful show.
