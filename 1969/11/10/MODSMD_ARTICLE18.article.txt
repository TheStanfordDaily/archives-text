# Cinematic Variety in Campus Films

### TODD McCARTHY 
This week's film schedule offers
superb performances by Katharine
Hepburn and Charles Laughton

and important works by Godard,
Antonioni and Ichikawa.
It's a mixed bag at this week's
experimental film series at 9 p.m.
in the art auditorium. Being
shown are Potpourri, Saturday
4:15:67, Custom Machine & Be
True to Your School, The Lady's
Room and Robert Nelson's
''soft-core pornography,"
Confessions of a Black Mother
Succuba.
After showing a 20 minute
Laurel and Hardy short, Men
O'War, Clive Miller will present
the intermitantly charming but
incredibly static Morning Glory,
which offers Katharine Hepburn

in her first Academy
Award-winning performance. The
third feature on Tuesday in
Geology 320 is Merbyn Le√üoy's
Two Seconds, starring Edward G.
Robinson.
The classic Red Shoes, this
week's feature at Tresidder's
ballet and opera film series, stars
Miora Shearer, Leonide Massine
and Maruis Goring and will be
shown Wednesday at 7:30 and
8:30.
Kagi, this week's International
Center film, was poorly treated by
critics and audiences when it was
released in the states. Nonetheless,
it is a highly amusing study of
pornography and a genuinely
erotic colour film. In Cubberley at
7:45 on Thursday.
Godard's Alphaville, in
Tesidder Friday, is interesting
because of Eddie Constantine and
Anna Karina and the director's
futuristic use of modern Paris as
the setting. However, many of the
situations and dialogues are
remarkably hackneyed and some
of it is downright dull.
Nothing But a Man, directed in
1963 by Michael Roemer, is the
story of a young black couple
trying to get on in a small
southern community. It will be
shown Friday at 7:30 and 9:30 in
Cubberley. t
The Private Life of llenry VIII,
is a lusty lavish 1933 British
spectacle with Charles Laughton
giving one of the most
magnificent performances in film
history. At Tresidder on Saturday.

After a slight delay,
Antonioni's Blow Up will finally
be shown this Saturday in
Cubberley at 7, 9 and 11.
Elvira Madigan may represent
the ultimate in mindless lyricism

in the contemporary cinema,
though it was only during my
second viewing that the
Scandanavian pastels, idyllic
strolls and Mozart theme became
suffocating. Sunday in Mem Aud.
