# Employees Seek Support
## 
### ED KOHN 
About 30 employees of
Stanford's Physical Plant met
Thursday night with Jack
McLaughlin, a representative of
the Teamsters Union, to discuss
ways of gaining union recognition
within the plant.
The meeting, called on one
day's notice, was organized by
Keith Strothers, a steamfitter in
teh plant. McLaughlin is a
business representative of local
856 of the Freight Checkers,
Clerical Employees and Helpers
Union, which is affiliated with the
International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. Local 856 has its
headquarters in San Francisco.
Although less than half of the
plant's 65 employees were present
at the meeting, Strothers said that
the union had support within the
plant and that "over 50 percent
supports this union and the idea
of voting for representation." The
plant employees are plumbers,
steamfitters and sheet-metal
workers.
The most pressing issue of the
meeting was the question of job
security, especially in light of the
carpenter and painter layoffs that
have been threatened by the
university administration.
No carpenters or painters were
present at the meeting. Several
plant employees, speaking from
the floor, said that this was due to
the attitude that "if I don't go to
the meeting, maybe they'll keep
me."
McLaughlin said that "if a
layoff is legitimate, there is
nothing we can do about it." He
noted that a contract negotiated
by the Teamsters would include
clauses forbidding subcontracting
jobs for which there are existing
employees and provisions would
have to be made for institution of
job retraining, a seniority system,
and bidding on other jobs in other
departments when the employees
there don't have as much
seniority. He also said that the
teamsters megotiate high
severance pay for their members.
Hitter Towards Administration
Much bitterness was expressed
towards the administration and

the managers in the plant. "In our
plant, we're intimidated," said
one elderly employee. Another
worker, a woman, said that the
men in charge of the plant are
"straw bossesâ€”military men who
want to run the show" and
accused them of "putting the
screws on." Their remarks were
met by silently nodding heads
throughout the lecture hall.
Anti-student feelings ran fairly
high throughout the meeting, with
one man saying that he wanted
"no student involvement. They

don't have a problem of their own
and they don't put butter on my
table."
McLaughlin said that there are
presently no national unions on
campus, but that printshop
employees have a special
"agreement" with the Stanford
administration. The last time a
union tried for recognition was in
1965, when a group tried to
organize SLAC employees. The
move was unsuccessful, however,
as the National Labor Relations
Board ruled that it could not

force elections at SLAC because it
is part of a non-profit
corporation.
The Teamsters presently are
recognized on several campuses,
with Fordham University and
Penn State being two of their
biggest organizations.
In Strong Position
McLaughlin said that there are
many ways that the union could
force Stanford into granting a
recognition election if there was
enough genuine support for the
union within the plant. He said
that Stanford cannot refuse to
grant the "right of organization
and collective bargaining." He
noted that the employees are in a
strong position because
"everything that comes in and
goes out is delivered by a
Teamster."
He said that the union wants to
'get our foot in the door" and
eventually organize as many
university employees as possible
He mentioned the cafeteru
employees as other prospects foi
joining the union. McLaughlin
said that the number of
employees wishing to join
immediately was "immaterial, but
the more, the better." He said
that as more employees join the
union, their bargaining position
will be stronger.
To gain recognition from the
Stanford administration, 30
percent of the group wishing to
recognize and be represented by
the union must sign an
"authorization form," a legal
document that does not require
tham to support or vote for the
union. Then, at least 51 percent
of the employee group must vote
to support the union in a secret
ballot.
Authorization forms were
passed out at the conclusion of
the meeting. Additional forms are
available from Strothers, who said
that another meeting would be
held in about two weeks. The
Thursday night meeting received
little publicity because the group
had difficulty finding a place to
hold its session.
