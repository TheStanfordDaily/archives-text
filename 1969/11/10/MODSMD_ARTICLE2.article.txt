# Grape Ban Continues
## 
### 
The ghost of grapes, absent
from campus for fifteen months,
re-appeared mysteriously last
Hallow's Eve in the form of fruit
cocktail served at the Stern
dining halls, the Row houses, and
Tresidder cafeteria.
The grapevine also had it that
fresh table grapes were served at
Stern. This rumor, however,
proved to be totally untrue.
According to Miss Maxine
Anderson, assistant manager of
the University Food Service, fresh
grapes have not been served on
campus since a September, 1968
student referendum asked that
they be withdrawn from the
menu.
The serving of fruit cocktail
with grapes in it, though possible,
was "certainly a mistake," Miss
Anderson said. All fruit salad
containing grapes was sent back to
commissary after representatives
of MECHA, the Mexican-Amer
ican Students Association,
informed the Food Service that
canned grapes are as taboo as
fresh ones, a situation that the
Food Service people had been
unaware of.
The cocktail that was served
probably came from a few cans
that were overlooked when the
products to be boycotted were
purged and sent back to where
they came from.
The situation now has been
completely rectified, and no
grapes, either fresh or in fruit
cocktail, will be served by the
Food Service until the strike
against the vineyard owners is
over and the boycott lifted.
