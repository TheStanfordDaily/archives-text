# Committee Meets
## New Dean Sought 
### 
The first meeting of the
committee searching for
Stanford's first undergraduate
dean was convened Thursday by
President Pitzer.
The group, which includes
three students, was told by the
university president that while the
committee should not rule out
other possibilities, "it is our view
that the Dean should be sought
from within the University and
from the Faculty of the School of
Humanities and Sciences."
The new dean must work
closely with his counterparts in
Humanities and Sciences, Eartn
Sciences and Engineering,
although he is to report directly
to the Provost and the Presient.
Referring to the procedural
suggestions of the Senate
Committee on Committees,
President Pitzer emphasized the
need for a much openness as
possible in making selections.
Efforts will be made to contact
faculty and students for
suggestions and for information
on the suitability of candidates,
he said.
The deliberations of the
committee will be confidential,

however, "to avoid
embarrassment to potential
candidates."
Suggestions by interested
students or faculty are welcome
by the committee for the new
post, which was suggested in
Report on Undergraduate
Education prepared last year by
the Study of Education at
Stanford committee.
Chairman of the committee is
Physics Professor M.R. Yearian.
Student members are Marshall
Kilduff, Bradley Mac Lean and
Philip Taubman.
Others are Chemistry Professor
Lawrence J. Altman, Vice
President and Provost Richard
Lyman; Law Professor Herbert L.
Packer; English Professor
Lawrence V. Ryan, Associate
Dean of Humanities and Sciences;
Mechanical Engineering Professor
William C. Reynolds; History
Professor Lewis Spitz; and
Sociology Professor Morris
Zelditch, Jr.
The next meeting of the
committee is slated for Nov. 20.
