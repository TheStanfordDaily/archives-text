Every book ever written has
dealt with sex, Assistant English
Professor Larry Friedlander told
over 200 persons in the Tresidder
Large Lounge Thursday night.
"Language fteefs impelled to
deal with sex. Sex is expressed in
every book of literature that has
ever been written," the Stanford
professor said during his hour-long
discussion of sexual anxiety of
Western culture.
Friedlander dealt extensively
with the question of what it is in
the sexual act that arouses our
anxiety. The primary anxiety,
according to Friedlander, is that
"we want to be one with the
other person, and yet we fear
losing our sense of self "
As an introduction to the
subject of sex in leterature,
Friedlander read aloud the poem
"Leda and the Swan" byYates,
which tells of the rape of a young
woman, Leda, by the Greek jod

Jupiter, who is a swan.
Friedlander also discussed the
sexual aspects of Dante's writings
and of Shakespeare's "Romeo and
Juliet."
Friedlander stated that sex in
literature today is deeply involved
with pornography. "Pornographic
literature is being used today as an
attempt at social revolution," he
said. "It proposes radical changes
in sexual experience, and this
forces people to consider
possibilities other than the family
or the couple as their sexual
premise," Friedlander explained.
Modern pornography, said
Friedlander, is an expression of
the fear persons have of being
mere objects in the sexual act.
One of the purposes of
literature is to save and transform
sexual experiences according to
Friedlander. He explained that
language is able to juxtapose the
future and the moment of sex.
"The artist can rescue the
experience for you," he said.
