# Sloppy Day For Winning Tribe
## 
### FRED MANN 
It's a good thing Stanford was
playing the last place team in the
league on Saturday.
In a game that the experts said
would be a breeze for the Indians,
the winless, depressed, and
divided Washington Huskies
almost pulled off a miracle. TV
viewers all along the coast, tuning
in to see the 12th rated Tribe set
even more offensive records
against the Huskies were probably
disappointed.
The only record Stanford came
close to was that of most
penalties, as they downed
Washington, 21-7 in an uninspired
ball game.
"It was a sloppy game," said
quarterback Jim Plunkett who
himself enjoyed a fine afternoon.
On a very cold and rainy "typical
Washington football Saturday,"
Plunkett hit on 24 of 35 attempts
and passed for the 30th
touchdown of his career. He was
voted "Outstanding Back of the
Game."
"I'm sorry this was our TV
game," he said.
Despite the surprisingly close
score, the outcome was never
really in doubt. In fact, the
outcome was decided before the
season even began. Even the
Seattle press found it hard to talk
about an upset.
Jim Owens is going through
the biggest crisis of his career. But
even with a team short on talent
(compared to the Indians), and
torn by racial strife, the powerful
Owens had his team up and ready
for Stanford.
John Ralston had his team
ready too. Perhaps too ready. "I
think maybe I overdid it,"he
remarked. "I had the team up for
Washington. We had to be,
because they are capable of
beating anyone. But we were over
anxious. The boys just couldn't
relax."
The result was 147 yards in
penalties against the Tribe. The
Pac-8 record is 163 yards against
Washington in 1959.
Time and again Stanford drives
would be stopped in Washington
territory by clipping or holding
infractions. UW was penalized 12
yards.
Ralston had no qualms. "It was
a well officiated game. We don't
worry about the penalties. We
were just trying too hard."

Bubba Brown was hurt most by
the constant flag-dropping. In one
of his best games of the year, the
senior halfback officially totaled
59 yards, but had runs of 29 and
14 yards (one for a touchdown)
called back.
Stanford got on the board first
when Plunkett went over right
guard himself in the first period.
Tim Mclure set up the score,
pouncing on a UW fumble at the
Stanford 49.
The Indians, forced to punt the
first two times they had the ball,
did not miss this opportunity.
Plunkett hit Randy Vataha and
Howie Williams on strikes of 11
and 16 yards, and Bubba Brown
skirted right end for 27 to the
one-yard line. Plunkett took it
from there.
The Huskies tallied their seven
points in the second quarter with
great assistance from the Cards.
Bob Lovlein picked off a wayward
Pluckett pass at the Stanford 40.
Washington quarterback Gene
Willis, a poor passer, was helped
out with a pass interference
penalty called on the visitors.
Miles Moore clobbered the
receiver at the 5 yard line, and
leading ground gainer Bo Cornell
carried it in from there to tie the
score. (Willis was 2-8 passing.)
The Tribe took the ensuing
kickoff, and with passes to Vataha
and great tight end Bob Moore,
set up another score. Jackie
Brown carried to the nine, but
again a clipping penalty pushed
the Indians back.
Given great protection by his
offensive line, Plunkett had hours
to pass the ball, and found Vataha
running past everyone down the
right sidelines. They connected on
a 26-yarder for a score, and Steve
Horowitz converted for a seven
point halftime lead.
By intermission, the pattern
had been set. Plunkett was
throwing well, his receivers
(especially Moore) were making
great catches, and the running
game was strong up the middle.
Washington defensed the
Stanford sweeps well, but
offensively, the Huskies were
dormant. Their fine runners were
hampered by lack of a passing
attack. The Tribe defense was able
to key on a run and stop the play
early.
Of course the penalties
mounted. Stanford had been set

back a full 100 yards by the half.
Three long passes to Moore and
a 15-yard jaunt by Bubba Brown
set up the final score midway
through the third period. Brown
scored this one himself on a leap
from IVi yards away.
Washington, down by 14, was
forced to pass, and never
challenged from the point on.
They operated from deep within
their own territory, and met a
Stanford pass rush that had
unnerved better teams.
Pat Preston, the Outstanding
Lineman of the Game, was
everywhere for the Tribe. He
contributed 23 tackles, 16 of

them unassisted. Don Parish
added his share with 22, and
McClure was excellent, coming up
with 11.
The injured Jim Kauffman saw
action briefly as a defensive
halfback, and intercepted a pass
on his second series in the game.
Hillary Shockley performed
well in replacing Williams who left
the game at the start of the third
quarter with a hip pointer. The
injury is not serious, but Miles
Moore and Bob Reinhart
sustained knee and neck wounds.
Many players came up with
bruises and pains on the Huskie
Astroturf.
The field was much harder than
last week's carpet at Oregon State.
"It (the field) is worn down," said
Bob Moore after Friday's practice
at the stadium. "It's hard to cut
or get your footing. The rain
doesn't help either. I'm kind of
worried."
As it turned out, Moore was
anything but bothered Saturday.

He was the game's leading receiver
with eight catches for 111 yards.
He freed himself all day up the
middle on hook patterns, as
Stanford concentrated on beating
Washington's single linebacker
defense.
An officially estimated crowd
of 48,000 people (actually it was
closer to 33,000) sat in the wet
and 47 degree weather. It was the
smallest crowd in two years. (The
game was on TV in Seattle.)
In pre-game introductions,
Coach Owens received a
deafening ovation from all
segments of the crowdâ€”student
section as well as general
admission. He seems to have
Seattle and half of the UW
student body on his side in the
battle over the four suspended
black athletes.
The introductions of
Co-captain Lee Brock and Gary
Carr, the only blacks on the
Washington starting defense, drew
mixed boos.

had been set. Plunkett was
throwing well, his receivers
(especially Moore) were making
great catches, and the running
game was strong up the middle.
Washington defensed the
Stanford sweeps well, but
offensively, the Huskies were
dormant. Their fine runners were
hampered by lack of a passing
attack. The Tribe defense was able
to key on a run and stop the play
early.
Of course the penalties
mounted. Stanford had been set

back a full 100 yards by the half.
Three long passes to Moore and
a 15-yard jaunt by Bubba Brown
set up the final score midway
through the third period. Brown
scored this one himself on a leap
from IVi yards away.
Washington, down by 14, was
forced to pass, and never
challenged from the point on.
They operated from deep within
their own territory, and met a
Stanford pass rush that had
unnerved better teams.
Pat Preston, the Outstanding
Lineman of the Game, was
everywhere for the Tribe. He
contributed 23 tackles, 16 of

them unassisted. Don Parish
added his share with 22, and
McClure was excellent, coming up
with 11.
The injured Jim Kauffman saw
action briefly as a defensive
halfback, and intercepted a pass
on his second series in the game.
Hillary Shockley performed
well in replacing Williams who left
the game at the start of the third
quarter with a hip pointer. The
injury is not serious, but Miles
Moore and Bob Reinhart
sustained knee and neck wounds.
Many players came up with
bruises and pains on the Huskie
Astroturf.
The field was much harder than
last week's carpet at Oregon State.
"It (the field) is worn down," said
Bob Moore after Friday's practice
at the stadium. "It's hard to cut
or get your footing. The rain
doesn't help either. I'm kind of
worried."
As it turned out, Moore was
anything but bothered Saturday.

He was the game's leading receiver
with eight catches for 111 yards.
He freed himself all day up the
middle on hook patterns, as
Stanford concentrated on beating
Washington's single linebacker
defense.
An officially estimated crowd
of 48,000 people (actually it was
closer to 33,000) sat in the wet
and 47 degree weather. It was the
smallest crowd in two years. (The
game was on TV in Seattle.)
In pre-game introductions,
Coach Owens received a
deafening ovation from all
segments of the crowdâ€”student
section as well as general
admission. He seems to have
Seattle and half of the UW
student body on his side in the
battle over the four suspended
black athletes.
The introductions of
Co-captain Lee Brock and Gary
Carr, the only blacks on the
Washington starting defense, drew
mixed boos.
It's a good thing Stanford was
playing the last place team in the
league on Saturday.
In a game that the experts said
would be a breeze for the Indians,
the winless, depressed, and
divided Washington Huskies
almost pulled off a miracle. TV
viewers all along the coast, tuning
in to see the 12th rated Tribe set
even more offensive records
against the Huskies were probably
disappointed.
The only record Stanford came
close to was that of most
penalties, as they downed
Washington, 21-7 in an uninspired
ball game.
"It was a sloppy game," said
quarterback Jim Plunkett who
himself enjoyed a fine afternoon.
On a very cold and rainy "typical
Washington football Saturday,"
Plunkett hit on 24 of 35 attempts
and passed for the 30th
touchdown of his career. He was
voted "Outstanding Back of the
Game."
"I'm sorry this was our TV
game," he said.
Despite the surprisingly close
score, the outcome was never
really in doubt. In fact, the
outcome was decided before the
season even began. Even the
Seattle press found it hard to talk
about an upset.
Jim Owens is going through
the biggest crisis of his career. But
even with a team short on talent
(compared to the Indians), and
torn by racial strife, the powerful
Owens had his team up and ready
for Stanford.
John Ralston had his team
ready too. Perhaps too ready. "I
think maybe I overdid it,"he
remarked. "I had the team up for
Washington. We had to be,
because they are capable of
beating anyone. But we were over
anxious. The boys just couldn't
relax."
The result was 147 yards in
penalties against the Tribe. The
Pac-8 record is 163 yards against
Washington in 1959.
Time and again Stanford drives
would be stopped in Washington
territory by clipping or holding
infractions. UW was penalized 12
yards.
Ralston had no qualms. "It was
a well officiated game. We don't
worry about the penalties. We
were just trying too hard."

Bubba Brown was hurt most by
the constant flag-dropping. In one
of his best games of the year, the
senior halfback officially totaled
59 yards, but had runs of 29 and
14 yards (one for a touchdown)
called back.
Stanford got on the board first
when Plunkett went over right
guard himself in the first period.
Tim Mclure set up the score,
pouncing on a UW fumble at the
Stanford 49.
The Indians, forced to punt the
first two times they had the ball,
did not miss this opportunity.
Plunkett hit Randy Vataha and
Howie Williams on strikes of 11
and 16 yards, and Bubba Brown
skirted right end for 27 to the
one-yard line. Plunkett took it
from there.
The Huskies tallied their seven
points in the second quarter with
great assistance from the Cards.
Bob Lovlein picked off a wayward
Pluckett pass at the Stanford 40.
Washington quarterback Gene
Willis, a poor passer, was helped
out with a pass interference
penalty called on the visitors.
Miles Moore clobbered the
receiver at the 5 yard line, and
leading ground gainer Bo Cornell
carried it in from there to tie the
score. (Willis was 2-8 passing.)
The Tribe took the ensuing
kickoff, and with passes to Vataha
and great tight end Bob Moore,
set up another score. Jackie
Brown carried to the nine, but
again a clipping penalty pushed
the Indians back.
Given great protection by his
offensive line, Plunkett had hours
to pass the ball, and found Vataha
running past everyone down the
right sidelines. They connected on
a 26-yarder for a score, and Steve
Horowitz converted for a seven
point halftime lead.

Seattle press found it hard to talk
about an upset.
Jim Owens is going through
the biggest crisis of his career. But
even with a team short on talent
(compared to the Indians), and
torn by racial strife, the powerful
Owens had his team up and ready
for Stanford.
John Ralston had his team
ready too. Perhaps too ready. "I
think maybe I overdid it,"he
remarked. "I had the team up for
Washington. We had to be,
because they are capable of
beating anyone. But we were over
anxious. The boys just couldn't
relax."
The result was 147 yards in
penalties against the Tribe. The
Pac-8 record is 163 yards against
Washington in 1959.
Time and again Stanford drives
would be stopped in Washington
territory by clipping or holding
infractions. UW was penalized 12
yards.
Ralston had no qualms. "It was
a well officiated game. We don't
worry about the penalties. We
were just trying too hard."

Bubba Brown was hurt most by
the constant flag-dropping. In one
of his best games of the year, the
senior halfback officially totaled
59 yards, but had runs of 29 and
14 yards (one for a touchdown)
called back.
Stanford got on the board first
when Plunkett went over right
guard himself in the first period.
Tim Mclure set up the score,
pouncing on a UW fumble at the
Stanford 49.
The Indians, forced to punt the
first two times they had the ball,
did not miss this opportunity.
Plunkett hit Randy Vataha and
Howie Williams on strikes of 11
and 16 yards, and Bubba Brown
skirted right end for 27 to the
one-yard line. Plunkett took it
from there.
The Huskies tallied their seven
points in the second quarter with
great assistance from the Cards.
Bob Lovlein picked off a wayward
Pluckett pass at the Stanford 40.
Washington quarterback Gene
Willis, a poor passer, was helped
out with a pass interference
penalty called on the visitors.
Miles Moore clobbered the
receiver at the 5 yard line, and
leading ground gainer Bo Cornell
carried it in from there to tie the
score. (Willis was 2-8 passing.)
The Tribe took the ensuing
kickoff, and with passes to Vataha
and great tight end Bob Moore,
set up another score. Jackie
Brown carried to the nine, but
again a clipping penalty pushed
the Indians back.
Given great protection by his
offensive line, Plunkett had hours
to pass the ball, and found Vataha
running past everyone down the
right sidelines. They connected on
a 26-yarder for a score, and Steve
Horowitz converted for a seven
point halftime lead.
By intermission, the pattern
had been set. Plunkett was
throwing well, his receivers
(especially Moore) were making
great catches, and the running
game was strong up the middle.
Washington defensed the
Stanford sweeps well, but
offensively, the Huskies were
dormant. Their fine runners were
hampered by lack of a passing
attack. The Tribe defense was able
to key on a run and stop the play
early.
Of course the penalties
mounted. Stanford had been set

back a full 100 yards by the half.
Three long passes to Moore and
a 15-yard jaunt by Bubba Brown
set up the final score midway
through the third period. Brown
scored this one himself on a leap
from IVi yards away.
Washington, down by 14, was
forced to pass, and never
challenged from the point on.
They operated from deep within
their own territory, and met a
Stanford pass rush that had
unnerved better teams.
Pat Preston, the Outstanding
Lineman of the Game, was
everywhere for the Tribe. He
contributed 23 tackles, 16 of

them unassisted. Don Parish
added his share with 22, and
McClure was excellent, coming up
with 11.
The injured Jim Kauffman saw
action briefly as a defensive
halfback, and intercepted a pass
on his second series in the game.
Hillary Shockley performed
well in replacing Williams who left
the game at the start of the third
quarter with a hip pointer. The
injury is not serious, but Miles
Moore and Bob Reinhart
sustained knee and neck wounds.
Many players came up with
bruises and pains on the Huskie
Astroturf.
The field was much harder than
last week's carpet at Oregon State.
"It (the field) is worn down," said
Bob Moore after Friday's practice
at the stadium. "It's hard to cut
or get your footing. The rain
doesn't help either. I'm kind of
worried."
As it turned out, Moore was
anything but bothered Saturday.

He was the game's leading receiver
with eight catches for 111 yards.
He freed himself all day up the
middle on hook patterns, as
Stanford concentrated on beating
Washington's single linebacker
defense.
An officially estimated crowd
of 48,000 people (actually it was
closer to 33,000) sat in the wet
and 47 degree weather. It was the
smallest crowd in two years. (The
game was on TV in Seattle.)
In pre-game introductions,
Coach Owens received a
deafening ovation from all
segments of the crowdâ€”student
section as well as general
admission. He seems to have
Seattle and half of the UW
student body on his side in the
battle over the four suspended
black athletes.
The introductions of
Co-captain Lee Brock and Gary
Carr, the only blacks on the
Washington starting defense, drew
mixed boos.
It's a good thing Stanford was
playing the last place team in the
league on Saturday.
In a game that the experts said
would be a breeze for the Indians,
the winless, depressed, and
divided Washington Huskies
almost pulled off a miracle. TV
viewers all along the coast, tuning
in to see the 12th rated Tribe set
even more offensive records
against the Huskies were probably
disappointed.
The only record Stanford came
close to was that of most
penalties, as they downed
Washington, 21-7 in an uninspired
ball game.
"It was a sloppy game," said
quarterback Jim Plunkett who
himself enjoyed a fine afternoon.
On a very cold and rainy "typical
Washington football Saturday,"
Plunkett hit on 24 of 35 attempts
and passed for the 30th
touchdown of his career. He was
voted "Outstanding Back of the
Game."
"I'm sorry this was our TV
game," he said.

really in doubt. In fact, the

McClure was excellent, coming up
with 11.
The injured Jim Kauffman saw
action briefly as a defensive
halfback, and intercepted a pass
on his second series in the game.
Hillary Shockley performed
well in replacing Williams who left
the game at the start of the third
quarter with a hip pointer. The
injury is not serious, but Miles
Moore and Bob Reinhart
sustained knee and neck wounds.
Many players came up with
bruises and pains on the Huskie
Astroturf.
The field was much harder than
last week's carpet at Oregon State.
"It (the field) is worn down," said
Bob Moore after Friday's practice
at the stadium. "It's hard to cut
or get your footing. The rain
doesn't help either. I'm kind of
worried."
As it turned out, Moore was
anything but bothered Saturday.

He was the game's leading receiver
with eight catches for 111 yards.
He freed himself all day up the
middle on hook patterns, as
Stanford concentrated on beating
Washington's single linebacker
defense.
An officially estimated crowd
of 48,000 people (actually it was
closer to 33,000) sat in the wet
and 47 degree weather. It was the
smallest crowd in two years. (The
game was on TV in Seattle.)
In pre-game introductions,
Coach Owens received a
deafening ovation from all
segments of the crowdâ€”student
section as well as general
admission. He seems to have
Seattle and half of the UW
student body on his side in the
battle over the four suspended
black athletes.
The introductions of
Co-captain Lee Brock and Gary
Carr, the only blacks on the
Washington starting defense, drew
mixed boos.
It's a good thing Stanford was
playing the last place team in the
league on Saturday.
In a game that the experts said
would be a breeze for the Indians,
the winless, depressed, and
divided Washington Huskies
almost pulled off a miracle. TV
viewers all along the coast, tuning
in to see the 12th rated Tribe set
even more offensive records
against the Huskies were probably
disappointed.
The only record Stanford came
close to was that of most
penalties, as they downed
Washington, 21-7 in an uninspired
ball game.
"It was a sloppy game," said
quarterback Jim Plunkett who
himself enjoyed a fine afternoon.
On a very cold and rainy "typical
Washington football Saturday,"
Plunkett hit on 24 of 35 attempts
and passed for the 30th
touchdown of his career. He was
voted "Outstanding Back of the
Game."
"I'm sorry this was our TV
game," he said.
Despite the surprisingly close
score, the outcome was never
really in doubt. In fact, the
outcome was decided before the
season even began. Even the
Seattle press found it hard to talk
about an upset.
Jim Owens is going through
the biggest crisis of his career. But
even with a team short on talent
(compared to the Indians), and
torn by racial strife, the powerful
Owens had his team up and ready
for Stanford.
John Ralston had his team
ready too. Perhaps too ready. "I
think maybe I overdid it,"he
remarked. "I had the team up for
Washington. We had to be,
because they are capable of
beating anyone. But we were over
anxious. The boys just couldn't
relax."
The result was 147 yards in
penalties against the Tribe. The
Pac-8 record is 163 yards against
Washington in 1959.
Time and again Stanford drives
would be stopped in Washington
territory by clipping or holding
infractions. UW was penalized 12
yards.
Ralston had no qualms. "It was
a well officiated game. We don't
worry about the penalties. We
were just trying too hard."

Bubba Brown was hurt most by
the constant flag-dropping. In one
of his best games of the year, the
senior halfback officially totaled
59 yards, but had runs of 29 and
14 yards (one for a touchdown)
called back.
Stanford got on the board first
when Plunkett went over right
guard himself in the first period.
Tim Mclure set up the score,
pouncing on a UW fumble at the
Stanford 49.
The Indians, forced to punt the
first two times they had the ball,
did not miss this opportunity.
Plunkett hit Randy Vataha and
Howie Williams on strikes of 11
and 16 yards, and Bubba Brown
skirted right end for 27 to the
one-yard line. Plunkett took it
from there.
The Huskies tallied their seven
points in the second quarter with
great assistance from the Cards.
Bob Lovlein picked off a wayward
Pluckett pass at the Stanford 40.
Washington quarterback Gene
Willis, a poor passer, was helped
out with a pass interference
penalty called on the visitors.
Miles Moore clobbered the
receiver at the 5 yard line, and
leading ground gainer Bo Cornell
carried it in from there to tie the
score. (Willis was 2-8 passing.)
The Tribe took the ensuing
kickoff, and with passes to Vataha
and great tight end Bob Moore,
set up another score. Jackie
Brown carried to the nine, but
again a clipping penalty pushed
the Indians back.
Given great protection by his
offensive line, Plunkett had hours
to pass the ball, and found Vataha
running past everyone down the
right sidelines. They connected on
a 26-yarder for a score, and Steve
Horowitz converted for a seven
point halftime lead.
By intermission, the pattern
had been set. Plunkett was
throwing well, his receivers
(especially Moore) were making
great catches, and the running
game was strong up the middle.
Washington defensed the
Stanford sweeps well, but
offensively, the Huskies were
dormant. Their fine runners were
hampered by lack of a passing
attack. The Tribe defense was able
to key on a run and stop the play
early.
Of course the penalties
mounted. Stanford had been set

back a full 100 yards by the half.
Three long passes to Moore and
a 15-yard jaunt by Bubba Brown
set up the final score midway
through the third period. Brown
scored this one himself on a leap
from IVi yards away.
Washington, down by 14, was
forced to pass, and never
challenged from the point on.
They operated from deep within
their own territory, and met a
Stanford pass rush that had
unnerved better teams.
Pat Preston, the Outstanding
Lineman of the Game, was
everywhere for the Tribe. He
contributed 23 tackles, 16 of

them unassisted. Don Parish
added his share with 22, and
McClure was excellent, coming up
with 11.
The injured Jim Kauffman saw
action briefly as a defensive
halfback, and intercepted a pass
on his second series in the game.
Hillary Shockley performed
well in replacing Williams who left
the game at the start of the third
