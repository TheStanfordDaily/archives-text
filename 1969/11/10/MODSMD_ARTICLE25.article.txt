Three Stanford varsity football
players were injured Friday
morning in an automobile
accident on campus.
Dave Grossi, Greg Sampson,
and Pete Lazetich, all sophomores
and defensive linemen on the
team were hurt when Grossi's car
crashed into a garbage truck near
the Beta house.
Grossi was most everely
injured, and had stitches taken in
his knee. Sampson also injured his
knee, and Lazetich suffered facial
bruises and a strained back after
going through the windshield.
The players were traveling to
Encina Gym to catch the team
bus for the San Francisco Airport,
and the flight to Seattle for
Saturday's football game.
Grossi did not make the trip,
Sampson did not play, and
Lazetich saw only limited action.
