# IM Football Tourney Action Begins Today
## 
### SCOTT BURNS 
Today begins the IM football tournament to determine the
university champion.
The regular season ended on Saturday, and the first and second
place teams of each league qualified for the tourney.
The freshman house league caused some headaches for the
tournament officials for all five teams tied for first place with 2-2
records. Since all automatically go to the tournament, this displaced
some really good teams from the tournament, like the KA's and the
Phi Kapps, who had taken third places in really tough leagues and
might have been selected for the tournament if there had been extra
openings.
First round play is today and tomorrow, with the top four seeded
teams drawing byes. The seeding is a ranking of teams by the IM
office which is used in placing the teams in the tournament so the
better teams don't meet in early rounds. This year's seeding went as
follows: (1) Phi Delts, (2)Theta Delts, (3) Dislocations, (4) Zetes, (5)
Phuds, (6) Alpha Sig, (7) Sigma Chi, (8) Betas.
Rumors were circulating that the Computer Science team (0-5)
would be put in the tournament, but a poll of tournament teams
showed that they felt a bye would be more competition.
In important games late last week, the Dislocations scored another
convincing victory over MFI, 45-12, and still look like strong
contenders to retain their championship.
The Phuds, another strong contender, beat the First Year Biz team,
12-0, to win their league and remain undefeated for the season. Going
into the tournament there are seven undefeated teams.
In another really important game, the SAE's barely nudged out the
KA's for a place in the tourney by winning the yardage contest after
their 12-12 tie.

records. Since all automatically go to the tournament, this displaced
some really good teams from the tournament, like the KA's and the
Phi Kapps, who had taken third places in really tough leagues and
might have been selected for the tournament if there had been extra
openings.
First round play is today and tomorrow, with the top four seeded
teams drawing byes. The seeding is a ranking of teams by the IM
office which is used in placing the teams in the tournament so the
better teams don't meet in early rounds. This year's seeding went as
follows: (1) Phi Delts, (2)Theta Delts, (3) Dislocations, (4) Zetes, (5)
Phuds, (6) Alpha Sig, (7) Sigma Chi, (8) Betas.
Rumors were circulating that the Computer Science team (0-5)
would be put in the tournament, but a poll of tournament teams
showed that they felt a bye would be more competition.
In important games late last week, the Dislocations scored another
convincing victory over MFI, 45-12, and still look like strong
contenders to retain their championship.
The Phuds, another strong contender, beat the First Year Biz team,
12-0, to win their league and remain undefeated for the season. Going
into the tournament there are seven undefeated teams.
In another really important game, the SAE's barely nudged out the
KA's for a place in the tourney by winning the yardage contest after
their 12-12 tie.
