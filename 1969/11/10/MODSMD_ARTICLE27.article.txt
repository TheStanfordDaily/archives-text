## Indians Drop Pair 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's varsity water polo
team lost just about all hope of a
berth in the NCAA championship
tournament when they traveled to
Los Angeles this weekend and lost
a pair of games—B-2 to LCLA,
and 8-4 to USC.
In Friday's game, the
undefeated Bruins won their 14th
straight game and sixth straight
Pacific-8 championship. The
experienced Bruins, led by
All-Americans Torrey Webb and
Jim Ferguson, were too much for
the young Stanford team to
handle and they easily defeated
the Indians.
The Tribe was greatly hurt by
injuries which had sidelined
experienced veterans Wayne
Wilson, Kevein Eagleston, and
Tom Hill.
Saturday's game was a must
game for Stanford if they were to
have any chance of tetting into
the NCAA tourney. Last weekend
the Trojans had squeaked by
Stanford, 5-4, and the Indians
were eager for revenge.
Stanford played on even terms

with the Trojans for the first half,
but the Indians got into a lot of
foul trouble which eventually beat
them.
The Tribe was tied with USC in
the third quarter, but when the
Indians leading scorer, Rick
Massimino fouled out, the visitors'
attack stopped. The Trojans
quickly took advantage of the
foul situation and picked up a
couple of insurance goals to put it
out of reach.
The loss to USC was Stanford's
fifth consecutive league loss
without a win, but the Indians
overall record stands at 10-7.
Next Saturday, Stanford closes
out its season against California at
10 a.m. in the Encina Pool. Earlier
this season the Bears rallied for a
7-6 win over the Tribe, and
Saturday's game promises to be as
exciting as that contest was.
