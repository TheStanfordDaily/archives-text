Chuck Menz and Don Kardong
surged into the lead at the
halfway point and stayed there
the rest of the way Saturday,
pacing Stanford to an easy 17-44
cross country victory over
California.
With the Stanford band's hard
core blaring the William Tell

Overture, the Indian pair rounded
the final green and came down the
home stretch stride for stride,
both finishing the 4.2 mile course
in 20:05.6.
Greg Brock and Robert Coe
followed 15 and 20 seconds later
to give Stanford the first four
places.
Arvid Kretz finished the Indian
scoring with a seventh place,
20:55 finish and was taken
immediately to Cowell Health
center for a cortisone shot to
relieve tendonitis pain in his hip.
Bob Waldon and Cliff West
placed fifth and six for the Bears.
Coe, who finished second to
Waldon at the Sacramento St.
Invitational to start the season
edged the Cal ace by one second
for personal revenge.
In all, Stanford nabbed seven of
the first nine places as Decker
Underwood and Jack Lawson
finished eighth and ninth in 21:02
and 21:06. And if you count
freshman Brian Mittelstaedt who
ran unofficially as Stanford's
eighth man, the Tribe claimed
eight of ten.
The pace was fast at the
start—the leaders running the first
mile about 4:22—but after that
Cal faded and the race was all
Stanford's.
