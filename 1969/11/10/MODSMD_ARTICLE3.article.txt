"Responsible Dissent"
< Peninsula Moratorium has been
seeking support from both
employees and employers. During
the past several weeks,
management of local industries
has been contacted and asked to
guarantee their workers the right
of "responsible dissent." They
have also been asked to allow
their employees to "express one's
political views in a responsible
manner without fear of reprisal."
Response to the statement has
been "favorable," said Arthur
Bushkin, a Lockheed researcher
who is working with the
Moratorium and organized
circulation of the statement. He
stressed that the statement is
"strictly legal." Industries have
been asked to permit discussion,
lunch hour participation in the
noon march in the Industrial Park,

and the wearing of armbands and
buttons.
Thursday, Stanford students
involved in the Moratorium will
concentrate on reaching area
workers. Businesses will also be
canvassed and asked to
demonstrate their support on
Friday.

Stanford faculty and staff will
hold a noon rally on White Plaza
"to witness the'r opposition to

without penalty.
The march through the
Industrial Park on Friday, which
is also the day of the National
Student Strike, will begin at the
corner of Page Mill and Hanover.
