# Rep. John Tunney To Speak Today
## 
### 
Congressman John V. Tunney
(D—Riverside) will speak
tomorrow on "American Policy in
the Seventies" at 4:15 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. His
address will be sponsored by the
Stanford Political Union.
Rep. Tunney, a persistant critic
of the Vietnam War, is a member
of the House Armed Services
Committee. He has been advanced
as one of three possible candidates
for the Senate seat presently
occupied by Republican George
Murphy.
No reception has been planned
for the Representative because of
personal scheduling difficulties.
State Assemblyman George
Brown, one of Tunney's possible

opponents for Murphy's Senate
seat, accused the Representative
of having too conservative a
voting record. His remarks were
made over the weekend at the
Democratic State Central
Committee meeting in Fresno.
Tunney was also attacked at
the convention for his decision to
remain neutral in the grape
boycott being led by Cesar
Chavez.
Other speakers this week in the
Political Union's symposium
include Senator Barry M.
Goldwater, an unsuccessful
candidate for the Presidency in
1964, and Harrison L. Salisbury,
an editor for the New York
Times. The series concludes
Thursday.


CONGRESSMAN—Rep. John V.
Tunney (I)-Riverside) will speak as
(Mr If the Political Union's
Symposium today at 4:15 in
Dinkelspiel.
