# Pitzer Denies Request For Class Cancellation
## 
### 
President Kenneth Pitzer has
refused to cancel classes during
Moratorium demonstrations on
Thursday and Friday despite a
student Senate resolution urging
the president to allow members of
the community "to be free to be
political."
Reaffirming the stance he took
during the October Moratorium,
Pitzer said, "For the University, as
an institution, to take an official
position on an issue of public
policy not directly related to the
University would infringe on the
academic freedom of those in the
community who might disagree
with that position."
In a statement released
yesterday, Pitzer cited remarks he
made in support of last month's
Moratorium, and stated, "I have
seen nothing since then to cause
me to change those opinions."
Personal Responsibility
The president also said, "A
student's responsibility to attend
class is personal, and it is not
normally policed; a faculty
member's duty to hold classes is
based on his responsibility to all
of his students ..."

With regard to staff employees,
Pitzer commented "I hope that
staff supervisors will be flexible in
granting annual leave or
permitting hours of work to be
rescheduled."
A petition initiated by two
members of the New University
Conference, biophysics graduate
students Bob Schwartz and Mark
Weiss, asked "that staff be
permitted to withhold their
services on November 13th and
14th without penalty." Both
students pointed out that the
University may decide to penalize
staff members by subtracting
absences during the Moratorium
from vacation allowances.
Loss of Jobs Threatened
"Some were even threatened
with loss of their jobs. It is clear
that Stanford employees do not
have the same freedom to express
their views on the war as students
and faculty," they claimed in a
written statement.
(The full text of President
Pitzer's statement is reprinted
below, and the student Senate
resolution is found on page 2.)
Dave Edwards, chairman of the
Student Senate, made public a
letter sent by him to Pitzer today
informing the president of the
Senate's resolution.
• Two Actions
In addition Edwards asked
Pitzer "to take two actions. First,
the Senate is asking you to cancel
all classes on those two days.
Second, you are being asked to
provide a way for all members of
the University community . . .to
participate in the Moratorium
activities without loss of pay and
without retaliation by the
University."
Edwards added that the Senate
resolution was not "directed
against the University," but "just
as action not based on knowledge
is chaotic, knowledge without
action is meaningless."
The letter closed with a
reminder to the president that in
his speech to freshmen on
September 24 he called on
President Nixon to "find courage
to terminate the war promptly."
Edwards then told Pitzer that he
hoped "you will find the courage
to do all that you can to
terminate the war."
President Pitzer's statement:
in view of the evident community
interest in the November Moratorium,
I believe it is appropriate for me to
make clear my own views on this

subject and to explain the policy of
this university.
• have on a number of occasions in
recent months made clear in public my
personal views on the Vietnam war, the
draft, defense policy, national
priorities, and related subjects. At the
time of the October Moratorium, I
said: "I understand and share many of
the concerns which underlie the Oct.
15 Moratorium and I applaud the
sacrifice of personal time on the part
of those who intend to involve
themselves in it." I continue to share
those concerns and support
appropriate political action designed to
influence public policy.
The president of the University,
after consultation, must define
institutional policy in a way that is fair
to all members of the community
For the October Moratorium, the
University did not cancel classes or
other activities. The reason for that
position remains valid: for the
University, as an institution, to take an
official position on an issue of public
policy not directly related to the
Uiiversity would infringe the academic
freedom of those in the community
who might disagree with that position,
and would injure the long-range
interests of all who see the strength of
the University as residing in it',
hospitality to the full range of opinion,
no matter how unpopular some might
be.
I believe that the traditional
practices and the current policies of
the University leave to individual
conscience and beliefs those acts which
properly belong there. A movement
whose strength derives from the
willingness of large numbers of people
to engage in such acts cannot properly
ask for more. I expect, indeed I am
confident, that the community will act
in ways that are consistent with the
University's traditions and policies.
Last month I also stated; "The
University must meet its continuing
responsibilities: moreover, the
Moratorium seeks to elicit individual
acts that arise from conscience.
Therefore University personnel will be
expected to schedule any participation
they may wish to undertake so that the
University's obligations are fully met."
I have seen nothing since then to cause
me to change those opinions.
A university is a differentiated
institution and its members have
diverse responsibilities. A student's
responsibility to attend class is
personal, and it is normally not
policed; a faculty member's duty to
hold classes is based on his
responsibility to all of his students.
Universities like Stanford assume that
this responsibility will be met; they do
not continually monitor it. On Oct. 15,
many professors, sometimes in
consultation with their students,
rescheduled classes or made alternative
arrangements, reflecting their
individual concerns and choices, in a
manner which did not infringe on their
basic educational cpmmitments.
The responsibility of the University
staff is to perform their duties in such
a way as to insure the University's
effect continuing operation. I hope
that staff supervisors will be flexible in
granting annual leave or permitting
hours of work to be rescheduled as
may be appropriate in individual cases.

• Two Actions
In addition Edwards asked
Pitzer "to take two actions. First,
the Senate is asking you to cancel
all classes on those two days.
Second, you are being asked to
provide a way for all members of
the University community . . .to
participate in the Moratorium
activities without loss of pay and
without retaliation by the
University."
Edwards added that the Senate
resolution was not "directed
against the University," but "just
as action not based on knowledge
is chaotic, knowledge without
action is meaningless."
The letter closed with a
reminder to the president that in
his speech to freshmen on
September 24 he called on
President Nixon to "find courage
to terminate the war promptly."
Edwards then told Pitzer that he
hoped "you will find the courage
to do all that you can to
terminate the war."
President Pitzer's statement:
in view of the evident community
interest in the November Moratorium,
I believe it is appropriate for me to
make clear my own views on this

subject and to explain the policy of
this university.
• have on a number of occasions in
recent months made clear in public my
personal views on the Vietnam war, the
draft, defense policy, national
priorities, and related subjects. At the
time of the October Moratorium, I
said: "I understand and share many of
the concerns which underlie the Oct.
15 Moratorium and I applaud the
sacrifice of personal time on the part
of those who intend to involve
themselves in it." I continue to share
those concerns and support
appropriate political action designed to
influence public policy.
The president of the University,
after consultation, must define
institutional policy in a way that is fair
to all members of the community
For the October Moratorium, the
University did not cancel classes or
other activities. The reason for that
position remains valid: for the
University, as an institution, to take an
official position on an issue of public
policy not directly related to the
Uiiversity would infringe the academic
freedom of those in the community
who might disagree with that position,
and would injure the long-range
interests of all who see the strength of
the University as residing in it',
hospitality to the full range of opinion,
no matter how unpopular some might
be.
I believe that the traditional
practices and the current policies of
the University leave to individual
conscience and beliefs those acts which
properly belong there. A movement
whose strength derives from the
willingness of large numbers of people
to engage in such acts cannot properly
ask for more. I expect, indeed I am
confident, that the community will act
in ways that are consistent with the
University's traditions and policies.
Last month I also stated; "The
University must meet its continuing
responsibilities: moreover, the
Moratorium seeks to elicit individual
acts that arise from conscience.
Therefore University personnel will be
expected to schedule any participation
they may wish to undertake so that the
University's obligations are fully met."
I have seen nothing since then to cause
me to change those opinions.
A university is a differentiated
institution and its members have
diverse responsibilities. A student's
responsibility to attend class is
personal, and it is normally not
policed; a faculty member's duty to
hold classes is based on his
responsibility to all of his students.
Universities like Stanford assume that
this responsibility will be met; they do
not continually monitor it. On Oct. 15,
many professors, sometimes in
consultation with their students,
rescheduled classes or made alternative
arrangements, reflecting their
individual concerns and choices, in a
manner which did not infringe on their
basic educational cpmmitments.
The responsibility of the University
staff is to perform their duties in such
a way as to insure the University's
effect continuing operation. I hope
that staff supervisors will be flexible in
granting annual leave or permitting
hours of work to be rescheduled as
may be appropriate in individual cases.
President Kenneth Pitzer has
refused to cancel classes during
Moratorium demonstrations on
Thursday and Friday despite a
student Senate resolution urging
the president to allow members of
the community "to be free to be

Pitzer said, "For the University, as

Pitzer commented "I hope that

A petition initiated by two
members of the New University
Conference, biophysics graduate
students Bob Schwartz and Mark
Weiss, asked "that staff be
permitted to withhold their
services on November 13th and
14th without penalty." Both
students pointed out that the
University may decide to penalize
staff members by subtracting
absences during the Moratorium
from vacation allowances.
Loss of Jobs Threatened
"Some were even threatened
with loss of their jobs. It is clear
that Stanford employees do not
have the same freedom to express

and would injure the long-range
interests of all who see the strength of
the University as residing in it',
hospitality to the full range of opinion,
no matter how unpopular some might
be.
I believe that the traditional
practices and the current policies of
the University leave to individual
conscience and beliefs those acts which
properly belong there. A movement
whose strength derives from the
willingness of large numbers of people
to engage in such acts cannot properly
ask for more. I expect, indeed I am
confident, that the community will act
in ways that are consistent with the
University's traditions and policies.
Last month I also stated; "The
University must meet its continuing
responsibilities: moreover, the
Moratorium seeks to elicit individual
acts that arise from conscience.
Therefore University personnel will be
expected to schedule any participation
they may wish to undertake so that the
University's obligations are fully met."
I have seen nothing since then to cause
me to change those opinions.
A university is a differentiated
institution and its members have
diverse responsibilities. A student's
responsibility to attend class is
personal, and it is normally not
policed; a faculty member's duty to
hold classes is based on his
responsibility to all of his students.
Universities like Stanford assume that
this responsibility will be met; they do
not continually monitor it. On Oct. 15,
many professors, sometimes in
consultation with their students,
rescheduled classes or made alternative
arrangements, reflecting their
individual concerns and choices, in a
manner which did not infringe on their
basic educational cpmmitments.
The responsibility of the University
staff is to perform their duties in such
a way as to insure the University's
effect continuing operation. I hope
that staff supervisors will be flexible in
granting annual leave or permitting
hours of work to be rescheduled as
may be appropriate in individual cases.
President Kenneth Pitzer has
refused to cancel classes during
Moratorium demonstrations on
Thursday and Friday despite a
student Senate resolution urging
the president to allow members of
the community "to be free to be
political."
Reaffirming the stance he took
during the October Moratorium,
Pitzer said, "For the University, as
an institution, to take an official
position on an issue of public
policy not directly related to the
University would infringe on the
academic freedom of those in the
community who might disagree
with that position."
In a statement released
yesterday, Pitzer cited remarks he
made in support of last month's
Moratorium, and stated, "I have
seen nothing since then to cause
me to change those opinions."
Personal Responsibility
The president also said, "A
student's responsibility to attend
class is personal, and it is not
normally policed; a faculty
member's duty to hold classes is
based on his responsibility to all
of his students ..."

With regard to staff employees,
Pitzer commented "I hope that
staff supervisors will be flexible in
granting annual leave or
permitting hours of work to be
rescheduled."
A petition initiated by two
members of the New University
Conference, biophysics graduate
students Bob Schwartz and Mark
Weiss, asked "that staff be
permitted to withhold their
services on November 13th and
14th without penalty." Both
students pointed out that the
University may decide to penalize
staff members by subtracting
absences during the Moratorium
from vacation allowances.
Loss of Jobs Threatened
"Some were even threatened
with loss of their jobs. It is clear
that Stanford employees do not
have the same freedom to express
their views on the war as students
and faculty," they claimed in a
written statement.
(The full text of President
Pitzer's statement is reprinted
below, and the student Senate
resolution is found on page 2.)
Dave Edwards, chairman of the
Student Senate, made public a
letter sent by him to Pitzer today
informing the president of the
Senate's resolution.
• Two Actions
In addition Edwards asked
Pitzer "to take two actions. First,
the Senate is asking you to cancel
all classes on those two days.
Second, you are being asked to
provide a way for all members of
the University community . . .to
participate in the Moratorium
activities without loss of pay and
without retaliation by the
University."
Edwards added that the Senate
resolution was not "directed
against the University," but "just
as action not based on knowledge
is chaotic, knowledge without
action is meaningless."
The letter closed with a
reminder to the president that in
his speech to freshmen on
September 24 he called on
President Nixon to "find courage
to terminate the war promptly."
Edwards then told Pitzer that he
hoped "you will find the courage
to do all that you can to
terminate the war."
President Pitzer's statement:
in view of the evident community
interest in the November Moratorium,
I believe it is appropriate for me to
make clear my own views on this

subject and to explain the policy of
this university.
• have on a number of occasions in
recent months made clear in public my
personal views on the Vietnam war, the
draft, defense policy, national
priorities, and related subjects. At the
time of the October Moratorium, I
said: "I understand and share many of
the concerns which underlie the Oct.
15 Moratorium and I applaud the
sacrifice of personal time on the part
of those who intend to involve
themselves in it." I continue to share
those concerns and support

influence public policy.
