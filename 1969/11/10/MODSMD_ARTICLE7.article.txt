## Nasser Cries Tire and Blood' 
### 
The 22-year-old Arab-Israeli
crisis has exploded three times
into major war. Egypt's Gamal
Abdel Nasser now has called for a
fourth round, proclaiming "fire
and blood" the only answer for
Arabs. Is war, then, just around
the corner?
Well informed sources think a
new major war at this time is
unlikely, but find little
consolation in that estimate. They
report an atmosphere of gloom
pervading the American business
community in the Arab East,
where U.S. interests run into
billions of dollars.
Reports from Americans in the
area, the sources say, reflect fear
that an endless and often bloody
conflict will eventually drive all
Americans out. The result, they
feel, would be a heavy blow to the
United States and an atmosphere
of crisis in Western Europe, which
depends on American-produced
Arab oil.
Nasser many times has called
for war as the duty of all Arabs.
His pronouncement last week
seemed a fairly typical Nasser
performance of the sort which has
on previous occasions got him
into hot water.
Even one of his closest advisers,
Hassanein Haikal, implied
criticism of the Egyptian
president after the 1967 war
which brought disaster to Arab
arms.
"People do not forgive those
whose words are bigger than their
actions," Haikal wrote two years
ago. He had found, in retrospect,
that the Arabs had been unready
for war and had been exhorted to
deeds "beyond our capability."
"There should be no war
without armed forces," Haikal
wrote. "Weapons alone are not
enough. Training, too, is
needed . . . There can be no strong
battlefront without a stronger
domestic front."
Angela Davis
NEW YORK (AP)--Angela
Davis, 25, charged Sunday
attempts by the California Board

of Regents to fire her as an
assistant professor of Philosophy
at UCLA were an assault on the
black liberation movement in
America.
Miss Davis, a member of the
Communist party, said "I have
continually tried to link up my
case with the cause of the black
militants, but the news media
insist on handling it just on the
angle that I am a Communist."
She also threatened to quit the
job she retained when the
California Superior Court ruled it
was unconstitutional for the
Regents to fire her because of her
membership in the Communist
party.
"If my job gets in the way of
my ability to struggle for the
black liberation movement," she
told a news conference, "I will
have to give up my job." 4
"I see the assault by the
Regents and Gov. Ronald Reagan
as an assault on black people in
their struggle for liberation," she
said.
Chancellor Charles Young
wrote in a letter of reinstatement,
Miss David said, that further court
action might put her job in
jeopardy.
But, she added, "My case is
insignificant compared with
Bobby Seale."
"The fact that Bobby Seale was
chained and gagged in court and
sentenced to four years for
contempt indicates terror is
entering the courts. I think we are
facing the possibility of the
growth of fascism in this
country."
Brandt Set back
DUSSELDORF,
Germany(AP)--Chancellor Willy
Brandt's Social Democrats
suffered a slight set back in
communal elections in West
Germany's largest state Sunday. It
was the first test of Brandt's
popularity since he took over as
chancellor last month.
At stake in the election were
seats on 32 city and 46 countv

councils in North
Rhine-Westphalia.
With most ballots counted, the
Socialists had 46.1 percent of the
vote, .8 percent less than the
party polled in the state's last
communal election in 1964.
The opposition Christian
Democrats registered 45.3 percent
of the vote, up 2.2 percent from
1964.
The Free Democrats, Brandt's
partner in the Bonn
Socialist-Liberal coalition, polled
6.1 percent, down 1.5 percent
from their 1964 showing.
NEW YORK (AP)—Some
Senate members say Chief Justice
Warren Burger has approached
them, urging support of Clement
Haynsworth, President Nixon's
controversial nominee to the U.S.
Supreme Court, Newsweek
magazine said in its current issue.
"One ranking GOP senator says
Burger has been buttonholing
senators at social functions and
telling them, 'If Judge
Haynsworth isn't qualified to sit
on the Supreme Court, then I'm
not either,' " the magazine said in
its Periscope section.
It said Burger's reported
lobbying had made no visible
converts.
Sauna Hi-Jinx
SAN JOSE (AP)—Fifty-two
members of a San Jose State
College fraternity and sorority
pressed into a tiny steam bathing
enclosure Sunday to win the
"western hemisphere sauna
packing championship."
Tne men and women of Sigma
Phi Beta claimed the title after the
rival Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity
and Alpha Chi Omega sorority
manager to press only 50 into the
six-by-six-by-seven foot box, built
to official specifications, on the
campus drill field.
"It was real tight going," said
Sigma Chi spokesman Mike Hunt,
"but, having dreamed it up, we
figured it was nice little thing to
do on a Sunday afternoon."

The next step will be to
challenge some group in
Scandanavia, where sauna bathing
"is the going thing," Hunt said.
"Then we can make it a world
championship."
The only problem, he added
ruefully, is that "over there, they
all go into saunas with nothing on.
We were all properly dressed in
swimming gear."
State Demos Meet
FRESNO (AP)—Negroes and
Chicanos demanded Sunday that
California Democrats give them a
bigger voice in party affairs.
They presented 10 demands to
the Democratic State Central
Committee as it ended a two-day
conference on Project 70, an
analysis of the state and the party
to see what Democrats can win in
1970.
The announced emphasis was
on ways the Democrats could oust
Republican Gov. Ronald Reagan
and regain control of the
legislature.
But attention centered on
personalities—primarily the
Democrats' two major prospective
candidates for governor: San

Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto
and Assembly Democratic Leader
Jesse M. Unruh.
After the demands from the
"Black and Brown Caucus," Were
read, conference chairman Leon
Cooper of Los Angeles said,
"These are matters of extreme
emergency" and the party must
work to implement them.

State Demos Meet
FRESNO (AP)—Negroes and
Chicanos demanded Sunday that
California Democrats give them a
bigger voice in party affairs.
They presented 10 demands to
the Democratic State Central
Committee as it ended a two-day
conference on Project 70, an
analysis of the state and the party
to see what Democrats can win in
1970.
The announced emphasis was
on ways the Democrats could oust
Republican Gov. Ronald Reagan
and regain control of the
legislature.
But attention centered on
personalities—primarily the
Democrats' two major prospective
candidates for governor: San

Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto
and Assembly Democratic Leader
Jesse M. Unruh.
After the demands from the
"Black and Brown Caucus," Were
read, conference chairman Leon
Cooper of Los Angeles said,
"These are matters of extreme
emergency" and the party must
work to implement them.
The 22-year-old Arab-Israeli
crisis has exploded three times
into major war. Egypt's Gamal
Abdel Nasser now has called for a
fourth round, proclaiming "fire
and blood" the only answer for
Arabs. Is war, then, just around
the corner?
Well informed sources think a
new major war at this time is
unlikely, but find little
consolation in that estimate. They
report an atmosphere of gloom
pervading the American business
community in the Arab East,
where U.S. interests run into
billions of dollars.
Reports from Americans in the
area, the sources say, reflect fear
that an endless and often bloody
conflict will eventually drive all
Americans out. The result, they
feel, would be a heavy blow to the
United States and an atmosphere
of crisis in Western Europe, which
depends on American-produced
Arab oil.
Nasser many times has called
for war as the duty of all Arabs.
His pronouncement last week
seemed a fairly typical Nasser
performance of the sort which has
on previous occasions got him
into hot water.
Even one of his closest advisers,
Hassanein Haikal, implied
criticism of the Egyptian
president after the 1967 war
which brought disaster to Arab
arms.
"People do not forgive those
whose words are bigger than their
actions," Haikal wrote two years
ago. He had found, in retrospect,
that the Arabs had been unready
for war and had been exhorted to
deeds "beyond our capability."
"There should be no war
without armed forces," Haikal
wrote. "Weapons alone are not
enough. Training, too, is
needed . . . There can be no strong
battlefront without a stronger
domestic front."
Angela Davis
NEW YORK (AP)--Angela
Davis, 25, charged Sunday
attempts by the California Board

of Regents to fire her as an
assistant professor of Philosophy
at UCLA were an assault on the
black liberation movement in
America.
Miss Davis, a member of the
Communist party, said "I have
continually tried to link up my
case with the cause of the black
militants, but the news media
insist on handling it just on the
angle that I am a Communist."
She also threatened to quit the
job she retained when the
California Superior Court ruled it
was unconstitutional for the
Regents to fire her because of her
membership in the Communist
party.
"If my job gets in the way of
my ability to struggle for the
black liberation movement," she
told a news conference, "I will
have to give up my job." 4
"I see the assault by the
Regents and Gov. Ronald Reagan
as an assault on black people in
their struggle for liberation," she
said.
Chancellor Charles Young
wrote in a letter of reinstatement,
Miss David said, that further court
action might put her job in
jeopardy.
But, she added, "My case is
insignificant compared with
Bobby Seale."
"The fact that Bobby Seale was
chained and gagged in court and
sentenced to four years for
contempt indicates terror is
entering the courts. I think we are
facing the possibility of the
growth of fascism in this
country."
Brandt Set back
DUSSELDORF,
Germany(AP)--Chancellor Willy
Brandt's Social Democrats
suffered a slight set back in
communal elections in West
Germany's largest state Sunday. It
was the first test of Brandt's
popularity since he took over as
chancellor last month.
At stake in the election were
seats on 32 city and 46 countv

councils in North

With most ballots counted, the
Socialists had 46.1 percent of the
vote, .8 percent less than the
party polled in the state's last
communal election in 1964.
The opposition Christian
Democrats registered 45.3 percent
of the vote, up 2.2 percent from
1964.
The Free Democrats, Brandt's
partner in the Bonn
Socialist-Liberal coalition, polled
6.1 percent, down 1.5 percent
from their 1964 showing.
NEW YORK (AP)—Some

With most ballots counted, the

NEW YORK (AP)—Some
Senate members say Chief Justice
Warren Burger has approached
them, urging support of Clement
Haynsworth, President Nixon's
controversial nominee to the U.S.
Supreme Court, Newsweek
magazine said in its current issue.
"One ranking GOP senator says
Burger has been buttonholing
senators at social functions and
telling them, 'If Judge
Haynsworth isn't qualified to sit
on the Supreme Court, then I'm
not either,' " the magazine said in
its Periscope section.
It said Burger's reported
lobbying had made no visible
converts.
Sauna Hi-Jinx
SAN JOSE (AP)—Fifty-two
members of a San Jose State
College fraternity and sorority
pressed into a tiny steam bathing
enclosure Sunday to win the
"western hemisphere sauna
packing championship."
Tne men and women of Sigma
Phi Beta claimed the title after the
rival Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity
and Alpha Chi Omega sorority
manager to press only 50 into the
six-by-six-by-seven foot box, built
to official specifications, on the
campus drill field.
"It was real tight going," said
Sigma Chi spokesman Mike Hunt,
"but, having dreamed it up, we
figured it was nice little thing to
do on a Sunday afternoon."

The next step will be to
challenge some group in
Scandanavia, where sauna bathing
"is the going thing," Hunt said.
"Then we can make it a world
championship."
The only problem, he added
ruefully, is that "over there, they
all go into saunas with nothing on.
We were all properly dressed in
swimming gear."
State Demos Meet
FRESNO (AP)—Negroes and
Chicanos demanded Sunday that
California Democrats give them a
bigger voice in party affairs.
They presented 10 demands to
the Democratic State Central
Committee as it ended a two-day
conference on Project 70, an
analysis of the state and the party
to see what Democrats can win in
1970.
The announced emphasis was
on ways the Democrats could oust
Republican Gov. Ronald Reagan
and regain control of the
legislature.
But attention centered on
personalities—primarily the
Democrats' two major prospective
candidates for governor: San

Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto
and Assembly Democratic Leader
Jesse M. Unruh.
After the demands from the
"Black and Brown Caucus," Were
read, conference chairman Leon
Cooper of Los Angeles said,
"These are matters of extreme
emergency" and the party must
work to implement them.
The 22-year-old Arab-Israeli
crisis has exploded three times
into major war. Egypt's Gamal
Abdel Nasser now has called for a
fourth round, proclaiming "fire
and blood" the only answer for
Arabs. Is war, then, just around
the corner?
Well informed sources think a
new major war at this time is
unlikely, but find little
consolation in that estimate. They
report an atmosphere of gloom
pervading the American business
community in the Arab East,
where U.S. interests run into
billions of dollars.
Reports from Americans in the
area, the sources say, reflect fear
that an endless and often bloody
conflict will eventually drive all
Americans out. The result, they
feel, would be a heavy blow to the
United States and an atmosphere
of crisis in Western Europe, which
depends on American-produced
Arab oil.
Nasser many times has called
for war as the duty of all Arabs.
His pronouncement last week
seemed a fairly typical Nasser
performance of the sort which has
on previous occasions got him
into hot water.
Even one of his closest advisers,
Hassanein Haikal, implied
criticism of the Egyptian
president after the 1967 war
which brought disaster to Arab
arms.
"People do not forgive those
whose words are bigger than their
actions," Haikal wrote two years
ago. He had found, in retrospect,
that the Arabs had been unready
for war and had been exhorted to
deeds "beyond our capability."
"There should be no war
without armed forces," Haikal
wrote. "Weapons alone are not
enough. Training, too, is
needed . . . There can be no strong
battlefront without a stronger
domestic front."
Angela Davis
NEW YORK (AP)--Angela
Davis, 25, charged Sunday
attempts by the California Board

of Regents to fire her as an
assistant professor of Philosophy
at UCLA were an assault on the
black liberation movement in
America.
Miss Davis, a member of the
Communist party, said "I have
continually tried to link up my
case with the cause of the black
militants, but the news media
insist on handling it just on the
angle that I am a Communist."
She also threatened to quit the
job she retained when the
California Superior Court ruled it
was unconstitutional for the
Regents to fire her because of her
membership in the Communist
party.
"If my job gets in the way of
my ability to struggle for the
black liberation movement," she
told a news conference, "I will
have to give up my job." 4
"I see the assault by the
Regents and Gov. Ronald Reagan
as an assault on black people in
their struggle for liberation," she
said.
Chancellor Charles Young
wrote in a letter of reinstatement,
Miss David said, that further court
action might put her job in
jeopardy.
But, she added, "My case is
insignificant compared with
Bobby Seale."
"The fact that Bobby Seale was
chained and gagged in court and
sentenced to four years for
contempt indicates terror is
entering the courts. I think we are
facing the possibility of the
growth of fascism in this
country."

Miss Davis, a member of the
Communist party, said "I have
continually tried to link up my
case with the cause of the black
militants, but the news media
insist on handling it just on the
angle that I am a Communist."
She also threatened to quit the
job she retained when the
California Superior Court ruled it
was unconstitutional for the
Regents to fire her because of her
membership in the Communist
party.
"If my job gets in the way of
my ability to struggle for the
black liberation movement," she
told a news conference, "I will
have to give up my job." 4
"I see the assault by the
Regents and Gov. Ronald Reagan
as an assault on black people in
their struggle for liberation," she
said.
Chancellor Charles Young
wrote in a letter of reinstatement,
Miss David said, that further court
action might put her job in
jeopardy.
But, she added, "My case is
insignificant compared with
Bobby Seale."
"The fact that Bobby Seale was
chained and gagged in court and
sentenced to four years for
contempt indicates terror is
entering the courts. I think we are
facing the possibility of the
growth of fascism in this
country."
Brandt Set back
DUSSELDORF,
Germany(AP)--Chancellor Willy
Brandt's Social Democrats
suffered a slight set back in
communal elections in West
Germany's largest state Sunday. It
was the first test of Brandt's
popularity since he took over as
chancellor last month.
At stake in the election were
seats on 32 city and 46 countv

councils in North
Rhine-Westphalia.
With most ballots counted, the
Socialists had 46.1 percent of the
vote, .8 percent less than the
party polled in the state's last
communal election in 1964.
The opposition Christian
Democrats registered 45.3 percent
of the vote, up 2.2 percent from
1964.
The Free Democrats, Brandt's
partner in the Bonn
Socialist-Liberal coalition, polled
6.1 percent, down 1.5 percent
from their 1964 showing.
NEW YORK (AP)—Some
Senate members say Chief Justice
Warren Burger has approached
them, urging support of Clement
Haynsworth, President Nixon's
controversial nominee to the U.S.
Supreme Court, Newsweek
magazine said in its current issue.
"One ranking GOP senator says
Burger has been buttonholing
senators at social functions and
telling them, 'If Judge
Haynsworth isn't qualified to sit
on the Supreme Court, then I'm
not either,' " the magazine said in
its Periscope section.
It said Burger's reported
lobbying had made no visible
converts.
Sauna Hi-Jinx
SAN JOSE (AP)—Fifty-two
members of a San Jose State
College fraternity and sorority
pressed into a tiny steam bathing
enclosure Sunday to win the
"western hemisphere sauna
packing championship."
Tne men and women of Sigma
Phi Beta claimed the title after the
rival Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity
and Alpha Chi Omega sorority
manager to press only 50 into the
six-by-six-by-seven foot box, built
to official specifications, on the
campus drill field.
"It was real tight going," said
Sigma Chi spokesman Mike Hunt,
"but, having dreamed it up, we
figured it was nice little thing to
do on a Sunday afternoon."

The next step will be to
challenge some group in
Scandanavia, where sauna bathing
"is the going thing," Hunt said.
"Then we can make it a world
championship."
The only problem, he added
ruefully, is that "over there, they
all go into saunas with nothing on.
We were all properly dressed in
swimming gear."
State Demos Meet
FRESNO (AP)—Negroes and
Chicanos demanded Sunday that
California Democrats give them a
bigger voice in party affairs.
They presented 10 demands to
the Democratic State Central
Committee as it ended a two-day
conference on Project 70, an
analysis of the state and the party
to see what Democrats can win in
1970.
The announced emphasis was
on ways the Democrats could oust
Republican Gov. Ronald Reagan
and regain control of the
legislature.
But attention centered on
personalities—primarily the
Democrats' two major prospective
candidates for governor: San

Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto
and Assembly Democratic Leader
Jesse M. Unruh.
After the demands from the
"Black and Brown Caucus," Were
read, conference chairman Leon
Cooper of Los Angeles said,
"These are matters of extreme
emergency" and the party must
work to implement them.
