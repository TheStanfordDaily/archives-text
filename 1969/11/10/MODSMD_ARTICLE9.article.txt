# Unique Insight
## A
						Tribute To Spiro 
### Fleance Morganne 
It is time for us to
recognize a great leader who came
of age. Mr. Agnew has now proven
himself beyond question worthy
of standing shoulder to shoulder
with our Nation's most immortal
statesmen. The Vice President has
more than discharged his sworn
duties in demonstrating his
stature.
He has acted forcefully, with a
combination of zest plus calm
dependability that inspires the
unhesitating confidence of his
fellow taxpayers. Never fewer
than two times each week he
delivers a brief yet sharply
penetrating analysis of selected
topical problems. He considers
this a major avenue for
maintaining open communication
with his nationwide constituency.
Close associates report that it is
with this goal in mind that he has
invariably timed his remarks to
appear at regular intervals in the
morning papers. At those times,
regardless equally of sinister
weather or mood, I simply open
iny paper to the story and feel a
sudden tremor electrify my body
as the morning joyfully bursts
alive to greet his latest pithy
observation.
I no longer bother casting even
an idle glance towards Dear Abby.
In a spirit of honest cirticism, I
am forced to advise Dear Abby
gracefully to retire as her time has
come. She need feel no shame at
losing her brave effort to compete
with the acclaimed Master in the
field.
Incisive Perception
Quite simply I feel awe towards
this man whose honesty forces
incisive perception into issues
regardless of their sometimes
controversial aspects. This is no
weak-kneed vote-mongerer
quailing before a noisy few: Mr.
Agnew openly presents himself as
an upright and truly honest
American. For such a man one

can only feel a deep admiration.
The great enjoyment his words
bring into my mornings has,
however, begun to cause
problems. I can no longer sit and
quietly sip my orange juice while
reading the latest exciting Mr.
Vice President story. Now I
become far too involved. I shout
with glee as each new saga is
unfolded and forget all else. This
loss of restraint has ten times so
far led me to knocking the
unwary juice plus glass to a messy
tiled demise. Any harmful effects
of these accidents, however, have
been negligible since all such
annoyances failed to distract my
attention from the newspaper.
An Agnew Addict
A much more serious aspect of
my involvement is that I am
rapidly becoming a helpless
addict. My psyche depends upon a
wit whose special tone is unique
to Mr. Agnew. I anticipate that
wit for sleepless hours; I expect it
as a natural right; I tremble before

each new issue for fear his words
will not appear. Every day what
he contributes becomes joyfully
carefree. Every day he keeps silent
leaves me morosely waiting for
the night with new hopes for the
next morning.
In desperation I have been
forced to begin praying nightly,
on my knees, for Mr. Agnew's
continued ruddy health and
uninterrupted stream of
inspirations. Although helpful,
prayer alone seems not enough. I
have developed definite queazy
seizures deep inside my gut. They
remind me a hundred times per
day of my pathological fear of
losing the products of that single
awesome mind which must
unhappily be finite as well as
mortal. I know full well that
sooner or later the unique insights
of Mr. Angew will fail to appear
and when that inevitable final day
does arrive my defeated being will
learn the absurdity of despair.
