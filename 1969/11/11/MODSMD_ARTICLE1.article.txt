available.)

j A bold and far-reaching reversal
K)f university policy on the birth
jcontrol pill is now on the desk of
(President Kenneth Pitzer.
The proposed new policy, long
galled for by many doctors and
students, would enable doctors at
ithe Cowell Health Center to
prescribe contraceptives for
( unmarried students under 21.
A number of experts on the
subject, believe that this medical
service, and the medical
examinations and consultation
that would accompany it, are vital
to the physical and mental health
of Stanford women.
But others have strong
reservations claiming the pil raises
serious medical and social
questions. The controversy points
to a striking conflict between a
new moral code now developing
and an old one.
Present Policy
At present Stanford will not
allow a university doctor to
prescribe contraceptives to a
student under 21 unless she is
married or intends to be married
within 60 days.
But doctors at Cowell will refer
students to local doctors or the
local Planned Parenthood office
for help.
Last fall Dr. James
McClenahan, director of Cowell,
and Joel Smith, then Dean of
Students proposed a new policy
to acting President Robert J.
Glaser. The new policy eliminates
all restrictions on a doctor's
ability to prescribe contraceptives
and leaves the decision to the
discretion of individual doctors.
Glaser, now director of the
Stanford Medical School,
concurred with the conclusion
that the old policy, in effect since
1962, could and should be
scrapped. But the three felt a
professional opinion should be

sought as to the legality of the
proposed new policy.
Two Alternatives
A committee headed by Cassius
Kirk Jr., counsel for Business
Affairs presented two alternatives.
First, Stanford could revise
Cowell's information bulletin to
state explicitly that the health
center does prescribe the birth
control pill to unmarried students.
In Kirk's opinion, a parent's
allowing his daughter to attend

Stanford would constitute
consent to the announced policy.
A second approach would be to
seek an opinion from the
California attorney general on
whether a new code passed last
year would apply to college
students. The code states that any
minor 15 years of age and above
who is away from home and
managing his own financial affairs
may receive medical care without
parental consent. If this law
applies to college students, it
would clearly provide legal
justification for the new policy.
The decision is now President
Pitzer's. When contacted last
week, Fred Glover, assistant to
the President, refused to discuss
the policy. He did however

express hope that Pitzer would
announce a decision by winter
quarter.
Controversial Decision
The question is indeed a
controversial one. Whatever Pitzer
decides will surely meet with
opposition. McClenahan has noted
that several aspects of the
university are involved in the
consideration of a
decision—students, faculty,
alumni, parents, and Trustees.

"Obviously," he said, "a
university cannot do things as
simply as the doctor downtown."
Should Pitzer approve the new
policy, many parents and alumni
will be unhappy. The present
policy against the prescription of
contraceptives was adopted only
seven years ago when irate parents
discovered their daughters had
obtained some. They complained
before President Sterling and the
Trustees.
Two weeks ago, parents
complained to the health center
because their unmarried daughter
had somehow gotten birth control
pills. These parental complaints
are not uncommon.
Students Wanl The Pill
But if many parents might

oppose the new policy, many
students seem to bt
overwhelmingly in favor of it
Gloria Davis, clinic director of the
Palo Alto Family Planning Center
revealed last week that over 100
Stanford girls, almost all
unmarried, have sought and
received prescriptions for
contraceptives at the center
within the last two months. She
estimates that perhaps as many as
100 more are receiving help, but
they are reluctant to talk.
In a recent poll of 30 students
in a mixed-class, coed dormitory,
over 90% felt that Cowell should
prescribe the pill "to anyone who
wants it and is medically able to
take it." Significantly, almost 90%
said that a girl on the pill should
not give it to anyone else, even
her best friend.
This last figure is significant
because it seems to defuse an
important argument against the
new policy. Some of those who
oppose the proposed policy feel
that it would lead to a situation
where the girls receiving the
contraceptives would be supplying
them to their embarrassed or shy
friends.
Essential Medical Services
The use of the birth control
pill, in the opinion of most
medical experts, requires certain
essential medical services—breast
and pelvic examinations, cancer
screenings, pap smears (smears of
the cervix to detect for cancer),
personal counseling and follow-up
examinations—if it is to be safe
and effective. A girl getting the
pill from a friend would not
receive these vital medical services
that must complement
contraception.
While McClenahan emphasizes
the importance of providing these
additional services, he admits that
the health center does not
presently have a large enough staff
to properly treat all the unmarried
Stanford women who might want
the pill. If the new policy were
adopted, the size of the health
center staff would have to be
increased, or some of the girls 1
would have to be referred to
another medical organization for 1
birth control check-ups.
