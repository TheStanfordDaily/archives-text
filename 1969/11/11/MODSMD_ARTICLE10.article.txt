# 'Arab Propaganda'
## 'Nazi Support For Al Fatah' 
### Joshua Ronen 
(This is the second of a series of
columns by Joshua Ronen, who is
a Ph.D. candidate in Business
Administration.)
The sabotage organizations,
whose operations Miss Mihaly has
been trying so zealously to justify,
find their main sources of finance
and for ideological support in
Europe among the various
neo-Nazi organizations, with
whom the Arabs share a common
hatred of the Jews—and not only
the Zionists. Recently, two
Algerians representing El Fatah
and the "Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine" tried to
elicit support for their clients
from the neo-Nazi organization
Europische Nene Ordnung, which
centres in Lausanne, during a
congress held in Barcelona from
April 4 to 6, 1969. They
requested assistance in recruiting
non-Arab elements for support
and also help with the propaganda
effort in Europe and South
America. In addition, Fatah's
efforts have also included appeals
to individual Nazis in Europe to
solicit their assistance. Two such
contacts ire: (a) Karl Van De Put,
a Belgian and a Nazi who served in
the African Corps in World War II
(at present residing at N39
Chausee de Haecht Bruxelles), and
who now recruits European youth
with military background for
service in the Fatah; and (b)
Johann M. Schuller, former Nazi
officer, residing at 21 Via Nenea,
Rome, who has for the past year
been selling arms to the Fatah and
a few months ago began recruiting
other Nazi officers as instructors
in Al-Assifa (the El Fatah military
arm) training camps.
Jewish Statehood
I shall address myself now to
Miss Mihaiv' "learned" remarks

on Zionism. She quotes the
statements of a few Jews who are
not Zionists (the quotations
reflect the American Council for
Judaism's opposition to the
establishment of a Jewish state) as
a support for her allegation that
"Zionism, an ideology of
exclusivism, has created its own
club called Israel." But
unfortunately for Miss Mihaly's
propagandistic efforts, when one
quotes a group of American Jews
(about 20,000 organized members
throughout the U.S.), stating their
opposition to a Jewish state, one
does not "prove" as a
consequence that Israel does not
have the right to exist as a Jewish
State, exactly as one would not
expect a sound person to treat a
corresponding statement of a
group of Americans residing—say
in France—as a proof that the
United States does not have the
right to exist as an American
State. Alas, one would have
expected a student of Political
Science such as Miss Mihaly to be
able to make more logical
extrapolations as a minimum.
Indeed, one should offer Miss
Mihaly an explanation of what the
right to statehood is all about.
The Time Magazine essay (June
23, 1967) explores precisely this
question with considerable
academic profundity. Che learns
that there is a substantial
agreement on what is a nation
among historians, political
scientists and students of
international law. Harvard
political scientist Rupert Emerson
is quoted as saying that a nation is
"a body of people who feel they
are a nation." Thus, what is
essential is "the sense of common
identity." The essay goes on: "A
nation becomes a state when it

has the power to occupy and hold
a given amount of space and when
other nations recognize this fact."
So the only real criteria for
sovereignty according to this
consensus are: identity, tradition,
ability to stake out a territory,
govern it, and win recognition.
Throughout the history of nations
these elements of nationhood
have all contributed one or more
at a time to the rise of nations:
England was established through
conquest when the Normans
defeated the Anglo-Saxons; the
U.S. and Latin America were
established through a combination
of immigration and revolution.
Without fighting for their
freedom, countries such as Chad
and Upper Volt a gained their
soverignty under the U N 's aegis.
Creation of Israel
In the creation of Israel, one
can detect most of these
elements—war of liberation,
immigration, rebirth, and
international action. The Jews'
religious, emotional and historic
claim to Israel as their homeland
is stronger than that of the Arabs.
Thus Israel proclaimed itself a
state and (he world so recognized
it.

service in the Fatah; and (b)

officer, residing at 21 Via Nenea,
Rome, who has for the past year

a few months ago began recruiting

Jewish Statehood
I shall address myself now to
Miss Mihaiv' "learned" remarks

on Zionism. She quotes the
statements of a few Jews who are
not Zionists (the quotations
reflect the American Council for
Judaism's opposition to the
establishment of a Jewish state) as
a support for her allegation that
"Zionism, an ideology of
exclusivism, has created its own
club called Israel." But
unfortunately for Miss Mihaly's
propagandistic efforts, when one
quotes a group of American Jews
(about 20,000 organized members
throughout the U.S.), stating their
opposition to a Jewish state, one
does not "prove" as a
consequence that Israel does not
have the right to exist as a Jewish
State, exactly as one would not
expect a sound person to treat a
corresponding statement of a
group of Americans residing—say
in France—as a proof that the
United States does not have the
right to exist as an American
State. Alas, one would have
expected a student of Political
Science such as Miss Mihaly to be
able to make more logical
extrapolations as a minimum.
Indeed, one should offer Miss
Mihaly an explanation of what the
right to statehood is all about.
The Time Magazine essay (June
23, 1967) explores precisely this
question with considerable
academic profundity. Che learns
that there is a substantial
agreement on what is a nation
among historians, political
scientists and students of
international law. Harvard
political scientist Rupert Emerson
is quoted as saying that a nation is
"a body of people who feel they
are a nation." Thus, what is
essential is "the sense of common
identity." The essay goes on: "A
nation becomes a state when it

has the power to occupy and hold
a given amount of space and when
other nations recognize this fact."
So the only real criteria for
sovereignty according to this
consensus are: identity, tradition,
ability to stake out a territory,
govern it, and win recognition.
Throughout the history of nations
these elements of nationhood
have all contributed one or more
at a time to the rise of nations:
England was established through
conquest when the Normans
defeated the Anglo-Saxons; the
U.S. and Latin America were
established through a combination
of immigration and revolution.
Without fighting for their
freedom, countries such as Chad
and Upper Volt a gained their
soverignty under the U N 's aegis.
Creation of Israel
In the creation of Israel, one
can detect most of these
elements—war of liberation,
immigration, rebirth, and
international action. The Jews'
religious, emotional and historic
claim to Israel as their homeland
is stronger than that of the Arabs.
Thus Israel proclaimed itself a
state and (he world so recognized
it.

State. Alas, one would have
expected a student of Political
Science such as Miss Mihaly to be
able to make more logical
extrapolations as a minimum.
Indeed, one should offer Miss
Mihaly an explanation of what the
right to statehood is all about.
The Time Magazine essay (June
23, 1967) explores precisely this
question with considerable
academic profundity. Che learns
that there is a substantial
agreement on what is a nation
among historians, political
scientists and students of
international law. Harvard
political scientist Rupert Emerson
is quoted as saying that a nation is
"a body of people who feel they
are a nation." Thus, what is
essential is "the sense of common
identity." The essay goes on: "A
nation becomes a state when it

has the power to occupy and hold
a given amount of space and when
other nations recognize this fact."
So the only real criteria for
sovereignty according to this
consensus are: identity, tradition,
ability to stake out a territory,
govern it, and win recognition.
Throughout the history of nations
these elements of nationhood
have all contributed one or more
at a time to the rise of nations:
England was established through
conquest when the Normans
defeated the Anglo-Saxons; the
U.S. and Latin America were
established through a combination
of immigration and revolution.
Without fighting for their
freedom, countries such as Chad
and Upper Volt a gained their
soverignty under the U N 's aegis.
Creation of Israel
In the creation of Israel, one
can detect most of these
elements—war of liberation,
immigration, rebirth, and
international action. The Jews'
religious, emotional and historic
claim to Israel as their homeland
is stronger than that of the Arabs.
Thus Israel proclaimed itself a
state and (he world so recognized
it.

The sabotage organizations,
whose operations Miss Mihaly has
been trying so zealously to justify,
find their main sources of finance
and for ideological support in
Europe among the various
neo-Nazi organizations, with
whom the Arabs share a common
hatred of the Jews—and not only
the Zionists. Recently, two
Algerians representing El Fatah
and the "Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine" tried to
elicit support for their clients
from the neo-Nazi organization
Europische Nene Ordnung, which
centres in Lausanne, during a
congress held in Barcelona from
April 4 to 6, 1969. They
requested assistance in recruiting
non-Arab elements for support
and also help with the propaganda
effort in Europe and South
America. In addition, Fatah's
efforts have also included appeals
to individual Nazis in Europe to
solicit their assistance. Two such
contacts ire: (a) Karl Van De Put,
a Belgian and a Nazi who served in
the African Corps in World War II
(at present residing at N39
Chausee de Haecht Bruxelles), and
who now recruits European youth
with military background for
service in the Fatah; and (b)
Johann M. Schuller, former Nazi
officer, residing at 21 Via Nenea,
Rome, who has for the past year
been selling arms to the Fatah and
a few months ago began recruiting
other Nazi officers as instructors
in Al-Assifa (the El Fatah military
arm) training camps.
Jewish Statehood
I shall address myself now to
Miss Mihaiv' "learned" remarks

on Zionism. She quotes the
statements of a few Jews who are
not Zionists (the quotations
reflect the American Council for
Judaism's opposition to the
establishment of a Jewish state) as
a support for her allegation that
"Zionism, an ideology of
exclusivism, has created its own
club called Israel." But
unfortunately for Miss Mihaly's
propagandistic efforts, when one
quotes a group of American Jews
(about 20,000 organized members
throughout the U.S.), stating their
opposition to a Jewish state, one
does not "prove" as a
consequence that Israel does not
have the right to exist as a Jewish
State, exactly as one would not
expect a sound person to treat a
corresponding statement of a
group of Americans residing—say
in France—as a proof that the
United States does not have the
right to exist as an American
State. Alas, one would have
expected a student of Political
Science such as Miss Mihaly to be
able to make more logical
extrapolations as a minimum.
