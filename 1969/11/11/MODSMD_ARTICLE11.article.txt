# A 						Senator's View
## Pitzer's 'Neutrality' 
### Douglas McHenry 
Since the Senate's decision to
support a resolution requesting
President Pitzer to allow both
employees and students to decide
whether or not to engage in civic
protest against the war, free from
academic or economic reprisal,
has been made public, I have
heard much criticism from both
students and faculty as to the
wisdom of such a position.
For the most part, the criticism
is not prompted by any drastic
political difference of opinion,
but rather from a different view
concerning just what a university
can and cannot do within the
political arena, and still lay claim
to an atmosphere of free, critical
inquiry; that which marks a
university distinct from an
institution which imposes some
particular brand of dogma.
Most people, who seriously
consider a university should
maintain a free and critical
atmosphere, and I include myself
among them, agree a university
cannot take 'official' political
positions and remain true to its
purposes. For example, imagine
the absurdity if in the next
presidential election institutions
of higher learning officially lined
up behind candidates for the
presidency.
Critical Inquiry
However, I feel that the
resolution passed by eighteen
other senators and myself was not
a matter of spewing any political
preference, as much as it was a
plea to allow the constituency of
this university to engage in that
process of critical inquiry; free
from any external pressures which
might very well preclude this
process from beginning. What are
some of these pressures?
The university maintains a
strict policy concerning what is a
valid absence from work and what
is not. It states quite clearly that
an unexcused absence, that is to
say an absence other than for
reasons of illness or death, is
grounds for immediate dismissal. I
ask myself, would I actively
evprcise one of my most

fundamental of constitutional
rights, if bv so doing I might
jeopardize the livelihood of my
family? In this position I am sure
the decision one would make is
both difficult yet obvious.
Neulral Position?
The same applies to students, in
the sense that academic
obligations must be met the same
as the obligations of a
breadwinner must be. The logical
extension is how can the
university sincerely entertain the
thought that by imposing these
external pressures upon its own
constituency it is thereby
assuming a neutral position upon
the issue. When it is clear that by
doing so it will preclude for many
the opportunity to exercise their
constitutional rights. But more
importantly it will obviate the
opportunity of thought to
exercise constitutional rights or to
seriously consider the issue,
because necessity has decided for
them.
Some would ask the question
why should the university make it
easy to protest, or exercise
constitutional rights? One should
have to suffer or sacrifice when
exercising guaranteed rights. I fo'

one, cannot see the logic behind
this viewpoint, but I do clearly
perceive the counter argument.
The university does indeed
make it easy for a certain group to
protest, while making it difficult
for another. 1 have talked with a
few students who used the fact
that the university was open
during the last Moratorium, as a
means of expressing their political
opinion against it. For it is a
political fact that the less number
of people participating in the
Moratorium and more in classes or
at work, the less impact it would
have.
Suspend Operations
Upon these grounds I see no
other alternative which the
university can take, and still be
compatable with a spirit of free
inquiry, other than to suspend
operations during the
Moratorium. Thereby it can
establish an atmosphere free of
external pressures and favoritism
of one group over another in
which to decide one's personal
moral position.
