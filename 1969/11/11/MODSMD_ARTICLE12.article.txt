# No Freedom
## Staff And Nov. 14 
### Bob Schwartz Mark Weiss 
(Mark and Bob are graduate
students in Biophysics and
members of the New University
Conference.)
Thursday and Friday,
professors will cancel classes, and
students will boycott their normal
activities without penalty.
However, for staff members to act
in opposition to the war in
Vietnam by stopping business as
usual means the loss of a day of
vacation or pay. On October 15,
in fact, staff members were
permitted to take a day of
vacation only if their absence did
not interfere with the "normal
operation" of Stanford
University. Some were even
threatened with loss of their jobs.
It is clear that Stanford employees
do not have the same freedom to
express their views on the war as
students and faculty.
Recognizing that staff should
have the same right as other
members of this community to
participate fully in the
Moratorium, the New University
Conference, SDS, the Moratorium
open meeting, and the ASSU
Senate have expressed their
support of employees' right to

stop work on November 13th and
14th without loss of pay or leave
time. At the present time, staff
members are circulating a petition
which reads:
I
We, the undersigned members
of the University staff, urge
that staff be permitted to
withhold their services on
November 13th and 14th
without penalty in order to be
able to participate fully in the
November Moratorium.
The Moratorium Committee, in
keeping with its support voted at
the open meeting, is acting as a
clearing house for the petition and i
will make copies available to staff!
members at the Moratorium '
Booth in White Plaza.
N O to Business
As long as present university
policy discriminates against staff
participation in the Moratorium,
the "business" of the University,
including the work done on
Defense Department contracts,
will go on. Students and faculty
can halt classes, but students,
tacuity and staff together can say
NO to business as usual until the
war stops.
