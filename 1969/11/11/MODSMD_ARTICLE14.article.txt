# Liberation Meeting
## Women Attack Their Stereotypes 
### LESLIE CAMPBELL 
Stanford Women's Liberation
discussed the difficulties for
women in combining careers with
child bearing at a meeting last
Wednesday.
Psychology Professor Eleanor
Maccoby, a specialist in child
development, gave a short talk to
the group. She said that she
agreed with some of the Stanford
Women's Liberation Program but
was probably not as "militant" as
the group.
Prof. Maccoby's talk focused
on the nature of the mother-child
relationship from the time the
child is an infant until he is three
years old.
She spoke in detail on child
development and of the
importance in maintaining a
healthy relationship between a

child and his mother, particularly
during the child's first few years.
She claimed that "attachment or
dependency on the mother is a
high-road to independency
late ;on."
Viborous Debate
Prof. Maccoby ended her talk
by stating that "either substitute
care must be found to replace the
mother in her absence or the
mother will be unable to combine
childbearing with her vocation or
studies." This comment stirred
vigorous debate.
An assistant professor in
psychology and recent mother
said that she spends three-fourths
of her salary for housekeeping
help and a babysitter while she
teaches classes at Stanford so that
when she is home she can have
time to be with her baby.

She spoke of the working
mother's dependence on
disciplined planning so that she
can both work and care for her
child.
Another young mother
explained that she had decided
she couldn't go to school after
observing the inadequate
conditions of local day care
institutions.
Child Care Center
Part of a Women's Liberation
proposal to the University is to
have "a child care center,
supported wholly by Stanford and
controlled by the parents, for
children of employees and
students, both male and female."
A young speaker insisted that
the situation at Stanford is a
unique and privileged one. The
financial position and educational
level of women here, she said,
increases their options and
independence in society.
"We must discuss the mass of
unliberated women who don't
have these options," she said.
The common female stereotype
was then brought into question.
Two conventional ideas of the
female role, ideas which are
generally accepted and rarely
questioned, were discussed.
First, the custom that women
are responsible for care of the

child was attacked. The group
agreed that the role of the female
and of the male are made distinct
from the beginning
Subservienl Jobs
Another girl insisted that many
jobs for women are subservient to
men. She said that this becomes
apparent at an early age "when
the girl plays with the boy next
door during elementary school
and she is always the nurseandhe
the doctor."
"Later," she said, "women are
waitresses or secretaries or hold
other positions that usually serve
men." Someone suggested that
male and female roles should be
reversed. "Why isn't the husband
home taking care of the baby and
the wife out doing her daily nine
to five?", she asked.
The idea that it is expectedand
inevitably fulfilling for a woman
to have children was rejected by
some in the group. One young

woman said she much preferred
the stimulating company uf adults
to that of children. She termed
false the conviction that adults
can only achieve complete
fulfillment in lilt' through child
bearing.
Problems of possessiveness,
isolation, and child care could be
breached, one woman said, by
accepting communal living as an
alternative to conventional
methods of family establishment.
An assistant professor in
psychology who had studied child
development on a kibbutz in
Israel said she thought the
communal living created a
healthier social condition for the
children.. Children there were
open to attachment to many
people other than their mothers.
Suggestions for concrete action
to fight discrimination against
women were discussed. A boycott
of all GE products during
Christmas was proposed.
