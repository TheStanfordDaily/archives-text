# Peace Research Society Meets
## 
### 
Social sciences are finally
beginning to overtake and perhaps
even surpass the natural sciences
in their application to the
advancement of mankind. A case
in point is the Peace Research
Society (Western Section) which
met on campus Thursday.
The Peace Research Society is
an international organization
whose main objective is to foster
the exchange of ideas on peace
analysis. The Society attempts to
operate without political bias with
the emphasis on the advancement
toward peace among international
organizations. The topics of
discussion among the scholars in
this Society range from decision
making processes during
international crises to the rational
organization and formalization of
international groups.
The Society, founded in late
1963 in Sweden and Japan, is
composed of 1000 scholars of
diverse backgrounds. Each of
these members is required to
prepare several papers of
considerable depth during his
affiliation with the Society. The
papers are published and made
available to decision-makers on
international policies in many
countries throughout the world.
The Society supports these
scholars in their endeavors by
promoting discussion among its
members and with scholars from
all fields ahd regions of the world,
by stimulating research, by
encouraging the publication of
scholarly studies, and by
performing services to aid the
advancement of its members.
Although the Society does not
interfere with international
decision-making, it makes
available these papers in the hopes
that international leaders will
make use of them and arrive at

clear, rational, and peaceful
solutions to international
disputes. Some of the more noted
members of the Society, such as
Jerzy Sawicki of the Polish
Institute of International Affairs
and Jerome Laulicht of the
Canadian Peace Research Institute
in Toronto, express the hope that
international leaders will make use
of modern social sciences in
determining the outcome of
international confrontations. By
the use of such techniques as
mathematical models,
cybernetical models, causal
models, economic analysis,
cohesion indices, and other
analytical social science methods,
international leaders and decision
makers can make more logical
choices and perhaps more
effectively seek out the proper
path toward peace.
One of the more effective
techniques, that is now in use is
the game model approach. In this
approach, leaders from countries
are represented by scientists who
prepare position papers and then
are given a situation which they
must solve within a given amount
of time. An example of this is the
Berlin Wall Crisis. This precise
situation was discussed and
thought through several weeks
before the actual crisis in a game
model situation in the U.S.
However, the results of this
research were largely ignored.
Leaders of the research society
believe that the possibilities for
peace would be greatly enhanced
if international leaders would only
pay more attention to the
scientific advances being given to
them by the Peace Research
Society. Social science is trying to
come to grips with the problems
of peace in our world. For the
social scientists, the only question
is, will anyone listen to them.

prepare position papers and then
are given a situation which they
must solve within a given amount
of time. An example of this is the
Berlin Wall Crisis. This precise
situation was discussed and
thought through several weeks
before the actual crisis in a game
model situation in the U.S.
However, the results of this
research were largely ignored.
Leaders of the research society
believe that the possibilities for
peace would be greatly enhanced
if international leaders would only
pay more attention to the
scientific advances being given to
them by the Peace Research
Society. Social science is trying to
come to grips with the problems
of peace in our world. For the
social scientists, the only question
is, will anyone listen to them.
Social sciences are finally
beginning to overtake and perhaps
even surpass the natural sciences
in their application to the
advancement of mankind. A case
in point is the Peace Research
Society (Western Section) which
met on campus Thursday.
The Peace Research Society is
an international organization
whose main objective is to foster
the exchange of ideas on peace
analysis. The Society attempts to
operate without political bias with
the emphasis on the advancement
toward peace among international
organizations. The topics of
discussion among the scholars in
this Society range from decision
making processes during
international crises to the rational
organization and formalization of
international groups.
The Society, founded in late
1963 in Sweden and Japan, is
composed of 1000 scholars of
diverse backgrounds. Each of
these members is required to
prepare several papers of
considerable depth during his
affiliation with the Society. The
papers are published and made
available to decision-makers on
international policies in many
countries throughout the world.
The Society supports these
scholars in their endeavors by
promoting discussion among its
members and with scholars from
all fields ahd regions of the world,
by stimulating research, by
encouraging the publication of
scholarly studies, and by
performing services to aid the
advancement of its members.
Although the Society does not
interfere with international
decision-making, it makes
available these papers in the hopes
that international leaders will
make use of them and arrive at

clear, rational, and peaceful
solutions to international
disputes. Some of the more noted
members of the Society, such as
Jerzy Sawicki of the Polish
Institute of International Affairs
and Jerome Laulicht of the
Canadian Peace Research Institute
in Toronto, express the hope that
international leaders will make use
of modern social sciences in
determining the outcome of
international confrontations. By
the use of such techniques as
mathematical models,
cybernetical models, causal
models, economic analysis,
cohesion indices, and other
analytical social science methods,
international leaders and decision
makers can make more logical
choices and perhaps more
effectively seek out the proper
path toward peace.
One of the more effective
techniques, that is now in use is
the game model approach. In this
approach, leaders from countries
are represented by scientists who
prepare position papers and then
are given a situation which they
must solve within a given amount
of time. An example of this is the
Berlin Wall Crisis. This precise
situation was discussed and
thought through several weeks
