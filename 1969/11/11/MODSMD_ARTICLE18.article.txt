# Ecology Action
## 
### 
Fifty people participated in a two-mile bicycle
ride through Palo Alto and Stanford Saturday, in
an unusual demonstration aimed at automobiles,
smog, and traffic congestion.
The bike parade was the first activity sponsored
by the new Peninsula Chapter of Ecology Action,
a group that believes in using active tactics to raise
the public's awareness of environmental problems.
Participants in Saturday's bike ride included
high school and Stanford students, and a number
of local residents of assorted ages and sizes. The
riders wore or carried signs, displaying slogans like
"I am a smog-free engine," and "Drive less and
enjoy it more." Motorists along the route were
greeted with calls of "cars make smog," and
"Don't driveâ€”it's bad for our health."
The bicycle parade was staged to play up the
advantages of two-wheeled transportation, and to
encourage people not to drive when they don't
need to.
The new group is also planning other activities.
