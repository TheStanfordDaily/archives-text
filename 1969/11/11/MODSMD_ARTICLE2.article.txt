# Support For Pitzer
## Many Favor Allowing Class 
### CRAIG WILSON 
The decision by President
Kenneth Pitzer not to cancel
classes Nov. 13 and 14 for the
Vietnam Moratorium was assailed
Monday night by the Chairman of
the Student Senate as an aloof
"parochial view of politics."
"I wonder what Nazi Germany
would have thought about that,"
asked Dave Edwards as he
pondered Pitzer's remarks.
Campus reaction among faculty
and students last night seemed
generally favorable to Pitzer's
remarks.
Edwards chaired the meeting of
the Senate which voted last week
to ask Pitzer to cancel classes both
days. The Senate voted 19-9 with
one abstention to make the
request.
Sunday, Pitzer reaffirmed his
personal support for individuals
who participate in the Vietnam
Moratorium, but declined the
student request that he officially
cancel all classes

In that statement, Pitzer said,
"For the University, as an
institution, to take an official
position on an issue of public
policy, not directly related to the
University would infringe the
academic freedom of those in the
community who might disagree
with that position.
"(It) would injure the long
range interests of all who see the
strength of the University as
residing in its hospitality to the
full range of opinion, no matter
how unpopular some might be."
Other student reactions around
campus to Pitzer's statement were
mixed.
Barry Askinas, of the Council
of Presidents, said "It doesn't
come as a surprise because it is
consistent with previous stands
the administration has taken. I
think it is a mistake for the
University not to take a stand on
this issue which I see as a moral
issue as opposed to a political
issue.

"By calling Vietnam a political
issue, this is an excuse not to
confront the moral issue. The
Uiiversity should show where it
stands on this issue," he added.
Pat Shea, also a member of the
Council of Presidents, said that
"The Moratorium is a voluntary
activity and students should have
the opportunity to express
themselves by not attending
classes."
"As far as the cancellation of
classes, this would have very little
meaning, since 80 to 90 percent
of the students won't get to class
anyway."
Shea added however, that he
wished, "there had been a
stronger statement as to allowing
employees, that is staff and
clerical help, to rearrange working
hours to permit them to
participate in the Moratorium."
Employee Meeting
Last night, The Daily talked to
Roland Finston of the United
Stanford Employees (USE) who
said the organization would bring
up Pitzer's statement for
discussion Wednesday night at its
meeting in Bishop Auditorium.
"As an individual," said
Finston "I hope there will be a
relaxation of the restrictions on
employees so that it will be
considered the right of employees
to participate in the Moratorium
regardless of impact on the
Un iversi tyâ€”provided the
employee gives a day notice in
advance to his supervisor.
"I hope this will be made clear
before Friday."
Professors Favorable
The reaction among most
professors questioned by The
Daily was favorable to Pitzer's
statement.
Steven Kline, professor of
mechanical engineering, said that
"I agree with President Pitzer. If
the University does anything
other than that, the University
would be destroyed. It is the
obligation of the University to
train people to participate in
things."
Professor David Potter of the
History Department said that
"Pitzer's statement is perfectly
correct. I don't think the
President has the right to exercise
the function of canceling classes."
Edward Greenberg an Assistant
Professor of Political Science said
that he didn't know if the
Ihiversity had the right to cancel
classes.
Said Greenberg, "It should be
up to each faculty member in
consultation with his classes to
decide on cancellation. I don't
know if the University as an
institution should have the right
to cancel all its classes."
