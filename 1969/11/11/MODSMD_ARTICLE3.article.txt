# People Prefer VC, Claims Viet Critic

The United States not only has lost the war in Vietnam but
continues to delude itself in thinking that victory is possible according
to Tom Fox, a Stanford graduate who has worked among the
Vietnamese refugees.
"There's no question in the minds of the Vietnamese people that
the war is over right now. The U.S. and the Saigon government have
lost," Fox claimed Sunday night in the Donner Lounge.
The current Stern guest-in-residence pointed to two major
American mistakes that have led to a recent upsurge in Vietcong
popularity. "First it was the American bombing, and then the lack of
concern for the importance that the Vietnamese attach to living in
one's own village."
A plan to weed out Vietcong through an identification card system
failed, according to Fox. Even in cities where a high percentage of the
people had strong positive feelings toward the Vietcong, almost
everyone had ID cards. "Being pro-Front is a matter of attitudes,
something the Americans have still not realized," concluded Fox.
The refugee worker then turned to future alternatives, commenting
"The 'bloodbath' that would supposedly follow a U.S. withdrawal is
an issue in the U.S., but not in the minds of the Vietnamese." He felt
the only "bloodbath" to worry about was the one provided by
American presence.
Fox stated the Vietnamese "do realize that there would be some
people, probably some 200,000 to 500,000 who would have to be
protected," but this need not demand a continued American military
presence in Vietnam, he declared. The "bloodbath scare," Fox
maintained, "is just a lot of Nixon rhetoric."
In a speech last night he used two Vietnamese proverbs to explain
the feelings of the Vietcong and the Vietnamese people at the Paris
talks. The first, "when the bandits come to the house, the women
must fight," shows "it is no accident that one of the NLF's
representatives in Paris is a woman."
The second proverb declares "When you can't catch the thief,
forgive him and merit virtue." Fox said it is obvious to the
Vietnamese that the Americans will not catch the "thieves." "Why
not offer them the most magnanimous settlement possible and rise in
world opinion?"
The Stanford graduate said atrocities are committed by both sides,
but those of the NLF are more humane. "It is much more human to
shoot a person in the head than to bomb him by computer from
Thailand."
Fox will conclude his discussions on Vietnam this afternoon at
4:30 p.m. in the Donner Lounge.

one's own village."
A plan to weed out Vietcong through an identification card system
failed, according to Fox. Even in cities where a high percentage of the
people had strong positive feelings toward the Vietcong, almost
everyone had ID cards. "Being pro-Front is a matter of attitudes,
something the Americans have still not realized," concluded Fox.
The refugee worker then turned to future alternatives, commenting
"The 'bloodbath' that would supposedly follow a U.S. withdrawal is
an issue in the U.S., but not in the minds of the Vietnamese." He felt
the only "bloodbath" to worry about was the one provided by
American presence.
Fox stated the Vietnamese "do realize that there would be some
people, probably some 200,000 to 500,000 who would have to be
protected," but this need not demand a continued American military
presence in Vietnam, he declared. The "bloodbath scare," Fox
maintained, "is just a lot of Nixon rhetoric."
In a speech last night he used two Vietnamese proverbs to explain
the feelings of the Vietcong and the Vietnamese people at the Paris
talks. The first, "when the bandits come to the house, the women
must fight," shows "it is no accident that one of the NLF's
representatives in Paris is a woman."
The second proverb declares "When you can't catch the thief,
forgive him and merit virtue." Fox said it is obvious to the
Vietnamese that the Americans will not catch the "thieves." "Why
not offer them the most magnanimous settlement possible and rise in
world opinion?"
The Stanford graduate said atrocities are committed by both sides,
but those of the NLF are more humane. "It is much more human to
shoot a person in the head than to bomb him by computer from
Thailand."
Fox will conclude his discussions on Vietnam this afternoon at
4:30 p.m. in the Donner Lounge.
The United States not only has lost the war in Vietnam but
continues to delude itself in thinking that victory is possible according
to Tom Fox, a Stanford graduate who has worked among the
Vietnamese refugees.
"There's no question in the minds of the Vietnamese people that
the war is over right now. The U.S. and the Saigon government have
lost," Fox claimed Sunday night in the Donner Lounge.
The current Stern guest-in-residence pointed to two major
American mistakes that have led to a recent upsurge in Vietcong
popularity. "First it was the American bombing, and then the lack of
concern for the importance that the Vietnamese attach to living in
one's own village."
