# Tunney Says America Overreacts To Threats
## 
### CHRIS COBEY 
Representative John V. Tunney
yesterday declared that the
United States has "long been
overreacting to various security
threats around the world," and
called for an "orderly devolution"
of American military influence in
foreign nations.
The Democratic Congressman
from Riverside and Imperial
Counties said that the decade of
the Sixties had made the United
States aware of the limits of its
power and its wealth. "The Sixties
taught us that we could not do
everything well."
Tunney expressed confidence
in the younger generation by
pointing out that they have been
responsible tor returning the
country to "a policy of
moderation and prudence" in
foreign commitments.
In the 1970'5, said Tunney,
"We shall frame our aspirations
according to our means." He
denied that such an attitude was
analogous to the isolationism of
the 1930'5.: "A little knowledge is
a dangerous thing, but a little
history is positively fatal." He
cautioned that the U.S. should
not be "seduced into some other
fatuous adventure" like Vietnam.
Congress and Foreign Policy
Tunney, a potential Democratic
candidate for the U.S. Senate next
year, criticized Congress for its
apathy in the past regarding
foreign policy. He said, "Vietnam
has awakened us to the
opportunities of Congressional
scrutiny of foreign policy." He
added that the national legislature
must assert its right to declare
war, with the power of activating
troops which accompany that act.
The power of the Congress to
appropriate funds is the key
factor in holding the executive
accountable for its actions,
Tunney said.
He called U.S. foreign policy
"bloated" because sixty percent
of the federal budget is used for
"foreign policy goals." The
Congressman asserted that "We
must re-orient our priorities to
meet needs here at home."
Future U.S. Policy
Tunney proposed that in the
coming decade U.S. defense
expenditures be cut back to
pre-Vietnam levels. He stated such
cuts would not leave us militarily
vulnerable, and that "nations can
grow paranoic" about defense
needs.
An audience estimated at 200
people heard Tunney attack the
United States' continued military
support of Western European
nations and Japan.
According to the legislator,

Japan's status is that of an
"American protectorate" as long
as the U S. continues to assume
defense responsibilities for that
nation. Since 1 945, Japan has had
no defense expenditures and its
economic growth has been such
that it ranks only behind the
Lhited States and the USSR in
terms of gross national product.
Tunney urged that American
defense commitments in Europe,
made as a temporary program to
help revitalize other nations there,
be assumed by the countries
themselves, and that "regional
responsibility" take the place of
America as protector.
Indefinite Commitinent?
President Nixon's recent speech
on the war can be interpreted as
an "indefinite commitment of
troops" to South Vietnam in the
course of "Vietnamizing" that
conflict, according to Tunney. He
saw little chance for immediate

success of that policy, since the
U.S. has not been able to pull out
of Southeast Asia in the past five
years.
In response to questions from
the floor, Tunney declared that
"nationalism is the wave of the
future," and that he foresees an
eventual "world federation."
On the grape boycott, Tunney
protested that his position had
been misrepresented. "I do not
eat grapes," he stated.
He said that he has worked to
have farm laborers included under
the protectio of the National
labor Relations Act, and has
protested to the President the
Defense Department's 350%
increase in the purchase of table
grapes.
As a Congressman, Tunney
spoke of the frustrations of trying
to obtain information from the
Defense Department on the
conduct of the war.

that it ranks only behind the
Lhited States and the USSR in
terms of gross national product.
Tunney urged that American
defense commitments in Europe,
made as a temporary program to
help revitalize other nations there,
be assumed by the countries
themselves, and that "regional
responsibility" take the place of
America as protector.
Indefinite Commitinent?
President Nixon's recent speech
on the war can be interpreted as
an "indefinite commitment of
troops" to South Vietnam in the
course of "Vietnamizing" that
conflict, according to Tunney. He
saw little chance for immediate

success of that policy, since the
U.S. has not been able to pull out
of Southeast Asia in the past five
years.
In response to questions from
the floor, Tunney declared that
"nationalism is the wave of the
future," and that he foresees an
eventual "world federation."
On the grape boycott, Tunney
protested that his position had
been misrepresented. "I do not
eat grapes," he stated.
He said that he has worked to
have farm laborers included under
the protectio of the National
labor Relations Act, and has
protested to the President the
Defense Department's 350%
increase in the purchase of table
grapes.
As a Congressman, Tunney
spoke of the frustrations of trying

CONGRESSMAN JOHN V. TUNNEY—Speaking yesterday as part of the
Political Union's symposium The California Democrat struck at the United
States foreign policy and warned that "we should ix>t be seduced into another
fatuous adventure," like Vietnam
Representative John V. Tunney
yesterday declared that the
United States has "long been
overreacting to various security
threats around the world," and
called for an "orderly devolution"
of American military influence in
foreign nations.
The Democratic Congressman
from Riverside and Imperial
Counties said that the decade of
the Sixties had made the United
States aware of the limits of its
power and its wealth. "The Sixties
taught us that we could not do
everything well."
Tunney expressed confidence
in the younger generation by
pointing out that they have been
responsible tor returning the
country to "a policy of
moderation and prudence" in
foreign commitments.
In the 1970'5, said Tunney,
"We shall frame our aspirations
according to our means." He
denied that such an attitude was
analogous to the isolationism of
the 1930'5.: "A little knowledge is
a dangerous thing, but a little
history is positively fatal." He
cautioned that the U.S. should
not be "seduced into some other
fatuous adventure" like Vietnam.
Congress and Foreign Policy
Tunney, a potential Democratic
candidate for the U.S. Senate next
year, criticized Congress for its
apathy in the past regarding
foreign policy. He said, "Vietnam
has awakened us to the
opportunities of Congressional
scrutiny of foreign policy." He
added that the national legislature
must assert its right to declare
war, with the power of activating
troops which accompany that act.
The power of the Congress to
appropriate funds is the key
factor in holding the executive
accountable for its actions,
Tunney said.
He called U.S. foreign policy
"bloated" because sixty percent
of the federal budget is used for
"foreign policy goals." The
Congressman asserted that "We
must re-orient our priorities to
meet needs here at home."
Future U.S. Policy
Tunney proposed that in the
coming decade U.S. defense
expenditures be cut back to
pre-Vietnam levels. He stated such
cuts would not leave us militarily
vulnerable, and that "nations can
grow paranoic" about defense
needs.
An audience estimated at 200
people heard Tunney attack the
United States' continued military
support of Western European
nations and Japan.
