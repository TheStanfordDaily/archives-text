### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Senate
Armed Services Committee
declared unanimously Monday it
will report out a draft-by-lottery
bill but will insist that advocates
of sweeping reforms offer no
amendments from the floor.
In an attempt to win
amendment assurances from the
proponents of a general overhaul
of Selective Service, the
committee provised to open
extensive hearings on this subject
not later than Feb. 15.
Chairman John Stennis
(D-Miss), said he will meet
Tuesday with refonn-minded
senators to seek pledges that they
will not try to broaden the
House-passed bill which provides
for random selection and
concentration of inductions
among 19-year-olds.

He said he would call Secretary
of Defense Melvin R. Laird and a
representative of the Selective
Service System to testify briefly
on President Nixon's lottery
proposal.
But he said all members of the
committee have promised to send
the lottery measure to the Senate
for action without amendments.
If attempts are made to amend
it, Stennis said, he will withdraw
the bill, killing all chances for its
passage this year.

WASHINGTON (APhSen. J.W.
Fulbright (D-Ark.), charged
Monday the "extreme
emotionalism" aroused by Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew's
speeches has led to the worst mail

he's had in 15 years and leads him
to fear the nation may be on the
verge of a rebirth of McCarthyism.
"I'm now receiving the most
threatening and meanest letters
I've received since the days of Joe
McCarthy," Fulbright, chairman
of the Foreign Relations
Committee, told a news
conference.
"I blame this on the accusation
that those who disagree with the
administration's Vietnam policy
are traitors and the direct charge
by Agnew that we senators critical
of the Administration's Vietnam
war policies are responsible for
the continuation of the war and
increased battle deaths,"
Fulbright said.
He said the Agnew speeches are
arousing the same emotions and
passions as those stirred by Sen.

Memphis
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)-Police
used tear gas Monday night to
disperse about 100 young Negroes
who defied an earlier pact made
by city officials and Negro
demonstration leaders to avoid a
racial confrontation in the streets.
Police said rocks and bottles were
thrown at officers.
Police said the crowd broke up
within minutes after fogging
machines began spewing out
clouds of the gas.
Minor vandalism broke out in
Negro sections of the city, police
said.
A group of Negro organizations
calling themselves the Black
Coalition, had planned a street
march Monday afternoon to bring
attention to their demands for
more representation in school
affairs and to support a
predominantly Negro union's
strike against a Catholic hospital.
However, in order to avoid
violence, the march leaders,
including the Rev. Ralph David
Abernathy, had agreed to submit
to arrest at a certain point in the
march and send the rest of the
marchers home, Asst. City Atty.
Fierson Graves said.
The police had banned a rush
hour march by the demonstrators
in the street, but said a single-file
procession along the sidewalk
would be allowed.
Fifty-two persons, including
Abernathy, head of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference,
were arrested and charged with
disorderly conduct. Most were
released within the hour after
posting $26 bail or on their own
recognizance.

WASHINGTON (AP)-The Senate
Armed Services Committee
declared unanimously Monday it
will report out a draft-by-lottery
bill but will insist that advocates
of sweeping reforms offer no
amendments from the floor.
In an attempt to win
amendment assurances from the
proponents of a general overhaul
of Selective Service, the
committee provised to open
extensive hearings on this subject
not later than Feb. 15.
Chairman John Stennis
(D-Miss), said he will meet
Tuesday with refonn-minded
senators to seek pledges that they
will not try to broaden the
House-passed bill which provides
for random selection and
concentration of inductions
among 19-year-olds.

He said he would call Secretary
of Defense Melvin R. Laird and a
representative of the Selective
Service System to testify briefly
on President Nixon's lottery
proposal.
But he said all members of the
committee have promised to send
the lottery measure to the Senate
for action without amendments.
If attempts are made to amend
it, Stennis said, he will withdraw
the bill, killing all chances for its
passage this year.

Monday the "extreme
emotionalism" aroused by Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew's
speeches has led to the worst mail

he's had in 15 years and leads him
to fear the nation may be on the
verge of a rebirth of McCarthyism.
"I'm now receiving the most
threatening and meanest letters
I've received since the days of Joe
McCarthy," Fulbright, chairman
of the Foreign Relations

"I blame this on the accusation
that those who disagree with the

are traitors and the direct charge
by Agnew that we senators critical
of the Administration's Vietnam
war policies are responsible for
the continuation of the war and
increased battle deaths,"

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)-Police
used tear gas Monday night to
disperse about 100 young Negroes
who defied an earlier pact made
by city officials and Negro
demonstration leaders to avoid a
racial confrontation in the streets.
Police said rocks and bottles were
thrown at officers.
Police said the crowd broke up
within minutes after fogging
machines began spewing out
clouds of the gas.
Minor vandalism broke out in
Negro sections of the city, police
said.
A group of Negro organizations
calling themselves the Black
Coalition, had planned a street
march Monday afternoon to bring
attention to their demands for
more representation in school
affairs and to support a
predominantly Negro union's
strike against a Catholic hospital.
However, in order to avoid
violence, the march leaders,
including the Rev. Ralph David
