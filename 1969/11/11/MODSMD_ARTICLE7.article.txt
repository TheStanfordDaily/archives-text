# SDS May Militantly Oppose G-E Recruting On Campus
## 
### JOHN SLOAN 
Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) last night
considered the possibility of
militant demonstrations against
General Electric and discussed
plans to leaflet and march in this
month's antiwar protests.
Members also voiced support
for any publication which prints
confidential files stolen in last
year's sit-in.
The proposed protest against
General Electric recruiting on
campus Monday, and a future
boycott of all G.E. products
because of the company's present
strike was the first order of the
meeting in front of more than 50
people in Branner dining room.
Leaf letting Industrial Park, a

Guerilla Theater and band,
discussion groups on the war and
plans for co-ordinating Saturday's
San Francisco march were the
topics dealing with the November
Moritorium.
"The SDS has remained too
aloof from the Moratorium,"
observed one female speaker. "We
must become more involved after
the 15th or else the movement
will die," she continued.
Bruce Pollock interrupted the
meeting at one point by stating,
"There is someone here who has
been fucking us over for a long
time in his editorials." He pointed
out James McNabb of the Palo
Alto Times as the person present.
A discussion ensued, and after a
vote McNabb was asked to leave.
He did so without protest.

Debate then moved to plans for
a demonstration to protest the
visit of Japanese Prime Minister
Sato to San Francisco. Ideas
included co-sponsoring a Guerilla
Theater in front of the new
Japanese Trade and Cultural
Center and a general
demonstration.
The last issue discussed was
support for any publication which
chooses to print documents
considered confidential by the
University. At hand are the
controversial salary lists, but one
of the people present suggested
that some far more revealing
information (such as a fully
detailed university budget) might
come out in the future.
