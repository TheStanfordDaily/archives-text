. . . the end is chaos . . .
Editor, THE DAILY:
Have Stanford students ever
paused to consider how closely
their attitude on the national issue
of Vietnam this fall parallels their
attitude on the local question of
SRI last spring?
In both cases, the students were
absolutely "right" and everyone
had to agree with them—or else.
In the case of SRI, the students
were outraged when the Trustees
refused to ignore the desires of
3000 SRI employees and do as
the students demanded. In the
case of Vietnam, the students are
indignant because the government
will not ignore the wishes of the
majority of the people and the
consequences of neo-isolationism.
Last spring, the students
despaired that peaceful action
would accomplish anything, and
sat in long before the SRI study
committee report was released.
This week, Pat Shea is quoted as
saying it is difficult to remain
responsible when the president of
the United States won't do as he
(Shea) demands.
And last spring, the movement
was led into the streets and into
the Industrial Park. This fall, the
movement has gone again into the
streets (peacefully so far) and - if
the radicals can swing it—will go
back into the Park.
In short, students are making
two mistakes that in the long run
pose far more danger to
democracy than anything
happening in Washington: they
are insisting that they have a
monopoly on wisdom and
morality, and that the nation
accordingly must do as they say;
and they are moving slowly but
surely from the legislative halls
into the streets. Actually, they are
being led into the streets, but they
do not know this, nor do they
have the intellectual honesty to
consider that that is even a
possibility. It is only a short
distance in political terms from
the Old Union to Hanover Street
to Telegraph Ave. to the
barricades of Paris to the
mini-wars of Tokyo, and students
are incredibly naive if they do not
realize that they are being
escalated in that direction. Sure,
the motives are pure and good,
but the end result is chaos.

Join the Circus
Editor, THE DAILY:
As one of the no-longer-silent
majority, I write in behalf of
President Nixon and President
Pitzer, and against the
Moratorium. Obviously, we are all
agreed on ends: to terminate the
war. However, I strongly disagree
with means which include,
essentially, a strike against the
government. The extraordinarily
difficult task being attempted in
good faith by specialist members
of the federal government
deserves sympathetic support and
i'on«truct ive criticism, not the

naive and inflammatory hyperbole
which appeared (to quote only
one example), in the first sentence
of the Student Senate Resolution
printed in the Daily, Monday,
November 10, 1969.
Complex system problems,
whether they be traffic safety,
city planning, poverty or war, are
not solved by parading,
name-calling, and malingering. It
is my firm conviction that any
person who stops the work for
which he is legitimately
responsible to join this circus
whether he intends so or not, is
guilty of treason.

Savage Mayings
Editor, THE DAILY:
The other day, at noon, I saw a
series of savage slayings at
Tresidder. A youngster of about
nine or ten, with no look of
compassion, took to burying
lovely little bees under pebbles,
under glasses, under books.
I could sense the horror, but no
one spoke as the boy delightedly
pronounced his victims dead. Is
this the way to peace? Is this the
way to love?
"Now try the Bayshore," one
student told that same boy while
leaving the scene of the mass
murder. But it was too late. The
bees were dead.
Do children have the right to

murder bees? Do adults have the
right to let children murder bees?
The boy's father, a man, was
watching from the balcony. One
day that boy will be a man, just
like his father.

Why Su Uptight
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to ask President
Nixon one little question
concerning his speech of
November 3. If the silent majority
of which he speaks is really a
majority, then why is he so up
tight?
