# Protest Rally Gains Permit
## 
### ED KOHN 
Momentum for this week's
nationwide peace marches
continued to build as the federal
government yesterday backed
down and said that it would
permit anti-war protesters to use
part of Washington, D.C.'s
Pennsylvania Avenue for
Saturday's planned March on
Washington.
At the same time, an advance
party from the 82nd Airborne
Division flew to nearby Andrews
Air Force Base, Va. to check out
communications and billeting for
the 1,500 to 2,000 paratroopers
expected to be flown in for the
weekend.
The Defense Department called
the move "a normal part of the
precautionary measures that we
have been asked to take by the
Justice Department."
The agreement between the
New Mobilization Committee to
End the War in Vietnam and the
government followed days of
near-continuous negotiations
between the two parties. It allows
the procession, expected to
attract 200,000 marchers, to
proceed down the traditional
parade avenue from the Capitol as
far as Fifteenth Street and from
there to the grounds of the
Washington Monument. The rally
there will climax three days of
anti-war activities.
The route made no provision
for a swing past the White House,
one point that the Mobilization
Committee had demanded. The
agreement came after the
committee agreed to provide
2,000 parade marshals to keep
demonstrators on the south side
of Pennsylvania Avenue and
another 500 marshals to keep
crowds away from government
buildings on the other side of the
street.
San Francisco March
Meanwhile, in San Francisco,
Moratorium activities got
underway Monday with a 24-hour
fast and anti-war symposium by
Asian scholars at Grace Cathedral.
Activities there will culminate
Saturday in a march expected by
leaders of the New Mobilization
Committee West to attract
100,000 to 250,000 war
dissenters. March leaders said
yesterday that they hope the
march and demonstrations will be
peaceful.
The march is slated to start at 7
a.m. at Pier 29 on the
Embarcadero and climax at 2 p.m.
at the Polo Grounds with a rally.
Mayor Alioto endorsed the
anti-war activity and plans to issue
a proclamation urging its peaceful
observance.
"It would be a shame," Alioto
said, "if thousands of persons
who wish to express themsevles
by marching would be
discouraged from attending by the
threat of a few radicals, We can
handle the radicals and the
violence, so no one should be
afraid to take part in the march."
New York Lie-In
In New York, a 40,000 person
lie-in is planned for Friday
morning on the Sheep Meadow in

Central Park. Plans there are being
organized by the New York
Vietnam Moratorium Committee.
Although a definite schedule
has not yet been completed, other
activities scheduled for the city
include "town hall" meetings in
each borough, two symposiums,
one for labor leaders and one for
members of the medical
profession; a religious leaders'
workshop; and rallies for high
school students and theatrical
personnel.

has not yet been completed, other
activities scheduled for the city
include "town hall" meetings in
each borough, two symposiums,
one for labor leaders and one for
members of the medical
profession; a religious leaders'
workshop; and rallies for high
school students and theatrical
personnel.
Momentum for this week's
nationwide peace marches
continued to build as the federal
government yesterday backed
down and said that it would
permit anti-war protesters to use
part of Washington, D.C.'s
Pennsylvania Avenue for
Saturday's planned March on
Washington.
At the same time, an advance
party from the 82nd Airborne
Division flew to nearby Andrews
Air Force Base, Va. to check out
communications and billeting for
the 1,500 to 2,000 paratroopers
expected to be flown in for the
weekend.
The Defense Department called
the move "a normal part of the
precautionary measures that we
have been asked to take by the
Justice Department."
The agreement between the
New Mobilization Committee to
End the War in Vietnam and the
government followed days of
near-continuous negotiations
between the two parties. It allows
the procession, expected to
attract 200,000 marchers, to
proceed down the traditional
parade avenue from the Capitol as
far as Fifteenth Street and from
there to the grounds of the
Washington Monument. The rally
there will climax three days of
anti-war activities.
The route made no provision
for a swing past the White House,
one point that the Mobilization
Committee had demanded. The
agreement came after the
committee agreed to provide
2,000 parade marshals to keep
demonstrators on the south side
of Pennsylvania Avenue and
another 500 marshals to keep
crowds away from government
buildings on the other side of the
street.
San Francisco March
Meanwhile, in San Francisco,
Moratorium activities got
underway Monday with a 24-hour
fast and anti-war symposium by
Asian scholars at Grace Cathedral.
Activities there will culminate
Saturday in a march expected by
leaders of the New Mobilization
Committee West to attract
100,000 to 250,000 war
dissenters. March leaders said
yesterday that they hope the
march and demonstrations will be
peaceful.
The march is slated to start at 7
a.m. at Pier 29 on the
Embarcadero and climax at 2 p.m.
at the Polo Grounds with a rally.
Mayor Alioto endorsed the
anti-war activity and plans to issue
a proclamation urging its peaceful
observance.
"It would be a shame," Alioto
said, "if thousands of persons
who wish to express themsevles
by marching would be
discouraged from attending by the
threat of a few radicals, We can
handle the radicals and the
violence, so no one should be
afraid to take part in the march."
New York Lie-In
In New York, a 40,000 person
lie-in is planned for Friday
morning on the Sheep Meadow in

Central Park. Plans there are being
organized by the New York
Vietnam Moratorium Committee.
Although a definite schedule
has not yet been completed, other
activities scheduled for the city
include "town hall" meetings in
each borough, two symposiums,
one for labor leaders and one for
