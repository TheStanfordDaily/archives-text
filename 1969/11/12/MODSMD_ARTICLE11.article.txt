Incorrect Impressions
Editor, THE DAILY:
Recent reports about faculty
salaries at Stanford, particularly as
they relate to the Department of
Political Science, have created
grossly incorrect impressions
about University and
departmental personnel policy.
Students-both undergraduate and
graduate—have an understandable
interest in the standards which are
used in rewarding faculty for
performance, and they deserve a
more balanced picture than has
been drawn from only one
document reporting the situation
in one year, 1967-68.
Each year has its own
problems, and each year produces
its own pattern of rewards. In the
academic year 1967-68 the
Department was faced with the
possible loss of one of its most
creative members-Professor
Sidney Verba--a scholar whose
record of graduate and
undergraduate teaching, scholarly
accomplishment, and University
service, was outstanding.
In cases of this kind, when the
Department must make an effort
to retain a good man, the
University makes available funds
in excess of the normal
departmental raise funds. In other
words, such raises are not
detrimental to other members of
the Department.
In the case of Professor Verba,
the raise amounted to 14%. Two
years earlier in a similar situation
of possible loss of a faculty
member—this time one with a fine
undergradute teaching record but
little, if any, publication—this
person received a promotion in
rank and a salary raise of 43%.
Since 1964-65, two other
members of the Department were
promoted in rank and substantial
salary increases in recognition of
their contribution to
undergraduate teaching, without
reference at all to any publication.
And more recently a member of
our Department was given a raise
of 25% for service to the
University and outstanding
undergraduate teaching.
The Department seeks to
reward all important aspects of
scholarly performance
—undergraduate teaching, training
of Ph.D.'s, research and
publication, University or public
service, and so on. Each year
every member is evaluated in
terms of all of these criteria, not
in terms of one criterion alone to
the exclusion of others.
We would insist that in the last
five or six years a consistent effort
has been made to rectify salaries
which, in our judgement, did not
meet acceptable standards. In one
year or another, raises to
particular members were well
above normal raises, ranging from
10 to 20 per cent. Some of the
problematics of salaries stem from ,
the fact that the Department of
Political Science has practically
doubled in size in the last ten
years.
The new men drawn in, at any
professorial level, have been hired
at going rates of pay which are
higher than those paid to the
original faculty. The normal funds
available for salary increases could
never bridge this gap. Only a
University-wide effort can deal
with possible differentials of this
kind.

Nevertheless, steps to reduce
these differences were taken by
the Department last year and will
; be continued during the current
year. At the same time, there
must always be merit increases
; based on a faculty member's
record in a given year, and as a
result salary differentials within
ranks will always remain a fact of
academic life.
The Department of Political
Science can take considerable
pride in its progress in the last
decade. This progress has been
reflected in the substantial
increase in the number, variety
and quality of offerings in
undergraduate instruction, the
high ranking of our graduate
program nationally, the
production of scholarly work by
many members of our faculty and
international recognition of the
Stanford Department as a center
of excellence.

March Against Death
Editor, THE DAILY:
The NEW MOBILIZATION
COMMITTEE TO END THE
WAR IN VIETNAM has planned
the following march for
November 13:
THE MARCH AGAINST
DEATH: It is to symbolize and
pay tribute to the Americans and
Vietnamese who have been
slaughtered in Vietnam. The
march will begin at Arlington
National Cemetry at 12:00
Midnight on November 13 and
will move single file past the
White House and to the Capitol.
Each marcher will carry the name
of a war victim and each marcher
will place that name in a coffin at
the Capitol. On Saturday
morning, November 15, after the
march ends, the coffins bearing
the names of the dead will be
taken to the White House. The
fallowing, are the goals of this
march:
a. immediate and total
withdrawal from Vietnam
b. self-determination for
Vietnam and black America
c. end ABM and all forms of
militarism
d. end racism and poverty
e. free speech for Gl's
112. self-government for
Washington, D.C.
g. stop the repression—free all
political prisoners

Genetic Differences
Editor, THE DAILY:
I cannot help commenting on
the article by John Johnston in a
recent issue on Dr. William
Shockley's efforts to gain support
for a study of genetic differences
between whites and blacks. In
some ways Dr. Shockley's efforts
parallel the work of Professor
Arthur Jensen of Berkeley;
moreover, both men have come
under strong, if not vicious
attacks for their views.

I think that I am as dedicated
to the disinterested pursuit of
truth as any academician, but it
also seems to me that there is
reason to doubt that a study of
the alleged inferiority of Negroes
is really an exercise that deserves
support. I am not referring to he
small mountain of scientific
studies that conclude there are no
sound grounds for seeing genetic
differences between the mental
capacities of Negroes and whites.
My reasons are more simple than
those that derive from that
complicated body of evidence.
My reason for doubting the
value of Dr. Shockley's project
stems from the question of who is
a Negro. In the United States a
Negro is anyone with African
ancestry, regardless of degree. Yet
a moment's reflection will make it
clear that there is no reason,
either logically or genetically, that
such needs to be the definition.
The offspring of a black and a
white, for example, is no more a
black than a white, either logically
or genetically.
That the definition of a Negro
in the United States is simply
cultural, rather than genetical or
logical, is shown by the fact that
in most other countries of the
western hemisphere a Negro is
anyone who has no white
ancestry. People of mixed
background are mulatoes, pardos,
morenos, etc. The relevance of
this points to the present issue is
that virtually all tests or studies of
Negro-white differences made in
this country are based on the
definition of the Negro current in
the United States.
Yet it is evident that
light-skinned '"Negro" is
genetically different from a
dark-skinned "Negro," if only
because the former must have
more white "blood" than the
darker one. To put all people with
any amount of African ancestry
into the same category, as the
United States definition does,
vitiates any conslucions in regard
to genetics, it would seem to me.
For them we are dealing with a
population that is homogeneous
only in tlx l social sense—that is,
under the Ur.iied States definition
of a Negro—but which varies
widely in the color and other
physical characteristics of its
members, and therefore,
presumably, in its genetic
makeup. In short, how can one
take about Negroes genetically as
a group when that group is
defined culturally and not
genetically?
Then there is another question
that arises in my mind when I
read about efforts finally to
ascertain scientifically the alleged
inferiority of the Negro. Why this
concentrated and prolonged
concern to prove inferiority? The
same kind of impressionistic
evidence used to justify studies of
alleged Negro inferiority exists to
suggest that Jews are superior to
most other peoples. For example,
think of the relatively tiny
number of Jews in the world and
the strikingly large number of
geniuses who have come out of
that tiny minority. They range
from Jesus to Spinoza, Marx,
Einstein, and Freud, to mention
only the best known. Moreover,
the important role that Jews play
in he intellectual life of the

Lhited States alone ought to
arouse the interest of those who
seek the ethnic of genetic sources
of mental ability. Only a couple
of months ago C.P. Snow was
quoted in the New York Times as
saying that Jews were generally
mentally superior to other
peoples. Yet I do not know of any
present or past effort to study
scientifically the alleged
superiority of Jews over the rest
of us. Perhaps when you are in the
allegedly inferior position it is
easier to see the flaws in the
argument and the evidence.

Racist Shoe
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Monday's letter
to the editor concerning the

Nairobi book drive—Yes, Mr.
Parham, more needs to be said. If
Stanford is truly a white racist
community, then giving books,
many of them written by whites,
to Nairobi is an attempt to spread
the ways and ideas of the white
man, something you seem to be
against.
According to Webster's
Dictionary, racism is "radical
prejudice or discrimination: race
hatred." Your attempt at
intimidation clearly puts the racist
shoe on the other foot.
A copy of the dictionary is
being sent to the Nariobi book
drive in he hope that you will find
occasion to use it.
