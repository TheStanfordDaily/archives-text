# False Facts
## Black Tutorials 
### 
(The following is a statement
issued by black students in the
medical school.)
An article printed recently in
the Daily (Stanford) concerning
the Minority Program of the
Medical School presents many
false facts and derogatory
implications about the black
students in the first year class.
It was reported that there were
tutorial programs available for the
minority students. A tutorial
program offered at the Medical
School is provided for the benefit
of the entire student body. We
black students do not feel that
our so-called "secondary"
educations warrant any special
tutorial programs for us. We are
sure that such schools as Bryn
Mawr, Howard, Stanford itself,
and other institutions of higher
learning around the country will
be very surprised to hear that they
have afforded their Phi Beta
Kappa's, Magna Cuin Laude's, and
holders of Master's degrees a
substandard education. Most of
these schools feel that their
educational programs are
"second" to none, but this is
definitely not the idea conveyed
by the newsprint.
It is our understanding that the
Medical School has been
considering a tutorial program for
several years. Given the
"tremendous" number of
minority students now enrolled at
Stanford, it seems that the school
felt this to be a most propitious
time to institute such a program.
It is stated and true that all of
the black students admitted this
year required financial assistance,
but so did a very large percentage
of the white students. The
Stanford Medical School
Catalogue states, "It is anticipated
that these funds (financial aid for
Medical students) will be
sufficient to preclude any student
from discontinuing his education
because of financial need . .
Does this preclude drawing on
reserve funds for any students but
the minority students????
Regular Channels
Extensive praise was given the
school's pervasive efforts in
recruitment of minority students.
None of the black students
admitted received any
information about a Minority
Program at Stanford prior to
applying, nor was any mention
made of consideration of our
applications through any other
than "regular channels." We were
not given the impression of being
admitted as a mediocre appendage
of the regular, well-qualified white
student body until this article
appeared.
It should also be noted that no
mention was made of the fact that
the minority students are required
to meet the same requirements for
graduation as all other medical
students.
We, as Blacks, have been denied
admittance to white schools since
their inception in this country.
Now that token numbers of
extremely qualified blacks are
being accepted into a few medical

schools, we find that we must
earn our financial aid by being
used for publicity.
Cause of Publicity
Perhaps Stanford's Medical
School could better utilize some
of the money spent on extensively
advertising the existence of a few
blacks in the first-year class to
support those very blacks whose
presence is the cause of the
publicity. So much publicity has
been given to the fact that
minority students comprise more
than 10 percent of the freshman
class of 1969 at Stanford Medical
School.
Why, then, was there no report
in 1967 entitled, "Med School
Reports NO MINORITY
ENROLLMENT!"??

of the white students. The
Stanford Medical School
Catalogue states, "It is anticipated

Medical students) will be

from discontinuing his education
because of financial need . .
Does this preclude drawing on
reserve funds for any students but
the minority students????
Regular Channels
Extensive praise was given the
school's pervasive efforts in
recruitment of minority students.
None of the black students
admitted received any
information about a Minority
Program at Stanford prior to
applying, nor was any mention
made of consideration of our
applications through any other
than "regular channels." We were
not given the impression of being
admitted as a mediocre appendage
of the regular, well-qualified white
student body until this article
appeared.
It should also be noted that no
mention was made of the fact that
the minority students are required
to meet the same requirements for
graduation as all other medical
students.
We, as Blacks, have been denied
admittance to white schools since
their inception in this country.
Now that token numbers of
extremely qualified blacks are
being accepted into a few medical

schools, we find that we must
earn our financial aid by being
used for publicity.
Cause of Publicity
Perhaps Stanford's Medical
School could better utilize some
of the money spent on extensively
advertising the existence of a few
blacks in the first-year class to
support those very blacks whose
presence is the cause of the
publicity. So much publicity has
been given to the fact that
minority students comprise more
than 10 percent of the freshman
class of 1969 at Stanford Medical
School.
Why, then, was there no report
in 1967 entitled, "Med School
Reports NO MINORITY
ENROLLMENT!"??

(The following is a statement

medical school.)
An article printed recently in
the Daily (Stanford) concerning
the Minority Program of the
Medical School presents many
false facts and derogatory
implications about the black
students in the first year class.
It was reported that there were
tutorial programs available for the
minority students. A tutorial
program offered at the Medical
School is provided for the benefit
of the entire student body. We
black students do not feel that
our so-called "secondary"
educations warrant any special
tutorial programs for us. We are
sure that such schools as Bryn
Mawr, Howard, Stanford itself,
and other institutions of higher
learning around the country will
be very surprised to hear that they
have afforded their Phi Beta
Kappa's, Magna Cuin Laude's, and
holders of Master's degrees a
substandard education. Most of
these schools feel that their
educational programs are
"second" to none, but this is
definitely not the idea conveyed
by the newsprint.
It is our understanding that the
Medical School has been
considering a tutorial program for
several years. Given the
"tremendous" number of
minority students now enrolled at
Stanford, it seems that the school
felt this to be a most propitious
time to institute such a program.
It is stated and true that all of
