# ASSU & Schnieder
## Eratum 
### 
The authors of last Tuesday's article concerning the second ASSU
Senate meeting would like to apologize to the readers for having
attempted to infer Jim Schneider's intentions, and to Jim Schneider
whose character we inadvertantly impunged.
However the authors and the author of the column last Thursday
analyzing the Senate meeting remain steadfast in their contention that
a struggle ensued during the meeting for the possession of the 3x5
card. Sen. Schnieder contends however that the card was grabbed
from him, not that he grabbed at the card.
