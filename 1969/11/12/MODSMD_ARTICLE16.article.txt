# Woman's Liberation
## BOYCOTT G.E.! 
### CARRIE SAPIE Carrie Sapir 
Stanford Women's Liberation is
initiating an immediate boycott
on General Electric products and
appliances. The boycott will be
active support for the 150,000 GE
employees who have been out on
strike for the last 2 weeks and
expect to be out for the many
winter months ahead. We wish to
expose GE's illegal behavior
toward the public and its
employees, behavior such as
price-fixing, conspiracy to
maintain a monopoly, and unfair
bargaining practices. We plan,
through public opinion and loss of
sales, to pressure the management
into dealing fairly with their
employees. At present GE spends
more on propaganda a year than
they do on wages.
Why is Women's Liberation
concerned with labor struggles?
Why General Electric?
Corporations are the largest
economic and social force in
America today. The needs of
these large companies determine
the direction of social mores and
attitudes in our country. When
industry needed cheap labor
during the last war it became
suddenly socially acceptable for
women of all classes to go to
work. Because some women with
families couldn't work, and
woman-power was desparately
needed, child-care centers were set
up. Placing your child in such a
center became the thing to do.
The corporate structure brings
massive profits to a privileged
elite. (GE brought in $350 million
in profits last year). Women are
coming to realize that in such a
profit-motivated system people's
human needs cannot be
satisfactorily met.
As women we see our personal
hang ups, fears and insecurities as
directly related to the social
system we live in. We are taught in
the capitalist society from the day
we begin to school to be sugar and
spice and everything nice. We
learn home economics, grooming,
and how to build up our men's
egos that the work situation is
tearing apart everv day. Woman,

Social Pacifier, heals the wounds
and holds the society together.
Feudal Domination
Capitalism perpetuates an
almost feudal chain of domination
(owner -manager-worker;
doctor-nurse -patient;
principal-teacher-student). A
husband who gets shit all day
from the next guy up the ladder
can come home and feel that now
he is giving the orders. His
aggressions are absorbed by the
Social Pacifier, not directed
against his boss where they
belong.
Women are additionally useful
to Capitalism for economic
reasons. If we don't work, we are
held responsible for endless
h usehold chores and
child-rearing work. Under the
disguise of "social obligation" and
"family loyalty" we are assigned
to a life of hard labor and
headaches. We are told: "A
woman's work is never done."
Heavy expectations are laid upon
us tat make it impossible to feel
that we are giving out of joy and
love. Such a social situation makes
it impossible for a woman to
develop as a full, creative person,
yet it is in the interests of the

business world to keep women in
their place. For then the husband
can buckle under his defined
social obligation—to work all day
and overtime. And he will
probably take a lot of shit and
abuse on the job because who will
provide and protect his family if
he doesn't. If the woman works
she is used as a surplus labor
force, a temporary and cheap
labor force. She sees herself as
only a supplement to her
husbands superior earning power.
Both the role of husband and wife
inhibit people from getting
together to fight for better
conditions, and that's how the
corporate world wants it.
As women trapped in a world
dominated by capitalism, we are
taught to submit to our
environment, not change it. We
are taught to turn to men for
protection, guidance, and meaning
in our life. If we reject that
definition we must struggle
against the system that is
pounding it into us everyday in
every way, that is making us into
sex symbols to sell cars, beds,
booze and after-shave lotion, that
is turning us into compulsive
consumers and buying machines.

A beginning to that struggle is in
uniting with our sisters and
brothers of the working class who
are trying to attack corporate
institutions at their roots. And
General Electric is a particularly
appropriate target.

At GE we are fighting the 4th
largest corporation in the country
and the sth largest war
contractor—a company with over
a hundred foreign plants. GE has
recently been awarded the ABM
contract, worth $5 to $50 billion.
As women, we are opposed to
how corporations such as GE are
influencing American values and
day-to-day life. But we are also
opposed to GE as a major
contributor to the war in Vietnam
and the American economic and
military involvement all over the
Third World.
In initiating this boycott we
expect to unite women, workers,
people vs the war and all who
want peace and a better life for
our people. We believe that the
struggle against GE is a struggle
which we can all join, and that a
boycott is a beginning to that
fight. Buy candles this Christmas.

families couldn't work, and
woman-power was desparately
needed, child-care centers were set
up. Placing your child in such a
center became the thing to do.
The corporate structure brings
massive profits to a privileged
elite. (GE brought in $350 million
in profits last year). Women are
coming to realize that in such a
profit-motivated system people's
human needs cannot be
satisfactorily met.
As women we see our personal
hang ups, fears and insecurities as
directly related to the social
system we live in. We are taught in
the capitalist society from the day
we begin to school to be sugar and
spice and everything nice. We
learn home economics, grooming,
and how to build up our men's
egos that the work situation is
tearing apart everv day. Woman,

Social Pacifier, heals the wounds
and holds the society together.
Feudal Domination
Capitalism perpetuates an
almost feudal chain of domination
(owner -manager-worker;
doctor-nurse -patient;
principal-teacher-student). A
husband who gets shit all day
from the next guy up the ladder
can come home and feel that now
he is giving the orders. His
aggressions are absorbed by the
Social Pacifier, not directed
against his boss where they
belong.
Women are additionally useful
to Capitalism for economic
reasons. If we don't work, we are
held responsible for endless
h usehold chores and
child-rearing work. Under the
disguise of "social obligation" and
"family loyalty" we are assigned
to a life of hard labor and
headaches. We are told: "A
woman's work is never done."
Heavy expectations are laid upon
us tat make it impossible to feel
that we are giving out of joy and
love. Such a social situation makes
it impossible for a woman to
develop as a full, creative person,
yet it is in the interests of the

business world to keep women in
their place. For then the husband
can buckle under his defined
social obligation—to work all day
and overtime. And he will
probably take a lot of shit and
abuse on the job because who will
provide and protect his family if
he doesn't. If the woman works
she is used as a surplus labor
force, a temporary and cheap
labor force. She sees herself as
only a supplement to her
husbands superior earning power.
Both the role of husband and wife
inhibit people from getting
together to fight for better
conditions, and that's how the
corporate world wants it.
As women trapped in a world
dominated by capitalism, we are
taught to submit to our
environment, not change it. We
are taught to turn to men for
protection, guidance, and meaning
in our life. If we reject that
definition we must struggle
against the system that is
pounding it into us everyday in
every way, that is making us into
sex symbols to sell cars, beds,
booze and after-shave lotion, that
is turning us into compulsive
consumers and buying machines.

A beginning to that struggle is in
uniting with our sisters and
brothers of the working class who
are trying to attack corporate
institutions at their roots. And
General Electric is a particularly
appropriate target.

price-fixing, conspiracy to

can come home and feel that now
he is giving the orders. His
aggressions are absorbed by the
Social Pacifier, not directed
against his boss where they
belong.
Women are additionally useful
to Capitalism for economic
reasons. If we don't work, we are
held responsible for endless
h usehold chores and
child-rearing work. Under the
disguise of "social obligation" and
"family loyalty" we are assigned
to a life of hard labor and
headaches. We are told: "A
woman's work is never done."
Heavy expectations are laid upon
us tat make it impossible to feel
that we are giving out of joy and
love. Such a social situation makes
it impossible for a woman to
develop as a full, creative person,
yet it is in the interests of the

business world to keep women in
their place. For then the husband
can buckle under his defined
social obligation—to work all day
and overtime. And he will
probably take a lot of shit and
abuse on the job because who will
provide and protect his family if
he doesn't. If the woman works
she is used as a surplus labor
force, a temporary and cheap
labor force. She sees herself as
only a supplement to her
husbands superior earning power.
Both the role of husband and wife
inhibit people from getting
together to fight for better
conditions, and that's how the
corporate world wants it.
As women trapped in a world
dominated by capitalism, we are
taught to submit to our
environment, not change it. We
are taught to turn to men for
protection, guidance, and meaning
in our life. If we reject that
definition we must struggle
against the system that is
pounding it into us everyday in
every way, that is making us into
sex symbols to sell cars, beds,
booze and after-shave lotion, that
is turning us into compulsive
consumers and buying machines.

A beginning to that struggle is in
uniting with our sisters and
brothers of the working class who
are trying to attack corporate
institutions at their roots. And
General Electric is a particularly
appropriate target.

At GE we are fighting the 4th
largest corporation in the country
and the sth largest war
contractor—a company with over
a hundred foreign plants. GE has
recently been awarded the ABM
contract, worth $5 to $50 billion.
As women, we are opposed to
how corporations such as GE are
influencing American values and
day-to-day life. But we are also
opposed to GE as a major
contributor to the war in Vietnam
and the American economic and
military involvement all over the
Third World.
In initiating this boycott we
expect to unite women, workers,
people vs the war and all who
want peace and a better life for
our people. We believe that the
struggle against GE is a struggle
which we can all join, and that a
boycott is a beginning to that
fight. Buy candles this Christmas.
Stanford Women's Liberation is
initiating an immediate boycott
on General Electric products and
appliances. The boycott will be
active support for the 150,000 GE
employees who have been out on
strike for the last 2 weeks and
expect to be out for the many
winter months ahead. We wish to
expose GE's illegal behavior
toward the public and its
employees, behavior such as
price-fixing, conspiracy to
maintain a monopoly, and unfair
bargaining practices. We plan,
through public opinion and loss of
sales, to pressure the management
into dealing fairly with their
employees. At present GE spends
more on propaganda a year than
they do on wages.
Why is Women's Liberation
concerned with labor struggles?
Why General Electric?
Corporations are the largest
economic and social force in
America today. The needs of
these large companies determine
the direction of social mores and
attitudes in our country. When
industry needed cheap labor
during the last war it became
suddenly socially acceptable for
women of all classes to go to
work. Because some women with
families couldn't work, and
woman-power was desparately
needed, child-care centers were set
up. Placing your child in such a
center became the thing to do.
The corporate structure brings
massive profits to a privileged
elite. (GE brought in $350 million
in profits last year). Women are
coming to realize that in such a
profit-motivated system people's
human needs cannot be
satisfactorily met.
As women we see our personal
hang ups, fears and insecurities as
directly related to the social
system we live in. We are taught in
the capitalist society from the day
we begin to school to be sugar and
spice and everything nice. We
learn home economics, grooming,
and how to build up our men's
egos that the work situation is
tearing apart everv day. Woman,

Social Pacifier, heals the wounds
and holds the society together.
Feudal Domination
Capitalism perpetuates an
almost feudal chain of domination
(owner -manager-worker;
doctor-nurse -patient;
principal-teacher-student). A
husband who gets shit all day
from the next guy up the ladder
can come home and feel that now
he is giving the orders. His
aggressions are absorbed by the
Social Pacifier, not directed
against his boss where they
belong.
