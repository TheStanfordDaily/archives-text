# Bombs it' Other Things
## From An Underground Lab 
### Marcello Malvento 
During the past several years I
have had the undiluted pleasure of
working amongst the best of your
scientists in a secret underground
laboratory of a Great Western
University. It bereaves me, then,
to see myself and my compatriots
continually scathed by the caustic
vituperations of the so-called
radical element of your society. I
feel morally compelled to
respond.

I am convinced that you, both
radicals and their dupes, cling to
those aberrations that you do
because you do not know what it
means to be a scientist, or even a
human being for that matter. You
do not have the slightest
appreciation for the rudiments of
the theory of human nature
(which, incidentally, I plan to
teach next quarter with funds

provided bv Air Force Contract
AFJ37-125).
To begin with, our work here is
interesting, challenging, and, I
dare say, orgastic. This, to borrow
from your great President Nixon,
is not a threat, but just a
statement of policy. How I wish I
could convey to you the
rapturous joys of my work—but
no one with anything less than a
Q-clearance will ever taste my
sapid brew. Besides, can a savage
thrill to Beethoven?
A brief example from my
notebook may give you some
indication,' however slight, of the
electric excitement that twitches
my very soul. Accordingly, from
yesterday's entry we find the
following question, fraught with
more subtle beauty than most
humans have the power to
discern: If it takes 3 bombs to
destroy 6000 sheep in 4 seconds,
how long does it take to destroy
500 million people-units?
Aha! This is a true intellectual
challenge, for one must be sure to
first divide the sheep by the
bombs multiplied by the seconds,
and then expand in a Fibinocci
series discarding all higher-order
terms, finally using the scattering
matrix in the annihilation
operator representation to effect
the transformation between sheep
and people-units. The more
sophisticated among you will
recognize this to be a variant of
the classic Bordello problem—viz.,
if it takes 3 girls 2 hours, etc.
In any case, you will certainly
agree that as sapient, sentient
beings we must seek out truths
such as these, and forever follow
the thread of our Glorious
Western Culture to wherever it
takes us. To do less than this
would be stark and primitive
bestiality. I, for one, sleep better
at night knowing that we in our
lab are investigating these intricate
problems and working toward the
final solution. Don't you?

I am convinced that you, both
radicals and their dupes, cling to
those aberrations that you do
because you do not know what it
means to be a scientist, or even a
human being for that matter. You
do not have the slightest
appreciation for the rudiments of
the theory of human nature
(which, incidentally, I plan to
teach next quarter with funds

provided bv Air Force Contract
AFJ37-125).
To begin with, our work here is
interesting, challenging, and, I
dare say, orgastic. This, to borrow
from your great President Nixon,
is not a threat, but just a
statement of policy. How I wish I
could convey to you the
rapturous joys of my work—but
no one with anything less than a
Q-clearance will ever taste my
sapid brew. Besides, can a savage
thrill to Beethoven?
A brief example from my
notebook may give you some
indication,' however slight, of the
electric excitement that twitches
my very soul. Accordingly, from
yesterday's entry we find the
following question, fraught with
more subtle beauty than most
humans have the power to
discern: If it takes 3 bombs to
destroy 6000 sheep in 4 seconds,
how long does it take to destroy
500 million people-units?
Aha! This is a true intellectual
challenge, for one must be sure to
first divide the sheep by the
bombs multiplied by the seconds,
and then expand in a Fibinocci
series discarding all higher-order
terms, finally using the scattering
matrix in the annihilation
operator representation to effect
the transformation between sheep
and people-units. The more
sophisticated among you will
recognize this to be a variant of
the classic Bordello problem—viz.,
if it takes 3 girls 2 hours, etc.
In any case, you will certainly
agree that as sapient, sentient
beings we must seek out truths
such as these, and forever follow
the thread of our Glorious
Western Culture to wherever it
takes us. To do less than this
would be stark and primitive
bestiality. I, for one, sleep better
at night knowing that we in our
lab are investigating these intricate
problems and working toward the
final solution. Don't you?
During the past several years I
have had the undiluted pleasure of
working amongst the best of your
scientists in a secret underground
laboratory of a Great Western
University. It bereaves me, then,
to see myself and my compatriots
continually scathed by the caustic
vituperations of the so-called
radical element of your society. I
feel morally compelled to
respond.
