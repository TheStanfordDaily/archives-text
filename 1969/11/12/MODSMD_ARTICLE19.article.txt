# Hazards To Man
## 'Generally Accepted As Safe' 
### Joshua Lederberg 
Secretary Robert N. Finch's
order banning the use of
cyclamate as an artificial
sweetener is a decisive
administrative closure to a messy
controversy of great potential
importance to public health. My
only criticism is that it was not
done sooner, but this was difficult
in the face of ambiguities both in
the legal authority of the FDA
and in the scientific evidence that
cyclamate is a hazard in man.
If we are lucky, we may never
know the answer to this question,
for it is more likely that new
compounds will be discovered as
alternatives to cyclamate than
that cyclamate could be
exonerated by further studies
(even if it is essentially innocent)
once it had been indicted. If we
are unlucky, we may eventually
link the past use of cyclamate to
bladder cancer or to genetic
damage by statistical studies of
human disease. We have no
specific evidence of this kind now,
but it will hardly do to abandon
research on cyclamate effects
despite its removal from the
market and current consumption.
Secretary Finch's decision does
not answer the scientific
questions, although the regulatory
label of "safe" or "unsafe" is
often confused with a factual
reality that can never be so
categorical. Nor does the
cyclamate affair set a satisfying
precedent for the way such issues
should be dealt with in the future.
Our principal need is, of course,
for the improvement of methods

of scientific evaluation of safety.
In principle one could dispute the
rationale of banning an additive
merely for causing tumors in an
experimental animal at high doses,
when we know nothing of the
way the additive works. In this
case, however, Dr. Marvin Legator
of FDA's research laboratories,
had already shown over a year ago
that a derivative formed in the
body from cyclamate,
c y c 1 oh e xy la mi ne, caused
chromosome breaks in rat germ
cells when given in modest doses
for short periods of time. This
information was administratively
ignored, perhaps because the
language of the law is still
innocent of any knowledge of
genetic damage.
Short Term Studies
We have, furthermore, no other
way of alerting ourselves to some
very dangerous perils. An additive
that caused cancers in only one
per thousand exposed people, and
only after twenty years of
everyday use, would bear the
burden of an untold amount of
human suffering, measured in
hundreds of thousands of
premature deaths. Yet we have no
other general way to discover such
hazards except by shorter term
studies on animals at elevated
doses.
In fact, among the thousands of
compounds "generally accepted as
safe" or specifically licensed as
food additives by the FDA, there
are surely dozens which will prove
to be at least as hazardous as
cyclamate, bu have yet to reach

the same kind of public attention.
Organic peroxides are proven
mutagensâ€”but are widely used for
bleaching starch and maturing
flour. Mustard oil is historically
important as the first proven
chemical mutagen. It has, however
come to legislative attention for
an entirely different reason,
namely its use as a cruel blistering
agent for "soring" horses.
Phenethyl alcohol is a synthetic
perfume essence; but biochemists
know it as a powerful inhibitor of
DNA synthesis. Many other
additives are suspect simply on
the grounds of their chemical
reactivity, for they must then
produce a wide and unpredictable
variety of secondary products
when used in foods. Many other
compounds belong to classes that
we do not yet recognize as having
biological potency.
II the FDA indeed had to give
adequate scientific assurance
about the absolute safety of every
additive, we might starve to death
while the necessary research was
being done, and then again when
new insights into sources of peril
emerged. Nevertheless, the food
industry and the scientific
community, as well as government
should be sharpening their focus
in dealing with these vital
problems. I am confident that
many fellow scientists will
discover their own special
nightmares, on the basis of their
personal expertise, when they
review the long lists of approved
additives.

Meanwhile, we must also think
of more flexible legal and
regulatory approaches to these
problems. Abbott Laboratories
should not be charged with
insincerity for having asserted its
confidence that cyclamates were
safe, but the main risk was being
borne by millions of consumers,
not the corporation. On the other
hand, a government agency might
be in the position of having little
to lose in responding to public
arousal, by banning a product
before all the evidence was in.
The law could, however, be
altered to provide for
unconditional liability for the
eventual hazard of a product
when the FDA has certified a bill
of particulars, for example about
bladder cancer or mutation. An
Abbott Laboratories would then
have to back up its confidence, by.
sharing the risk that it was
mistaken with its customers. It
might also be required to post an
insurance bond. This device would
help to bring in the informed!
businessman's judgment of a third
party, namely the insurance]
underwriter who must make wise
decisions about the premium to
charge.
In the long run, the cost of
insurance is embedded in what the
consumer has to pay. But this will
indirectly pay for important
research on hazards and for the
development of safer alternatives,
as well as encourage broader
discretion by the purveyors of
unproven products.
