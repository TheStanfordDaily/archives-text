# Campus Plans Moratorium
## Faculty, Business Mobilized 
### JOHN BOWEN 
Statements of collective
support for the Moratorium were
released yesterday by the
Stanford Medical School and by a
group of University professors and
staff members. The backing comes
on the eve of a three-day
observance of "No Business as
Usual" on the Stanford campus.
In addition, the Peninsula
Moratorium Committee has been
seeking support from area
businessmen for a statement of
policy regarding "Working
Americans and Responsible
Dissent."
Fifty-five professors and
thirty-five staff members pledged
their support to "the goals of the
Moratorium, November 13-14.
"Each of us, in his own way,
will express his support on those
days. Some of us will cancel or
reschedule classes; all of us, in
some fashion, will refrain from
'business as usual' in order to
work actively against the war."
Professors
Included in the list of faculty
are Thomas J. Connolly, Director
of Nuclear Engineering; Professors
David Gilbarg, Samuel Karlin, and
Donald Ornstein of the
mathematics department; and the
Assistant Dean of the School of
Education, Robert N. Funk.
Seven members of the political
science department also signed the
pledge, including Professors
Charles Drekmeier, Hubert
Marshall, Robert A. Packenham,
Kurt Steiner, and Jan Triska.
The Medical School poll
showed that 122 of the 150
students support the Moratorium,
but only 64 will refrain from
attending classes on Thursday and
Friday.
Employer Policies
In a mailing sent to over 2000
organizations in Santa Clara
County, the Peninsula
Moratorium Committee has asked
employers to "ensure reasonable
dissent (by employees) will not be
stifled in any manner."
In response to the mailings,
which were sent out yesterday
morning, a number of area
organization leaders have
responsed with statements of
support. Robert Finnigan,

President, Finnigan Instrument
Company; E.J. Nicholson,
President, Data Business
Machines; Carl Djerassi,
President, Syntex Research, and
John Rutherford, President of
Rutherford and Chekene have
already indicated personal
agreement with the policy
statement.
In addition, all except Djerassi
committed their organization to
the statement.
Arthur Bushkin, Lockheed
researcher who organized the
circulation of the statement, was
asked about the policy of his own
company. He replied that his own
management had assured him that
employees desiring time off to

participate in political activities of
their own may do so by taking
either a portion of their vacation
or unpaid leave of absence,
provided they have the prior
approval of their supervisor.
Moratorium Plans
Tomorrow's Moratorium
activities include canvassing and
leafletting of businesses in the
Industrial Park, and picketing of
the South Vietnamese Consulate
in San Francisco. White Plaza will
be the site of the Faculty-Staff
Witness, to be held at noon.
More than 200 faculty and staff
have already signed the call for
peace which will be read at the
Witness, and many others are
expected to join. Each will

introduce himself by name and
department, and ten will make
short speeches; some will by "very
dramatic", according to Professor
Sanford Dornbusch, organizer of
the program.
Friday will "witness" a
continuation of the canvassing
and leafletting, and the beginning
of the National Student Strike. A
march through the Industrial Park
will begin at the corner of Page
Mill and Hanover at noon, and
pass "eighty-five percent of the
plants," according to Moratorium
organizer Doug Mattern.
Moratorium activities will
culminate in a rally at the Polo
Grounds at 2 p.m., following an
all-day march Saturday in San
Francisco.
