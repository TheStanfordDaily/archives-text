# ...I Am Aztec Prince

### 
La Raza! Mejicano! Espanol' Latino! Ilispano! Chicano!
or whatever I call myselj,
/ look the same
I feel the same
I cry
and
Sing the same

I am the masses of my people and
I refuse to be absorbed.
I am Joaquin
The odds are great
but my spirit is strong
My faith is unbreakable
My blood is pure
I am Aztec Prince and Christian Christ
I SHALL ENDURE!
