## Pill Problems: Moral, Medical The
						Pill 
### 
(Editor's Note: This article is
the second in a two-part series. In
Yesterday's DAILY, the first part
explained the University's current
policy which does not allow
doctors at the Cowell Student
Health Center to prescribe
contraceptives. Many staff
physicians instead refer students
to off-campus doctors or the Palo
Alto Planned Parenthood office.
There is now a plan awaiting
President Pitzer's approval that
would eliminate all restrictions on
Cowell doctors in helping
Stanford women to get the pill.
The new proposal would make
contraceptives available at the
health center as well.)

Dr. James McClenahan, Director
of Cowell Health Center, feels
that the doctor's treatment of an
unmarried woman who seeks birth
control pills must go beyond the
physical examination. Personal
counseling is vital. "If a patient
says 'I want a bottle of sleeping
pills,' the doctor is obligated to
find out why, and so it is with
birth control pills," said
McClenahan. He feels the doctor
must be sure that the girl isn't
seeking contraceptives simply out
of social pressure.
Dr. Alan Leveton, a psychiatrist
at the Family Therapy Center in
San Francisco, strongly agrees.
"When a patient asks for birth
control pills, the doctor must find
out how she came to that
decision. Before he prescribes thy
pill, he has a responsibility to
determine whether she has
thought over the consequences."
There seems to be strong
professional support for the
university to change its policy.
The opinion of many doctors is
that the avoidance of unwanted
pregnancy is a matter of health
and not of morality. These
doctors see prescription of the pill
as appropriate and necessary for
both the married and the
unmarried, old and young.
Physician's Duty to Help
Dr. Avram Goldstein, director
of pharmacology in the Medical
School, adds, "The physician's
duty is to help people, not to
judge them."
He continued, "If an unmarried
girl has established a sexual
relationship and seeks
contraceptive information and
protection against pregnancy, she
is not asking for advice about
morality, she is asking for medical

help. As physicians, we must
respond with the best medical
help that the state of the art
permits."
Gloria David, director of the
Palo Alto Planned Parenthood
Center, believes in prescription of
the pill to all who want it. "We
must put an end to obligatory
parenthood," she feels.
"Consistent with the mental and
physical health of the patient, a
doctor cannot refuse to treat a girl
who asks for brith control pills."
Pregnancy Prevention Important
Few doctors seem to take
exception with the belief that the

prevention of pregnancy is an
important health concern. The
central question in many minds,
the question Pitzer will have to
answer, is whether it is the
University's responsibility to treat
unmarried women.
Miss Davis unequivocally thinks
so. Stanford is copping out on its
responsibility, she feels. Last week
she said the Palo Alto Family
Planning Center (which has been
prescribing contraceptives to
unmarried Stanford students since
its opening in February) is
considering discontinuing its
service to Stanford students. Half
the girls the center has treated are
from Stanford, and Miss Davis
thinks this is inhibiting the Center
from serving the poorer teenagers
in the area who now have
nowhere to turn.
Dr. Leveton sees the
University's refusal to prescribe
the pill to unmarried women as a
punitive attitude. "Parents and
institutions often take a punitive
attitude toward the girl, saying in
effect, '0.K., if you get pregnant,
tough luck, I hope you learn.'
This attitude is really sad and
dumb. Once a university like
Stanford recognizes that decisions
about individual sexual behavior
are not within its authority, it
must offer its female students the
ability to prevent pregnancy."

Dr. Richard U'Ren, a resident
psychiatrist at the Medical Center,
is a member of what he admits is
"a minority" in the medical
profession who disagree. While he
is not against birth control pills,
he feels that it is not the
University's place to prescribe
them to unmarried women.
"What the Health Center
should be dispensing to unmarried
students is advice," he said last
week. "If students want to go
beyond that, it should be their
responsibility, not the
University's."
Should the University prescribe

birth control pills to unmarried
women, it would be a tacit
endorsement of the pill, in the
opinion of Dr. U'Ren. This
endorsement, he fears, could set
up a single standard of sexual
behavior on campus. He is
concerned, he said, about girls
who are confused and unsure and
might be pressured by their peers
to use the pill simply because it is
so available.
Pill Sale or Not?
Dr. U'Ren also expressed
concern about the University
sanctioning a medicine which
might be unsafe. Over 50
metabolic changes in the human
body, he noted, have been traced
to the birth control pill. Some of
these can possibly cause
irreversible structural damage,
such as arteriosclerosis. He also
pointed out the higher incidence
of clotting disorders among
women on the pill.
(British researchers maintain
that women on the pill undergo a
risk of blood clotting nine times
normal incidence according to Dr.
Luis Lasagne of Columbia
University.)
"We are not being punitive by
not prescribing the pill to
unmarried women," U'Ren
commented. "In another 15 years,
when we know more about its

dangers, we might find out that
we were panitive to prescribe the
pill, inadvertently and with the
best of intentions."
Dr. U'Ren feels that unmarried
women who are mature and stable
will have no problem obtaining
the pill off campus. He is not
opposed to this. ' But," he claims,
"the trend now is toward
prescribing the pill to anyone. I'm
injecting a note of caution in this
trend."
Tijuana or the Pill
Still, many officials reject that
note of caution. Miss Davis, when
questioned of the dangers of the
pill, responded resolutely, "For an
unwed single girl, there is no
comparison between the dangers
of the pill and the dangers of
seeking an abortion in Tijuana."
She added that possibly as many
as 100,000 illegal abortions are
performed in California every
year.
For Pitzer, there is no easy way
out. Whatever decision he makes
on the policy now before him will
be controversial. But some feel
that the saving grace of the new
policy might be its flexibility.
Under the policy, doctors at
Cowell would not be committed
to prescribe the pill to any
unmarried student who wants it,
but neither would they be
prevented from doing so.
Individual discretion is the key, in
the opinion of many doctors.
Wide Range of Student Needs
In the 1966 panel. Dr. Beatrix
Hamburg, a research psychiatrist
at the Medical School, emphasized
the importance of considering a
wide range of student needs. She
commented, "There are immature
students who need a policy which
protects them against a
bandwagon effect, where they are
pressured to engage in sexual
activities that they are not yet
emotionally prepared for."

"At the same time we have
students who are at a stage where
they need elbow room to
experiment, and we have other
students who are extremely
mature and are engaged in a
monogamous, though not legally
sanctioned, relationship."
A policy of freedom of
judgment on the part of each
individual physician would seem
to meet thyneeds of these various
students, in the opinion of Dr.
McClenahan and others. While
such a policy does not eliminate
the reservations of Dr. U'Ren, it
does, he said, "take the sting out
of them."
Even so, should Pitzer approve
the policy, there will be cries of
protest from those who believe
that the University is sanctioning
a new morality. And should the
president veto the proposed
policy, there will be cries of
protest of equal vehemence from
those who believe he is enforcing
an anachronistic morality.
