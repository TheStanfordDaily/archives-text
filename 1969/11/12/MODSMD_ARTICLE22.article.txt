## Scientist Urges Arms Ban 
### 
On °ve of U.S.-Soviet
strategi- limitation (SALT)
talks in rielsinki, a Stanford
expert has advised that a small
step in arms limitation may be
"harder to negotiate and be in
fact more dangerous" to the
security of both nations than a
large step would be.
Prof. Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky,
former nuclear test ban treaty
negotiator and director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, presented a detailed
picture of the tangle of complex
factors involved in the arms race
in a lecture in Chicago Monday.
"Depending on how MIRV's
and ABM's are deployed, and
depending on their physical
characteristics, they can be viewed
either as protecting the domestic
deterrent forces or as threatening
the deterrent forces of the other
side. Because of the multiple
strategic roles of these systems,
impeding development of just one
of them may be dangerous to
either side," Prof. Panofsky said.
"The more restrictive the SALT
treaty can be on the further
evolution of MIRV's and ABM,
the more substantial will be the
success of the treaty in achieving
stability.
ABM Officially A Deterrent
He explained how America's
ABM system has been officially
described as a deterrent to a
Soviet "first strike" (for which
technically, however, it is very
badly suited) for protecting
Minuteman silos from which we
could strike back. On the other
hand, the Soviets could view our
ABM's in a "damage-limiting"
role—that is, as a means to limit
damage to our cities if we struck
first.
The MIRV, which carries a
number of warhead missiles that
could splay out and attack several
enemy objectives, also has a dual
function, he said. "On the one
hand they can be used as a
'penetration aid' against the
enemy's defenses; the enemy's

ABM can be penetrated if he has
too many incoming warheads to
shoot at.
"On the other hand, if MIRV
did have high accuracy it would
become a threat against the other
side's emplaced missiles in a single
strike to keep most of them from
striking back. It is for this reason
that widespread deployment of
MIRV, combined with high
accuracy, raises a spectre (to
Russians) of a first strike.
Cheating Less Dangerous
"Yet it is true in general that
under the more restrictive arms
limitation agreements, cheating
will be much less dangerous
toward upsetting the strategic
balance than if the arms race
continued with only small
restraints. If one carries
conservatism in military
matters . . .to the extreme, any
basis for a negotiable position is,
of course, destroyed."
"The more far-reaching the
prohibition of the SALT treaty,
the less important the question of
cheating becomes," he asserted.
"A second, equally important
conclusion is: A 'freeze' of the
'status quo' at present levels of
stratetic armaments is easier to
police than a treaty specifying
agreed numbers of components
(missiles, radars, etc.) of
permitted strategic systems. It is
easier to recognize changes than
to interpret in detail what is
discovered.
Soviets Ahead in Megatonnage
"A freeze would tend to
perpetuate for the time being
many of the asymmetries between
the U.S. and the Soviet Union,"
the Stanford physicist said. "The
Soviets are 'ahead' of the U.S. in
terms of total megatonnage of
nuclear arms; we are ahead of
them in number of bombers and
missiles.
"The spectre of sudden
emergence of hitherto secret
Soviet ABM or MIRV systems
developed clandestinely under a

treaty has given rise to another
debate which is possibly of even
more far-reaching significance
than the debate about the SALT
treaty itself," Prof. Panofsky
continued. "This is the
controversy about the controls on
the growth of technology.
"What we tend to ignore are
the long-range social as well as
financial costs of many of our
decisions in terms of disturbing
the environment through
pollution, through ecological
damage, etc.
"To put it in blunt terms—the
military technicians maintain that
evolution of military technology
is inexorable and that we must
adjust our lives and political and
strategic decisions to live with
that evolution. I claim that such
an assumption is both dangerous
to man's very existence and is also
insupportable on its own merit.
Our knowledge of science will
indeed increase continuously,"
Prof. Panofsky said. "The facts of
nature are there to be explored
and they will not remain hidden,
nor should they remain hidden."

the environment through
pollution, through ecological
damage, etc.
"To put it in blunt terms—the
military technicians maintain that
evolution of military technology
is inexorable and that we must
adjust our lives and political and
strategic decisions to live with
that evolution. I claim that such
an assumption is both dangerous
to man's very existence and is also
insupportable on its own merit.
Our knowledge of science will
indeed increase continuously,"
Prof. Panofsky said. "The facts of
nature are there to be explored
and they will not remain hidden,
nor should they remain hidden."
On °ve of U.S.-Soviet
strategi- limitation (SALT)
talks in rielsinki, a Stanford
expert has advised that a small
step in arms limitation may be
"harder to negotiate and be in
fact more dangerous" to the
security of both nations than a
large step would be.
Prof. Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky,
former nuclear test ban treaty
negotiator and director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, presented a detailed
picture of the tangle of complex
factors involved in the arms race
in a lecture in Chicago Monday.
"Depending on how MIRV's
and ABM's are deployed, and
depending on their physical
characteristics, they can be viewed
either as protecting the domestic
deterrent forces or as threatening
the deterrent forces of the other
side. Because of the multiple
strategic roles of these systems,
impeding development of just one
of them may be dangerous to
either side," Prof. Panofsky said.
"The more restrictive the SALT
treaty can be on the further
evolution of MIRV's and ABM,
the more substantial will be the
success of the treaty in achieving
stability.
ABM Officially A Deterrent
He explained how America's
ABM system has been officially
described as a deterrent to a
Soviet "first strike" (for which
technically, however, it is very
badly suited) for protecting
Minuteman silos from which we
could strike back. On the other
hand, the Soviets could view our
ABM's in a "damage-limiting"
role—that is, as a means to limit
damage to our cities if we struck
first.
The MIRV, which carries a
number of warhead missiles that
could splay out and attack several
enemy objectives, also has a dual
function, he said. "On the one
hand they can be used as a
'penetration aid' against the
enemy's defenses; the enemy's

ABM can be penetrated if he has
too many incoming warheads to
shoot at.
"On the other hand, if MIRV
did have high accuracy it would
become a threat against the other
side's emplaced missiles in a single
strike to keep most of them from
striking back. It is for this reason
that widespread deployment of
MIRV, combined with high
accuracy, raises a spectre (to
Russians) of a first strike.
Cheating Less Dangerous
"Yet it is true in general that
under the more restrictive arms
limitation agreements, cheating
will be much less dangerous
toward upsetting the strategic
balance than if the arms race
continued with only small
restraints. If one carries
conservatism in military
matters . . .to the extreme, any
basis for a negotiable position is,
of course, destroyed."
"The more far-reaching the
prohibition of the SALT treaty,
the less important the question of
cheating becomes," he asserted.
"A second, equally important
conclusion is: A 'freeze' of the
'status quo' at present levels of
stratetic armaments is easier to
police than a treaty specifying
agreed numbers of components
(missiles, radars, etc.) of
permitted strategic systems. It is
easier to recognize changes than
to interpret in detail what is
discovered.
Soviets Ahead in Megatonnage
"A freeze would tend to
perpetuate for the time being
many of the asymmetries between
the U.S. and the Soviet Union,"
the Stanford physicist said. "The
Soviets are 'ahead' of the U.S. in
terms of total megatonnage of
nuclear arms; we are ahead of
them in number of bombers and
missiles.
"The spectre of sudden
emergence of hitherto secret
Soviet ABM or MIRV systems
developed clandestinely under a

treaty has given rise to another
debate which is possibly of even
more far-reaching significance
than the debate about the SALT
treaty itself," Prof. Panofsky
continued. "This is the
controversy about the controls on
the growth of technology.
"What we tend to ignore are
the long-range social as well as
financial costs of many of our
decisions in terms of disturbing
the environment through
pollution, through ecological
damage, etc.

nuclear arms; we are ahead of
them in number of bombers and
missiles.
"The spectre of sudden
emergence of hitherto secret
Soviet ABM or MIRV systems
developed clandestinely under a

treaty has given rise to another
debate which is possibly of even
more far-reaching significance
than the debate about the SALT
treaty itself," Prof. Panofsky
continued. "This is the
controversy about the controls on
the growth of technology.
"What we tend to ignore are
the long-range social as well as
financial costs of many of our
decisions in terms of disturbing
the environment through
pollution, through ecological
damage, etc.
"To put it in blunt terms—the
military technicians maintain that
evolution of military technology
is inexorable and that we must
adjust our lives and political and
strategic decisions to live with
that evolution. I claim that such
an assumption is both dangerous
to man's very existence and is also
insupportable on its own merit.
Our knowledge of science will
indeed increase continuously,"
Prof. Panofsky said. "The facts of
nature are there to be explored
and they will not remain hidden,
nor should they remain hidden."
On °ve of U.S.-Soviet
strategi- limitation (SALT)
talks in rielsinki, a Stanford
expert has advised that a small
step in arms limitation may be
"harder to negotiate and be in
fact more dangerous" to the
security of both nations than a
large step would be.
Prof. Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky,
former nuclear test ban treaty
negotiator and director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, presented a detailed
picture of the tangle of complex
factors involved in the arms race
in a lecture in Chicago Monday.
"Depending on how MIRV's
and ABM's are deployed, and
depending on their physical
characteristics, they can be viewed
either as protecting the domestic
deterrent forces or as threatening
the deterrent forces of the other
side. Because of the multiple
strategic roles of these systems,
impeding development of just one
of them may be dangerous to
either side," Prof. Panofsky said.
"The more restrictive the SALT
treaty can be on the further
evolution of MIRV's and ABM,
the more substantial will be the
success of the treaty in achieving
stability.
ABM Officially A Deterrent
He explained how America's
ABM system has been officially
described as a deterrent to a
Soviet "first strike" (for which
technically, however, it is very
badly suited) for protecting
Minuteman silos from which we
could strike back. On the other
hand, the Soviets could view our
ABM's in a "damage-limiting"
role—that is, as a means to limit
damage to our cities if we struck
first.
The MIRV, which carries a
number of warhead missiles that
could splay out and attack several
enemy objectives, also has a dual
function, he said. "On the one
hand they can be used as a
'penetration aid' against the
enemy's defenses; the enemy's

ABM can be penetrated if he has
too many incoming warheads to
shoot at.
"On the other hand, if MIRV
did have high accuracy it would
become a threat against the other
side's emplaced missiles in a single
strike to keep most of them from
striking back. It is for this reason
that widespread deployment of
MIRV, combined with high
accuracy, raises a spectre (to
Russians) of a first strike.
Cheating Less Dangerous
"Yet it is true in general that
under the more restrictive arms
limitation agreements, cheating
will be much less dangerous
toward upsetting the strategic
balance than if the arms race
continued with only small
restraints. If one carries
conservatism in military
matters . . .to the extreme, any
basis for a negotiable position is,
of course, destroyed."
"The more far-reaching the
prohibition of the SALT treaty,
the less important the question of
cheating becomes," he asserted.
"A second, equally important
conclusion is: A 'freeze' of the
'status quo' at present levels of
stratetic armaments is easier to
police than a treaty specifying
agreed numbers of components
(missiles, radars, etc.) of
permitted strategic systems. It is
easier to recognize changes than
to interpret in detail what is
discovered.
Soviets Ahead in Megatonnage
"A freeze would tend to
perpetuate for the time being
many of the asymmetries between
the U.S. and the Soviet Union,"
the Stanford physicist said. "The
Soviets are 'ahead' of the U.S. in
terms of total megatonnage of
nuclear arms; we are ahead of
them in number of bombers and
missiles.
"The spectre of sudden
emergence of hitherto secret
Soviet ABM or MIRV systems
