# Two Viet Veterans Tell Of Attrocities
## 
### 
The United States has dropped
large numbers of specially fused
bombs in Vietnam that will not
explode for three, five, seven, or
even ten years.
This was one of the many
unknown facts about the war
revealed Monday night by two
Viet veterans at a gathering of
students in the Cedro Lounge.
Lee Thorn, a former naval
intelligence officer who served in
Vietnam from December, 1965 to
August, 1966, explained the
ten-year-fuse bombs. "The
assumption for the use of these
bombs was that the war was going
to go on forever—which was a
pretty good assumption."
Two of the most widely used
bombs, Thorn noted, are the
huge, 2,000 pound napalm bombs
which are used for defoliating the
thick, green jungles of Vietnam,
and the anti-personnel
fragmentation bomb, which sends
pieces of shrapnel flying in all
directions when it explodes. The
shrapnel, Thorn said, cannot
pierce armor, but does penetrate
human flesh.
Bomber Squadron .Losses
Among other things, Thorn
worked as a debriefing officer in
Vietnam for naval bomber
squadrons. One bomber squadron
he worked with lost all their
planes twice, as well as half their
men in only nine months.

Former Army Sergeant Mickey
Finn also expressed what he saw
as the futility of the war.
"The war is useless and
tactically unsound," Finn noted.
"There are no front lines and rear
lines; except for Cam Ranh Bay,
no single area in South Vietnam is
secure. A hill may cost an officer
70 percent of his men to take, and
then it is abandoned the next
day."
Civil War, Not Invasion
Finn said that most of the
people see the conflict as a civil
war rather than as an invasion
from the North. "There are two
factions in Vietnam," Finn
explained, "pro-Western and
anti-Western. The invasion is being
carried on by the Americans."
Finn, who is now working for
GI Help in San Francisco,
described some of the scenes that
turned him against the war. When
he was fighting near Pleiku, he
saw six Viet Cong heads laying on
a road, severed with American
bayonets, with aces of spades
pinned to them.
Ife saw an entire Vietnamese
village, he said, "obliterated" by
American flame-throwers.
"Villages are burned to the
ground and then mined; the
people cannot go back."
He also saw chlorine gas used to
clear Viet Cong out of certain
areas. The gas is fatal even in small
concentrations.

Two of the most widely used
bombs, Thorn noted, are the
huge, 2,000 pound napalm bombs
which are used for defoliating the
thick, green jungles of Vietnam,
and the anti-personnel
fragmentation bomb, which sends
pieces of shrapnel flying in all
directions when it explodes. The
shrapnel, Thorn said, cannot
pierce armor, but does penetrate
human flesh.
Bomber Squadron .Losses
Among other things, Thorn
worked as a debriefing officer in
Vietnam for naval bomber
squadrons. One bomber squadron
he worked with lost all their
planes twice, as well as half their
men in only nine months.

Former Army Sergeant Mickey
Finn also expressed what he saw
as the futility of the war.
"The war is useless and
tactically unsound," Finn noted.
"There are no front lines and rear
lines; except for Cam Ranh Bay,
no single area in South Vietnam is
secure. A hill may cost an officer
70 percent of his men to take, and
then it is abandoned the next
day."
Civil War, Not Invasion
Finn said that most of the
people see the conflict as a civil
war rather than as an invasion
from the North. "There are two
factions in Vietnam," Finn
explained, "pro-Western and
anti-Western. The invasion is being
carried on by the Americans."
Finn, who is now working for
GI Help in San Francisco,
described some of the scenes that
turned him against the war. When
he was fighting near Pleiku, he
saw six Viet Cong heads laying on
a road, severed with American
bayonets, with aces of spades
pinned to them.
Ife saw an entire Vietnamese
village, he said, "obliterated" by
American flame-throwers.
"Villages are burned to the
ground and then mined; the
people cannot go back."
He also saw chlorine gas used to
clear Viet Cong out of certain
areas. The gas is fatal even in small
concentrations.
The United States has dropped
large numbers of specially fused
bombs in Vietnam that will not
explode for three, five, seven, or
even ten years.
This was one of the many
unknown facts about the war
revealed Monday night by two
Viet veterans at a gathering of
students in the Cedro Lounge.
Lee Thorn, a former naval
intelligence officer who served in
Vietnam from December, 1965 to
August, 1966, explained the
ten-year-fuse bombs. "The
assumption for the use of these
bombs was that the war was going
to go on forever—which was a
pretty good assumption."
