# Cash, Bikes Likely Prey
## Campus Crime Rate Up 
### JOHN JOHNSTON 
'Ciime has always been a
problem at Stanford," according
to Bruce L. Wiggins, Manager of
University Security, "but in
recent years the crime rate has
risen tremendously
The police can't take care of
the whole situation, because most
of those people committing the
crimes are not students and are not
connected with the University.
"S ears ago the problem was less
severe because there were not as
main outsiders on campus.
Examining copies of last week's
crime reports, Wiggins emphasized
the element of carelessness on the
part of the students. Time and
again the words "door unlocked"
or "unlocked lounge" appeared.
"While it's impractical to lock
lounges," he conceded, "most
thefts occur in students rooms
that are left unlocked or open."
One girl who left her room

unlocked while visiting a friend in
another part of the dorm recently
learned this the hard way. She
came back to find over $100
missing.
A favorite trick of would-be
thieves when questioned is to
claim to be looking for someone
who isn't even in the house. This
usually satisfies the inquirer as to
the reason this strange person in
wandering around the halls.
"Bicycles and the like are a
different matter," said Wiggins.
They are often stolen on a
whole side basis, with a
corresponding degree of
sophistication. Thus, as many
students have found out, just
locking a bike will not make it
th el't-proof.
"The key here," stated Wiggins,
"Is immediately reporting the
theft. Once the thief gets off
campus with his loot, there is
little we can do."

One case where prompt
reporting paid off occurred last
week. A Stanford policeman was
following a pickup truck when, on
a sharp turn, the corner of the
tarp in the back flipped up,
revealing four bikes. The officer
stopped the truck. Finding the
driver's story suspicious, the
policeman radioed descriptions of
the bikes to the station to have
them checked against theft
reports. Two of them matched
with reports that had been made
that very morning.
The example is a typical one.
The driver and his helper were
both from San Francisco. Neither
was a student here. They had
taken the bikes with the aid of a
pair of bolt-cutters. If the owners
of the bikes had not reported tht
thefts immediately, the police
would not have had any reason to
detain the suspects, and the bikes
probably never would have been
recovered.
Mr. Wiggins outlined his other
duties in The Business Office. He
explained that his job it
essentially to make the campus
secure and safe so that everyone
here can "get his thing done" with
a minimum of trouble or worry.
Fire Precautious
Working closely with the
Planning Department, he executes
what he calls "total safety
planning." For example, he is
responsible for the precautions
taken against fire. This involves
such things as determining the
materials that go into the building
and what kind of fire detection or
extinguishing system to install.
