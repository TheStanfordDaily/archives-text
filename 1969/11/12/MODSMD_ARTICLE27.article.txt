# Hoop Outlook
## Strong Guards Lead Tribe 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's varsity basketball team has been working hard the last
few weeks in preparation for their season opener against Utah on
December 1.
Gone from last year's 9-17 team are the two leading scorers, Don
Griffin (20.4) and Mai McElwain (12.7). But a couple of key veterans
and a promising crop of sophomores and newomers gives hope for a
much improved team.
The problem of having no big man which has been plaguing
Stanford basketball ever since the graduation of Tom Dose may
finally be over this season.
Larry Rosenzweig, a 6-10 senior who played frosh ball in '66-'67
has rejoined the team this year, and his performance so far has been
encouraging. But Rosenzweig will have a tough job in trying to beat
out senior center Bill Palmer who averaged 8.9 points and 9.4
rebounds last year as the starting center.
Palmer has been an aggressive performer, but he is only 6-7 and his
size has greatly hampered his performance over the past two
campaigns.
Michel and Moore
Moving over to the forwards we find a couple of impressive
performers. Leading the returnees is Mike Michel, a 6-6, 200 lb. junior
who ended the season with a 7.2 scoring average after a disappointing
start. Michel is a fine jumper and his height helps to offset Stanford's
size problem in the pivot.
The other forward position will probably be filled by Chuck Moore,
a 6-4, 210 lb. senior who sat out last year with a bad back.
Moore averaged 6.7 points as a sophomore and he seemed headed
for greatness before his back operation forced him to the sidelines. As
well as being a fine shooter, Moore is an outstanding defensive player
and if his back holds up, the Indians could have a solid front line.
Adding depth at the forward position are two 6-4 players, Bill
Barber and Fred Green, both of whom saw considerable action last
season.
O'Neill Returns
But as usual, Stanford's strength will be at its guard position.
Leading the veteran performers is Dennis O'Neill who lead the team
last year with a 54 percent shooting average and 8 points a game.
O Neil 1, a 6-2, 175 lb. junior is an excellent perimeter shooter and he
is counted on to direct the Indian floor plan this season.

The other guard spot probably will be filled by Claude Terry a 6-5,
175 lb. sophomore sensation. Terry averaged 22.2 points last season
for a Stanford frosh record.
He is a sensational leaper and outside shooter, and should be one of
the top sophomores on the coast this season.
Adding depth at the guard position will be Greg Osborn, a 6-0, 170
lb. senior. Osborn is an excellent ball handler and should see plenty of
action this season.
Without a doubt, Stanford should improve on last year's 9-17
record. McElwain and Griffin are gone, but the surprise addition of
Rosenzweig should add a lot to the Indian's strength.
The ards have excellent all around height and a couple of great
shooters in Terry, Michel and O'Neill. If everything works out, this
team could be one of the best in recent years.
Tough Schedule
But as usual, Stanford faces an unenviable schedule and an
awesome display of talent on other Pac-8 teams. Playing such
non-conference powers as St. John's, Santa Clara, and Cincinnati in
the early going will be a real test of the Indians' ability.
Of course with the departure of Lew Alcindor, the Pac-8 will be a
more balanced league. But UCLA still has to be considered the
favorite with such returning stars as Curtis Rowe, Sid Wicks. John
Vallely, and Steve Patterson. The Bruins' biggest challenge will come
from Washington, Oregon State and California.
Washington Challenges
At Washington, all five starters, including Jay Bond and George
Irving, return. Adding to the Huskies strength will be a 6-8 sophomore
phenom who averaged 27 points and 15 rebounds as a freshman.
Now that 6-9 forward Gary Freeman has regained his eligibility,
Oregon State will also be tough. The Beavers have fine outside
shooting in Vince Fritz and an agile seven footer in Vic Bartolome.
Another team not to be overlooked is California. The Bears have
five outstanding individual performers in Phil Chenier, Ansley Truitt,
Jackie Ridgle, Charlie Johnson and Bobby White. If these five players
learn to play together, the Bears will be the prime contender.
All in all, the league looks quite improved this season and it will be
interesting to see just how much Stanford has improved in relation to
the other teams.


THE OPEN ENDâ€”Jim Plunkett fires a pass to his right as tight end Bob Moore looks back from over the middle. The
two Tribe stars combined often enough Saturday in downing Washington, 21-7. Plunkett was voted Back of the Game,
and yesterday named Pacific-8 Back of the Week for his effort against the Huskies. The junior thrower hurled his 16th
touchdown pass of the season, just one shy of the Pac-8 record. He continues to lead the league in total offense (2054
yards), and is just 142 short of his conference passing record set last year. Moore enjoyed another fine afternoon,
catching eight passes for 1 11 yards. The Indians face their last non-league foe when the Air Force Academy comes to
town on Moratorium Day.
