# Cal Wins By 2
## Freshman Drop Finale 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
No matter how you look at it,
it was a tough way to end the
season. The on-off-on again Little
Big Game was finally played
Monday afternoon and the
Papooses wound up on the short
end of the stick, dropping a
heartbreaker to the Bear Cubs,
42-21.
"This sounds on the sour side I
know," commented Coach
Moultrie following the ball game,
"but I sure wish that we could
have played Berkeley when the
game was scheduled."
The Cal-Stanford clash had
originally been slated for last
Saturday afternoon, but Cal,
fearing damage to their playing
field before the Oregon State
game, telephoned late Friday and
told Stanford to stay home. At
that time Coach Moultrie
attempted to line up an
alternative playing site, but was
unsuccessful. "Man, we would
have played them on a vacant
lot," bemoaned the coach Friday
afternoon.
But on Monday morning the
game was abruptly rescheduled
for that afternoon.
The Cubs got on the scoreboard
first on a 12 yard blast by Reed
Chastang but Eric Cross and Duke
Williams knotted the count at 7-7
as Cross plunged into the end
zone from four yards out and

Williams was good with the
conversion attempt.
Then Cal culminated a 58 yard
drive by connecting on a pass
from Chastang to Bill Armstrong
that was good for 19 yards and six
points. George Kiss split the
uprights to put the Bears out in
front 14-7.
As time was running out in the
first quarter, Ken Richardson
gathered in a Papoose punt at the
Stanford 48 and raced away to
pay dirt. The conversion gave the
Bears a comfortable 14 point
cushion.
Forced to play catch-up
football, the Tribe was forced to
go to the air lanes, and Cal's Vic
Karpenko alertly picked off a Pat
Moore aerial and returned it 32
yards for another Cub
touchdown.

Down now 28-7, the Tribe
launched an 83 yard drive in nine
plays that saw split-end Bill Scott,
who hauled in nine passes for 181
yards on the afternoon, snag an
eight yard scoring strike from Pat
Moore to close the gap to 28-14.
With 0:50 left to play in he
first half, linebacker Dennis
Peterson returned the compliment
and helped himself to a Cal pass
and his team to another six
points. Williams converted again
and Stanford went into the
dressing room trailing only for a
single touchdown 28-21.
Following a scoreless third
period, cut from 15 to 1 2 minutes
in length due to the rapidly
growing darkness, Cal exploded
for the final two touchdowns of
the game.
