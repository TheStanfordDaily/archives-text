# Student Leader Investigates Finances At State College
## 
### 
A state college student body
president has demanded a copy
of his institution's budget to
determine if there have been
"any irregularities in college
spending and fiscal
management."
Like Stanford's recent
unofficial disclosure of faculty
salaries, the move has drawn
heavy opposition from
professors.
Laurence B. Labovitz,
student body president of San
Fernando Valley State, told a
news conference last Thursday
that unless the administration
listens to the students, he will
call for a massive state-wide
student strike.
Mismanaged Funds
The action comes on the
heels of a report by state
auditor general William H.
Merrifield on the operation of
Sacramento State. That report
indicated that poor utilization
of classroom facilities and
mismanagement of funds, not
the publicized cutbacks in
requested allocations by he

Legislature, accounted for
students not being admitted to
that institution.
At Sacramento State, over
3000 students applied to fill
less than four hundred
vacancies this fall. Some even
camped on the steps of the
admissions office to enhance
their chances of being selected.
Last Wednesday Labovitz
asked the college controller to
supply him with a copy of the
1969-70 budget detailing
expenditures. The only
information that he has been
able to secure to date is a
generalized version of the state
college system's budget, of
which three pages deal with
San Fernando Valley State.
Joint Committee
But Labovitz isn't the only
one who would like to look at
the expenditures of the college.
The Joint Legislative Audit
Committee, headed by
Assemblyman Vincent Thomas
and State Senator Richard J.

Dolwig of San Mateo County,
is currently examining the
management and operations of
the California State Colleges.
This group has complained
of lack of detailed information
on expenditures. The state
colleges have in turn asked for
closer contact with the
committee and a chance to see
the contents of any report
before it is released.
Students Forgotten
Labovitz views the two
governmental activities as the
latest in "the long battle
between the state government
and the college
administration."
In his plea on Thursday to
the administration Labovitz
said: "Let the students say
where the expenditures can be
reduced. I can guarantee you
that it will not be in the area of
students or student activities,
although there may be room
for reduced administrators."
Student Investigation
A committee of ten students
will be appointed today by
Labovitz to delve into these
matters.
"There has been a
tremendous amount of student
interest and unity generated on
this issue," Labovitz said in a
phone interview with the Daily
last night.
Despite general faculty
opposition to the student
move, some professors have
asked to take part in the study.
A number of ex-employees of
the college have supplied him
with "good and very
interesting" information in the
past few days, Labovitz says.
Alleged Suppression
However, he charged last
night that a number of faculty
members are "trying to
suppress me."
"I believe that if the
students can show statewide
unity on this issue, campus
administrations will be forced
to hear our legitimate
grievances."
A letter is going out today
to all student body presidents
in the state informing them of
the activities at San Fernando
Valley State.
Apparently this is in
connection with Labovitz's
threat that "if the students are
not heard on these specific
questions, I will ask for the
cooperation of other student
body presidents in calling for a
massive student strike against
the imposition of any tuition
prior to the student
investigation."
