# ASSU Senate Head Edwards Articulates Minority Concerns
## 
### LAURA FOSTER 
"I'm biased," says David C.
Edwards, newly-elected chairman
of the Student Senate.
By his admission, Edwards is
biased in favor of black students
and Third World people at
Stanford. A black radical who has
put his talents to work for the
Establishment, the senior political
science major works hard as
founder of the Third World
Liberation Front at Stanford,
director of campus affairs for the
Black Student Union, and
minority relations director for
KZSU.
The major issue facing the
senate is the budget, according to
Edwards. He said that the senate
must decide how to allocate
$125,000 collected in student
fees, to more than twenty eligible
campus organizations. Of the
twenty organizations, Edwards
feels that the Black Students
Union deserves the most funds.
What would the BSU do with
the money from the senate?
Edwards said that one important
project would be sponsoring an
Afro-American cultural week,
including dramatic presentations,
art expositions and poetry
readings. The money would also
be used to help support the BSU
newspaper, The Colonist, and to
pay for black speakers for campus
lectures.
Organizational Ability
Although he was a loser in the

student senatorial race, Edwards,
21, was elected chairman
"because the leftist white liberals
decided they wanted someone
with organizational ability who
could get things done." He
indicated that his election would
result in fewer in-house feuds
among various factions of the
legislative body.
A transfer student, Edwards
holds as Associated Arts degree
from Bakersfield Junior College.
Married and the father of a
14-month old son, he is a native
of Morristown, N.J.
During the summer months, he
has served as a director of the
Neighborhood Youth Corps in
Bakersfield and the recreation
director of a Morristown
playground.
A "D" student in high school,
Edwards went to Bakersfield on
his advisor's recommendation. He
found it"the worst city" he's ever
been in because of its southern,
reactionary atmosphere. "The
people there are outright,
confirmed Birchers, and the
chief-of-police invites his friends
over for rifle-practicing parties,"
he commented. He heard one
citizen declare that if the Russians
were to drop a bomb on Los
Angeles, Bakersfield would build a
picket fence to keep the escaping,
contaminated Angelinos from
entering the town.
Third World Corn mi Intent
Stanford has a commitment to

the Third World, Edwards said. "I
think about that every day. Third
World nations are developing
nations with citizens of color," he
said. "Such nations are those in
Africa, South America, and
Indochina, including Vietnam."
"Elitist universities like
Stanford train their graduates to
exploit workers of
underdeveloped countries," he
said. "Business School graduates
are especially effective in

channeling the wealth of such
countries home to America. The
result is that our country had half
of the world's wealth, yet only
five percent of its people." The
Third World Liberation Front that
Kdwards founded at Stanford is a
branch of the group that

organized the strikes at San
Francisco State last year.
Edwards has enjoyed some
aspects of his career at Stanford,
in particular, his associations with
other black students. Of his
classes, he feels that only one in
ten was relevant. The problem
with the Political Science
Department, he feels is that the
professors are too concerned with
theory and observation and do
not place sufficient emphasis on
practical problem solving. They
practice what Eldridge Cleaver
termed "mental masturbation,"
Edwards said.
Favors Immediate Withdrawal
Like most radicals, Edwards
favors withdrawal of all U.S.
forces from Vietnam. He observed
that the U.S. can't win without
the support of the Vietnamese
people, and it obviously does not
have that support.
Edwards has been involved in
radical activities since high
school. As president of his senior
class, he was nearly impeached for
his civil-rights, anti-war attitude.
"I was very brash, but I didn't
care," he said. As a member of
CORE and the Methodist Student
Movement, he "participated in
sit-ins, teach-ins and the like."
Edwards hopes to build a career
in law and communications. He
plans to apply to several East
Coast law schools, including
Harvard, Yale, Columbia and
Rutgers.
