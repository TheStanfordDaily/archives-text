# Senate Reverses Moratorium Stand
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
In a surprise move last night,
the student Senate endorsed
President Kenneth Pitzer's denial
of an earlier Senate request to
cancel classes during the Vietnam
Moratorium.
Near the end of a tedious three
hour special session, members
quickly adopted the endorsement
by an 18-13 vote. The resolution
"supports the position taken by

President Pitzer that it must be
the position of the University not
to involve itself, as an institution,
in political issues where individual
discretion is required . . .
"We do inists, however, that
the President and the other
members of his administration
take all necessary steps to allow
faculty and staff members to
pursue their own convictions, and
indeed encourage their
participation," the resolution
continued. It was sponsored by
twelve moderate to right-leaning
members including Jim Schnieder,
Hal Mickelson and Eckhard
Schulz. (Full text printed below.)
The swift action stood in
contrast to earlier haggling. Amid
oratorial racket, members chose
four students for the student
Committee on Nominations, and
decided to modify procedure for
appointing students to trustee
committees.
Under a trustee approved plan,
President Kenneth Pitzer would
select students in consultation
with the Committee on
Nominations. The senate
resolution reserves final review of
the choices for the senate. What
will happen if the senate and
Pitzer clash is unclear.
Pre-Dave Harris?
Yale Braunstein initially
challenged the trustees'
procedure. He charged that if the
committee's nominations were
not made public before Pitzer
made his choice, students would
be relegated to "pre-Dave Harris"
status. John Shoch echoed
Braunstein's fear that student
selection would be thwarted if
Pitzer had the final say.
ASSU Council of Presidents'
member Pat Shea encouraged the
Senate to accept representation
on trustee committees without
insisting on a procedure which
will clash with trustees and "make
people rigid."
Schnieder sponsored the
successful resolution, which gives
the Senate a chance to register
disapproval of Pitzer's selections.
Clash Over Space
A second clash of the evening
developed when Speaker Dave
Edwards demanded "more room
immediately" in ASSU offices.
For more than 45 minutes,
members bickered over how to
secure office space for Edwards.
Finally they voted to demand
the space from Shea, who
maintained he was trying to make
the ASSU office in Tresidder
available to many campus groups
and did not mean to slight the
senate. Drumming his fingers and
sighing, Shea accepted the senate
resolution.
Before passing the Moratorium
resolution, members focused on
relatively orderly questioning of
Committee on Nominations
candidates.
Nominations Committee
The Senate then chose

undergraduates Faye Armstrong,
Mike Duncheon and Louis
Humphrey, and Robert Grant
from the graduate business school.
Michael Huffington, chairman
of the Finance Committee,
announced that budget
consideration will be re-opened
this week. Some organizations will
be given another chance to
present their needs; those not
heard in initial planning last spring
will be able to seek funds now.
Before considering the new
Moratorium resolution, the Senate
had considered who to send to the
faculty senate for discussion of
the original request for cancelling
classes. Whether the faculty body
will still take up the issue is
unclear at this point.
R esolu (ion
The new Moratorium resolution
reads:
Be it resolved that the ASSU Senate
supports the position taken by
President Pitzer that it must be Im
position of the University not to
involve itself, as an institution, in
politkal issues where indivklual
discretion is required. We endorse the
position of maintaining normal
operations of the University during the
Moratorium in order to allow all
individuals to follow their own
convictions concerning this issue.
We do insist, however, thai the
President and the other members of his
administration take all necessary steps
to allow faculty and stall members to
pursue their own convictions, and
indeed encourage their participation.
In this way we feel that Stanford
University can adopt a position of
academic and political freedom, and
also encourage moral and political
responsibility in the members of its
community.
