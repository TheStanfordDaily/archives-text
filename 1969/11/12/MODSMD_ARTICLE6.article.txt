WASHINGTON
(AP)—President Nixon's proposal
for a draft lottery cleared its
major Senate obstacle Tuesday.
Advocates of broader reform
agreed to drop their efforts this
year in return for a commitment
to hearings and possible legislation
in 1970.
The agreement was reached at
an hour-long meeting in
Democratic leader Mike
Mansfield's office, opening the
way for Senate approval of the
House-passed measure, possibly
before Thanksgiving.
Sen. John C. Stennis, D.-Miss.,
chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, told
reporters "I feel greatly
encouraged in that a bill can move
along and will pass the Senate
without amendments."
The House bill would repeal a
sentence in the 1967 Selective
Service Act that forbids use of a
lottery if 19-year-olds are drafted
first.
The Nixon administration has
said it will switch to the
19-year-old draft next year and
declared it would use other, more
complex methods, if Congress did
not permit a lottery.
The aim of the changes is to
limit a young man's liability to
one year, either the period he is
19 or the year after expiration of
a deferment for college. This
would make it easier for him to
plan his future without the threat
of the draft hanging over him for
several years.

by the Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare and sent to
the White House for approval, it
was reported here Tuesday night.
But a HEW spokesman said no
order had been signed.
Newscasters Tom Braden and
Frank Mankiewicz said in a news
program on WTOP-TV that
Secretary Robert Finch had sent
the order to President Nixon
Tuesday evening.
White House sources said they
know of no specific
communication between Finch
and the President Tuesday night
but conceded the subject has been
under discussion in recent weeks.
The HEW spokesman said
Finch had signed no order and
that Finch does not have the
authority to ban DDT. Sources
said such a ban would have to
come from the President or the
Secretary of Agriculture.
