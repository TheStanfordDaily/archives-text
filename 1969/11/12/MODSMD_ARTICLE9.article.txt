## Peace Activity 
### 
This past month leaves this country as heavily involved in
Vietnam and the rest of Asia as it was before the first
Moratorium Day. President Nixon in his Nov. 3 speech
refused to acknowledge the errors of the past: in fact he
called for renewed efforts to "win" the war in Vietnam.
Moratorium efforts must continue, and they must
continue with renewed effort because of President Nixon's
speech. Whether or not President Pitzer officially recognizes
the fact, the University has become a center of the anti-war
movement.
Stanford's "effete corps of imputent snobs" have for a
large part avoided the divisions that threaten to tear the
anti-war movement asunder. People here have joined
together under the antiwar umbrella, each working in his
own way to redirect the nation's energies. For the
November Moratorium and Mobilization, that effort must
grow if the specious policies of Nixon and Agnew are to be
stopped. There are numerous opportunities for marching,
leafleting, picketing, canvassing and protesting. We must
stay away from our classes and jobs Thursday and Friday,
devoting our time to the limited legitimate forms of protest
still available.
One activity in specific deserves the full support and
participation of the entire Stanford community. This is the
San Francisco Peace March on Saturday, which will
combine all the antiwar elements into one demonstration.
This march (and its equivilent in Washington) must receive
wide support from all segments of the antiwar movement:
employers and employees, students and professors, rads and
straights, mothers and grandmothers, veterans and
objectors, enlistees and draftees. The only useful meaning
that can come from this march is that a whole spectrum of
American humanity hates this war, not just a few student
radicals. Stanford people can well afford to put aside their
autumn football game to take their stand with the forces of
peace and reason. We must not abdicate our protests to a
silent majority.
Let us not give history the chance to judge us as harshly
as it has judged those who refused to oppose "the silent
majority" in Europe 30 years ago.
