# Goldwater Hits Draft, Moratorium
## 
### CHRIS COBEY 
Barry Goldwater brought his
curious blend of Davy Crockett,
General Westmoreland, and Adam
Smith to an overflow crowd
yesterday in Memorial
Auditorium.
The Arizona Republican spoke
on a variety of contemporary
issues, ranging from the Vietnam
war to drug laws, in a speech
entitled "A Look at the Decade
Ahead."
But his familiar right wing
image was certainly present,
especially in his stance on the war
and comments on NBC
newscasters Huntley and Brinkley
whom he called "effete snobs" for
their continued opposition to
conservative politics.
The 70 minute delivery was
punctuated by cheers, hisses,
boos, and applause.
Eternal Optimist About America
Declaring that he was "an
eternal optimist about America,"
the presidential candidate said he
had spent his "four year
sabbatical" from public office
assessing the attitudes and
aspirations of the American
people.
In commenting on the war in
South Vietnam, the Senator said
that he did not feel the regime
there was corrupt. He advocated
holding a new election to
ascertain the electoral mood of
the South Vietnamese people.
The 1956 Vietnamese elections
were not prevented by the U.S.
said Goldwater, since this nation
had only six hundred advisors
there at that time. He added that
"If my suggestions of 1964 had
been followed, the war would be
over now."
Do Your Thing
Senator Goldwater gave his
definition of freedom as allowing
people "to do their thing as long
as it does not interfere with
someone else's doing his thing."
In applying this to the fighting in
Southeast Asia, he said "We are at
war there to allow the government
to do what it wants to do."
On the subject of other foreign
commitments, the Senator
declared that one of the
undesirable outgrowths of the
Second World War was the
proliferation of military aid
treaties with 57 other nations, and
the signing of "16 or 17" mutual
aid and defense pacts with foreign
states. He termed the agreements
"the real problem child of the
United States."
In response to a question on
the Moratorium, Goldwater said,
"The timing is bad. We are
engaged in delicate peace
negotiations in Paris," and

although the demonstrators have
"the best American interests at
heart," the enemy might construe
these demonstrations as an
indication that "we were folding
up."
Advice to Demonstrators
The Senator advised that those
students who plan to participate
in Moratorium activities do so in
an "orderly" fashion. He said that
in all his years in public office, he
had seen only one effective
demonstration: one in support of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act held in
Washington, D.C.
Goldwater thought that Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew might
be considered for the Presidency
"before his time" if he continues
to voice the opinions that the
majority of the public share. The
Arizonan complained of "the guff
we conservatives have had to put
up with from the press," and he
was glad to see Agnew speaking
out. "I'm glad he's fighting back,
and I'm glad I'm on the team."
As a member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee,
Goldwater felt that defense
expenditures were high but not
"absurd."
R ('publicans and Blacks
When asked the question "Why
is it that ReDublicans are so

anti-black?", the Republican
legislator said that in part it was
because during the Depression,
Franklin Roosevelt fed the
unemployed blacks, and they've
voted Democratic ever since.
Goldwater cited his own
efforts on the Senate Education
and Labor Committee to deny to
unions the protection of the
National Labor Relations Act if
they practiced racial
discrimination. However, it was
"the liberal Democrats and
Republicans" who defeated his
proposed legislation.
Drug Legislation
The Arizona Senator reported
that he had been considering
drugs in light of the
near-impossibility of enforcing the
narcotics laws. He did not claim
he would lobby for the passage of
such a bill, but would "ask
questions about it."
In his formal speech, Goldwater
maintained that when a country
reaches the limits of its geographic
boundaries, it begins to slow
down. As a new frontier and "a
new bootstrap for America,"he
felt that space explorations and
related research would lead to
increased improvements in the
quality of everyday living.
