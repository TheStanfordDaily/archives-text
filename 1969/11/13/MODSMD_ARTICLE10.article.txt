"The Stanford Daily should
become a community newspaper"
states Editor Mark Weinberger.
Thousands of employees, who
work here, are part of this
community. Yet these thousands
are almost completely divorced
from the rest of the
community—students, faculty and
administration. The employees
must accept part of this
responsibility for not yet
mobilizing and unifying employees
sufficiently to make our presence
felt. Part of the responsibility must
be accepted by the faculty and
administration for ignoring and for
systematically excluding
employees from the educational
and organizational processes of this
community.
The wide gap of information,
understanding and often hostility
can be narrowed by closer
communication. This can be partly
accomplished with the help of a
newspaper such as the Stanford
Daily. The Daily has welcomed
articles and letters by employees.
However, it is not distributed to
employees. We are thus kept in
ignorance of the daily issues facing
the community as they arise. We
request the administration to
enable the Stanford Daily to print
sufficient copies for distribution to
employees. I hope we can enlist the
support of both students and
faculty to persuade the
administration to meet this
request.

Editor, THE DAILY:
1 would like to "publicly"
answer Pat Cowlishaw's questions
(Daily, Nov. 7) concerning the
"escalation" of the Moratorium.
On Meet the Press on October 12,
Sam Brown, one of the originators
of the idea of the Moratorium,
stated categorically that the
Moratorium's official position was
"immediate withdrawal of all U.S.
forces from Vietnam." I cannot
speak for Brown, but from all
conversations I have had with him
and with other Moratorium
"leaders" both in Washington and
here, the meaning of "immediate"
is to withdraw all U.S. troops,
planes, bombs, etc. over the
logistieally shortest possible
period. This is not a particularly
radical position: a recent Gallup
poll (November 3) shows that 32
percent of the American public
support it. The primary reason for
demanding immediate withdrawal

rather than the date-setting of
Goodell's resolution, is that the
former has the advantage of
Goodell's resolution in effectively
requiring the beginning of
withdrawal immediately; but
doesn't have the disadvantage of
having to abandon our position
when December, 1970, is past and
gone. It also means that we really
do want out now.
However, the Moratorium
leaders' position on immediate
withdrawal certainly does not
mean that everybody or anybody
who participates in Moratorium
activities must adhere to this
position. As Miss Cowlishaw states,
. . the real Beauty of the
October Moratorium seemed to be
the way in which it allowed a huge
mass of people the opportunity to
voice their opinions, whatever they
may have been, to their
community and to their
government." Since the official
position of the Moratorium in
October was immediate
withdrawal, and Miss Cowlishaw
and others who did not hold to that
"set of ideals" were able to
participate freely without any
constraint on their beliefs, 1 hope
that she will find herself still
committed enough to ending the
Vietnam war—the ultimate aim of
all those who are involved in the
Moratorium—to join us in
November and as long as the war
goes on.
Nevertheless, the concern that
Miss Cowlishaw showed for others
trying to impose ideals on the
Moratorium at the Sunday meeting
is real. I think that she is also right
to say that that attempt
demonstrates a fundamental
misunderstanding of the
Moratorium, and the way in which
to bring the large body of
participants in the Moratorium to
take more radical positions on the
war and related matters. Passing
resolutions at meetings is just not
going to get the Pat Cowlishaws to
recognize what may appear
obvious but are really quite subtle
and basic contradictions in our
society. In order to reach this
body, the radicals must dedicate
themselves to a many month
process of education. The
Moratorium can serve as the
framework for this education, but
not for the imposition of posit ions
which will alienate rather than
persuade.
On the other hand, I would
urge Pat Cowlishaw and ot hers who
have similar concerns to listen
carefully to the radical
interpretation of the causes and
direction of American foreign
policy. In the coming months, as
the Vietnam war. the Laos war, the
Americanization of Thailand and
Indonesia, and other probable U.S.
interventions around the world
continue, it would be well to
understand why our effort in the
Moratorium is so difficult, why
even when the majority of
Americans are and have been
against American troops being sent

to Asia, these troops were sent, and
why they will not be withdrawn by
December, 1970, or December,
1975, unless some important
institutions in America are
changed. The institution that we in
the Moratorium are attacking, and
I hope Miss Cowlishaw understands
that she is already involved in this
attack, is the concept that a few
men in Washington can control
opinion through the media, and
thus make decisions which are not
in our, the public, interest, but in
their interest. Unless those who are
active in the Moratorium are
willing to read, to prepare
themselves intellectually, to learn a
lot more about the history of the

war and its causes and effects than
they will learn from President
Nixon, then they will never endure
the massive campaign which the
Administration is launching against
the Moratorium.
I urge Pat Cowlishaw to
participate this month and all
months in the Moratorium,
expressing whatever views she
holds about withdrawal, but I also
urge her to read and listen, because
the pressure to abandon any
position against the American
presence in Vietnam (even
Goodell's) is going to get very
great.

Editor, THE DAILY:
1 would like to "publicly"
answer Pat Cowlishaw's questions
(Daily, Nov. 7) concerning the
"escalation" of the Moratorium.
On Meet the Press on October 12,
Sam Brown, one of the originators
of the idea of the Moratorium,
stated categorically that the
Moratorium's official position was
"immediate withdrawal of all U.S.
forces from Vietnam." I cannot
speak for Brown, but from all
conversations I have had with him
and with other Moratorium
"leaders" both in Washington and
here, the meaning of "immediate"
is to withdraw all U.S. troops,
planes, bombs, etc. over the
logistieally shortest possible
period. This is not a particularly
radical position: a recent Gallup
poll (November 3) shows that 32
percent of the American public
support it. The primary reason for
demanding immediate withdrawal

rather than the date-setting of
Goodell's resolution, is that the
former has the advantage of
Goodell's resolution in effectively
requiring the beginning of
withdrawal immediately; but
doesn't have the disadvantage of
having to abandon our position
when December, 1970, is past and
gone. It also means that we really
do want out now.
However, the Moratorium
leaders' position on immediate
withdrawal certainly does not
mean that everybody or anybody
who participates in Moratorium
activities must adhere to this
position. As Miss Cowlishaw states,
. . the real Beauty of the
October Moratorium seemed to be
the way in which it allowed a huge
mass of people the opportunity to
voice their opinions, whatever they
may have been, to their
community and to their
government." Since the official
position of the Moratorium in
October was immediate
withdrawal, and Miss Cowlishaw
and others who did not hold to that
"set of ideals" were able to
participate freely without any
constraint on their beliefs, 1 hope
that she will find herself still
committed enough to ending the
Vietnam war—the ultimate aim of
all those who are involved in the
Moratorium—to join us in
November and as long as the war
goes on.
Nevertheless, the concern that
Miss Cowlishaw showed for others
trying to impose ideals on the
Moratorium at the Sunday meeting
is real. I think that she is also right
to say that that attempt
demonstrates a fundamental
misunderstanding of the
Moratorium, and the way in which
to bring the large body of
participants in the Moratorium to
take more radical positions on the
war and related matters. Passing
resolutions at meetings is just not
going to get the Pat Cowlishaws to
recognize what may appear
obvious but are really quite subtle
and basic contradictions in our
society. In order to reach this
body, the radicals must dedicate
themselves to a many month
process of education. The
Moratorium can serve as the
framework for this education, but
not for the imposition of posit ions
which will alienate rather than
persuade.
On the other hand, I would
urge Pat Cowlishaw and ot hers who
have similar concerns to listen
carefully to the radical
interpretation of the causes and
direction of American foreign
policy. In the coming months, as
the Vietnam war. the Laos war, the
Americanization of Thailand and
Indonesia, and other probable U.S.
interventions around the world
continue, it would be well to
understand why our effort in the
Moratorium is so difficult, why
even when the majority of
Americans are and have been
against American troops being sent

to Asia, these troops were sent, and
why they will not be withdrawn by
December, 1970, or December,
1975, unless some important
institutions in America are
changed. The institution that we in
the Moratorium are attacking, and
I hope Miss Cowlishaw understands
that she is already involved in this
attack, is the concept that a few
men in Washington can control
opinion through the media, and
thus make decisions which are not
in our, the public, interest, but in
their interest. Unless those who are
active in the Moratorium are
willing to read, to prepare
themselves intellectually, to learn a
lot more about the history of the

war and its causes and effects than
they will learn from President
Nixon, then they will never endure
the massive campaign which the
Administration is launching against
the Moratorium.
I urge Pat Cowlishaw to
participate this month and all
months in the Moratorium,
expressing whatever views she
holds about withdrawal, but I also
urge her to read and listen, because
the pressure to abandon any
position against the American
presence in Vietnam (even
Goodell's) is going to get very
great.

Editor, THE DAILY:
1 would like to "publicly"
answer Pat Cowlishaw's questions
(Daily, Nov. 7) concerning the
"escalation" of the Moratorium.
On Meet the Press on October 12,
Sam Brown, one of the originators
of the idea of the Moratorium,
stated categorically that the
Moratorium's official position was
"immediate withdrawal of all U.S.
forces from Vietnam." I cannot
speak for Brown, but from all
conversations I have had with him
and with other Moratorium
"leaders" both in Washington and
here, the meaning of "immediate"
is to withdraw all U.S. troops,
planes, bombs, etc. over the
logistieally shortest possible
period. This is not a particularly
radical position: a recent Gallup
poll (November 3) shows that 32
percent of the American public
support it. The primary reason for
demanding immediate withdrawal

rather than the date-setting of
Goodell's resolution, is that the
former has the advantage of
Goodell's resolution in effectively
requiring the beginning of
withdrawal immediately; but
doesn't have the disadvantage of
having to abandon our position
when December, 1970, is past and
gone. It also means that we really
do want out now.
However, the Moratorium
leaders' position on immediate
withdrawal certainly does not
mean that everybody or anybody
who participates in Moratorium
activities must adhere to this
position. As Miss Cowlishaw states,
. . the real Beauty of the
October Moratorium seemed to be
the way in which it allowed a huge
mass of people the opportunity to
voice their opinions, whatever they
may have been, to their
community and to their
government." Since the official
position of the Moratorium in
October was immediate
withdrawal, and Miss Cowlishaw
and others who did not hold to that
"set of ideals" were able to
participate freely without any
constraint on their beliefs, 1 hope
that she will find herself still
committed enough to ending the
Vietnam war—the ultimate aim of
all those who are involved in the
Moratorium—to join us in
November and as long as the war
goes on.
Nevertheless, the concern that
Miss Cowlishaw showed for others
trying to impose ideals on the
Moratorium at the Sunday meeting
is real. I think that she is also right
to say that that attempt
demonstrates a fundamental
misunderstanding of the
Moratorium, and the way in which
to bring the large body of
participants in the Moratorium to
take more radical positions on the
war and related matters. Passing
resolutions at meetings is just not
going to get the Pat Cowlishaws to
recognize what may appear
obvious but are really quite subtle
and basic contradictions in our
society. In order to reach this
body, the radicals must dedicate
themselves to a many month
process of education. The
Moratorium can serve as the
framework for this education, but
not for the imposition of posit ions
which will alienate rather than
persuade.
On the other hand, I would
urge Pat Cowlishaw and ot hers who
have similar concerns to listen
carefully to the radical
interpretation of the causes and
direction of American foreign
policy. In the coming months, as
the Vietnam war. the Laos war, the
Americanization of Thailand and
Indonesia, and other probable U.S.
interventions around the world
continue, it would be well to
understand why our effort in the
Moratorium is so difficult, why
even when the majority of
Americans are and have been
against American troops being sent

to Asia, these troops were sent, and
why they will not be withdrawn by
December, 1970, or December,
1975, unless some important
institutions in America are
changed. The institution that we in
the Moratorium are attacking, and
I hope Miss Cowlishaw understands
that she is already involved in this
attack, is the concept that a few
men in Washington can control
opinion through the media, and
thus make decisions which are not
in our, the public, interest, but in
their interest. Unless those who are
active in the Moratorium are
willing to read, to prepare
themselves intellectually, to learn a
lot more about the history of the

war and its causes and effects than
they will learn from President
Nixon, then they will never endure
the massive campaign which the
Administration is launching against
the Moratorium.
I urge Pat Cowlishaw to
participate this month and all
months in the Moratorium,
expressing whatever views she
holds about withdrawal, but I also
urge her to read and listen, because
the pressure to abandon any
position against the American
presence in Vietnam (even
Goodell's) is going to get very
great.

"The Stanford Daily should

states Editor Mark Weinberger.
Thousands of employees, who
work here, are part of this
community. Yet these thousands
are almost completely divorced
from the rest of the
community—students, faculty and
administration. The employees
must accept part of this
responsibility for not yet
mobilizing and unifying employees
sufficiently to make our presence
felt. Part of the responsibility must
be accepted by the faculty and
administration for ignoring and for
systematically excluding
employees from the educational
and organizational processes of this
community.
The wide gap of information,
understanding and often hostility
can be narrowed by closer
communication. This can be partly
accomplished with the help of a
newspaper such as the Stanford
Daily. The Daily has welcomed
articles and letters by employees.
However, it is not distributed to
employees. We are thus kept in
ignorance of the daily issues facing
the community as they arise. We
request the administration to
enable the Stanford Daily to print
