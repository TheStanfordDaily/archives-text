# Afro and Afro-American Studies
## St. Clair Drake Committed To Change 
### SUSAN MAAS 
If appearances made the man,
Professor St. Clair Drake might be
an Old Testament patriarch,
except for one factor, he is black.
Prof. Drake is chairman of the
Committee on Afro and
Afro-American Studies at
Stanford, and a professor of
sociology and anthropology.
Rather long hair and a full
beard give him an impressiveness
quite surpassing his physical
stature. His record of research and

teaching adds further authority to
his remarks.
"I haven't noticed much racism
in this area," Drake comments,
adding, "the primary lines of
tension in the Peninsula involve
relations between Chicanos and
Anglos. As far as black-white
relations are concerned, there are
traces of institutional racism, but
not in the degree that it is found
in more urbanized areas."
Drake's opinions are backed up
by research in Mississippi,
Chicago, Africa, the West Indies,
and England. Since 1935, he has
been doing what he terms "a
cross-cultural study of racial and
ethnic relations with special
emphasis on such relations in
urban areas."
In the mid-thirties, Drake first
went into Mississippi, to study
black-white relations.
"Going into the Deep South
was like going into another
world," he remembers. "It was
interesting because I was young,
and it was a new experience. It
was also informative, exciting," he
pauses a moment, "tragic."
Commitment
This experience forced Drake
to make a commitment to do
something to change the situation.
Before, he had led a rather
protected life, having a minister
father and attending school in

Pittsburgh and Virginia, where the
situation wasn't as bad.
The professor pauses to light a
cigarette. "I was young then. I
thought if someone got the facts
out, things would change."
As chairman of the Committee
on Afro and Afro-American
Studies, Drake is trying to change
things in a different way. He is
working with others to expand
the curriculum of black studies, to
find out what courses are needed,
and to see what courses black
students want.
He works with the Committee,
which consists of four faculty
members and three students, and
with the Black Student Union.
One project being developed is
a course on racism and prejudice,
to be offered winter-spring this
year. It will deal not only with the
black perspective, but with that of
non-black minorities in this
country.
Conclusions
Through his research, Drake has
come to five main conclusions.
First, he states, "Whether in the
U.S., the West Indies, Africa, or
Europe, all social systems are class
stratified, based on education and
money, and other factors."
"Wherever you have colored
and white people in contact, being
colored becomes a factor that
lowers status and opportunities,"

Drake gives as the second
generalization.
This is because 500 years of
European colonization brought
institutionalized racism into
being, and "b> historical accident,
the people in power happened to
be white."
"Since black Africans were
used in the position of slaves, they
have been depressed to the
bottom of world stratification,"
Drake continues. "Thus color
becomes a symbol of
subordination."
His face is lined in
concentration. "You're making
me think it out systematically,
and I've never done that before.
The fourth point would be that
how important color is varies in
terms of the European culture
involved and the degree of
exploitation."
With the Spanish and
Portuguese, there was little racial
prejudice, except as justification
for exploitation. The worst
prejudice is found in areas
dominated by North Europeans,
particularly English or Irish.
Finally, "since seven out of
every eight people are red,
brown," he pauses between each
color, "black, or yellow," a slight
smile, "we are in the midst of a
shift of power. That's what makes
this period so significant."
Reverse Racism
In order to avoid reverse
racism, it is necessary to

understand what is going on.
However, Drake adds, he has seen
little evidence that colored groups
want to briny such racism about.
Among other things, he was
trying to discover "how much of
Africa still survives, the ways in
which people tried to maintain
their integrity and dignity under
the conditions of slavery, and how
they tried to free themselves."
Drake noted that Southern
masters, unable to convert West
Indies blacks to Christianity
themselves, sent their slaves over
to do the job. The slaves were
apparently more successful.
Prof. Drake is not overly happy
with the Nixon administration.
"The government should be the
guardian of the rights of its
people," he states. It has an
obligation to desegregate
American society and to provide
job training and needed welfare to
low income groups.
"The greatest favor the nation
could do blacks would be to
equalize chances for getting an
education."
The New Federalism, which
would put welfare decisions in
local hands, Drake terms "a
reactionary, backward plan,"
declaring, "The New Federalism
would work to the disadvantage
of the disadvantaged."
The nation must continue the
trend begun with the New Deal,
"moving in the direction of
coping with our problems," the
professor concluded.

obligation to desegregate
American society and to provide
job training and needed welfare to
low income groups.
"The greatest favor the nation
could do blacks would be to
equalize chances for getting an
education."
The New Federalism, which
would put welfare decisions in
local hands, Drake terms "a
reactionary, backward plan,"
declaring, "The New Federalism
would work to the disadvantage
of the disadvantaged."
The nation must continue the
trend begun with the New Deal,
"moving in the direction of
coping with our problems," the
professor concluded.


ST. CLAIR DRAKE: "Wherever you have colored and white people in contact,
being colored becomes a factor that lowers status."
If appearances made the man,
Professor St. Clair Drake might be
an Old Testament patriarch,
except for one factor, he is black.
Prof. Drake is chairman of the
Committee on Afro and
Afro-American Studies at
Stanford, and a professor of
sociology and anthropology.
Rather long hair and a full
beard give him an impressiveness
quite surpassing his physical
stature. His record of research and

teaching adds further authority to
his remarks.
"I haven't noticed much racism
in this area," Drake comments,
adding, "the primary lines of
tension in the Peninsula involve
relations between Chicanos and
Anglos. As far as black-white
relations are concerned, there are
traces of institutional racism, but
not in the degree that it is found
in more urbanized areas."
Drake's opinions are backed up
by research in Mississippi,
Chicago, Africa, the West Indies,
and England. Since 1935, he has
been doing what he terms "a
cross-cultural study of racial and
ethnic relations with special
emphasis on such relations in
urban areas."
In the mid-thirties, Drake first
went into Mississippi, to study
black-white relations.
"Going into the Deep South
was like going into another
world," he remembers. "It was
interesting because I was young,
and it was a new experience. It
was also informative, exciting," he
pauses a moment, "tragic."
Commitment
This experience forced Drake
to make a commitment to do
something to change the situation.
Before, he had led a rather
protected life, having a minister
father and attending school in

Pittsburgh and Virginia, where the
situation wasn't as bad.
The professor pauses to light a
cigarette. "I was young then. I
thought if someone got the facts
out, things would change."
As chairman of the Committee
on Afro and Afro-American
Studies, Drake is trying to change
things in a different way. He is
working with others to expand
the curriculum of black studies, to
find out what courses are needed,
and to see what courses black
students want.
He works with the Committee,
which consists of four faculty
members and three students, and
with the Black Student Union.
One project being developed is
a course on racism and prejudice,
to be offered winter-spring this
year. It will deal not only with the
black perspective, but with that of
non-black minorities in this
country.
Conclusions
Through his research, Drake has
come to five main conclusions.
First, he states, "Whether in the
U.S., the West Indies, Africa, or
Europe, all social systems are class
stratified, based on education and
money, and other factors."
"Wherever you have colored
and white people in contact, being
colored becomes a factor that
lowers status and opportunities,"

Drake gives as the second
generalization.
This is because 500 years of
European colonization brought
institutionalized racism into
being, and "b> historical accident,
the people in power happened to
be white."
"Since black Africans were
used in the position of slaves, they
have been depressed to the
bottom of world stratification,"
Drake continues. "Thus color
becomes a symbol of
subordination."
His face is lined in
concentration. "You're making
me think it out systematically,
and I've never done that before.
The fourth point would be that
how important color is varies in
terms of the European culture
involved and the degree of
exploitation."
With the Spanish and
Portuguese, there was little racial
prejudice, except as justification
for exploitation. The worst
prejudice is found in areas
dominated by North Europeans,
particularly English or Irish.
Finally, "since seven out of
every eight people are red,
brown," he pauses between each
color, "black, or yellow," a slight
smile, "we are in the midst of a
shift of power. That's what makes
this period so significant."
Reverse Racism
In order to avoid reverse
racism, it is necessary to

understand what is going on.
However, Drake adds, he has seen
little evidence that colored groups
want to briny such racism about.
Among other things, he was
trying to discover "how much of
Africa still survives, the ways in
which people tried to maintain
their integrity and dignity under
the conditions of slavery, and how
they tried to free themselves."
Drake noted that Southern
masters, unable to convert West
Indies blacks to Christianity
themselves, sent their slaves over
to do the job. The slaves were
apparently more successful.
Prof. Drake is not overly happy
with the Nixon administration.
"The government should be the
guardian of the rights of its
people," he states. It has an
obligation to desegregate
American society and to provide
job training and needed welfare to
low income groups.
"The greatest favor the nation
could do blacks would be to

However, Drake adds, he has seen
little evidence that colored groups
want to briny such racism about.
Among other things, he was
trying to discover "how much of
Africa still survives, the ways in
which people tried to maintain
their integrity and dignity under
the conditions of slavery, and how
they tried to free themselves."
Drake noted that Southern
masters, unable to convert West
Indies blacks to Christianity
themselves, sent their slaves over
to do the job. The slaves were
apparently more successful.
Prof. Drake is not overly happy
with the Nixon administration.
"The government should be the
guardian of the rights of its
people," he states. It has an
obligation to desegregate
American society and to provide
job training and needed welfare to
low income groups.
"The greatest favor the nation
could do blacks would be to
equalize chances for getting an
education."
The New Federalism, which
would put welfare decisions in
local hands, Drake terms "a
reactionary, backward plan,"
declaring, "The New Federalism
would work to the disadvantage
of the disadvantaged."
The nation must continue the
trend begun with the New Deal,
"moving in the direction of
coping with our problems," the
professor concluded.


ST. CLAIR DRAKE: "Wherever you have colored and white people in contact,
being colored becomes a factor that lowers status."
If appearances made the man,
Professor St. Clair Drake might be
an Old Testament patriarch,
except for one factor, he is black.
Prof. Drake is chairman of the
Committee on Afro and
Afro-American Studies at
Stanford, and a professor of
sociology and anthropology.
Rather long hair and a full
beard give him an impressiveness
quite surpassing his physical
stature. His record of research and

teaching adds further authority to
his remarks.
"I haven't noticed much racism
in this area," Drake comments,
adding, "the primary lines of
tension in the Peninsula involve
relations between Chicanos and
Anglos. As far as black-white
relations are concerned, there are
traces of institutional racism, but
not in the degree that it is found
in more urbanized areas."
Drake's opinions are backed up
by research in Mississippi,
Chicago, Africa, the West Indies,
and England. Since 1935, he has
been doing what he terms "a
cross-cultural study of racial and
ethnic relations with special
emphasis on such relations in
urban areas."
In the mid-thirties, Drake first
went into Mississippi, to study
black-white relations.
"Going into the Deep South
was like going into another
world," he remembers. "It was
interesting because I was young,
and it was a new experience. It
was also informative, exciting," he
pauses a moment, "tragic."
Commitment
This experience forced Drake
to make a commitment to do
something to change the situation.
Before, he had led a rather
protected life, having a minister
father and attending school in

Pittsburgh and Virginia, where the
situation wasn't as bad.
The professor pauses to light a
cigarette. "I was young then. I
thought if someone got the facts
out, things would change."
As chairman of the Committee
on Afro and Afro-American
Studies, Drake is trying to change
things in a different way. He is
working with others to expand
the curriculum of black studies, to
find out what courses are needed,
and to see what courses black
students want.
He works with the Committee,
which consists of four faculty
members and three students, and
with the Black Student Union.
One project being developed is
a course on racism and prejudice,
to be offered winter-spring this
year. It will deal not only with the
black perspective, but with that of
non-black minorities in this
country.
Conclusions
Through his research, Drake has
come to five main conclusions.
First, he states, "Whether in the
U.S., the West Indies, Africa, or
Europe, all social systems are class
stratified, based on education and
money, and other factors."
"Wherever you have colored
and white people in contact, being
colored becomes a factor that
lowers status and opportunities,"

Drake gives as the second
generalization.
This is because 500 years of
European colonization brought
institutionalized racism into
being, and "b> historical accident,
the people in power happened to
be white."
"Since black Africans were
used in the position of slaves, they
have been depressed to the
bottom of world stratification,"
Drake continues. "Thus color
becomes a symbol of
subordination."
His face is lined in
concentration. "You're making
me think it out systematically,
and I've never done that before.
The fourth point would be that
how important color is varies in
terms of the European culture
involved and the degree of
exploitation."
With the Spanish and
Portuguese, there was little racial
prejudice, except as justification
for exploitation. The worst
prejudice is found in areas
dominated by North Europeans,
particularly English or Irish.
Finally, "since seven out of
every eight people are red,
brown," he pauses between each
color, "black, or yellow," a slight
smile, "we are in the midst of a
shift of power. That's what makes
this period so significant."

racism, it is necessary to

understand what is going on.
