# Political Ban Ruling Delayed By Court
## 
### 
A decision on the
constitutionality of Palo Alto
Unified School District's right to
ban campus political groups was
put off last Monday until the
court can see what steps the board
of education will take at their
November 21 study session.
Judge Robert Peckham of Palo
Alto was told that recommenda
tions were to be made at the up
coming meeting to abolish or
amend the present rule against
political activity on campus.
Peckham, judge at the Federal
District Court in San Jose, thus
decided, as he put it, "to give
local authorities every
opportunity to comply with the
Constitution."
The rule now in question, set
up on January 15, 1968, prohibits
school organizations from
participating in political advocacy
or partisan political activities on
campus.
The suit against the school
district has been filed by three
local high school students, Andrea
Holman, 15, of Gunn High; David
Jacobs, 17, of Palo Alto High; and
Caludia Wax, 17, of Cubberley
High. With the help of the
American Civil Liberties Union
they hope to gain an injunction
against the rule on the grounds
that it is unconstitutional.
Judge Criticized
Judge Peckham's delay drew
criticism from the representative
of, the ACLU, attorney John

Thome. Thome declared that it
was "the court's responsibility to
determine if the rule is
constitutional. It is not the court's
responsibility to consider what
the school board might do."
Thome also pointed out the high
school student was a human being
and a citizen and thus entitled to
the same rights as other citizens.
Attorney Leigh Stevenson,
representing the school district,
stated that students, as minors, do
not have the constitutional right
of free involvement during the
school hours. Stevenson, a
member of the Santa Clara
County counsel's staff, stated,
"Compulsory education is a
classic example of violation of
freedom of association for
students."
Expressed Fear
Stevenson expressed some
anxieties if the court were to pass
an injunction. He pointed out that
a "student organization whose
avowed purpose would bt the
segregation of the races would
have to be recognized." Thome
agreed but felt that this is the way
it should be. "People have a right
to advocate those very things."
Good Old Days
Judge Peckham pointed out
that there were no such rules when
he went to P.A. High. Under the
present rule, "there can be no
Young Democrats for Roosevelt
or Young Republicans for Landon
as we had it in 1938," he stated.

Peckham, judge at the Federal
District Court in San Jose, thus
decided, as he put it, "to give
local authorities every
opportunity to comply with the
Constitution."
The rule now in question, set
up on January 15, 1968, prohibits
school organizations from
participating in political advocacy
or partisan political activities on
campus.
The suit against the school
district has been filed by three
local high school students, Andrea
Holman, 15, of Gunn High; David
Jacobs, 17, of Palo Alto High; and
Caludia Wax, 17, of Cubberley
High. With the help of the
American Civil Liberties Union
they hope to gain an injunction
against the rule on the grounds
that it is unconstitutional.
Judge Criticized
Judge Peckham's delay drew
criticism from the representative
of, the ACLU, attorney John

Thome. Thome declared that it
was "the court's responsibility to
determine if the rule is
constitutional. It is not the court's
responsibility to consider what
the school board might do."
Thome also pointed out the high
school student was a human being
and a citizen and thus entitled to
the same rights as other citizens.
Attorney Leigh Stevenson,
representing the school district,
stated that students, as minors, do
not have the constitutional right
of free involvement during the
school hours. Stevenson, a
member of the Santa Clara
County counsel's staff, stated,
"Compulsory education is a
classic example of violation of
freedom of association for
students."
Expressed Fear
Stevenson expressed some
anxieties if the court were to pass
an injunction. He pointed out that
a "student organization whose
avowed purpose would bt the
segregation of the races would
have to be recognized." Thome
agreed but felt that this is the way
it should be. "People have a right
to advocate those very things."
Good Old Days
Judge Peckham pointed out
that there were no such rules when
he went to P.A. High. Under the
present rule, "there can be no
Young Democrats for Roosevelt
or Young Republicans for Landon
as we had it in 1938," he stated.
A decision on the
constitutionality of Palo Alto
Unified School District's right to
ban campus political groups was
put off last Monday until the
court can see what steps the board
of education will take at their
November 21 study session.
Judge Robert Peckham of Palo
Alto was told that recommenda
tions were to be made at the up
coming meeting to abolish or
amend the present rule against
political activity on campus.
