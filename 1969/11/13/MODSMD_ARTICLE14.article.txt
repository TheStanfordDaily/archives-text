# Foothill Development
## Environment Study 
### 
The Palo Alto foothills could
be profitably developed in small
lots, according to the first report
of the Environment Design Study,
presented Monday night at City
Hall.
Consultant Lawrence Livington
labeled the $144,000 report "just
the opener" with more to come.
In a two hour presentationwith
illustrating slides, his firm
explored the question: is the city
best served by its present policy
that limits development except on
Stanford lands mainly to
residential use on acre lots and
larger? The report commented on
land use, trafficways and transit,
ecology, visual and recreation
factors, geology, hydrology, and
economic factors.
Fire Hazard
Livingston said that some
regional cooperation will be
involved in foothills development
because of the extreme fire
hazards. "The State Division of
Forestry ranks the Palo Alto
foothills fourth inthestate (of 121
districts) in potential fire loss and
18th in fire hazard," he said.
Concerning possible
earthquakes, Livingston said the
ground motion would not
"necessarily be any greater in the

San Andreas fault zone than in
many other portions of the study
area."
The report contained
information about future housing
in the foothills. "Field surveys
indicate that houses built on
quarter-acre lots could be
marketed profitably at $55,000 to
$65,000 and on 8000 square-foot
lots the price range might be
$50,000 to $60,000," he said.
Fu lure Homes
"Single family homes built
below Foothills Park on acre lots
would have to sell for at least
$75,000 and probably would
average $80,000 to $85,000."
The report claimed that much
of the foothills land consists of
undeveloped Stanford properties
"but that the school does not
have a plan for its non-campus
lands."
Livingston said the report
represented five out of the total
20 months of work that will be
involved before a final version is
readied for the city. The next
report, which should be ready in a
month, will suggest a full range of
ideas on how the foothills can be
developed, ranging from low
development open space to high
intensity uses.

be profitably developed in small
lots, according to the first report
of the Environment Design Study,
presented Monday night at City
Hall.
Consultant Lawrence Livington
labeled the $144,000 report "just
the opener" with more to come.
In a two hour presentationwith
illustrating slides, his firm
explored the question: is the city
best served by its present policy
that limits development except on
Stanford lands mainly to
residential use on acre lots and
larger? The report commented on
land use, trafficways and transit,
ecology, visual and recreation
factors, geology, hydrology, and
economic factors.
Fire Hazard
Livingston said that some
regional cooperation will be
involved in foothills development
because of the extreme fire
hazards. "The State Division of
Forestry ranks the Palo Alto
foothills fourth inthestate (of 121
districts) in potential fire loss and
18th in fire hazard," he said.
Concerning possible
earthquakes, Livingston said the
ground motion would not
"necessarily be any greater in the

San Andreas fault zone than in
many other portions of the study
area."
The report contained
information about future housing
in the foothills. "Field surveys
indicate that houses built on
quarter-acre lots could be
marketed profitably at $55,000 to
$65,000 and on 8000 square-foot
lots the price range might be
$50,000 to $60,000," he said.
Fu lure Homes
"Single family homes built
below Foothills Park on acre lots
would have to sell for at least
$75,000 and probably would
average $80,000 to $85,000."
The report claimed that much
of the foothills land consists of
undeveloped Stanford properties
"but that the school does not
have a plan for its non-campus
lands."
Livingston said the report
represented five out of the total
20 months of work that will be
involved before a final version is
readied for the city. The next
report, which should be ready in a
month, will suggest a full range of
ideas on how the foothills can be
developed, ranging from low
development open space to high
intensity uses.
