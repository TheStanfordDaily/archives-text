# Classical Groore: La Cenerentola
## Fairy Tale-A Joyful Affair 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Once upon a time they gave an
opera. All the singers sang
superbly and even acted their
parts as well. Everyone —down to
the last straggling
chorister—seemed to be alive in
the little world on stage. The
orchestra showed a sprightly
interest in the music it was
making. The setting was an
aesthetic whole; the stage
direction, a tour de force of great
genius, was perfect from its

choreography to the slightest
finger-tip mannerisms. And the
audience lived happily ever after.
No fairy tale this; it is actually
happening in the S.F. Opera's
premiere production of Rossini's
version of the Cinderella story, La
Cenerentola. The production,
indeed, leaves the company's
previous standards of excellence
in comic opera in shambles.
Pleasant memories are now mere
shards, and (with improvement
upon the sublime impossible) the
future is a bleak, downhill
prospect.
But the joy of a fairy tale is in
the moment, and Cenerentola is at
this moment as joyful affair as one
could possibly conjure. Though
Rossini's version omits a few
things which will shatter an
English-speaking audience (no
glass slipper, pumpkin, or fuiry
godmother), some amusing Italian
comic traditions have been added.
There is the paternal buffoon Don
Magnifico and a Prince and his
know-it-all valet (shades of
Figaro!) who are of course
disguised as each other.
Madcap Cast
Appropriately, the Opera has
engaged a madcap condottierie of
Italians for this production. They
pillage shamelessly, though
artfully, for laughter, and they
make the most monstrous
pratfalling, the most attenuated

grasps at humor, seem extremely
amusing.
Unquestionably, I think, the
success of this production is duev
to Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, who
designed all the sets and,
unusually, who was also the stage
director. An American debut
could hardly have been more
auspicious. It would be laborious,
if not impossible, to catalogue the
instances of both large-scale
inspiration and clever, off-the-cuff
minutiae which Mr. Ponnelle has
lent to his Cenerentola.
His sets capture the disparate
elements of the opera—the vein of
shabby Italian society, the madly
eccentric airs of the characters,
and the preposterousness of the
fairytale lore which pokes in and
out of the plot. In short, Ponnelle
has extended the wit and wryness
of the opera into the very walls
an furnishings of the
dollhouse—like sets where the
story unfolds. A refreshing twist
in this era of darksome and
symbolic stage design!
Inventive Genius
The sets alone would have
assured Ponnelle's domination.
His stage direction was astonishing
in its own right. Not only did he
sustain a blend of sheer comic
loquacity, but he also achieved a
kind of stylization of movement
and mannerism which heightened
the fairytale essence of the opera.
Incredibly, Ponnelle went

further and displayed a keen
affinity to Rossini's musical
idiom. He knows what to do with
the crescendo-diminuendo which
is ever-present. His spcx>f of
Rossini's delectably interminable
finales (at the end of Act II
everyone is on stage before a
sumptuous dinner table and all are
dying to start eating) is one lone
example of Ponnelle's honest
rapDort with Rossini.
Of course, no director could
have succeeded without singers
intelligent and fluid enough to
make the stage-business come
alive. The cast rose as one to the
challenge.
They rose as well to the
challenge of Rossini's music and
the spirit of the age of bel canto
singing, which requires cascades of
turns, trills, leaps, cascading
roulades—in short, anything a
singer has the mind and the agility
to do. The presence of Conductor
Charles Mackerras—who is known
for his interest in vocal
ornamentation—was obviously felt
in the intelligent vocal decoration
which was consistently present.
Marvelous Mezzo
Teresa Berganza compounded
her success last season in The
Barber of Seville with her
portrayal of Cinderella. She has a
most ingratiating mezzo voice,
and it will do anything she wishes
in the way of acrobatics—as she

demonstrated to a bedazzl d
audience. Miss Berganza is a
welcome relief from the thin,
tippy-toe shrillness which one
normally associates with Rossini's
warbling heroines.
The Don Magnifico of Paolo
Montarsolo was one of unabated
vigor and hardcore tomfooluy.
His bass voice is not so much
powerful as insinuating, and he
did not allow it once to remind us
that he was a singer instead of a
doddery old rascal.
Pietro Bottazzo was just right
as the Prince, cutting a rather
witless and voluble figure. H< has
an extremely thin tenor,
which—since Bottazzo is a big
man—had its special humor. Still,
he attacked the Rossini vocal line
with the supple bumptiousm
that made him an enjoyable part
of the ensemble.
Comic Itasso
By all odds the most elej/ant
singing and wittiest stage presence
of the evening was achieved b>
Renato Capecchi. As the Priii' e's
valet (but actually he pretends to
be the Prince for two acts), he was
the epitome of noblesse oblige
arrogance. Capecchi is a master of
the minute. The flick of his wrist
is eloquent, and one of his arch
leers with eyes askew is worth a
few chapters at least. And he • mg
his part(a few of his arias are
almost cadenzas) with a kind of
agility and tactfulness not
available to ordinary bassos.
Sheila Marks and Sona Cervena,
as the two termagant stepsisters of
Cinderella, performed
admirably—although Pon nolle
perhaps lavished too much
business upon them; and Clifford
Grant sang very well as the sin: ■! r
master-of-ceremonies.
One viewing of this production
hardly does it justice, though the
first time is doubtless the
charmer. It is this season's jewel
and should be missed by only the
most impervious cynics.

repeated November I 1 and 10.)

repeated November I 1 and 10.)

Once upon a time they gave an
opera. All the singers sang
superbly and even acted their
parts as well. Everyone —down to
the last straggling
chorister—seemed to be alive in
the little world on stage. The
orchestra showed a sprightly
interest in the music it was
making. The setting was an
aesthetic whole; the stage
direction, a tour de force of great
genius, was perfect from its

choreography to the slightest
finger-tip mannerisms. And the
audience lived happily ever after.
No fairy tale this; it is actually
happening in the S.F. Opera's
premiere production of Rossini's
version of the Cinderella story, La
Cenerentola. The production,
indeed, leaves the company's
previous standards of excellence
in comic opera in shambles.
Pleasant memories are now mere
shards, and (with improvement
upon the sublime impossible) the
future is a bleak, downhill
prospect.
But the joy of a fairy tale is in
the moment, and Cenerentola is at
this moment as joyful affair as one
could possibly conjure. Though
Rossini's version omits a few
things which will shatter an
English-speaking audience (no
glass slipper, pumpkin, or fuiry
godmother), some amusing Italian
comic traditions have been added.
There is the paternal buffoon Don
Magnifico and a Prince and his
know-it-all valet (shades of
Figaro!) who are of course
disguised as each other.
Madcap Cast
Appropriately, the Opera has
engaged a madcap condottierie of
Italians for this production. They
pillage shamelessly, though
artfully, for laughter, and they
make the most monstrous
pratfalling, the most attenuated

grasps at humor, seem extremely
amusing.
Unquestionably, I think, the
success of this production is duev
to Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, who
designed all the sets and,
unusually, who was also the stage
director. An American debut
could hardly have been more
auspicious. It would be laborious,
if not impossible, to catalogue the
instances of both large-scale
inspiration and clever, off-the-cuff
minutiae which Mr. Ponnelle has
lent to his Cenerentola.
His sets capture the disparate
elements of the opera—the vein of
shabby Italian society, the madly
eccentric airs of the characters,
and the preposterousness of the
fairytale lore which pokes in and
out of the plot. In short, Ponnelle
has extended the wit and wryness
of the opera into the very walls
an furnishings of the
dollhouse—like sets where the
story unfolds. A refreshing twist
in this era of darksome and
symbolic stage design!
Inventive Genius
The sets alone would have
assured Ponnelle's domination.
His stage direction was astonishing
in its own right. Not only did he
sustain a blend of sheer comic
loquacity, but he also achieved a
kind of stylization of movement
and mannerism which heightened
the fairytale essence of the opera.
Incredibly, Ponnelle went

further and displayed a keen
affinity to Rossini's musical
idiom. He knows what to do with
the crescendo-diminuendo which
is ever-present. His spcx>f of
Rossini's delectably interminable
finales (at the end of Act II
everyone is on stage before a
sumptuous dinner table and all are
dying to start eating) is one lone
example of Ponnelle's honest
rapDort with Rossini.
Of course, no director could
have succeeded without singers
intelligent and fluid enough to
make the stage-business come
alive. The cast rose as one to the
challenge.
They rose as well to the
challenge of Rossini's music and
the spirit of the age of bel canto
singing, which requires cascades of
turns, trills, leaps, cascading
roulades—in short, anything a
singer has the mind and the agility
to do. The presence of Conductor
Charles Mackerras—who is known
for his interest in vocal
ornamentation—was obviously felt
in the intelligent vocal decoration
which was consistently present.
Marvelous Mezzo
Teresa Berganza compounded
her success last season in The
Barber of Seville with her
portrayal of Cinderella. She has a
most ingratiating mezzo voice,
and it will do anything she wishes
in the way of acrobatics—as she

demonstrated to a bedazzl d
audience. Miss Berganza is a
welcome relief from the thin,
tippy-toe shrillness which one
normally associates with Rossini's
warbling heroines.
The Don Magnifico of Paolo
Montarsolo was one of unabated
vigor and hardcore tomfooluy.
His bass voice is not so much
powerful as insinuating, and he
did not allow it once to remind us
that he was a singer instead of a
doddery old rascal.
Pietro Bottazzo was just right
as the Prince, cutting a rather
witless and voluble figure. H< has
an extremely thin tenor,
which—since Bottazzo is a big
man—had its special humor. Still,
he attacked the Rossini vocal line
with the supple bumptiousm
that made him an enjoyable part
of the ensemble.
Comic Itasso
By all odds the most elej/ant
singing and wittiest stage presence
of the evening was achieved b>
Renato Capecchi. As the Priii' e's
valet (but actually he pretends to
be the Prince for two acts), he was
the epitome of noblesse oblige
arrogance. Capecchi is a master of
the minute. The flick of his wrist
is eloquent, and one of his arch
leers with eyes askew is worth a
few chapters at least. And he • mg
his part(a few of his arias are
almost cadenzas) with a kind of
agility and tactfulness not
available to ordinary bassos.
Sheila Marks and Sona Cervena,
as the two termagant stepsisters of
Cinderella, performed
admirably—although Pon nolle
perhaps lavished too much
business upon them; and Clifford
Grant sang very well as the sin: ■! r
master-of-ceremonies.
One viewing of this production
hardly does it justice, though the
first time is doubtless the
charmer. It is this season's jewel
and should be missed by only the
most impervious cynics.

Once upon a time they gave an
opera. All the singers sang
superbly and even acted their
parts as well. Everyone —down to
the last straggling
chorister—seemed to be alive in
the little world on stage. The
orchestra showed a sprightly
interest in the music it was
making. The setting was an
aesthetic whole; the stage
direction, a tour de force of great
genius, was perfect from its

choreography to the slightest
finger-tip mannerisms. And the
audience lived happily ever after.
No fairy tale this; it is actually
happening in the S.F. Opera's
premiere production of Rossini's
version of the Cinderella story, La
Cenerentola. The production,
indeed, leaves the company's
previous standards of excellence
in comic opera in shambles.
Pleasant memories are now mere
shards, and (with improvement
upon the sublime impossible) the
future is a bleak, downhill
prospect.
But the joy of a fairy tale is in
the moment, and Cenerentola is at
this moment as joyful affair as one
could possibly conjure. Though
Rossini's version omits a few
things which will shatter an
English-speaking audience (no
glass slipper, pumpkin, or fuiry
godmother), some amusing Italian
comic traditions have been added.
There is the paternal buffoon Don
Magnifico and a Prince and his
know-it-all valet (shades of
Figaro!) who are of course
disguised as each other.
Madcap Cast
Appropriately, the Opera has
engaged a madcap condottierie of
Italians for this production. They
pillage shamelessly, though
artfully, for laughter, and they
make the most monstrous
pratfalling, the most attenuated

grasps at humor, seem extremely
amusing.
Unquestionably, I think, the
success of this production is duev
to Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, who
designed all the sets and,
unusually, who was also the stage
director. An American debut
could hardly have been more
auspicious. It would be laborious,
if not impossible, to catalogue the
instances of both large-scale
inspiration and clever, off-the-cuff
minutiae which Mr. Ponnelle has
lent to his Cenerentola.
His sets capture the disparate
elements of the opera—the vein of
shabby Italian society, the madly
eccentric airs of the characters,
and the preposterousness of the
fairytale lore which pokes in and
out of the plot. In short, Ponnelle
has extended the wit and wryness
of the opera into the very walls
an furnishings of the
dollhouse—like sets where the
story unfolds. A refreshing twist
in this era of darksome and
symbolic stage design!
Inventive Genius
The sets alone would have
assured Ponnelle's domination.
His stage direction was astonishing
in its own right. Not only did he
sustain a blend of sheer comic
loquacity, but he also achieved a
kind of stylization of movement
and mannerism which heightened
the fairytale essence of the opera.
Incredibly, Ponnelle went

further and displayed a keen
affinity to Rossini's musical
idiom. He knows what to do with
the crescendo-diminuendo which
is ever-present. His spcx>f of
Rossini's delectably interminable
finales (at the end of Act II
everyone is on stage before a
sumptuous dinner table and all are
dying to start eating) is one lone
example of Ponnelle's honest
rapDort with Rossini.
Of course, no director could
have succeeded without singers
intelligent and fluid enough to
make the stage-business come
alive. The cast rose as one to the
challenge.
They rose as well to the
challenge of Rossini's music and
the spirit of the age of bel canto
singing, which requires cascades of
turns, trills, leaps, cascading
roulades—in short, anything a
singer has the mind and the agility
to do. The presence of Conductor
Charles Mackerras—who is known
for his interest in vocal
ornamentation—was obviously felt
in the intelligent vocal decoration
which was consistently present.
Marvelous Mezzo
Teresa Berganza compounded
her success last season in The
Barber of Seville with her
portrayal of Cinderella. She has a
most ingratiating mezzo voice,
and it will do anything she wishes
in the way of acrobatics—as she

demonstrated to a bedazzl d
audience. Miss Berganza is a
welcome relief from the thin,
tippy-toe shrillness which one
normally associates with Rossini's
warbling heroines.
The Don Magnifico of Paolo
Montarsolo was one of unabated
vigor and hardcore tomfooluy.
His bass voice is not so much
powerful as insinuating, and he
did not allow it once to remind us
that he was a singer instead of a
doddery old rascal.
Pietro Bottazzo was just right
as the Prince, cutting a rather
witless and voluble figure. H< has
an extremely thin tenor,
which—since Bottazzo is a big
man—had its special humor. Still,
he attacked the Rossini vocal line
with the supple bumptiousm
that made him an enjoyable part
of the ensemble.
Comic Itasso
By all odds the most elej/ant
singing and wittiest stage presence
of the evening was achieved b>
Renato Capecchi. As the Priii' e's
valet (but actually he pretends to
be the Prince for two acts), he was
the epitome of noblesse oblige
arrogance. Capecchi is a master of
the minute. The flick of his wrist
is eloquent, and one of his arch
leers with eyes askew is worth a
few chapters at least. And he • mg
his part(a few of his arias are
almost cadenzas) with a kind of
agility and tactfulness not
available to ordinary bassos.
Sheila Marks and Sona Cervena,
as the two termagant stepsisters of
Cinderella, performed
admirably—although Pon nolle
perhaps lavished too much
business upon them; and Clifford
Grant sang very well as the sin: ■! r
master-of-ceremonies.
One viewing of this production
hardly does it justice, though the
first time is doubtless the
charmer. It is this season's jewel
and should be missed by only the
most impervious cynics.
