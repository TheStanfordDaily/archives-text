# Love, Courtship A Magnetic Force
## 
### 
Love.
Technology.
Hard to make a connection,
isn't it?
Nevertheless, the latest love
machine to appear in the area is a
product of modern technology.
Professor Leonard Macpherson, a
new researcher in the
Psycho-physiological laboratory,
has invented a model of mechanical
love.
The contraption, called
'courtship,' consists of two
magnetic figures delicately
balanced on a low-friction bearing.
When energized, by a push or a
breath, the doohicky performs,
repelling, attracting, accelerating,
decelerating.
The makers and publicizers of
the gadget have decided that the
magnetically mechanical
movements have some similarity to
the behavior of human
couples—and the comparison is not
too far off.
3 Requirements Satisfied
Macpherson believes his device
satisfies three basic requirements:
First, providing an aesthetically
interesting window through which
the world can see a scientific
phenomenon; second, closing the
gap between the device and the
observer, so that he must get it to
respond, and third, having the
gadget easily reproducible, so it
isn't a museum piece.
Macpherson's research in
Phycho-Physiology deals with the
development of electronic

instrumentation and computer
programs for investigation into
invoked brain potential in humans.
A native Englishman,
Macpherson has been a registered
immigrant in the U.S. since
February, 1966.
There are unconfirmed rumors
flying around that he's sending his
next invention to Cowell Health
Center. Sources say that it could
either be called "The Latest,
Magnetized Pill,' or 'Courtship
(Mauve).'
