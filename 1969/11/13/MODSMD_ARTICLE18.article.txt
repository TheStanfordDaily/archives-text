# A 						Busy Afternoon
## The 						Confrontation 
### 
Saturday afternoon may see the
greatest outpouring of human
emotion that this nation has ever
seen. Hugh marches in San
Francisco, Washington, D.C., and
other major cities climax the
second Moratorium.
The numbers are bound to be
large, the cause obviously
important, and the sentiment
genuinely sincere. There is also the
threat of violence.
On the Stanford campus,
another event will be taking place
at the same time. It may not be as
important or unique as a war
Moratorium, but it is probably as
emotional and exciting to some
people.
And if violence is what you are
looking for, this event is a sure
thing.
It is a confrontation. And there
is no doubt—the military will be
ready for a fight.
Uniformed cadets will be all
over the campus, and Ronald
Ueagan won't have had anything to
do with it.
The event is a football game,
the the only marching that fans
inside Stanford Stadium will see is
at halftime. Leafleting will consist
only of selling programs.
A crowd of 40,000 is expected
for Saturday's contest between
1 2th ranked Stanford and the 20th
ranked Air Force Academy. It is a
relatively small number for a top
intersect ional contest, and
Moratorium activities will
assuredly cut the attendance down.
Those that do show up for the
game will see one of the best battles
of an already too exciting year. The
Air Force is an explosive passing
team much like the Indians.
The Falcons feature junior
flanker Ernie Jennings who last
week tied an NCAA record,
catching five touchdown passes.

Air Force is 6-2 on the season,
having lost only to Missouri
(19-17),and Wyoming (27-25).
The football program at the
service institute has come back
strongly under Coach Ben Martin.
The Falcons were hurt by the huge
cheating scandal a few years back
that expelled a number of cadets.
The only common opponent
for the two teams is Oregon whom
Stanford beat, 28-0, and Air Force
clobbered, 60-13.
The injury problem which
always plagues football teams at
one time or another has finally
gotten to the Tribe. Dennis Moore
has seen his last action for the year.
He is out with serious knee
troubles, and was operated on
earlier this week.
Dave Grossi who was hurt in he
car accident is also out with a knee,
and the garbage truck probably
finished him for the vear.

Moratorium activities will
assuredly cut the attendance down.
Those that do show up for the
game will see one of the best battles
of an already too exciting year. The
Air Force is an explosive passing
team much like the Indians.
The Falcons feature junior
flanker Ernie Jennings who last
week tied an NCAA record,
catching five touchdown passes.

Air Force is 6-2 on the season,
having lost only to Missouri
(19-17),and Wyoming (27-25).
The football program at the
service institute has come back
strongly under Coach Ben Martin.
The Falcons were hurt by the huge
cheating scandal a few years back
that expelled a number of cadets.
The only common opponent
for the two teams is Oregon whom
Stanford beat, 28-0, and Air Force
clobbered, 60-13.
The injury problem which
always plagues football teams at
one time or another has finally
gotten to the Tribe. Dennis Moore
has seen his last action for the year.
He is out with serious knee
troubles, and was operated on
earlier this week.
Dave Grossi who was hurt in he
car accident is also out with a knee,
and the garbage truck probably
finished him for the vear.
Saturday afternoon may see the
greatest outpouring of human
emotion that this nation has ever
seen. Hugh marches in San
Francisco, Washington, D.C., and
other major cities climax the
second Moratorium.
The numbers are bound to be
large, the cause obviously
important, and the sentiment
genuinely sincere. There is also the
threat of violence.
On the Stanford campus,
another event will be taking place
at the same time. It may not be as
important or unique as a war
Moratorium, but it is probably as
emotional and exciting to some
people.
And if violence is what you are
looking for, this event is a sure
thing.
It is a confrontation. And there
is no doubt—the military will be
ready for a fight.
Uniformed cadets will be all
over the campus, and Ronald
Ueagan won't have had anything to
do with it.
The event is a football game,
the the only marching that fans
inside Stanford Stadium will see is
at halftime. Leafleting will consist
only of selling programs.
A crowd of 40,000 is expected
for Saturday's contest between
1 2th ranked Stanford and the 20th
ranked Air Force Academy. It is a
relatively small number for a top
intersect ional contest, and
Moratorium activities will
assuredly cut the attendance down.
