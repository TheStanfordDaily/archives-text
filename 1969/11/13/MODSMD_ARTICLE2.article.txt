# Moratorium: Marches And Troops
## S.F. Rally Leads Local Activities 
### FRANK MILLER 
Bay Area Moratorium activities
begin today with picketing,
business canvassing, leafleting, and
a faculty and staff "witness" on
the Stanford campus.
The second of a series of
protests demanding the immediate
withdrawal of all American troops
from Vietnam, the November
Moratorium will intensify with
student strikes, marches, and
canvassing tomorrow and
culminate with a massive anti-war
march in San Francisco on
Saturday.
Stanford activities today
include picketing at the South
Vietnamese consulate in San
Francisco—cars are leaving from
the 1-Center this morning
canvassing and leafleting of
businesses, and a Faculty-Staff
Witness at noon in White Plaza.
The United Stanford
Employees, a newly formed staff
organization, issued a statement
last night defending "the right of
the employees to be free to
express their views without
fearing for their jobs."
200 Faculty
The Witness will have over 200
faculty and staff introducing
themselves and declare their
support of the Moratorium.
About ten will make short
speeches. According to Sociology
Professor Sanford Dornbusch,
organizer of the program, some of
the speeches will be "very
dramatic."
In a related event, the first
direct attack on the constitutional
legality of the Vietnam war is
being planned by several Stanford
professors and a San Jose
attorney.
At least 11 professors, led by
Pierre Noyes of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center have
volunteered to be plaintiffs in a
taxpayers' suit against the war.

San Jose Attorney John Thome
explained that the war would be
attacked on two bases. "First is
that the war is unconstitutional
because no declaration of war has
ever been made by Congress or
the President. The second
approach is based on violation of
the provisions of international law
on when a nation can participate
in war."
The suit faces, when it is filed
this month or early next, the
possibility that the courts will
refuse to hear the case. "The
court's classic answer," says
Thome, "is that this is not a
judicial matter, but a political
question."
The decision of any lower court
is likely to be appealed to the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
and then the Federal Supreme
Court.
San Francisco March
Moratorium activities center on
Saturday's massive march in San
Francisco. Similar to the
Washington, D.C. march, the
demonstration will assemble at 8
a.m. at the Embarcadero and
proceed several miles to the Polo
Fields in Golden Gate Park, being
joined along the route by several
groups from Bay areas.
The march will culminate with
a series of speakers at a Polo
Grounds rally at 2 p.m. Those
scheduled to address the crowd
include: Wayne Morse; Reverand
Ralph Abemathy; Dan Siegal,
University of California at
Berkeley student body president;
and others.
A crowd of about 200,000 is
anticipated by the march
organizers, the New Mobilization
Committee.
Six Demands
The march and rally according
to New Mobilization press releases
are organized around six
demands: immediate and total

withdrawal from Vietnam;
self-determination for Vietnam
and black America; stopping
political repression and freeing all
political prisoners; ending the
development of the anti-ballistic
missile system, ending racism and
poverty; and allowing free speech
for Armed Services personnel.
Stanford participaters in the
Moratorium will likewise sponsor
an anti-war march Friday.
Organizers are expecting more
than 4000 people to march
through the Stanford Industrial
Park, passing directly in front of a
major portion of the industries.
John Kramer, leader of the
Stanford Moratorium activities
has announced the goal of the
activities: "We're going to cut into
the base of President Nixon's
so-called silent majority and build
a majority for immediate
withdrawal from Vietnam that
will not be silent."
Slii<l <*iil Strike
Students have been urged by
Moratorium leaders to support a
national student strike on Friday
against the war. There will be
picketing of classes, interlaced
with entertainment from guerrilla
theater groups; informal
discussion groups including

faculty and students in Tresidder;
and a brief rally at 10:30 a.m. to
bring students together. Students
will then join the march on the
Industrial Park.

donations received will be given to
the Moratorium Committee.
Pressure is being placed on the
Santa Clara County businesses to
express their views on Vietnam
and to let their employees do
likewise. Over 2,000 businessmen
received letters today asking them
to allow individuals to express
their political views without fear
of reprisal. The Bank of America
has agreed to allow employees to
participate in Moratorium
activities on Friday without
penalty.

the Moratorium Committee.
Pressure is being placed on the
Santa Clara County businesses to
express their views on Vietnam
and to let their employees do
likewise. Over 2,000 businessmen
received letters today asking them
to allow individuals to express
their political views without fear
of reprisal. The Bank of America
has agreed to allow employees to
participate in Moratorium
activities on Friday without
penalty.


MORATORIUM HEADQUARTERS—A bigger and more colorful Moratorium
booth on White Plaza was built this week to handle increased business.
Bay Area Moratorium activities
begin today with picketing,
business canvassing, leafleting, and
a faculty and staff "witness" on
the Stanford campus.
The second of a series of
protests demanding the immediate
withdrawal of all American troops
from Vietnam, the November
Moratorium will intensify with
student strikes, marches, and
canvassing tomorrow and
culminate with a massive anti-war
march in San Francisco on
Saturday.
Stanford activities today
include picketing at the South
Vietnamese consulate in San
Francisco—cars are leaving from
the 1-Center this morning
canvassing and leafleting of
businesses, and a Faculty-Staff
Witness at noon in White Plaza.
The United Stanford
Employees, a newly formed staff
organization, issued a statement
last night defending "the right of
the employees to be free to
express their views without
fearing for their jobs."
200 Faculty
The Witness will have over 200
faculty and staff introducing
themselves and declare their
support of the Moratorium.
About ten will make short
speeches. According to Sociology
Professor Sanford Dornbusch,
organizer of the program, some of
the speeches will be "very
dramatic."
In a related event, the first
direct attack on the constitutional
legality of the Vietnam war is
being planned by several Stanford
professors and a San Jose
attorney.
At least 11 professors, led by
Pierre Noyes of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center have
volunteered to be plaintiffs in a
taxpayers' suit against the war.

San Jose Attorney John Thome
explained that the war would be
attacked on two bases. "First is
that the war is unconstitutional
because no declaration of war has
ever been made by Congress or
the President. The second
approach is based on violation of
the provisions of international law
on when a nation can participate
in war."
The suit faces, when it is filed
this month or early next, the
possibility that the courts will
refuse to hear the case. "The
court's classic answer," says
Thome, "is that this is not a
judicial matter, but a political
question."
The decision of any lower court
is likely to be appealed to the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
and then the Federal Supreme
Court.

Canvassing of mid-Peninsula
residences will dominate the
activities of many Moratorium
supporters all day Friday.
A rock concert at Lytton Plaza
in Palo Alto in planned for Friday
night followed by a bread and
wine service and a candlelight
procession to the Memorial
Chapel.
Senior Class Dance
The Senior Class is sponsoring a
special dance in the courtyard of
the Old Union tonight at 8 in
support of (he Moratorium. Any
donations received will be given to
the Moratorium Committee.
Pressure is being placed on the
Santa Clara County businesses to
express their views on Vietnam
and to let their employees do
likewise. Over 2,000 businessmen
received letters today asking them
to allow individuals to express
their political views without fear
of reprisal. The Bank of America
has agreed to allow employees to
participate in Moratorium
activities on Friday without
penalty.


MORATORIUM HEADQUARTERS—A bigger and more colorful Moratorium
booth on White Plaza was built this week to handle increased business.
Bay Area Moratorium activities
begin today with picketing,
business canvassing, leafleting, and
a faculty and staff "witness" on
the Stanford campus.
The second of a series of
protests demanding the immediate
withdrawal of all American troops
from Vietnam, the November
Moratorium will intensify with
student strikes, marches, and
canvassing tomorrow and
culminate with a massive anti-war
march in San Francisco on
Saturday.
Stanford activities today
include picketing at the South
Vietnamese consulate in San
Francisco—cars are leaving from
the 1-Center this morning
canvassing and leafleting of
businesses, and a Faculty-Staff
Witness at noon in White Plaza.
The United Stanford
Employees, a newly formed staff
organization, issued a statement
last night defending "the right of
the employees to be free to
express their views without
fearing for their jobs."
200 Faculty
The Witness will have over 200
faculty and staff introducing
themselves and declare their
support of the Moratorium.
About ten will make short
speeches. According to Sociology
Professor Sanford Dornbusch,
organizer of the program, some of
the speeches will be "very
dramatic."
In a related event, the first
direct attack on the constitutional
legality of the Vietnam war is
being planned by several Stanford
professors and a San Jose
attorney.
At least 11 professors, led by
Pierre Noyes of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center have
volunteered to be plaintiffs in a
taxpayers' suit against the war.

San Jose Attorney John Thome
explained that the war would be
attacked on two bases. "First is
that the war is unconstitutional
because no declaration of war has
ever been made by Congress or
the President. The second
approach is based on violation of
the provisions of international law
on when a nation can participate
in war."
The suit faces, when it is filed
this month or early next, the
possibility that the courts will
refuse to hear the case. "The
court's classic answer," says
Thome, "is that this is not a
judicial matter, but a political
question."
The decision of any lower court
is likely to be appealed to the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
and then the Federal Supreme
Court.
San Francisco March
Moratorium activities center on
Saturday's massive march in San
Francisco. Similar to the
Washington, D.C. march, the
demonstration will assemble at 8
a.m. at the Embarcadero and
proceed several miles to the Polo
Fields in Golden Gate Park, being
joined along the route by several
groups from Bay areas.
The march will culminate with
a series of speakers at a Polo
Grounds rally at 2 p.m. Those
scheduled to address the crowd
include: Wayne Morse; Reverand
Ralph Abemathy; Dan Siegal,
University of California at
Berkeley student body president;
and others.
A crowd of about 200,000 is
anticipated by the march
organizers, the New Mobilization

Six Demands
The march and rally according
to New Mobilization press releases
are organized around six
demands: immediate and total

withdrawal from Vietnam;
self-determination for Vietnam
and black America; stopping
political repression and freeing all
political prisoners; ending the
development of the anti-ballistic
missile system, ending racism and
poverty; and allowing free speech
for Armed Services personnel.
Stanford participaters in the
Moratorium will likewise sponsor
an anti-war march Friday.
Organizers are expecting more
than 4000 people to march
through the Stanford Industrial
Park, passing directly in front of a
major portion of the industries.
John Kramer, leader of the
Stanford Moratorium activities
has announced the goal of the
activities: "We're going to cut into
the base of President Nixon's
so-called silent majority and build
a majority for immediate
withdrawal from Vietnam that
will not be silent."
Slii<l <*iil Strike
Students have been urged by
Moratorium leaders to support a
national student strike on Friday
