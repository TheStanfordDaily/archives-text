# More Disruption

Periodic disruptions stemming
from the "generation gap" may be
anticipated over the next five to
10 years and other social
institutions, a Stanford expert
believes.
Joseph Katz, executive
director of the Institute for the
Study of Human Problems, says
"we may expect an increasing use
of pressure tacticsâ€”civil
disobedience, disruptive
demonstrations, strikes, sit-ins,
and boycotts, as well as continued
assertion of the individual's right
to follow his own conscience if it
conflicts with the mandate of the
state."
He says that the present
movement has spurned prolonged
political organization because of a
new emphasis on individuality,
individual conscience, and the
ideology of non-violence. "It is of
course possible that political
structures will emerge,
particularly if there are prolonged
attempts at political repression."
Satisfaction of economic
desires has led to even greater
expectations, he notes. Where
parents fought economic poverty,
their children turn to problems of
psychological deprivation.
Noting that nine of 10
Stanford seniors now plan further
training, Katz suggests that the
frustration caused by this long
period of career preparation may
be eased by having college and
even high school students make an
active contribution to society
while studying, perhaps by
teaching the lower grades.
