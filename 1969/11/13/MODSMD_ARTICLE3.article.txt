# Troops Prepare For D.C. March
## 
### ED KOHN 
For the second time in less than
a month, anti-war demonstrators
will move into action as the
nationwide November
Moratorium gets underway today.
But the threat of violence hangs
over the planned protests as some
9,000 riot—trained Army troops
have been deployed in Washington
D.C., one of the protest centers.
In Washington, where the first
contingent of the 250,000
marchers expected to participate
in Saturday's March On
Washington started arriving last
night, the New Mobilization
Committee was still working out
logistics for the effort. Part of the
group's confusion arose when the
government delayed granting a
parade permit until late Tuesday
evening.
Final plans for two smaller
protests in the Capital, the "Peace
in the Park" program, being held
in Lafayette Park, two blocks
from the White House, and the
40-hour March Against Death
were completed last night.
The Lafayette Park protest is
slated for lunchtime today, while
the March Against Death, from
Arlington Cemetery to the
Capitol, will start at sundown
tonight and run through Saturday.
Each person participating in the
march will carry the name of a
U.S. Vietnam casualty or the
name of a Vietnamese city that
has been obliterated in the course
of the war.
The first unit of troops to move
into Washington was from the
82nd Airborne Division, a group
that saw action during the march
on the Pentagon in 1967 and the
Detroit summer riots. A
spokesman for the Department of

Defense said that the remainder of
the troops would be positioned
throughout the city by this
morning. He termed the troop
deployment "a precautionary
action only."
In Cities, On Campuses
In the rest of the nation, the
anti-war activities will center in
New York, Detroit and San
Francisco, as well as on the
college campuses. In New York, a
lie-in is planned for Central Park
which organizers hope will attract
4 0,000 protesters. "Town
meetings" and smaller rallies are
also planned.
A draft card turn-in is
scheduled for the University of
Minnesota. At the University of
Denver, protesters have
announced that a Viet Cong flag
will fly beside an American flag
lowered to half staff at noon
Friday.
Opposition
Several groups announced
opposition to the Moratorium
earlier in the week. The V.F.W.,
the American Legion, and the
Disabled American Veterans have
all asked their members to fly
American flags and drive with
their headlights on during the
daylight hours. They have also
urged their members to leave their
porch or apartment lights on all
night to show support for the
President
Earlier this week, Vice
President Agnew denounced the
Moratorium as "a carnival in the
streets." Atty. Gen. John Mitchell
said Tuesday night that "the
foreign policy of this government
cannot and will not be formulated
in the streets of Washington—or in
any other street of this nation."
