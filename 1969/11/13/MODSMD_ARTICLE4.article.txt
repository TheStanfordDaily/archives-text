# University Announces Ban On Mormon Competition
## 
### FRED MANN 
President Kenneth S. Pitzer
announced yesterday that the
University will not participate in
any activity with Brigham Young
University or any other school
sponsored by the Mormon
Church.
The unprecedented move
came in response to
recommendations made last year
by the Human Relations
Commission. The action was
based on policies of racial
discrimination in the Mormon
Church which sponsors BYU.
The decision effects all
intercollegiate aspects of the
university including athletics,
debate, and other forms of
intercollegiate competition.
Pitzer stated, "It is the policy
of Stanford University not to
schedule events with institutions
which practice discrimination on
the basis of race or national
origin, or which are affiliated with
or sponsored by institutions
which do so."
No Right of Priesthood
He explained that "top officials
of the Church of Jesus Christ of
the Latter Day saints, which
sponsors Brigham Young
University, have told Stanford
University officers that the
Church currently has policies
stating that no Negro of African
lineage may have the right of
priesthood.
"So long as this policy remains
in effect, it is my opinion that it
constitutes discrimination on the
basis of race within the meaning
of the guidelines established by
the Human Relations
Commission."
Special Assistant to the
President Bill Wyman called the
policy "a big step."
Co m rn issio n R ecom rn end at ions
"We have adopted the
recommendations of the
Commission with very minor
changes," he said. "If any
questions arise as to whether a
university is a discriminatory
institution, we will investigate
right away. The Commission will
be in charge of that."
The Human Rights
Commission, headed by Law
School Professor Byron Sher,
submitted their recommendations
last spring. The long delay in
implementing the ideas was
caused by members' absences
during the summer.
Last January, Pitzer announced
that the Athletic Department
would not field teams against
schools that practice racial
discrimination. The decision was

made at the time of a two-game
basketball series with BYU.
Contractual Coimnitment
Yesterday's statement was the
first naming any particular school
that Stanford will not play.
Presently, the University has a
contractual commitment to two
more basketball games with BYU
in December, 1970. These will be
played as scheduled.
Pitzer emphasized in his
announcement that the
Commission was not asked to
assess whether or not
discrimination was practiced on
the BYU campus itself. The
University presently has three
black students among its current
enrollement of 25,000.
Prospective Schedules
In the future, the Athletic
Department will be asked to
submit a list of prospective
schedules to the Commission for
judgment. A final decision on all
schools will be made by the
President.
Leo Bazile, Chairman of the
BSU, showed disinterest in the
announcement. "What can I say
about Pitzer's statement?" he
smiled. "It was agreed last year
that Stanford would stop things
with Mormon schools. If it
doesn't stop nowâ€”then we'll talk
about Pitzer's statement."
The Athletic Department
accepted the decision. "It's
University policy," remarked
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor,
"and we're part of the University.
It doesn't affect us all that
much."
Maples Opening
Varsity basketball coach Howie
Dallmar had no comment on the
new policy, but recalled the
problem he encountered last year
when Stanford opened in the
Maples Pavilion against BYU.
"I told Don Griffin and Bill
Barber, the two blacks on our
team, that they did not have to
play in the games if they felt that
they shouldn't.
"They decided to play, and
Griffin scored 52 points."
Brigham Young is not the only
Mormon school to figure in
Stanford's athletic future. The
Church College of Hawaii rugby
team, making a tour of the West
Coast, wrote to Stanford coach
Pete Kmetovic requesting a game
for this year.
University Announcement
The contest fell through
However, before the University
announcement that it would be
illegal.
The question of discrimination
at BYU has become a big one at

many campuses this year. On
October 17, 14 University of
Wyoming black football players
walked into Coach Lloyd Eaton's
office to discuss the upcoming
Wyoming-BYU game with him.
They all wore black armbands.
14 Kicked Oil Team
After an hour, all 14 were off
the team. Eaton has a team rule
denying players participation in
student protests, and the
armbands were considered part of
the protest.
The players now have a suit
filed in court against the

university. Since their dismissal,
Wyoming has dropped from the
top ten rankings, and has lost
their first games of the year.
San Jose State also entered into
the protest against BYU with the
entire football team wearing
armbands to their contest.
Biology Professor Donald
Kennedy, a member of the
Human Relations Commission
when the recommendations were
made last year, stated he was "not
surprised" at Pitzer's move against
Mormon policy.
