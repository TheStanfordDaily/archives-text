# Cowell Director: Relax Pill Ban
## 
### 
Dr. James McClenahan, director
of the Cowell Health Center said
Tuesday he felt present University
policies barring the prescription of
contraceptive medications or
devices to unmarried students
"probably should be changed."
His opinions were made known
publicly following the Daily's
disclosure that a change is under
consideration by the University.
President Kenneth S. Pitzer had
no immediate comment.
Dean of Students Peter
Bulkeley said he personally
believes decisions in these matters
should be made only in
consultation with competent
physicians, who should take into
account the entire fabric of an
individual's background, including
his family, his culture, and his
previous medical history.
"I do not favor blanket
prescriptions or prohibition," he
said.
Planned Parenthood
At present, staff physicians
prescribe contraceptives only to
students who are married or
anticipate marriage in the
immediate future.
However, doctors at the Center
will refer students to private
physicians or community clinics,
like Planned Parenthood.
McClenahan believes that this
service "ought to be handled just
like the rest of medical care," in
response to individual requests
and need.
"There are reservations about
the pill," he said. "Not everyone
should have it. We need to make
sure its use is properly evaluated
for each patient."
The present policy raises the
possibility that students may not
receive the best possible care

through misinformation,
inconvenience, financial
considerations, or lack of
understanding of the medical
history of each individual, he
added.
A growing segment of
physicians in the community
would agree that contraceptive
counseling and prescriptions
constitute proper medical care for
college-age youth, whether or not
they are actually enrolled in
universities, Dr. McClenahan
stated.
