# Committee For Volunteer Army
## 
### 
America should end
conscription and return to its long
tradition of voluntary military
service, a broadly based
committee of students, faculty
and administrators believes.
In a unanimous report to
President Pitzer, the 14-man
group warned that conscription
''dangerously distorts"
constitutional checks and balances
on foreign policy formulation,
"makes more likely the continued
growth and influence of the
military establishment," and
imposes a hidden tax on "a small
and relatively poor segment of our
society" in low military wages.
Headed by Prof. Alan B.
Coleman of the Graduate School
of Business, the committee
appointed by Pitzer in March, said
changes in Selective Service
sought by President Nixon
"would remove some of the
unfairness and uncertainty" of the
present system, if enacted by
Congress.
Inherent Defects
But it emphasized that "there
are inherent defects in any system
of selective, conscriptive military
service which are acceptable only
under conditions of extreme
national emergency" such as
World War 11.
In a letter to Coleman, Pitzer
said he personally agrees with the
central conclusion of the report
and intends to work as an
individual in seeking change along
the lines it recommends.
One Generation of Conscription
The committee's report noted:
"The fact that the U.S. has
accepted military conscription for
over a generation, long after its
original justification has
disappeared, now places our
country dangerously close to
accepting compulsory military
duty as a consistent and
continuing part of our tradition."
Changing to a volunteer army
would have substantial positive
effects throughout society, the
committee suggested: "It would
give new individual flexibility to
thousands who are in college now
partially for draft avoidance
purposes or who have been
channeled into occupations in
which they would not be engaged
were it not for the draft."

accepting compulsory military
duty as a consistent and
continuing part of our tradition."
Changing to a volunteer army
would have substantial positive
effects throughout society, the
committee suggested: "It would
give new individual flexibility to
thousands who are in college now
partially for draft avoidance
purposes or who have been
channeled into occupations in
which they would not be engaged
were it not for the draft."
