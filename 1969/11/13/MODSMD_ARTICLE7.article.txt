# Salaries Revealed
## 
### 
i Despite consistent and veiled
threats of legal action, the Daily
( has decided to publish
controversial and secret salary
figures. Daily editor Mark
Weinberger commented, "I would
, like a more informed debate than
the hit-or-miss discussion that is
going on right now."
After a careful consideration of
all factors in the balance, the
entire Daily staff agreed at a
meeting Monday that the only
moral and ethical course was to
print the information listed
below.
The newspaper decided to take
the unprecedented step of
revealing the secret figures despite
repeated threats of lawsuits for
invasion of privacy. "We must
resist the forces of repression and
latent fascism," commented
staffer Michael Kuhl.
Distribution of the figures
represents the most extensive and

potentially explosive revelation of
internal University workings since
the famous bush urination scandal
over sixty years ago (several
students were suspended after
befouling the President's
shrubbery outside his residence).
A documented analysis of the
salary data conclusively proves
many covert suspicions regarding
the heavy financial bias toward
technical personnel.
Science-oriented staff
members receive by far the largest
salaries. In one case the top
technocrat earned twice as much
as the best-paid editorial
employee.
The oft-cited maxim "Publish
or Perish" remains well borne out
by the salary evidence. The
paucity of salaried personnel who
have not published recently
speaks for itself.
Bureaucrats are among the

best paid workers, while the
masses are regularlv starved.

Bonzon refused to join the move £

"I don't see any. need; there's no £
reason for it," Bonzon claimed.
i Despite consistent and veiled
threats of legal action, the Daily
( has decided to publish
controversial and secret salary
figures. Daily editor Mark
Weinberger commented, "I would
, like a more informed debate than
the hit-or-miss discussion that is
going on right now."
After a careful consideration of
all factors in the balance, the
entire Daily staff agreed at a
meeting Monday that the only
moral and ethical course was to
print the information listed
below.
The newspaper decided to take
the unprecedented step of
revealing the secret figures despite
repeated threats of lawsuits for
invasion of privacy. "We must
resist the forces of repression and
latent fascism," commented
staffer Michael Kuhl.
Distribution of the figures
represents the most extensive and

potentially explosive revelation of
internal University workings since
the famous bush urination scandal
over sixty years ago (several
students were suspended after
befouling the President's
shrubbery outside his residence).
A documented analysis of the
salary data conclusively proves
many covert suspicions regarding
the heavy financial bias toward
technical personnel.
Science-oriented staff
members receive by far the largest
salaries. In one case the top
technocrat earned twice as much
as the best-paid editorial
employee.
The oft-cited maxim "Publish
or Perish" remains well borne out
by the salary evidence. The
paucity of salaried personnel who
have not published recently
speaks for itself.
Bureaucrats are among the

best paid workers, while the
masses are regularlv starved.
