# Silent Majority
## Bloodless Withdrawal 
### Dan Bernstein 
It has now been a week since
President Nixon addressed the
nation about the future course
America will take in Vietnam.
Since that time, tens of thousands
of telegrams have poured into the
White House, the multitude of
them coming from the "silent
majority" and expressing support
for Mr. Nixon's policy. After
careful analysis of this recent White
House mail, it can be reported what
the exact sentiment of this silent
majority is.
First of all, it is quite clear that
all members of the silent majority
favor a withdrawal of American
troops from South Vietnam. They
distinguish their stand from the
vocal minority in that not only
does the silent majority prefer a
withdrawal, they prefer a silent
withdrawal. This is a phenomenon
that the Nixon Administration was
totally unaware of until late Nov.

The reasoning behind the silent
withdrawal is, in the words of one
of the more outspoken members of
the silent majority, "We could
avoid a blood bath in Vietnam if we
withdrew so quietly that the North
Vietnamese didn't know we were
gone." This made good sense to the
Nixon Administration, but several
problems immediately came to
light.
The main obstacle to this plan
was that withdrawal of front line
troops could not fool the Viet
Cong for long. As one Nixon
official put it, "If the VC didn't see
soldiers in the foxholes on the
front line, it wouldn't take them
long to realize that the foxholes
were empty."
Likelife Dummies
But this problem was readily
dismissed by the majority of the
silent majority who insisted that
lifelike dummies could be used as
replacements, and with the low

level of fighting, the Viet Cong
wouldn't catch on for months. Top
administrative aides conceded the
possibility of such a step, but
indicated that they felt that most
Pentagon officials would be
reluctant to leave their Washington
posts.
The silent majority's plan was
further criticized by top Nixon
advisors because if a policy to keep
troop withdrawal secret from the
Viet Cong was initiated, the
nation's college campuses would
also have to be ignorant of the fact.
The reason for this is that if the
college youths saw that troops
were being withdrawn,
demonstrations would cease, and
the Viet Cong and North Vietnam
would become suspicious thinking
that somehow President Nixon was
appeasing the dissidents.
Consequently they would look
harder at the front lines, and no
matter how convincing the
dummies were, U.S. troop
withdrawal would become
immediately obvious.
Bare Minimum
Not to be silenced, the silent
majority granted the dilemma, but
suggested that upon returning to
the United States, all but the bare
minimum of soldiers necessary to
maintain U.S. bases be released
from further active duty, providing
they took advantage of the G.I.
Bill, went back to college, and
became anti-war activists.
That way, the silent majority
reasoned, the influx of political
activists would be welcomed by
campus radicals, demonstrations
would increase, and North
Vietnam would be content to
conclude that President Nixon was
still far from any sort of concensus
at heme, let alone a peace
settlement in Vietnam.
Meanwhile, President Nixon
would know that all the troops had
been withdrawn, and that the New
Left had become even newer by
virtue of the infiltration of
thousands of military-trained
pseudo-activists.
