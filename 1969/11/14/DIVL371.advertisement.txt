ME V U Â° SUNDAY FLICKS
Elvira Madigan
As beautifully saccharine cs Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and,
at times, as syrupy and nostalgically maudlin as the Bee Gees,
Bo Widerberg s lushly pretty love idyl is strictly soft stuff,
not the Zeppelin or the Stones, but a treacly-sweet anodyne
for and escape from all your troubles. Come for pretty.
With Chaplin Short
