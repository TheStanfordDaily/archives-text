# Moratorium Escalates
## Area Protests War 
### 
Stanford Moratorium activities
move into their second day today
with a major effort to generate
enthusiasm for Saturday's mass
anti-war rally in San Francisco.
Yesterday students and local
residents canvassed Santa Clara
County businesses, leafletted in
shopping centers and the Stanford
Industrial Park, and watched
Stanford faculty and staff stage a
quiet witness for peace in White
Plaza (Please turn to page 4 for
related stories.).
A student strike, all-day
canvassing of Mid-Peninsula
neighborhoods and shopping
centers, and a noon rally and
march in the Industrial Park will
highlight today's local
Moratorium activities.
These local activities are part of
a build-up for tomorrow's mass
march and anti-war rally in San
Francisco. As many as a quarter
of a million persons are expected
to take part in Saturday's
demonstration of anti-war
sentiment.
Seven Mile March
Many demonstrators plan to
arrive by bus caravan from
Southern California to participate
in the seven-mile march.
San Francisco Mayor Joseph
Alioto sidestepped endorsement
Wednesday of the planned
demonstrations but proclaimed
that Saturday will be a day of
"thoughtful observation."
The march Saturday will start
on the Embarcadero at 7 a.m. and
conclude at 2 p.m. with a rally at
the Polo Grounds. Speakers will
include Wayne Morse and Ralph
Abernathy.
Stanford activities today will
concentrate on intensified
personal contact with area
residents.
People in areas canvassed
during the October 15
Moratorium activities will be
canvassing themselves, according
to Moratorium organizer John
Kramer.
Noon Rally Today
Areas not reached in October in
San Mateo County will be today's
target for student canvassers.
Kramer declared that there would
probably be fewer people
canvassing than last month. "It is

very difficult and frustrating," he
explained.
Today's Industrial Park rally
will begin at noon on the corner
of Page Mill and Hanover.
Speakers will include Rabbi
Sidney Axelrod, graduate student
Peter Dollinger, and Doug Mattern
of the Palo Alto Concerned
Citizens for Peace.
Following the rally there will
be a march in the Industrial Park.
Kramer predicted that 4,000
would participate in the march.
Last month's anti-war march in
Palo Alto attracted more than
5,000.
Lytton Rock Concert
Tonight at 8 p.m. there will be
a free rock concert at Lytton
Plaza. The concert will be
followed by a religious service
including sharing of bread and
wine, prayers, affirmation and
singing.

The ceremony will culminate in
a candlelight procession to the
First Presbyterian Church where
an ecumenical service will be held.
Palo Alto Mayor Edward
Arnold has issued a statement
assailing the plans for their
"psuedo-religious" quality.
San Francisco Plans
Instead of attending classes,
students at San Francisco State,
the University of San Francisco,
and the San Francisco College for
Women are being urged to
participate in an all-day
Moratorium rally today outside
the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange.
The peace rally will begin today
at 9 a.m. at Pine and Sansome
Streets.
Anti-war speakers will address
the assembly every 30 minutes
and taps will be sounded at 11
a.m. and 3 p.m. to call Financial

District employees to join in a
silent street vigil for peace.
The demonstration will climax
with a procession to Union Square
and Civic Center Plaza for a
candlelight requiem vigil to honor
the Vietnam war dead.
UC Berkeley plans a noon rally,
picket lines and community
leafletting.
A student strike called by the
Student Mobilization Committee
to End the War in Vietnam will
apaprently be more than 50
percent effective in undergraduate
courses at Stanford.
Strike Has Effect
Results of an nformal survey
by the Stanford News Service
yesterday showed that over the
Thursday-Friday Moratorium
period, 57 of the largest
undergraduate courses with a
combined enrollment of 5,700
will meet as scheduled, while 4 2
courses with a normal enrollment
of 6,300 will not.
These figures do not include
expected absentee rates from
courses that will be held. The
News Service reported that
attendance was down about 1/3 in
15 large undergraduate courses
that met yesterday.
Yesterday more than 150
Stanford students and local
residents canvassed Santa Clara
businesses, asking businessmen to
affirm that their employees can
express political views without
fear of reprisal.
Industrial Park Leaflcled
Early yesterday morning about
25 persons leafleted workers
arriving at Stanford Industrial
Park. More than two dozen Palo
Alto police in full r : ct gear
gathered at the intersection of
Page Mill and Hanover, u-it there
were no arrests or incidents.
An estimated 400 students
watched 227 members of the
Stanford faculty and staff stage a


Stanford News Service
SWEET REASON-Two students are shown here trying to persuade a local businessman to either display an anti-war poster
in his window, or to shut down Friday and Saturday . The response was ambivalent on the part of most businessmen.
