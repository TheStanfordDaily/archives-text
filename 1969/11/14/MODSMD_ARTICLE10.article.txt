# Pontius Pilate Complexes
## Blood Is On All Our Hands 
### Larry Diamond 
Thorn spoke of a marine he
knew well who worked at the
Treasure Island military station,
one of three stations in the
country that receives the bodies
from Vietnam. The Treasure
Island station alone often received
as many as IV2 times the number
of bodies that were listed as killed
in combat the week before. And
the other two stations were
simultaneously receiving bodies.
Thus, the bodies being brought
home from Vietnam often ran as
high as 2 or 3 times the number of
Americans on the list of war dead
the week before.
Bomb Now; Explode Later
But the cleverness of the
military machine is exceeded only
by its very basic inhumanity.
Thorn revealed that America has
dropped large numbers of
specially fused bombs that won't
explode for five or ten years. The
rationale behind this is, of course,
that the war is never going to end
so we might as well keep those
bombs exploding.
We are extensively using
anti-personnel fragmentation
bombs, which send hundreds of
pieces of shrapnel flying wildly in
all directions. The only thing this
shrapnel can do effectively is
pierce human flesh.
Another basic bomb is the
2,000 pound napalm bomo, which
can obliterate a large area of
Vietnamese jungle. The jungles in
Vietnam are beautiful, and so are
the people in and around them.
They, many of them women and
children, are also being obliterated
by our napalm bombs.
Viet Cong Heads
Finn as well saw inhumane
activities—whole villages being
burned to the ground by
American flame-throwers and
then mined so the people could
not return.
He saw chlorine gas used to
clear the Viet Cong out of certain
areas. The gas is fatal in small

concentrations, and its use would
seem to constitute a violation of
international and moral law.
When he was fighting near
Pleiku, he saw six Viet Cong heads
laying on a road, severed with
American bayonets. Aces of
spades were pinned on them.
American Mass Murders
"We're not protecting the
Vietnamese," Finn said, "we're
killing them. We often don't
bother to take prisoners, we just
murder them. We have very
probably cut off more enemy
heads than the Communists."
There is no one who can
logically deny the futility of this
war. Thorn worked with one naval
bomber squadron that lost all of
its planes twice and half of its
men in only nine months. Finn
talked of occasions where a
company would lose 70 per cent
of its men trying to take a hill,
only to abandon it the day after
they captured it.
The ,var in Vietnam is not
simply a mistake. It is a crime,
and we are all responsible for it.
Let us remember the words of
Mickey Finn: "I am guilty of
murder every time a man is killed,
as long as my country is a part of
it."
Blood, Blood, Blood
Let us think for a moment of
those Americans who did not
return from the war, and what
comments they would have had
they lived to be released from a
military machine which will allow
no dissent from its soldiers.
Let us wake each morning, as
so many of our Vietnam veterans
inescapably do, to visions of
American boys being killed and
forced to kill for no good reason,
Vietnamese villages and crops
being burned to the ground for no
good reason, innocent Vietnamese
"It is hard for me to function
when I realize what I was a part
of."
The comment came from
former Army sergeant Mickey
Finn, a veteran of the war in
Vietnam. Now bitterly opposed to
the war, and to the nature of the
American military in general, Finn
is working for GI Help in San
Francisco.
What Finn was a part of is a
massive, clever, brutal military
machine that is effectively
perpetuating a foreign policy
which is not only stupid and
misguided, but totally alien to the
concepts on which this country
was founded.
America fought a revolution
200 years ago based on the
concept of self-determination and
imbedded with a deep regard for
human rights. The revolution
brought democracy to America,
or at least some semblance of it.
The English, having a vested
economic interest in the American
colonies, tried to suppress the
revolution and failed.
Ho Endorses Democracy
America has chosen to cast
itself in a role similar to the
English of the 1700's. In Vietnam
(and around the world,
particularly in Latin America) we
are suppressing revolution.
After World War 11, Ho Chi
Minh came to America asking for
support for Vietnamese
independence and presenting a
document strangely similar to our

own Declaration of Independence.
We informed him flatly that the
French were returning and would
have our support. Since then we
have consistently opposed the
nationalist-communist movement
he led. The movement's goal was
independence for all of Vietnam.
Perhaps we had no business
supporting the movement, and the
revolution that ensued, but
neither did we have any right to
suppress it.
We have crucial economic
interests in Vietnam—-vital natural
resources, for instance. The
investments of American
industries in South Vietnam and
all of Southeast Asia are
enormous.
Naive, Stupid, Corrupt
We say we are there to fight for
freedom. Some of us are naive
enough to believe this. A
government that censors the
newspaper, jails its political
opponents, and lives in
magnificent luxury made possible
by its own corruption is not any
symbol of freedom. Thieu and Ky
are dictators. We are fighting to
perpetuate their undemocratic
rule.
Former sergeant Finn has said
that the Vietnamese people see
the conflict as a civil war, not as
an invasion from the North. He
claims that the two factions in
Vietnam are "pro-Western and
anti-Western" and that the
invasion is being carried on by
America.
America is wrong in
Vietnam—wrong not only in its
stupid decision to commit ground
troops to a guerilla war in a
foreign nation, but also in its
decision to intrude in a civil war
to protect its economic and
military interests.
Incredibly Clever Machines
The military machine that is
perpetuating this policy is
incredibly clever. Vietnam veteran
Lee Thorn, a former naval
intelligence officer, has described

a largely unknown policy that the
military has on the listing of
American war deaths.
Thorn said that far more
Americans are dying than we are
told about. To be officially listed
as killed in combat, asolidermust
die on the battlefield. If he dies in
the helicopter or in the hospital,
he is not placed on the list of
Vietnam War dead.
people being fragmentation
-bombed to death for no good
reason, the natural beauty and
richness of Vietnam being
napalmed into oblivion for no
good reason.
Let us, too, scream over
nightmares of 10-year-fuse bombs,
anti-personnel fragmentation
bombs, 2,000 pound napalm
bombs, chlorine gas and tear gas,
severed heads, and severed limbs,
and severed souls, and blood,
blood, blood.
Feel That Guilt
lut us feel the guilt and agony
of these horrors, for all of us who
call ourselves Americans are
responsible for them. We have
allowed it all to happen.
And we must allow it no
longer. We must support the
Vietnam Moratorium and deliver
this one unalterable demand to
the Nixon Administration: STOP.
Stop the American military
machine from extinguishing one
more human life, one more breath
of beauty.
Tomorrow, Lee Thorn, and his
fellow members of the Veterans
for Peace, will be at the front of
the largest peace march in the
history of San Francisco. For as
long as it is necessary, they will be
working to end the war and the
inhumanity of American
militarism.
We all must join them. For the
burden of guilt is on all our
shoulders. The blood is on all our
hands.

militarism.
We all must join them. For the

(Larry Diamond is a freshman

Thorn spoke of a marine he
knew well who worked at the
Treasure Island military station,
one of three stations in the
country that receives the bodies
from Vietnam. The Treasure
Island station alone often received
as many as IV2 times the number
of bodies that were listed as killed
in combat the week before. And
the other two stations were
simultaneously receiving bodies.
Thus, the bodies being brought
home from Vietnam often ran as
high as 2 or 3 times the number of
Americans on the list of war dead
the week before.
Bomb Now; Explode Later
But the cleverness of the
military machine is exceeded only
by its very basic inhumanity.
Thorn revealed that America has
dropped large numbers of
specially fused bombs that won't
explode for five or ten years. The
rationale behind this is, of course,
that the war is never going to end
so we might as well keep those
bombs exploding.
We are extensively using
anti-personnel fragmentation
bombs, which send hundreds of
pieces of shrapnel flying wildly in
all directions. The only thing this
shrapnel can do effectively is
pierce human flesh.
Another basic bomb is the
2,000 pound napalm bomo, which
can obliterate a large area of
Vietnamese jungle. The jungles in
Vietnam are beautiful, and so are
the people in and around them.
They, many of them women and
children, are also being obliterated
by our napalm bombs.
Viet Cong Heads
Finn as well saw inhumane
activities—whole villages being
burned to the ground by
American flame-throwers and
then mined so the people could
not return.
He saw chlorine gas used to
clear the Viet Cong out of certain
areas. The gas is fatal in small

concentrations, and its use would
seem to constitute a violation of
international and moral law.
When he was fighting near
Pleiku, he saw six Viet Cong heads
laying on a road, severed with
American bayonets. Aces of
spades were pinned on them.
American Mass Murders
"We're not protecting the
Vietnamese," Finn said, "we're
killing them. We often don't
bother to take prisoners, we just
murder them. We have very
probably cut off more enemy
heads than the Communists."
There is no one who can
logically deny the futility of this
war. Thorn worked with one naval
bomber squadron that lost all of
its planes twice and half of its
men in only nine months. Finn
talked of occasions where a
company would lose 70 per cent
of its men trying to take a hill,
only to abandon it the day after
they captured it.
The ,var in Vietnam is not
simply a mistake. It is a crime,
and we are all responsible for it.
Let us remember the words of
Mickey Finn: "I am guilty of
murder every time a man is killed,
as long as my country is a part of
it."
Blood, Blood, Blood
Let us think for a moment of
those Americans who did not
return from the war, and what
comments they would have had
they lived to be released from a
military machine which will allow
no dissent from its soldiers.
Let us wake each morning, as
so many of our Vietnam veterans
inescapably do, to visions of
American boys being killed and
forced to kill for no good reason,
Vietnamese villages and crops
being burned to the ground for no
good reason, innocent Vietnamese

The comment came from
former Army sergeant Mickey
Finn, a veteran of the war in
Vietnam. Now bitterly opposed to
the war, and to the nature of the
American military in general, Finn
is working for GI Help in San
Francisco.
What Finn was a part of is a
massive, clever, brutal military
machine that is effectively
perpetuating a foreign policy
which is not only stupid and
misguided, but totally alien to the
concepts on which this country
was founded.
America fought a revolution
200 years ago based on the
concept of self-determination and
imbedded with a deep regard for
human rights. The revolution
brought democracy to America,
or at least some semblance of it.
The English, having a vested
economic interest in the American
colonies, tried to suppress the
revolution and failed.
Ho Endorses Democracy
America has chosen to cast
itself in a role similar to the
English of the 1700's. In Vietnam
(and around the world,
particularly in Latin America) we
are suppressing revolution.
After World War 11, Ho Chi
Minh came to America asking for
support for Vietnamese
independence and presenting a
document strangely similar to our

own Declaration of Independence.
We informed him flatly that the
French were returning and would
have our support. Since then we
have consistently opposed the
nationalist-communist movement
he led. The movement's goal was
independence for all of Vietnam.
Perhaps we had no business
supporting the movement, and the
revolution that ensued, but
neither did we have any right to
suppress it.
We have crucial economic
interests in Vietnam—-vital natural
resources, for instance. The
investments of American
industries in South Vietnam and
all of Southeast Asia are
enormous.
Naive, Stupid, Corrupt
We say we are there to fight for
freedom. Some of us are naive
enough to believe this. A
government that censors the
newspaper, jails its political
opponents, and lives in
magnificent luxury made possible
by its own corruption is not any
symbol of freedom. Thieu and Ky
are dictators. We are fighting to
perpetuate their undemocratic
rule.
Former sergeant Finn has said
that the Vietnamese people see
the conflict as a civil war, not as
an invasion from the North. He
claims that the two factions in
Vietnam are "pro-Western and
anti-Western" and that the
invasion is being carried on by
America.
America is wrong in

he is not placed on the list of

of these horrors, for all of us who
call ourselves Americans are
responsible for them. We have
allowed it all to happen.
And we must allow it no
longer. We must support the
Vietnam Moratorium and deliver
this one unalterable demand to
the Nixon Administration: STOP.
Stop the American military
machine from extinguishing one
more human life, one more breath
of beauty.
Tomorrow, Lee Thorn, and his
fellow members of the Veterans
for Peace, will be at the front of
the largest peace march in the
history of San Francisco. For as
long as it is necessary, they will be
working to end the war and the
inhumanity of American
militarism.
We all must join them. For the
burden of guilt is on all our
shoulders. The blood is on all our
hands.
(Larry Diamond is a freshman

Thorn spoke of a marine he
knew well who worked at the
Treasure Island military station,
one of three stations in the
country that receives the bodies
from Vietnam. The Treasure
Island station alone often received
as many as IV2 times the number
of bodies that were listed as killed
in combat the week before. And
the other two stations were
simultaneously receiving bodies.
Thus, the bodies being brought
home from Vietnam often ran as
high as 2 or 3 times the number of
Americans on the list of war dead
the week before.
Bomb Now; Explode Later
But the cleverness of the
military machine is exceeded only
by its very basic inhumanity.
Thorn revealed that America has
dropped large numbers of
specially fused bombs that won't
explode for five or ten years. The
rationale behind this is, of course,
that the war is never going to end
so we might as well keep those
bombs exploding.
We are extensively using
anti-personnel fragmentation
bombs, which send hundreds of
pieces of shrapnel flying wildly in
all directions. The only thing this
shrapnel can do effectively is
pierce human flesh.
Another basic bomb is the
2,000 pound napalm bomo, which
can obliterate a large area of
Vietnamese jungle. The jungles in
Vietnam are beautiful, and so are
the people in and around them.
They, many of them women and
children, are also being obliterated
by our napalm bombs.
Viet Cong Heads
Finn as well saw inhumane
activities—whole villages being
burned to the ground by
American flame-throwers and
then mined so the people could
not return.
He saw chlorine gas used to
clear the Viet Cong out of certain
areas. The gas is fatal in small

concentrations, and its use would
seem to constitute a violation of
international and moral law.
When he was fighting near
Pleiku, he saw six Viet Cong heads
laying on a road, severed with
American bayonets. Aces of
spades were pinned on them.
American Mass Murders
"We're not protecting the
Vietnamese," Finn said, "we're
killing them. We often don't
bother to take prisoners, we just
murder them. We have very
probably cut off more enemy
heads than the Communists."
There is no one who can
logically deny the futility of this
war. Thorn worked with one naval
bomber squadron that lost all of
its planes twice and half of its
men in only nine months. Finn
talked of occasions where a
company would lose 70 per cent
of its men trying to take a hill,
only to abandon it the day after
they captured it.
The ,var in Vietnam is not
simply a mistake. It is a crime,
and we are all responsible for it.
Let us remember the words of
Mickey Finn: "I am guilty of
murder every time a man is killed,
as long as my country is a part of
it."
Blood, Blood, Blood
Let us think for a moment of
those Americans who did not
return from the war, and what
comments they would have had
they lived to be released from a
military machine which will allow
no dissent from its soldiers.
Let us wake each morning, as
so many of our Vietnam veterans
inescapably do, to visions of
American boys being killed and
forced to kill for no good reason,
Vietnamese villages and crops
being burned to the ground for no
good reason, innocent Vietnamese

The comment came from
former Army sergeant Mickey
Finn, a veteran of the war in
Vietnam. Now bitterly opposed to
the war, and to the nature of the
American military in general, Finn
is working for GI Help in San
Francisco.
What Finn was a part of is a
massive, clever, brutal military
machine that is effectively
perpetuating a foreign policy
which is not only stupid and
misguided, but totally alien to the
concepts on which this country
was founded.
America fought a revolution
200 years ago based on the
concept of self-determination and
imbedded with a deep regard for
human rights. The revolution
brought democracy to America,
or at least some semblance of it.
The English, having a vested
economic interest in the American
colonies, tried to suppress the
revolution and failed.
Ho Endorses Democracy
America has chosen to cast
itself in a role similar to the
English of the 1700's. In Vietnam
(and around the world,
particularly in Latin America) we
are suppressing revolution.
After World War 11, Ho Chi
Minh came to America asking for
support for Vietnamese
independence and presenting a
document strangely similar to our

own Declaration of Independence.
We informed him flatly that the
French were returning and would
have our support. Since then we
have consistently opposed the
nationalist-communist movement
he led. The movement's goal was
independence for all of Vietnam.
Perhaps we had no business
supporting the movement, and the
revolution that ensued, but
neither did we have any right to
suppress it.
We have crucial economic
interests in Vietnam—-vital natural
resources, for instance. The
investments of American
industries in South Vietnam and
all of Southeast Asia are
enormous.
Naive, Stupid, Corrupt
We say we are there to fight for
freedom. Some of us are naive
enough to believe this. A
government that censors the
newspaper, jails its political
opponents, and lives in
magnificent luxury made possible
by its own corruption is not any
symbol of freedom. Thieu and Ky
are dictators. We are fighting to
perpetuate their undemocratic
rule.
Former sergeant Finn has said
that the Vietnamese people see
the conflict as a civil war, not as

napalmed into oblivion for no
good reason.
Let us, too, scream over
nightmares of 10-year-fuse bombs,
anti-personnel fragmentation
bombs, 2,000 pound napalm
bombs, chlorine gas and tear gas,
severed heads, and severed limbs,
and severed souls, and blood,
blood, blood.
Feel That Guilt
lut us feel the guilt and agony
of these horrors, for all of us who
call ourselves Americans are
responsible for them. We have
allowed it all to happen.
And we must allow it no
longer. We must support the
Vietnam Moratorium and deliver
this one unalterable demand to
the Nixon Administration: STOP.
Stop the American military
machine from extinguishing one
more human life, one more breath
of beauty.
Tomorrow, Lee Thorn, and his
fellow members of the Veterans
for Peace, will be at the front of
the largest peace march in the
history of San Francisco. For as
long as it is necessary, they will be
working to end the war and the
inhumanity of American
militarism.
We all must join them. For the
burden of guilt is on all our
shoulders. The blood is on all our
hands.
(Larry Diamond is a freshman
and a DAILY reporter.)
Thorn spoke of a marine he
knew well who worked at the
Treasure Island military station,
one of three stations in the
country that receives the bodies
from Vietnam. The Treasure
Island station alone often received
as many as IV2 times the number
of bodies that were listed as killed
in combat the week before. And
the other two stations were
simultaneously receiving bodies.
Thus, the bodies being brought
home from Vietnam often ran as
high as 2 or 3 times the number of
Americans on the list of war dead
the week before.
Bomb Now; Explode Later
But the cleverness of the
military machine is exceeded only
by its very basic inhumanity.
Thorn revealed that America has
dropped large numbers of
specially fused bombs that won't
explode for five or ten years. The
rationale behind this is, of course,
that the war is never going to end
so we might as well keep those
bombs exploding.
We are extensively using
anti-personnel fragmentation
bombs, which send hundreds of
pieces of shrapnel flying wildly in
all directions. The only thing this
shrapnel can do effectively is
pierce human flesh.
Another basic bomb is the
2,000 pound napalm bomo, which
can obliterate a large area of
Vietnamese jungle. The jungles in
Vietnam are beautiful, and so are
the people in and around them.
They, many of them women and
children, are also being obliterated
by our napalm bombs.
Viet Cong Heads
Finn as well saw inhumane
activities—whole villages being
burned to the ground by
American flame-throwers and
then mined so the people could
not return.
He saw chlorine gas used to
clear the Viet Cong out of certain
areas. The gas is fatal in small

concentrations, and its use would
seem to constitute a violation of
international and moral law.
When he was fighting near
Pleiku, he saw six Viet Cong heads
laying on a road, severed with
American bayonets. Aces of
spades were pinned on them.
American Mass Murders
"We're not protecting the
Vietnamese," Finn said, "we're
killing them. We often don't
bother to take prisoners, we just
murder them. We have very
probably cut off more enemy
heads than the Communists."
There is no one who can
logically deny the futility of this
war. Thorn worked with one naval
bomber squadron that lost all of
its planes twice and half of its
men in only nine months. Finn
talked of occasions where a
company would lose 70 per cent
of its men trying to take a hill,
only to abandon it the day after
they captured it.
The ,var in Vietnam is not
simply a mistake. It is a crime,
and we are all responsible for it.
Let us remember the words of
Mickey Finn: "I am guilty of
murder every time a man is killed,
as long as my country is a part of
it."
Blood, Blood, Blood
Let us think for a moment of
those Americans who did not
return from the war, and what
comments they would have had
they lived to be released from a
military machine which will allow
no dissent from its soldiers.
Let us wake each morning, as
so many of our Vietnam veterans
inescapably do, to visions of
American boys being killed and
forced to kill for no good reason,
Vietnamese villages and crops
being burned to the ground for no
good reason, innocent Vietnamese
"It is hard for me to function
when I realize what I was a part
of."
The comment came from
former Army sergeant Mickey
Finn, a veteran of the war in
Vietnam. Now bitterly opposed to
the war, and to the nature of the
American military in general, Finn
is working for GI Help in San
Francisco.
What Finn was a part of is a
massive, clever, brutal military
machine that is effectively
perpetuating a foreign policy
which is not only stupid and
misguided, but totally alien to the
concepts on which this country
was founded.
America fought a revolution
200 years ago based on the
concept of self-determination and
imbedded with a deep regard for
human rights. The revolution
brought democracy to America,
or at least some semblance of it.
The English, having a vested
economic interest in the American
colonies, tried to suppress the
revolution and failed.
Ho Endorses Democracy
America has chosen to cast
itself in a role similar to the
English of the 1700's. In Vietnam
(and around the world,
particularly in Latin America) we
are suppressing revolution.
After World War 11, Ho Chi
Minh came to America asking for
support for Vietnamese
independence and presenting a
document strangely similar to our

own Declaration of Independence.
We informed him flatly that the
French were returning and would
have our support. Since then we
have consistently opposed the
nationalist-communist movement
he led. The movement's goal was
independence for all of Vietnam.
Perhaps we had no business
supporting the movement, and the
revolution that ensued, but
neither did we have any right to
suppress it.
We have crucial economic
interests in Vietnam—-vital natural
resources, for instance. The
investments of American
industries in South Vietnam and
all of Southeast Asia are
enormous.
Naive, Stupid, Corrupt
We say we are there to fight for
freedom. Some of us are naive
enough to believe this. A
government that censors the
newspaper, jails its political
opponents, and lives in
magnificent luxury made possible
by its own corruption is not any
symbol of freedom. Thieu and Ky
are dictators. We are fighting to
perpetuate their undemocratic
rule.
Former sergeant Finn has said
that the Vietnamese people see
the conflict as a civil war, not as
an invasion from the North. He
claims that the two factions in
Vietnam are "pro-Western and
anti-Western" and that the
invasion is being carried on by
America.
America is wrong in
Vietnam—wrong not only in its
stupid decision to commit ground
troops to a guerilla war in a
foreign nation, but also in its
decision to intrude in a civil war
to protect its economic and
military interests.
Incredibly Clever Machines
The military machine that is
perpetuating this policy is
incredibly clever. Vietnam veteran
Lee Thorn, a former naval
intelligence officer, has described

a largely unknown policy that the
military has on the listing of
American war deaths.
Thorn said that far more
Americans are dying than we are
told about. To be officially listed
as killed in combat, asolidermust
die on the battlefield. If he dies in
the helicopter or in the hospital,
he is not placed on the list of
Vietnam War dead.
