# Moral Imperative
## We Must Persevere 
### Sanford Dornbusch 
I'm sleeping less at night, but
not because of insomnia. There
simply is not enough time during
the usual day to complete my
work and the added burden of
Moratorium activities. Since many
people share this state of
exhaustion and commitment, it
might be informative to detail a
few of mv feelings and concerns.
"Two cheers for democracy,"
expresses my ideology.
Democracy's imperfections are
obvious and exceeded only by
those of all its competitors. So
reform, not revolution, is my
hope. I want our government to
be responsive to today's problems,
not the shadows cast by the last
generation's fires. I want our
government to express our shared
aspirations and not the lowest
common denominator of our
fears. And I want to have the
United States of America
represent to the world's poor the
search for peace and dignity.

rather than war and perpetual
subordination.
Many people today have lost
faith that our government can
redirect its resources toward
peace, racial equality, and the
solution of urban problems. I do
not share this conviction. I feel
that this loss of faith will present
us with our greatest future
domestic problem. It is not just
radicals, but millions, who have
become embittered, cynical, and
distrustful. For me, it is a moral
imperative that I devote some
energy to the solution of today's
key problem, Vietnam. If we fail,
the result will be a failure for
democracy.
I am not optimistic, but there is
no alternative to the Moratorium
worth choosing. To be able to
look in the mirror without
flinching, we must resolutely
persevere.
