"I'm working on a Christmas
special to bring all Gl's home to
visit Bob Hope," General
Waste-More-Land said as he
perused an aghast group of
Stanford Daily-ites yesterday.
The General just wandered in,
as he has for the last four years
across the country. His policy has
been to give "undeclared
speeches, in undeclared places, at
undeclared times—as long as
Nixon continues to wage an
undeclared and therefore an
unconstitutional war!"
Decked out in a facsimile of the
U.S. Army uniform complete with
pink shirt, model warplanes on his
epaulets and a chest full of battle
ribbons, the General is here to
take part in Moratorium activities
in the Bay Area.
He and fellow general staff
member General Hershey Bar are
planning a USO tour soon to
entertain American heroes "in
Sweden and Canada."
Full of Nuts
"General Hershey Bar has
triumphed over General Hershey,"
Waste-More-Land offered. "That's
cause he's full of love and plain
chocolate. The one in Washington
was full of nuts."
Waste-More-Land claimed his
chemical experts in the Pentagon
havy discovered the difference
between LSD and President
Nixon. "LSD is a drug, while
Nixon is a dope," he explained.
Making a belt-level gesture that
he said was a naval salute of his
own invention, the general
appealed for volunteers in his
non-army.

The general apologized if he

appeared to be somewhat
confused, but said that was
typical of all Pentagon generals.
"I have a bill in the House of
Representative to make it illegal

for young men to go to war unless
accompanied by their parents," he
said. "My slogan for the bill is:
the family that goes to war
together dies together."
