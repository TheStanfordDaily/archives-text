# Self-Repudiation
## Nixon's Speech 
### Creole Francis 
He seems to equate his policies
with the common will and claims,
in effect, that by yielding to the
minority demands he would be
betraying the trust of the
majority. This is a difficult
conclusion for him to reach in
light of the fact that he received
less than 50 per cent of the
popular vote in 1968 and the fact
that on any given issue many who
voted for him will disagree. He
must reason that silence is accord.
Nixon is repudiating the type
of political activity that got him
nominated for the presidency.
Political parties, like pressure
groups, are made up of
interest-linked people who wish to
have their common views
represented in the government.
The main difference is that
pressure groups tend to bq
issue-oriented. At this time several
questions arise regarding Nixonian
logic:
1) If it is wrong to listen to
pressure groups, why is lobbying
accepted?
2) Who gave the government
the right to decide to whom it will
or will not be responsive?
3) Why is it more harmful to
democracy to respond to the
advocate of peace than to respond
to the advice of Strom Thurmond
and the forces of the Right?
Interestingly, Nixon "knows"
what the "vast silent majority"
thinks. If they are silent, how
does he know?ls he, like Plato's
philosopher-kings, gifted with
qualities not possessed by
common men? How does he know
that the silent, pro-Nixon,
middle-of-the-road Americans are
in the majority?

Just as there are those who,
through apathy fail to vocalize
their support for Nixon, there are
those who disagree and are silent.
In any event, democracy is not
ruled by the majority, it is ruled
by the majority of those who are

willing to participate â€”"the vocal
groups." There are no provisions
for the representation of the
apathetic.
