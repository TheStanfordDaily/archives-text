# Come Together
## Coalition Needed 
### Carrie Sapir 
If the war is going to end it can
only end by all the forces
opposing U.S. foreign policy
coming together and working
together. Coming together means
being open with one another a:
struggling within the coalition
over ideological, political and
tactical differences—struggling
together until we can come to
some common understanding of
what we can do together and why.
If one party takes a rigid line, the
coalition cannot continue.
At the Sunday night
Moratorium meeting a group of
liberal professors took the rigid
position that they knew what the
Moratorium wanted and knew
how to get the broadest possible
support. Their position, they
claimed, was the position of the
"broad masses," and therefore the
correct one.
The question of who the
"broad masses" the Moratorium is
trying to reach must be answered.
Prof. Perl's masses are

professionals, clergymen,
engineers, who are frightened off
at the thought of dealing with
radicals or workers and would
nrefer to exclude them out of
heir" coalition.
To the radicals on the other
hand the "broad masses" are the
working people in industry.
Workers, because of their
relationship to production, are
physically in the position of
stopping the war machinery. They
are also the most adversely
effected by the war in taxes, lives
and take-home pay, and it is more
in their interest to end the war
now. They are also a vastly larger
and broader group than the
professionals.
We understand that alone we
are powerless and only together
can we be strong. But for the
coalition to function, those
professionals are going to have to
begin to deal with the reality in
this country and not continue to
stay aloof from the people.
