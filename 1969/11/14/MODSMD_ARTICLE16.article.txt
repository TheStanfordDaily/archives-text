# Question of Fascism
## Alioto Lied To Us 
### Randolph Bonner 
This column is dedicated
to the proposition that fascism is
not only not dead, it is alive, well
and growing in the United States.
This is a heavy charge which
bears much scrutiny and
discussion, more than could be
dealt with in a single column,
consequently this column will
appear weekly. Each column will
deal with another aspect of
fascism and its growth.
I am writing this column even
though I am not an expert on the
subject of fascism. Few of us are.
But I don't believe we can sit
around waiting for the experts to
begin the discussion. (Actually the
real experts, the fascists
themselves, are only too happy to
discuss the subject. Their
discussion consists either of
denials that fascism exists or of
definitions of fascism as a left
wing phenomenon. One need not
be a fascist, of course, to deny
that it exists, but we should be
very suspect of someone who
attempts the rhetorical
sleight-of-hand necessary to define
fascism as a leftist phenomenon.
But this is a finer point which will
be discussed at a later date.)
Political Police
One of the more historically
obvious aspects of fascism is the
use of arbitrary police power.
"Arbitrary" in the sense that the
actions of the police are beyond
the control of the people whose
rights are nominally being
protected. From the point of view
of those who direct the police,
their actions are anything but
arbitrary: they are used to repress

dissent. That is, they are political
police. Though this is becoming
increasingly obvious in the case of
"regular" police (another topic
for another time), it is most
obvious where the police are
formed into special units such as
"riot control squads" and "red
squads."
Alioto's Tac Squad
One of the prototypical riot
squads is San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto's "Tactical Unit."
When Mr. Alioto was at Stanford
two weeks ago to address the
"America on the Threshold of the
70's" symposium, he was met
with pickets and leaflets regarding
his use of the Tac Squad. The
leaflet discussed the use of the
Tac Squad to deny freedom of
speech and assembly at S.F. State,
the Haight-Ashbury, and Golden
Gate Park, to direct the armed
attack against the Black Panther
office prior to Huey Newton's bail
hearing last May, to assault a
picket Jine of striking hospital
workers at Kaiser Hospital, etc.
Anyone who reads t}ie S.K.
Chronicle knows that these are
but a few of the Tac Squad's
encounters. The leaflet also made
the point that the Tac Squad was
formed within 10 days of Mr.
Alioto's election.
Almost as soon as he began to
speak, Mr. Alioto disclaimed the
fact that the Tac Squad was
formed directly after his election.
He then went on to attack SDS
for telling lies about him (the
leaflet was not prepared by SDS,
it was prepared by The Stanford

Community Against War and
Fascism, to which I belong.)
Alioto's Lie
Later, during the question
period, I asked Mr. Alioto for his
version of the formation of the
Tac Squad and for his source of
information that SDS had
prepared the leaflet. He admitted
he didn't know who had prepared
the leaflet (though it was signed)
and said one of his hosts (the
Political Union) had told him it
was SDS. Upon realizing his
"mistake," he apologized to SDS
and went on to say he stood
corrected, it was the Stanford
Community Against War and
Fascism (SCAWF) which had lied
about him.
He would not be specific about
who had formed the Tac Squad or
why or when, but he said
emphatically that it had been
formed over a year before he took
office. I didn't believe him but I
didn't say anything because my
information was third hand and
besides, I was somewhat
intimidated by his most
authoratative stage presence.
I later called the Tac Squad at
the S.F. Police Dept. to find out
for sure when the unit had been
formed: November 16, 1967. 1
then called the Mayor's Office to
find out when Mr. Alioto had
been elected: November 7, 1967,
nine days earlier. It was not SDS
nor even the SCAWF that lied
about Mr. Alioto. He lied about
himself. Why?
