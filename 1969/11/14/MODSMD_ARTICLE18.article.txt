notice!)
At a meeting of a medical group in San
Francisco recently, a well-known doctor
told of a "morning after" oral
contraceptive that had successfully been
taken by hundreds of college coeds and
found to be 100% effective. The doctor
said that among those taking part in the
test were 900 coeds from UCLA.
Now, we're not against medical
advancement and such but we feel that
such coed experiemntation by semi-official
invitation is slightly alarming! Of course
the pills were voluntary and all that for all

those participating but we feel that such an
offer should never have been made
available to college age women even on a
voluntary basis!
After all, many girls are away from home
during their college years. Is it morally
proper for medical science to hold out such
an attractive apple to a young person?
Haven't young people going to college
enough temptations to cope with?
KHJ radio feels that there must have
been enough other women available out of
school to participate in the project.
So-while we commend science and what
it hopes to do for man, and woman for that
matter, we would urge that college age
females be passed over for such future
tests.
