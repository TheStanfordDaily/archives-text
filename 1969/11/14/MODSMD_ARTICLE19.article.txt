# Faculty, Staff Speak Out
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
More than 200 faculty and staff
members voiced opposition to the
Nixon Administration's Vietnam
policy at yesterday noon's
"Witness for Peace."
Organized as part of the
Vietnam War Moratorium
activities, the "Witness" was
characterized by pleas for support
of other Moratorium events,
demands that United States
troops be withdrawn from
Vietnam immediately, and
statements that the Moratorium
can turn the silent majority into a
vocal majority which will bring
peace to Vietnam.
A crowd of 400-500 in White
Plaza watched 227 members of
the Stanford faculty and staff
identify themselves as supporters
of the Moratorium. A few
addressed the crowd on their
views of the Vietnam War.
Virtually the whole spectrum of
University opinion was
represented by the group; from
the English and Engineering
Departments to the Provost's
office and the University libraries.
Dean of the Chapel, B. Davie
Napier, set the tone for the
demonstration by pointing out
the theological nature of the
"Witness," which in a sense means
to testify or affirm. He said that
the "Witness" is a "faith that man
is first man" and that he is only
secondarily a member of a
particular race, religion, or
nationality.
All Men Brothers
Napier continued that the
people there were reaffirming that
all men are brothers, that the
United States cannot impose the
American will upon the
Vietnamese, and that men can and

will live and walk upon the earth
as human beings.
St. Clair Drake, professor of
sociology and anthropology,
explained the three levels on
which he opposed the Vietnam
War. He demanded as a human
being that the slaughtering and
debasing of human beings be
stopped. Secondly, as a social
scientist he feels that the war is
distorting that field of study.
Lastly, as a black American he
opposes the high rate of black
casualties in Vietnam and the
tremendous money wasted that
should be spent to solve the
problems of Black Americans.

History Professor Gordon
Wright traced the opposition to
the Vietnam War over the last five
years. He declared that today with
the mistakes the United States has
made in Vietnam, "One at the risk
of being called a traitor, must say,
'Enough!' "
Distrust of Administration
Many speakers spoke of a
growing distrust of the
Administration and its policies.
Bernard P. Cohen, chairman of
the sociology department,
declared that President Nixon's
speech on Vietnam was merely an
attempt to "put down" those who
oppose the war. "We should

answer, 'We will not be put
down.' "
Both pessimism and hope were
present in the speeches; hope that
the Moratorium activities would
help bring peace to Vietnam
immediately and the pessimistic
fear that it will become more and
more difficult in the future to
oppose Nixon's Vietnam policy.
One speaker declared that "our
destinies ace being controlled by
the past." The decisions of men
who are no longer in office and no
longer represent the American
people are still controlling our
actions. She feels that it is the
"time to turn all our creative
talents to the future and not the
past."

St. Clair Drake, professor of
sociology and anthropology,
explained the three levels on
which he opposed the Vietnam
War. He demanded as a human
being that the slaughtering and
debasing of human beings be
stopped. Secondly, as a social
scientist he feels that the war is
distorting that field of study.
Lastly, as a black American he
opposes the high rate of black
casualties in Vietnam and the
tremendous money wasted that
should be spent to solve the
problems of Black Americans.

History Professor Gordon
Wright traced the opposition to
the Vietnam War over the last five
years. He declared that today with
the mistakes the United States has
made in Vietnam, "One at the risk
of being called a traitor, must say,
'Enough!' "
Distrust of Administration
Many speakers spoke of a
growing distrust of the
Administration and its policies.
Bernard P. Cohen, chairman of
the sociology department,
declared that President Nixon's
speech on Vietnam was merely an
attempt to "put down" those who
oppose the war. "We should

answer, 'We will not be put
down.' "
Both pessimism and hope were
present in the speeches; hope that
the Moratorium activities would
help bring peace to Vietnam
immediately and the pessimistic
fear that it will become more and
more difficult in the future to
oppose Nixon's Vietnam policy.
One speaker declared that "our
destinies ace being controlled by
the past." The decisions of men
who are no longer in office and no
longer represent the American
people are still controlling our
actions. She feels that it is the
"time to turn all our creative
talents to the future and not the
past."

QUEUEING UP—Faculty and stall line up in White Plaza waiting their turn to puhlicb announce their acceptance of the
"Facult\ Witness" statement. Over 200 took the vow.
More than 200 faculty and staff
members voiced opposition to the
Nixon Administration's Vietnam
policy at yesterday noon's
"Witness for Peace."
Organized as part of the
Vietnam War Moratorium
activities, the "Witness" was
characterized by pleas for support
of other Moratorium events,
demands that United States
troops be withdrawn from
Vietnam immediately, and
statements that the Moratorium
can turn the silent majority into a
vocal majority which will bring
peace to Vietnam.
A crowd of 400-500 in White
Plaza watched 227 members of
the Stanford faculty and staff
identify themselves as supporters
of the Moratorium. A few
addressed the crowd on their
views of the Vietnam War.
Virtually the whole spectrum of
University opinion was
represented by the group; from
the English and Engineering
Departments to the Provost's
office and the University libraries.
Dean of the Chapel, B. Davie
Napier, set the tone for the
demonstration by pointing out
the theological nature of the
"Witness," which in a sense means
to testify or affirm. He said that
the "Witness" is a "faith that man
is first man" and that he is only
secondarily a member of a
particular race, religion, or
nationality.
All Men Brothers
Napier continued that the
people there were reaffirming that
all men are brothers, that the
United States cannot impose the
American will upon the
Vietnamese, and that men can and

will live and walk upon the earth
as human beings.
