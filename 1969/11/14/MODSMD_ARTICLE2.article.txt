# Money Urged A Major Factor In SRI Split
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Financial return should be "the
major factor" in deciding how to
sever Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) from the University, the
Faculty Senate urged yesterday.
Members passed the resolution,
directed to the Trustees, in a
divided voice vote. They acted in
response to the "serious financial
problems" outlined two weeks
ago by Provost Richard Lyman
and Vice-President for Finance
Kenneth Cuthbertson.
The Senate did not take any
action regarding the Vietnam
Moratorium. Members were given
xeroxed copies of a student
Senate resolution asking President
Kenneth Pitzer to cancel classes,
and information about later
student approval of Pitzer's
denying that request.
Sociology professor Sanford
Dornbusch interpreted the lack of
faculty action as an indication of
"general satisfaction" with the
University's position. "At least
there was no great
dissatisfaction," said Dornbusch,
who was instrumental in the
faculty witness for peace held
yesterday afternoon.
SR I Reversal?
According to computer science
professor Jerome Feldman, the
SRI resolution was "a clear
reversal" of the senate's choice
last spring. Following stormy
weeks of conflict over SRI, the
Senate advised Trustees last May
to restrict SRI activities relating
to chemical and biological
warfare.
Feldman contended that
yesterday's resolution, offered by
law professor Kenneth Scott, is
only a disguised version of an SRI
Committee minority report
released last spring. The minority
view, written by Scott and
Lyman, emphasized the difficulty
of imposing a restrictive legal
covenant on SRI while
maximizing profit from its sale.
Dornbusch maintained last
night that the latest SRI
resolution has "absolutely no
effect" on the restrictions
suggested in May. Last spring, the
committee was primarily
concerned with whether to keep
or sever SRI, not how to sell it, he
said.

return to the University as the
major factor in determining the
arrangements by which the Board
terminates the University's
relationship with Stanford
Research Institute.
The Senate tabled another
motion also introduced in
response to the budget squeeze. It
stated: "Resolved that a primary
financial goal of the University be
yearly cost of living pay increases
for University employees."
Committees Named
Faculty appointments to senate
committees on Graduate Studies
and on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid were also
announced.
Those chosen by the Senate
Committee on Committees for the
Graduate Studies Committee are:
chairman Robert Hofstadter,
physics; Arthur Bryson,
aeronautics and astronautics; Lee

Cronbach, education; Hugo
DiGiulio, industrial engineering;
Moffatt Hancock, law; David
Hogness, biochemistry; Herbert
Lindenberger, english; Henry
Taube, chemistry.
Appointments to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and Financial Aid are:
chairman Arthur Bienstock,
physics; Bernard Cohen,
sociology; Frank Lobdell, art;
Perry McCarty, civil engineering;
Diane Middlebrook, english;
Halsey Royden, mathematics;
Roger Shepard, psychology.
Financial return should be "the
major factor" in deciding how to
sever Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) from the University, the
Faculty Senate urged yesterday.
Members passed the resolution,
directed to the Trustees, in a
divided voice vote. They acted in
response to the "serious financial
problems" outlined two weeks
ago by Provost Richard Lyman
and Vice-President for Finance
Kenneth Cuthbertson.
The Senate did not take any
action regarding the Vietnam
Moratorium. Members were given
xeroxed copies of a student
Senate resolution asking President
Kenneth Pitzer to cancel classes,
and information about later
student approval of Pitzer's
denying that request.
Sociology professor Sanford
Dornbusch interpreted the lack of
faculty action as an indication of
"general satisfaction" with the
University's position. "At least
there was no great
dissatisfaction," said Dornbusch,
who was instrumental in the
faculty witness for peace held
yesterday afternoon.
SR I Reversal?
According to computer science
professor Jerome Feldman, the
SRI resolution was "a clear
reversal" of the senate's choice
last spring. Following stormy
weeks of conflict over SRI, the
Senate advised Trustees last May
to restrict SRI activities relating
to chemical and biological
warfare.
Feldman contended that
yesterday's resolution, offered by
law professor Kenneth Scott, is
only a disguised version of an SRI
Committee minority report
released last spring. The minority
view, written by Scott and
Lyman, emphasized the difficulty
of imposing a restrictive legal
covenant on SRI while
maximizing profit from its sale.
Dornbusch maintained last
night that the latest SRI
resolution has "absolutely no
effect" on the restrictions
suggested in May. Last spring, the
committee was primarily
concerned with whether to keep
or sever SRI, not how to sell it, he
said.
Scott Resolution
