# System Under Fire
## Colleges Accused Of Fund Inefficiencies 
### TOM GIVEN 
Student discontent seems to be
growing over the financial
operation of California state
colleges and the University of
California system.
Last week, the president of San
Fernando Valley State College
demanded the budget and
expenditure records from his
administration.
This week, accountants from
the state auditor general's office
continued their investigations into
the handling of fnnds at
Sacramento State College.
Student Scrutiny
According to Linda Wolfe,
editor of the Sacramento State
Hornet, the investigations were
touched off by a freshman
reporter assigned a story about
the president of the college.

In setting up an appointment
for an interview, the reporter
discovered that the president was
in Chicago on personal business.
Further study indicated that he
was meeting with officials of
Servamation, Inc., a vending
machine company.
The company had earlier been
awarded the concession for
machines on campus, with a
higher percentage of gross income
going to it than to the former
company.
Subsequently, it was discovered
that the president had billed the
school for his trip—twice, in fact.
One of these bills went to the
Hornet Foundation, which
operates the vending machines,
cafeteria, bookstore, and other
services.
The President of Sacramento

State has since resigned, but some
students are still looking about for
further waste, as the charging of
tuition looms in the future.
In his initial report, auditor
general William H. Merrifield
claimed that poor utilization of
classroom facilities and
mismanagement of funds, not the
publicized cutbacks in requested
allocations by the Legislature,
accounted for the current squeeze
on admissions.
"They want to spend over
$100,000 to install lights in the
football stadium," complained
Miss Wolfe. "They can't even get
more than an few thousand kids
out for a game."
Tuition Coming
Nearby, at the University of
California at Davis, students are
anticipating tuition fees, though
without much enthusiasm.
"I think it is definitely
coming," states Bruce Daily,
editor of the Davis paper, the Cal
Aggie. "People here aren't too
excited, though when it (tuition)
comes they'll probably get up in
arms for a while."
Students at Davis, like those
across the state, seemed more
interested in the Moratorium,
than in tuition.
Wednesday, nine members of
the Students for a Democratic
Society marched on the

administration to denounce it as a
rascist institution. "I hope they
were able to dodge all the
bicycles" was the reaction of one
student to their protest.

cafeteria, bookstore, and other
services.
The President of Sacramento

State has since resigned, but some
students are still looking about for
further waste, as the charging of
tuition looms in the future.
In his initial report, auditor
general William H. Merrifield
claimed that poor utilization of
classroom facilities and
mismanagement of funds, not the
publicized cutbacks in requested
allocations by the Legislature,
accounted for the current squeeze
on admissions.
"They want to spend over
$100,000 to install lights in the
football stadium," complained
Miss Wolfe. "They can't even get
more than an few thousand kids
out for a game."
Tuition Coming
Nearby, at the University of
California at Davis, students are
anticipating tuition fees, though
without much enthusiasm.
"I think it is definitely
coming," states Bruce Daily,
editor of the Davis paper, the Cal
Aggie. "People here aren't too
excited, though when it (tuition)
comes they'll probably get up in
arms for a while."
Students at Davis, like those
across the state, seemed more
interested in the Moratorium,
than in tuition.
Wednesday, nine members of
the Students for a Democratic
Society marched on the

administration to denounce it as a
rascist institution. "I hope they
were able to dodge all the
bicycles" was the reaction of one
student to their protest.
Student discontent seems to be
growing over the financial
operation of California state
colleges and the University of
California system.
Last week, the president of San
Fernando Valley State College
demanded the budget and
expenditure records from his
administration.
This week, accountants from
the state auditor general's office
continued their investigations into
the handling of fnnds at
Sacramento State College.
Student Scrutiny
According to Linda Wolfe,
editor of the Sacramento State
Hornet, the investigations were
touched off by a freshman
reporter assigned a story about
the president of the college.

In setting up an appointment
for an interview, the reporter
discovered that the president was
in Chicago on personal business.
Further study indicated that he
was meeting with officials of
Servamation, Inc., a vending
machine company.
The company had earlier been
awarded the concession for
machines on campus, with a
higher percentage of gross income
going to it than to the former
company.
Subsequently, it was discovered
that the president had billed the
school for his trip—twice, in fact.
One of these bills went to the
Hornet Foundation, which
operates the vending machines,
cafeteria, bookstore, and other
services.
