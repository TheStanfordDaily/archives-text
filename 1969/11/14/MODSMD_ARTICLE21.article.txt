# Leafletting, Canvassing Meet Varied Success On First Day
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Twenty Stanford students
armed with leaflets and posters
posed little threat to the 25 Palo
Alto police officers dressed in full
riot gear who met them in the
first of the November Moratorium
activities yesterday morning in the
Stanford Industrial Park.
In other activities throughout
the day Stanford students
canvassed the small business
community to obtain their
support for the Moratorium.
Although the riot squad, part
of a vast security force present
throughout the Industrial Park,
met no violence or confrontation,
it presented an imposing sight to
employees driving to work.
At the Hewlett Packard plant
five Stanford leafletters met 12
security guards who stood by
taking pictures of all those
workers who accepted the
anti-war literature.
According to Moratorium
leader John Kramer, the large
show of force in the park was an
obvious attempt to scare workers
from participating in today's noon
Industrial Park rally. Kramer
stated that the reaction
"paralleled national policy of
attempting to isolate and repress
Moratorium activities."
Reaction in the morning ran
about evenly for and against the
students, with approximately half
the cars accepting leaflets.
According to one student, "we
were getting all different kinds of
reactions from nasty glares to
'thank you, brother, I'll be with
you tomorrow."
Afternoon leafletting appeared
to be more successful. According
to Kramer, several companies had
warned their employees to be
wary of SDS barricades, rock
throwing and rioting. "In the
afternoon, when the workers
realized there was no violence
connected with the leafletting, we
were met with more favorable
reaction."
In the other major Moratorium
activity yesterday over 100
Stanford students went into the
Palo Alto business community

asking simply that individual
employees be allowed to express
political views responsibly
without fear of reprisal.
The three goals of the
canvassers were to get the
businesses to sign the right to
dissent statement, to display
Moratorium posters, and to close
business on Friday and Saturday
in observance of the Moratorium.
The students found that, while
most employers were polite and
willing to talk, few would agree to
put a poster in the window or sign
the statement. Only one business,
the Plowshare Bookstore, agreed
to close.
According to Moratorium
leader Burt Richardson, "People

were just afraid to take a political
stand. To a lot of them, it
wouldn't make any difference.
They did not realize that their
remaining silent was in itself a
political action."
According to one student,
Townsend Walker, "The
businessmen I talked with are
operating on such a small margin
that they're afraid to take a public
stand for fear of offending their
customers."
"Anyone who dissents while
our boys are dying is treasonous,"
a television repairman told Sandy
Lawrence. "How much do you
know compared to what Nixon
knows? You don't have the facts
to be able to dissent."
