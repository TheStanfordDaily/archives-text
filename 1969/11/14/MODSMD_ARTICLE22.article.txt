# Money, Organization Problems
## Undergrad Housing Dilemma 
### PAUL PAPANEK 
"As a matter of highest
priority, the University should
undertake the construction of
new coeducational residences for
about 500 undergraduates," says
the 1968 report of the SES
(Study of Education at Stanford)
Committee.
Stanford has not built any new
general housing for at least ten
years, with the exception of the
two new fraternity clusters. And
the University has no further
residences scheduled for
completion after the Escondido
Four project is finished in August,
1971.
The problem is not only
money, although finances are
crucial. There is also the question
of aesthetics. The University is
understandably reluctant to keep
on filling up vacant land with
quickly planned structures, even if
such projects could be done
cheaply. "1 suppose we could
theoretically go on with bulk
housing almost indefinitely except
for the factor of aesthetics,"
Assistant to the Provost Alan
Grundmann told the Daily.
But a bigger problem is that the
University does not seem to know
where it is going on the question
of housing. The kinds of facilities
that a student residence should
offer to today's undergraduate is
still being debated.
Two Categories
Housing plans fall into two
general categories: the simple
residence, which provides a roof
and a bed, and perhaps meals; and
the residence which would
provide what Alan Grundmann
calls a "total educational
experience." This type of
residence might center around
some theme, have faculty
members or graduate students
living in as part of the
community, and sponsor its own
seminars and cultural programs.
"The present dormitory system
falls into this category by
default," says Grundmann.
As demands and ideas for new
kinds of residence programs
multiply, so do uncertainties.
More complex living plans mean
higher costs and require more
detailed planning. Take, for
example, the Moore and Jacks
housing projects.
Several years ago, Stanford
received large donations from
Robert S. Moore and David and
Margaret Jacks to build two co-ed
residence halls. The houses were
to have a high "faculty and
academic input.'' That is, they
were to have a number of faculty
members living within the
residence community; in addition,
plans called for a seminar room,
study rooms, and a small library

in each section of the residences.
The proposals were shelved three
years ago.
Trend Reversed
The reasons are fairly clear.
Three years ago there was a trend
for undergraduates, especially
undergraduate women, to move
off-campus. Demand for
on-campus housing was down.
Since the new residences were to
house over 500 students and
would involve huge building costs,
it seemed logical to wait until
demand was back up.
Today the trend has reversed.
But the Moore and Jacks plans
still sit on the shelf. The reason
given by the Planning Office isthat
the building and operating costs
of such residences are too high,
considering the number of
students they will serve. It is now
up to the Dean's Office to draft an
alternate plan. "As soon as they
come up with a project that
floats," Gene Kershner of the
Planning Office said, "it will go on
the Jacks plan."
This example underscores the
importance of financing. Stanford
depends on donations and
government grants for any new
buildings. The pressure of
inflation and building costs that
rise by 12% each year make it
nearly impossible to use general
University funds for new
construction.
Gifts Hard to Obtain
But private gifts and
government grants are harder to
obtain now than at any time since
World War 11. "Since the war,
when Stanford was becoming a
first-rate university, we also
became a big business," explained
Grundmann. "We can't keep going
on the same gifts."
Whereas family background was
previously taken into
consideration in admitting
students, intelligence is now the
main criterion. This means that
not all students can pay the full
tuition, and it also means a poorer
alumni, whose gifts have been a
major source of income for
Stanford.
The recent demonstrations on
college campuses have also made
potential donors more cautious.
"There are an awful lot of old
codgers who are awfully down on
Stanford right now," remarked
Grundmann, who is actively
involved in obtaining
contributions from government
and private sources.
Congressional Hostility
Congress is almost hostile to
colleges now because of student
unrest. "According to them,"
Grundmann said, "we're doing
everything from coddling
Communists to letting the
younger generation run wild. And
so we don't have an effective
lobby in Washington."

Add to this the administration's
policy of cutting back on Federal
spending in order to curb
inflation, and it is easy to see why
there are no more than a few new
buildings in the active-planning
stage on campus. Almost all
government agencies involved in
giving away money found
themselves with no funds this
year.
The Higher Education Facilities
Act (HEFA), which it was hoped
would finance several new campus
buildings, was effectively
cancelled for 1970. The Office of
Education just managed to give
away some funds it already had
before the cutback, and Stanford
got a share. (The funds will be
used on the new Education
Building, next to Stern, which is
scheduled for ground-breaking in
the fall of 1970.) The National
Science Foundation, which
financed the Herrin Biology
Building and the National
Institute of Health, which
partially funded the Animal
Research Center to be built on
Coyote Hill, have only token
budgets this year.
Business Gifts Down
The University cannot
realistically expect contributions
from business firms either, even in
areas where it might seem
profitable for a business to give a
substantial sum. A case in point is
the planned Computer Science
Building. The schematics on the
building have been completed for
some time now, but the plans are
being delayed until funds are
available. Neither IBM, which
made a generous gift of
equipment to the Computer
Center, nor any other corporation
is in a position to donate the huge
sum required to erect such a
building.
In fact, the largest gift a
corporation has given to Stanford
has been in the neighborhood of
$100,000. Compared with the
$4.7 million cost of the Space
Engineering Building, which was
substantially funded by NASA
(National Aeronautics and Space
Administration), or the $4 million
cost of the new Earth Sciences
Building, which was supported
largely by an NSF grant, even this
$1 00,000 gift appears small.
The net result of this financial
squeeze is that new building on
campus is liable to be spotty in
the futur . The Provost's Office
has a long list of building projects
which are being held up for lack
of funds.
Projects that have top priority
include completion of the Herrin
Biology Building, whose basement
remains an empty shell, a new
Law School to be located near the
Undergraduate Library, a new
wing for the Main Library, and

the remodeling of either the
History Corner or the Physiology
Building.
The University is also
committed to building a home for
the music department. The
tentative site for the music
buildings is behind Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. But the project is in
the same situation as the
Computer Science Building. In
either case, the money will almost
surely come from very wealthy
donors. "It's just a question of
hitting the jackpot," said
Grundmann.
Determining building priorities
is the job of the Provost's and the
Dean's Offices. The Planning
Office and even the Trustees have
little say in determining which
building should be moved to the
top of the priority list.
Many students would question
the wisdom of building a Space
Engineering building or a
High-Energy Physics Laboratory
(now under construction, slated
for completion in May, 1970),
when there seems to be more of a
demand to consolidate History,
Economics, and Political Science
on the Quad or to construct
housing for students and for
junior faculty and staff members.
New Law School First
The problem is essentially one
of money. Funds that are given to
the University are almost always
earmarked for a particular project.
But the Provost's Office is
continually soliciting funds for all
projects given Class 1-A priority.
The Law School is high on the
building list, and as soon as funds
become available, it will be built;
and then Economics and Political
Science will be able to move onto
the Quad next to History. Low
interest loans, such as the one that
made the construction of
Escondido Four possible, are
currently impossible to obtain;
but the Moore and Jacks projects
are ranked high in case any funds
that can be used for housing reach
the University.
Business Director Dwight B.
Adams said he thought the
officials in the Provost's Office
were putting out "more effort
than most other colleges and
universities to obtain money for
Stanford."
