# Hollywood Films Cash In On Youth
## 
### TODD McCarthy 
Anyone who goes to the movies
with any regularity cannot help
but notice the frenzy with which
Hollywood is currently trying to
cash in on "youth." By 110 means
am I going to try to define that
word, for it strikes me as an
appallingly generalized term even
Sprio T. Agnew might hesitate to
use (and, indeed, the movie men
have been trying hard enough to
figure out where young people are
at, for parents have given the kids
millions to spend to see movies.)
Nonetheless, it is refreshing to
see two films, both undeniably
commercially oriented, which deal
with young people in a manner
which neither exploits them or
tries to make significant, and
ultimately pretentious, social
pronouncements. The films are
Alice's Restaurant and The Sterile
Cuckoo.
Arthur Penn's Alice's
Restaurant is an incredibly
schizoid film, the result of which
is sometimes intriguiging and
often irritating. This split
viewpoint apparently arose out of
a disagreement between Penn,
who intended the film as a sort of
odyssey through America, Arlo
Guth rie-style, and Guthrie
himself, who, perhaps doubting
his own ability to carry the
picture, preferred to concentrate
on Alice and the events
surrounding the establishment of
their hippie community in
Stockbridge, Massachusetts.
Not surprisingly, the film's
most amusing and gratifying

moments are the visual recreations
of portions of the song, notably
Guthrie's run-in with the draft
and the garbage dumping incident.
Neither Smug nor Symbolic
Though the Alice/commune
episodes provide some surprising
insights into the problems posed
by their improvisational society,
they too often seem to be
consciously striving for dramatic
substance in order to hold the
film up. Fortunately, no attempt
is made to endow thy little
community with symbolic
proportions and there is none of
the smug, "Oh, look at those
funny hippies—aren't they
strange!" attitude which has
marred many films which have
dealt with similar characters.
Despite the fact that the two
narratives do not mesh very
comfortably, the film has the
special virtue of dealing with
people who are very real and
absolutely believable. It's like
spending some time with some
pleasant, open friends and sharing
their joys as well as their
problems. In this light, much of
one's responsiveness to the film
would seemingly be determined
by one's feelings for Guthrie, who
is likable but certainly not
awe-inspiring.
As for director Penn, he seems
to have a rather unique gift for
superimposing a veil of misty
melancholy over the historically
authenticatable personalities of
real people, as in The Left-Handed
Gun, The Miracle Worker and
Bonnie and Clyde. Indeed, one of
the criticism of Bonnie and Clyde
was that it glamorized gangsters
who, in reality, were thoroughly
contemptible and in the past
year, we have seen many articles
and even books which have tried
to reveal the true natures of
Barrow/Parker from behind the
supposedly deceiving delineations
of Beatty/Dunaway.
At any rate, Penn is one of the
few modern directors whose films
don't look like television and who
releases his social statements with
quiet understatement. In a
muddled way, Alice's Restaurant
is a tender homage to a way of life
which never really worked but
which was fun while they didn't
let its failure bother them.
Sterile Cuckoo
The Sterile Cuckoo is
unpretentious, honest, natural and

emphasizes people almost to the
exclusion of all else and while that
may not necessarily suggest praise,
it most certainly does in the
technique-ridden late sixties.
Some skeptics may feel that the
project seems like simply a
showcase for its star, Liza Minelli,
but so what? Regardless of the
assorted merits of the modern
cinema, it can't be denied that we
are desparately short of
interesting faces and vital acting
personalities. Liza Minelli is
nothing short of superb and
displays much of the life-loving
frenzy and magnified emotion
that her mother, Judy Garland,
did, especially in the likes of The
Clock, directed by Liza's father,
Vincente.

ARTHUR PFNN
The film's ups and downs
correspond rather accurately with
the variations in the romance
between the two inexperienced
college freshman. Accordingly,
the high point comes in the
mutual loss of virginity scene, in
which the young man displays a
sexual clumsiness surpassing that
of Benjamin Braddock in The
Graduate.
Perhaps the picture's major
fault is the indeterminate and
underdeveloped nature of the
young man, for after a while, the
girl's incessant enthusiasm
becomes somewhat unmotivated.
Nonetheless, Wendell Burton
(who played the lead in the San
Francisco production of Charlie
Brown for over a year) betrays a
iikable screen personality and Tim
Mclntire gives us a remarkably
appealing and actually tender
interpretation of a jock strap.
