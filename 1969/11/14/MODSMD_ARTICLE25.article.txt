# Igor Mead's Paintings: Pop Art And Realism
## 
### SUSIE DAY 
"All these people are parts of
our life, from Hitler to Kennedy."
This is how Igor Mead (Russian:
Medvedev) describes his exhibit,
now showing in the coffee house.
The display, which combines
the best of American Pop Art and
Russian Social Realism, offers a

fascinating study of many
personalities of our time.
Medvedev, who fled from
Russia in '42, did most of the
paintings exhibited during a tour
of his homeland with the USIA
cultural exchange exhibit
(sponsored by the State
Department). His work was
carried out in a bugged room in
the Ukraine, where every evening
he was forced to dissemble the
pictures into small squares which,
when shuffled, could not be used
to incriminate him.
These works, many of which
were collages made of Soviet
posters, were later smuggled back
into the United States, where they
remain unique example of Russian
art of the 60's.
In the major work at the
exhibit, the trypitchtriptych,
Medvedev has created a subtle
satire in a collage modelled after
the painting "Jesus in Glory" by a
15th century Russian painter,
Rubluv.
