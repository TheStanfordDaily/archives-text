# For What It's Worth
## No Rape, Just Fantastic Stones 
### CRAIG OKINO 
There's not a hell of a lot to say after seeing one of the
greatest concerts of your life . . . you simply sit in awe
and marvel at the fact that you saw the Rolling Stones,
the original bad boys of rock, prove to their followers that
they are still the best dirty rock and roll band alive.
I reluctantly shelled out my $7.50 for the concert, fully
expecting to get raped by Bill Graham and Co., but 1 was
incredibly wrong. The Oakland Coliseum, notorious for its
echo chamber acoustics, for once had a decent sound
system. The equipment changes between sets were models
of efficiency, and Graham's choice of supporting acts,
intentional or not, gave the Stones' performance all the
more impact.
Terry Reid succeeded in warming up the audience, but
he was an amateur among professionals that night. For
when the king of the blues, Mr. 8.8. King, strutted out, he
and Lucille sang so sweetly that the audience, for the
moment, forgot about the Stones completely.
Ike and Tina Turner's Revue elevated the crowd to
new, higher levels of orgasm. By now everyone had
forgotten about the Stones and 8.8. King-all eyes were
on Tina.
After their encore, the first major problem in an
otherwise well-run concert occurred. The rather shaky
explanation was that the Stones missed their connections
at the airport and would be a little late getting out. The
tension was unbearable; each preceding act raised the
audience higher, but now there was no release just
waiting.
An eternity later, the Stones appeared in all their glory.
Last to appear was Mick Jagger, dressed like some

perverted Superman—black tights, red shawl, an Uncle
Sam top hat. It took them considerable time to warm up
(my god, they're human!) their first number, "Jumpin'
Jack Flash," was marred by the failure of Keith Richard's
guitar. Mick Taylor, the new Stone, finished the song

playing both guitar parts while Richard was frantically
searching for an operable axe.
Mick then decided to do some acoustic numbers,
apologizing all the while (there's no need to, Mick), and
he and Keith did "Prodigal Son" and Rev. Gary Davis'
"Got to Move."
It was a few numbers after the acoustic set that the
Stones began to cook, Jagger pushing the band with
superlative singing, Richard and Taylor meshing perfectly.
After "Stray Cat Blues," the next intro sounded like the
beginning to "It's All Over Now." but when Jagger spit
out the lyrics, "please allow me to introduce myself," the
crowd went ape shit. The finale, with Jagger on the floor
screaming over the mike, "can you guess my name?",
Richard's insane guitar behind him, was too much for any
normal Stone freak to bear.
This is what the Stones wanted—not to be human
jukeboxes, but to play what they wanted the way they
wanted. They followed "Sympathy for the Devil" with
two new numbers, the first a slow blues, Taylor, who is a
far better soloist than Richard, doing unearthly slide
guitar work.
The other number was "Midnight Rambler," a long
piece beginning with Jagger's mouth harp and the vocal
line, "They call me the midnight rambler," which in the
second verse is changed to "midnight gambler." The
intensity builds, until Jagger is screaming "they call me
the midnight strangler!", flailing his red shawl around his
head. Whew!
Mick was totally enjoying himself and putting
everything into his singing, and the rest the band was full
of this same energy, evident in "Under My Thumb," and
Chuck Berry's "Little Queenie."

line, "They call me the midnight rambler," which in the
second verse is changed to "midnight gambler." The
intensity builds, until Jagger is screaming "they call me
the midnight strangler!", flailing his red shawl around his
head. Whew!
Mick was totally enjoying himself and putting
everything into his singing, and the rest the band was full
of this same energy, evident in "Under My Thumb," and
Chuck Berry's "Little Queenie."


FOUR FOLD FACE—Mick Jagger oi The Rolling Stones, v\lio
turned on at the Oakland Colcsium last weekend.
There's not a hell of a lot to say after seeing one of the
greatest concerts of your life . . . you simply sit in awe
and marvel at the fact that you saw the Rolling Stones,
the original bad boys of rock, prove to their followers that
they are still the best dirty rock and roll band alive.
I reluctantly shelled out my $7.50 for the concert, fully
expecting to get raped by Bill Graham and Co., but 1 was
incredibly wrong. The Oakland Coliseum, notorious for its
echo chamber acoustics, for once had a decent sound
system. The equipment changes between sets were models
of efficiency, and Graham's choice of supporting acts,
intentional or not, gave the Stones' performance all the
more impact.
Terry Reid succeeded in warming up the audience, but
he was an amateur among professionals that night. For
when the king of the blues, Mr. 8.8. King, strutted out, he
and Lucille sang so sweetly that the audience, for the
moment, forgot about the Stones completely.
Ike and Tina Turner's Revue elevated the crowd to
new, higher levels of orgasm. By now everyone had
forgotten about the Stones and 8.8. King-all eyes were
on Tina.
After their encore, the first major problem in an
otherwise well-run concert occurred. The rather shaky
explanation was that the Stones missed their connections
at the airport and would be a little late getting out. The
tension was unbearable; each preceding act raised the
audience higher, but now there was no release just
waiting.
An eternity later, the Stones appeared in all their glory.
Last to appear was Mick Jagger, dressed like some

perverted Superman—black tights, red shawl, an Uncle
Sam top hat. It took them considerable time to warm up
(my god, they're human!) their first number, "Jumpin'
Jack Flash," was marred by the failure of Keith Richard's
guitar. Mick Taylor, the new Stone, finished the song

playing both guitar parts while Richard was frantically
searching for an operable axe.
Mick then decided to do some acoustic numbers,
apologizing all the while (there's no need to, Mick), and
he and Keith did "Prodigal Son" and Rev. Gary Davis'
"Got to Move."
It was a few numbers after the acoustic set that the
Stones began to cook, Jagger pushing the band with
superlative singing, Richard and Taylor meshing perfectly.
After "Stray Cat Blues," the next intro sounded like the
beginning to "It's All Over Now." but when Jagger spit
out the lyrics, "please allow me to introduce myself," the
crowd went ape shit. The finale, with Jagger on the floor
screaming over the mike, "can you guess my name?",
Richard's insane guitar behind him, was too much for any
normal Stone freak to bear.
This is what the Stones wanted—not to be human
jukeboxes, but to play what they wanted the way they
wanted. They followed "Sympathy for the Devil" with
two new numbers, the first a slow blues, Taylor, who is a
far better soloist than Richard, doing unearthly slide
guitar work.
The other number was "Midnight Rambler," a long
piece beginning with Jagger's mouth harp and the vocal
line, "They call me the midnight rambler," which in the
second verse is changed to "midnight gambler." The
intensity builds, until Jagger is screaming "they call me
the midnight strangler!", flailing his red shawl around his
head. Whew!
