# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Romantics In Oakland 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
The Oakland Symphony Orchestra played their second concert of
the season Tuesday night to mild applause and a few anemic boos.
Unlike their opening program last month, when their friends and
enemies were both anxious to show their colors, this audience was,
quite understandably, less enthusiastic.
It is clearly the same Symphony. Maestro Samuel with his full
beard, and the program sporting its share of anti-tradition were all
there. The opening number, Mozart's "Overture to the Magic Flute,"
was a quite normal selection for a symphony orchestra, and the
Oaklanders played competently, although without much sparkle. The
Symphony's strongest point is its sonority, which did give the Mozart
the strength it needs to succeed at all.
The second piece on the program, the one that got me off to such a
bad mood, was the newly-discovered original second movement to
Mahler's "Symphony No. 1." That symphony was originally
conceived of as a tone poem on nature, the beauty of fields, and so
on; the second movement was entitled "Blumine" ("flower piece"),
and is basically a spacious theme-with-variations in a romantic vein. It
is pleasant and soothing, the sort of thing Andre Previn would play for
the background music to the love scenes in "Elvira Madigan." As near
as I can remember, the theme was something like this:

It was repeated endlessly through each section of the orchestra,
with very little imagination in variation. It is just as well that Mahler's
publisher removed the movement from the First Symphony. In his
later years (Mahler died in 1911 at the age of 51), he wrote more
interesting music; "Blumine," however, I found monotonous.
I expected that the next piece on the program, Bartok's "Violin
Concerto No. 2," would rouse me. I find that Bartok's style is better
suited for small chamber works, such as his superb string quartet's,
than in these larger compositions. Each line of harmony in Bartok is
semi-independent, and while it is possible to concentrate on four
performers, following an entire symphony is more difficult.
Furthermore, Bartok composed his concerti in the traditional style of
the concertaintc, the opposition and struggle between the orchestra
and the soloist. But to this must be added the struggle of the audience
with the complex score, and task may be too great.
The soloist for the Bartok was the fiery Israeli violinist, Ivry Gitlis,
making his second appearance with the Oakland Symphony. He
commands spectacular technique and an expressive style, and was an
excellent choice for the presentation of this piece. Unfortunately, the
Oakland Symphony was not up to it. The concertante disappeared,
with Mr. Gitlis fighting and the Symphony retreating. When the
tempest is taken out of Bartok, there is not much left.

Intermission was followed by Maestro Samuel's contemporary
presentation of the evening, two pieces by Larry Austin, "Open Style
for Orchestra with Piano Soloist" and "Catharsis: Open Style for Two
Improvisation Ensembles, Tapes and Conductor." I am usually
sympathetic to modern pieces, always keeping in mind that musical
tastes change and that no one form of music is intrinsically better
than any other. I reacted favorably to Terry Riley's "In C" last
month; it is a fine experiment in this new style of what I call
non-literate music.
Mr. Austin's pieces, however, deserve only minimal attention. And
if they do merit performance, a musical group with more
improvisational experience than the Oakland Symphony is required.
Robert Floyd, the piano soloist in the works, does qualify, but the
soli ensemble in "Catharsis," of trombone, tenor saxaphone,
vibraphone and piano, had no conception of what Mr. Austin's
direction "improvise now in opposition to the tape and the large
ensemble" meant.
They were like the grammar-school violinist who thinks he is
playing correctly since he cannot hear himself playing wrong notes.
Give Mr. Austin's pieces to the Buddy Rich Band, and we may hear
something worthwhile. In Oakland, they sounded most like the sound
track to the La Brea Tar Pits.

excellent choice for the presentation of this piece. Unfortunately, the
Oakland Symphony was not up to it. The concertante disappeared,
with Mr. Gitlis fighting and the Symphony retreating. When the
tempest is taken out of Bartok, there is not much left.

Intermission was followed by Maestro Samuel's contemporary
presentation of the evening, two pieces by Larry Austin, "Open Style
for Orchestra with Piano Soloist" and "Catharsis: Open Style for Two
Improvisation Ensembles, Tapes and Conductor." I am usually
sympathetic to modern pieces, always keeping in mind that musical
tastes change and that no one form of music is intrinsically better
than any other. I reacted favorably to Terry Riley's "In C" last
month; it is a fine experiment in this new style of what I call
non-literate music.
Mr. Austin's pieces, however, deserve only minimal attention. And
if they do merit performance, a musical group with more
improvisational experience than the Oakland Symphony is required.
Robert Floyd, the piano soloist in the works, does qualify, but the
soli ensemble in "Catharsis," of trombone, tenor saxaphone,
vibraphone and piano, had no conception of what Mr. Austin's
direction "improvise now in opposition to the tape and the large
ensemble" meant.
They were like the grammar-school violinist who thinks he is
playing correctly since he cannot hear himself playing wrong notes.
Give Mr. Austin's pieces to the Buddy Rich Band, and we may hear
something worthwhile. In Oakland, they sounded most like the sound
track to the La Brea Tar Pits.

The Oakland Symphony Orchestra played their second concert of
the season Tuesday night to mild applause and a few anemic boos.
Unlike their opening program last month, when their friends and
enemies were both anxious to show their colors, this audience was,
quite understandably, less enthusiastic.
It is clearly the same Symphony. Maestro Samuel with his full
beard, and the program sporting its share of anti-tradition were all
there. The opening number, Mozart's "Overture to the Magic Flute,"
was a quite normal selection for a symphony orchestra, and the
Oaklanders played competently, although without much sparkle. The
Symphony's strongest point is its sonority, which did give the Mozart
the strength it needs to succeed at all.
The second piece on the program, the one that got me off to such a
bad mood, was the newly-discovered original second movement to
Mahler's "Symphony No. 1." That symphony was originally
conceived of as a tone poem on nature, the beauty of fields, and so
on; the second movement was entitled "Blumine" ("flower piece"),
and is basically a spacious theme-with-variations in a romantic vein. It
is pleasant and soothing, the sort of thing Andre Previn would play for
the background music to the love scenes in "Elvira Madigan." As near
as I can remember, the theme was something like this:

It was repeated endlessly through each section of the orchestra,
with very little imagination in variation. It is just as well that Mahler's
publisher removed the movement from the First Symphony. In his
later years (Mahler died in 1911 at the age of 51), he wrote more
interesting music; "Blumine," however, I found monotonous.
I expected that the next piece on the program, Bartok's "Violin
Concerto No. 2," would rouse me. I find that Bartok's style is better
suited for small chamber works, such as his superb string quartet's,
than in these larger compositions. Each line of harmony in Bartok is
semi-independent, and while it is possible to concentrate on four
performers, following an entire symphony is more difficult.
Furthermore, Bartok composed his concerti in the traditional style of
the concertaintc, the opposition and struggle between the orchestra
and the soloist. But to this must be added the struggle of the audience
with the complex score, and task may be too great.
The soloist for the Bartok was the fiery Israeli violinist, Ivry Gitlis,
making his second appearance with the Oakland Symphony. He
commands spectacular technique and an expressive style, and was an
excellent choice for the presentation of this piece. Unfortunately, the
Oakland Symphony was not up to it. The concertante disappeared,
with Mr. Gitlis fighting and the Symphony retreating. When the
tempest is taken out of Bartok, there is not much left.
