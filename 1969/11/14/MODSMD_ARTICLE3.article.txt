# Salisbury Supports Present War Policy
## 
### BOB MICHELET 
A neutral Asia and a coalition
government in South Vietnam
were envisioned by noted
journalist Harrison Salisbury as he
answered the question "After
Vietnam—What?" in a speech
yesterday.
Salisbury told a near-capacity
crowd at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
that "it is still possible to obtain a
reasonable settlement in Vietnam.
He rejected, however, the
immediate pullout of American
troops.
He said a rapid pullout was not
a practical way to end the war, for
"if we would wipe our hands, turn
our backs and walk away," chaos
would result from the different

factions trying to gain control.
Salisbury also rejected a return
to an all-out military victory
policy as improbable, and said the
country must follow a course
between the two extremes.
'Crucial Point 1 Seen
He noted, however, that
somewhere along the line of
pulling out, there will be a
"crucial point at which the Viet
Cong and North Vietnamese will
challenge the ability of South
Vietnam." "When this comes," he
added, "there will be a real crisis."
The Pulitizer Prize-winner said
that "Vietnamization" of the war
must be accompanied by strong
diplomatic moves in Paris.
