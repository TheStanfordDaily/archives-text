# Salisbury Supports Present War Policy
## 
### BOB MICHELET 
A neutral Asia and a coalition
government in South Vietnam
were envisioned by noted
journalist Harrison Salisbury as he
answered the question "After
Vietnam—What?" in a speech
yesterday.
Salisbury told a near-capacity
crowd at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
that "it is still possible to obtain a
reasonable settlement in Vietnam.
He rejected, however, the
immediate pullout of American
troops.
He said a rapid pullout was not
a practical way to end the war, for
"if we would wipe our hands, turn
our backs and walk away," chaos
would result from the different

factions trying to gain control.
Salisbury also rejected a return
to an all-out military victory
policy as improbable, and said the
country must follow a course
between the two extremes.
'Crucial Point 1 Seen
He noted, however, that
somewhere along the line of
pulling out, there will be a
"crucial point at which the Viet
Cong and North Vietnamese will
challenge the ability of South
Vietnam." "When this comes," he
added, "there will be a real crisis."
The Pulitizer Prize-winner said
that "Vietnamization" of the war
must be accompanied by strong
diplomatic moves in Paris.
Salisbury said the recognition
of a military stalemate in Vietnam
prompted the bombing halt by
President Johnson and the present
negotiations. He cautioned,
however, that the US should not
expect to negotiate a victory it
could not win militarily.
Power Eroded
He charged that the growing
tendency of US public opinion is
to end the war, and that this will
erode our negotiating power. But
the position of the other side,
Salisbury claimed, is also slipping,
due to problems of morale, food,
and industry at home.
He also expressed fears about
the possibility of a war between
Russia and Red China. He added
that the Russian-Chinese tension
is a source of trouble for Hanoi,
because the conflict has held up
some needed shipments of war
supplies. '
Salisbury, who traveled to
North Vietnam three years ago,
said the threat of a Sino-Soviet
war is "perhaps the only factor
that would propel (North

Vietnam) into a settlement in
Paris."
Action Necessary
The United States must take
immediate action to make it clear
to both the Soviet Union and
China that it would not
necessarily side with Russia in the
event of war according to
Salisbury.
In outlining his solution for
Southeast Asia, he charged "we
have been bound and locked into
one position—the defense of the
present South Vietnamese
government," but said this was
wrong.
"We shouldn't .thrust all our
power to this," he added, '-there
is a much better solution."
Neutrality Needed
The solution, Salisbury
maintained, involves the
neutrality of Asia, a condition he
said was common among the
nations in that area. He described
the idea as "the best politically
feasible."
In addition, a coalition
government, with the Viet Cong
as an important factor, would be a
major part of the final solution.

Salisbury charged that
Southeast Asia is "one of the
lowest priority areas of the
worid," and that the United
Statec is not paying attention to
"the problems on the horizon,"
such as the Sino-Soviet split.
Antagonism Noted
Ho said that the traditional
feeling of antagonism for China
among all the Asian peoples is a
factor that should be considered
in future US policy.
He charged "we always think
that we have to impose our
superior wisdom on countries that
know better. We won't be there
forever, but China will."
Salisbury admitted he is
"confused as to what our real
position is in Paris," and said "not
many people (in the
Administration) are thinking of a
broad-scale structure."
"The time has come," he
claimed, "to break the rigidity of
viewpoint. When the signs are
running against you, its time to
grab the bull by the horns and sell
out on a good basis."
