# Employees Group Asks Higher Wages
## 
### 
The fact that Stanford is sixth
in the nation in level of faculty
salaries, but twenty-seventh in the
nation in level of staff salaries was
aong the topics discussed at a
meeting of the United Stanford
Employees Wednesday night.
The group considered problems
of minimum wage, layoffs of
physical plant employees, lack of
staff representation on University
committees dealing with staff
problems, and the rights of staff
to free political expression. The
employees also heard from a
representative of striking
Pittsburgh-Des Miones steel
workers.
The USE had earlier asked for a
$4 50 minimum wage for all
University employees. Stanford
offered $100, or $2.40 per hour.
Julia Harvey, of Pediatrics,
pointed out that a growing staff
concern is the fact that student
help gets paid $1.65, and that if
this student part-time labor pool
is available, staff salaries can be
kept low.
USE members stressed that
"the university couldn't function
without staff, as well as faculty
and students, and it is not fair
that one sector's salaries should be
way up, while another sector's is
way down."

A committee was formed to
talk with the administration, and
to ask for publication of the
official job classification and
salary range lists. This was
reportedly among the "purloined
Encina Hall documents," and the
group is asking the administration
to publish the data without
waiting for clandestine
distribution.

Keith Stutters, a steamfitter
from the physical plant, told the
meeting that layoffs of the
painting and carpentry staffs
would probably not occur, as had
been rumored. Several men have
already left, and these jobs would
simply not be filled, Stutters
reported.
Representation
Another topic of concern was
the lack of staff representation on
a univeristy committee studying
budget cuts. Fran Domby of the
Medical Center reported that the
staff was presently represented by
two members of the Provost's
office, and two members of the
Controllers office. "Do any ol
you people know these men?" she
asked the meeting. After
discussion, the group formed a
committee to investigate means of
getting more acceptable
representatives, who could
articulate concerns of the entire
staff.
This committee would also go
to the ASSU Senate to seek
student support for staff
representation on staff related
committees.
Vonda Black, wife of the
Pittsburgh—Des Moines strike
chairman, told the group that
despite earlier reports that student
support was not welcome, any
help students could give in
collecting food would be
appreciated. She added that the
union wanted students to stay off
the picket lines, "so they won't
get their heads busted." Mrs.
Black then explained the reasons
behind the strike, and asked for
staff support.

is available, staff salaries can be
kept low.
USE members stressed that
"the university couldn't function
without staff, as well as faculty
and students, and it is not fair
that one sector's salaries should be
way up, while another sector's is
way down."

A committee was formed to
talk with the administration, and
to ask for publication of the
official job classification and
salary range lists. This was
reportedly among the "purloined
Encina Hall documents," and the
group is asking the administration
to publish the data without
waiting for clandestine
distribution.

Keith Stutters, a steamfitter
from the physical plant, told the
meeting that layoffs of the
painting and carpentry staffs
would probably not occur, as had
been rumored. Several men have
already left, and these jobs would
simply not be filled, Stutters
reported.
Representation
Another topic of concern was
the lack of staff representation on
a univeristy committee studying
budget cuts. Fran Domby of the
Medical Center reported that the
staff was presently represented by
two members of the Provost's
office, and two members of the
Controllers office. "Do any ol
you people know these men?" she
asked the meeting. After
discussion, the group formed a
committee to investigate means of
getting more acceptable
representatives, who could
articulate concerns of the entire
staff.
This committee would also go
to the ASSU Senate to seek
student support for staff
representation on staff related
committees.
Vonda Black, wife of the
Pittsburgh—Des Moines strike
chairman, told the group that
despite earlier reports that student
support was not welcome, any
help students could give in
collecting food would be
appreciated. She added that the
union wanted students to stay off
the picket lines, "so they won't
get their heads busted." Mrs.
Black then explained the reasons
behind the strike, and asked for
staff support.
The fact that Stanford is sixth
in the nation in level of faculty
salaries, but twenty-seventh in the
nation in level of staff salaries was
aong the topics discussed at a
meeting of the United Stanford
Employees Wednesday night.
The group considered problems
of minimum wage, layoffs of
physical plant employees, lack of
staff representation on University
committees dealing with staff
problems, and the rights of staff
to free political expression. The
employees also heard from a
representative of striking
Pittsburgh-Des Miones steel
workers.
The USE had earlier asked for a
$4 50 minimum wage for all
University employees. Stanford
offered $100, or $2.40 per hour.
Julia Harvey, of Pediatrics,
pointed out that a growing staff
concern is the fact that student
help gets paid $1.65, and that if
this student part-time labor pool
is available, staff salaries can be
kept low.
USE members stressed that
"the university couldn't function
without staff, as well as faculty
and students, and it is not fair
that one sector's salaries should be
way up, while another sector's is
way down."
