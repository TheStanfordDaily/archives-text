The following statement has
been signed by more than 200
members of the Stanford faculty
and staff: "We support the goals
of the Moratorium, November
13-14. Each of us, in his own way,
will express his support on those
days. Some of us will cancel or
reschedule classes; all of us, in
some fashion, will refrain from
'business as usual' in order to
work actively against the war."
A committee to explore the
feasibility of rental housing on
Stanford lands for persons of low
or moderate income has been
appointed by President Kenneth
S. Pitzer.
The committee will work with
Alan S. Maremont of San
Francisco, an independent
housing consultant who has been
retained by the University.

Points for study suggested by
Pitzer included: whom the
housing serves, whether racial
balance be sought as a deliberate
policy, size and configuration of
the development, community
facilities, and university or
nonuniversity ownership and
operation.
