# Sporting Bargain Tomorrow
## 
### FRED LEESON 
If you like your sporting thrills free but not
easy-try the Pacific-8 cross country
championships Saturday morning.
Even if you're not inherently keyed on distance
running, you might be enticed by the prospect oi a
mildly anarchic start, or the joy of 'liberating' the
fairways of the Stanford golf course (to the great
consternation of the Saturday morning Arnie
Palmers who customarily stalk it.)
Not only that, there is no admission.
There will be a race too, of course, and it should
be excellent. To see it, turn right off Junipero
Serra onto Fremont, go just beyond the Big Old
Barn (or whatever) to the second tee, and be there
by 10:30 sharp.
Wild Start
That's when the 56 runners take off in the
first-ever Pac-8 championship, and in a scramble
like that it will clearly be every man to himself.
But comes the hard part: if you hope to see
much of the six miles between the start and finish,
you'll have to be on the move yourself.
Not the whole six miles, naturally, but a
considerable way. The prudent course is to follow
Coaches Clark or Jordon, if you can spot them, as
they know just where to be; otherwise you run the
risk of getting 1) lost, or 2) run over.
In the process you'll get to see some oi the
finest distance runners in the country.
The primary individual race matches wise old
senior Gerry Lindgren from WSU against
precocious Steve Prefontaine, an Oregon freshman
who beat him easily two weeks ago.
Lindgren fans say Gerry fell down, which
obviously affected the outcome; Prefontaine
backers point out that Gerry was beaten so badly
(just over 27 seconds, in lact) that it made no
difference.
But in cross country team performance is more

important than just individuals, and the team
which places its top five men the highest gets the
trip to the NCAA finals where Stanford ran a
surprising second last year.
W ho (lares Who Wins
So let Lindgren and Prefontaine run away with
it; all the teams would be happy to place their men
third through seventh, thank you, even if they
miss lunch to do it. But competition what it is, the
winner will probably have almost all five men
under 30 minutes.
None of the northern teams have met any of the
California teams yet this year, so predicting
finishes is risky. Herewith, then, risky predictions:
Oregon (alas) has excellent depth and
experience behind Mr. Prefontaine, and is clearly
the favorite; Washington State, Stanford and
UCLA are in a category just a few steps behind.
USC and Cal are in the next echelon, and
Oregon State and Washington are in the midst of
"building years," which is more polite than saying
they'll probably be last.
So it seems that a Stanford victory Saturday lies
almost in the realm of the freak.
India 11 s Ready
But Coach Marshall Clark does have his harriers
in top mental and physical condition, and they
have just come off a fine 5-1 dual meet season.
And three runners have been under 30 minutes
on the six-mile home course this season, and the
other two were last year, so they too are definitely
capable of it.
Greg Brock, Chuck Menz, Bob Coe, Don
Kardong, Arvid Kretz, Decker Underwood and
Jack Lawson are all ready for a fine race.
It's free, Saturday at 10:30. It'll be over in a
half an hour, so plenty of time for a leisurely
lunch before Stanford-Air Force later at the
Stadium. Those plank benches will look very
comfortable.


IMPROBABLEâ€”Don't expect Don
Kardong and Chuck Menz to finish in a
dead heat tie for first place in the Pac-8
race tomorrow as (hey did here against
Cal last week. But look for a good race
anyway, featuring many of the nation's
finest distance runners.
