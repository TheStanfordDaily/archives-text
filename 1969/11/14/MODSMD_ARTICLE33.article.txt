# Air Battle Forms As Falcons Invade Farm
## 
### FRED MANN 
For the first time since the
ill-fated trip to Purdue, the
Stanford football team can forget
Pacific-8 opponents and explore
the world outside of the West
Coast when the Air Force
Academy brings their cadets to
The Farm tomorrow.
Game time is 1:30 p.m.. and
the Tribe is a nine point favorite.
For the first time ever, Air
Force is the leading football
power among the service
academies. Army and Navy are
both suffering through miserable
seasons, and officials have
complained that it is getting
tougher all the time to get athletes
to play at Anapolis and West
Point. (Vietnam isn't as appealing
as pro football.)
But the Air Force is on the
upswing. The Falcons have
crashed through the top 20, and
currently hold down the 20 spot
in the AP poll. They are unranked
by UPI. Stanford is 12th in UPI
and 13th in the AP listings.

Coach Ben Martin has been at
the Academy for 12 years, and
has taken the Falcons through all
kinds of seasons. Even before a
class had graduated from the
institution, the Falcons had
compiled an undefeated season
and a Cotton Bowl tie. But that
was in 1958, and there have been
some lean years since then.
This season has been one of the
best. Thirty lettermen returned
from last year's 7-3 squad, and the
offense has been amazingly
powerful. Quarterback Gary
Baxter ranks 13th in total offense
nationally and has been
responsible for 17 TD's.
Baxter, known as "the spider,"
is a fine runner, and concentrates
on sweeps. His receivers are all
good, especially flanker Ernie
Jennings who has caught 47 passes
for eight touchdowns (five of
them last week).
Speedy tailback Curtis Martin
adds to the rushing game, and
fullback Jimmy DeOrio assures
the tough yardage up the middle.

Defensively, linebacker Dennis
Leuthauser leads the Falcons with
76 tackles. He is very quick at his
position, and often finds the
shortest route into enemy
backfields. He also doubles as the
placekicker.
It is with the toe that
Leuthauser is most dangerous. Up
until this season, he held the
NCAA field goal record with a
57-yard boot against Wyoming
last year.
The similarities between
Saturday's opponents are
remarkable. Both teams feature
passing offenses, both have top
ranked quarterbacks (Jim
Plunkett is sixth in the nation in
total offense), and both are
blessed witH fine hard runners.

Game time is 1:30 p.m.. and
the Tribe is a nine point favorite.
For the first time ever, Air
Force is the leading football
power among the service
academies. Army and Navy are
both suffering through miserable
seasons, and officials have
complained that it is getting
tougher all the time to get athletes
to play at Anapolis and West
Point. (Vietnam isn't as appealing
as pro football.)
But the Air Force is on the
upswing. The Falcons have
crashed through the top 20, and
currently hold down the 20 spot
in the AP poll. They are unranked
by UPI. Stanford is 12th in UPI
and 13th in the AP listings.

Coach Ben Martin has been at
the Academy for 12 years, and
has taken the Falcons through all
kinds of seasons. Even before a
class had graduated from the
institution, the Falcons had
compiled an undefeated season
and a Cotton Bowl tie. But that
was in 1958, and there have been
some lean years since then.
This season has been one of the
best. Thirty lettermen returned
from last year's 7-3 squad, and the
offense has been amazingly
powerful. Quarterback Gary
Baxter ranks 13th in total offense
nationally and has been
responsible for 17 TD's.
Baxter, known as "the spider,"
is a fine runner, and concentrates
on sweeps. His receivers are all
good, especially flanker Ernie
Jennings who has caught 47 passes
for eight touchdowns (five of
them last week).
Speedy tailback Curtis Martin
adds to the rushing game, and
fullback Jimmy DeOrio assures
the tough yardage up the middle.

Defensively, linebacker Dennis
Leuthauser leads the Falcons with
76 tackles. He is very quick at his
position, and often finds the
shortest route into enemy
backfields. He also doubles as the
placekicker.
It is with the toe that
Leuthauser is most dangerous. Up
until this season, he held the
NCAA field goal record with a
57-yard boot against Wyoming
last year.
The similarities between
Saturday's opponents are
remarkable. Both teams feature
passing offenses, both have top
ranked quarterbacks (Jim
Plunkett is sixth in the nation in
total offense), and both are
blessed witH fine hard runners.
For the first time since the
ill-fated trip to Purdue, the
Stanford football team can forget
Pacific-8 opponents and explore
the world outside of the West
Coast when the Air Force
Academy brings their cadets to
The Farm tomorrow.
