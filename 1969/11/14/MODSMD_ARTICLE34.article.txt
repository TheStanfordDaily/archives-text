## Bears On Tap 
### 
Stanford's varsity water polo
team closes out its season this
Saturday when they host the
California Bears at 10 a.m. in
Encina Pool. The Indians have a
10-7 overall record but they will
be looking for their first league
victory in six attempts when they
face the Bears.
The Indians have been
hardpressed by injuries to key
men including Wayne Wilson,
Tom Hill, and Rick Eagleston, but
they will be trying hard to come
up with one final big effort.
The Bears have a young team
made up of many freshmen and
transfers, but their solid play this
year has earned them a spot in the
NCAA tournament. The Bears
have also been hit by injuries and

senior star Orb Greenwald is still a
question mark for Saturday's
game.
In two meetings this year, the
Bears and Indians have each won
once. The Cards defeated Cal 9-8
in the Northern California
Invitational, but the Bears beat
the Indians 7-6 in their league
opener. In their victory, the Bears
fought back from a 6-2 defecit to
overcome the Indians.
Regardless of the outcome of
Saturday's game, this year has still
been a promising one for
Stanford. The Indians have a very
young club and with such stars as
Rick Mcssimino and Peter Gadd
returning next year, the future
looks promising.
