## Agnew Blasts TV Networks 
### 
DES MOINES, lowa (AP)- Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew charged
Thursday night that an
unprecedented concentration of
power over American public
opinion is held by a "small and
unelected elite" within the
television industry.
"As with other American
institutions," Agnew suggested,
"perhaps it is time that the

networks were made more
responsive to the views of the
nation and more responsible to
the people they serve."
With one major exception, the
broadcast industry was quick to
reject Agnew's remarks. Some
characterized them as an attempt
at intimidation of and
interference with press freedom.
In a speech before a Midwest
regional Republican committee,
the vice president said
newscasters, commentators and
producers of network news
programs give the American
people a selective and often biased
presentation of the news.
"The people can register their
complaints on bias through mail
to the networks and phone calls
to local stations," said Agnew,
who was interrupted many times
by applause from the audience.
"This is one case where the people
must defend themselves . . . where
the citizen, not the government,
must be the reformer . . . where
the consumer can be the most
effective crusader."
"The American public would
rightly not tolerate this kind of
concentration of power in
government," Agnew said. "Is it
not fair and relevant to question
its concentration in the hands of a
tiny and closed fraternity of
privileged men, elected by no one,
and enjoying a monopoly

sanctioned and licensed by
government?"
The speech was broadcast live
on the three major networks.

Kuhin Freed
CHICAGO (AP) Judge Julius J.
Hoffman rescinded Thursday his
order to jail Jerry C. Rubin for

leaving U.S. District Court during
his trial Wednesday.
Rubin, one of seven persons on
trial on charges of conspiring to
incite rioting at the time of the
Democratic National Convention,
spent the night in Cook County
Jail after his bond was terminated.
He left the courtroom
Wednesday afternoon to fly to
New Brunswick, N.J., for a
speaking engagement. He left with
his lawyer a written waiver of his
right to be present in court, but
the judge ruled that an oral
application to be absent from the
courtroom should have been
made.
William M. Kunstler, a defense
lawyer, argued that Rubin was
absent only 26 minutes and that
he surrendered to U.S. marshals
on learning at O'Hare
International Airport that an
arrest warrant had been issued for
him.
Judge Hoffman said he would
grant the motion but he added: "I
must caution all the defendants
that I expect them to attend every
session. I'm not conducting a
Lyceum Circuit."
His remark about Lyceum
Circuit, an old theater chain, was
related to Kunstler's explanation
that Rubin and other defendants
were required to make speaking
engagements to raise funds for
their defense.
