# March In Capital Calm As Troops Stand By
## 
### ED KOHN 
The atmosphere was tense last
night in the Capital as it braced
for tomorrow's planned March on
Washington. The march is
expected to attract 250,000
anti-war demonstrators as it
climaxes the November
Moratorium and Mobilization
against the Vietnam war.
As the 40-hour March Against
Death began peacefully Thursday
night in Washington, D.C., some
9,000 riot-trained soldiers and
Marines waited nervously outside
the city on instant alert. And the
Capital's government reported
that it had reactivated its riot
command center last night.
Another 28,000 soldiers in
nearby military installations, as
well as 2,000 members of the D.C.
National Guard and 3,800 D.C.
policemen, were also on alert. But
there was little chance of
immediate violence as the first of
45,000 marchers started off in a
silent, candlelight parade across
the Potomac River and into
downtown Washington.
A "mass for peace" ended in
disaster yesterday at the Pentagon
as police moved in and arrested
150 of the demonstrators inside
the building, including the
clergymen present. There was no
violence as the group was quietly
arrested after it had been been
warned that it was obstructing
Pentagon activities. Some of the
participants sang protest songs as
they held a mass in what they
termed "the temple of death."
The 23-year-old widow of a
naval officer killed in the Mekong
Delta led off the 4.2 mile March
Against Death shortly after
sundown. The marchers, who will
slowly walk single-file through the
city, will each carry the name of a
Vietnam casualty. As the
participants pass the White House
on their way down Pennsylvania
Avenue, each will shout out the
name of the soldier he represents.
The march is slated to end in time
for all participants to join
tomorrow's March on Washington.
For the first time since World
War 11, troops will be quartered in
the Department of Justice
building near the White House.
Some government buildings were
being guarded by armed sentries.
The White House has banned all
movement, both vehicular and on
foot, within a block of the
building in anticipation of
the large influx of anti-war
marchers.
Nixon Addresses Congress
The President, who plans to
return to Washington for the
weekend after watching the liftoff
of Apollo 12 at Cape Kennedy,
drew cheers and applause as he
addressed the House and the
Senate separately in two unusual
appearances yesterday.
"I believe that we will achieve a
just peace in Vietnam," he told
the cheering House of
Representatives.
"I cannot tell you the time, the
date, but I do know this: that
when the peace comes, it will
come because of the support that
we have received, not just from
Republicans, but from the
Democrats; from Americans in
this House and in the other body

and throughout the nation," he
said.
Nixon made a similar speech in
the Senate, where much of the
opposition to his Vietnam policies
is centered. He said there that he
was not asking for 100 percent
support "which would not be a
healthy thing" but for all possible
understanding and backing.
Fordham Violence
As expected, support for the
Moratorium was strong on college
campuses, although some students
resorted to violence. At Fordham
University in New York, students
wielded lead pipes as thev turned
back unarmed campus guards
before ending a sit-in. Fourteen
guards were injured before police
arrived. Six demonstrators were
arrested.
In the Fordham protest,
seventy-five students seized an
administration building to protest
the school's ROTC policy. As the
unarmed guards broke through
the barricades of broken furniture
and overturned filing cabinets, the
students began to hit them with
pipes and threw hot water at
them. Two of the guards were
later reported in serious condition
in a Bronx hospital.
At the Milwaukee campus of
the University of Wisconsin,
several dozen demonstrators tried
to take over the ROTC office
behind the cover of a Viet Cong

flag. Nine of the protesters got
inside the building before ROTC
cadets barred their progress. The
nine were arrested and charged
with misconduct in a public place.
At Princeton University, some
100 demonstrators, including
members of the SDS, failed in
their attempt to barricade the
entrance of the Institute for
Defense Analysis (IDA). There
was no violence. The IDA does
most of its research for the
Pentagon. Robert F. Goheen,
president of the university, later
told the demonstrators, "This
university has a contract with IDA
and we shall honor it."
Some students at UCLA
boycotted classes yesterday to
hear a debate on the war. At a
noontime rally, many students
signed up for chartered bus rides
to San Francisco Saturday so they
will be able to participate in the
mass march there.
At USC, more than 300
students "fasted for peace" while
others attended a symbolic
funeral for the war dead.
Folk Music and Speeches
There were rallies, marches,
services and vigils throughout the
nation as thousands participated
in the first of three planned
Moratorium Days. In Atlanta,
more than 200 gathered at the
Capitol to hear folk music and
anti-war speeches. Leaders there
had expected 1,000 people, but
cold, drizzly weather dampened
the turnout.
In New York, 2,000 attended a
rally near Times Square that
featured speeches by Dr.
Benjamin Spock and Sam Brown.
Entertainers at the rally included
Leonard Bernstein, Ozzie Davis,
Peter, Paul and Mary, and the
Broadway cast of "Hair!"
Boston's activities centered
around a "colloquium" sponsored
by the Boston Lawyers Vietnam
Moratorium Committee.
Canvassing also took place.
Elsewhere, twenty-six people
gathered at the St. Joseph, Mo.
Civic Center for a sunrise service
of prayer, readings and song. In
Sacramento, Calif., protesters
began reading the names of the
war dead on the steps of the state
Capitol. Students, mainly from
Brown University, distributed

pamphlets at factories throughout
Rhode Island. In Philadelphia,
train stations, shopping centers
and houses were canvassed.
On Long Island, Senator
Charles E. Goodell (R-N.Y.) told a
college audience, "It does not
serve the cause of peace to indulge
in inflammatory rhetoric that can
only deepen the division in this
nation." And in Wichita, a
coalition group held a silent vigil
in front of the local draft board.

Moratorium Days. In Atlanta,
more than 200 gathered at the
Capitol to hear folk music and
anti-war speeches. Leaders there
had expected 1,000 people, but
cold, drizzly weather dampened
the turnout.
In New York, 2,000 attended a
rally near Times Square that
featured speeches by Dr.
Benjamin Spock and Sam Brown.
Entertainers at the rally included
Leonard Bernstein, Ozzie Davis,
Peter, Paul and Mary, and the
Broadway cast of "Hair!"
Boston's activities centered
around a "colloquium" sponsored
by the Boston Lawyers Vietnam
Moratorium Committee.
Canvassing also took place.
Elsewhere, twenty-six people
gathered at the St. Joseph, Mo.
Civic Center for a sunrise service
of prayer, readings and song. In
Sacramento, Calif., protesters
began reading the names of the
war dead on the steps of the state
Capitol. Students, mainly from
Brown University, distributed

pamphlets at factories throughout
Rhode Island. In Philadelphia,
train stations, shopping centers
and houses were canvassed.
On Long Island, Senator
Charles E. Goodell (R-N.Y.) told a
college audience, "It does not
serve the cause of peace to indulge
in inflammatory rhetoric that can
only deepen the division in this
nation." And in Wichita, a
coalition group held a silent vigil
in front of the local draft board.
The atmosphere was tense last
night in the Capital as it braced
for tomorrow's planned March on
Washington. The march is
expected to attract 250,000
anti-war demonstrators as it
climaxes the November
Moratorium and Mobilization
against the Vietnam war.
As the 40-hour March Against
Death began peacefully Thursday
night in Washington, D.C., some
9,000 riot-trained soldiers and
Marines waited nervously outside
the city on instant alert. And the
Capital's government reported
that it had reactivated its riot
command center last night.
Another 28,000 soldiers in
nearby military installations, as
well as 2,000 members of the D.C.
National Guard and 3,800 D.C.
policemen, were also on alert. But
there was little chance of
immediate violence as the first of
45,000 marchers started off in a
silent, candlelight parade across
the Potomac River and into
downtown Washington.
A "mass for peace" ended in
disaster yesterday at the Pentagon
as police moved in and arrested
150 of the demonstrators inside
the building, including the
clergymen present. There was no
violence as the group was quietly
arrested after it had been been
warned that it was obstructing
Pentagon activities. Some of the
participants sang protest songs as
they held a mass in what they
termed "the temple of death."
The 23-year-old widow of a
naval officer killed in the Mekong
Delta led off the 4.2 mile March
Against Death shortly after
sundown. The marchers, who will
slowly walk single-file through the
city, will each carry the name of a
Vietnam casualty. As the
participants pass the White House
on their way down Pennsylvania
Avenue, each will shout out the
name of the soldier he represents.
The march is slated to end in time
for all participants to join
tomorrow's March on Washington.
For the first time since World
War 11, troops will be quartered in
the Department of Justice
building near the White House.
Some government buildings were
being guarded by armed sentries.
The White House has banned all
movement, both vehicular and on
foot, within a block of the
building in anticipation of
the large influx of anti-war
marchers.
Nixon Addresses Congress
The President, who plans to
return to Washington for the
weekend after watching the liftoff
of Apollo 12 at Cape Kennedy,
drew cheers and applause as he
addressed the House and the
Senate separately in two unusual
appearances yesterday.
"I believe that we will achieve a
just peace in Vietnam," he told
the cheering House of
Representatives.
"I cannot tell you the time, the
date, but I do know this: that
when the peace comes, it will
come because of the support that
we have received, not just from
Republicans, but from the
Democrats; from Americans in
this House and in the other body

and throughout the nation," he
said.
Nixon made a similar speech in
the Senate, where much of the
opposition to his Vietnam policies
is centered. He said there that he
was not asking for 100 percent
support "which would not be a
healthy thing" but for all possible
understanding and backing.
Fordham Violence
As expected, support for the
Moratorium was strong on college
campuses, although some students
resorted to violence. At Fordham
University in New York, students
wielded lead pipes as thev turned
back unarmed campus guards
before ending a sit-in. Fourteen
guards were injured before police
arrived. Six demonstrators were
arrested.
In the Fordham protest,
seventy-five students seized an
administration building to protest
the school's ROTC policy. As the
unarmed guards broke through
the barricades of broken furniture
and overturned filing cabinets, the
students began to hit them with
pipes and threw hot water at
them. Two of the guards were
later reported in serious condition
in a Bronx hospital.
At the Milwaukee campus of
the University of Wisconsin,
several dozen demonstrators tried
to take over the ROTC office
behind the cover of a Viet Cong

flag. Nine of the protesters got
inside the building before ROTC
cadets barred their progress. The
nine were arrested and charged
with misconduct in a public place.
At Princeton University, some
100 demonstrators, including
members of the SDS, failed in
their attempt to barricade the
entrance of the Institute for
Defense Analysis (IDA). There
was no violence. The IDA does
most of its research for the
Pentagon. Robert F. Goheen,
president of the university, later
told the demonstrators, "This
university has a contract with IDA
and we shall honor it."
Some students at UCLA
boycotted classes yesterday to
hear a debate on the war. At a
noontime rally, many students
signed up for chartered bus rides
to San Francisco Saturday so they
will be able to participate in the
mass march there.
At USC, more than 300
students "fasted for peace" while
others attended a symbolic
funeral for the war dead.

pipes and threw hot water at
them. Two of the guards were
later reported in serious condition
in a Bronx hospital.
At the Milwaukee campus of
the University of Wisconsin,
several dozen demonstrators tried
to take over the ROTC office
behind the cover of a Viet Cong

flag. Nine of the protesters got
inside the building before ROTC
cadets barred their progress. The
nine were arrested and charged
with misconduct in a public place.
At Princeton University, some
100 demonstrators, including
members of the SDS, failed in
their attempt to barricade the
entrance of the Institute for
Defense Analysis (IDA). There
was no violence. The IDA does
most of its research for the
Pentagon. Robert F. Goheen,
president of the university, later
told the demonstrators, "This
university has a contract with IDA
and we shall honor it."
Some students at UCLA
boycotted classes yesterday to
hear a debate on the war. At a
noontime rally, many students
signed up for chartered bus rides
to San Francisco Saturday so they
will be able to participate in the
mass march there.
At USC, more than 300
students "fasted for peace" while
others attended a symbolic
funeral for the war dead.
Folk Music and Speeches
There were rallies, marches,
services and vigils throughout the
nation as thousands participated
in the first of three planned
Moratorium Days. In Atlanta,
more than 200 gathered at the
Capitol to hear folk music and
anti-war speeches. Leaders there
had expected 1,000 people, but
cold, drizzly weather dampened
the turnout.
In New York, 2,000 attended a
rally near Times Square that
featured speeches by Dr.
Benjamin Spock and Sam Brown.
Entertainers at the rally included
Leonard Bernstein, Ozzie Davis,
Peter, Paul and Mary, and the
Broadway cast of "Hair!"
Boston's activities centered
around a "colloquium" sponsored
by the Boston Lawyers Vietnam
Moratorium Committee.
Canvassing also took place.
Elsewhere, twenty-six people
gathered at the St. Joseph, Mo.
Civic Center for a sunrise service
of prayer, readings and song. In
Sacramento, Calif., protesters
began reading the names of the
war dead on the steps of the state
Capitol. Students, mainly from
Brown University, distributed

pamphlets at factories throughout
Rhode Island. In Philadelphia,
train stations, shopping centers
and houses were canvassed.
On Long Island, Senator
Charles E. Goodell (R-N.Y.) told a
college audience, "It does not
serve the cause of peace to indulge
in inflammatory rhetoric that can
only deepen the division in this
nation." And in Wichita, a
coalition group held a silent vigil
in front of the local draft board.
The atmosphere was tense last
night in the Capital as it braced
for tomorrow's planned March on
Washington. The march is
expected to attract 250,000
anti-war demonstrators as it
climaxes the November
Moratorium and Mobilization
against the Vietnam war.
As the 40-hour March Against
Death began peacefully Thursday
night in Washington, D.C., some
9,000 riot-trained soldiers and
Marines waited nervously outside
the city on instant alert. And the
Capital's government reported
that it had reactivated its riot
command center last night.
Another 28,000 soldiers in
nearby military installations, as
well as 2,000 members of the D.C.
National Guard and 3,800 D.C.
policemen, were also on alert. But
there was little chance of
immediate violence as the first of
45,000 marchers started off in a
silent, candlelight parade across
the Potomac River and into
downtown Washington.
A "mass for peace" ended in
disaster yesterday at the Pentagon
as police moved in and arrested
150 of the demonstrators inside
the building, including the
clergymen present. There was no
violence as the group was quietly
arrested after it had been been
warned that it was obstructing
Pentagon activities. Some of the
participants sang protest songs as
they held a mass in what they
termed "the temple of death."
The 23-year-old widow of a
naval officer killed in the Mekong
Delta led off the 4.2 mile March
Against Death shortly after
sundown. The marchers, who will
slowly walk single-file through the
city, will each carry the name of a
Vietnam casualty. As the
participants pass the White House
on their way down Pennsylvania
Avenue, each will shout out the
name of the soldier he represents.
The march is slated to end in time
for all participants to join
tomorrow's March on Washington.
For the first time since World
War 11, troops will be quartered in
the Department of Justice
building near the White House.
Some government buildings were
being guarded by armed sentries.
The White House has banned all
movement, both vehicular and on
foot, within a block of the
building in anticipation of
the large influx of anti-war
marchers.
Nixon Addresses Congress
The President, who plans to
return to Washington for the
weekend after watching the liftoff
of Apollo 12 at Cape Kennedy,
drew cheers and applause as he
addressed the House and the
Senate separately in two unusual
appearances yesterday.
"I believe that we will achieve a
just peace in Vietnam," he told
the cheering House of
Representatives.
"I cannot tell you the time, the
date, but I do know this: that
when the peace comes, it will
come because of the support that
we have received, not just from
Republicans, but from the
Democrats; from Americans in
this House and in the other body

and throughout the nation," he
said.
Nixon made a similar speech in
the Senate, where much of the
opposition to his Vietnam policies
is centered. He said there that he
was not asking for 100 percent
support "which would not be a
healthy thing" but for all possible
understanding and backing.
Fordham Violence
As expected, support for the
Moratorium was strong on college
campuses, although some students
resorted to violence. At Fordham
University in New York, students
wielded lead pipes as thev turned
back unarmed campus guards
before ending a sit-in. Fourteen
guards were injured before police
arrived. Six demonstrators were
arrested.
In the Fordham protest,
seventy-five students seized an
administration building to protest
the school's ROTC policy. As the
unarmed guards broke through
the barricades of broken furniture
and overturned filing cabinets, the
students began to hit them with
pipes and threw hot water at
them. Two of the guards were
later reported in serious condition
in a Bronx hospital.
At the Milwaukee campus of
the University of Wisconsin,
several dozen demonstrators tried

drew cheers and applause as he
addressed the House and the
Senate separately in two unusual
appearances yesterday.
"I believe that we will achieve a
just peace in Vietnam," he told
the cheering House of
Representatives.
"I cannot tell you the time, the
date, but I do know this: that
when the peace comes, it will
come because of the support that
we have received, not just from
Republicans, but from the
Democrats; from Americans in
this House and in the other body

and throughout the nation," he
said.
Nixon made a similar speech in
the Senate, where much of the
opposition to his Vietnam policies
is centered. He said there that he
was not asking for 100 percent
support "which would not be a
healthy thing" but for all possible
understanding and backing.
Fordham Violence
As expected, support for the
Moratorium was strong on college
campuses, although some students
resorted to violence. At Fordham
University in New York, students
wielded lead pipes as thev turned
back unarmed campus guards
before ending a sit-in. Fourteen
guards were injured before police
arrived. Six demonstrators were
arrested.
In the Fordham protest,
seventy-five students seized an
administration building to protest
the school's ROTC policy. As the
unarmed guards broke through
the barricades of broken furniture
and overturned filing cabinets, the
students began to hit them with
pipes and threw hot water at
them. Two of the guards were
later reported in serious condition
in a Bronx hospital.
At the Milwaukee campus of
the University of Wisconsin,
several dozen demonstrators tried
to take over the ROTC office
behind the cover of a Viet Cong

flag. Nine of the protesters got
inside the building before ROTC
cadets barred their progress. The
nine were arrested and charged
with misconduct in a public place.
At Princeton University, some
100 demonstrators, including
members of the SDS, failed in
their attempt to barricade the
entrance of the Institute for
Defense Analysis (IDA). There
was no violence. The IDA does
most of its research for the
Pentagon. Robert F. Goheen,
president of the university, later
told the demonstrators, "This
university has a contract with IDA
and we shall honor it."
Some students at UCLA
boycotted classes yesterday to
hear a debate on the war. At a
noontime rally, many students
signed up for chartered bus rides
to San Francisco Saturday so they
will be able to participate in the
mass march there.
At USC, more than 300
students "fasted for peace" while
others attended a symbolic
funeral for the war dead.
Folk Music and Speeches
There were rallies, marches,
services and vigils throughout the
nation as thousands participated
in the first of three planned
Moratorium Days. In Atlanta,
more than 200 gathered at the
Capitol to hear folk music and
anti-war speeches. Leaders there
had expected 1,000 people, but
cold, drizzly weather dampened
the turnout.
In New York, 2,000 attended a
rally near Times Square that
featured speeches by Dr.
Benjamin Spock and Sam Brown.
Entertainers at the rally included
Leonard Bernstein, Ozzie Davis,
Peter, Paul and Mary, and the
Broadway cast of "Hair!"
Boston's activities centered
around a "colloquium" sponsored
by the Boston Lawyers Vietnam
Moratorium Committee.
Canvassing also took place.
Elsewhere, twenty-six people
gathered at the St. Joseph, Mo.
Civic Center for a sunrise service
of prayer, readings and song. In
Sacramento, Calif., protesters
began reading the names of the
war dead on the steps of the state
Capitol. Students, mainly from
Brown University, distributed

pamphlets at factories throughout
Rhode Island. In Philadelphia,
train stations, shopping centers
and houses were canvassed.
On Long Island, Senator
Charles E. Goodell (R-N.Y.) told a
college audience, "It does not
serve the cause of peace to indulge
in inflammatory rhetoric that can
only deepen the division in this
nation." And in Wichita, a
coalition group held a silent vigil
in front of the local draft board.
