# BSU Attacks Arena, Cites Racism, Libel

### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Angry Black Student Union
(BSU) leaders lashed out at
yesterday's edition of the Arena
and warned "the BSU will take
whatever steps are necessary to
prevent the Arena from its
pursuits of libeling and slandering
Black People."
BSU member and ASSU Senate
chairman Dave Edwards termed
the Arena's lead article by Roger
Reed attacking the student Senate
"ludicrous." Edwards declared,
"If anyone's contributing to
polarization on campus, it's the
Arena."
In a statement issued by
Edwards and BSU members
Johnnie Scott and Buff Parham,
the group declared, "We do not
oppose the right of the Arena and
FCM (Free Campus
Movement) ... to expound its
political views. However, when
Black People are drawn into
harm's way, we as Black People
must take the initiative to insure
our own survival."
Ycllow Journalists
Parham declared, "They're not
libertarian. They're authoritarian,
fascist, yellow journalists."
After a welter of BSU charges
and Arena counter-charges, the
editors of the conservative
newspaper stood by their original
articles.
"My article in the Arena is
factually accurate on every point.
I maintain that the ASSU Senate
is not representative of the
Stanford student body and that
the Senate has to cope with a

powerful coalition oi r>oU
members and white radicals.
Threats and name-calling will not
change my mind," Reed said last
night.
Intimidation and Coercion
Arena writer Harvey Hukari
stated, "I am disturbed by the
intimidation and coercion that is
implicit in the statement.issued by
the BSU with respect to the
contents of our current issue. In
so far as Mr. Reed's article is an
honest and factual expression of
legitimate opinion, I defend its
publication. The Black Student
Union is not and should not be
above fair comment and
criticism."
BSU spokesman Edwards was
angered over Arena charges of
"intimidation" in the student
Senate elections and comments
that the Senate was "dramatically
unrepresentative." BSU member
Johnnie Scott also bitterly
criticized a "Shockley-type"
picture and accompanying
statement.
Edwards disputed Arena claims
that "the Hare system of
voting . . . gives decisive advantage
to candidates running on a slate."
According to Edwards, "The Hare
system isn't conducive to block
voting. If one candidate is popular
enough, he can easily buck this
system."
Senate Campaign Intimidation
BSU members also disputed
Arena claims that the black group
used "intimidation in the
campaign [for the Senate |." The
Arena cited part of the BSU's
campaign leaflet stating "if the
normal channels do not work, we
are more than certain that we can
find some abnormal channels that
will."
Said Edwards, "Since when has
'abnormal channels' always
equaled violence? The
Moratorium is abnormal and not
violent. Most dissent is
abnormal."
BSU vice-chairman Buff
Parham denied the Arena's claim
that "The typical [Senate]
meeting turns out to be merely a
formal rubber-stamping of
decisions previously made by the
BSU-white radical alliance."
Parham pointed to the Senate's
vote to change its position on the
Moratorium and support President
Pitzer. "Blacks are not always
assured of victory," he said.
Tuesday Night Vote
However. Reed stated he wrote
his article before the Tuesday
night Senate vote.
Edwards claimed that he was
not salaried by the BSU or the
Senate. But Reed replied,
"Edwards is in fact authorized
through the current ASSU
emergency appropriation to
receive a salary as a Coordinator
of the BSU."
Chairman Edwards also
defended his appointments to
Senate committees. "Are blacks
incapable of making just decisions
because they are black?" Reed
claimed "The Daily of Nov. 12
reports that Chairman Edwards
himself said 'I'm biased' and feels
that the BSU deserves the most
ASSU funds of all twenty-odd
organizations financed by the
Senate."
BSU chairman Leo Bazile
commented last night, "With
V'Uiiuiiui u ii wm »
respect to the Senate 1 would like
to point out that every member of
this body has a mandate from the
people. That they were elected by
one one-third of the student body
says something about the so-called
silent majority.
Senate Very Representative
"Contrary to the Arena's
yowling, the Senate is very
representative ... I remember
their jabber last year about
rational dialogue, normal
channels, etc. . . . Now these same
crackers are telling you that

because niggers are winning
according to white folks rules,
that those rules ought to be
changed . . .
"The BSU has been relatively
quiet up until now because we
have no desire to polarize this
campus. But since the Arena has
seen fit to throw down the
gauntlet we say, 'Right on.' "

stated, "I am disturbed by the
intimidation and coercion that is
implicit in the statement.issued by
the BSU with respect to the
contents of our current issue. In
so far as Mr. Reed's article is an
honest and factual expression of
legitimate opinion, I defend its
publication. The Black Student
Union is not and should not be
above fair comment and
criticism."
BSU spokesman Edwards was
angered over Arena charges of
"intimidation" in the student
Senate elections and comments
that the Senate was "dramatically
unrepresentative." BSU member
Johnnie Scott also bitterly
criticized a "Shockley-type"
picture and accompanying
statement.
Edwards disputed Arena claims
that "the Hare system of
voting . . . gives decisive advantage
to candidates running on a slate."
According to Edwards, "The Hare
system isn't conducive to block
voting. If one candidate is popular
enough, he can easily buck this
system."
Senate Campaign Intimidation
BSU members also disputed
Arena claims that the black group
used "intimidation in the
campaign [for the Senate |." The
Arena cited part of the BSU's
campaign leaflet stating "if the
normal channels do not work, we
are more than certain that we can
find some abnormal channels that
will."
Said Edwards, "Since when has
'abnormal channels' always
equaled violence? The
Moratorium is abnormal and not
violent. Most dissent is
abnormal."
BSU vice-chairman Buff
Parham denied the Arena's claim
that "The typical [Senate]
meeting turns out to be merely a
formal rubber-stamping of
decisions previously made by the
BSU-white radical alliance."
Parham pointed to the Senate's
vote to change its position on the
Moratorium and support President
Pitzer. "Blacks are not always
assured of victory," he said.
Tuesday Night Vote
However. Reed stated he wrote
his article before the Tuesday
night Senate vote.
Edwards claimed that he was
not salaried by the BSU or the
Senate. But Reed replied,
"Edwards is in fact authorized
through the current ASSU
emergency appropriation to
receive a salary as a Coordinator
of the BSU."
Chairman Edwards also
defended his appointments to
Senate committees. "Are blacks
incapable of making just decisions
because they are black?" Reed
claimed "The Daily of Nov. 12
reports that Chairman Edwards
himself said 'I'm biased' and feels
that the BSU deserves the most
ASSU funds of all twenty-odd
organizations financed by the
Senate."
BSU chairman Leo Bazile
commented last night, "With
V'Uiiuiiui u ii wm »
respect to the Senate 1 would like
to point out that every member of
this body has a mandate from the
people. That they were elected by
one one-third of the student body
says something about the so-called
silent majority.
Senate Very Representative
"Contrary to the Arena's
yowling, the Senate is very
representative ... I remember
their jabber last year about
rational dialogue, normal
channels, etc. . . . Now these same
crackers are telling you that

because niggers are winning
according to white folks rules,
that those rules ought to be
changed . . .
"The BSU has been relatively
quiet up until now because we
have no desire to polarize this
campus. But since the Arena has
seen fit to throw down the
gauntlet we say, 'Right on.' "
Angry Black Student Union
(BSU) leaders lashed out at
yesterday's edition of the Arena
and warned "the BSU will take
whatever steps are necessary to
prevent the Arena from its
pursuits of libeling and slandering
Black People."
BSU member and ASSU Senate
chairman Dave Edwards termed
the Arena's lead article by Roger
Reed attacking the student Senate
"ludicrous." Edwards declared,
"If anyone's contributing to
polarization on campus, it's the
Arena."
In a statement issued by
Edwards and BSU members
Johnnie Scott and Buff Parham,
the group declared, "We do not
oppose the right of the Arena and
FCM (Free Campus
Movement) ... to expound its
political views. However, when
Black People are drawn into
harm's way, we as Black People
must take the initiative to insure
our own survival."
Ycllow Journalists
Parham declared, "They're not
libertarian. They're authoritarian,
fascist, yellow journalists."
After a welter of BSU charges
and Arena counter-charges, the
editors of the conservative
newspaper stood by their original
articles.
"My article in the Arena is
factually accurate on every point.
I maintain that the ASSU Senate
is not representative of the
Stanford student body and that
the Senate has to cope with a

powerful coalition oi r>oU
members and white radicals.

change my mind," Reed said last

formal rubber-stamping of
decisions previously made by the
BSU-white radical alliance."
Parham pointed to the Senate's
vote to change its position on the
Moratorium and support President
Pitzer. "Blacks are not always
assured of victory," he said.
Tuesday Night Vote
However. Reed stated he wrote
his article before the Tuesday
night Senate vote.
Edwards claimed that he was
not salaried by the BSU or the
Senate. But Reed replied,
"Edwards is in fact authorized
through the current ASSU
emergency appropriation to
receive a salary as a Coordinator
of the BSU."
Chairman Edwards also
defended his appointments to
Senate committees. "Are blacks
incapable of making just decisions
because they are black?" Reed
claimed "The Daily of Nov. 12
reports that Chairman Edwards
himself said 'I'm biased' and feels
that the BSU deserves the most
ASSU funds of all twenty-odd
organizations financed by the
Senate."
BSU chairman Leo Bazile
commented last night, "With
V'Uiiuiiui u ii wm »
respect to the Senate 1 would like
to point out that every member of
this body has a mandate from the
people. That they were elected by
one one-third of the student body
says something about the so-called
silent majority.
Senate Very Representative
"Contrary to the Arena's
yowling, the Senate is very
representative ... I remember
their jabber last year about
rational dialogue, normal
channels, etc. . . . Now these same
crackers are telling you that

because niggers are winning
according to white folks rules,
that those rules ought to be
changed . . .
"The BSU has been relatively
quiet up until now because we
have no desire to polarize this
campus. But since the Arena has
seen fit to throw down the
gauntlet we say, 'Right on.' "
Angry Black Student Union
(BSU) leaders lashed out at
yesterday's edition of the Arena
and warned "the BSU will take
whatever steps are necessary to
prevent the Arena from its
pursuits of libeling and slandering
Black People."
BSU member and ASSU Senate
chairman Dave Edwards termed
the Arena's lead article by Roger
Reed attacking the student Senate
"ludicrous." Edwards declared,
"If anyone's contributing to
polarization on campus, it's the
Arena."
In a statement issued by
Edwards and BSU members
Johnnie Scott and Buff Parham,
the group declared, "We do not
oppose the right of the Arena and
FCM (Free Campus
Movement) ... to expound its
political views. However, when
Black People are drawn into
harm's way, we as Black People
must take the initiative to insure
our own survival."
Ycllow Journalists
Parham declared, "They're not
libertarian. They're authoritarian,
fascist, yellow journalists."
After a welter of BSU charges
and Arena counter-charges, the
editors of the conservative
newspaper stood by their original
articles.
"My article in the Arena is
factually accurate on every point.
I maintain that the ASSU Senate
is not representative of the
Stanford student body and that
the Senate has to cope with a

powerful coalition oi r>oU
members and white radicals.
Threats and name-calling will not
change my mind," Reed said last
night.
Intimidation and Coercion
Arena writer Harvey Hukari
stated, "I am disturbed by the
intimidation and coercion that is
implicit in the statement.issued by
the BSU with respect to the
contents of our current issue. In
so far as Mr. Reed's article is an
honest and factual expression of
legitimate opinion, I defend its
publication. The Black Student
Union is not and should not be
above fair comment and
criticism."
BSU spokesman Edwards was
angered over Arena charges of
"intimidation" in the student
Senate elections and comments
that the Senate was "dramatically
unrepresentative." BSU member
Johnnie Scott also bitterly
criticized a "Shockley-type"
picture and accompanying
statement.
Edwards disputed Arena claims
that "the Hare system of
voting . . . gives decisive advantage
to candidates running on a slate."
According to Edwards, "The Hare
system isn't conducive to block
voting. If one candidate is popular
enough, he can easily buck this
system."
Senate Campaign Intimidation
BSU members also disputed
Arena claims that the black group
used "intimidation in the
campaign [for the Senate |." The
Arena cited part of the BSU's
campaign leaflet stating "if the
normal channels do not work, we
are more than certain that we can
find some abnormal channels that
will."
Said Edwards, "Since when has
'abnormal channels' always
equaled violence? The
Moratorium is abnormal and not
violent. Most dissent is
abnormal."
BSU vice-chairman Buff
Parham denied the Arena's claim
that "The typical [Senate]
meeting turns out to be merely a
formal rubber-stamping of
decisions previously made by the
BSU-white radical alliance."
Parham pointed to the Senate's
