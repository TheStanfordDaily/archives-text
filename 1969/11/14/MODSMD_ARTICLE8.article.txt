Cold Reality
The following is a letter received
from the brother of Stanford student,
Bill Durham. Under the pressure of I-A
status shortly after graduation from
Ohio Slate Jim Durham enlisted in the
army. These are his remarks.
Brudder Bill:
How you been. Been studying
hard, sitting there in those warm
sunny California days? Been on
any of those weekend adventures
down the beach or up the
mountains to write, etc. Hope you
have.
Hope you don't have to do any
of this shit, ever.
Stuck out here in weirdo
red-neck country—Missouri. If
you ever get to see Easy Rider,
please go.
Anyway, I'm on guard duty
tonight, 1:00 to 3:00 (A.M.) It's
cold and windy in this miserable
state. The Army is a great life,
patterned after the ancient
Greeks—mostly those from Sparta.
A trainee in Basic Training has less
rights than a POW. First two
weeks were classes, First Aid,

Military justice, movies about
POW's etc.
Now until Dec. 14 we'll be
outside all day. From 5:00 to
5:00, we run and jump, turn and
bounce, march and yell, push-up
and pull down, police the ground
and stand in line. But its an
adventure. Each day is an
incredible experience. It's a game;
it's comical.
There are professionals in here.
To thorn this is an extension of
the manly life of the warrior. At
an orientation session a sergeant
told us that "Vietnam was our
only war right now, don't knock
it." Most of the training sergeants
have spent time in Vietnam. Its
probably hard to adjust after what
happens there. This training base
is a place where Army lets its
hardened soldiers cool-off.
Tomorrow we march out to the
woods and shoot guns, eat on tin
plates, etc.
Would greatly appreciate any
reading material you could send.
No way to get literature type
paper backs here. Need an escape.

Daily Staffers
Editor THE DAILY:
Your expose of the inequities
in faculty salaries in recent weeks
was most revealing and thought
provoking. Yesterday's release of
the pay scale of the Daily staffers
also uncovered gross injustices on
campus. Daily staffers are plagued
with overwork, underpay, and
continual harassment from the
libertarian elements on campus.
Physician, heal thyself.

Krute's Two Heads
Editor, THE DAILY
The two-headed cartoon of Dr.
Pitzer implies, I take it,
inconsistency of the two
statements quoted there. If that is
so, I suggest that Mr. Krute
examine his logic. The two quotes
are completely consistent, one a
statement of personal political
opinion, the other an expression
of institutional policy.

Notes on Pi It
Editor, THE DAILY:
A footnote to the Pill Policy
controversy:
The Cowell practice as I have
experienced it is to withhold
contraceptive prescription and
attendant gynocological care to the
unwed, not simply to unwed
minors. A graduate student in my
mid-twenties and divorced after
four years of marriage, I was
refused examination and pill
prescription at the Center. I think
this action indicates that
University policy is informed by
the desire of conservative elements
to legislate morality for the
community as a whole, and not
simply by its feeling of
responsibility to a group of
concerned parents. I urge President
Pitzer to resist such pernicious
authoritarianism and to provide
through the University for the
legitimate contraceptive and
gynecological health needs of all its
women.

Nixon Letter
Dear Mr. Diaiyiond: Your open
letter to President Nixon in
today's Daily (and I often do not
agree with the Daily!!) is
absolutely excellent. You could
not have expressed the feeling of
what I am still convinced is a
silent majority—those who think
we should "get out of
Vietnam"—more explicitly.
Particularly I liked your
paragraph, "May I suggest, sir,
that you have become so obsessed
with the international
implications . .
Won't you please send this
letter to the S.F. Chronicle, to the
Wall Street Journal, and perhaps
to some other national
publications such as LIKE,
TIME . . .? It deserves a wide
audience.
Our .national commitment
should be, .to our own sons, not to
some vague "commitment" to any
other country. I have sent a wire
to President Nixon giving this
comment on his speech.
Mrs. Elisabeth Pforr
Your i'acts are 100% rieht!
'Leaves of Absence'
Editor, THE DAILY:
Under "Leaves of Absence,"
Guide Memo 22.7,3 d states
"Regular employees may take
time off for essential personal
business when authorized by their
immediate supervisor.
Non-exempt employees must
charge time off in excess of two
hours to vacation leave, leave
without pay, or make up the time
lost without working overtime."
There will be a march and rally
in the Industrial Park this
afternoon which will take about
an hour and a half. Employees
who are interested in stopping the
war but cannot afford a loss of a
day of pay or vacation might use
the above provision and join us
this noon.
