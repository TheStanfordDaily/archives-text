# Hopes For More Progress
## Concerns Still Deep 
### J.M. Pettit 
Last month I joined other
faculty in support of the October
15 Moratorium, which seemed to
afford a special opportunity for
expressions of dissatisfaction with
the slow progress in the "winding
down" of the war in Vietnam.
The October 15 statement called
for a "quick end" to the killing. It
left room for a range of personal
views—from that of immediate
withdrawal to that of a slower but
certainly not indefinite
timetable—and in any case
"quicker" than any plan then
evident. It required no
endorsement of any or all
demonstrations as such.
The concept of a concerted
monthly expression of concern
seemed attractive—expression on
one matter only: Vietnam—ex
pression according to individual
belief as to how one might most
effectively influence decision
making in Washington. My own
Moratorium preference is to set
aside "business as usual" long
enough to update and express my
own thoughts, including
forwarding them to a number of
persons in the Capitol, lest they
claim me as part of the "silent
majority."
I must say, however, that I
believe it is unsound to escalate
the Moratorium activities by an
added day each month. It seems
to me that impact will be diluted,
and that in order to fill the days
there may be digression into
peripheral and divisive actions. I

hope that realism will prevail, so
that broad support will be
attracted, not repelled.
Here we are at the end of the
first month. What has transpired?
In spite of earlier indications, the
President is clearly aware of and
not unmoved by the evident
dissent. He does not brush it
rudely aside as some other elected
officials have done. He has
announced the intented
replacement of the Director of
Selective Service, and on
November 3 he went to some
effort to present a nationwide
report and a plan on Vietnam. It
seems unlikely that these events
were totally unrelated to the
dissent.
Loss Than Convincing
After listening carefully to the
President, it seems to me that the
plan is less than adequately
convincing. I am not a military or
political expert, but the President
was surely seeking to persuade the
non-expert. Perhaps he would
have been more convincing in an
earlier year. While one might not
expect him to announce a rigid,
week-by-week timetable, it wasn't
explicit whether he intends to
"Vietnamize" the struggle in a
month, a year or a decade.
It seems to me that it must be
important for others than
President Nixon and Theiu to
know what the broad time scale is
to be. There seems to be reason
enough to believe that the Thieu
regime does not have adequate

support of the people of South
Vietnam, and that the regime
persists because of the strength of
the American presence. Then
should not the people of South
Vietnam know that within a year,
say, there must have evolved a
compromise government which
would survive the reality of the
NLF and North Vietnam?
Otherwise isn't the "bloodbath"
problem merely postponed?
Moreover, shouldn't the Viet
Cong and North Vietnam also
know whether the time scale is
long or short?lf it is not known
to be short, what is their incentive
to de-escalate?
More Detailed Plans
Finally, will not many
Americans want to know far
better about that time scale, if
they are to be sure that the Nixon
plan is truly different from the
Johnson plan?lt is not a question
of doubting the President's
sincerity; it is a question as to
whether that is enough after these
long years.
It would have helped if there
had been announced a
continuation of troop
withdrawals. It would have helped
if there had been actually
appointed a new Selective Service
Director.
Regretfully I find that in
November 1969 my concerns are
still deep, and 1 hope that another
month will reveal more progress.
