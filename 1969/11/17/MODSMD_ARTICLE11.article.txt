# Voluntary Student Body Fees?
## ASSU – 4/10ths of 1%, or 'Freedom?' 
### Jim Schnieder 
There is presently a move afoot
to eliminate "mandatory" student
body fees at Stanford. Because
the consequences of such a course
of action would do students and
the community great harm, and
because it is conceivable that the
same constituency that threatened
us with Vicki Drake could realize
such an end, we should not take
such a move too lightly. It is in
this spirit that the following
arguments are presented.
ARE STUDENT BODY FEES
MANDATORY?
No. They are voluntary in the
same sense that tuition is
voluntary. The choice to come to
Stanford is a voluntary one. When
we applied for admission, we were
made aware of the functions of
the ASSU, just as we were made
aware of the functions of Cowell
Health Center and the Library ; all
of which we pay for.
BUT COWELL HEALTH
CENTER AND THE LIBRARY
ARE BEYOND THE PURVUE
OF STUDENTS, WHEREAS THE
ASSU IS CONTROLLED BY
STUDENTS. WHY CAN'T WE
STOP FINANCING THE ASSU?
We can, simply by disolving it
by a majority vote of those
persons voting in a special
election.
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO
MAKE STUDENT BODY FEES
VOLUNTARY ON THE
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL?
Yes. An amendment to the
ASSU Constitution would
facilitate such a system.
WHAT WOULD BE THE
EFFECT OF SUCH AN
AMENDMENT?
1. ASSU membership would
drop by at least 60%.
2. While constituting less than

a majority of the Student Body,
the ASSU would still act as the
body from which representatives
would be drawn.
3. Either student programs
would be cancelled for lack of
funds, or the University would
finance them, and charge us
accordingly just as it charges us
for the cost of the Health Center
and Library—ln the end, we
would still be paying most of our
present expenses, and neither the
semi-defunct ASSU or the balance
of the Student Body would have
any control.
HOW MUCH DO WE PAY FOR
STUDENT BODY FEES?
Approximately $3.00 per
quarter, or 4/10 th of 1% of our
tuition.
IF THE AMOUNT IS SO
SMALL, WHY ALL THE
COMMOTION?
The issue is being raised
because of a principle and a
temporal condition.
First, there is the principle that
"no student should be forced to
pay student body fees." Our
ASSU can be likened to a
government, "of, by, and for" the
students. As a government so
established, it is vested with the
responsibility to represent its
membership, manage its collective
affairs, and assess appropriate
fees, such fees are analogous to
taxes. The advantage of a
voluntary tax is obvious to the
tax-payer; the disadvantage is
equally apparant to the citizen.
Second, there is the contention
that student government is
unrepresentative, and, as a result,
funds have been and will be spent
in an unrepresentative manner. If
this is true it is still only a
temporal condition, not

something which is inherent in the
system.
A casual glance at the ASSU
Senate would reveal that it is not
representative of the "average"
student. But it is patently clear
that it is what the "average"
student wanted to represent him.
To city the Hare system of voting
as contributing to the diverse
character of the Senate is
believable, however, to blame it
for creating an unpopularly
elected Senate is to capitalize on
the Student Body's ignorance of
the Hare system.
GIVEN THAT WE WILL
HAVE A GREATER CONTROL
OVER OUR MONEY IF WE
MAINTAIN THE ASSU RATHER
THAN DISOLVING IT, AND
GIVEN THAT THE
GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM AS
SET FORTH IN THE ASSU
CONSTITUTION IS
LEGITIMATE AND FAIR, HOW
CAN WE HAVE A GREATER
INFLUENCE IN THE
BUDGETARY PROCESS?
In years past, and this year, the
LASSU/Senate, in conjunction
with the Student Financial
Manager, has established a budget.
The Hayes Constitution will
change this. The 1970-71
operational expenses of the ASSU
Office, and Senate will
be set by the Senate in the Spring.
The balance of the budget will be
set by the Student Body. Half of
these latter fees will be remitted
directly to graduate and
undergraduate student
associations on a per capita basis.
The other half will be alloted to
ASSU boards, commissions and
organizations.
ONCE IT IS SHOWN THAT
OUR OVERALL INTERESTS

WILL BE SERVED BEST
UNDER THIS NEWLY
ADOPTED CONSTITUTION,
WON'T THE STUDENT BODY
VOTE DOWN A "VOLUN
TARY" FEE PROPOSAL?
There will be those who will
honestly disagree with the

arguments herein presented, and
there will be those who will wish
to strike a blow for anarchy. We
can only ask that everyone weigh
any such proposal carefully, for in
a single vote could rest the future
efficacy of student influence in
the governance of the University.

finance them, and charge us
accordingly just as it charges us
for the cost of the Health Center
and Library—ln the end, we
would still be paying most of our
present expenses, and neither the
semi-defunct ASSU or the balance
of the Student Body would have
any control.
HOW MUCH DO WE PAY FOR
STUDENT BODY FEES?
Approximately $3.00 per
quarter, or 4/10 th of 1% of our
tuition.
IF THE AMOUNT IS SO
SMALL, WHY ALL THE
COMMOTION?
The issue is being raised
because of a principle and a
temporal condition.
First, there is the principle that
"no student should be forced to
pay student body fees." Our
ASSU can be likened to a
government, "of, by, and for" the
students. As a government so
established, it is vested with the
responsibility to represent its
membership, manage its collective
affairs, and assess appropriate
fees, such fees are analogous to
taxes. The advantage of a
voluntary tax is obvious to the
tax-payer; the disadvantage is
equally apparant to the citizen.
Second, there is the contention
that student government is
unrepresentative, and, as a result,
funds have been and will be spent
in an unrepresentative manner. If
this is true it is still only a
temporal condition, not

something which is inherent in the
system.
A casual glance at the ASSU
Senate would reveal that it is not
representative of the "average"
student. But it is patently clear
that it is what the "average"
student wanted to represent him.
To city the Hare system of voting
as contributing to the diverse
character of the Senate is
believable, however, to blame it
for creating an unpopularly
elected Senate is to capitalize on
the Student Body's ignorance of
the Hare system.
GIVEN THAT WE WILL
HAVE A GREATER CONTROL
OVER OUR MONEY IF WE
MAINTAIN THE ASSU RATHER
THAN DISOLVING IT, AND
GIVEN THAT THE
GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM AS
SET FORTH IN THE ASSU
CONSTITUTION IS
LEGITIMATE AND FAIR, HOW
CAN WE HAVE A GREATER
INFLUENCE IN THE
BUDGETARY PROCESS?
In years past, and this year, the
LASSU/Senate, in conjunction
with the Student Financial
Manager, has established a budget.
The Hayes Constitution will
change this. The 1970-71
operational expenses of the ASSU
Office, and Senate will
be set by the Senate in the Spring.
The balance of the budget will be
set by the Student Body. Half of
these latter fees will be remitted
directly to graduate and
undergraduate student
associations on a per capita basis.
The other half will be alloted to
ASSU boards, commissions and
organizations.
ONCE IT IS SHOWN THAT
OUR OVERALL INTERESTS

WILL BE SERVED BEST
UNDER THIS NEWLY
ADOPTED CONSTITUTION,
WON'T THE STUDENT BODY
VOTE DOWN A "VOLUN
TARY" FEE PROPOSAL?
There will be those who will
honestly disagree with the

arguments herein presented, and
there will be those who will wish
to strike a blow for anarchy. We
can only ask that everyone weigh
any such proposal carefully, for in
a single vote could rest the future
efficacy of student influence in
the governance of the University.
There is presently a move afoot
to eliminate "mandatory" student
body fees at Stanford. Because
the consequences of such a course
of action would do students and
the community great harm, and
because it is conceivable that the
same constituency that threatened
us with Vicki Drake could realize
such an end, we should not take
such a move too lightly. It is in
this spirit that the following
arguments are presented.
ARE STUDENT BODY FEES
MANDATORY?
No. They are voluntary in the
same sense that tuition is
voluntary. The choice to come to
Stanford is a voluntary one. When
we applied for admission, we were
made aware of the functions of
the ASSU, just as we were made
aware of the functions of Cowell
Health Center and the Library ; all
of which we pay for.
BUT COWELL HEALTH
CENTER AND THE LIBRARY
ARE BEYOND THE PURVUE
OF STUDENTS, WHEREAS THE
ASSU IS CONTROLLED BY
STUDENTS. WHY CAN'T WE
STOP FINANCING THE ASSU?
We can, simply by disolving it
by a majority vote of those
persons voting in a special
election.
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO
MAKE STUDENT BODY FEES
VOLUNTARY ON THE
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL?
Yes. An amendment to the
ASSU Constitution would
facilitate such a system.
WHAT WOULD BE THE
EFFECT OF SUCH AN
AMENDMENT?
1. ASSU membership would
drop by at least 60%.
2. While constituting less than

a majority of the Student Body,
the ASSU would still act as the
body from which representatives
would be drawn.
3. Either student programs
would be cancelled for lack of
funds, or the University would
finance them, and charge us
accordingly just as it charges us
for the cost of the Health Center
and Library—ln the end, we
would still be paying most of our
present expenses, and neither the

elected Senate is to capitalize on
the Student Body's ignorance of
the Hare system.
GIVEN THAT WE WILL
HAVE A GREATER CONTROL
OVER OUR MONEY IF WE
MAINTAIN THE ASSU RATHER
THAN DISOLVING IT, AND
GIVEN THAT THE
GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM AS
SET FORTH IN THE ASSU
CONSTITUTION IS
LEGITIMATE AND FAIR, HOW
CAN WE HAVE A GREATER
INFLUENCE IN THE
BUDGETARY PROCESS?
In years past, and this year, the
LASSU/Senate, in conjunction
with the Student Financial
Manager, has established a budget.
The Hayes Constitution will
change this. The 1970-71
operational expenses of the ASSU
Office, and Senate will
be set by the Senate in the Spring.
The balance of the budget will be
set by the Student Body. Half of
these latter fees will be remitted
directly to graduate and
undergraduate student
associations on a per capita basis.
The other half will be alloted to
ASSU boards, commissions and
organizations.
ONCE IT IS SHOWN THAT
OUR OVERALL INTERESTS

WILL BE SERVED BEST
UNDER THIS NEWLY
ADOPTED CONSTITUTION,
WON'T THE STUDENT BODY
VOTE DOWN A "VOLUN
TARY" FEE PROPOSAL?
There will be those who will
honestly disagree with the

arguments herein presented, and
there will be those who will wish
to strike a blow for anarchy. We
can only ask that everyone weigh
any such proposal carefully, for in
a single vote could rest the future
efficacy of student influence in
the governance of the University.
There is presently a move afoot
to eliminate "mandatory" student
body fees at Stanford. Because
the consequences of such a course
of action would do students and
the community great harm, and
because it is conceivable that the
same constituency that threatened
us with Vicki Drake could realize
such an end, we should not take
such a move too lightly. It is in
this spirit that the following
arguments are presented.
ARE STUDENT BODY FEES
MANDATORY?
No. They are voluntary in the
same sense that tuition is
voluntary. The choice to come to
Stanford is a voluntary one. When
we applied for admission, we were
made aware of the functions of
the ASSU, just as we were made
aware of the functions of Cowell
Health Center and the Library ; all
of which we pay for.
BUT COWELL HEALTH
CENTER AND THE LIBRARY
ARE BEYOND THE PURVUE
OF STUDENTS, WHEREAS THE
ASSU IS CONTROLLED BY
STUDENTS. WHY CAN'T WE
STOP FINANCING THE ASSU?
We can, simply by disolving it
by a majority vote of those
persons voting in a special
election.
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO
MAKE STUDENT BODY FEES
VOLUNTARY ON THE
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL?
Yes. An amendment to the
ASSU Constitution would
facilitate such a system.
WHAT WOULD BE THE
EFFECT OF SUCH AN
AMENDMENT?
1. ASSU membership would
drop by at least 60%.
2. While constituting less than

a majority of the Student Body,
the ASSU would still act as the
body from which representatives
would be drawn.
3. Either student programs
would be cancelled for lack of
funds, or the University would
finance them, and charge us
accordingly just as it charges us
for the cost of the Health Center
and Library—ln the end, we
would still be paying most of our
present expenses, and neither the
semi-defunct ASSU or the balance
of the Student Body would have
any control.
HOW MUCH DO WE PAY FOR
STUDENT BODY FEES?
Approximately $3.00 per
quarter, or 4/10 th of 1% of our
tuition.
IF THE AMOUNT IS SO
SMALL, WHY ALL THE
COMMOTION?
The issue is being raised
because of a principle and a
temporal condition.
First, there is the principle that
"no student should be forced to
pay student body fees." Our
ASSU can be likened to a
government, "of, by, and for" the
students. As a government so
established, it is vested with the
responsibility to represent its
membership, manage its collective
affairs, and assess appropriate
fees, such fees are analogous to
taxes. The advantage of a
voluntary tax is obvious to the
tax-payer; the disadvantage is
equally apparant to the citizen.
Second, there is the contention
that student government is
unrepresentative, and, as a result,
funds have been and will be spent
in an unrepresentative manner. If
this is true it is still only a
temporal condition, not

something which is inherent in the
system.
A casual glance at the ASSU
Senate would reveal that it is not
representative of the "average"
student. But it is patently clear
that it is what the "average"
student wanted to represent him.
To city the Hare system of voting
as contributing to the diverse
character of the Senate is
believable, however, to blame it
for creating an unpopularly
elected Senate is to capitalize on
the Student Body's ignorance of
the Hare system.
