# Letter To The Editor
## Vicious Threats 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
On November 11, Professor
Howard S. Seifert said in a letter
to the Daily that the war in
Vietnam was a "complex systems
problem" that could only be
solved by "specialist members of
the federal government." Any one
who challenged their exclusive
expertise and presumed to express
a dissenting opinion on the war,
said Professor Seifert, "is guilty of
treason." So much for "the right
of the people to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a
redress of grievances" (Article I of
the Bill of Rights).
Professor Seifert's sentiments,
however, are dangerous in more
than their repudiation of the
Constitution. He implies that
those of us without the technical
skills of systems analysis have no
business expressing opinions on
any of the major public issues of
our society. (He mentions "traffic
safety, city planning, poverty, or
war.") This is one of the most
extreme examples I have seen of
the radically antidemocratic logic
inherent in technological thinking.
It may well be that democracy is
growing less relevant in an
increasingly crowded and

technologically sophisticated
world, but that is a tendency
which we all must passionately
resist. It should be the duty of the
Universities, above all, to foster
the courage and ingenuity to
preserve democratic values in the
face of the profoundly vicious
threat that ideas like Professor
Seifert's pose.
