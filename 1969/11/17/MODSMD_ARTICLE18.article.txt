# Bonfire Burns Friday
## 
### 
Not to be outdone by the light
of 50,000 candles in Washington,
Stanford's annual firelight
ceremony will be held Friday
night at 6:30 p.m.
For the 65th year, the bonfire
rally, featuring the Stanford Band,
cheer leaders, pompon girls, and
inspirational speakers such as
Gene Washington of the San
Francisco Forty-Niners, will
climax preparations for the Big
Game. The Indians will host the
University of California at 1:30
Saturday.
Big Game Week activities will
begin Wednesday as the Ram's
Head "Big Game Gaieties" opens.
The show will play Wednesday
and Thursday at 8:30, and Friday
at 9:00 in Memorial Auditorium.
For the first time, the final
performance of the Gaieties will
be after Big Game, Saturday night
at 8:30 in Mem Aud. The Friday
performance has a late starting
time to allow for attendance at
the bonfire.
Radical's Troubles
This year's musical, "The
Carnival Down Below," tells the
story of a freshman who falls in

love with a female radical activist,
and becomes a radical himself. He
then finds himself in trouble with
his Orange County draft board.
Big Game Week will also be
Homecoming Week, with plans for
a house decoration contest. Prizes
will be awarded for the best Big
Game decor.
The bonfire will be held in the

middle of Lake Lagunita. T*he
skeleton of the woodpile will
consist of 26 telephone poles
driven into the dry lake bed.
The bonfire was first held in
1904, and has marked pre-Big
tiame activities every year since
with the exception of the last
years of World War 11, when
Stanford did not participate in
intercollegiate football.
