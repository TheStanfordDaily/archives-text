# Hypnosis Research Uncovers Problems
## 
### JEFF RUBIN 
Stanford Psychology Prof.
Phillip Zmbardo said that
hypnosis can have practical
application to life and death, and
that it is "one of the most
effective techniques we have to
study important psychological
problems."
Speaking in the Faculty Club
dining room to the 21st annual
convention of the Society for
Clinical and Experimental
Hypnosis, Zimbardo said that "we
don't have to view hypnosis as a
special mystical kind of
phenomena," but as a practical
and important method of
psychological research.
Zimbardo's audio-visual
presentation looked at
psychological research dealing
with the role of cognitive
variables—those which are not
physical or biological in origin-in
governing human behavior.
This research shows that when
you take choice away from people
they become information—pro
cessing organisms. However, when
you give people choice and
responsibility for their actions,
they will exercise control over
their behavior.
Changed Behavior
Zimbardo showed that a second
factor which greatly influences
loss of control is anonimity. When
people are made anonimous and
are given no responsibility for
their actions, they lose control.
The alteration of the time
perspective also influences
behavioral control. If you can get
people to act in the present,
forgetting about the past and

future, you can get a release ol
behavior normally controlled. As
you expand the present, control
increases.
Zimbardo thus concluded that
"you can change people's
behavior: what they say, how
they act, what happens
physiologically as well, by
manipulating cognitive states,
perception of choice, feelings that
they are responsible for their
actions, as you can by
manipulating physical things, like
hours of food deprivation."
Significance Demonstrated
Zimbardo used research done at
an old peoples' home to show
how all this has practical
significance.
The old people brought to the
home were asked whether or not
they had a choice in coming there.
Ninety-five percent of those who
said they had no choice
unexpectedly died within ten
months while 10 percent of those
who said they had a choice lived
longer.
Zimbardo believes that "we can
take people who come into these
homes who say they have no
choice and simply give them an
illusi if choice. Giving people a
choic ,akes them responsible for
their behavior on one hand, and
also, if you have a choice you
perceive that there are alternative
courses of action which means
that you have a future
orientation. And I think we can
also make people live longer by
using hypnosis and simply give
them expanded future
orientation," he concluded.
