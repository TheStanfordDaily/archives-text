# Debate Over Arena
## 
### 
Black Student Union (BSU)
leaders and spokesmen from the
Arena tentatively will meet in a
debate tomorrow afternoon in an
attempt to spell out "political and
ideological differences," according
to BSU member Dave Edwards.
The debate grew out of the
bitter controversy between the
two groups over articles in last
week's Arena which sharply
criticized the new ASSU student
senate and the BSU-white radical
alliance that the newspaper feels
controls the student legislature.
"The typical meeting turns out
to be merely a formal
rubber-stamping of decisions
previously made by the
BSU-white radical alliance," said

the Arena in an article by Roger
Reed.
BSU spokesmen responded by
declaring, "The BSU will take
whatever steps are necessary to
prevent the Arena from its
pursuits of libeling and slandering
Black People."
BSU Chairman Leo Bazile,
Dave Edwards, and Buff Parham
will speak for the Black group.
Scheduled for the Arena are
Harvey Hukari. former president
of Stanford Young Americans for
Freedom, Roger Reed, Arena
writer, and a third unnamed
spokesman.
The discussion is planned for
4:15 p.m. tomorrow in
Cubberley.
