# Low Rent Housing Will Form 'Ghetto'
## 
### 
An expensive and limited
"faculty ghetto" is not the answer
to a tight situation for all
University employees and the
surrounding community, said
George Kaplan, a member of the
Junior Faculty Forum steering
committee, at the forum's first
meeting of the year, held last
week.
The Junior Faculty Forum,
created two years ago, is an
organization of untenured faculty
and staff members holding
positions of assistant professor or
lower.
According to Kaplan, the
Provost's Office has proposed
constructing 60 town houses on
the south end of campus near
College Terrace to accommodate
junior faculty who have trouble
finding housing they can afford in
the area. The apartments would
rent for an average of $200 per
month.
Veto Requested
If the plan received an
immediate go-ahead from the
junior faculty, the development
would be completed by
September, 1970. Kaplan
proposed that the forum veto the

plan since Stanford, as such a
large employer, "indirectly has a
very profound effect on all
housing in this area of the
Peninsula."
A survey taken last year among
all junior faculty and staff
indicated a large support for
housing on University land that
would be integrated socially,
economically, and politically, and
open to those not necessarily
connected with Stanford.
The general consensus of the 23
persons present at the meeting
was that the town house plan does
not meet their desires for low-cost
housing, nor those expressed in
the survey. A committee will look
further into the town house plan
and its possible effect on the
community.
The Terman Report on changes
in University tenure policy was
also discussed. With the
assumption that the faculty level
will be held constant in the
coming years, the report explores
the implications of this freezing
on policy towards changing
faculty and tenure. A committee
will study the report which was
compiled by Fred Terman,
formally of the Provost's office.
