# Pelican Threat
## 
### 
Stanford scientists are worried
that California will soon be
pelicanless. And it's all because of
DDT.
A recent Stanford study of 296
pelican nests on one of the
Channel Islands off Santa Barbara
showed that only 12 nests
contained normal eggs, nine had
only one egg, three had two eggs.
The other nests all had eggs or
evidence of eggs so low in calcium
content that they were virtually
without shells—either the parents'
weight crushed them or the thin
shells allowed dehydration and
death of the embryos.
The scientists at Stanford's
Hopkins Marine Station, at Pacific
Grove, are expressing general
alarm at the growing
po 11 ution—l a r g e 1 y from
DDT—around their research
facilities on Monterey Bay,
according to an article in the
current Campus Report, a
University publication.
Prof. Welton L. Lee, who led a
group of 20 students last spring in
a study of pollution in the
vicinity, frankly admitted that
marine scientists have "deep
anxieties" about the growing
accumulation of DDT in the
oceans. "We are running scared,"
he said. DDT takes years to
decompose by weathering and
biological processes. Even if its
use were stopped now, he said, it
might take 10 to 20 years to
eliminate the danger.
Reproductive Failure
These and other fish-eating
birds build up high concentrations
of DDT and its toxic residues, the
scientist explains. They were
among the first warm-blooded
animals known to suffer wide
reproductive failure. These
animals may containe up to
100,000 times the concentration
of DDT originally in their food.
There are also many reports of
DDT's destructive effects in
shellfish and beneficial insects.
The concentration in several


MARINE RESEARCH VESSEL-The 100-foot Proteus,
an ex-tuna clipper, was used by student and faculty
scientists this summer exploring coastal waters near La
Paz, Mexico. The ship, operated with National Science

Foundation support, is run by Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station, whose scientists have warned that local
deterioration nia> severely limit development in marine
research of the Bay Area.
