# Hypnosis Tool In Many Fields
## 
### 
"The hypnotist can only aid
the patient in hypnotising
himself," a clinical hypnotist
declared Thursday.
Speaking at a press conference
publicizing the Society for
Clinical and Experimental
Hypnosis conference, which is
being held here, Dr. Irl Cleary
emphasized the importance of
hypnosis as a clinical tool for
physicians, dentists, and
psychologists.
Approximately 200
professional members are
expected to attend the 5-day
gathering, which is sponsored by
the Psychology and Psychiatry
departments here.
The other three participants in
the press conference yesterday
discussed their own use of
hypnosis as a means of controlling
pain and relieving tension in
patients.
Kirl Klopp, a dentist from Los
Angeles, described how he has
used hypnosis as a means to relax
patients recovering from surgery.
He stated that this relaxation
procedure usually allows
post-operative patients to control
their pain and anxiety while in the
recovery room. He claimed
success in 116 out of the 117
cases in which he had used the
procedure. The only person for
whom the procedure would not
work was a neurotic with
masochistic tendencies.
Klopp emphasized the fact that
hypnosis is not only a good
"modality" for relieving pain and
anxiety but that training in
hypnotic techniques "gives the

dentist a much better
understanding of his patients."
He was supported on this point
by Dr. Paul Sacerdote, who has
used hypnosis to relieve the pain
of terminal cancer patients.
"It should be routinely used in
every surgery; the patient should
be talked to because he
understands at a pre-conscious
level what is going on. I think it
would be an excellent training for
all surgeons: if not in hypnosis, at
least in talking to patients.
No Total Anesthestic
"We are not aiming for a total
anesthesia for non-controllable
pain which is too widespread to
be controlled by narcotics. Rather
we hope to change the character
of the pain so that it is livable."
Sacerdote said that his
procedure is good in 90% of the
cases he sees and that he can
effect the "cure" after having seen
the patient only once or twice.
"The personal contact in the
first few moments I see the
patient is important because it
establishes a rapport, a
transference. A permissive
approach is a more effective
procedure, though not always."
He and Dr. Erika Fromm
explained that a permissive
approach emphasizes the patient's
not being forced to bring
unconscious material to the
surface. Early in his career, Freud
used an authoritarian approach
forcing the patient through
hypnosis to bring materials out of
his mind, even if he didn't want
to.
Helping Mothers
Dr. Fromm stated that
hypnosis is useful in helping
expectant mothers to deliver. "It
can be used to change the muscle
tone, to relax the patient. Part of
the pain in labor is muscle
tension."
She also stated that hypnosis
can be used in treating almost all
types of neurosis, except in
psychotics and pre-psychotic
patients.
Klopp said that one of the most
striking uses of hypnosis is in
calming children visiting a dentist.
"Children can be taught to relax
in a very few moments using
visual imagery."
He asks the child to visualize
his favorite television program.
"They start to relive it so fully
that we can do all sorts of things
and they aren't even aware."
He stated that he learned to be
more aware of non-verbal
communication. He uses the
childrens' fantasizing to relax
them.
A! 1 the participants emphasized
the dangers of hyy in the
hands of people ,e not
trained to deal with other people.
"You must learn â€”no to
hypnotize and who not to
hypnotize. Hypnotism in the
hands of undergraduate students
who have had no training is very
dangerous," said Dr. Fromm.
