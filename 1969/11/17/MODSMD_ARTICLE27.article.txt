# This Week at Campus Films
## Goddard, Bergman Featured 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Important works by Bresson,
Godard, Bergman, Kazan and
Brooks constitute the highlights
of this week's movie schedule.
This week's experimental films
in the art auditorium at 9 p.m.
Monday include Bruce Baillie's
Termination, Robert Nelson's Hot
Leatherette, Love Happens,
Womancock, Anthology of Boats,
Help! My Snowman's Burning
Down and the prize-winning The
Critic.
Showing twice on Tuesday in
Geology 320 is a 1932 comedy,
Night After Night. The film marks
Mae West's first screen appearanco
and characteristically, Mae mak<;s
her supporting part a major event
by virtue of her very presence.
Any chance to catch the great
Mae, especially for the

uninitiated, should not be
bypassed and here, George Raft,
Constance Cummings and Louis
Calhern contribute to the merry
proceedings.
Robert Bresson's The Trial of
Joan of Arc has been described as
"the perfect film" and indeed, the
director's style is almost
painstakingly precise and
economical. Critic Richard Roud
has called Bresson's films "the
chamber music of the cinema";
that is, this week's International
Association film will be as
exquisite for some as it will be
excruciating for others. In
Cubberley at 7:45 on Thursday.
Though Godard comes very
close in Pierrot le Fou to creating
a joyous, fun film, he doesn't
quite make it and basic interest
therefore rests in some undeniably

remarkable individual sequences.
For apparently the first time in
movie history, Godard stages
action in the conditional tense, as
Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna
Karina consider alternative
escapes from Paris. The use of
sound and color is continually
inspired, the "interview" with
American director Samuei Fuller
is an amusing in-joke and the final
scenes contain the most sensitive
acting Belmondo has ever done.
At Tresidder on Friday.
Bergman Overrated
I am in the minority in
considering Ingmar Bergman one
of the most overrated
contemporary directors and while
I find Wild Strawberries of only
moderate interest, it can at least
be said that it is one of the
director's least pretentious and
most personal works. After a
haunting opening, the film
degenerates into surreal
psychology, but the fine
performances of Victor Sjostrom
and Ingrid Thulin remain as
distinctive compensations. It will

be shown at 7:30 and 9:30 in
Cubberley on Friday.
East of Eden stands as one of
the finest films of the fifties. Even
without Elia Kazan's forceful
direction and the fine supporting
characterizations of Julie Harris,
Raymond Massey and Jo Van
Fleet, the picture would rank
prominantly on the basis of James
Dean's brilliant performance.
Even today, Tresidder's Saturday
film comments significantly on
the universal problem of growing
up in a seemingly alien world.
In Cold I?lood boasts brilliant
performances by Robert Blake
and Scott Wilson, fine
photography by Conrad Hall and
a structurally superb script and
perceptive direction by Richard
Brooks, yet the sum effect
remains disquietingly incomplete.
Brooks seems preoccupied with
the psychological motivations of
the murderers, but it is when he
reconstructs events verbatim from
Truman Capote's book that the
film reaches its greatest intensity
and believability. At the Sunday
Flicks.
