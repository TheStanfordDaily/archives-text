# The 						Fourth Virtue

Men only.
'No Women or Children Permitted.'
That's what it says on the special blue football ticket labelled
'Working Press.'
That's what's printed on the door to the second and third levels of
the three-tired press box at Stanford's stadium.
Towering above the reserved seats and their fur-bedecked
occupants, the press box is schematicized carefully enough to rival
Dante's Inferno, and segregated carefully enough to rival Maddox's
Georgia.
Nor racially (although I observed only one black face in the 40-odd
there). Sexually.
The bottom, or first level, is labelled 'Auxiliary Press.' In reality,
more weight is given the 'auxiliary' half of that description. This
section is occupied by the wives and children of reporters, and by
football scouts. Nearby, on the same level, sit those VlP's who have
made the President's special guest list.
The top two levels are more specialized. The second level is
crowded with sportswriters, leaning over their typewriters and
notebooks and squinting at the doll-sized manneguins struggling on
the faraway football field.
These men are conisseurs of athletic art, who daily translate their
knowledge and observances into columns of newsprint.
They are also male chauvanists.
All the faces behind the pencils and typewriters showed signs of
stubble. The only girls in the area were behind the free-food counter,
dishing out hotdogs, coffee and Pepsi to the Sportswriters.
The third level has its free-food stand, too, catering to the scouts
and statisticians hidden in the small cubicles on the third level, and to
the cameramen stretched out along the benches between cubicles.
In this level, there are no women at all.
According to Chuck Taylor, Stanford's Director of Athletics, the
rule barring women from the Working Press section is traditional.
"There just aren't any women sportswriters," Taylor said.
There seemed to be a tacit contradiction between this statement
and my presence in one of the Daily's press seats, but Mr. Taylor
seemed to regard that circumstance as a one-time thing, and no real
threat to the press box's tradition.
The writers themselves, whether tradition-conscious or not, were
decidedly cool, although my right to the Daily's press seat was only
challenged once, and then very pleasantly. By contrast, my reception
by Mr. Taylor and the other officials of the press box was very warm.
As I appeared at the door they asked, "are you from the Daily?," and
then gave me red-carpet treatment.
After all, it's not entirely the fault of the Stanford athletic
department that there are no women sportswriters. They're not the
ones doing the hiring, after all.
But then again, what good does it do a paper to hire a woman
sports writer, if she doesn't have access to the same facilities a man
might have?
Maybe if I came back next weekend, maybe if I were assigned to
cover this winter's basketball games, I wouldn't be welcomed all that
warmly.
If I went, I wouldn't go to serve hot dogs. The fraternity of
sportswriters might be very surprised to know that women can write.
Even about sports.

All the faces behind the pencils and typewriters showed signs of
stubble. The only girls in the area were behind the free-food counter,
dishing out hotdogs, coffee and Pepsi to the Sportswriters.
The third level has its free-food stand, too, catering to the scouts
and statisticians hidden in the small cubicles on the third level, and to
the cameramen stretched out along the benches between cubicles.
In this level, there are no women at all.
According to Chuck Taylor, Stanford's Director of Athletics, the
rule barring women from the Working Press section is traditional.
"There just aren't any women sportswriters," Taylor said.
There seemed to be a tacit contradiction between this statement
and my presence in one of the Daily's press seats, but Mr. Taylor
seemed to regard that circumstance as a one-time thing, and no real
threat to the press box's tradition.
The writers themselves, whether tradition-conscious or not, were
decidedly cool, although my right to the Daily's press seat was only
challenged once, and then very pleasantly. By contrast, my reception
by Mr. Taylor and the other officials of the press box was very warm.
As I appeared at the door they asked, "are you from the Daily?," and
then gave me red-carpet treatment.
After all, it's not entirely the fault of the Stanford athletic
department that there are no women sportswriters. They're not the
ones doing the hiring, after all.
But then again, what good does it do a paper to hire a woman
sports writer, if she doesn't have access to the same facilities a man
might have?
Maybe if I came back next weekend, maybe if I were assigned to
cover this winter's basketball games, I wouldn't be welcomed all that
warmly.
If I went, I wouldn't go to serve hot dogs. The fraternity of
sportswriters might be very surprised to know that women can write.
Even about sports.
Men only.
'No Women or Children Permitted.'
That's what it says on the special blue football ticket labelled
'Working Press.'
That's what's printed on the door to the second and third levels of
the three-tired press box at Stanford's stadium.
Towering above the reserved seats and their fur-bedecked
occupants, the press box is schematicized carefully enough to rival
Dante's Inferno, and segregated carefully enough to rival Maddox's
Georgia.
Nor racially (although I observed only one black face in the 40-odd
there). Sexually.
The bottom, or first level, is labelled 'Auxiliary Press.' In reality,
more weight is given the 'auxiliary' half of that description. This
section is occupied by the wives and children of reporters, and by
football scouts. Nearby, on the same level, sit those VlP's who have
made the President's special guest list.
The top two levels are more specialized. The second level is
crowded with sportswriters, leaning over their typewriters and
notebooks and squinting at the doll-sized manneguins struggling on
the faraway football field.
These men are conisseurs of athletic art, who daily translate their
knowledge and observances into columns of newsprint.
They are also male chauvanists.
