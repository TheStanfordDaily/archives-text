# League Loss
## Poloists Clobberered 
### 
Stanford's water polo team
closed out the season on a
disappointing note Saturday as
they lost to California, 9-4.
The loss was the sixth league
defeat in a row for the Indians
and it dropped their final record
to 10-8.
The first quarter featured some
fine goalkeeping by both teams as
there was only one score. Midway
through the second period, the
Indians took a 2-1 lead on a
penalty shot by Rick Massimino.
But in less than two minutes,
Massimino, who had been the key
to Stanford's offense, left the
game with an injured finger. By
the time he returned in the late
third quarter, Cal had picked up
five goals and a 6-2 lead.
Massimino was still hampered
by the injury and he could

manage only one goal late in the
game. The Bears added three
fourth quarter goals to win
soundly.
An encouraging note for the
Tribe was that all of their starters
yesterday will be returning next
season. The two keys to
Stanford's team this year, goalie
Peter Gadd and Massimino will
both be back.
Also returning will be Ray
Collins, Rick Eagleston, Rob
Jensen, Bob Rogers and Rob
YVoolley. The Cards will lose Tom
Hill, Banks Beasley and Wayne
Wilson, but the number of
returning stars gives hopes for big
things next year.
With an important year of
experience under their belts, this
year's sophomore stars will be
expected to challenge for next
season's national championship.
