# Plunkett Kills Cadets
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER FRED MANN 
"We could be the favorite by a
point or two."
John Ralston was discussing the
upcoming Big Game against
California, and sports writers
held back their laughter. Stanford
had just smashed 20th ranked Air
Force, 47-34, and Cal had
struggled past San Jose State (not
scoring a touchdown until the end
of the third quarter), but Ralston,
the cautious optimist, was not
going overboard.
"The point spread is not
important in the Big Game," said
the victorious coach. "Anything
can happen; I know Cal will be
ready for us."
But Air Force is convinced that
California could prepare for weeks
and still not be ready to take on
the Indians. Not many teams are.
Stanford did their part for the
Moratorium, and overcame
American military power at least
on the controlled battlefield of
the football stadium. The cadets
probably left wishing they had
opted for a peaceful settlement.
The Air Force had never seen
an air attack like the one that Jim
Plunkett delivered Saturday.
But the unheralded facet of
Stanford's offense —their ground
game—was also very much in
evidence. Plunkett's performance
broke no less than three
conference season records (total
offense, passing yardage, and
touchdown passes), with one
game yet to play. Still, with
Hillary Shockley scoring three
TD's and Randy Vataha returning

a punt 63-yards to score,
Stanford's ground game held its
own.
Air Force was hardly
overwhelmed, however, by
Stanford's defense. Time and
again, especially in the first half,
Curtis Martin, Air Force's volatile
tailback loped through Indian
defenders for large gains.
The passing attack generated by
long-legged Air Force Quarterback
Gary Baxter was not to be
discounted, either. The spark for
the first Air Force touchdown
drive came from Baxter's aerials
and Martin's scamperings.
Stanford, behind after the first
quarter for the first time all year,
quickly made up for lost time in
the second period. Although
Plunkett's tosses were a little high,
he was consistent enough to direct
four scoring drives.
The first touchdown pass was
delivered not by Plunkett, but by
halfback Bubba Brown on an
option play around the right side.
Vataha grabbed the soft 23-yard
bomb between two Falcon
defensemen to put the Tribe on
the board on the second play of
the second period.
With a hard-nosed cadet rooting
section cheering them on, the Air
Force came right back on an eight
play drive with Baxter hitting
flashy Ernie Jennings for the TD.
With fullback Howie Williams
hurt, sophomore Shockley took
over, and ran the Indians to 17

more points in the decisive
quarter. He himself scored on two
plunges, and ran solidly to set up
a Steve Horowitz field goal from
29 yards out.
The Stanford attack continued
after intermission with Plunkett
leading the charge. Using the
option play very effectively
against the Falcon defense,
Plunkett ran more than any time
all year. He carried 13 times for
58 yards, and still threw 38
passes, completing 22 for 278 '
yards and two TD's. He again was
voted Back of the Game.
Shockley gained 62 yards in 12
carries, and Vataha caught five
passes for 67 yards and a
touchdown. It was his 63-yard
punt return that took the pressure
off the Tribe in the fourth
quarter, and put the game out of
reach for Air Force.
Demea Washington, seeing a lot
of playing time hauled in five
passes for 55 yards in an
outstanding effort. The deep
secondary intercepted four Baxter
throws, and Jim Kauffman almost
had two others picked off.
Kauffman, Jack Shultz, and Tom
Sones (2), did the defensive
damage.
