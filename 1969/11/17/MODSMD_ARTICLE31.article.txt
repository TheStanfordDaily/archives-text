## Tourney Upsets 
### SCOTT BURNS 
Many upsets occurred in the
early rounds of the IM football
tournament this past week, and as
a result, some unexpected teams
will be playing in the quarterfinals
today.
A determined Second Year Law
team pulled the first upset of the
tournament last Wednesday, by
beating the second seeded Theta
Delts, 19-13.
Led by speedy quarterback,
Marshall Goldberg, the Law team
mixed running and short passing
to score their 19 points. Bob
Parker, the quarterback for the
Theta Delts, had a bad day passing
and had three key aerials picked
off by the alert Law defense
during important second half
drives.
Burbank also pulled another
upset the same day as they beat
the eighth seeded Betas, 24-0. The
Betas were at a handicap since
their key player, Ted Bleymaier,
wasn't there.
In third round action the
super-keyed SAE's slapped a tight
defense on the fifth seeded Phuds
to upset them, 13-0. The Alpha
Sigs (sixth seeded team) also bit
the dust in a really close battle
with the Med School team. They
tied 13-13, but Med won on
yardage. The Chi Psi's used a well

balanced offense to defeat the
Sigma Chi's (seventh seeded
team), 20-8.
After all of the surprises, only
three of the top eight seeded
teams remain. But they are the
finest. The top rated Phi Delts
won their one tournament game
easily, 37-12, over MFI. The
beat the previously undefeated
Panthers, 26-6, and the
Dislocations also stopped Toro's
winning streak with a 27-0
victory. All three are expected to
make it to the semifinals.
Both the semi-finals and finals
will be held this week, and the
Stanford champion will meet the
IM winner from California on
Saturday morning, the morning of
Big Game, for the Intramural Big
Game.
The contest will be held on the
Stanford soccer field.
