# Ducks Win Run Meet
## 
### 
Gerry Lindgren and Steve
Prefontaine blitzed everybody
Saturday at the Pac-8 cross
country championships, both
covering the six mile course in a
sensational time of 28:32.3, a
minute and 14 seconds ahead of
the old course record.
Officials gave first place to
Lindgren though both men,
running way ahead the whole
race, finished with identical times.
Oregon won the league title
with 46 points, followed by
Washington State with 63 and
Stanford with 86.
Greg Brock led the Indian team
with a fifth place time of 29:08,
that being 38 seconds ahead of
the old course record; all of the
top ten whipped the old mark by
a half minute, which indicates the
phenomenal pace of the race.
Oregon had four finishers in the
top ten, and Washington State had
three. USC, which placed fourth,
four points behind Stanford, put
two in the first ten.
Additional details and pictures
will appear Wednesday.
