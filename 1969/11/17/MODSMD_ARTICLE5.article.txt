# City March, Rally Draw Huge, Peaceful Crowds
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Marching in numbers too large
to count — even for
Huntley-Brinkley, —at least one
hundred thousand persons
demonstrated for peace Saturday
in San Francisco.
A solid stream of picket-toting,
flag-waving youths and many not
so young, paraded their way on a
seven and a half mile path starting
at the San Francisco waterfront
and concluding at the Polo
Grounds in Golden Gate Park.
There, a peace rally bearing
striking resemblances to the
Woodstock Rock Festival of last
summer took place in the early
afternoon haze.
The march culminated the
second moratorium called by the
New Mobilization Committee to
End The War In Vietnam.
Bundled marchers left at 7 a.m.
on the long trek which wound its
way through business districts and
residential areas..
Schools Represented
Participants gathered from all
parts of the Bay Area and from
coastal regions which extended as
far as Washington. Many Bay Area
schools, including Stanford,
brought large contingents of
students who marched in groups
along the entire route.
The march was marked by a
peacefulness which saw only a
total of four people arrested the
entire day. Three of the arrests
were for possession of drugs—one
for possession of a concealed
weapon.
With some exceptions the
marchers were casually-clad white
youths. But there were
representative groups of blacks
and chicanos, and surprisingly
large numbers of "over 30's".
Police I) irect
Police who had been alerted
had little to do most of the day
except traffic. The demonstrators
followed their direction as the
police attempted to maintain the
traffic flow in spite of the
congestion. Directions were
obeyed almost without exception,

and Moratorium captains who had
been trained weeks in advance of
Saturday's march kept the crowd
moving in an orderly consistent
path to the Park.
Just how many people
participated is a question few
were able to say and probably will
not ever be known. The San
Francisco Examiner estimated
100,000, while Moratorium
organizers put the figure closer to
twice that number.
The Mobe, the sponsoring
organization, put together the
march which allied numerous
left-wing organizations, as well as
moderate citizen's groups.
The march was a test of
whether such an alliance could
function at all and especially
whether it could function
peacefully.
Saturday's march seemed to
confirm that it could work. Even
more apparent is the fact that
pressure to end the war will
probably become even stronger in
the future.
Few Incidents
There were few incidents along
the route itself. In one case,
someone began throwing bottles
from a rooftop alongside the
march. No one was hurt and only
a few bottles were hurled.
When marchers arrived at. the
park,, four mounted policeman
cornered a marcher who they
attempted to arrest for an
unspecified reason. He later
escaped as the police saw larger
groups of marchers arriving at the
park.
At the rally, speaker followed
speaker atop the high platform
before the huge throng. Marchers
covered with placards, flags and
slogans listened and cheered as
music and rhetoric washed the
park in sound.
Crosby, Stills and Nash, Buffy
Sainte Marie, and Phil Ochs
entertained in between addresses
by Ralph Abernathy of the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and assorted others.

Hundreds of plastic coffee can
lids flew through the air as the
music broke through an otherwise
gloomy San Francisco day. Rain
sprinkled the rally toward the
end. But startled gulls were forced
to dodge the coffee can lids even
in the rain as the demonstrators
remained exuberant throughout.
The presence of such speakers
as David Milliard of the Black
Panthers with Ralph Abernathy
on the same stage was a unique
one, but so was the afternoon.
Abernathy said that "this great
demonstration must continue,
month after month . . .You and I
must move Richard Nixon out of
Washington."
Furthcr Analysis
Speakers representing students
for a Democratic Society, the
United Farm Workers, and various
chicano groups followed
Abernathy to the podium as they
delivered their own analysis of
US. involvement in Southeast
Asia.
As the afternoon wore on, the
crowd thinned slightly, but most
demonstrators were present at
4:30 to hear Buffv Sainte Marie.
About a dozen fires were lit
from leaflets, rubbish, and other
objects as demonstrators
attempted to keep warm.
Organizers were given until this
afternoon to clean up what one
police official described as "tons
of debris" on the polo field. The
300 by 900 yard polo field was
littered with food wrappings,
draft cards, picket signs and
cardboard cartons.
Monilors Praised
Police Sergeant Joseph Galik
complimented a small band of the
700 monitors of the committee
for helping patrol the
demonstration field.
Police stations near the park
reported several cases of
temporarily lost children and a
large number of cars towed away
for parking violations.
Most of the demonstrators left
the park by 5 p.m. but a few
thousand stayed until 7 p.m.
