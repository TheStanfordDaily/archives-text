# Massive M-Day Protest Staged In Washington, San Francisco
## 
### ED KOHN 
Washington and San Francisco
returned to normal yesterday
after weathering the largest peace
demonstrations in the nation's
history. More than 300,000
protesters turned out to march
down Pennsylvania Avenue to the
Washington Monument grounds in
the Capital, while the parade
along the Embarcadero to the
Polo Grounds drew over 100,000
youthful protesters.
But in Washington, a top
administration official criticized
the New Mobilization Committee
(New Mobe) Sunday and said that

the protest could not be termed
peaceful. Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell, one of President Nixon's
top advisers, said that the New
Mobe had failed to heed Justice
Department warnings of potential
danger.
There was limited violence in
the Capital Friday and Saturday.
Washington police used tear gas
several times as members of the
National Guard stood by to halt
splinter demonstrations and to
turn back marches on the South
Vietnamese Embassy and the
Justice Department. Troops were
quartered in the Justice
Department's building on
Pennsylvania Avenue during the
weekend.
Although there were about 150
arrests during the violence, few
injuries were reported. No
estimate was available last night of
the number of persons treated for
the effects of tear gas. Damage
was confined to several dozen
smashed windows in the
downtown section of the city.
"Fantastic Political Success"
The New Mobe specifically
disavowed the smaller
demonstrations on at least two
occasions during the weekend.
Ron Young, New Mobe's project
director, called Mitchell's
statement "a lie." He termed the
Washington march "a fantastic
political success."
"Yesterday, thousands of
people were gassed in Washington
by this government," Young
continued. "Yesterday, hundreds
of people were killed in Vietnam
by this government. Yesterday,
villages were destroyed in
Vietnam by this government."
He attributed the confusion
and violence to the government's
delay in granting parade, parking
and assembly permits. Young
criticized Mitchell's efforts to
dwell on the violent
demonstrations. "Eight hundred
thousand came and left this city
with only 150 arrests and very
few injuries," he said.
In his statement released by the
Justice Department, Mitchell said
that he was "pleased that the
great majority of participants
obeyed the law."
Mitcht'll Blasts Inaction
"Unfortunately, the planned
demonstrations were marred by
such extensive physical injury,
property damage and street
confrontations that I do not
believe that, overall, the gathering
here can be characterized as
peaceful. The committee aided
this violence through a
combination of inaction and
affirmative action," he said.
"The New Mobilization
Committee expected violence to
occur, and that was the result," he
continued. "The blame for the
violence must lie primarily with
the New Mobiization
Co m m i 11 e e—spec ifica lly wit h
those influential members of the
steering committee who knew the
gathering in Washington would be
a vehicle for violence."
Mitchell charged that the
committee "took no public action
to condemn these demonstrations
at which violence was expected ot

to disassociate itself and its
adherents from these
demonstrations. The committee
did not prepare adequate plans to
handle the expected disorders.
Instead the committee accused
the Department of Justice of
over-reacting."
In his remarks, Mitchell made
no comments on the San
Francisco march or the other
smaller demonstrations held
around the nation.
Demonstrations Dec. 24
Leaders of the New Mobe held
an all-day meeting in Washington
yesterday to map strategy for
December's efforts. Last night,
they announced plans to split the
December observance into two
segments, one Dec. 12-13 and the
other Dec. 24, Christmas Eve. No
other plans were announced at the
close of the strategy session.
President Nixon made no
comment on the demonstations.
He spent Saturday at the
sealed-off White House watching
televised football games and
conducting executive business.
However, noise from the nearby

demonstrations could clearly be
heard in the Executive Mansion.
Congressional response was
sparce. Senate Republican Leader
Hugh Scott (Pa.) said, "I do
believe the President is
listening . . . We really ought to
pay more attention to the
demonstrators."
Sen. John Sherman Cooper
(R-Ky.) told reporters after White
House church services yesterday
morning that he thought the
demonstrations "had a quiet
effect—but I don't think that it
changes the course of the war."
Biggest Protest Ever
The March on Washington was
the largest peace march ever to
take place in the Capital. Police
Chief Jerry V. Wilson estimated
the crowd at 300,000, and said
that his estimate was conservative.
The biggest demonstration before
Saturday's march had been Dr.
Martin Luther King's civil rights
march in August, 1963. That
protest attracted 210,000
protesters by official police
estimate.
No violence was reported in

any of the Mobe's
officially-sponsored activities in
Washington. The 9,000 members
of the 82nd Airborne Division,
called to the city for the planned
demonstrations, saw no action.
The National Guard was utilized,
but mostly as a back-up for the
police department.
Saturday's protesters responded
most emotionally to the
musicians, especially folk-singer
Pete Seeger, who helped ease
tensions during several tense
moments in the Monument
grounds rally. As he started to
sing, the crowd rose, flashed the
"V"and sang, "All we are saying
is give peace a chance" with
Seeger in the lead. Between
refrains, he yelled out, "Do you
hear us, Mr. Nixon?" and "Do
you hear us, Mr. Agnew?"
The crowd also roared its
approval when Sen. George
McGovern (D-S.D.) declared, "We
are all prisoners of war and we
long to be free." It also applauded
Mrs. Coretta King's denunciation
of the war for usurping too
much of the government's energy.
