# Peace Support Grows
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN LARRY DIAMOND 
Heavy participation in Stanford
anti-war acitvities Friday and
Saturday dispelled any fear the
the Moratorium is a dying
movement.
One of the largest marches for
peace in Peninsula history took
place Friday in the Stanford
Industrial Park. Estimates of the
turnout ranged from 2500 to

7000, while police estimated
"easily 5000."
1 An estimated one thousand
I Stanford students canvassed new
; areas in Redwood City and San
; Mateo, receiving dccidely more
enthusaistic response than the
r month before. Community
l members, joining the canvassing
I effort for the first time, worked in
1 the Palo Alto area.
> Also, on Friday 80 per cent of

the Stanford students honored the
national student strike and did
not attend class. Forty-two
courses, with a total enrollment of
6300 students, were cancelled on
Thursday and Friday.
Rock Concert
Friday night, nearly 1100
persons gathered in the downtown
Palo Alto Plaza for rock music
and a candlelight peace
procession.
On Saturday, more than 6000
people from the Stanford and
Palo Alto communities joined the
march in San Francisco, according
to Stanford Moratorium chairman
John Kramer. The number
included 23 busloads of Stanford
students and a large number of
the 225 professors who signed the
Faculty Witness denouncing the
war.
Kramer was enthused by the
results.
Canvassers, ho noted, received a
much more favorable response
than they did on OCtober 15. "A
lot of people on the fence came
over to our side this month. But
predictably, people who were
hostile before were doubly hostile
this month," he said.
"Apparently, comments from
Nixon and Agnew have tended to
polarize the public."
Community Support
Perhaps the most significant
development, in Kramer's
opinion, was the number of
people in the community who
became actively involved in
Moratorium activities this month.
Hundreds of residents,
recruited after showing an interest
during the October Moratorium,
â€¢ * l' M b v
passed out leaflets and
information.
And, Kramer added, "One
couldn't help but he heartened by
the number of workers from the
Industrial Park who joined the
march on Friday." He put the
number at more than 800.
The Moratorium was successful
nationally, Kramer said, in that
"we showed Nixon that the tactic
of appealing to the silent majority
and isolating the peace element
won't work. We're not a small
minority; we can't be isolated."
Plans Indefinite
Kramer had no definite plans
for next month's Moratorium; he
noted that it would take a few
days to make sense of what has
happened this month.
However he did offer a few
possibilities for action.
A two day shopping boycott by
members of the community was
one idea. "Businessmen," Kramer
said, "tended to be the most
paranoic group this month.
Operating on a low-profit margin,
they were afraid to alienate
customers.
"But we must show them that
they have customers who won't
tolerate business as usual while
this war goes on."
Recognizing that next month's
Moratorium will fall in the middle
of finals, Kramer stressed the
importance of activities for next
month that won't involve as much
time for Stanford students.
Pressure on Congress
David Jones, publisher of the
Moratorium newspaper, "The
Peacemonger," felt the main
significance of this month's
Moratorium lay in the fact that
"for the second month in a row,
with non-violent, communicative
tactics, we built a sense of
community."
"The not so hopeful sign is the
lack of comnent from the White
House and the Congress. We must
make it clear in the coming
months that those elected officials
who have not taken a stand in
support of the Moratorium will be
defeated in the next election."
Jones suggested a variety of
activities for next month.

He hopes that the community
support can be used to get
petitions signed that will put the
war issue on the ballot next year.
Also he suggested pressure be
applied to local city councils to
adopt resolutions in support of
the Moratorium.
Vacalion Efforts
Jones also looks forward to
many students using the
persuasive tactics they have gained
in the last two months to organize
their home communities over
Chirstmas vacation.
But for the moment, as John
Kramer noted, Moratorium
leaders will have to make some
sense out of what happened last
weekend. And not all the facts
will be easy to assess.
Though 80 per cent of the
students joined in the National
Student Strike Friday, most of
these were from classes that were
cancelled that day anyway. More
than half of the students whose
classes met on Friday attended
them, according to a sampling of
class attendance conducted by the
University News Service.
Employee Response
Also of significance,
absenteeism among the University
staff sharply contrasted the 80 per
cent effectiveness of the student
strike. Director of the Stanford
Physical Plant, Elbridge Bacon,
Jr., reported that of 222
employees, there was only one
absence that was not due to either
"bonafide sickness" or vacation
out of the area.
A call to the Manager of the
Food Services produced no figures
on Friday's absenteeism. But a
check of the University eating
residences indicated that there
was no observable decline in the
number of workers.
But if the facts on student and
staff absenteeism are puzzling, the
Moratorium leaders find cause for
optimism in the success of the
other activities.
Lockhced Engineer
A Lockheed engineer who
joined the march commented, "I
supported the Moratorium back in
October, but was afraid to tell
anyone but my wife. I was
impressed by the peaceful nature

of the demonstration and by the
good press coverage, so this time I
decided to join the march."
The engineer wore a black
armband back to work after the
march.
However, at many of the
industrial plants the marchers
were met by disapproving
onlookers. At Varian, workers
gave rather one-sided reactions:
"I think these people are out of
their minds."
"I'm against it; I think most

Varian employees are totally
against it."
"What's your solution, fella?"
"Looks like the Viet Cong
army down there."
Speeches
Speeches by Moratorium
leaders and local people
concluded the protest march. Mrs.
Anne Peabody Brown, of the
Women's League for Peace,
bewailed the great cost of the war
in lives, money, loss of allies and
confidence in the government."


MARCHING-Several thousand Mid-peiiinsulans joined peace stroll last Frida>
in Stanford Industrial Park. Industry workers watched the demonstrators as
they marched past 85 percent of the defense-oriented companies.
