# Peace Support Grows

### BOB LITTERMAN LARRY DIAMOND 
Heavy participation in Stanford
anti-war acitvities Friday and
Saturday dispelled any fear the
the Moratorium is a dying
movement.
One of the largest marches for
peace in Peninsula history took
place Friday in the Stanford
Industrial Park. Estimates of the
turnout ranged from 2500 to

7000, while police estimated
"easily 5000."
1 An estimated one thousand
I Stanford students canvassed new
; areas in Redwood City and San
; Mateo, receiving dccidely more
enthusaistic response than the
r month before. Community
l members, joining the canvassing
I effort for the first time, worked in
1 the Palo Alto area.
> Also, on Friday 80 per cent of

the Stanford students honored the
national student strike and did
not attend class. Forty-two
courses, with a total enrollment of
6300 students, were cancelled on
Thursday and Friday.
Rock Concert
Friday night, nearly 1100
persons gathered in the downtown
Palo Alto Plaza for rock music
and a candlelight peace
procession.
On Saturday, more than 6000
people from the Stanford and
Palo Alto communities joined the
march in San Francisco, according
to Stanford Moratorium chairman
John Kramer. The number
included 23 busloads of Stanford
students and a large number of
the 225 professors who signed the
Faculty Witness denouncing the
war.
Kramer was enthused by the
results.
Canvassers, ho noted, received a
much more favorable response
than they did on OCtober 15. "A
lot of people on the fence came
over to our side this month. But
predictably, people who were
hostile before were doubly hostile
this month," he said.
"Apparently, comments from
Nixon and Agnew have tended to
polarize the public."
Community Support
Perhaps the most significant
development, in Kramer's
opinion, was the number of
people in the community who
became actively involved in
Moratorium activities this month.
Hundreds of residents,
recruited after showing an interest
during the October Moratorium,
