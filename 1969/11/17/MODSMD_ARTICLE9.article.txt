# Join Us ... Boycott G.E.!
## 'Where Profit Is Our Product' 
### Julie Roemer 
This morning at the Placement
Center and the Business School a
recruiter from General Electric
will be talking to Stanford
students about becoming
employees of GE.
Also this morning, in Oakland
and San Jose and all over the
country, 147,000 men and
women already employed by GE
will be walking picket lines and
battling police in front of their
struck plants. The striking
employees are electrical workers,
machinists, men and women who
belong to at least 11 unions which
have joined forces to fight the
nation's 4th largest corporation.

The GE recruiter is looking for
students to enter the fields of
Personnel Accounting,
Information Systems, Data
Processing, Business Analysis and
Planning—the management side of
General Electric. Don't expect to
ever see a recruiter from one of
the 11 striking unions, the
working side of GE, at the
Placement Center in an official
capacity. Stanford University does
not exist to serve the needs of
these working people; it exists to
serve the needs of those who run
the corporations. Stanford is true
to itself—working conditions of its
staff are notoriously bad. There

are people who have worked in
the cafeterias and dormitories for
as long as eight years who take
home less than $400/ month.
Stanford is also supporting
another corporation to the
detriment of its workers. The
Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel
workers have been out on strike
for 2'/s months. Stanford uses
PDM steel and has continued to
receive deliveries of steel since the
strike began.
Poverty Wages
Why are the workers of General
Electric striking against the
company?
The average wage of a GE

worker is $3.25/ hour, or
$6500/ year. In the Bay Area it
takes at least $9000/ year for a
family of four to live decently.
GE workers need a higher wage,
and with inflation what it is, they
need a provision in their contract
for the rising cost of living. They
have demanded a 90c/hour wage
increase distributed over a 30
month period (35c the first year,
30c the second and 25c the third)
and a penny-for-penny cost of
living clause. The company has
offered a one year contract with a
20c/hour raise and no cost of
living provision. In fact, in its new
proposal, GE has eliminated a
clause for partial cost of living
increases which the old contract
contained.
The striking unions don't
expect it to be easy to bargain
with General Electric. Refusing to
bargain has been a GE policy for
more than 20 years. One company
vice president described the policy
this way: "We decide what is fair,
then we stick to it. We don't go in
for haggling." GE has been found
guilty of unfair labor practices by
the US Court of Appeals. A "take
it or leave it" policy such as GE's
is a violation of the National
Labor Relation's Act mandate "to
bargain in good faith."
Super-Inflation
The unions have also demanded
improved retirement benefits.
Right now, when a GE worker
retires, he receives an average of
only $29 a week from the
company's pension fund.
Chairman of the Board Fred
Borch, on the other hand, will get
$1175 a week when he retires.
Borch, ironically enough, has
self-righteously accused the
striking workers of making
"super-inflationary demands."
The idea is that wage increases
force prices up. The workers don't
believe that the burden of

stopping the inflation should be
put on them. They are barely
getting by, while GE's profits
alter taxes in 1968 were $350
million, and profits in 1969 have
increased over last year by 11%!!
Last October Nixon and leaders
of the 100 biggest corporations
(GE included) met and agreed
that the war in Vietnam is
producing the inflation. General
Electric is second place among the
top 10 corporations with military
contracts. From 1961 to 1967 GE
received $7,166,000 on war
contracts—a fifth of its total
business. In 1968 20% of all sales
by GE were of defense
products—V 4 of its total sales. GE
now holds the ABM contract. The
workers don't decide which
contracts GE will accept—Borch
and the Board of Directors do.
Who is responsible for the
inflation?
It is clear that striking against
GE means more than wage
demands. It means dealing a blow
to a profit hungry, war mongering
institution that is hurting all of us.
GE's slogan should be "Where
Profit is our Most Important
Product, No Matter What." Each
day, the workers and the people
of Vietnam must live with the
consequences of this ruthlessness.
Today we can support the
workers' struggle for a more
decent life as well as take an
action against the war. Beginning
at 9, there will be a picket line at
the placement center to protest
the presence of the GE
management recruiter on campus.
At noon there will be a rally at
which workers from GE, PDM and
Stanford will speak.
Support the GE strike—Don't
cross the picket line—Join Us.
Boycott GE!
