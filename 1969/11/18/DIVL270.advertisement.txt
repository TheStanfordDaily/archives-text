1$ Now don't mix us with Hensley's "Church".
It's not recognized by the Federal gov't as a reli- |3j
| gious organization. We are. lie ordains dead
jJ* people, elephants, dogs, r>oou people with a hand
||| wave. IMb ordinations are worth what you paid
Our members are ministers like the Jcho- j®
gj| \ah's Witnesses and other bona fide religions.
We're a resistance church. We fight the V.N. B
® war the only way we can. We want people who
HI work for, not kill, their follow man. We don't
|p want just dralt uougers. ®
HI I)i\initv students get " greetings" on grad
jg| nation. That's not our bag. Working ministers jra
i§| ire exempted because the law prohibits leaving
congregations without clergy. Our ministers lead
§| congregations, hold full time jobs because we do
M not pav them, work after hours for their Church. |3|
Ministerial work is their primary vocation. Our
® legal stall supports our ministers.
