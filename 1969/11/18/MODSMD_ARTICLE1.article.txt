# Washington March: A View
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
WASHINGTONâ€”"Where's the silent majority now?"
screamed a middle-aged man, walking down Pennsylvania
Avenue in Washington, D.C. last Saturday morning.
"There are so many people here," he shouted to the
crowd while listening to a news report on his transistor
radio, "That they don't dare count them."
People . . . people everywhere . . . the largest number of
demonstrators for peace ever to march on the capitol.
Washington D.C. looked like a scenario from the
Population Bomb . . . swarms of people of every age and
description were lined up for hours all the way from the
steps of the Capitol building to the foot of the
Washington Monument . . . thousands more were sitting
on the lawn by the Monument ... a comparable number
were lining up on neighboring streets, patiently waiting to
march on Pennsylvania Avenue . . . countless more were
continually arriving on over 800 busses.
People in wheelchairs turned out for the march. Little
children clutched to their parents as they walked through
the streets. "Daddy, what does this sign say again?" asked
a four-year old, carrying a painted placard which read,
"Come together."
Signs everywhere . . . "Effete snobs for
peace" . . . "We're the vocal majority; look for the silent
one somewhere else" . . . "If we seek peace, let us do it
peacefully" . . . "Old People, if you support the war, fight
it yourselves" . . . "Would you let YOUR daughter marry
a general?" . . . "Agnew, shut up!"
Even little groups displaying signs such as "Peace is in
Reality; support the President" stood on several street
corners, but in the words of one student, "This time they
were the silent minority."
Good Citizens
"This march is sponsored by good American citizens,"
one lady wearing a button saying, 'Women for Peace,"
commented. Yet it seemed as if every conceivable and
often irrelevant ideology was being promulgated by
groups of marchers: everything from "Support Ho Chi

Minh" to "Only Jesus Christ can save us" to "Help send
300 Americans to Cuba."
Despite the multitude of minority ideologies, it soon
became evident that much of the march would take on a
patriotic tone. Many in the crowd carried American flags,
sang "The Battle Hymm of the Republic," and talked
about their commitment as "good citizens" to ending the
war.
At one point a make-shift bugle corps started playing
the national anthem. Most of the marchers in the area
stopped to listen, their hands upraised making
two-fingered peace signs. On top of a near-by building, a
band of solemn policemen surveyed the crowd. Overhead
a kite in the shape of a dove waved in the uncertain
breeze.
"We want to show Mr. Nixon," Professor Richard Falk
had said at an assembly I had attended at Princeton
University Thursday night, "that the new patriotism of
the nuclear age will cause a people to oppose even its own
government when the government's behavior emperils the
peace and welfare of mankind."
Yesterday A Commie
"Gee, yesterday I was a hippie communist, and now
I'm a patriot," one bearded, beaded demonstrator
chuckled.
A number of military police were stationed at street
corners. A student stopped to take a picture. One of the
MP's flashed him a peace sign.
Shortly after noon, a voice announced over an
unlocated P.A. system that the march had to stop shortly
because the time permit was running out. The teeming
masses, however, seemed unthreatened by the
announcement. Shouts of "Peace Now," turned into
"March NOW," and the demonstration continued far into
the afternoon.
"Try and stop us," one lady shouted, waving a sign
which read, "Rich boys go to college, poor boys die in
Vietnam." "There aren't enough jails on the entire
Eastern seaboard to put these people in!" she yelled.
Press helicopters hoovered over the crowds who were

chanting, "1, 2, 3, 4 . . . Tricky Dicky, stop the war." A
number of grim faces stared out of windows in the Bureau
of Internal Revenue building. "Join us. Come down with
us," the crowd shouted.
The faces just stared.
Freezing Cold
The crisp, sub-frezing weather sent some of the
marchers prematurely away from the march to find
shelter in nearby over-crowded drug stores while most
others braved the cold, some hopping down he street,
chanting "Jump for Peace and warm your toes!"
By about 5 p.m. the brilliantly-executed MOBE
activities were about over, but a lot of the marchers made
their way over to the Department of Justice Building for a
non-MOBE-sponsored activity, simply slated as a
"demonstration to free all political prisoners." The
atmosphere of the demonstrating, however, began to
change. Suddenly hundreds of white-helmeted policemen
appeared on the streets, as if poised in readiness. A band
of several hundred marchers carrying signs with "Yippie"
insignia and other slogans began marching past the Justice
building shouting "Free Bobby Seale." Two girls came up
to us and suggested that we leave the area.
"There's going to be trouble," they warned. "These
people believe in killing for peace."
There was a crackling sound behind us; two men
wearing berets had split a stick of wood in half and
proceeded to carry the pieces out into the street.
More marchers appeared carrying bricks and blocks of
wood. Some of them had put on gas masks.
Suddenly troops came stampeding out of some
gate . . . police cars began to fill the streets . . . "What's
happening?" . . ."Gooddammit, they're throwing tear
gas."
People looked for ways to get out of the area. Some of
the marshalls who had kept order so efficiently in the
morning began directing people out of the area.
"We can't go that way," someone shouted, "the street's
covered with tear gas."

STARS AND BTRIPES-A dominant theme of last Saturday's march on
Washington was patriotism. Many of the anti-war marchers, such as the man
above, carried the flag to say that they love their country, and still oppose the
Vietnam war.
Tear gas . . . suddenly tear gas
everywhere . . . "How did this get
started?" ... A small group of
angry militant demonstrators
crowd around the Justice
building, throwing
rocks . . . breaking
windows . . . more gas . . . "None
of us wanted THIS to happen!"
"If you don't dig violence," a
marshall screams, "just keep
moving. Go back to your busses."
Get back to the
busses . . . can't ... policemen
blocking the streets . . . police cars
surrounding the city's
blocks . . . demonstrators running

in all directions . . . "Please, let
me get back to my bus!"
People
"Police units," cries a voice
over a loud speaker, "please
dispense with the tear gas. People
are trying to get back to their
busses."
"I think the troops were
throwing most of the gas,"
someone else adds. "A couple
minutes ago, a few of us were
milling around with a group of
cops, asking directions. Suddenly
the troops started throwing gas at
the people and the cops, too.
Once they started lobbing gas,
they really got carried away."
But nobody knows what the
troops were actually doing.
