## Barry Smeared 
### Mike Wolf 
Daily Reporter Chris Cobey has
done a very nasty job of smearing
Sen. Barry Goldwater and the
Republican Party with his account
of Goldwater's response to the
question, "Why is it that
Republicans are so anti-black?".
The way Cobey reports
Goldwater's answer is to clearly
imply that Goldwater admitted
the questioner's assumption, that
is, that Republicans are indeed
anti-black. Any sophisticated
observer would immediately
doubt Cobey's journalistic
integrity (Even if Goldwater
believed that, he would never
admit it publicly!).
Unfortunately, one cannot be
very sure of either the
sophistication or the sensibility of
those who are most likely to be
influenced by the Daily's
reportage.
So to set the vulgar record
straight I'd like to point out that
Goldwater began by denying that
he or Republicans in general are
anti-black. The Senator said he
could appreciate how the notion
developed, and he proceeded to
describe how since the New Deal,
Negroes have generally delivered
themselves to the Democrats and
repudiated the Republicans.
Senator Goldwater himself is
unequivocally committed—and he
always has been—to racial justice.
His public record eloquently
testifies to the substantial efforts
he has made to eliminate racial
discrimination in Arizona, in the
m i 1 i tary, and in the
country -at-large.
The moving plea for human
brotherhood and social justice
that Sen. Goldwater presented—to
roaring ovations—at the Miami
Convention last year was the
statement of a position he has
championed for decades. Indeed
the inviolable dignity of every

human being is the fundamental
principle of Goldwater's
conservative philosophy.
Just before his speech Senator
Goldwater told a group of
students that he supports the
recent decision of the Supreme
Court—delivered, by the way,
under Nixon's Republican Chief
Justice—ordering the immediate
elimination of segregation in the
South.
The assertion that the
Republican Party is racist or
anti-black is so absurd that it
would not merit refutation if it
were not for the even more
astounding fact that these
brainless Stanford students insist
upon believing it.
Two other national Republican
officials with records as
unimpeachable as Goldwater's
have visited Stanford this quarter;
and both of them, Colorado's Sen.
Peter Dominick and HEW
Secretary Robert Finch, have
emphatically underlined their
commitment to civil rights.
Everyone with any sense at all
knows that the Republican Party
has been busting its ass trying to
recruit blacks and other minority
group members into the Party and
into the Republican State and
national administrations.
But those who have some
craving to believe that
Republicans are racist will not
believe me any more than they'll
believe Sen. Goldwater, Sen.
Dominick, or Secretary Finch.
Still, I'm so sick of their
detestable prating that I throw
them this challenge: Why don't
some of you morons come talk to
the Stanford Young Republicans
and see what we think about
blacks—or Mexican-Americans, or
anyone else?
(Mike Wolf is President of the
Stanford Young Republicans.)
