## Critical Look At Theory Of Consumerism 
### Ellen Willis 
EDITOR 'S NOTE: This article
was submitted to THE DAILY by
the Stanford Radical Libertarian
Alliance. It is reprinted from the
October 15 issue of THE
CLE A VER (University of
California—Riverside). This is the
first of two parts.
Perhaps the most widely
accepted tenet of the movement
ideology, promulgated by many
leftist thinkers, notably Marcuse,
is the idea that we are psychically
manipulated by the mass media to
crave more and more consumer
goods, thus powering an economy
that depends on constantly
expanding sales. It has been
suggested that this theory is
especially applicable to women,
for women do most of the buying,
their consumption is often
directly related to their
oppression, (e.g. makeup,
soapflakes), and they are a special
target of advertisers. According to
this view the society defines

women as consumers and the
purpose of the prevailing media
image of women as passive sexual
objects is to sell products. It
follows that the beneficiaries of
this depreciation of women are
not men but the corporate power
structure.
Invu Inerability
The consumerism theory has
not been subjected to much
critical debate. In fact, it seems in
recent years to have taken on the
invulnerability of religious dogma.
Yet further analysis demonstrates
that this theory is fallacious and
leads to crucial tactical errors.
This paper is offered as a critique
of consumerism based on four
propositions. 1. It is not psychic
manipulation that makes people
buy; rather their buying habits are
by and large a rational and
self-interested response to their
limited alternatives within the
system. 2. The chief function of
media stereotypes of women is
not to sell goods but to reinforce
the ideology and therefore the
reality of male supremacy—of the
economic and sexual
subordination of women to men,
in the latter's objective interest. 3.
Most of what the "consuming"
women do is actually labor,
specifically part of women's
domestic and sexual obligation. 4.
The consumerism theory had its
roots in class, sex, and race bias;
its ready acceptance among
radicals, including radical women,
is a function of movement elitism.
Oppressive Profit System
First of all, there is nothing
inherently wrong with
consumption. Shopping and
consuming are enjoyable human
activities and the marketplace has
been a center of social life for
thousands of years. The profit
system is oppressive not because

relatively trivial luxuries are
available, but because basic
necessities are not. The locus of
the oppression resides in the
production functions: people have
no control over what commodities
are produced (or services
performed), in what amounts,
under what conditions, or how
they are distributed. Corporations
make these decisions solely for
their own profit. It is more
profitable to produce luxuries for
the affluent (or for that matter
for the poor, on exploitative
installment plans) than to produce
and make available food, housing,
medical care, education,
recreational and cultural facilities
according to he needs and desires
of the people. We can accept the
goods offered to us or reject
them, but we cannot determine
their quality or change the
system's priorities. In a truly
humane society, in which all the
people have personal autonomy,
control over the means of
production, and equal access to
goods and services, consumption
will be all the more enjoyable
because we will not have to
endure shoddy goods sold at
exploitive prices by means of
dishonest advertising.
As it is, the profusion of
commodities is a genuine and
powerful compensation for
oppression. It is a bribe, but like
all bribes if offers concrete
benefits—in the average America's
case, a degree of physical comfort
unparalleled in history. Under
present conditions, people are
preoccupied with consumer goods
not because they are brainwashed
but because buying is the one
pleasurable activity not only
permitted but actively encouraged
by the power structure. The
pleasure of eating an ice cream

cone may be minor compared tp
the pleasure of meaningful,
autonomous work, but the former
is easily available and the latter is
not. A poor family would
undoubtedly rather have a decent
apartment than a new TV, but
since they are unlikely to et the
apartment, what is to be gained
by not getting the TV?
Media Manipulation
Radicals who in general are
healthily skeptical of facile
Freudian explanations have been
quick to embrace a theory of
media manipulation based
squarely on Freud, as popularized
by market researchers and
journalists like Vance Packard
(Marcuse acknowledges Packard's
influence in One Dimensional
Man). In essence, this theory
holds that ads designed to create
unconscious associations between
merchandise and deep-seated
fears, sexual desires, and needs for
identity and self-esteem induce

people to buy products in search
of gratifications no product can
provide. Furthermore, the
corporations, through the media,
deliberately create fears and
desires that their prodcuts can
claim to fulfill. The implication is
that we are not simply taken in by
lies or exaggerations—as, say, by
the suggestion that a certain
perfume will make us sexually
irresistible —but are physically
incapable of learning from
experience and will continue to
buy no matter how often we are
disappointed, and that in any case
our "need" to be sexually
irrestible is programmed into us to
keep us buying perfume. This
hypothesis of psychic distortion is
based on the erroneous
assumption that mental health
and anti-materialism are
synonymous.
Although they have to cope
with the gyppery inherent in the
profit system, people for the most
part buy goods for practical,
self-interested reasons. A washing
machine does make a housewife's
work easier (in the absence of
socialization of housework);
Excedrin does make a headache
go away; a car does provide
transportion. If one is duped into
buying a product because of
misleading advertising, the process
is called exploitation; it has
nothing to do with brainwashing.
Advertising is a how-to manual on
the consumer economy,
constantly reminding us of what is
available and encouraging us to
indulge ourselves. It works (that
is, stimulates sales) because
buying is the only game in town,
not vice versa. Advertising does
appeal to morbid fears (e.g. body
odors) and false hopes (of
irresistibility) and shoppers faced
with indistinguishable brands of a

product may choose on the basis
of an ad (what method is
better—eeny meeny miny mo?)
but this is just the old game of
caveat emptor. It thrives on
naivete and people learn to resist
it through experience. The worst
suckers for ads are children. Other
vulnerable groups are older
people, who had no previous
experience—individual oi"
historical—to guide them when
the consumer cornucopia
suddenly developed after World
War 11, and poor people, who do
not have enough money to learn
through years of trial, error and
disillusionment to be shrewd
consumers. The constant
refinement of advertising claims,
visual effects and so on show that
experience decensitizes. No one
really believes that smoking Brand
X cigarettes will make you sexy.
(The function of sex in an ad is
probably the obvious one—to lure
people into paying closer
attention to the ad—rather than to
make them "identify" their lust
with a product. The chief effect
of the heavy sexual emphasis in
advertising has been to stimulate a
national preoccupation with sex,
showing that you can't identify
away a basic human drive as easily
as all that.) Madison Avenue has
inceasingly deemphasized the
"motivational" techniques in
favor of aesthetic ones—TV
commercials in particular have
become incredibly inventive
visually—and even made a joke out
of the old motivational ploys (the
phallicc Virginia Slims ad, for
instance, is blatantly campy.) We
can conclude from this that either
the depth psychology approach
never worked in he first place, or
that it has stopped working as
consumers have gotten more
sophisticated.
