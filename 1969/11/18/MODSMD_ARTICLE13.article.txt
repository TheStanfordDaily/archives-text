# Diverse Group Marches For Peace As Indifferent Executives Look On

### FRANK MILLER 
Participants symbolically
offered Communion to a young
priest, reverently dropping a few
coins into a waiting coffee can.
The priest, dressed simply in his
black cassock, circulated among
the crowd shaking the coffee can
and pleaded with both eyes and
words, "We have a responsibility
for the maimed Vietnamese
people." Those who responded
were rewarded with a mumbled,
''God bless you."

Commentar\

Priests, students, children,
professors, businessmen, and
housewives stood and sat in the
stickers of an open field at
Hanover Street and Page Mill
Road Friday and listened to
emotional, sometimes bitter
speeches, all denouncing the
Vietnam War. They were
congratulated for their efforts and
their sincerity. They left satisfied
and determined to do more.
The demonstrators had
marched through the streets of
Stanf rd Industrial Park,
dominated by the corporate elite
of America. They had carried
signs, made jokes, and been
watched by the workers and
executives of those corporations.
Those who had watched were
greeted with a myriad of people,
colors, and actions.
Vcls for Peace
A McDonald's Hamburger Hat
sitting on top of his white hair,

the Golden Arches replaced by
the words "Vets for Peace in
Vietnam," an elderly man
struggled to guide the crowd along
the right road. Attired in the
traditional khaki uniform of the
Army with a few additions—black
arm band, "Out Now" button,
and a peace symbol, his face lined
in pain and concentration, he
tried to limp up the hill faster
than the crowd could walk.
White collar workers and
secretaries on their lunch hour
spied on the marchers from
behind fences and ominous signs,
"Private Property. Trespassing
Forbidden by Law.
Hewlett-Packard." They stood in
small groups of three or four for
moral support although they
didn't talk to each other very
often. They just watched, trying
to make up their minds.
The parade strolled along
largely ignoring, or trying to
ignore, the workers. An
anonymous shout rang out from
the crowd, "Liberate yourselves;
get out of jail." A white smocked
young girl retorted from behind
the locked gate, "We're not in
jail." Another marcher joked,
"Look at all those people
watching us. 1 wonder if they're
fascists. They must be or they
would be marching." A green
jumper and white blouse hiding
behind the zoo type
Hewlett-Packard fence shouted
encouragingly, "See you
tomorrow."
Immoral War
Kaiser Aerospace and
Electronics, Alfred Electronics,

Computer Usage Development
Corporation, Control Data
Corporation, and the Wall Street
Journal momentarily transformed
themselves from unknown and
innocent corporations into
symbols of the "immoral war."
The minds of marchers
wandered elsewhere. "1
understand that snow is heavy in
the Sierras already. Have you ever
been up in Yosemite for the
snow? It's beautiful." One giddy
girl's voice squealed briefly,
"Marcia, my parents won't be
home tonight."
Two very sophisticated
students argued world politics, "I
think Latin America is going to be
a lot more stable than many
people think. There are too many
fucking imperialists." Monitors
pleaded, "Folks, let's just take up
half the road. Six abreast please."
But the marchers largely ignored
the petitions.
Polished Shoes
A few spied a cameraman
hiding behind a bush. "We're the
ones with polished shoes,"
someone shouted as numerous
hands instinctively formed peace
signs for the camera.
The 5000 marchers straggled by
54 businessmen lined up single file
in their business uniforms—white
shirt and tie. They looked down
on the marchers from their secure
haven 20 yards above the street.
Shy, superior grins dotted some of
their faces. Something interesting
must have dragged them away
from their roast beef sandwiches.
Diversity dominated the march;
wh ite-shirted businessmen,

bra less, "liberated" young
women, and housewives all united
in this one effort. A fortyish
woman who looked like she had
just come from an afternoon
meeting puzzled a few observers.
Neatly arrayed in seamed
stockings, a wool plaid skirt—just
long enough to cover her knees, a
long sleeve beige blouse, a black
arm band, and carrying an
imitation leather purse she
marched with the radicals and
hippies and joked about the
"monkeys looking out from their
cages."
Mini-Marchers and Parents
Children clutching their
parents' hands plaintively
implored, "Are we almost there?"
One topless girl aged four or'five
danced in front of her bearded
father fitted out in an unbuttoned
work shirt, blue jeans, and
sandals. Nearby another
mini-marcher rode on the
shoulders of her plump
businessman father while one
small son searched each side
pocket for loose change.
Everyone came from a huge
fashion show, decked out in the
latest Mod fashions, grubby jeans
with splattered paint, or
conservative dresses for the
women with "better taste."
The marchers reached their
destination and suddenly they
transfigured the signs they had
been carrying into cushions on the
dirt, thorns, and rocks of the
vacant lot. Many explored in vain
for clean places to sit. Those in
skirts and suits wished they had
worn something more casual; they

of November Moratorium activities,
stood to hear the speakers while
thy others sat.
Collection Boxes
Folk singing began as the crowd
prepared themselves for the
anti-climatic speeches. Orange and
yellow Peninsula Creamery
Buttermilk cartons transformed
themselves into collection boxes.
They were passed among the
congregation to cries of "help pay
for the cause."
Many took advantage of the
gathering to vend their wares. One
salesman hawking the Plain
Rapper, an underground
newspaper, droned: "Do some
heavy reading while you're
waiting. Find out about the
Japanese student movement. Only
a quarter."
An elderly man, absorbed in
the rhetoric clung desparately to a
full sized American flag.
Newspapermen circulated
obtrusively among the crowd and
television cameras whirred like
vultures waiting for death.
Busy Intersection
Shiny Oldsmobiles, Fords, and
an occasional Cadillac drove
cautiously through the jumbled,
confused intersection. Their

drivers glanced quickly and often
quizzically at the 5000 people.
The speeches droned on broken
with occasional applause. "Our
plan is peace and we're proud of
it." A girl crocheting a green and
brown flower glanced up.
Big Game Gaieties balloons
floated off leaving behind other
Stanford emblems—sweatshirts,
jackets, and copies of the
Stanford Daily.
Vultures and Doves
Pigeons flew over the gathering
prompting talk of vultures and
doves. KRON TV.s one-armed
correspondent stood in the middle

of the brown field with the
demonstrations in the background
preaching his summary of the
events of the day. When he left
the rally early to meet his
deadline for the 7 p.m. news,
many waved good-bye.
Children grew restless, part of
the crowd drifted off, but then it
was over. Everyone walked off
and left the press mongrels and
march organizers to stare at the
crushed weeds and empty field.
The marchers had shown their
opposition to the Vietnam War
and suddenly it was just another
cool, cloudy, smoggv day.
