# At Placement Center
## SDS Pickets GE Recruiter 
### BOB MICHELET 
A small group of Stanford
students quietly protested the
presence of a General Electric
recruiter yesterday with picketing,
leafleting and a noon rally.
The demonstration, sponsored
by the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) Labor Committee,
was centered around the
Placement Service where a GE
representative was holding job
interviews.
Activities began shortly before
9 a.m. when about five students
started picketing and handing out
leaflets.
By 9:30, the group had
doubled with nine students
holding signs and another
leafleting, and by 9:45, the
protesters formed a line to march

in a circle near the Placement
Service entrance.
Activities continued the same
throughout the morning.
Demands, Support Outlined
The leaflets outlined the wage
claims of striking GE workers and
called for Stanford students "to
show support for the struggles of
workers in industry and on
campus by actively opposing the
GE management."
A second leaflet, signed the Bay
Area Boycott GE Committee,
called for the boycott of products
to "pressure the management into
dealing fairly with their
employees."
Included among the picket sign
slogans were "No Freedom to
Recruit Exploiters," "Support GE
Workers-Ban GE Recruiters,"

and "Smash US Imperialism-
Support GE Workers."
Noon Rally Held
At noon, the group enlarged a
bit and moved to White Plaza for
a rally. Included were speeches on
why students should support GE
workers and the boycott.
Two workers from a local GE
operation and one from the struck
Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel
Company also spoke. The SDS
recently aided picket lines in the
latter strike until union officials
asked them to stop.
Following the speeches, a skit
was presented about Stanford
students boycotting GE. The rally
drew only a small crowd and
concluded the day's activities.
Recruiting Unaffected
At the Placement Service,
meanwhile, the recruiting took
place without incident. An official
there said the GE representative
arrived before the demonstrators,
carried on interviews as usual and
was aware of the protest, but had
no comment. The situation was
described as "peaceful," with
normal operations.
One of the demonstrators said
their reaction was "one of
success," that they were "glad to
see some action taken."
Disappointment was expressed,
however, that many students
ignored the leaflets and rally.
Actions Considered
With apathy a big problem,
supplementary actions are being
considered. Going into dorms to
discuss the situation, possibly this
Sunday, is one suggestion.
Action against GE will
definitely continue, though.

Another recruiter is scheduled on
campus in early December.
Further, though as yet
unspecified, action is being
planned by the Labor Committee.
Early during the
demonstration, a student showed
his opposition to the SDS actions
by quietly sitting hear the
building with a package of GE
light bulbs.
