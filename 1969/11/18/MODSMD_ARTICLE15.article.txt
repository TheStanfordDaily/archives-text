# Leafleter Arrested
## 
### 
A Stanford Medical School
student was arrested Friday
afternoon after Menlo Park police
said he obstructed rush hour
traffic while passing out
Moratorium leaflets.
Police said Andrew P. Smith,
24, of Menlo Park, was booked at
San Mateo County Jail for
obstructing a roadway, resisting
arrest, and assault and battery on
an officer. They gave the
following account:
Smith was passing out leaflets
in the divider and in the traffic
lane of El Camino Real about
4:30 p.m. When officers told him
to move onto the sidewalk, police
said he told them "You can't
arrest me," and "I'll be right back
out as soon as you leave."
When he went back onto the
street, officers placed him under
arrest. They said he began yelling
and scuffling, and knocked one
officer in the chest with his elbow
before being subdued.
