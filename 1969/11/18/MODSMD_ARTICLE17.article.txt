LONDON â€” International
support for the Vietnam
Moratorium demonstrations
among anti-war groups in Britain
has increased sharply since the
October protests. A massive rally
and march in downlown London
is planned for November 23.
The Vietnam Mobilization
Committee, a united front of
groups and organizations in
England opposed to the Vietnam
War and Britain's complicity in
the war, plan a march from Hyde
Park through the heart of London
to a rally in Trafalgar Square.
The British committee planned
the demonstration after the
American Student Mobilization
Committee to End the War in
Vietnam made a call for
international anti-war protests
between October 15 and
December 15. Solidarity with the
nationwide Moratorium in the
United States and a call for an
immediate withdrawl from
Vietnam were among the points
mentioned in the Committee's
leaflet, which is being widely
circulated on English college
campuses.
The leaflet also calls for the
recognition of the provisional
revolutionary government of the
National Liberation Front (NLF)
and an NLF victory.
British students took little part
in last month's demonstration in
front of the American Embassy in
London, which was organized
primarily by and for American
students in England.
About 400 persons, including

students from over nine American
colleges and universities, picketed
peacefully across the street from
the embassy for most of the day.
The demonstration ended with a
candlelight vigil and the singing ol
anti-war songs.
The protesters had asked that
the embassy close for the day and
fly the flag at half-staff. The
American ambassador refused
these demands and would not
meet with protest leaders, several
of whom had petitions they
wanted the ambassador to
forward to President Nixon.
About half of the students at
Stanford-in-Britain took part in
the October picketing. No definite
plans have been formulated for
future action, however, a number
of students are planning to
participate in the march and rally
on November 23.
