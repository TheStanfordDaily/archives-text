# Sponsor Program To Be Investigated
## 
### SKIP HARRIS 
The Freshman Sponsor
Program has proven itself quite
capable of arousing strong
sentiment. Administered entirely
by students, it is susceptible to
student criticism from both
without and within. Hardly an
enviable position.
External critism often indicts
the selection committee for being
biased. Many feel that the
program is the self-perpetuating
pork-barrel of the radical
"establishment". The internal
criticism is frequently directed
against that other, much more
solidly entrenched, administrative
organ.
To quote a sponsor, Mark Paul,
writing in Chaparral earlier this
year: "The quiet bureaucratic
tactics of Pitzer and friends are
slowly eating away what real
student independence exists on
campus . . .If Pitzer gets his way,
sponsors will be carefully screened
to eliminate students who pose a
threat to the administration's
point of view."
The latter sentiment was
prompted by word that there
would be a committee formed to
investigate the program. The
Dean's Office admits that this is,
more or less, the truth. The
committee is the University
Committee on Extra-Curriculum.
It will soon begin discussions on
the whole question of residence
staffing.
The committee is meeting in
direct response to a
recommendation passed down
from the Committee on
Short-Term Housing last Spring. It
is meeting in indirect response to
the number of questions which

have been raised regarding, not
only the Sponsor Program, but
also The Resident Assistant and
Faculty Resident programs.
Maturity, Experience
No doubt the committee will
consider the role that sponsors
play in the dorms. Roger Boesche
and Carolyn Bixby, head sponsors
this year, feel the sponsor's role to
offer maturity, experience, and a
"challenging intellect" to the
freshmen. He is not to be a junior
law-enforcement official.
The way sponsors actually
conceive their roles depends on
the individual spons r.
Nonetheless, the sponsor selection
committee tries to combine its
ideal of what a sponsor type
should be with a desire for
diversity of backgrounds and
interests. One of the major
criticisms of the program is that
the selection committee falls far
short of this goal. Many students
have charged that to be a sponsor
one must be a friend of several
sponsors, a non-science major, a
non-fraternity resident, and a
political radical.
If this charge can be
substantiated, it might prove
strong evidence against having the
program run by students. While a
sponsor does not receive nearly as
much compensation as a Resident
Assistant (who is usually a
graduate student), the job is not
without its rewards. This year a
sponsor has a single room in a
university residence. For this
room he pays the sum of $38.00 a
quarter.
Tomorrow the Daily will
review the sponsor selection
process

Maturity, Experience
No doubt the committee will
consider the role that sponsors
play in the dorms. Roger Boesche
and Carolyn Bixby, head sponsors
this year, feel the sponsor's role to
offer maturity, experience, and a
"challenging intellect" to the
freshmen. He is not to be a junior
law-enforcement official.
The way sponsors actually
conceive their roles depends on
the individual spons r.
Nonetheless, the sponsor selection
committee tries to combine its
ideal of what a sponsor type
should be with a desire for
diversity of backgrounds and
interests. One of the major
criticisms of the program is that
the selection committee falls far
short of this goal. Many students
have charged that to be a sponsor
one must be a friend of several
sponsors, a non-science major, a
non-fraternity resident, and a
political radical.
If this charge can be
substantiated, it might prove
strong evidence against having the
program run by students. While a
sponsor does not receive nearly as
much compensation as a Resident
Assistant (who is usually a
graduate student), the job is not
without its rewards. This year a
sponsor has a single room in a
university residence. For this
room he pays the sum of $38.00 a
quarter.

The Freshman Sponsor
Program has proven itself quite
capable of arousing strong
sentiment. Administered entirely
by students, it is susceptible to
student criticism from both
without and within. Hardly an
enviable position.
External critism often indicts
the selection committee for being
biased. Many feel that the
program is the self-perpetuating
pork-barrel of the radical
"establishment". The internal
criticism is frequently directed
against that other, much more
solidly entrenched, administrative
organ.
To quote a sponsor, Mark Paul,
writing in Chaparral earlier this
year: "The quiet bureaucratic
tactics of Pitzer and friends are
slowly eating away what real
student independence exists on
campus . . .If Pitzer gets his way,
sponsors will be carefully screened
to eliminate students who pose a
threat to the administration's
point of view."
The latter sentiment was
prompted by word that there
would be a committee formed to
investigate the program. The
Dean's Office admits that this is,
more or less, the truth. The
committee is the University
Committee on Extra-Curriculum.
It will soon begin discussions on
the whole question of residence
staffing.
The committee is meeting in
direct response to a
recommendation passed down
from the Committee on
Short-Term Housing last Spring. It
is meeting in indirect response to
the number of questions which

have been raised regarding, not
only the Sponsor Program, but
also The Resident Assistant and
Faculty Resident programs.
