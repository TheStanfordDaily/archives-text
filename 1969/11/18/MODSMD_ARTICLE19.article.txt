# Freshman Mobilize To Build Bonfire
## 
### TAYLOE WASHBURN 
The freshmen class unites this
week in an effort to bring the
annual pre-Big Game activities to
a successful culmination in the
spectacular bonfire rally on
Friday night.
Criminal intrigue by Berkeley
students has already taken place
on campus. Several members of
the Stanford Band, which has
been guarding the campus against
Cal aggression for almost three
weeks, caught 50 Cal students
trying to remove the goal posts at
the Stadium about two weeks ago.
When the Stanford Police were
informed of the crime, they
subsequently arrested 19 men and
women.
Yet the Band's gallant efforts
were to no avail, as two days later
Cal students successfully carried
off the posts by coming in
mid-afternoon, an unexpected
tactic. The goal posts will now
suffer indignity of being placed
atop the miniscule Cal campfire.
Stanford Strikes Back
Not to be outclassed by such an
amteurish move, Stanford
students retaliated three days
later, by drowning with epoxy
glue every single lock in, out, and
around Cal stadium. This brilliant
ploy created instantaneous mass
confusion at Berkeley, as every
lock had to be cut off in hours, so
people could watch the
Cal-Oregon State game that
afternoon.
The Stanford Axe, already a
victim of two attampts of Cal
aggression, has been removed
from its bullet-proof,
sledge-hammer-proof, bomb-proof
case, to the relative security of the
Wells Fargo Bank vault.
The focal point of pre-Big
Game activities, the bonfire rally,
has been successfully defended
since 1943 by stalwart freshmen,
when it was successfuly lit by a
molotov cocktail. But in face of
the escalated Cal efforts to date, it
is apparent that security will have
to be strengthened considerably
this year.
The bonfire itself will be in the

shape of a giant *C\ and measure
about 70 feet high. It will contain
over 20,000 boxes, tons of wood
donated by Pepsi, Libby's and Del
Monte, and several hundred
gallons of diesel fuel as gravy. The
responsibility of constructing and
guarding the bonfire is with the
freshmen, who are being asked to
check with their dormitory
chairman to find out which
security shift they are on.
The bonfire will be guarded all
day and night starting this
afternoon, when the supporting
telephone poles will be placed.
Refreshments will be
continuously served by gracious
freshmen women.
There will be a party for all
freshmen Thursday night, from 8
to 11 at the boathouse bonfire
site on Lake Lagunita, at which
there will be 'refreshments' and
live entertainment.
Friday morning at 6:00 a.m.
freshman will be woken up to
serve on the seven truck crews,
which are going to collect the
bulk of the wood. Freshman can
sign up with their dorm chairman.
Beginning at 7:00 a.m. on
Friday, the massive efforts of
constructing the bonfire will
begin. The work schedule will be
divided into two hour workshifts,
which the dorm chairman are also
organizing. As there will be only
ten hours to build the entire
structure, all available assistance is
needed. All upperclassmen are
invited to help out in the joint
effort, and any freshmen who
don't sign up beforehand can
come anytime.
On Friday night at 7:00 p.m.,
the bonfire will commence, with
speeches by 49er Gene
Washington, Stanford graduate,
and prominent members of the
football team. The actual ignition
of the bonfire will take place
around 8:00 p.m.
