## Moratorium 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP>-Prime
Minister Eisaku Sato, arriving
Monday for negotiations with
President Nixon, declared the
return of Okinawa to Japanese
rule would lay a firm foundation
for a long-term relationship of
trust between the two countries.
Several hours after his arrival, a
small crowd of demonstrators
protested U.S. involvement in
Okinawa and Vietnam. About 150
sought to march on the Japanese
embassy on Massachusetts
Avenue. The march broke up after
the police arrested 15 young
demonstrators.
Nixon and Sato will hold three
days of talks beginning
Wednesday.
Sato and Nixon are reported
already to be more than 90 per
cent in agreement on the terms of
an announcement to be made
Friday dealing with the reversion
of Okinawa in 1972.
The remaining question is
largely the circumstances under
which the United States could
employ nuclear weapons in the
defense of Japan, Korea or
Taiwan, under terms of the
existing security treaty, from U.S.
bases on Okinawa.
It appears that the United
States is prepared to yield on the
storage of nuclear weapons on
Okinawa, but that Japan would
not forbid the use of Okinawa
base facilities in the event of an
emergency.

WASHINGTON (AP)- The
peace movement, proud of two
massive outpourings of antiwar
sentiment in two months, turned
its attention Monday to December
and a decentrailized Christmas
Eve protest.
Unlike the large-scale gatherings
of the young in October and
November, December's activities
will focus on community efforts
to seek to get adults to take a
more active role.
"Young people alone won't be
able to stop the war," said Sam
Brown, one of four coordinators
of the Vietnam Moratorium
Committee. "It will be necessary
to build a coalition in the
community."
The committee set the dates at
Dec. 12, 13 and 24 for the next
round of protests with the
emphasis to be on public vigils,
visits to veterans hospitals and
military bases, shopping center
rallies and town meetings. Specific
activities will be decided by local
Moratorium organizations.
"Traditionally Christmas has
been a time when people turn
their attention to "Peace on
Earth," Brown told a news
conference. "This year, in
addition to turning their attention
to 'Peace on Earth,' they will be
asked to turn their energies to this
task."
The 27-year-old Brown, who
helped organize youth behind
Eugene McCarthy's presidential
campaign last year, said the
Moratorium Committee would
deliver a Christmas present of
thousands of cards and letters to
President Nixon in a few weeks.
Meanwhile the other big
anti-war groups, the New
Mobilization Committee to End
the War in Vietnam, sponsors of

the Washington demonstrations,
took a temporary backseat to the
Moratorium Committee.
A New Mobe spokesman said
the coalition of 100 peace groups
will meet soon to decide its future
course. He ruled out any mass
demonstrations before spring.
Apollo 12
HOUSTON (AP)~A crucial
rocket firing came off perfectly—a
six minute blast at 10:47 p.m.
EST, fourteen minutes after the
spacecraft passed behind the
moon and out of radio contact
with earth.
The firing put the Yankee
Clipper and its fellow traveler
Intrepid in an orbit ranging 71 by
194 miles over the moon.
Conrad's voice broke the
silence as the spacecraft came out
from behind the moon. "Yankee
Clipper with Intrepid in tow has
arrived on time," he said.
"I guess that just like everyone
else who has just arrived, the three
of us are plastered to the windows
just looking," he added.
With the joy obvious in his
voice, he evaluated the moon in
the tradition of Navy men: "For
naval troops, it doesn't look like a
very good place to pull liberty,
though."

WASHINGTON (AP>-Prime
Minister Eisaku Sato, arriving
Monday for negotiations with
President Nixon, declared the
return of Okinawa to Japanese
rule would lay a firm foundation
for a long-term relationship of
trust between the two countries.
Several hours after his arrival, a
small crowd of demonstrators
protested U.S. involvement in
Okinawa and Vietnam. About 150
sought to march on the Japanese
embassy on Massachusetts
Avenue. The march broke up after
the police arrested 15 young
demonstrators.
Nixon and Sato will hold three
days of talks beginning
Wednesday.
Sato and Nixon are reported
already to be more than 90 per
cent in agreement on the terms of
an announcement to be made
Friday dealing with the reversion
of Okinawa in 1972.
The remaining question is
largely the circumstances under
which the United States could
employ nuclear weapons in the
defense of Japan, Korea or
Taiwan, under terms of the
existing security treaty, from U.S.
bases on Okinawa.
It appears that the United
States is prepared to yield on the
storage of nuclear weapons on
Okinawa, but that Japan would
not forbid the use of Okinawa
base facilities in the event of an
emergency.

WASHINGTON (AP)- The
peace movement, proud of two
massive outpourings of antiwar
sentiment in two months, turned
its attention Monday to December
and a decentrailized Christmas
Eve protest.
Unlike the large-scale gatherings
of the young in October and
November, December's activities
will focus on community efforts
to seek to get adults to take a
more active role.
"Young people alone won't be
able to stop the war," said Sam
Brown, one of four coordinators
of the Vietnam Moratorium
Committee. "It will be necessary
to build a coalition in the
community."
The committee set the dates at
Dec. 12, 13 and 24 for the next
round of protests with the
emphasis to be on public vigils,
visits to veterans hospitals and
military bases, shopping center
rallies and town meetings. Specific
activities will be decided by local
Moratorium organizations.
"Traditionally Christmas has
been a time when people turn
their attention to "Peace on
Earth," Brown told a news
conference. "This year, in
addition to turning their attention
to 'Peace on Earth,' they will be
asked to turn their energies to this
task."
The 27-year-old Brown, who
helped organize youth behind
Eugene McCarthy's presidential
campaign last year, said the
Moratorium Committee would
deliver a Christmas present of
thousands of cards and letters to
President Nixon in a few weeks.
Meanwhile the other big
anti-war groups, the New
Mobilization Committee to End
the War in Vietnam, sponsors of

the Washington demonstrations,
took a temporary backseat to the
Moratorium Committee.
A New Mobe spokesman said
the coalition of 100 peace groups
will meet soon to decide its future
course. He ruled out any mass
demonstrations before spring.

HOUSTON (AP)~A crucial
rocket firing came off perfectly—a
six minute blast at 10:47 p.m.

spacecraft passed behind the
moon and out of radio contact

The firing put the Yankee
Clipper and its fellow traveler
Intrepid in an orbit ranging 71 by
194 miles over the moon.
Conrad's voice broke the
silence as the spacecraft came out
from behind the moon. "Yankee
Clipper with Intrepid in tow has
arrived on time," he said.
"I guess that just like everyone
else who has just arrived, the three
of us are plastered to the windows
just looking," he added.
With the joy obvious in his
voice, he evaluated the moon in
the tradition of Navy men: "For
naval troops, it doesn't look like a
very good place to pull liberty,
though."
