# Gaieties To Frolic
## 
### 
Stanford's "Gaieties," a 56-
year-old traditional student
musical before the Big Game with
Cal, this year transcends the
football spirit. Director Alan
Mokler has written a smaller,
more intimate show, in which the
songs are an integral part of the
story.
Mokler uses last spring's
student protest movement as the
springboard for a fictitious
demonstration this fall. Freshman
Jack Trent (Jeff Schmidt) finds
himself an unwitting
revolutionary when he falls in love
with a radical named Julie (Betsy
Leichliter). His friend Charlie tries
to help but only creates more

confusion by falling for Julie
himself. Charlie is having his own
problems, finding a place to stand
in the campus turmoil.
A wide variety of music for
"The Carnival Down Below" was
composed by the author with
Gary Levinson, who won the
Broadcast Music Inc. award for
"Wumberlogue" in 1967. Special
effects are created by recordings
and slide projections of campus
life.
Performances run at 8:30 p.m.
Nov. 19, 20, and 22 and at 9 p.m.
Nov. 21. General admission is $3,
$2 for students. Tickets are
available at Tresidder Box Office
at Stanford.
