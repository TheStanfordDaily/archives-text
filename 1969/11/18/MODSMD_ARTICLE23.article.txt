Saturday is the Big Game. It is the day football crazy alumni and
red-hot students have been waiting for all fall. It marks the final
college game in the fine careers of Bubba Brown, Howie Williams, Don
Parish, Pat Preston, Bob Reinhart, and many others.
It is the time they bring out the-axe, Beat Kal, and keep one ear to
the radio listening to the really big game in Los Angeles. To both
coaches, a win over the Big Game rival means a successful season.
Yet few people realize the fate of Big Game is annually sealed hours
before the kickoff ever comes. For the only time all year, what Jim
Plunkett does on the field has absolutely no effect on the outcome of
the game.
It has been said that the athlete is at the mercy of the press, just
like any public figure. But few realize the football team's total
helplessness during the last week of the season.
It is the staff of the incredulous Stanford Daily that holds the
power in the Big Game. The actions of the sleep-walking journalists
from Panama Street will determine whether or not John Ralston's
team will end the year on an up note.
The explanation revolves around the morning of the Big Game, a
time when most are recovering from post-Bon fire parties or trips to
the city.
Every year, at 9:30 a.m. the Daily latent jocks—so-called athletes
who have seen their sports careers sputter and die in high school—take
to the gridiron once more to determine the varsity's chances for the
afternoon. *
The event is known as The Ink Bowl. And every season, the
super-straight reactionary writers from the Stanford Daily do battle
with the dirty, freaked-out, hippy, peace-queers from the Daily
California ii.
The eight-man touch football contest is more than just another
bowl game. In fact, it is the secret, vital factor that determines the
actual Big Game winner.
For the past eight years, the school that wins The Ink Bowl looses
Big Game.
It never fails. The real Big Game has always defied the odds, and
the experts have wondered why. Last year, when Cal was favored,
Stanford won easily, 20-0. And the year before, when the Indians
were picked to win, the Bears stomped, 26-3.
The secret is The Ink Bowl. For Coach Ralston's sake, the Daily got
themselves clobbered last year. Dedicated staffers, realizing the
importance of a Big Game win for the student body morale (and
Ralston's job) swallowed their pride —and almost their tongues and
lost to the Daily Cal up at Berkeley.
This season, however, things might be a little rougher on the
Stanford football team. The easy win for last year's Daily Californian
squad may not be repeated. But no one can blame the Stanford Daily
if they win—BOTH teams are trying to throw the game this year.
Daily Cal sports editor Gordon Sakuae is prepared to lose at all
costs. "We are bigger and stronger this year, but hopefully we can
overcome these problems," he said.
The Stanford Daily must go into the ball game a two touchdown
underdog, based on heir terrible showing last year. Most of the same
able stars are back their time, and the Daily is banking on the further
deterioration of these already foul bodies to carry them down to
defeat again—their seventh in the last eight ytars.
