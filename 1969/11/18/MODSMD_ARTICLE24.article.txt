# The 						Bowl Bids
## 
### 
Post-season football bowl bids
went out yesterday, and although
Stanford isn't going anyplace,
Notre Dame is.
For the first time since 1925
when the Fighting Irish beat
Stanford in the Rose Bowl, 27-10,
Notre Dame is playing in a bowl.
The Irish (7-1-1) have accepted a
bid to the Cotton Bowl in Dallas
on New Year's Day for economic
reasons.
Father Edmund Joyce,
executive vice president of Notre
Dame said the change in policy
was due to an urgent need for
funds to finance minority student
programs and scholarships. The
Irish will get more than $300,000
from the game.

Their opponent will be the
champion of the Southwest
Conference, either Texas (8-0) or
Arkansas (8-0). The winner of the
league will be determined when
the two powers meet on
December 6.
The loser of the Southwest
battle will play in the Sugar Bowl
in New Orleans on January 1
against Mississippi (6-3).
The Orange Bowl, New Year's
Night in Miami, pits Penn State
(9-0) against Missouri (8-1).
Powerful Tennessee (7-1) and
Florida (7-1-1) meet in the Gator
Bowl on December 27.
The Rose Bowl will of course
match either USC (8-0-1) or
UCLA (8-0-1) with either
Michigan (7-2) or Purdue (7-2).
