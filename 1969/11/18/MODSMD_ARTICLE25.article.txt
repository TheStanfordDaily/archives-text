## Dislocs In Semis 
### SCOTT BURNS 
The Dislocations rallied in the
final minute of their quarterfinal
match yesterday with the
upset-minded Chi Psi's to tie the
score 18-18, and then went on to
win the game on yardage to move
into the intramural football
semifinals.
The Chi Psi's passing
combination of Gary Garland to
blocking back Andy Vandershoot
gave the Dislocations headaches
all day, but they counterattacked
with the pinpoint passing of Mike
Evans.
Even though the Chi Psi's
strong rush caused many problems
for quarterback Evans, the
Dislocations always came up with
the big play when they needed it.
The first half was an even battle
and ended in a 12-12 tie, but the
Chi Psi's scored immediately after
the half to put them ahead, 18-12.
Play bounched back and forth
until the Dislocations got the ball
deep in their own territory with
1:17 left in the game.

After just three plays they tied
the score up with a touchdown
pass. Extra points could have won
the game for either team, but all
six were misÂ§ed. fhe. Dislocations
won the post game yardage
contest on a third down pass to
Bob Madix.
The other quarterfinal games
were fairly lopsided. On Sunday,
the Zetes overpowered the Med
School, 39-13, as Steve Kistler
had a great day passing. The Phi
Delts stopped the SAE's cold on
defense and went on to score a
26-0 win.
The Second Year Law team
also shut out their opponent,
Burbank, 33-0, to move into the
semifinals.
The Phi Delts play the
Dislocations today at 3:45 p.m.,
and the Zetes take on Second
Year Law tomorrow in semifinal
action.
The Stanford IM champion will
play Xi Upsilon, Cal's IM
champion, on Saturday morning
at 10:30 a.m. on the soccer field.
