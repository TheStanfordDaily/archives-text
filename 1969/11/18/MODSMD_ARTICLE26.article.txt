Snipers hold our police at bay.
Sit-ins make authority a farce.
Violence shakes cities as the cry
"Protest!" becomes a shout. The
attitude grows: If you think the
law is wrong—break it!
What's your stand? Our coun
try was founded on rebellion—
on the right to protest. But can
open defiance be defended? Is
this a "right". . . or a national
outrage?
Many dissenters justify their
stands on the issue of personal
creed. "The Vietnam war is im
moral!" is their cry. This dual
loyalty to state and convictions
has been a dilemma for Centuries.
But how often are men governed
by emotion or human opinion —
instead of spiritual facts?
What are these facts? Our
booklet "The Christian and His
Country" discusses the current
ferment from a Christian point
of view. It offers yardsticks for
measuring unquestioned loyalty
—and valid dissent. It reminds
citizens in this Thanksgiving
season that to keep our freedoms,
our very right to protest —they
MUST act to create laws within
which thev can live. Send for it!
