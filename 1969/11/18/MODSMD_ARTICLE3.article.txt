# Environment Congress Asks Tax Surplus To Fight Pollution
## 
### 
For most, the blue-gray cloud
choking the Bay Area last
weekend reduced visibility. For
200 delegates to the Student
Environmental Congress, the smog
only helped bring the problem
into clearer focus.
Delegates at Stanford endorsed
a constitution for a statewide
Student Environmental
Confederation to coordinate
activities and spread information
on the ecological problem. They
also heard plans for a nation-wide
teach-in on environmental
problems scheduled for April.
The congress unanimously
endorsed a resolution asking Gov.
Ronald Reagan to divert an
expected $300 to $500 million
tax surplus to the study of
environmental problems.
Representatives have taken the
statement to Reagan's conference
on environmental problems now
being held in Los Angeles.
Breaking into twelve
committees on Saturday
afternoon, the congress tackled
ecological problems on many
fronts.
The committee on legislative
proposals suggested a tax
structure designed to translate
into economic burdens the
depletion and pollution of natural
resources. Automobiles might be
taxed according to how much

they pollute the air. Containers
which are not re-usable might be
taxed more than those which do
not become a disposal problem.
Population Control
Several committees stressed a
need for more effective control of
population growth. A committee
discussing international
repercussions recommended
development of u.i international
agency to encourage population
control.
This agency would also
"police" many national policies,
prohibiting those which would
create great international
ecological problems.
The committee suggested that
the U.S. divert funds from the
defense department to finance the
solution of ecological problems.
"What we really wanted to say
was 'to hell with the defense
department," the chairman
related, emphasizing the need for
tact in formal statements.
Interdependence
A committee on urban
environment and regional
planning maintained that
independence and property rights
were myths. Interdependence was
a more appropriate outlook on
the ecological system, the
committee stated.

to take a "wholistic" approach to
the "ecological crisis." Only
studying parts of the problem in
isolation is not enough, he said.

was 'to hell with the defense
department," the chairman
related, emphasizing the need for
tact in formal statements.
Interdependence
A committee on urban
environment and regional
planning maintained that
independence and property rights
were myths. Interdependence was
a more appropriate outlook on
the ecological system, the
committee stated.
Washington University
environmentalist Barry

Commoner opened the Congress
on Saturday encouraging students
to take a "wholistic" approach to
the "ecological crisis." Only
studying parts of the problem in
isolation is not enough, he said.
State Resources Agency
director Norman B. Livermore
and John Heritage, administrative
assistant to Sen. Gaylord Nelson,
also joined the conference.
For most, the blue-gray cloud
choking the Bay Area last
weekend reduced visibility. For
200 delegates to the Student
Environmental Congress, the smog
only helped bring the problem
into clearer focus.
Delegates at Stanford endorsed
a constitution for a statewide
Student Environmental
Confederation to coordinate
activities and spread information
on the ecological problem. They
also heard plans for a nation-wide
teach-in on environmental
problems scheduled for April.
The congress unanimously
endorsed a resolution asking Gov.
Ronald Reagan to divert an
expected $300 to $500 million
tax surplus to the study of
environmental problems.
Representatives have taken the
statement to Reagan's conference
on environmental problems now
being held in Los Angeles.
Breaking into twelve
committees on Saturday
afternoon, the congress tackled
ecological problems on many
fronts.
The committee on legislative
proposals suggested a tax
structure designed to translate
into economic burdens the
depletion and pollution of natural
resources. Automobiles might be
taxed according to how much

they pollute the air. Containers
which are not re-usable might be
taxed more than those which do
not become a disposal problem.
Population Control
Several committees stressed a
need for more effective control of
population growth. A committee
discussing international
repercussions recommended
development of u.i international
agency to encourage population
control.
This agency would also
"police" many national policies,
prohibiting those which would
create great international
ecological problems.
The committee suggested that
the U.S. divert funds from the
defense department to finance the
solution of ecological problems.
"What we really wanted to say
was 'to hell with the defense
department," the chairman
related, emphasizing the need for
tact in formal statements.
