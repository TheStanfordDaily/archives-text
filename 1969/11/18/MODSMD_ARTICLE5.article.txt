# Senate Debates Salary Lists
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
A motion to print the stolen
salary date was voted down by a
narrow 16 to 14 margin at last
night's student Senate meeting.
But despite the defeat, the salary
data will remain in the official
Senate meeting minutes, raising
serious questions of libel.
An original resolution
ntroduced by John Shoch and
'aul Witt, calling for "freedom of
expression," asked that the Senate
encourage "any group or
individual with access to
University salary information . .
to make the information available
to members of the university
community."
Senate member Yale Braunstein
then moved to amend the
resolution to include the entire
salary lists as explanation of the
motion.
Sharp Debate
Sharp debate followed
Braunstein's proposal over
whether or not publication of the
salary data was libelous. ASSU
Council of Presidents member Pat
Shea asked the Senate "to stop
making all these symbolic gestures
that alienate the student body and
decide on more substantive issues
like the budget." After a long and
angry discussion period, both the
Braunstein and the Shoch-Witt
amendments were defeated.
Member Jim Schneider asked
that the defeated motion be
removed entirely from the
Senate's minutes so that no
possible case for libel could
exist. This measure passed 18-12,
but failed to carry since a
two-thirds majority was necessary.
Senate chairman Dave Edwards
declared a further measure to
confine the Senate's minutes

solely to Senate members out of
order. "The Senate should make
its activities known to the people
it represents," said Edwards.
In addition, Braunstein added
that this measure necessitated a
special announced vote and also
needed a two-thirds majority.
However, Edwards decided to
check the legal considerations of
printing the salary data in the
Senate's minutes.
The University administration
has declared repeatedly it will
provide legal advice to any faculty
member who feels his right to
salary privacy is invaded.
The meeting, at first the fullest
and then later stormiest to date,
featured a walkout by
conservative members and five
unsucc ssful calls for
adjournment.
45 Minute Debate
The meeting began with a 45
minute debate on whether the
constitution the Senate operates
under was one given to Senators
by ASSU Council of Presidents
member John Grube or a copy
printed in the Daily last spring.
The chief difference between the
two amounted to when the Senate
chairman is elected. The Grube
constitution stated a Senate
chairman should be elected by the
outgoing Senate for the next
session; the Daily copy said each
legislature should decide itself.
The Grube constitution was
accepted.
During the long debate over the
constitutions, more than five of
the 30 sertators left. But after the
motion to include the salary data
in the minutes was voiced,
chairman Edwards repeatedly
called for order during a meeting
that reached shouting-match levels
frequently.
