# Hoover: From Library To Institution
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON First of a Series 
Stanford University is the home of one of the world s
finest libraries on communism and the Soviet Union: the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace.
University libraries are somehow inherently
non-controversial. Not so with the Hoover Institution. It
was the subject of intense attack (mostly verbal) last
Spring by the April 3rd Movement, which was protesting
war-related research on the Stanford campus. Hoover has
also been attacked by many liberal-radical publications.
How could a library attract such criticism? The answer
is that Hoover is more than a library. In fact, only about
half of Hoover's nearly two million dollar budget is
channeled into the library. Nearly one-third of the budget,
or some $600,000, is directed toward supporting research
of resident and visiting scholars at Hoover. It is this
research that has drawn strong criticism.
Critics allege that Hoover mainly funds right-wing
researchers who approach their work with the purpose of
attacking communism. These critics cite a statement by
the late Herbert Hoover, founder of the Institution, as
partial support for their contention. In 1959 Hoover said
of the Institution: "The purpose of this Institution must
be, by its reasearch and publications, to demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx ..."
Conservative Orientation
The conservative political orientation of many of
Hoover's senior staff is also cited as evidence ol an
unscholarly bias. Understandably Hoover officials deny
any bias in their research.
They point to the presence of the Hoover staff ot
Theodore Draper, author of the well-received Abuse of
Power which is highly critical of American policy in
Vietnam and the Carribean. Hoover staff members also
point out the favorable reviews given ninny of the
Institution-sponsored publications.
Nixon's Training Ground
More recent ly Hoover has come under attack as being a
training ground for President Nixon's White House and
Defense Department staff. Two Hoover staffers are serving
as deputy assistant secretaries of defense, one for Easi
Asian and Pacific Affairs and the other for Policy Planning

• —»«
and Arms Control. Another is a White House economic
adviser and a fourth, Richard V. Allen, until last month
served as chief aide to Henry Kissinger, Nixon's foreign
policy adviser. All four have taken leaves of absence from
the Institution.
Critics also complain that Hoover staffers are not
subject to the same screening procedures as regular faculty
appointments. Hoover is not an academic department. It
is an autonomous institution reporting to the University
President. There are signs that the relationship between
Hoover and the rest of the University is hanging, however.
(They will be examined in a later article.)
As reported elsewhere on this page, the Hoover
Institution is marking its fiftieth anniversary this week
with a conference entitled "Peaceful Change in a Modern
Society." The conference provides us with an occasion to
examine the Institution: its past, present and future.
A Brief History
The remainder of this article will provide a brief history
of the Institution. Future articles will deal with recent
controversies and probably future directions for the
Institution.
Hoover has not always been a controversial place. Some
Hoover officials are glad the Institution is now attracting
attention as something more than the object of jokes
about the symbolism of Hoover Tower. They see the
controversy as a sign of life, a natural result of entering
into the academic marketplace.
The Institution was founded in 1919 as the repository
for documents from the Peace Conference in Versailles. It
has since branched into all aspects of twentieth century
international politics. In its early years Hoover was in
many ways an arm of the Stanford history department.
The early directors all had faculty appointments in
history.
The main concern of people connected with the
Institution was to preserve documents on the enormous
political, economic and cultural upheaval taking place in
the early years of the twentieth century. This has
remained a cardinal purpose of the Institution, resulting in
(he acquisition of many private libraries that might not
otherwise have remained intact.
Formerly the War Library
Few publications were supported in the early years,
which perhaps accounts for the earlier name of the
Institution, the Hoover War Library. Financial support for
the Institution was not always adequate, however, and
donations showed a downward trend in the late 19505.
Donations supported almost all the Institution's work.
As a consequence of the decline in support of the
Institution pressure rose for something to be done. In
1959 the directorship of the Institution fell vacant.
At this point Mr. Hoover stepped back into the active
picture and personally selected the present director. W.

Glenn Campbell. Concurrent with the appointment of Dr.
Campbell, the Board of Trustees adopted a new set of
guidelines concerning the Institution.
Trustee Guidelines
The Trustees' guidelines for the Institution also
specified that appointments to the Hoover staff were not
to be subject to the approval of any faculty committee.
The guidelines stated that the Director was to be
appointed with the approval of Mr. Hoover. The
University President had a role in appointing both the
staff and Director.
When the wording of the Trustees' guidelines leaked
out, an immense furor resulted and then University
President J. Wallace Sterling assured the faculty that he
would keep a close eye on the research at the Institution
as well as the staff.
Dr. Campbell immediately set to work rebuilding and
expanding the Institution. He actively solicited gifts from
major corporations and foundations, increasing donations
several times over.
More recently, the Lou Henry Hoover Building, next to
he Tower, has been built, greatly increasing the space
available for both documents and researchers. The
facilities are open to all members of the Stanford
community though in the past some students have
reported some difficulty in using the resources.
The major innovation of Dr. Campbell, besides the
greatly increased financial support, has been the
appointment of a considerable number of researchers, far
more than in the earlier "Library" years. The impact of
this augmented reserach staff will be discussed tomorrow.

for documents from the Peace Conference in Versailles. It
has since branched into all aspects of twentieth century
international politics. In its early years Hoover was in
many ways an arm of the Stanford history department.
The early directors all had faculty appointments in
history.
The main concern of people connected with the
Institution was to preserve documents on the enormous
political, economic and cultural upheaval taking place in
the early years of the twentieth century. This has
remained a cardinal purpose of the Institution, resulting in
(he acquisition of many private libraries that might not
otherwise have remained intact.
Formerly the War Library
Few publications were supported in the early years,
which perhaps accounts for the earlier name of the
Institution, the Hoover War Library. Financial support for
the Institution was not always adequate, however, and
donations showed a downward trend in the late 19505.
Donations supported almost all the Institution's work.
As a consequence of the decline in support of the
Institution pressure rose for something to be done. In
1959 the directorship of the Institution fell vacant.
At this point Mr. Hoover stepped back into the active
picture and personally selected the present director. W.

Glenn Campbell. Concurrent with the appointment of Dr.
Campbell, the Board of Trustees adopted a new set of
guidelines concerning the Institution.
Trustee Guidelines
The Trustees' guidelines for the Institution also
specified that appointments to the Hoover staff were not
to be subject to the approval of any faculty committee.
The guidelines stated that the Director was to be
appointed with the approval of Mr. Hoover. The
University President had a role in appointing both the
staff and Director.
When the wording of the Trustees' guidelines leaked
out, an immense furor resulted and then University
President J. Wallace Sterling assured the faculty that he
would keep a close eye on the research at the Institution
as well as the staff.
Dr. Campbell immediately set to work rebuilding and
expanding the Institution. He actively solicited gifts from
major corporations and foundations, increasing donations
several times over.
More recently, the Lou Henry Hoover Building, next to
he Tower, has been built, greatly increasing the space
available for both documents and researchers. The
facilities are open to all members of the Stanford
community though in the past some students have
reported some difficulty in using the resources.
The major innovation of Dr. Campbell, besides the
greatly increased financial support, has been the
appointment of a considerable number of researchers, far
more than in the earlier "Library" years. The impact of
this augmented reserach staff will be discussed tomorrow.

Stanford University is the home of one of the world s
finest libraries on communism and the Soviet Union: the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace.
University libraries are somehow inherently
non-controversial. Not so with the Hoover Institution. It
was the subject of intense attack (mostly verbal) last
Spring by the April 3rd Movement, which was protesting
war-related research on the Stanford campus. Hoover has
also been attacked by many liberal-radical publications.
How could a library attract such criticism? The answer
is that Hoover is more than a library. In fact, only about
half of Hoover's nearly two million dollar budget is
channeled into the library. Nearly one-third of the budget,
or some $600,000, is directed toward supporting research
of resident and visiting scholars at Hoover. It is this
research that has drawn strong criticism.
Critics allege that Hoover mainly funds right-wing
researchers who approach their work with the purpose of
attacking communism. These critics cite a statement by
the late Herbert Hoover, founder of the Institution, as
partial support for their contention. In 1959 Hoover said
of the Institution: "The purpose of this Institution must
be, by its reasearch and publications, to demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx ..."
Conservative Orientation
The conservative political orientation of many of
Hoover's senior staff is also cited as evidence ol an
unscholarly bias. Understandably Hoover officials deny
any bias in their research.
They point to the presence of the Hoover staff ot
Theodore Draper, author of the well-received Abuse of
Power which is highly critical of American policy in
Vietnam and the Carribean. Hoover staff members also
point out the favorable reviews given ninny of the
Institution-sponsored publications.

Critics also complain that Hoover staffers are not
subject to the same screening procedures as regular faculty
appointments. Hoover is not an academic department. It
is an autonomous institution reporting to the University
President. There are signs that the relationship between
Hoover and the rest of the University is hanging, however.

of the Institution. Future articles will deal with recent
controversies and probably future directions for the

Hoover has not always been a controversial place. Some

or some $600,000, is directed toward supporting research
of resident and visiting scholars at Hoover. It is this
research that has drawn strong criticism.
Critics allege that Hoover mainly funds right-wing
researchers who approach their work with the purpose of
attacking communism. These critics cite a statement by
the late Herbert Hoover, founder of the Institution, as
partial support for their contention. In 1959 Hoover said
of the Institution: "The purpose of this Institution must
be, by its reasearch and publications, to demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx ..."
Conservative Orientation
The conservative political orientation of many of
Hoover's senior staff is also cited as evidence ol an
unscholarly bias. Understandably Hoover officials deny
any bias in their research.
They point to the presence of the Hoover staff ot
Theodore Draper, author of the well-received Abuse of
Power which is highly critical of American policy in
Vietnam and the Carribean. Hoover staff members also
point out the favorable reviews given ninny of the
Institution-sponsored publications.
Nixon's Training Ground

and Arms Control. Another is a White House economic
adviser and a fourth, Richard V. Allen, until last month
served as chief aide to Henry Kissinger, Nixon's foreign
policy adviser. All four have taken leaves of absence from
the Institution.
Critics also complain that Hoover staffers are not
subject to the same screening procedures as regular faculty
appointments. Hoover is not an academic department. It
is an autonomous institution reporting to the University
President. There are signs that the relationship between
Hoover and the rest of the University is hanging, however.
(They will be examined in a later article.)
As reported elsewhere on this page, the Hoover
Institution is marking its fiftieth anniversary this week
with a conference entitled "Peaceful Change in a Modern
Society." The conference provides us with an occasion to
examine the Institution: its past, present and future.
A Brief History
The remainder of this article will provide a brief history
of the Institution. Future articles will deal with recent
controversies and probably future directions for the
Institution.
Hoover has not always been a controversial place. Some
Hoover officials are glad the Institution is now attracting
attention as something more than the object of jokes
about the symbolism of Hoover Tower. They see the
controversy as a sign of life, a natural result of entering
into the academic marketplace.
The Institution was founded in 1919 as the repository
for documents from the Peace Conference in Versailles. It
has since branched into all aspects of twentieth century
international politics. In its early years Hoover was in
many ways an arm of the Stanford history department.
The early directors all had faculty appointments in
history.
The main concern of people connected with the
Institution was to preserve documents on the enormous
political, economic and cultural upheaval taking place in
the early years of the twentieth century. This has
remained a cardinal purpose of the Institution, resulting in
(he acquisition of many private libraries that might not
otherwise have remained intact.
Formerly the War Library
Few publications were supported in the early years,
which perhaps accounts for the earlier name of the
Institution, the Hoover War Library. Financial support for
the Institution was not always adequate, however, and
donations showed a downward trend in the late 19505.
Donations supported almost all the Institution's work.
As a consequence of the decline in support of the
Institution pressure rose for something to be done. In
1959 the directorship of the Institution fell vacant.
At this point Mr. Hoover stepped back into the active
picture and personally selected the present director. W.

Glenn Campbell. Concurrent with the appointment of Dr.
Campbell, the Board of Trustees adopted a new set of
guidelines concerning the Institution.
Trustee Guidelines
The Trustees' guidelines for the Institution also
specified that appointments to the Hoover staff were not
to be subject to the approval of any faculty committee.
The guidelines stated that the Director was to be
appointed with the approval of Mr. Hoover. The
University President had a role in appointing both the
staff and Director.
When the wording of the Trustees' guidelines leaked
out, an immense furor resulted and then University
President J. Wallace Sterling assured the faculty that he
would keep a close eye on the research at the Institution
as well as the staff.
Dr. Campbell immediately set to work rebuilding and
expanding the Institution. He actively solicited gifts from
major corporations and foundations, increasing donations
several times over.
More recently, the Lou Henry Hoover Building, next to
he Tower, has been built, greatly increasing the space
available for both documents and researchers. The
facilities are open to all members of the Stanford
community though in the past some students have
reported some difficulty in using the resources.
The major innovation of Dr. Campbell, besides the
greatly increased financial support, has been the
appointment of a considerable number of researchers, far
more than in the earlier "Library" years. The impact of
this augmented reserach staff will be discussed tomorrow.

Stanford University is the home of one of the world s
finest libraries on communism and the Soviet Union: the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace.
University libraries are somehow inherently
non-controversial. Not so with the Hoover Institution. It
was the subject of intense attack (mostly verbal) last
Spring by the April 3rd Movement, which was protesting
war-related research on the Stanford campus. Hoover has
also been attacked by many liberal-radical publications.
