# Latin America
## US Death Notice 
### Victor Palomino 
After reading Governor
Rockefeller's recommendations
concerning Latin America, I
cannot say that the leadership of
this nation is trying to understand
or help us, but that is not the
point; things are worse than no
help. The Governor is practically
recommending the killing of any
movement in Latin America that
might be interested in redirecting
the course of our destiny. He
suggests more tanks, more
warships, more weapons, and a
better-trained police force.
Why, I wonder, do we need
those things, more of those
things? Who are we afraid of?
What Mr. Rockefeller is offering is
something like this: a pregnant
Indian mother is under great pains
and suffering before giving birth
to her first child, and then comes
an American doctor who upon
noticing the poor woman feels
sorry and gives her a shot, two
shots; to kill the pain, more shots.
But he forgets something.
Whether intentionally or
unintentionally is something for
you, the young generation, to
learn if you really want to redirect
the priorities of your nation. For
us, the question as to why he
forgets is irrelevant. The doctor
forgets the baby is still inside his
mother's womb. More pains, more
shots.
But the baby cannot die. He
must live. The doctor must go.
The baby will live. There is hope
in any nation, there is strength in
every mother.
Perhaps in other countries the
situation is the same and therefore
the remedy must be the same.
More arms, more weapons. And
when we realize that another
month has gone by and a war that
uses the best of arms and weapons
and of technology continues, we
remember what could someday
happen to us. So many cries, baby
cries, mother cries, father tears.
Yet who hears? Who cares? It is
far away and when tears fall, they
do so silently. When kids cry, who
listens? Bombs explode so
violently, so noisily. When many
die that way, who cares about
someone crying? Look homeward,
angel?
Revolution Brings Progress
More arms to Latin America
will simply convert what could
possibly be a fairly peaceful
revolution into a bloody and
long-lasting adventure. Personally,
I interpret a political revolution as
something that has to take place
before any kind of progress can be
made. It is certainly not just any
military plot of which we are so
accustomed to hear. It involves a
transfer of power in which the
oligarchies of Latin America must
give way to a more nationalistic
middle class with passion in their
hearts and knowledge in their
brains to lead the beginning of a
new way of life.
Some weeks ago a fellow
student wrote: "Heck, what Latin
America needs is a revolution
towards peace and stability." But
peace and stability are not
something you can put on top of
hungry people, of sick people.
Peace and stability! Nice words to
say when not related to the brutal
realities of poor nations. Led by
Duvalier, the Somoza family,
cheap generals? Why stability

anyway? Is anything stable in this
world? Everything seems to
rotate, and change must always be
a part of life. Have we grown tired
of looking for new frontiers? If
technology is always going further
and further into the more
complex and more difficult world
of mathematics, why can the
hearts of men not change too?
Why should our feelings towards
the things that surround us not
change? Why look at things,
revolution included, from the
same old frame of reference?
Why does the revolution of
Peru or of Chile have to be like
the ones in Russia, China or
Cuba? Why? Only in the minds of
some foreign policy makers there
seems to be only one way to a
revolution, Communism, and
Communism is a word that for so
many years has justified the
perpetuation of dictatorships
throughout Latin America.
W hat's Wrong With Commies
After all, what is so wrong with
Communism or any other system
that we may decide to choose or
change to? We, Latin Americans,
will be living under that system.
We shall create it, we shall build
it, and we shall defend it.
Yet I believe in foreign aid, for
the best kind of aid you could
give us is for every American to
come down to our lands, to really
meet us; to see our deep valleys,
our snow-peaked mountains, our
pampas, our savage jungles; to
witness the suffering of those we
desire to help. Then you will
understand why revolution is not
such a bad, scary word. In very
land, there is always something to
be learned and something to be
loved.

the ones in Russia, China or
Cuba? Why? Only in the minds of
some foreign policy makers there
seems to be only one way to a
revolution, Communism, and
Communism is a word that for so
many years has justified the
perpetuation of dictatorships
throughout Latin America.
W hat's Wrong With Commies
After all, what is so wrong with
Communism or any other system
that we may decide to choose or
change to? We, Latin Americans,
will be living under that system.
We shall create it, we shall build
it, and we shall defend it.
Yet I believe in foreign aid, for
the best kind of aid you could
give us is for every American to
come down to our lands, to really
meet us; to see our deep valleys,
our snow-peaked mountains, our
pampas, our savage jungles; to
witness the suffering of those we
desire to help. Then you will
understand why revolution is not
such a bad, scary word. In very
land, there is always something to
be learned and something to be
loved.

After reading Governor
Rockefeller's recommendations
concerning Latin America, I
cannot say that the leadership of
this nation is trying to understand
or help us, but that is not the
point; things are worse than no
help. The Governor is practically
recommending the killing of any
movement in Latin America that
might be interested in redirecting
the course of our destiny. He
suggests more tanks, more
warships, more weapons, and a
better-trained police force.
Why, I wonder, do we need
those things, more of those
things? Who are we afraid of?
What Mr. Rockefeller is offering is
something like this: a pregnant
Indian mother is under great pains
and suffering before giving birth
to her first child, and then comes
an American doctor who upon
noticing the poor woman feels
sorry and gives her a shot, two
shots; to kill the pain, more shots.
But he forgets something.
Whether intentionally or
unintentionally is something for
you, the young generation, to
learn if you really want to redirect
the priorities of your nation. For
us, the question as to why he
forgets is irrelevant. The doctor
forgets the baby is still inside his
mother's womb. More pains, more
shots.
But the baby cannot die. He
must live. The doctor must go.
The baby will live. There is hope
in any nation, there is strength in
every mother.
Perhaps in other countries the
situation is the same and therefore
the remedy must be the same.
More arms, more weapons. And
when we realize that another
month has gone by and a war that
uses the best of arms and weapons
and of technology continues, we
remember what could someday
happen to us. So many cries, baby
cries, mother cries, father tears.
Yet who hears? Who cares? It is
far away and when tears fall, they
do so silently. When kids cry, who
listens? Bombs explode so
violently, so noisily. When many
die that way, who cares about
someone crying? Look homeward,
angel?
Revolution Brings Progress
More arms to Latin America
will simply convert what could
possibly be a fairly peaceful
revolution into a bloody and
long-lasting adventure. Personally,
I interpret a political revolution as
something that has to take place
before any kind of progress can be
made. It is certainly not just any
military plot of which we are so
accustomed to hear. It involves a
transfer of power in which the
oligarchies of Latin America must
give way to a more nationalistic
middle class with passion in their
hearts and knowledge in their
brains to lead the beginning of a
new way of life.
Some weeks ago a fellow
student wrote: "Heck, what Latin
America needs is a revolution
towards peace and stability." But
peace and stability are not
something you can put on top of
hungry people, of sick people.
Peace and stability! Nice words to
say when not related to the brutal
realities of poor nations. Led by
Duvalier, the Somoza family,
cheap generals? Why stability

anyway? Is anything stable in this
world? Everything seems to
rotate, and change must always be
a part of life. Have we grown tired
of looking for new frontiers? If
technology is always going further
and further into the more
complex and more difficult world
of mathematics, why can the
hearts of men not change too?
Why should our feelings towards
the things that surround us not
change? Why look at things,
revolution included, from the
same old frame of reference?

oligarchies of Latin America must
give way to a more nationalistic
middle class with passion in their
hearts and knowledge in their
brains to lead the beginning of a
new way of life.
Some weeks ago a fellow
student wrote: "Heck, what Latin
America needs is a revolution
towards peace and stability." But
peace and stability are not
something you can put on top of
hungry people, of sick people.
Peace and stability! Nice words to
say when not related to the brutal
realities of poor nations. Led by
Duvalier, the Somoza family,
cheap generals? Why stability

anyway? Is anything stable in this
world? Everything seems to
rotate, and change must always be
a part of life. Have we grown tired
of looking for new frontiers? If
technology is always going further
and further into the more
complex and more difficult world
of mathematics, why can the
hearts of men not change too?
Why should our feelings towards
the things that surround us not
change? Why look at things,
revolution included, from the
same old frame of reference?
Why does the revolution of
Peru or of Chile have to be like
the ones in Russia, China or
Cuba? Why? Only in the minds of
some foreign policy makers there
seems to be only one way to a
revolution, Communism, and
Communism is a word that for so
many years has justified the
perpetuation of dictatorships
throughout Latin America.
W hat's Wrong With Commies
After all, what is so wrong with
Communism or any other system
that we may decide to choose or
change to? We, Latin Americans,
will be living under that system.
We shall create it, we shall build
it, and we shall defend it.
Yet I believe in foreign aid, for
the best kind of aid you could
give us is for every American to
come down to our lands, to really
meet us; to see our deep valleys,
our snow-peaked mountains, our
pampas, our savage jungles; to
witness the suffering of those we
desire to help. Then you will
understand why revolution is not
such a bad, scary word. In very
land, there is always something to
be learned and something to be
loved.

After reading Governor
Rockefeller's recommendations
concerning Latin America, I
cannot say that the leadership of
this nation is trying to understand
or help us, but that is not the
point; things are worse than no
help. The Governor is practically
recommending the killing of any
movement in Latin America that
might be interested in redirecting
the course of our destiny. He
suggests more tanks, more
warships, more weapons, and a
better-trained police force.
Why, I wonder, do we need
those things, more of those
things? Who are we afraid of?
What Mr. Rockefeller is offering is
something like this: a pregnant
Indian mother is under great pains
and suffering before giving birth
to her first child, and then comes
an American doctor who upon
noticing the poor woman feels
sorry and gives her a shot, two
shots; to kill the pain, more shots.
But he forgets something.
Whether intentionally or
unintentionally is something for
you, the young generation, to
learn if you really want to redirect
the priorities of your nation. For
us, the question as to why he
forgets is irrelevant. The doctor
forgets the baby is still inside his
mother's womb. More pains, more
shots.
But the baby cannot die. He
must live. The doctor must go.
The baby will live. There is hope
in any nation, there is strength in
every mother.
Perhaps in other countries the
situation is the same and therefore
the remedy must be the same.
More arms, more weapons. And
when we realize that another
month has gone by and a war that
uses the best of arms and weapons
and of technology continues, we
remember what could someday
happen to us. So many cries, baby
cries, mother cries, father tears.
Yet who hears? Who cares? It is
far away and when tears fall, they
do so silently. When kids cry, who
listens? Bombs explode so
violently, so noisily. When many
die that way, who cares about
someone crying? Look homeward,
angel?
Revolution Brings Progress
More arms to Latin America
will simply convert what could
possibly be a fairly peaceful
revolution into a bloody and
long-lasting adventure. Personally,
I interpret a political revolution as
something that has to take place
before any kind of progress can be
made. It is certainly not just any
military plot of which we are so
accustomed to hear. It involves a
transfer of power in which the
oligarchies of Latin America must
give way to a more nationalistic
middle class with passion in their
hearts and knowledge in their
brains to lead the beginning of a
new way of life.
