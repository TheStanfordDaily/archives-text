# Misses Basics
## Mihaly Distortions Howard L. Selznick 
### 
(The following article is in
response to a column printed in
last week's DAILY concerning
anti Zionism among Jews).
Miss Mihaly, your second
article was much better than the
first. I have little argument with
your facts, but you still miss the
basic ideas behind Zionism. True,
there exist some anti-Zionist Jews
and true, there may be
discrimination against Arabs in
Israel. But Jewish anti-Zionists
and overwhelmed by Jewish
pro-Zionists. That there are
distinctions between Arab and
Jewish citizens of Israel cannot be
denied (but consider Israel's
geographic position!). However,
before condemning Zionism for
these reasons, there must be an
understanding of Zonism on a
much larger perspective.
The label of "defeatism" on
Zonism may just be true. After
some two thousand years of
enduring anti-Semitism in the
ghetto and failing in attempts to
assimilate into European culture,
byt the 19th century the Jews
had had enough. They were
"defeated" by organized,
condoned anti-semitism, which
often manifested itself in the
pogrom—genocide on the
installment plan. To "fight"
anti-somitism at its source was
battling thousands of years of
deeply ingrained tradition.
Assimilation just hadn't worked.
A separate Jewish State was seen
as the only answer.
The place had to be Palestine,
the site of ancient biblical Israel.
For generations, the return to
Zon had been a part of Jewish
liturgy. The phrase "next year in
Jerusalem" contained in many
Jewish prayers could no longer be
considered a dream. In a
Palestinian Jewish State Jews

could live as first-class citizens in
their own nation, rather than
second or lower-class residents of
someone else's nation, and above
all, exist as a people.
Jews began emigrating to
Palestine in the 1880's, buying
land from Arabs on which to
settle. All of this was quite legal;
no Arab was ever displaced from
his land without compensation.
There is little doubt that the gap
between Jewish and Arab
standard of living is
embarrassingly large. But one
cannot deny that the Israeli
government is making a concerted
effort to close the gap.
Nonetheless, land ownership
population figures are often used
by Arabs to rationalize their own
socioeconomic position. What is
fairly certain is that the
Palestinian Arab is better off than
other Arabs more as a result of
Jewish immigration than those
Arabs want to think.
I do not deny that Zonist
injustices exist. But by any count,
the world's injustices against the
Jewish People far outnumber any
wrongs of Zionist activity. Of
course, two wrongs do not make a
right. But any criticism or even
condemnation of Zonism and
Israel must first consider the
Jewish People in historical
perspective. A people must have a
nation, if they are to survive as a
people. In this case, the Diaspora
will not suffice any longer.
But what is perhaps more
pertinent now is that a rational
dialogue between Arab and Jew is
needed. Emotional arguments
having little basis in fact only add
more fuel to an already blazing
fire.

Arabs want to think.
I do not deny that Zonist
injustices exist. But by any count,
the world's injustices against the
Jewish People far outnumber any
wrongs of Zionist activity. Of
course, two wrongs do not make a
right. But any criticism or even
condemnation of Zonism and
Israel must first consider the
Jewish People in historical
perspective. A people must have a
nation, if they are to survive as a
people. In this case, the Diaspora
will not suffice any longer.
But what is perhaps more
pertinent now is that a rational
dialogue between Arab and Jew is
needed. Emotional arguments
having little basis in fact only add
more fuel to an already blazing
fire.

anti Zionism among Jews).
Miss Mihaly, your second
article was much better than the
first. I have little argument with
your facts, but you still miss the
basic ideas behind Zionism. True,
there exist some anti-Zionist Jews
and true, there may be
discrimination against Arabs in
Israel. But Jewish anti-Zionists
and overwhelmed by Jewish
pro-Zionists. That there are
distinctions between Arab and
Jewish citizens of Israel cannot be
denied (but consider Israel's
geographic position!). However,
before condemning Zionism for
these reasons, there must be an
understanding of Zonism on a
much larger perspective.
The label of "defeatism" on
Zonism may just be true. After
some two thousand years of
enduring anti-Semitism in the
ghetto and failing in attempts to
assimilate into European culture,
byt the 19th century the Jews
had had enough. They were
"defeated" by organized,
condoned anti-semitism, which
often manifested itself in the
pogrom—genocide on the
installment plan. To "fight"
anti-somitism at its source was
battling thousands of years of
deeply ingrained tradition.
Assimilation just hadn't worked.
A separate Jewish State was seen
as the only answer.
The place had to be Palestine,
the site of ancient biblical Israel.
For generations, the return to
Zon had been a part of Jewish
liturgy. The phrase "next year in
Jerusalem" contained in many
Jewish prayers could no longer be
considered a dream. In a
Palestinian Jewish State Jews

could live as first-class citizens in
their own nation, rather than
second or lower-class residents of
someone else's nation, and above
all, exist as a people.
Jews began emigrating to
Palestine in the 1880's, buying
land from Arabs on which to
settle. All of this was quite legal;
no Arab was ever displaced from
his land without compensation.
There is little doubt that the gap
between Jewish and Arab
standard of living is
embarrassingly large. But one
cannot deny that the Israeli
government is making a concerted
effort to close the gap.
Nonetheless, land ownership
population figures are often used
by Arabs to rationalize their own
socioeconomic position. What is
fairly certain is that the
Palestinian Arab is better off than
other Arabs more as a result of
Jewish immigration than those
Arabs want to think.
