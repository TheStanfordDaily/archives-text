Verses for
America, the Beautiful
November 1969
Our men who have their lives laid down
Must not have died in vain,
Their sacrifice is freedom's crown
Their honor is our gain.
America, America,
Let strife and bloodshed cease!
We'll bend our might
To serve the right —
A world of love and peace.
Our founding fathers forged a dream
, Of human dignity
A glorious, struggling, eager gleam
Not yet reality.
America, America,
Let's make that dream come true
And make life good
In brotherhood
For all, not just a few.
