# 'Peaceful Change' Conference Opens
## 
### SUSAN KRIEGER 
The Hoover Institution's
three-day conference on "Peaceful
Change in Modern Society"
opened yesterday with a look at
man's "natural desire for peace,"
his "drive for power," and an
assesment of his chances for
peaceful solution of future crises.
French political scientist
Bernard de Jouvenel, delivering
the first paper, said that the 20th
century has produced
"managerial" governments and
"customer" citizens who live
under the threat of revolution and
repression.
He explained that "the attitude
of customer predominates over
that of citizen" primarily because
citizens today don't have the
information or interest in making
valid, objective decisions.
Interest Groups
The University of Paris
professor told the conference that
people become increasingly
demanding of their government
without a "commitment to the
acts of choice which must be
performed by the authorities."
The result is that government is
increasingly "buffeted by a great
diversity of demands," which
make it difficult to pursue a
rational policy course.
This "natural drive for power"
is in danger of verifying French
philosopher Cournot's prediction
of 1961 warned de Jouvenel, that
"while administration becomes
more elaborate and scientific,
politics on the other hand
becomes more crude."
A University of Pennsylvania
historian urged the audience to
pierce the illusion that mankind's
recorded life is "one vast
spectacle of violence and
fireworks."
Professor Hilary Conroy,
chairman of the Conference on
Peace Research in History, called
for a closer look at "the almost
unrecognized fact that peace
really is the condition of life for
most of humanity, over most of
the globe, most of the time."
Peaceful Man
If killings from the beginning of
history are broken into
categories—the criminal and the
legal—"it seems certain that the
legalized variety, legalized by war,
kangaroo courts, courts,
inquisitions and the like, will far
outnumber the former ..."
"From these two
observations," Prof. Conroy
concluded, "it would seem to be
indicated that man has no natural
desire to kill other human beings,
that he must find rationalizations
for doing so."
Taking exception with those
who ascribe to man the "natural

aggressive instincts" of lower
animals, the historian suggested
that we "question evolution a
little more than we are
accustomed to do."
Vietnam
Former British Prime Minister
Anthony Eden in the afternoon
address, urged the
"neutralization" of the entire
Indochinese peninsula as an
"existing solution" to the
Vietnam war.
Mr. Eden's paper was read to
the conference by the British
Consul General for San Francisco,
John Owen Lloyd, due to the
poor health of the now Earl of
Avon.
Calling the U.N. "too diffuse"
and N.A.T.O. too small for
settlement of international
disagreement, Lord Avon urged
the formation of some sort of
"organization among the free
nations" to arrive at future
decisions.
The conference was opened by
the Hoover Institution's director
of 10 years, Glenn Campbell. It
will continue today and
tomorrow, and is free to the
public.
