# To Spiro

Spiro Spiro
Against the wall
Who's the most
Effete of all?
Students, blackmen,
Beggermen, Reds:
Rot ton apples,
Better dead.
Spiro, Spiro,
don't despair,
There's a better
Land somewhere!
Where students are not
Cursed with brains,
Blackmen are "nice,"
Harmony reigns!

Beggers act like
Beggers should.
All reds are dead.
All Greeks are good.
But Spiro, such
Is not this nation.
And though we mourn
Your Castigation
We will not yield
To translocation
To places of
Incarceration
Or even simple
Castration.
