## Silent Majority Approves? 
### William Bonner 
The Nixon Administration
postulates support by the "silent
majority" of Americans for its
war policy in Vietnam. Indeed,
through the newspapers, the
"silent majority" has been urged
recently to show administration
support and opposition to the
November Moratorium by the acts
of driving with headlights lighted
and flying the American flag at
home. These are relatively passive
and easy acts, hardly in the
category of participation in a
Moratorium march, but are
symbolic acts, nevertheless.
At noon on Friday, November
14th, some 5000 people of all
ages staged an anti-war march
through the Stanford Industrial
Park. That evening some 1 100
persons participated in a peace
rally at The Plaza in Palo Alto,
followed by a march to the First
Prosbyterian Church. The next
day over 100,000 war protesters

marched in San Francisco, while
some 250,000 marched in
Washington, D.C. In order to
assess the importance of the
"silent majority" opposing these
demonstrators, I decided to make
a private local survey of the
symbolic headlights and flags at
the time of these demonstrations.
While the Stanford Industrial
Park march was in progress I
stood for an hour at one of Palo
Alto's busiest intersections, El
Camino Real and Page Mill Road,
and counted (using a mechanical
counter) cars travelling with and
without lighted headlights. Out of
1880 vehicles counted, only 9
vehicles (5 cars, 3 trucks, 1 bus)
(0.48%) had lighted headlights.
Later that afternoon I stationed
myself on the pedestrian overpass
at Oregon Avenue and counted
1 520 vehicles travelling
southbound on Bayshore
Freeway. Exactly 30 (1.98%) had

lighted headlights. On that same
Friday afternoon I drove 10.6
miles through the residential area
of "old" Palo Alto, bounded by
Oregon, Channing, Alma and
Middlefield—with the purpose of
counting homes which were flying
flags. Since this is the wealthiest,
and presumably the most
conservative, section of Palo Alto,
I anticipated a maximum of
Nixon Administration support in
this area. Out of 1000 homes
which I counted, only 21 (2.1%)
were flying flags.
One hesitates to extrapolate
from such small samples. To me,
however, the above data do
suggest that—while a "silent
majority" of Americans does in
fact clearly exist—the Nixon
Administration may be deluding
itself harmfully with its
assumption that silence implies
approval.

ages staged an anti-war march
through the Stanford Industrial
Park. That evening some 1 100
persons participated in a peace
rally at The Plaza in Palo Alto,
followed by a march to the First
Prosbyterian Church. The next
day over 100,000 war protesters

marched in San Francisco, while
some 250,000 marched in
Washington, D.C. In order to
assess the importance of the
"silent majority" opposing these
demonstrators, I decided to make
a private local survey of the
symbolic headlights and flags at
the time of these demonstrations.
While the Stanford Industrial
Park march was in progress I
stood for an hour at one of Palo
Alto's busiest intersections, El
Camino Real and Page Mill Road,
and counted (using a mechanical
counter) cars travelling with and
without lighted headlights. Out of
1880 vehicles counted, only 9
vehicles (5 cars, 3 trucks, 1 bus)
(0.48%) had lighted headlights.
Later that afternoon I stationed
myself on the pedestrian overpass
at Oregon Avenue and counted
1 520 vehicles travelling
southbound on Bayshore
Freeway. Exactly 30 (1.98%) had

lighted headlights. On that same
Friday afternoon I drove 10.6
miles through the residential area
of "old" Palo Alto, bounded by
Oregon, Channing, Alma and
Middlefield—with the purpose of
counting homes which were flying
flags. Since this is the wealthiest,
and presumably the most
conservative, section of Palo Alto,
I anticipated a maximum of
Nixon Administration support in
this area. Out of 1000 homes
which I counted, only 21 (2.1%)
were flying flags.
One hesitates to extrapolate
from such small samples. To me,
however, the above data do
suggest that—while a "silent
majority" of Americans does in
fact clearly exist—the Nixon
Administration may be deluding
itself harmfully with its
assumption that silence implies
approval.
The Nixon Administration
postulates support by the "silent
majority" of Americans for its
war policy in Vietnam. Indeed,
through the newspapers, the
"silent majority" has been urged
recently to show administration
support and opposition to the
November Moratorium by the acts
of driving with headlights lighted
and flying the American flag at
home. These are relatively passive
and easy acts, hardly in the
category of participation in a
Moratorium march, but are
symbolic acts, nevertheless.
At noon on Friday, November
14th, some 5000 people of all
ages staged an anti-war march
through the Stanford Industrial
Park. That evening some 1 100
