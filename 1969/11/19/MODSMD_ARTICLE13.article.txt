# Open Letter
## Spiro BUGS Me 
### Daniel A. Dresner 
(This is a copy of an open letter
sent to the Vice President by
Daniel Dresner, a Professor in the
Department of Biological
Sciences.)
Dear Mr. Vice President:
Since the October 15 th
Moratorium, I have felt a growing
sense of distress over the direction
in which our country seems
headed. The role you are playing
in your position of power, and
where that role is leading
America, disturbs me
disproportionately to the actual
content of your recent speeches;
Mr. Agnew, you are no longer
governor; you are the Vice
President of the United States of
America. As the Governor of
Maryland, you were able to allow
yourself the luxury of expressing
personal opinions on public issues;
as the Vice President of the
United States you may not take
such stands.
The offices of any organization
assume import and meaning, as
the organization matures, beyond
the personalities of the persons
occupying those offices. The
offices of the President and of the
Vice President are cases in point.
When you speak, Mr. Agnew, you
may intend to reflect your
personal feelings, but your
remarks are interpreted in an
entirely different context. They
are heard and interpreted by the
public not as Spiro Agnew's
personal opinion, but as the stand
of the Vice President of the
United States. Your disregard of
this fact has set into operation a
kind of social polarization which
is concealed by our penchant for
tabloid thinking. The country is
being separated into two camps. A
schism is developing, which
divides us not into groups of Left
vs. Right, or Hippie vs.
Establishment but, far more
dangerous than any of these, into
those with the national leaders on
their side and those who have no
national leaders. The latter group,
Mr. Agnew, is being
disenfranchised.
Sympathetic Ears
If you refer back to history,
you must realize that groups
which , lose at least the
sympathetic ears of their
governments eventually are forced
to align themselves against their
governments. The move obvious
examples are overworked, but

valid: the Russian Revolution, the
many African revolutions of the
last fifteen years, the Hungarian
and Czechoslovakian uprisings,
the Mexican Revolution, and the
American Revolution. In all cases,
revolutionaries arose from groups
of people who felt their
governments were not willing to
hear their grievances in good faith;
the governments ignored their
citizen's peaceful petitions,
leaving the people no other choice
but "illegal" attempts at making
themselves heard. In all cases, the
incumbent governments felt the
people were using means of being
heard which, at best, were wrong.
In all cases, the incumbent
governments of which I write no
longer exist.
Magical Formula
It is fatal to believe that
America has found some magical
formula whereby it can ignore, or
repress by legislation or by
rhetorical intimidation, the
feelings of so many people and
hope to escape the same end that
befell so many other great
countries before us.
Saturday, over one and one-half
million people in America (a
conservative estimate)
demonstrated feelings of
discontent. There were many
more in countries across the world
who also demonstrated their
feelings, even though they are not
citizens of this country. This is
substantially more than the "few
hundred thousand people" of
whom you spoke last week. This
has been the largest peaceful mass
protest this country has ever seen.
Divisive Hatred
The American People have a
constitutional right to campaign
against any member of the
American Government or any of
its policies, but no member of the
government has the right to
campaign against the American
People. Whether your recent
speeches have been aimed at
providing a rallying-point for the
"silent majority," or they have
reflected your personal
impatience with those who
oppose you, take care lest they
backfire; where ostensibly you
may be seeking support for
governmental policies, or may
simply be giving vent to personal
feelings, you are actually
encouraging a divisive, dangerous
hatred.
