## BYU Statement Refutes Pitzer 
### Milton F. Hartvigen 
(This article is reprinted from
the DESERET NEWS, November
8, 1969 issue, at the request of
Stanford graduate Jerry Mason,
who protested President Pitzer's
recent policy statement that
ended competition with BYU.)

On October 22, 1969, Western
Athletic Conference
Commissioner Wiles Hallock
stated "there are organized forces
outside our member universities
which seek to discredit and divide
us on the basis of false charges
relative to racial and civil rights
policies in the conduct of our
athletic programs . . .1 am not in
the least pessimistic about our
ability as a conference to arrive at
solutions which will meet the
needs of everyone seeking
reasonable and practical answers."
In the spirit of a "reasonable
and practical" approach to the
current situation, Brigham Young
University submits the following:
The official admission policy at
Brigham Young University is set
clearly in its catalog as follows:
"Students of any race, creed,
color, or national origin are
accepted for admission to
Brigham Young University
provided they maintain ideals and
standards in harmony with those
of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints and meet the
University's academic
requirements . . ."
70 Foreign Countries
This policy in statement or in
fact in no way restricts anyone
from attending BYU because of
the color of his skin. Negroes,
Indians, Hawaiians, Japanese, and
all other races, are all welcome;
and all have been, and are now, a
part of our student body at BYU.
During the current semester more
than a thousand students from
approximately 70 foreign
countries have selected BYU as
the University of their choice.
Their color ranges from black to
brown to yellow to white. Their
religious affiliation from Islam to
Hindu to Roman Catholic to
Protestant to Mormon. To our

knowledge there are few, if any,
universities in the United States
that have tried harder to make
minority-group and foreign
students more welcome.
True, there is not a large
number of black students on our
campus. But that is a result of
their decisions, not of our policy.
So far as we know, there is only
one Negro family in the entire
county where BYU is located.
This appears to be an important
influencing factor in the decision
these Negro students make to not
come to BYU. Those who have
come and who are here now have
made no suggestion that racial
discrimination is practiced against
them.
48 Indian Tribes
BYU has been able to attract a
large Indian enrollment because
we are grographically in the heart
of Indian country. This year there
are 279 Indian students on
campus representing 48 tribes and
16 blends. Should some of the
other schools in the Western
Athletic Conference be branded as
"racists" because they have
almost no Indians in their student
bodies? Indian attendance at BYU
is analogous to Negro attendance
at schools in areas of large Negro
populations.
When we have tried to recruit
Negro athletes at the BYU, we
have, frankly, not met with much
success. We have had two fine
Negro students on our track team.
Another tried out for our
basketball team. He was given
every opportunity, even though
his high school athletic
performance did not merit it. He
was the last one cut from the
team, long after it was discovered
he could not come up to the
standards required in Western
Athletic Conference competition.
Incidentally, he ran for BYU

Freshman Class President and lost
out in the finals by only a slender
margin.
No Serious Problem
One would expect to get
complaints against our policy
from those who know us best,
such as the many non-Mormon
athletes on our teams, who come
from widely varied racial, cultural,
social, and religious backgrounds.
There has never been a serious
problem among BYU athletes
relative to discrimination during
all the years of intercollegiate
athletics at BYU. Typical response
from a non-Mormon athlete
comes from a current member of
the track team. "I will never
become a Mormon. I'll never be
criticized here for that decision,
and never rejected either. They
just figure that this is my business.
That is also the way I feel about
their policy."
BYU has never refused to play
any team, regardless of the race,
religion, or color of the opposing
team members, and has never
attempted to dictate the racial
composition of opposing teams.
BYU "One of the Finest"
In order to find out if racial
discrimination was practiced at
BYU, the Civil Rights Office of
the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare made a
thorough study of all the practices
which related to possible
discrimination on the BYU
campus. On March 27, 1969, the
Civil Rights Director of the
Denver office informed President
Wilkinson that "Brigham Young
University is deemed to be in
compliance with Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964." The
letter also stated: "We think you
might like to know that we still
consider Brigham Young as being
one of the very finest schools we
have visited."

While we at BYU are
concerned, as you all are, with the
events of the past few weeks,
there is a larger problem we all
face which we must not overlook.
That problem: Can intercollegiate
athletics be used as the whipping
boy for those who have an ax to
grind in other unrelated areas? In
the last analysis, the problem
omes down to that of whether a
university still has the right to
determine its athletic policy, or
whether this policy is to be
determined by dissidentsâ€”regard
less of their color.
We Remain Cool
President Wilkinson had to
leave for Vietnam on Friday
morning of last week (October
31). He is one of a delegation of
about 25 Americans who were
asked months ago to make the
trip and analyze what can be done
by American industry, civic
groups, and educational
institutions to assist the people of
that country. Three days prior to
his leaving he wrote Western
Athletic Conference
Commissioner, Wiles Hallock, as
follows:
"As soon as I return, I would
like to talk with you to get the
benefit of any suggestions you
have at that time.
"We are vitally concerned, as
you are, that any problems which
confront the Western Athletic
Conference be worked out to he
best advantage of each Conference
member. You can be sure that the
administrative officers of Brigham
Young University will cooperate
fully to this end. But while
important issues are being
resolved, it is imperative that we
remain cool and objective in the
face of pressures which would
encourage us to act otherwise."

Brigham Young University.)
