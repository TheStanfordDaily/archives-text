## Criticisms of Consumer Theory

two part article on Women's
Liberation.)
i ho argument that the
corporations create new
psychological needs in order to
sell their wares is similarly flimsy.
There is no evidence that
propaganda can in itself create a
desire, as opposed to bringing to
consciousness a latent desire by
suggesting that means of satisfying
it are available. This idea is
superstitious: it implies that the
oppressor is diabolically
intelligent (he has learned to
control human souls) and that the
media have magic powers. It also
mistakes effects for causes and
drastically oversimplifies the
relation between ideology and
material conditions. We have not
been taught to dislike our smell in
order to sell deodorants;
deodorants sell because there are

social consequences for smelling.
And the negative attitude about
our bodies that has made it
feasible to invent and market
deodorants is deeply rooted in our
anti-sexual culture, which in turn
has been shaped by exploitive
modes of production and class
antagonism between men and
women.
The confusion between the
cause and effect is particularly
apparent in the consumerist
analysis of women's oppression.
Women are not manipulated by
the media into being domestic
servants and mindless sexual
decorations, the better to sell soap
and hair spray. Rather the image
reflects women as men in a sexist
society force them to behave.
Male supremacy is the oldest and
most basic form of class
exploitation (cf. Engles, Origin of
the Family); it was not invented
bv a smart ass man. The real evil

of the media image of women is
that it supports the sexist status
quo. In a sense the fashion,
cosmetics and "feminine hygiene"
ads are aimed more at men than at
women. They encourage men to
expect women to sport all the
latest trappings of sexual
slavery—expectations women
must then fulfill if they are to
survive. That advertisers exploit
women's subordination rathe.-
than cause it can clearly be seen
now that male fashions and
toiletries have become big
business. In contrast to ads for
women's products, whose appeal
is "use this and he will want you"
(or, "if you don't use this, he
won't want you"), ads for the
male counterparts urge, "you too
can enjoy perfume and gright
colored clothes; don't worry, it
doesn't make you look feminine."
Although advertisers are careful to
emphasize how virile these
products are (giving them
names—like "Brut," showing the
man who uses them hunting or
flirting with admiring women
(who, incidentally, remain
decorative objects when the sell is
aimed directly at men) it is never
claimed that the product is
essential to masculinity (as
makeup is essential to femininity),
only compatible with it. To
convince a man to buy, an ad
must appeal to his desire for
autonomy and freedom from
conventional restrictions; to
convince a woman, an ad must
appeal to her need to please the
male oppressor.
For women, buying and
wearing clothes and beauty aids is
not so much consumption as
work. One of a woman's jobs in
this society is to be an attractive
sexual object, and clothes and
makeup are tools of the trade.
The chief consumer in this
instance is really the man, who
consumes woman—as—sexual
—commodity. Similarly, buying
food and household furnishings is
a domestic task; it is the wife's
chore to pick out the
commodities that will be
consumed by the whole family.
And appliances and cleaning

materials are tools that facilitate
her domestic function. When a
woman spends a lot of money and
time decorating her home or
herself, or hunting down the latest
in vacuum cleaners, it is not idle
self-indulgence (let alone the
result of psychic manipulation)
but a healthy attempt to find
outlets for her creative energies
within her circumscribed role.
There is a persistent myth that
a wife has control over her
husband's money because she gets
to spend it. Actually, she does not
have much more financial
autonomy than the employee of a
corporation who is delegated to
buy office furniture or supplies.
The husband, especially if he is
rich, may allow his wife wide
latitude in spending—he may
reason that since she has to work
in the home she is entitled to
furnish it to her taste, or he may
simply not want to bother with
domestic details-but he retains
the ultimate veto power. If he
doesn't like the way his wife
handles his money, she will hear
about it. In most houf
particularly in the workin a
wife cannot make tit
expenditures, either per in
her role as object-servat out
consulting her husband .lore
often than not, g to
statistics, it is the husband who
makes the final decisions about
furniture and appliances as well as
other major expenditures like
houses, cars and vacations.
Plastic Existence
Consumerism is the outgrowth
of an aristocratic,
European-oriented
anti-materialism based on
upper-class resentment against the
rise of the vulgar bourgeois.
Radical intellectuals have been
attracted to this essentially
reactionary position (Herbert

Marcuse's view of mass culture is
strikingly similar to that of
conservative theorists like Ernest
Van Den Haag) because it appeals
to both their dislike of capitalism
and their feelings of superiority to
the working class. This elitism is
evident in radical's conviction that
they have seen through the
system, while the average working
slob is brainwashed by the media.
(Oddly, no one claims that the
ruling class is oppressed by
commodities; it seems that rich
people consume out of free
choice.) Ultimately this point of
view leads to a sterile emphasis on
individual solutions—if only the
benighted would reject their
"plastic" existence and move to
East Village tenements—and the
conclucion that people are
oppressed because they are stupid
or sick. The obnoxiousness of this
attitude is compounded by the
fact that radicals can only
maintain their dropout existence
so long as plenty of brainwashed
workers keep the economy going.
Consumerism as applied to
women is blatantly sexist. The

pervasive image of the
empty-headed female consumer
constantly trying her husband's
patience with her extravagant
purchases contributes to the myth
of male superiority: we are
incapable of spending money
rationally; all we need to make us
happy is a new hat now and then.
(There is an analogous racial
stereotype—the black with his
Cadillac and loud shirts.) The
consumer line allows movement
men to avoid recognizing that
they exploit women by
attributing women's oppression
solely to capitalism. It fits neatly
into already existing radical
theory and concerns, saving the
movement the trouble of tackling
the real problems of women's
liberation. Just as in the male
move ent, consumerism
encourages radical women to
patronize and put down other
women for trying to survive as
best they can, and maintains
individualist illusions.

There is a persistent myth that
a wife has control over her
husband's money because she gets
to spend it. Actually, she does not
have much more financial
autonomy than the employee of a
corporation who is delegated to
buy office furniture or supplies.
The husband, especially if he is
rich, may allow his wife wide
latitude in spending—he may
reason that since she has to work
in the home she is entitled to
furnish it to her taste, or he may
simply not want to bother with
domestic details-but he retains
the ultimate veto power. If he
doesn't like the way his wife
handles his money, she will hear
about it. In most houf
particularly in the workin a
wife cannot make tit
expenditures, either per in
her role as object-servat out
consulting her husband .lore
often than not, g to
statistics, it is the husband who
makes the final decisions about
furniture and appliances as well as
other major expenditures like
houses, cars and vacations.
Plastic Existence
Consumerism is the outgrowth
of an aristocratic,
European-oriented
anti-materialism based on
upper-class resentment against the
rise of the vulgar bourgeois.
Radical intellectuals have been
attracted to this essentially
reactionary position (Herbert

Marcuse's view of mass culture is
strikingly similar to that of
conservative theorists like Ernest
Van Den Haag) because it appeals
to both their dislike of capitalism
and their feelings of superiority to
the working class. This elitism is
evident in radical's conviction that
they have seen through the
system, while the average working
slob is brainwashed by the media.
(Oddly, no one claims that the
ruling class is oppressed by
commodities; it seems that rich
people consume out of free
choice.) Ultimately this point of
view leads to a sterile emphasis on
individual solutions—if only the
benighted would reject their
"plastic" existence and move to
East Village tenements—and the
conclucion that people are
oppressed because they are stupid
or sick. The obnoxiousness of this
attitude is compounded by the
fact that radicals can only
maintain their dropout existence
so long as plenty of brainwashed
workers keep the economy going.
Consumerism as applied to
women is blatantly sexist. The

pervasive image of the
empty-headed female consumer
constantly trying her husband's
patience with her extravagant
purchases contributes to the myth
of male superiority: we are
incapable of spending money
rationally; all we need to make us
happy is a new hat now and then.
(There is an analogous racial
stereotype—the black with his
Cadillac and loud shirts.) The
consumer line allows movement
men to avoid recognizing that
they exploit women by
attributing women's oppression
solely to capitalism. It fits neatly
into already existing radical
theory and concerns, saving the
movement the trouble of tackling
the real problems of women's
liberation. Just as in the male
move ent, consumerism
encourages radical women to
patronize and put down other
women for trying to survive as
best they can, and maintains
individualist illusions.

i ho argument that the
corporations create new
psychological needs in order to
sell their wares is similarly flimsy.
There is no evidence that
propaganda can in itself create a
desire, as opposed to bringing to
consciousness a latent desire by
suggesting that means of satisfying
it are available. This idea is
superstitious: it implies that the
oppressor is diabolically
intelligent (he has learned to
control human souls) and that the
media have magic powers. It also
mistakes effects for causes and
drastically oversimplifies the
relation between ideology and
material conditions. We have not
been taught to dislike our smell in
order to sell deodorants;
deodorants sell because there are

social consequences for smelling.
And the negative attitude about
our bodies that has made it
feasible to invent and market
deodorants is deeply rooted in our
anti-sexual culture, which in turn
has been shaped by exploitive
modes of production and class
antagonism between men and
women.
The confusion between the
cause and effect is particularly
apparent in the consumerist
analysis of women's oppression.
Women are not manipulated by
the media into being domestic
servants and mindless sexual
decorations, the better to sell soap
and hair spray. Rather the image
reflects women as men in a sexist
society force them to behave.
Male supremacy is the oldest and
most basic form of class
exploitation (cf. Engles, Origin of
the Family); it was not invented
bv a smart ass man. The real evil

of the media image of women is
that it supports the sexist status
quo. In a sense the fashion,
cosmetics and "feminine hygiene"
ads are aimed more at men than at
women. They encourage men to
expect women to sport all the
latest trappings of sexual
slavery—expectations women
must then fulfill if they are to
survive. That advertisers exploit
women's subordination rathe.-
than cause it can clearly be seen
now that male fashions and
toiletries have become big
business. In contrast to ads for
women's products, whose appeal
is "use this and he will want you"
(or, "if you don't use this, he
won't want you"), ads for the
male counterparts urge, "you too
can enjoy perfume and gright
colored clothes; don't worry, it
doesn't make you look feminine."
Although advertisers are careful to
emphasize how virile these
products are (giving them
names—like "Brut," showing the
man who uses them hunting or
flirting with admiring women
(who, incidentally, remain
decorative objects when the sell is
aimed directly at men) it is never
claimed that the product is
essential to masculinity (as
makeup is essential to femininity),
only compatible with it. To
convince a man to buy, an ad
must appeal to his desire for
autonomy and freedom from
conventional restrictions; to
convince a woman, an ad must
appeal to her need to please the
male oppressor.
For women, buying and
wearing clothes and beauty aids is
not so much consumption as
work. One of a woman's jobs in
this society is to be an attractive
sexual object, and clothes and
makeup are tools of the trade.
The chief consumer in this
instance is really the man, who
consumes woman—as—sexual
—commodity. Similarly, buying
food and household furnishings is
a domestic task; it is the wife's
chore to pick out the
commodities that will be
consumed by the whole family.
And appliances and cleaning

materials are tools that facilitate
her domestic function. When a
woman spends a lot of money and
time decorating her home or
herself, or hunting down the latest
in vacuum cleaners, it is not idle
self-indulgence (let alone the

oppressor is diabolically
intelligent (he has learned to
control human souls) and that the
media have magic powers. It also
mistakes effects for causes and
drastically oversimplifies the
relation between ideology and
material conditions. We have not
been taught to dislike our smell in
order to sell deodorants;
deodorants sell because there are

social consequences for smelling.
And the negative attitude about
our bodies that has made it
feasible to invent and market
deodorants is deeply rooted in our
anti-sexual culture, which in turn
has been shaped by exploitive
modes of production and class
antagonism between men and
women.
The confusion between the
cause and effect is particularly
apparent in the consumerist
analysis of women's oppression.
Women are not manipulated by
the media into being domestic
servants and mindless sexual
decorations, the better to sell soap
and hair spray. Rather the image
reflects women as men in a sexist
society force them to behave.
Male supremacy is the oldest and
most basic form of class
exploitation (cf. Engles, Origin of
the Family); it was not invented
bv a smart ass man. The real evil

of the media image of women is
that it supports the sexist status
quo. In a sense the fashion,
cosmetics and "feminine hygiene"
ads are aimed more at men than at
women. They encourage men to
expect women to sport all the
latest trappings of sexual
slavery—expectations women
must then fulfill if they are to
survive. That advertisers exploit
women's subordination rathe.-
than cause it can clearly be seen
now that male fashions and
toiletries have become big
business. In contrast to ads for
women's products, whose appeal
is "use this and he will want you"
(or, "if you don't use this, he
won't want you"), ads for the
male counterparts urge, "you too
can enjoy perfume and gright
colored clothes; don't worry, it
doesn't make you look feminine."
Although advertisers are careful to
emphasize how virile these
products are (giving them
names—like "Brut," showing the
man who uses them hunting or
flirting with admiring women
(who, incidentally, remain
decorative objects when the sell is
aimed directly at men) it is never
claimed that the product is
essential to masculinity (as
makeup is essential to femininity),
only compatible with it. To
convince a man to buy, an ad
must appeal to his desire for
autonomy and freedom from
conventional restrictions; to
convince a woman, an ad must
appeal to her need to please the
male oppressor.
For women, buying and
wearing clothes and beauty aids is
not so much consumption as
work. One of a woman's jobs in
this society is to be an attractive
sexual object, and clothes and
makeup are tools of the trade.
The chief consumer in this
instance is really the man, who
consumes woman—as—sexual
—commodity. Similarly, buying
food and household furnishings is
a domestic task; it is the wife's
chore to pick out the
commodities that will be
consumed by the whole family.
And appliances and cleaning

materials are tools that facilitate
her domestic function. When a
woman spends a lot of money and
time decorating her home or
herself, or hunting down the latest
in vacuum cleaners, it is not idle
self-indulgence (let alone the
result of psychic manipulation)
but a healthy attempt to find
outlets for her creative energies
within her circumscribed role.
There is a persistent myth that
a wife has control over her
husband's money because she gets
to spend it. Actually, she does not
have much more financial
autonomy than the employee of a
corporation who is delegated to
buy office furniture or supplies.
The husband, especially if he is
rich, may allow his wife wide
latitude in spending—he may
reason that since she has to work
in the home she is entitled to
furnish it to her taste, or he may
simply not want to bother with
domestic details-but he retains
the ultimate veto power. If he
doesn't like the way his wife
handles his money, she will hear
about it. In most houf
particularly in the workin a
wife cannot make tit
expenditures, either per in
her role as object-servat out
consulting her husband .lore
often than not, g to
statistics, it is the husband who
makes the final decisions about
furniture and appliances as well as
other major expenditures like
houses, cars and vacations.
Plastic Existence
Consumerism is the outgrowth
of an aristocratic,
European-oriented
anti-materialism based on
upper-class resentment against the
rise of the vulgar bourgeois.
Radical intellectuals have been
attracted to this essentially
reactionary position (Herbert

Marcuse's view of mass culture is
strikingly similar to that of
conservative theorists like Ernest
Van Den Haag) because it appeals
to both their dislike of capitalism
and their feelings of superiority to
the working class. This elitism is
evident in radical's conviction that
they have seen through the
system, while the average working
slob is brainwashed by the media.
(Oddly, no one claims that the
ruling class is oppressed by
commodities; it seems that rich
people consume out of free
choice.) Ultimately this point of
view leads to a sterile emphasis on
individual solutions—if only the
benighted would reject their
"plastic" existence and move to
East Village tenements—and the
conclucion that people are
oppressed because they are stupid
or sick. The obnoxiousness of this
attitude is compounded by the
fact that radicals can only
maintain their dropout existence
so long as plenty of brainwashed
workers keep the economy going.
Consumerism as applied to
women is blatantly sexist. The

pervasive image of the
empty-headed female consumer
constantly trying her husband's
patience with her extravagant
purchases contributes to the myth
of male superiority: we are
incapable of spending money
rationally; all we need to make us
happy is a new hat now and then.
(There is an analogous racial
stereotype—the black with his
Cadillac and loud shirts.) The
consumer line allows movement
men to avoid recognizing that
they exploit women by
attributing women's oppression
solely to capitalism. It fits neatly
into already existing radical
theory and concerns, saving the
movement the trouble of tackling
the real problems of women's
liberation. Just as in the male
move ent, consumerism
encourages radical women to
patronize and put down other
women for trying to survive as
best they can, and maintains
individualist illusions.

The husband, especially if he is
rich, may allow his wife wide
latitude in spending—he may
reason that since she has to work
in the home she is entitled to
furnish it to her taste, or he may
simply not want to bother with
domestic details-but he retains
the ultimate veto power. If he
doesn't like the way his wife
handles his money, she will hear
about it. In most houf
particularly in the workin a
wife cannot make tit
expenditures, either per in
her role as object-servat out
consulting her husband .lore
often than not, g to
statistics, it is the husband who
makes the final decisions about
furniture and appliances as well as
other major expenditures like
houses, cars and vacations.
Plastic Existence
Consumerism is the outgrowth
of an aristocratic,
European-oriented
anti-materialism based on
upper-class resentment against the
rise of the vulgar bourgeois.
Radical intellectuals have been
attracted to this essentially
reactionary position (Herbert

Marcuse's view of mass culture is
strikingly similar to that of
conservative theorists like Ernest
Van Den Haag) because it appeals
to both their dislike of capitalism
and their feelings of superiority to
the working class. This elitism is
evident in radical's conviction that
they have seen through the
system, while the average working
slob is brainwashed by the media.
(Oddly, no one claims that the
ruling class is oppressed by
commodities; it seems that rich
people consume out of free
choice.) Ultimately this point of
view leads to a sterile emphasis on
individual solutions—if only the
benighted would reject their
"plastic" existence and move to
East Village tenements—and the
conclucion that people are
oppressed because they are stupid
or sick. The obnoxiousness of this
attitude is compounded by the
fact that radicals can only
maintain their dropout existence
so long as plenty of brainwashed
workers keep the economy going.
Consumerism as applied to
women is blatantly sexist. The

pervasive image of the
empty-headed female consumer
constantly trying her husband's
patience with her extravagant
purchases contributes to the myth
of male superiority: we are
incapable of spending money
rationally; all we need to make us
happy is a new hat now and then.
(There is an analogous racial
stereotype—the black with his
Cadillac and loud shirts.) The
consumer line allows movement
men to avoid recognizing that
they exploit women by
attributing women's oppression
solely to capitalism. It fits neatly
into already existing radical
theory and concerns, saving the
movement the trouble of tackling
the real problems of women's
liberation. Just as in the male
move ent, consumerism
encourages radical women to
patronize and put down other
women for trying to survive as
best they can, and maintains
individualist illusions.
