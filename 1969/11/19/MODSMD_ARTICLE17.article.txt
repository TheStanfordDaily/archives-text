Here is a man who was
born of poor parents in an
obscure village, the child of a
peasant woman.
He grew up in another
obscure village. He worked in
a carpenter shop until He was
thirty; and then for three
years. He was an itinerant
preacher. He never wrote a
book.
He never held an office.
He never owned a home. He
never had a family. He never
went to college. He never put
His foot inside a big city. He
never traveled two hundred
miles from the place where
He was born. He never did
one of the things that usually
accompany greatness. He had
no credentials but Himself.
He had nothing to do with
this world except the power
of His divine manhood. While
still a young man, the tide of
popular opinion turned
.igainst Him.
His friends ran away. One
of them denied Him. He was

turned over to His enemies.
He went through the
moekery of a trial.
He was nailed to a cross
between two thieves. His
tormentors gambled for the
only piece of property He
had on earth while He was
dying and that was His robe.
When He was dead, He was
taken down and laid in a
borrowed grave through the
pity of a friend.
Nineteen wide centuries
have come and gone and
today He is the centerpiece
of the human race and thy
leader of the column of
progress. I am far within the
mark when I say that all the
armies that ever marched,
and all the navies that ever
were built, and all the
parliaments that ever sat, and
all the kings that ever
reigned, put together, have
not affected the life of man
upon this earth as powerfully
as has that ONE SOLITARY
LIFE.
