# Nixon's Policy
## Pyrrhic Peace 
### John Buster 
Some unhappy generals win
Pyrrhic victories. Richard Nixon
appears the first ever to pursue a
Pyrrhic peaceâ€”a peace gained at
too great a cost of lives, limbs,
and economic potentialities. A
peace that promises to take years
for the President to "win" (his
wording), if the last 20 years of
continuous fighting are any
indication of how strongly the
Vietnamese demand
self-determination for their
nation.
Remember that a million
Vietnamese, all speaking the same
language, have proven with their
lives since 1941 that they want
their land free of foreign armies,
whether Japanese, French, or
American. Compare that, if you
doubt their perseverance, with the
4,435 Americans who died in our
Revolutionary War to free us from
King George's troops. Would we
have dared to win our
independence at such a price?
The Vietnamese sacrifice makes
Washington's Valley Forge seem

like a summer camp, yet both of
our patriots were fighting for the
same human rights. Then why do
we insist now on interfering with
the Vietnamese rights the way the
English in 1775 interfered with
ours? Because somewhere
between Valley Forge and
Vietnam, one of Washington's
successors forgot the Declaration
of Independence. There, the
United States proclaimed to the
world:
We hold these truths to be
self-evident: that all men are created
equal; that they are endowed by
their Creator with certain
unalienable rights; that among these
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness; that, to secure these
rights, governments are instituted
among men, deriving their just
powers from the consent of the
governed; that, whenever any form
of government becomes destructive
of these ends, it is the right of the
people to alter or to abolish it, and
to institute a new government,
laying its foundation on such
principles, and organizing its powers
in such form as to them shall seem
most likely to effect their safety
and happiness.
Inalienable Rights
Recent Presidents have been
arguing that the Creator, by a
quirk of favoritism, in fact
endowed only Americans with
unalienable rights, and that He
gave the Vietnamese people
absolutely no right to declare
themselves free from their
foreign-run junta and to institute
a new government upon another
principle.
Our Presidents do not quote
the Declaration of Independence
in their television speeches any
more, and they wear blinders
when they look at history.
Because he cannot win the war,
Richard Nixon claims he seeks a
just peace; by that, I take it, he
simply means a peace acceptable
to him. And, like Lyndon
Johnson before him, he asks that
all true Americans at least be
quiet, if they do not agree with
his policies. So, two questions for
Mr. Nixon before I play
follow-the-leader and join the
great silent majority that he
counts as supporting him merely
because it does not talk back:
Free Vietnam
Is Nixon positively certain that
the Vietnamese can ever offer him
such a peace? They seek a
Vietnam free fro foreign armies,
and he insists on keeping 300,000
American soldiers there.
Or, shall we Americans,
ignorant of the meaning of our
Declaration of Independence, be
oppressing and be dying another
decade for Nixon's just peace and
just never make it?
The fisherman who
haphazardly hooked the shark
gave good advice, "Better cut bait
than fight for nothing."
