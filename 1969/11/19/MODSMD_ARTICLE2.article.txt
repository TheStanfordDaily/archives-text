# Fire Fighters Join National Union
## 
### ED KOHN 
The twenty-nine members of
the Stanford Fire Department
who joined the International
Association of Fire Fighters
(lAFF) last month received their
union charter Monday night in a
short ceremony at the fire house.
The move came after years of
conflict with the administration.
The local, now known as 1-12,
also installed its officers during
the meeting. Two speakers, Mike
Anthony and Vince Riddle, from
the California Fire Fighters
Association, which is also a part
of the AFL-CIO, addressed the
twenty-five firemen present.
Gary DuFresne, newly-elected
president of the local, said that
the group's first efforts would be
directed towards gaining
recognition from the university
administration. President Pitzer
was invited to last night's
ceremony but declined to attend,
saying that he would not intrude
into the group's activities. He
referred their recognition problem
to Alf Branden, university vice
president for financial affairs.
Grievances Cited
DuFresne cited major problems
that led to unionization as low
pay, longer hours than
comparable fire departments in
this area, sagging morale, a lack of
fringe benefits, including
insurance and days off, an
insufficient retirement program
and no job security. He said that
the firemen's association that had
functioned until recently lost its

effectiveness in dealing with the
administration.
In his address to the firemen,
Riddle called for "good labor
relationships with the university
and a good solid agreement for
the men," He noted that the new
local was one of the first
"industrial unions" to be
chartered in this area. He
commented on the 67.2 hour
workweek for the firemen and
said that this would be one of the
major issues when contract
negotiations begin.
First Chartered
1-12 is the first local to be
chartered on campus. One
fireman, who asked not to be
named, said that there was "some
pressure to keep the men from
joining the union," and his
sentiments were echoed by several
others standing nearby.
Twenty-nine firemen have already
joined 1-12, and another has
indicated interest in joining.
Thirty-three men are eligible to
join the local; no administrative
personnel are permitted in the
organization.
Dues for the group have been
set at $5 a month, with $3 of that
being retained by the local.
The Teamsters Union is also
trying to gain a toehold in the
campus labor scene. It is
continuing its efforts to organize
Physical Plant employees and is
also considering the cafeteria
workers, its next meeting should
be held within a week.
