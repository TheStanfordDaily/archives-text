# Prof Displays Political Conscience With Art
## 
### BONNIE KOEHLER 
Are you familiar with tho red,
white, and blue Moratorium
bumper stickers? How about the
stars and stripes peace symbol
button? Or maybe you've seen the
"M" buttons or the peace
Christmas cards.
These symbols of the
Moratorium were all designed and
contributed by Professor Matt
Kahn of the Stanford Art
Department.
The large red, white, and blue
Moratorium booth in White Plaza
is another Kahn inspiration de
signed and constructed by
students in his Design 160 class
under his direction. Kahn's
students also designed and
produced hundreds of other
posters for the movement.
All designs were contributed to
the Peninsula Vietnam
Moratorium Committee at the
artists' expense. As Kahn stated,
the articles serve two main
purposes the sale of the posters,
stickers, buttons and cards raise
money needed to pay committee
expenses, and they create an

image for the Moratorium while
spreading its message.
Why the combination of art
and politics?
Kahn explained that he could
best express his political
conscience through art. "As a
designer I have methods that are
applicable. This may not be true
of all artists, but I felt this was the
best way that I could contribute
to the anti-war movement."
Speaking of his students, Kahn
explained that he would "much
rather involve his art students in
designing projects for the
Moratorium than merely talk
politics to them." He feels as a
designer and a teacher, that his
specialized skills are best used in
this way.
He attended the first
organizational meeting of the
Moratorium Committee in
October, where he felt the
Movement's need for fund raising
and publicity. Approached to
design a bumper sticker, he went
far beyond this and generated the
designs and ideas himself for
posters, buttons, and cards as the
need arose.

Kahn feels that "individuals
should not wait to be asked to
produce. Each should respond to
the need as best he can."
Surprisingly, Kahn is not on
one of the official Moratorium
committees. "I don't work in
secret, but the kinds of things I do
are best not done through a
committee structure."
He has attended all the
organizational meetings but added
that committees by their nature
are often cautious and prone to
compromise. In relation to design,
"It's surprising how conservative
liberals can be. A committee tends
to push the designer to do highly
conventionalized things."
Kahn's red, white, and blue
stars and stripes peace symbol
bumper stickers and buttons have
received varied reactions. Some
movement members are unsure of
the symbol because of its color
references to the reactionary
"Love It or Leave it" flags. Kahn
denies this, "The Peace Posture is
a highly patriotic one. The
conservatives have usurped the
red, white and blue, and think
they are the only ones who can
use it symbolically. Jefferson
would roll over in his grave."
The Stanford Press printed the
Christmas cards, some items were
printed in Berkeley, and the
buttons were printed in New
York.
Of all the materials designed by
Kahn, he sees the Christmas cards
as the best vehicle to reach people
who may not receive the message
of the Moratorium directly. "We
want to involve people who would
not otherwise think of themselves
as politically active."
Have the designs been
successful? Look around you.
They have both spread the image
and message of the Peninsula
Moratorium Committee and raised
funds. Posters, buttons, cards, and
bumper stickers have been
continually reordered. The
supporters always want what we
have just run out of."
He added, "You should see the
"JOY" peace-symbol cards glow
under a black light, they're wild!"

Surprisingly, Kahn is not on
one of the official Moratorium
committees. "I don't work in
secret, but the kinds of things I do
are best not done through a
committee structure."
He has attended all the
organizational meetings but added
that committees by their nature
are often cautious and prone to
compromise. In relation to design,
"It's surprising how conservative
liberals can be. A committee tends
to push the designer to do highly
conventionalized things."
Kahn's red, white, and blue
stars and stripes peace symbol
bumper stickers and buttons have
received varied reactions. Some
movement members are unsure of
the symbol because of its color
references to the reactionary
"Love It or Leave it" flags. Kahn
denies this, "The Peace Posture is
a highly patriotic one. The
conservatives have usurped the
red, white and blue, and think
they are the only ones who can
use it symbolically. Jefferson
would roll over in his grave."
The Stanford Press printed the
Christmas cards, some items were
printed in Berkeley, and the
buttons were printed in New
York.
Of all the materials designed by
Kahn, he sees the Christmas cards
as the best vehicle to reach people
who may not receive the message
of the Moratorium directly. "We
want to involve people who would
not otherwise think of themselves
as politically active."
Have the designs been
successful? Look around you.
They have both spread the image
and message of the Peninsula
Moratorium Committee and raised
funds. Posters, buttons, cards, and
bumper stickers have been
continually reordered. The
supporters always want what we
have just run out of."
He added, "You should see the
"JOY" peace-symbol cards glow
under a black light, they're wild!"
Are you familiar with tho red,
white, and blue Moratorium
bumper stickers? How about the
stars and stripes peace symbol
button? Or maybe you've seen the
"M" buttons or the peace
Christmas cards.
These symbols of the
Moratorium were all designed and
contributed by Professor Matt
Kahn of the Stanford Art
Department.
The large red, white, and blue
Moratorium booth in White Plaza
is another Kahn inspiration de
signed and constructed by
students in his Design 160 class
under his direction. Kahn's
students also designed and
produced hundreds of other
posters for the movement.
All designs were contributed to
the Peninsula Vietnam
Moratorium Committee at the
artists' expense. As Kahn stated,
the articles serve two main
purposes the sale of the posters,
stickers, buttons and cards raise
money needed to pay committee
expenses, and they create an

image for the Moratorium while
spreading its message.
Why the combination of art
and politics?
Kahn explained that he could
best express his political
conscience through art. "As a
designer I have methods that are
applicable. This may not be true
of all artists, but I felt this was the
best way that I could contribute
to the anti-war movement."
Speaking of his students, Kahn
explained that he would "much
rather involve his art students in
designing projects for the
Moratorium than merely talk
politics to them." He feels as a
designer and a teacher, that his
specialized skills are best used in
this way.
He attended the first
organizational meeting of the
Moratorium Committee in
October, where he felt the
Movement's need for fund raising
and publicity. Approached to
design a bumper sticker, he went
far beyond this and generated the
designs and ideas himself for
posters, buttons, and cards as the
need arose.

Kahn feels that "individuals
should not wait to be asked to
produce. Each should respond to
the need as best he can."
