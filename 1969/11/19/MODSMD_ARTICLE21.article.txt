# Son House Slated
## TMU Hosts Blues 
### TED LORING 
The country blues started a
long time ago, the product of
rural Mississippi in the early part
of the century. Very few of the
artists of country blues remain
alive and performing. Of these,
Son House, practitioner par
excellence of the Mississippi
bottleneck style of the 1920's
stands out as the most important
surviving bluesman who still plays
in the pure Mississippi country
style.
His blues are the vehicle for the
strong emotions of a battered old
man. He talks them out on stage:
"In the blues you got to have a
male and a female and they have
to be in love. One has been
deceived by the other . . .and
that's the blues." He sings them in
a voice worried by the gospel,
"You know the church say lord
have mercy when I die; but I say
lord have mercy 'fore I die. I'm an
old man but I've got young
ideas."
Son began his musical career in
the gospel, he was a preacher. But
the sinful life, the life of the
blues, began to get to him. He
began getting into what he called
bad company, "having a little
nip" of whiskey, and soon he
could no longer live with the
hypocrisy of preaching against a
life he was leading. The gospel was
strong, but the blues were
stronger, "I went into my room,
bow down to pray, but the blues
come along, blowed my spirit
away."
He took to singing the blues in
rural Mississippi recording in
1928, only to have that career
destroyed by the Depression.
During the thirties he played at
parties, for work gangs or
anywhere he could, perfecting
along with Charlie Patton and
Willie Brown, and style of the
bottleneck blues that Robert

Son recorded again in 1942 but
with no great commercial success.
Migrating north to Rochester he
foui J that the church was
stronger than the blues. He 'got
scared and quit,' subsisting on
menial jobs until he was
"rediscovered" in 1964. Since
then he has played at Newport,
Ann Arbor, and recorded a record
for Columbia.

Ain 'I never had 'em, I swear to
God I hope you never will.

The country blues started a
long time ago, the product of
rural Mississippi in the early part
of the century. Very few of the
artists of country blues remain
alive and performing. Of these,
Son House, practitioner par
excellence of the Mississippi
bottleneck style of the 1920's
stands out as the most important
surviving bluesman who still plays
in the pure Mississippi country
style.
His blues are the vehicle for the
strong emotions of a battered old
man. He talks them out on stage:
"In the blues you got to have a
male and a female and they have
to be in love. One has been
deceived by the other . . .and
that's the blues." He sings them in
a voice worried by the gospel,
"You know the church say lord
have mercy when I die; but I say
lord have mercy 'fore I die. I'm an
old man but I've got young
ideas."
Son began his musical career in
the gospel, he was a preacher. But
the sinful life, the life of the
blues, began to get to him. He
began getting into what he called
bad company, "having a little
nip" of whiskey, and soon he
could no longer live with the
hypocrisy of preaching against a
life he was leading. The gospel was
strong, but the blues were
stronger, "I went into my room,
bow down to pray, but the blues
come along, blowed my spirit
away."
He took to singing the blues in
rural Mississippi recording in
1928, only to have that career
destroyed by the Depression.
During the thirties he played at
parties, for work gangs or
anywhere he could, perfecting
along with Charlie Patton and
Willie Brown, and style of the
bottleneck blues that Robert

SON HOUSE, one of the last of
the old-time blues men, will
appear on campus next week.
Johnson took north as the
germinal "Chicago Sound."
Muddy Waters frankly admits his
debt to Son House.
Son recorded again in 1942 but
with no great commercial success.
Migrating north to Rochester he
foui J that the church was
stronger than the blues. He 'got
scared and quit,' subsisting on
menial jobs until he was
"rediscovered" in 1964. Since
then he has played at Newport,
Ann Arbor, and recorded a record
for Columbia.
