# Hike for Peace Hits El Camino
## 
### JOHN COONROD 
Fifty miles is slightly long for a
peace march, but then nothing in
the November Moratorium was
done on a small scale. To a group
of students, professors, wives,
children, and dogs from San Jose
State, taking a bus to the Polo
Grounds would not be as
meaningful as walking.
Which they did. Carrying
banners, Hags, tamborines, packs,
signs, and blister pads, the group
walked the El Camino from San
Jose to San Francisco. The group
of seventy left San Jose Thursday
morning and made it to Stanford
that evening. While the march was
not highly publicized at Stanford,
students here were welcome to
join. So, borrowing a sleeping bag,
grabbing my camera, arm band,
and press card, I entered the
march.
We left El Camino park Friday
morning, with the hope of making
it to Daly City that evening.
Watching several of the marchers
cringe as they walked on
. 'esterday's blisters, I was in doubt
' 112 everyone would reach Atherton.
Our reception along the El
> Camino was what political
analysts call "mixed." Many
people honked horns and waved
peace-signs as we passed; others
could barely contain their fury.
Two young men roared past the
march in a blue Mustang, making
five passes. I believe he yelled
"You Dirty Hippies, Support
Nixon!" although the comma
might not have been in there. One
counter-protesting driver received
shouts of applause when he
screamed that we were "Draft
Dodgers!" A used car salesman
gave thumbs down and said "Sick
Sick"- the words fell out between
cigar puffs.
Students Interview Bystanders
Many bystanders were
requested to give longer
comments on the parade. The
march was organized by a general 112
education course at San Jose
called Tutorials; as a project, some
of the class members recorded the
march on film, video tape, and
tape recorders. Several strdents
interviewed businessmen and
shoppers as we passed. We listened
to the comments during rest
stops. "I'm glad you kids are over
here," one man said in an
interview, "My son went over
there, and he was shot down. I'm
glad you're over here."
The marchers with the sorest
feet stopped that night in San
Mateo to prepare the place where
everyone was to spend the night.
The heartier San Joseans and the
ones like myself who had joined
that day kept walking on San
Bruno and South San Francisco.
We were driven back to San Mateo
to sp the night in an
ecumei. church building, a
mixture gymnasium and
meeting - There was lots of
hot foot ater, coffee, folk
singing i . blister-comparing.
When it grew late, the entire gym
floor became a giant, patchwork
sleeping bag. There were students
who had joined the march off the
sidewalk and hadn't brought
anything. However, when seventy
sleeping bags are joined in one,
there is room for more than
seventy people.
March Grows On Route
Saturday was the day of joy.
The closer we marched to San
Francisco the more exciting
everything seemed. Everyone felt
like Moses approaching the Land.
We walked through the Valley of
Death which is Colma, through

the hills of Daley City, and into
The City.
The band had grown slowly as
it moved up the Peninsula; we
were more than one hundred
when we entered San Francisco.
Inside the city, our number
skyrocketed. The favorite chant
was "All the Way from San Jose,
Peace Now, Join Us, Join Us."
There must have been over a
thousand with us through the
Golden Gate Park. Outside and
onto 21st Avenue there could
have been 5000. At 23rd we left
the sidewalk and filled the street,
15 abreast and six blocks back,
until we met the official march at
30th Avenue.
The San Jose peace walkers
kept their identity in the
hundreds of thousands at the
march and in the Polo Grounds.
Always above the heads of
everyone were the groups San
Jose banners, the red and black
flag of Nonviolent Revolution,
and the western hat of the
march's tall leader, Clark Atakee.
Getting' There Half The Fun
There was applause from parts
of the Polo Grounds crowd when
the San Jose marchers entered.
Someone must have heard how
some San Jose people had
marched, gotten blisters, walked
all day for two and a half days,
lived on a few doughnuts, apples
and heavy raisin bread, and
walked thirteen hours at a time
without seeing a rest room.
Someone must have seen the
man's feet who had gone barefoot
the whole way, or the joy of the
group that had joined arms with
real love and enthusiasm.
The San Jose people did not
join the crowd in front of the
rally stage; most of them did not
hear what was said or see the
speakers. The rally in fact seemed
to several marchers to be an
anti-climax; the real thrill had
been getting there.
