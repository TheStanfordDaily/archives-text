## Joe Kennedy Dies 
### 
HYANNIS PORT, Mass.
(AP)â€”Joseph P. Kennedy, who
amassed one of America's biggest
fortunes, served as ambassador to
Britain and later stepped aside as
his sons took the limelight, died
Tuesday at 81.
Patriarch of a glamorous,
star-crossed clan that included the
35th president of the United
States and two U.S. senators,
Kennedy died of heart failure
after an eight-year illness, his
doctor said.
As is their custom in crisis, the
Kennedys bore their grief
together. At the bedside in the
family compound on Cape Cod
were Kennedy's widow, Rose, and
his sole surviving son, Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
Also present were his daughters
Eunice Shriver, Jean Smith and
Patricia Lawford, as well as
former daughter-in-law Jacqueline
Onassis, Edward's wife Joan and
son-in-law Sargent Shriver, U.S.
ambassador to France.
Unlike four of his nine
children, the elder Kennedy died
quietly. He had been partly
paralyzed since suffering a stroke
in December 1 961.
His latest crisis arose Saturday,
when he suffered what his doctor,
Dr. Robert D. Watt, said was
another stroke. It was thought
originally that the seizure was
another heart attack.
He had been unable to eat for
several days, and his long-time
friend and confidant, Richard
Cardinal Cushing, Roman Catholic
archbishop of Boston, announced
Sunday that death seemed
imminent.
Kennedy grew progressively
weaker in the days that followed,

and slipped into a coma. He was
pronounced dead by Watt at
11:05 a.m. EST Tuesday.
Cardinal Cushing is to celebrate
the Mass Thursday at St. Francis
Xavier's in Hyannis, a small,
unpretentious church the
Kennedys have attended for years.
President Nixon led the nation
in sending tributes and
condolences, saying Kennedy
"inspired his family to share his
own strong sense of dedication to
his nation."
