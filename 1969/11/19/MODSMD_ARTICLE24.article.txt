# Obscene Mail
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)- A
long-haired youth who requested
the Post Office to stop delivering
draft board mail, which he claims
is obscene, got an answer
Tuesday: Nice tryâ€”but no.
A Post Office spokesman said
authorities are not even going to
argue with Robert Blanch, 20, of
San Rafael about the relative
obscenity of a draft notice.
Blanch noted federal law
allowed citizens to refuse mail
advertisements which they
consider sexually provocative. "I
think a letter which orders people
to be trained to kill is obscene,"
he said.
But the Post Office spokesman,
Charles Harper, said the law
specifically states that the
offending mail must offer
something for sale.
"I don't think anyone will
argue that a draft notice is selling
something. It's more like Uncle
Sam wants to borrow something,"
he said.
Blanch, a drama student, took
his pre-induction physical Friday.
