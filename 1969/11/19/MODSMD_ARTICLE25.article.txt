# 'Peace Fellowships' Offered For Research
## 
### 
The establishment of "peace
fellowships" for postdoctoral
research at the Hoover Institution
was announced Monday night by
W. Glenn Campbell, director of
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace.
The fellowships will go to
"highly qualified young scholars
of all nationalities" and will
encourage advanced research
projects on peaceful change, both
domestic and international,
Campbell said at a dinner
commemorating the fiftieth
anniversary of the Institution's
founding.

Campbell also read a message
from President Nixon that praised
the Hoover Institution as "surely
among President Hoover's most
far-sighted contributions to this
nation."
"Built on the conviction that
men cannot forge a successful
future without first learning and
heeding the lessons of the past,
the Hoover Institution has sought
to collect and preserve our
knowledge of history while
applying it to the problems of the
present and hopes for the future,"
the President's message said.
