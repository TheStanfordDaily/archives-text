# Debaters Win Meet
## 
### 
Stanford debaters won three
trophies over the past weekend
(Nov. 14-15) at an invitational
speech tournament at the
University of the Pacific in
Stockton.
In the senior men's division two
teams tied for first place. Ron
Oster, senior from Los Gatos, and
Ken Philpot, senior from
Memphis, Tenn., went undefeated
in the tournament while John
Peterson, senior from Topeka,
Kan.; and Jim Podczerwinski,
senior from Chicago, 111.; finished
with only one loss.
Since the two top-ranked teams
were from the same school, no

championship debate was held to
determine a final winner.
In the junior men's division,
Dan Furniss, freshman from Santa
Clara, and Tom Taffe, freshman
from Sunnyvale, took first place.
Stanford also won first place in
the sweepstakes competition.
Approximately 80 teams from
35 colleges were entered in the
two-day tournament. All debates
were on the proposition,
"Resolved: That the Federal
government should grant a
specific annual percentage of its
income tax revenue to the state
governments."
