# Sponsor Selection Seems Unbiased
## 
### SKIP HARRIS 
(NOTE: An article in
yesterday's DAILY by Skip Harris
concerned the controversial
aspects of the sponsor program.
Today's second part examines the
sponsor selection process.)

Whether freshmen sponsors
fulfill their function or whether
they indeed have a function are
questions that the University
Committee on Extra-Curriculum
will soon discuss. The Committee
will consider all aspects of
residence staffing procedures in its
investigations.
Since sponsors are selected by
students, many have charged that
the selection committee is
susceptible to certain forms of
student bias. If this is the case, it
may justify the removal of the
program from student control by
"The Powers That Be." It is rather
difficult to prove that sponsors
are chosen on the basis of
friendship or political leanings. It
is, however, possible to see if
certain major fields or living
groups are favored or
discriminated against.
The following data was
collected from last year's
applications. We can look at the
information and compare the
characteristics of those who were
chosen against the group as a
whole. In terms of major field:
the largest group applying was
English majors. Of the 28 English
majors who applied, nine were
chosen. The rest of the
information, ranked in order of
size of the group which applied,
follows:
(Major Subject—Percentage of
applicants chosen)
English 34%
History 50%
Political Science 34%
Psychology 23%
Philosophy 50%
Anthropology 57%
Sociology 40%
Biology 40%
Engineering 50%
Mathematics 50%
Physics 0%
In the case of Physics Majors both
applicants were chosen as
alternates.
We can conclude two things
from this information: that no
particular area was subject to bias
last year, and that the program is
in many ways "self-selecting."
This latter point was expressed by
Head Men's Sponsor, Roger
Boesche. Namely very few science
majors are also sponsors but very
few science majors apply. Out of

147 applicants last year, only 14
were from the hard sciences and
math.
Another area we can examine is
the residence histories of the
applicants. In this case the data
from last year does not offer a
conclusive pattern but it does
suggest some irregularities. We can
see that 22 of the 38 men chosen
had lived in fraternities at one
time or another. Of those 22,
more than a fourth were from the
same fraternity (Phi Kappa Psi).
The only way one can really tell
whether any of the applicants ever
lived together is by examining
freshman residences. Again there
is no conclusive pattern. We can,
however, see that applicants from
certain areas had a statistical
advantage.
( Residence — Percent
Chosen—Total No. of Applicants)
Stern—3o%—lo
Roble-23%-23
Branner—s3%—26
Wilbur—47%—73
A rro v o—6 7%—6
Cedro—B6%—7
Junipero—63%—ll
Madera—lB%—ll
Otero—7o%—7
Rinconada—so%—B
Soto —37% —11
Trancos—ls%—l2
Of the total number selected, 86%
were juniors. We may, therefore,
assume that these percentages
indicate students who lived in a
freshman residence at the same
time.
Because of the nature of the
data we can only conclude that
certain groups might have had thy
odds working FOR them. We may
not assume that areas were
discriminated against.
What does all this show? For
one thing it removes some of the
conjecture on which many
opinions are based. For another it
seems to suggest that last year's
selection process was fairly
equitable. From the data it cannot
be assumed that friendship was a
criterion in the selection of
sponsors this year.
The problem now becomes ne
of the worth of the program. If
interested people make their
sentiments known to the
University Committee on
Extra-Curriculum, there is no
reason why the value of the
program cannot now be either
reaffirmed or seriously
questioned. In fact, the vast
changes in Stanford residences in
the last four years almost make
such a re-evaluation necessary.
