# Phi Dells Win
## 
### 
The Phi Delts, led by
quarterback Frank Duffy, picked
apart the Dislocation defense
yesterday to score a 20 6 victory
over the defending champions.
The Phi Delt blocking backs
continually gave Duffy lots of
time to pass the ball, thus giving
him a change to use the long
bombs as well as the short passes
effectively. There were a couple
of drives where he completed as
many as six passes in a row. The
score is not indicative of how well
the Phi Delts moved the ball for
they had two touchdowns called
back because of penalties.
The Phi Delts scored first on a
long bomb to Mark Tucker. A few
minutes later a Phi Delt pass
interference penalty on a long
bomb gave the Dislocations the
ball on the one yard line, and
from there Mike Evans ran the
ball over to make the score 6-6.
Just before the half a long pass to
Fred Storek set up another Phi
Delt touchdown to make the
score 13-6.
The Phi Delts scored one more
time in the second half on a short
pass to Tucker, after a bomb to Hi
Lewis had put the ball inside the
twenty.
The Phi Delts meet the winner
of the Site-Second Year Law
game on Friday at 3:30 for the
championship.
