# Cross Country
## Dead Heat A Fix? 
### FRED LEESON 
The finish of that startling Pac-8 cross country
race Saturday morning, it has been learned, was
rigged.
Not the time or the distance or the team scores,
mind you. just the dead heat tie between WSU's
Gerry Lindgren and amazing Oregon freshman
Steve Prefontaine.
Having led the six miles from start to finish way
ahead of everybody else, the pair came down the
home stretch step for step and both finished in
28:32.4, obliterating the old course record by
1 :14.
Officials gave first place to Lindgren.
Both runners denied a pre-meditated tie ("We
just died together," said diminutive Gerry catching
his breath) but an alert spectator (a dolly, no less)
reported otherwise.
Standing on a turn with a mile left, freshman
Muriel Cyrus heard Prefontaine say, "Do you want
to tie?" and Lindgren gasp back, "I'm not sure I
can make it." He did.
The stunning performance by those two
overshadowed excellent efforts by other runners,
18 of whom bettered the old course record of
29:46, including Stanford's Greg Brock whose
fifth place at 29:08 was the best race of his career.
But it was clearly Lindgren and Prefontaine all
the way in a race called "spectacular" by Indian
Coach Marshall Clark and possibly "the best cross
country meet ever run in the west" by Payton
Jordan, Stanford track coach.
Less than a hundred yards from the start,
Lindgren and Prefontaine were all by themselves.

Landgren gliding into the lead on the downslopes
and Prefontaine taking it on the hills.
They were so fast, in fact, they also broke the
Stanford course record for 4.2 miles while running
a six mile race.
While ties are nothing unusual in dual meets, it
is odd that they would do it when the league title
was being decided. But good friends can do
wonders.
Stanford placed third in team scoring, with Bob
Coe finishing 15th (29:33), Decker Underwood
16th (29 :35), Don Kardong 18th (29:41) and Jack
lawson 32nd (30:27).
Chuck Menz and Arvid Kretz finished 35th and
53rd, Kretz bothered by tendonitis in his hip.
Brock's effort earned him a trip to the NCAA
race next Monday in Brooklyn, New York, where
he won All-America honors last year.
"I like to be careful with words," Coach Clark
said, "but he (Brock) was all the difference in the
world in keeping our team score up where it was."
Clark predicted Brock would probably be in the
top 20 at the national meet, and perhaps in the
first ten.
Freshmen had a good day Saturday, aside from
Prefontaine's marvellous race. VVSU's Mark
Hiefield was sixth, SC's Fred Ritcherson seventh,
and Stanford's Underwood 16th, indicating
strength of the future.
Brook Thomas, former Stanford harrier and
previous course record holder, watched with 200
others as his record was broken by nearly a quarter
of a mile, translating time difference into distance.
"They ran a shorter course," he joked.
