# Staff Examined
## Hoover Personnel: Baised? 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON (second in a series) 
Radical and liberal criticism of
the Hoover Institution has
centered on the alleged right-wing
bias of some of its prominent staff
members. High on the list of
politically unacceptable (to the
critics) personnel are Director
Glenn Campbell and senior fellow
Stefan Possony.
Until recently, senior fellow
Richard Allen was also under
attack. Allen, who served until
last month as an aide to Henry
Kissinger, President Nixon's
foreign policy adviser, probably
won't be around for criticism in
the future. He has accepted a
position in private industry and is
not expected to return to Hoover.
Briefly, Campbell is attacked
for being a Reagan appointee to
the University of California Board
of Regents, a former adviser to
Sen. Barry Goldwater and a past
(or present) supporter or member
of several conservatively-oriented
groups. Campbell's academic
credentials are rather impressive, a
Ph.D. in economics from Harvard
and five years teaching there.
Associations Defended
Campbell vigorously defends
his associations, noting that he
took a leave of absence to work
on Goldwater's campaign. He is
outspoken in maintaining that the
Institution should not be used for

political purposes, though staff
members are free (as are Stanford
faculty members) to devote their
free time to outside activities, or
to take leaves of absence for
public service.
On this last point, Campbell
notes the number of staffers who
have obtained such leaves to work
for the Nixon Administration and
says, "Richard Nixon is President
of the United States. Certain of
our staff have requested leaves
and they have been granted."
The case of Possony is
somewhat different from that of
Campbell. Possony has been
attacked fairly often for being a
polemicist rather than an
objective scholar. Possony was a
witness for South Africa before
the World Court in 1966,
defending that country's
apartheid policy. He is an
outspoken hawk on the Vietnam
war and an opponent of
arms-control agreements. More
importantly, Possony has not
been a particularly prolific scholar
in the years since he joined
Hoover.
Personal Criticisms
The criticisms of Campbell and
Possony should give some idea of
the type of criticism made
concerning Hoover's alleged bias.
Campbell and other observers are
quick to point out that these
criticisms are often of the person's
private life and that in any case
Hoover is not a "right-wing think
tank."
Prominent on anyone's list of
Hoover liberals is Theodore
Draper, author of Abuse of
Power, a work highly critical of
American policy in Vietnam and
Latin America. Draper
acknowledges the support of the
Institution and Director Campbell
in the introduction to the book.
Less well-known than Draper is
Peter Duignan, the head of the
African collection at Hoover. By
all accounts Duignan is far from
the conservative Hoover
stereotype. He has been aiding the
Black Students Union and the
University in the building of an
Afro-American collection in the
Stanford libraries. Duignan is a
Senior Fellow and generally is
considered a liberal.
Quality Work
Balancing off liberals and
conservatives at Hoover proves
nothing, however. In any case,
few would deny that Hoover has a
number of conservatives on its
staff. More important is the
quality of work published under
the auspices of the Institution.
Here Hoover ranks rather highly.
A recent article in The Nation
by a Stanford history instructor,
Peter Stern, said that of some
thirty major Hoover-sponsored
publications in 1962-7 only three
were attacked by reviewers on
"polemical or ideological
grounds." Nineteen received good
or excellent reviews. The range of
subject matter in Hoover
publications is wide, with the vast
majority of publications dealing
with communism in one form or
another but others dealing with
Africa and Nazism.
The staff of Hoover consists of
more than the permanent
researchers and the librarians.

Every year a considerable number
of visiting scholars are in
residence, at the invitation of the
Institution. The facilities of the
Institution are open to all
scholars.
Prominent Visitors
Scholars visiting at the
invitation of Hoover in recent
years include prominent
University of Chicago economist
George Stigler, a conservative.
Other institutions represented
include Harvard, Duke and the
University of Michigan.
At least one possible visiting
scholar won't be at Hoover in the
near future. Arthur Burns, the
newly appointed Chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, was
considering a sojurn at Hoover
when he was offered the new
post.
The Hoover staff, in summary,
would seem to be conservative
politically, but this does not seem
to have affected greatly the
acceptance of their scholarly
research by colleagues. Regarding
the personal political orientation
of his staff, director Campbell
notes that compared to the
political orientation of the
country as a whole the Institution
is "fairly well-balanced." In any
case, Campbell notes that "the
real test is competence and
scholarly quality."
Conferences Held
One of the more interesting
recent developments at Hoover is
the sponsorship of occasional
conferences. Two years ago the
Institution commemerated the
fiftieth anniversary of the Russian
Revolution with a conference
reviewing the achievements of
Soviet Russia. The Conference
was well-received and featured
scholars from all over the United
States as well as several foreign
countries.
The conference this week
marking Hoover's fiftieth
anniversary has drawn a
distinguished attendance and
another conference is being

considered for next year, on the
25th anniversary of the founding
of the United Nations. The
Hoover staff took the initiative in
setting up the conferences, though
understandably most of the
speakers were from other
universities.

The criticisms of Campbell and
Possony should give some idea of
the type of criticism made
concerning Hoover's alleged bias.
Campbell and other observers are
quick to point out that these
criticisms are often of the person's
private life and that in any case
Hoover is not a "right-wing think
tank."
Prominent on anyone's list of
Hoover liberals is Theodore
Draper, author of Abuse of
Power, a work highly critical of
American policy in Vietnam and
Latin America. Draper
acknowledges the support of the
Institution and Director Campbell
in the introduction to the book.
Less well-known than Draper is
Peter Duignan, the head of the
African collection at Hoover. By
all accounts Duignan is far from
the conservative Hoover
stereotype. He has been aiding the
Black Students Union and the
University in the building of an
Afro-American collection in the
Stanford libraries. Duignan is a
Senior Fellow and generally is
considered a liberal.
Quality Work
Balancing off liberals and
conservatives at Hoover proves
nothing, however. In any case,
few would deny that Hoover has a
number of conservatives on its
staff. More important is the
quality of work published under
the auspices of the Institution.
Here Hoover ranks rather highly.
A recent article in The Nation
by a Stanford history instructor,
Peter Stern, said that of some
thirty major Hoover-sponsored
publications in 1962-7 only three
were attacked by reviewers on
"polemical or ideological
grounds." Nineteen received good
or excellent reviews. The range of
subject matter in Hoover
publications is wide, with the vast
majority of publications dealing
with communism in one form or
another but others dealing with
Africa and Nazism.
The staff of Hoover consists of
more than the permanent
researchers and the librarians.

Every year a considerable number
of visiting scholars are in
residence, at the invitation of the
Institution. The facilities of the
Institution are open to all
scholars.
Prominent Visitors
Scholars visiting at the
invitation of Hoover in recent
years include prominent
University of Chicago economist
George Stigler, a conservative.
Other institutions represented
include Harvard, Duke and the
University of Michigan.
At least one possible visiting
scholar won't be at Hoover in the
near future. Arthur Burns, the
newly appointed Chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, was
considering a sojurn at Hoover
when he was offered the new
post.
The Hoover staff, in summary,
would seem to be conservative
politically, but this does not seem
to have affected greatly the
acceptance of their scholarly
research by colleagues. Regarding
the personal political orientation
of his staff, director Campbell
notes that compared to the
political orientation of the
country as a whole the Institution
is "fairly well-balanced." In any
case, Campbell notes that "the
real test is competence and
scholarly quality."
Conferences Held
One of the more interesting
recent developments at Hoover is
the sponsorship of occasional
conferences. Two years ago the
Institution commemerated the
fiftieth anniversary of the Russian
Revolution with a conference
reviewing the achievements of
Soviet Russia. The Conference
was well-received and featured
scholars from all over the United
States as well as several foreign
countries.
The conference this week
marking Hoover's fiftieth
anniversary has drawn a
distinguished attendance and
another conference is being

considered for next year, on the
25th anniversary of the founding
of the United Nations. The
Hoover staff took the initiative in
setting up the conferences, though
understandably most of the
speakers were from other
universities.


ARENA DEFENDED â€”ARENA writer Roger Reed defended his
article attacking the ASSU Senate in a debate with members of the
Black Student Union (BSU) yesterday afternoon. Reed maintained his
allegation that the Senate, with many radical and black members, is
unrepresentative.
Radical and liberal criticism of
the Hoover Institution has
centered on the alleged right-wing
bias of some of its prominent staff
members. High on the list of
politically unacceptable (to the
critics) personnel are Director
Glenn Campbell and senior fellow
Stefan Possony.
Until recently, senior fellow
Richard Allen was also under
attack. Allen, who served until
last month as an aide to Henry
Kissinger, President Nixon's
foreign policy adviser, probably
won't be around for criticism in
the future. He has accepted a
position in private industry and is
not expected to return to Hoover.
Briefly, Campbell is attacked
for being a Reagan appointee to
the University of California Board
of Regents, a former adviser to
Sen. Barry Goldwater and a past
(or present) supporter or member
of several conservatively-oriented
groups. Campbell's academic
credentials are rather impressive, a
Ph.D. in economics from Harvard
and five years teaching there.
Associations Defended
Campbell vigorously defends
his associations, noting that he
took a leave of absence to work
on Goldwater's campaign. He is
outspoken in maintaining that the
Institution should not be used for

political purposes, though staff
members are free (as are Stanford
faculty members) to devote their
free time to outside activities, or
to take leaves of absence for
public service.
On this last point, Campbell
notes the number of staffers who
have obtained such leaves to work
for the Nixon Administration and
says, "Richard Nixon is President
of the United States. Certain of
our staff have requested leaves
and they have been granted."
The case of Possony is
somewhat different from that of
Campbell. Possony has been
attacked fairly often for being a
polemicist rather than an
objective scholar. Possony was a
witness for South Africa before
the World Court in 1966,
defending that country's
apartheid policy. He is an
outspoken hawk on the Vietnam
war and an opponent of
arms-control agreements. More
importantly, Possony has not
been a particularly prolific scholar
in the years since he joined
Hoover.

scholar won't be at Hoover in the
near future. Arthur Burns, the
newly appointed Chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, was
considering a sojurn at Hoover
when he was offered the new
post.
The Hoover staff, in summary,
would seem to be conservative
politically, but this does not seem
to have affected greatly the
acceptance of their scholarly
research by colleagues. Regarding
the personal political orientation
of his staff, director Campbell
notes that compared to the
political orientation of the
country as a whole the Institution
is "fairly well-balanced." In any
case, Campbell notes that "the
real test is competence and
scholarly quality."
Conferences Held
One of the more interesting
recent developments at Hoover is
the sponsorship of occasional
conferences. Two years ago the
Institution commemerated the
fiftieth anniversary of the Russian
Revolution with a conference
reviewing the achievements of
Soviet Russia. The Conference
was well-received and featured
scholars from all over the United
States as well as several foreign
countries.
The conference this week
marking Hoover's fiftieth
anniversary has drawn a
distinguished attendance and
another conference is being

considered for next year, on the
25th anniversary of the founding
of the United Nations. The
Hoover staff took the initiative in
setting up the conferences, though
understandably most of the
speakers were from other
universities.


ARENA DEFENDED â€”ARENA writer Roger Reed defended his
article attacking the ASSU Senate in a debate with members of the
Black Student Union (BSU) yesterday afternoon. Reed maintained his
allegation that the Senate, with many radical and black members, is
unrepresentative.
Radical and liberal criticism of
the Hoover Institution has
centered on the alleged right-wing
bias of some of its prominent staff
members. High on the list of
politically unacceptable (to the
critics) personnel are Director
Glenn Campbell and senior fellow
Stefan Possony.
Until recently, senior fellow
Richard Allen was also under
attack. Allen, who served until
last month as an aide to Henry
Kissinger, President Nixon's
foreign policy adviser, probably
won't be around for criticism in
the future. He has accepted a
position in private industry and is
not expected to return to Hoover.
Briefly, Campbell is attacked
for being a Reagan appointee to
the University of California Board
of Regents, a former adviser to
Sen. Barry Goldwater and a past
(or present) supporter or member
of several conservatively-oriented
groups. Campbell's academic
credentials are rather impressive, a
Ph.D. in economics from Harvard
and five years teaching there.
Associations Defended
Campbell vigorously defends
his associations, noting that he
took a leave of absence to work
on Goldwater's campaign. He is
outspoken in maintaining that the
Institution should not be used for

political purposes, though staff
members are free (as are Stanford
faculty members) to devote their
free time to outside activities, or
to take leaves of absence for
public service.
On this last point, Campbell
notes the number of staffers who
have obtained such leaves to work
for the Nixon Administration and
says, "Richard Nixon is President
of the United States. Certain of
our staff have requested leaves
and they have been granted."
The case of Possony is
somewhat different from that of
Campbell. Possony has been
attacked fairly often for being a
polemicist rather than an
objective scholar. Possony was a
witness for South Africa before
the World Court in 1966,
defending that country's
apartheid policy. He is an
outspoken hawk on the Vietnam
war and an opponent of
arms-control agreements. More
importantly, Possony has not
been a particularly prolific scholar
in the years since he joined
Hoover.
Personal Criticisms
The criticisms of Campbell and
Possony should give some idea of
the type of criticism made
concerning Hoover's alleged bias.
Campbell and other observers are
quick to point out that these
criticisms are often of the person's
private life and that in any case
Hoover is not a "right-wing think
tank."
Prominent on anyone's list of
Hoover liberals is Theodore
Draper, author of Abuse of
Power, a work highly critical of
American policy in Vietnam and
Latin America. Draper
acknowledges the support of the
Institution and Director Campbell
in the introduction to the book.
Less well-known than Draper is
Peter Duignan, the head of the
African collection at Hoover. By
all accounts Duignan is far from
the conservative Hoover
stereotype. He has been aiding the
Black Students Union and the
University in the building of an
Afro-American collection in the
Stanford libraries. Duignan is a
Senior Fellow and generally is
considered a liberal.
Quality Work
Balancing off liberals and
conservatives at Hoover proves
nothing, however. In any case,
few would deny that Hoover has a
number of conservatives on its
staff. More important is the
quality of work published under
the auspices of the Institution.
Here Hoover ranks rather highly.
A recent article in The Nation
by a Stanford history instructor,
Peter Stern, said that of some
thirty major Hoover-sponsored
publications in 1962-7 only three
were attacked by reviewers on
"polemical or ideological
grounds." Nineteen received good
or excellent reviews. The range of
subject matter in Hoover
publications is wide, with the vast
majority of publications dealing
with communism in one form or
another but others dealing with
Africa and Nazism.
The staff of Hoover consists of
more than the permanent
researchers and the librarians.

Every year a considerable number
of visiting scholars are in
residence, at the invitation of the
Institution. The facilities of the
Institution are open to all
scholars.
Prominent Visitors
Scholars visiting at the
invitation of Hoover in recent
years include prominent
University of Chicago economist
George Stigler, a conservative.
Other institutions represented
include Harvard, Duke and the
University of Michigan.
At least one possible visiting
scholar won't be at Hoover in the
near future. Arthur Burns, the
newly appointed Chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, was
considering a sojurn at Hoover
