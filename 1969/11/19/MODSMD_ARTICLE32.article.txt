# The 						Bull Pen
## Fan-fare 
### Fred Mann 
Saturday's Moratorium marches across the country gathered
hundreds of thousands of people who opposed violence, and the
strength of the military, and united them in their quest for a victory
for their side. They felt their views on the battle to be right, those of
the Pentagon to be wrong, and they huddled in the chilly afternoon air
to voice their opinion.
Thousands from the Stanford community alone trekked to the
fields of the San Francisco Polo Grounds to show their support. Yet
41,500 more from the same area unknowingly did their part in yet
another way.
Stanford football fans cheered wildly as the United States Air
Force Academy was thoroughly beaten by the Indians.
At least under the controlled conditions of Stanford Stadium, the
Air Force was powerless. They had never seen aerial bombs like those
of Jim Plunkett.
The intellectual community was in control.
The Stanford partisans screeched with delight while the goals of
the Moratorium were achieved in the football morality play staged
below them.
The red shirts were good, the military evil, and the Air Force went
down to defeat in their attempted war. Moreover, the violence
stopped on a whistle.
Yet, overall, it was still just a football game. The fantasies on the
minds and lips of so many in the skident rooting section of outgunning
the soliders on Moratorium Day were still just that -a fantasy.
What kind of people pick a football game over a protest march?
On the Stanford side, it was the same faces that always show up.
There were the freshman dorm contingents, ably quarterbacking every
play, and the fraternity brothers loudly enjoying their beer and
gleefully making certain that they were as much the center of
attention as the game on the field.
Also came the freshman dollies (knowing only the penalty for
illegal holding) with their All-American dates. Finally, the band,
enjoying their roles of musical jesters and public freaks of the football
season.
On the enemy side however, it was not just like an average
Saturday at the stadium. But the Moratorium had nothing to do with
it.
The opposition was far different from any other ever seen by
Stanford rooters. There were no dancing pom-pon girls like Oregon
had, or no insanely hyperactive student section like UCLA formed.
Instead, uniformed cadets bellowed restrained encouragement to
their fellow fighting men on the field.
The cheers were limited to four oft-repeated chants that got staler
every time, but the level of support never fell. Each man followed the
orders of the five drill-instructing cheerleaders and kept up the same
verbal attack on Stanford whether their team was ahead or far behind.
It came off like a good high school cheering section, except of
course for the uniforms and the machine gun operators (dressed in
combat fatigues) who fired their mounted weapon on every Air Force
score.
The yell leaders wore letterman's sweaters, saddle shoes, and
crew-cuts, and cheered on every play. The cadets had no time for
extra-curricular activities. They watched the action on the field as if a
quiz were to be given any second.
Meanwhile, across the field, the frats continued to drink, and the
band thought up dirty cheers.
Above the Air Force section, a score of writers sat smoking too
much, and complaining that they were not in the TV end of sports,
"where the money is."
Those working for the big papers sat easily at the center of the
press-box, joking, and going for a hot dog whenever the urge struck
them.
Those struggling with a smaller outfit or looking for a needed raise
found themselves at the 30-yard line, keeping their own statistics.
Fully a month late, they still searched for that "blue-gray Ottober
sky" that had been so successful for Grantland Rice 45 years ago.
When Stanford first scored, the sun came out from behind the
clouds, and at least a handful of writers had their leads.
A Stanford Daily staffer walked in weaing a black armband, to the
chagrin of some sports writers, the indifference of others.
Down below, the officiated battle raged on, and the home team
won again. The cadets took the defeat as if it were a disgrace. The
zealous cheerleaders sat for minutes with their heads bowed. Stanford
students began leaving in the third quarter.
Up in the box, writers typed tirelessly, their job just beginning. By
the time the story was complete, the field was dark, and the stadium
empty. To 41,500 people, the battle was over. To millions more, it
was still going on.
