### JOHN ARTHUR 
Cliches and awards flowed freely yesterday as
Stanford and Cal continued to prepare for
Saturday's Big Game in Stanford Stadium. There
were a lot of developments on both the local and
national football scenes and as usual, the Tribe was
honored on the former and shafted on the latter.
Among the interesting items:
—Jim Plunkett and Don Parish were named
player of the year award winners by the Northern
California Football Writers Association.
Quarterback Plunkett has already set three Pac-8
single season records this fall and needs 11 more
completions and 54 more passing yards to break
two records belonging to Craig Morton, who
played for Cal from 1962-4. Co-captain Parish,
chosen as top lineman by the writers, has been in
on 128 tackles thus far this season.
—Stanford was listed as a two touchdown
favorite over Cal in Saturday's game, despite the
fact that both coaches were talking as if imminent
disaster were at hand. John Ralston said he
"anticipated a real all-out battle" and reminded his
listeners that the favorites have been beaten four
times in the last six years. Cal coach Ray Willsey
said he thought Stanford was "one of the finest
football teams in the United States."
-This was an opinion not widely shared by
coaches and writers around the country: the Tribe
dropped to 14th in both national wire service polls
released yesterday. The polls, as baffling as ever,
put Stanford far behind a team which it tied
(UCLA) and a team to which it lost by two points
(USC) but ahead of a team to which it lost
(Purdue). The only certainty about the polls

appears to be that The Indians won't end up in the
top ten.
- Stanford coach Ralston, already basking in
the tenuous glory of his best season to date, was
named to coach the West team in the 45th annual
East-West Shrine classic. The game will be played
Dec. 27 in Stanford Stadium. Ralston replaced
USC coach John McKay as coach (if the West team
when McKay asked to be relieved of the job due to
the pressures of his own season.
- Those particular pressures will be acute this
Saturday afternoon in Los Angeles when McKay's
Trojans face Tommy Prothro's UCLA Bruins in a
nationally televised contest. The winner of the
game will go to the Rose Bowl and SC goes in the
event of a tie. If so, it will be an unprecedented
fourth straight trip to Pasadena for the Trojans,
who go into the game leading the Pac-8 in defense.
Most observers feel that the game will wind up
a struggle between UCLA's high-scoring offense,
led by quarterback Dennis Dummit and running
backs Greg Jones and Mickey Cureton, and USC's
stingy defense. The Trojans, who have been living
dangerously for the past season, have been rated
two-point underdogs. A near-capacity crowd is
expected in the L.A. Coliseum for the 3:05 p.m.
game.
—A respectable gathering is also expected here
Saturday afternoon. Stanford ticket manager Ted
Glarrow says "We're enjoying the best Big Game
ticket sale in more than ten years." and he expects
"well over 70,000" for the game. But Glarrow
emphasized that the 1:30 p.m. contest is not a
sellout. A crowd near 80,000 could make the 1969
a record vear for Stanford football attendance.

top ten.
- Stanford coach Ralston, already basking in
the tenuous glory of his best season to date, was
named to coach the West team in the 45th annual
East-West Shrine classic. The game will be played
Dec. 27 in Stanford Stadium. Ralston replaced
USC coach John McKay as coach (if the West team
when McKay asked to be relieved of the job due to
the pressures of his own season.
- Those particular pressures will be acute this
Saturday afternoon in Los Angeles when McKay's
Trojans face Tommy Prothro's UCLA Bruins in a
nationally televised contest. The winner of the
game will go to the Rose Bowl and SC goes in the
event of a tie. If so, it will be an unprecedented
fourth straight trip to Pasadena for the Trojans,
who go into the game leading the Pac-8 in defense.
Most observers feel that the game will wind up
a struggle between UCLA's high-scoring offense,
led by quarterback Dennis Dummit and running
backs Greg Jones and Mickey Cureton, and USC's
stingy defense. The Trojans, who have been living
dangerously for the past season, have been rated
two-point underdogs. A near-capacity crowd is
expected in the L.A. Coliseum for the 3:05 p.m.
game.
—A respectable gathering is also expected here
Saturday afternoon. Stanford ticket manager Ted
Glarrow says "We're enjoying the best Big Game
ticket sale in more than ten years." and he expects
"well over 70,000" for the game. But Glarrow
emphasized that the 1:30 p.m. contest is not a
sellout. A crowd near 80,000 could make the 1969
a record vear for Stanford football attendance.
Cliches and awards flowed freely yesterday as
Stanford and Cal continued to prepare for
Saturday's Big Game in Stanford Stadium. There
were a lot of developments on both the local and
national football scenes and as usual, the Tribe was
honored on the former and shafted on the latter.
Among the interesting items:
—Jim Plunkett and Don Parish were named
player of the year award winners by the Northern
California Football Writers Association.
Quarterback Plunkett has already set three Pac-8
single season records this fall and needs 11 more
completions and 54 more passing yards to break
two records belonging to Craig Morton, who
played for Cal from 1962-4. Co-captain Parish,
chosen as top lineman by the writers, has been in
on 128 tackles thus far this season.
—Stanford was listed as a two touchdown
favorite over Cal in Saturday's game, despite the
fact that both coaches were talking as if imminent
disaster were at hand. John Ralston said he
"anticipated a real all-out battle" and reminded his
listeners that the favorites have been beaten four
times in the last six years. Cal coach Ray Willsey
said he thought Stanford was "one of the finest
football teams in the United States."
-This was an opinion not widely shared by
coaches and writers around the country: the Tribe
dropped to 14th in both national wire service polls
released yesterday. The polls, as baffling as ever,
put Stanford far behind a team which it tied
(UCLA) and a team to which it lost by two points
(USC) but ahead of a team to which it lost
(Purdue). The only certainty about the polls

appears to be that The Indians won't end up in the
top ten.
