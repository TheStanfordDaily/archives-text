# BSU Attacks Arena Over Racism Charges
## 
### JIM PERLOFF 
Harvey Hukari yesterday called
for a constitutional amendment
making the ASSU a voluntary
association by making dues
optional.
The ARENA editor made the
plea while defending last
Thursday's article in the ARENA
which claimed the student Senate
is unrepresentative and ruled by a
coalition of black and white
radicals.
Hukari participated in a debate
with Black Student Union (BSU)
co-chairman Leo Bazile and ASSU
Senate Chairman and BSU
coordinator Dave Edwards.
The BSU arranged the debate
to refute what they considered
racist charges in the article. Roger
Reed, the author of the article,
was there with Hukari to defend
it.
Senate Unrepresentative
Edwards attacked the articles,
charge that the Senate is
unrepresentative because eight of
its 40 members are black. "Since
when is color a criteria for
representatives? When black
students win using rules set up by
white people, it's called a
mockery.

"If this is a mockery, then you
must take steps to rectify the
situation by excluding blacks
from running," he said.
Bazile defended the heavy
representation of blacks in the
Senate saying "Last year we raised
a lot of hell on this campus,
including some things that people
didn't like: they said that we
should use legitimate channels.
"White folks don't dig niggers
as serious: now that we've gotten
into the Senate the same people
attack our words as harsh. If you
can't act in a harsh manner and
you can't talk in a harsh manner,
what the hell can you do?
Playing By White Rules
"I want every black here to
remember this lesson: when you
start playing by the whites' rules,
then the whites try and change
the rules.
"They're screaming about
power politics because they're
losing."
Hukari and Reed replied that
the article was not an attack on
blacks but rather the Senate
structure and the ASSU. "I urged
making the ASSU voluntary
during a pre-Reg week speech,
before we even knew that the
BSU would be running a slate,"
Hukari said.
Quoting a BSU statement
issued last week which said "When
black people are drawn in harm's
way, we as black people must take
the initiative to insure our own
survival," Hukari attacked what
he considered to be intimidation
of his publication.
Threat Of Intimidation
"The article was a factually
honest, legitimate expression of
(Reed's) views. I will defend its
publication. I reject categorically
what I consider the threat of
intimidation in this statement."

Reed said "I am not
categorizing anyone because they
are black. I attacked the Senate,
not the BSU. I did not attack the
BSU for playing power politics. I
attacked the Senate which allows
power politics, absurd little power
plays, dividing up the booty."
Reed also charged Edwards
with denying he draws salary from
the BSU and also with loading
Senate committees with blacks.
Senate committees are chosen by
the chairman, with the Senate
having no veto power over the
selections.
Edwards angrily replied that he
draws no salary, though LASSU
had authorized the BSU to pay
coordinators. He and Bazile defied
Reed to produce any vouchers
showing Edwards had drawn the
authorized salary.
Too Many Blacks
As to the charge that he
appoints too many blacks to
committees, Edwards said "I'm
going to do everything in my
power to help my black brothers
and sisters, including railroading
and appointing blacks to
committees, as long as they are in
poverty."
He then attacked Reed, saying
that at least he was willing to
admit that he had a bias.
Reed also hit at the BSU's
campaign for the Senate charging
it with intimidation. He quoted
the BSU's statement that it was
prepared to use "abnormal
channels" to further goals. Reed
contended that this implied
violence.
Bazile replied that Reed just
inferred violence from the
statement. "There are many
abnormal channels used daily: the
Moratorium, demands on
President Pitzer," Edwards
declared.

intimidation in this statement."

Reed said "I am not
categorizing anyone because they
are black. I attacked the Senate,
not the BSU. I did not attack the
BSU for playing power politics. I
attacked the Senate which allows
power politics, absurd little power
plays, dividing up the booty."
Reed also charged Edwards
with denying he draws salary from
the BSU and also with loading
Senate committees with blacks.
Senate committees are chosen by
the chairman, with the Senate
having no veto power over the
selections.
Edwards angrily replied that he
draws no salary, though LASSU
had authorized the BSU to pay
coordinators. He and Bazile defied
Reed to produce any vouchers
showing Edwards had drawn the
authorized salary.
Too Many Blacks
As to the charge that he
appoints too many blacks to
committees, Edwards said "I'm
going to do everything in my
power to help my black brothers
and sisters, including railroading
and appointing blacks to
committees, as long as they are in
poverty."
He then attacked Reed, saying
that at least he was willing to
admit that he had a bias.
Reed also hit at the BSU's
campaign for the Senate charging
it with intimidation. He quoted
the BSU's statement that it was
prepared to use "abnormal
channels" to further goals. Reed
contended that this implied
violence.
Bazile replied that Reed just
inferred violence from the
statement. "There are many
abnormal channels used daily: the
Moratorium, demands on
President Pitzer," Edwards
declared.
Harvey Hukari yesterday called
for a constitutional amendment
making the ASSU a voluntary
association by making dues
optional.
The ARENA editor made the
plea while defending last
Thursday's article in the ARENA
which claimed the student Senate
is unrepresentative and ruled by a
coalition of black and white
radicals.
Hukari participated in a debate
with Black Student Union (BSU)
co-chairman Leo Bazile and ASSU
Senate Chairman and BSU
coordinator Dave Edwards.
The BSU arranged the debate
to refute what they considered
racist charges in the article. Roger
Reed, the author of the article,
was there with Hukari to defend
it.
Senate Unrepresentative
Edwards attacked the articles,
charge that the Senate is
unrepresentative because eight of
its 40 members are black. "Since
when is color a criteria for
representatives? When black
students win using rules set up by
white people, it's called a
mockery.

"If this is a mockery, then you
must take steps to rectify the
situation by excluding blacks
from running," he said.
Bazile defended the heavy
representation of blacks in the
Senate saying "Last year we raised
a lot of hell on this campus,
including some things that people
didn't like: they said that we
should use legitimate channels.
"White folks don't dig niggers
as serious: now that we've gotten
into the Senate the same people
attack our words as harsh. If you
can't act in a harsh manner and
you can't talk in a harsh manner,
what the hell can you do?
Playing By White Rules
"I want every black here to
remember this lesson: when you
start playing by the whites' rules,
then the whites try and change
the rules.
"They're screaming about
power politics because they're
losing."
Hukari and Reed replied that
the article was not an attack on
blacks but rather the Senate
structure and the ASSU. "I urged
making the ASSU voluntary
during a pre-Reg week speech,
before we even knew that the
BSU would be running a slate,"
Hukari said.
Quoting a BSU statement
issued last week which said "When
black people are drawn in harm's
way, we as black people must take
the initiative to insure our own
survival," Hukari attacked what
he considered to be intimidation
of his publication.
Threat Of Intimidation
"The article was a factually
honest, legitimate expression of
(Reed's) views. I will defend its
publication. I reject categorically
what I consider the threat of
intimidation in this statement."

Reed said "I am not
categorizing anyone because they
are black. I attacked the Senate,
