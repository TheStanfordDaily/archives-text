# Inter-Galactic Roundup
## Landing Successful 
### 
SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP)—Two gleeful Americans
landed on the moon's Ocean of
Storms Wednesday, the third and
fourth humans to visit that
craggy, hostile world, their sheer
joy and laughter in stark contrast
with their dead surroundings.
The moonship Intrepid,
carrying Charles Conrad Jr. and
Alan L. Bean, touched down
almost right on target on the lunar
surface at 1:54 a.m. EST.
"Outstanding!" shouted
Conrad in glee. "Beautiful!"
"Man," he said excitedly. "I
can't wait to get outside. Look at
that."
"Look at those boulders over
there," said Bean. "This is a nice
place."
Mission Control said the
landing looked like it was almost
right on the button. It wasn't
right where Conrad wanted it, but
it was close. They placed Intrepid
at a spot some 1,000 feet from
the Surveyor spacecraft that
landed there 2 X A years ago. They
hope to visit that old spaceship on
one of two moon walks and bring
pieces of it back to earth.
Their voices were a babble of
happiness in the minutes after
landing.
"Holy cow," Conrad
exclaimed. "It's beautiful down
here."

Soaring out of sight some 65
miles above and beyond was
astronaut Richard F. Gordon Jr.
in the mothership Yankee Clipper
on lonely patrol around the moon
for the 31V2 hours Conrad and
Bean will be on the moon.
The scene that greeted the
astronauts was the shadowed
effect of the lunar dawn. The sun
slanted in low from the west,
painting a long black caricature of
Intrepid's spidery shape on the
lunar surface.
"I think we're in a place that's
a lot dustier than Neil's,"Conrad
said, referring to the landing place
where Neil Armstrong and Edwin
E. Aldrin Jr. set down Apollo 11 's
Eagle last July.
"It's a good thing we flew high
and then sat down," he added,
"because I couldn't see after all
that dust came up."
The last ten minutes of the
descent to the lunar surface were
tense, and the astronauts were
practically giddy with excitement.
On the way down, Conrad told
Mission Control, "I sure hope you
have us lined up right . . .because
there's a whole bunch of
mountains in front of us right
now. I hope we go down the
middle. There's one valley."
He was chuckling all the time.
The dramatic sequence of
events Tuesday leading to landing
began at 7:02 p.m. EST when
Bean entered the Intrepid, then
still docked with the Yankee
Clipper. By 7:52 p.m., both he
and Conrad were snugly inside.
Then, at 11:16 p.m., latches
binding both craft together
released, and compressed gas blew
Intrepid slowly away, framed in
the Clipper's television cameras
beaming to earth.
Thirty-one minutes later,
Gordon powered up the Clipper's
rocked engine and moved safely
2'/ 2 miles away to give the
moonship maneuvering room.
"Bye bye," said Conrad in
Intrepid. "See you, troops,"said
Gordon in the Clipper.
At 12:19 a.m. Wednesday,
Intrepid disappeared behind the
moon. Conrad and Bean fired
their descent engine to begin the
long looping drop to the lunar
surface.
Twelve minutes to touchdown
the descent engine fired again.
They arced down some 49,000
feet, cutting their 3,790 miles an
hour to a nearly dead stop 12 feet
above the surface.
Then they landed.
The day began somewhat awry.
Conrad complained of a weeping

sore on his chest. Bean had a
stuffy nose, and there were
reports of a moderate storm from
the surface of the sun.
The sore on Conrad's chest was
apparently caused by a sensitivity
to the jelly used to fix medical
sensors to his skin. Bean's stuffy
nose was apparently an allergy to
dust or something in the
spacecraft. He controlled it with
decongestant tablets and nasal
spray.
But Conrad didn't Want anyone
to think the problems were
serious.
"A 1 doesn't have a cold," he
said "and I have an inch itch. We
don't have any medical problems.
We're in pretty damned good
shape."

SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP)—Two gleeful Americans
landed on the moon's Ocean of
Storms Wednesday, the third and
fourth humans to visit that
craggy, hostile world, their sheer
joy and laughter in stark contrast
with their dead surroundings.
The moonship Intrepid,
carrying Charles Conrad Jr. and
Alan L. Bean, touched down
almost right on target on the lunar
surface at 1:54 a.m. EST.
"Outstanding!" shouted
Conrad in glee. "Beautiful!"
"Man," he said excitedly. "I
can't wait to get outside. Look at
that."
"Look at those boulders over
there," said Bean. "This is a nice
place."
Mission Control said the
landing looked like it was almost
right on the button. It wasn't
right where Conrad wanted it, but
it was close. They placed Intrepid
at a spot some 1,000 feet from
the Surveyor spacecraft that
landed there 2 X A years ago. They
hope to visit that old spaceship on
one of two moon walks and bring
pieces of it back to earth.
Their voices were a babble of
happiness in the minutes after
landing.
"Holy cow," Conrad
exclaimed. "It's beautiful down
here."

Soaring out of sight some 65
miles above and beyond was
astronaut Richard F. Gordon Jr.
in the mothership Yankee Clipper
on lonely patrol around the moon
for the 31V2 hours Conrad and
Bean will be on the moon.
The scene that greeted the
astronauts was the shadowed
effect of the lunar dawn. The sun
slanted in low from the west,
painting a long black caricature of
Intrepid's spidery shape on the
lunar surface.
"I think we're in a place that's
a lot dustier than Neil's,"Conrad
said, referring to the landing place
where Neil Armstrong and Edwin
E. Aldrin Jr. set down Apollo 11 's
Eagle last July.
"It's a good thing we flew high
and then sat down," he added,
"because I couldn't see after all
that dust came up."
The last ten minutes of the
descent to the lunar surface were
tense, and the astronauts were
practically giddy with excitement.
On the way down, Conrad told
Mission Control, "I sure hope you
have us lined up right . . .because
there's a whole bunch of
mountains in front of us right
now. I hope we go down the
middle. There's one valley."
He was chuckling all the time.
The dramatic sequence of
events Tuesday leading to landing
began at 7:02 p.m. EST when
Bean entered the Intrepid, then
still docked with the Yankee
Clipper. By 7:52 p.m., both he
and Conrad were snugly inside.
Then, at 11:16 p.m., latches
binding both craft together
released, and compressed gas blew
Intrepid slowly away, framed in
the Clipper's television cameras
beaming to earth.
Thirty-one minutes later,
Gordon powered up the Clipper's
rocked engine and moved safely
2'/ 2 miles away to give the
moonship maneuvering room.
"Bye bye," said Conrad in
Intrepid. "See you, troops,"said
Gordon in the Clipper.
At 12:19 a.m. Wednesday,
Intrepid disappeared behind the
moon. Conrad and Bean fired
their descent engine to begin the
long looping drop to the lunar
surface.
Twelve minutes to touchdown
the descent engine fired again.
They arced down some 49,000
feet, cutting their 3,790 miles an
hour to a nearly dead stop 12 feet
above the surface.
Then they landed.
The day began somewhat awry.
Conrad complained of a weeping

sore on his chest. Bean had a
stuffy nose, and there were
reports of a moderate storm from
the surface of the sun.
The sore on Conrad's chest was
apparently caused by a sensitivity
to the jelly used to fix medical
sensors to his skin. Bean's stuffy
nose was apparently an allergy to
dust or something in the
spacecraft. He controlled it with
decongestant tablets and nasal
spray.
But Conrad didn't Want anyone
to think the problems were
serious.
"A 1 doesn't have a cold," he
said "and I have an inch itch. We
don't have any medical problems.
We're in pretty damned good
shape."
