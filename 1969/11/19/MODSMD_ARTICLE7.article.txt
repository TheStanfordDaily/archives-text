WASHINGTON
(AP)—Secretary of State William
P. Rogers reported Tuesday that
"numerous diplomatic contacts"
with North Vietnam, some since
Ho Chi Minh's death in
September, have failed to produce
any progress toward a Vietnam
settlement.
The secretary of state gave
members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee a generally
gloomy appraisal of U.S.
diplomatic efforts, but told
reporters he hopes President
Nixon's Nov. 3 speech will lead
the North Vietnamese to enter
into serious peace talks.
"We see no immediate prospect
for success in the negotiations,"
the secretary said.
Although Sen. Albert Gore,
D-Tenn., saw some grounds for
optimism in the secret contacts,
both in Paris and through third
parties, other committee members
said nothing raised during the
3Vi-hour session gave them
encouragement about an early end
to he war.
But several, including Chairman
J.W. Fulbright, D-Ark., and Sen.
Frank Church, D-Idaho, saw some
hope in what they viewed as an
irreversible trend towards U.S.
withdrawal from Vietnam.
Church said President Nixon's
program "is not a formula for
getting the United States
completely out but rather a plan
for keeping us indefinitely in."
Fulbright, asked if the United
States is on an irreversible course
of withdrawal, replied "I rather
think so." And he added "This
could be verv long drawn out."
