## Help Nairobi 
### 
The Moratorium with its candlelight marches, door to
door canvassing, and huge parades is over until next month.
But many other less dramatic projects still continue. One of
them, the Nairobi Book Drive, needs the support of all
students, faculty, administration and employees at
Stanford.
The book drive's aims are modest: to help provide the
East Palo Alto College with books to stock its new library.
Anyone on campus can contribute their old textbooks or
paperbacks to the Nairobi community.
Nairobi College hopes to fill the educational void in the
black community with a two-year study program. At the
same time, the college wants to provide East Palo Alto with
an open-ended cultural center where people can get together
and learn what Nairobi has to offer.
The drive will last through the week, and there are
representatives in all living groups on campus who will help
pick up the books.
