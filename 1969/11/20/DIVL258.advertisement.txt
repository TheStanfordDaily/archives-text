Your diamond engagement ring
is probably your first investment in
a piece of fine jewelry. It should be
bought from someone you trust—
someone who'll give you the
straight facts—someone who'll give
you a fair deal.
Jeff Fisher is a Stanford student
and an experienced jeweler. Hi*
understands that buying a diamond
usually comes when finances are
tight for a student—he's interested
in fulfilling your needs and desires
no matter what your budget is.
When you sit down at Jeff's dia
mond corner, you will learn about
the all-important factors that de
termine diamond quality—color,
cutting, and clarity. Comparing the
stones, you can choose the diamond
just right in size and quality' for
you. Then from a complete selec
tion of rings, you can pick out the
mounting and band that perfectly
accentuate your new diamond.
For a beautiful engagement ring
that she will wear with pride—call
J (if Fishier today. (328-4(145)
