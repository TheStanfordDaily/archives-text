# Hoover Conference
## Speakers Explore Threats To Peace 
### JUDY BIRK 
Diverse opinions on the most
significant threats to world peace
were voiced by Stanford Professor
Joshua Lederberg, Berkeley
political scientist Robert
Scalapino, and assistant secretary
of defense G. Warren Nutter at
the second-day sessions of the
Hoover Institution's conference
on "Peaceful Change in Modern
Society."
In his address on "Ideologies of
Violence," Sidney Hook,
Professor of Philosophy at New
York University maintained that
"violence has reached such
proportions on our campuses that
the whole atmosphere of
American universities has been
transformed."
"Violence in the academy is an
outgrowth of violence in the
streets and cities of the country,"
stated Hook. "That is where the
gravest danger lies."
According to Hook, where
violence has been used to effect
educational reforms, "a grievous
wound has been inflicted on the
fabric of university life which may
take a generation to heal."
Biological Weapons
Nobel Laureate Joshua
Lederberg, Stanford professor of
genetics and biology told the
conference it was "incredible"
that the U.S. already has
stockpiled biological weapons.
"We are cooking up a way in
which a prescription for enormous
but precarious and unpredictable
power can be made available to
any gangster," warned Lederberg.

Continuing by analogy, he
added, the results may be "quite
comparable to what would be
available if hydrogen bombs were
sold at Woolworth's."
There is "no reliable means of
testing" biological weapons, he
emphasized, and it is extremely
difficult to predict results of their
use with any great reliability. "A
single particle could, in principle,
engulf the earth."
Lederberg said he was
"absolutely astonished" at
Defense Secretary Melvin Laird's
recent comments favoring
reduction or elimination of
biological warfare agents because
he did not realize the U.S. already
had such stockpiles.
Third World Revolution
As the risk of nuclear
confrontation between major
powers recedes, "the 'small war'
emanating from the problems of
the Third World is likely to
constitute the most significant
threat to peace in our times"
Robert A. Scalapino, Berkeley
Professor of political science told
an afternoon session of the
Hoover conference. This will be
especially true, suggested
Scalapino, "when these problems
are used by other states as a
means of seeking to change the
regional or global balance of
power."
Scalapino called for revival or
restructuring of presently
"ineffective" regional political
instruments and a recently
"disappointing" United Nations.
Their revitalization becomes all

the more important, he explained,
when "certain of the most
'advanced' societies are
threatening to enter a withdrawal
phase as a result of having to face
a host of new internal problems."
ABM—Type Peace
Assistant Secretary of Defense
for International Security, G.
Warren Nutter said yesterday that
"the U.S. would be in serious
trouble" without the ABM
Safeguard Defense System.
Nutter spoke of the critical
need to maintain deterrent power
in the 1970's to insure world
peace. According to Nutter, the
ABM system is the least
expensive, most effective, most
diplomatically acceptable kind of
defense power which the U.S.
could develop as a useful
instrument of power politics.

At a dinner honoring
participants in the Hoover
conference last night, University
of California President Charles J.
Hitch called for a "climate of
change" that would dissipate "the
threats of conformity hanging
over the nation as well as over the
university."
"Classrooms are disrupted in
the name of education; speakers
are shouted down in the name of
free speech, job recruiters are
driven from campus in the name
of morality, and demands for
total conformity to a particular
line of thought are made in the
name of nonconformity and
dissent," declared Hitch.
Hitch called for a "new
reconciliation" on our campuses
and in our society.


HOOVER—Hilary Conroy, of the University of Pennsylvania, speaking
Monday reminded the participants in the current Hoover conference
of an ancient Tibetian saying: "One must search out every scorpion of
evil within one's self." Further tidbits will be imparted at today's
meetings, open to the public.
