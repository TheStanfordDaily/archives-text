## 'Zionist Cooperation With Nazis' 
### Faisal Tamimi 
In the lexicon of Post World
War II vocabulary no other word
has achieved the notoriety of the
word "Nazi". As a synonym for
all that is barbaric, sadistic and
cruel it cuts across all linguistic
barriers and hence has become a
favorite catchword for
propagandists of all political
shades.One hears of governments
employing "nazi" methods of
repression against student leftists
using "nazi" tactics of social
disruption with the aid of a
"nazi" police force. A more subtle
form of political slander is that of
accusing a group or a nation of
receiving or having received
support, at one time or another,
from Nazis or ex-Nazis. However,

even for propaganda purposes
some people are more equal than
others. The employment of an
ex-Nazi petty official in Egypt
raises eyebrows but the
appointment of the leading
ex-Nazi scientist as head of the
American Space Program goes
unquestioned.
Recently, in an attempt to
discredit the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, the
tired specter of Nazi support was
revived. Certain individuals, we
are told, an ex-soldier and an
ex-petty officer, who were once
Nazis, are now attempting to
support the above organization,
providing conclusive proof, one is
expected to believe, that all Arabs
hate Jews. What, then, is one to
conclude from the negotiations of
Palestinian Zionists with the
executors of the Final Solution?
Or, of the fact that the state of
Israel was receiving financial and
military aid from a West German
state with an ex-Nazi President
(an architect of concentration
camps, no less!) and an ex-Nazi
Prime Minister?
Suitable Material
In the early days of National
Socialism, the Zionists
co-operated with the Nazi
authorities. They saw in Nazism
"the decisive defeat of
assimilationism" and were
convinced that "dissimilation,"
combined with the emigration to
Palestine of Jewish youngsters and
Capitalists, would be a "mutually
fair solution." Later, when the
Final Solution was put into
operation, we still find them given
permission to "pick young Jewish
pioneers" from the Jews in
concentration camps. They were
not interested in rescue operations
"that was not their job," they
wanted to select "suitable
material." (The story is told in
full in Jon and David Kimche's
book The Secret Roads: The
Illegal Migration of a People
1938-1948, London, 1954). As
late as March 1944, when the last
bastion of resistence to the Jewish
Solution was being tackled by the
Nazis in Budapest, we find the
Zionists "free to come and go

practically as they pleased, they
were exempt from wearing the
yellow star, [and] received
permits to visit concentration
camps." (See Arendt's Eichman in
Jerusalem, p. 181.) A state of
affairs that speaks volumes about
co-operation with Nazis! One
wonders from all this how the
Jewish people of Europe who
were neither young or rich (the
desired "suitable material") were
classified! Perhaps we should
lump them with the rest of the
non-people Semites who had to be
sacrificed for the "high ideals" of
Zionism, the Palestinians!
The Palestinian people, to be
distinguished from the Arabs of
Arab-speaking peoples at large,
were the inhabitants and owners
of the land of Palestine until 1948
when they had to be sacrificed for
the new State. They constitute
the vital element that most
Zionists try to ignore when
justifying their State and its
establishment. In the true spirit of
the"I saw, I coveted, I
conquered" tradition, they totally
ignore the fact that the
pre-condition for the
establishment of this State has
been the destruction of another
national entity and the dispersion
of a people.
Stake Out a Territory
In a remarkable distortion of
Rupert Emerson's concept of
nationhood, we are told that a
nation is a body of people with
"identity, tradition and ability to
stake out a territory." Staking out
a territory that is already
inhabited and conquering it
militarily is by no means a
definition of nationhood although
it is an aberration practiced by
some states. Hitler used the same
arguments to justify staking out
territory in Austria,
Czecheslovakia, even Poland. And
using the same arguments, the
desires and "needs" of his own
people, he would have destroyed
the threat he saw in the Slavs.
And what argument did he use to
destroy the gypsies and the Jews?

Wasn't all humanitarianism
sacrificed on the alter of the
German nation and what he
considered its demands to be?
Why, then, is staking out land in
Palestine, with no consideration
for its inhabitants, displacing and
dispersing an entire people, all of
a sudden an acceptable
pre-requisite to nationhood?
Is it any wonder that after 20
years of degradation and
humilitation the Palestinians
should finally attempt to salvage
their country? What is remarkable
is not that their memory is still
alive after 20 years but that they
were able to start organizing after
this brief period and under such
adverse conditions of poverty and
social and political disintegration.
They are vicious terrorists, we are
told, but their claims are modest
in comparison to their sufferings.
They ask for the reestablishment
of the pre-1948 state of Palestine
in which the three faiths—Jewish,
Christian and Moslem —can live on
an equal basis under secular law.
Is it too much to ask that one be
allowed to live in one's own
country as an equal rather than in
an alien, frankly racist state?
Historical Claim
But we are in for one more
devastatingly convincing argument
of the right of the Zionist to
transplant an aggressive European
nationalism to the Middle East.
"The Jews' religious, emotional
and historical claim to Israel as
their homeland is stronger than
that of the Arabs. Thus Israel
proclaimed itself as a state . .
I'm not sure what unit of measure
was used as a basis for this
startlingly presumptuous
statement. How could the
Palestinians disprove this thesis?
Perhaps in part with what the
Liberation Movement is already
engaged in doing, providing that
Palestinians, too, when faced with
the destruction of their national
entity are willing to fight, to die,
even to keep "bad" company,
occasionally to regain the freedom
to live as equals in their own land.

country as an equal rather than in

Historical Claim
But we are in for one more
devastatingly convincing argument
of the right of the Zionist to
transplant an aggressive European
nationalism to the Middle East.
"The Jews' religious, emotional
and historical claim to Israel as
their homeland is stronger than
that of the Arabs. Thus Israel
proclaimed itself as a state . .
I'm not sure what unit of measure
was used as a basis for this
startlingly presumptuous

Palestinians disprove this thesis?
Perhaps in part with what the
Liberation Movement is already
engaged in doing, providing that
Palestinians, too, when faced with
the destruction of their national
entity are willing to fight, to die,
even to keep "bad" company,
occasionally to regain the freedom
to live as equals in their own land.

In the lexicon of Post World
War II vocabulary no other word
has achieved the notoriety of the
word "Nazi". As a synonym for
all that is barbaric, sadistic and
cruel it cuts across all linguistic
barriers and hence has become a
favorite catchword for
propagandists of all political
shades.One hears of governments
employing "nazi" methods of
repression against student leftists
using "nazi" tactics of social
disruption with the aid of a
"nazi" police force. A more subtle
form of political slander is that of
accusing a group or a nation of
receiving or having received
support, at one time or another,
from Nazis or ex-Nazis. However,

even for propaganda purposes
some people are more equal than
others. The employment of an
ex-Nazi petty official in Egypt
raises eyebrows but the
appointment of the leading
ex-Nazi scientist as head of the
American Space Program goes
unquestioned.
Recently, in an attempt to
discredit the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, the
tired specter of Nazi support was
revived. Certain individuals, we
are told, an ex-soldier and an
ex-petty officer, who were once
Nazis, are now attempting to
support the above organization,
providing conclusive proof, one is
expected to believe, that all Arabs
hate Jews. What, then, is one to
conclude from the negotiations of
Palestinian Zionists with the
executors of the Final Solution?
Or, of the fact that the state of
Israel was receiving financial and
military aid from a West German
state with an ex-Nazi President
(an architect of concentration
camps, no less!) and an ex-Nazi
Prime Minister?
Suitable Material
In the early days of National
Socialism, the Zionists
co-operated with the Nazi
authorities. They saw in Nazism
"the decisive defeat of
assimilationism" and were
convinced that "dissimilation,"
combined with the emigration to
Palestine of Jewish youngsters and
Capitalists, would be a "mutually
fair solution." Later, when the
Final Solution was put into
operation, we still find them given
permission to "pick young Jewish
pioneers" from the Jews in
concentration camps. They were
not interested in rescue operations
"that was not their job," they
wanted to select "suitable
material." (The story is told in
full in Jon and David Kimche's
book The Secret Roads: The
Illegal Migration of a People
1938-1948, London, 1954). As
late as March 1944, when the last
bastion of resistence to the Jewish
Solution was being tackled by the
Nazis in Budapest, we find the
Zionists "free to come and go

practically as they pleased, they
were exempt from wearing the
yellow star, [and] received
permits to visit concentration
camps." (See Arendt's Eichman in
Jerusalem, p. 181.) A state of
affairs that speaks volumes about
co-operation with Nazis! One
wonders from all this how the
Jewish people of Europe who
were neither young or rich (the
desired "suitable material") were
classified! Perhaps we should
lump them with the rest of the
non-people Semites who had to be
sacrificed for the "high ideals" of
Zionism, the Palestinians!
The Palestinian people, to be
distinguished from the Arabs of
Arab-speaking peoples at large,
were the inhabitants and owners
of the land of Palestine until 1948
when they had to be sacrificed for
the new State. They constitute
the vital element that most
Zionists try to ignore when
justifying their State and its
establishment. In the true spirit of
the"I saw, I coveted, I
conquered" tradition, they totally
ignore the fact that the
pre-condition for the
establishment of this State has
been the destruction of another
national entity and the dispersion
of a people.
Stake Out a Territory
In a remarkable distortion of
Rupert Emerson's concept of
nationhood, we are told that a
nation is a body of people with
"identity, tradition and ability to
stake out a territory." Staking out
a territory that is already
inhabited and conquering it
militarily is by no means a
definition of nationhood although
it is an aberration practiced by
some states. Hitler used the same
arguments to justify staking out
territory in Austria,
Czecheslovakia, even Poland. And
using the same arguments, the
desires and "needs" of his own
people, he would have destroyed
the threat he saw in the Slavs.
And what argument did he use to
destroy the gypsies and the Jews?

Wasn't all humanitarianism
sacrificed on the alter of the
German nation and what he
considered its demands to be?
Why, then, is staking out land in
Palestine, with no consideration
for its inhabitants, displacing and
dispersing an entire people, all of
a sudden an acceptable
pre-requisite to nationhood?
Is it any wonder that after 20
years of degradation and
humilitation the Palestinians
should finally attempt to salvage
their country? What is remarkable
is not that their memory is still
alive after 20 years but that they
were able to start organizing after
this brief period and under such
adverse conditions of poverty and
social and political disintegration.
They are vicious terrorists, we are
told, but their claims are modest
in comparison to their sufferings.
They ask for the reestablishment
of the pre-1948 state of Palestine
in which the three faiths—Jewish,
Christian and Moslem —can live on
an equal basis under secular law.
Is it too much to ask that one be
allowed to live in one's own
country as an equal rather than in
an alien, frankly racist state?

Why, then, is staking out land in
Palestine, with no consideration
for its inhabitants, displacing and
dispersing an entire people, all of
a sudden an acceptable
pre-requisite to nationhood?
Is it any wonder that after 20
years of degradation and
humilitation the Palestinians
should finally attempt to salvage
their country? What is remarkable
is not that their memory is still
alive after 20 years but that they
were able to start organizing after
this brief period and under such
adverse conditions of poverty and
social and political disintegration.
They are vicious terrorists, we are
told, but their claims are modest
in comparison to their sufferings.
They ask for the reestablishment
of the pre-1948 state of Palestine
in which the three faiths—Jewish,
Christian and Moslem —can live on
an equal basis under secular law.
Is it too much to ask that one be
allowed to live in one's own
country as an equal rather than in
an alien, frankly racist state?
Historical Claim
But we are in for one more
devastatingly convincing argument
of the right of the Zionist to
transplant an aggressive European
nationalism to the Middle East.
"The Jews' religious, emotional
and historical claim to Israel as
their homeland is stronger than
that of the Arabs. Thus Israel
proclaimed itself as a state . .
I'm not sure what unit of measure
was used as a basis for this
startlingly presumptuous
statement. How could the
Palestinians disprove this thesis?
Perhaps in part with what the
Liberation Movement is already
engaged in doing, providing that
Palestinians, too, when faced with
the destruction of their national
entity are willing to fight, to die,
even to keep "bad" company,
occasionally to regain the freedom
to live as equals in their own land.

In the lexicon of Post World
War II vocabulary no other word
has achieved the notoriety of the
word "Nazi". As a synonym for
all that is barbaric, sadistic and
cruel it cuts across all linguistic
barriers and hence has become a
favorite catchword for
propagandists of all political
shades.One hears of governments
employing "nazi" methods of
repression against student leftists
using "nazi" tactics of social
disruption with the aid of a
"nazi" police force. A more subtle
form of political slander is that of
accusing a group or a nation of
receiving or having received
support, at one time or another,
from Nazis or ex-Nazis. However,

even for propaganda purposes
some people are more equal than
others. The employment of an
ex-Nazi petty official in Egypt
raises eyebrows but the
appointment of the leading
ex-Nazi scientist as head of the
American Space Program goes
unquestioned.
Recently, in an attempt to
discredit the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, the
tired specter of Nazi support was
revived. Certain individuals, we
are told, an ex-soldier and an
ex-petty officer, who were once
Nazis, are now attempting to
support the above organization,
providing conclusive proof, one is
expected to believe, that all Arabs
hate Jews. What, then, is one to
conclude from the negotiations of
Palestinian Zionists with the
executors of the Final Solution?
Or, of the fact that the state of
Israel was receiving financial and
military aid from a West German
state with an ex-Nazi President
(an architect of concentration
camps, no less!) and an ex-Nazi
Prime Minister?
Suitable Material
In the early days of National
Socialism, the Zionists
co-operated with the Nazi
authorities. They saw in Nazism
"the decisive defeat of
assimilationism" and were
convinced that "dissimilation,"
combined with the emigration to
Palestine of Jewish youngsters and
Capitalists, would be a "mutually
fair solution." Later, when the
Final Solution was put into
operation, we still find them given
permission to "pick young Jewish
pioneers" from the Jews in
concentration camps. They were
not interested in rescue operations
"that was not their job," they
wanted to select "suitable
material." (The story is told in
full in Jon and David Kimche's
book The Secret Roads: The
Illegal Migration of a People
1938-1948, London, 1954). As
late as March 1944, when the last
bastion of resistence to the Jewish
Solution was being tackled by the
Nazis in Budapest, we find the
Zionists "free to come and go

practically as they pleased, they
were exempt from wearing the
yellow star, [and] received
permits to visit concentration
camps." (See Arendt's Eichman in
Jerusalem, p. 181.) A state of
affairs that speaks volumes about
co-operation with Nazis! One
wonders from all this how the
Jewish people of Europe who
were neither young or rich (the
desired "suitable material") were
classified! Perhaps we should
lump them with the rest of the
non-people Semites who had to be
sacrificed for the "high ideals" of
Zionism, the Palestinians!
The Palestinian people, to be
distinguished from the Arabs of
Arab-speaking peoples at large,
were the inhabitants and owners
of the land of Palestine until 1948
when they had to be sacrificed for
the new State. They constitute
the vital element that most
Zionists try to ignore when
justifying their State and its
establishment. In the true spirit of
the"I saw, I coveted, I
conquered" tradition, they totally
ignore the fact that the
pre-condition for the
establishment of this State has
been the destruction of another
national entity and the dispersion
of a people.
Stake Out a Territory
In a remarkable distortion of
Rupert Emerson's concept of
nationhood, we are told that a
nation is a body of people with
"identity, tradition and ability to
stake out a territory." Staking out
a territory that is already
inhabited and conquering it
militarily is by no means a
definition of nationhood although
it is an aberration practiced by
some states. Hitler used the same
arguments to justify staking out
territory in Austria,
Czecheslovakia, even Poland. And
using the same arguments, the
desires and "needs" of his own
people, he would have destroyed
the threat he saw in the Slavs.
And what argument did he use to
destroy the gypsies and the Jews?

Wasn't all humanitarianism
sacrificed on the alter of the
German nation and what he
considered its demands to be?
Why, then, is staking out land in
Palestine, with no consideration
for its inhabitants, displacing and
dispersing an entire people, all of
a sudden an acceptable
pre-requisite to nationhood?
