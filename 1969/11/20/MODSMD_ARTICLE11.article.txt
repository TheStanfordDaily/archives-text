# Senator Scores Scorekeepers
## Polarity's Price? 
### Steve Hoglund 
Though barely a month old, the
new ASSU Senate has drawn
critical commentary from several
sources. On two consecutive days
last week (Nov. 12 and 13),
readers of the DAILY, the
ARENA, and the COLONIST
found front-page coverage of
Senate proceedings which the
three articles had, in varying
degrees, distorted. In referring to
the three stories at the outset, I
seek not simply to rebut factual
inaccuracies but to analyze, as
well, certain shortsighted
interpretations. Hopefully, my
remarks will promote more
reflective commentary about the
role of the Senate than has been
in evidence thus far. (Since this
article was written prior to the
BSU-ARENA debate, it will
include no direct reference to
events of the past few days.)
Under the jaunty headline,
"ASSU Senate Stinks!!!" Roger
Reed argues in the ARENA that
the Senate is "dramatically
unrepresentative" of the student
body. After unraveling a string of
"explanation(s)" for this
condition, Reed winds up his
salvo with a seamy web of gnarled
non-sequiturs—to wit: "Since it is
unrepresentative, the new Senate
does not reflect the views of the
Stanford student body. At the
outset, its legitimacy is highly
questionable."
In order to place the past and
future proceedings of the Senate
in proper perspective, it is
necessary to delineate and
distinguish between the terms
"representative," "reflect," and
"legitimacy," which Reed and
several others have tossed about
so loosely.
First, I remind everyone that
each member of the Senate was
elected, under the Hare System,
from an academic
constituency—not from a
geographic unit (such as a living
group); nor from a racial grouping
(such as the BSU); nor from an
ideological constituency (such as,
perhaps, "white radicals").
If the Senate is, indeed,
unrepresentative, the
"explanation" canot be found in
the number of Blacks or white
radicals elected to the body.
Neither can it be found in the
Hare System of casting and
tabulating votes. That system,
Reed argues, "gives a decisive
advantage to candidates running
on a slate." But surely, as Senate
Chairman Dave Edwards pointed
out (DAILY, Nov. 14), any
popular candidate campaigning
independently could "easily buck
this system."
More importantly, the Hare
System works to the advantage of
a slate only when its composition
and its platform reflect the wishes
of a sizable portion of any
constituency —and, furthermore,
only when no equally appealing
competing slates are in evidence.
The BSU's highly successful
stretegy was not at all devious;
other campus groups, many with
larger memberships than that of
the BSU, had ample opportunity
to promote alternate sets of
candidates. Reed's attempt to link
the electoral process (including his
charge c e "intimidation" by the
BSU) with the racial and
(alleged— ideological composition
of the Senate smacks distinctly of
sourgrapes, in view of the absence
of other organized slates in the
campaign.
To repeat: each senator was
elected to represent an academic
constituency. Whether academic
constituencies are appropriate to
the concerns to which a student

legislature should (does) address
itslef, is a question which deserves
more than passing attention. But
for the present, the more
pertinent question is simply how
(and not whether as Reed has
framed it) your 40 Senators can
both determine and respond
to—hence truly "represent"—the
wishes of the constituencies that
elected them
Looking ahead to some of the
likely issues before the Senate, it
is difficult to foresee many
instances when members of the
Senate, in debating or in enacting,
will clearly reflect (or just as
clearly fail to reflect) the
academic nature of their
constituencies. This in itself may
be some cause for alarm, insofar
as abstract, symbolic issues (such
as, the "degree" of student
participation in University
decision-making) and equally
abstract ideological concerns (the
University's ties with the Defense
Department qua the war in
Vietnam qua US "imperialist
aggression," for example) may
dominate discussions in the
Senate and thereby limit, or
prevent entirely, consideration of
current, concrete student
problems here at Stanford.
If they are brought to the
Senate soon enough, the many
important SES proposals relating
to curriculum changes may help
to focus the attention of each
Senator on his constituency. Even
now, portions of a given
constituency (eg., graduate
students in Poli Sci) may have a
recognizable common grievance
which merits discussion in he
Senate. Were Senators from each
of the "electoral Schools" to
subdivide and bear responsibility
for distinct portions of their
constituencies, solutions might be
found for many specific student
problems which would otherwise
be squashed in stampedes to
appease (Mr. Reed) or to subvert
(Mr. Reed's opponents) the wishes
of some nebulous "majority" of
the student body.
Utilized effectively, both inside
and outside the Senate, such
subdivisions (or others, as may be
proposed) could add to the
already heavy volume of business
before the new legislature—and
would certainly add to the
log-rolling present in any
organization of a political nature.
Yet the gain from "reflecting"
more currents of opinion,
especially minority ones, would
offset any loss from the unsavory
aspects of "You scratch my back,
and I'll scratch yours." And surely
a Senate in which shifting
coalitions arise from concrete
issues is preferable to a senate in
which issues arise from rigid,
pre-arranged coalitions.
Tomorrow, I shall add further
thoughts about how the current
Senate may best "represent" and
"reflect" the wishes and problems
of the student body. Then I shall
turn to the concept of
"legitimacy," which concerns thf
Senate's very authority tc
legislate. Here I shall suggest that
written commentaries—and public
debate —have so far only served to
worsen the aspects of polarization
they have criticized. In the
process, the authority of the
Senate has been seriously
undermined.

"reflect" the wishes and problems
of the student body. Then I shall
turn to the concept of
"legitimacy," which concerns thf
Senate's very authority tc
legislate. Here I shall suggest that
written commentaries—and public
debate —have so far only served to
worsen the aspects of polarization
they have criticized. In the
process, the authority of the
Senate has been seriously
undermined.

Though barely a month old, the
new ASSU Senate has drawn
critical commentary from several
sources. On two consecutive days
last week (Nov. 12 and 13),
readers of the DAILY, the
ARENA, and the COLONIST
found front-page coverage of
Senate proceedings which the
three articles had, in varying
degrees, distorted. In referring to
the three stories at the outset, I
seek not simply to rebut factual
inaccuracies but to analyze, as
well, certain shortsighted
interpretations. Hopefully, my
remarks will promote more
reflective commentary about the
role of the Senate than has been
in evidence thus far. (Since this
article was written prior to the
BSU-ARENA debate, it will
include no direct reference to
events of the past few days.)
Under the jaunty headline,
"ASSU Senate Stinks!!!" Roger
Reed argues in the ARENA that
the Senate is "dramatically
unrepresentative" of the student
body. After unraveling a string of
"explanation(s)" for this
condition, Reed winds up his
salvo with a seamy web of gnarled
non-sequiturs—to wit: "Since it is
unrepresentative, the new Senate
does not reflect the views of the
Stanford student body. At the
outset, its legitimacy is highly
questionable."
In order to place the past and
future proceedings of the Senate
in proper perspective, it is
necessary to delineate and
distinguish between the terms
"representative," "reflect," and
"legitimacy," which Reed and
several others have tossed about
so loosely.
First, I remind everyone that
each member of the Senate was
elected, under the Hare System,
from an academic
constituency—not from a
geographic unit (such as a living
group); nor from a racial grouping
(such as the BSU); nor from an
ideological constituency (such as,
perhaps, "white radicals").
If the Senate is, indeed,
unrepresentative, the
"explanation" canot be found in
the number of Blacks or white
radicals elected to the body.
Neither can it be found in the
Hare System of casting and
tabulating votes. That system,
Reed argues, "gives a decisive
advantage to candidates running
on a slate." But surely, as Senate
Chairman Dave Edwards pointed
out (DAILY, Nov. 14), any
popular candidate campaigning
independently could "easily buck
this system."
More importantly, the Hare
System works to the advantage of
a slate only when its composition
and its platform reflect the wishes
of a sizable portion of any
constituency —and, furthermore,
only when no equally appealing
competing slates are in evidence.
The BSU's highly successful
stretegy was not at all devious;
other campus groups, many with
larger memberships than that of
the BSU, had ample opportunity
to promote alternate sets of
candidates. Reed's attempt to link
the electoral process (including his
charge c e "intimidation" by the
BSU) with the racial and
(alleged— ideological composition
of the Senate smacks distinctly of
sourgrapes, in view of the absence
of other organized slates in the
campaign.
To repeat: each senator was
elected to represent an academic
constituency. Whether academic
constituencies are appropriate to
the concerns to which a student

legislature should (does) address
itslef, is a question which deserves
more than passing attention. But
for the present, the more
pertinent question is simply how
(and not whether as Reed has
framed it) your 40 Senators can
both determine and respond
to—hence truly "represent"—the
wishes of the constituencies that
elected them
Looking ahead to some of the
likely issues before the Senate, it
is difficult to foresee many
instances when members of the
Senate, in debating or in enacting,
will clearly reflect (or just as
clearly fail to reflect) the
academic nature of their
constituencies. This in itself may
be some cause for alarm, insofar
as abstract, symbolic issues (such
as, the "degree" of student
participation in University
decision-making) and equally
abstract ideological concerns (the
University's ties with the Defense
Department qua the war in
Vietnam qua US "imperialist
aggression," for example) may
dominate discussions in the
Senate and thereby limit, or
prevent entirely, consideration of
current, concrete student
problems here at Stanford.
If they are brought to the
Senate soon enough, the many
important SES proposals relating
to curriculum changes may help
to focus the attention of each
Senator on his constituency. Even
now, portions of a given
constituency (eg., graduate
students in Poli Sci) may have a
recognizable common grievance
which merits discussion in he
Senate. Were Senators from each
of the "electoral Schools" to
subdivide and bear responsibility
for distinct portions of their
constituencies, solutions might be
found for many specific student
problems which would otherwise
be squashed in stampedes to
appease (Mr. Reed) or to subvert
(Mr. Reed's opponents) the wishes
of some nebulous "majority" of
the student body.
Utilized effectively, both inside
and outside the Senate, such
subdivisions (or others, as may be
proposed) could add to the
already heavy volume of business
before the new legislature—and
would certainly add to the
log-rolling present in any
organization of a political nature.
Yet the gain from "reflecting"
more currents of opinion,
especially minority ones, would
offset any loss from the unsavory
aspects of "You scratch my back,
and I'll scratch yours." And surely
a Senate in which shifting
coalitions arise from concrete
issues is preferable to a senate in
which issues arise from rigid,
pre-arranged coalitions.
Tomorrow, I shall add further
thoughts about how the current
Senate may best "represent" and
"reflect" the wishes and problems
of the student body. Then I shall

subdivisions (or others, as may be
proposed) could add to the
already heavy volume of business
before the new legislature—and
would certainly add to the
log-rolling present in any
organization of a political nature.
Yet the gain from "reflecting"
more currents of opinion,
especially minority ones, would
offset any loss from the unsavory
aspects of "You scratch my back,
and I'll scratch yours." And surely
a Senate in which shifting
coalitions arise from concrete
issues is preferable to a senate in
which issues arise from rigid,
pre-arranged coalitions.
Tomorrow, I shall add further
thoughts about how the current
Senate may best "represent" and
"reflect" the wishes and problems
of the student body. Then I shall
turn to the concept of
"legitimacy," which concerns thf
Senate's very authority tc
legislate. Here I shall suggest that
written commentaries—and public
debate —have so far only served to
worsen the aspects of polarization
they have criticized. In the
process, the authority of the
Senate has been seriously
undermined.

Though barely a month old, the
new ASSU Senate has drawn
critical commentary from several
sources. On two consecutive days
last week (Nov. 12 and 13),
readers of the DAILY, the
ARENA, and the COLONIST
found front-page coverage of
Senate proceedings which the
three articles had, in varying
degrees, distorted. In referring to
the three stories at the outset, I
seek not simply to rebut factual
inaccuracies but to analyze, as
well, certain shortsighted
interpretations. Hopefully, my
remarks will promote more
reflective commentary about the
role of the Senate than has been
in evidence thus far. (Since this
article was written prior to the
BSU-ARENA debate, it will
include no direct reference to
events of the past few days.)
Under the jaunty headline,
"ASSU Senate Stinks!!!" Roger
Reed argues in the ARENA that
the Senate is "dramatically
unrepresentative" of the student
body. After unraveling a string of
"explanation(s)" for this
condition, Reed winds up his
salvo with a seamy web of gnarled
non-sequiturs—to wit: "Since it is
unrepresentative, the new Senate
does not reflect the views of the
Stanford student body. At the
outset, its legitimacy is highly
questionable."
In order to place the past and
future proceedings of the Senate
in proper perspective, it is
necessary to delineate and
distinguish between the terms
"representative," "reflect," and
"legitimacy," which Reed and
several others have tossed about
so loosely.
First, I remind everyone that
each member of the Senate was
elected, under the Hare System,
from an academic
constituency—not from a
geographic unit (such as a living
group); nor from a racial grouping
(such as the BSU); nor from an
ideological constituency (such as,
perhaps, "white radicals").
If the Senate is, indeed,
unrepresentative, the
"explanation" canot be found in
the number of Blacks or white
radicals elected to the body.
Neither can it be found in the
Hare System of casting and
tabulating votes. That system,
Reed argues, "gives a decisive
advantage to candidates running
on a slate." But surely, as Senate
Chairman Dave Edwards pointed
out (DAILY, Nov. 14), any
popular candidate campaigning
independently could "easily buck
this system."
More importantly, the Hare
System works to the advantage of
a slate only when its composition
and its platform reflect the wishes
of a sizable portion of any
constituency —and, furthermore,
only when no equally appealing
competing slates are in evidence.
The BSU's highly successful
stretegy was not at all devious;
other campus groups, many with
larger memberships than that of
the BSU, had ample opportunity
to promote alternate sets of
candidates. Reed's attempt to link
the electoral process (including his
charge c e "intimidation" by the
BSU) with the racial and
(alleged— ideological composition
of the Senate smacks distinctly of
sourgrapes, in view of the absence
of other organized slates in the
campaign.
To repeat: each senator was
elected to represent an academic
constituency. Whether academic
constituencies are appropriate to
the concerns to which a student

legislature should (does) address
itslef, is a question which deserves
more than passing attention. But
for the present, the more
pertinent question is simply how
(and not whether as Reed has
framed it) your 40 Senators can
both determine and respond
to—hence truly "represent"—the
wishes of the constituencies that
elected them
Looking ahead to some of the
likely issues before the Senate, it
is difficult to foresee many
instances when members of the
Senate, in debating or in enacting,
will clearly reflect (or just as
clearly fail to reflect) the
academic nature of their
constituencies. This in itself may
be some cause for alarm, insofar
as abstract, symbolic issues (such
as, the "degree" of student
participation in University
decision-making) and equally
abstract ideological concerns (the
University's ties with the Defense
Department qua the war in
Vietnam qua US "imperialist
aggression," for example) may
dominate discussions in the
Senate and thereby limit, or
prevent entirely, consideration of
current, concrete student
problems here at Stanford.
If they are brought to the
Senate soon enough, the many
important SES proposals relating
to curriculum changes may help
to focus the attention of each
Senator on his constituency. Even
now, portions of a given
constituency (eg., graduate
students in Poli Sci) may have a
recognizable common grievance
which merits discussion in he
Senate. Were Senators from each
of the "electoral Schools" to
subdivide and bear responsibility
for distinct portions of their
constituencies, solutions might be
found for many specific student
problems which would otherwise
be squashed in stampedes to
appease (Mr. Reed) or to subvert
(Mr. Reed's opponents) the wishes
of some nebulous "majority" of
the student body.
Utilized effectively, both inside
and outside the Senate, such
subdivisions (or others, as may be
proposed) could add to the
already heavy volume of business
before the new legislature—and
would certainly add to the
log-rolling present in any
