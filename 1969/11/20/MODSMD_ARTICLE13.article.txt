# Reduced Rate Seen For Daily
## 
### JULIE FLEECE 
Reduced rate subscriptions to
the DAILY may be offered to
faculty members next quarter in
response to their requests for
more papers.
The DAILY business office
would like department secretaries
to take a poll of the faculty in
their departments to determine
how many would be interested in
subscribing at a reduced rate. As
soon as an adequate response is
received, the DAILY business
office will decide the details and
announce them to those
interested.
Results of the poll are being
handled by Marta Mahoney in the
DAILY business office. Business
manager Jeff Bonzon said, "The
response that I get will determine
whether or not we do get this
reduced rate and what the rate
will be."
Possible Rates
Present subscription rates are
$4.00 a quarter or $10.00 a year.
Bonzon mentioned the possibility
of faculty subscriptions at almost
half this price beginning Winter
Quarter.
The faculty and staff
subscriptions could be paid for by
individuals or by groups who
would like to share a paper. Funds
could be appropriated from a
department to pay for five or ten
DAILY subscriptions depending
on the department's demand.
The reduced rates were
proposed in response to
complaints that not enough copies
of the DAILY are being
distributed in several spots on
campus. DAILY editor Mark
Weinberger commented that he
was receiving complaints almost
every day. Bonzon noted that the
complaints have decreased slightly
since they had had no results.
Circulation Complaints
Complaints have come mainly
from places on campus where
there is a very low proportion of
students to faculty, such as the
Medical Center and SLAC.
The major reason that enough
copies have not been distributed
to meet these demands is that the
circulation is determined by the
number of students. Bonzon
stated, "Our responsibility is to
the students, because they do pay
for the paper."
Students pay for the DAILY
indirectly through the fees they
pay the University. The DAILY
receives about 85c per student
each quarter as part of the money
which the University allocates to
the ASSU for dispersement among
various student organizations.
The DAILY has a circulation of
12,000 copies which are meant
for the students. However, not all
of the students receive their
copies.
Student Copies Stolen
Many department secretaries
rush to pick up copies for their

department's faculty as soon as
the DAILY is delivered at 8 a.m.
Bonzon mentioned that it is also
these staff members who are the
first to complain if the DAILY
distribution is late in the morning.
Students who live off-campus
are usually the victims, because
the papers taken for faculty
members are usually taken from
the distribution points of the
Quad—Engineering and History
corners—and at the Post Office.
By the time some off-campus
students get to campus, these
supplies are often depleted.
Weinberger stated, "I would
very much like to see full
circulation of the paper
throughout the community. It
remains for us to work out the
details to allow greater circulation
of the paper."
Financial Problem
According to Bonzon, "Up till
now it's just been a problem of
financing—we just can't take that
big a loss." Each complaint and
plea for more copies fails to take
into account the actual cost of
"just a few more DAILIES."
The present expenses of the
DAILY are high even without
considering an increase in
circulation. Printing costs are
about $18,000 per quarter, and
composition of the paper before
printing costs approximately
$14,000 per quarter. In addition,
there are expenses for salaries,
telephone services, office supplies,
AP wire service, and so forth.
Bonzon estimated that printing
an extra 3,000 copies (based on
an average of an 8-page paper)
would cost an extra $5,350 per
quarter, including the hiring of
another paper boy to deliver the
papers.
Even 3,000 would not be
sufficient to satisfy the demand of
faculty and staff members. At
present, there are about 7,000
faculty and staff members in the
University.
Alternate Solutions
Other alternatives to solve thu
financial problem have been
proposed. One suggestion is that
the DAILY become entirely a
subscription newspaper, as several
other campus newspapers are. The
University of Michigan paper
charges a subscription fee of
$5.50 a semester, or $11.00 a
year, to everyone—students,
faculty, and mail subscribers.
Another feasible alternative
would be to have the faculty and
staff pay for the DAILY
indirectly, through the University,
as the students do. Bonzon
estimated that $1-2 per faculty or
staff member for each year would
adequately cover an increased
circulation.
Bonzon indicated that the
faculty and staff could put
pressure on the University to allot
funds for faculty and staff
subscriptions.

complaints have decreased slightly
since they had had no results.
Circulation Complaints
Complaints have come mainly
from places on campus where
there is a very low proportion of
students to faculty, such as the
Medical Center and SLAC.
The major reason that enough
copies have not been distributed
to meet these demands is that the
circulation is determined by the
number of students. Bonzon
stated, "Our responsibility is to
the students, because they do pay
for the paper."
Students pay for the DAILY
indirectly through the fees they
pay the University. The DAILY
receives about 85c per student
each quarter as part of the money
which the University allocates to
the ASSU for dispersement among
various student organizations.
The DAILY has a circulation of
12,000 copies which are meant
for the students. However, not all
of the students receive their
copies.
Student Copies Stolen
Many department secretaries
rush to pick up copies for their

department's faculty as soon as
the DAILY is delivered at 8 a.m.
Bonzon mentioned that it is also
these staff members who are the
first to complain if the DAILY
distribution is late in the morning.
Students who live off-campus
are usually the victims, because
the papers taken for faculty
members are usually taken from
the distribution points of the
Quad—Engineering and History
corners—and at the Post Office.
By the time some off-campus
students get to campus, these
supplies are often depleted.
Weinberger stated, "I would
very much like to see full
circulation of the paper
throughout the community. It
remains for us to work out the
details to allow greater circulation
of the paper."
Financial Problem
According to Bonzon, "Up till
now it's just been a problem of
financing—we just can't take that
big a loss." Each complaint and
plea for more copies fails to take
into account the actual cost of
"just a few more DAILIES."
The present expenses of the
DAILY are high even without
considering an increase in
circulation. Printing costs are
about $18,000 per quarter, and
composition of the paper before
printing costs approximately
$14,000 per quarter. In addition,
there are expenses for salaries,
telephone services, office supplies,
AP wire service, and so forth.
Bonzon estimated that printing
an extra 3,000 copies (based on
an average of an 8-page paper)
would cost an extra $5,350 per
quarter, including the hiring of
another paper boy to deliver the
papers.
Even 3,000 would not be
sufficient to satisfy the demand of
faculty and staff members. At
present, there are about 7,000
faculty and staff members in the
University.
Alternate Solutions
Other alternatives to solve thu
financial problem have been
proposed. One suggestion is that
the DAILY become entirely a
subscription newspaper, as several
other campus newspapers are. The
University of Michigan paper
charges a subscription fee of
$5.50 a semester, or $11.00 a
year, to everyone—students,
faculty, and mail subscribers.
Another feasible alternative
would be to have the faculty and
staff pay for the DAILY
indirectly, through the University,
as the students do. Bonzon
estimated that $1-2 per faculty or
staff member for each year would
adequately cover an increased
circulation.
Bonzon indicated that the
faculty and staff could put
pressure on the University to allot
funds for faculty and staff
subscriptions.

Reduced rate subscriptions to
the DAILY may be offered to
faculty members next quarter in
response to their requests for
more papers.
The DAILY business office
would like department secretaries
to take a poll of the faculty in
their departments to determine
how many would be interested in
subscribing at a reduced rate. As
soon as an adequate response is
received, the DAILY business
office will decide the details and
announce them to those
interested.
Results of the poll are being
handled by Marta Mahoney in the
DAILY business office. Business
manager Jeff Bonzon said, "The
response that I get will determine
whether or not we do get this
reduced rate and what the rate
will be."
Possible Rates
Present subscription rates are
$4.00 a quarter or $10.00 a year.
Bonzon mentioned the possibility
of faculty subscriptions at almost
half this price beginning Winter
Quarter.
The faculty and staff
subscriptions could be paid for by
individuals or by groups who
would like to share a paper. Funds
could be appropriated from a
department to pay for five or ten
DAILY subscriptions depending
on the department's demand.
The reduced rates were
proposed in response to
complaints that not enough copies
of the DAILY are being
distributed in several spots on
campus. DAILY editor Mark
Weinberger commented that he
was receiving complaints almost
every day. Bonzon noted that the
complaints have decreased slightly

By the time some off-campus
students get to campus, these
supplies are often depleted.
Weinberger stated, "I would
very much like to see full
circulation of the paper
throughout the community. It
remains for us to work out the
details to allow greater circulation
of the paper."
Financial Problem
According to Bonzon, "Up till
now it's just been a problem of
financing—we just can't take that
big a loss." Each complaint and
plea for more copies fails to take
into account the actual cost of
"just a few more DAILIES."
The present expenses of the
DAILY are high even without
considering an increase in
circulation. Printing costs are
about $18,000 per quarter, and
composition of the paper before
printing costs approximately
$14,000 per quarter. In addition,
there are expenses for salaries,
telephone services, office supplies,
AP wire service, and so forth.
Bonzon estimated that printing
an extra 3,000 copies (based on
an average of an 8-page paper)
would cost an extra $5,350 per
quarter, including the hiring of
another paper boy to deliver the
papers.
Even 3,000 would not be
sufficient to satisfy the demand of
faculty and staff members. At
present, there are about 7,000
faculty and staff members in the
University.
Alternate Solutions
Other alternatives to solve thu
financial problem have been
proposed. One suggestion is that
the DAILY become entirely a
subscription newspaper, as several
other campus newspapers are. The
University of Michigan paper
charges a subscription fee of
$5.50 a semester, or $11.00 a
year, to everyone—students,
faculty, and mail subscribers.
Another feasible alternative
would be to have the faculty and
staff pay for the DAILY
indirectly, through the University,
as the students do. Bonzon
estimated that $1-2 per faculty or
staff member for each year would
adequately cover an increased
circulation.
Bonzon indicated that the
faculty and staff could put
pressure on the University to allot
funds for faculty and staff
subscriptions.

Reduced rate subscriptions to
the DAILY may be offered to
faculty members next quarter in
response to their requests for
more papers.
The DAILY business office
would like department secretaries
to take a poll of the faculty in
their departments to determine
how many would be interested in
subscribing at a reduced rate. As
soon as an adequate response is
received, the DAILY business
office will decide the details and
announce them to those
interested.
Results of the poll are being
handled by Marta Mahoney in the
DAILY business office. Business
manager Jeff Bonzon said, "The
response that I get will determine
whether or not we do get this
reduced rate and what the rate
will be."
Possible Rates
Present subscription rates are
$4.00 a quarter or $10.00 a year.
Bonzon mentioned the possibility
of faculty subscriptions at almost
half this price beginning Winter
Quarter.
The faculty and staff
subscriptions could be paid for by
individuals or by groups who
would like to share a paper. Funds
could be appropriated from a
department to pay for five or ten
DAILY subscriptions depending
on the department's demand.
The reduced rates were
proposed in response to
complaints that not enough copies
of the DAILY are being
distributed in several spots on
campus. DAILY editor Mark
Weinberger commented that he
was receiving complaints almost
every day. Bonzon noted that the
complaints have decreased slightly
since they had had no results.
Circulation Complaints
Complaints have come mainly
from places on campus where
there is a very low proportion of
students to faculty, such as the
Medical Center and SLAC.
The major reason that enough
copies have not been distributed
to meet these demands is that the
circulation is determined by the
number of students. Bonzon
stated, "Our responsibility is to
the students, because they do pay
for the paper."
Students pay for the DAILY
indirectly through the fees they
pay the University. The DAILY
receives about 85c per student
each quarter as part of the money
which the University allocates to
the ASSU for dispersement among
various student organizations.
The DAILY has a circulation of
12,000 copies which are meant
for the students. However, not all
of the students receive their
copies.
Student Copies Stolen
Many department secretaries
rush to pick up copies for their

department's faculty as soon as
the DAILY is delivered at 8 a.m.
Bonzon mentioned that it is also
these staff members who are the
first to complain if the DAILY
distribution is late in the morning.
Students who live off-campus
are usually the victims, because
the papers taken for faculty
members are usually taken from
the distribution points of the
Quad—Engineering and History
corners—and at the Post Office.
By the time some off-campus
students get to campus, these
supplies are often depleted.
