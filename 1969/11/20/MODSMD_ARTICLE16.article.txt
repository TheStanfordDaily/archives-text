WASHINGTON (AP)- The Senate
passed President Nixon's draft
lottery bill Wednesday and sent it
to the White House. That means
the next men inducted may be
chosen under the new system.
Based on a national drawing of
birthdays, and designed ultimately
to concentrate the draft on
19-year-olds, it will supplant
induction rules under which the
oldest eligible men are the first
summoned to military service.
The bill passed by voice vote
after a scant hour of sparsely
attended debate.
Sen. Mike Mansfield, D-Mont.,
cast the only opposing vote,
saying the measure does not
adequately deal with the
inequities of selective service.
Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss.,
chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, promised his panel
will open comprehensive draft
hearings by Feb. 15 in an effort to
fashion a general reform bill.
Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird said the next draft call will
come in January, and the
administration will try to have the
system in operation by then.
"We hope to have the new
random selection in effect for the
next draftees," he said.

When the new system is fully
effective, it will mean a single year
of draft liability for most young
Americans, instead of the seven
uncertain vears thev now face.

BERKELEY (AP) â€”Dan Siegel,
23-year-old law student at the
University of California, said
Wednesday he is optimistic that
UC Chancellor Roger Heyns will
reinstate him as president-elect of
the student body.
Municipal Court jurors late
Tuesday night acquitted Siegel of
a charge of inciting to riot.
Siegel was prevented by Heyns
from taking office because of the
charge which resulted from the
"People's Park" riot last May 15.
He said his attorney, Malcolm
Burnstein, has asked for a meeting
with the chancellor when Heyns
returns to the campus in a few
days.
Heyns' decision to put Siegel
on disciplinary probation
followed recommendations of the
student-faculty discipline
committee.
