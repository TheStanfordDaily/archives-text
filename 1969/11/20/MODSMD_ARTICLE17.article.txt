## Debussy And Puccini 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
It was a hard day's night at the
Opera House for the premiere of
Debussy's lone opera, Pelleas et
Melisande. While the evening was
musically successful, the
production did little to mitigate
the inaccessibility of this strange
opera.
As did Beethoven in Fidelio,
Debussy bent the operatic
music-form to his own unique
aesthetic in Pelleas. The result is a
thoroughly Debussy-esque musical
experience; the composer bathes
the senses in a lush impressionism
which seeps into the emotional
underground as if by osmosis.
This achievement might seem
auspicious, but it perhaps is just
this visceral (rather than
intellectual) potency which makes
Pelleas such an esoteric
masterpiece. The blend of
Debussy's atomizing
impressionism and Maeterlinck's
oppressive, monolithic
symbolism—though frequently
and fervently praised—may simply
be too heady a mixture for the
usual audience. Too scrupulous an
attempt to piece all the
mysterious elements of the opera
could easily lead to a slight sense
of mal de mer.
Glassy-eyed Boredom
Glassy-eyed boredom, however,
probably took an even larger toll,
since in this opera Debussy cuts
the audience adrift from its usual
morrings of hummable melodies,
set-piece numbers and
run-of-the-mill emotional
experiences.

Still, the person who enjoys
Debussy would have had a
pleasant evening. Debussy was a
master of the exotic and could
capture the other worldly
perspective of our worldly
existence; this is precisely what
his Pelleas accomplishes. Debussy
often turned his visual acuity
upon nature (La Mer, Nocturnes);
in this opera he takes a lingering,
mordant look at the quality of
man's existence.
Conductor Jean Perisson'skeen
affinity to the temperament of
Pelleas was communicated to the
orchestra with no apparent loss,
and the cast performed capably.
No astounding voices were
revealed (no really astounding
singing required), though Frantz
Petri (as Golaud) and Henri Gui
(as Pelleas) made creditable
American debuts. Both presented
rugged, Jacques Brel-like figures.
Jeannette Pilou sang the rather
thankless role of Melisande, who
seems to be perpetually
sad—always focusing nearsightedly
on her destiny. Miss Pilou pinned
down nicely Melisande's
distracted ennui.
Giorgio Tozzi sang the old
amateur-philosopher King Arkel
with impressive fortitude and
achieved a good effect of
ponderous decrepitude. Margot
'Moser failed to invest the part of
Golaud's young boy Yniold with
the childishness of voice so vital
to the father-son interview.
Massive Symbols
The production itself
undermines the opera, perhaps
because it rather simplemindedly
tries to match Maeterlinck's
massive symbolism with massive
symbols (15-foot thrones, a great
circle of briars). As well, there was
too much openness in the settings,
and this inevitably detracted from
the oppressive closeness and
coldness which should visually
complement the sense of
emotional claustrophobia which
pervades Pelleas.
The scrim has been a financial
God-send for the opera, and it was
often and effectively used. Still, a
scrim is a scrim, and (like
naughahyde and imitation ice
cream) cannot be appreciated as
much as the real thing. Other
liberties taken in this production
were not well taken, e.g. using the
sea-cave for gloom-choked
underground vaults of the castle.
I may bruise the sensibilities of
a few effete snobs for saying this,
but I do believe Pelleas should be

performed in English. The opera is
remote enough as it is; there is no
need great enough to put the
Atlantic Ocean as well between
singers and audience.
* * *
Puccini's La Boheme probably
comes closer to the temperament
of San Francisco than any other
opera: it is so genuinely cheerful
on the outside and so
heart-breakingly sad and diseased
on the inside.
And fittingly, the Opera's
production of the opera is hearty,
honestly sentimental )a la Herb
Caen), and visually satisfying. The
Latin Quarter scene is a highlight
of its entire repertory. But I have
already commented upon the
visual pleasantries and solid stage
direction of this production. I
wish merely to footnote here my
impressions of the current cast.
The sentimentality of the opera
was enhanced by the return of a
home-town girl who went on to
greater houses (like the Met).
Lucine Amara is getting along in
years, and she sang the first act
very close to the bodice.
But—strange to relate—as Mimi's
consumption set in Miss Amara's
singing and acting gradually came
to life.
A New Face
Mexican tenor Placido
Domingo, presumably lazing
about in the midst of the Met
strike, made his S.F. debut in
place of an ailing Ludovic Spiess.
He made an immediate hit with
his sturdy voice and an obvious
attachment to the lyric
romanticism of Rodolfo's part.
Margot Moser acted the shrill
coquette Musetta to the hilt but,
alas, allowed shrillness to creep
into her vocalism as well.
Ara Berberian, Allan Monk and
James Farrar completed the
rumbustious quartet of
bohemiams in high style,
indicating that the male roster this
season has excellence in depth as
well as at the very top.
Jean Perisson, changing from
the heady Blanc de Blanc of the
previous night's Debussy to
Puccini's more down-to-earth
chianti, conducted the opera
along more elegant lines than one
is accustomed to. His restraint was
quite welcome.
(Pelleas et Melisande will be
repeated Nov. 22; La Boheme on
Nov. 28).

with impressive fortitude and
achieved a good effect of
ponderous decrepitude. Margot
'Moser failed to invest the part of
Golaud's young boy Yniold with
the childishness of voice so vital
to the father-son interview.
Massive Symbols
The production itself
undermines the opera, perhaps
because it rather simplemindedly
tries to match Maeterlinck's
massive symbolism with massive
symbols (15-foot thrones, a great
circle of briars). As well, there was
too much openness in the settings,
and this inevitably detracted from
the oppressive closeness and
coldness which should visually
complement the sense of
emotional claustrophobia which
pervades Pelleas.
The scrim has been a financial
God-send for the opera, and it was
often and effectively used. Still, a
scrim is a scrim, and (like
naughahyde and imitation ice
cream) cannot be appreciated as
much as the real thing. Other
liberties taken in this production
were not well taken, e.g. using the
sea-cave for gloom-choked
underground vaults of the castle.
I may bruise the sensibilities of
a few effete snobs for saying this,
but I do believe Pelleas should be

performed in English. The opera is
remote enough as it is; there is no
need great enough to put the
Atlantic Ocean as well between
singers and audience.

Puccini's La Boheme probably
comes closer to the temperament
of San Francisco than any other
opera: it is so genuinely cheerful
on the outside and so
heart-breakingly sad and diseased
on the inside.
And fittingly, the Opera's
production of the opera is hearty,
honestly sentimental )a la Herb
Caen), and visually satisfying. The
Latin Quarter scene is a highlight
of its entire repertory. But I have
already commented upon the
visual pleasantries and solid stage
direction of this production. I
wish merely to footnote here my
impressions of the current cast.
The sentimentality of the opera
was enhanced by the return of a
home-town girl who went on to
greater houses (like the Met).
Lucine Amara is getting along in
years, and she sang the first act
very close to the bodice.
But—strange to relate—as Mimi's
consumption set in Miss Amara's
singing and acting gradually came
to life.
A New Face
Mexican tenor Placido
Domingo, presumably lazing
about in the midst of the Met
strike, made his S.F. debut in
place of an ailing Ludovic Spiess.
He made an immediate hit with
his sturdy voice and an obvious
attachment to the lyric
romanticism of Rodolfo's part.
Margot Moser acted the shrill
coquette Musetta to the hilt but,
alas, allowed shrillness to creep
into her vocalism as well.
Ara Berberian, Allan Monk and
James Farrar completed the
rumbustious quartet of
bohemiams in high style,
indicating that the male roster this
season has excellence in depth as
well as at the very top.
Jean Perisson, changing from
the heady Blanc de Blanc of the
previous night's Debussy to
Puccini's more down-to-earth
chianti, conducted the opera
along more elegant lines than one
is accustomed to. His restraint was
quite welcome.
(Pelleas et Melisande will be
repeated Nov. 22; La Boheme on
Nov. 28).
It was a hard day's night at the
Opera House for the premiere of
Debussy's lone opera, Pelleas et
Melisande. While the evening was
musically successful, the
production did little to mitigate
the inaccessibility of this strange
opera.
As did Beethoven in Fidelio,
Debussy bent the operatic
music-form to his own unique
aesthetic in Pelleas. The result is a
thoroughly Debussy-esque musical
experience; the composer bathes
the senses in a lush impressionism
which seeps into the emotional
underground as if by osmosis.
This achievement might seem
auspicious, but it perhaps is just
this visceral (rather than
intellectual) potency which makes
Pelleas such an esoteric
masterpiece. The blend of
Debussy's atomizing
impressionism and Maeterlinck's
oppressive, monolithic
symbolism—though frequently
and fervently praised—may simply
be too heady a mixture for the
usual audience. Too scrupulous an
attempt to piece all the
mysterious elements of the opera
could easily lead to a slight sense
of mal de mer.
Glassy-eyed Boredom
Glassy-eyed boredom, however,
probably took an even larger toll,
since in this opera Debussy cuts
the audience adrift from its usual
morrings of hummable melodies,
set-piece numbers and
run-of-the-mill emotional
experiences.

Still, the person who enjoys
Debussy would have had a
pleasant evening. Debussy was a
master of the exotic and could
capture the other worldly
perspective of our worldly
existence; this is precisely what
his Pelleas accomplishes. Debussy
often turned his visual acuity
upon nature (La Mer, Nocturnes);
in this opera he takes a lingering,
mordant look at the quality of
man's existence.
Conductor Jean Perisson'skeen
affinity to the temperament of
Pelleas was communicated to the
orchestra with no apparent loss,
and the cast performed capably.
No astounding voices were
revealed (no really astounding
singing required), though Frantz
Petri (as Golaud) and Henri Gui
(as Pelleas) made creditable
American debuts. Both presented
rugged, Jacques Brel-like figures.
Jeannette Pilou sang the rather
thankless role of Melisande, who
seems to be perpetually
sad—always focusing nearsightedly
on her destiny. Miss Pilou pinned
down nicely Melisande's
distracted ennui.
Giorgio Tozzi sang the old
amateur-philosopher King Arkel
with impressive fortitude and
achieved a good effect of
ponderous decrepitude. Margot
'Moser failed to invest the part of

strike, made his S.F. debut in
place of an ailing Ludovic Spiess.
He made an immediate hit with
his sturdy voice and an obvious
attachment to the lyric
romanticism of Rodolfo's part.
Margot Moser acted the shrill
coquette Musetta to the hilt but,
alas, allowed shrillness to creep
into her vocalism as well.
Ara Berberian, Allan Monk and
James Farrar completed the
rumbustious quartet of
bohemiams in high style,
indicating that the male roster this
season has excellence in depth as
well as at the very top.
Jean Perisson, changing from
the heady Blanc de Blanc of the
previous night's Debussy to
Puccini's more down-to-earth
chianti, conducted the opera
along more elegant lines than one
is accustomed to. His restraint was
quite welcome.
(Pelleas et Melisande will be
repeated Nov. 22; La Boheme on
Nov. 28).
It was a hard day's night at the
Opera House for the premiere of
Debussy's lone opera, Pelleas et
Melisande. While the evening was
musically successful, the
production did little to mitigate
the inaccessibility of this strange
opera.
As did Beethoven in Fidelio,
Debussy bent the operatic
music-form to his own unique
aesthetic in Pelleas. The result is a
thoroughly Debussy-esque musical
experience; the composer bathes
the senses in a lush impressionism
which seeps into the emotional
underground as if by osmosis.
This achievement might seem
auspicious, but it perhaps is just
this visceral (rather than
intellectual) potency which makes
Pelleas such an esoteric
masterpiece. The blend of
Debussy's atomizing
impressionism and Maeterlinck's
oppressive, monolithic
symbolism—though frequently
and fervently praised—may simply
be too heady a mixture for the
usual audience. Too scrupulous an
attempt to piece all the
mysterious elements of the opera
could easily lead to a slight sense
of mal de mer.
Glassy-eyed Boredom
Glassy-eyed boredom, however,
probably took an even larger toll,
since in this opera Debussy cuts
the audience adrift from its usual
morrings of hummable melodies,
set-piece numbers and
run-of-the-mill emotional
experiences.

Still, the person who enjoys
Debussy would have had a
pleasant evening. Debussy was a
master of the exotic and could
capture the other worldly
perspective of our worldly
existence; this is precisely what
his Pelleas accomplishes. Debussy
often turned his visual acuity
upon nature (La Mer, Nocturnes);
in this opera he takes a lingering,
mordant look at the quality of
man's existence.
Conductor Jean Perisson'skeen
affinity to the temperament of
Pelleas was communicated to the
orchestra with no apparent loss,
and the cast performed capably.
No astounding voices were
revealed (no really astounding
singing required), though Frantz
Petri (as Golaud) and Henri Gui
(as Pelleas) made creditable
American debuts. Both presented
rugged, Jacques Brel-like figures.
Jeannette Pilou sang the rather
thankless role of Melisande, who
seems to be perpetually
sad—always focusing nearsightedly
on her destiny. Miss Pilou pinned
down nicely Melisande's
distracted ennui.
Giorgio Tozzi sang the old
amateur-philosopher King Arkel
with impressive fortitude and
achieved a good effect of
ponderous decrepitude. Margot
'Moser failed to invest the part of
Golaud's young boy Yniold with
the childishness of voice so vital
to the father-son interview.
Massive Symbols
The production itself
undermines the opera, perhaps
because it rather simplemindedly
tries to match Maeterlinck's
massive symbolism with massive
symbols (15-foot thrones, a great
circle of briars). As well, there was
too much openness in the settings,
and this inevitably detracted from
the oppressive closeness and
coldness which should visually
complement the sense of
emotional claustrophobia which
pervades Pelleas.
The scrim has been a financial
God-send for the opera, and it was
often and effectively used. Still, a
scrim is a scrim, and (like
naughahyde and imitation ice
cream) cannot be appreciated as
much as the real thing. Other
liberties taken in this production
were not well taken, e.g. using the
sea-cave for gloom-choked
underground vaults of the castle.
I may bruise the sensibilities of
a few effete snobs for saying this,
but I do believe Pelleas should be

performed in English. The opera is
remote enough as it is; there is no
need great enough to put the
Atlantic Ocean as well between
singers and audience.

Puccini's La Boheme probably
comes closer to the temperament
of San Francisco than any other
opera: it is so genuinely cheerful
on the outside and so
heart-breakingly sad and diseased
on the inside.
And fittingly, the Opera's
production of the opera is hearty,
honestly sentimental )a la Herb
Caen), and visually satisfying. The
Latin Quarter scene is a highlight
of its entire repertory. But I have
already commented upon the
visual pleasantries and solid stage
direction of this production. I
wish merely to footnote here my
impressions of the current cast.
The sentimentality of the opera
was enhanced by the return of a
home-town girl who went on to
greater houses (like the Met).
Lucine Amara is getting along in
years, and she sang the first act
very close to the bodice.
But—strange to relate—as Mimi's
consumption set in Miss Amara's
singing and acting gradually came
to life.
A New Face
Mexican tenor Placido
Domingo, presumably lazing

strike, made his S.F. debut in
