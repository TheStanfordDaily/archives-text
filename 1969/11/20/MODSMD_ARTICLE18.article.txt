# Big Plans Underfoot For Marching Band
## 
### DANA GIOIA 
There is no other group on
campus or in the Pacific Eight
universities that can compare to
them. In terms of spirit,
creativity, and accomplishment,
no band can compare with the
Incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB).
The group has the reputation
of presenting the most original
halftime shows in the nation.
Providing an insight in the creative
process involved in these halftime
shows, Band announcer Hal
Michelson, credited the "SMUT
sessions" run by the Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers.
Senior Nick Waser summed up
what appears to be the general
attitude of the band. "It is the
finest organization on campus in
terms of having fun and
accomplishing things."
"Grossness and pranks are a
pretty good measure of the
creativity of a group," he added.
"Our Band is extremely creative."
Big Game Week
The high point of LSJUMB
activities is upon us with Big
Game Week. The tremendous
rivalry between the Stanford band
and the Berkeley band (known as
Kal) has led to many memorable
RF's.
Among the impressive string of
spirit-raising activities during this
week, the annual "informal"
parade in San Francisco draws the
most enthusiastic response.
Three years ago, 110
fully-dressed bandsmen stopped in
front of Yvonne D'Angers' Off
Broadway topless club and began

playing "The Stripper." After
repeating the song three times,
Wendy and Yvonne, avowed to be
the club's two most attractive
employees, came out and obliged
them.
Yvonne had earlier sent the
Band a picture post card
requesting that the Band "come
up and visit some time." Needless
to say, the trip has become one of
the Band's strongest traditions.
Not to be outdone, last year's
Band went onto the Berkeley
campus and held a Stanford rally.
They occupied the steps of Sproul
Hall for over an hour, entertaining
the crowd with great music, until
the police spotted them as
"off-campus agitators."
Infiltration Exercise
The most impressive stunt
occured last year when an
unidentified LSJUMB member
infiltrated the Kal band.
Assuming the identity of a
mild-mannered transfer student
for a mid-western university, the
student managed to get a
scholarship and was given free
room and board.
After three days of intensive
spying, he returned to Stanford
loaded down with Berkeley
property, including marching
formations and uniforms.
Leadership
The Band is entirely
student-run, with director Arthur
Barnes and his assistant Glen
Daum arranging most of the
music. Charlie Carrera manages
the Band, with an iron hand in a
velvet glove, while Drum Major
Geordie Lawry prefers the iron
glove and the velvet hand.
