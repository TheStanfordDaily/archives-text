# Junior Rooters
## Kids Make Energetic Fans 
### SUSAN MAAS 
The Jr. Rooters Section at
Stanford football games—alias the
"kiddie section" is a fun group to
watch. And Sherm Thurston,
leader of the section, is fun to
watch too.
Anyone who can control

several hundred kids, and also lead
them in cheers, has to be either
slightly insane or extremely
courageous. Thurston, however,
seems saner than many Stanford
students.
In ten years of leading the
section, he can only remember
missing one game—that was to
participate in the November 15
Peace March in San Francisco.
The Junior Indian Rooter
Section is run by the Palo Alto
YMCA for third through fifth
graders in the area. For one dollar
the kids nre allowed to attend all
home games, except for the Big
Game which is separate and costs
three dollars.
Loyal Indian Fans
"The kids are very loyal,"
Thurston commented. "However,
adults are needed to watch them
and quell small insurrections. My
job is to try to keep the attention
of the kids of what's going on."
He seems to be fairly successful
at this, for the Junior Rooters
form one of the most enthusiastic
cheering blocks at the game. The
section is characterized by
motion. The kids are far too
energetic to hold still. A few boys
always seem to be playing tag, or
trying to find seats outside the
section, much to the supervisors'
frustration.
For food vendors, the section is
a veritable heaven on earth. They
dot the area like spots on a
Dalmation, selling their products
to the eager young consumers.
Although Thurston was absent
last Saturday, his substitute, Gene
Haynes, was on the job. Facing
the cold in a red shirl and white
cut-offs, he nevertheless managed
to appear enthusiastic.
"Compared to what they used

to be, the kids are becoming much
more responsible," Thurston
noted. "I think one reason is the
inclusion of girls. They seem to be
a civilizing force."
Why did Sherm Thurston get
involved in such a job? "One
requirement is to like kids," he
smiled. "I'm interested in helping
kids learn how to function as
good citizens in large groups," he
added. "The price you have to
pay to enjoy a football game is to
conform. The place to be
individualistic is in areas of your
life where it's important."
In real life, Thurston is Club
Director of Oak Creek Club, a
recreational program for the Oak
Creek Apartments. Eventually he
intends to go back to working in
the YMCA.
Views On Peace March
He is also very interested in
politics, and eager to talk about it.
Reacting to a statement by a
friend that peace marches are
sheeplike, Thurston stated, "A
peace march is a diverse group of
individuals. It is highly
individualistic."
"I'm concerned about whether
large mass demonstrations are
effective means of changing
people's minds," he added. "This
door-to-door contact is what
changes people's minds."
Thurston saw no conflict
between enjoyment of football
and having a social conscience. "A
football game is a healthy,
wholesome form of distraction,"
he said.
Now, howcv.r, Thurston is
thinking of handing the job on to
someone new. "It's a rather
thankless job, although it has its
rewards," he commented, "and I
think I've been in long enough."
