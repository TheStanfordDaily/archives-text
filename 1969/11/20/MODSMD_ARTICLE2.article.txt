## Hoover: Semi-Autonomy 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON (Last of a series) 
The Hoover Institution enjoys
an anamoious relationship in the
University. Unlike academic
departments Hoover does not
report to the Provost. Rather the
chain of command goes directly
to the President.
Further Hoover staff
appointments have not been
subject to the usual screening
procedures for academic
personnel. This has not always
been the case and there are
indications that Hoover is coming
into a closer working relationship
with the rest of the University.
As was mentioned in an earlier
article Hoover in its early years
was in many ways an off-spring of
the history department. As
recently as 1958 the Hoover
director functioned, in the words
of a Board of Trustees resolution,
"in a manner similar to
department heads throughout the
University."
In 1959 the Board of Trustees'
resolution was repealed and a
different set of operating rules
established. Concurrent with the
repeal was the appointment of the
present director, W. Glenn
Campbell, who set about
encouraging the growth of the
Institution that has been reported
in earlier articles.
Campbell's Free Hand
Campbell was operating under a
freer hand than earlier directors,
being responsible to the President
directly. One of Campbell's major
innovations was the establishment
of a sizeable research staff. These
researchers usually did not have
academic appointments. This sort
of arrangement naturally grated
the nerves of many faculty
members. It still does.
Not only were the appointees

often conservative, but the very
existence of a research operation
within the University but not
within the control of the faculty
did not sit well.
Regular faculty members have
to go through a thorough
screening process prior to
appointment and promotion,
particularly to any tenured
positions. The exact arrangements
have varied but usually a faculty
committee reporting to the
Provost has to approve actions
taken by individual departments.
The approval is not pro forma and
actions are occasionally vetoed by
the screening committee. Hoover
appointees have not in recent
years had to go through this
process.
Rightward Drift
The gulf between Hoover and
the rest of the University has
sometimes been attributed to the
rightward drift of Hoover or the
leftward drift of the University.
There is probably validity in both
attributions. What is signigicant is
that moves are under way to
achieve some sort of detente
between the faculty and Hoover.
The appointment of Kenneth
Pitzer to the University
presidency last year provided an
opportunity for a change in the
working relationship. The
necessity for change was clear in
the minds of many as indicated by
Pitzer in August, 1968, four days
after his appointment as
president. At that time Pitzer said
the relationship between Hoover
and the University was one of the
first things he would be looking
at.
The Hoover-University
relationship was apparently the
subject of study during the
1968-69 academic year, for in
September of this year President

Pitzer and Campbell made a joint
statement of appointment
procedures at Hoover.
The statement attempts to skirt
around the wording of the
Trustees' resolution of 1959
which said no faculty committee
would be involved in Hoover
appointments. Specifically, the
Pitzer-Campbell statement says
that future appointments of
senior Hoover staff (not including
senior fellows) would be made
under recommendations of a
search committee made up of
both Hoover staffers and
University faculty. Formally, the
search committee will recommend
two or more candidates to the
director who will choose one and
submit both his choice and the
search committee
recommendations to the
president.
Senior Fellows Controversy
Much of the controversy
concerning Hoover has centered
on the Senior Fellows, who have
been accused of having a definite
conservative bias. The
Pitzer-Campbell agreement does
not provide for faculty
consultation in the search for new
Senior Fellows but the agreement
does state that the present Senior
Fellows shall participate in the
selection of new appointees.
The Director of Hoover will
then present his recommendation
to the President who "will
normally seek advice concerning
the quality of (the proposed
fellow's) scholarship from
appropriate leaders in the field of
research of the candidate, either
within the Stanford community
or elsewhere, before reaching his
decision."
The Stanford faculty would
presumably have a voice in the
selection process at this juncture.

How effective these new
procedures will prove is uncertain.
The prior arrangement had
provided for approval by the
president of all appointments, but
this approval apparently was only
a formality.
The aim of the new
arrangement is set forth in the
following exerpt from the joint
statement: "In a responsible way,
the University community,
including faculty and
administration, can be involved in
the appointment process for those
positions of critical interest to the
academic community both on this
campus and elsewhere."
Another area of growing
integration between Hoover and
the faculty may prove to be in the
area of joint appointments.
Currently, several Hoover staffers
teach freshman seminars and
senior colloquia.
In addition, some Hoover
people are listed as lecturers in a
couple departments. Dual
appointments are still rare,
though. The most senior dual
appointment is that of history
professor William C. Bark. The
Hoover appointment, though,
came after his joining the
Stanford faculty.
Cold War Thaw
The best way to sum up the
Hoover-University relationship is
to say that there has been a thaw
in their cold war but no formal
alliances have really been
controlled.
Director Campbell is careful to
say that "the general climate is
good at the present time," but it
is clear that he fears the divisions
of the past may some day
reappear. The faculty's position
seems to be one of watchful
waiting.
