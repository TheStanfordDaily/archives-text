# 13 Seniors Bow Out
## 
### FRED MANN 
Thirteen seniors will wind up
their Stanford careers Saturday in
the 72nd annual Big Game against
California.
It is not a particularly large
number of graduates for Stanford
this year, but their leaving will be
severely crippling. Eleven of the
13 are starters.
The seniors include running
backs Bubba Brown and Howie
Williams, end Jim Cross, and
offensive linemen Dave Sharp,
Pete Seymour, George Crooks,
and Bob Rein hard. Also leaving
will be the Indians' great
linebackers Don Parish and Pat
Preston.
Although the defensive line will
remain in tact for next season, the
deep secondary will be missing
Rich Keller, Dick Oliver, Mike
Carrigan, and Brian Porter.
Although the losses will be
great, they're not gone yet.
California still awaits, for the the
simple reason that it is Big Game,
a contest that seemingly will be
no contest at all could turn into a
close one.
Favorites are notoriously
beatable in this event, and
Stanford is a big favorite. The
Bears are 5-4 this year with losses
to Texas (17-0), UCLA (32-0),
USC (14-9), and Oregon State
(35-3).
Ray Willsey's team had to come
from behind to beat weak
opponents from Rice and San
Jose State, and really only showed
offensive power against Indiana
(17-14), Washington State (17-0),
and winless Washington (44-13).
The Big Game series usually
runs in streaks. Stanford has won
seven of the last eight, and Cal
won 10 of 14 prior to that. Coach
John Ralston has five wins in six
tries against his old Alma Mater,
the best coaching record of any
Stanford mentor in Big Game
history.
With a couple of breaks for the
Tribe, Saturday's game could
literally have been the "Big
Game." A solid blocking wall in
the last second of the UCLA
game—another three inches closer
to Greg Fenner in the Purdue end
zone on the two-point conversion
with two minutes left—any
number of things against USC—all

would have added up to a 9-0
record.
The Rose Bowl would be
decided in Palo Alto instead of
Los Angeles. But Stanford is used
to a lot of "ifs." They always
come close.
California will be trying for a
winning season with a victory
here, and their chances are not as
bad as it might seem.

The Bear pass defense is rated
second in the Pac-8, and they are
the only team to allow less than
100 passes to be completed
against them (88).
The Indians have been working
on pass offense and defense all
week, and Ralston termed
yesterday's practice "a good
spirited workout in which we
were able to set our initial plans
for California."

A massive list of minor injuries
was released earlier this week, but
Ralston expressed hope that
Stanford would be at full strength
for the final game.
Dave Grossi and Greg Simpson
worked out for the first time since
their auto accident two weeks
ago. Deep back Dick Oliver was
held out of the drills with a
painful sprained ankle. He is the
only doubtful participant.

second in the Pac-8, and they are
the only team to allow less than
100 passes to be completed
against them (88).
The Indians have been working
on pass offense and defense all
week, and Ralston termed
yesterday's practice "a good
spirited workout in which we
were able to set our initial plans
for California."

A massive list of minor injuries
was released earlier this week, but
Ralston expressed hope that
Stanford would be at full strength
for the final game.
Dave Grossi and Greg Simpson
worked out for the first time since
their auto accident two weeks
ago. Deep back Dick Oliver was
held out of the drills with a
painful sprained ankle. He is the
only doubtful participant.

end assumes Yoga position
number two while attempting to
catch pass against the Air Force.
The catch was not successful, but
the game was. Saturday, the
California Golden Bears will
square off with the Tribe for the
72nd time, and Stanford is a 14
point favorite. Game time is 1:30
p.m.
Thirteen seniors will wind up
their Stanford careers Saturday in
the 72nd annual Big Game against
California.
It is not a particularly large
number of graduates for Stanford
this year, but their leaving will be
severely crippling. Eleven of the
13 are starters.
The seniors include running
backs Bubba Brown and Howie
Williams, end Jim Cross, and
offensive linemen Dave Sharp,
Pete Seymour, George Crooks,
and Bob Rein hard. Also leaving
will be the Indians' great
linebackers Don Parish and Pat
Preston.
Although the defensive line will
remain in tact for next season, the
deep secondary will be missing
Rich Keller, Dick Oliver, Mike
Carrigan, and Brian Porter.
Although the losses will be
great, they're not gone yet.
California still awaits, for the the
simple reason that it is Big Game,
a contest that seemingly will be
no contest at all could turn into a
close one.
Favorites are notoriously
beatable in this event, and
Stanford is a big favorite. The
Bears are 5-4 this year with losses
to Texas (17-0), UCLA (32-0),
USC (14-9), and Oregon State
(35-3).
Ray Willsey's team had to come
from behind to beat weak
opponents from Rice and San
Jose State, and really only showed
offensive power against Indiana
(17-14), Washington State (17-0),
and winless Washington (44-13).
The Big Game series usually
runs in streaks. Stanford has won
seven of the last eight, and Cal
won 10 of 14 prior to that. Coach
John Ralston has five wins in six
tries against his old Alma Mater,
the best coaching record of any
Stanford mentor in Big Game
history.
With a couple of breaks for the
Tribe, Saturday's game could
literally have been the "Big
Game." A solid blocking wall in
the last second of the UCLA
game—another three inches closer
to Greg Fenner in the Purdue end
zone on the two-point conversion
with two minutes left—any
number of things against USC—all

would have added up to a 9-0
record.
The Rose Bowl would be
decided in Palo Alto instead of
Los Angeles. But Stanford is used
to a lot of "ifs." They always
come close.
California will be trying for a
winning season with a victory
here, and their chances are not as
bad as it might seem.

second in the Pac-8, and they are
the only team to allow less than
100 passes to be completed
against them (88).
