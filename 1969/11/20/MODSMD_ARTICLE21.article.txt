# Journalists Vie In Ink Classic

### HARRY BONANZA 
THE STANFORD DAILY has been installed as a 13-point
underdog for Saturday morning's annual Ink Bowl football game
against the DAILY CALIFORNIAN.
Jimmy The Greek had originally refused to take odds on the
contest, feeling that the Berkeley squad was so superior, the final
score would be absurd. He changed his mind however when studying
the STANFORD DAILY game films.
The game is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on the Stanford lacrosse field
next to Maples Pavilion. Crowds of up to 35,000 can not truthfully be
expected.
Head Coach and General Manager of the DAILY team, Fred Mann,
has not yet revealed the starting lineup for fear of scaring the Cal team
away.
"We will be awesome," said Mann, slowly puffing his cigar,
carefully choosing his words and playing the role of coach to the hilt.
"Offensively, we will be able to score from anywhere on the field.
Right now, last year's starting quarterback, Dave Jones, has the inside
track for the top job.
"Mamoth lineman Marshall Schwartz is busily keeping his weight
up for the game, and secret weapon Felicity Barringer will be used in
tight yardage situtions."
The DAILY has lost the services of sports-phenom John Arthur
who is on the disabled list. He will file a brilliant game story for
Monday's DAILY.
With the now-famous Big Game jinx in consideration, considerable
interest has been awakened in the DAILY office. Coach Mann is
having trouble cutting the squad down to the 46-man limit.
"With the blazing speed of Marshall Kilduff, the spirited leadership
of Mark Weinberger, the witty commentary of Craig Wilson, the
staggering size of Pat McMahon, and the mere presence of Julie
Fleece, we can't lose â€”at least not badly."
When questioned about the possible outcome of the game, Mann
recited, "We play them one at a time, and we expect a real battle out
there. We'll be pounding leather with the best of them, and I'm real
proud of our team. The boys are primed for a real test. Gosh darn,
they're a heckuva team."
