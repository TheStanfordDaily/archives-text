Leaders of the Vietnam
Moratorium at Stanford yesterday
condemned a Justice Department
investigation of the New
Mobilization Committee as "yet
another attempt by the
Administration to intimidate
those who protest U.S.
involvement in the Vietnam war."
In a letter to Deputy Attorney
General Richard G. Kleindienst,
they said, "Your attempt to link
members of the New Mobilization
Committee with the disruption
caused by a small group having no
association with the Washington
march poses an obvious threat to
any individual who takes part in
organizing demonstrations of
protest.
"We refuse to be intimidated
bv such threats."

On Tuesday, Kleindienst said
the Justice Department was
investigating "some members" of
the New Mobilization
Committee's steering committee
for possible felony indictments
under the 1968 anti-riot law.
The Stanford group said the
NMC's achievements "in providing
a constructive channel for dissent
should have been praised rather
than condemned by a government
agency charged with protecting
the Constitutional rights of all
Americans."
Inviting the Justice Department
to investigate the Stanford
Moratorium, the group said "the
constitutional rights of all
Americans are in jeopardy when
those of a few are challenged."
The letter was drafted by
faculty wife Mrs. Rachelle

Marshall, "I read the morning
paper, and I was shocked to see
the Justice Department
investigating the Student
Mobilization Committee. I think
it's just one more indication of
their whittling away of our
constitutional rights. Nothing may
come of it, but I think we've got
to be very much on the alert
against the Justice Department
under Mitchell."
John Kramer, another member
of the group, said that a concerted
effort will be made today to get
the letter around. Early signers of
the letter included Mrs. Marshall,
Kramer, Mrs. Freida Wallin, Mrs.
Margaret Stein, Dr. Martin
Perlman of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, and students
Robert Clark, Barton Richardson,
and Jonathan Mittleman.
