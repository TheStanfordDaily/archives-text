SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP)-Safe at home base again,
America's moon explorers closed
the hatch of the moonship
Intrepid on the adventure of a
lifetime Thursday, laden with
treasure from a mile-long trek of
the lonely lunar landscape.
Before they left, Charles
Conrad .Jr. apologized, "I'm sure
sorry the television didn't work
It's a beautiful sight to see
Intrepid and Surveyor sitting here
on this crater."
Surveyor, a dead U.S. moon
probe that landed there 2'/j years
ago, was one of the prime, but
last, targets of the second
moonwalk of the day.
On the second excursion
Conrad hit the surface first, at
11:01 p.m., EST, more than 1 Vi
hours earlier than planned.

Crewmate Alan L. Bean followed
him 10 minutes later.
Back on the exciting lunar
surface again, Conrad began
talking about the cables and
devices below. "They are
constantly under foot," he said.
At this sun angle, Conrad said,
the moon dirt around Intrepid has
a brownish tone, like a
well-ploughed field. Elsewhere it
was an expanse of light ashen
gray.
Their orders were to collect dirt
samples from six craters, the
farthest 1,500 feet away and to
cut off pieces of equipment from
Surveyor for return to earth.
They cut away their own
television camera for return home
and then set out for the
northwest, their first stop at the
instruments they had installed
earlier,
