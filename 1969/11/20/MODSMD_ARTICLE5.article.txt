# Glaser Resigning, Joins Foundation
## 
### 
Dr. Robert J. Glaser, vice
president for medical affairs and
dean of the medical school, has
resigned to take a position with a
New York philanthropic
foundation, it was announced
yesterday.
Glaser will become vice
president of the Commonwealth
Fund effective September 1,
1970. The Fund is one of the
country's principal foundations
concerned with health
opportunity in America. He has
been a Fund director since May.
"I've had mixed feelings about
leaving," Glaser told THF DAILY.
"I have had a marvelous time and
great associations here," but was
"excited by new opportunities."
The reaction to Glaser's
announcement was regret by both
administration and students.
Glaser was an active acting
president of the University during
the fall, 1968, before Dr. Kenneth
S. Pitzer was chosen.
Patrick Shea, a member of the
ASSU Presidential quadumvirate,
said Glaser "will be sorely missed
as a fighter for change within the
University."
Pitzer's Praise
Pitzer said: "Under his
leadership, the School of Medicine
continued to advance its standing
as a foremost center of research,
educational innovation, and
experimentation in health care."
Glaser, leading the Medical
School since 1965, began and
successfully completed the
disengagement of the City of Palo
Alto from joint ownership of the
Stanford Hospital.
Pitzer announced that an
"administrative council" would
assist Glaser and continue to serve
in his absence until a new dean is
appointed.
Administrative Council
Administrative council
members will be Dr. Robert A.
Chase, professor and chairman,
Department of Surgery; Dr. David
Hamburg, professor and chairman,
Department of Psychiatry; Dr.
Halsted Holman, professor and
chairman, Medicine; and Nobel
Laureate Joshua Lederberg,
professor and chairman, Genetics.
Dr. Paul Berg, professor and
acting chairman, Biochemistry, is
being asked to serve, but is
presently in Europe.
As acting president in summer
and fall, 1968, Glaser was praised
in a resolution by the student
legislature for his "outstanding
administration" and for meeting
student concerns with "human
understanding, deep personal
concern, and prompt action."
In 1968-69 he served as
president of the Association of

American Medical Colleges and is
a member of the National
Academy of Sciences.
Science Task Force
Recently, Glaser was appointed
to the Task Force on Science
Policy, established by President
Nixon, to prepare
recommendations for the future
development of the federal
government's role in science
affairs.
Glaser's term as head of the
medical school also saw the
adoption of a new flexible
medical curriculum, a program for
increasing minority enrollment in
the Medical School, and the
appointment of key faculty
members.
Dr. Glaser, 51, was educated in
the public schools of St. Louis

and University City, Missouri. He
received his A.B. degree at
Harvard in 1940, and his M.D.
magna cum laude there in 1943.
After serving his internship and
residency at the Barnes Hospital
and the Peter Bent Brigham
Hospital, he rose steadily through
the ranks at Washington
University in St. Louis where he
served as associate dean of the
Medical School from 1955 to
1957.
He then moved to the
University of Colorado as dean of
the School of Medicine, becoming
vice-president for medical affairs
before moving to Boston to
become President of the Affiliated
Hospitals Center and professor of
social medicine at Harvard
Medical School.


the Medical School announced his
resignation yesterday to accept a
post with the Commonwealth
Fund.
