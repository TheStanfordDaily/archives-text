# 'He Got To Issues, It Was Refreshing'

Stanford University is losing one of its few no-nonsense
administrators.
At 51, Bob Glaser leaves not only Stanford, but university life, to
become vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, a non-profit
medical and health foundation.
"I am taking on a new role that appeals to me at this time in my
life," Glaser said yesterday afternoon. "I will have certain
opportunities that are different than operating withing a single
medical school operation."
The new post will give him a chance to take leave of the
"administrative role" in medicine which he has held here and
previously at Harvard, Colorado, and Washington universities, he said.
During the summer and fall, 1968, Glaser was acting president
between Sterling and Pitzer eras. It was then that he gained his
university-wide reputation for aggressive and forthright efforts for
change.
No Place for Status Quo
He told the Class of 1972 at its convocation that fall, "There is no
place for the status quo. Change is often not easy even when it is in
order or, indeed, overdue."
Taking student leaders by surprise, Acting President Glaser asked
them at an early encounter, "I'll only be here for a short time, but
what can I do while I'm here?"
And later he showed up at a meeting of the student legislature to
talk about the Stanford Research Institute and answer questions. It
was a precedent-shattering event, once again, winning over dubious
students.
Glaser made every attempt to have an "open" administration. "The
one thing I hope to do is try to see if we can't get a more meaningful
exchange between students, faculty, administrators, and trustees," he
told THE DAILY when he began. It was more of a reality when he
had finished his brief term.
Relating to trustee-types as well as to students, he encouraged
understanding of each party by the other and brought trustees to
dinner and for more meetings on campus. "He has a tremendous clout
with the Board of Trustees and their peer group and will be sorely
missed," notes Patrick Shea, member of the ASSIJ Presidential
quartet.
'He Spared The Niceties'
Students recall how he would beat on his desk with his cane,
amazed at some bureaucratic gaffe or intricate triviality that had
found its way to his desk. "He spared the niceties. We got right to the
problem and the issues and grappled. It was refreshing," remembers
one student.
Near the end of his term as acting president, he confessed that he
was anxious to get back to the medical school. Recalling modestly his
tour of duty as president, he says"I have no illusions about what I
did; I was just filling in. I enjoyed most getting to know
undergraduates with whom I'd never had much contact before."
One year later, Glaser is dropping out of the university to attack
real world problems from a different perspective.
Commonwealth Fund president Quigg Newton notes in announcing
Glaser's election to he post: "Dr. Glaser brings to the Fund a
background of exceptional leadership and accomplishment.
"His experience and insights, together with his imagination and
energy, are certain to enhance the Fund's potential for dealing with
the grave crisis confronting the country's health and medical
enterprise."
So the Commonwealth Fund has found Bob Glaser at a time in his
life when his "basic interest in medicine" takes on a new focus.
