# Conservation Committee
## State Hearing Here 
### 
The problem of solid waste
disposal in California will be the
topic of hearings here today and
tomorrow before the California
Assembly Committee on Natural
Resources and Conservation.
"If public policy does not come
to grips with the problem," Milias
warned, "sewage wastes will more
than double, solid wastes will
increase fourfold and radioactive
wastes will become a serious
problem as nuclear power
production begins in many areas
of the state." Committee
Chairman George Milias
(R-Oilroy) announced.
"The time has come," he said,
"for the state in cooperation with
local government and the private
sector to develop a comprehensive
solid waste management policy
which can cope with the
increasing tide of solid wastes and
protect the public health and
quality of the California
environment."
Dr. Louis F. Say lor, State
Public Health Director and one of
the hearing's 28 witnesses, will
outline a recent statewide report
prepared by his department on
the problem. Mr. Donald Keagy,
Regional Director of the Federal
E 11 vi r on m en t a I Control
Administration, will report on the

federal responsibilities and
programs in the area of solid
waste management. Hearings will
begin this morning at 10 in the
Forum Room of Meyer Library.
The first of the committee's
four objectives is to study the
nature and extent of the solid
waste problem, in terms of
existing and projected annual
production in detailed categories
and regions. The second is to
study the economics, relative
effectiveness, and effects on
environment of proposals for
disposing of solid wastes.
The committee will determine
the responsibilities of federal,
state, and local government
programs, and try to form a
comprehensive state policy for
orderly, long-term management of
solid wastes in California.
The committee will also
consider what kinds of legislation
and standards are needed and how
they could be enforced.
A committee fact sheet states
traditional methods of disposal
are no longer feasible because of
increases in population
concentration, changes in
character of many consumer
goods from reusable to disposable
items, shortage of dump sites, and
the growing hazards of pollution.
