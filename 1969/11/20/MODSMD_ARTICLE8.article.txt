# Verbal Garbage
## Adjectival Ranting 
### Malcolm E. Wheeler 
Most of us have heard it said
that there often is little or no
difference between the political
left and the political right.
Perhaps the triteness of the
statement accounts for the fact
that so many persons seem to
disregard it in their choice of
words and actions. Pompous
though it may be to say so, my
purpose here is to bring the
foregoing phrase to the attention
of all those who have despaired of
and abandoned substantive
discussion in favor of adjectival
ranting and rhetoric, basically in
the hope that at least one person
will remember it before resorting
to adjectives or violence in the
future. Thus, although most of
the following concerns individuals
generally associated with the
political left, the sole reason for
this apparent bias is that this
writing was evoked by columns
concerning them in the DAILY on
November 14, 1969.
The most prominent example
of adjectival rhetoric with total
disregard of similarities between
left and right was provided by R.
Bonner in his article on
fascism/Alioto. Although he
admitted that he is "not an expert
on fascism," Mr. Bonner
nevertheless felt qualified to forge
boldly ahead to tell us about the
artibrary use of police as a
fascist phenomenon.
Before setting pen to paper, Mr.
Bonner should have discussed
Hungary with Hungarian refugees,
East Germany with East German
refugees, and Cuba with Cuban
refugees, inter alia. He should
have, at the least, read Dr.
Zhivatfo, if wading through
cumbersome tomes on the history
of the Russian revolution were
too bothersome. He should have
considered Stalin and Mao, or
even the most recent example,
Czechoslovakia. The point should
be clear: Police power is, has
been, and will be used end abused
be leftists, rightists, and
moderates, for all of them are
human beings. Our duty must be
to preserve our rights, our
freedom from such abuse, through
voting and other political
processes and by reasoning with
those in power to show them
where and why they are wrong.
It should also be recognized
that there will always be a
difference of opinion as to
whether any given instance
represents use or abuse, and this,
in turn, will usually reflect the
support of or the objection to the
particular law being enforced
(clearly, laws unobjected to can
be enforced in ways that are
objected to). This perpetual
difference must be kept in mind if
we are to limit our desire to take
matters into our own hands and
to abandon order and reason.
Misapplied Appelations
I suggest that, in the future, Mr.
Bonner refrain from the impulse
to place the onus of abused police
power on any historical group and
from labeling politicians with
misapplied appelations, and
concentrate instead on why he
views certain actions as abusive
and what he believes should and
can be done to prevent further

The second example in the
DAILY was provided by the
BSU/ARENA article. Although I
partially disagree with the
ARENA'S stand on the issues
raised therein, I find the BSU
individuals' responses much more
troubling. Rather than extensively
defending their position on the
merits so as to clarify matters for
a concerned (I hope) student
body, these individuals resorted to
adjectival rhetoric: "authoritarian,
fascist, yellow journalists .. .
crackers." In doing so, these
individuals missed the irony of the
situation: They with political
power are condemning those who
dissent, those who express a fear
of unrepresentative government!
What these politicians are
experiencing is the same feeling of
frustration, fear, and anger that
has been experienced by the many
state and federal officials they
have attacked even more strongly
for years. In neither case, on
neither side, has a cause been
aided by adjectival rhetoric.
Why Spiro?
The final example is Spiro
Agnew. For a few years now I
have listened to and read Eldridge
Cleaver, Rap Brown, Stanford
students, Mike Rudd, and others
call various people pigs, fuckers,
fascists, shits, bastards, and many
othe; names. Yet when one
official comes forth with
traditionally less offensive
adjectival rhetoric, he gets laughed
at as being articulate and stupid
for having to resort to such
language!
The world is a mess and getting
messier. There is garbage in the
streets, the air, the water, and the
laws. Let us at least try to keep
some of the garbage out of our
dissent and discussions. Perhaps
we can all begin by eschewing
adjectival rhetoric, concentrating
on similarities as well as
differences, seeking to understand
and build rather than hating and
destroying, both in actions and in
words.

raised therein, I find the BSU
individuals' responses much more
troubling. Rather than extensively
defending their position on the
merits so as to clarify matters for
a concerned (I hope) student
body, these individuals resorted to
adjectival rhetoric: "authoritarian,
fascist, yellow journalists .. .
crackers." In doing so, these
individuals missed the irony of the
situation: They with political
power are condemning those who
dissent, those who express a fear
of unrepresentative government!
What these politicians are
experiencing is the same feeling of
frustration, fear, and anger that
has been experienced by the many
state and federal officials they
have attacked even more strongly
for years. In neither case, on
neither side, has a cause been
aided by adjectival rhetoric.
Why Spiro?
The final example is Spiro
Agnew. For a few years now I
have listened to and read Eldridge
Cleaver, Rap Brown, Stanford
students, Mike Rudd, and others
call various people pigs, fuckers,
fascists, shits, bastards, and many
othe; names. Yet when one
official comes forth with
traditionally less offensive
adjectival rhetoric, he gets laughed
at as being articulate and stupid
for having to resort to such
language!
The world is a mess and getting
messier. There is garbage in the
streets, the air, the water, and the
laws. Let us at least try to keep
some of the garbage out of our
dissent and discussions. Perhaps
we can all begin by eschewing
adjectival rhetoric, concentrating
on similarities as well as
differences, seeking to understand
and build rather than hating and
destroying, both in actions and in
words.
(Malcolm E. Wheeler is a
graduate of the Stanford Law
School, Class of 1969.)
Most of us have heard it said
that there often is little or no
difference between the political
left and the political right.
Perhaps the triteness of the
statement accounts for the fact
that so many persons seem to
disregard it in their choice of
words and actions. Pompous
though it may be to say so, my
purpose here is to bring the
foregoing phrase to the attention
of all those who have despaired of
and abandoned substantive
discussion in favor of adjectival
ranting and rhetoric, basically in
the hope that at least one person
will remember it before resorting
to adjectives or violence in the
future. Thus, although most of
the following concerns individuals
generally associated with the
political left, the sole reason for
this apparent bias is that this
writing was evoked by columns
concerning them in the DAILY on
November 14, 1969.
The most prominent example
of adjectival rhetoric with total
disregard of similarities between
left and right was provided by R.
Bonner in his article on
fascism/Alioto. Although he
admitted that he is "not an expert
on fascism," Mr. Bonner
nevertheless felt qualified to forge
boldly ahead to tell us about the
artibrary use of police as a
fascist phenomenon.
Before setting pen to paper, Mr.
Bonner should have discussed
Hungary with Hungarian refugees,
East Germany with East German
refugees, and Cuba with Cuban
refugees, inter alia. He should
have, at the least, read Dr.
Zhivatfo, if wading through
cumbersome tomes on the history
of the Russian revolution were
too bothersome. He should have
considered Stalin and Mao, or
even the most recent example,
Czechoslovakia. The point should
be clear: Police power is, has
been, and will be used end abused
be leftists, rightists, and
moderates, for all of them are
human beings. Our duty must be
to preserve our rights, our
freedom from such abuse, through
voting and other political
processes and by reasoning with
those in power to show them
where and why they are wrong.
It should also be recognized
that there will always be a
difference of opinion as to
whether any given instance
represents use or abuse, and this,
in turn, will usually reflect the
support of or the objection to the
particular law being enforced
(clearly, laws unobjected to can
be enforced in ways that are
objected to). This perpetual
difference must be kept in mind if
we are to limit our desire to take
matters into our own hands and
to abandon order and reason.
Misapplied Appelations
I suggest that, in the future, Mr.
Bonner refrain from the impulse
to place the onus of abused police
power on any historical group and
from labeling politicians with
misapplied appelations, and
concentrate instead on why he
views certain actions as abusive
and what he believes should and
can be done to prevent further

Before setting pen to paper, Mr.
Bonner should have discussed
Hungary with Hungarian refugees,
East Germany with East German
refugees, and Cuba with Cuban
refugees, inter alia. He should
have, at the least, read Dr.
Zhivatfo, if wading through
cumbersome tomes on the history
of the Russian revolution were
too bothersome. He should have
considered Stalin and Mao, or
even the most recent example,
Czechoslovakia. The point should
be clear: Police power is, has
been, and will be used end abused
be leftists, rightists, and
moderates, for all of them are
human beings. Our duty must be
to preserve our rights, our
freedom from such abuse, through
voting and other political
processes and by reasoning with
those in power to show them
where and why they are wrong.
It should also be recognized
that there will always be a
difference of opinion as to
whether any given instance
represents use or abuse, and this,
in turn, will usually reflect the
support of or the objection to the
particular law being enforced
(clearly, laws unobjected to can
be enforced in ways that are
objected to). This perpetual
difference must be kept in mind if
we are to limit our desire to take
matters into our own hands and
to abandon order and reason.
Misapplied Appelations
I suggest that, in the future, Mr.
Bonner refrain from the impulse
to place the onus of abused police
power on any historical group and
from labeling politicians with
misapplied appelations, and
concentrate instead on why he
views certain actions as abusive
and what he believes should and
can be done to prevent further

The second example in the
DAILY was provided by the
BSU/ARENA article. Although I
partially disagree with the
ARENA'S stand on the issues
raised therein, I find the BSU
individuals' responses much more
troubling. Rather than extensively
defending their position on the
merits so as to clarify matters for
a concerned (I hope) student
body, these individuals resorted to
adjectival rhetoric: "authoritarian,
fascist, yellow journalists .. .
crackers." In doing so, these
individuals missed the irony of the
situation: They with political
power are condemning those who
dissent, those who express a fear
of unrepresentative government!
What these politicians are
experiencing is the same feeling of
frustration, fear, and anger that
has been experienced by the many
state and federal officials they
have attacked even more strongly
for years. In neither case, on
neither side, has a cause been
aided by adjectival rhetoric.
Why Spiro?
The final example is Spiro
Agnew. For a few years now I
have listened to and read Eldridge
Cleaver, Rap Brown, Stanford
students, Mike Rudd, and others
call various people pigs, fuckers,
fascists, shits, bastards, and many
othe; names. Yet when one
official comes forth with
traditionally less offensive
adjectival rhetoric, he gets laughed
at as being articulate and stupid
for having to resort to such
language!
The world is a mess and getting
messier. There is garbage in the
streets, the air, the water, and the
laws. Let us at least try to keep
some of the garbage out of our
dissent and discussions. Perhaps
we can all begin by eschewing
adjectival rhetoric, concentrating
on similarities as well as
differences, seeking to understand
and build rather than hating and
destroying, both in actions and in
words.
