# Cooperation Plea Ends Conference
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
A plea for greater
understanding between the
countries of the world and for
national self determination, and a
warning that international
co-operation in the solving of
common problems is imperative
highlighted speeches yesterday by
Bernt Ingvaldsen and Dr. William
Pollard.
Mr. Ingvaldsen, President of
the Norwegian Parliament and
chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize
Committee, and Dr. Pollard,
clergyman-physicist and Director
of the Oak Ridge Associated
Universities, brought to a close
the three day conference marking
the fiftieth anniversary of the
Hoover Institution.
Speaking before a crowd of
200 in Bishop Auditorium on the
subject "Path to Peace," Mr.
Ingvaldsen stressed that "the
responsibility for man's destiny
lies in the hands of the world's
great powers." He added that,
"We have to place the value of
human life higher than that of
ideological belief and political
ambition."
Mr. Ingvaldsen denounced as a
threat to peace the struggle to
maintain a balance of power that
led to the Communist takeover of
Eastern Europe. He added that,
on the other side of the coin, "not
every nation is suited for
democracy."
Retain Characteristics
"Each nation wants to live its
life as it wants to, secure that its
integrity will be respected by
outsiders, able to retain the
characteristics that make that
nation what it is."
"Peace," he concluded,
"depends on self-determining,

self-respecting nations the world
over," and that "peace must be
built on international
understanding, for war is an
antiquated means of solving
differences."
Dr. Pollard, elaborating on the
immediate need for world-wide
understanding and co-operation in
solving some of the more basic
problems facing mankind, focused
on man's changing relation to
earth.
Individual Responsibility
"If we don't control our
fertility," stated Dr. Pollard,
"Famine, disease, and certainly
war, will. It is a problem of
individual responsibility that
affects all people and all nations
regardless of ideological belief.
"The next thirty years will see
us begin to run out of, in the
sense of easy and inexpensive
availability and aquisition, our
natural resources. You'll be able
to watch them go, one by one.
The squeeze will affect every
nation.
"We must organize now for an
economy of scarcity, we must
save and reprocess all that we've
got left."
War and Preparedness
This new economy, according
to Dr. Pollard, would supercede,
existing economies. "The middle
of the 20th century has been
dominated by the Capitalism vs.
Communist struggle, and it just
doesn't make sense any more. It
doesn't matter who owns the
means of production, it's what is
produced and how." The world
has spent four trillion dollars on
war and preparedness for war in
The 20th Century. Think what we
could have done with those
resources."

CONFRONTATION EXPLANATION—Governor Ronald Reagan,
shown here surrounded by the Los Angeles press corps, lent his
support yesterday to the growing student movement to obtain
budgetary information.
A plea for greater
understanding between the
countries of the world and for
national self determination, and a
warning that international
co-operation in the solving of
common problems is imperative
highlighted speeches yesterday by
Bernt Ingvaldsen and Dr. William
Pollard.
Mr. Ingvaldsen, President of
the Norwegian Parliament and
chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize
Committee, and Dr. Pollard,
clergyman-physicist and Director
of the Oak Ridge Associated
Universities, brought to a close
the three day conference marking
the fiftieth anniversary of the
Hoover Institution.
Speaking before a crowd of
200 in Bishop Auditorium on the
subject "Path to Peace," Mr.
Ingvaldsen stressed that "the
responsibility for man's destiny
lies in the hands of the world's
great powers." He added that,
"We have to place the value of
human life higher than that of
ideological belief and political
ambition."
Mr. Ingvaldsen denounced as a
threat to peace the struggle to
maintain a balance of power that
led to the Communist takeover of
Eastern Europe. He added that,
on the other side of the coin, "not
every nation is suited for
democracy."
Retain Characteristics
"Each nation wants to live its
life as it wants to, secure that its
integrity will be respected by
outsiders, able to retain the
characteristics that make that
nation what it is."
"Peace," he concluded,
"depends on self-determining,

self-respecting nations the world
over," and that "peace must be
built on international
understanding, for war is an
antiquated means of solving
differences."
Dr. Pollard, elaborating on the
immediate need for world-wide
understanding and co-operation in
solving some of the more basic
problems facing mankind, focused
on man's changing relation to
earth.
Individual Responsibility
"If we don't control our
fertility," stated Dr. Pollard,
"Famine, disease, and certainly
war, will. It is a problem of
individual responsibility that
affects all people and all nations
regardless of ideological belief.
"The next thirty years will see
us begin to run out of, in the
sense of easy and inexpensive
availability and aquisition, our
natural resources. You'll be able
to watch them go, one by one.
The squeeze will affect every
nation.
"We must organize now for an
economy of scarcity, we must
save and reprocess all that we've
got left."
War and Preparedness
This new economy, according
to Dr. Pollard, would supercede,
existing economies. "The middle
of the 20th century has been
dominated by the Capitalism vs.
Communist struggle, and it just
doesn't make sense any more. It
doesn't matter who owns the
means of production, it's what is
produced and how." The world
has spent four trillion dollars on
war and preparedness for war in
The 20th Century. Think what we
could have done with those
resources."
