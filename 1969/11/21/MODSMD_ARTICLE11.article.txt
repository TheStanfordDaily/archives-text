Rugby Teams c£ Mormons
Editor, THE DAILY:
Hidden in the news article on
the cancellation of athletic
contests between Stanford and
Mormon-sponsored institutions
was an unwitting irony. In calling
attention to it, it is not my
purpose to criticize Stanford's
current policy of not scheduling
events with teams sponsored by
institutions that practice racial
discrimination. Surely most of the
campus is content with this
principle, and no other would
serve as wfell to make our own
attitudes clear.
My comment concerns the
rugby team of the
Mormon-supported Church
College of Hawaii, and raises the
general question of where
symbolism ends and humanity
begins. If my memory is accurate,
this team has played our rugby
team before and may wish to do
so again. Trusting my memory
again, I believe this is the team
composed almost entirely of
Tongans, who are Polynesians,
and Fijians, who are Oceanian
blacks. To refuse to play this team
for racial reasons would be a
murky business.
We can refuse to confront this
paradox by adopting the view that
it is an anomalous situation, and
too bad for the Fijians and
Tongans on their team. Too bad
also for the Bay Area Tongan
community, which turned out in
strength to cheer their fellows at
the last game a couple of years
ago. I am uncomfortable with this
attitude, knowing how much of

our past is littered with gratuitous
insensibility to people in the name
of this or that principle.
The gouge can be sunk deeper
yet. The team comes to be
composed of Tongans and Fijians
because the Mormon Church
supports their education in
Hawaii. The school is not the best
in the world, but no one else is
crowding to pick up the
scholarship tab for these
particular islanders. The Mormon
Church also runs a number of
educational institutions in Tonga,
and I think a few in Fiji. Local
opinion in Tonga holds that their
Liahona High School there is
probably the best secondary
school in the country, and I think
many non-Mormons attend it.
When I was there in 1965, the
Chief of the Mormon Mission in
Tonga held a Ph.D. in plant
ecology, and a major focus of
missionary effort was towards
improvement of local agricultural
yields and the quality of
agricultural exports, from which
Tonga gains most of her foreign
exchange to acquire manufactured
goods and raw materials that
cannot be obtained from local
resources. Since that time, the
Peace Corps has also entered
Tonga, but in general most
Americans give not a damn for
Tonga's future, if they even know
where it is. Whatever their
shortcomings, Mormons have put
out something for Tongans.
Perhaps those who support the
mission aim to save souls, but
they could as easily build drive-inn
in Utah with their money if they
so chose.

To conclude these rambling
remarks, if Tongans and Fijians
are not ashamed to be Mormons,
or at least to attend a Mormon
school, should we be ashamed to
play rugby with them? I don't
know the answer, but we must ask
ourselves, I think. Principles are
dandy, but they are not people
and you cannot love them no
matter how you may try.

Editor, THE DAILY:
It was with great interest that I
noted in a recent newscast over
KNX—Radio that Stanford will
break all relations with B.Y.U.
For a University that was
originally funded by money
"earned" from Chinese slave
labor; that down thru the years
managed to "restrict" Jewish
students; that would not allow
certain Catholic Colleges to enter
the old Pacific Coast Conference
nor even play St Mary's in
football, I am amazed at the
willingness and eagerness of the
"Farm" to "cast the first stone."
Even much of Stanford's
present income is earned from the
so-called "Killing Industries" who
occupy land in the Stanford
Industrial Park. This all makes it
difficult to understand the
"Indian" sincerity in getting
"moral" with a relatively
unimportant school.
The last time I checked, by the
way, Stanford had slightly over
200 black students. How many
non-playing black students now?
How manv Mexican-American?

How many Chinese (to which
Stanford owes so much)? How
many Japanese? In former days,
Stanford kept a strict quoto on
other groups, surely you must
know how many of these groups
attend now.
How many of the Frats will
STILL not accept Catholics, Jews,
Blacks, and the most hated
minority of all the Irish-Catholics?
If there EVER was a truly WASP
College, Stanford, the Harvard of
the West, was it.
If YOUR house is now in
order, Congratulations! By
example, why now show B.Y.U.
the way?

improvement of local agricultural
yields and the quality of
agricultural exports, from which
Tonga gains most of her foreign
exchange to acquire manufactured
goods and raw materials that
cannot be obtained from local
resources. Since that time, the
Peace Corps has also entered
Tonga, but in general most
Americans give not a damn for
Tonga's future, if they even know
where it is. Whatever their
shortcomings, Mormons have put
out something for Tongans.
Perhaps those who support the
mission aim to save souls, but
they could as easily build drive-inn
in Utah with their money if they
so chose.

To conclude these rambling
remarks, if Tongans and Fijians
are not ashamed to be Mormons,
or at least to attend a Mormon
school, should we be ashamed to
play rugby with them? I don't
know the answer, but we must ask
ourselves, I think. Principles are
dandy, but they are not people
and you cannot love them no
matter how you may try.

It was with great interest that I
noted in a recent newscast over
KNX—Radio that Stanford will
break all relations with B.Y.U.
For a University that was
originally funded by money
"earned" from Chinese slave
labor; that down thru the years
managed to "restrict" Jewish
students; that would not allow
certain Catholic Colleges to enter
the old Pacific Coast Conference
nor even play St Mary's in
football, I am amazed at the
willingness and eagerness of the
"Farm" to "cast the first stone."
Even much of Stanford's
present income is earned from the
so-called "Killing Industries" who
occupy land in the Stanford
Industrial Park. This all makes it
difficult to understand the
"Indian" sincerity in getting
"moral" with a relatively
unimportant school.
The last time I checked, by the
way, Stanford had slightly over
200 black students. How many
non-playing black students now?
How manv Mexican-American?

How many Chinese (to which
Stanford owes so much)? How
many Japanese? In former days,
Stanford kept a strict quoto on
other groups, surely you must
know how many of these groups
attend now.
How many of the Frats will
STILL not accept Catholics, Jews,
Blacks, and the most hated
minority of all the Irish-Catholics?
If there EVER was a truly WASP
College, Stanford, the Harvard of
the West, was it.
If YOUR house is now in
order, Congratulations! By
example, why now show B.Y.U.
the way?

Hidden in the news article on
the cancellation of athletic
contests between Stanford and
Mormon-sponsored institutions
was an unwitting irony. In calling
attention to it, it is not my
purpose to criticize Stanford's
current policy of not scheduling
events with teams sponsored by
institutions that practice racial
discrimination. Surely most of the
campus is content with this
principle, and no other would
serve as wfell to make our own
attitudes clear.
My comment concerns the
rugby team of the
Mormon-supported Church
College of Hawaii, and raises the
general question of where
symbolism ends and humanity
begins. If my memory is accurate,
this team has played our rugby
team before and may wish to do
so again. Trusting my memory
again, I believe this is the team
composed almost entirely of
Tongans, who are Polynesians,
and Fijians, who are Oceanian
blacks. To refuse to play this team
for racial reasons would be a
murky business.
We can refuse to confront this
paradox by adopting the view that
it is an anomalous situation, and
too bad for the Fijians and
Tongans on their team. Too bad
also for the Bay Area Tongan
community, which turned out in
strength to cheer their fellows at
the last game a couple of years
ago. I am uncomfortable with this
attitude, knowing how much of

our past is littered with gratuitous
insensibility to people in the name
of this or that principle.
The gouge can be sunk deeper
yet. The team comes to be
composed of Tongans and Fijians
because the Mormon Church
supports their education in
Hawaii. The school is not the best
in the world, but no one else is
crowding to pick up the
scholarship tab for these
particular islanders. The Mormon
Church also runs a number of
educational institutions in Tonga,
and I think a few in Fiji. Local
opinion in Tonga holds that their
Liahona High School there is
probably the best secondary
school in the country, and I think
many non-Mormons attend it.
When I was there in 1965, the
Chief of the Mormon Mission in
Tonga held a Ph.D. in plant
ecology, and a major focus of
missionary effort was towards
improvement of local agricultural
yields and the quality of
agricultural exports, from which

attend now.
How many of the Frats will
STILL not accept Catholics, Jews,
Blacks, and the most hated

Rugby Teams c£ Mormons
Editor, THE DAILY:
Hidden in the news article on
the cancellation of athletic
contests between Stanford and
Mormon-sponsored institutions
was an unwitting irony. In calling
attention to it, it is not my
purpose to criticize Stanford's
current policy of not scheduling
events with teams sponsored by
institutions that practice racial
discrimination. Surely most of the
campus is content with this
principle, and no other would
serve as wfell to make our own
attitudes clear.
My comment concerns the
rugby team of the
Mormon-supported Church
College of Hawaii, and raises the
general question of where
symbolism ends and humanity
begins. If my memory is accurate,
this team has played our rugby
team before and may wish to do
so again. Trusting my memory
again, I believe this is the team
composed almost entirely of
Tongans, who are Polynesians,
and Fijians, who are Oceanian
blacks. To refuse to play this team
for racial reasons would be a
murky business.
We can refuse to confront this
paradox by adopting the view that
it is an anomalous situation, and
too bad for the Fijians and
Tongans on their team. Too bad
also for the Bay Area Tongan
community, which turned out in
strength to cheer their fellows at
the last game a couple of years
ago. I am uncomfortable with this
attitude, knowing how much of

our past is littered with gratuitous
insensibility to people in the name
of this or that principle.
The gouge can be sunk deeper
yet. The team comes to be
composed of Tongans and Fijians
because the Mormon Church
supports their education in
Hawaii. The school is not the best
in the world, but no one else is
crowding to pick up the
scholarship tab for these
particular islanders. The Mormon
Church also runs a number of
educational institutions in Tonga,
and I think a few in Fiji. Local
opinion in Tonga holds that their
Liahona High School there is
probably the best secondary
school in the country, and I think
many non-Mormons attend it.
When I was there in 1965, the
Chief of the Mormon Mission in
Tonga held a Ph.D. in plant
ecology, and a major focus of
missionary effort was towards
improvement of local agricultural
yields and the quality of
agricultural exports, from which
Tonga gains most of her foreign
exchange to acquire manufactured
goods and raw materials that
cannot be obtained from local
resources. Since that time, the
Peace Corps has also entered
Tonga, but in general most
Americans give not a damn for
Tonga's future, if they even know
where it is. Whatever their
shortcomings, Mormons have put
out something for Tongans.
Perhaps those who support the
mission aim to save souls, but
they could as easily build drive-inn
in Utah with their money if they
so chose.

To conclude these rambling
remarks, if Tongans and Fijians
are not ashamed to be Mormons,
or at least to attend a Mormon
school, should we be ashamed to
play rugby with them? I don't
know the answer, but we must ask
ourselves, I think. Principles are
dandy, but they are not people
and you cannot love them no
matter how you may try.

BYU Again
Editor, THE DAILY:
It was with great interest that I
noted in a recent newscast over
KNX—Radio that Stanford will
break all relations with B.Y.U.
For a University that was
originally funded by money
"earned" from Chinese slave
labor; that down thru the years
managed to "restrict" Jewish
students; that would not allow
certain Catholic Colleges to enter
the old Pacific Coast Conference
nor even play St Mary's in
football, I am amazed at the
willingness and eagerness of the
"Farm" to "cast the first stone."
Even much of Stanford's
present income is earned from the
so-called "Killing Industries" who
occupy land in the Stanford
Industrial Park. This all makes it
difficult to understand the
"Indian" sincerity in getting
"moral" with a relatively
unimportant school.
The last time I checked, by the
way, Stanford had slightly over
200 black students. How many
non-playing black students now?
How manv Mexican-American?

How many Chinese (to which
Stanford owes so much)? How
many Japanese? In former days,
Stanford kept a strict quoto on
other groups, surely you must
know how many of these groups
attend now.
How many of the Frats will
STILL not accept Catholics, Jews,
Blacks, and the most hated
minority of all the Irish-Catholics?
If there EVER was a truly WASP
College, Stanford, the Harvard of
the West, was it.

order, Congratulations! By
