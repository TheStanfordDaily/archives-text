Does Carrie Wash Clothes?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have been following the
progress of the Women's
Liberation Movement with both
concern and amusement. Concern,
because they have some valid
points that need to be aired;
amusement, because of their
strategy. It presently appears that
they don't have a strategy, but
there is one, Carrie Sapir who is
determined to take a worthy
cause and turn it into a war
protest. In her article "Boycott
G.E.," she lists concern for the
workers and G.E. involvement in
the war as justifications for the
boycott. Are we to infer that she
is not concerned about the
inflationary wage increases which
the union is demanding 0 Has she
bothered to ask the workers if
they want the support of her and
her cohorts? It is not necessary to
belong to the WLM to protest the
war. If the Movement accepts this
jump on the band wagon type of
leadership, it will certainly fail to
fulfill its original objectives.
Being a "woman trapped in a
world dominated by capitalism"
does have some advantages. Does
Carrie Sapir wash her clotbes by
hand and cook over a wood fire
or does she have a subservient
male who does it for her? Perhaps
before the present system is
destroyed, a better ony to replace
it with should be developed. Good
luck!
