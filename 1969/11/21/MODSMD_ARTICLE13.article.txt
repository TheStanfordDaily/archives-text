# Scores Scorekeepers
## Polarity's Price? 
### Steve Hoglund 
(This is the second half of a
two-part series dealing with the
student senate.)
In discussing the role of the
Senate, I tried to show yesterday
that unreflective use of the words
"representative" and "reflect" has
led critics of the new legislature to
pose the false—or, at the least,
premature—question of whether
to 40-member body can represent
the student body. The more
relevant question, I asserted, is
how the Senate, as presently
constituted, can do so. I tried to
distinguish abstract symbolic and
ideological issues, on the one
hand, from concrete student
problems on the other. The latter,
including the bulk of SES
recommendations, seem most
appropriate to a body elected
from academic constituencies.
I concluded yesterday by
advancing the suggestion that
constituencies be subdivided
voluntarily by their
representatives, so that specific
needs of smaller groups (such as
graduate students in Poli Sci, for
example) might at least find
expression in the Senate. "Bloc"
voting would not thereby be
eliminated, I conceded. But
shifting coalitions arising from
concrete issues would surely be
preferable to abstract issues
arising from pre-arranged
coalitions.
Let me continue, now, by
addressing myself to how Senators
might better "reflect" appropriate
demands by various portions of
the student body.
The Liaison Committee of the
Senate, of which I am a member,
has been directed to seek ways by
which the Senate, and its
individual members, could most
effectively communicate with
external bodies—including student
living groups, such as fraternities;
campus organizations like the
BSU; and journals, such as the
Daily. In the course of brief
debate on the matter last Monday,
it became clear that members are
divided—though not along the
lines of any pre-existing
"blocs"—on the basis of such
communication.
Develop Constituency
At least two distinct positions
have developed. On the one hand
is the contention that the Senate
should encourage each member to
"develop" his own constituency.
By making available funds for a
(limited) meal transfer ticket the
Senate would help each member
visit, on some regular basis,
various living groups containing
his constituents. Tied, perhaps, to
this proposal is the suggestion that
the Senate purchase space in the
Daily to list the address and
phone number of each Senator,
and to explicitly encourage all
living groups to invite appropriate
Senators to dine and discuss issues
of student concern.
The other position, while less
defined, would involve any and all
Senators who voluntarily wish to
discuss with students any and all
matters before the Senate. These
Senators would not visit, under
the auspices of this program,
residences or student groups that
fall ptimarily within their own
constituencies. The mechanisms
listed above could be used, but
individual development of
constituencies would not be
promoted by the Senate as a
whole.
General Concerns
While this second position may
avoid the Senate-sponsored
"electioneering" implicit in the
first, it suffers from more
practical concerns. What will
motivate the visiting senator to
bring back to the senate issues
that may have no relevance to his
own constituency? Is it likely that
groups of students will wish to
discuss general concerns, or that
they will wish to speak with
someone they have not themselves
elected?
At our next meeting on
Tuesday, these and other
proposals will be discussed. I
invite all students with ideas on
the matter of channels of

representation and reflection to
contact me personally or to
attend thy next Senate meeting.
With this, I conclude my remarks
about how the current Senate
may "represent" and "reflect."
If we are successful in the
pursuit of the goals I have
outlined yesterday and
today—including the
establishment of communication
channels—the legitimacy of the
re-constituted legislature will be
more firmly established.
Senate Worth
And so, when students demand
(rightly) that we in theSenatebe
representative and "relevant,"
may we not also ask that
chroniclers of our proceedings
show a bit more patience (and
knowledge) than does Mr. Reed,
who would have "a final judgment
as to (the) worth" of the Senate
rendered shortly after it
appropriates the ASSU budget
later this month?
May we not ask that
proponents of a voluntary ASSU
allow the current Senate to
function this year, even as they
criticize its long-term legitimacy
based on the observable absence
of two-thirds of the student body
from the polls that elected it? I
personally welcome the petition
which Harvey Hukari plans to
circulate. But unless and until the
students have voted to abolish or
replace the 40-member Senate, it
remains, to paraphrase a recent
President, "the only senate you've
got."
In the interim, we need the
thoughtful observations of all
students in order to counter, and
ultimately to avoid, the needless
polarization of our membership
which the prophesizers of doom
and the distorters of fact only
serve to magnify by focusing their
foggy lenses on the bare outline of
a resolution or of an election in
the Senate.
"Senate Reverses Moratorium
Stand," proclaimed three-column
headline in the Daily (Nov. 12).
Yet, in view of the overlapping
support for both resolutions and,
more importantly, of President
Pitzer's intervening comments
(which had lessened the
appropriateness of the first
Moratorium resolution), it would
have been closer to the truth to
say that the Senate had "revised"
or "updated" its stand.
In related fashion, the Colonist
and other publications might be
wary of speaking too loosely of a
BSU/white radical bloc—and
thereby perpetuating as an
"alliance" the motley assortment
of senators which has risen to
occasional prominence thanks to
that fragile unity which is based
primarily on shared aversion to
any pre-arranged coalitions.
Polarization, it seems to me, is
an evil that most students would
like to minimize. To draw lines
before an issue is presented is to
distort existing problems and
render even more difficult
adoption of proposals to solve
them.
It was due to my antipathy for
polarization, and to my concern
that the Senate enhance its
legitimacy (through more
adequate representation), that I
initially opposed the debate
between the BSU and the Arena
that arose over charges by Roger
Reed of BSU "intimidation" in
the Senate elections. With Dave
Edwards wearing the "hat" of
Senate Chairman on top of (or
under) his ''hat' 1 as
BSU/co-spokesman, it seemed
likely that the authority of the
Senate could only suffer the slings
and arrows of outrage that missed
their intended marks. Besides, in
the midst of the furor over Reed's
charges, who would ponder the
unsolved student problems and
the misdirected energies that
could be tackling them?
You see, Virginia, that is what
representation, reflection and,
ultimately, legitimacy are all
about.
