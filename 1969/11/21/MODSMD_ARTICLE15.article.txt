# Women Ignored
## Legislating Morality 
### 
(The following article was
signed by 16 female residents of
Soto House.)
In relation to the current
controversy over Cowell's pill
policy, we would like to offer the
following thoughts:
1. The worst effect of the
University's attempts to have an
untarnished name in regard to its
prescription of pills is that it is in
fact legislating morality. This is
accomplished by eliminating a
woman's ability to exercise her
own moral choice.
2. Secondly, the University
renders a tremendous disservice to
the rest of the Bay Area

community, by refusing service to
its own community in the fieid ol
contraception and other related
topics.
As a result, Stanford women
are forced off campus for
gynecological exams and
contraceptive equipment, thus
overwhelming community services
such as Planned Parenthood with
patients which it should not have
to accommodate, crowding
already insufficient facilities.
3. Dr. U'Ren's objection that
the University has not done
adequate research on he
side-effects of the pill is refutable
on two basic grounds.

First, it is hardly conceivable
that the University does detailed
research into the nature of each
and every drug and medicine
which Cowell administers. It is
absolutely true that the pill is
dangerous for various individuals,
but this is equally true in the case
of penicillin, antibiotics, or any
other medication improperly
administered. »
Secondly, birth control
methods consist of more than just
the pill. Dr. U'Ren seems to imply
that because one of these methods
of birth control is in his
estimation questionable, the
University should refrain from
sanctioning any form of
contraceptive devices.
Despite the fact that there are
many other methods of birth
control, the University will
administer none of them to
unmarried women of any age.
4. A final but important
problem arises in he discussion of
follow-up care and attention for
women who have been prescribed
the pill.
It has been argued that Cowell
has no business prescribing the pill
due to the fact that it is incapable
at this time of providing adequate
time and facilities to follow-up
care. However, this is certainly
also true of Planned Parenthood,
which serves a much larger
community than does Cowell.
The solution to this problem is
not in the University's ignoring its
responsibilities, but rather a
re-examination and possible
addition of staff and facilities at
Cowell.

fact legislating morality. This is
accomplished by eliminating a
woman's ability to exercise her
own moral choice.
2. Secondly, the University
renders a tremendous disservice to
the rest of the Bay Area

community, by refusing service to
its own community in the fieid ol
contraception and other related
topics.
As a result, Stanford women
are forced off campus for
gynecological exams and
contraceptive equipment, thus
overwhelming community services
such as Planned Parenthood with
patients which it should not have
to accommodate, crowding
already insufficient facilities.
3. Dr. U'Ren's objection that
the University has not done
adequate research on he
side-effects of the pill is refutable
on two basic grounds.

First, it is hardly conceivable
that the University does detailed
research into the nature of each
and every drug and medicine
which Cowell administers. It is
absolutely true that the pill is
dangerous for various individuals,
but this is equally true in the case
of penicillin, antibiotics, or any
other medication improperly
administered. »
Secondly, birth control
methods consist of more than just
the pill. Dr. U'Ren seems to imply
that because one of these methods
of birth control is in his
estimation questionable, the
University should refrain from
sanctioning any form of
contraceptive devices.
Despite the fact that there are
many other methods of birth
control, the University will
administer none of them to
unmarried women of any age.
4. A final but important
problem arises in he discussion of
follow-up care and attention for
women who have been prescribed
the pill.
It has been argued that Cowell
has no business prescribing the pill
due to the fact that it is incapable
at this time of providing adequate
time and facilities to follow-up
care. However, this is certainly
also true of Planned Parenthood,
which serves a much larger
community than does Cowell.
The solution to this problem is
not in the University's ignoring its
responsibilities, but rather a
re-examination and possible
addition of staff and facilities at
Cowell.
