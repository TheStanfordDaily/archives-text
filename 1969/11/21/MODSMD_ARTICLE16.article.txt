# Steel Workers
## Support Strike 
### 
(The SDS Labor Committee
considered unclear the November
7 DAILY article "Union Asks
SDS To End Picketing." To
clarify the issue of student
support for striking Pittsburgh
Des Moines steel workers, this
committee interviewed two
members of United Steel Workers
of America local 4028.)
Q: Some news stories indicated
that The PDM workers don't like
students and feel students are
hurting the workers' cause. Is this
the general feeling in the union?
A: No, it wasn't because they
didn't like students, but we
thought it would be better to let
things cool off so no one would
get hurt. Cops picked out people
to bust. Altogether the union men
were charged with 3 felonies and
9 misdemeanors, and had to pay
$6,580.00 in bail. [After October
31 police riot. ]
Q: Why did you decide to
discourage student mobilizations?
A: Because we didn't want to
see them get beat up for no
reason. We saw this last Friday
[Oct. 31], Also we thought it
would help our cause. The
company hinted that if the
students left, they would get rid
of the scabs.
Q: Has the lull helped your cause?
A: Noâ€”They hired 16-20 more
scabs.
Q: How do the workers feel about

the student movement and past
student support?
A: Now workers don't agree
with all the ideas of students but
with some of them. The support
was very helpful. They [workers]
thought before the strike they
[students] were a bunch of
radical nuts.
Local 4028 is prevented by a
court injunction from asking for
student support. But we
encourage small groups of
students to go down to PDM and
talk to the women and men on
the line. The plant is on Lafayette
Road, east of the Bayshore, in
Santa Clara. (Agnew exit)
