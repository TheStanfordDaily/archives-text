# Dear Mom
## Christmas Shopping 
### Cissi Bonini 
Dear MOM:
It was wrong for the six
members of the History
Department faculty to reveal their
salaries in the DAILY last week.
This was definitely
unprofessional, as it discourages
those of us who were planning to
enter the profession.

Dear Irate:
I tried to reach these professors
for comment but they have been
treated to lunch and drinks by
students so much since the salary
revelation that they are
unavailable. The Post Office
reports that CARE packages are
arriving. Also rumor has it that a
group of Biafrians are making up a
purse for them. However, you will
be glad to know that things may
get better since the American
Historical Association plans to
review its poverty and celibacy
clauses.
Yours poorly,
Mom

Dear Mom:
I was in San Francisco
shopping last Saturday. There
must have been 100,000 people
out in front of Sears, Roebuck. I
think it is a good idea to "shop
early for Christmas," but pushing
the Christmas season before
Thanksgiving is getting too
commercial!!
Traditionalist, Encina Staff
Dear Traditionalist:
I agree with you entirely. The
situation is even worse in other
parts of the country. I understand
that 250,000 people turned out
Saturday for Macy's white flower
day in Washington, D.C.
Love, Mom
Dead Mom:
Do you think people are
getting married too young these
days?

I am undecided about this

Mom's Astrological Tips
SCORPIO: This is a bad day to be
run over.
VIRGO: Accept any money over
$100 offered to you today.
Female VIRGOs. Disregard the
above as there may be hidden
motives.
SAGITTARIUS: This is a bad
quarter for Sagittarians. Do not
do too much breathing during
AM.
LIBRA: You will run into your
kindred soul today. Do not drive.
TAURUS: Good day for a bull
session.
PISCES: There is something fishy
about you.

shopping last Saturday. There
must have been 100,000 people
out in front of Sears, Roebuck. I
think it is a good idea to "shop
early for Christmas," but pushing
the Christmas season before
Thanksgiving is getting too
commercial!!
Traditionalist, Encina Staff
Dear Traditionalist:
I agree with you entirely. The
situation is even worse in other
parts of the country. I understand
that 250,000 people turned out
Saturday for Macy's white flower
day in Washington, D.C.
Love, Mom
Dead Mom:
Do you think people are
getting married too young these
days?

Dear Lusty:
I am undecided about this
point but I am holding a

symposium on the subject with
my cub scout pack and their
wives ....

Friendily, etc.

run over.
VIRGO: Accept any money over
$100 offered to you today.
Female VIRGOs. Disregard the
above as there may be hidden
motives.

kindred soul today. Do not drive.
