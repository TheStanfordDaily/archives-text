# Rebels Cause
## 'Save The World' 
### 
To all my friends who see
themselves as the avant-garde of a
new and exciting social movement
that will "save the world" from
the insane and incredulous path it
is taking—
. . .Who knows, having read
Mr. Mencken and Mr. Sinclair
Lewis, what kind of world will be
left when all the boobs and yokels
have crawled back in their holes
and have died of shame?
The rebel, while he is making
his attack, is not likely to feel the
need to answer such questions.
For he moves in an unreal
environment, one might almost
say a paracitic environment. He
goes forth to destroy Caesar,
Manmon, George P. Babbitt, and
Mrs. Grundy. As he wrestles with
these demons, he leans upon
them.
By inversion they offer him
much the same kind of support
which the conformer enjoys. They
provide him with an objective
which enables him to know
exactly what he..thinks he wants
to do. His energiei are focused by
his indignation. He does not suffer
from emptiness, doubt, and
division of soul. These are the
maladies which come later when
the struggle is over.

While the rebel is in conflict
with the established nuisances he
has an aim in life which absorbs
all his passions. He has his own
sense of righteousness and his own
feeling of communion with a
grnad purpose. For in attacking
idols there is a kind of piety, in
overthrowing tyrants a kind of
loyalty, in ridiculing stupidities an
imitation of wisdom.
In the heat of battle the rebel
is exalted by a whole-hearted
tension which is easily mistaken
for a taste of the freedom that is
to come. He is under the spell of
an illusion. For what comes after
the struggle is not the exaltation
of freedom but a letting down of
the tension that belongs solely to
the struggle itself.
The happiness of the rebel is as
transient as the iconoclasm which
produced it. When he has slain the
dragon and rescued the beautiful
maiden, there is usually nothing
left for him to do but write his
memoirs and dream of a time
when the world was young . . .
Luminous Beliefs
. . .His life seems mere
restlessness and compulsion,
rather than conduct lighted by
luminous beliefs. He is possessed
by a great deal of excitement
amidst which, as Mr. Santayana
once remarked, he redoubles his
effort when he has forgotten his
aim . . .
. . .And so the modern world
is haunted by a realization, which
it becomes constantly less easy to
ignore, that it is impossible to
reconstruct an enduring
orthodoxy, and impossible to live
well without the satisfactions
which an orthodoxy would
provide.

cynic from W. Lippman's book,

much the same kind of support
which the conformer enjoys. They
provide him with an objective
which enables him to know
exactly what he..thinks he wants
to do. His energiei are focused by
his indignation. He does not suffer
from emptiness, doubt, and
division of soul. These are the
maladies which come later when
the struggle is over.

While the rebel is in conflict
with the established nuisances he
has an aim in life which absorbs
all his passions. He has his own
sense of righteousness and his own
feeling of communion with a
grnad purpose. For in attacking
idols there is a kind of piety, in
overthrowing tyrants a kind of
loyalty, in ridiculing stupidities an
imitation of wisdom.
In the heat of battle the rebel
is exalted by a whole-hearted
tension which is easily mistaken
for a taste of the freedom that is
to come. He is under the spell of
an illusion. For what comes after
the struggle is not the exaltation
of freedom but a letting down of
the tension that belongs solely to
the struggle itself.
The happiness of the rebel is as
transient as the iconoclasm which
produced it. When he has slain the
dragon and rescued the beautiful
maiden, there is usually nothing
left for him to do but write his
memoirs and dream of a time
when the world was young . . .
Luminous Beliefs
. . .His life seems mere
restlessness and compulsion,
rather than conduct lighted by
luminous beliefs. He is possessed
by a great deal of excitement
amidst which, as Mr. Santayana
once remarked, he redoubles his
effort when he has forgotten his
aim . . .
. . .And so the modern world
is haunted by a realization, which
it becomes constantly less easy to
ignore, that it is impossible to
reconstruct an enduring
orthodoxy, and impossible to live
well without the satisfactions
which an orthodoxy would
provide.
(Quoted by an anonymous
cynic from W. Lippman's book,
PREFACE TO MORALS.)
To all my friends who see
themselves as the avant-garde of a
new and exciting social movement
that will "save the world" from
the insane and incredulous path it
is taking—
. . .Who knows, having read
Mr. Mencken and Mr. Sinclair
Lewis, what kind of world will be
left when all the boobs and yokels
have crawled back in their holes
and have died of shame?
The rebel, while he is making
his attack, is not likely to feel the
need to answer such questions.
For he moves in an unreal
environment, one might almost
say a paracitic environment. He
goes forth to destroy Caesar,
Manmon, George P. Babbitt, and
Mrs. Grundy. As he wrestles with
these demons, he leans upon
them.
By inversion they offer him
much the same kind of support
which the conformer enjoys. They
provide him with an objective
which enables him to know
exactly what he..thinks he wants
to do. His energiei are focused by
