# President Accepts Lodge Resignation
## 
### 
President Nixon yesterday
accepted the resignation of Henry
Cabot Lodge as chief U.S.
negotiator at the Vietnam peace
talks in Paris. No successor was
immediately named, but the
Administration said that the
United States does not intend to
downgrade the importance of the
talks.
Lodge said in a letter to the
President that the Communist
negotiators had "flatly refused"
to engage in meaningful talks. The
White House said that Lodge told
Nixon over a month ago that he
wanted to leave the post as the
talks showed no sign of progress.
The number two man in Paris,
Lawrence E. Welsh, also quit,
citing the Communist
intransigience. Both resignations
take effect on Dec. 8.
No successors were named to
the posts, and no indication was

given of when the new
appointments could be expected.
But the State Department rejected
the suggestion that this might
mean the United States had given
up hope of negotiating an end to
the war at Paris.
Philip C. Habib, a veteran
Foreign Service officer who has
been the senior advisor in Paris
since the talks began, was
designated acting head of the
American delegation.
In his letter of resignation,
Lodge told the President, "I
strongly support your efforts to
negotiate an end to the war. You
have left no stone unturned. It is
sad that the other side has flatly
refused to reciprocate in any kind
of meaningful way." The letter,
written from Paris, also stated
that "it has been an honor to be
your representative here and I
thank you for it."
