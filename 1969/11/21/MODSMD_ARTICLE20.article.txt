## Critics, De Broca, 'Devil by the Tail' 
### TODD McCARTHY 
It is extremely difficult for a
critic to write about his very
favorite films. At best, he can
convince his readers to go see the
specific film in question but, no
matter how hard he- tries to
convey his love for a picture, he is
destined to be disappointed when
others seemingly cannot react as
passionately to it as he has.
Every moviegoer has certainly
felt this sense of hopelessness at
one time or another, for we all
have our favorite "little pictures"
which few other people have seen
and which no one else seems to be
able to appreciate in the "right"
way.
Even the most prestigious
movie critics feel the need to
persuade the public of the value
of their personal pets. Indeed,
well-known writers might be
inclined to have unusually strong
tendencies in this direction since
their enthusiastic endorsement
might help determine the fate of
the picture; it is very easy to go
overboard.
Andrew Sarris was willing to
stake his critical reputation on
Lola Monies, a nice romance by
Max Ophuls, being the greatest
film of all time. Similarly, Pauline
Kael came to wishful conclusions
after her apparently exaltant
experience at Long Day's Journey
Into Night, proclaiming,
''Whatever it is, it's great."

Though they would be
disappointed in me for not
flipping out at their favorites (or,
in fact, does the critic disappoint
the viewer in such cases?), 1 am
able to make allowances for their
specific tastes (or weaknesses) and
I still respect their general
perception and writing ability.
What this all comes down to is
an illumination of the role of the
critic. It must never be forgotten
that the critic is just a person,
pretty much like any other, whose
tastes are not necessarily any
better or worse than anyone else's
and whose preferences and visions
are indicative of no one's but his
own. After all, a critic's relevance
and worthiness should not be
determined by how often he
agrees with you but by whether
he is able to illuminate the
qualities of given films and artists
and whether he is able to
stimulate interest in films in
general.
Fortunately, film criticism is in
the process of becoming
recognized as a more personal art
rather than as a stronghold for
self-righteous advice-giving, as in
the Bosley Crowther days. Thus,
both respect for a writer's insights
and tolerance for his personal
idiosyncrasies has risen sharply
over the past few years (largely, I
might add, due to the work of
Sarris and Kael).

It seems to me that there are
two ego-oriented incentives which
drive critics to zealously support
their private favorites. Primarily,
they hope to save the films from
virtual extinction and, by
providing the advertising men
with some juicy quotes, hope to
generate enough public interest to
keep the films open for an extra
week or two, thus providing the
opportunity for more people to
see the films.
Occasionally, such critical
fervent can pay off; Sarris almost
singlehandedly engineering the
current playdates Lolu Monies is
enjoying in this country, while the
enthusiastic support of Laek and
Newsweek's Joseph Morgenstern
afforded the excellent Pretty
Poison some additional
engagements late last year.
Secondly, if what looks like an
underdog film does achieve
popular success in the long run,
critics enjoy being credited with
having "discovered" the film
before it became, so to speak,
"fashionable" to like it. However,
this often leads to pointless
guessing games on the part of
critics as to what will or will not
be popular.
Last year Hollis Alpert (who
always seems particularly anxious
to be the driver of critical
bandwagons) predicted that the
dreadful Joanna would become
another Graduate or Bonnie and

Clyde, that it would "signal
another change of direction."
Well, audiences and other critics
saw differently and Mr. Alpert
wound up with egg on his face.
Beware of critics with clairvoyant
tendencies!
Belatedly, I arrive at my review
of Devil by the Tail. Without
going off any deep ends, I can say
that the film is doomed to stay

with us and pass out of sight very
quietly, for it has already
experienced unspectacular runs in
New York and Los Angeles and is
not the type of picture which
evokes explosive, adjective-filled
reactions from its viewers. Despite
this (I hope not because of this), I
believe it to be the best film
released so far this year and it
confirms Philippe De Broca's
position as perhaps the most
entertaining director currently
working in the cinema.
I can expect many people to be
disappointed with Devil by the
Tail, if only because it isn't
"significant," because it doesn't
say anything important. But the
film's charm and persuasiveness lie
largely in that its even serious
matters should be taken with a sly
smile and a wink of the eye. De
Broca's consistant success is
attributable to his full
appreciation and subtle emphasis
of the delightful madness of the
human animal; De Broca is always
entertaining and in his ability to
entertain lies his artistry.
As in That Man From Rio and
King of Hearts, De Broca revolves
his film around a mischievous, just
slightly crazy leading man, in this
case the estimable Yves Montand.
Hiding from the police in an
isolated hotel/chateau, Montand
keeps himself occupied with four
lovely ladies of various ages.
Characters pop in and out and
complications arise as frequently
and ludicrously as in a farce by
Feydeau and while the film is not
a side-splitting extravaganza, it is
always warm and very engaging.
De Broca has that quality
which auteur critics search
desparately for in many directors
who simply don't have it; a
feeling, a point of view, an ouvre.
While they don't quite reach the
realm of fantasy, his films always
seem one step removed from
reality, with his characters
performing feats which seem
impossible . . . but then again, not
totally impossible.
Furthermore, De Broca is not
torn between a desire to please
the general audience and a desire
to impress the critics; usually, he
can do both at the same time and
if he can't entirely achieve the
latter, he'll happily settle for the
former. In recent films, Francois
Truffaut has seemingly devoted
some sequences to the public and
others to the academicians and
has created pictures which are not
totally satisfying on either level.
Similarly, Godard offers
sequences in all his works which
can be enjoyed by everyone but
then loads his films with obscure
references and in-jokes which can
only be appreciated by those who
are abreast of the film scene.
De Broca's work is given
consistancy through his repeated
collaboration with writer Daniel
Boulanger and the reigning king of
film music, Georges Delerue, as
well as a sweetly melancholy view
of life and romance which, for
me, is totally intoxicating. Some
people may find Devil by the Tail
trite and frivolous, while others
may be totally opposed to the
whole concept of escapism. I find
De Broca's current glorification of
humanity an encouraging sign that
exhuberance and vitality in the
cinema are still possible.
With at least three masterpieces
behind him at age 34, De Broca
stands as the only young French
director who has neither become
disoriented by success, nor
[preoccupied with politics, nor
been lured by the bigger budgets
and ''scope" offered by
Hollywood. I hope he stays in his
prime.

which few other people have seen
and which no one else seems to be
able to appreciate in the "right"
way.
Even the most prestigious
movie critics feel the need to
persuade the public of the value
of their personal pets. Indeed,
well-known writers might be
inclined to have unusually strong
tendencies in this direction since
their enthusiastic endorsement
might help determine the fate of
the picture; it is very easy to go
overboard.
Andrew Sarris was willing to
stake his critical reputation on
Lola Monies, a nice romance by
Max Ophuls, being the greatest
film of all time. Similarly, Pauline
Kael came to wishful conclusions
after her apparently exaltant
experience at Long Day's Journey
Into Night, proclaiming,
''Whatever it is, it's great."

Though they would be
disappointed in me for not
flipping out at their favorites (or,
in fact, does the critic disappoint
the viewer in such cases?), 1 am
able to make allowances for their
specific tastes (or weaknesses) and
I still respect their general
perception and writing ability.
What this all comes down to is
an illumination of the role of the
critic. It must never be forgotten
that the critic is just a person,
pretty much like any other, whose
tastes are not necessarily any
better or worse than anyone else's
and whose preferences and visions
are indicative of no one's but his
own. After all, a critic's relevance
and worthiness should not be
determined by how often he
agrees with you but by whether
he is able to illuminate the
qualities of given films and artists
and whether he is able to
stimulate interest in films in
general.
Fortunately, film criticism is in
the process of becoming
recognized as a more personal art
rather than as a stronghold for
self-righteous advice-giving, as in
the Bosley Crowther days. Thus,
both respect for a writer's insights
and tolerance for his personal
idiosyncrasies has risen sharply
over the past few years (largely, I
might add, due to the work of
Sarris and Kael).

It seems to me that there are
two ego-oriented incentives which
drive critics to zealously support
their private favorites. Primarily,
they hope to save the films from
virtual extinction and, by
providing the advertising men
with some juicy quotes, hope to
generate enough public interest to
keep the films open for an extra
week or two, thus providing the
opportunity for more people to
see the films.
Occasionally, such critical
fervent can pay off; Sarris almost
singlehandedly engineering the
current playdates Lolu Monies is
enjoying in this country, while the
enthusiastic support of Laek and
Newsweek's Joseph Morgenstern
afforded the excellent Pretty
Poison some additional
engagements late last year.
Secondly, if what looks like an
underdog film does achieve
popular success in the long run,
critics enjoy being credited with
having "discovered" the film
before it became, so to speak,
"fashionable" to like it. However,
this often leads to pointless
guessing games on the part of
critics as to what will or will not
be popular.
Last year Hollis Alpert (who
always seems particularly anxious
to be the driver of critical
bandwagons) predicted that the
dreadful Joanna would become
another Graduate or Bonnie and

Clyde, that it would "signal
another change of direction."
Well, audiences and other critics
saw differently and Mr. Alpert
wound up with egg on his face.
Beware of critics with clairvoyant
tendencies!
Belatedly, I arrive at my review
of Devil by the Tail. Without
going off any deep ends, I can say
that the film is doomed to stay

with us and pass out of sight very
quietly, for it has already
experienced unspectacular runs in
New York and Los Angeles and is
not the type of picture which
evokes explosive, adjective-filled
reactions from its viewers. Despite
this (I hope not because of this), I
believe it to be the best film
released so far this year and it
confirms Philippe De Broca's
position as perhaps the most
entertaining director currently
working in the cinema.
I can expect many people to be
disappointed with Devil by the
Tail, if only because it isn't
"significant," because it doesn't
say anything important. But the
film's charm and persuasiveness lie
largely in that its even serious
matters should be taken with a sly
smile and a wink of the eye. De
Broca's consistant success is
attributable to his full
appreciation and subtle emphasis
of the delightful madness of the
human animal; De Broca is always
entertaining and in his ability to
entertain lies his artistry.
As in That Man From Rio and
King of Hearts, De Broca revolves
his film around a mischievous, just
slightly crazy leading man, in this
case the estimable Yves Montand.
Hiding from the police in an
isolated hotel/chateau, Montand
keeps himself occupied with four
lovely ladies of various ages.
Characters pop in and out and
complications arise as frequently
and ludicrously as in a farce by
Feydeau and while the film is not
a side-splitting extravaganza, it is
always warm and very engaging.
De Broca has that quality
which auteur critics search
desparately for in many directors
who simply don't have it; a
feeling, a point of view, an ouvre.
While they don't quite reach the
realm of fantasy, his films always
seem one step removed from
reality, with his characters
performing feats which seem
impossible . . . but then again, not
totally impossible.
Furthermore, De Broca is not
torn between a desire to please
the general audience and a desire
to impress the critics; usually, he
can do both at the same time and
if he can't entirely achieve the
latter, he'll happily settle for the
former. In recent films, Francois
Truffaut has seemingly devoted
some sequences to the public and
others to the academicians and
has created pictures which are not
totally satisfying on either level.
Similarly, Godard offers
sequences in all his works which
can be enjoyed by everyone but
then loads his films with obscure
references and in-jokes which can
only be appreciated by those who
are abreast of the film scene.
De Broca's work is given
consistancy through his repeated
collaboration with writer Daniel
Boulanger and the reigning king of
film music, Georges Delerue, as
well as a sweetly melancholy view
of life and romance which, for
me, is totally intoxicating. Some
people may find Devil by the Tail
trite and frivolous, while others
may be totally opposed to the
whole concept of escapism. I find
De Broca's current glorification of
humanity an encouraging sign that
exhuberance and vitality in the
cinema are still possible.
With at least three masterpieces
behind him at age 34, De Broca
stands as the only young French
director who has neither become
disoriented by success, nor
[preoccupied with politics, nor
been lured by the bigger budgets
and ''scope" offered by
Hollywood. I hope he stays in his
prime.
Devil by the Tail is now at the
Clay in San Francisco.


UN HOMME DANGEREUX-Yves Montand does very well for
himself in Philippe De Broca's marvellous new comedy, "Devil by the
Tail, " now at the Clay in San Francisco.
It is extremely difficult for a
critic to write about his very
favorite films. At best, he can
convince his readers to go see the
specific film in question but, no
matter how hard he- tries to
convey his love for a picture, he is
destined to be disappointed when
others seemingly cannot react as
passionately to it as he has.
Every moviegoer has certainly

Lola Monies, a nice romance by
Max Ophuls, being the greatest
film of all time. Similarly, Pauline
Kael came to wishful conclusions
after her apparently exaltant
experience at Long Day's Journey
Into Night, proclaiming,
''Whatever it is, it's great."

Though they would be
disappointed in me for not
flipping out at their favorites (or,
in fact, does the critic disappoint
the viewer in such cases?), 1 am
able to make allowances for their
specific tastes (or weaknesses) and
I still respect their general
perception and writing ability.
What this all comes down to is
an illumination of the role of the
critic. It must never be forgotten
that the critic is just a person,
pretty much like any other, whose
tastes are not necessarily any
better or worse than anyone else's
and whose preferences and visions
are indicative of no one's but his
own. After all, a critic's relevance
and worthiness should not be
determined by how often he
agrees with you but by whether
he is able to illuminate the
qualities of given films and artists
and whether he is able to
stimulate interest in films in
general.
Fortunately, film criticism is in
the process of becoming
recognized as a more personal art
rather than as a stronghold for
self-righteous advice-giving, as in
the Bosley Crowther days. Thus,
both respect for a writer's insights
and tolerance for his personal
idiosyncrasies has risen sharply
over the past few years (largely, I
might add, due to the work of
Sarris and Kael).

It seems to me that there are
two ego-oriented incentives which
drive critics to zealously support
their private favorites. Primarily,
they hope to save the films from
virtual extinction and, by
providing the advertising men
with some juicy quotes, hope to
generate enough public interest to
keep the films open for an extra
week or two, thus providing the
opportunity for more people to
see the films.
Occasionally, such critical
fervent can pay off; Sarris almost
singlehandedly engineering the
current playdates Lolu Monies is
enjoying in this country, while the
enthusiastic support of Laek and
Newsweek's Joseph Morgenstern
afforded the excellent Pretty
Poison some additional
engagements late last year.
Secondly, if what looks like an
underdog film does achieve
popular success in the long run,
critics enjoy being credited with
having "discovered" the film
before it became, so to speak,
"fashionable" to like it. However,
this often leads to pointless
guessing games on the part of
critics as to what will or will not
be popular.
Last year Hollis Alpert (who
always seems particularly anxious
to be the driver of critical
bandwagons) predicted that the
dreadful Joanna would become
another Graduate or Bonnie and

Clyde, that it would "signal
another change of direction."
Well, audiences and other critics
saw differently and Mr. Alpert
wound up with egg on his face.
Beware of critics with clairvoyant
tendencies!
Belatedly, I arrive at my review
of Devil by the Tail. Without
going off any deep ends, I can say
that the film is doomed to stay

with us and pass out of sight very
quietly, for it has already
experienced unspectacular runs in
New York and Los Angeles and is
not the type of picture which
evokes explosive, adjective-filled
reactions from its viewers. Despite
this (I hope not because of this), I
believe it to be the best film
released so far this year and it
confirms Philippe De Broca's
position as perhaps the most
entertaining director currently
working in the cinema.
I can expect many people to be
disappointed with Devil by the
Tail, if only because it isn't
"significant," because it doesn't
say anything important. But the
film's charm and persuasiveness lie
largely in that its even serious
matters should be taken with a sly
smile and a wink of the eye. De
Broca's consistant success is
attributable to his full
appreciation and subtle emphasis
of the delightful madness of the
human animal; De Broca is always
entertaining and in his ability to
entertain lies his artistry.
As in That Man From Rio and
King of Hearts, De Broca revolves
his film around a mischievous, just
slightly crazy leading man, in this
case the estimable Yves Montand.
Hiding from the police in an
isolated hotel/chateau, Montand
keeps himself occupied with four
lovely ladies of various ages.
Characters pop in and out and
complications arise as frequently
and ludicrously as in a farce by
Feydeau and while the film is not
a side-splitting extravaganza, it is
always warm and very engaging.
De Broca has that quality
which auteur critics search
desparately for in many directors
who simply don't have it; a
feeling, a point of view, an ouvre.
While they don't quite reach the
realm of fantasy, his films always
seem one step removed from
reality, with his characters
performing feats which seem
impossible . . . but then again, not
totally impossible.
Furthermore, De Broca is not
torn between a desire to please
the general audience and a desire
to impress the critics; usually, he
can do both at the same time and
if he can't entirely achieve the
latter, he'll happily settle for the
former. In recent films, Francois
Truffaut has seemingly devoted
some sequences to the public and
others to the academicians and
has created pictures which are not
totally satisfying on either level.
Similarly, Godard offers
sequences in all his works which
can be enjoyed by everyone but
then loads his films with obscure
references and in-jokes which can
only be appreciated by those who
are abreast of the film scene.
De Broca's work is given
consistancy through his repeated
collaboration with writer Daniel
Boulanger and the reigning king of
film music, Georges Delerue, as
well as a sweetly melancholy view
of life and romance which, for
me, is totally intoxicating. Some
people may find Devil by the Tail
trite and frivolous, while others
may be totally opposed to the
whole concept of escapism. I find
De Broca's current glorification of
humanity an encouraging sign that
exhuberance and vitality in the
cinema are still possible.
With at least three masterpieces
behind him at age 34, De Broca
stands as the only young French
director who has neither become
disoriented by success, nor
[preoccupied with politics, nor
been lured by the bigger budgets
and ''scope" offered by
Hollywood. I hope he stays in his
prime.
Devil by the Tail is now at the
Clay in San Francisco.


UN HOMME DANGEREUX-Yves Montand does very well for
himself in Philippe De Broca's marvellous new comedy, "Devil by the
Tail, " now at the Clay in San Francisco.
It is extremely difficult for a
critic to write about his very
favorite films. At best, he can
convince his readers to go see the
specific film in question but, no
matter how hard he- tries to
convey his love for a picture, he is
destined to be disappointed when
others seemingly cannot react as
passionately to it as he has.
Every moviegoer has certainly
felt this sense of hopelessness at
one time or another, for we all
have our favorite "little pictures"
which few other people have seen
and which no one else seems to be
able to appreciate in the "right"
way.
Even the most prestigious
movie critics feel the need to
persuade the public of the value
of their personal pets. Indeed,
well-known writers might be
inclined to have unusually strong
tendencies in this direction since
their enthusiastic endorsement
might help determine the fate of
the picture; it is very easy to go
overboard.

perception and writing ability.
What this all comes down to is
an illumination of the role of the
critic. It must never be forgotten
that the critic is just a person,
pretty much like any other, whose
tastes are not necessarily any
better or worse than anyone else's
and whose preferences and visions
are indicative of no one's but his
own. After all, a critic's relevance
and worthiness should not be
determined by how often he
agrees with you but by whether
he is able to illuminate the
qualities of given films and artists
and whether he is able to
stimulate interest in films in
general.
Fortunately, film criticism is in
the process of becoming
recognized as a more personal art
rather than as a stronghold for
self-righteous advice-giving, as in
the Bosley Crowther days. Thus,
both respect for a writer's insights
and tolerance for his personal
idiosyncrasies has risen sharply
over the past few years (largely, I
might add, due to the work of
Sarris and Kael).

It seems to me that there are
two ego-oriented incentives which
drive critics to zealously support
their private favorites. Primarily,
they hope to save the films from
virtual extinction and, by
providing the advertising men
with some juicy quotes, hope to
generate enough public interest to
keep the films open for an extra
week or two, thus providing the
opportunity for more people to
see the films.
Occasionally, such critical
fervent can pay off; Sarris almost
singlehandedly engineering the
current playdates Lolu Monies is
enjoying in this country, while the
enthusiastic support of Laek and
Newsweek's Joseph Morgenstern
afforded the excellent Pretty
Poison some additional
engagements late last year.
Secondly, if what looks like an
underdog film does achieve
popular success in the long run,
critics enjoy being credited with
having "discovered" the film
before it became, so to speak,
"fashionable" to like it. However,
this often leads to pointless
guessing games on the part of
critics as to what will or will not
be popular.
Last year Hollis Alpert (who
always seems particularly anxious
to be the driver of critical
bandwagons) predicted that the
dreadful Joanna would become
another Graduate or Bonnie and

Clyde, that it would "signal
another change of direction."
Well, audiences and other critics
saw differently and Mr. Alpert
wound up with egg on his face.
Beware of critics with clairvoyant
tendencies!
Belatedly, I arrive at my review
of Devil by the Tail. Without
going off any deep ends, I can say
that the film is doomed to stay

with us and pass out of sight very
quietly, for it has already
experienced unspectacular runs in
New York and Los Angeles and is
not the type of picture which
evokes explosive, adjective-filled
reactions from its viewers. Despite
this (I hope not because of this), I
believe it to be the best film
released so far this year and it
confirms Philippe De Broca's
position as perhaps the most
entertaining director currently
working in the cinema.
I can expect many people to be
disappointed with Devil by the
Tail, if only because it isn't
"significant," because it doesn't
say anything important. But the
film's charm and persuasiveness lie
largely in that its even serious
matters should be taken with a sly
smile and a wink of the eye. De
Broca's consistant success is
attributable to his full
appreciation and subtle emphasis
of the delightful madness of the
human animal; De Broca is always
entertaining and in his ability to
entertain lies his artistry.
As in That Man From Rio and
King of Hearts, De Broca revolves
his film around a mischievous, just
slightly crazy leading man, in this
case the estimable Yves Montand.
Hiding from the police in an
isolated hotel/chateau, Montand
keeps himself occupied with four
lovely ladies of various ages.
Characters pop in and out and
complications arise as frequently
and ludicrously as in a farce by
Feydeau and while the film is not
a side-splitting extravaganza, it is
always warm and very engaging.
De Broca has that quality
which auteur critics search
desparately for in many directors
who simply don't have it; a
feeling, a point of view, an ouvre.
While they don't quite reach the
realm of fantasy, his films always
seem one step removed from
reality, with his characters
performing feats which seem
impossible . . . but then again, not
totally impossible.
Furthermore, De Broca is not
torn between a desire to please
the general audience and a desire
to impress the critics; usually, he
can do both at the same time and
if he can't entirely achieve the
latter, he'll happily settle for the
former. In recent films, Francois
Truffaut has seemingly devoted
some sequences to the public and
others to the academicians and
has created pictures which are not
totally satisfying on either level.
Similarly, Godard offers
sequences in all his works which
can be enjoyed by everyone but
then loads his films with obscure
references and in-jokes which can
only be appreciated by those who
are abreast of the film scene.
De Broca's work is given
consistancy through his repeated
collaboration with writer Daniel
Boulanger and the reigning king of
film music, Georges Delerue, as
well as a sweetly melancholy view
of life and romance which, for
me, is totally intoxicating. Some
people may find Devil by the Tail
trite and frivolous, while others
may be totally opposed to the
whole concept of escapism. I find
De Broca's current glorification of
humanity an encouraging sign that
exhuberance and vitality in the
cinema are still possible.
With at least three masterpieces
behind him at age 34, De Broca
stands as the only young French
director who has neither become
disoriented by success, nor
[preoccupied with politics, nor
been lured by the bigger budgets
and ''scope" offered by
Hollywood. I hope he stays in his
prime.
Devil by the Tail is now at the
Clay in San Francisco.


UN HOMME DANGEREUX-Yves Montand does very well for
himself in Philippe De Broca's marvellous new comedy, "Devil by the
Tail, " now at the Clay in San Francisco.
It is extremely difficult for a
critic to write about his very
favorite films. At best, he can
convince his readers to go see the
specific film in question but, no
matter how hard he- tries to
convey his love for a picture, he is
destined to be disappointed when
others seemingly cannot react as
passionately to it as he has.
Every moviegoer has certainly
felt this sense of hopelessness at
one time or another, for we all
have our favorite "little pictures"
which few other people have seen
and which no one else seems to be
able to appreciate in the "right"
way.
Even the most prestigious
movie critics feel the need to
persuade the public of the value
of their personal pets. Indeed,
well-known writers might be
inclined to have unusually strong
tendencies in this direction since
their enthusiastic endorsement
might help determine the fate of
the picture; it is very easy to go
overboard.
Andrew Sarris was willing to
stake his critical reputation on
Lola Monies, a nice romance by
Max Ophuls, being the greatest
film of all time. Similarly, Pauline
Kael came to wishful conclusions
after her apparently exaltant
experience at Long Day's Journey
Into Night, proclaiming,
''Whatever it is, it's great."

Though they would be
disappointed in me for not
flipping out at their favorites (or,
in fact, does the critic disappoint
the viewer in such cases?), 1 am
able to make allowances for their
specific tastes (or weaknesses) and
I still respect their general
perception and writing ability.
What this all comes down to is
