## Aleksander Slobodyanik: Dazzling 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Musical genius must be, by
definition, rare, so it is seldom
that any of us hear true greatness.
It must give an inner glow to say
"I saw Oistrakh's first American
appearance" or "I played under
Toscanini."
This same quality of musical
performance was presented last
Friday at the Masonic, and it was
in the person of Aleksander
Slobodyanik, an unassuming,
modest pianist from Russia,
probably the best Soviet pianist
since Richter.
Mr. Slobodyanik plays with a
grace and a strength and a
maturity that belie his 24 years.
Since his seventh place showing in
the Warsaw Competition, when he
was sixteen, he has been building
an international reputation.
The audience at the Masonic
was responsive and astute. They
recognized the brilliance of Mr.
Slobodyanik as soon as he began
playing. The Beethoven "Sonata
in A flat Major" was clearly and
sensitively performed, and was
well-received. But it was after the
Chopin works that the audience
exploded.
The program indicated that Mr.
Slobodyanik would play two
Mazurkas, an Etude and a
Fantasie without interruption. His
Chopin is so much greater than
Van Cliburn's that metaphorical
comparisons cannot possibly
express it. A significant
percentage of the audience had
heard Cliburn in the same hall one
week earlier (both artists are on
the S.F. Music Series), and their
choice was clear.
After amazing performances of
the Mazurkas, Mr. Slobodyanik's
tempestuous virtuosity on the
Etude unloosed an avalanche of
applause, the release of the energy
he had generated in his audience.
And the intricate and delicate
Fantasie which followed only
added to the proof that Mr.
Slobodyanik may be the greatest
interpreter of Chopin today.
He is by no means limited to
Chopin, however. The next piece
on the program was Prokofiev's
"Sonata No. 7 in B flat Major," a
difficult, complex work in three
movements. Mr. Slobodyanik
performed magnificently, playing
hauntingly in the "Allegro
inquieto," in a full expressive
style in the "Andante caloroso,"

and with a cascade of virtuosity in
the "Precipitato" finale. The
audience was impressed, and
many gave a standing ovation at
this mid-point of the program.
The talk at intermission was of
complete amazement at the
dazzling performance of this
little-known artist. John Kornfeld,
producer of the superb S.F. Music
Series, has been doing what he can
to make this young Russian giant
known in this country. The Series
brought Mr. Slobodyanik to San
Francisco last year, and with the
fantastic impression made at this
concert, he will surely return
again.
The second half of the concert
was one piece, perhaps the finest
piece ever written for solo piano,
Moussorgsky's "Pictures at an
Exhibition." The piece is more
familiar in the orchestral version
scored by Ravel, for to perform a
tone-poem of symphonic
proportions alone requires a
pianist with stamina, ability, and a
vision which cannot be taught.
The piece is a series of eleven
sketches connected by a closing
theme, each one being
Moussorgsky's reaction to a
particular picture at an exhibition
he saw. He was so impressed by
the canvases that he immediately
put them to music.
It is seldom that compositions
of such magnitude are successful
as solo pieces. The symphonic
orchestra is a far easier medium,
because of the greater variations
in harmonics, and tone color, and
because of the sheer force which
120 players can generate. But in
the pure version, one man must
produce the intensity to carry the
piece to an audience.
Few pianists are equal to the
task, and as a result, the piano
version of "Pictures at an
Exhibition'' is seldomly
performed. A man with the
abilities of Mr. Slobodyanik is
required.
The results are truly
impressive. The music perfectly
reflects the subject matter of the
paintings, its own tableaus of
"The Promenade," "The Gnome,"
"The Old Castle," and all the
others.
"The Tuileries" was as gay and
lively as a Monet, and Mr.
Slobodyanik's fingers danced
across the keys as if it was the
music which would make the
paintings. The mood would shift
quickly from the sprightly "Ballet
of Chicks in Their Shells" to the
powerful "Rich and Poor," to the
gay "Limogesâ€”The Market
Place,'' to the somber
"Catacombs."
In "The Witches' Revelry," Mr.
Slobodyanik's hands became a
blur as the hypnotizing dance of

the witches sprang from his piano.
Round and round, the momentum
building, the frenzied dance
became the closing theme, "The
Great Gate of Kiev," as the
tension grew and grew, to the
final stormy climax.
The audience erupted with
cheers and applause such as I
havynever heard. For the first
time ever, I heard myself crying
"Bravo!" along with countless
others. The standing ovation
seemed too small a compliment to
pay such a dazzling performance.
Mr. Slobodyanik, who had been
stone-faced throughout the
concert, began to crack a wee
smile, he, too, realizing that this
had been a splendid performance.
Gracing us with an encore, Mr.
Slobodyanik gave such a
marvelous rendition of Liszt's "La
Campanella" that he received
another standing ovation, which
he answered with another Chopin
Mazurka. Obviously exhausted
after the marathon concert, he
pleaded with clasped hands to the

standing audience to let him go,
which we finally, reluctantly, did.
This concert will be long
remembered by those who were
fortunate enough to attend it. For
those who missed it, or who
hesitated because of the artist's
unfamiliar name, let me say that
they should order their tickets
early next year, for Aleksander
Slobodyanik will undoubtedly
command SRO house. He is
without a doubt the finest young
pianist today, and he has the
intensity and virtuosity to one
day be greater than Richter.
There is only one recording of
Mr. Slobodyanik available in this
country, but I understand there
will soon be more.
Melodiya-Angel, the
Russian-American partnership of
Capitol's quality label, has
recorded Mr. Slobodyanik playing
Prokofiev "Sonata No. 6,"
Haydn's "Sonata No. 48," and
four Chopin Mazurkas. Hopefully,
the next release will include the
Moussorgsky.
Musical genius must be, by

that any of us hear true greatness.

"I saw Oistrakh's first American

The audience erupted with
cheers and applause such as I
havynever heard. For the first
time ever, I heard myself crying
"Bravo!" along with countless
others. The standing ovation
seemed too small a compliment to
pay such a dazzling performance.
Mr. Slobodyanik, who had been
stone-faced throughout the
concert, began to crack a wee
smile, he, too, realizing that this
had been a splendid performance.
Gracing us with an encore, Mr.
Slobodyanik gave such a
marvelous rendition of Liszt's "La
Campanella" that he received
another standing ovation, which
he answered with another Chopin
Mazurka. Obviously exhausted
after the marathon concert, he
pleaded with clasped hands to the

standing audience to let him go,
which we finally, reluctantly, did.
This concert will be long
remembered by those who were
fortunate enough to attend it. For
those who missed it, or who
hesitated because of the artist's
unfamiliar name, let me say that
they should order their tickets
early next year, for Aleksander
Slobodyanik will undoubtedly
command SRO house. He is
without a doubt the finest young
pianist today, and he has the
intensity and virtuosity to one
day be greater than Richter.
There is only one recording of
Mr. Slobodyanik available in this
country, but I understand there
will soon be more.
Melodiya-Angel, the
Russian-American partnership of
Capitol's quality label, has
recorded Mr. Slobodyanik playing
Prokofiev "Sonata No. 6,"
Haydn's "Sonata No. 48," and
four Chopin Mazurkas. Hopefully,
the next release will include the
Moussorgsky.
Musical genius must be, by
definition, rare, so it is seldom
that any of us hear true greatness.
It must give an inner glow to say
"I saw Oistrakh's first American
appearance" or "I played under
Toscanini."
This same quality of musical
performance was presented last
Friday at the Masonic, and it was
in the person of Aleksander
Slobodyanik, an unassuming,
modest pianist from Russia,
probably the best Soviet pianist
since Richter.
Mr. Slobodyanik plays with a
grace and a strength and a
maturity that belie his 24 years.
Since his seventh place showing in
the Warsaw Competition, when he
was sixteen, he has been building
an international reputation.
The audience at the Masonic
was responsive and astute. They
recognized the brilliance of Mr.
Slobodyanik as soon as he began
playing. The Beethoven "Sonata
in A flat Major" was clearly and
sensitively performed, and was
well-received. But it was after the
Chopin works that the audience
exploded.
The program indicated that Mr.
Slobodyanik would play two
Mazurkas, an Etude and a
Fantasie without interruption. His
Chopin is so much greater than
Van Cliburn's that metaphorical
comparisons cannot possibly
express it. A significant
percentage of the audience had
heard Cliburn in the same hall one
week earlier (both artists are on
the S.F. Music Series), and their
choice was clear.
After amazing performances of
the Mazurkas, Mr. Slobodyanik's
tempestuous virtuosity on the
Etude unloosed an avalanche of
applause, the release of the energy
he had generated in his audience.
And the intricate and delicate
Fantasie which followed only
added to the proof that Mr.
Slobodyanik may be the greatest
interpreter of Chopin today.
He is by no means limited to
Chopin, however. The next piece
on the program was Prokofiev's
"Sonata No. 7 in B flat Major," a
difficult, complex work in three
movements. Mr. Slobodyanik
performed magnificently, playing
hauntingly in the "Allegro
inquieto," in a full expressive
style in the "Andante caloroso,"

and with a cascade of virtuosity in
the "Precipitato" finale. The
audience was impressed, and
many gave a standing ovation at
this mid-point of the program.
The talk at intermission was of
complete amazement at the
dazzling performance of this
little-known artist. John Kornfeld,
producer of the superb S.F. Music
Series, has been doing what he can
to make this young Russian giant
known in this country. The Series
brought Mr. Slobodyanik to San
Francisco last year, and with the
fantastic impression made at this
concert, he will surely return
again.
The second half of the concert
was one piece, perhaps the finest
piece ever written for solo piano,
Moussorgsky's "Pictures at an
Exhibition." The piece is more
familiar in the orchestral version
scored by Ravel, for to perform a
tone-poem of symphonic
proportions alone requires a
pianist with stamina, ability, and a
vision which cannot be taught.
The piece is a series of eleven
sketches connected by a closing
theme, each one being
Moussorgsky's reaction to a
particular picture at an exhibition
he saw. He was so impressed by
the canvases that he immediately
put them to music.
It is seldom that compositions
of such magnitude are successful
as solo pieces. The symphonic
orchestra is a far easier medium,
because of the greater variations
in harmonics, and tone color, and
because of the sheer force which
120 players can generate. But in
the pure version, one man must
produce the intensity to carry the
piece to an audience.
Few pianists are equal to the
task, and as a result, the piano
version of "Pictures at an
Exhibition'' is seldomly
performed. A man with the
abilities of Mr. Slobodyanik is
required.
The results are truly
impressive. The music perfectly
reflects the subject matter of the
paintings, its own tableaus of
"The Promenade," "The Gnome,"
"The Old Castle," and all the
others.
"The Tuileries" was as gay and
lively as a Monet, and Mr.
Slobodyanik's fingers danced
across the keys as if it was the
music which would make the
paintings. The mood would shift
quickly from the sprightly "Ballet
of Chicks in Their Shells" to the
powerful "Rich and Poor," to the
gay "Limogesâ€”The Market
Place,'' to the somber
"Catacombs."
In "The Witches' Revelry," Mr.
Slobodyanik's hands became a
blur as the hypnotizing dance of

the witches sprang from his piano.
Round and round, the momentum
building, the frenzied dance
became the closing theme, "The
Great Gate of Kiev," as the
tension grew and grew, to the
final stormy climax.
The audience erupted with
cheers and applause such as I
havynever heard. For the first
time ever, I heard myself crying
"Bravo!" along with countless
others. The standing ovation

he saw. He was so impressed by
the canvases that he immediately
put them to music.
It is seldom that compositions
of such magnitude are successful
as solo pieces. The symphonic
orchestra is a far easier medium,
because of the greater variations
in harmonics, and tone color, and
because of the sheer force which
120 players can generate. But in
the pure version, one man must
produce the intensity to carry the
piece to an audience.
Few pianists are equal to the
task, and as a result, the piano
version of "Pictures at an
Exhibition'' is seldomly
performed. A man with the
abilities of Mr. Slobodyanik is
required.
The results are truly
impressive. The music perfectly
reflects the subject matter of the
paintings, its own tableaus of
"The Promenade," "The Gnome,"
"The Old Castle," and all the
others.
"The Tuileries" was as gay and
lively as a Monet, and Mr.
Slobodyanik's fingers danced
across the keys as if it was the
music which would make the
paintings. The mood would shift
quickly from the sprightly "Ballet
of Chicks in Their Shells" to the
powerful "Rich and Poor," to the
gay "Limogesâ€”The Market
Place,'' to the somber
"Catacombs."
In "The Witches' Revelry," Mr.
Slobodyanik's hands became a
blur as the hypnotizing dance of

the witches sprang from his piano.
Round and round, the momentum
building, the frenzied dance
became the closing theme, "The
Great Gate of Kiev," as the
tension grew and grew, to the
final stormy climax.
The audience erupted with
cheers and applause such as I
havynever heard. For the first
time ever, I heard myself crying
"Bravo!" along with countless
others. The standing ovation
seemed too small a compliment to
pay such a dazzling performance.
Mr. Slobodyanik, who had been
stone-faced throughout the
concert, began to crack a wee
smile, he, too, realizing that this
had been a splendid performance.
Gracing us with an encore, Mr.
Slobodyanik gave such a
marvelous rendition of Liszt's "La
Campanella" that he received
another standing ovation, which
he answered with another Chopin
Mazurka. Obviously exhausted
after the marathon concert, he
pleaded with clasped hands to the

standing audience to let him go,
which we finally, reluctantly, did.
This concert will be long
remembered by those who were
fortunate enough to attend it. For
those who missed it, or who
hesitated because of the artist's
unfamiliar name, let me say that
they should order their tickets
early next year, for Aleksander
Slobodyanik will undoubtedly
command SRO house. He is
without a doubt the finest young
pianist today, and he has the
intensity and virtuosity to one
day be greater than Richter.
There is only one recording of
Mr. Slobodyanik available in this
country, but I understand there
will soon be more.
Melodiya-Angel, the
Russian-American partnership of
Capitol's quality label, has
recorded Mr. Slobodyanik playing
Prokofiev "Sonata No. 6,"
Haydn's "Sonata No. 48," and
four Chopin Mazurkas. Hopefully,
the next release will include the
Moussorgsky.
Musical genius must be, by
definition, rare, so it is seldom
that any of us hear true greatness.
It must give an inner glow to say
"I saw Oistrakh's first American
appearance" or "I played under
Toscanini."
This same quality of musical
performance was presented last
Friday at the Masonic, and it was
in the person of Aleksander
Slobodyanik, an unassuming,
modest pianist from Russia,
probably the best Soviet pianist
since Richter.
Mr. Slobodyanik plays with a
grace and a strength and a
maturity that belie his 24 years.
Since his seventh place showing in
the Warsaw Competition, when he
was sixteen, he has been building
an international reputation.
The audience at the Masonic
was responsive and astute. They
recognized the brilliance of Mr.
Slobodyanik as soon as he began
playing. The Beethoven "Sonata
in A flat Major" was clearly and
sensitively performed, and was
well-received. But it was after the
Chopin works that the audience
exploded.
The program indicated that Mr.
Slobodyanik would play two
Mazurkas, an Etude and a
Fantasie without interruption. His
Chopin is so much greater than
Van Cliburn's that metaphorical
comparisons cannot possibly
express it. A significant
percentage of the audience had
heard Cliburn in the same hall one
week earlier (both artists are on
the S.F. Music Series), and their
choice was clear.
After amazing performances of
the Mazurkas, Mr. Slobodyanik's
tempestuous virtuosity on the
Etude unloosed an avalanche of
applause, the release of the energy
he had generated in his audience.
And the intricate and delicate
Fantasie which followed only
added to the proof that Mr.
Slobodyanik may be the greatest
interpreter of Chopin today.
He is by no means limited to
Chopin, however. The next piece
on the program was Prokofiev's
"Sonata No. 7 in B flat Major," a
difficult, complex work in three
movements. Mr. Slobodyanik
performed magnificently, playing
hauntingly in the "Allegro
inquieto," in a full expressive
style in the "Andante caloroso,"

and with a cascade of virtuosity in
the "Precipitato" finale. The
audience was impressed, and
many gave a standing ovation at
this mid-point of the program.
The talk at intermission was of
complete amazement at the
dazzling performance of this
little-known artist. John Kornfeld,
producer of the superb S.F. Music
Series, has been doing what he can
to make this young Russian giant
known in this country. The Series
brought Mr. Slobodyanik to San
Francisco last year, and with the
fantastic impression made at this
concert, he will surely return
again.
The second half of the concert
was one piece, perhaps the finest
piece ever written for solo piano,
Moussorgsky's "Pictures at an
Exhibition." The piece is more
familiar in the orchestral version
scored by Ravel, for to perform a
tone-poem of symphonic
proportions alone requires a
pianist with stamina, ability, and a
vision which cannot be taught.
The piece is a series of eleven
sketches connected by a closing
theme, each one being
Moussorgsky's reaction to a
particular picture at an exhibition
he saw. He was so impressed by
the canvases that he immediately
put them to music.
It is seldom that compositions
