# For What It's Worth
## Crosby & Co.--Fantastic Show 
### COREY GOODMAN 
San Francisco has been getting a heavy load of good
music lately. A week ago we were saying that The Stones
concert was the greatest, and this week, all I can add is
that Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young weren't far behind.

Those who saw Crosby,
Stills, and Nash do their bit
for peace at the Moratorium
rally at the polo grounds, or
saw the same on T.V., are
probably wondering how
their S.F. debut came off
with Crowby's voice as
wrecked as it was. Saturday,
because of Crosby's voice
problem, the group tried all
the more and made up for
it — their spirit was
tremendous.
And it was a night to
remember for old Buffalo
Springfield fans. As it became
evident that Crosby couldn't
sing along on the acoustic set,
Neil Young and Steve Stills
brought back more
Springfield songs than
normal, and as Nash
remarked that "we don't

want to burn anyone," Young satisfied everyone with his
solo on "Mr. Soul."

But it was with their electric set that the group really
came alive. Backed by the strong rhythm section of Dallas
Taylor on drums and Greg Reeves on bass, the group went
through their popular electric songs from the first album
("Wooden Ships," "Long Time Gone") and finally into an
extended version of "Down by the River" from Young's
second solo album.
I remember when Stills appeared a few weeks back at
Winterland with the Dead, when he later sat on the side
and watched the Airplane. It seemed then that Stills really
wanted to be doing more blues with more guitar
interaction.
The first Crosby, Stills and Nash album isn't like that,
though. It is a great album, but its only problem is that
the voices push aside any good open blues work.
Blues Coming on Strong
But with their performance, and with Neil Young's
comments on KSAN the other night, I have a feeling that

their second album, coming
out soon, will be more into
what Stills and Young thrive
on: the 'live' quality. During
the acoustic set, Stills got
into "Black Queen," a song in
which he is able to let the
strong vocal step aside for
some equally strong blues
work on his guitar.
On FM radio lately, two
tapes have been getting
played. One is the long

version of the
Springfield's
"Bluebird," and
the other is the
original long
version (with
Stills and
Crowby) of
''Long Time
Gone." Listening
to both of these
you can hear
Stills get into a

song. Maybe now, with Stills and Young
together again, the same sort of thing will
come out on their second album.
It was good to see rock groups doing their
part for the Moratorium, and especially the

Cleveland Wrecking Company, who played in the Old
Union on Thursday night and on a truck during the march
Saturday. They're one of the unknown San Francisco
groups that should make it: they have a good, original
sound. One of their songs has been getting some air-time

on FM stations lately, and
with the upcoming release of
their first album on the
Fillmore label, they should be
heard a lot more.
And, the Poppycock did it
again by having the Riders of
the Purple Sage that past two
Thursday nights. This "black
spot" on Palo Alto's face
always needs Stan ford
support to survive. It is the
best local place to hear good
music. Tonight and Saturday,
the San Francisco Mine
Troupe, an excellent, if
underated group, will be at
the Poppycock.
The question in my mind
last Saturday night was who
was that prancing fellow with

the magic wand who danced out as Crosby and Co. came
back for their encore?
It looked a lot like lan Anderson, a flutist, composer,
and a lot of other things for Jethro Tull, who will be at
the Fillmore this week along with MCS and Sanpaku (next
week—The Kinks, Taj Mahal, and Sha-Na-Na).
