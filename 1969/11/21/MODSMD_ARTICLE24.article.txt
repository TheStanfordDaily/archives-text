# Nostalgia, Rads Don't Mix In Revue
## 
### HARRIET GOLD 
"Why didn't I live back in the
'fifties," moans a tired, embattled
Stanford freshman, expelled and
eminently draftable, in Ram's
Head original musical
contribution to Big Game week.
Despite its attempts at
"relevance" and its theme of
campus radicalism, "The Carnival
Down Below" seems to express a
similar nostalgia for an era when
the hoopla of Big Game week was
approached with passion,
sincerity, a clear conscience, and
no sense of irony whatsoever.
Ram's Head seems to feel
obliged to offer us a 1950's
musical with the message as the
difference, when most of us
would rather take our singing,
dancing, wit, and charm neat.
The show opens auspiciously
enough, with an attractive
triple-screen slide montage of
Stanford scenes played against a
well-chosen medley of rock songs.
Four of these presentations, put
together by Mike Heathman with
the help of Ben Johnson,
constitute the highlights of the
evening, with the last being
particularly effective.
Drab Flats
Unfortunately, the visual and
musical excitement of these
sections draw attention by
contrast to the curiously drab
flats and the warmed-over
Broadway tunes that mark most
of the show. The dialogue
resembles nothing so much as old
TV-comedy routines, and the
lyrics are a complete guide to the
cliche. The constant use of the
celeste and high, humming voices
in the accompaniments are
especially irritating, one can't help
but recall the Perry Como show
with its choirs of angels in every
arrangement.
That the audience obviously
enjoyed the show is a tribute to
the energy and enthusiasm of the

performers who, without the
single glaring exception that one
usually expects in a colelge show,
make the very most of the
material. Alan Mokler, who wrote
the show and shares credit for the
music with Gary Levinson, plays
Charlis Bates with an offhand
humor that is quite engaging, and
displays a talent for mugging and
dancing in the song "Welcome."
Suitably Bumbling
Jeff Schmidt is suitably
bumbling and confused as the
freshman going through an
identity crisis of sorts, and Betty
Leichlite, a beautiful girl, turns in
a relaxed performance as Julie
Gallagher, rather worldly radical.
Teri Brown as Marni Mason has
the funniest scene in the play and
milks it for all it's worth, tearfully
confessing that she "can't stand to
do another groovy thing."
The chorus is made up of
individuals who clearly know how
to dance, and it's a shame that
they are shunted off to a corner in
the party scene. The show as a
whole would benefit greatly from
more dances.
Radical Departure Necessary
Ram's Head doesn't need a
radical theme with a "message" so
much as it needs a radical
departure in its approach to its
material.
It's impossible to say whether
Johnnie Scott's rejected script for
the show that never happened last
year would have provided the shot
in he arm that the organization so
badly needs (a need it shares, of
course, with the traditional
Broadway musical), but it does
seem clear that Ram's Head will
have to provide more than
pleasant performances if it hopes
to continue to draw an audience
beyond fond parents and
dewy-eyed alumni.
