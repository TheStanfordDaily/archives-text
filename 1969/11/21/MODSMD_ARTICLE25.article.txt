# Remember Big Game Oath
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Oaths of loyalty, office, and
allegiance are pillars reinforcing
tradition.
The downhill trend of the Big
Game tradition in recent years is
attributable to the absence of any
formal pledge with which the
Stanford student can join with his
peers in perpetuating the solemn
tradition of inter-campus warfare.
As the flames begin to lick the
lowest timbers of the bonfire
tonight, join your comrades in a
re-affirmation of belief of
Stanford's superiority.
"I state your name or a
reasonable facsimile in view of the
Stanford traditions of academic
freedom, liberty of independent
belief and expression, personal

sovereignty, the right to ally with
any organization or institution,
the sanctity of private property,
the right of freedom to walk the
streets in safety, and the right of
personal dignity ; do pledge myself
to a policy of personal violence,
intense hate, name calling,
property destruction, flagrant
obscenities, unprovoked
aggression, unwavering
persecution, incurable prejudice,
unmentionable debaucheries,
unceasing malince, and many
other acts deemed necessary
toward the persons, beings, or
representatives of the bastion of
intolerance known as the
University of California at
Berkeley."
