# MECHA Project To Aid Mountain View Chicanos
## 
### EILEEN HALEY 
"You could call it an awareness
project," said Fred Alvarez,
president of MECHA, describing
the project that MECHA is
undertaking in Mountain View. In
co-operation with the Stanford
Work-Study Program, MECHA has
chosen the Mt. View Chicano
population for a project which is
to involve all Stanford students
who qualify for Work-Study and
other students as volunteers. The
project will encompass tutoring,
recreational and cultural activities,
and classes in everything from
photography to consumer
education.
According to Fred, the
program's goal is to make the
Chicano community aware of its
potential, and the problems and
opportunities existing in its
environment.
What are the problems? In
Mountain View, the Chicanos are
being forced to move out as the
city widens streets and puts in
interchanges, demolishing
low-cost housing in favor of
higher priced apartments where
families with children aren't
allowed, even if they can pay the
rent.

Another dimculty is that to a
casual observer, the Chicano
population isn't very visible, nor
are its problems, so "you have to
convince people thai, the problem
exists" before something can be
done, says Jesse Aguirre, director
of Work-Study.
Annie Gutierrez Marlowe, a
law student, is beginning a survey
soon, to provide the statistical
proof that certain problems do
exist in Mt. View.
Problems Specified
Next to housing, education is
the area of major need. In Mt.
View High School the drop-out
among Chicanos is 65% and only a
very small percentage of those
who graduate go on to college.
MECHA is planning a tutorial
program so that students having
difficulties could be tutored as
much as six hours a week, (watch
OATQ for details).
Another problem is that many
Chicanos don't know what's
available to them in the way of
recreational or cultural
experiences. During the summer
as part of the pilot project, Fred,
Jesse, and Annie took kids on
field trips to the beach and to a
hacienda, to make them aware of

what their surroundings could
offer.
Community Center
A community center is needed,
so that people can come together
to share their problems, talk
about solutions, conduct classes,
work on projects, or just relax. It
would also serve as a source of
information on the agencies in the
community that can offer
assistance.
These Chicanos, all full-time
Stanford students, propose to
tackle the problem on all fronts.
The community center is
envisioned as the focus of all sorts
of activities and services: cultural,
educational, recreational,
informational, legal, medical, and
even day care.
Tutoring
After finding a suitable
building to serve as a community
center, they'll begin tutoring
Chicano students from Mt. View
High School. They plan to expand
to junior high and grade schools as
soon as possible.
Classes ranging from sewing,
cooking, art, photography, and
sports, to culture, history,
politics, consumer education, and
music are possibilities, depending
on he community need and desire
and the availability of people to
help run them.
Annie pointed out that all
"warm bodies" interested in
working with people could
probably offer some help.
Although the project was
organized by MECHA and is being
partially funded by Stanford
Work-Study, anyone may
participate. If a Stanford student
qualifies for Work-Study, he can
work on this project and get paid
as he would on any other job that
Work-Study provides.
Obstacles
The students involved are
confronting some pretty large
obstacles, especially financial
ones, but Jesse seems determined
that these can be overcome.
Restrictions on Work-Study
students who must stop working
on a project once they have
earned their ceiling (determined
by financial aids) is the biggest
problem. Almost as soon as they
learn what to do, and get
acquainted with people, they
must quit the project.
Also, the project must match
funds with the university to help
pay its workers. This, Jesse says, is
very difficult due to lack of
available financing.
Undiscouraged, however, they are
continuing to plan and organize
the program.

field trips to the beach and to a
hacienda, to make them aware of

what their surroundings could
offer.
Community Center
A community center is needed,
so that people can come together
to share their problems, talk
about solutions, conduct classes,
work on projects, or just relax. It
would also serve as a source of
information on the agencies in the
community that can offer
assistance.
These Chicanos, all full-time
Stanford students, propose to
tackle the problem on all fronts.
The community center is
envisioned as the focus of all sorts
of activities and services: cultural,
educational, recreational,
informational, legal, medical, and
even day care.
Tutoring
After finding a suitable
building to serve as a community
center, they'll begin tutoring
Chicano students from Mt. View
High School. They plan to expand
to junior high and grade schools as
soon as possible.
Classes ranging from sewing,
cooking, art, photography, and
sports, to culture, history,
politics, consumer education, and
music are possibilities, depending
on he community need and desire
and the availability of people to
help run them.
Annie pointed out that all
"warm bodies" interested in
working with people could
probably offer some help.
Although the project was
organized by MECHA and is being
partially funded by Stanford
Work-Study, anyone may
participate. If a Stanford student
qualifies for Work-Study, he can
work on this project and get paid
as he would on any other job that
Work-Study provides.
Obstacles
The students involved are
confronting some pretty large
obstacles, especially financial
ones, but Jesse seems determined
that these can be overcome.
Restrictions on Work-Study
students who must stop working
on a project once they have
earned their ceiling (determined
by financial aids) is the biggest
problem. Almost as soon as they
learn what to do, and get
acquainted with people, they
must quit the project.
Also, the project must match
funds with the university to help
pay its workers. This, Jesse says, is
very difficult due to lack of
available financing.
Undiscouraged, however, they are
continuing to plan and organize
the program.
"You could call it an awareness
project," said Fred Alvarez,
president of MECHA, describing
the project that MECHA is
undertaking in Mountain View. In
co-operation with the Stanford
Work-Study Program, MECHA has
chosen the Mt. View Chicano
population for a project which is
to involve all Stanford students
who qualify for Work-Study and
other students as volunteers. The
project will encompass tutoring,
recreational and cultural activities,
and classes in everything from
photography to consumer
education.
According to Fred, the
program's goal is to make the
Chicano community aware of its
potential, and the problems and
opportunities existing in its
environment.
What are the problems? In
Mountain View, the Chicanos are
being forced to move out as the
city widens streets and puts in
interchanges, demolishing
low-cost housing in favor of
higher priced apartments where
families with children aren't
allowed, even if they can pay the
rent.

Another dimculty is that to a
casual observer, the Chicano
population isn't very visible, nor
are its problems, so "you have to
convince people thai, the problem
exists" before something can be
done, says Jesse Aguirre, director
of Work-Study.
Annie Gutierrez Marlowe, a
law student, is beginning a survey
soon, to provide the statistical
proof that certain problems do
exist in Mt. View.
Problems Specified
Next to housing, education is
the area of major need. In Mt.
View High School the drop-out
among Chicanos is 65% and only a
very small percentage of those
who graduate go on to college.
MECHA is planning a tutorial
program so that students having
difficulties could be tutored as
much as six hours a week, (watch
OATQ for details).
Another problem is that many
Chicanos don't know what's
available to them in the way of
recreational or cultural
experiences. During the summer
as part of the pilot project, Fred,
Jesse, and Annie took kids on
field trips to the beach and to a
hacienda, to make them aware of

what their surroundings could
offer.
