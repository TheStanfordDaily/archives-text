# 'Fort Jackson 8'
## Anti-War GI's Organize Army 
### JOHN SLOAN Military Editor 
"The times, they are a
changing. This was the dominant
theme at the foundation meeting
o! a new antiwar group on
campus, the Student Mobilization
Committee, (SMC). Speaking at
the tirst meeting, held in the TMU
large lounge Wednesday were Joe
Cole, a (II anti-war activist, and
Howard Cohen, a regional
organizer for the SMC.
Joe Cole began the meeting by
describing his attempts while
serving in the Army to organize
GTs who were against the war. He
is a member of the "Fort Jackson
8" who were given undesirable
discharges for their activities, and
who are now suing the
government as a result.
''There is an anti • w a r
movement inside the army—it's
growing, and people must now sit
up and take notice of it. The Gl's
are beginning to take their rightful
place and now are often in the
vanguard of the movement," he
stated.
He went on to describe the
impossibility of Vietnamization of
the war, citing the 20% desertion
rate in the South Vietnamese
forces, and calling the ARVN
troops an "American Vietnamese
Army."
Gl's United
Cole then traced the founding
of Gl's United, the anti-war
organization, from its beginnings
in the racial struggles of Fort
Jackson, to its growth into an
organization that has spread
completely across the US and into
many of the foreign military
bases.
"The army is the most racist
institution in this country," he
said. "There has to be another
alternative." So Cole, who is
white, and Joe Miles, another
member of the "Fort Jackson 8,"
who is black, started the Gl's
United, to protest both the racism
in the army and the war in
Vietnam.
They began with meetings and
discussion groups and eventually
this evolved into action to bring
forth their ideas into army
classrooms. This lead to
confrontation, arrest and
discharge. "We have a right to
come out and talk about Vietnam;
there is nowhere in the
constitution that says Gl's have
no rights," he declared.
Protest Won
"We did not violate any army
regulations, but the army
originally wanted to court martial
us to nine years in prison for such
trumped up charges as inciting a
riot, disturbing the peace and
disrespect to an officer. But
eventually the Pentagon dropped
the charges.

"We faced them head on and
won, and now we cannot remain
underground. We felt there was no
way they could justify the war.
The army had to cave in.
"If the Gl's cannot protest the
war, who else in this country
can?"
SMC Explained
The second speaker was
Howard Cohen, a student of San
Francisco State and also a
member of the regional
committee of SMC. He outlined
SMC as an organization "based
totally on the belief in an
immediate end to the war. As
such SMC is non-exclusionary and
welcomes anybody from SDS to
Young Republicans."
It is an organization which was
founded three years ago, and has
since grown rapidly. It is highly
decentralized so that every
chapter decides its own course of
action—but it does have national
nd regional offices.

"At S.F. State we have
everyone from anarchists to
apolitical liberals. The SMC is able
to do what other organizations
such as the SDS, Young Socialists
or Young Democrats can't
because it focuses on only one ill
and can therefore bring all people
together."
Action Policies
The SMC, according to Cohen,
will not endorse any political
candidate. He cited politicians
who have declared themselves

'peace candidates' and yet have
not supported immediate
withdrawal of US forces from
Vietnam as a reason.
''We believe in mass
participation and mass incidents
which are lawful and peaceful
because they are the most
effective and involve the most
people," he stated.
Already the SMC is preparing
fact sheets on university
complicity with the military,
working to organize high school
students, protesting the war
wherever top government officials
travel, and preparing to set up a
second "War Crimes Tribunal."
Involved in Moratoriums
The SMC has also been very
involved with the organization of
the recent Moratoriums, doing
much of the behind the scenes
work, joining with the New
Mobilization Committee in its
activities.
"We have to grow to the point
where we can reach out to bring
in all students and get them
involved. They must have faith in
the SMC," he stressed.
"The way we are going to end
this war is to get more people
involved. The times are a
'changing. We, the people, can and
must make the changes. We can
no longer afford to leave it up to
Nixon and Agnew."
The next meeting of the
Student Mobilization Committee
will be 7:30 next Tuesday evening
in Serra lounge. In the meantime,
information can be obtained from
Bertie Anderson or Deborah
Shenfeld at 327-2920 ex. 639 in
Serra House.

8" who were given undesirable
discharges for their activities, and
who are now suing the
government as a result.
''There is an anti • w a r
movement inside the army—it's
growing, and people must now sit
up and take notice of it. The Gl's
are beginning to take their rightful
place and now are often in the
vanguard of the movement," he
stated.
He went on to describe the
impossibility of Vietnamization of
the war, citing the 20% desertion
rate in the South Vietnamese
forces, and calling the ARVN
troops an "American Vietnamese
Army."
Gl's United
Cole then traced the founding
of Gl's United, the anti-war
organization, from its beginnings
in the racial struggles of Fort
Jackson, to its growth into an
organization that has spread
completely across the US and into
many of the foreign military
bases.
"The army is the most racist
institution in this country," he
said. "There has to be another
alternative." So Cole, who is
white, and Joe Miles, another
member of the "Fort Jackson 8,"
who is black, started the Gl's
United, to protest both the racism
in the army and the war in
Vietnam.
They began with meetings and
discussion groups and eventually
this evolved into action to bring
forth their ideas into army
classrooms. This lead to
confrontation, arrest and
discharge. "We have a right to
come out and talk about Vietnam;
there is nowhere in the
constitution that says Gl's have
no rights," he declared.
Protest Won
"We did not violate any army
regulations, but the army
originally wanted to court martial
us to nine years in prison for such
trumped up charges as inciting a
riot, disturbing the peace and
disrespect to an officer. But
eventually the Pentagon dropped
the charges.

"We faced them head on and
won, and now we cannot remain
underground. We felt there was no
way they could justify the war.
The army had to cave in.
"If the Gl's cannot protest the
war, who else in this country
can?"
SMC Explained
The second speaker was
Howard Cohen, a student of San
Francisco State and also a
member of the regional
committee of SMC. He outlined
SMC as an organization "based
totally on the belief in an
immediate end to the war. As
such SMC is non-exclusionary and
welcomes anybody from SDS to
Young Republicans."
It is an organization which was
founded three years ago, and has
since grown rapidly. It is highly
decentralized so that every
chapter decides its own course of
action—but it does have national
nd regional offices.

"At S.F. State we have
everyone from anarchists to
apolitical liberals. The SMC is able
to do what other organizations
such as the SDS, Young Socialists
or Young Democrats can't
because it focuses on only one ill
and can therefore bring all people
together."
Action Policies
The SMC, according to Cohen,
will not endorse any political
candidate. He cited politicians
who have declared themselves

'peace candidates' and yet have
not supported immediate
withdrawal of US forces from
Vietnam as a reason.
''We believe in mass
participation and mass incidents
which are lawful and peaceful
because they are the most
effective and involve the most
people," he stated.
Already the SMC is preparing
fact sheets on university
complicity with the military,
working to organize high school
students, protesting the war
wherever top government officials
travel, and preparing to set up a
second "War Crimes Tribunal."
Involved in Moratoriums
The SMC has also been very
involved with the organization of
the recent Moratoriums, doing
much of the behind the scenes
work, joining with the New
Mobilization Committee in its
activities.
"We have to grow to the point
where we can reach out to bring
in all students and get them
involved. They must have faith in
the SMC," he stressed.
"The way we are going to end
this war is to get more people
involved. The times are a
'changing. We, the people, can and
must make the changes. We can
no longer afford to leave it up to
Nixon and Agnew."
The next meeting of the
Student Mobilization Committee
will be 7:30 next Tuesday evening
in Serra lounge. In the meantime,
information can be obtained from
Bertie Anderson or Deborah
Shenfeld at 327-2920 ex. 639 in
Serra House.

Army."
Gl's United
Cole then traced the founding
of Gl's United, the anti-war
organization, from its beginnings
in the racial struggles of Fort
Jackson, to its growth into an
organization that has spread
completely across the US and into
many of the foreign military
bases.
"The army is the most racist
institution in this country," he
said. "There has to be another
alternative." So Cole, who is
white, and Joe Miles, another
member of the "Fort Jackson 8,"
who is black, started the Gl's
United, to protest both the racism
in the army and the war in
Vietnam.
They began with meetings and
discussion groups and eventually
this evolved into action to bring
forth their ideas into army
classrooms. This lead to
confrontation, arrest and
discharge. "We have a right to
come out and talk about Vietnam;
there is nowhere in the
constitution that says Gl's have
no rights," he declared.
Protest Won
"We did not violate any army
regulations, but the army
originally wanted to court martial
us to nine years in prison for such
trumped up charges as inciting a
riot, disturbing the peace and
disrespect to an officer. But
eventually the Pentagon dropped
the charges.

"We faced them head on and
won, and now we cannot remain
underground. We felt there was no
way they could justify the war.
The army had to cave in.
"If the Gl's cannot protest the
war, who else in this country
can?"
SMC Explained
The second speaker was
Howard Cohen, a student of San
Francisco State and also a
member of the regional
committee of SMC. He outlined
SMC as an organization "based
totally on the belief in an
immediate end to the war. As
such SMC is non-exclusionary and
welcomes anybody from SDS to
Young Republicans."
It is an organization which was
founded three years ago, and has
since grown rapidly. It is highly
decentralized so that every
chapter decides its own course of
action—but it does have national
nd regional offices.

"At S.F. State we have
everyone from anarchists to
apolitical liberals. The SMC is able
to do what other organizations
such as the SDS, Young Socialists
or Young Democrats can't
because it focuses on only one ill
and can therefore bring all people
together."
Action Policies
The SMC, according to Cohen,
will not endorse any political
candidate. He cited politicians
who have declared themselves

'peace candidates' and yet have
not supported immediate
withdrawal of US forces from
Vietnam as a reason.
''We believe in mass
participation and mass incidents
which are lawful and peaceful
because they are the most
effective and involve the most
people," he stated.
Already the SMC is preparing
fact sheets on university
complicity with the military,
working to organize high school
students, protesting the war
wherever top government officials
travel, and preparing to set up a
second "War Crimes Tribunal."
Involved in Moratoriums
The SMC has also been very
involved with the organization of
the recent Moratoriums, doing
much of the behind the scenes
work, joining with the New
Mobilization Committee in its
activities.
"We have to grow to the point
where we can reach out to bring
in all students and get them
involved. They must have faith in
the SMC," he stressed.
"The way we are going to end
this war is to get more people
involved. The times are a
'changing. We, the people, can and
must make the changes. We can
no longer afford to leave it up to
Nixon and Agnew."
The next meeting of the
Student Mobilization Committee
will be 7:30 next Tuesday evening
in Serra lounge. In the meantime,
information can be obtained from
Bertie Anderson or Deborah
Shenfeld at 327-2920 ex. 639 in
Serra House.

ANTI-WAR SPEAKER—Joe Cole, a member of the 'Fort Jackson
Eight,' spoke here Wednesday.
"The times, they are a
changing. This was the dominant
theme at the foundation meeting
o! a new antiwar group on
campus, the Student Mobilization
Committee, (SMC). Speaking at
the tirst meeting, held in the TMU
large lounge Wednesday were Joe
Cole, a (II anti-war activist, and
Howard Cohen, a regional
organizer for the SMC.
Joe Cole began the meeting by
describing his attempts while
serving in the Army to organize
GTs who were against the war. He
is a member of the "Fort Jackson
8" who were given undesirable
discharges for their activities, and
who are now suing the
government as a result.
''There is an anti • w a r
movement inside the army—it's
growing, and people must now sit
up and take notice of it. The Gl's
are beginning to take their rightful
place and now are often in the
vanguard of the movement," he
stated.
He went on to describe the
impossibility of Vietnamization of
the war, citing the 20% desertion
rate in the South Vietnamese
forces, and calling the ARVN
troops an "American Vietnamese
Army."
