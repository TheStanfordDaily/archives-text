# New Courses Set By Biology Dept.
## 
### 
The Biology Department is
offering several special courses
winter and spring quarters. To
meet the requirements of senior
pre-medical students, Biology
6 — General Biology
Laboratory—will be offered in the
winter and Biology 12 in the
spring. These will be for
graduating seniors and graduate
students.
Upper division and graduate
students may also take a new
course, Biology 163, called
"Systems Analysis in Human
Ecology." This course will deal
with system characterization,
mathematical modeling, and
computer simulation, and will be
given in seminar form.
A number of classes will also
be offered for majors and

nonmajors who have taken at least
Biology 10. Winter courses
include Immunobiology, Topics in
Developmental Immunology, and
The Physiological Basis of
Behavior.
In the spring, Invertebate
Biology, Freshwater Biology,
Systematics and Ecology of
Vascular Plants, and Evolutionary
Genetics will be given.
In addition, Biology 150 will
be offered in the winter with the
only prerequisite being an
elementary biology course.
Biology 1 will be given in the
spring for those who have not
taken Biology 10.
Biology may be taken next
autumn by those who have taken
only Biology 10.
