# Waste Canned
## Solons Bag Trash 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
"We are in an age where we are
standing knee deep in our garbage,
shooting rockets at the moon."
This pointed observation was
made by San Francisco City
Administrator Thomas Mellon,
one of the dozen state and local
officials who testified yesterday
before the Assembly Committee
on Natural Resources and
Conservation.
The commiteee, chaired by
Assemblyman George Milias
(whose district encompasses
Stanford), held a public hearing
here yesterday to consider
California's problems in solid
waste management.
Milias has said his committee
intends to develop minimum
statewide standards for solid
waste disposal, and long range
planning and research programs
for the re-use, conversion, and
control of solid wastes.
Crisis Proportions
Mellon stated that the San
Francisco waste disposal problem
has reacehd crisis proportions.
The private landfill companies
presently disposing of San
Francisco's solid wastes in
adjacent San Mateo county will
exhaust its landfill reserves by
1974.
Proposed solutions to the
increasingly critical San Francisco
problem have included such ideas
as transportation by special trains
to land disposal sites in the
remote Lassen County desert, 350

miles away, and dumping at sea
from special garbage barges.
The problem is basically the
same for all California
communities: how to dispose of
solid wastes without polluting and
defiling the environment.
In past years, solid wastes have
been disposed of mainly by
burning them, burying them in

landfill projects, or dumping them
in the ocean, especially in the San
Francisco Bay.
Air Pollution
But incineration of wastes can
cause substantial air pollution,
landfill projects become serious
public health hazards when not
carefully controlled, and the
dumping of wastes at sea has
created grave concern about the
effect on the marine ecology.
In his report to the committee,
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
Officer D.J. Callaghan voiced
these concerns. "It is apparent
that the disposal of compacted
garbage in the ocean could pose a
threat to the ecology of the sea.
Will the bales of garbage in the
ocean disintegrate and wash onto
the beach? Will they disturb the
natural plant-fish balance. Much
research is needed in this area to
answer these questions."
Dr. John M. Heslep, deputy
director of environmental health
for the State Department of
Public Health, warned that "We
cannot continue indefinitely to
bury or burn our wastes.
Nutrient-bearing organic material
should be returned to the land,
and metals and other reusable
materials must be salvaged." Such
un-reusable items as one-way
bottles, aluminum beer cans, and
non-degradable plastic containers
may have to go, he said.
The committee will meet again
today at 10:00 a.m. in the Forum
room of the Meyer Library.
