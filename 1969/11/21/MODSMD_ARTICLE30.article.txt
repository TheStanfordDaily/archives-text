# Mexican Ex-Communist To Speak On Stalinist Russia
## 
### JULIE FEHRING 
"I have lived through some
events of public interest," claims
Bertram Wolfe, noted scholar,
author and lecturer, currently a
senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace. Mr. Wolfe
will be sharing some of his
experiences in a public lecture on
Monday, November 24, in
Tresidder, Room 270 at 4:15 p.m.
He is to speak of his adventures
as a Mexican delegate in Stalinist
Russia.
As one of the founders of the
American Communist Party in
1917, and later a leader in both

the Mexican Communist Party,
and the American Communist
Party, he was an official delegate
to the Comintern of 1924 in
Moscow, where he represented the
Mexican Trade Unions, the
peasant unions of the state of
Veracruz, and the Mexican
Communist Party.
Although he is an American
citizen, Wolfe was living in Mexico
from 1922-1925 while teaching
high school in Mexico City. It was
then that he became involved with
the Communist Movement in
Mexico.
Pacifist
Wolfe first became interested

in Communism as a young man, at
that time more a pacifist than a
radical. He reflects, "I was taught
that the 20th Century would be
too civilized for war."
When the United States
entered World War I in 1917, he
founded an anti-war journal, and
with others, formed the American
Communist Party. He didn't want
to form an agency of a foreign
power, yet he believed that the
rulers of Russia were against war,
and as a pacifist he decided to
support their aims.
He admits. "I knew nothing of
Bolshevism at first."
Now an author and expert on
Russia, some of Mr. Wolfe's books
include Three Who Made A
Revolution and Strange
Communists I Have Known.
His books have been translated
into nineteen different languages.
He feels it is his responsibility to
inform people of his experiences
with Communism and why he
became disillusioned with it.
In the lecture on Monday, Mr.
Wolfe will be speaking with
personal insight and perspective of
the early Communist movement
and some of the Communist
leaders with whom he worked,
including Ho Chi Minh. The
lecture is sponsored by the
California Institute of
International Studies and is open
to the public without charge.
