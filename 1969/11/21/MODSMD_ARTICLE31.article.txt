# Prof Predicts Sato Dilemma
## 
### 
The U.S.-Japan Defense Treaty
which gives U.S. control of
Okinawa should be modified next
year to allow Japan to resume
administration of the big island, a
Stanford political scientist
suggests.
Prof. Nobutake Ike, writing in
the November issue of The
Stanford Alumni Almanac, points
out that leftist opposition to the
treaty, already nearly reaching the
critical point in Japan, may well
cause the Sato government to fall
if the U.S. does not yield some
sovereignty.
The 1960 treaty maintains a
U.S. nuclear umbrella and
unilateral defense agreement with
Japan. Prof. Ike suggests the U.S.
could maintain its existing
Okinawan bases, but with the
same restrictions that now apply
to bases retained within Japan
proper.
This includes giving the U.S.
the right to "station land, sea and
air forces in bases and to deploy
such forces in and around Japan
against external attack, but also
for maintaining the peace and
security of the Fast East,"
according to the treaty's wording.
Prof. Ike notes:
"American-Jap anese relations
have now reached a point where
critical re-examination is called
for and where new understandings
and agreements must be arrived
at . . . During the next decade the
U.S. and Japan will have to adjust
to powerful tides that are moving
in Asia.
"It appears certain that as a
result of the Vietnam war,
American influence, which has
been so powerful, will recede.
Japan's position in Asia, in turn is
bound to be affected, whether the
Japanese like it or not.

"One does not have to look
into a crystal ball to predict that
past arrangements .. . between
these two countries will have to
be modified if the friendly
relationship that has existed in
recent decades is to continue into
the 1970's and '80's," Prof. Ike
observes.
He points out that the U.S.
armed protection of Japan has
allowed it to prosper and become
''the third (economic)
super-power" behind the U.S. and
Russia. "Given the Japanese
dependence on American military
power for their national defense,
and the importance of the
American market for Japanese
goods, the U.S. clearly has
tremendous bargaining power in
this instance," he notes.
If Prime Minister Eisaku Sato,
now enroute to Washington to
re-negotiate the treaty, returns
with meaningful concessions on
the future status of Okinawa "his
political position in his country
would be substantially enhanced."
But since the Pentagon is most
reluctant to accede to Japanese
wishes, especially on the use of
nuclear weapons and the "prior
consultation" requirement of the
traty before U.S. troops can be
deployed elsewhere in Asia, there
will be some "hard choices" for
U.S. policy makers, Prof. Ike
shows.
If the U.S. refused to budge on
Okinawa, the Sato government
could fall and the U.S. could lose
its bases in Japan, he believes.
Though this might weaken the
U.S. military position in the
Western Pacific, Japan would be
forced to strengthen her own
armed forces, though she would
never become a nuclear power.

wishes, especially on the use of
nuclear weapons and the "prior
consultation" requirement of the
traty before U.S. troops can be
deployed elsewhere in Asia, there
will be some "hard choices" for
U.S. policy makers, Prof. Ike
shows.
If the U.S. refused to budge on
Okinawa, the Sato government
could fall and the U.S. could lose
its bases in Japan, he believes.
Though this might weaken the
U.S. military position in the
Western Pacific, Japan would be
forced to strengthen her own
armed forces, though she would
never become a nuclear power.
The U.S.-Japan Defense Treaty
which gives U.S. control of
Okinawa should be modified next
year to allow Japan to resume
administration of the big island, a
Stanford political scientist
suggests.
Prof. Nobutake Ike, writing in
the November issue of The
Stanford Alumni Almanac, points
out that leftist opposition to the
treaty, already nearly reaching the
critical point in Japan, may well
cause the Sato government to fall
if the U.S. does not yield some
sovereignty.
The 1960 treaty maintains a
U.S. nuclear umbrella and
unilateral defense agreement with
Japan. Prof. Ike suggests the U.S.
could maintain its existing
Okinawan bases, but with the
same restrictions that now apply
to bases retained within Japan
proper.
This includes giving the U.S.
the right to "station land, sea and
air forces in bases and to deploy
such forces in and around Japan
against external attack, but also
for maintaining the peace and
security of the Fast East,"
according to the treaty's wording.
Prof. Ike notes:
"American-Jap anese relations
have now reached a point where
critical re-examination is called
for and where new understandings
and agreements must be arrived
at . . . During the next decade the
U.S. and Japan will have to adjust
to powerful tides that are moving
in Asia.
"It appears certain that as a
result of the Vietnam war,
American influence, which has
been so powerful, will recede.
Japan's position in Asia, in turn is
bound to be affected, whether the
Japanese like it or not.

"One does not have to look
into a crystal ball to predict that
past arrangements .. . between
these two countries will have to
be modified if the friendly
relationship that has existed in
recent decades is to continue into
the 1970's and '80's," Prof. Ike
observes.
He points out that the U.S.
armed protection of Japan has
allowed it to prosper and become
''the third (economic)
super-power" behind the U.S. and
Russia. "Given the Japanese
dependence on American military
power for their national defense,
and the importance of the
American market for Japanese
goods, the U.S. clearly has
tremendous bargaining power in
this instance," he notes.
If Prime Minister Eisaku Sato,
now enroute to Washington to
re-negotiate the treaty, returns
with meaningful concessions on
the future status of Okinawa "his
political position in his country
would be substantially enhanced."
But since the Pentagon is most
reluctant to accede to Japanese
wishes, especially on the use of
nuclear weapons and the "prior
consultation" requirement of the
traty before U.S. troops can be
deployed elsewhere in Asia, there
will be some "hard choices" for
