# Asian Americans Organize Alliance
## 
### BETTY NISHIOKA 
The Asian-American Student Alliance (ASSA) is the official name
for the Asian-American students who have been in the process of
actively establishing an organization at Stanford for the past month.
The title was adopted at a meeting Wednesday night by the steering
committee of the organization.
The steering committee, composed of representatives from present
committees which will undergo reorganization next quarter, discussed
activities currently under formulation. These include the initiation of
personal problems seminars and encounter groups to discuss common
dilemmas among Asian-Americans, the presentation of cultural events
for Asian-American culture as well as native Asian cultures, and the
extension of tutorial programs in surrounding communities.
An undergraduate special on the Asian-American experience in a
historical perspective is being considered for winter and spring
quarters, and library collections of literature pertinent to
Asian-American students will be expanded.
The Alliance also plans to publish periodic newsletters next
quarter, when it will be situated in an office in a building on Alvarado
Row. An office-warming party early in the quarter will be one of the
group's social events.
Structure of AASA
The steering committee proceeded to discuss the future
organizational structure of the group.
The policy-making function of the Alliance will be handled by a
steering committee elected quarterly and consisting mainly of general
officers and representatives from stading committees. In addition,
there will be three rotating at-large seats.
The structure of the Alliance will be delineated in a constitution
which will be submitted for inclusion into the ASSU Bylaws. In
addition, a working budget will be introduced to the ASSU Senate
within the next few weeks.
The future of AASA will depend on the agreement of the Senate to
support the Alliance as an operative element within the Associated
Students.
