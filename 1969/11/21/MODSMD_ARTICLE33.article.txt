Stanford Women's Liberation
in its third large meeting of the
quarter Wednesday evening
discussed a proposed program for
the group, including a general
statement of purpose and specific
action in the areas of admissions
policy, employment, health, child
care, and education of women in
the S' 'i ord Community.
A hough there was
disagreement over the language to
be used in the statement of
general purpose, the
approximately 50 women present
did adopt specific proposals
concerning changes in admissions
policy and employment.
Among the objectives accepted
by the group were: an end to the
quota on women students; open
admission admissions for national
minority and working class
people; no discrimination in
admissions on the basis of sex,
age, class, race, or marital status;
recruitment of women, national
minority, and working class
people in all fields of graduate

study; revision of financial aid and
admissions policies to enable
mothers and working women to
attend school part-time, and
scheduling of more night classes;
fees for less than half-time loads
to be charged per unit; equal
opportunity for women,
especially national minority group
women, in hiring and promotion;
and expansion of existing
minority financial aid programs to
include women.
Small groups were organized to
work for child care aid to mothers
in the Stanford community,
abortion counseling and
unregulated prescription of
contraceptives, and a course on
the history of the liberation
struggle of women.
W.L. will meet again on
December 3 to discuss other
demands for changes in the
university's policies towards
women. The meeting is open to all
members of the Stanford
community — male and
female—who are interested in
Women's Liberation.
