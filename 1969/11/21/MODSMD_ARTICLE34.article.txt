# '5 Marijuana Cigarettes'
## Republican Hits Drugs, Crime 
### PAUL PAPANEK 
"I'm exploring the possibilities of running
for Attorney General of California. I'm
giving the idea very serious consideration,"
said Director of the California Human
Relations Agency Spencer Williams
Wednesday.
"I feel that with my past experience my
qualifications are superior to those of the
other candidates,'' Williams told a very small
group of stalwart Republicans who turned
out for the 46 year old administrator's talk.
When asked what he specifically could
contribute to the job that others could not,
Williams noted that "the present Attorney-
General has been woefully silent and inactive
in the areas of crime prevention, illegal drug
traffic, and the entrance of organized crime
into the state."
"I would be active in these areas,"
Williams asserted, citing his past experience
as chairman of the State Board of
Corrections, his legal background, and his
twelve years as Santa Clara County Counsel.
Drug Abuse
Williams came down hard on the question
of drug abuse. There were 20,000 arrests last
year for drug offenses, he said; and he
predicted that there would be 45,000 this
year.
"The availability is frightening. We picked
up enough dangerous drugs last year to give
every man, woman, and child in a major city
half a gram of heroin, five marijuana
cigarettes, and six pep pills."
He considered Operation Intercept a
success. "I don't think Intercept was a factor
in raising prices," commented Williams, who

has also served as chairman of the California
Conference on Drug Abuse. "But it did dry
up the supply for a short time; it directed
public attention to this problem; and it
made Mexico face up to its responsibilities."
Solution to Drug Problem
The answer to the drug problem, he
claimed, lies in educational programs like the
SOS ("Stamp Out Stupidity") program in
Santa Clara County, and in stricter law
enforcement.
"We have to have good tough
enforcement against the pushers," asserted
Williams, although he agreed that milder
penalties for first offender charged only with
possession might be advisable.
He also urged a re-examination of the
current laws of search and seizure, which
make convictions for drug offenses difficult.
He said he did not agree with those, like
Senator Barry Goldwater, who would
consider legalizing marijuana. "The excuse
that marijuana is no more dangerous than
alcohol doesn't convince me," he said,
observing that alcoholism it itself a very
serious problem.
"If the use of alcohol weren't so deeply
ingrained in our society, if alcohol were
something new coming out on the market
tomorrow, we wouldn't allow it."
Prison System Changes
Williams also commented on some recent
changes in the California prison system, in
particular a special rehabilitation program
which helps soon-to-be-released inmates to
re-adjust to outside life.
Williams remarked that the new policy of
allowing prisoners nearing parole to receive
extended visits from their families or even to

leave the prison for brief periods of time has
apparently been responsible for lowering the
rate of return of new convicts to prison from
42% to 34% over the past few years.
He said that his department placed a great
deal of emphasis on crime prevention, and
remarked that if his program could "turn
away three potential adolescent criminals
from crime each year, the program would be
profitable."
State Mental Health Program
Asked about curbacks in funds to mental
institutions by the Reagan administration,
Williams said he thought Reagan's policy had
been widely misunderstood. The governor's
policy, Williams siad, was to maintain, and
even improve, the standards now operative
in California mental institutions.
But because the patient population in
state hospitals has dropped from 36,000 in
1960 to 20,000 in 1967, with still further
declines anticipated, it has been possible to
reduce funds without sacrificing the quality
of service.
"Other states are looking to California
now for their standards. We're not looking
to other states," said Williams.
The burden of care has shifted from state
mental institutions to local institutions, and
state grants to these local institutions have
been raised from 16 million dollars to 53
million dollars since Reagan took office.
Williams, as head of the Human Relations
Agency, administrates a budget of 3'/2 billion
dollars and has 48,000 employees. He stated
that "the whole purpose of the Human
Relations Agency is to help people."
Williams' talk was sponsored by the
Stanford Republican Club.
