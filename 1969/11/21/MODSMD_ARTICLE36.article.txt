# The
						Spectating Game: How To Play
## 
### ANNE EGGEBROTEN 
Stanford Regulation No. 41308 - Stanford dollies must attend
football games and appear to take an interest in the sport.
This code may seem unreasonable to some, but the experienced
Stanford woman knows that to win her man, she must endure many
athletic spectacles which have no inherent interest for her.
This regulation is not as stringent as it sounds, however. Stanford
University provides many diversions to render the four hours in the
stands more bearable, from half-time shows to flocks of seagulls hired
to gloat above the stadium amusing any dolly whose spirits may be
drooping. „ ,
The social use of the football game compensates lor many other
the other drawbacks. As the only large gathering of students, it gives
the coed an opportunity to parade her wardrobe and be seen with the
man of her choice.
The best way of making sure this is done is to arrive just as the
game is about to begin. Then, to find a seat you must walk in liont of
the whole crowd and up and down the major aisles. Eventually you
wave and yell to friends tightly entrenched in the midst of the rooting
section and make your way through the jammed bodies to the seats
"saved" for you. .... c a
This sort of grand entrance is not always possible since btantord
men like to arrive an hour early to get good seats, but with a little
careful planning can usually be managed.

Upon reaching the "saved seats" (actually scrounged up out of
space that never did exist) it is best to sit next to another girl, as well
as by your date. Thus you can exchange reports of who was seen with
whom and continue observation throughout the game.
The real danger is in sitting between two rabid football fans.
Should this happen, the dolly will not only lack conversation but be
plagued with questions such as, "Wow! Did you see that sweep?" and
"Did you follow the ball?"
Two Alternatives
This can be rather embarrassing as she stares perplexedly at the
piles of players strewn >n the field at the end of the play. Her
alternatives are: 1) to profess glibly to have seen and understood,
nodding knowingly; 2) to admit inattention and ignorance.
The first course earns admiration and builds rapport with her date,
but can be very dangerous—if she cheers at the wrong time, praises the
wrong player, or otherwise betrays her ignorance.
The second course is dangerous in that it reveals her lack of interest
in an event which for four hours absorbs the total mind and being of
her date.
However, should she earnestly and attentively listen to a full
explanation of the path of the ball, and strategy of play, she can
generally win back the sympathetic respect of her date. This works
especially well if she punctuates his explanation with awed "Oh's!"
and signs of admiration for his superior knowledge.
But there's one catch in the use of the "admitted ignorance"
approach. The lecture can end with solemn promises on her part to
pay better attention. These should be avoided at all costs.
Remember. Examine carefully the letter of the law. The dolly must
"appear to take an interest" in the football game, but no more.
Once this basic strategy is under control, she can relax and find
means to amuse herself. Stanford University offers a broad spectrum
of entertainment other than football at games.
Notable Diverstions
One major concession is the band, which presents a continuous
program of music from folk ballads to hard rock.
The chants and yells of the cheerleaders are a second reliable
diversion, continuing even when the attention of everyone else is most
closely focused on the field. Coeds will enjoy the excitement of
clapping and stomping along despite elbows in neighbors' ribs and
knees in another's back, the thrill of shooting up as one body to
cheer, and jamming back into the ten-inch wedge of bench space.
During the first half the excitement builds up until the half-time
festivities, which are the high point of the game. The Stanford Band
swarms onto the field, other bands march out, all the bottled
frustration of sitting there breaks loose as yellers and cheerleaders
cavort in the field—and the football players vanish.
Card stunts are the best part of the whole afternoon. After
impaling in the IBM instructions firmly on the collar button of the
boy in front of her, the coed arranges her cards and lets them fly as
the chanting numbers begin. The challenge is flipping all the colors at

the proper times while holding them just at eye level —and still
managing to squirm around and look backwards at the whole picture.
When the second-half begins, the coed's spirits may sink as she
looks around at all the intensely serious male faces frowning at the
field, eyes glued to the action. After watching the players scramble
about for a few minutes, making no progress, the dolly may despair.
However, Stanford provides an excellent Football Food Service
which cat revive her for a while. First she can watch her date try to
catch the attention of the Coke vendor.
Handoffs
Then comes the interesting spectacle of the coke and the dollar bill
both b< ing passed down the long row of hands, meeting each other in
the middle eventually reaching their opposite destinations.
After this, Uie change jingles from hand to hand down the line. It is
well worth a second show—she can ask for ice cream and see the
whole event repeated. And then peanuts. And a hot dog.
Should this little game lose its fun as the fourth quarter drags on,
the coed can study cloud formations or meditate on the
transcendental unity of all nature. It is for this purpose that the
Stanford administration has ringed the stadium with evergreen trees
and strategically placed hazy foothills in the distance. Every dolly
goes home with a sun tan, too.
At the end of the fourth quarter comes the one activity in which
both guys an dollies participate with genuine enthusiasm: the final
countdown. The men are anxiously waiting to be sure the other team
won't score on the last play; the dollies, just as anxious for the game
to be over at last. 5-4-3-2-1-0 —the cannon erupts and the fans
explode in cheers.
As the strains of the Alma Mater float away and a calm settles over
the crowd, a benediction is heard in the hearts of Stanford women.
"Now unto every good dolly be parties and dances, after-game
socials and Saturday night bashes, now and forevermore, so be it."
