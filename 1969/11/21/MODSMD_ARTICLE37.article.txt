# Balanced Attack
## Icemen Winneth 
### 
The Stanford Hockey club
turned in its best performance of
the season with an explosive 12
goal offensive attack to upset the
front running San Francisco
Senior Club 12-10 Tuesday night
at Belmont Iceland. The game was
played before the largest crowd of
the Stanford season.
The high scoring contest saw
the Indians continually taking
advantage of the visitors with
alert, well-organized ice play and
accurate shooting. Stanford's
three front lines had been
revamped in an attempt to snap a
five game losing streak.
Club president Bob Kadlec's
strategy of frequent substitution

paid off handsomely as all three
lines contributed to the scoring.
The Indians remained in charge of
the game throughout the final
third period as they increased
their 8-7 second period score to
the final 12-10 count.
The play of Pat Baldwin who
moved back to defense from his
previous wing position was
outstanding as he contributed
four goals to remain one of the
league's top scorers.
Winger Don Mitchell also
picked up a hat trick by scoring a
goal in every period. Doug Adams,
who along with Larry Crawford
and Baldwin formed the three
man defensive corps, scored in the
first period as the Indians built up
a 3-2 advantage.
Forwards Ed Leonard, Kadlec,
Hugh Tirrell and Paul Tittman
each penetrated the San Francisco
defense for well-deserved goals.
Tittman's marker gave the Cards
an invincible two goal lead with
less than five minutes to play.
Goal tender George Meredith came
up with 40 saves against the
visitors who recorded 26 stops.
The loss knocked San
Francisco out of undisputed
possession of first place and into a
tie with Belmont. Both have 4-2
records. Berkeley is now 3-3 in
league play while the Indians are 1
and 5.
Stanford will meet Belmont
this coming Tuesday night at 8:15
at the Belmont rink. Admission is
free.
