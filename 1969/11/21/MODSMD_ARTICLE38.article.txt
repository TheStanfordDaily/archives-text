# Cagers Lack Size, Depend On Speed

### DON TOLLEFSON 
This year's Stanford freshman
basketball team, under the
direction of new coach Bub
Bowling, will closely resemble the
teams of the last few years. It will
be a quick and aggressive team
with some good shooters and
well-run offense, but it will again
be a team without a big man.
To compensate for this,
Bowling intends to run a three

forward offense with each
forward shifting into the post in
certain situations.
At one of the forward
positions will be 6-4 Mark Hanson
from Minnesota. Hanson played
guard on the team which won the
state championship, but he is
being moved to a forward this
year. One of the other forwards
will be Pat Stevens, an aggressive
6-4 player from Notre Dame High
School in Sherman Oaks. Stevens
is the stockiest player on the club,
and he will be the key to the
Indian's rebounding game.
Currently holding down the
third forward position is Pat
Rusco from San Luis Obispo.
Rusco at 6-4 played at guard in
high school, but he like Hanson
has been moved to forward.
Bowling is hoping that Bob
Buell, a 6-5 forward from
undefeated Willow Glen High
School in San Jose, will be able to
come back from a knee injury so
that Rusco can move back to a
guard slot. Buell had a knee
operation seven months ago and
has only been working out for a
couple of weeks.
Other possibilities up front
include Truett Welch, Jeb
Johnson and Jay Hohf. Welch was
an honorable mention
All-American at San Ramon High
School in Danville and he is just
coming around after a long
summer layoff. Bowling says,
"Welch is becoming more
aggressive every day and when he
gets his touch back, he'll be
tough."
Jay Hohf at 6-7 is the biggest
man on the squad. He should also
see action when he overcomes his
inexperience with a running
offense. Johnson is from San
Carlos High School and he will
also see some action.
Leading the guards for the
Indians will be John Stratton
from Western High School in
Russianville, Indiana. The 6-3
Stratton was widely recruited and
Bowling is quite happy that
Stanford got him. Stratton is an
outstanding shooter and he will be
expected to lead the Indian
offense.
Currently holding down the
other guard position is Bruce
Menser, who averaged 16 ppg
playing for Helix High School in
La Mesa. Menser is a fine
ballhandler as well as a good
shooter.
Three other players who will
see a lot of action at guard are
Mike Boryla, Blake Baldwin and
Jay Inslee. Boryla was an all-state
guard at Regis High School in
Denver. He played frosh football
and has only been out for two
weeks.

6-4 player from Notre Dame High
School in Sherman Oaks. Stevens
is the stockiest player on the club,
and he will be the key to the
Indian's rebounding game.
Currently holding down the
third forward position is Pat
Rusco from San Luis Obispo.
Rusco at 6-4 played at guard in
high school, but he like Hanson
has been moved to forward.
Bowling is hoping that Bob
Buell, a 6-5 forward from
undefeated Willow Glen High
School in San Jose, will be able to
come back from a knee injury so
that Rusco can move back to a
guard slot. Buell had a knee
operation seven months ago and
has only been working out for a
couple of weeks.
Other possibilities up front
include Truett Welch, Jeb
Johnson and Jay Hohf. Welch was
an honorable mention
All-American at San Ramon High
School in Danville and he is just
coming around after a long
summer layoff. Bowling says,
"Welch is becoming more
aggressive every day and when he
gets his touch back, he'll be
tough."
Jay Hohf at 6-7 is the biggest
man on the squad. He should also
see action when he overcomes his
inexperience with a running
offense. Johnson is from San
Carlos High School and he will
also see some action.
Leading the guards for the
Indians will be John Stratton
from Western High School in
Russianville, Indiana. The 6-3
Stratton was widely recruited and
Bowling is quite happy that
Stanford got him. Stratton is an
outstanding shooter and he will be
expected to lead the Indian
offense.
Currently holding down the
other guard position is Bruce
Menser, who averaged 16 ppg
playing for Helix High School in
La Mesa. Menser is a fine
ballhandler as well as a good
shooter.
Three other players who will
see a lot of action at guard are
Mike Boryla, Blake Baldwin and
Jay Inslee. Boryla was an all-state
guard at Regis High School in
Denver. He played frosh football
and has only been out for two
weeks.
This year's Stanford freshman
basketball team, under the
direction of new coach Bub
Bowling, will closely resemble the
teams of the last few years. It will
be a quick and aggressive team
with some good shooters and
well-run offense, but it will again
be a team without a big man.
To compensate for this,
Bowling intends to run a three

forward offense with each
forward shifting into the post in
certain situations.
At one of the forward
positions will be 6-4 Mark Hanson
from Minnesota. Hanson played
guard on the team which won the
state championship, but he is
being moved to a forward this
year. One of the other forwards
will be Pat Stevens, an aggressive
6-4 player from Notre Dame High
School in Sherman Oaks. Stevens
is the stockiest player on the club,
and he will be the key to the
Indian's rebounding game.
