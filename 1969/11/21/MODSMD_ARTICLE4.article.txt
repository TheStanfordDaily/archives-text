# Students Meet Reagan; Finances Discussed
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
The three-year hate affair
between Governor Ronald Reagan
and California students took a
new turn yesterday as the
Governor and student leaders met
in an unprecedented session to
discuss tuition and student
involvement in the state's schools.
At the conclusion of the hour
and a half meeting at Los Angeles
International Airport, the
Governor announced his support
of student attempts to obtain
budgetary information for public
colleges and universities.
He also offered assistance in
obtaining twelve specific demands
issued at the closed-door session.
He further indicated that he
hoped to fulfill them by
December I, when he is scheduled
to meet with campus leaders again
in Sacramento.
Commending the students for
acting "in a responsible manner,"
Reagan told a news conference
after the meeting, "I think
students are in a unique position

to give us information—parti
cularly in budgetary matters- that
we haven't been able to get
before."
"I would like to see this
student input become a
permanent fixture," he told the
students. His optimism was
reflected by the students.
Revolutionary Tone
The whole tone of the meeting
represented truely
"revolutionary" in terms of state
government-student relations, said
Jim Gillette, black student body
president of Sonoma State.
"I came into this meeting
hating the Governor," admitted
another student. "Now at least I
can appreciate some of the things
he is saying."
Larry Labovitz, student body
president of San Fernando Valley
State and organizer of the
meeting, indicated he was "rather
surprised that the governor would
come." He added, "Students are
now in a put up or shut up
position. But then, so is the
governor."
Student Advisory Council
Key concerns discussed
included tuition and a request
that Reagan "accept some form of
student advisory council on an
informal basis to meet with him
regularly, without administrators
or faculty."
The Governor insisted that any
suggestions he has made to the
Regents are tied to the belief that
the state shouldn't deny
education to anyone who wants
it. These suggestions, for further

educational revenue, included
federal income tax deductions for
contributions to a student's
education, loans to cover
educational costs for qualified
students, and a learn-now-pay
later scheme whereby students
pay over their lifetime on the
actual percentage of benefit that
they received from their
educations.
He then called on students to
work up their own lists of
priorities to aid in establishing the
budget for next year.
Drawing laughter from the
crowd, he said that they might
well wipe out the generation gap
between them, because he too was
concerned that students seemed
to be the lowest priority in terms
of budgetary expenditures.
Students Versus Chancellor
Labovitz supported this, "The
chancellor's office sends in what it
believes are the most important
priorities. Many students don't
agree."
Gillete added that the
Governor appeared surprised to
learn that the "Educational
Opportunities Program is the
number one priority with students
across the state." Reagan claimed
that this was not this information
he had received from
administrators.
Such communications
problems set the tone for the
whole meeting. Noted Trudy
Grether, community relations
director for Sonoma State, "I had
never seen him talk to students
directly before:"

The Governor insisted that any
suggestions he has made to the
Regents are tied to the belief that
the state shouldn't deny
education to anyone who wants
it. These suggestions, for further

educational revenue, included
federal income tax deductions for
contributions to a student's
education, loans to cover
educational costs for qualified
students, and a learn-now-pay
later scheme whereby students
pay over their lifetime on the
actual percentage of benefit that
they received from their
educations.
He then called on students to
work up their own lists of
priorities to aid in establishing the
budget for next year.
Drawing laughter from the
crowd, he said that they might
well wipe out the generation gap
between them, because he too was
concerned that students seemed
to be the lowest priority in terms
of budgetary expenditures.
Students Versus Chancellor
Labovitz supported this, "The
chancellor's office sends in what it
believes are the most important
priorities. Many students don't
agree."
Gillete added that the
Governor appeared surprised to
learn that the "Educational
Opportunities Program is the
number one priority with students
across the state." Reagan claimed
that this was not this information
he had received from
administrators.
Such communications
problems set the tone for the
whole meeting. Noted Trudy
Grether, community relations
director for Sonoma State, "I had
never seen him talk to students
directly before:"
The three-year hate affair
between Governor Ronald Reagan
and California students took a
new turn yesterday as the
Governor and student leaders met
in an unprecedented session to
discuss tuition and student
involvement in the state's schools.
At the conclusion of the hour
and a half meeting at Los Angeles
International Airport, the
Governor announced his support
of student attempts to obtain
budgetary information for public
colleges and universities.
He also offered assistance in
obtaining twelve specific demands
issued at the closed-door session.
He further indicated that he
hoped to fulfill them by
December I, when he is scheduled
to meet with campus leaders again
in Sacramento.
Commending the students for
acting "in a responsible manner,"
Reagan told a news conference
after the meeting, "I think
students are in a unique position

to give us information—parti
cularly in budgetary matters- that
we haven't been able to get
before."
"I would like to see this
student input become a
permanent fixture," he told the
students. His optimism was
reflected by the students.
Revolutionary Tone
The whole tone of the meeting
represented truely
"revolutionary" in terms of state
government-student relations, said
Jim Gillette, black student body
president of Sonoma State.
"I came into this meeting
hating the Governor," admitted
another student. "Now at least I
can appreciate some of the things
he is saying."
Larry Labovitz, student body
president of San Fernando Valley
State and organizer of the
meeting, indicated he was "rather
surprised that the governor would
come." He added, "Students are
now in a put up or shut up
position. But then, so is the
governor."
Student Advisory Council
Key concerns discussed
included tuition and a request
that Reagan "accept some form of
student advisory council on an
informal basis to meet with him
regularly, without administrators
or faculty."

suggestions he has made to the
Regents are tied to the belief that
