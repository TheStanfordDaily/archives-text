# Bears Axe-ing For Trouble
## 
### FRED MANN 
The Stanford football season
which began in August with hopes
and dreams of a league
championship and the Rose Bowl,
ends tomorrow with a second
place finish the highest honor in
sight.
With what has been called the
greatest Indian team since the
1951 Rose Bowl edition, Coach
John Ralston has guided his
players to what is potentially the
winningest Stanford season of the
decade. A victory in tomorrow's
Big Game against California will
push the Tribe seasonal mark to
7-2-1.
If Stanford should win, which
the odds-makers feel is a sure
thing, and UCLA should lose the
really big game in Los Angeles,
both school would finish tied for
second place in the Pacific-8.
A crowd of up to 80,000 is
expected for the 1:30 p.m.
contest, and the home team
Indians rate a 14-point favorite.
It will be the 72nd meeting for
ihe two schools, and Stanford
leads in the Axe rivalry, 32-29-10.
Judging from all available
information, the Cards should
push their win streak in the Big
Game to two.
California has struggled all
season offensively, and on the
defensive side they are not as
Strong as they were last year when
Stanford tripped them, 20-0. In
the one spot where the Indians are
strongest, the quarterback
position, the Bears have had the
most problems.
Last year's so-so starter, Randy
Humphries ranks third on Cal's
all-time completions list, but has
been terribly ineffective this
season. The senior from Nevada
has been riding the bench since
early in the year, and it is
doubtful if he will see action in
Saturday's game. His up and down
career appears to be over.
