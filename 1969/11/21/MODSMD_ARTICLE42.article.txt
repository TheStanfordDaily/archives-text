# Jessup Leads Soccer Team
## 
### 
Chip Jessup scored both
Stanford goals Wednesday
afternoon to lead the Tribe to a
2-1 soccer victory over St. Mary's
at Moraga. •
Coach Fred Priddle said
Stanford's score would have been
much higher had the officiating
been consistent. "It was quite a
rough game," he added, but
"Stanford really dominated the
play at all times."
An excellent assist from Alan •
Houghton set up Hessup's second
rrid deciding goal. Linneas Lau
Stnd Mark Smith also earned praise
for their play.
I Today the Indian kickers take
n San Francisco State at 1:30
.m. in the city, and the Stanford
.raves (JV) will follow with a
ame at 3 p.m.
Although SFS's record is a
leager 2-8-1, the Gators have
lieen getting stronger, Priddle
leclares. A team they lost to 3-2

in a re-match a few days ago.

through the campaign when
transfer junior Steve Curtis took
over and led wins over Indians,
Rice, and Washington, but a
broken collarbone sidelined him.
Tomorrow, he will be making his
first appearance since that
Washington game.
The starting job will be
handled by Dave Penhall who
ranks only seventh in the Pac-8 in
passing, and is one of two league
quarterbacks who is not in the top
ten in total offense. Penhall has
however led the Bears to a near
upset of mighty USC three weeks
ago.
It is the film of the SC game
that the Stanford team has been
studying, and they are very aware
of Cal's potential effectiveness.
Fullback Gary Fowler has
gained 635 yards thus far, and
tailback Bob Darby has carried for
514, leading a solid rushing game.
The passing offense is not
particularly strong because of the
problem of finding the right
thrower.
The bulk of the scoring for Cal
has come on the ground, and from
the toe of place kicker Randy
Wershing who has booted 15

PAT's without a miss, and 13 of
19 field goal attempts.
It is the defense in which the
Bears take the most pride. Big
All-America candidate Irby
Agustine leads the unit which is
only a shadow of the powerful
group from last year. The pass
defense is ranked second in the
league, but they have proved
vulnerable when tested by good
passers.
Overall, Ed White and Wayne
Stewart are gone, and Cal has
been able to replace them either
on defense or offense.
After the San Jose State game,
Coach Ray Willsey complimented
the opposition. Of the team that
Stanford beat 63-21, Willsey said
"they are a very scrappy team.
They gave us all kinds of
problems."
If SJS can give Cal problems, it
is frightening to think what
Stanford will give them. Of course
anything can happen in the
unpredictable Big Game, but it
would have to be one of the
greatest upsets of the long series
for the Bears to pull it out this
time.
