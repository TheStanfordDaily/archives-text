and was founded by Kriyananda, a Western yogi who has published
books and records, and given many lectures.
The performance, "Spontaneous Meditative Expression Through
Yoga," is being presented by the Beta Chi Community for the
Performing Arts, and is a benefit for the Ananda commune.
It will take place 8:30 p.m. Monday at the Beta Chi Tent, 664 San
