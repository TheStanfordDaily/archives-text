# Teamsters Union To Organize Plant
## 
### 
The School, Clerical Allied and
Maintenence Employees Division
of Teamsters Local 856, a
newly-formed employee group,
met last night to plan a course of
action designed to bring another
major union onto the campus.
About twenty men, mostly from
the Physical Plant, attended the
meeting.
Rudy Tham, Secretary-
Treasurer of the San
Francisco-based group, said during
the meeting that the Teamsters
planned to establish immediately
"an office outside campus for the
purpose of bringing the campus
employees into the union when
we get a majority of these
employees signed up."
Keith Stothers, a steamfitter at
the plant, said that two-thirds of
the plant's employees had signed
up to hold an election for the
purpose of recognizing the
Teamsters Union as their
bargaining agent.

"Stanford employees are
receiving wages substandard to
those outside of the campus," said
Tham. "I think that they're in
need of a strong international
union like the Teamsters to
support them."
Employee resentment and
layoffs were the dominent themes
of the meeting. One gardener,
who is being laid off effective
today, told the university to "go
to hell. I'd never work here
again," he said.
Tham told the workers that
Stanford is "no different from
General Electric of U.S. Steel.
Stanford loves you people—they
love you all—because they're
buying your labor so cheaply."
Tham said that legal steps
would be taken to protect the
workers during the organizing
period.
The next meeting of the group
is scheduled for Dec. 4.
