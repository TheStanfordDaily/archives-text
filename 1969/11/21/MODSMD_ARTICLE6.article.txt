# Campus Froths Over Pigskin Pageant
## Campus RF's: Yuks Aplenty 
### APHINGOE T. McNAUGHT 
While the band is busy guarding the campus,
and various pranksters are plying their avocation,
other official organizations continue their work in
building Big Game Spirit.
This spirit will reach its climax tomorrow at
1:30 when the Indians meet the Golden Bears of
California. A crowd of over 80,000 is expected to
attend, with twenty thousand expected for the
bonfire at Lake Lag tonight. The rally and bonfire
start at 7:00 p.m.
The freshman class somehow always finds itself
building and guarding the bonfire on Lake
Lagunita. Taking their duties with the customary
gravity, the frosh have spent the past week
guarding the telephone poles which will frame the
70-foot tall flaming wonder.
What Would Spiro Say?
Despite extensive exhoration to the contrary,
the frosh are spending their guard-duty time
drinking brew. However, it is difficult to fault
them since no serious attempt to disrupt the
bonfire has occured in over 20 years.
The serious work for the frosh men and their
plastic cohorts will take place this morning as they
fill the frame with wood generously donated by
several conglomerates. If tradition is followed the
band will march through he dorms exhorting
freshman to expend their efforts in the traditional
style.
The members of the Axe Commission are again
successfully expending their creative energies to
make sure that the slogans "Beat Cal" and "Oski
Bites" are etched into the hearts and minds of the
community.
For instance, the Axe Comm has been busily
selling beads, stickers, and buttons. In a more

mundane vein they prepared a card show for half
time which promises to blow a few minds.
Some opposition pranksters thought they could
raid the shack where the cards are kept. Their
efforts were repulsed by diligent Axe Comm
members.
Rumor has it however that the Axe Comm's
card show will include a blue "C" which will
change into the famous expanding "S". This will
be followed by a clever slogan: "Inside we're all
the same—Red."
The Axe Comm members are also engaging in
some harmless pranks. For instance, the Cal bell
tower is again going to sing out the strains of
"Sons of the Stanford Red," and a number of
billboards in the City will find themselves coated
with Stanford emblems.
Tac Squad and Mayor Alioto
As one Axe Comm member said "This is war:
no one, in San Francisco, the Tac Squad and
Mayor Alioto included, can remain neutral. The
entire area must be mobilized."
However, whatever the efforts of the Axe
Command the freshman class are, the essence of
Big Game still resides in a 70 year old Axe.
Mounted as a trophy, this Axe remains a living
symbol, a respository of traditions dating back to
beginnings of the Stanford-California rivalry.
Malevolent Berkeley Students
The Axe, first brandished at a Stanford-Cal
baseball game, was stolen 10 days later by some
malevolent Berkeley students. For thirty years the
Axe remained across the Bay, displayed annually
at their Big Game rally, a symbol of their potency.
But on April 3, 1930, the Axe was recovered by
21 undergraduates, the so-called "Immortal 21."
In one of the most daring raids in collegiate
history, the 21, posing as newspaper
photographers, threw a homemade teargas bomb
into the crowd surrounding the Axe and grabbed
the treasured blade. For this feat, the 21 were
awarded varsity letters and permanent place in
Stanford history.
Since that time the Axe has been awarded to
the winner of the Big Game and now resides at
Stanford.

building Big Game Spirit.
This spirit will reach its climax tomorrow at
1:30 when the Indians meet the Golden Bears of
California. A crowd of over 80,000 is expected to
attend, with twenty thousand expected for the
bonfire at Lake Lag tonight. The rally and bonfire
start at 7:00 p.m.
The freshman class somehow always finds itself
building and guarding the bonfire on Lake
Lagunita. Taking their duties with the customary
gravity, the frosh have spent the past week
guarding the telephone poles which will frame the
70-foot tall flaming wonder.
What Would Spiro Say?
Despite extensive exhoration to the contrary,
the frosh are spending their guard-duty time
drinking brew. However, it is difficult to fault
them since no serious attempt to disrupt the
bonfire has occured in over 20 years.
The serious work for the frosh men and their
plastic cohorts will take place this morning as they
fill the frame with wood generously donated by
several conglomerates. If tradition is followed the
band will march through he dorms exhorting
freshman to expend their efforts in the traditional
style.
The members of the Axe Commission are again
successfully expending their creative energies to
make sure that the slogans "Beat Cal" and "Oski
Bites" are etched into the hearts and minds of the
community.
For instance, the Axe Comm has been busily
selling beads, stickers, and buttons. In a more

mundane vein they prepared a card show for half
time which promises to blow a few minds.
Some opposition pranksters thought they could
raid the shack where the cards are kept. Their
efforts were repulsed by diligent Axe Comm
members.
Rumor has it however that the Axe Comm's
card show will include a blue "C" which will
change into the famous expanding "S". This will
be followed by a clever slogan: "Inside we're all
the same—Red."
The Axe Comm members are also engaging in
some harmless pranks. For instance, the Cal bell
tower is again going to sing out the strains of
"Sons of the Stanford Red," and a number of
billboards in the City will find themselves coated
with Stanford emblems.
Tac Squad and Mayor Alioto
As one Axe Comm member said "This is war:
no one, in San Francisco, the Tac Squad and
Mayor Alioto included, can remain neutral. The
entire area must be mobilized."
However, whatever the efforts of the Axe
Command the freshman class are, the essence of
Big Game still resides in a 70 year old Axe.
Mounted as a trophy, this Axe remains a living
symbol, a respository of traditions dating back to
beginnings of the Stanford-California rivalry.
Malevolent Berkeley Students
The Axe, first brandished at a Stanford-Cal
baseball game, was stolen 10 days later by some
malevolent Berkeley students. For thirty years the
Axe remained across the Bay, displayed annually
at their Big Game rally, a symbol of their potency.
But on April 3, 1930, the Axe was recovered by
21 undergraduates, the so-called "Immortal 21."
In one of the most daring raids in collegiate
history, the 21, posing as newspaper
photographers, threw a homemade teargas bomb
into the crowd surrounding the Axe and grabbed
the treasured blade. For this feat, the 21 were
awarded varsity letters and permanent place in
Stanford history.
Since that time the Axe has been awarded to
the winner of the Big Game and now resides at
Stanford.

While the band is busy guarding the campus,
and various pranksters are plying their avocation,
other official organizations continue their work in
building Big Game Spirit.
