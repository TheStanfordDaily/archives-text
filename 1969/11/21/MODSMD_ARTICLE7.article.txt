# Electronic Arrests

### 
Intrigue and sabotage are
traditional elements of Big Game
week. As the game approaches,
bizarre occurances are reinforcing
the rumor that Stanford is
crushing Cal psychologically more
than it could ever hope to on the
the football field tomorrow.
The vast security net of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band pulled in 31 of a
reported 38 Cal students who
appeared on campus Thursday
morning at 1:00 a.m.
The Cal buffoons, busily
engaged in slogan painting at Flo
Mo, were persuaded to eradicate
their handiwork, by a large group
of Stanford students.
One potentially dangerous
prank was played on junior
Elizabeth Ann Rushton, who was
sprayed from head to foot with
yellow paint in Flo Mo. The paint
was removed at Cowell Health
Center, and the Cal "students"
have agreed to pay for the damage
to her clothes.
Band Marches
Marching to a steady drum
beat, the Band staged a moving
rally last night covering most of
the campus. Following stops in
Stern, Roble, and Lagunita Halls,
the troubadors marched on the
Undergraduate Library.
The band is the bulwark of the
campus security effort. Armed
with an elaborate and
sophisticated communications
system, including mobile citizen's
band radio transmitters, band

members have been scouting the
campus in search of suspicious
activity.
Cal mouseketeers had hoped to
employ a similar system, but
informed sources report that the
antenna connections of the Cal
base center have been
mysteriously cut, rendering all
communications impossible.
The same informed source
reported that a "considerable
number" of Cal band uniforms
were reported missing, lost, or
perhaps misplaced, despite the
fact that each uniform was in a
guarded locker. Several banners,
drum sticks, and other essentials
were also reported missing.
There has been remarkably
little retaliatory action. The band
shack, surrounded with magnetic
tape and burgular alarms to warn
of visitors, reported only one
incident of snooping Cal lackeys,
who were immediately escorted
off campus by the police.
Coughing Fit
The annual meeting between
Cal and Stanford officials to
discuss Big Game week was
marked by repeated charges by
Cal people of theft, aggression,
and general injustices done to
them. When faced with these
accusations, a Stanford dean
looked at Joe Welsh, head of Axe
Com, who glanced at the head of
Cardenal's Board, who peered at
the Stanford Band Manager,
Charlie Carrera, who reportedly
coughed.
