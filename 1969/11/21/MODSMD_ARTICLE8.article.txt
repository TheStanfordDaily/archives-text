# Big Game Time
## Oskie Bites 
### Buzz Thompson 
Listen boys and girls. Once a
year all Stanford students,
faculty, alumni, friends, ad
nauseum get together and work
for a common cause (surprising,
isn't it). That something is rhe
BIG game, and that something is
this weekend!
Now we know that you will all
come to the BIG game. No
Stanford student is that apathetic!
What this editorial is going to urge
though is that you reeealy get into
the mood, participate in all of the
BIG game activities,
pre-du ring &post. Why not?
They're all free!!
What activities you .now ask?
Well, since you want to know so
badly, I'll tell you.

Tonight there's the BIG
bonfire. For new students, that's
where Stanford people get
together for a BIG marshmallow
roast. The fire is lit at 8:00 (after
a 7:30 rally) assuming Cal (hiss)
doesn't get there first (heaven
forbid).
After the bonfire follow the
marching band and Stanford
Dollies and they will lead you to
the BIG bonfire dance, put on by
the Cardinal's Board. It will be on
the old road near the Post Office
and, listen to this, the BWAP will
be playing.
Saturday morning go and see
the Homecoming decorations.
Note: BIG game is also
Homecoming. There will be

plenty of BIG floats and crepe
paper, so come prepared to be
awed. The BIG floats will be
judged that morning too; the
winners to be announced at
half-time of the game.
After the game there'll be
zillions of parties; find one in
ONCE AROUND THE QUAD. If
you can't find one, arrange one
yourself. You have to celebrate
the BIG victory.
We ask your support. We ask
you to put aside "business as
usual" on November 21 and 22,
and to devote the day to burying
Cal. We ask you to be there or be
square.
Let's get to work. There isn't a
moment to lose.
