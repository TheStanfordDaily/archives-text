## The 						Undercover Agents 
### Art Buchwald 
It is generally known that the
FBI had many undercover agents
dressed as students and hippies
during last week's mobilization
march in Washington. What isn't
known is the difficulty the FBI
had in making their agents look
authentic.
On Friday morning 100 FBI
undercover men all wearing
war-surplus apparel, dungarees
and ponchos gathered in the
Justice Department courtyard to
be inspected by J. Edgar Hoover.
They were all lined up at
attention when Hoover arrived.
"Slouch, dammit!" Hoover
yelled at them. "You'll never pass
as protesters if you keep your
shoulders back and your stomachs
in."
Hoover stopped in front of one
agent. "Fitzpatrick, what are you
doing with your shoes shined?"
Department of Mud
"I always keep my shoes
shined. It's the first thing I
learned in FBI school."
"Well, dirty them up."
"How, sir?"
"Go to the Mud Department
and have them touched them up.
You show up once more with
shined shoes and it goes in your
record."
The FBI director continued
down the line. "McAlister, what
are you doing with an American
Flag in your buttonhole?"
"I want them to know where I
stand, sir."
"They're not supposed to
know where you stand. You're an
undercover agent. Now give me
the flag, and put on this peace
button."
"Do I have to, sir?"
Body Odors
"Give it to me and . . . wait a
minute, McAlister. Did you take a
bath this morning?"
"I took a shower, sir."
Hoover was enraged. "You had
specific orders not to bathe for
three days."
"That's all right for you to say,
sir, but I was beginning to have
body odor."

"That was the idea, McAlister.
You were supposed to have body
odor so you wouldn't be suspect."
"But, sir, cleanliness is next to
godliness."
"Very good, McAlister, but in
this case I want you to stink. Now
go in the gym and work out for
three hours in your clothes and
then let me see you."
Hoover said to his assistant,
"This is one of the worst
inspections I've ever attended."
"The men mean well, Mr.
Hoover."
Crewcuts to Sideburns
Hoover suddenly stopped in
front of an agent.
"Your hair!"
"What's the matter, sir? Isn't it
short enough?"
"You have a crew cut. Who
told you to have a crew cut?"
"I've always had a crew cut,
just as department regulations
require."
"Get this man a wig and
sideburns."
"Please, sir. Don't make me
wear sideburns. My mother would
never forgive me."
"Give him 10 demerits,"
Hoover said as he walked away.
He started up the second rank
and stopped in front of a man
who was wearing a trench coat.
"What are you doing in that
trench coat?" Hoover shouted.
"I don't want my dungarees to
get dirty, sir "
"Take off that trench coat and
start rolling in the yard until your
dungarees are filthy," Hoover
said.
Patriotism Banned
The next man Hoover stopped
in front of was carrying a football
banner which read "Love America
or Leave It." Hoover grabbed the
banner. "No, Holliston. No
patriotic banners."
Tears welled in Holliston's
eyes. "No one would have seen
it."
Hoover stomped out of the
courtyard and said to his assistant,
"This is too much. You inspect
the rest of them. I'm going to the
race track."
