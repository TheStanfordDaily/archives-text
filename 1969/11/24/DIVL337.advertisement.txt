You are invited to hear and meet Theodore Roszak, author of
the best-selling book, The Making of a Counter Culture. He
will speak on the topic of his book at The First Congregational
Church, Embarcadero and Louis Rd. in Palo Alto at 8 p.m.,
Wednesday, November 26th. The meeting is sponsored by
KEPLER'S BOOKS & MAGAZINES, The Midpeninsula Free Uni
versity, and The Institute for the Study of Nonviolence.
Mr. Roszak's book is in a second printing only a month
after publication. It has been the subject of a number of con
flicting reviews and is one of the most insightful analyses yet
of the Youth Revolution.
The meeting is open to the public and there is no charge.
