I Don't Buy
I Salesman's
when you buy stereo
Most stereo manufacturers maintain an ex
pensive corps of salesmen who travel from store
f| to store, pleading, "Please push our line."
Not Lafayette. We sell only through our own
'ft affiliated stores, which order by mail. No troupe
]v" of wholesale salesmen to pay.
That's one reason why Lafayette stereo re
ceivers—top-rated by BOTH leading consumer
rating organizations —can give you so much in
quality for so little in price.
For instance: our LR 1000TA AM/FM receiver,
120 watts power, 1.65 pv sensitivity, all the other
features you expect, for only $263.95. Or in a sys
tem complete with speakers and Garrard changer
for only $299.
See it—hear it this week!
