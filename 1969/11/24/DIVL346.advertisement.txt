The KLH Model Eleven-W

lri>
will fill your home
with music...
for a minimum investment
in dollars and valuable
living space.
The Eleven-W is a superb stereo phonograph system
that delivers a level of performance far out of proportion
to its moderate size and cost.
Everything needed for surprising sound is built into the
unobtrusive Eleven-W. There's powerful solid-state cir
cuitry, a custom-built Garrard record changer with a
Pickering magnetic cartridge and diamond stylus, and a
pair of KLH's remarkable miniature full-range speakers.
Beautifully housed in three small oiled-walnut cabinets.
With jacks for plugging in a tape recorder or radio.
If you'd like to take this kind of performance with you,
just drop the "W" and look at the Model Eleven—the same
system in a handsome vinyl luggage case, ready to travel
wherever there's an AC outlet.
Come see and hear how to get a maximum of music
from a minimum of visible equipment.
