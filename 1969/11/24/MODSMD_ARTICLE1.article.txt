# Protestor Jailed For Misdemeanors
## 
### 
Steve Kessler, a participant in
last spring's anti-war
demonstrations against the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
was found guilty Thursday of
three misdemeanors.
The decision by a six-man,
six-woman jury, netted Kessler, an
unemployed gardener and draft
resistance organizer, three
concurrent terms of 20 days in
the Santa Clara County Jail and a
$302 fine.
Visiting Judge Wilfred J.
Harpham from Lake County
sentenced Kessler at 2 p.m. Friday
and gave the defendant a
suspended two-year jail term
under the following four
conditions:
He must obey all state laws and
the laws of the country in which
he resides; find gainful
employment or go to school; pay
the fine; and serve the
unsuspended 20-day jail sentence
out of the 1 20 days he was given.
Appeal Pending
About a dozen of the 100
demonstrators arrested in the
anti-war activities May 16 and 19
against SRI have been found
guilty of various misdemeanor
charges. Some of these have
drawn jail terms.
Kessler's attorney, public
defender Leonard Edwards,
indicated that he would appeal
the convictions. To allow time to
file the necessary papers, Judge
Harpham granted a 30-day stay of
execution of the sentence.
The jury found Kessler guilty
of rioting, unlawful assembly and
trespass charges. They were
unable to reach a verdict on two
other charges of obstructing free
passage and disturbing the peace.
Prosecutor Craig Brown thus
far has declined to state whether
he intends to drop these charges

against Kessler. The jurors voted
ten to two for conviction.
International Law
In court Friday Kessler said tha
he felt his actions at the
demonstrations were justified
under "international law." He
told the court that the war
research activities at SRI violated
these laws and were illegal and
immoral.
Kessler added that his mind
would not be changed,
punishment notwithstanding.
The county probation officer
had recommended only fine and
probation penalties.
Today jury selection gets under
way for the group trial of Mike
Vawter, his wife Jan, and
Stanford student John Shoch.
The three defendants are
charged with roughing up "Palo
Alto Times" photographer Gene
Tupper and taking his film during
the May 16 demonstration.
That paper refers to the trio as
the "Tupper Group."
The "Chaparral" announced in
a second page advertisement
Friday that students are
"cordially invited" to Shoch's
trial.
