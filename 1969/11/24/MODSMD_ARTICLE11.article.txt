# Dear Miss Mihaly:
## More On ARAB Propaganda 
### Joshua Ronen 
(This is the last in a series of
columns by Joshua Ronen, Ph.D.
candidate in business
administration, in response to an
article by Patricia Mihaly.)
The creation of Israel, which
Karl Deutsch, professor of
political science at Yale compares
(as quoted in TIME) to an act of
"eminent domain," carried out by
the world community, qualifies as
a better term than the one which
Miss Mihaly chose to describe
Israel—a country club. Zionism,
labeled by Miss Mihaly as "an
ideology of exclusivism" is an area
in which Miss Mihaly displays as
little knowledge as in the concept
of nationhood.
To say, as Miss Mihaly asserts,
that "Arabs are not trying to
fight Jews, but they are fighting an
exclusivism (Zionism) which was
imposed on the land that in the
1920's was 90 percent theirs," is
simply absurd. Relevant to this
point is the reaction of the
Zionists to the position of the
British Labor Party in December
1 944, when the national
conference of the Party endorsed
the statement of its executive that
"the Arabs be encouraged to
move out as the Jews move in. Let
them be compensated handsomely
for their land and let their
settlement elsewhere be carefully
organized and generously
financed." The Zionists were
shocked by this proposal and
declared that it was incompatible
with their aims, which never
involved the emigration of the
Arabs.
Truth About Arabs
Let me now address myself to
Miss Mihaly's account of the
treatment of Arabs in Israel as
supposedly that of "associate
members (second-class citizens)
with only limited privileges."
Whether this account derives from
ignorance or distortion of the
facts, it is irresponsibly

inflammatory. Israel's democratic
regime ensures equality before the
law for all, without distinction of
race, religion or language, and
affords her Arab citizens every
opportunity to maintain their
own culture and traditions. Large
sums and much effort have been
devoted by the Government to
enhancing their prosperity and
providing them with public
services on the national level.
Before and during the Six-Day
War, the overwhelming majority
of Israel's Arabs openly identified
themselves with the defense of her
liberty and sovereignty. They
volunteered to help in the war
effort as blood-donors, by
replacing farm-labourers called up
to fight, and in other ways. Arabs
and Druze play an active part in
political life, and their interests
are effectively represented in the
legislature. There are seven in the
Sixth Knesset: three Moslems,
three Christians and one Druze.
Over 85 percent of Arab electors
voted in the 1965 elections (at the
date of writing this article the
preliminary statistics show that a
percentage of at least this
magnitude, including East
Jerusalem Arabs, voted in this
Tuesday's elections). It may be
illuminating to quote a recent
visitor's account of his
experiences in Israel, published as
a letter to the Editor in the
TIMES of London on August, 25,
1969:
"On a recent visit to Israel, I
visited among other places the
Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem.
While I was there, I was informed
that, among their patients, they
had some prisoners from the
Al-Fatah who had been wounded
and captured while carrying out
terrorist activities. I was allowed
to visit these men and to speak to
them quite freely. In fact, the
guards and other Israelis left the
room so that we were able to talk

without interference. The Arab
prisoners spoke English quite well
and expressed the greatest
appreciation of the treatment that
they were receiving at the hands
of the Israelis. It was quite
apparent that they were, in fact,
getting the finest medical
attention and the same food and
comforts as other patients in the
hospital."
What is, on the other hand, the
situation of Jews in Arab
countries? Miss Mihaly quite
conveniently forgets this aspect
altogether. Let me give you some
facts, Miss Mihaly, or else, refresh
your memory. Notwithstanding
some periods of comparative
calm, Jews in the Arab lands have
been subject to persecution
throughout history. With the rise
of modern Arab nationalism, Jews

have become increasingly exposed
to official denial of basic rights,
confiscation of property and
frequent imprisonment. Physical
violence has also been part of
Jewish fate at the hands of their
Arab hosts.
By 1 960, the Jewish
communities of Iraq, Egypt,
Syria, Libya and Yemen were all
but totally eliminated, the Jews
being compelled to leave behind
all their possessions. With the
outbreak of the Six-Day War in
June 1967, a number of Arab
Governments ordered the arrest of
Jews, the confiscation of their
property, the rescinding of
whatever civil rights they still
enjoyed, and turned a blind eye
on the mob attacks to which they
were subjected. This state of
affairs hardly fits the description

of citizens who enjoy equal rights.
Finally, Miss Mihaly proposes
to "eliminate Zionism" as a
solution to the Middle East
conflict. This, she asserts, "does
not mean that Jews will be driven
into the sea, but only that
Zionism will." Miss Mihaly is
shrewd enough to realize that
destroying Zionism is more
palatable than killing Jews, when
propagandizing among civilized
audiences. It only so happens,
Miss Mihaly, that almost the
entire population of Israel
whole-heartedly identifies with
the idea of Zionism and of Israel
as a Jewish State. I take it, then,
that your solution means
throwing the entire Israeli
population into the sea—as Arab
leaders have been more frank in
admitting.
