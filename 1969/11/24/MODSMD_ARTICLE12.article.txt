Shockingly Shockley
Editor, THE DAILY:
Nobel Laureate, Dr. William
Shockley, calls for research into
genetic differences between the
races yet at the same time he
makes a statement which
demonstrates why such a study
would be worthless.
According to Dr. Shockley,
"my statistical studies show that
American Negroes . . . are about
50% more successful per capita
(than whites) in winning Olympic
medals." This is quite an
achievement for a race which even
deep into the current century
were known to be physically

inferior to whites. (This myth still
exists to a certain degree. Prior to
the 1968 Olympics I recall a
sports commentator explaining
that blacks would never make
good long-distance runners
because their lungs were not
suited for it. It seems the Kenyans
didn't know this.)
At the turn of the century, a
study of physical characteristics
of the races would doubtless have
verified the existing prejudices
because no tests would have been
able to separate genetic effects
from results of environment.
Today, the same situation exists
with intelligence measurements.

Rather than a program of mass
testing, we need a program to
assure that all Americans (and
better, all citizens of the world)
will receive the best available
education, food, living conditions,
etc. After a few generations of
this, such a study as Dr. Shockley
proposes might be in order. More
likely, such a study would be
superfluous. The answers would
be obvious just as they are today
in the field of physical
capabilities.

In the November 17 Daily,
Professor David M. Kennedy
represents my letter in the
November 11 Daily as repudiating
the Constitution and "viciously"
threatening the Bill of Rights.
Ignoring for the moment the
personal, indeed libelous, nature
of his remarks, I categorically
reject all of the implications
which he tries to read into my
statements. The manner in which
faulty premise leads to incorrect
conclusion in the November 17
letter will be apparent to anyone
who reads the November 11 letter
objectively.
I find more disturbing than his
mere personal fulminations
against me, my colleagues feeling
that there is "radically
anti-democratic logic INHERENT
in technological thinking" whose
influence "we must passionately
resist." This polarizing passion—l
would hesitate to call it logic—is
discouraging to those of us who
would like to see the "two
cultures" (in the sense of C.P.
Snow) united. Perhaps my
colleague would be willing to
address the engineering faculty
and explain to them with passion
of course—the error inherent in
their technological ways.

because their lungs were not
suited for it. It seems the Kenyans
didn't know this.)
At the turn of the century, a
study of physical characteristics
of the races would doubtless have
verified the existing prejudices
because no tests would have been
able to separate genetic effects
from results of environment.
Today, the same situation exists
with intelligence measurements.

Rather than a program of mass
testing, we need a program to
assure that all Americans (and
better, all citizens of the world)
will receive the best available
education, food, living conditions,
etc. After a few generations of
this, such a study as Dr. Shockley
proposes might be in order. More
likely, such a study would be
superfluous. The answers would
be obvious just as they are today
in the field of physical
capabilities.

In the November 17 Daily,
Professor David M. Kennedy
represents my letter in the
November 11 Daily as repudiating
the Constitution and "viciously"
threatening the Bill of Rights.
Ignoring for the moment the
personal, indeed libelous, nature
of his remarks, I categorically
reject all of the implications
which he tries to read into my
statements. The manner in which
faulty premise leads to incorrect
conclusion in the November 17
letter will be apparent to anyone
who reads the November 11 letter
objectively.
I find more disturbing than his
mere personal fulminations
against me, my colleagues feeling
that there is "radically
anti-democratic logic INHERENT
in technological thinking" whose
influence "we must passionately
resist." This polarizing passion—l
would hesitate to call it logic—is
discouraging to those of us who
would like to see the "two
cultures" (in the sense of C.P.
Snow) united. Perhaps my
colleague would be willing to
address the engineering faculty
and explain to them with passion
of course—the error inherent in
their technological ways.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Nobel Laureate, Dr. William
Shockley, calls for research into
genetic differences between the
races yet at the same time he
makes a statement which
demonstrates why such a study
would be worthless.
According to Dr. Shockley,
"my statistical studies show that
American Negroes . . . are about
50% more successful per capita
(than whites) in winning Olympic
medals." This is quite an
achievement for a race which even
deep into the current century
were known to be physically

inferior to whites. (This myth still
exists to a certain degree. Prior to
the 1968 Olympics I recall a
sports commentator explaining
that blacks would never make
good long-distance runners
because their lungs were not
suited for it. It seems the Kenyans
didn't know this.)
