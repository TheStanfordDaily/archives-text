# The 						Silent Church
## Loyalty In Germany 
### Miriam Cherry 
During these days when The
Silent Majority is gravely urged to
loyally back U.S. oppression at
home and abroad, it films a
flashback of the Nazi scene. In
Germany Christians who were also
trapped into believing that law
and order would preserve their
security, let authorities decide
what was best for the country.
Why question those who have
supposedly built up the economy?
Extermination of Jews was
patriotically acceptable or was
somehow rationalized as, "There
is no genocide in our country."
(While living in Germany in '52
and '53, I talked with a professor
of a university who was totally
unaware until the end of World
War II that Jews had been burned
in ovens in the relatively near
camp of Dachau.)
Even church leaders like
Bishop Ludwig Mueller and Dr.
Martin Niemoeller initially
welcomed Nazi rule. These two
top church authorities, however,
went their separate ways. Mueller
implemented Nazi doctrines into
the Reich Church while
Niemoeller's gradual
disenchantment of the Reich led
him to mobilize a resistance group
against Hitler's plan to control
religious action. Dr. Niemoeller's
protests paved his path to prison.
Shortly after his arrest,
Niemoeller preached his last
sermon in the Third Reich, "We
have no more thought of using
our own powers to escape the arm
of the authorities than the
Apostles of old. No more are we
ready to keep silent at man's
behest when God commands us to
speak." Like Niemoller, his close
friend Pastor Dietrich Bonhoffer
refused to be intimidated by the
Administration, but unlike
Niemoeller, he was martyred in a

German concentration camp.
Despite the courage of these
leaders, in addition to those nuns
and priests arrested under fascistic
persecution, the masses of
Christians, consciously or
unconsciously, formed the leaven
for State corruption by their
timidity to denounce government
control of minds and bodies.
Let's turn to this country. It
ought to be honestly probed as to
whether government pressures
affect religious action in the
United States. How many priests
and nuns, for example, avoided a
Moratorium rally becuse they
equate Nixon's plea with the
"voice of authority," honoring
the government's message that
American troops are stopping the
evil forces of communism in
Vietnam? Do you hear that
several religious leaders publicly
condemn the police power and
brutality directed against Blacks,
Chicanos, and students? One
reason offered by church leaders
to both of those questions is that
such topics are too political, not
of the nature to mention in
consecrated places, believing, too,
that law and order must prevail
everywhere.
Another Question
What about social injustices
which are heaped on minority
groups or poor whites through the
courts .. . are there wide-spread
messages in churches pleading for
constitutional rights and humane
treatment, like in the Bobby Seale
trial? Some church people feel
that such a search of justice and
hard truth would make
congregations uptight causing
members to walk out.
Furthermore, how do
Christians interpret the "U.S.
Secret Service Guidelines"
reported in the S.F.
CHRONICLE, Saturday Nov. 1,
1969, in relation to free speech?
Freely translated, according to a
Gestapo code, they would read:
thou shalt not "embarrass" high
officials of the government; thou
shalt not make "abusive"
statements about government
officials or participate in
"anti-American demonstrations"
unless thou wishest to have
information added to thine F. 8.1,
file.
Gestapo-tainted inspections
have been inflicted on a "man of
the cloth," Father Eugene Boyle,
a white man. He has permitted the
Black Panthers use of Sacred
Heart Church in San Francisco for
breakfasts to non-whites and
whites. He and Ray "MASAI"
Hewitt, Minister of Education of
the Black Panther Party, will be at
Stanford tomorrow to talk about
the Breakfast Program and why it
is a threat to fascistic control.
(Tuesday, November 25,
Tresidder large lounge, 8 p.m.)
Not only have strategies been
devised to end the Panther
programs of feeding the hungry,
healig the sick, and liberating the
oppressed, but there is clearly a
plot to eliminate the Panthers.
Vast insensitivity to the struggles
of the Panther Party, condoned
by stereotyping them as angry,
violent criminals, dismisses the
reality that if they're wiped
out .. . who will be next?
Hopefully, there will be a
dynamic change among believers
in the silent Church, so-often the
submissive handmaiden of State
suppression, to one of
compassionate action for all the
people.
