## ASSU Senate -- BSU And FCM 
### Jim Schnieder 
The ARENA'S condemnation
of the ASSU Senate is reflective
of the style which has endeared
our other journals of student
opinion to us. But, however
repugnant the thrust of the
attack, it should be noted that,
with few exceptions, the article
was factually correct. Moreover,
from an FCM perspective, the
ARENA'S case can be seen as
having some shred of validity. But
it takes more than a few factlets
and a predisposed pen to
accurately portray the Student
Senate.
The controversy which has
arisen has done much to polarize
two factions within the
community; specifically the BSU
and the FCM. Because of the
emotional tenor of the continuing
debate, perhaps a somewhat less
passionate analysis might be in
order?
The ARENA'S major
contention that the Senate is
unrepresentative raises two
questions:
1. Does the voter select the
cadidate that best fits the voter's
stereotype, or does he cast his
ballot on the basis of ideology,
personality, and qualification?
2. Why did the FCM actively
discourage its membership from
running for office, thereby
partially excluding its minority
views from being directly
represented in the Senate?
The first question is answered
by the fact that the Student Body

saw fit to draw 1 /sth of the Senate
from the BSU. The second
question can best be answered by
the FCM.
Limited Circulation
Of course it can be argued that
the BSU extorted their Senate
seats. At one point in their
campaign, this may have been
their intent. It is true that the
BSU released an intimidating piece
of literature during the campign.
But it received a limited
circulation, while the rest of its
more positive material received a
much wider distributionâ€”if
anything, the "ballot or. . ." piece
lost it votes.
The charge that, under the
leadership of a radical black
Chairman, the Senate is just a
"rubber stamp" for a black-radical
alliance, can be ansered in two
ways. First, when there is
adaquate attendance, the
b 1 a c k - r a d i c a 1 alliance is
outnumbered on partisan issues.
This is substantiated by a recent
vote to support President Pitzer's
decisipn not to cancel classes
during the Moratorium. As for the
Chairman, it is understandable
that those who opposed the
activity of the A3M would
challenge the wisdom of electing
David Edwards to that position. I
too fear that a time may come
when he might use his position to
his political advantage. But that
time has not yet come. His
appointments have been fair, he
has been unbiased in the

execution of his duties, and above
all, he has proven himself to be
eminently competent.
The BSU's response to the
ARENA'S charges are certainly
worthy of note. One would not
expect the BSU to dance in the
streets with joy when an opposing
view is expressed. Nor would on
expect it to be so paranoid as to
threaten the ARENA'S right of

free expression. What one might
have expected is that the BSU
would have developed a more
creative counter-attack than
merely bestowing the ARENA
with the battle-weary smear,
"racist."
As for the disposition of this
controversy, is it too much to ask
that future debate should seek
resolution of issued rather than
catharsis?
