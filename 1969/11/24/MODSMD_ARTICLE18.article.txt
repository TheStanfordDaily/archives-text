# Compromises
## A 						Parable 
### Richard Bube 
PARABLE
One day while I was walking
down the street, I came across
two men who were fighting each
other, kicking, gouging and
cursing. The one was fat and the
other was thin. I called out,
"What's going on there?" The fat
man answered, "This rascal of a
brother works for me, but now
he's trying to steal from me what
is mine!" But the thin one called
out, "He's a liar! He's been
stealing from me by not paying
me what I'm worth. I'm just
trying to get what I've rightfully
earned."
ENDING 1
I abhor violence, so I ran
away.
ENDING 2
I really didn't want to get
involved, and as I was afraid, I ran
away. . â€”
ENDING 3
I called back, "Hold on, fat
man. The law is clearly on your
side. I will come and help you."
So I jumped into the fight,
kicking, gouging and cursing until
we had beaten up the thin man.
"Thanks," said the fat man, "that
will teach these good-for-nothing

rascals not to ask for more than
they're worth."
ENDING 4
I called back, "Hold on, thin
man. Your case is clearly morally
right. I will come and help you."
So I jumped into the fight,
kicking, gouging and cursing until
we had beaten up the fat man.
"Thanks," said the tb ian,
"that will teac' ese
good-for-nothing bosse /hat
is theirs is really ours.''
ENDING 5
I rushed into the fight, kicking,
gouging and cursing at both men.
They turned on me and said,
"Who called you into this?"
Whereupon they both beat me up
until I ran away.
ENDING 6
I called out, "Stop that
fighting or I'll call the police."
They just kept right on fighting,
so I went for the police. When
they came they stopped the men
from fighting, kicking, gouging
and cursing at one another.
"0.K.," I said, "now let's get this
thing straightened out." The fat
man agreed to pay the thin man
more, and to give him a share of
, the earnings. The thin man agreed
to work his best and not steal
from his boss. I rejoiced in having
brought about a good
compromise. I wondered why no
one had ever thought of it before.
