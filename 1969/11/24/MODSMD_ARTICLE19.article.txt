# Re-Reassessments
## What Is Nationalism? 
### Ivo Banac 
(This is the first in a series of two
articles by Ivo Banac, graduate
student in History and member of
the SDS Worker-Student Alliance
Caucus, written in response to an
article by T. H. Andre.)
As the panelist who defended
the Progressive Labor Party's
positions at the SDS-sponsored
meeting on the U.S. radical
movement, I read with deep
interest Mr. T. H. Andre's
reassessment of "our" thesis that
"all nationalism is reactionary."
In replying to Mr. Andre I
would, first of all, like to point
out that this position is not a
property of the PLP, nor has it
been invented by the PLP.
Marxist—Leninists have always
advanced this thesis. The fact that
this claim is now so widely
challenged among our
"revolutionaries" merely shows
the tremendous strength of
revisionism within the movement
here and abroad.
Lenin has said, "The whole
task of the proletarians in the

national question is 'impractical'
from the standpoint of the
nationalist bourgeoisie of every
nation, because, being opposed to
all nationalism [my emphasis,
1.8.], the proletarians demand
'abstract' equality, they demand
that on principle there shall be no
privileges, however slight."
Stalin has said, "Sometimes the
bourgeoisie succeeds in drawing
the proletariat into the national
movement, and then the national
struggle externally assumes a
'nation-wide' character. But this is
so only externally. In its essence it
is always a bourgeois struggle, one
that is to the advantage and profit
„ mainly of the bourgeoisie."
Nationalist Movements
What is fundamental in Mr.
Andre's article is his assumption
that "certain contemporary
nationalist movements are
progressive, in the present
historical conditions."
What is nationalism? Is it an
ideology which stands above
classes? Does it contradict Mao
Tsetung's profoundly Marxist

observation that in a class society
"every kind of thinking, without
exception, is stamped with the
brand of a class?" Of course not!
Nationalism is a bourgeois
ideology which came into
existence in the era of bourgeois
revolutions, at the time when the
bourgeoisie was a progressive class
fighting against feudalism.
Nationalism holds that
members of a national group,
regardless of class have, as Mr.
Andre so well puts it, "a
communal integrity" that is
stronger than the ties between
workers of different nations.
Two-Stage Struggle
Although Mr. Andre never
states that he is defending
nationalism in light of the
so-called "two-stage stuggle," i.e.
that the struggle for national
liberation is subsequently
transformed into a socialist
revolution, we are to presume that
he has the interests of socialism
(dictatorship of the proletariat) at
heart when he defends the
nationalism of (among others) the
Vietnamese leadership.
Recent experience in Algeria,
Indonesia as well as in Vietnam
have shown that national
liberation movements that do not
openly proclaim socialism as a
goal have not and indeed cannot
lead to the liberation of the
peoples struggling against
imperialism.
It is not an accident that more
clever imperialists such as
McCarthy and Kennedy (who are
now organizing honest [and some
not so honest] people behind
their "Moratorium" fraud) have
long since realized that
nationalism is not a threat to U.S.
interests. The U.S. Government
has managed to "co-exist" very
"peacefully" with "national
communists" and revisionists of
all stripes, whose socialist phrases
mask naked natioanlism.
Sonorous Title
"Socialists" who never tire of
referring to the late Ho Chi Minh
as "George Washington of
Vietnam" ought to examine the
essence of this sonorous title. It
implies that no basic
contradictions ought to exist
between Vietnamese nationalism
and U.S. imperialism. If this is
what they mean, they they are
quite right. This is precisely what
the revisionist program of the
Provisional "Revolutionary"
Government of Vietnam envisions
in its article No. 12, where its
authors state their intention "to
accept aid, with no political
conditions attached [! j, from any
country . ..[which of course
includes the U.S. ].
The U.S. Government, on its
part, is already drawing up plans
for economic "co-operation" with
Vietnam after the termination of
hostilities. In this respect U.S.
imperialism is much more
sophisticated than the apologists
for "revolutionary" nationalism.
Proletariat Dictatorship
It sees clearly that as long as
the dictatorship of the proletariat
is not the order of the day (and it
isn't: check the same PRG or NLF
programs' for any reference to
socialism or produce any
independent socialist program
from the southern section of the
Vietnamese Lao Dong [Workers]
Party) the essence of the current
struggle in Vietnam is an attempt
of one group of would-be-capital
ists to fight outside capitalists for
profits. The problem is that Mr.
Andre, as well as so many others,
has not learned much from the
tragedy of revisionism and
capitalist restoration in the USSR
and eleven other former socialist
countries.
This reversal has been
conveniently accomplished under
the guise of "updating" socialism.
No one should be deceived by this
stratagem. We must carefully
distinguish between what
revisionists say and what
revisionists do. I challenge Mr.
Andre to show me one nationalist
who built socialism.
Similarly, I challenge Mr.
Andre to show me one Marxist
reference which proclaims the
nationalism of the oppressor
nation as reactionary and the
nationalism of the oppressed
nation as progressive. [Citing Mr.
Bruce Franklin will not do. Mr.
Franklin might be an authority on
science fiction, but he is no
Marxist. Marxists, you see, believe
in classes.] Marxist-Leninists
distinguish between oppressor and
oppressed nations for the purpose
of breaking down chauvinism
which hinders the unity of all
workers, and not in order to raise
the possibility that some
nationalism is better than other.

so only externally. In its essence it
is always a bourgeois struggle, one
that is to the advantage and profit
„ mainly of the bourgeoisie."
Nationalist Movements
What is fundamental in Mr.
Andre's article is his assumption
that "certain contemporary
nationalist movements are
progressive, in the present
historical conditions."
What is nationalism? Is it an
ideology which stands above
classes? Does it contradict Mao
Tsetung's profoundly Marxist

observation that in a class society
"every kind of thinking, without
exception, is stamped with the
brand of a class?" Of course not!
Nationalism is a bourgeois
ideology which came into
existence in the era of bourgeois
revolutions, at the time when the
bourgeoisie was a progressive class
fighting against feudalism.
Nationalism holds that
members of a national group,
regardless of class have, as Mr.
Andre so well puts it, "a
communal integrity" that is
stronger than the ties between
workers of different nations.
Two-Stage Struggle
Although Mr. Andre never
states that he is defending
nationalism in light of the
so-called "two-stage stuggle," i.e.
that the struggle for national
liberation is subsequently
transformed into a socialist
revolution, we are to presume that
he has the interests of socialism
(dictatorship of the proletariat) at
heart when he defends the
nationalism of (among others) the
Vietnamese leadership.
Recent experience in Algeria,
Indonesia as well as in Vietnam
have shown that national
liberation movements that do not
openly proclaim socialism as a
goal have not and indeed cannot
lead to the liberation of the
peoples struggling against
imperialism.
It is not an accident that more
clever imperialists such as
McCarthy and Kennedy (who are
now organizing honest [and some
not so honest] people behind
their "Moratorium" fraud) have
long since realized that
nationalism is not a threat to U.S.
interests. The U.S. Government
has managed to "co-exist" very
"peacefully" with "national
communists" and revisionists of
all stripes, whose socialist phrases
mask naked natioanlism.
Sonorous Title
"Socialists" who never tire of
referring to the late Ho Chi Minh
as "George Washington of
Vietnam" ought to examine the
essence of this sonorous title. It
implies that no basic
contradictions ought to exist
between Vietnamese nationalism
and U.S. imperialism. If this is
what they mean, they they are
quite right. This is precisely what
the revisionist program of the
Provisional "Revolutionary"
Government of Vietnam envisions
in its article No. 12, where its
authors state their intention "to
accept aid, with no political
conditions attached [! j, from any
country . ..[which of course
includes the U.S. ].
The U.S. Government, on its
part, is already drawing up plans
for economic "co-operation" with
Vietnam after the termination of
hostilities. In this respect U.S.
imperialism is much more
sophisticated than the apologists
for "revolutionary" nationalism.
Proletariat Dictatorship
It sees clearly that as long as
the dictatorship of the proletariat
is not the order of the day (and it
isn't: check the same PRG or NLF
programs' for any reference to
socialism or produce any
independent socialist program
from the southern section of the
Vietnamese Lao Dong [Workers]
Party) the essence of the current
struggle in Vietnam is an attempt
of one group of would-be-capital
ists to fight outside capitalists for
profits. The problem is that Mr.
Andre, as well as so many others,
has not learned much from the
tragedy of revisionism and
capitalist restoration in the USSR
and eleven other former socialist
countries.
This reversal has been
conveniently accomplished under
the guise of "updating" socialism.
No one should be deceived by this
stratagem. We must carefully
distinguish between what
revisionists say and what
revisionists do. I challenge Mr.
Andre to show me one nationalist
who built socialism.
Similarly, I challenge Mr.
Andre to show me one Marxist
reference which proclaims the
nationalism of the oppressor
nation as reactionary and the
nationalism of the oppressed
nation as progressive. [Citing Mr.
Bruce Franklin will not do. Mr.
Franklin might be an authority on
science fiction, but he is no
Marxist. Marxists, you see, believe
in classes.] Marxist-Leninists
distinguish between oppressor and
oppressed nations for the purpose
of breaking down chauvinism
which hinders the unity of all
workers, and not in order to raise
the possibility that some
nationalism is better than other.

As the panelist who defended
the Progressive Labor Party's
positions at the SDS-sponsored
meeting on the U.S. radical
movement, I read with deep
interest Mr. T. H. Andre's
reassessment of "our" thesis that
"all nationalism is reactionary."
In replying to Mr. Andre I
would, first of all, like to point
out that this position is not a
property of the PLP, nor has it
been invented by the PLP.
Marxist—Leninists have always
advanced this thesis. The fact that
this claim is now so widely
challenged among our
"revolutionaries" merely shows
the tremendous strength of
revisionism within the movement
here and abroad.
Lenin has said, "The whole
task of the proletarians in the

national question is 'impractical'
from the standpoint of the
nationalist bourgeoisie of every
nation, because, being opposed to
all nationalism [my emphasis,
1.8.], the proletarians demand
'abstract' equality, they demand
that on principle there shall be no
privileges, however slight."
Stalin has said, "Sometimes the
bourgeoisie succeeds in drawing
the proletariat into the national

openly proclaim socialism as a
goal have not and indeed cannot
lead to the liberation of the
peoples struggling against
imperialism.
It is not an accident that more
clever imperialists such as
McCarthy and Kennedy (who are
now organizing honest [and some
not so honest] people behind
their "Moratorium" fraud) have
long since realized that
nationalism is not a threat to U.S.
interests. The U.S. Government
has managed to "co-exist" very
"peacefully" with "national
communists" and revisionists of
all stripes, whose socialist phrases
mask naked natioanlism.
Sonorous Title
"Socialists" who never tire of
referring to the late Ho Chi Minh
as "George Washington of
Vietnam" ought to examine the
essence of this sonorous title. It
implies that no basic
contradictions ought to exist
between Vietnamese nationalism
and U.S. imperialism. If this is
what they mean, they they are
quite right. This is precisely what
the revisionist program of the
Provisional "Revolutionary"
Government of Vietnam envisions
in its article No. 12, where its
authors state their intention "to
accept aid, with no political
conditions attached [! j, from any
country . ..[which of course
includes the U.S. ].
The U.S. Government, on its
part, is already drawing up plans
for economic "co-operation" with
Vietnam after the termination of
hostilities. In this respect U.S.
imperialism is much more
sophisticated than the apologists
for "revolutionary" nationalism.
Proletariat Dictatorship
It sees clearly that as long as
the dictatorship of the proletariat
is not the order of the day (and it
isn't: check the same PRG or NLF
programs' for any reference to
socialism or produce any
independent socialist program
from the southern section of the
Vietnamese Lao Dong [Workers]
Party) the essence of the current
struggle in Vietnam is an attempt
of one group of would-be-capital
ists to fight outside capitalists for
profits. The problem is that Mr.
Andre, as well as so many others,
has not learned much from the
tragedy of revisionism and
capitalist restoration in the USSR
and eleven other former socialist
countries.
This reversal has been
conveniently accomplished under
the guise of "updating" socialism.
No one should be deceived by this
stratagem. We must carefully
distinguish between what
revisionists say and what
revisionists do. I challenge Mr.
Andre to show me one nationalist
who built socialism.
Similarly, I challenge Mr.
Andre to show me one Marxist
reference which proclaims the
nationalism of the oppressor
nation as reactionary and the
nationalism of the oppressed
nation as progressive. [Citing Mr.
Bruce Franklin will not do. Mr.
Franklin might be an authority on
science fiction, but he is no
Marxist. Marxists, you see, believe
in classes.] Marxist-Leninists
distinguish between oppressor and
oppressed nations for the purpose
of breaking down chauvinism
which hinders the unity of all
workers, and not in order to raise
the possibility that some
nationalism is better than other.
(This is the first in a series of two
articles by Ivo Banac, graduate
student in History and member of
the SDS Worker-Student Alliance
Caucus, written in response to an
article by T. H. Andre.)
As the panelist who defended
the Progressive Labor Party's
positions at the SDS-sponsored
meeting on the U.S. radical
movement, I read with deep
interest Mr. T. H. Andre's
reassessment of "our" thesis that
"all nationalism is reactionary."
In replying to Mr. Andre I
would, first of all, like to point
out that this position is not a
property of the PLP, nor has it
been invented by the PLP.
Marxist—Leninists have always
advanced this thesis. The fact that
this claim is now so widely
challenged among our
"revolutionaries" merely shows
the tremendous strength of
revisionism within the movement
here and abroad.
Lenin has said, "The whole
task of the proletarians in the

national question is 'impractical'
from the standpoint of the
nationalist bourgeoisie of every
nation, because, being opposed to
all nationalism [my emphasis,
1.8.], the proletarians demand
'abstract' equality, they demand
that on principle there shall be no
privileges, however slight."
Stalin has said, "Sometimes the
bourgeoisie succeeds in drawing
the proletariat into the national
movement, and then the national
struggle externally assumes a
'nation-wide' character. But this is
so only externally. In its essence it
is always a bourgeois struggle, one
that is to the advantage and profit
„ mainly of the bourgeoisie."
Nationalist Movements
What is fundamental in Mr.
Andre's article is his assumption
that "certain contemporary
nationalist movements are
progressive, in the present
historical conditions."
What is nationalism? Is it an
ideology which stands above
classes? Does it contradict Mao
Tsetung's profoundly Marxist

observation that in a class society
"every kind of thinking, without
exception, is stamped with the
brand of a class?" Of course not!
Nationalism is a bourgeois
ideology which came into
existence in the era of bourgeois
revolutions, at the time when the
bourgeoisie was a progressive class
fighting against feudalism.
Nationalism holds that
members of a national group,
regardless of class have, as Mr.
Andre so well puts it, "a
communal integrity" that is
stronger than the ties between
workers of different nations.
Two-Stage Struggle
Although Mr. Andre never
states that he is defending
nationalism in light of the
so-called "two-stage stuggle," i.e.
that the struggle for national
liberation is subsequently
transformed into a socialist
revolution, we are to presume that
he has the interests of socialism
(dictatorship of the proletariat) at
heart when he defends the
nationalism of (among others) the
Vietnamese leadership.
Recent experience in Algeria,
Indonesia as well as in Vietnam
have shown that national
liberation movements that do not
openly proclaim socialism as a
goal have not and indeed cannot
lead to the liberation of the
peoples struggling against
imperialism.
It is not an accident that more
clever imperialists such as
McCarthy and Kennedy (who are
now organizing honest [and some
not so honest] people behind
their "Moratorium" fraud) have
long since realized that
nationalism is not a threat to U.S.
