# At Livingston Clinic
## Students Aid Chicanos 
### LAURA FOSTER 
The nation faces a health-care
crisis, and Wells Shoemaker of the
Stanford Medical School is doing
something about it. Last spring,
the dynamic second-year medical
student organized a free
community health clinic to serve

Chicano farm workers in rural
Merced County. The clinic now
serves over 400 needy patients
who would not otherwise get the
health care they need.
Located at Livingston, the
clinic operates three evenings a
week. Shoemaker and about
twenty other medical students of
the "new breed," i.e., the liberal,
socially concerned type, make the
five-hour roundtrip to serve the
clinic and gain practical
experience. Their work is
supervised by medical school
faculty and a local physician, Dr.
J.J. Wolohan, a 1944 Stanford
medical alumnus.
"This is not a band-aid and
cold clinic," says Shoemaker. "We
see a wide variety of cases,
including general medicine,
pediatric, surgical, and obstetrical
cases." The most common
medical problem of the farm
workers is low-back muscular pain
Shoemaker said. He said the pain
results from the workers bending
over to pick tomatoes in the
fields. Infections are also a
frequent complaint, and they
account for about 25 per cent of
patient-visits, Shoemaker said.
Established as an independent
agency, the clinic is supported by
many individuals at Stanford. It
receives some financial support
from the Dean's office. The
clinic's activities are supervised by
a community board made up of
representatives of the Livingston
Community Action Council and
the Neighborhood Services
Center.

The Clinic is an example of
innovative medical care, according
to Shoemaker. He said, "The
University has a responsibility to
establish models for health care in
this country. Private doctors can't
do it. The government can't do it.
Therefore, the University must do
it. because it has the resources."
The Spanish- s p e a k in g
inhabitants have accepted the
medical students very well,
according to Shoemaker.
Historically, he said, such
predominately poor communities
have resented being used as
"guinea pigs." They have termed
the medical students second-class
doctors, and have demanded real
doctors, Shoemaker said.
The most important link
between the students and the
community is provided by four
bi-lingual Chicano aides. They
serve as interpreters, receptionists,
nurse's aides, and public relations
agents, Shoemaker said. "I can't
give them enough credit, he
added. "They're sensitive, gentle
interpreters, and they
communicate well with the
people." The aides' salaries are
paid by a federal office of
Economic Opportunity grant.
To date, the clinic has seen
over 400 patients in 800
patient-visits. Drugs prescribed are
bought wholesale or donated by
pharmaceutical companies such as
Upjohn. Ninety percent of the
drugs prescribed are free to
patients, he said.
To Wells Shoemaker, the idea
for a free medical clinic to help
the needy came easily. A bright
and capable idealist, he completed
his undergraduate education at
Stanford in three years. Initially
an engineering major, he switched
to medicine because he was
"frustrated and needed a more
personal field," he said.
At 23, Shoemaker has lived in
several Eastern and Midwestern
cities. As a doctor, he plans to
specialize in internal medicine. He
hopes to go into innovative
community medicine as a career.
Summing up the advantages of
the program he helped found, he
said, "First it will provide
comprehensive health service.
Second, it will give students and
faculty an experience in primary
care. Third, it will provide a link
between the University and
outside practitioners." As one
attempt to mitigate the nation's
health care crisis, the program is a
worthwhile effort.

student, examines one of the Chicano field workers that he and
twenty others have set out to help at their free clinic in Livingston,
Merced County.
The nation faces a health-care
crisis, and Wells Shoemaker of the
Stanford Medical School is doing
something about it. Last spring,
the dynamic second-year medical
student organized a free
community health clinic to serve

Chicano farm workers in rural
Merced County. The clinic now
serves over 400 needy patients
who would not otherwise get the
health care they need.
Located at Livingston, the
clinic operates three evenings a
week. Shoemaker and about
twenty other medical students of
the "new breed," i.e., the liberal,
socially concerned type, make the
five-hour roundtrip to serve the
clinic and gain practical
experience. Their work is
supervised by medical school
faculty and a local physician, Dr.
J.J. Wolohan, a 1944 Stanford
medical alumnus.
"This is not a band-aid and
cold clinic," says Shoemaker. "We
see a wide variety of cases,
including general medicine,
pediatric, surgical, and obstetrical
cases." The most common
medical problem of the farm
workers is low-back muscular pain
Shoemaker said. He said the pain
results from the workers bending
over to pick tomatoes in the
fields. Infections are also a
frequent complaint, and they
account for about 25 per cent of
patient-visits, Shoemaker said.
Established as an independent
agency, the clinic is supported by
many individuals at Stanford. It
receives some financial support
from the Dean's office. The
clinic's activities are supervised by
a community board made up of
representatives of the Livingston
Community Action Council and
the Neighborhood Services
Center.

The Clinic is an example of
innovative medical care, according
to Shoemaker. He said, "The
University has a responsibility to
establish models for health care in
this country. Private doctors can't
do it. The government can't do it.
Therefore, the University must do
it. because it has the resources."
The Spanish- s p e a k in g
inhabitants have accepted the
medical students very well,
according to Shoemaker.
Historically, he said, such
predominately poor communities
have resented being used as
"guinea pigs." They have termed
the medical students second-class
doctors, and have demanded real
doctors, Shoemaker said.
The most important link
between the students and the
community is provided by four
bi-lingual Chicano aides. They
serve as interpreters, receptionists,
nurse's aides, and public relations
agents, Shoemaker said. "I can't
give them enough credit, he
added. "They're sensitive, gentle
interpreters, and they
communicate well with the
people." The aides' salaries are
paid by a federal office of
Economic Opportunity grant.
To date, the clinic has seen
over 400 patients in 800
patient-visits. Drugs prescribed are
bought wholesale or donated by
pharmaceutical companies such as
Upjohn. Ninety percent of the
drugs prescribed are free to
patients, he said.
To Wells Shoemaker, the idea
for a free medical clinic to help
the needy came easily. A bright
and capable idealist, he completed
his undergraduate education at
Stanford in three years. Initially
an engineering major, he switched
to medicine because he was
"frustrated and needed a more
personal field," he said.
At 23, Shoemaker has lived in
several Eastern and Midwestern
cities. As a doctor, he plans to
specialize in internal medicine. He
hopes to go into innovative
community medicine as a career.
Summing up the advantages of
the program he helped found, he
