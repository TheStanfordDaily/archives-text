## Frat Decline, Housing Shortage Spawn Image Change Over Last Three Years 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Stanford's eating clubs, often called pacified fraternities, have
undergone great changes in the three years since Brakers admitted its
first female member. For the first half-century of their existence the
clubs remained all male and selective about their memberships. Today
all but one of the seven clubs on the "L" are co-educational. The
dissenter, El Toro, is also the only club which has retained a formal
rush. Four clubs now board freshmen from Toy on Hall.
Club members offer many theories to explain the drastic changes
they have witnessed in the last three years. Inter-club Council
President Phillip Mathewson cites the decline of selective living over
the entire campus. "The Fraternity Image is losing ground at
Stanford. Fifty per cent of the fraternities now take in boarders to
help meet expenses. The popularity of all male dormitories has
dropped decidedly in recent years. The eating clubs sensed this trend
early."
Clubs Accept Frosh
The University Administration has played a substantive role in
hastening changes on the "L". In 1968 Stanford found itself in the
embarrassing position of having accepted more freshmen than it could
house. A search ensued for a place to hold the overflow. Toyon Hall,
traditional residence hall for members of the eating clubs, was
considered by the Committee on Housing as a partial solution to the
problem. The plan was to house approximately forty freshmen in
Toyon.
It only remained for the University to find a source of food for the
incoming frosh. The solution to this problem was obvious. Several of
the clubs were experiencing serious financial problems at the time,
and perhaps were more receptive to having freshmen assigned to them
for this reason. In any case, the advent of freshmen marked the end of
selective membership in those clubs which accepted them.
Now in its second year, the University-eating clubs arrangement
seems to have been a success. The clubs have benefitted financially.
The freshmen residents of Toyon enjoy the advantages of eating club
memberships without all of the obligations. The University obtained
another four year co-educational dormitory and a depository for forty
freshmen.
Changes in Toyon
Sidney Weiss, a resident assistant in Toyon and an eating club
member for four and a half years, believes the greatest effect of the
eating clubs' new membership policies has been a change of
atmosphere in Toyon Hall. "Three years ago Toyon was dead. People
literally went the entire year without learning the names of the
students next door. All their social activities centered around their
eating clubs. Even with reshmen and women living here Toyon is
quiet, but it's much livelier than before."
The changes seen in El Cuadro are typical of those which have
occurred in other clubs in recent years. Rarely selective about
membership—its rush was termed the "El Cuadro Railroad"—the club
narrowly passed a motion to accept female members at a meeting in
1968.
Last year only two women joined El Cuadro. With its membership
dangerously low, the club conducted a vigorous rush during Reg.
Week this September. Today El Cuadro boasts approximately 50
members, including 11 women and nine freshmen.
Women Change Scene
Cuadro President Dennis Morrow states, "The principal effect of
admitting women into El Cuadro was been a freer, looser atmosphere.
Otherwise the club isn't all that different. What little tradition Cuadro

has lost is more due to the influx of new members than to the advent
of freshmen and women into the club."
Phil Mathewson rejects the allegations that the changes in eating
club membership policies symbolize the death of a Stanford tradition.
"The eating clubs haven't abandoned their traditional purpose. The
club is still a place where one can dine with his friends and be on a
first name basis with the cook. Most of the clubs still have social and
athletic programs. The trailer village has been a tremendous boost for
the clubs. Many former Toyon residents have moved into the trailers
and have stayed in the clubs. Trailer people have joined the clubs in
large numbers."
"Some traditions have died," allows Sid Weiss. "The Monday night
club meetings are no longer bull sessions. It's harder to show stag
movies. But that kind of tradition isn't missed. The clubs are more
humanized, more pleasant now."

PACIFIED FRATERNITIES?—Stanford's eating clubs maintained all
male membership through selective rush for fifty years. Today all but
one are coed, and have no formal rush. Here Keiji Muranaga makes an
