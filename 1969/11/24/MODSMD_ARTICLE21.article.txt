# Godard's Best Film Highlight Of Week
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Jean Luc Godard's best film
marks the highlight of the movie
week, which is filled out by the
assorted contributions of Sergei
Eisenstein, George Cukor, Jane
Fonda, the Marx Brothers and a
giant ape.
A special showing of
Eisenstein's classic, Ten Days That
Shook the World, has been
arranged for Monday at 7 and 9 in
Bishop Auditorium. Actually, the
film seems less organized and less
powerful than Potemhin but
many scenes are extremely
powerful and the picture should
definitely be seen, even if it is a
bit difficult to sit through.
Being shown on Monday at 9
p.m. in the art auditorium are
Betty Boop Historical Marker,
America's Wonderful, Kill for
Peace, Ephesus, and Nothing
Happened This Morning.
Lone Affair is an acclaimed but
publically neglected film from
Yugoslavia. Directed by Dusan
Makavejev, this humorous but
compassionate picture will be
shown by the International
Association on Tuesday at 7:45 in
Cubberley.
Showing on Tuesday in
Geology 320 are King Kong and
Duck Soup . . .I'll say no more.
Masculine Feminine is by far
my favorite of Godard's films and
could not be excluded from a list
of the best films of the sixties.
Godard, the most relentlessly
modern of contemporary

directors, creates scene after
remarkable scene which, though
sometimes seemingly trivial and
unrelated to the rest of the movie,
combine to convey an
extraordinary vision of modern
youth. It is in this picture that
Godard achieves that which
strikes me as the perfect balance
between his intense interest in
human beings and his penchant
for political commentary, for
these are "the children of Marx
and Coca-Cola." If you're on
campus over the break, you
shouldn't miss Tresidder's Friday
film.
Gaslight, directed by George
Cukor, is an opulent, entertaining
romantic mystery, and marks the
famous first pairing of Ingrid
Bergman and Charles Boyer.
Bergman won an Academy Award
for her work and is further
supported by Joseph Cotten,
Dame May Whitty and teenage
Angela Lansbury. At Tresidder on
Saturday.
Barbarella, with its vulgar sets
and trashy script, loses out on the
distinction as 1968's space idiocy
only because of Jane Fonda,
whose wide-eyed display of
innocence in even the most
ludicrously erotic circumstances is
rather delightful. As the calendar
says, have some white meat for
Thanksgiving. However, be sure to
get to the Sunday Flicks on time,
for the opening space suit
striptease is the best part of the
movie.
