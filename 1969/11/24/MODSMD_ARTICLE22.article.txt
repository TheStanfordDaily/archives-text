# Fills Lake Lag
## Bonfire Crowd Big But Not Fired -Up 
### 
A large but unenthusiastic
crowd filled much of Lake Lag
Friday night to watch the annual
bonfire.
Perhaps 10,000 people, many
of them non-students, saw the
huge bonfire and rally. Many
parents with small children, along
with the students, listened
patiently to the band and
speeches while waiting for the
fire.
The bonfire was a success as
usual.
Saturday several houses
displayed homecoming
decorations. Durand House and
Faisan took the sweepstakes prize.
The originality and theme prize
went to SAE and Roth, and the
animation prize went to Sigma
Chi Omega and Guthrie.
Durand has won the animation
prize for the last two years. Its
entry this year consisted of an
Indian chopping off the head of a
bear while a miniature "card
section" flashed a slogan. Durand
is the university's smallest
residence.
Cal had the final "one up" on
RF's when an airplane leafleted
the campus Friday afternoon. The
leafteting came at about 12:45
and consisted of small squares of
paper with Cal slogans written on
them.
