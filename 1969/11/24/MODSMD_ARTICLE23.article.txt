# Wolfe I11, Won't Speak
## 
### 
Bertram Wolfe, who was slated
to speak this afternoon on "The
Adventures of a Mexican Delegate
in Stalinist Russia" has cancelled
his engagement due to illness.
Wolfe, who once was a
communist but has since turned
away from the doctrine, is an
historian and researcher at the
Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace. One of the
founders of the American
Communist Party, he was the
official delegate to the Comintern
of 1924 in Moscow from the
Mexican Trade Unions, the
peasant unions of the State of
Veracruz and the Mexican
Communist Party.
While a communist, Wolfe
worked with Ho Chi Minh and
other top communist leaders.
