# White, Black NAACP Leaders' Ties Outlined
## 
### PETER JOHANSEN 
The personal and business
relationships between white
liberal Joel Spingarn and W.E.B.
Du Bois, a black, during the early
decades of the century were
traced by Afro-American historian
Joyce Ross for about 20 students
and professors here Friday
afternoon.
"It is a basic liberal thought
that a man indeed need not be
black to become sincerely
outraged at the second-class status
of his fellow citizens," the Kent
State University professor said,
introducing her lecture on the two
prominent figures of the NAACP.
The two men had personal

respect for each other, based on
academic achievement and social
conscience, although their
respective views on running the
NAACP deteriorated over the
years, Miss Ross said.
She blamed Du Bois' ultimate
disenchantment with the
organization on a disagreement
over the concept of voluntary
segregation. The white liberals,
who wholly led the body until the
first black was elected to the
board of directors in 1934, called
for total integration. "Dußois
believed that segregation was not
an evil in itself, but in how it was
used."
Economic Disagreements
The two men also disagreed
over economic change. The white
Spingarn, elected chairman of the
NAACP in 1914, * believed "a
program of economic uplift was
complimentary but secondary to
civil and political rights," Miss
Ross said. Du Bois was an
economic liberal, although he was
not a Marxist in his early years
with the organization.
Du Bois maintained that as
director of the NAACP's publicity
and research office—which
included editing The Crisis, a
Negro rights magazine—he should
not be responsible to the Board.
"He was the only black
executive officer and contended
that autonomy for him was
necessary if the blacks were not to
be smothered by the whites in the
organization," Miss Ross said.
Spingard sided with Du Bois in
safeguarding editorial freedom for
The Crisis, "because there should
be at least one publication in
America where a Negro can
express his views without being
responsible to a white man." But
Spingard would not agree to
separation of the publicity and
research office, as he wanted to
preserve a united front within the
organization.
Miss Ross has written a
forthcoming book on he subject.
