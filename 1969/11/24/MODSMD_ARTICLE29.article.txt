# 6-6 Deadlock
## Scribes Tie; Ink Jinx Broken 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
The legendary Ink Bowl jinx
was broken Saturday -but not by
a helluva lot.
\ The straights from the
STANFORD DAILY and the
hippie rads from the DAILY
CALIFORNIAN groveled 4.heir
way to an incredibly sloppy 6-6
tie, making this the first year in
the last seven when the outcome
of the Big Game was not
conclusively determined by the
result of the annual Saturday
morning clash of scribes.
The problem was that each
team was acutely aware that the
Ink Bowl winner inevitably
represents the school which goes
on to lose the Big Game. So both
squads entered the contest
hell-bent on losing, hopefully as
bjadly as possible.
â€¢ Vegas oddsmakers, far off
target as usual, had installed the
DAILY as a 13-point underdog, a
prediction based primarily on he
admission of DAILY
dALIFORNIAN sports editor
Gordon Sakuae that "we are
bigger and stronger this year" but
also on last year's result (Cal 21,
Stanford 13).
! But the point spread was as far
olff target as most of the passes
thrown by DAILY quarterback
Dave Jones. completed seven

of 23 aerials and was intercepted
four times. Jones, running the
offense for the second year in a
row, commented between puffs at
half time that he had "smoked all
morning to get up for this game."
It looked like it.
Cal Scores
After a DAILY drive sputtered
and failed Cal gained possession
on its own 20 and scored the
game's first points in an eight play
drive. Despite a ferocious rush by
a meaty defense led by ringers
Bruce Fauman and Manleigh
Virile, Cal quarterback Sakuae
completed five passes, including a
crucial fourth down sideline
bomb. The TD pass was a five
yard toss to Steve Goldblatt, and
after a PAT pass was incomplete,
the DAILY CALIFORNIAN
retained a 6-0 lead.
By this point DAILY coach
Fred Mann was threatening to
make some drastic changes in the
offensive unit, but the squad,
hovering about a strategically
placed keg during the
intermission appeared unworried.
Jocks Come Back
Midway through he second half
the DAILY mounted its only
successful drive of the morning.
Gaining possession on their own
11, the locals used a dazzling
combination of passing and

running to score. Jones began the
drive with a ten-yard completion
to Scott Burns for a first down.
Then, in perhaps the most
spectular play of the day, Jones
dropped back, faked once and
lofted a long bomb to the fleet
Mann, who garnered the pigskin
on the right sideline near midfield
and raced to the Cal ten before
being brought down from behind.
Two incompletions later Cal
committed a vicious case of pass
interference in the end/one, and
to cries from the Berkeley side
that "The judicial system has been
co-opted," the officials awarded
the ball to the DAILY on the Cal
five.
The incident provoked the first
ugly mood of the contest and
time was called when Burns,
attempting to run the ball in for a
score, was shaken up. An
incompletion later, Jones powered
his way to he two to set up
Stanford's only TD of the day.
Taking a pitchout from Jones,
Hall Daily, an unheralded tennis
scribe, faded back to his left, then
fired a bullet to photog Bill
Hudson who was smothered by
three defenders as he caught the
ball one yard into the endzone.
The conversion attempt was a
Jones pass to Mann, but failed
when the coach fell on the one

after leaping high in the endzone
to make the catch. Furious
protestations from DAILY-ites on
all sides failed to sway the refs,
and the score was knotted a 6-all.
Mann Wiped Out
Sports editor Mann was injured
on the play and left the game.
(See adjoining story).
A Burns interception gave the
DAILY possession again, but even
he presence of Felicity Barringer
and Julie Fleece in the lineup
failed to spark a meaningful drive.
The game ended with a plethora
of interceptions by both sides,
and a stirring repeat of the rousing
cheers heard at the start.
Thus the 6-6 tie, and already
the pundits are speculating on the
outcome of next year's contest.

quarter Ink Howl action Saturday. Despite the consistently
sensational protection lie received, Jones had an of/ day and

completed only seven of 23 passes. Scribes from the DAILY and Cal's
DAILY CALIFORNIAN played to a 6-6 tic. Action took place on the
IM field near Maples Pavilion.
