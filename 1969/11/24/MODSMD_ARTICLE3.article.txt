## Air Strikes Resumed 
### 
SAIGON (AP)— Anticipating an
enemy buildup, the U.S.
Command has launched a new air
campaign against North
Vietnamese road networks in
neighboring Laos, official sources
reported Sunday.
They said U.S. Navy planes
flying from two carriers in the
Gulf of Tonkin have been diverted
from targets in South Vietnam to
join the Air Force in strikes in
eastern Laos.
The U.S. Command declined to
comment on the reports but 7th
fleet communiques showed that
Navy planes had flown no
missions in South Vietnam for the
past five days.
"This is a key time," one of
the informants said. "We're
keeping the pressure on."
Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird said in Washington recently
that there has been some increase
in the infiltration of North
Vietnamese troops into South
Vietnam during the past two
weeks.
Official sources have said that
North Vietnamese troops have
repaired road networks called the
Ho Chi Minh Trail through eastern
Laos, the enemy's main
infiltration corridor into South
Vietnam.
"They are close to the
capability now of beginning a
buildup," said one course. "The
question is: Will they exercise it?
Everything they say in their
documents indicates they will."
Several hundred Navy and Air
Force planes make daily raids in
Laos, but now that the monsoons
have ended, the American raids
have been stepped up.

The mission of the bombers is
to knock out repaired road
networds before the enemy can
begin hauling war material,
stocked in truck parks in North
Vietnam, through Laos and into
South Vietnam. Another mission
is to interdict troop movements
through Laos that have already
begun, according to Laird.
Sources noted that since the
halt in the bombing of North
Vietnam more than a year ago,
the enemy has been able to move
his supply much farther south to
large passes leading directly into
the trial network in Laos, without
fear of them being interdicted.

Alcatraz Camp-out
SAN FRANCISCO
(AP)—Reinforced with food and
blankets, more than 100
American Indians continued
camping on Alcatraz Island in San
Francisco Bay Sunday while
federal officials tried to figure out
how to get them off.
Temperatures dropped to near
freezing on the 21-acre island—site
of a former federal prison—and
Indians coordinating the
occupation from the shore sent
over more blankets. ,
The island has no fresh water
and no heating other than that
t supplied for the caretaker and his
two assistants.
The Indians, representing 30
tribes, have been on the island
since Thursday. They claim the
island under an 1868 treaty that
gave unoccupied federal land
to the Sioux, and propose to build
a native American cultural center.

TOKYO (AP)Communist
China denounced the Soviet
Union by name Sunday and a
Japanese news dispatch from
Peking said this indicated China's
displeasure with the Soviet
attitude in border talks under way
in the Chinese capital.
Communist China has refrained
from sounding off against the
Soviet Union by name since the
two nations opened the talks Oct.
20 aimed at solving their critical
border dispute.
