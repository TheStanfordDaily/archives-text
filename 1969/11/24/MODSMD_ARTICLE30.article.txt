# Mann Injured In Classic
## 
### 
DAILY sports editor Fred
Mann suffered a mild concussion
and slight loss of memory when
injured in Saturday's Ink Bowl
touch football game between the
staffs of the DAILY and the
DAILY CALIFORNIAN.
The accident occurred while
Mann was jumping for a pass on a
conversion attempt after the

DAILY scored its, only
touchdown of the day. He caught
the ball over the end zone but
came down in a heap with a Cal
defender outside of it. The point
was not allowed and the game
subsequently ended in a 6-6 tie.
Obviously shaken up on the
play, coach Mann, one of the few
legitimate stars of the contest
removed himself from the game
and was driven to the Health
Center where his injury was
diagnosed. He was released to
cover the Big Game for the
DAILY.
But midway through the third
period he was bothered by a

headache and returned to the
Health Center after the game. He
spent Saturday night and all day
Sunday bedridden in his trailer
suite and was unable to remember
many of the details of Saturday
morning.
The DAILY sports staff was
unexpectedly thrown into a state
of chaos and herewith begs
pardon for any irregularities in
this morning's pages.
Mann will have his head
examined today but current
conjecture around the sports desk
is that the X-rays will show
nothing.
