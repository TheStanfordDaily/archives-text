# Zetes Perfect! Edge Phi Delts And Bears
## 
### SCOTT BURNS 
The Zetes wrapped up a
perfect IM football season by
winning the IM championship
over the Phi Delts on Friday, and
then beating the Psi U's of
California for the Big Game IM
Championships on Saturday.
The IM championship game on
Friday was one of the greatest
games seen in IM's this year. The
score between these evenly
matched teams bounced back and
forth the whole game with the
Zetes finally winning 25-20. The
game was quite physical, and the
many grunts, groans, crashes and
smashes thrilled the large crowd
of over a thousand.
The Zetes opened the scoring
on a pass to Rob Towner from
quarterback Steve Kistler to make
the score 6-0. Steve Longbotham
had set up the score a few minutes
before by intercepting a Frank
Duffy pass.
But the Phi Delts came right
back on a TD pass to Greg Kowal,
and an extra point to Mike Bush
put them ahead 7-6. The Phi Delt
momentum did not stop for they
then held the Zetes and went on
to score two plays later on a
40-yard pass to Hi Lewis. Another
Bush extra point put them out in
front by a 14-6 margin.
Kistler Sharp
At this point Steve Kistler
started to zero in with his passes.
A long pass to Steve Longbotham
set the ball on the Phi Delt two
yard line, but Tom Jenks caught
Kistler behind the line on the next
play for a 13-yard loss. Kistler
rallied and found his favorite
receiver, Towner, in the endzone
for the TD. This led to halftime
score of 14-13 in favor of the Phi
Delts.
The Zetes got the ball first in
the second half and marched
down the field with key passes to
Towner, Longbotham, and the
blocking backs. Kistler finally ran
it over from the 9-yard line when
all of his receivers were covered in
the endzone to put the Zetes
ahead 18-14.
The Phi Delts then got the ball,
and Frank Duffy's first pass was
intercepted by the Zetes, but two
plays later Duffy got revenge
when he made a fantastic leaping
interception. The Phi Delts got
going again and moved right up

the field to score with key
penalties on the Zetes keeping the
drive alive. A ten-yard pass from
Duffy to Mark Tucker made the
score 20-18 with three minutes
left in the game.
With the pressure on, the Zetes
marched right back down the field
with three passes to Lonubotham
getting most of the yardage. Then
Towner caught his third TD pass
of the day to put the Zetes out in
front 24-20. Longbotham made a
diving catch for the extra point to
make the score 25-20 with 37
seconds left.
Todd Peterson intercepted a
Phi Delt pass two plays later to
put the game out of reach for the
Phi Delts. Both teams played
exceedingly well, and it's too bad
one had to lose.
Cal Game
The Zetes had a little more
trouble Saturday when they
played Psi Upsilon, Cal's IM
champion. The problem was not
that the Psi U's were really great,
but that the Zetes weren't quite
physically up for the
game—something new for them.
They had been celebrating the
whole night before, out at the
Rat's and the Goose, and
"Hangover Harsssment" was the
Zetes biggest opposition. The
whole team was up for the game,
not in spirit but on Alka-Seltzer.
Probably the most affected was
Steve Kistler, the Zete
quarterback. Because of superior
blocking all season, he had never
been dumped for a loss in a
football game, but the night
before he had been dumped for a
gigantic loss when he turned over
his cycle.
Playing under extreme
handicaps to both mind and body
(the rest of the team just had
mind handicaps), his play in he
firsthalf was somewhat spotty.
Another handicap was that the
Zetes were used to playing in rags,
but on Saturday they wore old
Stanford football jersies to tell
them from the Psi U's who played
in their torn shirts and rags.
Problems
Steve had problems telling his
teamamtes for his mind was still
in Friday's world, and twice he
spotted a free man in the endzone
in a ragged uniform and passed to

him, not remembering that the
guy was on the other team.
He did complete a few
though one being a long bomb to
Longbotham for a score. The
score at the half was 7-6, the
Zetes behind.
In he second half, the Zetes
replaced Kistler with Marshall
Goldberg, the house RA, who had
quarterbacked the Second Year
Law team, and he was their
answer. He moved the ball well he
first time they had the ball.
Corner Pass
A 30-yard pass to blocking
back Tom Hornbeak put the hall
inside the 20, and a Goldberg run
set the ball ont he 7-yard line.
Then, after three plays failed to
gain any yardage, Goldberg hit
Rob Towner on a perfect pass in
the corner on the endzone for the
TD. What a key fourth down play!
A pass to blocking back Greg
Cramblit made the score 1 3-7.
The Psi U's got the ball back
and marched down the field to
the ten, but Rob Towner
intercepted a pass, and the game
was never in jeopardy after that.
The Zetes 13-7 win made the
third year in a row that the
Stanford champion had beaten
Cal's champion.

marched right back down the field
with three passes to Lonubotham
getting most of the yardage. Then
Towner caught his third TD pass
of the day to put the Zetes out in
front 24-20. Longbotham made a
diving catch for the extra point to
make the score 25-20 with 37
seconds left.
Todd Peterson intercepted a
Phi Delt pass two plays later to
put the game out of reach for the
Phi Delts. Both teams played
exceedingly well, and it's too bad
one had to lose.
Cal Game
The Zetes had a little more
trouble Saturday when they
played Psi Upsilon, Cal's IM
champion. The problem was not
that the Psi U's were really great,
but that the Zetes weren't quite
physically up for the
game—something new for them.
They had been celebrating the
whole night before, out at the
Rat's and the Goose, and
"Hangover Harsssment" was the
Zetes biggest opposition. The
whole team was up for the game,
not in spirit but on Alka-Seltzer.
Probably the most affected was
Steve Kistler, the Zete
quarterback. Because of superior
blocking all season, he had never
been dumped for a loss in a
football game, but the night
before he had been dumped for a
gigantic loss when he turned over
his cycle.
Playing under extreme
handicaps to both mind and body
(the rest of the team just had
mind handicaps), his play in he
firsthalf was somewhat spotty.
Another handicap was that the
Zetes were used to playing in rags,
but on Saturday they wore old
Stanford football jersies to tell
them from the Psi U's who played
in their torn shirts and rags.
Problems
Steve had problems telling his
teamamtes for his mind was still
in Friday's world, and twice he
spotted a free man in the endzone
in a ragged uniform and passed to

him, not remembering that the
guy was on the other team.
He did complete a few
though one being a long bomb to
Longbotham for a score. The
score at the half was 7-6, the
Zetes behind.
In he second half, the Zetes
replaced Kistler with Marshall
Goldberg, the house RA, who had
quarterbacked the Second Year
Law team, and he was their
answer. He moved the ball well he
first time they had the ball.
Corner Pass
A 30-yard pass to blocking
back Tom Hornbeak put the hall
inside the 20, and a Goldberg run
set the ball ont he 7-yard line.
Then, after three plays failed to
gain any yardage, Goldberg hit
Rob Towner on a perfect pass in
the corner on the endzone for the
TD. What a key fourth down play!
A pass to blocking back Greg
Cramblit made the score 1 3-7.
The Psi U's got the ball back
and marched down the field to
the ten, but Rob Towner
intercepted a pass, and the game
was never in jeopardy after that.
The Zetes 13-7 win made the
third year in a row that the
Stanford champion had beaten
Cal's champion.
The Zetes wrapped up a
perfect IM football season by
winning the IM championship
over the Phi Delts on Friday, and
then beating the Psi U's of
California for the Big Game IM
Championships on Saturday.
The IM championship game on
Friday was one of the greatest
games seen in IM's this year. The
score between these evenly
matched teams bounced back and
forth the whole game with the
Zetes finally winning 25-20. The
game was quite physical, and the
many grunts, groans, crashes and
smashes thrilled the large crowd
of over a thousand.
The Zetes opened the scoring
on a pass to Rob Towner from
quarterback Steve Kistler to make
the score 6-0. Steve Longbotham
had set up the score a few minutes
before by intercepting a Frank
Duffy pass.
But the Phi Delts came right
back on a TD pass to Greg Kowal,
and an extra point to Mike Bush
put them ahead 7-6. The Phi Delt
momentum did not stop for they
then held the Zetes and went on
to score two plays later on a
40-yard pass to Hi Lewis. Another
Bush extra point put them out in
front by a 14-6 margin.
Kistler Sharp
At this point Steve Kistler
started to zero in with his passes.
A long pass to Steve Longbotham
set the ball on the Phi Delt two
yard line, but Tom Jenks caught
Kistler behind the line on the next
play for a 13-yard loss. Kistler
rallied and found his favorite
receiver, Towner, in the endzone
for the TD. This led to halftime
score of 14-13 in favor of the Phi
Delts.
The Zetes got the ball first in
the second half and marched
down the field with key passes to
Towner, Longbotham, and the
blocking backs. Kistler finally ran
it over from the 9-yard line when
all of his receivers were covered in
the endzone to put the Zetes
ahead 18-14.
The Phi Delts then got the ball,
and Frank Duffy's first pass was
intercepted by the Zetes, but two
plays later Duffy got revenge
when he made a fantastic leaping
interception. The Phi Delts got
going again and moved right up

the field to score with key
penalties on the Zetes keeping the
drive alive. A ten-yard pass from
Duffy to Mark Tucker made the
score 20-18 with three minutes
left in the game.
With the pressure on, the Zetes

set the ball ont he 7-yard line.
Then, after three plays failed to
gain any yardage, Goldberg hit
Rob Towner on a perfect pass in
the corner on the endzone for the
TD. What a key fourth down play!
A pass to blocking back Greg
Cramblit made the score 1 3-7.
The Psi U's got the ball back
and marched down the field to
the ten, but Rob Towner
intercepted a pass, and the game
was never in jeopardy after that.
The Zetes 13-7 win made the
third year in a row that the
Stanford champion had beaten
Cal's champion.
The Zetes wrapped up a
perfect IM football season by
winning the IM championship
over the Phi Delts on Friday, and
then beating the Psi U's of
California for the Big Game IM
Championships on Saturday.
The IM championship game on
Friday was one of the greatest
games seen in IM's this year. The
score between these evenly
matched teams bounced back and
forth the whole game with the
Zetes finally winning 25-20. The
game was quite physical, and the
many grunts, groans, crashes and
smashes thrilled the large crowd
of over a thousand.
The Zetes opened the scoring
on a pass to Rob Towner from
quarterback Steve Kistler to make
the score 6-0. Steve Longbotham
had set up the score a few minutes
before by intercepting a Frank
Duffy pass.
But the Phi Delts came right
back on a TD pass to Greg Kowal,
and an extra point to Mike Bush
put them ahead 7-6. The Phi Delt
momentum did not stop for they
then held the Zetes and went on
to score two plays later on a
40-yard pass to Hi Lewis. Another
Bush extra point put them out in
front by a 14-6 margin.
Kistler Sharp
At this point Steve Kistler
started to zero in with his passes.
A long pass to Steve Longbotham
set the ball on the Phi Delt two
yard line, but Tom Jenks caught
Kistler behind the line on the next
play for a 13-yard loss. Kistler
rallied and found his favorite
receiver, Towner, in the endzone
for the TD. This led to halftime
score of 14-13 in favor of the Phi
Delts.
The Zetes got the ball first in
the second half and marched
down the field with key passes to
Towner, Longbotham, and the
blocking backs. Kistler finally ran
it over from the 9-yard line when
all of his receivers were covered in
the endzone to put the Zetes
ahead 18-14.
The Phi Delts then got the ball,
and Frank Duffy's first pass was
intercepted by the Zetes, but two
plays later Duffy got revenge
when he made a fantastic leaping
interception. The Phi Delts got
going again and moved right up

the field to score with key
penalties on the Zetes keeping the
drive alive. A ten-yard pass from
Duffy to Mark Tucker made the
score 20-18 with three minutes
left in the game.
With the pressure on, the Zetes
marched right back down the field
with three passes to Lonubotham
getting most of the yardage. Then
Towner caught his third TD pass
of the day to put the Zetes out in
front 24-20. Longbotham made a
diving catch for the extra point to
make the score 25-20 with 37
seconds left.
Todd Peterson intercepted a
Phi Delt pass two plays later to
put the game out of reach for the
Phi Delts. Both teams played
exceedingly well, and it's too bad
one had to lose.
Cal Game
The Zetes had a little more
trouble Saturday when they
played Psi Upsilon, Cal's IM
champion. The problem was not
that the Psi U's were really great,
but that the Zetes weren't quite
physically up for the
game—something new for them.
They had been celebrating the
whole night before, out at the
Rat's and the Goose, and
"Hangover Harsssment" was the
Zetes biggest opposition. The
whole team was up for the game,
not in spirit but on Alka-Seltzer.
Probably the most affected was
Steve Kistler, the Zete
quarterback. Because of superior
blocking all season, he had never
been dumped for a loss in a
football game, but the night
before he had been dumped for a
gigantic loss when he turned over
his cycle.
Playing under extreme
handicaps to both mind and body
(the rest of the team just had
mind handicaps), his play in he
firsthalf was somewhat spotty.
Another handicap was that the
Zetes were used to playing in rags,
but on Saturday they wore old
Stanford football jersies to tell
them from the Psi U's who played
in their torn shirts and rags.
Problems
Steve had problems telling his
teamamtes for his mind was still
in Friday's world, and twice he
spotted a free man in the endzone
in a ragged uniform and passed to

him, not remembering that the
guy was on the other team.
He did complete a few
though one being a long bomb to
Longbotham for a score. The
score at the half was 7-6, the
Zetes behind.
In he second half, the Zetes
replaced Kistler with Marshall
Goldberg, the house RA, who had
quarterbacked the Second Year
Law team, and he was their
answer. He moved the ball well he
first time they had the ball.
Corner Pass
A 30-yard pass to blocking
back Tom Hornbeak put the hall
inside the 20, and a Goldberg run
set the ball ont he 7-yard line.
Then, after three plays failed to
gain any yardage, Goldberg hit
Rob Towner on a perfect pass in
the corner on the endzone for the
TD. What a key fourth down play!
