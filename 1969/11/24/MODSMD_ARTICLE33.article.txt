# Stanford Prevails By A Point
## 
### FRED LEESON 
The great American spectacle,
of sorts, visited Stanford Saturday
afternoon.
Everything was there: warm
sun, blue (if somewhat hazy) sky,
big crowd, traditional college
football rivalry, underdog-versus
heavy favorite and carefree
students out for a good time.
When it was over, the heavy
favorite had flashed its marvelous
powers and the underdog had
fought back gallantly in its own
honor, losing by a point, 29-28.
And those who came to do so
succeeded in getting uproariously
drunk.
Both sides were able to leave
relatively happy— California had
won the "moral victory" (to
borrow from Don Parish) by
almost upsetting the Stanfords
who had been favored by 14, and
the Indians, with their fill of
moral victories already, had the
pleasure of winning by a point for
a change.
Not Great
It certainly wasn't one of "the
greatest Big Games of all time" as
some of the alums declared
afterward —not with five fumbles
lost and four pass
interceptions—but it was exciting
in its own sloppy way.
With less than five minutes
gone, Stanford was ahead 14 zip
on 47 and 72 yard scoring bombs
from .Jim Plunkett to Howie
Williams and Jack Lasater, and the
defense had snagged its first of
four fumbles.
When Horowitz drilled his first
of three field goals midway in he
first period making it 17-0, it
appeared that the Indians would
easily annihilate Cal, and already a
few rooters were sufficiently
inebriated that they had to be
told the score; which team was
ahead,too.
But Cal struggled back, with
Dave Penhall persistently riddling
the Tribe pass defense, and in
doing so taking "Back of the
Game" honors (23 of 36 for 321
yards).
Plunkett, incidently, set league
records of 4829 career passing
yards and 19 pass completions in
a season as he hit 22 of 42 passes
for 381 yards.
Rout Gone
By the middle of the second
period it was 17-14, and another
Horowitz goal at the buzzer made
it 20-14. The supposed rout had
dissipated.
Until the last half of the fourth
quarter, Horowitz was the only
offensive punch Stanford could
muster in the second half. His
25-yarder three minutes into the
final period upped the Tribe lead
to 23-14.
But Penhall led Cal on two
drives in less than four minutes,
Gary Fowler capping the first
with a four yard run, and Penhall

fumbling into the endzone but
hanging on for the second and lo!
Cal was ahead 28-23.
Plunkett then methodically led
Stanford back to he lead, moving
the club 80 yards, mostly on he
ground; Bubba Brown (97 yards
20 carries) went from the Bear 11
to the four and Howie Williams
scored from there.
Conversion Fails
A two point conversion which
would have made a possible Cal
field goal salvage a tie didn't
work, and the Tribe had a 29-28
lead to protect with four minutes
left.
And the pass defense that had
been permeable all afternoon
suddenly wasn't; and Bob
Reinhard's last collegiate punt
with 48 seconds left from his own
endzone blasted the Bears out of
field goal range.
The game was over, and Coach
John Ralston's silly prediction
about his team being a one-or-two
point favorite didn't seem quite so
silly in the end.
The band and dollies retired to
the grassy patch in front of the

Ralston was in the press box
answering questions; most of his
assistants were crowded in front
of a minute television screen
watching the Rose Bowl contest
between the southland initials,
UCLA and USC.
Forget Roses
The players seemed less
concerned with that outcome.
They were in the race once, too,
but a 7-2-1 season isn't all that
shabby and it was time to enjoy
it.
Many were accompanied on
the leisurely hike from the
stadium to dressing room by
parents, kid brothers or girl
friends; and the security cop at the
door was lenient in admitting
alleged male relatives, for
whatever reason they would want
to come in.
Parish looked happy despite a
sore ankle, and fellow co-captain
Pat Preston dressed hurriedly and
greeted friends out front.
It took Plunkett 45 minutes to
get to the showers, followed all
the way by autograph seekers and
rather obnoxious junior fans

looking for souvenirs. ("Look
Jim, 1 got a left ear pad, can 1
have the right one out of your
helmet?")
One More
Just as he got within range of
the door "'1 really have to go
now, really," he repeated politely)
there was a father with a kid
("He's been waiting all afternoon
and he'll really be let down
if . . .") and by the time that one
was signed there was another
crowd.
"Hey, careful with that thing,
it's got nails in it,"he cautioned
one happy youngster who was
waving a remnant of the goal

posts which had just been
autographed.
A few more programs, a felt
hat, more goal post and the
quarterback finally made it
through the door; a middle-aged
woman turned to her husband and
said "So THAT'S Jim Plunkett,"
after sneaking timidly within ten
feet.
Some players already dressed
and others still standing in
uniform outside discussed plans
for dinner and the evening.
The mood was much more
relaxed than usual, and there was
absolutely no talk about getting
ready for next week because next
week is presently a year away.




ENOUGH—Stanford almost saw too much of Cat's Dave Penhall

Williams and Jack Lasater, and the
defense had snagged its first of
four fumbles.
When Horowitz drilled his first
of three field goals midway in he
first period making it 17-0, it
appeared that the Indians would
easily annihilate Cal, and already a
few rooters were sufficiently
inebriated that they had to be
told the score; which team was
ahead,too.
But Cal struggled back, with
Dave Penhall persistently riddling
the Tribe pass defense, and in
doing so taking "Back of the
Game" honors (23 of 36 for 321
yards).
Plunkett, incidently, set league
records of 4829 career passing
yards and 19 pass completions in
a season as he hit 22 of 42 passes
for 381 yards.
Rout Gone
By the middle of the second
period it was 17-14, and another
Horowitz goal at the buzzer made
it 20-14. The supposed rout had
dissipated.
Until the last half of the fourth
quarter, Horowitz was the only
offensive punch Stanford could
muster in the second half. His
25-yarder three minutes into the
final period upped the Tribe lead
to 23-14.
But Penhall led Cal on two
drives in less than four minutes,
Gary Fowler capping the first
with a four yard run, and Penhall

fumbling into the endzone but
hanging on for the second and lo!
Cal was ahead 28-23.
Plunkett then methodically led
Stanford back to he lead, moving
the club 80 yards, mostly on he
ground; Bubba Brown (97 yards
20 carries) went from the Bear 11
to the four and Howie Williams
scored from there.
Conversion Fails
A two point conversion which
would have made a possible Cal
field goal salvage a tie didn't
work, and the Tribe had a 29-28
lead to protect with four minutes
left.
And the pass defense that had
been permeable all afternoon
suddenly wasn't; and Bob
Reinhard's last collegiate punt
with 48 seconds left from his own
endzone blasted the Bears out of
field goal range.
The game was over, and Coach
John Ralston's silly prediction
about his team being a one-or-two
point favorite didn't seem quite so
silly in the end.
The band and dollies retired to
the grassy patch in front of the

Ralston was in the press box
answering questions; most of his
assistants were crowded in front
of a minute television screen
watching the Rose Bowl contest
between the southland initials,
UCLA and USC.
Forget Roses
The players seemed less
concerned with that outcome.
They were in the race once, too,
but a 7-2-1 season isn't all that
shabby and it was time to enjoy
it.
Many were accompanied on
the leisurely hike from the
stadium to dressing room by
parents, kid brothers or girl
friends; and the security cop at the
door was lenient in admitting
alleged male relatives, for
whatever reason they would want
to come in.
Parish looked happy despite a
sore ankle, and fellow co-captain
Pat Preston dressed hurriedly and
greeted friends out front.
It took Plunkett 45 minutes to
get to the showers, followed all
the way by autograph seekers and
rather obnoxious junior fans

looking for souvenirs. ("Look
Jim, 1 got a left ear pad, can 1
have the right one out of your
helmet?")
One More
Just as he got within range of
the door "'1 really have to go
now, really," he repeated politely)
there was a father with a kid
("He's been waiting all afternoon
and he'll really be let down
if . . .") and by the time that one
was signed there was another
crowd.
"Hey, careful with that thing,
it's got nails in it,"he cautioned
one happy youngster who was
waving a remnant of the goal

posts which had just been
autographed.
A few more programs, a felt
hat, more goal post and the
quarterback finally made it
through the door; a middle-aged
woman turned to her husband and
said "So THAT'S Jim Plunkett,"
after sneaking timidly within ten
feet.
Some players already dressed
and others still standing in
uniform outside discussed plans
for dinner and the evening.
The mood was much more
relaxed than usual, and there was
absolutely no talk about getting
ready for next week because next
week is presently a year away.

The great American spectacle,
of sorts, visited Stanford Saturday
afternoon.
Everything was there: warm
sun, blue (if somewhat hazy) sky,
big crowd, traditional college
football rivalry, underdog-versus
heavy favorite and carefree
students out for a good time.
When it was over, the heavy
favorite had flashed its marvelous
powers and the underdog had
fought back gallantly in its own
honor, losing by a point, 29-28.

succeeded in getting uproariously
drunk.
Both sides were able to leave
relatively happy— California had
won the "moral victory" (to
borrow from Don Parish) by
almost upsetting the Stanfords
who had been favored by 14, and
the Indians, with their fill of
moral victories already, had the
pleasure of winning by a point for
a change.

to 23-14.
But Penhall led Cal on two
drives in less than four minutes,
Gary Fowler capping the first
with a four yard run, and Penhall

fumbling into the endzone but
hanging on for the second and lo!
Cal was ahead 28-23.
Plunkett then methodically led
Stanford back to he lead, moving
the club 80 yards, mostly on he
ground; Bubba Brown (97 yards
20 carries) went from the Bear 11
to the four and Howie Williams
scored from there.
Conversion Fails
A two point conversion which
would have made a possible Cal
field goal salvage a tie didn't
work, and the Tribe had a 29-28
lead to protect with four minutes
left.
And the pass defense that had
been permeable all afternoon
suddenly wasn't; and Bob
Reinhard's last collegiate punt
with 48 seconds left from his own
endzone blasted the Bears out of
field goal range.
The game was over, and Coach
John Ralston's silly prediction
about his team being a one-or-two
point favorite didn't seem quite so
silly in the end.
The band and dollies retired to
the grassy patch in front of the

Ralston was in the press box
answering questions; most of his
assistants were crowded in front
of a minute television screen
watching the Rose Bowl contest
between the southland initials,
UCLA and USC.
Forget Roses
The players seemed less
concerned with that outcome.
They were in the race once, too,
but a 7-2-1 season isn't all that
shabby and it was time to enjoy
it.
Many were accompanied on
the leisurely hike from the
stadium to dressing room by
parents, kid brothers or girl
friends; and the security cop at the
door was lenient in admitting
alleged male relatives, for
whatever reason they would want
to come in.
Parish looked happy despite a
sore ankle, and fellow co-captain
Pat Preston dressed hurriedly and
greeted friends out front.
It took Plunkett 45 minutes to
get to the showers, followed all
the way by autograph seekers and
rather obnoxious junior fans

looking for souvenirs. ("Look
Jim, 1 got a left ear pad, can 1
have the right one out of your
helmet?")
One More
Just as he got within range of
the door "'1 really have to go
now, really," he repeated politely)
there was a father with a kid
("He's been waiting all afternoon
and he'll really be let down
if . . .") and by the time that one
was signed there was another
crowd.
"Hey, careful with that thing,
it's got nails in it,"he cautioned
one happy youngster who was
waving a remnant of the goal

posts which had just been
autographed.
A few more programs, a felt
hat, more goal post and the
quarterback finally made it
through the door; a middle-aged
woman turned to her husband and
said "So THAT'S Jim Plunkett,"
after sneaking timidly within ten
feet.
Some players already dressed
and others still standing in
uniform outside discussed plans
for dinner and the evening.
The mood was much more
relaxed than usual, and there was
absolutely no talk about getting
ready for next week because next
week is presently a year away.




ENOUGH—Stanford almost saw too much of Cat's Dave Penhall
(lower left) but the one point victory Saturday brought smiles to
Coach John Ralston (above) and hordes of autograph seekers (left).

The great American spectacle,
of sorts, visited Stanford Saturday
afternoon.
Everything was there: warm
sun, blue (if somewhat hazy) sky,
big crowd, traditional college
football rivalry, underdog-versus
heavy favorite and carefree
students out for a good time.
When it was over, the heavy
favorite had flashed its marvelous
powers and the underdog had
fought back gallantly in its own
honor, losing by a point, 29-28.
And those who came to do so
succeeded in getting uproariously
drunk.
Both sides were able to leave
relatively happy— California had
won the "moral victory" (to
borrow from Don Parish) by
almost upsetting the Stanfords
who had been favored by 14, and
the Indians, with their fill of
moral victories already, had the
pleasure of winning by a point for
a change.
Not Great
It certainly wasn't one of "the
greatest Big Games of all time" as
some of the alums declared
afterward —not with five fumbles
lost and four pass
interceptions—but it was exciting
in its own sloppy way.
With less than five minutes
gone, Stanford was ahead 14 zip
on 47 and 72 yard scoring bombs
from .Jim Plunkett to Howie
Williams and Jack Lasater, and the
defense had snagged its first of
four fumbles.
When Horowitz drilled his first
of three field goals midway in he
first period making it 17-0, it
appeared that the Indians would
easily annihilate Cal, and already a
few rooters were sufficiently
inebriated that they had to be
told the score; which team was
ahead,too.
But Cal struggled back, with
Dave Penhall persistently riddling
the Tribe pass defense, and in
doing so taking "Back of the
Game" honors (23 of 36 for 321
yards).
Plunkett, incidently, set league
records of 4829 career passing
yards and 19 pass completions in
a season as he hit 22 of 42 passes
for 381 yards.
Rout Gone
By the middle of the second
period it was 17-14, and another
Horowitz goal at the buzzer made
it 20-14. The supposed rout had
dissipated.
Until the last half of the fourth
quarter, Horowitz was the only
offensive punch Stanford could
muster in the second half. His
25-yarder three minutes into the
final period upped the Tribe lead
to 23-14.
