# Premier Sato Greeted With Leaflets, Parody
## 
### TINA COOPER 
As estimated 150 protestors,
including about 20 Stanford
students, demonstrated at the San
Francisco International Airport
yesterday afternoon, as Japanese
Prime Minister Sato arrived from a
week of negotiations with
President Nixon.
The young demonstrators
leafletted for an hour in the main
terminal and presented a skit
parody on American involvement
in Japan before leaving to meet
Sato's scheduled flight. They were
prevented from reaching the
Prime Minister by sheriff's
deputies while he was whisked
away in a car.
Sato was in Washington to
discuss the Japanese-American
Security Pact. Under its
provisions, the U.S. holds
Okinawa and maintains 117
military bases there. It was
announced Friday that Okinawa
would be returned to the Japanese
in 1972.
Over 700,000 radical Japanese
youths and workers clashed with
police last week in an attempt to
prevent Sato from leaving Tokyo.
They feared Japan will be
remilitarized as an ally of the U.S.
under the security pact, known
there as Ampo.
Yesterday's demonstration was
organized by the Palo Alto
Resistance. It was sparked by the
November issue of the "Plain
Rapper," the National Resistance
newspaper, which put out a
supplement on the Japanese
student movement.
The P.A. Resistance sent
leaflets to student groups at
Stanford, Berkeley and San
Francisco State, inviting them to
join the demonstration.
Leafletting
About fifty students began
leafletting in the main terminal at
about 1:00, distributing a picture
of Sato smiling. "Why is this man
smiling?" asked the caption. "He
just sold out Japan."
Individual demonstrators, some
wearing Japanese costumes or
Army helmets, filtered in to join
the group. Some brought signs in
Japanese and English, saying
"Stop Sato," and "End U.S.
Imperialism in Japan."
The protestors then massed at

one of the gates in the terminal
and began to chant "Ampo
Funsri," which translates into
"crush the security pact." They
were led by Frank Bardaeche, one
of the leading participants in the
People's Park movement.
Mime Troupe
The San Francisco Gorilla
Mime Troupe then staged a satire
on American involvement in
Japan since World War 11, called
"The House of the Rising Sun."
The ten-minute parody attracted
about 200 spectators.
Demonstrators then marched
100 yards to the entrance to the
Pan American area when Sato's
plane pulled up, but offered no
resistance when a half dozen
deputies said they could go no
farther. Sato did not see the
demonstrators.
The students then left on a
march to the Prime Minister's
press conference in San Francisco,
which they planned to picket.
Chanting "Ampo Funsri" and
waving their signs, they were led
by the colorfully dressed Mime
Troupe Gorilla Band, which
drummed out the beat for the
march.
Gesture of Solidarity
When asked the reason for the
demonstration, one member of

the Palo Alto Resistance said, "It
was really a gesture of solidarity
with the Japanese students. We
contacted some other groups, and
they agreed that the time to
demonstrate was now."
"There were no real leaders,"
said a student from Berkeley. "We
had all been following the news
from Japan, and we knew to come
out here when Sato arrived. The
thing just coalesced."
"We're just letting Sato know
that there are people all over the
world who'll fight against
militarism and imperialism,"
added another girl. "We don't like
our having Okinawa any more
than the Japanese students do. It's
just being used as a base to bomb
Vietnam."
Another youth took a blunter
attitude. "This is a chance to drop
all that apathetic unbiased bull
and come out for what you really
believe. I believe in peace. What
do you believe in, anyway?"
About twenty Stanford
students, mostly from the SDS,
took part in the demonstration.
Other groups who sent people to
the Airport included the
Committee of Concerned Asian
Scholars, Radical Student Union,
and Asian-American Peace
Alliance.
