# Nixon, Sato Agree

WASHINGTON (AP)--President
Nixon agreed Friday to turn
Okinawa back to Japan in 1972,
and without nuclear weapons.
Prime Minister Eisaku Sato,
successfully achieving a Japanese
political goal striven for since the
end of World War 11, reaffirmed
the need for continuous United
States military use of bases on
Okinawa and throughout Japan
for the security of the Far East.
He left the way open for the
use of nuclear weapons through
consultation if Japan's security is
threatened.

And Sato appeared to broaden
the area affecting Japan's security
to include the whole Far East.
Sato said that if an armed
attack against South Korea
occurred, it would seriously affect
Japan's security, and he gave
specific assurances that the
Japanese government could make
available its facilities and areas as
bases for military combat
operations to meet the attack.
Details remain to be
negotiated, including economic
problems affecting U.S. business
interests in Okinawa. The
Japanese Diet must approve the
agreement.
