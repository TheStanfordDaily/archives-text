## Committee Visits Plant 
### 
A new method of rubbish
disposal so fascinated the
Assembly Committee on Natural
Resources and Conservation that
they took Friday afternoon to
visit it in Los Gatos.
Their adjournment closed one
and a half days of testimony here
on the best methods of coping
with California's ever increasing
mountain of trash, or "solid waste
management" as the committee
termed it.
The committee, headed by
Assemblyman George W. Milias
(R-Gilroy), found much favor
with testimony from Gianni
Siracusa of Los Gatos during the
morning session.
Siracusa, who heads the Sira
Corporation, told the committee
that with the help of the Food
Machinery Corp of San Jose he
has developed a waste disposer
that reduces everything in waste
matter to a heap of molten
slag—with the exception of tin
cans, which are separated.
The Los Gatos plant, which is
already in business hauling 250
tons of trash per day from the
Green Valley Disposal Co. and
others from satellite cities. The
process consumes everything in a
furnace heated to 2900 degrees.
The reduction is to one percent

by volume and to eight percent by
weight.
Sterile Material
Siracusa, in a colorful
presentation, warned the
assemblymen that they were only
getting part of the story from the
more than 30 persons invited to
testify.
"You hear a lot about sanitary
land fill," he said, "but it creates
methane gas from rotting
material—very explosive. And if
you build a park on top of it and
then water the lawn, you
contaminate the water table
undernearth."
"This material," he said,
holding up a heavy piece of the
slag mounted on a block of wood,
"is absolutely sterile. It will
contaminate nothing. You can

grind it up and mix it with asphalt
or cement for paving or you can
use the ground-up material itself
for fill. You can take it out and
dump it in the ocean and it will
not poison anything."
Handles Everything
The residue from the furnace
stack meets all present and future
requirements of air pollution
control laws, Siracusa added. The
automatic disposer, operated by
only four men, will handle
everything including manure,
industrial and toxic waste,
cannery residue and even sewage
sludge, he asserted.
The cost of operation is $5.50
per ton, he said, "but this will go
down if the city of San Jose
comes in," which he indicated is
under consideration.

others from satellite cities. The
process consumes everything in a
furnace heated to 2900 degrees.
The reduction is to one percent

by volume and to eight percent by
weight.
Sterile Material
Siracusa, in a colorful
presentation, warned the
assemblymen that they were only
getting part of the story from the
more than 30 persons invited to
testify.
"You hear a lot about sanitary
land fill," he said, "but it creates
methane gas from rotting
material—very explosive. And if
you build a park on top of it and
then water the lawn, you
contaminate the water table
undernearth."
"This material," he said,
holding up a heavy piece of the
slag mounted on a block of wood,
"is absolutely sterile. It will
contaminate nothing. You can

grind it up and mix it with asphalt
or cement for paving or you can
use the ground-up material itself
for fill. You can take it out and
dump it in the ocean and it will
not poison anything."
Handles Everything
The residue from the furnace
stack meets all present and future
requirements of air pollution
control laws, Siracusa added. The
automatic disposer, operated by
only four men, will handle
everything including manure,
industrial and toxic waste,
cannery residue and even sewage
sludge, he asserted.
The cost of operation is $5.50
per ton, he said, "but this will go
down if the city of San Jose
comes in," which he indicated is
under consideration.

A new method of rubbish
disposal so fascinated the
Assembly Committee on Natural
Resources and Conservation that
they took Friday afternoon to
visit it in Los Gatos.
Their adjournment closed one
and a half days of testimony here
on the best methods of coping
with California's ever increasing
mountain of trash, or "solid waste
management" as the committee
termed it.
The committee, headed by
Assemblyman George W. Milias
(R-Gilroy), found much favor
with testimony from Gianni
Siracusa of Los Gatos during the
morning session.
Siracusa, who heads the Sira
Corporation, told the committee
that with the help of the Food
Machinery Corp of San Jose he
has developed a waste disposer
that reduces everything in waste
matter to a heap of molten
slag—with the exception of tin
cans, which are separated.
The Los Gatos plant, which is
already in business hauling 250
tons of trash per day from the
Green Valley Disposal Co. and
others from satellite cities. The
process consumes everything in a
furnace heated to 2900 degrees.
The reduction is to one percent

by volume and to eight percent by
weight.
