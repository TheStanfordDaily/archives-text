# Students Document Racism In America
## 
### 
Eight Stanford students have
just published a study on racism
in America and ways to alleviate
it.
Most of the contributors to
''Institutional Racism in
America," have graduated and are
serving in public-service jobs,
according to Owen Blank, a senior
who was one of the authors.
The book urges more black
self-determination, citing East
Palo Alto as an example.
The contributors declare in the
foreward: "In this book we
present the proofs of our
'intellectual revolt,' our struggle
to define racism, not as Negro
pathology, but as white and
institutional and all too
American."
Blacks are hemmed in by a wob
of socio-economic and political
institutions which are inherently
racist, the authors believe.
Personal Involvement
The researchers, according to
Blank, soon found that they "had
to get involved with the real
world" rather than just do
v o 1 u m in o us research in the
University's libraries.
So they used Stanford and
other Bay Area universities as
resource centers and entered such
activities as working at
Community House, attending

school board meetings, assisting
on pickct lines, attending seminars
and political meetings.
Editors were Louis Knowles,
now a graduate student in the
University of Chicago divinity
school, and Kenneth Prewitt,
former Stanford visiting assistant
professor of political science, who
has returned to the University of
Chicago.
Of the other contributors, Sue
Haley is now a senior at Stanford;
James Davis won an M.D. and is
now with the U.S. Public Health
Service in Washington; Jacquelyn
G. Drews is a graduate student in
the Reed College teacher intern
program; her husband, Paul, is
taking a sabbatical; Andrew
Horowitz has served with the
Teacher Corps; Sue Mithune
Duncan is with VISTA; and Peter
Ware, former graduate business
student, is staff assistant to
Community House in East Palo
Alto.
The book includes a four-page
summary of suggestions on how
the interested layman can help
work against racism in his own
community. It is published in the
Prentice-Hall "Spectrum" series.
Profits from its sale will be turned
over to the organizations which
fight racism.
