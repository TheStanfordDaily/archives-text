# Message From A Black Man
## Down On The Farm 
### Robert Walker 
After only seven weeks on this
fertile farm land, known as
Stanford University to many
people, I have reached some very
disturbing tentative conclusions. I
feel a need to share these
conclusions with those who are
interested, in hopes that the
sharing of these conclusions
(maybe the attitudes too).
The conclusions are as follows:
A very high percentage (based on
a non-scientifically
structure sample) of Stanford's
racial majority conveys a great
deal of phoney snobbery; petty
bourgeois attitudes and behavior;
condescending behavior; and a
general bigoted and racist feeling.
It is my feeling that these
students who fit my descriptions
are mostly unaware of how
obvious their behavior is. They
probably have had very little early
life training and experience in
relating to individuals outside of
their immediate homogeneous
group on an equal basis.
Some of these bastards know
what they are doing and they do
it out of a sense of security
knowing that the establishment is
run by the very people who
taught them their ways. I should
like to caution these people that
things are changing and they
ought to reappraise their sense of
security. It may be false.
Attitudes Expressed
There are many ways through
which the attitudes and feelings in
question are expressed. They
include: exclusion; jokes and
joking appropriately;
inappropriate responses (smiling
at everything); questions without
meaning; superficial identification
(man I really dig . . . what's that
guy's name . . . He's
blind . . . plays piano etc.).
I should like to offer a two
dimensional partial remedy to this
problem. Long range plans will
include my attempts to write and
publish a textbook and hopefully
a course for majority group
members on "How to Relate to
North American Members of the
Black Culture."
Until such a book is produced,
I suggest that the guilty parties,
friends and foes (you are
indistinguishable at this level),
cease and desist from joking with
and/or about Black people. Stop
pretending at any level with
Blacks. When you don't
understand something that seems
peculiar to Blacks, ask a Black
observed doing it. Don't ask your
friend. He doesn't know either
and will only give you
misinformation. Listen to the
Black and accord him the same
respect that you would anyone
else. Above all, DON'T ever
assume that the Black should be
very glad to be integrated or that
he is a special kind of Black
because he is at Stanford.
Alienation
Such behavior as I have
observed at Stanford has forced
many Blacks to turn away from
the racial majority world. They
were disgusted; afraid; alientated;
angry; hurt; and sick to their
stomachs. They were, in fact,
forced to cop out. Well Blacks
aren't copping out anymore. We
have decided to make a stand.
Something has to give and Blacks
can't give.
Some racial majority members
are on a direct collision course
with the too long frustrated hopes
and dreams of Blacks. At this
writing, I am suggesting that the
guilty racial majority adjust their
course.
This university sits on what
was probably once a beautiful
uncluttered patch of farm land. It
might be appropriate to return
this campus to its previous state.
Two Alternatives
If given a choice between
alternatives: (1) running an

institution for all of the people,
and (2) returning the university to
barren land for farming, I am not
sure what the Stanford's would
choose. In their absence, the
question is up to you . . . WHITE
MAN. You need only respond to
the first alternative because your
response to that alternative will
ultimately dictate whether or not

the second alternative will be
invoked.
I hope that you will not get up
tight about this article—unless you
are guilty. Try and dig it if you
can.

interested, in hopes that the
sharing of these conclusions
(maybe the attitudes too).
The conclusions are as follows:
A very high percentage (based on
a non-scientifically
structure sample) of Stanford's
racial majority conveys a great
deal of phoney snobbery; petty
bourgeois attitudes and behavior;
condescending behavior; and a
general bigoted and racist feeling.
It is my feeling that these
students who fit my descriptions
are mostly unaware of how
obvious their behavior is. They
probably have had very little early
life training and experience in
relating to individuals outside of
their immediate homogeneous
group on an equal basis.
Some of these bastards know
what they are doing and they do
it out of a sense of security
knowing that the establishment is
run by the very people who
taught them their ways. I should
like to caution these people that
things are changing and they
ought to reappraise their sense of
security. It may be false.
Attitudes Expressed
There are many ways through
which the attitudes and feelings in
question are expressed. They
include: exclusion; jokes and
joking appropriately;
inappropriate responses (smiling
at everything); questions without
meaning; superficial identification
(man I really dig . . . what's that
guy's name . . . He's
blind . . . plays piano etc.).
I should like to offer a two
dimensional partial remedy to this
problem. Long range plans will
include my attempts to write and
publish a textbook and hopefully
a course for majority group
members on "How to Relate to
North American Members of the
Black Culture."
Until such a book is produced,
I suggest that the guilty parties,
friends and foes (you are
indistinguishable at this level),
cease and desist from joking with
and/or about Black people. Stop
pretending at any level with
Blacks. When you don't
understand something that seems
peculiar to Blacks, ask a Black
observed doing it. Don't ask your
friend. He doesn't know either
and will only give you
misinformation. Listen to the
Black and accord him the same
respect that you would anyone
else. Above all, DON'T ever
assume that the Black should be
very glad to be integrated or that
he is a special kind of Black
because he is at Stanford.
Alienation
Such behavior as I have
observed at Stanford has forced
many Blacks to turn away from
the racial majority world. They
were disgusted; afraid; alientated;
angry; hurt; and sick to their
stomachs. They were, in fact,
forced to cop out. Well Blacks
aren't copping out anymore. We
have decided to make a stand.
Something has to give and Blacks
can't give.
Some racial majority members
are on a direct collision course
with the too long frustrated hopes
and dreams of Blacks. At this
writing, I am suggesting that the
guilty racial majority adjust their
course.
This university sits on what
was probably once a beautiful
uncluttered patch of farm land. It
might be appropriate to return
this campus to its previous state.
Two Alternatives
If given a choice between
alternatives: (1) running an

institution for all of the people,
and (2) returning the university to
barren land for farming, I am not
sure what the Stanford's would
choose. In their absence, the
question is up to you . . . WHITE
MAN. You need only respond to
the first alternative because your
response to that alternative will
ultimately dictate whether or not

the second alternative will be
invoked.
I hope that you will not get up
tight about this article—unless you
are guilty. Try and dig it if you
can.
