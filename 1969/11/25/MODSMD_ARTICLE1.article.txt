# New Dean Seeks Diversity
## Admissions: Time For Experiments 
### FRANK MILLER 
The new Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions
criticized in a recent interview the
SES (Study of Education at
Stanford) report on
undergraduate admissions as,
"perhaps too many conclusions
drawn from too little data."
Dean Fred Hargadon, having
inherited the SES report which
was released last December, sees
the report as a useful catalyst to a
new and better admissions policy.
However, he feels that there are
definite faults within the report.
No formal action has yet been
taken in the report.
He criticized the report for "a
certain naivete that one can
manipulate the applicant pool in
one year." The report emphasizes
the importance of diversity and
creativity within the Stanford
student body. It seeks to diversify
the Stanford applicants so that
the type of desired student can be
changed from year to year.
Hargadon feels that this cannot be
done easily and that SES only
cites one example to prove that it
can be done.
Much has been written about
admissions procedures in the past
few years which Hargadon feels
was overlooked by the SES
subcommittee. He cites as an
example the fact that most
admissions officers have not
talked about the well-rounded
versus the single characteristic
student for over five years. They
feel the terms are outdated with
recent studies. SES, however,
deals with these terms.
Diversity Not Simple
But Hargadon does feel that
the far-reaching SES
recommendations have much
merit. He agrees that there are too
many students from one
socio-economic group at Stanford.
Diversity should be sought but it
is not as simple as SES indicates.
"The problem is one of what is
diversity. It must be wrestled
with ..." continues Hargadon.
SES has not defined what it
means by this. "Diversity in terms
of past academic achievement is
perhaps the most important," but
the report did not emphasize this
aspect. People usually fall back on
the traditional definitions of

diversity—socio-economic groups,
religions, race, etc.
Hargadon has reservations
about the desired diversity and
creativity. "An academic
institution is not always the best
place for a truly creative person,"
he observed. And there is no
guarantee that this diversity will
rub off on students here.
Hargadon emphasized that he
does not necessarily disagree with
the conclusions of the SES report
but rather feels that more research
should be done on their
suggestions.
Certain Image
After spending six years in
admissions at Swarthmore
College, he feels that no matter
what an admissions officer does a
university will still be turning
people down and these people will
find reasons why the university
did so. And these same people will
project a certain image of the
school's admission policies,
whether they are right or wrong.
Furthermore, any given
selection procedure can be
manipulated by the
lot of students will model
themselves" after what they
believe is wanted by the university
just to get into that school.
Dean Hargadon's views on
entering freshmen differ
somewhat from those commonly
held. "I will try and persuade the
University and the constituent
parts to look upon the freshman
class rather as raw material than a
finished product." He thinks more
research should be done on how
well a student develops once he
comes to Stanford.
Option to Applicants
Concern for the student
dominates Hargadon's thoughts
and actions. He thinks that
admissions officers should be
working as much on behalf of the
students as on behalf of the
University. Their real concern
should be offering Stanford as an
option to perspective applicants.
They should offer a "fair and
complete picture of what is
available at Stanford. Admissions'
officers obviously recruit . . . but
there is a line beyond which you
don't go."
Although Dean Hargadon's
first weeks at Stanford, (he
officially became Dean of

Admissions October 1) have been
largely an orientation period, he
already has certain feelings about
changes he would like to see in
admissions policies. "I would like
to see a greater socio-economic
spread with regard to family
groups." He realizes that this is an
expensive university and that
scholarship funds are short but he
does not want to see Stanford
limited to upper-class students
and minority students who use
the limited financial support.
Other economic classes must be
integrated within the University.
He also would like a broader
representation of academic ability
at Stanford. Perhaps, he thinks,
that with Stanford's excellent
caliber of faculty, the faculty
could actually do better with a
more academically diverse student
body. He offered the interesting
question of what would happen if
Stanford's faculty spent a year at
a so-called second rate college. He

wonders how much the students
would learn.
"It is unnatural to spend from
age 6 to 26 in academic pursuits,"
continued Hargadon in explaining
his idea of delayed admissions. He
would like approximately 100
students admitted to Stanford and
then allowed to work for a year or
two before they actually attend
the University. At the same time,
he would like to see more
students finish earlier than the
normal four years through
four-quarter schooling and more
liberal advanced placement
procedures.
Hargadon fears the tendency to
simplify and objectify admissions
processes so they can be easily
applied and defended. "A sound
admissions policy resists this and
deals with all kinds of intangibles
no matter how difficult they are
to measure. There have to be
gambles and there are inevitably
mistakes" in admissions policies.
But he is not afraid of fighting

for a good admissions
policy—even if it is somewhat
subjective. "I really don't mind
running for re-election each year,"
he joked. He feels that the
admissions director that pleases all
of his constituents all of the time
is doing a poor job and that the
one who is offending all of them
some of the time is more likely to
be doing a good job.
Student Help
Hargadon regrets the difficulty
he feels there exists at Stanford in
getting to know the students he
admits. He wants to find out how
students feel about different
things and to use them to evalute
the admissions policies
He also feels that the
admissions personnel should play
a larger part in the general
operation of the university. With
their unique position of dealing
with all students, they can offer a
tremendous service to such
University officials as the Dean of
Students.

QUALITY CONTROL—Fred Hargadon, new director of Admissions
feels, "An academic institution is not always the best place for a truly
creative person." He also commented that the University should be
ready to take more risks in admitting students. "There have to be
gambles, "says Hargadon.
