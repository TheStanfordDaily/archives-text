Hate Understands
Editor, THE DAILY:
In connection with Mr.
Wheeler's article in THE DAILY,
Nov. 20, 1969, ("Verbal

Garbage . . .Adjectival Ranting"),
we would agree that "Our duty
must be to preserve our
rights . . But the question is
how? To successfully preserve our
rights, we have to recognize when

these rights are threatened. We
maintain when any of our rights
are threatened, all of our rights
are threatened. For example,
Bobby Seale's treatment in
Chicago.
Before "setting pen to paper"
about growing fascism in the U.S.
some of us have discussed
"Hungary with Hungarian
refugees, East Germany with East
German refugees, and Cuba with
Cuban refugees," in addition to
Poland with Polish refugees and
Russia with Russian refugees, as
well as having read. DR.
ZHIVAGO (twice). What was
learned from these individuals was
there was a variety of reasons for
having left one's homeland; in
some instances, it was simply that
a man wished to get away from
his wife or look for employment
elsewhere.
Mr. Wheeler closes by calling
upon us to rid our dissent and
discussion of "garbage." He
suggests we begin by
"concentrating on similarities as
well as differences, seeking to
understand and build rather than
hating and destroying." We would
like to point out that is precisely
our "concentrating on
similarities" (i.e. between fascism
and contemporary America) that
aroused Mr. Wheeler's ire in the
first place. As to the rest,
understanding and hating,
building and destroying are not
mutually exclusive processes.
Some things are not really
understood unless they are hated.
A.-d the building of anything is
obviously the destruction of its
opposite.
If Mr. Wheeler desires a better
understanding of all this, he is
invited to come hear "Masai"
Hewitt of the Black Panther Party
and Father Eugene Boyle of
Sacred Heart Church, tonight at 8
in the Tresidder Large Lounge.

Approves Recommendation
Editor, THE DAILY:
We strongly approve of the
administration's recent
recommendations in response to
the teachings of the Mormon
Church. We similarly think it
appropriate that the university
extend these guidelines to
encompass any relations we might
have with Catholic-sponsored
schools, due to the anti-human
position that church has taken on
birth control. Racism and
overpopulation can only hasten
the world's destruction. It is time
for private institutions to move to
eliminate such forces in America.

We strongly approve of the
administration's recent
recommendations in response to
the teachings of the Mormon
Church. We similarly think it
appropriate that the university
extend these guidelines to
encompass any relations we might
have with Catholic-sponsored
schools, due to the anti-human
position that church has taken on
birth control. Racism and
overpopulation can only hasten
the world's destruction. It is time
for private institutions to move to
eliminate such forces in America.

Hate Understands
Editor, THE DAILY:
In connection with Mr.
Wheeler's article in THE DAILY,
Nov. 20, 1969, ("Verbal

Garbage . . .Adjectival Ranting"),
we would agree that "Our duty
must be to preserve our
rights . . But the question is
how? To successfully preserve our
rights, we have to recognize when

these rights are threatened. We
maintain when any of our rights
are threatened, all of our rights
are threatened. For example,
Bobby Seale's treatment in
Chicago.
Before "setting pen to paper"
about growing fascism in the U.S.
some of us have discussed
"Hungary with Hungarian
refugees, East Germany with East
German refugees, and Cuba with
Cuban refugees," in addition to
Poland with Polish refugees and
Russia with Russian refugees, as
well as having read. DR.
ZHIVAGO (twice). What was
learned from these individuals was
there was a variety of reasons for
having left one's homeland; in
some instances, it was simply that
a man wished to get away from
his wife or look for employment
elsewhere.
Mr. Wheeler closes by calling
upon us to rid our dissent and
discussion of "garbage." He
suggests we begin by
"concentrating on similarities as
well as differences, seeking to
understand and build rather than
hating and destroying." We would
like to point out that is precisely
our "concentrating on
similarities" (i.e. between fascism
and contemporary America) that
aroused Mr. Wheeler's ire in the
first place. As to the rest,
understanding and hating,
building and destroying are not
mutually exclusive processes.
Some things are not really
understood unless they are hated.
A.-d the building of anything is
obviously the destruction of its
opposite.
If Mr. Wheeler desires a better
understanding of all this, he is
invited to come hear "Masai"
Hewitt of the Black Panther Party
and Father Eugene Boyle of
Sacred Heart Church, tonight at 8
in the Tresidder Large Lounge.
