# BSU Campaign
## The 						Politics of Fear 
### Chris Hocker 
The politics of fear. Such is the
system through which much of
the ASSU Senate was elected. And
this same system has effectively
covered up its leavings through
such instruments as the Stanford
DAILY.
The campaign run by the BSU,
as has been pointed out only once
in public, was very simply: If you
elect us, there will be no trouble
on this campus, and if you don't,
there will be. So that if the Senate
is indeed representative of those
who cared enough to vote, it is
representative of many who cared
enough not to vote for a single
winning senator, and it is repre
sentative of those who responded
to the BSU threat under the guise
of humanitarian liberalism ("I
think we should have some of
them in.")
But the election is past. Fear or
no fear, the BSU candidates are in
office and I for one congratulate
them on their political ability and
their knowldge of campus feelings
that allowed them to win.
And I further congratulate their
president, Mr. Bazile, on his
perceptiveness and his awareness
that he can make almost any
statement without fear of opposi
tion, because all us Stanford
students have reflected on his
ideas and single-mindedly come to
the conclusion that, sure enough,
he speaks for us on every issue.
And if he doesn't, he is at least
exercising his right of free speech.
And if one contradicts him, one is
a racist.
Bazile Reworded
Mr. Bazile said a few things on
November 13 about the ARENA
and the FCM. Let's play a petty
intellectual game and imagine, just
imagine, what would happen if
some things Mr. Bazile said were
reworded slightly:
"I have had it with the bastard
children of Spiro Agnew and
Adolph (sic) Hitler who scribble
in the ARENA and other places
when they are not writing on
bathroom walls." Imagine some
one writing, "I have had it with
the bastard children of Edward

Brooke and Francois Duvalier
who scribble on the COLONIST
and other places when they are
not writing on he bathroom
walls."
Or imagine someone calling the
COLONIST a "weekly shit sheet"
as Mr. Bazile saw fit to label the
ARENA. Or conjure up the idea
of anyone calling the BSU "Leo
and his underlings," instead of
calling the FCM "Harvey and his
underlings" as Mr. Bazile did.
Such things are hard to ima
gine, right? I mean, these state
ments are irresponsible, racist,
illogical, unsubstantiated, and lud
icrous.
Based on Fear
As long as they are directed at
those who have the balance of
power, power based on fear. When
they reverse direction, they are
supported, conveniently ignored,
covered up, and apologized for.
Because, after all, were not their
ancestors slaves? What better
reason to call the ARENA a
"weekly shit sheet."?

Why should the BSU seek to
polarize this campus, as they
righteously deny wanting to do, as
long as they hold the vast
majority of students either
supporting them, fearing them, or
apathetically ignoring them and
everyone else?
I repeat, as a political move, the
Machiavellian machinations of the
BSU are superb, and if I were a
disinterested observer, I would
applaud them as I would any
other well-thought-out tactical
maneuver.
However, disinterested I am
not, not with several years of
Stanford ahead of me, assuming
the multi-racial character of the
university is kept, and I do not
choose to be smothered in any
blanket of fear thrown by any
group, BSU or FCM or DAR.
Therefore, if dissension is polar
ization, and speaking out is
throwing down the gauntlet, I
indeed echo Right On!
