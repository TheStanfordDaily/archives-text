# Alcatraz Dispute
## MECHA Supports Indians 
### SUSAN MAAS 
MECHA, the Mexican-
American Student Association,
expressed support for the
American Indians on Alcatraz
Island in a rally in White Plaza
yesterday.
About thirty students gathered
at the Plaza to hear the speeches
by Stanford MECHA members
while a number of others listened
from more comfortable seats on
the grass nearby.
"The Indians happen to be the
most civilized people I know,"
Gary Cavazos declared in the
opening remarks. He said that the
Indians only wanted to claim their
land, but the government didn't
take kindly to that.
MECHA sympathizes with the
position of the American Indian
because it considers itself an
Indian movement, and has shared
many of the problems which have
plagued the American Indians.
"Chicanos are the bastards of
imperialism," stated Jose Perales.
"People say we're misfits. But
we're Indians."
Money for Indians
To show its support, MECHA
is raising money for the Indians
and has sent a telegram to Wlater
Hickel, Secretary of the Interior.
The telegram states, "We the
Chicano students at Stanford
University and members of the
Movmento Estudiantil Chicano de

Aztlan (MECHA) hereby support
and stand in solidarity with the
American Indians who are now
reclaiming the Island of Alcatraz."
It continues, "We have had the
painful experience of losing more
than half of Mexico to the United
States and know the pains and
anguish of being shoved into the
'reservations' of the barrio and the
fields of the Southwest."
"Until that time as we begin to
reclaim our own land," concludes
the message, "we demand that the
Island of Alcatraz be returned to
its rightful owners."
Symbolic Value
"We are concerned with the
immense symbolic value of what
they're trying to do," said Carl
Vasquez. He stressed that Indians
and Chicanos don't see land in
terms of acres or cash value. "We
come from the land, we are part
of the land," he declared.
Dr. Thomas Martinez, Director
of Mexican-American seminars
and sociology lecturer, also spoke
of the feeling of the Indians for
the land. "The Indians were and
are the foremost conservationists
in this country," he said. "They
believe in oneness with nature,
and we are here today to express
our oneness with this people."
"Today only 650,000 Indians
live in the land which once
supported 26 million Indians," he
continued. "Today suicide is the
major form of death among

teenage Indians. Their average life
span is 42-46 years."
Farm Workers
Jose Perales linked the causes
of Chicanos and Indians, saying,
"The farm workers rate with the
Indians in the Tightness of their
cause."

He added that MECHA is
working on a Christmas Caravan
to Delano to take money and dry
goods to the farm workers, who
have no means of support during
the winter.
Besides these projects, MECHA
is working on a newspaper, and
making plans to develop a
Chicano Studies Center, and to
hold a Chicano Culture Week
sometime during winter quarter.
Culture Week
Planned for mid-winter,
Chicano Culture Week will feature
speakers, Mexican food and
music, and various other activities.
Its purpose is to educate the
Anglo community and to enable
Chicano students to maintain
close ties with their culture.
A committee is beginning work
on the idea of a Chicano Studies
Center, to include research,
community service, and
curriculum components, but plans
are still indefinite.

reclaim our own land," concludes
the message, "we demand that the
Island of Alcatraz be returned to
its rightful owners."
Symbolic Value
"We are concerned with the
immense symbolic value of what
they're trying to do," said Carl
Vasquez. He stressed that Indians
and Chicanos don't see land in
terms of acres or cash value. "We
come from the land, we are part
of the land," he declared.
Dr. Thomas Martinez, Director
of Mexican-American seminars
and sociology lecturer, also spoke
of the feeling of the Indians for
the land. "The Indians were and
are the foremost conservationists
in this country," he said. "They
believe in oneness with nature,
and we are here today to express
our oneness with this people."
"Today only 650,000 Indians
live in the land which once
supported 26 million Indians," he
continued. "Today suicide is the
major form of death among

teenage Indians. Their average life
span is 42-46 years."
Farm Workers
Jose Perales linked the causes
of Chicanos and Indians, saying,
"The farm workers rate with the
Indians in the Tightness of their
cause."

He added that MECHA is
working on a Christmas Caravan
to Delano to take money and dry
goods to the farm workers, who
have no means of support during
the winter.
Besides these projects, MECHA
is working on a newspaper, and
making plans to develop a
Chicano Studies Center, and to
hold a Chicano Culture Week
sometime during winter quarter.
Culture Week
Planned for mid-winter,
Chicano Culture Week will feature
speakers, Mexican food and
music, and various other activities.
Its purpose is to educate the
Anglo community and to enable
Chicano students to maintain
close ties with their culture.
A committee is beginning work
on the idea of a Chicano Studies
Center, to include research,
community service, and
curriculum components, but plans
are still indefinite.

INDIANS SI!—Yesterday in White Plaza, the Mexican-American
student organization (MECHA) announced its support of Indian
claims to Alcatraz. The Stanford group telegrammed its position to
Secretary of Interior Walter Hickel.
MECHA, the Mexican-
American Student Association,
expressed support for the
American Indians on Alcatraz
Island in a rally in White Plaza
yesterday.
About thirty students gathered
at the Plaza to hear the speeches
by Stanford MECHA members
while a number of others listened
from more comfortable seats on
the grass nearby.
"The Indians happen to be the
most civilized people I know,"
Gary Cavazos declared in the
opening remarks. He said that the
Indians only wanted to claim their
land, but the government didn't
take kindly to that.
MECHA sympathizes with the
position of the American Indian
because it considers itself an
Indian movement, and has shared
many of the problems which have
plagued the American Indians.
"Chicanos are the bastards of
imperialism," stated Jose Perales.
"People say we're misfits. But
we're Indians."
Money for Indians
To show its support, MECHA
is raising money for the Indians
and has sent a telegram to Wlater
Hickel, Secretary of the Interior.
The telegram states, "We the
Chicano students at Stanford
University and members of the
Movmento Estudiantil Chicano de

Aztlan (MECHA) hereby support
and stand in solidarity with the
American Indians who are now
reclaiming the Island of Alcatraz."
It continues, "We have had the
painful experience of losing more
than half of Mexico to the United
States and know the pains and
anguish of being shoved into the
'reservations' of the barrio and the
fields of the Southwest."
"Until that time as we begin to
reclaim our own land," concludes
the message, "we demand that the
Island of Alcatraz be returned to
its rightful owners."
Symbolic Value
"We are concerned with the
immense symbolic value of what
