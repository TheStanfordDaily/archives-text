# Local Conservationists Sue To Halt Coyote Hill Building
## 
### 
The Committee for Green
Foothills, a local conservation
group, filed suit late Friday
against Stanford, Palo Alto and
three individuals, to halt the
industrial development of the
Coyote Hill area. The suit is based
on grounds that procedures
permitting the proposed
construction should be declared
"null and void."
The action had been
anticipated by both city and
University officials for several
weeks. The Environmental Law
Society (ELS), a group of
Stanford law students had
researched the legal issues of the
suit last month at the request of
the committee.
The suit follows closely the
outline of the ELS's research.
Named as defendants are the
University trustees, the City of
Palo Alto, Frank Gallagher and
Jack Wheatley, two Palo Alto City
Council members, and Louis
Fourcroy, city director of
planning and community
development.
The suit is broken into two
main "causes of action." The first
alleges that Fourcroy did not
follow proper procedures in
setting up the zoning in the first
place. The second is a "conflict of
interest" charge against Gallagher
and Wheatley.
Failed to Report
The charge against Fourcroy

states that he allegedly failed to
report Stanford's initial
application for a four-lot land
division (not requiring council
approval under old procedures)
until the zoning was approved
nine months later.
The suit seeks disqualification
of Wheatley and Gallagher from
voting on subdivision proposals on
the grounds that both councilmen
have declared interests in the
issue. Gallagher is an employee of
the University (director of
married students' housing) and
Wheatley could possibly become
involved as a contractor in
construction on the site.
Since the council vote
approving the plans was 5-4, the
outcome of this portion of the
suit has obvious implications.
'Irreversible Harm'
Continued construction on the
Coyote Hill property will cause
"irreversible and irreparable
harm . . .to the geology and
natural habitat of the Coyote Hill
area," the suit charges. The
proposed industrial park will also
"severely" impair "scenic, natural
and aesthetic values for the
surrounding communities," and
increase water, drainage, traffic,
"and other community problems
in the area," it contends.
However, according to George
Norton, an attorney and president
of the Green Foothills group,
there is "absolutely no intent" to

hinder the development of
Stanford's planned animal
research center on one flank of
the hill. University officials say
construction of the complex must
be underway before December 31,
or they will lose a large federal
grant needed to finance* the
complex.

suit last month at the request of
the committee.
The suit follows closely the
outline of the ELS's research.
Named as defendants are the
University trustees, the City of
Palo Alto, Frank Gallagher and
Jack Wheatley, two Palo Alto City
Council members, and Louis
Fourcroy, city director of
planning and community
development.
The suit is broken into two
main "causes of action." The first
alleges that Fourcroy did not
follow proper procedures in
setting up the zoning in the first
place. The second is a "conflict of
interest" charge against Gallagher
and Wheatley.
Failed to Report
The charge against Fourcroy

states that he allegedly failed to
report Stanford's initial
application for a four-lot land
division (not requiring council
approval under old procedures)
until the zoning was approved
nine months later.
The suit seeks disqualification
of Wheatley and Gallagher from
voting on subdivision proposals on
the grounds that both councilmen
have declared interests in the
issue. Gallagher is an employee of
the University (director of
married students' housing) and
Wheatley could possibly become
involved as a contractor in
construction on the site.
Since the council vote
approving the plans was 5-4, the
outcome of this portion of the
suit has obvious implications.
'Irreversible Harm'
Continued construction on the
Coyote Hill property will cause
"irreversible and irreparable
harm . . .to the geology and
natural habitat of the Coyote Hill
area," the suit charges. The
proposed industrial park will also
"severely" impair "scenic, natural
and aesthetic values for the
surrounding communities," and
increase water, drainage, traffic,
"and other community problems
in the area," it contends.
However, according to George
Norton, an attorney and president
of the Green Foothills group,
there is "absolutely no intent" to

hinder the development of
Stanford's planned animal
research center on one flank of
the hill. University officials say
construction of the complex must
be underway before December 31,
or they will lose a large federal
grant needed to finance* the
complex.
The Committee for Green
Foothills, a local conservation
group, filed suit late Friday
against Stanford, Palo Alto and
three individuals, to halt the
industrial development of the
Coyote Hill area. The suit is based
on grounds that procedures
permitting the proposed
construction should be declared
"null and void."
The action had been
anticipated by both city and
University officials for several
weeks. The Environmental Law
Society (ELS), a group of
Stanford law students had
researched the legal issues of the
suit last month at the request of
the committee.
