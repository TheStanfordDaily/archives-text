# Lyman 'Disappointed' In Evaluation Printing
## 
### 
Provost Richard Lyman said
yesterday he is "disappointed"
that the Stanford CHAPARRAL
published certain faculty
evaluation letters used in
determining salaries.
Despite University warnings
about possible suits, CHAPPIE
printed correspondence between
the dean of humanities and
sciences and department heads in
psychology, political science and
sociology.
The documents had been stolen
from Encina Hall during a sit-in
last spring. CHAPPIE printed
them in its last issue substituting
letters for the names of
professors.

Lyman stated that "the
University has said all it is going
to say regarding the printing of
faculty salaries."
Individuals still have the option
of suing CHAPARRAL, but there
are currently no reports of any
contemplated actions.
CHAPARRAL editor Michael
Sweeney could not be reached for
comment last night.
The evaluation letters and
salary lists were published
anonymously and distributed on
campus earlier in the fall. At the
time Lyman told the DAILY and
other publications it would give
assistance to individuals in
protecting their privacy.
