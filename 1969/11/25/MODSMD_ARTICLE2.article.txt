# Mead's Message: 'We Are Strangling'
## 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
"We are strangling under the
population explosion,''
anthropologist Margaret Mead
warned yesterday, and to deal
with this problem America must
rid itself of the notion that every
person must get married and that
every marriage must include
children.
The belief that large families
are necessary for survival is
outmoded, said Dr. Mead. Instead
she called for "a new style of
life." Americans maintain their
ideal of "having children as soon
as possible and as many as
possible," despite the decrease in
the infant mortality rate, she said.
"We firmly believe that
everyone who can afford children
should have a stationwagon full."
Dr. Mead insisted that Americans
must move toward smaller
families and a smaller number of
families if we expect the rest of
the world to do the same.
The noted anthropologist
visited campus yesterday to
participate in the Population and
Environment Forum. She spoke
to an overflow crowd in
Dinkelspiel in the afternoon, and
also filmed a discussion with six
students which will be shown on
KPIX-TV Sunday.
Different Forms of Marriage
"A much firmer commitment
to parenthood than ever before"
is needed, said Dr. Mead. She
suggested the possibility of
recognizing different forms of
marriage—parental marriages,
marriages for couples not going to
have children, and perhaps a
special form for older people so
that they will not automatically
disinherit their children as they
presently do in many states. "The
number of people over 80 living in
sin is tremendous, too," she
remarked.
Dr. Mead also spoke of the
hunger problem caused by the
population crisis.
"I understand Mr, Nixon plans
to get rid of hunger by 1972," she
joked, but she continued more
seriously„"There is no reason why
we couldn't get rid of hunger in
two months."
Government farm subsidies also
drew criticism from Dr. Mead.
"We've got to stop paying people
not to grow food in a world where
people are starving," she said in a
press conference earlier in the
day. She added that "We must
reduce population rate of growth
so we will not have a population
no one can feed."

In the press conference, Dr.
Mead also attacked the suburban
way of life which has developed in
the last 25 years. Segregation by
age, income, occupation, and
ethnic group combined with "life
in a box" created a way of life
which was "isolated and alienating
for everyone."
Dr. Mead believes that
"anything that would change the
present life style that has grown
since World War II would be
good." She is optimistic about the
new community form of living.
Several signs point to a
changing way of life, according to
Dr. Mead. First the present
emphasis on marriage as being
necessary for a full life is fairly
recent. "In the 1920's we did not
think that everyone had to get
married immediately," she says.
She foresees a change in life style
so that "women will be free to be
individuals if they wish, and men
will have more choice too."
More Adequate Contraception
Also coming are more adequate
contraception methods. Dr. Mead
pointed to Sweden as a country
where "with the use of the pill,
there is nearly an end to children
who can't be cared for." This has
enabled Sweden to undertake a
"tremendous move to adopt
children from other continents."
Dr. Mead also said that soon
"we will be able to determine
sex." This will also reduce the
population growth rate as
"everyone who has been having
girl after girl can have a boy right
away."
Population control also
demands a changing ethic "good
for everybody on he planet," said
Dr. Mead. Everyone should strive
for a "balance among the number
of adults, the number of children,
and the amount of resources
available." She believes that only
by combining population control
with control of resources can the
population crisis be met.

with control of resources can the
population crisis be met.
"We are strangling under the
population explosion,''
anthropologist Margaret Mead
warned yesterday, and to deal
with this problem America must
rid itself of the notion that every
person must get married and that
every marriage must include
children.
The belief that large families
are necessary for survival is
outmoded, said Dr. Mead. Instead
she called for "a new style of
life." Americans maintain their
ideal of "having children as soon
as possible and as many as
possible," despite the decrease in
the infant mortality rate, she said.
"We firmly believe that
everyone who can afford children
should have a stationwagon full."
Dr. Mead insisted that Americans
must move toward smaller
families and a smaller number of
families if we expect the rest of
the world to do the same.
The noted anthropologist
visited campus yesterday to
participate in the Population and
Environment Forum. She spoke
to an overflow crowd in
Dinkelspiel in the afternoon, and
also filmed a discussion with six
students which will be shown on
KPIX-TV Sunday.
Different Forms of Marriage
"A much firmer commitment
to parenthood than ever before"
is needed, said Dr. Mead. She
suggested the possibility of
recognizing different forms of
marriage—parental marriages,
marriages for couples not going to
have children, and perhaps a
special form for older people so
that they will not automatically
disinherit their children as they
presently do in many states. "The
number of people over 80 living in
sin is tremendous, too," she
remarked.
Dr. Mead also spoke of the
hunger problem caused by the
population crisis.
"I understand Mr, Nixon plans
to get rid of hunger by 1972," she
joked, but she continued more
seriously„"There is no reason why
we couldn't get rid of hunger in
two months."
Government farm subsidies also
drew criticism from Dr. Mead.
"We've got to stop paying people
not to grow food in a world where
people are starving," she said in a
press conference earlier in the
day. She added that "We must
reduce population rate of growth
so we will not have a population
no one can feed."

In the press conference, Dr.
Mead also attacked the suburban
way of life which has developed in
the last 25 years. Segregation by
age, income, occupation, and
ethnic group combined with "life
in a box" created a way of life
which was "isolated and alienating
for everyone."
Dr. Mead believes that
"anything that would change the
present life style that has grown
since World War II would be
good." She is optimistic about the
new community form of living.
Several signs point to a
changing way of life, according to
Dr. Mead. First the present
emphasis on marriage as being
necessary for a full life is fairly
recent. "In the 1920's we did not
think that everyone had to get
married immediately," she says.
She foresees a change in life style
so that "women will be free to be
individuals if they wish, and men
will have more choice too."
More Adequate Contraception
Also coming are more adequate
contraception methods. Dr. Mead
pointed to Sweden as a country
where "with the use of the pill,
there is nearly an end to children
who can't be cared for." This has
enabled Sweden to undertake a
"tremendous move to adopt
children from other continents."
Dr. Mead also said that soon
"we will be able to determine
sex." This will also reduce the
population growth rate as
"everyone who has been having
girl after girl can have a boy right
away."
Population control also
demands a changing ethic "good
for everybody on he planet," said
Dr. Mead. Everyone should strive
for a "balance among the number
of adults, the number of children,
and the amount of resources
available." She believes that only
by combining population control
with control of resources can the
population crisis be met.
