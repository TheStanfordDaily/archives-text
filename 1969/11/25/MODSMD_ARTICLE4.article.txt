# Three More Tried On SRI Charges
## 
### 
Jury selection continues today
in the trial of ASSU Senate
deputy-chairman John Shoch.
Shoch is charged with assault and
battery along with Mike Vawter
and his wife, Jan, in connection
with the May 16 SRI
demonstrations.
The three are accused of
involvement in an incident in
which Palo Alto photographer
Gene Tup per was allegedly
roughed up and his film taken.
Defense attorney Jim Wolpman
says that the defendants are
innocent, but that "it will be a
tough case." He said that he was
not happy with the first day's jury
selection. "There were absolutely

no young people, no blacks, and
no chicanos on the panel of about
fifty who were called," he said.
"They are essentially being tried
by their parents and grandparents,
rather than their peers."
In yesterday's procedings ten
prospective jurists were given
preliminary approval, however the
attorneys have not yet begun
pre-emptory challenges.
Presiding will be Judge John
Brenner. This trial will be his first
involving the SRI demonstrations.
Morning session will begin today
at 9 a.m. in dept. 4 of the
municipal courthouse. Afternoon
session starts at 1:30. Both
sessions are open to the public.
