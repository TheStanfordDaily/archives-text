# Technology Problems
## Pitzer Urges Ecology Study 
### 
President Kenneth Pitzer called
for creation of a new Presidential
commission concerned with the
impact of proposed technology on
environmental problems.
Along with three faculty
members, he addressed the 13th
National Conference of the U.S.
National Commission for
UNESCO yesterday in San
Francisco.
Joining Pitzer in the conference
"Man and His Environment—A
View Toward Survival," were
Professors Rolf Eliassen of
Environmental Engineering, Paul
Ehrlich of Biology and Paul
DeHart Hurd of Education.
Pitzer, a prominent chemist and
former member of the President's
Science Advisory Committee said,
"The net effect of the results of
science and technology on the
quality of human life is being
questioned — sometimes
irrationally, but nevertheless
actively."
'Degradation' Cited
In his address, the president
cited the problems of new
advances such as the atomic bomb

and the supersonic transport as
"spectacular examples," but
noted "we are now observing that
the cumulative degradation of our
environment from less spectacular
causes can, in the end, be even
more serious."
"If we are to avoid a damaging
emotional reaction against
science, scientists must help guide
technology in the true service of
mankind," Pitzer claimed.
He added, "One should ask not
only, "Is it possible? but also "is
it desirable?" and scientists must
play a major role in this judgment
process."
Education Stressed
Prof. Hurd, in his paper
"Education's Response to
Awareness Needs," said,
"although we live in an age largely
determined by science we do so
without the enlightenment
necessary for a scientific age."
"There is agreement," Hurd
said, "that education has a
responsibility to provide people
with the knowledge and skills
needed for survival. The problem
is not with the goal but its
implementation."
Hurd claimed that new
educational programs are needed
to cope with the demand for
education relating to
environmental problems."
A curriculum somewhat along
the lines of Hurd's suggestion is
Stanford's new Human Biology
Program, financed with a $1.9
million Ford Foundation grant.
Large Families Hit
Prof. Ehrlich, in his paper,
repeated his suggestion that
income tax laws should be revised
to eliminate deductions for
children. "It must be made clear
to our population that it is
socially irresponsible to have large
families."
Instruction in birth control
methods should be mandatory in
public schools, he said, and
federal legislation should be
passed to allow abortions for any
woman with doctor's approval.
Ehrlich received the most
enthusiastic response during an

afternoon session with his remarks
on the population explosion.
Air Pollution Noted
Prof. Eliassen, in an address
stressing the seriousness of air
pollution, said the public "must
continue pressure on elected
government officials; they must
learn to control their own
numbers and to build new cities
within the constraints of the
air-water-land environment."
He also suggested that water
may be the key to population
control in areas such as Southern
California.


A NEW LIFE STYLE—Anthropologist Margaret Mead criticized the
American obsession with large families, citing the population
explosion as a major danger in the world today. Dr. Mead also urged
"a much firmer commitment to parenthood than ever before. "
