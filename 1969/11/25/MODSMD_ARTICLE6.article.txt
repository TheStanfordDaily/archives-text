# Transcendental Guru Next ASSU Professor
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
Into the cauldron of ASSU
personalities and politics, comes a
presence of peace and quiet.
Mr. Jerry Jarvis, head of the
Students' International
Meditation Society (SIMS), has
agreed to be the ASSU Professor
for winter quarter, according to
representatives of the student
body's Professor Commission.
The American guru, who has
spread the word of the Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi across the land will
teach two courses in
"transcendental meditation,"
barring unforeseen intervention
by the Council on Undergraduate
Education (CUE), which must
approve all courses offered for
credit.
Commission Brings Profs
He follows Joan Robinson, a
noted Marxist economist who
taught several courses here spring
quarter at the request of the
ASSU Professor Commission.
The Commission, an official
body of the ASSU, was formed in
the 1967-1968 academic year to
bring to Stanford a

student-sponsored professor, free
from the usual restrictions and
able to offer lectures he desired.
A $10,000 grant was issued
from the ASSU Reserves fund to
cover expenses, of which $5,000
was spent in bringing Joan
Robinson to campus. The
remaining $5,000 was returned to
the ASSU, leaving the current
Commission at the mercy of the
Senate for more money.
Money in Doubt
"I really don't know whether
or not we'll get the money,"
stated Commission member Jeff
Kane. "The old Commission could
have kept their surplus for us, but
they didn't."
Kane has been instrumental in
signing Jarvis to appear, and
expects a big turnout for his
courses. They will be
Undergraduate Specials, to
alleviate the difficulties of fitting
Jarvis into the conventional
academic departments of the
university. Within the next ten
days, a decision is expected from
the CUE on the courses, and Kane
is hopeful that it will allow credit
as proposed by the Commission.
Jarvis was unavailable for
comment, as he is in India
studying near the Mahareshi. This
latest move is part of a nationwide
effort by Jarvis and other
mediatators to spread the word of
the yogi. He has spoken on
campuses across the nation, and
assisted in setting up SIMS centers
in Berkeley, Los Angeles,
Cambridge, Santa Barbara, and
New York.
Mind Expansion Develops
The purpose of SIMS is simple:
"To help every individual expand
his mind, develop his creative
intelligence and make use of his
full potential in studies, career,
and recreation." One achieves this
through transcendental
meditation.
In contrast to other Indian

philosophies, T-M, as it is known,
casts no stones at the comforts of
life. The Mahareshi has stated that
suffering is wrong, and that "The
natural state of man is joy."
Jarvis feels that T-M is "wholly
compatible with living in the
modern world. It is a mechanical
process; a technique of action."
The process is relatively simple.
For a donation of $35, one
receives personal instruction in he
technique of meditation, followed
by at least three periods of
"verification of experience."
Individual Uses Mantra
As Jarvis explained in an
LOOK interview, "We don't
meditate on anything or about
anything. The individual makes
use of his mantra, the prescribed
word whose vibrations are
perfectly in tune with his own,
and then simply sits and lets his
thoughts roam any way that they
please him."
All of this helps to explain the
movement's popularity in he
West, where mysticism and
ascetisism hold little attraction for
the average man. According to
LOOK Magazine, there are over
250,000 people meditating in over
50 countries around the world.
A good number of these are at
Stanford. According to Steve
Dahout, instructor for SIMS on
campus, there are over 100 active
meditators here. If Jarvis should
come, indications being that he
will, there will probably be more.
Lectures Attract Stanford Students
He has already given two
lectures on campus, both this
year. Despite poor publicity, they
managed to attract scores of
students who had either read
about transcendental meditation
or hear of it through friends.
All of this has some students
confused. One Roble resident was
heard to say, "What in hell . . ."
Another student queried, "Will
the bookstore carry beads?"
Representatives of the bookstore
were unavailable for comment.
