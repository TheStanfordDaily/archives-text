## Splashdown Perfect 
### 
ABOARD USS HORNET
(AP)- Apollo 12's moon voyagers
came home safely Monday,
making a bull's-eye splashdown in
tropic waters. It ended their
million-mile trip, man's second
lunar landing mission and first
detailed scientific exploration of
the moon.
Charles "Pete" Conrad, Jr.,
Richard F. Gordon Jr., and Alan
L. Bean rode their Yankee Clipper
spacecraft to a landing amidst
foaming whitecaps in South
Pacific seas. American television
audiences viewed the splashdown
live and in color.
Stowed aboard their charred
spacecraft were more scientific
treasures than were brought back
on man's first moon landing
mission. Apollo 11 last July had
landed on the moon to prove man
could do it. Apollo 12 went back
to begin detailed exploration and
to carefully document scientific
data. It also made a pinpoint lunar
landing, clearing the way for
future touchdowns in craters and
mountain valleys on the moon.
The spacecraft seared into
earth's atmosphere at 24,000

miles an hour and floated down
under three huge orange and
white parachutes, easily visible on
television. The splashdown was
only 3.1 miles from the recovery
ship, stationed some 400 miles
southeast of Samoa.
The spacemen were lifted from
a raft attached to their floating
spacecraft and flown by
helicopter to the Hornet flight
deck. Then, while a band played
"Anchors Away," the all-Navy
space crew went directly into a
silver van on the hangar deck of
the carrier, starting an isolation
that will end Dec. 10 at the Lunar
Receiving Laboratory in Houston.

SAN FRANCISCO
(AP)â€” Interior Secretary Walter
Hickel offered Monday to meet
with 120 American Indians
occupying Alcatraz Island, but
asked them to leave the former
federal prison.
However, Hickel did not
demand that they leave the
21-acre rock in San Francisco Bay
before talks begin.

And Indian spokesmen
reiterated that they would hold
pow wow on the mainland but
emphasized again they plan to
stay on the island indefinitely.
G.E. Strike*
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
AFL-CIO threatened Monday a
nationwide labor boycott of
General Electric Co. products
from light bulbs to huge electric
generators if the firm doesn't
come to terms with 147,000
strikers.
The company promptly
countered that such a boycott
could cost it business that would
result in the loss of many jobs
after the strike is over.
''We intend to put
informational picket lines in front
of consumer outlets featuring GP]
products, to handbill customers in
shopping centers, to use billboards
and other media to urge union
members, their families, friends
and neighbors to refuse to buy GE
products," said AFL-CIO
President George Meany.
