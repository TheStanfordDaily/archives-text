# Deserted Prison
## Freedom On Alcatraz 
### Arnie Greenstein 
On the site of a deserted prison
there is now more freedom than
in the society surrounding it.
Mothers don't have to keep a
close watch on their children
because they're safe. No one
guards the food. No one steals
anything. There are no work
details. What ever has to be done
is done willingly. There is no
hierachy of command. All
decisions are the responsibility of
everyone.
One girl described it as
"Peace . . .a feeling of love."
Familiar words, but not much else
for many whites. Being in another
culture there was much I didn't
notice. One Indian I did notice
who didn't like me totally ignored
me the three days I was there. He
didn't even see me.
D isregardless of the tight
blocade mentioned in some
papers, the blockade has turned
in to nothing more than an

annoyance and a source of fun. At
one time when food was being
unloaded on one side of the
island, a catamaran and sail boat
surrounded the Coast Guard on
the other side.
One Indian named Lonnie
Reynold, at another time, jumped
into the water to divert the Coast
Guard. They picked him up and
he told them someone else
jumped in on the other side. They
searched for an hour.
Contradicts Self
Hannon, regional director for
G.S.A. is even more ridiculous
than the blockade. He issues an
ultimatum to get off the island
and an hour later contradicts
himself saying there is no set
departure date.
He has lied to the
Indians—saying food and water
can be sent to Alcatraz, because
the Coast Guard has not
permitted it. As of Monday
morning water is critically low.
How can a man like Hannon,
whose job is selling used desks and
buildings, and hiring janitors have
the responsibility to deal with this
situation?
Most of the Indians there are
young and have been or are in
college the long way, after their
military obligation or
work—maybe that's why Reagan
wants to cut down on education
money. It breeds intelligence.
Individual Holdings
I asked one Indian if she will go
back to her reservation after
school. She said the reservation
she was originally from was
disbanded and divided into
individual holdings which weren't
supposed to be taxed for
twenty-five years. Within ten
years it was the highest in the I
community.
Another Indian replied
jokingly, "I'm extinct." I don't
mean to give the impression that
this is their last stand. It is their
first stand. Richard Oaks, a
Mohwak, said, "We've been
divided for so long and this might

be the beginning of something."
Denise (I don't remember his
tribe) said, "We're here to say.
They'll never get us off."
I talked with Aubrey
Grossman, attorney for the
Indians. The following is his
opinion: If the U.S. gov't, acts on
the petition of the Indians, a
precedent will be set, providing
direct communication with the
gov't, for grievances. The Indians
should keep the reclaiming of
Alcatraz out of the ccurts because
their suit will be lost there.
Moral Wrong
He said, "This is not a legal
problem, but a moral wrong,"
which will be handled politically.
No one will be arrested because
that "would expose and spread
very widely the treatment and
complaints of the Indians." The
gov't doesn't want that.
All cash and food should be
sent to
Alcatraz Relief Fund
c/o American Indian Center
3189 16th Street
S.F., California
Their fight is not simply for
Alcatraz, but schooling, a new
Indian Center, and justice.
Denis said, "They've taken
away justice, but they can never
take away our dignity."

notice. One Indian I did notice
who didn't like me totally ignored
me the three days I was there. He
didn't even see me.
D isregardless of the tight
blocade mentioned in some
papers, the blockade has turned
in to nothing more than an

annoyance and a source of fun. At
one time when food was being
unloaded on one side of the
island, a catamaran and sail boat
surrounded the Coast Guard on
the other side.
One Indian named Lonnie
Reynold, at another time, jumped
into the water to divert the Coast
Guard. They picked him up and
he told them someone else
jumped in on the other side. They
searched for an hour.
Contradicts Self
Hannon, regional director for
G.S.A. is even more ridiculous
than the blockade. He issues an
ultimatum to get off the island
and an hour later contradicts
himself saying there is no set
departure date.
He has lied to the
Indians—saying food and water
can be sent to Alcatraz, because
the Coast Guard has not
permitted it. As of Monday
morning water is critically low.
How can a man like Hannon,
whose job is selling used desks and
buildings, and hiring janitors have
the responsibility to deal with this
situation?
Most of the Indians there are
young and have been or are in
college the long way, after their
military obligation or
work—maybe that's why Reagan
wants to cut down on education
money. It breeds intelligence.
Individual Holdings
I asked one Indian if she will go
back to her reservation after
school. She said the reservation
she was originally from was
disbanded and divided into
individual holdings which weren't
supposed to be taxed for
twenty-five years. Within ten
years it was the highest in the I
community.
Another Indian replied
jokingly, "I'm extinct." I don't
mean to give the impression that
this is their last stand. It is their
first stand. Richard Oaks, a
Mohwak, said, "We've been
divided for so long and this might

be the beginning of something."
Denise (I don't remember his
tribe) said, "We're here to say.
They'll never get us off."
I talked with Aubrey
Grossman, attorney for the
Indians. The following is his
opinion: If the U.S. gov't, acts on
the petition of the Indians, a
precedent will be set, providing
direct communication with the
gov't, for grievances. The Indians
should keep the reclaiming of
Alcatraz out of the ccurts because
their suit will be lost there.
Moral Wrong
He said, "This is not a legal
problem, but a moral wrong,"
which will be handled politically.
No one will be arrested because
that "would expose and spread
very widely the treatment and
complaints of the Indians." The
gov't doesn't want that.
All cash and food should be
sent to
Alcatraz Relief Fund
c/o American Indian Center
3189 16th Street
S.F., California
Their fight is not simply for
Alcatraz, but schooling, a new
Indian Center, and justice.
Denis said, "They've taken
away justice, but they can never
take away our dignity."
On the site of a deserted prison
there is now more freedom than
in the society surrounding it.
Mothers don't have to keep a
close watch on their children
because they're safe. No one
guards the food. No one steals
anything. There are no work
details. What ever has to be done
is done willingly. There is no
hierachy of command. All
decisions are the responsibility of
everyone.
One girl described it as
"Peace . . .a feeling of love."
Familiar words, but not much else
for many whites. Being in another
culture there was much I didn't
notice. One Indian I did notice
who didn't like me totally ignored
me the three days I was there. He
didn't even see me.
