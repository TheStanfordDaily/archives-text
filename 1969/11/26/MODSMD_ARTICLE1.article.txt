# Irate Reaction To BYU Stand
## 
### TINA COOPER 
Reasoned objections and bitter
hate-mail have flooded University
offices in the wake of last week's
announcement by President
Kenneth Pitzer that Stanford will
not schedule new athletic
competition with Brigham Young
University (BYU) because of
Mormon racial discrimination.
The mail increased following an
alleged misquotation of Assistant
to the President Willard Wyman, by
reporter James McNabb Jr. of the
"Palo Alto Times."
On November 13 the TIMES
quoted Wyman as saying ". . . in
order for BYU to get back in
Stanford's good graces, the church
will have to 'reinterpret' God's
word and establish doctrines
compatible with Stanford's
policies."
Last Wednesday, Pitzer
announced that Stanford would
accept as official University policy
the recommendations of the
Human Relations Commission on
athletic scheduling. The
Commission recommended that
athletic events be scheduled only
with institutions which do not
discriminate racially, and are not
sponsored by any organization
that does so.
Mail Unfavorable
The majority of the mail has
been highly unfavorable to
Pitzer's announcement. Of the
194 letters on the subject received
since Friday by the President's
Office, only 16 have expressed
support for Stanford's new policy.
"The letters we have been
getting are not crackpot mail,"
said Fred Glover, Executive
Assistant to the President. "Most
of them have been from
thoughtful and intelligent people.
Many are from Stanford alumni."
"The ones who disagree with
us," he went on, "seem to think
we are attacking BYU personally,
as a university. They defend it on
the basis of what a fine school it
is."
Wyman Hate-mail
"Mr. Wyman might have been
receiving a slightly different kind
of mail, since unfortunately he
was misquoted in the [Palo Alto]
TIMES."
Wyman, when interviewed,
agreed. "The President's Office
has gotten more mail than I
have," he said, "but mine has
resulted from the misquote. It's
more a hate-mail type of thing."
Regarding the quote, Wyman
said, "It isn't true. I actually said
that there would probably be no
scheduling difficulties with
Mormon schools if Mormon
scriptures were not interpreted in
such a way as to deny the right of
priesthood to Negroes."
"When I saw the article in the

TIMES I immediately wrote a
letter to the editor protesting the
distortion of my comments."
Yellow Paper
As a result of the misquote,
Wyman has received some
extremely vitriolic mail. One
letter began, "This is written on
yellow paper to match you and
Pitzer . .
''The mail attacks the
University's stand on two
grounds," stated Wyman. "One,
people feel that we are attacking
BYU and Mormons personally;
and, two, they feel we are giving
in to student radicals.
"Then, of course, there's the
mail from people who are just
waiting for an excuse to attack
Stanford; the people who feel
threatened by the University's
liberal educational and political
attitudes. They've been waiting
for a chance like this for a long
time."
Stand Clarified
Wyman went on to outline just
what the administration meant to
do by taking this stand:
"We uphold the right of
anyone to believe what he
wishes," he said, "but we have a
responsibility to try and see that
all members of the Stanford
community are treated equally.
"Our official athletic events are
supposed to contribute to the
healthy environment of
participants; but it can be
considered an affront to a man's
dignity to ask him to participate
in events against opponents who
feel that that man, because of the
color of his skin, is relegated to a
second-class category.
"Our students have a right to
their own dignity."

Office, only 16 have expressed
support for Stanford's new policy.
"The letters we have been
getting are not crackpot mail,"
said Fred Glover, Executive
Assistant to the President. "Most
of them have been from
thoughtful and intelligent people.
Many are from Stanford alumni."
"The ones who disagree with
us," he went on, "seem to think
we are attacking BYU personally,
as a university. They defend it on
the basis of what a fine school it
is."
Wyman Hate-mail
"Mr. Wyman might have been
receiving a slightly different kind
of mail, since unfortunately he
was misquoted in the [Palo Alto]
TIMES."
Wyman, when interviewed,
agreed. "The President's Office
has gotten more mail than I
have," he said, "but mine has
resulted from the misquote. It's
more a hate-mail type of thing."
Regarding the quote, Wyman
said, "It isn't true. I actually said
that there would probably be no
scheduling difficulties with
Mormon schools if Mormon
scriptures were not interpreted in
such a way as to deny the right of
priesthood to Negroes."
"When I saw the article in the

TIMES I immediately wrote a
letter to the editor protesting the
distortion of my comments."
Yellow Paper
As a result of the misquote,
Wyman has received some
extremely vitriolic mail. One
letter began, "This is written on
yellow paper to match you and
Pitzer . .
''The mail attacks the
University's stand on two
grounds," stated Wyman. "One,
people feel that we are attacking
BYU and Mormons personally;
and, two, they feel we are giving
in to student radicals.
"Then, of course, there's the
mail from people who are just
waiting for an excuse to attack
Stanford; the people who feel
threatened by the University's
liberal educational and political
attitudes. They've been waiting
for a chance like this for a long
time."
Stand Clarified
Wyman went on to outline just
what the administration meant to
do by taking this stand:
"We uphold the right of
anyone to believe what he
wishes," he said, "but we have a
responsibility to try and see that
all members of the Stanford
community are treated equally.
"Our official athletic events are
supposed to contribute to the
healthy environment of
participants; but it can be
considered an affront to a man's
dignity to ask him to participate
in events against opponents who
feel that that man, because of the
color of his skin, is relegated to a
second-class category.
"Our students have a right to
their own dignity."
Reasoned objections and bitter
hate-mail have flooded University
offices in the wake of last week's
announcement by President
Kenneth Pitzer that Stanford will
not schedule new athletic
competition with Brigham Young
University (BYU) because of
Mormon racial discrimination.
The mail increased following an
alleged misquotation of Assistant
to the President Willard Wyman, by
reporter James McNabb Jr. of the
"Palo Alto Times."
On November 13 the TIMES
quoted Wyman as saying ". . . in
order for BYU to get back in
Stanford's good graces, the church
will have to 'reinterpret' God's
word and establish doctrines
compatible with Stanford's
policies."
Last Wednesday, Pitzer
announced that Stanford would
accept as official University policy
the recommendations of the
Human Relations Commission on
athletic scheduling. The
Commission recommended that
athletic events be scheduled only
with institutions which do not
discriminate racially, and are not
sponsored by any organization
that does so.
Mail Unfavorable
The majority of the mail has
been highly unfavorable to
Pitzer's announcement. Of the
194 letters on the subject received
since Friday by the President's
Office, only 16 have expressed
support for Stanford's new policy.
