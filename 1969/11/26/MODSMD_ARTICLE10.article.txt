# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

5imply A mazing
(The following letter was
\ written in reply to an article by
Robert Walker in Monday's
Stanford Daily.)
Dear Mr. Walker:
I've just been amazed. You've
just amazed me. As a student of
Sociology, I would have assumed
you to have had more training in
psychology, and/or a better
understanding of what it means to
be human. Human, Mr. Walker,
let's use that word instead of
"black" or "white." You think
snobbery and condescending
behavior exist here. You demand
that white people understand
blacks. Why, just for a switch,
doesn't the black man try to
understand whites, or himself, a
little better? Has it occurred to
you lately that it's extremely
difficult for whites to deal with
blacks since the latter are
constantly giving voice to their
hatred of whites and their world?
This just could be the reason for
some of the totally defensive
behavior that you have so
malignantly labelled "snobbery. '
I would like to offer you one
observation and one conclusion. A
few years ago, I worked as a
busboy in a restaurant. I was the
only white employee. May I tell
you now that any racial group
which finds itself in a position to
discriminate will do so. I was
tripped while carrying trays full of
dishes. There were cigarette ashes
in my meals more often than not.
They made every effort to get me
fired. So please, Mr. Walker, don't
ask me to feel guilty about being
human. And, in turn, I would ask
all whites to stop feeling guilty.
Try to correct the inequities,
which do surely exist but don't
accept the morally superior
attitude of some militant blacks,
because it is as false as that same
attitude in the white "bastards"
that you, sir, condemn so heartily.
Here's hoping you'll learn your
business.

The following is a transcript of
a letter we are sending to
President Pitzer. We hope you will
print it in the DAILY:
Dear President Pitzer,
We of the University Christian
Movement staff would like to go
on record as supporting your
stand of discontinuing
relationships with Brigham Young
University and other Mormon
educational institutions. We agree
with those of the Black
community who feel that the
Mormon Church's theological
position regarding black people
has the net effect of being racist
in character and that schools such
as Stanford should take the action
you took.
At the same time wo would
like to make it clear that we
consider all largely-white Church

bodies in this country, including
the ones with which we are
affiliated, to have serious
problems of racism within their
theologies, practices and
institutions. In addition, we feel
that all predominantly-white
colleges and universities in the
United States, including Stanford,
have serious racist dimensions that
must be squarely faced and
thoroughly removed.
The step taken in regard to
Brigham Young was a necessary
and correct one. We shall continue
to work for and support all of the
other steps that need to be taken
to put our institutional houses,

both ecclesiastical and
educational, inorder.
Sincerely,
B. Davie Napier & members of the
University Christian Movement
staff at Stanford.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Since there seems to be some
misunderstanding of my position
on the birth control issue (see
THE DAILY, November 21),
several points should be clarified.
1. I am in favor of birth
control and those means by which
unwanted pregnancies can be
prevented. The current proposal

on President Pitzer's desk is more
acceptable than some kind of
official endorsement by the
University. It places responsibility
for dispensation of the pill, or any
other contraceptive device, on the
individual physician and his client.
The problem of limited facilities
at Cowell remains to be solved,
however.
2. My particular reservations
about the pill are already known.
I hope that, by raising what seem
to me reasonable medical and
psychological questions about its
use, I won't be considered
reactionary! Current
contraceptive devices are far from

perfect, but I would agree we have
to make use of them: the
necessity and demand are clear.
3. More research into the
side-effects of the pill is
imperative and is being done at
medical centers throughout the
country. The University and the
Medical Center cannot, of course,
be responsible for research into all
the drugs prescribed at Cowell.
And nowhere in Mr. Diamond's
article (see THE DAILY,
November 12) did I suggest that.

Editor, THE DAILY:
"Who is Really for Peace in
Vietnam?"
An article with the above name
is now being circulated on
campus. The article cites Nixon's
peace proposals and North
Vietnam's rejection of them. It
concludes with the statement,
"Demonstrate for Peace, show
your support of President Nixon."
It unnerves me to think that
there are students in the Stanford
Community who actually believe
that the peace demonstrations are
in support of Nixon. It is the
stated goal of the peace
demonstrations that the United
States begin an immediate
withdrawal of all U.S. troops in
Vietnam regardless of
consequences. This is obviously a
complete rejection of Nixon's
policies. Furthermore, the
demonstrations are a bona fide
hindrance to Nixon's "Peace
Plan" because they show the
Communists that there is a
powerful faction in the U.S.
which advocates a complete
concession to the North
Vietnamese.
Therefore it is sheer
poppycock to even suggest that
the demonstrations for peace are
in Nixon's support. The
suggestion is apparently a blatant
lie of "Students for Peace in
Vietnam" in order to gain peace
demonstration support. The
decision of who to support
belongs to each individual, but it
is totally irrational to support
both Nixon's "Peace Plan" and
the peace demonstrations. To
agree with one is to disagree with
the other.

I wish to congratulate those at
Stanford who are responsible for
removing BYU and any Mormon
school from their sports
scheduling after 1970. I hope this
decision reflects the intelligent
concern of both the students and
faculty of Stanford.
Having lived in Utah for two
years recently, 1 know vividly first
hand what it's like to live in
Mormon country and not be one
of the fold. Discrimination,
Mormon style, is not limited to
Negroes.
I met some fine people in
Utah, some of them are even
Mormons! But when they say
BYU does not practice
discrimination, it just isn t true. In
fairness to the Mormons, however,
perhaps they just don't realize
they're guilty of such a practice.
Perhaps a few more exchange
cancellations by other schools
outside Utah wiil help make them
more aware of it, and even lead to
a lessening of the practice.
Perhaps.

Since there seems to be some
misunderstanding of my position
on the birth control issue (see
THE DAILY, November 21),
several points should be clarified.
1. I am in favor of birth
control and those means by which
unwanted pregnancies can be
prevented. The current proposal

on President Pitzer's desk is more
acceptable than some kind of
official endorsement by the
University. It places responsibility
for dispensation of the pill, or any
other contraceptive device, on the
individual physician and his client.
The problem of limited facilities
at Cowell remains to be solved,
however.
2. My particular reservations
about the pill are already known.
I hope that, by raising what seem
to me reasonable medical and
psychological questions about its
use, I won't be considered
reactionary! Current
contraceptive devices are far from

perfect, but I would agree we have
to make use of them: the
necessity and demand are clear.
3. More research into the
side-effects of the pill is
imperative and is being done at
medical centers throughout the
country. The University and the
Medical Center cannot, of course,
be responsible for research into all
the drugs prescribed at Cowell.
And nowhere in Mr. Diamond's
article (see THE DAILY,
November 12) did I suggest that.

"Who is Really for Peace in

An article with the above name
is now being circulated on
campus. The article cites Nixon's
peace proposals and North
Vietnam's rejection of them. It
concludes with the statement,
"Demonstrate for Peace, show
your support of President Nixon."
It unnerves me to think that
there are students in the Stanford
Community who actually believe
that the peace demonstrations are
in support of Nixon. It is the
stated goal of the peace
demonstrations that the United
States begin an immediate
withdrawal of all U.S. troops in
Vietnam regardless of
consequences. This is obviously a
complete rejection of Nixon's
policies. Furthermore, the
demonstrations are a bona fide
hindrance to Nixon's "Peace
Plan" because they show the
Communists that there is a
powerful faction in the U.S.
which advocates a complete
concession to the North
Vietnamese.
Therefore it is sheer
poppycock to even suggest that
the demonstrations for peace are
in Nixon's support. The
suggestion is apparently a blatant
lie of "Students for Peace in
Vietnam" in order to gain peace
demonstration support. The
decision of who to support
belongs to each individual, but it
is totally irrational to support
both Nixon's "Peace Plan" and
the peace demonstrations. To
agree with one is to disagree with
the other.

removing BYU and any Mormon
school from their sports
scheduling after 1970. I hope this
decision reflects the intelligent

Having lived in Utah for two
years recently, 1 know vividly first
hand what it's like to live in
Mormon country and not be one
of the fold. Discrimination,
Mormon style, is not limited to
Negroes.
I met some fine people in
Utah, some of them are even
Mormons! But when they say
BYU does not practice
discrimination, it just isn t true. In
fairness to the Mormons, however,
perhaps they just don't realize
they're guilty of such a practice.
Perhaps a few more exchange
cancellations by other schools
outside Utah wiil help make them
more aware of it, and even lead to
a lessening of the practice.
Perhaps.

\ written in reply to an article by
Robert Walker in Monday's
Stanford Daily.)
Dear Mr. Walker:
I've just been amazed. You've
just amazed me. As a student of
Sociology, I would have assumed
you to have had more training in
psychology, and/or a better
understanding of what it means to
be human. Human, Mr. Walker,
let's use that word instead of
"black" or "white." You think
snobbery and condescending
behavior exist here. You demand
that white people understand
blacks. Why, just for a switch,
doesn't the black man try to
understand whites, or himself, a
little better? Has it occurred to
you lately that it's extremely
difficult for whites to deal with
blacks since the latter are
constantly giving voice to their
hatred of whites and their world?
This just could be the reason for
some of the totally defensive
behavior that you have so
malignantly labelled "snobbery. '
I would like to offer you one
observation and one conclusion. A
few years ago, I worked as a
busboy in a restaurant. I was the
only white employee. May I tell
you now that any racial group
which finds itself in a position to
discriminate will do so. I was
tripped while carrying trays full of
dishes. There were cigarette ashes
in my meals more often than not.
They made every effort to get me
fired. So please, Mr. Walker, don't
ask me to feel guilty about being
human. And, in turn, I would ask
all whites to stop feeling guilty.
Try to correct the inequities,
which do surely exist but don't
accept the morally superior
attitude of some militant blacks,
because it is as false as that same
attitude in the white "bastards"
that you, sir, condemn so heartily.
Here's hoping you'll learn your
business.

Dear President Pitzer,
We of the University Christian
Movement staff would like to go
on record as supporting your
stand of discontinuing
relationships with Brigham Young
University and other Mormon
educational institutions. We agree
with those of the Black
community who feel that the
Mormon Church's theological
position regarding black people
has the net effect of being racist
in character and that schools such
as Stanford should take the action
you took.
At the same time wo would
like to make it clear that we
consider all largely-white Church

bodies in this country, including
the ones with which we are
affiliated, to have serious
problems of racism within their
theologies, practices and
institutions. In addition, we feel
that all predominantly-white
colleges and universities in the
United States, including Stanford,
have serious racist dimensions that
must be squarely faced and
thoroughly removed.
The step taken in regard to
Brigham Young was a necessary

I wish to congratulate those at
Stanford who are responsible for
removing BYU and any Mormon
school from their sports
scheduling after 1970. I hope this
decision reflects the intelligent
concern of both the students and
faculty of Stanford.
Having lived in Utah for two
years recently, 1 know vividly first
hand what it's like to live in
Mormon country and not be one
of the fold. Discrimination,
Mormon style, is not limited to
Negroes.
I met some fine people in
Utah, some of them are even
Mormons! But when they say
BYU does not practice
discrimination, it just isn t true. In
fairness to the Mormons, however,
perhaps they just don't realize
they're guilty of such a practice.
Perhaps a few more exchange
cancellations by other schools
outside Utah wiil help make them
more aware of it, and even lead to
a lessening of the practice.
Perhaps.

(The following letter was
\ written in reply to an article by
Robert Walker in Monday's
Stanford Daily.)
Dear Mr. Walker:
I've just been amazed. You've
just amazed me. As a student of
Sociology, I would have assumed
you to have had more training in
psychology, and/or a better
understanding of what it means to
be human. Human, Mr. Walker,
let's use that word instead of
"black" or "white." You think
snobbery and condescending
behavior exist here. You demand
that white people understand
blacks. Why, just for a switch,
doesn't the black man try to
understand whites, or himself, a
little better? Has it occurred to
you lately that it's extremely
difficult for whites to deal with
blacks since the latter are
constantly giving voice to their
hatred of whites and their world?
This just could be the reason for
some of the totally defensive
behavior that you have so
malignantly labelled "snobbery. '
I would like to offer you one
observation and one conclusion. A
few years ago, I worked as a
busboy in a restaurant. I was the
only white employee. May I tell
you now that any racial group
which finds itself in a position to
discriminate will do so. I was
tripped while carrying trays full of
dishes. There were cigarette ashes
in my meals more often than not.
They made every effort to get me
fired. So please, Mr. Walker, don't
ask me to feel guilty about being
human. And, in turn, I would ask
all whites to stop feeling guilty.
Try to correct the inequities,
which do surely exist but don't
accept the morally superior
attitude of some militant blacks,
because it is as false as that same
attitude in the white "bastards"
that you, sir, condemn so heartily.
Here's hoping you'll learn your
business.

The following is a transcript of
a letter we are sending to
President Pitzer. We hope you will
print it in the DAILY:
Dear President Pitzer,
We of the University Christian
Movement staff would like to go
on record as supporting your
stand of discontinuing
relationships with Brigham Young
University and other Mormon
educational institutions. We agree
with those of the Black
community who feel that the
Mormon Church's theological
position regarding black people
has the net effect of being racist
in character and that schools such
as Stanford should take the action
you took.
At the same time wo would
like to make it clear that we
consider all largely-white Church

bodies in this country, including
the ones with which we are
affiliated, to have serious
problems of racism within their
theologies, practices and
institutions. In addition, we feel
that all predominantly-white
colleges and universities in the
United States, including Stanford,
have serious racist dimensions that
must be squarely faced and
thoroughly removed.
The step taken in regard to
Brigham Young was a necessary
and correct one. We shall continue
to work for and support all of the
other steps that need to be taken
to put our institutional houses,

both ecclesiastical and
educational, inorder.
Sincerely,
B. Davie Napier & members of the
University Christian Movement
staff at Stanford.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Since there seems to be some
misunderstanding of my position
on the birth control issue (see
THE DAILY, November 21),
several points should be clarified.
1. I am in favor of birth
control and those means by which
unwanted pregnancies can be
prevented. The current proposal

on President Pitzer's desk is more
acceptable than some kind of
official endorsement by the
University. It places responsibility
for dispensation of the pill, or any
other contraceptive device, on the
individual physician and his client.
The problem of limited facilities
at Cowell remains to be solved,
however.
2. My particular reservations
about the pill are already known.
I hope that, by raising what seem
to me reasonable medical and
psychological questions about its
use, I won't be considered
reactionary! Current
contraceptive devices are far from

perfect, but I would agree we have
to make use of them: the
necessity and demand are clear.
3. More research into the
side-effects of the pill is
imperative and is being done at
medical centers throughout the
country. The University and the
Medical Center cannot, of course,
be responsible for research into all
the drugs prescribed at Cowell.
And nowhere in Mr. Diamond's
article (see THE DAILY,
November 12) did I suggest that.

"Who is Really for Peace in

An article with the above name
is now being circulated on
campus. The article cites Nixon's
peace proposals and North
Vietnam's rejection of them. It
concludes with the statement,
"Demonstrate for Peace, show
your support of President Nixon."
It unnerves me to think that
there are students in the Stanford
Community who actually believe
that the peace demonstrations are
in support of Nixon. It is the
stated goal of the peace
demonstrations that the United
States begin an immediate
withdrawal of all U.S. troops in
Vietnam regardless of
consequences. This is obviously a
complete rejection of Nixon's
policies. Furthermore, the
demonstrations are a bona fide
hindrance to Nixon's "Peace
Plan" because they show the
Communists that there is a
powerful faction in the U.S.
which advocates a complete
concession to the North
Vietnamese.
Therefore it is sheer
poppycock to even suggest that
the demonstrations for peace are
in Nixon's support. The
suggestion is apparently a blatant
lie of "Students for Peace in

demonstration support. The

attitude of some militant blacks,
because it is as false as that same
attitude in the white "bastards"
that you, sir, condemn so heartily.
Here's hoping you'll learn your
business.

Put The House hi Order
Editor, THE DAILY:
The following is a transcript of
a letter we are sending to
President Pitzer. We hope you will
print it in the DAILY:
Dear President Pitzer,
We of the University Christian
Movement staff would like to go
on record as supporting your
stand of discontinuing
relationships with Brigham Young
University and other Mormon
educational institutions. We agree
with those of the Black
community who feel that the
Mormon Church's theological
position regarding black people
has the net effect of being racist
in character and that schools such
as Stanford should take the action
you took.
At the same time wo would
like to make it clear that we
consider all largely-white Church

bodies in this country, including
the ones with which we are
affiliated, to have serious
problems of racism within their
theologies, practices and
institutions. In addition, we feel
that all predominantly-white
colleges and universities in the
United States, including Stanford,
have serious racist dimensions that
must be squarely faced and
thoroughly removed.
The step taken in regard to
Brigham Young was a necessary
and correct one. We shall continue
to work for and support all of the
other steps that need to be taken
to put our institutional houses,

both ecclesiastical and
educational, inorder.
Sincerely,
B. Davie Napier & members of the
University Christian Movement
staff at Stanford.
Pills, Pills, Pills
Editor, THE DAILY:
Since there seems to be some
misunderstanding of my position
on the birth control issue (see
THE DAILY, November 21),
several points should be clarified.
1. I am in favor of birth
control and those means by which
unwanted pregnancies can be
prevented. The current proposal

on President Pitzer's desk is more
acceptable than some kind of
official endorsement by the
University. It places responsibility
for dispensation of the pill, or any
other contraceptive device, on the
individual physician and his client.
The problem of limited facilities
at Cowell remains to be solved,
however.
2. My particular reservations
about the pill are already known.
I hope that, by raising what seem
to me reasonable medical and
psychological questions about its
use, I won't be considered
reactionary! Current
contraceptive devices are far from

perfect, but I would agree we have
to make use of them: the
necessity and demand are clear.
3. More research into the
side-effects of the pill is
imperative and is being done at
medical centers throughout the
country. The University and the
Medical Center cannot, of course,
be responsible for research into all
the drugs prescribed at Cowell.
And nowhere in Mr. Diamond's
article (see THE DAILY,
November 12) did I suggest that.

Peace & Love
Editor, THE DAILY:
"Who is Really for Peace in
Vietnam?"
An article with the above name
is now being circulated on
campus. The article cites Nixon's
peace proposals and North
Vietnam's rejection of them. It
concludes with the statement,
"Demonstrate for Peace, show
your support of President Nixon."
It unnerves me to think that
there are students in the Stanford
Community who actually believe
that the peace demonstrations are
in support of Nixon. It is the
stated goal of the peace
demonstrations that the United
States begin an immediate
withdrawal of all U.S. troops in
Vietnam regardless of
consequences. This is obviously a
complete rejection of Nixon's
policies. Furthermore, the
demonstrations are a bona fide
hindrance to Nixon's "Peace
Plan" because they show the
Communists that there is a
powerful faction in the U.S.
which advocates a complete
concession to the North
Vietnamese.
Therefore it is sheer
poppycock to even suggest that
the demonstrations for peace are
in Nixon's support. The
suggestion is apparently a blatant
lie of "Students for Peace in
Vietnam" in order to gain peace
demonstration support. The
decision of who to support
belongs to each individual, but it
is totally irrational to support
both Nixon's "Peace Plan" and
the peace demonstrations. To
agree with one is to disagree with
the other.

More BYU
Editor, THE DAILY:
I wish to congratulate those at
Stanford who are responsible for
removing BYU and any Mormon
school from their sports
scheduling after 1970. I hope this
decision reflects the intelligent
concern of both the students and
faculty of Stanford.
Having lived in Utah for two
years recently, 1 know vividly first
hand what it's like to live in
Mormon country and not be one
of the fold. Discrimination,
Mormon style, is not limited to
Negroes.
I met some fine people in
Utah, some of them are even
Mormons! But when they say
BYU does not practice
discrimination, it just isn t true. In
fairness to the Mormons, however,
perhaps they just don't realize
they're guilty of such a practice.
Perhaps a few more exchange
cancellations by other schools
outside Utah wiil help make them
more aware of it, and even lead to
a lessening of the practice.
Perhaps.
