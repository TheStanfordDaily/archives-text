# Genetic Enslavement
## Shockley Informs 'Uninformed'

Professor Carl N. Dealer's
dispassionate letter "Genetic
Differences" in the November 12
Stanford DAILY is to me a most
encouraging change from several
years ago when the expression of
my worries about dysgenics
provoked attacks, accusing me of
malice, mischief, and
pseudoscience.
Dr. Degler is in distinguished,
but uninformed, company when
he doubts the value of" racial
research because . . the
definition of a Negro in the
United States is simply cultural,
rather than genetical or
logical ..." A past president of
the American Anthropoligical
Society wrote me a very similar

opinion in 1968 but
cross-examination disclosed his
ignorance about reliable
measurements of racial mixes.
Dr. T.E. Reed in his article
CAUCASIAN GENES IN
AMERICAN NEGROES in
Science 22 August 1969, reports
that 22 plus-or-minus one percent
of the genes of the Oakland,
California Negro population come
from Caucasian ancestry. A
Georgia population has 11
plus-or-minus two percent and the
Gullah Negroes of Charleston have
4 plus-or-minus one percent. The
blood type gene used by Reed has
negligible effect on physical
appearance.

In 1966 (Science
154:3747,428, 1966) I proposed
that measurements using genes
unrelated to racial appearance
might separate environmental
effects on IQ from underlying
racial factors. Would the resulting
research findings elucidate the
apparent slippage during 50 years
of about 5 IQ points for Negroes
relative to whites on induction
tests? (Shockley Proc. Nat. Acad.
Sci. June 1967). Would such
findings bear on racial differences
in college admission recently
discussed by psychologists?
(Julian Stanley, Science 14 Feb
69; Lloyd G. Humphreys, Science
10 Oct 69.)

For comparison with Dr.
Degler's unspecified . . small
mountain of scientific
studies ..." I recommend Audrey
Shuey's (THE TESTING OF
NEGRO INTELLIGENCE, Social
Science Press, N.Y. 1966) review
of 380 original investigations.
My research focuses principally
upon white-Negro comparisons
for two reasons: (1) Our national
racial problems primarily involve
the Negro minority and (2)
Negroes are the only racial group
for which extensive published
statistics are available. Therefore,
my personal research on questions
related to Negroes has far greater
immediate promise of
contributing to sound diagnosis of
our human quality problems than,
for example, would attempts to
study hereditary factors for
Appalacian whites, for whom I
have found that statistical data is
practically unobtainable.
Although I emphasize the Negro
area for these reasons, I continue
to urge broad inquiry into
hereditary aspects of human
behavior for all racial groups.
Jews and Orientals
Dr. Degler's letter suggests to
me that he doubts that I or any
other non-Jew might have carried
out studies showing the
"superiority of Jews over the rest
of us." His doubts are easily
resolved. In my own published
paper, A "TRY SIMPLEST
CASES" APPROACH TO THE
HEREDITY-POVERTY-CRIME
PROBLEM (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.
June 1967), I report that in
achieving scientific eminence
American Jews and Orientals are
10 times more successful per
capita than the national average.
Orientals are also about six times
less likely than the average to be
arrested for crime.
One extensive study of racial
differences in intelligence,
including statistics on the
superiority of Jews, is co-authored
by a member of the Stanford
community. (Nathaniel Weyl and
Stefan Possony, the latter of the
Hoover Institute, THE

GEOGRAPHY OF INTELLECT,
Henry Regnery Co., Chicago
196 3). My own subsequent
limited researches agree with their
extensive and ingeniously
compiled statistics.
Fight for Democracy
Dr. Degler is an historian. Can
he furnish a historical evaluation
of my faith that in a democracy,
sound scientific diagnosis of
human problems leading to
objectively established,
reproducable facts is a course
more likely than not to contribute
to national well being?
If Dr. Degler concurs in my
faith, then, as I have informed
him by an advance copy of this
letter, I would welcome an
opportunity to present my
analyses to him or to a group of
his selection. My research leads
me to fear that the present
unwillingness of our academic
community to encourage research
on hereditary aspects of human
quality problems may be one of
the most grievous derelictions of
intellectual responsibility in the
history of civilization. Not to try
to change this attitude is an
irresponsibility I am unwilling to
have on my conscience. I hope
and believe that reversing this
attitude would contribute to the
objective of Nobel's will of
"conferring greatest benefit on
mankind."
Although I predict that
vigorously supported inquiries
into dysgenic possibilities will
benefit all racial groups, I believe
that a principal result may be the
greatest contribution that can be
made to American Negro welfare
for the next generation. Sound
diagnosis may lead to wise,
humane and appropriate
prevention of hundreds of births
per day of babies destined with
high probability to lives of
frustration in our modern,
technological society by genetic
enslavement limiting them to
mental retardation with IQ below
75.

Dr. Degler is an historian. Can
he furnish a historical evaluation
of my faith that in a democracy,
sound scientific diagnosis of
human problems leading to
objectively established,
reproducable facts is a course
more likely than not to contribute
to national well being?
If Dr. Degler concurs in my
faith, then, as I have informed
him by an advance copy of this
letter, I would welcome an
opportunity to present my
analyses to him or to a group of
his selection. My research leads
me to fear that the present
unwillingness of our academic
community to encourage research
on hereditary aspects of human
quality problems may be one of
the most grievous derelictions of
intellectual responsibility in the
history of civilization. Not to try
to change this attitude is an
irresponsibility I am unwilling to
have on my conscience. I hope
and believe that reversing this
attitude would contribute to the
objective of Nobel's will of
"conferring greatest benefit on
mankind."
Although I predict that
vigorously supported inquiries
into dysgenic possibilities will
benefit all racial groups, I believe
that a principal result may be the
greatest contribution that can be
made to American Negro welfare
for the next generation. Sound
diagnosis may lead to wise,
humane and appropriate
prevention of hundreds of births
per day of babies destined with
high probability to lives of
frustration in our modern,
technological society by genetic
enslavement limiting them to
mental retardation with IQ below
75.

Professor Carl N. Dealer's
dispassionate letter "Genetic
Differences" in the November 12
Stanford DAILY is to me a most
encouraging change from several
years ago when the expression of
my worries about dysgenics
provoked attacks, accusing me of
malice, mischief, and
pseudoscience.
Dr. Degler is in distinguished,
but uninformed, company when
he doubts the value of" racial
research because . . the
definition of a Negro in the
United States is simply cultural,
rather than genetical or
logical ..." A past president of
the American Anthropoligical
Society wrote me a very similar

opinion in 1968 but
cross-examination disclosed his
ignorance about reliable
measurements of racial mixes.
Dr. T.E. Reed in his article
CAUCASIAN GENES IN
AMERICAN NEGROES in
Science 22 August 1969, reports
that 22 plus-or-minus one percent
of the genes of the Oakland,
California Negro population come
from Caucasian ancestry. A
Georgia population has 11
plus-or-minus two percent and the
Gullah Negroes of Charleston have
4 plus-or-minus one percent. The
blood type gene used by Reed has
negligible effect on physical
appearance.

In 1966 (Science
154:3747,428, 1966) I proposed
that measurements using genes
unrelated to racial appearance
might separate environmental
effects on IQ from underlying
racial factors. Would the resulting
research findings elucidate the
apparent slippage during 50 years
of about 5 IQ points for Negroes
relative to whites on induction
tests? (Shockley Proc. Nat. Acad.
Sci. June 1967). Would such
findings bear on racial differences
in college admission recently
discussed by psychologists?
(Julian Stanley, Science 14 Feb

For comparison with Dr.
Degler's unspecified . . small
mountain of scientific
studies ..." I recommend Audrey
Shuey's (THE TESTING OF
NEGRO INTELLIGENCE, Social
Science Press, N.Y. 1966) review
of 380 original investigations.
My research focuses principally
upon white-Negro comparisons
for two reasons: (1) Our national
racial problems primarily involve
the Negro minority and (2)
Negroes are the only racial group
for which extensive published
statistics are available. Therefore,
my personal research on questions
related to Negroes has far greater
immediate promise of
contributing to sound diagnosis of
our human quality problems than,
for example, would attempts to
study hereditary factors for
Appalacian whites, for whom I
have found that statistical data is
practically unobtainable.
Although I emphasize the Negro
area for these reasons, I continue
to urge broad inquiry into
hereditary aspects of human
behavior for all racial groups.
Jews and Orientals
Dr. Degler's letter suggests to
me that he doubts that I or any
other non-Jew might have carried
out studies showing the
"superiority of Jews over the rest
of us." His doubts are easily
resolved. In my own published
paper, A "TRY SIMPLEST
CASES" APPROACH TO THE
HEREDITY-POVERTY-CRIME
PROBLEM (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.
June 1967), I report that in
achieving scientific eminence
American Jews and Orientals are
10 times more successful per
capita than the national average.
Orientals are also about six times
less likely than the average to be
arrested for crime.
One extensive study of racial
differences in intelligence,
including statistics on the
superiority of Jews, is co-authored
by a member of the Stanford
community. (Nathaniel Weyl and
Stefan Possony, the latter of the
Hoover Institute, THE

GEOGRAPHY OF INTELLECT,

contributing to sound diagnosis of
our human quality problems than,
for example, would attempts to
study hereditary factors for
Appalacian whites, for whom I
have found that statistical data is
practically unobtainable.
Although I emphasize the Negro
area for these reasons, I continue
to urge broad inquiry into
hereditary aspects of human
behavior for all racial groups.
Jews and Orientals
Dr. Degler's letter suggests to
me that he doubts that I or any
other non-Jew might have carried
out studies showing the
"superiority of Jews over the rest
of us." His doubts are easily
resolved. In my own published
paper, A "TRY SIMPLEST
CASES" APPROACH TO THE
HEREDITY-POVERTY-CRIME
PROBLEM (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.
June 1967), I report that in
achieving scientific eminence
American Jews and Orientals are
10 times more successful per
capita than the national average.
Orientals are also about six times
less likely than the average to be
arrested for crime.
One extensive study of racial
differences in intelligence,
including statistics on the
superiority of Jews, is co-authored
by a member of the Stanford
community. (Nathaniel Weyl and
Stefan Possony, the latter of the
Hoover Institute, THE

GEOGRAPHY OF INTELLECT,
Henry Regnery Co., Chicago
196 3). My own subsequent
limited researches agree with their
extensive and ingeniously
compiled statistics.
Fight for Democracy
Dr. Degler is an historian. Can
he furnish a historical evaluation
of my faith that in a democracy,
sound scientific diagnosis of
human problems leading to
objectively established,
reproducable facts is a course
more likely than not to contribute
to national well being?
If Dr. Degler concurs in my
faith, then, as I have informed
him by an advance copy of this
letter, I would welcome an
opportunity to present my
analyses to him or to a group of
his selection. My research leads
me to fear that the present
unwillingness of our academic
community to encourage research
on hereditary aspects of human
quality problems may be one of
the most grievous derelictions of
intellectual responsibility in the
history of civilization. Not to try
to change this attitude is an
irresponsibility I am unwilling to
have on my conscience. I hope
and believe that reversing this
attitude would contribute to the
objective of Nobel's will of
"conferring greatest benefit on
mankind."
Although I predict that
vigorously supported inquiries
into dysgenic possibilities will
benefit all racial groups, I believe
that a principal result may be the
greatest contribution that can be
made to American Negro welfare
for the next generation. Sound
diagnosis may lead to wise,
humane and appropriate
prevention of hundreds of births
per day of babies destined with
high probability to lives of
frustration in our modern,
technological society by genetic
enslavement limiting them to
mental retardation with IQ below
75.

Professor Carl N. Dealer's
dispassionate letter "Genetic
Differences" in the November 12
Stanford DAILY is to me a most
encouraging change from several
years ago when the expression of
my worries about dysgenics
provoked attacks, accusing me of
malice, mischief, and
pseudoscience.
Dr. Degler is in distinguished,
but uninformed, company when
he doubts the value of" racial
research because . . the
definition of a Negro in the
United States is simply cultural,
rather than genetical or
logical ..." A past president of
the American Anthropoligical
Society wrote me a very similar

opinion in 1968 but
cross-examination disclosed his
ignorance about reliable
measurements of racial mixes.
Dr. T.E. Reed in his article
CAUCASIAN GENES IN
AMERICAN NEGROES in
Science 22 August 1969, reports
that 22 plus-or-minus one percent
of the genes of the Oakland,
California Negro population come
from Caucasian ancestry. A
Georgia population has 11
plus-or-minus two percent and the
Gullah Negroes of Charleston have
4 plus-or-minus one percent. The
blood type gene used by Reed has
negligible effect on physical
appearance.

In 1966 (Science
154:3747,428, 1966) I proposed
that measurements using genes
unrelated to racial appearance
might separate environmental
effects on IQ from underlying
racial factors. Would the resulting
research findings elucidate the
apparent slippage during 50 years
of about 5 IQ points for Negroes
relative to whites on induction
tests? (Shockley Proc. Nat. Acad.
Sci. June 1967). Would such
findings bear on racial differences
in college admission recently
discussed by psychologists?
(Julian Stanley, Science 14 Feb
69; Lloyd G. Humphreys, Science
10 Oct 69.)

For comparison with Dr.
Degler's unspecified . . small
mountain of scientific
studies ..." I recommend Audrey
Shuey's (THE TESTING OF
NEGRO INTELLIGENCE, Social
Science Press, N.Y. 1966) review
of 380 original investigations.
My research focuses principally
upon white-Negro comparisons
for two reasons: (1) Our national
racial problems primarily involve
the Negro minority and (2)
Negroes are the only racial group
for which extensive published
statistics are available. Therefore,
my personal research on questions
related to Negroes has far greater
immediate promise of
contributing to sound diagnosis of
our human quality problems than,
for example, would attempts to
study hereditary factors for
Appalacian whites, for whom I
have found that statistical data is
