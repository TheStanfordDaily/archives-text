# Exact Plans
## Stanford Land Development 
### Boyd Smith 
(Boyd Smith is Manager of
Real Estate.)
Several articles have appeared
in the Daily this summer and fall
about Stanford land development,
particularly as it relates to
long-planned uses of the property
surrounding Coyote Hill in the
southeast corner of the campus.
The low-income housing issue
also has been linked to the Coyote
Hill plans in the Daily and other
publications, often with the false
assumption that land development
on the one hand precludes
low-income housing on the other.
Because of the interest that has
been generated in this
question—and because many of
the articles have contained
misleading or erroneous
information—it is important to
know the University's exact plans
for the area. It is also important
to relate Coyote Hill to the land
conservation issue and to
Stanford's critical need for
income at a time when
educational expenses are far
outstripping revenues.
Coyote Hill Plans
First of all, Coyote Hill will
remain essentially in its natural
state. The Palo Alto Planning
Commission voted on October 22
to change the zoning on the Hill
itself beyond the 12 acres for an
Animal Research Facility from
L-M-5 to A-C. The University had
no objection to this, and in fact
had cooperated with the Planning
Commission in the determination
of the proper zoning. Stanford
placed the bulk of the hill—some
37 acres—in its academic reserve
in 1968. Most of the reserve will
be used for grazing animals. A
12-acre wooded hollow on the
north face of the reserve will be
the site of the Medical School's
Animal Research Facility. It will
be made up of five, one-story
buildings. Landscaping
improvements around them will
cost $50,000.
An 18-hole public golf course
will be built on 30-35 acres along
Deer Gulch Creek west of the hill,
and a 250-foot-wide landscaped
buffer strip will be provided along
Arastradero Road. Between the
Creek and Page Mill Expressway
lies a 90-acre parcel that is under
consideration as a site for
low-income housing. It is not
affected by plans for development
around the hill.
Twelve lots will be developed
on the north, south and west sides
of the hill. They will range in size
from 6.1 to 15.5 acres, well above
the five-acre zoning minimum.
Firms locating on the lots will
relate to the lower slopes in much
the same way that the Friden and
Applied Technology buildings
already do on Hillview Avenue.
These lots will be served by two
roads leading from Hillview
Avenue and Arastradero Road to
Page Mill.
Open Property
Under the L-M-5 zoning
(limited industry, five-acre

minimum lots), only 20% of each
lot can be used for buildings, and
at least 30% must be left open.
When the space for the academic
reserve, golf course, and open
areas are combined, more than
half the total property will be left
open and landscaped even after
the development is completed
sometime in the future.
The Coyote Hill development
has not been suddenly or secretly
conceived. It had its start in the
late 1 950's when the
University—with the approval of
the responsible faculty advisory
committee—concluded that the
Industrial Park should be
extended across Foothill
Expressway. The action was taken
reluctantly, but with the
realization that more of the
Stanford land endowment had to
be used to produce income to
support the educational program.
Stanford pays taxes on the lands
not in academic use (the bill last
year was about $800,000). Its
lands also may be condemned by
surrounding communities. But
under law it cannot sell its
property. Land leasing thus
obtains revenue, offsets taxes and
conserves the property for future
educational use.
The People Speak
In 1960, 280 acres of land on
and around the hill were offered
to the city of Palo Alto for
annexation and zoning. The City
Council passed an ordinance to
bring this about. Later in the year,
the Council's action was upheld in
a public referendum, with 57Vi%
of the 23,827 voters favoring such
use of the land.
The University worked in
support of the measure, for it was
vitally affected by it. Stanford
argued that it should be allowed
to develop a portion of its land,
with new standards that are still
unsurpassed in the country, and in
accordance with the wishes of the
people of the area, to obtain
funds to meet a national public
need—quality education for
youth.
Since that time, there have
been nine separate public actions
relating to the Coyote Hill
property. The University and Palo
Alto cooperated to provide the
site with water and underground
utilities, and in the design of the
two new roads. In 1967, an
adjoining 54-acre parcel was
zoned L-M-5, and in the same year
the Planning Commission and the
City Council refused to rezone the
entire area.
Lot Division
In 1968, a tentative lot division
map was approved by the city.
Last spring, a lot division of four
large parcels was approved,
including the two roads. In July,
Stanford filed for the
miscellaneous lot division of one
parcel and the subdivision of three
parcels. It did so after the City
Attorney ruled that a lot intended
for lease to the Syntex
Corporation actually made up a
fifth parcel, and five-parcel
subdivisions require full
Commission and Council review.
On September 8, the lot division
plans and the first reading of the
subdivision plans were approved
by the Council.
Stanford has spent more than
$1 million on the property after
receiving authorization to proceed
at every step. And for nine years
it has paid the higher L-M-5 taxes
on the property ($35,000 last
year alone).
Hill Moratorium Discussed
Several articles and published
letters about Coyote Hill have

suggested that a moratorium be
declared until after the
completion of a Palo Alto
foothills environmental study in
18-24 months. A moratorium on
foothill land where no
development is under way or
authorized may make sense, and
the University has offered to
delay activities in the 190-acre
open area between Coyote Hill
and the Junipero Serra Freeway
until the study is completed.
But a moratorium on land
established for research park use a
decade ago, and on which the
University has paid higher taxes
and expended funds in good faith
under such zoning, not only
would be unfair, it quite likely
would be illegal. This is especially
so because the University was
granted permission to construct
two new roads serving the area
prior to the approval of the
Environmental Study. Based on
this approval, the University
signed contracts exceeding $1
million.
A moratorium would amount
in fact to the taking of property
without just compensation, for
few if any advocates of the
moratorium have suggested
waiving the future taxes, or
repaying prior taxes and expenses,
or compensating the University
for the income that would be lost
to its schools and departments.
Council Decision
The City Council and Planning
Commission agreed with this
during the summer when both
bodies voted against a
moratorium—as did the Stanford
Faculty Advisory Committee in
September. In taking the position
they did, Council members felt
bound by the votes of the people
and by the several authorizations
given the University to proceed in
the past years.
Proponents of a moratorium
have not sought a total ban on all
work around the hill, incidentally.
They would allow the land to be
used for purposes that they
approve. The animal research
facility, town houses, industrial
park use on the north side, single
family residences, the golf course
and a city park on the west side
have all been found acceptable.
The strip between the Creek and
Page Mill also is under
consideration as the site of a
low-income housing project. Land
conservation therefore is not the
real issue—the real issue is the
University's publicly-approved use
of its own property.
The low-income housing
proposal, it should be emphasized,
is in no way endangered by
Stanford land development.
Several sites on the campus have
been mentioned, none of which
would be taken by land
development in the near future.
Nor will work on Coyote Hill in
any way lessen the University's
ability or intention to alleviate the
shortage of student housing on
the campus. Land development is
far more likely to create resources
for such projects than to divert
resources from them.
I mentioned earlier that more
than half the Coyote Hill area will
be left open. Naturally everyone
(including University officers)
would prefer to find a way to
leave it 100% open. Stanford
already has placed 5200 of its
8200 available acres in academic
reserve, where most of it is
essentially open. At the same
time, only 940 acres of the
remaining 3000 acres are under
lease.
But the fact remains that the
University cannot allow its
non-academic lands to be a
financial liability rather than an
educational asset. Development
around Coyote Hill will produce
about $360,000 a year in
valuable, unrestricted funds. Last
year Stanford's expenses exceeded
its income by $600,000, and this
year the figure will be $1.5
million. In this context, income
from land development is vital.
If Stanford cannot develop its
lands, then the institution will in
effect have to subsidize open
space through reduced programs,
higher tuitions, lower salaries, or
increased gifts and othe income.
There are some who say that is
a contribution the University
should make to society—as if
higher education alone were not.
Ironically, they are often the same
people who insist that the
University assume the added costs
of many other worthy programs.
Such programs may be necessary,
but how are they to be financed?
Are students willing to pay far
more, and employees to earn far
less, as new expenses are incurred

and land development income is
curtailed?
The crux of the land
conservation question is the
payment of property owners to
keep their lands open. Any other
steps are short-range, and often
punitive, answers to the problem.
Society is becoming increasingly
aware of the value of open areas.
That awareness must be translated
into programs to fully compensate
property owners.
This is an objective that will
require great amounts of work
and public education. It is a
constructive task to which those
who earnestly support land
conservation should address
themselves in the future.
Stanford is not developing all
of its land in a wanton manner, or
for private profit, or contrary to
the wishes of the voters. It is
developing some of its land, with
great care, and with the
concurrence of the people, to
advance the education of this and
future generations. The merits of
tha work should be weighed in
any discussion of the use of the
University's land endowment.

its income by $600,000, and this
year the figure will be $1.5
million. In this context, income
from land development is vital.
If Stanford cannot develop its
lands, then the institution will in
effect have to subsidize open
space through reduced programs,
higher tuitions, lower salaries, or
increased gifts and othe income.
There are some who say that is
a contribution the University
should make to society—as if
higher education alone were not.
Ironically, they are often the same
people who insist that the
University assume the added costs
of many other worthy programs.
Such programs may be necessary,
but how are they to be financed?
Are students willing to pay far
more, and employees to earn far
less, as new expenses are incurred

and land development income is
curtailed?
The crux of the land
conservation question is the
payment of property owners to
keep their lands open. Any other
steps are short-range, and often
punitive, answers to the problem.
Society is becoming increasingly
aware of the value of open areas.
That awareness must be translated
into programs to fully compensate
property owners.
This is an objective that will
require great amounts of work
and public education. It is a
constructive task to which those
who earnestly support land
conservation should address
themselves in the future.
Stanford is not developing all
of its land in a wanton manner, or
for private profit, or contrary to
the wishes of the voters. It is
developing some of its land, with
great care, and with the
concurrence of the people, to
advance the education of this and
future generations. The merits of
tha work should be weighed in
any discussion of the use of the
University's land endowment.

Several articles have appeared
in the Daily this summer and fall
about Stanford land development,
particularly as it relates to
long-planned uses of the property
surrounding Coyote Hill in the
southeast corner of the campus.
The low-income housing issue
also has been linked to the Coyote
Hill plans in the Daily and other
publications, often with the false
assumption that land development
on the one hand precludes
low-income housing on the other.
Because of the interest that has
been generated in this
question—and because many of
the articles have contained
misleading or erroneous
information—it is important to
know the University's exact plans
for the area. It is also important
to relate Coyote Hill to the land
conservation issue and to
Stanford's critical need for
income at a time when
educational expenses are far
outstripping revenues.
Coyote Hill Plans
First of all, Coyote Hill will
remain essentially in its natural
state. The Palo Alto Planning
Commission voted on October 22
to change the zoning on the Hill
itself beyond the 12 acres for an
Animal Research Facility from
L-M-5 to A-C. The University had
no objection to this, and in fact
had cooperated with the Planning
Commission in the determination
of the proper zoning. Stanford
placed the bulk of the hill—some
37 acres—in its academic reserve
in 1968. Most of the reserve will
be used for grazing animals. A
12-acre wooded hollow on the
north face of the reserve will be
the site of the Medical School's
Animal Research Facility. It will
be made up of five, one-story
buildings. Landscaping
improvements around them will
cost $50,000.
An 18-hole public golf course
will be built on 30-35 acres along
Deer Gulch Creek west of the hill,
and a 250-foot-wide landscaped
buffer strip will be provided along
Arastradero Road. Between the
Creek and Page Mill Expressway
lies a 90-acre parcel that is under
consideration as a site for
low-income housing. It is not
affected by plans for development
around the hill.
Twelve lots will be developed
on the north, south and west sides
of the hill. They will range in size
from 6.1 to 15.5 acres, well above
the five-acre zoning minimum.
Firms locating on the lots will
relate to the lower slopes in much
the same way that the Friden and
Applied Technology buildings
already do on Hillview Avenue.
These lots will be served by two
roads leading from Hillview
Avenue and Arastradero Road to
Page Mill.
Open Property
Under the L-M-5 zoning
(limited industry, five-acre

minimum lots), only 20% of each
lot can be used for buildings, and
at least 30% must be left open.
When the space for the academic
reserve, golf course, and open
areas are combined, more than
half the total property will be left
open and landscaped even after
the development is completed
sometime in the future.
The Coyote Hill development
has not been suddenly or secretly
conceived. It had its start in the
late 1 950's when the
University—with the approval of
the responsible faculty advisory
committee—concluded that the
Industrial Park should be
extended across Foothill
Expressway. The action was taken
reluctantly, but with the
realization that more of the
Stanford land endowment had to
be used to produce income to
support the educational program.
Stanford pays taxes on the lands
not in academic use (the bill last
year was about $800,000). Its
lands also may be condemned by
surrounding communities. But
under law it cannot sell its
property. Land leasing thus
obtains revenue, offsets taxes and
conserves the property for future
educational use.
The People Speak
In 1960, 280 acres of land on
and around the hill were offered
to the city of Palo Alto for
annexation and zoning. The City
Council passed an ordinance to
bring this about. Later in the year,
the Council's action was upheld in
a public referendum, with 57Vi%
of the 23,827 voters favoring such
use of the land.
The University worked in
support of the measure, for it was
vitally affected by it. Stanford
argued that it should be allowed
to develop a portion of its land,
with new standards that are still
unsurpassed in the country, and in
accordance with the wishes of the
people of the area, to obtain
funds to meet a national public
need—quality education for
youth.
Since that time, there have
been nine separate public actions
relating to the Coyote Hill
property. The University and Palo
Alto cooperated to provide the
site with water and underground
utilities, and in the design of the
two new roads. In 1967, an
adjoining 54-acre parcel was
zoned L-M-5, and in the same year
the Planning Commission and the
City Council refused to rezone the
entire area.
Lot Division
In 1968, a tentative lot division
map was approved by the city.
Last spring, a lot division of four
large parcels was approved,
including the two roads. In July,
Stanford filed for the
miscellaneous lot division of one
parcel and the subdivision of three
parcels. It did so after the City
Attorney ruled that a lot intended
for lease to the Syntex
Corporation actually made up a
fifth parcel, and five-parcel
subdivisions require full
Commission and Council review.
On September 8, the lot division
plans and the first reading of the
subdivision plans were approved
by the Council.
Stanford has spent more than
$1 million on the property after
receiving authorization to proceed
at every step. And for nine years
it has paid the higher L-M-5 taxes
on the property ($35,000 last
year alone).
Hill Moratorium Discussed
Several articles and published
letters about Coyote Hill have

suggested that a moratorium be
declared until after the
completion of a Palo Alto
foothills environmental study in
18-24 months. A moratorium on
foothill land where no
development is under way or
authorized may make sense, and
the University has offered to
delay activities in the 190-acre
open area between Coyote Hill
and the Junipero Serra Freeway
until the study is completed.
But a moratorium on land
established for research park use a
decade ago, and on which the
University has paid higher taxes
and expended funds in good faith
under such zoning, not only
would be unfair, it quite likely
would be illegal. This is especially
so because the University was
granted permission to construct
two new roads serving the area
prior to the approval of the
Environmental Study. Based on
this approval, the University
signed contracts exceeding $1
million.
A moratorium would amount
in fact to the taking of property
without just compensation, for
few if any advocates of the
moratorium have suggested
waiving the future taxes, or
repaying prior taxes and expenses,
or compensating the University
for the income that would be lost
to its schools and departments.
Council Decision
The City Council and Planning
Commission agreed with this
during the summer when both
bodies voted against a
moratorium—as did the Stanford
Faculty Advisory Committee in
September. In taking the position
they did, Council members felt
bound by the votes of the people
and by the several authorizations
given the University to proceed in
the past years.
Proponents of a moratorium
have not sought a total ban on all
work around the hill, incidentally.
They would allow the land to be
used for purposes that they
approve. The animal research
facility, town houses, industrial
park use on the north side, single
family residences, the golf course
and a city park on the west side
have all been found acceptable.
The strip between the Creek and
Page Mill also is under
consideration as the site of a
low-income housing project. Land
conservation therefore is not the
real issue—the real issue is the
University's publicly-approved use
of its own property.
The low-income housing
proposal, it should be emphasized,
is in no way endangered by
Stanford land development.
Several sites on the campus have
been mentioned, none of which
would be taken by land
development in the near future.
Nor will work on Coyote Hill in
any way lessen the University's
ability or intention to alleviate the
shortage of student housing on
the campus. Land development is
far more likely to create resources
for such projects than to divert
resources from them.
I mentioned earlier that more
than half the Coyote Hill area will
be left open. Naturally everyone
(including University officers)
would prefer to find a way to
leave it 100% open. Stanford
already has placed 5200 of its
8200 available acres in academic
reserve, where most of it is
essentially open. At the same
time, only 940 acres of the
remaining 3000 acres are under
lease.
But the fact remains that the
University cannot allow its
non-academic lands to be a
financial liability rather than an
educational asset. Development
around Coyote Hill will produce
about $360,000 a year in
valuable, unrestricted funds. Last
year Stanford's expenses exceeded
its income by $600,000, and this
year the figure will be $1.5
million. In this context, income
from land development is vital.
If Stanford cannot develop its

higher tuitions, lower salaries, or

used for purposes that they
approve. The animal research
facility, town houses, industrial
park use on the north side, single
family residences, the golf course
and a city park on the west side
have all been found acceptable.
The strip between the Creek and
Page Mill also is under
consideration as the site of a
low-income housing project. Land
conservation therefore is not the
real issue—the real issue is the
University's publicly-approved use
of its own property.
The low-income housing
proposal, it should be emphasized,
is in no way endangered by
Stanford land development.
Several sites on the campus have
been mentioned, none of which
would be taken by land
development in the near future.
Nor will work on Coyote Hill in
any way lessen the University's
ability or intention to alleviate the
shortage of student housing on
the campus. Land development is
far more likely to create resources
for such projects than to divert
resources from them.
I mentioned earlier that more
than half the Coyote Hill area will
be left open. Naturally everyone
(including University officers)
would prefer to find a way to
leave it 100% open. Stanford
already has placed 5200 of its
8200 available acres in academic
reserve, where most of it is
essentially open. At the same
time, only 940 acres of the
remaining 3000 acres are under
lease.
But the fact remains that the
University cannot allow its
non-academic lands to be a
financial liability rather than an
educational asset. Development
around Coyote Hill will produce
about $360,000 a year in
valuable, unrestricted funds. Last
year Stanford's expenses exceeded
its income by $600,000, and this
year the figure will be $1.5
million. In this context, income
from land development is vital.
If Stanford cannot develop its
lands, then the institution will in
effect have to subsidize open
space through reduced programs,
higher tuitions, lower salaries, or
increased gifts and othe income.
There are some who say that is
a contribution the University
should make to society—as if
higher education alone were not.
Ironically, they are often the same
people who insist that the
University assume the added costs
of many other worthy programs.
Such programs may be necessary,
but how are they to be financed?
Are students willing to pay far
more, and employees to earn far
less, as new expenses are incurred

and land development income is
curtailed?
The crux of the land
conservation question is the
payment of property owners to
keep their lands open. Any other
steps are short-range, and often
punitive, answers to the problem.
Society is becoming increasingly
aware of the value of open areas.
That awareness must be translated
into programs to fully compensate
property owners.
This is an objective that will
require great amounts of work
and public education. It is a
constructive task to which those
who earnestly support land
conservation should address
themselves in the future.
Stanford is not developing all
of its land in a wanton manner, or
for private profit, or contrary to
the wishes of the voters. It is
developing some of its land, with
great care, and with the
concurrence of the people, to
advance the education of this and
future generations. The merits of
tha work should be weighed in
any discussion of the use of the
University's land endowment.

Several articles have appeared
in the Daily this summer and fall
about Stanford land development,
particularly as it relates to
long-planned uses of the property
surrounding Coyote Hill in the
southeast corner of the campus.
The low-income housing issue
also has been linked to the Coyote
Hill plans in the Daily and other
publications, often with the false
assumption that land development
on the one hand precludes
low-income housing on the other.
Because of the interest that has
been generated in this
question—and because many of
the articles have contained
misleading or erroneous
information—it is important to
know the University's exact plans
for the area. It is also important
to relate Coyote Hill to the land
conservation issue and to
Stanford's critical need for
income at a time when
educational expenses are far
outstripping revenues.
Coyote Hill Plans
First of all, Coyote Hill will
remain essentially in its natural
state. The Palo Alto Planning
Commission voted on October 22
to change the zoning on the Hill
itself beyond the 12 acres for an
Animal Research Facility from
L-M-5 to A-C. The University had
no objection to this, and in fact
had cooperated with the Planning
Commission in the determination
of the proper zoning. Stanford
placed the bulk of the hill—some
37 acres—in its academic reserve
in 1968. Most of the reserve will
be used for grazing animals. A
12-acre wooded hollow on the
north face of the reserve will be
the site of the Medical School's
Animal Research Facility. It will
be made up of five, one-story
buildings. Landscaping
improvements around them will
cost $50,000.
An 18-hole public golf course
will be built on 30-35 acres along
Deer Gulch Creek west of the hill,
and a 250-foot-wide landscaped
buffer strip will be provided along
Arastradero Road. Between the
Creek and Page Mill Expressway
lies a 90-acre parcel that is under
consideration as a site for
low-income housing. It is not
affected by plans for development
around the hill.
Twelve lots will be developed
on the north, south and west sides
of the hill. They will range in size
from 6.1 to 15.5 acres, well above
the five-acre zoning minimum.
Firms locating on the lots will
relate to the lower slopes in much
the same way that the Friden and
Applied Technology buildings
already do on Hillview Avenue.
These lots will be served by two
roads leading from Hillview
Avenue and Arastradero Road to
Page Mill.
Open Property
Under the L-M-5 zoning
(limited industry, five-acre

minimum lots), only 20% of each
lot can be used for buildings, and
at least 30% must be left open.
When the space for the academic
reserve, golf course, and open
areas are combined, more than
half the total property will be left
open and landscaped even after
the development is completed
sometime in the future.
The Coyote Hill development
has not been suddenly or secretly
conceived. It had its start in the
late 1 950's when the
University—with the approval of
the responsible faculty advisory
committee—concluded that the
Industrial Park should be
extended across Foothill
Expressway. The action was taken
reluctantly, but with the
realization that more of the
Stanford land endowment had to
be used to produce income to
support the educational program.
Stanford pays taxes on the lands
not in academic use (the bill last
year was about $800,000). Its
lands also may be condemned by
surrounding communities. But
under law it cannot sell its
property. Land leasing thus
obtains revenue, offsets taxes and
conserves the property for future
educational use.
The People Speak
In 1960, 280 acres of land on
and around the hill were offered
to the city of Palo Alto for
annexation and zoning. The City
Council passed an ordinance to
bring this about. Later in the year,
the Council's action was upheld in
a public referendum, with 57Vi%
of the 23,827 voters favoring such
use of the land.
The University worked in
support of the measure, for it was
vitally affected by it. Stanford
argued that it should be allowed
to develop a portion of its land,
with new standards that are still
unsurpassed in the country, and in
accordance with the wishes of the
people of the area, to obtain
funds to meet a national public
need—quality education for
youth.
Since that time, there have
been nine separate public actions
relating to the Coyote Hill
property. The University and Palo
Alto cooperated to provide the
site with water and underground
utilities, and in the design of the
two new roads. In 1967, an
adjoining 54-acre parcel was
zoned L-M-5, and in the same year
the Planning Commission and the
City Council refused to rezone the
entire area.
Lot Division
In 1968, a tentative lot division
map was approved by the city.
Last spring, a lot division of four
large parcels was approved,
including the two roads. In July,
Stanford filed for the
miscellaneous lot division of one
parcel and the subdivision of three
parcels. It did so after the City
Attorney ruled that a lot intended
for lease to the Syntex
Corporation actually made up a
fifth parcel, and five-parcel
subdivisions require full
Commission and Council review.
On September 8, the lot division
plans and the first reading of the
subdivision plans were approved
by the Council.
Stanford has spent more than
$1 million on the property after
receiving authorization to proceed
at every step. And for nine years
it has paid the higher L-M-5 taxes
on the property ($35,000 last
year alone).
Hill Moratorium Discussed
Several articles and published
letters about Coyote Hill have

suggested that a moratorium be
declared until after the
completion of a Palo Alto
foothills environmental study in
18-24 months. A moratorium on
foothill land where no
development is under way or
authorized may make sense, and
the University has offered to
delay activities in the 190-acre
open area between Coyote Hill
and the Junipero Serra Freeway
until the study is completed.
But a moratorium on land
established for research park use a
decade ago, and on which the
University has paid higher taxes
and expended funds in good faith
under such zoning, not only
would be unfair, it quite likely
would be illegal. This is especially
so because the University was
granted permission to construct
two new roads serving the area
prior to the approval of the
Environmental Study. Based on
this approval, the University
signed contracts exceeding $1
million.
A moratorium would amount
in fact to the taking of property
without just compensation, for
few if any advocates of the
moratorium have suggested
waiving the future taxes, or
repaying prior taxes and expenses,
or compensating the University
for the income that would be lost
to its schools and departments.
Council Decision
The City Council and Planning
Commission agreed with this
during the summer when both
bodies voted against a
moratorium—as did the Stanford
Faculty Advisory Committee in
September. In taking the position
they did, Council members felt
bound by the votes of the people
and by the several authorizations
given the University to proceed in
the past years.
Proponents of a moratorium
have not sought a total ban on all
work around the hill, incidentally.
They would allow the land to be
used for purposes that they
approve. The animal research
facility, town houses, industrial
park use on the north side, single
family residences, the golf course
and a city park on the west side
have all been found acceptable.

Page Mill also is under

Several articles and published
letters about Coyote Hill have

suggested that a moratorium be
declared until after the
completion of a Palo Alto
foothills environmental study in
18-24 months. A moratorium on
foothill land where no
development is under way or
authorized may make sense, and
the University has offered to
delay activities in the 190-acre
open area between Coyote Hill
and the Junipero Serra Freeway
until the study is completed.
But a moratorium on land
established for research park use a
decade ago, and on which the
University has paid higher taxes
and expended funds in good faith
under such zoning, not only
would be unfair, it quite likely
would be illegal. This is especially
so because the University was
granted permission to construct
two new roads serving the area
prior to the approval of the
Environmental Study. Based on
this approval, the University
signed contracts exceeding $1
million.
A moratorium would amount
in fact to the taking of property
without just compensation, for
few if any advocates of the
moratorium have suggested
waiving the future taxes, or
repaying prior taxes and expenses,
or compensating the University
for the income that would be lost
to its schools and departments.
Council Decision
The City Council and Planning
Commission agreed with this
during the summer when both
bodies voted against a
moratorium—as did the Stanford
Faculty Advisory Committee in
September. In taking the position
they did, Council members felt
bound by the votes of the people
and by the several authorizations
given the University to proceed in
the past years.
Proponents of a moratorium
have not sought a total ban on all
work around the hill, incidentally.
They would allow the land to be
used for purposes that they
approve. The animal research
facility, town houses, industrial
park use on the north side, single
family residences, the golf course
and a city park on the west side
have all been found acceptable.
The strip between the Creek and
Page Mill also is under
consideration as the site of a
low-income housing project. Land
conservation therefore is not the
real issue—the real issue is the
University's publicly-approved use
of its own property.
The low-income housing
proposal, it should be emphasized,
is in no way endangered by
Stanford land development.
Several sites on the campus have
been mentioned, none of which
would be taken by land
development in the near future.
Nor will work on Coyote Hill in
any way lessen the University's
ability or intention to alleviate the
shortage of student housing on
the campus. Land development is
far more likely to create resources
for such projects than to divert
resources from them.
I mentioned earlier that more
than half the Coyote Hill area will
be left open. Naturally everyone
(including University officers)
would prefer to find a way to
leave it 100% open. Stanford
already has placed 5200 of its
8200 available acres in academic
reserve, where most of it is
essentially open. At the same
time, only 940 acres of the
remaining 3000 acres are under
lease.
But the fact remains that the
University cannot allow its
non-academic lands to be a
financial liability rather than an
educational asset. Development
around Coyote Hill will produce
about $360,000 a year in
valuable, unrestricted funds. Last
year Stanford's expenses exceeded
its income by $600,000, and this
year the figure will be $1.5
million. In this context, income
from land development is vital.
If Stanford cannot develop its
lands, then the institution will in
effect have to subsidize open
space through reduced programs,
higher tuitions, lower salaries, or
increased gifts and othe income.
There are some who say that is
a contribution the University
should make to society—as if
higher education alone were not.
Ironically, they are often the same
people who insist that the
University assume the added costs
of many other worthy programs.
Such programs may be necessary,
but how are they to be financed?
Are students willing to pay far
more, and employees to earn far
less, as new expenses are incurred

and land development income is
curtailed?
The crux of the land
conservation question is the
payment of property owners to
keep their lands open. Any other
steps are short-range, and often
punitive, answers to the problem.
Society is becoming increasingly
aware of the value of open areas.
That awareness must be translated
into programs to fully compensate
property owners.
This is an objective that will
require great amounts of work
and public education. It is a
constructive task to which those
who earnestly support land
conservation should address
themselves in the future.
Stanford is not developing all
of its land in a wanton manner, or
for private profit, or contrary to
the wishes of the voters. It is
developing some of its land, with
great care, and with the
concurrence of the people, to
advance the education of this and
future generations. The merits of
tha work should be weighed in
any discussion of the use of the
University's land endowment.

Several articles have appeared
in the Daily this summer and fall
about Stanford land development,
particularly as it relates to
long-planned uses of the property
surrounding Coyote Hill in the
southeast corner of the campus.
The low-income housing issue
also has been linked to the Coyote
Hill plans in the Daily and other
publications, often with the false
assumption that land development
on the one hand precludes
low-income housing on the other.
Because of the interest that has
been generated in this
question—and because many of
the articles have contained
misleading or erroneous
information—it is important to
know the University's exact plans
for the area. It is also important
to relate Coyote Hill to the land
conservation issue and to
Stanford's critical need for
income at a time when
educational expenses are far
outstripping revenues.
Coyote Hill Plans
First of all, Coyote Hill will
remain essentially in its natural
state. The Palo Alto Planning
Commission voted on October 22
to change the zoning on the Hill
itself beyond the 12 acres for an
Animal Research Facility from
L-M-5 to A-C. The University had
no objection to this, and in fact
had cooperated with the Planning
Commission in the determination
of the proper zoning. Stanford
placed the bulk of the hill—some
37 acres—in its academic reserve
in 1968. Most of the reserve will
be used for grazing animals. A
12-acre wooded hollow on the
north face of the reserve will be
the site of the Medical School's
Animal Research Facility. It will
be made up of five, one-story
buildings. Landscaping
improvements around them will
cost $50,000.
An 18-hole public golf course
will be built on 30-35 acres along
Deer Gulch Creek west of the hill,
and a 250-foot-wide landscaped
buffer strip will be provided along
Arastradero Road. Between the
Creek and Page Mill Expressway
lies a 90-acre parcel that is under
consideration as a site for
low-income housing. It is not
affected by plans for development
around the hill.
Twelve lots will be developed
on the north, south and west sides
of the hill. They will range in size
from 6.1 to 15.5 acres, well above
the five-acre zoning minimum.
Firms locating on the lots will
relate to the lower slopes in much
the same way that the Friden and
Applied Technology buildings
already do on Hillview Avenue.
These lots will be served by two
roads leading from Hillview
Avenue and Arastradero Road to
Page Mill.
Open Property
Under the L-M-5 zoning
(limited industry, five-acre

minimum lots), only 20% of each
lot can be used for buildings, and
at least 30% must be left open.
When the space for the academic
reserve, golf course, and open
areas are combined, more than
half the total property will be left
open and landscaped even after
the development is completed
sometime in the future.
The Coyote Hill development
has not been suddenly or secretly
conceived. It had its start in the
late 1 950's when the
University—with the approval of
the responsible faculty advisory
committee—concluded that the
Industrial Park should be
extended across Foothill
Expressway. The action was taken
reluctantly, but with the
realization that more of the
Stanford land endowment had to
be used to produce income to
support the educational program.
Stanford pays taxes on the lands
not in academic use (the bill last
year was about $800,000). Its
lands also may be condemned by
surrounding communities. But
under law it cannot sell its
property. Land leasing thus
obtains revenue, offsets taxes and
conserves the property for future
educational use.
The People Speak
In 1960, 280 acres of land on
and around the hill were offered
to the city of Palo Alto for
annexation and zoning. The City
Council passed an ordinance to
bring this about. Later in the year,
the Council's action was upheld in
a public referendum, with 57Vi%
of the 23,827 voters favoring such
use of the land.
The University worked in
support of the measure, for it was
vitally affected by it. Stanford
argued that it should be allowed
to develop a portion of its land,
with new standards that are still
unsurpassed in the country, and in
accordance with the wishes of the
people of the area, to obtain
funds to meet a national public
need—quality education for
youth.
Since that time, there have
been nine separate public actions
relating to the Coyote Hill
property. The University and Palo
Alto cooperated to provide the
site with water and underground
utilities, and in the design of the
two new roads. In 1967, an
adjoining 54-acre parcel was
zoned L-M-5, and in the same year
the Planning Commission and the
City Council refused to rezone the
entire area.
Lot Division
In 1968, a tentative lot division
map was approved by the city.
Last spring, a lot division of four
large parcels was approved,
including the two roads. In July,
Stanford filed for the
miscellaneous lot division of one
parcel and the subdivision of three
parcels. It did so after the City
Attorney ruled that a lot intended
for lease to the Syntex
Corporation actually made up a
fifth parcel, and five-parcel
subdivisions require full
Commission and Council review.
On September 8, the lot division
plans and the first reading of the
subdivision plans were approved
by the Council.
Stanford has spent more than
$1 million on the property after
receiving authorization to proceed
at every step. And for nine years
it has paid the higher L-M-5 taxes
on the property ($35,000 last
year alone).
Hill Moratorium Discussed
Several articles and published
letters about Coyote Hill have

suggested that a moratorium be
declared until after the
completion of a Palo Alto

support of the measure, for it was
vitally affected by it. Stanford
argued that it should be allowed
to develop a portion of its land,
with new standards that are still
unsurpassed in the country, and in
accordance with the wishes of the
people of the area, to obtain
funds to meet a national public
need—quality education for
youth.
Since that time, there have
been nine separate public actions
relating to the Coyote Hill
property. The University and Palo
Alto cooperated to provide the
site with water and underground
utilities, and in the design of the
two new roads. In 1967, an
adjoining 54-acre parcel was
zoned L-M-5, and in the same year
the Planning Commission and the
City Council refused to rezone the
entire area.
Lot Division
In 1968, a tentative lot division
map was approved by the city.
Last spring, a lot division of four
large parcels was approved,
including the two roads. In July,
Stanford filed for the
miscellaneous lot division of one
parcel and the subdivision of three
parcels. It did so after the City
Attorney ruled that a lot intended
for lease to the Syntex
Corporation actually made up a
fifth parcel, and five-parcel
subdivisions require full
Commission and Council review.
On September 8, the lot division
plans and the first reading of the
subdivision plans were approved
by the Council.
Stanford has spent more than
$1 million on the property after
receiving authorization to proceed
at every step. And for nine years
it has paid the higher L-M-5 taxes
on the property ($35,000 last
year alone).
Hill Moratorium Discussed
Several articles and published
letters about Coyote Hill have

suggested that a moratorium be
declared until after the
completion of a Palo Alto
foothills environmental study in
18-24 months. A moratorium on
foothill land where no
development is under way or
authorized may make sense, and
the University has offered to
delay activities in the 190-acre
open area between Coyote Hill
and the Junipero Serra Freeway
until the study is completed.
But a moratorium on land
established for research park use a
decade ago, and on which the
University has paid higher taxes
and expended funds in good faith
under such zoning, not only
would be unfair, it quite likely
would be illegal. This is especially
so because the University was
granted permission to construct
two new roads serving the area
prior to the approval of the
Environmental Study. Based on
this approval, the University
signed contracts exceeding $1
million.
A moratorium would amount
in fact to the taking of property
without just compensation, for
few if any advocates of the
moratorium have suggested
waiving the future taxes, or
repaying prior taxes and expenses,
or compensating the University
for the income that would be lost
to its schools and departments.
Council Decision
The City Council and Planning
Commission agreed with this
during the summer when both
bodies voted against a
moratorium—as did the Stanford
Faculty Advisory Committee in
September. In taking the position
they did, Council members felt
bound by the votes of the people
and by the several authorizations
given the University to proceed in
the past years.
Proponents of a moratorium
have not sought a total ban on all
work around the hill, incidentally.
They would allow the land to be
used for purposes that they
approve. The animal research
facility, town houses, industrial
park use on the north side, single
family residences, the golf course
and a city park on the west side
have all been found acceptable.
The strip between the Creek and
Page Mill also is under
consideration as the site of a
low-income housing project. Land
conservation therefore is not the
real issue—the real issue is the
University's publicly-approved use
of its own property.
The low-income housing
proposal, it should be emphasized,
is in no way endangered by
Stanford land development.
Several sites on the campus have
been mentioned, none of which
would be taken by land
development in the near future.
Nor will work on Coyote Hill in
any way lessen the University's
ability or intention to alleviate the
shortage of student housing on
the campus. Land development is
far more likely to create resources
for such projects than to divert
resources from them.
I mentioned earlier that more
than half the Coyote Hill area will
be left open. Naturally everyone
(including University officers)
would prefer to find a way to
leave it 100% open. Stanford
already has placed 5200 of its
8200 available acres in academic
reserve, where most of it is
essentially open. At the same
time, only 940 acres of the
remaining 3000 acres are under
lease.
But the fact remains that the
University cannot allow its
non-academic lands to be a
financial liability rather than an
educational asset. Development
around Coyote Hill will produce
about $360,000 a year in
valuable, unrestricted funds. Last
year Stanford's expenses exceeded
its income by $600,000, and this
year the figure will be $1.5
million. In this context, income
from land development is vital.
If Stanford cannot develop its
lands, then the institution will in
effect have to subsidize open
space through reduced programs,
higher tuitions, lower salaries, or
increased gifts and othe income.
There are some who say that is
a contribution the University
should make to society—as if
higher education alone were not.
Ironically, they are often the same
people who insist that the
University assume the added costs
of many other worthy programs.
Such programs may be necessary,
but how are they to be financed?
Are students willing to pay far
more, and employees to earn far
less, as new expenses are incurred

and land development income is
curtailed?
The crux of the land
conservation question is the
payment of property owners to
keep their lands open. Any other
steps are short-range, and often
punitive, answers to the problem.
Society is becoming increasingly
aware of the value of open areas.
That awareness must be translated
into programs to fully compensate
property owners.
This is an objective that will
require great amounts of work
and public education. It is a
constructive task to which those
who earnestly support land
conservation should address
themselves in the future.
Stanford is not developing all
of its land in a wanton manner, or
for private profit, or contrary to
the wishes of the voters. It is
developing some of its land, with
great care, and with the
concurrence of the people, to
advance the education of this and
future generations. The merits of
tha work should be weighed in
any discussion of the use of the
University's land endowment.

Real Estate.)
Several articles have appeared
in the Daily this summer and fall
about Stanford land development,
particularly as it relates to
long-planned uses of the property
surrounding Coyote Hill in the
southeast corner of the campus.
The low-income housing issue
also has been linked to the Coyote
Hill plans in the Daily and other
publications, often with the false
assumption that land development
on the one hand precludes
low-income housing on the other.
Because of the interest that has
been generated in this
question—and because many of
the articles have contained
misleading or erroneous
information—it is important to
know the University's exact plans
for the area. It is also important
to relate Coyote Hill to the land
conservation issue and to
Stanford's critical need for
income at a time when
educational expenses are far
outstripping revenues.
Coyote Hill Plans
First of all, Coyote Hill will
remain essentially in its natural
state. The Palo Alto Planning
Commission voted on October 22
to change the zoning on the Hill
itself beyond the 12 acres for an
Animal Research Facility from
L-M-5 to A-C. The University had
no objection to this, and in fact
had cooperated with the Planning
Commission in the determination
of the proper zoning. Stanford
placed the bulk of the hill—some
37 acres—in its academic reserve
in 1968. Most of the reserve will
be used for grazing animals. A
12-acre wooded hollow on the
north face of the reserve will be
the site of the Medical School's
Animal Research Facility. It will
be made up of five, one-story
buildings. Landscaping
improvements around them will
cost $50,000.
An 18-hole public golf course
will be built on 30-35 acres along
Deer Gulch Creek west of the hill,
and a 250-foot-wide landscaped
buffer strip will be provided along
Arastradero Road. Between the
Creek and Page Mill Expressway
lies a 90-acre parcel that is under
consideration as a site for
low-income housing. It is not
affected by plans for development
around the hill.
Twelve lots will be developed
on the north, south and west sides
of the hill. They will range in size
from 6.1 to 15.5 acres, well above
the five-acre zoning minimum.
Firms locating on the lots will
relate to the lower slopes in much
the same way that the Friden and
Applied Technology buildings
already do on Hillview Avenue.
These lots will be served by two
roads leading from Hillview
Avenue and Arastradero Road to
Page Mill.
Open Property
Under the L-M-5 zoning
(limited industry, five-acre

minimum lots), only 20% of each
lot can be used for buildings, and
at least 30% must be left open.
When the space for the academic
reserve, golf course, and open
areas are combined, more than
half the total property will be left
open and landscaped even after
the development is completed
sometime in the future.
The Coyote Hill development
has not been suddenly or secretly
conceived. It had its start in the
late 1 950's when the
University—with the approval of
the responsible faculty advisory
committee—concluded that the
Industrial Park should be
extended across Foothill
Expressway. The action was taken
reluctantly, but with the
realization that more of the
Stanford land endowment had to
be used to produce income to
support the educational program.
Stanford pays taxes on the lands
not in academic use (the bill last
year was about $800,000). Its
lands also may be condemned by
surrounding communities. But
under law it cannot sell its
property. Land leasing thus
obtains revenue, offsets taxes and
conserves the property for future
educational use.
The People Speak
In 1960, 280 acres of land on
and around the hill were offered
to the city of Palo Alto for
annexation and zoning. The City
Council passed an ordinance to
bring this about. Later in the year,
the Council's action was upheld in
a public referendum, with 57Vi%
of the 23,827 voters favoring such
use of the land.
The University worked in
support of the measure, for it was
vitally affected by it. Stanford
argued that it should be allowed
to develop a portion of its land,
with new standards that are still
unsurpassed in the country, and in
accordance with the wishes of the
people of the area, to obtain
funds to meet a national public
need—quality education for
youth.
