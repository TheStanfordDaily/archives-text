Z "Foolish" virgins (yt y)

Z Or more than "just a friend."
YBillig or teuer is your pleasure:
• Your actions depend on your
• own measure
• Of who or what you want to
• be—
• Pre-martial or maritally.
• So as we come to final say,
J You can choose to have your
X way.
#So plunge right in, or just a toe,
J River-swimming can be safe, you
• know.
• So before your body ages and
2 falls,
• You might heed the advice on
J cemetary walls—
• Don't wait until you're
J moribund—
• "Get a lot while you're young."

Stanford girls, the life of love #
Is one ordained from high above*
But sex and other human action#
Need not be seen as morta£
infractions. 5
Do it or drink it or blow
weed— #
Prophets of Doom will find thefi
seed #
of Devils, Cancers lurking withinj
All pleasures of man that theym
call sins. •
So what does cervical sex#
propose,
Beyond activities sans clothes?#
The or foam your fears allay, •
And antibiotics can save the day 4
I
The recommendation is not£
"Carefree" 9
Unless that be your choice— #
But simply that we now know*
much •
That lets you have a voice.
