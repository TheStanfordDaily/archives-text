# The 						AEC Psalm
## 
### Lester Del Rey 
The AEC is my shepherd; I shall
not live.
It maketh me to lie in radiant
pastures;
it leadeth me beside deathly
waters.
It destroyeth my bones; it
leadeth me in the path of
frightfulness for its name's
sake.
Yet, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of
death, I will hea; no evil; for
thou art with me; thy bomb
and thy SAC, they comfort

Thou preparest a fable before*
me in the presence of mine#
enemies; thou anointest thy*
words with oil; my cup#
runneth over. X
Surely, strontium and fallout#
shall follow me all the days of*
my life; and I will dwell in#
the house of the AEC—but*
hardly forever.
