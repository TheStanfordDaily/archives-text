# Ticketron Machine Picks Best Seats
## 
### JESSE CEDARBAUM 
Q. You've found a proverbial
plastic dolly who completely flips
you out and you want to impress
the hell out of her by taking her to
San Francisco for a play or a
concert but you haven't the
faintest idea of where to go or
what you can get tickets for. What
do you do?
A. Troop over to Tresidder box
office (or Mem Aud or Dink) and
consult a very docile, un-hip
looking machine called a
Ticketron Computer!
This amazing machine, recently
installed permanently as a result
of a successful trial run this past
summer, has the unique ability to
select, within seconds, the best
available seats for any one of a
myriad of sports, musical, and
other events not only in San
Francisco, but all up and down
the coast, and with a little effort,
across the length and breadth of
the country as well.
Tickets are available for a wide
range of spectacles such as sports
events; musicals, including HAIR
and Oh! CALCUTTA!; legitimate
theater productions such as ACT;
not-so -1e g i timate theater
productions (one item on the bill
of fare was entitled "An Evening
of Dirty Plays"); and a variety of
special occurrences such as the
Tournament of Roses parade New
Year's Day in Pasadena. About
the only conceivable forms of
entertainment not covered by this
service are the opera, symphony
and concerts at Winterland and
the Fillmore.
The gadget works like this:
You first look over the list of
choices and price ranges. (This is
the longest part of the process if
you don't know what you want.
The machine works a lot faster
than you can make up your
mind.) Then you tell the girl
behind the counter what it is you
want and she goes over to a little
cash-register-like keyboard with a
sinister-looking black box sitting
atop it and punches out a series of
numbers and letters in secret
code.
Within seconds the teletype

printer next to the black box
spews out all pertinent
information such as show, time,
seat numbers and price. If you are
pleased with the result, you
inform the machine's keeper, who
then presses another button
setting the black box in action
and before you know it, you are
the proud owner of the tickets of
your choice.
Tink Ramey, one of the
resident staff of computer-tamers,
enjoys the work and thinks that it
is a great innovation, but she still
has a few doubts. She feels that
the use of the computer
de-humanizes the act of ticket
buying.
Tink is not the only one afraid
of the wonderful gadget. It seems
that the greatest difficulty in
putting the system into operation
has been "getting the little old
ladies who work in the box offices
to even touch the thing." But for
one who has been born and raised
in the computer-mass media age,
Ticketron is indeed a great
time-saver and convenience.
