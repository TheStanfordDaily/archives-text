BERKELEY—A 95-year-old gold
University Medal has disappeared
mysteriously from a locked
display case in the Campanile at
the University of California at
Berkeley. The loss was reported at
8:30 a.m. Sunday by Harold
Lyman, Campanile guide.
The medallion is one of only
two in the University's possession
and was the fourth awarded in the
now near century-old tradition of
honoring the outstanding
undergraduate at Berkeley. The
missing medal is inches in
diameter and bears the worlds
"University of California, Thomas
F. Barry, 1874," along with the
former sunburst UC seal.
UC Archivist James R. K.
Kantor described the medallion as
of little market value, but of great
interest and historical value to the
University. The only other such
medal in the archives is from
1886.
UC Police speculate that the
disappearance of the medal and its
traveling box may have been a
Stanford trick for Big Game
Week. The Campanile has long
been a target for Big Game stunts,
with locked cases a particularly
intriguing target.
Archivist Kantor will accept
the medal back "with no
questions asked." It can be
returned to any campus office
with Kantor's name on it in
exchange for his heartfelt thanks.
