### 
) PROVO, Utah (AP)- Reacting to repeated racial protests,
.Brigham Young University officials have decided to step up athletic
I recruiting among Negroes.
They stressed, however, that Negroes have always been welcome
Sat the Mormon-owned school and that the latest drive is simply an
.effort to make that policy more widely known.
' First hint of the new recruiting drive came early Tuesday
when President Ernest L. Wilkinson issued a s'/2-page
> statement re enforcing earlier statements that blacks are welcome
at BYU.
â–  During the past two years, BYU has been the target of repeated
protests staged in conjunction with athletic contests.
} The protests have been centered around a policy of the Church
, of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Mormon barring Negroes from
its priesthood, a position all other male members are expected to
1 attain.
i BYU is operated by the church and about 95 per cent of its
25,000 students are church members.
In October, 14 Negro players were dropped from the University
of Wyoming football team for participating in a demonstration
i against BYU. And earlier this month, Stanford University
it would schedule no more athletic events with BYU
until the Mormon Church begins accepting Negroes into the
112 priesthood.
