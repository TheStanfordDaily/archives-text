# China Vies With Russia For Extension of Power

Professor Harold Rood, in a
presentation Monday on the
''Military and Political
Implications of the Nuclear Age,"
comi < 'ted extensively on the
rapid irrowing split between
Sovie. sia and Red China, and
on tlw ireat that this conflict
poses to rest of the world.
Rood, a professor at Claremont
College and a Fellow at the
Stanford Research Institute,
opened his talk with detailed
background information on the
nature of past and present
Federations in the Western world,
including the United Kingdom
and the United States.
He likened Red China with its
vast areas, diversity of culture,
and many problems, to these two
federations, and noted that up to
1949 China had been disjointed at
best.
But since 1949, when the
Communists assumed power, the
aims of the Chinese people have
been unified and consolidated.
According to Dr. Rood these
goals include a unified
centralization of power, and the
establishment of common
ideological beliefs; an extension of
the power of administration from

Peking to the farthest frontiers;
the modernization and
industrialization of China in order
to bring the fruits of technology
to the people; and the extension
of Chinese influence into the
territories on its periphery in
order to maintain control over the
frontier and to regain territory
lost in war.
Mongolia occupies an
incredibly critical position on the
border between China and the
Soviet Union. The state is
currently aligned with China
politically, and looms as a major
bone of contention for the two
great powers, according to Dr.
Rood.
Mongolia serves as a buffer
state, and this role becomes
increasingly important as tensions
between Russia and China mount.
"The only thing worse than
being in a war is losing one,"
observed Dr. Rood, "and the
desire for buffer states is great.
The loyalty of the people in
Mongolia is ambiguous, each
power is trying to turn them
against the other."
"China holds to the claim of
leadership in the Third World.
They accuse the Soviets of having
betrayed the basic tenets of
Marxism. The Soviets see
themselves as the fountainhead of
Marxist-Leninist philosophy and
as the European shield against the
'Yellow Horde.' The result is the
competitive support of wars of
liberation and a sharp and bitter
rivalry with the real threat of a
nuclear war."

According to Dr. Rood these
goals include a unified
centralization of power, and the
establishment of common
ideological beliefs; an extension of
the power of administration from

Peking to the farthest frontiers;
the modernization and
industrialization of China in order
to bring the fruits of technology
to the people; and the extension
of Chinese influence into the
territories on its periphery in
order to maintain control over the
frontier and to regain territory
lost in war.
Mongolia occupies an
incredibly critical position on the
border between China and the
Soviet Union. The state is
currently aligned with China
politically, and looms as a major
bone of contention for the two
great powers, according to Dr.
Rood.
Mongolia serves as a buffer
state, and this role becomes
increasingly important as tensions
between Russia and China mount.
"The only thing worse than
being in a war is losing one,"
observed Dr. Rood, "and the
desire for buffer states is great.
The loyalty of the people in
Mongolia is ambiguous, each
power is trying to turn them
against the other."
"China holds to the claim of
leadership in the Third World.
They accuse the Soviets of having
betrayed the basic tenets of
Marxism. The Soviets see
themselves as the fountainhead of
Marxist-Leninist philosophy and
as the European shield against the
'Yellow Horde.' The result is the
competitive support of wars of
liberation and a sharp and bitter
rivalry with the real threat of a
nuclear war."
