# National Strategy Proposal
## Money Reform Asked 
### 
The U.S. should replace
income taxes with consumption
taxes, repeal anti-trust and labor
laws, insure the supply of money
to all corporations as long as they
are profitable, tmd adopt a free
trade policy, as part of a national
strategy to solve social and
economic problems.
So said management consultant
Bruce D. Henderson, president of
the Boston Consulting Group, in a
speech before a dinner gathering
of Graduate School of Business
students last Thursday.
Henderson, an expert on
corporate strategy and planning,
told the students, "The U.S. must
maximize its economic growth to
generate the resources necessary
to resolve the social—and
predominantly
economic—conflicts the system is
presently preoccupied with, as
well as to establish a viable and
lasting equilibrium within the
system as a whole."
Increased productivity, rather
than diversion of confiscation of
resources, is the key factor in
society's ability to improve itself,
he argued. He said the nation
could eliminate poverty, provide
health and security and education,
and raise the level of satisfaction
with the environment, but that
past answers would not do.
"The answer has always been,
'take from those who have and
give to those who do not.' This is
no answer at all and it has never
really worked," he said.
"Attempts to do this produce
bitterness, internal strife and
stresses on the system as a whole.
Worse still, the effort to
confiscate or divert resources
often dissipates, destroys or stops
the production of those very
resources.
Henderson said he was not
optimistic about the future
because of what he called the slow
growth rate of the U.S. economy.
"If increased productivity is the
measure of our hope, then
American doesn't have much
hope," he claimed. He said none
of the industrialized nations are
increasing productivity as slowly
as the U.S. and the United
Kingdom, and that comparative

trends have become progressively
less favorable for several
generations. "If continued for
another generation or two, the
U.S. and U.K. will become the
least affluent of the industrial
countries," Henderson predicted
"Our economic and social
performance cannot be
significantly changed by
optimization of individual
elements of our culture,"
Henderson said. "We must
optimize the system as a whole."
He said three main things had
to be done: defer consumption in
order to create capital to invest in
the future, divert all investment
into the most productive areas,
and prevent the distribution or
allocation of the benefits of
increased output from seriously
interfering with the creation of
increased output. In short, our
social objectives must not be
defeated.
He said the principal change
will have to take place in tax
policy, anti-trust objectives,
monetary controls, labor law and
tariff regulations, and suggested
taking the following actions in
each of these areas:
Taxes—Eliminate all taxes on
money at work. Place taxes only
on consumption by
consumers —that is, a sales tax.
Social distribution of the burden
can be made by the disposition of
the proceeds rather than by
exemptions or by a progressive
scale on the tax. The problem is
to increase investment and capital
formation while restricting
consumption at the end-user level.
Anti-trust—Repeal present
laws, substituting administrative
guidance so that as a business
becomes a major market fact,
make its dividend payout and new
debt utilization a subject of
government approval.
Monetary pol icy-Insure
supply of money to major
companies as long as they are
profitable. If they fail to be
profitable, let the government
exercise the control of the banker.

Labor law—Eliminate present
laws entirely and start over. Make
lifetime security and mutual
company-employee dependence
the prime objective, and cause the
man and the company to identify
themselves with each other. The
Anglo-American system of
unionism, labor rigidity, feather
bedding, work stoppage and
industrial strife is the worst of all
systes for everyone including
labor. We should destroy the
myth that our labor policy needs
to create jobs and/or wages. The
real problem is to increase
productivity and prevent labor
shortage from upsetting the
economy and increasing inflation.
Tariff and trade —Go for free
trade. If other people want to sell
us their labor cheap, then buy it.
We must always export as many
dollars as we import. Therefore
exchange rates must be the
variable to keep the balance as
both productivity and inflation
rates change between countries.
Free trade maximizes the
productivity of labor and the
stanfard of living even if others
erect tariff barriers.
The place to start the dialog on
a new national economic and
social strategy is in the graduate
schools of business, Henderson
told the students. "The new
generation of businessmen coming
from the business schools offers
the only reasonable hope of a new
and more fruitful society. They
have the need to understand the
system as a whole. They have the
educational background to discuss
it with a faculty which can
confront them with the real
world."
He urged students to spend
time in the Peace Corps, the
ghetto and military service, to
learn about people, their feeling,
their beliefs, and behavior. "But
don't spend too much time there
because that is not where the
economic and social war is going
to be won. Go where the concepts
are being hammered out. Go
where the ideas are being tested.
Join the debate on the whole
system."
