# Sato Has 'Bought Off' Protest

The new Japanese-U.S. treaty
for the return of Okinawa has
allowed Prime Minister Eisaku
Sato to buy off the protest
movement, Seiichiro Takagi told a
meeting of the Committee for
Concerned Asian Scholars
Monday.
Seiichiro, a Japanese graduate
student in political science, said
the Japanese student movement
was factionalized. The new
extension of the security pact
creates no date it can be debated
until 1980 and without a
catalyzing date, it would be
difficult to organize a large
demonstration.
A member commented that
student demonstrations in Japan
have been traditionally ritualistic,
with the students and the police
playing set roles. There was
indiscriminate violence in the last
demonstration, which he believed
would "turn a lot of people off."
Seiichiro added that protest
will continue, but not as
successfully; it may turn to
domestic issues or university
reform.
Although the Security Pact
originally reduced the number of
American troops in Japan,
| Seiichiro said, the people closest
to the military bases and the left
felt their residual presence was an
extension of the occupation.
As a result, the treaty was

revised in 1960. By the revision,
the U.S. could no longer put
down domestic unrest and would
need the prior consent of the
Japanese government for military
activities. The latest controversy
arose from the provision allowing
either party to give notice after
ten years that it wanted to
terminate the agreements.
Seiichiro said proponents of
the Security Pact note that under
the treaty Japan has never been
invaded, and the money saved
from defense has been put into
business. Japan currently spends
0.9% of its gross national product
on defense, compared with 10% in
the U.S. and 2.5% in Switzerland.
These arguments, he added,
assume that Japan needs arms.
Arguments against the treaty,
he said, are that China sees
American bases as signs of
imperialist aggression; good
Chinese-Japanese relations are
essential to Japan's security.
Those against the treaty say
the U.S. presence brings social
evils. U.S. bases, smuggling, and
theft from police, are the only
source of guns for Japanese
criminals, he said. Other
complaints arise when U.S. planes
crash into houses. He added that
there is prostitution in the vicinity
of bases. Further, the U.S. use of
Japan as a staging area has
involved Japan in the Vietnam
war.

Extending the Security Pact is
supported by the Liberal
Democrat Party (LDP), which has
a majority of the seats in both
houses. Seiichiro said LDP is a
complex party including hawks,
reactionaries, and modern
conservatives.
Major opposition, he said, is
from the Socialist party which
supports immediate abrogation of
the pact, and wishes to transform
the small Japanese self defense
force into the equivalent of the
peace corps.
The Social Democrats and the
Clean Government party (political
wing of a radical Buddhist group)
support gradual abrogation of the
treaty, and a relatively neutral
foreign policy. The Communist
party demands abrogation, but a
Japanese army to defend Japan
against imperialism.
Poll Favors Extension
Seiichiro cited a newspaper
poll which stated 7% of the
people support longterm
extension of the treaty, 38%

support the present, automatic
extension, 28% want gradual
abrogation of the pact, 15%
support an immediate end, and
12% have various other opinions.
Concerning Japanese foreign
policy, 21% wish to raise the self
defense force, 19% want
neutrality and no U.S. bases, 9%
want unarmed neutrality, 10%
support the Communist position,
and 17% are undecided. 50%
believe the pact adds to their
security, 23% believe it does not,
14% believe the pact puts Japan in
more danger.
A member said he was not
displeased that the pact was
extended, because an abrogation
would allow Japanese hawks to
demand an independent nuclear
arms potential for Japan. A poll
showed public support for
Japanese nuclear arms has gone
down; 2% want them
immediately, 27% want them
"sometime," and 46% believe
Japan should never have nuclear
arms.
