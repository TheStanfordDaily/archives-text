# Radicals Haggle Over GE, Ideology
## 
### 
After the usual ousting of the
Palo Alto Times reporter, the
Stanford SDS discussed future
demonstrations against General
Electric and the direction of SDS
activity for the rest of the year.
There was a call for help in
picketing a GE store with the
union, but very little response
from the audience. Also
mentioned was the possibility of
going to Berkeley to participate in
demonstrations with Berkeley
SDS against GE recruiters.
Berkeley wished help from the
Stanford SDS because most
members of the Berkeley SDS
were well known to the local
police.
There was talk of working on
the Coyote Hill issue, or of
working for more low-income
housing for the employees of
Stanford, but no definite plans
were made.
Most of the evening was
occupied by a discussion of the
ideology of the SDS. There
seemed to be two factions, those
who wanted the SDS activity to
be concentrated on local issues,
and those who wanted in
concentrated on labor and

national issues. One member
emphasized the need to bring
more Stanford students into
demonstrations and to go into
dorms and recruit new members.
He felt local issues that would
involve students directly would
help to develop enthusiasm.
Others felt that the SDS should
work for a socialist revolution,
concentrating more on the labor
front. Only a few of those present
were participating in the
discussion.
Peter Z. Bulkeley, dean of
students at Stanford, called the
eviction of the reporter "really
unfortunate and contrary to the
long established practices at the
University."
Robert Beyers, head of the
Stanford news service which
frequently deals with meetings,
said the University assumes
publicly announced meetings are
open to reporters unless the
announcement specifically states
they are restricted to members
and invited guests.
Beyers said the "selective
exclusion of an individual reporter
from a public event at the
University is regrettable."
