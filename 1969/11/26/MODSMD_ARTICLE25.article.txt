# 'Wrong-Way Commuters' Organize
## 
### 
Wrong-way commuters are
prospering in the Stanford area.
And they've found a way to beat
the early-morning traffic hassle.
"Wrong-way commuters" are
those who live in San Francisco
and the East Bay areas and work
at Stanford or environs. So when
the great morning and evening
herds of lemming-like "right-way"
commuters are either going to or
from San Francisco, these
wrong-way ladies and gentlemen
are relaxed and easy in their own
chartered buses, going in the
opposite direction.
There are two charter bus
services available. One, currently
in charge of Gary McDonough,
administrative assistant at
Stanford's Electronic Research
Laboratories, marks its 10th
anniversary this year. It uses a
South Shore Lines bus called
"The Wrong-Way Commuter"
(WWC).
The second, called the
"Society for the Preservation of
Berkeley Commuters," SPBC for
short, was established about three

years ago by Dr. Frank Chilton, a
Stanford Research Institute staff
member, and Robert Wrigley, who
works at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration
(NASA) facility at Moffett Field.
They use a bus from Peerless
Stage Lines.
Several Stops
The SPBC has a little more
sophisticated route and serves a
little wider area than the WWC.
The former, for example, makes
five stops in Berkeley, one each in
Oakland, Hayward, Newark and
Menlo Park (SRI), three stops in
Palo Alto including Stanford, as
well as at NASA and
Lockheed-Sunnyvale.
As McDonough explains it in
an information sheet about the
WWC: "In 1959, a group of
Stanford Research Institute
employees who lived in San
Francisco decided after years of
coping with freeway madness and
the vagaries of SP and Greyhound
commuting to charter a bus to
provide transportation from their
homes in the city to their jobs in
Menlo Park.

"Their idea was received with
such enthusiasm by others like
themselves that they soon had 40
riders and an established,
dependable bus service. Eligibility
was not limited to SRI employees
but was expanded to include
anyone in the Menlo Park/Palo
Alto area who cared to sign up."
The same payload of
passengers, McDonough reported
recently, makes today's daily ride,
plus or minus a few who change
jobs or make other arrangements.
Special Advantages
''We have 'front door
delivery," McDonough reports,
"and though the costs are about
the same as Greyhound, we have
several advantages—comfortable
seats for sleeping, good
conversation, and a Friday night
cocktail hour."
The WWC makes eight stops in
San Francisco, morning and
evening, then proceeds direct to
Menlo Park where it stops at
Upjohn Laboratories, VA
Hospital, SRI, U.S. Geological
Survey and others, and on the

campus at the Shopping Center,
Medical Center and the Memorial
Court entrance to the Quad.
The same thinking governs the
East Bay bus, which at one time a
couple of years ago had a daily
complement of professional men,
scientists and engineers. As Dr.
Chilton wrote in the SPBC
information sheet:
"Nearly half of our present
contingent holds a Ph.D. degree.
We have a physicist who works on
laser holography (3-D
photography), who is also an
amateur jazz musician and
composer .. .a theoretical
physicist who also works in
biology and uses the time on the
bus to read and dictate a book on
his speciality; a physicist studying
meteorites who has studied the
first samples from the moon —and
who also is a part-time staff
member of the Berkeley
Barb ..."


WRONG WAY—Commuters step off chartered bus after leisurely
ride to campus, foregoing the usual struggle with the crowded
freeways.
