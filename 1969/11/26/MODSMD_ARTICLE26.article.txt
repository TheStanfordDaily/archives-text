## New Sounds: Roman & MJQ 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Here are four good new albums
that may have slipped your
notice. First the funny one, then
the musical ones.
Murray Roman is a grown-up
Bill Cosby, taking our lives apart
and letting us look at them with
his flashlight. His record, called
"A Blind Man's Movie," takes a
swing at the sacred, including the
Church, the Los Angeles Police
Department, and the sweetheart
of Bayshore, Ralph Williams. Even
the album jacket, a double-size
all-black affair, hits the monotone
of a recent big release from Apple.
My favorite cut, a quick,
punchy one that puts down TV,
the War, and advertising all at
once, follows the line "you could
sell us a war . . .This is John
Cameron Swayze, here in North
Vietnam. We're just about to tie a
Timex to Pham Lun Duck, a
North Vietnamese infiltrator,
about to go down the Ho trail.
Good luck, Pham . . .Six months
later. . .There's the dead body of
Pham, Notice, though, that the
Timex is still working . . ."
Murray Roman has a quick wit,

a beautiful delivery, lots of great
voices and sharp material. He
attacks institutions more than
people (Ralph Williams is
definitely an institution), so it is
easy to relax in Roman's presence.
The album is on
Tetragrammaton, and you may
have to search a bit for it.
Ramblin' .Music
Dan Levitt and Marc McClure,
two young musicians from
Southern California, have cut
their first disc on Warner Bros.
They play guitars and banjo and
sing, music that is a peaceful
blend of folk and soft rock. Much
influenced by Buffalo Springfield
and Pete Seeger, their sound is
akin to that of Crosby, Stills,
Nash and Young in their
acoustical sets.
This is the music I like to call
"ramblin' music," for it gives the
easy, loping at-ease feeling that
the term brings to mind.
Levitt and McClure's voices
blend perfectly, and their musical
styles and timing are beautifully

together. The instrumental songs
are the best parts of the album,
though. Levitt's own composition,
"Reflections," is a haunting,
wistful piece; Pete Seeger's
"Living in the Country" (the title
song) is a simple, graceful number,
matchlessly performed on this
album.
Levitt and McClure don't come
from Nashville and didn't learn to
play at the knee of some blind
bluesman. They were part of the
folk revival that swept many of us
a few years back. But after
learning the songs and the
instruemnts, these two went on to
progress, improve, evolve a style
and create music.
If you like finger-picking guitar
and banjo, get hold of this album,
"Living in the Country" on
Warner Bros., by Levitt and
McClu re.
Well-Buffed Jazz
The group with one of the
highest polishes ever imparted to a

musical group is the Modern Jazz
Quartet. In their new album,
"Space," on Apple, the MJQ plays
with the same impeccable style
that has characterized their work
for the last fourteen years.
Some of the songs are familiar;
"Visitor from Mars" and "Visitor
from Venus" highlighted their
appearances at the Monterey Jazz
Festival and here on campus last
month. It is a well-engineered
album, and Milt Jackson's vibes
are clear and distinct, which is
often not the case at personal
appearances.
Some people resent the careful,
rehearsed sound of the MJQ,
saying that improvisation is an
intrinsic part of jazz, and the MJQ
lacks this factor. The criticism is
only valid if you like all your jazz
groups to sound the same; the
MJQ, however, offers a clean,
harmonious, predictable sound, in
direct contrast to a group like the
Miles Davis Quintet. Jazz,
however, is certainly big enough
for at least two interpretations.


FINGER-PICKLINGâ€”Dan Levitt and Marc McClure, two young
musicians from Southern California, have cut their first record with
Warner Brothers in a sound which similar to Crosby, Stills, Nash and
Young, creates a blend of folk and soft rock music.
