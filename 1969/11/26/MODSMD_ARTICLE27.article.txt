## Criticism of Critics 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I want to protest the DAILY's
music, art and drama reviews, the
majority of which are too often
puerile in content and fatuous in
style.
I regret to single out Terry
Rustin in particular but his review
,l Alek sander Slobodyanik:
Dazzling," which appeared in last
Friday's DAILY, is typical of
what I mean.
The concert was a solo recital
given a week ago in San Francisco
by a young Soviet pianist called
Slobodyanik and featured works
by Beethoven, Chopin, Prokofiev,
and Moussorgsky. Slobodyanik
plays fast, loud, and
accurately—dazzling, if you
prefer—but he lacks elegance,
variety, and sense of style to a
very noticeable degree, no matter
what your artistic standards.
Pianist is Insensitive
In purely technical terms, for
instance, Slobodyanik tends to
use sharp forward strokes to
attack the keys, which makes his
playing monotonously percussive.
In his interpretation, he tend to
rely on tricks like surprise attacks
in which he suddenly lurches his
whole body at the keys—very
effective if used occasionally but
painful if done time and time
again. He seems to make a point
of using abrupt changes in tempo
and dynamics to disrupt a lyric
line, and he does this so
consistently that even his Chopin
was unmelodious and sounded
more like M oussorgsky's
"Gnome" (which incidentally he
played very well). In short,
Slobodyanik's playing was earthy
and insensitive.
Rustin in contract calls
Slobodyanik "the best Soviet
pianist since Richter" and
possibly "the greatest interpreter
of Chopin today." He may be
doing his bit for Soviet-American
relations, but in his criticism he is
dead wrong. He has inexcusably
fallen into the trap of mistaking
technique for art, of seeking the
blurred hands and hearing the
tremendous noise and calling it
"true greatness."
It is an error all too typical of
music critics these days, raised
perhaps too much on the bread
and wine of the jazz and rock
sound. The values of our modern
music—its rhythm, its sheer
acoustical impact, its emotional
release are not to be discounted,
but, influenced by these values,
too many Terry Rustins turn a
largely uncomprehending ear to
classical music.
Classical Music Aristocratic
Let's face it, classical music is

different. It isn't groovy or
far-out; it isn't meant to be
popularized into Moonlight
Sonatas or Clair de Lunes; it isn't
meant to be "swingle-sung." We
must remember that classical
music is essentially a product of
an aristocratic age, whether in
cahoots with it like the music the
music of Chopin or in reaction to
it like the music of Moussorgsky.
That is, it has a subtle but
essentially aristocratic flavor,
without which elegance,
sophistication and lyricism lose
their meaning and become
unnecessary. Without this flavor
all that remains is a sterile
virtuosity which tries to graft the
rhythmical, acoustical and
emotional values of more popular
music onto an unreceptive
classical tradition.
Both Slobodyanik and his
reviewer are guilty of this error.
No wonder then that Rustin
praises the pianist in terms of the
"sheer force" with which he
emulated an entire orchestra in
Moussorgsky's Pictures! And yet
how different this virtuosity is
from the cultured and masterful
virtuosity of a Liszt or a Richter!
Is it vain to hope for future
DAILY reviews which avoid the
trite verbiage of "amazing
performances," "cascades of
virtuosity," and "true greatness,"
and instead offer trenchant
criticism which really gets at the
heart of what classical music is all
about?

Rustin's Reply
I was pleased to read Mr.
Malozemoff's comments on he
piano concert of Mr. Slobodyanik.
While there is no point in debating
matters of fact, matters of
opinion can be discussed. Mr.
Malozemoff and I clearly agree on
the facts of Mr. Slobodyanik's
performance; it is only in our
respective opinions of its quality
that we differ. Both opinions are
equally valid, since there is no
absolute standard of musical
artistry by which to measure a
performance.
