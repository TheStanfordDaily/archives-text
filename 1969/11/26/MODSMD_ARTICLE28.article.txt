# SRT's 3rd Offering
## 'Androcle' To Open 
### 
Flower power and psychedelia
abound as the Stanford Repertory
Theater ushers in the Christmas
Season with their production of
Bernard Shaw's "Androcles and
the Lion" opening Dec. 3 for a
three week run in Memorial Hall.
Written as a Christmas
pantomime, "Androcles and the
Lion" is based on the tale of a
meek but kindly tailor, Androcles,
who befriends a lion by pulling a
giant thorn from its paw.
Directed by England's Denis
Carey, who is at Stanford as a
guest lecturer in the Department
of Speech and Drama, the play is
full of music and farce. As Carey
says, the comedy "is more
up-to-date, more pertinant than it
has ever been since it was
written," adding that it is "an
irresistable parably for today,"
bringing to mind youth's struggle
in modern society.

With costumes by Douglas
Russell, set by Thomas Osborne
Robinson, music by students John
Carney and Hugh John McCarten,
and lights by Charles Weeks, the
production is well on its way to
success. Add to their talents the
skill of the actors."
"Androcles and the Lion" will
open SRT's Memorial Hall series
of three plays. Subscriptions are
still available by calling the
Memorial Hall Box Office.
