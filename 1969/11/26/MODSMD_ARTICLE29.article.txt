## The 						New Thanksgiving Dinner 
### ELSIE BAR-RINGER Food Editor 
This year, in a spiro of
democracy, why not break from
tradition and serve your family a
Thanksgiving dinner fit for a
commoner: Italian Pigs' Feet
Bernaise.
This esoteric, tongue-tantal
izing, and ethnic dish is reputedly
a favorite in the homes of many
famous national tongues (hardly a
wonder, since it has a long and
drab history).
The idea for this piece of
gourmet cuisine originated in
South Philadelphia in 1933, when,
under FDR's domestic agricultural
programs, all the scrapple,
hoagies, and pepper-pot soup in
the city vanished.
Well aware of the nutritive
virtue and novelty of well-chewed
toes, Sidney Greenberg,
enterprising South Philadelphia
grocer, started searching the stores
r or pigs' feet. Sure enough he
ound some, which had
takenly been placed 'n a box
carded from the Art Museum.

The box was labelled 'Noli Me
Tangeri.'
Greenberg quickly decided that
the meat came from Italy, and
went home proudly
congratulating himself on having
discovered foreign feet.
At this moment one of those
small coincidences that change
history occurred.
But, here the Greenberg legend
breaks off. All that remains of his
epoch-making discovery is this
recipe:
ITALIAN PIGS' FEET
BERNAISE
8 Italian Pigs 1 feet
4 lbs. butter
2 sprigs parsley
'A cup chopped shalots
'/z cup cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon german ground lemon
rind
3'/; cups vinegar
'/> pinch salt
2 breadcrumbs
Melt half the butter in a frying
pan over medium heat (a Sterno
can-burner usually yields
optimum results). When deep
brown, mince in the pig's feet
slowly. Conoisseurs swear by the
method of lowering the feet in by
a string, but for the average eater
this is optional. Cover and forget.
Mix in semi-small platinum
bowl parsley, pepper, shalots and
lemon rind. Add in breadcrumbs
slowly, stirring constantly. When
thoroughly mixed, place bowl in a
pot of boiling water on the stove.
Leave until breadcrumbs begin to
sizzle.

Take remainder of butter and
melt in another pan. Then add the
vinegar.
If you can look at the results,
pour in the shalots mixture. If
you can't, have a stronger
-stomached friend do it.
Add ice cube. (This is the key
to the success or failure of this
dish. If the cube melts within 30
seconds, you have a good chance
of success. If not, give your dog a
break and throw it out.)

Take sauce off heat and put in
refrigerator.
Then remove the pigs' feet
from the stove.
(Remember the pigs' feet?)
Remove sauce from
refrigerator, cut into cubes and
place around the meat.
Add salt.
Groove.

FEETS FOR A KING—An aspiring Roble chef demonstrates the
intricate method of making the sauce for the latest Thanksgiving dish.
At right, piping hot from the oven, the finished product, minus, of
course, its sauce cubes. This recipe is apparently ag new favorite.
This year, in a spiro of
democracy, why not break from
tradition and serve your family a
Thanksgiving dinner fit for a
commoner: Italian Pigs' Feet
Bernaise.
This esoteric, tongue-tantal
izing, and ethnic dish is reputedly
a favorite in the homes of many
famous national tongues (hardly a
wonder, since it has a long and
drab history).
The idea for this piece of
gourmet cuisine originated in
South Philadelphia in 1933, when,
under FDR's domestic agricultural
programs, all the scrapple,
hoagies, and pepper-pot soup in
the city vanished.
Well aware of the nutritive
virtue and novelty of well-chewed
toes, Sidney Greenberg,
enterprising South Philadelphia
grocer, started searching the stores
r or pigs' feet. Sure enough he
ound some, which had
takenly been placed 'n a box
carded from the Art Museum.

The box was labelled 'Noli Me
Tangeri.'
Greenberg quickly decided that
the meat came from Italy, and
went home proudly
congratulating himself on having
discovered foreign feet.
At this moment one of those
small coincidences that change
history occurred.
But, here the Greenberg legend
breaks off. All that remains of his
epoch-making discovery is this
recipe:
ITALIAN PIGS' FEET
BERNAISE
8 Italian Pigs 1 feet
4 lbs. butter
2 sprigs parsley
'A cup chopped shalots
'/z cup cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon german ground lemon
rind
3'/; cups vinegar
'/> pinch salt
2 breadcrumbs
Melt half the butter in a frying
pan over medium heat (a Sterno
can-burner usually yields
optimum results). When deep
brown, mince in the pig's feet
slowly. Conoisseurs swear by the
method of lowering the feet in by
a string, but for the average eater
this is optional. Cover and forget.
Mix in semi-small platinum
bowl parsley, pepper, shalots and
lemon rind. Add in breadcrumbs
slowly, stirring constantly. When
thoroughly mixed, place bowl in a
pot of boiling water on the stove.
Leave until breadcrumbs begin to
sizzle.

Take remainder of butter and
melt in another pan. Then add the
vinegar.
If you can look at the results,
pour in the shalots mixture. If
you can't, have a stronger
-stomached friend do it.
Add ice cube. (This is the key
to the success or failure of this
dish. If the cube melts within 30
seconds, you have a good chance
of success. If not, give your dog a
break and throw it out.)

Take sauce off heat and put in
refrigerator.
Then remove the pigs' feet
from the stove.
(Remember the pigs' feet?)
Remove sauce from
refrigerator, cut into cubes and
place around the meat.
Add salt.
Groove.
