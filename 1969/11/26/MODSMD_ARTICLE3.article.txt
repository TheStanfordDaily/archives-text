# Panther Aims Detailed
## Black Oppression Hit 
### PAUL PAPANEK 
"If we don't have the right to
determine our own destinies, then
what are we? Pawns? Peasants?
Puppets? Robots?"
Black Panther Fred Benning
pleaded quietly for the right of
black people to be free of
"capitalist oppression," and what
he called the "three levels of
Fascism" in the United States last
night in a presentation sponsored
by the Stanford Community
Against War and Fascism.
Speaking before 100 people in
place of Defense Minister Masai
Hewitt, who was unable to attend,
Benning attempted to outline the
aims and workings of the Black
Panther Party, especially in San
Francisco. Father Eugene Boyle
from Sacret Heart Church in San
Francisco also spoke, and detailed
his work with the Panthers.
Benning explained that the
Panthers are dedicated to the
abolition of war and "of all
weapons and tools of
destruction." "But," he said, "we
also recognize that the only way
weapons can be eliminated is for
people to take them up against
the enemies of the people."
He also stressed that justice for
all could never be accomplished in
a capitalist context. "As long as
the means of production are not
in the hands of the people the
system will simply continue to
perpetrate exploitation of the
workers.
"We must support any
revolutionary organization which
is aimed at restoring power into
the hands of the workers."

Benning also claimed that "we
have to get together, mobilize,
organize in meaningful fashion, so
that we can lay the basis for a
method of resistance."
The Panthers have initiated a
number of practical programs to
help relieve suffering in the
ghettoes of San Francisco,
Benning explained. They have set
up health clinics, clothing drives,
and a controversial breakfast
program for school children.
Father Boyle, whose parish is
in the heart of the predominantly
non-white Fillmore district,
expressed surprise that the
breakfast program had drawn so
much interest. "The way to
become famous without even
trying," he remarked grimly, "is
to feed kids."
He also drew a dark picture of
the life of most of those in his
parish. "Almost all have low
income, low levels of occupation,
are under-employed, and are
almost universally
undereducated."
Of the 90,000 people whom he
is assigned to serve, 63,000 are
non-white. "Their feelings of
pride and self-determination can
easily turn to outrage and violence
as they feel themselves trapped,"
said Boyle.
"We must move established
institutions to deal with
oppression," Boyle commented,
referring specifically to the police,
who he claimed have been guilty
of considerable aggression against
the Panthers and against his
programs as well.
Boyle said he supported the

breakfast program because he felt
the need was a valid one. Some 80
children are being fed now who
would otherwise go to school
hungry.
Furthermore, Boyle said he
backs the whole Panther program.
"I agree with every bit of their
philosophy and their program,"
said Boyle.

number of practical programs to
help relieve suffering in the
ghettoes of San Francisco,
Benning explained. They have set
up health clinics, clothing drives,
and a controversial breakfast
program for school children.
Father Boyle, whose parish is
in the heart of the predominantly
non-white Fillmore district,
expressed surprise that the
breakfast program had drawn so
much interest. "The way to
become famous without even
trying," he remarked grimly, "is
to feed kids."
He also drew a dark picture of
the life of most of those in his
parish. "Almost all have low
income, low levels of occupation,
are under-employed, and are
almost universally
undereducated."
Of the 90,000 people whom he
is assigned to serve, 63,000 are
non-white. "Their feelings of
pride and self-determination can
easily turn to outrage and violence
as they feel themselves trapped,"
said Boyle.
"We must move established
institutions to deal with
oppression," Boyle commented,
referring specifically to the police,
who he claimed have been guilty
of considerable aggression against
the Panthers and against his
programs as well.
Boyle said he supported the

breakfast program because he felt
the need was a valid one. Some 80
children are being fed now who
would otherwise go to school
hungry.
Furthermore, Boyle said he
backs the whole Panther program.
"I agree with every bit of their
philosophy and their program,"
said Boyle.


PANTHER EXPOUNDS Black Panther Fred lienning outlined the
Panther program last night to nut re than 100 people attending a
program sponsored by the Stanford Community Against War and
Fascism. Speaking with lienning tens Father Eugene Boyle, whose
parish work in the Fillmore district cooperates with the San Francisco
Panthers.
"If we don't have the right to
determine our own destinies, then
what are we? Pawns? Peasants?
Puppets? Robots?"
Black Panther Fred Benning
pleaded quietly for the right of
black people to be free of
"capitalist oppression," and what
he called the "three levels of
Fascism" in the United States last
night in a presentation sponsored
by the Stanford Community
Against War and Fascism.
Speaking before 100 people in
place of Defense Minister Masai
Hewitt, who was unable to attend,
Benning attempted to outline the
aims and workings of the Black
Panther Party, especially in San
Francisco. Father Eugene Boyle
from Sacret Heart Church in San
Francisco also spoke, and detailed
his work with the Panthers.
Benning explained that the
Panthers are dedicated to the
abolition of war and "of all
weapons and tools of
destruction." "But," he said, "we
also recognize that the only way
weapons can be eliminated is for
people to take them up against
the enemies of the people."
He also stressed that justice for
all could never be accomplished in
a capitalist context. "As long as
the means of production are not
in the hands of the people the
system will simply continue to
perpetrate exploitation of the
workers.
"We must support any
revolutionary organization which
is aimed at restoring power into
the hands of the workers."

Benning also claimed that "we
have to get together, mobilize,
organize in meaningful fashion, so
that we can lay the basis for a
method of resistance."
The Panthers have initiated a
number of practical programs to
help relieve suffering in the
ghettoes of San Francisco,
