# Bonfire Blues
## 
### 
112 Tremendous expense,
thousands of man-hours, elaborate
security, meticulous planning, and
strong spirit and enthusiasm went
up in smoke Friday night. Black
and blue thumbs colored by
misplaced hammers and
respiratory systems fouled by
smoke inhalation are small
payment for the priceless lessons
of the BIG GAME Bonfire.
As a leisure activity, the
bonfire is an indication of what
the Stanford community would
really like out of life. Stanford
students and faculty join alumni
and people in the surrounding
community in pausing for a few
hours from their work-a-day
worries of over-population,
destruction, pollution, and
violence and cram twenty
thousand people into a few acres
of land, burn enough wood to
build several houses or to keep
people warm for years, spew
smoke i.ito the air, and chant
slogans supporting the ultimate
demise of 28,000 people (46 in
particular).
Aside from the football games,
the bonfire was the best attended
event on campus (more people
than the Moratorium) and people
showed a wonderful community
pirit in building something tagged
or ultimate destruction.
