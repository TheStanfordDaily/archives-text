# Poppycock To Feature Tjader This Weekend
## 
### CRAIG OKINO 
The Poppycock, one of the few good small nightclubs on the
Peninsula which promotes mostly rock music and old folk blues
artists, departs somewhat from their usual format this weekend. Cal
Tjader, a jazzman who's been around for a long while, will appear
there Friday and Saturday, November 28th and 29th. The club will
have expanded seating for this engagement, and the first of four
nightly sets begins at 9:30.
Tjader has been playing his vibes around the Bay Area for a decade,
recording first for the small San based label, Fantasy, later
switching to Verve, and now records for Gabor Szabo's and Gary
McFarland's company, Skye Records.
Latin-based
His music is very Latin-based, and recently parts of the group went
electric. Tjader added amplification to his vibes, pianist Zulaica went
electric, and the bassist uses a Fender electric bass. Drums and conga
round out the group, and if you're a Santana freak like I am, you'll
like Cal Tjader, who seems to be one of the Santana band's influences.
The similarity between Tjader and rock ends with the electric
instruments, however. The quintet plays smooth, flowing Latin pieces,
somet ing that would come off well in the Poppycock's atmosphere.


HEAD OF A WOMAN by Jean-Raptiste Greuze (1768) is one of the
works in the collection of Old Master Drawings that are being exhibited
i the Stanford Art Gallery (across from the History Corner) through
tunday, December 14.
