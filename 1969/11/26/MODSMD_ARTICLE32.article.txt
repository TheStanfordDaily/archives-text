# Basketball Season Opens On Monday
## 
### 
With Stanford's finest football season in eighteen years just
completed, athletic interest now focuses on ten-month old Roscoe
Maples Pavilion, where Tribe basketball coach Howie Dallmar is
readying his club for the 1969-70 season.
With the season opener against Utah only five days away, the
Indians are wrapping up their preseason practices this week before
departing for Salt Lake City on Saturday morning.
Last year the Indians slid to a 9-17 mark, playing one of the
toughest schedules in the nation without a man over 6-7.
Size will probably be a factor once again this season, as the Tribe
front line for the Utah game will probably consist of 6-7 center Bill
Palmer, and 6-4 forwards Bill Barber and Fred Green. The Indian's
front line will be strengthened by the addition of 6-10, 235-pound
Larry Rosenzweig who sat out the past two seasons after a fine year
with the 1966-67 Stanford frosh.
The front line could also be helped by the return of Chuck Moore
and Mike Michel, both of whom are presently hampered by injuries.
Moore, a starter in 67-68, who sat out last season with a back injury,
will help the Indians defensive and rebounding game if he can return
to action in good shape. Mike Michel a 6-6 junior who started
opposite depated co-captain Mai McElwain at forward in 68-69 has
also been hampered by injuries.
Dallmar feels that starting guards Dennis O'Neill and Claude Terry,
plus the added strength of senior Greg Osborn, make the backcourt
"our strongest position." O'Neill shot 54% from the floor last year
and showed outstanding potential as the season progressed. Terry who
averaged 22.2 points for a Stanford frosh record will have the
unenviable task of trying to fill the shoes of Don Griffin, Stanford's
all time fifth leading scorer.
Overall Dallmar expects the 1969-70 edition to be stronger than
last year's team: "We should be improved this season. Our strong
point will be that we have a good shooting team. We have good size in
our guards, but lack it up front, so our board strength is
questionable."
