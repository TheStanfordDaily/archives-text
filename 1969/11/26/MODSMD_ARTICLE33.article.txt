S tanford-in-permany's
uniformed seven-man intramural
football team took a thriller last
weekend from a contingent of Cal
students studying at Gottingen
University, 52-0.
The traditional Teutonic
version of the Big Game, played
on Stanford's home field in
Beutelsbach, blew wide open early
due to the precision of the junior
Red Machine. The Stanford team,
25 strong, had been practicing for
a month prior to the game under
the direction of Head Coach
Young "Toad Sucker" Boozer of
Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and David
"Dog Mouth" Laney, a product of
Dallas and Stanford gridirons.
Using Boozer's wide open Bear
Bryant offense and Laney's
imaginative "sweat-hog" box
defense, the team wrecked havoc
on the numerically and physically
smaller Cal squad.

Led by the game's most
valuable player, quarterback Pete
Duffy, Stanford's seven (bedecked
in personalized red headbands and
cheered on by a frenzied crowd of
Burg partisans) scored on the
second play of the game on a
delayed post to lanky end Scott
Putnam.
The nimble-fingered Putnam
was to end the afternoon with
four touchdowns and two
extra-point receptions.
The Bears, with Paul deLand at
the helm, were forced to punt
after being stopped cold on their
first offensive series. Halfback
Rocky Deal returned the punt
down the sideline to paydirt for
six points after a brilliantly
executed reverse with fellow
receiver Mark Brown in the
backfield.
On the following Stanford
offensive series, a forty yard end
run by Boozer to the Cal ten yard
line set up Duffy's second scoring
pass, a quick flip to Putnam across
the middle of the sagging Bear
secondary. With four minutes
gone in the game, Stanford led,
20-0.
The game was obviously iced.
The remainder of the slugfest
was all anticlimax, as the Stanford
powerhouse rolled to repeated
scores, substituted freely, and
experimented voraciously.
A highlight was the halftime
ceremonies with nine year-old
cheerleaders, a Prince Lightfoot
(of sorts) in long underwear, a
homecoming queen, and a hairy
makeshift band (with baritone,
tamborine, and some combs with

wax paper) that attempted to
scramble into a letter or two
Card Defense
The inspired play of Cal's small
flanker and MVP, Kenny Yakota
was offset by the strength of the
Card defense, led by free safely
Jim Forthhoffer. The plucky
Forthhoffer harrassed Bears all
afternoon, knocked down three
passes, and intercepted three
more.
He was aided by Ron Brix and
Brown in the secondary and "cat"
linebackers Laney and Ray
Baxter, who as a unit blocked
thirteen Cal passes and
intercepted six.
Wallowing defensive line
"hogs" Tim Gillespie, Jim Massey,
Ken Cook, and Forrest Frank
provided a ferocious rush to hold
the hapless Bears scoreless, and
dumped the quarterback seven
times.
The offensive team scored
eight touchdowns and made half
their conversions behind Duffy's
signal-calling and pinpoint passing.
The erstwhile Duffy completed 24
of 33 passes, with favorite targets
Coach Boozer (eight receptions)
and Putnam (six snares).
The clutch catches of ends Phil
Koblik, Fred Morck, and Jeff
Stalder also aided the Red Tide.
Blocking protection was provided
by Pat Brennan and Speedy Jim
Hall.
After the 52-0 debacle, the
Indian team took their dwarf
version of the proverbial A"
returned to the Burg and
tanked.

Forthhoffer harrassed Bears all
afternoon, knocked down three
passes, and intercepted three
more.
He was aided by Ron Brix and
Brown in the secondary and "cat"
linebackers Laney and Ray
Baxter, who as a unit blocked
thirteen Cal passes and
intercepted six.
Wallowing defensive line
"hogs" Tim Gillespie, Jim Massey,
Ken Cook, and Forrest Frank
provided a ferocious rush to hold
the hapless Bears scoreless, and
dumped the quarterback seven
times.
The offensive team scored
eight touchdowns and made half
their conversions behind Duffy's
signal-calling and pinpoint passing.
The erstwhile Duffy completed 24
of 33 passes, with favorite targets
Coach Boozer (eight receptions)
and Putnam (six snares).
The clutch catches of ends Phil
Koblik, Fred Morck, and Jeff
Stalder also aided the Red Tide.
Blocking protection was provided
by Pat Brennan and Speedy Jim
Hall.
After the 52-0 debacle, the
Indian team took their dwarf
version of the proverbial A"
returned to the Burg and
tanked.
S tanford-in-permany's
uniformed seven-man intramural
football team took a thriller last
weekend from a contingent of Cal
students studying at Gottingen
University, 52-0.
The traditional Teutonic
version of the Big Game, played
on Stanford's home field in
Beutelsbach, blew wide open early
due to the precision of the junior
Red Machine. The Stanford team,
25 strong, had been practicing for
a month prior to the game under
the direction of Head Coach
Young "Toad Sucker" Boozer of
Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and David
"Dog Mouth" Laney, a product of
Dallas and Stanford gridirons.
Using Boozer's wide open Bear
Bryant offense and Laney's
imaginative "sweat-hog" box
defense, the team wrecked havoc
on the numerically and physically
smaller Cal squad.

Led by the game's most
valuable player, quarterback Pete
Duffy, Stanford's seven (bedecked
in personalized red headbands and
cheered on by a frenzied crowd of
Burg partisans) scored on the
second play of the game on a
delayed post to lanky end Scott
Putnam.
The nimble-fingered Putnam
was to end the afternoon with
four touchdowns and two
extra-point receptions.
The Bears, with Paul deLand at
the helm, were forced to punt
after being stopped cold on their
first offensive series. Halfback
Rocky Deal returned the punt
down the sideline to paydirt for
six points after a brilliantly
executed reverse with fellow
receiver Mark Brown in the
backfield.
On the following Stanford
offensive series, a forty yard end
run by Boozer to the Cal ten yard
line set up Duffy's second scoring
pass, a quick flip to Putnam across
the middle of the sagging Bear
secondary. With four minutes
gone in the game, Stanford led,
20-0.
The game was obviously iced.
The remainder of the slugfest
was all anticlimax, as the Stanford
powerhouse rolled to repeated
scores, substituted freely, and
experimented voraciously.
A highlight was the halftime
ceremonies with nine year-old
cheerleaders, a Prince Lightfoot
(of sorts) in long underwear, a
homecoming queen, and a hairy
makeshift band (with baritone,
tamborine, and some combs with

wax paper) that attempted to
scramble into a letter or two
Card Defense
The inspired play of Cal's small
flanker and MVP, Kenny Yakota
was offset by the strength of the
Card defense, led by free safely
Jim Forthhoffer. The plucky
