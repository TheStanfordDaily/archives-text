### SCOTT BURNS 
Two more intramural
tournaments ended this past week
with the First Year Biz team
winning the Golf Tournament,
and the Alpha Sigs winning the
Free Throw Tournament.
Bob Stevens and Mike
O'Malley combined to beat Dave
Shank and Larry Cram of he
Theta Delts, 1 up, to win the Golf
championships for the Biz School
last Wednesday. The match was
even all the way, with the Theta
Delts leading up until the 16th
hole, when the Biz team went to
the front. Both teams played well
with their best ball scores being
close to even par.
On Monday, the Alpha Sigs
sank 129 of 150 free throws to
defeat the KA's for the
championship in the Free Throw
Tournament.
Tom Watson opened with
45-50 for the Alpha Sigs, but
Steve Jones came back to tie the
score for the KA's by also
shooting 45-50. The second
shooters proved to be the
difference as Bill Taron shot
40-50 for the Alpha Sigs, while
Stu Boyd could only manage
28-50 for the KA's.
John Haxo followed with
44-50 to win the match, so Doug
Warner, the KA's third man,
didn't bother to shoot for there
was no way that his team could
win or tie. The Theta Delt I and II
teams took third and fourth in the
tournament, as they both lost in
the semifinals.
