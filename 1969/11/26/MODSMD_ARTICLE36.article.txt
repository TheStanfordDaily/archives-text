finished 21st. Ohio State's Rex
Kern was not in the top 25 in
either category.
Placekicker Horowitz finished
the year with 71 points, the
leading Stanford scorer, and third
nationally in the kick-scoring
leaders. He converted 41 of 44
extra-points, and made good on
10 of 18 field goal attempts.
USC's Ron Ayala, the man
who ruined the Stanford season
with his last second field goal in
Los Angeles, was not listed in the
top 25.
As a team, Stanford finished
behind only San Diego State and
Houston in total offense,
averaging 494 yards per game.
Ohio State was fourth, followed
by Texas, Missouri, Notre Dame,
and Purdue. UCLA was 11th and
