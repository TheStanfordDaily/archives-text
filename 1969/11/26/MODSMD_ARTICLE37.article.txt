As the first college all-star
teams were announced, Stanford
is sparingly represented
nationally, but heavily honored
on the West Coast.
United Press International
placed Stanford's Don Parish on
their second team nationally as
the school's only All-American.
Jim Plunkett was not named. First
string quarterback was Purdue's
senior Mike Phipps, and second
team was Archie Manning,
Mississippi's junior thrower.
In UPl's All-Coast team, the
Indians found some well-deserved
glory, as they landed eight players
on the first and second teams.
Plunkett was the top choice on
the team picked by coaches and
writers. Also on the first unit were
offensive linemen Bob Reinhard
and John Sande, and Parish on the
defensive squad.
Second team selections
included tight end Bob Moore,
tackle Pete Seymour, halfback
Bubba Brown, and defensive back-
Jim Kauffman.

As the first college all-star
teams were announced, Stanford
is sparingly represented
nationally, but heavily honored
on the West Coast.
United Press International
placed Stanford's Don Parish on
their second team nationally as
the school's only All-American.
Jim Plunkett was not named. First
string quarterback was Purdue's
senior Mike Phipps, and second
team was Archie Manning,
Mississippi's junior thrower.
In UPl's All-Coast team, the
Indians found some well-deserved
glory, as they landed eight players
on the first and second teams.
Plunkett was the top choice on
the team picked by coaches and
writers. Also on the first unit were
offensive linemen Bob Reinhard
and John Sande, and Parish on the
defensive squad.
Second team selections
included tight end Bob Moore,
tackle Pete Seymour, halfback
Bubba Brown, and defensive back-
Jim Kauffman.
