Oklahoma's big running back
Steve Owens beat out Purdue
quarterback Mike Phipps in
winning the 1969 Heisman
Trophy, the symbol of college
football's outstanding player.
The 6-2, 215-pound senior
tailback from Miani, Oklahoma,
piled up 1488 votes to 1334 for
Phipps. Ohio State's junior
quarterback Rex Kern was third,
and Stanford's Jim Plunkett was
eighth in voting announced
yesterday in New York.
Owens is the top
touchdown-maker in collegiate
football history, and set a
three-year career rushing record of
3606 yards, breaking Gayle Sayers
old record of 2675 set at Kansas
from 1962-64.
Broken down into sections,
Owens was the number one choice
of the Far West and Southwest
voters, Phipps the favorite in the
East and Midwest, and
Mississippi's Archie Manning the
top pick in the South. Sports
writers and sports casters vote for
the trophy.
Phipps, who played perhaps
the greatest game of his career
against Stanford this season, was
obviously hurt by his performance
in Purdue's television game against
Ohio State when he threw five
interceptions.
It was the third time in four
years that a Purdue player has
been snubbed for the award.
Leroy Keyes and Bob Griese also
came close but lost.
