# Dartmouth Job For Lyman?
## 
### 
Provost Richard W. Lyman
yesterday refused to confirm a
report in the New York Times
that he is the leading candidate
for the presidency of Dartmouth
College, but the administrator did
admit he has received "inquiries"
from the New Hampshire college
and other universities.
In an article in yesterday's New
York Times, an anonymous
source declared it was "80 or 90
per cent certain that Lyman is the
man."
In addition, Prof. John H.
Copenhaver, head of the
Dartmouth trustees' faculty
advisory committee said the
search had narrowed from "150
to 200 possible candidates to a
few men," among them Lyman.

Yesterday the Provost
responded in a statement
declaring, "I have not been
offered any position other than
the one I now hold at Stanford.
Like anyone else in a job like
mine, in a well-known university,
1 have had inquiries from time to
time about college or university
presidencies, and have sometimes
discussed possibilities with
representatives from these
institutions." Lyman refused to
make any other comments.
Offer Denied
The chairman of the
Dartmouth board of trustees,
Lloyd D. Brace, said that Lyman
had not been offered the post.
Dartmouth's current president,
Dr. John Sloan Dickey, last fall
announced that he will resign
when his successor is found. He
has served as president for more
than 20 years.
Other names under
consideration are rumored to
include John W. Gardner, former
Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare and Stanford trustee,
and Roger Heyns, chancellor of
the University of California's
Berkeley campus.
Swarthmore Rumors
Rumors flew throughout the
Stanford community that Lyman
was on his way out with the
arrival of President Kenneth Pitzer
in December, 1968. It was
reported at that time that Lyman
had been offered the presidency
of Swarthmore College, which was
unoccupied.
However, Lyman is reported to
have turned down several
Swarthmore offers, choosing
instead to work in Pitzer's
administration. The Dartmouth
opening should serve to reopen
speculation that Stanford's chief
academic officer is looking
elsewhere for a presidential
appointment.
Dr. Lyman, 46, graduated from
Swarthmore in 1947 and was
awarded his doctorate in history
from Harvard. He joined the
Stanford faculty in 1958,
specializing in modern British
history. In 1964, he became
associate dean of Humanities and
Sciences and in 1967 was
promoted to vice president for
academic affairs and provost.

admit he has received "inquiries"
from the New Hampshire college
and other universities.
In an article in yesterday's New
York Times, an anonymous
source declared it was "80 or 90
per cent certain that Lyman is the
man."
In addition, Prof. John H.
Copenhaver, head of the
Dartmouth trustees' faculty
advisory committee said the
search had narrowed from "150
to 200 possible candidates to a
few men," among them Lyman.

Yesterday the Provost
responded in a statement
declaring, "I have not been
offered any position other than
the one I now hold at Stanford.
Like anyone else in a job like
mine, in a well-known university,
1 have had inquiries from time to
time about college or university
presidencies, and have sometimes
discussed possibilities with
representatives from these
institutions." Lyman refused to
make any other comments.
Offer Denied
The chairman of the
Dartmouth board of trustees,
Lloyd D. Brace, said that Lyman
had not been offered the post.
Dartmouth's current president,
Dr. John Sloan Dickey, last fall
announced that he will resign
when his successor is found. He
has served as president for more
than 20 years.
Other names under
consideration are rumored to
include John W. Gardner, former
Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare and Stanford trustee,
and Roger Heyns, chancellor of
the University of California's
Berkeley campus.
Swarthmore Rumors
Rumors flew throughout the
Stanford community that Lyman
was on his way out with the
arrival of President Kenneth Pitzer
in December, 1968. It was
reported at that time that Lyman
had been offered the presidency
of Swarthmore College, which was
unoccupied.
However, Lyman is reported to
have turned down several
Swarthmore offers, choosing
instead to work in Pitzer's
administration. The Dartmouth
opening should serve to reopen
speculation that Stanford's chief
academic officer is looking
elsewhere for a presidential
appointment.
Dr. Lyman, 46, graduated from
Swarthmore in 1947 and was
awarded his doctorate in history
from Harvard. He joined the
Stanford faculty in 1958,
specializing in modern British
history. In 1964, he became
associate dean of Humanities and
Sciences and in 1967 was
promoted to vice president for
academic affairs and provost.


ADMINISTRATIVE PAINS—While Assistant to the President Willard Wyman (right) receives an increasing
amount of vitriolic mail following an alleged misquotation in the PALO ALTO TIMES, rumors continue
to circulate that Provost Richard Lyman (right) will leave Stanford to assume the Presidency of
Dartmouth College.
Provost Richard W. Lyman

report in the New York Times
that he is the leading candidate
for the presidency of Dartmouth
College, but the administrator did
