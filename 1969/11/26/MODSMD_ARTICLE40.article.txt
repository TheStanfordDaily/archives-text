## 
### 
The headlines were all Gerry
Lindgren's Monday, as the spunky
competitor from Washington
State closed out a brilliant
collegiate career with a
record-breaking effort in the 31st
Annual NCAA Cross-Country
Championships in New York.
But cracking the top ten,
finishing just 47 seconds off the
pace, was Stanford's own Greg
Brock.
Brock, a two year letterman
and a Senior here, turned in a
clocking of 29:46 over the rugged
six mile course that winds through
Van Cortland Park in New York
City.
Brock finished ninth in a field

composed of the top fifty
collegiate runners in he nation,
and ran a strong race despite the
stiff competition.
Among those who crossed the
finish liAtef ahead of him were
Lindgren, who led all the way,
defending champ Mike Ryan of
the Air Force Academy, and the
amazing freshman from Oregon,
Steve Prefontaine, who finished in
a dead heat with Lindgren in the
Pac-8 Championships held here at
Stanford on November 8.
