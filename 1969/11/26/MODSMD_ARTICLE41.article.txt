# Booters Lose; Close At 7-7
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer team ended
it's 1969 season last Friday with a
3-1 loss to San Francisco State on
the Gator's home field in South
San Francisco.
Chip Jessup scored the lone
goal for the Tiibe in the second
period in a game played on a wet
and small field. The loss brought
the Indians' final record to 7-7 for
the season.
The record was a considerable
improvement over last season's
mark, however, as Stanford
attained the .500 plateau while
playing without the services of
1968 All-Leaguer Ben White for
its last few games.
And the outlook for next
season is already bright, since the
Indians will only be losing two
starters: White and forward Al
Houghton. With many members
of this year's squad back, the
1970 team should be bigger,
stronger, more experienced and
smarter.
