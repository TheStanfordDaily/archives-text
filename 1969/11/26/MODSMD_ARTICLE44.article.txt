# Sen. Gravel To Speak
## 
### 
Sen. Mike Gravel (D-Alaska)
will speak on "The Generation
Gap and the U.S. Senate" in a
public lecture scheduled for 4
p.m. Monday (Dec. 1) in the
Large Lounge of Tresidder
Memorial Union on the Stanford
campus.
At 39, Sen. Gravel is one of
less than a handful of legislators in
the upper house under 40 and
feels his relative youth as a
responsibility to mediate
generational differences of
interpretation between this
country's youth and its older
generation.
Born in Springfield, Mass., and
the recipient of a bachelor's
degree in economics from
Columbia University, he headed
up the Alaskan Highway shortly
after his graduation in 1956. He
began his career in real estate sales
and later expanded to real estate
development.
In 1962 he won his first seat in
the state legislature, and after his
re-election in 1964 was named
Speaker of the House. In 1968 he
ran and won the U.S. Senate seat
from Alaska over the incumbent,
Sen. Ernest Gruening.


SEN. MIKE GRAVEL-D. Alaska
will speak Monday on "The
Generation Gap and the U.S.
Senate."
