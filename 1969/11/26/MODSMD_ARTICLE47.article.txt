# Law Meeting Begins
## 
### 
On Wednesday, November 26, the Stanford
Environmental Law Society will host a conference
of law students on the role of law students in
protecting and improving the environment.
Representatives from Columbia, University of
Chicago, Boalt Hall, U.C.L.A., U.C. Davis,
Stanford, and Santa Clara will meet in Room
163-E of the Law School at 9:30 a.m.
After hearing remarks by Mr. John Winder of
Washington, D.C., the students will discuss the
need for legal participation in environmental
planning and the activities of law students at this
time. They will then consider the possible creation
of a National Environmental Law Society.
Conference Chairman James Rummonds
stresses the need for cooperation and coordination
among law school environmental groups and
expresses the hope that this meeting will be a
starting point for effective action in this direction.
