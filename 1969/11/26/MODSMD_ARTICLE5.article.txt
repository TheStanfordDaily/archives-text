## Indians Grow On Alcatraz 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--The
occupying force of Indians on
Alcatraz swelled Tuesday to a size
nearing the total convict
population of the former prison
fortress the year before it was
abandoned.
The invaders demanding a
federal turnover of the rocky
island in San Francisco Bay,
originally a few more than 100,
now claim to number more than
200. All of the prisoners in the
barracks totaled 260 in 1962.
The prospect of Thanksgiving
in the grim conditions of the
encampment loomed as Federal
spokesmen allowed the Indians to
remain after boating out to talk to
them again Tuesday.
Fresh water and food have to
be brought in by boat, but Indian

leaders contended their situation
was "tolerable."
Occupation spokesman
Richard Oakes said there was no
fear of disease because "Indians
are keeping the island clean."
The official visitors gave the
Indians another of their almost
daily reminders that they are
illegally trespassing on federal
property and again urged them to
leave—but there were no demands.
"No deadline or ultimatums
have been decreed," said a
government spokesman.
The Indians have received word
of a tentative agreement by
Interior Secretary Walter Hickel
to confer with them in person,
but no definite arrangements have
been made.
The Indians are claiming the
island under terms of an 1868
treaty entitling the Sioux to
unused federal property.
Youth Vote
WASHINGTON (AP)~The
National Violence Commission
called on the government Tuesday
to woo alienated youth back into
the national mainstream by
'lowering the voting age to 18,

liberalizing marijuana laws and
reforming the draft.
The panel, headed by Dr.
Milton S. Eisenhower, also
recommended legislation to
expand the opportunities for
young people to take part in
public service employment.
In suggesting the government
try to deal with youthful
grievances, the 13-man
commission emphasized this
should not be interpreted as a
suggestion that "violent and
unlawful behavior by young
people should be tolerated or
excused."
The panel noted young people
account for an ever-increasing
percentage of the national crime
rate and said some deliberately
engage in violent forms of protest.
But it said many others "are
highly motivated by the ideals of
justice, equality, candor,
peace—fundamental values which
their intellectual and spiritual
heritage has taught them to
honor."

CHICAGO (AP)—Philip M. Crane,
a conservative Republican who
backs President Nixon's Vietnam

war policy defeated Democrat
Edward A. Warman, a war critic,
Tuesday in the race to represent
the affluent 13th Congressional
District north of Chicago.
Crane received 59,734 votes to
Warman's 43,379 with all but 45
precincts reporting out of 551.
The clear choice on Vietnam
policy did little to bring out the
district's 292,480 registered voters
as only a little more than a third
balloted.
The district has been in
Republican hands for more than
50 years but Warman had hoped
to turn the tide by making
Vietnam an issue.
Crane, 37, self-described
"no-nonsense conservative," is a
writer and former history teacher.
Warman, 43, a lawyer and state
representative, received public
endorsement from such Vietnam
doves as Sen. George S.
McGovern, (D-S.D.), and Rep.
Allard Lowenstein (D-N.Y.).
Tax Bill Moves
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Senate, overriding Republican
objections that it was moving too
fast on the tax reform bill, voted
Tuesday to continue the income
tax surchange at a reduced 5
percent rate until next June.
By a vote of 49 to 28 the
Senate defeated an amendment
offered by Sen. Harry F. Byrd Jr.,
(D-Va.), and supported chiefly by
senators up for re-election next
year.
The Byrd amendment would
have struck out of the massive bill
a provision halving the current 10
percent surtax but continuing it
for six months past the Jan. 1
expiration date.
