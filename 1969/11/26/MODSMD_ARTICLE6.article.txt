# Salary Publication Urged
## Student Senate Questions Budget Goals 
### MARGIE WOLF 
The student Senate last night
heard pleas by high university
officials for budgetary
bel t-tigh ten ing, and United
Stanford Employees (USE)
requests for cooperation with
employee goals.
In a delayed response to the
salary publication controversy,
the Senate voted 14-9 to urge the
administration and other groups
to make all budgetary and fiscal
information public.
The group offered its "support
and endorsement to any
publication which prints and
makes available to the university
community any such information
now available." The resolution
was sponsored by John Shoch and
Frank Philpot.
Provost Richard Lyman and
Vice-President for Finance
Kenneth Cuthbertson told the
student Senate the same thing
they had told the faculty earlier
this month—the University must
slow its growth rate as federal
funds dwindle.
Students by-passed a maze of
budget statistics questionning the

officers about construction
contracting, land development,
laying-off employees and use of
research funds in the medical
school.
Med School Allegations
Questioners referred to
allegations that the medical school
received a $25,000 grant while the
project's principal investigator
receivednnto t money and did not
work on the contract.
Charges to that effect have
been circulating in relation to
circumstances surrounding the
work of Dr. Leo Saperstein, a
physiologist who died last week,
apparently of an overdose of
drugs.
Lyman said he couldn't
confirm or deny the
reports—"Which means I don't
know."

Virginia Bacon from USE
asked Lyman why staff would not
be included on the student-faculty
Long Range Financial Planning
Committee, which will advise
officials where to cut
expenditures. Lyman responded
that it was "extremely difficult"
to get employee representation
when no representative staff
governing body existed analogous
to the student Senate.
Earlier USE representative Mrs.
Julia Harvey informed the Senate
that USE had set up a liaison
committee to work with students
and faculty. "We have common
interests with you in many areas,"
she stated. She asked for
cooperation in raising University
minimum wage rates, establishing
children's day-care centers, and
gaining committee representation.

"We're ignored and totally
excluded from everything
happening in the University," she
maintained.
'Too Few Students'
Paul Witt suggested that two
student representatives on the
financial planning committee are
insufficient. Applications for the
positions are available today in
the ASSU office.
Earlier in the meeting,
Chairman Dave Edwards
announced that graduate business
school senator Kirk Hanson has
resigned. Paul Baker will replace
him.
Edwards also reported he has
obtained the office space he
demanded at another meeting.
"Moving day is tentatively set for
tomorrow," he said with a smile.

Lyman said he couldn't
confirm or deny the
reports—"Which means I don't
know."

Virginia Bacon from USE
asked Lyman why staff would not
be included on the student-faculty
Long Range Financial Planning
Committee, which will advise
officials where to cut
expenditures. Lyman responded
that it was "extremely difficult"
to get employee representation
when no representative staff
governing body existed analogous
to the student Senate.
Earlier USE representative Mrs.
Julia Harvey informed the Senate
that USE had set up a liaison
committee to work with students
and faculty. "We have common
interests with you in many areas,"
she stated. She asked for
cooperation in raising University
minimum wage rates, establishing
children's day-care centers, and
gaining committee representation.

"We're ignored and totally
excluded from everything
happening in the University," she
maintained.
'Too Few Students'
Paul Witt suggested that two
student representatives on the
financial planning committee are
insufficient. Applications for the
positions are available today in
the ASSU office.
Earlier in the meeting,
Chairman Dave Edwards
announced that graduate business
school senator Kirk Hanson has
resigned. Paul Baker will replace
him.
Edwards also reported he has
obtained the office space he
demanded at another meeting.
"Moving day is tentatively set for
tomorrow," he said with a smile.
The student Senate last night
heard pleas by high university
officials for budgetary
bel t-tigh ten ing, and United
Stanford Employees (USE)
requests for cooperation with
employee goals.
In a delayed response to the
salary publication controversy,
the Senate voted 14-9 to urge the
administration and other groups
to make all budgetary and fiscal
information public.
The group offered its "support
and endorsement to any
publication which prints and
makes available to the university
community any such information
now available." The resolution
was sponsored by John Shoch and
Frank Philpot.
Provost Richard Lyman and
Vice-President for Finance
Kenneth Cuthbertson told the
student Senate the same thing
they had told the faculty earlier
this month—the University must
slow its growth rate as federal
funds dwindle.
Students by-passed a maze of
budget statistics questionning the

officers about construction
contracting, land development,
laying-off employees and use of
research funds in the medical
school.
Med School Allegations
Questioners referred to
allegations that the medical school
received a $25,000 grant while the
project's principal investigator
receivednnto t money and did not
work on the contract.
Charges to that effect have
been circulating in relation to
circumstances surrounding the
work of Dr. Leo Saperstein, a
physiologist who died last week,
apparently of an overdose of
drugs.
Lyman said he couldn't
confirm or deny the
