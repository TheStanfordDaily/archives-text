# Abortion Panel Cites Apathy, Lack Of Public Knowledge

"Ot the 100,000 abortions
performed in California each year,
90,000 are illegal or underground,
which can lead to serious
complications," Richard Orser
told members of the Stanford
Medical Students Association
yesterday.
Orser, presently under
indictment for illegal abortion
counselling, discussed abortions,
counseling, operation methods
and Stanford's position.
"Stanford does perform quite a
few abortions," he admitted, "but
his hasn't reduced the number of
underground cases, which are
either self-induced or performed
by physicians."
The main reason that girls do
not turn to Stanford for help is
lack of time and money. Cost can
range from $350 to $700,
depending on individual
situations.
Abortions Safer
According to Orser, medical
data published from Eastern
Europe, where women can obtain
abortions relatively easily, shows
that an abortion can be four times

safer than childbirth. However,
these facts are disputed by many
physicians.
John Montgomery, a lawyer
presently working on repeal of
abortion laws, outlined what
recent court decisions mean to
both those practicing and
receiving abortions.
"Women have a right to
privacy, liberty and a right to
life . . .and the courts will now
back them up," he stated in light
of the over-ruling of old abortion
laws by courts in California and
Washington, D.C.
Doctor's Choice
"Doctors can nowdo what they
want and decide the case on
medical facts . . .and we now have
to educate doctors to this state of
awareness," Montgomery
continued.
Peter Cornell, also involved
with repeal of abortion laws,
backed up Montgomery by saying
that "doctors can do all they
want, provided they follow proper
procedure." This procedure
includes using a fully certified
hospital and going through the
hospital board.

The present law states that an
abortion can be performed if
childbirth could "impair the
physical or mental health of the
mother," and according to Cornell
there is no legal requirement in
the law for psychiatrists, who
often raise the price of an
abortion considerably.
Free Clinic
In the near future Cornell
hopes to set up a Free Abortion
Clinic in Palo Alto which would
serve as a counseling center to
help those wishing to receive an
abortion through all the red tape
that Stanford requires.
According to both Cornell and
Orser, abortions still are not
completely legal, as can be seen
by the 90,000 illegal operations,
and pressure must now be put on
the Medical Center to speed up
the period that it takes to obtain
an abortion and therefore increase
the number performed.
"Time is essential for a woman
with an unwanted pregnancy-for
if she cannot obtain immediate
help, she may find more
dangerous ways," the experts
concluded.
