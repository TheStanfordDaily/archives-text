# The 						War And I
## Saigon, California 90028 
### Charles F. Bennett 
• Many, many amazing and
spectacular events have been
staged over the years in
Hollywood, California, but I am
now in a position to reveal one
which surely surpasses all the
others in scope and import. It is
on this one continuing series, this
twentieth century saga of
unprecedented proportion, that
three Presidents of the United
States have staked their entire
political futures.
Early in 1962, after our
humiliating defeat in the Bay of
Pigs conflagration, the late
President Kennedy determined
t&at something should happen to
bt»ost the country, give it the old
s(eam back, and shoot a little
adrenalin into his own political
image as well. At the time, there
were some five hundred American
advisors in a small Southeast
Asian country called South
Vietnam. The President ordered
tliem withdrawn under cover of
darkness.
Thus began the most
earth-shaking sage of our time.
The second speech in Bertolt
Brecht's Mother Courage describes
beautifully America's problem at
the time: "What we need around
here is a good war." With
remarkable intuition and moral
sense of duty our President saw
■ that there is no such thing as a
' good war —at least not in real life.
» But Americans had been watching
wars on television and the movies
. for years, and had been loving
' every minute of it. The President
saw what he must do.
* What follows is the transcript
| (dug up by William L. Shirer) of a
top-priority meeting which took
| place between President Kennedy,
the President of Metro-Goldwyn
[ -Mayer studios, and the Presidents
. of CBS, NBS, and ABC News.
The First Act
KENNEDY: Gentlemen, won't
J you sit down? Ahhem. Now, what
I propose is this. I propose a war.
MGM: Wars are expensive.
1 Very expensive. Have to order the
«ammo in advance and digging up
'all the old planes and tanks is a
■goddam nuisance. Besides, the
takes years, years to
pprfect, 'less you want to use the
.one off—oh, what's the name of
the damn thing—oh, yes, the
Longest Day. That was the
-; goddamndest movie. What sort of
• war do you want?

.' KENNEDY: Well, it needs to
appear pretty big. I envisioned
; something along the lines of a
guerrilla war of new, modern,
gigantic proportions. Not your
traditional hit-and-miss operation
that merely inspires terminal
boredom in the enemy. We've had
some people in South
Vietnam . . .
NBC: Where's that?
KENNEDY: Oh, it's around
, China somewhere, I think. Or is it
east of Java? Anyway, I had these
people pulled out on the sly. All
we have to do is to continue the
war here at home.
MGM: Is that one of those
, goddamn places with creepers,
; swamps, tarantulas and Orientals
.running all over the place? Those
are goddamnded expensive,
because to make it really realistic
you have to grow the goddamn
vegetation in the studio.
KENNEDY: Well, don't worry
about the cost. Our defense
budget is only about $45 billion
at the moment, and where
national defense is concerned I'm
sure the people will fall for up to
$30 billion a year.
MGM: Well, goddamn. We
haven't had a budget like that
since Gone With the Wind. If you
can afford that, I can really rustle
you up a war.
KENNEDY: Great. I can have
a few divisions permanently
assigned to you, and you can train
them yourself. But now here's
where you newsmen come in. You
see, without a war the American
public is stagnant. They have no
motivation, no initiative. They sit
around thinking about how great
they are. There is nothing like a
war to get things going again. But
I don't want to go down in
history as the first American
President to kill off her boys just
for morale purposes, so I think
this is the better way. Besides,
when the people get tired of the
war, we can stop it on a moments,
notice. What I need you guys
from the networks to do is
organize the footage, get some
good men to comment on it. Put
itrover the air gradually, so that it
looks like slow escalation.
Eventually we can make it the top
issue of the day.
CBS: What's the motivation for
the war?
KENNEDY: Oh, call it
opposing communist aggression,
you know, the usual stuff.
ABC: What about U.S. war
dead? And travelers abroad?
KENNEDY: It should be no
problem to incarcerate a few G.I.s
a week and hold them
incommunicado. As for visitors,
we'll restrict travel to only a select
few. As for them, the only way
they can judge where they've

landed is by what they see and
hear, right? With a budget of $20
billion it should be no problem to
set up the studio out in Nevada or
something, with its own airfield
and vegetation and everything,
right?
MGM: I thought you said $30
billion.
KENNEDY: Did I? Sorry, I
meant twenty. Is it possible?
And thus it started. Within a
few months we were hearing
occasional news reports on the
Vietnam "conflict." It was just
starting to bloom into a good,
solid war when tragedy struck the
Kennedys and the nation. The
President's assassination had
repercussions all over the world,
but nowhere were they as strong
as in the executive offices of
Healthy Conflict Corporation,
where a terrific struggle was
taking place to see who would
assume the seat of the
now-deceased Chairman of the
Board. Out of the struggle
emerged Lyndon Johnson, proud,
tall—not only our new President,
but also the new Chairman of the
Board of the Healthy Conflicts
Corp. He immediately convened a
meeting of the Board and
requested an immediate
escalation, that the American
people were as conceited and
overbearing as ever. The following
discussion ensued.
The 2nd Act
CBS: Mr. President, I frankly
think it's the war that is making
the people conceited and
overbearing. Patriotism inflates
people.
NBC: And wars inflate
economies.
JOHNSON: If you are worried
about your cut, we can let you
out. Then what would you do
with your third Rolls Royce?
NBC: No, that isn't what I
meant at all.
JOHNSON: No, I guess not.
How much would it cost to
escalate the war unilaterally and

press for a so-called military
victory?
MGM: About another $2
million.
JOHNSON: Well, I'm sure I
could get another $5 billion out
of Congress. What do you say?
MGM: Well, goddamn. Another
billion apiece.
ABC: Sounds fine to me. The
people are still satisfied, and the
economy is booming.
JOHNSON: Okay, it's settled,
then. That'll raise the defense
budget to just about $80 billion.
I'm afraid that may be the limit.
President Johnson did not
know how right he was. At that
very moment, in the law offices of
Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie,
Alexander, and Mitchell in New
York, former Vice President
Richard Nixon had reached a
fateful decision. Early on the
morning of February 29, 1968,
Mr. Nixon, who had penetrated
the tightest security secret in the
history of the United States to
unmask the insidious plot, met
with the leaders of the Healthy
Conflicts Corp., exclusive of the
President, to make his position
clear. The conversation as
recorded by NBC News went like
this:
And Then What
NIXON: Well, let me make a
couple of things very clear. First
of all, I think it's apparent from
the campaign of Eugene McCarthy
and the response he is getting that
there is considerable opposition to
the Vietnam war at this time.
President Johnson will not be able
to end the war instantaneously,
because he could give no
satisfactory explanation of his
action. On the other hand a phase
down isn't going to satisfy
anyone. I would say that
Johnson's political future is in
dire jeopardy.
MGM: Well, goddamn it, what
about us? We have our profits to
think of!
NIXON: Precisely.

MGM: He can't just end the
war, just Pfft, like that, goddamn
it! That would ruin me.
NIXON: If I might make a
suggestion. If Johnson doesn't end
the war immediately, he won't be
re-elected. So, just don't give him
the opportunity to end the war.
After all, you have direct control
over it. Why don't you just make
it crystal-clear to him that
Richard Nixon has taken over as
Chairman of the Board of Healthy
Conflicts, and that the war will
continue whether he likes it or
not. He will have to drop out of
the race.
CBS: What's in it for us?
NIXON: Well, let me just say
this. If you will support me in this
effort, I pledge to draw the war
out as long as is politically
feasible, and that should be at
least three years. Meanwhile, I will
guarantee your three networks
permanent FCC licenses. But let
me make one thing clear; let all of
you understand that I will have to
subject you to continual
harrassment from my Vice
President and from the head of
the FCC. This will have no actual
effect on your dispensations,
however. It will merely allay
suspicion. What do you think?
MGM: What about goddamn
little old me? Those people will
have permanent goddamn licenses.
What will I have except three
years of war and a lot of Far East
rubbish on a Nevada desert?
NIXON: Well, gentlemen, you
don't seriously imagine that I
would allow our efforts to lapse,
do you? We must merely seek out
a different task. I know a good
think when I see one, gentlemen.
For example, there is now a bit of
trouble in the Middle East. Or
what about Biafra and Nigeria?
There are infinite possibilities. I
think it is crystal-clear that we
should continue to explore them.
The rest is history.
