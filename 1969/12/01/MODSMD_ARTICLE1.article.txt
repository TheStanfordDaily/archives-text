# Lottery To Ease Draft Doubts?
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Today about 3,000 Stanford
students will have their draft
problems solved forever.
That represents three-eighths
of the 8,000 students between 19
and 26 who will have a permanent
draft number assigned to them
today by the first lottery drawing.
According to Alan Strain,
Stanford's draft adviser, at least
that proportion of men will have
their birth date drawn far enough
down on the scale from 1 to 366
to ensure that their local draft
board will never send them an
induction order.
Other men will wake up
tomorrow morning to find out
that the personal threat of the
draft has become worse, or at
least, no better. The crucial factor
for each man is the number he
receives today—a number which
will determine his place on his
draft board's order of call
whenever he loses his deferment
and becomes I-A—in 1970, 1971,
or later.
The magic number is roughly
230.
Reform Explained
Newspaper accounts of the
draft lottery have been confusing
and incomplete. This article will
attempt to explain Nixon's new
system as best as it is understood.
Later articles by draft counselor

Strain will discuss the subtleties in
greater depth.
Nixon's executive order
"reforms" the draft in only one
way—by limiting to one year the
time that a draft board can keep a
I-A youth in its pool available to
fill the board's manpower quota
at any time.
Until now, the oldest I-A's
were drafted first out of the age
group 19 to 26. This meant that a
youth could stay in the limbo of a
I-A for years until the draft board
took him.
The pressure of this
uncertainty coerced many youths
into voluntarily enlisting to obtain
certain privileges in the Army.
Others were "channeled" into
draft-deferred activities like
college, ROTC and war-related
employment.
Policy Reversal
Nixon has now reversed the
order of call—making 19-year-olds
first in line for the draft, along
with college students who have
just lost their 11-S deferments. The
new, "youngest-first" policy was
desired by the Pentagon, which
prefers 19-year-old draftees to the
23, 24 and 25-year-olds who were
making up a large proportion of
recent draft calls.
The "youngest-first" policy
requires some formal mechanism
to decide which men will be

inducted out of the 1-A's, since
the total pool of physically fit
men who turn 19 each year is
almost twice as large as the
Pentagon's current annual
manpower requirement. Also, a
mechanism is needed to make sure
a man doesn't escape the draft
just by growing older.
Nixon's mechanism to do these
things is to limit a man's
vulnerability to one year, and
choose among the eligible pool by
a lottery.
Transition Action
The first lottery will apply to a
different group of men than all
subsequent lotteries. The
difference is caused by the
transition between the old system
and the new.
Today's drawing will give a
number from 1 to 366, based on
his birth date, to every man who
has reached age 19, but not age
26, by January 1. In subsequent
years, the lottery will assign
numbers for all men who become
19 in that calendar year.
A man keeps the same lottery
number, no matter when he loses
his deferment and has to face the
draft. Thus Stanford sophomore
C. Fodder might have his
birthdate, February 13, drawn
today as number 148 from the
glass bowl at Selective Service
headquarters.

Mr. Fodder won't lose his 11-S
deferment until June, 1972, when
ne graduates. At that time he will
enter the "priority selection
group" as the number 148, with
the same vulnerability as all the
undeferred 19-year-olds who had
their birthdate drawn 148 th in the
lottery of 1971.
Through The Numbers
Each board will take all the
number l's in the pool, and then
move on to the number 2's, and
so on. By the end of the year, a
typical board will be down to
about number 230.
A 19-year-old without a
student deferment will begin his
year in the pool on January 1
following his 19th birthday.
If you have a deferment, your
one year of vulnerability is the
calendar year during which you
lose the deferment.
For instance, Mr. Fodder will
be reclassified 1-A in July, 1972.
He will be in the priority selection
group for the draft calls in July
through December of 1972. If his
draft board doesn't take him
during those months, he's free.
If Mr. Fodder prevents the
board from inducting him during
1972 by appeals, his membership
in the priority selection pool is
shifted to 1973 or whenever his
appeals run out.

The much-discussed
"loophole" in Nixon's executive
order is the opportunity for Mr.
Fodder to telephone his draft
board late next year and ask them
if they're down to number 148
yet. If they're only down to
number 100 and don't think
they'll reach his number, Mr.
Fodder can demand that they
reclassify him 1-A immediately
and he will survive his one year in
the pool.
If the draft board, on the other
hand, has reached his number, Mr.
Fodder can keep his 11-Sand wait
for another year.
Manpower Requirements
In 1970, the priority selection
group of 1-A's for the entire
country will number about
850,000 men. According to a
source at the Scientific Manpower
Commission in Washington, an
unaffiliated group, the Pentagon
wants 550,000 new soldiers in
1970—enlistees and draftees
combined.
The Pentagon expects that it
will have to draft 260,000 of the
550,000, all of whom must come
from the pool of 850,000.
Newspapers have been creating
the false impression in recent
weeks that only the 250,000 men
drafted out of the total pool will
have to enter the military. This is
inaccurate. ,

The number of men that the
Pentagon—and each individual
draft board—have to induct
depends on the number who
voluntarily enlist because of the
threat of the draft.
What ths means is that the
draft boards are going to go about
five-eighths of the way down the
list from 1 to 366 to fill their
quotas. (The other three-eighths
will escape—including 3,000 of us
at Stanford.) Men high on the list
will be more apt to enlist, but
men with low numbers who
otherwise might have enlisted will
not do so.
Ducking the Draft
For the college student who
wants to duck the draft, it would
be wise to put off getting a 1-A
until a year when the Pentagon's
manpower quota is the smallest
proportion of the total priority
selection 000 l
The pool is larger in 1970 than
it will be in later years, because of
the presence of 250,000
undeferred men from 19 to 26
who are caught up in the
transition from oldest-first to
youngest-first.
But the Pentagon's manpower
needs are larger in 1970 than they
might be in 1971 or later,
especially if Nixon is able to carry
out his planned reduction of U.S.
troops in Vietnam to a permanent
level of 200,000.
The upshot is that it is
impossible to tell what year will
be the best for playing draft
roulette.

Commission in Washington, an
unaffiliated group, the Pentagon
wants 550,000 new soldiers in
1970—enlistees and draftees
combined.
The Pentagon expects that it
will have to draft 260,000 of the
550,000, all of whom must come
from the pool of 850,000.
Newspapers have been creating
the false impression in recent
weeks that only the 250,000 men
drafted out of the total pool will
have to enter the military. This is
inaccurate. ,

The number of men that the
Pentagon—and each individual
draft board—have to induct
depends on the number who
voluntarily enlist because of the
threat of the draft.
What ths means is that the
draft boards are going to go about
five-eighths of the way down the
list from 1 to 366 to fill their
quotas. (The other three-eighths
will escape—including 3,000 of us
at Stanford.) Men high on the list
will be more apt to enlist, but
men with low numbers who
otherwise might have enlisted will
not do so.
Ducking the Draft
For the college student who
wants to duck the draft, it would
be wise to put off getting a 1-A
until a year when the Pentagon's
manpower quota is the smallest
proportion of the total priority
selection 000 l
The pool is larger in 1970 than
it will be in later years, because of
the presence of 250,000
undeferred men from 19 to 26
who are caught up in the
transition from oldest-first to
youngest-first.
But the Pentagon's manpower
needs are larger in 1970 than they
might be in 1971 or later,
especially if Nixon is able to carry
out his planned reduction of U.S.
troops in Vietnam to a permanent
level of 200,000.
The upshot is that it is
impossible to tell what year will
be the best for playing draft
roulette.

FATE PONDERED-An
apprehensive Stan ford ite ponders
his future, which may be sealed at
this afternoon's draft lottery
drawing in Washington.
Today about 3,000 Stanford
students will have their draft
problems solved forever.
That represents three-eighths
of the 8,000 students between 19
and 26 who will have a permanent
draft number assigned to them
today by the first lottery drawing.
According to Alan Strain,
Stanford's draft adviser, at least
that proportion of men will have
their birth date drawn far enough
down on the scale from 1 to 366
to ensure that their local draft
board will never send them an
induction order.
Other men will wake up
tomorrow morning to find out
that the personal threat of the
draft has become worse, or at
least, no better. The crucial factor
for each man is the number he
receives today—a number which
will determine his place on his
draft board's order of call
whenever he loses his deferment
and becomes I-A—in 1970, 1971,
or later.
The magic number is roughly
230.
Reform Explained
Newspaper accounts of the
draft lottery have been confusing
and incomplete. This article will
attempt to explain Nixon's new
system as best as it is understood.
Later articles by draft counselor

Strain will discuss the subtleties in
greater depth.
Nixon's executive order
"reforms" the draft in only one
way—by limiting to one year the
time that a draft board can keep a
I-A youth in its pool available to
fill the board's manpower quota
at any time.
Until now, the oldest I-A's
were drafted first out of the age
group 19 to 26. This meant that a
youth could stay in the limbo of a
I-A for years until the draft board
took him.
The pressure of this
uncertainty coerced many youths
into voluntarily enlisting to obtain
certain privileges in the Army.
Others were "channeled" into
draft-deferred activities like
college, ROTC and war-related
employment.
Policy Reversal
Nixon has now reversed the
order of call—making 19-year-olds
first in line for the draft, along
with college students who have
just lost their 11-S deferments. The
new, "youngest-first" policy was
desired by the Pentagon, which
prefers 19-year-old draftees to the
23, 24 and 25-year-olds who were
making up a large proportion of
recent draft calls.
The "youngest-first" policy
requires some formal mechanism
to decide which men will be

inducted out of the 1-A's, since
the total pool of physically fit
men who turn 19 each year is
almost twice as large as the
Pentagon's current annual
manpower requirement. Also, a
mechanism is needed to make sure
a man doesn't escape the draft
just by growing older.
Nixon's mechanism to do these
things is to limit a man's
vulnerability to one year, and
choose among the eligible pool by
a lottery.
Transition Action
The first lottery will apply to a
different group of men than all
subsequent lotteries. The
difference is caused by the
transition between the old system
and the new.
Today's drawing will give a
number from 1 to 366, based on
his birth date, to every man who
has reached age 19, but not age
26, by January 1. In subsequent
years, the lottery will assign
numbers for all men who become
19 in that calendar year.
A man keeps the same lottery
number, no matter when he loses
his deferment and has to face the
draft. Thus Stanford sophomore
C. Fodder might have his
birthdate, February 13, drawn
today as number 148 from the
glass bowl at Selective Service
headquarters.

Mr. Fodder won't lose his 11-S
deferment until June, 1972, when
ne graduates. At that time he will
enter the "priority selection
group" as the number 148, with
the same vulnerability as all the
undeferred 19-year-olds who had
their birthdate drawn 148 th in the
lottery of 1971.
Through The Numbers
Each board will take all the
number l's in the pool, and then
move on to the number 2's, and
so on. By the end of the year, a
typical board will be down to
about number 230.
A 19-year-old without a
student deferment will begin his
year in the pool on January 1
following his 19th birthday.
If you have a deferment, your
one year of vulnerability is the
calendar year during which you
lose the deferment.
For instance, Mr. Fodder will
be reclassified 1-A in July, 1972.
He will be in the priority selection
group for the draft calls in July
through December of 1972. If his
draft board doesn't take him
during those months, he's free.
If Mr. Fodder prevents the
board from inducting him during
1972 by appeals, his membership
in the priority selection pool is
shifted to 1973 or whenever his
appeals run out.

The much-discussed
"loophole" in Nixon's executive
order is the opportunity for Mr.
Fodder to telephone his draft
board late next year and ask them
if they're down to number 148
yet. If they're only down to
number 100 and don't think
they'll reach his number, Mr.
Fodder can demand that they
reclassify him 1-A immediately
and he will survive his one year in
the pool.
If the draft board, on the other
hand, has reached his number, Mr.
Fodder can keep his 11-Sand wait
for another year.
Manpower Requirements
In 1970, the priority selection
group of 1-A's for the entire
country will number about
850,000 men. According to a
source at the Scientific Manpower
Commission in Washington, an
unaffiliated group, the Pentagon
wants 550,000 new soldiers in
1970—enlistees and draftees
combined.
The Pentagon expects that it
will have to draft 260,000 of the
550,000, all of whom must come
from the pool of 850,000.

headquarters.

Mr. Fodder won't lose his 11-S
deferment until June, 1972, when
ne graduates. At that time he will
enter the "priority selection
group" as the number 148, with
the same vulnerability as all the
undeferred 19-year-olds who had
their birthdate drawn 148 th in the
lottery of 1971.
Through The Numbers
Each board will take all the
number l's in the pool, and then
move on to the number 2's, and
so on. By the end of the year, a
typical board will be down to
about number 230.
A 19-year-old without a
student deferment will begin his
year in the pool on January 1
following his 19th birthday.
If you have a deferment, your
one year of vulnerability is the
calendar year during which you
lose the deferment.
For instance, Mr. Fodder will
be reclassified 1-A in July, 1972.
He will be in the priority selection
group for the draft calls in July
through December of 1972. If his
draft board doesn't take him
during those months, he's free.
If Mr. Fodder prevents the
board from inducting him during
1972 by appeals, his membership
in the priority selection pool is
shifted to 1973 or whenever his
appeals run out.

The much-discussed
"loophole" in Nixon's executive
order is the opportunity for Mr.
Fodder to telephone his draft
board late next year and ask them
if they're down to number 148
yet. If they're only down to
number 100 and don't think
they'll reach his number, Mr.
Fodder can demand that they
reclassify him 1-A immediately
and he will survive his one year in
the pool.
If the draft board, on the other
hand, has reached his number, Mr.
Fodder can keep his 11-Sand wait
for another year.
Manpower Requirements
In 1970, the priority selection
group of 1-A's for the entire
country will number about
850,000 men. According to a
source at the Scientific Manpower
Commission in Washington, an
unaffiliated group, the Pentagon
wants 550,000 new soldiers in
1970—enlistees and draftees
combined.
The Pentagon expects that it
will have to draft 260,000 of the
550,000, all of whom must come
from the pool of 850,000.
Newspapers have been creating
the false impression in recent
weeks that only the 250,000 men
drafted out of the total pool will
have to enter the military. This is
inaccurate. ,

The number of men that the
Pentagon—and each individual
draft board—have to induct
depends on the number who
voluntarily enlist because of the
threat of the draft.
What ths means is that the
draft boards are going to go about
five-eighths of the way down the
list from 1 to 366 to fill their
quotas. (The other three-eighths
will escape—including 3,000 of us
at Stanford.) Men high on the list
will be more apt to enlist, but
men with low numbers who
otherwise might have enlisted will
not do so.
Ducking the Draft
For the college student who
wants to duck the draft, it would
be wise to put off getting a 1-A
until a year when the Pentagon's
manpower quota is the smallest
proportion of the total priority
selection 000 l
The pool is larger in 1970 than
it will be in later years, because of
the presence of 250,000
undeferred men from 19 to 26
who are caught up in the
transition from oldest-first to
youngest-first.
But the Pentagon's manpower
needs are larger in 1970 than they
might be in 1971 or later,
especially if Nixon is able to carry
out his planned reduction of U.S.
troops in Vietnam to a permanent
level of 200,000.
The upshot is that it is
impossible to tell what year will
be the best for playing draft
roulette.

FATE PONDERED-An
apprehensive Stan ford ite ponders
his future, which may be sealed at
this afternoon's draft lottery
drawing in Washington.
Today about 3,000 Stanford
students will have their draft
problems solved forever.
That represents three-eighths
of the 8,000 students between 19
and 26 who will have a permanent
draft number assigned to them
today by the first lottery drawing.
According to Alan Strain,
Stanford's draft adviser, at least
that proportion of men will have
their birth date drawn far enough
down on the scale from 1 to 366
to ensure that their local draft
board will never send them an
induction order.
Other men will wake up
tomorrow morning to find out
that the personal threat of the
draft has become worse, or at
least, no better. The crucial factor
for each man is the number he
receives today—a number which
will determine his place on his
draft board's order of call
whenever he loses his deferment
and becomes I-A—in 1970, 1971,
or later.
The magic number is roughly
230.
Reform Explained
Newspaper accounts of the
draft lottery have been confusing
and incomplete. This article will
attempt to explain Nixon's new
system as best as it is understood.
Later articles by draft counselor

Strain will discuss the subtleties in
greater depth.
Nixon's executive order
"reforms" the draft in only one
way—by limiting to one year the
time that a draft board can keep a
I-A youth in its pool available to
fill the board's manpower quota
at any time.
Until now, the oldest I-A's
were drafted first out of the age
group 19 to 26. This meant that a
youth could stay in the limbo of a
I-A for years until the draft board
took him.
The pressure of this
uncertainty coerced many youths
into voluntarily enlisting to obtain
certain privileges in the Army.
Others were "channeled" into
draft-deferred activities like
college, ROTC and war-related
employment.
Policy Reversal
Nixon has now reversed the
order of call—making 19-year-olds
first in line for the draft, along
with college students who have
just lost their 11-S deferments. The
new, "youngest-first" policy was
desired by the Pentagon, which
prefers 19-year-old draftees to the
23, 24 and 25-year-olds who were
making up a large proportion of
recent draft calls.
The "youngest-first" policy
requires some formal mechanism
to decide which men will be

inducted out of the 1-A's, since
the total pool of physically fit
men who turn 19 each year is
almost twice as large as the
Pentagon's current annual
manpower requirement. Also, a
mechanism is needed to make sure
a man doesn't escape the draft
just by growing older.
Nixon's mechanism to do these
things is to limit a man's
vulnerability to one year, and
choose among the eligible pool by
a lottery.
Transition Action
The first lottery will apply to a
different group of men than all
subsequent lotteries. The
difference is caused by the
transition between the old system
and the new.
Today's drawing will give a
number from 1 to 366, based on
his birth date, to every man who
has reached age 19, but not age
26, by January 1. In subsequent
years, the lottery will assign
numbers for all men who become
19 in that calendar year.
A man keeps the same lottery
number, no matter when he loses
his deferment and has to face the
draft. Thus Stanford sophomore
C. Fodder might have his
birthdate, February 13, drawn
today as number 148 from the
glass bowl at Selective Service
headquarters.

Mr. Fodder won't lose his 11-S
deferment until June, 1972, when
ne graduates. At that time he will
enter the "priority selection
group" as the number 148, with
the same vulnerability as all the
undeferred 19-year-olds who had
their birthdate drawn 148 th in the
lottery of 1971.

Each board will take all the
number l's in the pool, and then
move on to the number 2's, and
so on. By the end of the year, a
typical board will be down to
about number 230.
A 19-year-old without a
student deferment will begin his
year in the pool on January 1
following his 19th birthday.
If you have a deferment, your
one year of vulnerability is the
calendar year during which you
lose the deferment.
For instance, Mr. Fodder will
be reclassified 1-A in July, 1972.
He will be in the priority selection

through December of 1972. If his
draft board doesn't take him

Until now, the oldest I-A's
were drafted first out of the age
group 19 to 26. This meant that a
youth could stay in the limbo of a
I-A for years until the draft board
took him.
The pressure of this
uncertainty coerced many youths
into voluntarily enlisting to obtain
certain privileges in the Army.
Others were "channeled" into
draft-deferred activities like
college, ROTC and war-related
employment.
Policy Reversal
Nixon has now reversed the
order of call—making 19-year-olds
first in line for the draft, along
with college students who have
just lost their 11-S deferments. The
new, "youngest-first" policy was
desired by the Pentagon, which
prefers 19-year-old draftees to the
23, 24 and 25-year-olds who were
making up a large proportion of
recent draft calls.
The "youngest-first" policy
requires some formal mechanism
to decide which men will be

inducted out of the 1-A's, since
the total pool of physically fit
men who turn 19 each year is
almost twice as large as the
Pentagon's current annual
manpower requirement. Also, a
mechanism is needed to make sure
a man doesn't escape the draft
just by growing older.
Nixon's mechanism to do these
things is to limit a man's
vulnerability to one year, and
choose among the eligible pool by
a lottery.
Transition Action
The first lottery will apply to a
different group of men than all
subsequent lotteries. The
difference is caused by the
transition between the old system
and the new.
Today's drawing will give a
number from 1 to 366, based on
his birth date, to every man who
has reached age 19, but not age
26, by January 1. In subsequent
years, the lottery will assign
numbers for all men who become
19 in that calendar year.
A man keeps the same lottery
number, no matter when he loses
his deferment and has to face the
draft. Thus Stanford sophomore
C. Fodder might have his
birthdate, February 13, drawn
today as number 148 from the
glass bowl at Selective Service
headquarters.

Mr. Fodder won't lose his 11-S
deferment until June, 1972, when
ne graduates. At that time he will
enter the "priority selection
group" as the number 148, with
the same vulnerability as all the
undeferred 19-year-olds who had
their birthdate drawn 148 th in the
lottery of 1971.
Through The Numbers
Each board will take all the
number l's in the pool, and then
move on to the number 2's, and
so on. By the end of the year, a
typical board will be down to
about number 230.
A 19-year-old without a
student deferment will begin his
year in the pool on January 1
following his 19th birthday.
If you have a deferment, your
one year of vulnerability is the
calendar year during which you
lose the deferment.
For instance, Mr. Fodder will
be reclassified 1-A in July, 1972.
He will be in the priority selection
group for the draft calls in July
through December of 1972. If his
draft board doesn't take him
during those months, he's free.
If Mr. Fodder prevents the
board from inducting him during
1972 by appeals, his membership
in the priority selection pool is
shifted to 1973 or whenever his
appeals run out.

The much-discussed
"loophole" in Nixon's executive
order is the opportunity for Mr.
Fodder to telephone his draft
board late next year and ask them
if they're down to number 148
yet. If they're only down to
number 100 and don't think
they'll reach his number, Mr.
Fodder can demand that they
reclassify him 1-A immediately
and he will survive his one year in
the pool.
If the draft board, on the other
hand, has reached his number, Mr.
Fodder can keep his 11-Sand wait
for another year.
Manpower Requirements
In 1970, the priority selection
group of 1-A's for the entire
country will number about
850,000 men. According to a
source at the Scientific Manpower
Commission in Washington, an
unaffiliated group, the Pentagon
wants 550,000 new soldiers in
1970—enlistees and draftees
combined.
The Pentagon expects that it
will have to draft 260,000 of the
550,000, all of whom must come
from the pool of 850,000.
Newspapers have been creating
the false impression in recent
weeks that only the 250,000 men
drafted out of the total pool will
have to enter the military. This is
inaccurate. ,

The number of men that the
Pentagon—and each individual
draft board—have to induct
depends on the number who
voluntarily enlist because of the
threat of the draft.
What ths means is that the
draft boards are going to go about
five-eighths of the way down the
list from 1 to 366 to fill their
quotas. (The other three-eighths
will escape—including 3,000 of us
at Stanford.) Men high on the list
will be more apt to enlist, but
men with low numbers who
otherwise might have enlisted will
not do so.
Ducking the Draft
For the college student who
wants to duck the draft, it would
be wise to put off getting a 1-A
until a year when the Pentagon's
manpower quota is the smallest
proportion of the total priority
selection 000 l
The pool is larger in 1970 than
it will be in later years, because of
the presence of 250,000
undeferred men from 19 to 26
who are caught up in the
transition from oldest-first to
youngest-first.
But the Pentagon's manpower
needs are larger in 1970 than they
might be in 1971 or later,
especially if Nixon is able to carry
out his planned reduction of U.S.
troops in Vietnam to a permanent
level of 200,000.
The upshot is that it is
impossible to tell what year will
be the best for playing draft
roulette.

FATE PONDERED-An
apprehensive Stan ford ite ponders
his future, which may be sealed at
this afternoon's draft lottery
drawing in Washington.
Today about 3,000 Stanford
students will have their draft
problems solved forever.
That represents three-eighths
of the 8,000 students between 19
and 26 who will have a permanent
draft number assigned to them
today by the first lottery drawing.
According to Alan Strain,
Stanford's draft adviser, at least
that proportion of men will have
their birth date drawn far enough
down on the scale from 1 to 366
to ensure that their local draft
board will never send them an
induction order.
Other men will wake up
tomorrow morning to find out
that the personal threat of the
draft has become worse, or at
least, no better. The crucial factor
for each man is the number he
receives today—a number which
will determine his place on his
draft board's order of call
whenever he loses his deferment
and becomes I-A—in 1970, 1971,
or later.
The magic number is roughly
230.
Reform Explained
Newspaper accounts of the
draft lottery have been confusing
and incomplete. This article will
attempt to explain Nixon's new
system as best as it is understood.
Later articles by draft counselor

Strain will discuss the subtleties in
greater depth.
Nixon's executive order
"reforms" the draft in only one
way—by limiting to one year the
time that a draft board can keep a
I-A youth in its pool available to
fill the board's manpower quota
at any time.
Until now, the oldest I-A's
were drafted first out of the age
group 19 to 26. This meant that a
youth could stay in the limbo of a
I-A for years until the draft board

The pressure of this
