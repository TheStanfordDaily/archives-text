Charter A irlines
Editor, THE DAILY:
In noting the advertisements
around the Stanford campus for
charter flight to Europe, the
Orient, the East Coast and
elsewhere, I would like to point
out some important facts. These
charter airlines, such as World
Airways, Trans International
Airlines, Saturn, etc., not only fly
you economically to London or
Expo '70, but also fly troops to
Vietnam under government
contract. In fact, the charter
airlines depend on military
contracts for 50% of their
business.
As a former stewardess, who
was fired by World Airways for
refusing to fly to Vietnam again
due to fear and convictions, I can
well vouch for my statements.
I urge your readers to consider,
before they buy their vacation
tickets, that these charter airlines,
as well as international
commercial airlines, such as Pan
American, not only are joy rides
but also are death carriers.

The article concerning the
medical-student-operated
Livingston clinic presented a
number of misinterpretations. It
blessed with quotation marks a
number of oversimplified
statements that in one case were
diammetrically opposed to
anything I have ever said.

One point I tried to convey to
the DAILY reporter was that the
Livingston clinic is by no means
an innovative answer to the health
care needs of poor people. Free,
hand-me-down medical care has
long been practiced on poor
people. I don't think the Stanford
students' attitude was that of the
conscience-assuaging benevolent
missionaries, but nevertheless,
present illness-oriented medical
treatment is part of a
long-standing tradition of
short-sighted medical care.
There is now in the works a
proposal for a community-owned
and directed primary care center
in Livingston, developed in
conjunction with Stanford's
attempt to formulate viable
models of comprehensive rural
family health care. It is perhaps
this program, which is in its
nascent stages, which the DAILY
confused with the free night clinic
when it used the word
'innovative.'

Editor, THE DAILY:
I was surprised in reading
Wednesday's DAILY report on
Father Boyle's talk of last
evening, to learn that "Boyle said
he backs the whole Panther
program." Father Boyle went to
some length in his concluding
remarks to stress that he does not
agree completely with everything
the Panthers say and do, that he
tells them so, and that they in

turn freely correct whatever
misinterpretations he may have
made of their activities. He
described a relationship of allies in
a common cause who are free to
discuss their relatively minor
differences. He certainly did not
say, as your reporter quoted him,
"I agree with every bit of their
philosophy and their program." I
do not see what purpose is served
by such a mis-statement of fact.
Sloppy reporting is perhaps
inevitable in undergraduate
journalism, but at least you
should exercise more caution in
the use of quotation marks.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Ellen Willis in her articles
"Critical Look at Theory of
Consumerism," (DAILY, 18 &
19 th Nov.) correctly rejects
consumerism for all the wrong
reasons. Wasn't it enough to
pinpoint the radical intellectuals
dislike of capitalism and their
feeling of superiority to the
working class, without confusing
the issue with the so-called
'sex-war'? Wasn't it enough to
make the first of the four
propositions ". . .buying habits
are by and large a rational and
self-interested response .. ."
without tacking on the ludicrous
proposition that "The chief
function of media sterotypes of
women is not to sell goods but to
reinforce the ideology . . .of male
supremacy." This latter is about
as sensible as saying that the chief
function of media stereotypes of
teen-agers for example, is to
reinforce the ideology of adult
supremacy, rather than to sell
Coca-Cola.
What a pity the author did not
stick to the logic of her first
proposition. If buying habits are
rational and self-interested then
people do indeed have control
over "what is produced, in what
amounts, under what conditions
etc." With every purchase they
cast their votes and corporations,
concerned only with their profits,
count the votes attentively. Note
it is "people" who have the votes,
not "the People." If radicals
object to this they should aim to
give the People more votes (i.e.
higher incomes) not to destroy
the electoral (market) system
which responds remarkably well
to the voters' (consumers') wishes.
It is interesting to speculate
whether the People would react to
more votes in the way the radicals
predict. Would more "decent
apartments" be bought rather
than T.V. sets? Would 'shoddy'
goods disappear? The eivdence is
not encouraging. Detergent is not
bought primarily by the affluent,
yet the People did not vote
overwhelmingly for 'Square-Deal
Surf' when it was introduced to
offer an alternative to 'free-gift'
gimmickry. Gasoline stations that
give up trading stamps soon learn
where the People prefer to buy
their gasoline. The People were so
enthusiastic about having seat
belts in automobiles that it took
an act of Congress to make them
decide to buy them.
By all means give the People
more votes if that is your
philosophy, but be prepared to
abide by their decision. Don't
destroy the voting apparatus
simply to make it easier to
'prescribe' medicine that you
think he People ought to have and
what's more ought to enjoy
having. And don't be surprised if
women, as 50 per cent of the
People, buy exactly the same
things as at present, only more so.

I was surprised in reading
Wednesday's DAILY report on
Father Boyle's talk of last
evening, to learn that "Boyle said
he backs the whole Panther
program." Father Boyle went to
some length in his concluding
remarks to stress that he does not
agree completely with everything
the Panthers say and do, that he
tells them so, and that they in

turn freely correct whatever
misinterpretations he may have
made of their activities. He
described a relationship of allies in
a common cause who are free to
discuss their relatively minor
differences. He certainly did not
say, as your reporter quoted him,
"I agree with every bit of their
philosophy and their program." I
do not see what purpose is served
by such a mis-statement of fact.
Sloppy reporting is perhaps
inevitable in undergraduate
journalism, but at least you
should exercise more caution in
the use of quotation marks.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Ellen Willis in her articles
"Critical Look at Theory of
Consumerism," (DAILY, 18 &
19 th Nov.) correctly rejects
consumerism for all the wrong
reasons. Wasn't it enough to
pinpoint the radical intellectuals
dislike of capitalism and their
feeling of superiority to the
working class, without confusing
the issue with the so-called
'sex-war'? Wasn't it enough to
make the first of the four
propositions ". . .buying habits
are by and large a rational and
self-interested response .. ."
without tacking on the ludicrous
proposition that "The chief
function of media sterotypes of
women is not to sell goods but to
reinforce the ideology . . .of male
supremacy." This latter is about
as sensible as saying that the chief
function of media stereotypes of
teen-agers for example, is to
reinforce the ideology of adult
supremacy, rather than to sell
Coca-Cola.
What a pity the author did not
stick to the logic of her first
proposition. If buying habits are
rational and self-interested then
people do indeed have control
over "what is produced, in what
amounts, under what conditions
etc." With every purchase they
cast their votes and corporations,
concerned only with their profits,
count the votes attentively. Note
it is "people" who have the votes,
not "the People." If radicals
object to this they should aim to
give the People more votes (i.e.
higher incomes) not to destroy
the electoral (market) system
which responds remarkably well
to the voters' (consumers') wishes.
It is interesting to speculate
whether the People would react to
more votes in the way the radicals
predict. Would more "decent
apartments" be bought rather
than T.V. sets? Would 'shoddy'
goods disappear? The eivdence is
not encouraging. Detergent is not
bought primarily by the affluent,
yet the People did not vote
overwhelmingly for 'Square-Deal
Surf' when it was introduced to
offer an alternative to 'free-gift'
gimmickry. Gasoline stations that
give up trading stamps soon learn
where the People prefer to buy
their gasoline. The People were so
enthusiastic about having seat
belts in automobiles that it took
an act of Congress to make them
decide to buy them.
By all means give the People
more votes if that is your
philosophy, but be prepared to
abide by their decision. Don't
destroy the voting apparatus
simply to make it easier to
'prescribe' medicine that you
think he People ought to have and
what's more ought to enjoy
having. And don't be surprised if
women, as 50 per cent of the
People, buy exactly the same
things as at present, only more so.

In noting the advertisements
around the Stanford campus for
charter flight to Europe, the
Orient, the East Coast and
elsewhere, I would like to point
out some important facts. These
charter airlines, such as World
Airways, Trans International
Airlines, Saturn, etc., not only fly
you economically to London or
Expo '70, but also fly troops to
Vietnam under government
contract. In fact, the charter
airlines depend on military
contracts for 50% of their
business.
As a former stewardess, who
was fired by World Airways for
refusing to fly to Vietnam again
due to fear and convictions, I can
well vouch for my statements.
I urge your readers to consider,
before they buy their vacation
tickets, that these charter airlines,
as well as international
commercial airlines, such as Pan
American, not only are joy rides
but also are death carriers.

The article concerning the
medical-student-operated
Livingston clinic presented a
number of misinterpretations. It
blessed with quotation marks a
number of oversimplified
statements that in one case were
diammetrically opposed to
anything I have ever said.

One point I tried to convey to
the DAILY reporter was that the
Livingston clinic is by no means
an innovative answer to the health
care needs of poor people. Free,
hand-me-down medical care has
long been practiced on poor
people. I don't think the Stanford
students' attitude was that of the
conscience-assuaging benevolent
missionaries, but nevertheless,
present illness-oriented medical
treatment is part of a
long-standing tradition of
short-sighted medical care.
There is now in the works a
proposal for a community-owned
and directed primary care center
in Livingston, developed in
conjunction with Stanford's
attempt to formulate viable
models of comprehensive rural
family health care. It is perhaps
this program, which is in its
nascent stages, which the DAILY
confused with the free night clinic
when it used the word

rational and self-interested then
people do indeed have control
over "what is produced, in what
amounts, under what conditions
etc." With every purchase they
cast their votes and corporations,
concerned only with their profits,
count the votes attentively. Note
it is "people" who have the votes,
not "the People." If radicals
object to this they should aim to
give the People more votes (i.e.
higher incomes) not to destroy
the electoral (market) system
which responds remarkably well
to the voters' (consumers') wishes.
It is interesting to speculate
whether the People would react to
more votes in the way the radicals
predict. Would more "decent
apartments" be bought rather
than T.V. sets? Would 'shoddy'
goods disappear? The eivdence is
not encouraging. Detergent is not
bought primarily by the affluent,
yet the People did not vote
overwhelmingly for 'Square-Deal
Surf' when it was introduced to
offer an alternative to 'free-gift'
gimmickry. Gasoline stations that
give up trading stamps soon learn
where the People prefer to buy
their gasoline. The People were so
enthusiastic about having seat
belts in automobiles that it took
an act of Congress to make them
decide to buy them.
By all means give the People
more votes if that is your
philosophy, but be prepared to
abide by their decision. Don't
destroy the voting apparatus
simply to make it easier to
'prescribe' medicine that you
think he People ought to have and
what's more ought to enjoy
having. And don't be surprised if
women, as 50 per cent of the
People, buy exactly the same
things as at present, only more so.

Charter A irlines
Editor, THE DAILY:
In noting the advertisements
around the Stanford campus for
charter flight to Europe, the
Orient, the East Coast and
elsewhere, I would like to point
out some important facts. These
charter airlines, such as World
Airways, Trans International
Airlines, Saturn, etc., not only fly
you economically to London or
Expo '70, but also fly troops to
Vietnam under government
contract. In fact, the charter
airlines depend on military
contracts for 50% of their
business.
As a former stewardess, who
was fired by World Airways for
refusing to fly to Vietnam again
due to fear and convictions, I can
well vouch for my statements.
I urge your readers to consider,
before they buy their vacation
tickets, that these charter airlines,
as well as international
commercial airlines, such as Pan
American, not only are joy rides
but also are death carriers.

The article concerning the
medical-student-operated
Livingston clinic presented a
number of misinterpretations. It
blessed with quotation marks a
number of oversimplified
statements that in one case were
diammetrically opposed to
anything I have ever said.

One point I tried to convey to
the DAILY reporter was that the
Livingston clinic is by no means
an innovative answer to the health
care needs of poor people. Free,
hand-me-down medical care has
long been practiced on poor
people. I don't think the Stanford
students' attitude was that of the
conscience-assuaging benevolent
missionaries, but nevertheless,
present illness-oriented medical
treatment is part of a
long-standing tradition of
short-sighted medical care.
There is now in the works a
proposal for a community-owned
and directed primary care center
in Livingston, developed in
conjunction with Stanford's
attempt to formulate viable
models of comprehensive rural
family health care. It is perhaps
this program, which is in its
nascent stages, which the DAILY
confused with the free night clinic
when it used the word
'innovative.'

I was surprised in reading
Wednesday's DAILY report on
Father Boyle's talk of last
evening, to learn that "Boyle said
he backs the whole Panther
program." Father Boyle went to
some length in his concluding
remarks to stress that he does not
agree completely with everything
the Panthers say and do, that he
tells them so, and that they in

turn freely correct whatever
misinterpretations he may have
made of their activities. He
described a relationship of allies in
a common cause who are free to
discuss their relatively minor
differences. He certainly did not
say, as your reporter quoted him,
"I agree with every bit of their
philosophy and their program." I
do not see what purpose is served
by such a mis-statement of fact.
Sloppy reporting is perhaps
inevitable in undergraduate
journalism, but at least you
should exercise more caution in
the use of quotation marks.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Ellen Willis in her articles
"Critical Look at Theory of
Consumerism," (DAILY, 18 &
19 th Nov.) correctly rejects
consumerism for all the wrong
reasons. Wasn't it enough to
pinpoint the radical intellectuals
dislike of capitalism and their
feeling of superiority to the
working class, without confusing
the issue with the so-called
'sex-war'? Wasn't it enough to
make the first of the four
propositions ". . .buying habits
are by and large a rational and
self-interested response .. ."
without tacking on the ludicrous
proposition that "The chief
function of media sterotypes of
women is not to sell goods but to
reinforce the ideology . . .of male
supremacy." This latter is about
as sensible as saying that the chief
function of media stereotypes of
teen-agers for example, is to
reinforce the ideology of adult
supremacy, rather than to sell
Coca-Cola.
What a pity the author did not
stick to the logic of her first
proposition. If buying habits are
rational and self-interested then
people do indeed have control
over "what is produced, in what
amounts, under what conditions
etc." With every purchase they
