## Haynsworth Story 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON—The news of
Judge Haynsworth's defeat for the
Supreme Court caused soul
searching in newspaper city rooms
and television stations throughout
the country.
Sensitive to attacks made by
Vice President Agnew on all the
media, the liberal Eastern
establishment press and three TV
networks gathered at the home of
Averell Harriman in Washington,
D.C. to discuss how to play the
story.
One network spokesman said
that he felt under the
circumstances it would be best
not to break the news of President
Nixon's biggest defeat to the
American people. "The Silent
Majority would feel we were using
our power to criticize the
President's failure to round up
enough votes for his Supreme
Court choice."
A wire service representative
felt that even though the vote had
gone against President Nixon it
was still news. "It's true that we
would have preferred Haynsworth
to win just so the heat would have
been off us," he said, "but I'm
sure the American people will
realize that we had no ulterior
motive in sending out the
Haynsworth story."
Right On
A leading newspaper editor
said, "Perhaps we could report the
Haynsworth rejection without
going into the details of how
badly the vote went against him.
We could put the story
somewhere in the back of the
paper where no one would see it."

Another network vice
president said, "That's all right for
you people. But if we go on the
air and say that Haynsworth was
voted down, Agnew will demand
equal time to say we've been
coloring the news."
A syndicated columnist said,
"Couldn't we say that
Haynsworth had been rejected by
a small vociferous minority of 55
men on Capitol Hill who did not
speak for the country?"
An editor of a news magazine
said, "The problem as I see it, is
that if we all print and report the
same story of Haynsworth's
defeat we will be accused of
speaking with the same voice.
Why couldn't some of the media
say he won, and some say he lost?
In that way we wouldn't be
attacked for being a small elite
band of opinionmakers who are out
to destroy the President."
A third network spokesman
said, "It's a good suggestion but I
feel after re-examining our own
coverage of the news we could
avoid criticism by indicating that
something went wrong at the
Supreme Court today, but not
saying exactly what it was. This
way we would be covering the
news, but we would not do
anything to annoy the
Administration."
The president of a monopoly
newspaper chain said, "That's not
a bad idea. In that way the White
House might be put in a position
of having to announce the news
themselves, and then we would be
free to print it."
A radio executive said, "I think
we should call Attv. Gen. John

Mitchell and ask his permission. If
he believes we can all report the
story without violating the First
Amendment, then we should go
ahead."
"I doubt if Atty. Gen. Mitchell
will agree to let us go ahead. After
all, Haynsworth was his boy for
the Supreme Court job."
From then on the members of
the liberal Eastern Establishment
news media got into a violent
argument over whether the
Haynsworth defeat was news, or
would just be playing into the
hands of the enemies of the Nixon
Administration. It was finally
decided to bring it to a vote.
As each man's name was called
he stood up and declared his
position. The final outcome was
that 55 voted to break the story
and 45 were opposed.
And that's how the American
people found out that Judge
Clement Haynsworth was not
confirmed for Justice Abe Fortas'
seat on the United States Supreme
Court.
Correction
Daniel Dresner was
incorrectly indentified in the
Nov. 19 DAILY as a biology
professor. In reality he claims
status as a graduate student. He
also says that he has been
subjected to some harrassment
because of this error. He has
subjected us to some
harrassment so we're printing

say he won, and some say he lost?
In that way we wouldn't be
attacked for being a small elite
band of opinionmakers who are out
to destroy the President."
A third network spokesman
said, "It's a good suggestion but I
feel after re-examining our own
coverage of the news we could
avoid criticism by indicating that
something went wrong at the
Supreme Court today, but not
saying exactly what it was. This
way we would be covering the
news, but we would not do
anything to annoy the
Administration."
The president of a monopoly
newspaper chain said, "That's not
a bad idea. In that way the White
House might be put in a position
of having to announce the news
themselves, and then we would be
free to print it."
A radio executive said, "I think
we should call Attv. Gen. John

Mitchell and ask his permission. If
he believes we can all report the
story without violating the First
Amendment, then we should go
ahead."
"I doubt if Atty. Gen. Mitchell
will agree to let us go ahead. After
all, Haynsworth was his boy for
the Supreme Court job."
From then on the members of
the liberal Eastern Establishment
news media got into a violent
argument over whether the
Haynsworth defeat was news, or
would just be playing into the
hands of the enemies of the Nixon
Administration. It was finally
decided to bring it to a vote.
As each man's name was called
he stood up and declared his
position. The final outcome was
that 55 voted to break the story
and 45 were opposed.
And that's how the American
people found out that Judge
Clement Haynsworth was not
confirmed for Justice Abe Fortas'
seat on the United States Supreme
Court.

WASHINGTON—The news of
Judge Haynsworth's defeat for the
Supreme Court caused soul
searching in newspaper city rooms
and television stations throughout
the country.
Sensitive to attacks made by
Vice President Agnew on all the
media, the liberal Eastern
establishment press and three TV
networks gathered at the home of
Averell Harriman in Washington,
D.C. to discuss how to play the
story.
One network spokesman said
that he felt under the
circumstances it would be best
not to break the news of President
Nixon's biggest defeat to the
American people. "The Silent
Majority would feel we were using
our power to criticize the
President's failure to round up
enough votes for his Supreme
Court choice."
A wire service representative
felt that even though the vote had
gone against President Nixon it
was still news. "It's true that we
would have preferred Haynsworth
to win just so the heat would have
been off us," he said, "but I'm
sure the American people will
realize that we had no ulterior
motive in sending out the
Haynsworth story."
Right On
A leading newspaper editor
said, "Perhaps we could report the
Haynsworth rejection without
going into the details of how
badly the vote went against him.
We could put the story
somewhere in the back of the
paper where no one would see it."

Another network vice
president said, "That's all right for
you people. But if we go on the
air and say that Haynsworth was
voted down, Agnew will demand
equal time to say we've been
coloring the news."
A syndicated columnist said,
"Couldn't we say that
Haynsworth had been rejected by
a small vociferous minority of 55
men on Capitol Hill who did not
speak for the country?"
An editor of a news magazine
said, "The problem as I see it, is
that if we all print and report the
same story of Haynsworth's
defeat we will be accused of
speaking with the same voice.
Why couldn't some of the media
say he won, and some say he lost?
In that way we wouldn't be
attacked for being a small elite
band of opinionmakers who are out
to destroy the President."
