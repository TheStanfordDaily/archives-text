# Hazards To Man
## Statistics And Law 
### Joshua Luderberg 
Part of the confusion about the
"safety" of food additives and
other environmental risks is the
gap between statistics and law.
The 1958 (Delaney) revision of
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
required that a food additive be
tested and found "safe" for
human consumption before it
could be certified for sale.
However, "safe" has never been
legally defined, and its
interpretation is left to the
discretion of the Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare.
The act does make one restriction,
that nothing can be called safe if
it causes cancer on feeding to any
animal.
Theoretical objections can be
raised against this principle, but it
has had the practical effect of
forcing administrative actions in
doubtful circumstances where the
public was bearing the risks of the
uncertainty. For example, there is
no certain proof at this time that
cyclamate causes cancer in man.
However, industrial chemicals like
naphthylamine that are well
known to cause human bladder
cancer, have a latent period
averaging fifteen years before they
show their effect. Were we to wait
another decade before pushing
back on cyclamate (which
produces cyclohexylamine in the
body), we might be committing r>

million Americans to bladder
cancer while this massive "clinical
trial" was going on.
Against Essentials
It is also true that the Delaney
clause might be invoked against
essential dietary constituents that
could cause cancer in animals in
very high doses. In fact, these may
have something to do with an
irreducible burden of cancer that
arises as a byproduct of normal
metabolism. However, cyclamate
is quite dispensable, and it is folly
to take such risks with it.
The Delaney clause could
indeed by modified for greater
scientific precision. New agents
should be tested for mutations
and congenital malformations as
well as cancer. As we develop
better theories of and
experiemntal models for other
chronic diseases like hypertension
and atherosclerosis, these should
also be covered. Cancer has taken
first place in this list mainly
because we already have
well-established animal tests for it.
On the other hand, if a
quantitative meaning can be
attached to ideas like "zero
tolerance" and "safety," we might
make the law more flexible.
Cancer in an animal should be
taken as a grave presumption of
hazard for man but not a final
proof of it. It is also true that
every mouthful of food that any
American eats for the next
century will contain at least one
molecule of DDT, so that a "zero
tolerance," taken literally would
be absurd.
Firm Standards
The law must set firm
standards of expected safety as a
logical basis of the tests that
attempt to show whether the
standard is met. An additive
surely should not harm as many as
one per million of its innocent
users. This standard would be
regarded as criminally lax if we
knew that 200 Americans a year
were being killed. On the other
hand, it is very difficult to get
advance assurance about any
additive with such precision. We
can do experiments in animals
with high doses to look for
possible trouble. We can
investigate the biochemical
mechanism of action. We can try
to find the formula that governs
the relationship of effect to dose.
If there is a presumption of
hazard, we might then still reply
to it, and set tolerances for human
use—but only if there is a
convincing argument that they
meet the safety standard.
Secretary Finch has recently
announced the relaxation of his
categorical ban on cyclamate. The
current state of research puts
cyclamate, as commonly used, far
above the one-per-milli on
standard; but much more work
would be needed to understand
the exact dimensions of the
hazard. If another standard of
safety underlies these
administrative judgments, this is a
number that ought to be
advertised on the labels.

show their effect. Were we to wait
another decade before pushing
back on cyclamate (which
produces cyclohexylamine in the
body), we might be committing r>

million Americans to bladder
cancer while this massive "clinical
trial" was going on.
Against Essentials
It is also true that the Delaney
clause might be invoked against
essential dietary constituents that
could cause cancer in animals in
very high doses. In fact, these may
have something to do with an
irreducible burden of cancer that
arises as a byproduct of normal
metabolism. However, cyclamate
is quite dispensable, and it is folly
to take such risks with it.
The Delaney clause could
indeed by modified for greater
scientific precision. New agents
should be tested for mutations
and congenital malformations as
well as cancer. As we develop
better theories of and
experiemntal models for other
chronic diseases like hypertension
and atherosclerosis, these should
also be covered. Cancer has taken
first place in this list mainly
because we already have
well-established animal tests for it.
On the other hand, if a
quantitative meaning can be
attached to ideas like "zero
tolerance" and "safety," we might
make the law more flexible.
Cancer in an animal should be
taken as a grave presumption of
hazard for man but not a final
proof of it. It is also true that
every mouthful of food that any
American eats for the next
century will contain at least one
molecule of DDT, so that a "zero
tolerance," taken literally would
be absurd.
Firm Standards
The law must set firm
standards of expected safety as a
logical basis of the tests that
attempt to show whether the
standard is met. An additive
surely should not harm as many as
one per million of its innocent
users. This standard would be
regarded as criminally lax if we
knew that 200 Americans a year
were being killed. On the other
hand, it is very difficult to get
advance assurance about any
additive with such precision. We
can do experiments in animals
with high doses to look for
possible trouble. We can
investigate the biochemical
mechanism of action. We can try
to find the formula that governs
the relationship of effect to dose.
If there is a presumption of
hazard, we might then still reply
to it, and set tolerances for human
use—but only if there is a
convincing argument that they
meet the safety standard.
Secretary Finch has recently
announced the relaxation of his
categorical ban on cyclamate. The
current state of research puts
cyclamate, as commonly used, far
above the one-per-milli on
standard; but much more work
would be needed to understand
the exact dimensions of the
hazard. If another standard of
safety underlies these
administrative judgments, this is a
number that ought to be
advertised on the labels.
Part of the confusion about the
"safety" of food additives and
other environmental risks is the
gap between statistics and law.
The 1958 (Delaney) revision of
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
required that a food additive be
tested and found "safe" for
human consumption before it
could be certified for sale.
However, "safe" has never been
legally defined, and its
interpretation is left to the
discretion of the Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare.
The act does make one restriction,
that nothing can be called safe if
it causes cancer on feeding to any
animal.
Theoretical objections can be
raised against this principle, but it
has had the practical effect of
forcing administrative actions in
doubtful circumstances where the
public was bearing the risks of the
uncertainty. For example, there is
no certain proof at this time that
cyclamate causes cancer in man.
However, industrial chemicals like
naphthylamine that are well
known to cause human bladder
cancer, have a latent period
averaging fifteen years before they
show their effect. Were we to wait
another decade before pushing
back on cyclamate (which
produces cyclohexylamine in the
body), we might be committing r>

million Americans to bladder
cancer while this massive "clinical
