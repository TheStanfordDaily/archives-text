# Napier: Revolutionary At Mem Chu
## 
### ANNE EGGEBROTEN 
B. Davie Napier, in his fourth
year as Dean of the Chapel, will
take a six-month sabbatical
beginning in January.
He plans to devote his full time
to writing during the first three
months in Puerto Rico followed
by visiting and studying in he
U.S., Europe and the Near East.

The Rev. Wnvne R. Rood,
from Pacific School of nettgion at
Berkeley, will serve as acting dean.
Below, DAILY staffer Anne
Eggebroten paints a warm picture
■)f Napier—his daily routine, his
beliefs, and how others see him.

Riding his bike, pounding out jazz for students crowded around a
piano, flaunting a Bob Hope style of situational humor at the most
ceremonious of occasions—Dean B. Davie Napier has become a
popular figure on campus.
At other times he has broken into his own office by climbing in the
window, played "Somebody to Love" as part of the sermon, mixed
up who was in the ark, and naively set due dates of class papers for
"as soon as possible."
He's "always running, always at least five minutes behind
schedule," admits his assistant Diane Kenney, but it's always because
he stops to talk with anyone who approaches him.
He and his wife Joy run a 24-hour open house just off the row,
with students dropping in at all hours. They invite dormitories and
fraternities over several times per quarter, in addition to such regular
as t.hp Mendicants, the DAILY staff, and the University choir.
Napier himself sees 20 to 30 students per week by appointment for
talking or counseling. With his slim sideburns, appealing grin, and
ready chuckle, he gains easy rapport with students.
Mem Chu Revolutionized
However, Stanford administrators often wish he's cause a little less
trouble for them
Napier has revolutionized use of Memorial Church. Allowing
Moratorium meetings, Joan Baez shows, all-night peace vigils, and
Marat Sade performances (all never heard of in Mem Chu), he has
made it a focal point of the Stanford community.
Before he came to Stanford three years ago, nothing other than
straight Biblican material was read out of the pulpit. Today the "Now
Testament" is heard as well—whether it be taken from Soul on Ice,
Dylan, the Beatles or T.S. Eliot, and whether it concern racism, the
war in Vietnam or the government in Washington.
Not only does he talk, he participates in the movements as well.
This often causes problems for the university administration,
concerned with preserving Stanford's image among conservative
alumni, educators, and the U.S. government.
In fact, irate letters have ol'ten caused Napier himself hours of
painful consideration and explanation, though adverse criticism now
bothers him less than at first.
"I would violate my own integrity as a man called of God if 1 did
not speak out against the obscenity in our society which is counter to
he love of God," the Dean maintains, impassioned on his subject.

"How can you address the love of God to the problems of
existence without speaking to the social and political issues which
concern us? The prophets spoke of God as the Holy One in your
midst. If he's not in your midst, why bother to speak about him at
all?"
Monsters of Social Evil
Napier affirms that not only personal problems but the "monsters
of social evil are vulnerable to Jesus Christ."
Gesturing forcefully with the circular movement of one hand
drawing the words out, Napier burns with intensity from the small
bright eyes behind glasses.
"He has a terrific force that's almost scary; his volatility sometimes
give the impression of his being quick-tempered," says his wife.
Despite images of Napier as a man of force, tremendous
enthusiasm, humor and friendliness, his close friends agree that few
people know him well.
"He's very, very sentitive—basically he's a poet," states Miss
Kenney.
Napier insists on keeping his mornings free, going out each day by
8 a.m. to the cottage in back of his house to write, sometimes even
disconnecting the office phone.
He is a perfectionist, in his writing, from prayers and sermons to the
five books he had published. Most recent is Come Sweet Death, a
book of poems on Old Testament themes.
Critical of his personal appearance as well as his writing, "BDN"
swims an hour each day at the faculty club and skips lunches to stay
near the 160-pound weight with which he feels most comfortable.
Napier admits to being a "very sensitive guy," saying that as a child
his parents had only to frown to punish him. Born in 1915 in China of
Southern Baptist missionaries, he was tutored for several years by his
mother and then attended American schools in China.
Planned to Take English
Never intending to be a minister, Napier graduated from a small
Southern college, planning to attend Yale for a Ph.D. in English. But
when his brother urged him to try a year of seminary with him, Davie
agreed.
"I got really excited about the Old Testament and decided to be a
writer, a novelist whose special field was the Old Testament—sort of
historical novelist," he remembers.
Still intending only to write and teach afttt getting out of
seminary, he accepted a teaching job which also involved being
chaplain. This required him to be ordained as a minister, and ever
since he has been alternately or simultaneously a professor, writer and
minister, acquiring along the way the degrees of Ph.D., D.D. and
Litt.D.
Before he came to Stanford, friends at Yale who were aware of his
sensitivity warned him about coming, saying, "There, you're going to
be exposed."
Having taught at Yale for 17 years, Napier had a name
professorship and the prestigious position of master of one of the 12
undergraduate colleges.
"I had it made in the comfortable niche of Old Testament
professor. People said I would be out of my mind to leave and risk the
pressure and demands of being dean of a chapel," Napier recalls.
Yet He Came
Yet he came—because he felt God intended him to be here.
"I have never done work that was more gratifying, or in which the
pressures were more unrelenting," he states.
In addition to sensitivity, kindness and gentleness are the first
words used to describe Dean Napier by those who know him well.
Rejecting the word "out-going" so often applied to him, his
secretaries Ann Vollmer and Charlotte House say he extends kindness
to everyone but is not easy to know through a casual acquaintance.
"He's incredibly soft-hearted," laughs Mrs. Napier, calling him a
terrible disciplinarian for their two children, John, 23, and Anne, 18.
She explains much of his awareness of "where students are at" as
gained through them.
From father to spiritual father, from the with-it, uninhibited dean
to the wild-eyed liberal stirring things up, all Napier's images unite and
are grounded in one credo: "The religious life embraces everything
that a man is."

his parents had only to frown to punish him. Born in 1915 in China of
Southern Baptist missionaries, he was tutored for several years by his
mother and then attended American schools in China.
Planned to Take English
Never intending to be a minister, Napier graduated from a small
Southern college, planning to attend Yale for a Ph.D. in English. But
when his brother urged him to try a year of seminary with him, Davie
agreed.
"I got really excited about the Old Testament and decided to be a
writer, a novelist whose special field was the Old Testament—sort of
historical novelist," he remembers.
Still intending only to write and teach afttt getting out of
seminary, he accepted a teaching job which also involved being
chaplain. This required him to be ordained as a minister, and ever
since he has been alternately or simultaneously a professor, writer and
minister, acquiring along the way the degrees of Ph.D., D.D. and
Litt.D.
Before he came to Stanford, friends at Yale who were aware of his
sensitivity warned him about coming, saying, "There, you're going to
be exposed."
Having taught at Yale for 17 years, Napier had a name
professorship and the prestigious position of master of one of the 12
undergraduate colleges.
"I had it made in the comfortable niche of Old Testament
professor. People said I would be out of my mind to leave and risk the
pressure and demands of being dean of a chapel," Napier recalls.
Yet He Came
Yet he came—because he felt God intended him to be here.
"I have never done work that was more gratifying, or in which the
pressures were more unrelenting," he states.
In addition to sensitivity, kindness and gentleness are the first
words used to describe Dean Napier by those who know him well.
Rejecting the word "out-going" so often applied to him, his
secretaries Ann Vollmer and Charlotte House say he extends kindness
to everyone but is not easy to know through a casual acquaintance.
"He's incredibly soft-hearted," laughs Mrs. Napier, calling him a
terrible disciplinarian for their two children, John, 23, and Anne, 18.
She explains much of his awareness of "where students are at" as
gained through them.
From father to spiritual father, from the with-it, uninhibited dean
to the wild-eyed liberal stirring things up, all Napier's images unite and
are grounded in one credo: "The religious life embraces everything
that a man is."


DEAN B. DAVIE NAPIER—The
man who's brought everything
from Marat de Sade to Joan Baez
to Memorial Church will be taking
a six-month leave starting next
month—to travel, visit and write.
B. Davie Napier, in his fourth
year as Dean of the Chapel, will
take a six-month sabbatical
beginning in January.
He plans to devote his full time
to writing during the first three
months in Puerto Rico followed
by visiting and studying in he
U.S., Europe and the Near East.

The Rev. Wnvne R. Rood,
from Pacific School of nettgion at
Berkeley, will serve as acting dean.
Below, DAILY staffer Anne
Eggebroten paints a warm picture
■)f Napier—his daily routine, his
beliefs, and how others see him.

Riding his bike, pounding out jazz for students crowded around a
piano, flaunting a Bob Hope style of situational humor at the most
ceremonious of occasions—Dean B. Davie Napier has become a
popular figure on campus.
At other times he has broken into his own office by climbing in the
window, played "Somebody to Love" as part of the sermon, mixed
up who was in the ark, and naively set due dates of class papers for
"as soon as possible."
He's "always running, always at least five minutes behind
schedule," admits his assistant Diane Kenney, but it's always because
he stops to talk with anyone who approaches him.
He and his wife Joy run a 24-hour open house just off the row,
with students dropping in at all hours. They invite dormitories and
fraternities over several times per quarter, in addition to such regular
as t.hp Mendicants, the DAILY staff, and the University choir.
Napier himself sees 20 to 30 students per week by appointment for
talking or counseling. With his slim sideburns, appealing grin, and
ready chuckle, he gains easy rapport with students.
Mem Chu Revolutionized
However, Stanford administrators often wish he's cause a little less
trouble for them
Napier has revolutionized use of Memorial Church. Allowing
Moratorium meetings, Joan Baez shows, all-night peace vigils, and
Marat Sade performances (all never heard of in Mem Chu), he has
made it a focal point of the Stanford community.
Before he came to Stanford three years ago, nothing other than
straight Biblican material was read out of the pulpit. Today the "Now
Testament" is heard as well—whether it be taken from Soul on Ice,
Dylan, the Beatles or T.S. Eliot, and whether it concern racism, the
war in Vietnam or the government in Washington.
Not only does he talk, he participates in the movements as well.
This often causes problems for the university administration,
concerned with preserving Stanford's image among conservative
alumni, educators, and the U.S. government.
In fact, irate letters have ol'ten caused Napier himself hours of
painful consideration and explanation, though adverse criticism now
bothers him less than at first.
"I would violate my own integrity as a man called of God if 1 did
not speak out against the obscenity in our society which is counter to
he love of God," the Dean maintains, impassioned on his subject.

"How can you address the love of God to the problems of
existence without speaking to the social and political issues which
concern us? The prophets spoke of God as the Holy One in your
midst. If he's not in your midst, why bother to speak about him at
all?"
Monsters of Social Evil
Napier affirms that not only personal problems but the "monsters
of social evil are vulnerable to Jesus Christ."
Gesturing forcefully with the circular movement of one hand
drawing the words out, Napier burns with intensity from the small
bright eyes behind glasses.
"He has a terrific force that's almost scary; his volatility sometimes
give the impression of his being quick-tempered," says his wife.
Despite images of Napier as a man of force, tremendous
enthusiasm, humor and friendliness, his close friends agree that few
people know him well.
"He's very, very sentitive—basically he's a poet," states Miss
Kenney.
Napier insists on keeping his mornings free, going out each day by
8 a.m. to the cottage in back of his house to write, sometimes even
disconnecting the office phone.
He is a perfectionist, in his writing, from prayers and sermons to the
five books he had published. Most recent is Come Sweet Death, a
book of poems on Old Testament themes.
Critical of his personal appearance as well as his writing, "BDN"
swims an hour each day at the faculty club and skips lunches to stay
near the 160-pound weight with which he feels most comfortable.

Napier has revolutionized use of Memorial Church. Allowing
Moratorium meetings, Joan Baez shows, all-night peace vigils, and
Marat Sade performances (all never heard of in Mem Chu), he has
made it a focal point of the Stanford community.
Before he came to Stanford three years ago, nothing other than
straight Biblican material was read out of the pulpit. Today the "Now
Testament" is heard as well—whether it be taken from Soul on Ice,
Dylan, the Beatles or T.S. Eliot, and whether it concern racism, the
war in Vietnam or the government in Washington.
Not only does he talk, he participates in the movements as well.
This often causes problems for the university administration,
concerned with preserving Stanford's image among conservative
alumni, educators, and the U.S. government.
In fact, irate letters have ol'ten caused Napier himself hours of
painful consideration and explanation, though adverse criticism now
bothers him less than at first.
"I would violate my own integrity as a man called of God if 1 did
not speak out against the obscenity in our society which is counter to
he love of God," the Dean maintains, impassioned on his subject.

"How can you address the love of God to the problems of
existence without speaking to the social and political issues which
concern us? The prophets spoke of God as the Holy One in your
midst. If he's not in your midst, why bother to speak about him at
all?"
Monsters of Social Evil
Napier affirms that not only personal problems but the "monsters
of social evil are vulnerable to Jesus Christ."
Gesturing forcefully with the circular movement of one hand
drawing the words out, Napier burns with intensity from the small
bright eyes behind glasses.
"He has a terrific force that's almost scary; his volatility sometimes
give the impression of his being quick-tempered," says his wife.
Despite images of Napier as a man of force, tremendous
enthusiasm, humor and friendliness, his close friends agree that few
people know him well.
"He's very, very sentitive—basically he's a poet," states Miss
Kenney.
Napier insists on keeping his mornings free, going out each day by
8 a.m. to the cottage in back of his house to write, sometimes even
disconnecting the office phone.
He is a perfectionist, in his writing, from prayers and sermons to the
five books he had published. Most recent is Come Sweet Death, a
book of poems on Old Testament themes.
Critical of his personal appearance as well as his writing, "BDN"
swims an hour each day at the faculty club and skips lunches to stay
near the 160-pound weight with which he feels most comfortable.
Napier admits to being a "very sensitive guy," saying that as a child
his parents had only to frown to punish him. Born in 1915 in China of
Southern Baptist missionaries, he was tutored for several years by his
mother and then attended American schools in China.
Planned to Take English
Never intending to be a minister, Napier graduated from a small
Southern college, planning to attend Yale for a Ph.D. in English. But
when his brother urged him to try a year of seminary with him, Davie
agreed.
"I got really excited about the Old Testament and decided to be a
writer, a novelist whose special field was the Old Testament—sort of
historical novelist," he remembers.
Still intending only to write and teach afttt getting out of
seminary, he accepted a teaching job which also involved being
chaplain. This required him to be ordained as a minister, and ever
since he has been alternately or simultaneously a professor, writer and
minister, acquiring along the way the degrees of Ph.D., D.D. and
Litt.D.
Before he came to Stanford, friends at Yale who were aware of his
sensitivity warned him about coming, saying, "There, you're going to
be exposed."
Having taught at Yale for 17 years, Napier had a name
professorship and the prestigious position of master of one of the 12
undergraduate colleges.
"I had it made in the comfortable niche of Old Testament
professor. People said I would be out of my mind to leave and risk the
pressure and demands of being dean of a chapel," Napier recalls.
Yet He Came
Yet he came—because he felt God intended him to be here.
"I have never done work that was more gratifying, or in which the
pressures were more unrelenting," he states.
In addition to sensitivity, kindness and gentleness are the first
words used to describe Dean Napier by those who know him well.
Rejecting the word "out-going" so often applied to him, his
secretaries Ann Vollmer and Charlotte House say he extends kindness
to everyone but is not easy to know through a casual acquaintance.
"He's incredibly soft-hearted," laughs Mrs. Napier, calling him a
terrible disciplinarian for their two children, John, 23, and Anne, 18.
She explains much of his awareness of "where students are at" as
gained through them.
From father to spiritual father, from the with-it, uninhibited dean
to the wild-eyed liberal stirring things up, all Napier's images unite and
are grounded in one credo: "The religious life embraces everything
that a man is."


DEAN B. DAVIE NAPIER—The
man who's brought everything
from Marat de Sade to Joan Baez
to Memorial Church will be taking
a six-month leave starting next
month—to travel, visit and write.
B. Davie Napier, in his fourth
year as Dean of the Chapel, will
take a six-month sabbatical
beginning in January.
He plans to devote his full time
to writing during the first three
months in Puerto Rico followed
by visiting and studying in he
U.S., Europe and the Near East.

The Rev. Wnvne R. Rood,
from Pacific School of nettgion at
Berkeley, will serve as acting dean.
Below, DAILY staffer Anne
Eggebroten paints a warm picture
■)f Napier—his daily routine, his
beliefs, and how others see him.

Riding his bike, pounding out jazz for students crowded around a
piano, flaunting a Bob Hope style of situational humor at the most
ceremonious of occasions—Dean B. Davie Napier has become a
popular figure on campus.
At other times he has broken into his own office by climbing in the
window, played "Somebody to Love" as part of the sermon, mixed
up who was in the ark, and naively set due dates of class papers for
"as soon as possible."
He's "always running, always at least five minutes behind
schedule," admits his assistant Diane Kenney, but it's always because
he stops to talk with anyone who approaches him.
He and his wife Joy run a 24-hour open house just off the row,
with students dropping in at all hours. They invite dormitories and
fraternities over several times per quarter, in addition to such regular
as t.hp Mendicants, the DAILY staff, and the University choir.
Napier himself sees 20 to 30 students per week by appointment for
talking or counseling. With his slim sideburns, appealing grin, and
ready chuckle, he gains easy rapport with students.
