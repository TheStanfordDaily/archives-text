# 52 Members Named To Local Phi Beta Kappa
## 
### 
The Stanford chapter of Phi
Beta Kappa elected nine members
of the Class of 1969 and 43
members of the Class of 1970 to
membership at a chapter meeting
Nov. 25.

Phi Beta Kappa was founded in
1776, at the College of William
and Mary, in Williamsburg,
Virginia. It was the first society to
iiave a Greek letter name, and in
its initial period at William and
Mary it introduced many of the
essential features of a secret
society: an oath of secrecy, an
elaborate initiation procedure, a
seal, and a special handshake.
Regular meetings were held at
which the chief attraction was
literary exercises, including
debating.
In 1881, there were only 20
active chapters. In that year it was
suggested that a national
organization be formed to give the
societies closer ties. As a result, in
1883 the first National Council of
the United Chapters of Phi Beta
Kappa began its sessions.
In the 84 years since the
oganization of the United
Chapters, the number of chapters
has increased to 184. The
Stanford chapter, Beta of
California, was chartered in 1904.
The newly elected members of
the Stanford Chapter are:
Class of 1969
Allan H. Cadgene, George W.

the United Chapters of Phi Beta

In the 84 years since the

The Stanford chapter of Phi
Beta Kappa elected nine members
of the Class of 1969 and 43
members of the Class of 1970 to
membership at a chapter meeting
Nov. 25.

Phi Beta Kappa was founded in
1776, at the College of William
and Mary, in Williamsburg,
Virginia. It was the first society to
iiave a Greek letter name, and in
its initial period at William and
Mary it introduced many of the
essential features of a secret
society: an oath of secrecy, an
elaborate initiation procedure, a
seal, and a special handshake.
Regular meetings were held at
which the chief attraction was
literary exercises, including
debating.
In 1881, there were only 20
active chapters. In that year it was
suggested that a national
organization be formed to give the
societies closer ties. As a result, in
1883 the first National Council of
the United Chapters of Phi Beta
Kappa began its sessions.
In the 84 years since the
oganization of the United
Chapters, the number of chapters
has increased to 184. The
Stanford chapter, Beta of
California, was chartered in 1904.
