# Heart Patient Dies Saturday
## 
### 
One of Stanford Hospital's 18
heart transplant patients, Elton R.
Wagenveld, 52, of Pleasanton,
died unexpectedly Saturday.
The retired air traffic
controller, who received the new
heart July 16, had been
discharged from the hospital three
weeks ago, but was readmitted
Friday for treatment because his
body was apparently rejecting the
organ.
Wagenveld was the 15th of
Stanford's transplant patients. Six
are still alive.
