# Campus Flicks This Week
## Jolson, Flynn Slated Tuesday 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Michael Curtiz, Franco
Zeffirelli, Federico Fellini,
Jean-Luc Godard and Sam
Peckinpah stand out among this
week's directors, while the faces
of A 1 Jolson, Errol Flynn,
Giulietta Masina and William
Hoi den will occupy campus
screens.
Showing at the experimental
film series on Monday are Lotus
Wing, Penny Bright & Jimmy
Witherspoon, A Unicorn in the
Garden, Solitaire, Turn Turn
Turn, Plastic Bag, Word Movie and
Ursula. In the art auditorium at 9
p.m.
Wonder Bar is a fast,
scatter-brained musical directed in
1934 by Lloyd Bacon with
musical numbers staged by Busby
Berkeley. Romantic
entanglements complicate the
lives of Delores Del Rio, Dick
Powell, Kay Francis, and Ricardo
Cortez, but A 1 Jolson is around to
set things straight.
This Tuesday in Geology 320,
Clive Miller is also showing
Captain Blood, an immensely
entertaining swashbuckler with
Errol Flynn and directed by
Curtiz. Basil Rathbone is once
again Flynn's dueling partner and
Olivia de Havilland once again
patiently waits by while her hero
carries on his fabulous exploits.
Top-notch adventure in the thirties
tradition.
The final feature in Tresidder's
ballet and opera film series is La

Boheme, a film of an actual
performance of Pucini's opera at
La Scala. The production,
designed and directed by Franco
Zeffirelli, will be shown on
Wednesday at 7:30 and 8:30.
The International Association
film in Cubberley at 7:45 on
Thursday will be 317 th Platoon.
Made in 1965 by Pierre
Shoendorffer (who did the
acclaimed Anderson Platoon), this
French documentary records the
lives and military activities of
troops in Cambodia.
When La Strada was shown on
campus last spring, we were
subjected to a dubbed version
which severely dulled the impact
of Fellini's film in general and
specifically imposed upon the fine
performances of Giulietta Masina
and Anthony Quinn. Let's hope
for better luck when it is shown
this Friday in Cubberley.
Weekend represents a giant
step in an indeterminate direction
for Jean-Luc Godard. While it is
among the most hateful of his
films, it is also the most
fascinating; while it is grievously
flawed as a solitary work of art, it
also has extraordinary intellectual
depth. Everything in the film is
reality accentuated by one degree;
while guns are prevolent in
today's society, everyone doesn't
use them, and while revolution is
widely discussed, it doesn't touch
most people's lives. Whether
Weekend is Godard's vision of
today, tomorrow or Hell is a
substantial, if unsolvable, subject

for argument, By any standards,
the film is a virtuoso work of art
which must be seen. Only then
can it be embraced, rejected or, as
must be done, considered and
discussed. The film will be shown
on both Friday and Saturday
nights at Tresidder.
A special program ailed Film
REvolution '70 will be presented
in Cubberley on Saturday at 7 and
9 p.m. This is a collection of ten
short films which represents the
best student productions made at
UCLA over the past two years. As
UCLA has one of the three best
film schools in the country,
expectations should run high.
Included is a short directed by the
now-famous Francis Ford
Coppola, whose master thesis at
the school was You're a Big Boy
Now.
Sam Peckinpah's blood ballet
The Wild Bunch is this week's
Sunday Flick. An already exciting
picture, it should be fun to see
how much our audience juices it
up. This time 'round, take note of
the faculous supporting
characterizations, notably by Ben
Johnson, L.Q. Jones, and the
incomparable Strother Martin.

The Wild Bunch is this week's
Sunday Flick. An already exciting
picture, it should be fun to see
how much our audience juices it
up. This time 'round, take note of
the faculous supporting
characterizations, notably by Ben
Johnson, L.Q. Jones, and the
incomparable Strother Martin.
Michael Curtiz, Franco
Zeffirelli, Federico Fellini,
Jean-Luc Godard and Sam
Peckinpah stand out among this
week's directors, while the faces
of A 1 Jolson, Errol Flynn,
Giulietta Masina and William
Hoi den will occupy campus
screens.
Showing at the experimental
film series on Monday are Lotus
Wing, Penny Bright & Jimmy
Witherspoon, A Unicorn in the
Garden, Solitaire, Turn Turn
Turn, Plastic Bag, Word Movie and
Ursula. In the art auditorium at 9
p.m.
Wonder Bar is a fast,
scatter-brained musical directed in
1934 by Lloyd Bacon with
musical numbers staged by Busby
Berkeley. Romantic
entanglements complicate the
lives of Delores Del Rio, Dick
Powell, Kay Francis, and Ricardo
Cortez, but A 1 Jolson is around to
set things straight.
This Tuesday in Geology 320,
Clive Miller is also showing
Captain Blood, an immensely
entertaining swashbuckler with
Errol Flynn and directed by
Curtiz. Basil Rathbone is once
again Flynn's dueling partner and
Olivia de Havilland once again
patiently waits by while her hero
carries on his fabulous exploits.
Top-notch adventure in the thirties
tradition.
The final feature in Tresidder's
ballet and opera film series is La

Boheme, a film of an actual
performance of Pucini's opera at
La Scala. The production,
designed and directed by Franco
Zeffirelli, will be shown on
Wednesday at 7:30 and 8:30.
The International Association
film in Cubberley at 7:45 on
Thursday will be 317 th Platoon.
Made in 1965 by Pierre
Shoendorffer (who did the
acclaimed Anderson Platoon), this
French documentary records the
lives and military activities of
troops in Cambodia.
When La Strada was shown on
campus last spring, we were
subjected to a dubbed version
which severely dulled the impact
of Fellini's film in general and
specifically imposed upon the fine
performances of Giulietta Masina
and Anthony Quinn. Let's hope
for better luck when it is shown
this Friday in Cubberley.
Weekend represents a giant
step in an indeterminate direction
for Jean-Luc Godard. While it is
among the most hateful of his
films, it is also the most
fascinating; while it is grievously
flawed as a solitary work of art, it
also has extraordinary intellectual
depth. Everything in the film is
reality accentuated by one degree;
while guns are prevolent in
today's society, everyone doesn't
use them, and while revolution is
widely discussed, it doesn't touch
most people's lives. Whether
Weekend is Godard's vision of
today, tomorrow or Hell is a
substantial, if unsolvable, subject

for argument, By any standards,
the film is a virtuoso work of art
which must be seen. Only then
can it be embraced, rejected or, as
must be done, considered and
discussed. The film will be shown
on both Friday and Saturday
nights at Tresidder.
A special program ailed Film
REvolution '70 will be presented
in Cubberley on Saturday at 7 and
9 p.m. This is a collection of ten
short films which represents the
best student productions made at
UCLA over the past two years. As
UCLA has one of the three best
film schools in the country,
expectations should run high.
Included is a short directed by the
now-famous Francis Ford
Coppola, whose master thesis at
the school was You're a Big Boy
Now.
