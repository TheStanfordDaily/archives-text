# Psychosis Linked To Faulty Dreams
## 
### JOHN TILLMAN 
Psychosis may result from a
breakdown of the dream
suppression mechanism suggested
Dr. William C. Dement, head
of the Sleep Research Center at
Stanford, who spoke last week on
the nature of sleep and dreams.
In researching the origin of
dreams in the absence of external
stimuli, Dr. Dement observed that
at times the brain emits a
spontaneous output consisting of
indiscriminant images. This
situation is suggestive of
hallucinatory mental illness.
There are basically two kinds
of sleep: REM (rapid eye

movement) or deep sleep, and
non-REM sleep. Dreams occur
during REM sleep, which is
characterized by more rhythmic
and slower moving brain waves.
REM, which has four stages,
comprises 25 percent of sleep
time. During one phase of the
cycle, a polygraph records a
spontaneous, one-second,
spindle-shaped burst of 14 cycles
per second. This phenomenon is
common to most mammals,
including people, cats, guinea pigs
and elephants.
Cat and Man Similar
There is no salient
physiological difference between

the REM activity of the cat, Dr.
Demerit's main laboratory animal,
and that of a man, although it is
hard to say that the cat really
dreams.
The periods of REM are more
frequent in cats, but are shorter in
duration that among humans,
whose last about 20 minutes. The
brain is awake during this time,
but its spinal motor nuerons
inhibit its own output.
When records were made of the
output of a cat's 'pons,' a
primitive visual way station in the
brain, it was discovered that
sudden, sharp spikes occurred on
the graph. On this basis, it is
believed that dreams are projected
in the pons. 1
Dr. Dement noted that it is '
fortunate these spikes occur as 1
dreams only at night, and that ,
there is a mechanism which
suppresses dreams during waking
hours. Further, there is evidence
that in psychotic states, this
mechanism is not regulated, and is
either too easily activated, or not
turned off.
Hungry and Oversexed
Dr. Dement applied pressure to
cats by withholding REM sleep.
This pressure did not cause
"dream eruption" in the waking
state, but the cats subsequently
spent a greater proportion of their
sleep in REM. REM-deprived cats
also ate more ravenously, were
more aggressive and became
oversexed.
Next, the experimenters
replaced REM-deprivation with
treatments of he drug PCPA,
which thwarts the synthesis of
serotonin, the dream suppressant
chemical. This caused REM spikes
to appear on the polygraph of a
waking cat. Also, the animal
responded to an image as if it
were externally stimulated.
If schizophrenic humans are
deprived of REM, they will not
compensate by spending more
time in REM on following nights.
However, if the same patients
later recover from their illness,
they do make up for lost deep
sleep.
In addition, if a remissed
subject is deprived of his REM, he
shows an even greater tendency to
compensate than a normal
individual.
These observations hint that
serotonin controls dreaming, and
that serotonin nuerons must be
responsible for vital functions
such as eating, sex, aggression and
fleeing. It is well established, Dr.
Dement feels, that PCPA
treatment creates a psychotic
condition in cats, but whether the
same is true of humans is
undeterminable.
LSD Aberration
LSD puts the serotonin
nuerons out of order, but the LSD
experience is different from
regular schizophrenia, which often
has been developing since infancy.

REM deprivation causes
greater use of serotonin, upsetting
the metabolic system, and
creating overcompensation.
Normal serotonin synthesis is a
compromise between
environmental stimuli and the
biological necessity to sleep.
A corollary development may
be the use of drugs to alter the
need to sleep. Extreme
deprivation of REM leads to the
patient's experiencing a series of
"micro-sleeps," which could
become our sleep habit in the
future. However, the biological
system of evolution is based on
optimum functioning, and

upsetting it may have dire
consequences.
Sleep is ultimate control of
bodily tendencies, and not to
sleep is incompatible with the way
the mind functions. The adaptive
function of sleep is to conserve
calories. REM sleep allows the
system to be active while the
brain sleeps. Dr. Dement develops
these ideas further in
"Schizophrenia," which deals
with the relentless quality of
dreaming which does not allow
reflection or reason.
In passing, Dr. Dement quoted
from Havelock Ellis that, "Dreams
are real while they lastâ€”can we
say more of life?"
