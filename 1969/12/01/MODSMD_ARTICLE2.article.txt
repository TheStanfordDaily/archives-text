# Lottery Drawing Scheduled Today
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The DAILY
plans to carry the complete listing
of the order of birthday
selections, which will determine
relative draft status next year, in
tomorrow's edition.)
The nation's youth will learn
tonight with a fair degree of
certainty whether or not they will
be drafted during the coming year
as the first military conscription
lottery since 1942 will be held
starting at 5 p.m., PST.
The drawing, which is slated
for the Selective Service System's
offices in Washington, D.C., is the
result of the military conscription
Executive Order signed by
President Nixon last Tuesday.
Some 56 young men and women
will draw the 392 capsules, one
for each day in the year and each
letter in the alphabet, from a large
glass bowl in a process that
Selective Service estimates will
take about two hours.
Current plans call for the
drafting of 260,000 men next
year, some 46 percent of those
eligible for conscription. In
addition, the White House
estimates that 290,000 men will
volunteer for service next year.
First 230 Critical
For most, the suspense of the
evening and the year will end
within the first hour of the
lottery, for the Selective Service
expects that it will need, at most,
the first 230 slips drawn to
provide the 260,000 men
necessary to meet its needs.
The remaining eligible men will
be called only in case of a
radically revised draft call. Thus,
if the individual's birthday is on

one of the first 150 slips drawn,
and he is not exempt, he can be
relatively sure tha he will be called
for his physical and eventual
induction within the year.
Those whose numbers are the
first to be selected will be the first
to be drafted. In cases where there
are two men at a local draft borad
with the same birthdate, the one
whose last name begins with the
letter that is pulled out of the
fishbowl first will be called before
the other man.
Larger Manpower Pool
For 1970, the draft will
encompass all those without
exemptions in the 19-26 age
bracket without regard to the
individual's age. After that, those
who are the youngest, 19, will be
the first to be called, followed by
those who have just lost their
exemptions.
Thus the manpower pool will
be larger next year than it will be
in the following years. There will
be a new lottery every year; if
deferred, one keeps the number
that he was assigned originally
when he was in the "age 19"
bracket.
The last time a lottery was
used was when the United States
entered the Second World War.
Up until the beginning of the war,
there were 10,000 numbers, not
366. The principle was the same,
however: those whose numbers
were picked first were the first to
be drafted. The lottery was
discontinued in 1942 as the U.S.
completed full mobilization and
there was no need for such a
system—every eligible man was
drafted.

there were 10,000 numbers, not
366. The principle was the same,
however: those whose numbers
were picked first were the first to
be drafted. The lottery was
discontinued in 1942 as the U.S.
completed full mobilization and
there was no need for such a
system—every eligible man was
drafted.
(Editor's note: The DAILY
plans to carry the complete listing
of the order of birthday
selections, which will determine
relative draft status next year, in
tomorrow's edition.)
The nation's youth will learn
tonight with a fair degree of
certainty whether or not they will
be drafted during the coming year
as the first military conscription
lottery since 1942 will be held
starting at 5 p.m., PST.
The drawing, which is slated
for the Selective Service System's
offices in Washington, D.C., is the
result of the military conscription
Executive Order signed by
President Nixon last Tuesday.
Some 56 young men and women
will draw the 392 capsules, one
for each day in the year and each
letter in the alphabet, from a large
glass bowl in a process that
Selective Service estimates will
take about two hours.
Current plans call for the
drafting of 260,000 men next
year, some 46 percent of those
eligible for conscription. In
addition, the White House
estimates that 290,000 men will
volunteer for service next year.
First 230 Critical
For most, the suspense of the
evening and the year will end
within the first hour of the
lottery, for the Selective Service
expects that it will need, at most,
the first 230 slips drawn to
provide the 260,000 men
necessary to meet its needs.
The remaining eligible men will
be called only in case of a
radically revised draft call. Thus,
if the individual's birthday is on

one of the first 150 slips drawn,
and he is not exempt, he can be
relatively sure tha he will be called
for his physical and eventual
induction within the year.
Those whose numbers are the
first to be selected will be the first
to be drafted. In cases where there
are two men at a local draft borad
with the same birthdate, the one
whose last name begins with the
letter that is pulled out of the
fishbowl first will be called before
the other man.
Larger Manpower Pool
For 1970, the draft will
encompass all those without
exemptions in the 19-26 age
bracket without regard to the
individual's age. After that, those
who are the youngest, 19, will be
the first to be called, followed by
those who have just lost their
exemptions.
Thus the manpower pool will
be larger next year than it will be
in the following years. There will
be a new lottery every year; if
deferred, one keeps the number
that he was assigned originally
when he was in the "age 19"
bracket.
The last time a lottery was
used was when the United States
entered the Second World War.
Up until the beginning of the war,
there were 10,000 numbers, not
366. The principle was the same,
however: those whose numbers
were picked first were the first to
be drafted. The lottery was
discontinued in 1942 as the U.S.
