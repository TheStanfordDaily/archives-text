Charged with assault and
battery counts against a Palo Alto
Times photographer covering the
incident, are John Shoch, a junior

and his wife, Jan, who are not
students.
The trio are among over 100
protestors, mainly Stanford
students, who were arrested inthe
wake of the SRI demonstrations,
which caused an
officially-estimated damage of
$10,000.

Institute and the announced plan
to sell the nonprofit organization.

the first three defendants, Jeanne
Friedman, political science
instructor at Redlands University;
Myron Filene, freshman sponsor
at Stanford; and John Anthony
Scott. The first two have said they
will appeal the convictions.
Judge John Brenner will hear
the case.
