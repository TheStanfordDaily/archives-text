## Magical Mystery Teams Looking For Sanskrit Buttons 
### 
KZSU station manager Jeffrey
sEustis denied Friday that the four
[letter configurations appearing on
■ buttons distributed by his
have obscene
He attributed
'confusion over the meaning of the
■ message to the unfortunate
coincidence that all Federal
Communication Commission call
letters, including KZSU's contain
four characters. While reiterating
that the gold and black buttons
contain nothing but KZSU
written in Sanskrit, Eustis stated
that students are not discouraged
from explaining their contents as
imaginatively as they desire.
The Sanskrit buttons, along
with a few English-language
counterparts, are part of KZSU's
Mystery man contest.
Today, 400 buttons attached to
*45 records will be randomly
112 distributed throughout university
> residences. In addition, boxes of
KZSU buttons will be placed in

dormitory lobbies and lounges,
and at KZSU's studios in the
basement of Mem Aud.
Starting tomorrow, unusually
garbed KZSU Magical Mystery
teams will circulate through a
different part of the campus each
day, searching for students
wearing the hand-painted buttons,
All those they find will be
awarded either an LP or a six-pack
of singles.
The records are all recent
releases, obtained by KZSU from
Columbia, Elektra, and other
major labels for promotional
purposes. Over 1700 records will
be given away during the
two-week contest.
Eustis stated that the purpose
of the buttons, prizes, and Magical
Mystery teams is to stimulate
interest in KZSU. The
underground-styled student
station broadcasts at 90.1 fm
throughout the Stanford area and
at 880 am in university residences.
