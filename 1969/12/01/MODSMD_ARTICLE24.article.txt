# Skaters Find League Tough
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
Fuller Torrey is a 32-year-old resident psychiatrist at the Stanford
Hospital â€”which may be something to write home about but hardly
seems worthy of mention in the public prints. Except for the fact that
Torrey, unlike most of his colleagues, likes to play ice hockey.
Not only that, Torrey likes to play hockey so much that he has
taken it upon himself to search out other habitues of the sport in the
Stanford community and to organize them into a team. He did that
last winter. Then, realizing that it wouldn't be too long before his
newly-organized squad tired of scrimmaging with itself, Torrey went
out and organized a league.
Now, the four-team Bay Area Hockey League functions on a
regular basis with teams from Berkeley, San Francisco, Belmont and
Stanford. Torrey, who is head coach and founder of the Stanford
team, is also President of the League.
He's also possibly the best player on the Indian squad. Last
Tuesday night, as Stanford dropped an 8-5 decision to the Belmont
Oaks, Torrey scored four goals and assisted on the other. But if his
own predictions about the league hold true, Torrey will be scoring
more often in a losing cause this season than otherwise. Right now
Stanford's record is 1-6.
After getting a team together last winter, Torrey scheduled eight
games for his squad with three other loosely organized teams. By
March Stanford had won three games and lost five and the
groundwork for the new league had been set. But then, says Torrey,
the other teams became more serious about the whole venture and
started putting together lineups with some relatively high-class talent.

The Indians' ability, however, remained more or less static, simply
because Stanford couldn't go far afield looking for players. The result
is that the Tribe, although improved over last season, finds itself on he
short end of what Torrey terms "a damn good league." And he says,
"We'll continue to lose a lot of games."
No Lack of Desire
!
But these developments have only slightly dimmed the enthusiasm
of Torrey's team for action, as was clearly evident last Tuesday.
Playing against perhaps the best team in he league the red-shirted
Indians were outscored, outshot and occasionally outskated, but
rarely outhustled.
Torrey put Stanford on the board first with a goal at 4:28 of the
first period. Defenseman Doug Adams carried the puck over the blue
line then passed to Don Mitchell who released to Torrey for the goal.
But Belmont came back with two quick goals, the second by former
Western Hockey Leaguer Lome Nadeau, to take a 2-1 lead. And a
20-foot score at 17:28 by the Oaks' Harding Dawe gave them a 3-1
lead at the intermission.
Flip Gianos, a sophomore from Minneapolis, and Adams assisted
on Torrey's second goal early in the second period to put the Indians
within one of the lead. Then at 4:08, with both teams a man down an
unassisted drive from just inside the blue line went in and Torrey had
a three-goal Hat Trick to tie the score.
That's the way the period ended as Stanford shut out the
opposition for 20 minutes for the first time this season. The trick was
accomplished by a hairy melange of goal-mouth scrambling and
occasionally sensational goal-tending by Gary Aitken, an Engineering
grad student who played at the University of Toronto. Aitken finished
with 39 saves on the night (after making an incredible 67 the week
before) and may well be the best goalie in the league.
Taking assists from Pat Baldwin and Torrey, Ed Leonard scored at
3:21 of the third period to give Stanford a short-lived 4-3 lead.
Nadeau tallied at 8:42 and 8:58 and suddenly the Indians were
behind. Unrelenting, Torrey converted a Mitchell pass at 10:35 from
an impossible angle on he left side to tie the score once more, but
Nadeau's fourth score, from a left side angle at 15:13 and another
Belmont goal, by Joe Palladino at 16:05, put the game on ice.
Palladino, at 46, is the oldest player in the league and has years of
semi-pro experience.
A Belmont goal by Willie Wahlio from the left point at 18:45
ended the scoring for the evening. The Indians had been outshot 21-2

in he final period and only the fine play by goaltender Aitken had
kept the contest from becoming a rout.
Fans Have a Cool Time
Nevertheless it had been a well played contest and until the waning
minutes of the final period the outcome had been in doubt. And it
evidently satisfied the majority of the nearly 50 non-paying fans who
shivered through the whole game in an arena which looks and feels
more like a deserted quonset hut in the nether regions of Greenland
than a hockey stadium.
Of course, a major draw might well have been the opportunity to
see such sagacious old-pro types as Nadeau and Palladino (not to
mention an aging vet from the American Hockey League named Andy
Panagafko who can't play Tuesday nights) skate circles around
younger members of the opposition and use every bit of their
considerable chicanery to outwit the refs.
Stanford has two more games before Christmas; tonight and a week
from tonight at 8 in Leggs Ice Arena in San Francisco. By the time the
season resumes in January the Indians should have regained the
fulltime services of Tom Generous, a history TA who s been out
taking a puck on he instep a few weeks ago, and Paul Tittmann, a
freshman who has missed most of the season so far due to a Tuesday
night conflict.
Meanwhile, the team continues to hold practice sessions every
Sunday night, which Torrey emphasizes are open to any member of
the community who wants to play hockey. The team plays with
Stanford's name as a club sport and with a subsidy. Last season
Torrey obtained Athletic Department funds for uniforms and this
year Torrey and club President Bob Kodlec are negotiating for
ice-time subsidies. Every participating player, however, buys a good
deal of his own equipment and aids in ice and transportation costs.
Over half of the team's expenses to date have been paid by members.
And why does psychiatrist Torrey do all this? "I just like to play
hockey," he says,"I always have. I was brought jip on the sport.
Besides] my wife says it makes me easier to live with."


WORLD'S FASTEST SPORT: Or so it seemed to our photographer
who had trouble keeping Stanford skater Flip Gianos in focus as he
zipped by. Indians play in San Francisco tonight.
