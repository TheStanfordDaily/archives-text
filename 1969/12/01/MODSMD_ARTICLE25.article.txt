# Plunkett Unanimous
## Five Indians on Pac-8 Team 
### 
Conference champion USC and
co-runner-up UCLA each placed
six players on the 1969
AU-Pacific-8 Football Team,
selected by the eight league
coaches and released yesterday
by Executive Director Thomas J.
Hamilton.
Stanford, co-runner-up in the
Conference race with UCLA, put
five players on the first ream
offense and defensive lineup.
There were four repeaters and
three unanimous choices on the
23-man squad, which included
four defensive backs due to a
deadlock in voting at that
position.
The eight coaches all placed
USC offensive tackle Sid Smith,
Stanford quarterback Jim
Plunkett and USC defensive end
Jimmy Gunn on their ballots. The
repeaters from the 1968
All-Conference team were Smith
at offensive tackle, USC teammate
Fred Khasigian at offensive guard,
Gunn at defensive end and
Stanford's Don Parish at
linebacker.
Records Tumble
Meanwhile, the 53-year-old
Pacific-8 Conference football
record book, including all the
figures from the Pacific Coast

Conference, took a sound
trouncing during the 1969
football season.
A total of 25 single game,
season and career records were
either broken or tied in college
football's 100 th anniversary
season. It proved to be the
greatest bombardment in history
on the record book by Pacific-8
teams.
Stanford's junior quarterback
Jim Plunkett set eight new
individual records to lead the waj
as 16 season records went by the
wayside and two were tied, two
career records were shattered, and
three single game marks bit the
dust in addition to two being tied.

Conference champion USC and
co-runner-up UCLA each placed
six players on the 1969
AU-Pacific-8 Football Team,
selected by the eight league
coaches and released yesterday
by Executive Director Thomas J.
Hamilton.
Stanford, co-runner-up in the
Conference race with UCLA, put
five players on the first ream
offense and defensive lineup.
There were four repeaters and
three unanimous choices on the
23-man squad, which included
four defensive backs due to a
deadlock in voting at that
position.
The eight coaches all placed
USC offensive tackle Sid Smith,
Stanford quarterback Jim
Plunkett and USC defensive end
Jimmy Gunn on their ballots. The
repeaters from the 1968
All-Conference team were Smith
at offensive tackle, USC teammate
Fred Khasigian at offensive guard,
Gunn at defensive end and
Stanford's Don Parish at
linebacker.
Records Tumble
Meanwhile, the 53-year-old
Pacific-8 Conference football
record book, including all the
figures from the Pacific Coast

Conference, took a sound
trouncing during the 1969
football season.
A total of 25 single game,
season and career records were
either broken or tied in college
football's 100 th anniversary
season. It proved to be the
greatest bombardment in history
on the record book by Pacific-8
teams.
Stanford's junior quarterback
Jim Plunkett set eight new
individual records to lead the waj
as 16 season records went by the
wayside and two were tied, two
career records were shattered, and
three single game marks bit the
dust in addition to two being tied.
