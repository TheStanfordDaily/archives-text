# Indians Clash With Redskins
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's varsity basketball
team opens its 1969-70 season
tonight when they take on the
Utah Redskins in Salt Lake City.
The game will be the first
collegiate contest ever played in
the Ute's new 15,000 seat arena.
Utah, ranked 19th in the
nation in Sports Illustrated's
preseason poll, will be decided
favorites over the Indians.
The Redskins are led by 6-4
junior forward Kenny Gardner
who has recovered from a
preseason knee injury and who is
expected to be in the starting
lineup tonight. Gardner is a
complete player who, despite his
size, led the WAC in rebounding
up until the final two weeks of
the season. At the other corner
spot is 6-3 Walt Hawkins, who like
Gardner is a great jumper.

The Redskin guards are led by
WAC Player of the Year, Mike
Newlin who led the league with a
24 point scoring average. Bob
Martin, the other guard, is an
outstanding playmaker.
At center, the Utes will use
Sandy Mahler, a brawny 6-10
junior who did a fine job last year
for the Redskins.
The Redskins do have some
depth problems, especially at the
guards, and if Gardner's knee gives
out, they could be in trouble.
Tonight Stanford will go with
Bill Barber (6-4) and Fred Green
(6-4) at the forwards; Dennis
O'Neill (6-2V 2 ) and Claude Terry
(6-5) at the guards; and Bill
Palmer (6-7) at center.
Barber and Green were both
reserves last year, but they both
have improved significantly.
Barber, a fine jumper has
overcome hhis problems with
inconsistency that bothered him
last year. Green is the most
aggressive player on the team, and
Coach Howie Dallmar calls him "a
wild bull in a China shop."
O'Neill shot 54% from the
floor last year and he will be
expected to lead the Indian
offense. Terry broke the frosh
scoring record last year and is an
outstanding shooter.
Palmer is a two year veteran
who has constantly been
handicapped by his size. Despite
this problem, Bill still averaged
8.9 points a game and led the
team in rebounding. Backing
Palmer up is 6-10 junior Larry
Rosenzweig who is expected to
see a lot of action. Rosenzweig,
although inexperienced, has
shown a fine shooting touch and
good rebounding strength.
Other people expected to see
action against the Utes will be
Chuck Moore, Mike Michel and
Greg Osborn. Moore (6-4) has
been slowed by injuries, but he
could be outstanding if he can
regain his form of two years ago.
Michel (6-6) was a starter last
season, who has also been slowed
by injuries. Osborn (6-0) is an
experienced senior guard who is a
fine ballhandler and good
playmaker.
The Indians are in an
inenviable position having to open
up a new pavilion against a fine,
explosive team. Luckily the Cards
are not at a great size disadvantage
against Utah and this may give
them a good chance. Stanford has
a fine collection of shooters and a
balanced offensive attack.
Tonight's game will be a good
indication of how the Indians will
fare in their extremely tough
conference the rest of the year.

Tonight Stanford will go with
Bill Barber (6-4) and Fred Green
(6-4) at the forwards; Dennis
O'Neill (6-2V 2 ) and Claude Terry
(6-5) at the guards; and Bill
Palmer (6-7) at center.
Barber and Green were both
reserves last year, but they both
have improved significantly.
Barber, a fine jumper has
overcome hhis problems with
inconsistency that bothered him
last year. Green is the most
aggressive player on the team, and
Coach Howie Dallmar calls him "a
wild bull in a China shop."
O'Neill shot 54% from the
floor last year and he will be
expected to lead the Indian
offense. Terry broke the frosh
scoring record last year and is an
outstanding shooter.
Palmer is a two year veteran
who has constantly been
handicapped by his size. Despite
this problem, Bill still averaged
8.9 points a game and led the
team in rebounding. Backing
Palmer up is 6-10 junior Larry
Rosenzweig who is expected to
see a lot of action. Rosenzweig,
although inexperienced, has
shown a fine shooting touch and
good rebounding strength.
Other people expected to see
action against the Utes will be
Chuck Moore, Mike Michel and
Greg Osborn. Moore (6-4) has
been slowed by injuries, but he
could be outstanding if he can
regain his form of two years ago.
Michel (6-6) was a starter last
season, who has also been slowed
by injuries. Osborn (6-0) is an
experienced senior guard who is a
fine ballhandler and good
playmaker.
The Indians are in an
inenviable position having to open
up a new pavilion against a fine,
explosive team. Luckily the Cards
are not at a great size disadvantage
against Utah and this may give
them a good chance. Stanford has
a fine collection of shooters and a
balanced offensive attack.
Tonight's game will be a good
indication of how the Indians will
fare in their extremely tough
conference the rest of the year.
Stanford's varsity basketball
team opens its 1969-70 season
tonight when they take on the
Utah Redskins in Salt Lake City.
The game will be the first
collegiate contest ever played in
the Ute's new 15,000 seat arena.
Utah, ranked 19th in the
nation in Sports Illustrated's
preseason poll, will be decided
favorites over the Indians.
The Redskins are led by 6-4
junior forward Kenny Gardner
who has recovered from a
preseason knee injury and who is
expected to be in the starting
lineup tonight. Gardner is a
complete player who, despite his
size, led the WAC in rebounding
up until the final two weeks of
the season. At the other corner
spot is 6-3 Walt Hawkins, who like
Gardner is a great jumper.

The Redskin guards are led by
WAC Player of the Year, Mike
Newlin who led the league with a
24 point scoring average. Bob
Martin, the other guard, is an
outstanding playmaker.
At center, the Utes will use
Sandy Mahler, a brawny 6-10
junior who did a fine job last year
for the Redskins.
The Redskins do have some
depth problems, especially at the
guards, and if Gardner's knee gives
out, they could be in trouble.
