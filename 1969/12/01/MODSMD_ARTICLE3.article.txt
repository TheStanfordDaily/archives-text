## 'It Was Point-Blank Murder' 
### 
NEW YORK (AP)—"Life"
Magazine printed Sunday eight
color photographs of death in the
Vietnamese hamlet of My Lai and
quoted Sgt. Michael A. Bernhardt,
who was there, as saying "it was
point-blank murder."
Bernhardt, 23, "Life" wrote,
said that "only a few of us" refused
to take part. "I just told them the
hell with this, I'm not doing it. I
didn't think this was a lawful
order."
Bernhardt, from Hempstead,
N.Y., is now stationed at Ft. Dix,
N.J. On Nov. 18 he became one of
the first eyewitnesses to My Lai to
speak publicly.
He said then he had seen
American soldiers slay hundreds
of civilians at My Lai on March
16, 1968. Published figures of the
dead have ranged upwards to 567.
Spec. 5 John Kinch, who still is
on active duty in Vietnam, said in
the "Life" article that Capt.
Ernest L. Medina reported to his
superiors from the scene, "I have
a body count of 310."
While no charges have been
placed against Medina, attorney F.
Lee Bailey said Sunday he has
entered the case in the captain's
behalf. Bailey declined to call
Medina his client, for technical
reasons, but affirmed that he was
acting for the captain.
Medina, a native of Springer,
N.M., was the commander of
Company C, First Battalion, 20th
Infantry, 11th Light Infantry
Brigade, which razed My Lai.
Some of the men in the platoon
have said he ordered the sweep.
The leader of his first platoon,
Lt. William L. Calley Jr., has been
charged by the Army with the
premeditated murder of 109
civilians there and with another
count of murder in the death of a
civilian in more than a month
earlier.
Sgt. Charles West, now a
mechanic in Chicago, said in

"Life," "Capt. Medina didn't give
an order to go in and kill women
or children. Nobody told us about
handling civilians because at the
time I don't think any of us were
aware of the fact that we'd run
into civilians."
Bailey told The Associated
Press Sunday he was investigating
the matter on Medina's behalf
especially in the light of
statements made by Gl's who
were at My Lai.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—lndians
occupying Alcatraz Island barred
palefaces Sunday, declared an
"Indian Day" of relaxation and
welcomed braves and squaws from
across the nation to their swelling
population.
The Indians laid claim to
Alcatraz 10 days ago under an
1868 treaty that returned unused
federal land to the Sious. They
plan to turn the abandoned
federal prison into a native
American cultural center.
"This is strictly an Indian
day," declared Ross Harden, 30, a
Winnebago Indian from Nebraska
and student at San Francisco
State College, as his companions
stopped all non-Indians, including
newsmen, at a docking area.
This left four caretakers as the
only white men on the island.
Said Harden: "We want to give
everybody a chance to relax
instead of having to hassle with
the press."
Bill Neal, 21, a Urok
Tribesman from Eureka, Calif.,
said 350 Indians stayed on the
island Saturday night, but others
put the figure at more than 600.
New arrivals included Indian
men and women from Oklahoma,
New Mexico, Alaska, New York
and towns around California.
They included a plumber and
an electrician, who began an

inspection of the island's
plumbing and electrical system.
An electrical generator was
hooked up, Harden said.
The day of rest was marred
somewhat when a 7-year-old girl,
Estelle Conway of San Francisco,
caught her leg between a dock and
a moored barge. She was
evacuated by a Coast Guard
launch and sent home after x-rays
showed no fractures.
Earlier Saturday, the Army
Corps of Engineers pumped
1,50,000 gallons of fresh water
from a barge onto the island,
which has no fresh water supply
of its own.
Richard Oakes, a 27-year-old
Mohawk and chief spokesman for
the Indians, called the water
delivery "another battle we have
won." But the Army termed it
routine.
A call for a "Great Pow-wow"
brought many of the new Indians
to the island for a six-hour
celebration Saturday night.
Harden said there was lots of
singing, dancing and eating.
The Indians want an audience
with Interior Secretary Walter
Hickel, who is in a Washington
hospital with a pinched nerve in
his neck. He has said he will talk
with the Indians but not on
prearranged terms.
Oakes said the Indians insist
that Hickel come to Alcatraz in
person. He added, smiling: "I just
wonder if that nerve happens to
bo his Indian nerve."
Kail Strike?
WASHINGTON ( AP)-Secretary
of Labor George W. Shultz
ordered Sunday night
around-the-clock talks starting
Monday between representatives
of the nation's railroads and four
shopcraft unions threatening to
strike by mid-week.

Talks recessed Sunday night
with cautious optimism expressed
by Shultz and by W.J. Usery Jr.,
assistant secretary of labor, that
agreement could be reached
before the strike deadline.
Shultz's order followed an
announcement by the railroads
that should the threatened strike
occur they "will have no
alternative but to discontinue
service throughout the country."
Shultz also ordered
negotiations moved to the Labor
Building from the office of
management's National Railway
Labor Conference.
The strike could come at 12:01
a.m. Wednesday, when President
Nixon's 60-day no-strike order,
obtained under the Railway Labor
Act, expires.
"If a voluntary agreement is
not reached by the deadline other
actions will have to be considered
by the administration," Shultz
said.
Usery said: "I am optimistic
that settlement can be reached.
Both parties have been
cooperating. Proposals have been
exchanged. Some progress has
been made. I believe both
earnestly desire to reach an
agreement."
The four unions represent
railroad machinists, sheet metal
workers, electricians and
boilermakers who maintain rolling
stock and equipment.
''The railroad industry
fervently hopes to avoid a
shutdown which would bring
inconvenience and hardship to the
American people," said John P.
Hiltz Jr., chairman of the National
Railway Labor Conference.
Poverty
WASHINGTON (AP) Official
government definitions of
poverty-income levels for families

have been raised from $200 to as
much as $1,800 on an annual
basis, the Labor Department
announced Sunday.
The new guidelines, which are
effective immediately, are used by
the Labor Department and the
Office of Economic Opportunity
in determining families' eligibility
for federal assistance in various
manpower programs for the
unemployed or unsuitably
employed.
The basic figure for an urban
family of four—the most
frequently used example—was
raised from $3,300 to $3,600. For
a similar rural family it was raused
from $2,300 to $3,000.
A figure of $8,400 was
established as the poverty level for
an urban family of 12, up from
$7,400. For a similar rural family
the change was from $5,200 to
$7,000.
For a single person at the
urban level the minimum was
boosted from $1,600 to $1,800
and at the rural level from $1,100
to $1,500.

Magazine printed Sunday eight
color photographs of death in the
Vietnamese hamlet of My Lai and
quoted Sgt. Michael A. Bernhardt,
who was there, as saying "it was
point-blank murder."
Bernhardt, 23, "Life" wrote,
said that "only a few of us" refused
to take part. "I just told them the
hell with this, I'm not doing it. I
didn't think this was a lawful
order."
Bernhardt, from Hempstead,
N.Y., is now stationed at Ft. Dix,
N.J. On Nov. 18 he became one of
the first eyewitnesses to My Lai to
speak publicly.
He said then he had seen
American soldiers slay hundreds
of civilians at My Lai on March
16, 1968. Published figures of the
dead have ranged upwards to 567.
Spec. 5 John Kinch, who still is
on active duty in Vietnam, said in
the "Life" article that Capt.
Ernest L. Medina reported to his
superiors from the scene, "I have
a body count of 310."
While no charges have been
placed against Medina, attorney F.
Lee Bailey said Sunday he has
entered the case in the captain's
behalf. Bailey declined to call
Medina his client, for technical
reasons, but affirmed that he was
acting for the captain.
Medina, a native of Springer,
N.M., was the commander of
Company C, First Battalion, 20th
Infantry, 11th Light Infantry
Brigade, which razed My Lai.
Some of the men in the platoon
have said he ordered the sweep.
The leader of his first platoon,
Lt. William L. Calley Jr., has been
charged by the Army with the
premeditated murder of 109
civilians there and with another
count of murder in the death of a
civilian in more than a month
earlier.
Sgt. Charles West, now a
mechanic in Chicago, said in

"Life," "Capt. Medina didn't give
an order to go in and kill women
or children. Nobody told us about
handling civilians because at the
time I don't think any of us were
aware of the fact that we'd run
into civilians."
Bailey told The Associated

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—lndians
occupying Alcatraz Island barred
palefaces Sunday, declared an
"Indian Day" of relaxation and
welcomed braves and squaws from
across the nation to their swelling
population.
The Indians laid claim to
Alcatraz 10 days ago under an
1868 treaty that returned unused
federal land to the Sious. They
plan to turn the abandoned
federal prison into a native
American cultural center.
"This is strictly an Indian
day," declared Ross Harden, 30, a
Winnebago Indian from Nebraska
and student at San Francisco
State College, as his companions
stopped all non-Indians, including
newsmen, at a docking area.
This left four caretakers as the
only white men on the island.
Said Harden: "We want to give
everybody a chance to relax
instead of having to hassle with
the press."
Bill Neal, 21, a Urok
Tribesman from Eureka, Calif.,
said 350 Indians stayed on the
island Saturday night, but others
put the figure at more than 600.
New arrivals included Indian
men and women from Oklahoma,
New Mexico, Alaska, New York
and towns around California.
They included a plumber and
an electrician, who began an

inspection of the island's
plumbing and electrical system.
An electrical generator was
hooked up, Harden said.
The day of rest was marred
somewhat when a 7-year-old girl,
Estelle Conway of San Francisco,
caught her leg between a dock and
a moored barge. She was
evacuated by a Coast Guard
launch and sent home after x-rays
showed no fractures.
Earlier Saturday, the Army
Corps of Engineers pumped
1,50,000 gallons of fresh water
from a barge onto the island,
which has no fresh water supply
of its own.
Richard Oakes, a 27-year-old
Mohawk and chief spokesman for
the Indians, called the water
delivery "another battle we have
won." But the Army termed it
routine.
A call for a "Great Pow-wow"
brought many of the new Indians
to the island for a six-hour
celebration Saturday night.
Harden said there was lots of
singing, dancing and eating.
The Indians want an audience
with Interior Secretary Walter
Hickel, who is in a Washington
hospital with a pinched nerve in
his neck. He has said he will talk
with the Indians but not on
prearranged terms.
Oakes said the Indians insist
that Hickel come to Alcatraz in
person. He added, smiling: "I just
wonder if that nerve happens to
bo his Indian nerve."
Kail Strike?
WASHINGTON ( AP)-Secretary
of Labor George W. Shultz
ordered Sunday night
around-the-clock talks starting
Monday between representatives
of the nation's railroads and four
shopcraft unions threatening to
strike by mid-week.

Talks recessed Sunday night
with cautious optimism expressed
by Shultz and by W.J. Usery Jr.,
assistant secretary of labor, that
agreement could be reached
before the strike deadline.
Shultz's order followed an
announcement by the railroads
that should the threatened strike
occur they "will have no
alternative but to discontinue
service throughout the country."
Shultz also ordered
negotiations moved to the Labor
Building from the office of
management's National Railway
Labor Conference.
The strike could come at 12:01
a.m. Wednesday, when President
Nixon's 60-day no-strike order,
obtained under the Railway Labor
Act, expires.
"If a voluntary agreement is
not reached by the deadline other
actions will have to be considered
by the administration," Shultz
said.
Usery said: "I am optimistic
that settlement can be reached.
Both parties have been
cooperating. Proposals have been
exchanged. Some progress has
been made. I believe both
earnestly desire to reach an
agreement."
The four unions represent
railroad machinists, sheet metal
workers, electricians and
boilermakers who maintain rolling
stock and equipment.
''The railroad industry
fervently hopes to avoid a
shutdown which would bring
inconvenience and hardship to the
American people," said John P.
Hiltz Jr., chairman of the National
Railway Labor Conference.
Poverty
WASHINGTON (AP) Official
government definitions of
poverty-income levels for families

have been raised from $200 to as
much as $1,800 on an annual
basis, the Labor Department
announced Sunday.
The new guidelines, which are
effective immediately, are used by
the Labor Department and the
Office of Economic Opportunity
in determining families' eligibility
for federal assistance in various
manpower programs for the
unemployed or unsuitably
employed.
The basic figure for an urban
family of four—the most
frequently used example—was
raised from $3,300 to $3,600. For
a similar rural family it was raused
from $2,300 to $3,000.
A figure of $8,400 was
established as the poverty level for
an urban family of 12, up from
$7,400. For a similar rural family
the change was from $5,200 to
$7,000.
For a single person at the
urban level the minimum was
boosted from $1,600 to $1,800
and at the rural level from $1,100
to $1,500.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—lndians
occupying Alcatraz Island barred
palefaces Sunday, declared an
"Indian Day" of relaxation and
welcomed braves and squaws from
across the nation to their swelling
population.
The Indians laid claim to
Alcatraz 10 days ago under an
1868 treaty that returned unused
federal land to the Sious. They
plan to turn the abandoned
federal prison into a native
American cultural center.
"This is strictly an Indian
day," declared Ross Harden, 30, a
Winnebago Indian from Nebraska
and student at San Francisco
State College, as his companions
stopped all non-Indians, including
newsmen, at a docking area.
This left four caretakers as the
only white men on the island.
Said Harden: "We want to give
everybody a chance to relax
instead of having to hassle with
the press."
Bill Neal, 21, a Urok
Tribesman from Eureka, Calif.,
said 350 Indians stayed on the
island Saturday night, but others
put the figure at more than 600.
New arrivals included Indian
men and women from Oklahoma,
New Mexico, Alaska, New York
and towns around California.
They included a plumber and
an electrician, who began an

inspection of the island's
plumbing and electrical system.
An electrical generator was
hooked up, Harden said.
The day of rest was marred
somewhat when a 7-year-old girl,
Estelle Conway of San Francisco,
caught her leg between a dock and
a moored barge. She was
evacuated by a Coast Guard
launch and sent home after x-rays
showed no fractures.
Earlier Saturday, the Army
Corps of Engineers pumped
1,50,000 gallons of fresh water
from a barge onto the island,
which has no fresh water supply
of its own.
Richard Oakes, a 27-year-old
Mohawk and chief spokesman for
the Indians, called the water
delivery "another battle we have
won." But the Army termed it
routine.
A call for a "Great Pow-wow"
brought many of the new Indians
to the island for a six-hour
celebration Saturday night.
Harden said there was lots of
singing, dancing and eating.
The Indians want an audience
with Interior Secretary Walter
Hickel, who is in a Washington
hospital with a pinched nerve in
his neck. He has said he will talk
with the Indians but not on
prearranged terms.
Oakes said the Indians insist
that Hickel come to Alcatraz in
person. He added, smiling: "I just
wonder if that nerve happens to
bo his Indian nerve."
Kail Strike?
WASHINGTON ( AP)-Secretary
of Labor George W. Shultz
ordered Sunday night
around-the-clock talks starting
Monday between representatives
of the nation's railroads and four
shopcraft unions threatening to
strike by mid-week.

Talks recessed Sunday night
with cautious optimism expressed
by Shultz and by W.J. Usery Jr.,
assistant secretary of labor, that
agreement could be reached
before the strike deadline.
Shultz's order followed an
announcement by the railroads
that should the threatened strike
occur they "will have no
alternative but to discontinue
service throughout the country."
Shultz also ordered
negotiations moved to the Labor
Building from the office of
management's National Railway
Labor Conference.
The strike could come at 12:01
a.m. Wednesday, when President
Nixon's 60-day no-strike order,
obtained under the Railway Labor
Act, expires.
"If a voluntary agreement is
not reached by the deadline other
actions will have to be considered
by the administration," Shultz
said.
Usery said: "I am optimistic
that settlement can be reached.
Both parties have been
cooperating. Proposals have been
exchanged. Some progress has
been made. I believe both
earnestly desire to reach an
agreement."
The four unions represent
railroad machinists, sheet metal
workers, electricians and
boilermakers who maintain rolling
stock and equipment.
''The railroad industry
fervently hopes to avoid a
shutdown which would bring
inconvenience and hardship to the
American people," said John P.
Hiltz Jr., chairman of the National
Railway Labor Conference.
Poverty
WASHINGTON (AP) Official
government definitions of
poverty-income levels for families

have been raised from $200 to as
much as $1,800 on an annual
basis, the Labor Department
announced Sunday.
The new guidelines, which are
effective immediately, are used by
the Labor Department and the
Office of Economic Opportunity
in determining families' eligibility
for federal assistance in various
manpower programs for the
unemployed or unsuitably
employed.
The basic figure for an urban
family of four—the most
frequently used example—was
raised from $3,300 to $3,600. For
a similar rural family it was raused
from $2,300 to $3,000.
A figure of $8,400 was
established as the poverty level for
an urban family of 12, up from
$7,400. For a similar rural family
the change was from $5,200 to
$7,000.
For a single person at the
urban level the minimum was
boosted from $1,600 to $1,800
and at the rural level from $1,100
to $1,500.

who was there, as saying "it was
point-blank murder."
Bernhardt, 23, "Life" wrote,

hell with this, I'm not doing it. I
didn't think this was a lawful
order."
Bernhardt, from Hempstead,
N.Y., is now stationed at Ft. Dix,
N.J. On Nov. 18 he became one of
the first eyewitnesses to My Lai to

He said then he had seen
American soldiers slay hundreds
of civilians at My Lai on March
16, 1968. Published figures of the
dead have ranged upwards to 567.
Spec. 5 John Kinch, who still is
on active duty in Vietnam, said in
the "Life" article that Capt.
Ernest L. Medina reported to his
superiors from the scene, "I have
a body count of 310."
While no charges have been
placed against Medina, attorney F.
Lee Bailey said Sunday he has
entered the case in the captain's
behalf. Bailey declined to call
Medina his client, for technical
reasons, but affirmed that he was
acting for the captain.
Medina, a native of Springer,
N.M., was the commander of
Company C, First Battalion, 20th
Infantry, 11th Light Infantry
Brigade, which razed My Lai.
Some of the men in the platoon
have said he ordered the sweep.
The leader of his first platoon,
Lt. William L. Calley Jr., has been
charged by the Army with the
premeditated murder of 109
civilians there and with another
count of murder in the death of a
civilian in more than a month
earlier.
Sgt. Charles West, now a
mechanic in Chicago, said in

"Life," "Capt. Medina didn't give
an order to go in and kill women
or children. Nobody told us about
handling civilians because at the
time I don't think any of us were
aware of the fact that we'd run
into civilians."
Bailey told The Associated
Press Sunday he was investigating
the matter on Medina's behalf
especially in the light of
statements made by Gl's who
were at My Lai.
r Indian Dav'
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—lndians
occupying Alcatraz Island barred
palefaces Sunday, declared an
"Indian Day" of relaxation and
welcomed braves and squaws from
across the nation to their swelling
population.
The Indians laid claim to
Alcatraz 10 days ago under an
1868 treaty that returned unused
federal land to the Sious. They
plan to turn the abandoned
federal prison into a native
American cultural center.
"This is strictly an Indian
day," declared Ross Harden, 30, a
Winnebago Indian from Nebraska
and student at San Francisco
State College, as his companions
stopped all non-Indians, including
newsmen, at a docking area.
This left four caretakers as the
only white men on the island.
Said Harden: "We want to give
everybody a chance to relax
instead of having to hassle with
the press."
Bill Neal, 21, a Urok
Tribesman from Eureka, Calif.,
said 350 Indians stayed on the
island Saturday night, but others
put the figure at more than 600.
New arrivals included Indian
men and women from Oklahoma,
New Mexico, Alaska, New York
and towns around California.
They included a plumber and
an electrician, who began an

inspection of the island's
plumbing and electrical system.
An electrical generator was
hooked up, Harden said.
The day of rest was marred
somewhat when a 7-year-old girl,
Estelle Conway of San Francisco,
caught her leg between a dock and
a moored barge. She was
evacuated by a Coast Guard
launch and sent home after x-rays
showed no fractures.
Earlier Saturday, the Army
Corps of Engineers pumped
1,50,000 gallons of fresh water
from a barge onto the island,
which has no fresh water supply
of its own.
Richard Oakes, a 27-year-old
Mohawk and chief spokesman for
the Indians, called the water
delivery "another battle we have
won." But the Army termed it
routine.
A call for a "Great Pow-wow"
brought many of the new Indians
to the island for a six-hour
celebration Saturday night.
Harden said there was lots of
singing, dancing and eating.
The Indians want an audience
with Interior Secretary Walter
Hickel, who is in a Washington
hospital with a pinched nerve in
his neck. He has said he will talk
with the Indians but not on
prearranged terms.
Oakes said the Indians insist
that Hickel come to Alcatraz in
person. He added, smiling: "I just
wonder if that nerve happens to
bo his Indian nerve."
Kail Strike?
WASHINGTON ( AP)-Secretary
of Labor George W. Shultz
ordered Sunday night
around-the-clock talks starting
Monday between representatives
of the nation's railroads and four
shopcraft unions threatening to
strike by mid-week.

Talks recessed Sunday night
with cautious optimism expressed
by Shultz and by W.J. Usery Jr.,
assistant secretary of labor, that
agreement could be reached
before the strike deadline.
Shultz's order followed an
announcement by the railroads
that should the threatened strike
occur they "will have no
alternative but to discontinue
service throughout the country."
Shultz also ordered
negotiations moved to the Labor
Building from the office of
management's National Railway
Labor Conference.
The strike could come at 12:01
a.m. Wednesday, when President
Nixon's 60-day no-strike order,
obtained under the Railway Labor
Act, expires.
"If a voluntary agreement is
not reached by the deadline other
actions will have to be considered
by the administration," Shultz
said.
Usery said: "I am optimistic
that settlement can be reached.
Both parties have been
cooperating. Proposals have been
exchanged. Some progress has
been made. I believe both
earnestly desire to reach an
agreement."
The four unions represent
railroad machinists, sheet metal
workers, electricians and
boilermakers who maintain rolling
stock and equipment.
''The railroad industry
fervently hopes to avoid a
shutdown which would bring
inconvenience and hardship to the
American people," said John P.
Hiltz Jr., chairman of the National
Railway Labor Conference.
Poverty
WASHINGTON (AP) Official
government definitions of
poverty-income levels for families

have been raised from $200 to as
much as $1,800 on an annual
basis, the Labor Department
announced Sunday.
The new guidelines, which are
effective immediately, are used by
the Labor Department and the
Office of Economic Opportunity
in determining families' eligibility
for federal assistance in various
manpower programs for the
unemployed or unsuitably
employed.
The basic figure for an urban
family of four—the most
frequently used example—was
raised from $3,300 to $3,600. For
a similar rural family it was raused
from $2,300 to $3,000.
A figure of $8,400 was
established as the poverty level for
an urban family of 12, up from
$7,400. For a similar rural family
the change was from $5,200 to
$7,000.
For a single person at the
urban level the minimum was
boosted from $1,600 to $1,800
and at the rural level from $1,100
to $1,500.
