# Environmental Group Meets
## 
### 
James S. Rummonds, a
Stanford law student, was
unanimously elected coordinator
of the National Environmental
Law Society [NELS] at that
group's organizational meeting
last Wednesday.
Representatives from eight
west coast law schools attended
the conference held at Stanford
Law School, acting with the prior
approval of law students at other
campuses across the nation.
The National Environmental
Law Society is a coalition of
environmental law groups at
Stanford, University of Southern
California, University of
California [UC] at Los Angeles,
UC-Davis, Boalt (Berkeley),
Hastings, University of Santa
Clara, Columbia, University of
Chicago and George Washington
University.
The primary function of the
NELS will be to publish
information on the activities of
the member environmental law
societies.
The national organization may
also coordinate local efforts on
problems of nation-wide concern,
such as liberalized abortion laws.
National Conference
The NELS hopes to convene a
national conference on
environmental law in late April.
The conference will include
workshops on the legal aspects of
specific environmental problems.
A release issued by the Society
said that "it will focus on legal
remedies and practical solutions,
and not degenerate into an
over-generalized exchange of
enlightened sympathies, which
made the recent California
Governor's conference, and this
week's UNESCO conference, so
ineffectual in meeting the crisis of
the environment."
"The threat to on*- existence is

very real," Rummonds said,
"Many ecologists believe the
human race has possibly 30 years
to live unless it starts cleaning
up."
Environmental law societies are
active in current court actions to
halt pollution and protect
undeveloped lands from industrial
expansion. They often produce
research which serves as the basis
for law suits filed by conservation
groups.
The suit recently filed against
Stanford University seeking to
stop industrial expansion into the
Coyote Hill area was researched
by members of the Stanford
Environmental Law Society.
Legal Action
At George Washington
University law students formed a
legal entitie, Gwasp Inc., and
personally filed suit against the
Washington D.C. municipal bus
system for its laxity in initiating
strenuous efforts to halt pollution
of the Capital's air by city buses.
Other law schools participating
in NELS give credit towards
graduation to students who do
research for environmental law
cases. Law school faculties
generally favor such policies, as
environmental law societies are
often the only groups which offer
law students practical experience
in environmental law research.
Impetus for the formation of
NELS was provided by
Rummonds and David Jackman,
another Stanford law student.
When the success of the Stanford
ELS, which they helped organize,
became apparent, they began
promoting the idea of a national
organization.
In August they contacted
environmental law societies at
major law schools, including Yale,
Columbia, Chicago, Boalt,
Michigan and Harvard.


TRUE BLISSâ€”The Undergraduate Library was left empty over much of the vacation, as befits the
Thanksgiving season. However, Dead Week is fast approaching, and with it the thought of finals. The best
of times are bound to come to an end.
