# Lyman Squelches Dartmouth Rumor

Richard Lyman tooK nimsen
out of the running Sunday for the
presidency of Dartmouth College,
a position he was rumored to be
considering.
The provost announced his
intentions of remaining at
Stanford, thereby squelching
newspaper reports last week that
he was the frontrunner for the
Dartmouth job.

Lyman's statement, issued last
night through the Stanford News
Service:
"In view of recent speculation
in the newspapers, I think I
should make clear that I am not at
present a candidate for any new
position nor am I engaged in
negotiations with any other
institution. I have a job to do at
Stanford, in times of difficulty for
all universities, and I am trying to
do it to the best of my abilitv."
Last night a statement leaves
unanswered the question of
whether he was seriously
considering the move to the
eastern college, or some other
academic institution.
But, as the provost made clear
in a statement last Thursday, a
number of college presidencies are
going begging, and a man in his
position is a natural candidate for
such an office.
"Like anyone else in a job like
mine, in a well known university,
1 have had inquiries from time to
time about college or university
presidencies, and have sometimes
discussed possibilities with
representatives from these
institutions," Lyman stated.
