Richard Lyman is a very unusual man. He has the
brilliant mind of a university scholar as well as the cool
expertise of an efficient administrator. With the rumors last
week that Lyman would be leaving for the presidency of
Dartmouth, the university community suddenly realized the
high regard that other universities afford this man.
Along with Lyman's unusual scholarly and managerial
abilities goes his unusual job as the University's number one
academic officer. The provost finds himself increasingly cut
off from academic life, spending enormous amounts of time
wrestling with budgetary questions. He is in many ways
trapped by an expanding bureaucracy that demands a
full-time financial wizard rather than a scholar who can
spend his time developing new responses to problems, not
simply dealing with Washington cutbacks.
Because of his distance from most of the community,
Lyman remains a shadowy, unfamiliar figure. He is not
charismatic or particularly out-going. In fact, some find him
cold, an unfortunate drawback for a man who must be
public. His job leaves him precious little time for anything
else except his weekly dorm dinner in Serra House.
A man this important and this valuable must be a man
involved to a far more significant degree in academic and
social change; he must be a man that people know and tiust.
It is one of those illogical impulses of university life that
promote the most essential individuals from their most
effective roles.
