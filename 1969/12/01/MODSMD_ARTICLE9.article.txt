## Kennedy Vs. Seifert 
### Peter S. Stern 
A recent exchange of letters in
the DAILY between Professor
Howard S. Seifert of Aeronautics
and Astronautics and Professor
David M. Kennedy of History
raises a number of serious issues
which should be the concern of all
members of the university
t community.
On November 11, Professor
Seifert availed himself of his
constitutional right of free
expression to charge with treason
those persons who were exercising
their constitutional rights "to
assemble, and to petition the
Government, for a redress of
I grievances" by participating in the
Moratorium. He spoke of "the
extraordinarily difficult task being
attempted in good faith by
specialist members of the federal
government." The stated that
"complex system problems,
whether they be traffic safety,
city planning, poverty or war [his
italics], are not solved by
parading, name-calling, and
malingering."
Incredible though it may seem,
nearly a week passed before
someone responsed to this letter,
on November 17, Professor
Kennedy pointed out the
implications of Professor Seifert's
letter: that dissent was treason,
and that "those of us without the
technical skills of systems analysis
have no business expressing
opinions on any of the major
public issues of our society."
Antidemocratic
The historian cited the
scientist's letter as an example of
"the radically antidemocratic
logic inherent in technological
thinking," and closed with an
appeal to the University "to foster
the courage and ingenuity to
preserve democratic values in he
face of the profoundly vicious
threat that ideas like Professor
Seifert's pose."
On November 24, Professor
Seifert categorically rejected all of
the implications which Professor
Kennedy read into his letter,
although nowhere in his reply is
there an explanation of what he
really did mean. He charges
"libel" and accuses Professor
Kennedy of acting with
"polarizing passion," a surprising
charge when one considers that
Professor Seifert has already
launched an accusation of treason
against the Moratorium marchers.
I do not have at hand the
Federal statute definition of
treason, but I note that Webster's
Third New International
Dictionary defines the word as
"the offense of attempting by
overt acts to overthrow the
government of the state to which
the offender owes allegiance or to
kill or personally injure the
sovereign or his family." What
convoluted logic could turn the
Moratorium march into treason?
Most of all, Professor Seifert is
incensed at the historian's charge
that there is "radically
anti-democratic logic inherent in
technological thinking."
In Good Faith
What should one conclude
from this exchange? I would
suggest an examination of
Professor Seifert's terms of
reference. In his first letter, he
states that the Administration is
attempting an extraordinarily
difficult task—to end the war—in
good faith. This is a matter of
opinion. Read I.F. Stone's article
in the current New York Review
for a contrary view.
Those persons who do not
accept Professor Seifert's terms of
reference have a legitimate right

to assemble in order to ask a
redress of grievances. The person
who cries "treason" in these
circumstances does appear to be
repudiating explicit constitutional
rights.
While rejecting name-calling,
Professor Seifert refers to the
Moratorium as a "circus," leading
one to wonder whether or not
there is something inherently
inconsistent in technological
thought. As for Professor
Kennedy's charge of
antidemocratic logic in
technological thinking, it may be
an exaggeration. After all,
Professor Siefert's letter may
merely be representative of his
own thought, rather than of all
technological thinking. It is not at
all necessary to distort the terms
of his letter in order to find
within it the implication that
non-specialists should hold their
tongues when confronted with
such "complex system problems"
was the war. Indeed, the scientist
states that the hard-working
specialists should have their
efforts rewarded with
"sympathetic support and
constructive criticism," all of
which implies that one does not
have the right to express the
opinion that the specialists are
wrong.
Georges Clemenceau warned,
in World War I, that war was too
important to be left to the
generals, as he asserted political
control over French policy. We
might conclude today that peace
is too important to be left to the
systems analysts.

expression to charge with treason
those persons who were exercising
their constitutional rights "to
assemble, and to petition the
Government, for a redress of
I grievances" by participating in the
Moratorium. He spoke of "the
extraordinarily difficult task being
attempted in good faith by
specialist members of the federal
government." The stated that
"complex system problems,
whether they be traffic safety,
city planning, poverty or war [his
italics], are not solved by
parading, name-calling, and
malingering."
Incredible though it may seem,
nearly a week passed before
someone responsed to this letter,
on November 17, Professor
Kennedy pointed out the
implications of Professor Seifert's
letter: that dissent was treason,
and that "those of us without the
technical skills of systems analysis
have no business expressing
opinions on any of the major
public issues of our society."
Antidemocratic
The historian cited the
scientist's letter as an example of
"the radically antidemocratic
logic inherent in technological
thinking," and closed with an
appeal to the University "to foster
the courage and ingenuity to
preserve democratic values in he
face of the profoundly vicious
threat that ideas like Professor
Seifert's pose."
On November 24, Professor
Seifert categorically rejected all of
the implications which Professor
Kennedy read into his letter,
although nowhere in his reply is
there an explanation of what he
really did mean. He charges
"libel" and accuses Professor
Kennedy of acting with
"polarizing passion," a surprising
charge when one considers that
Professor Seifert has already
launched an accusation of treason
against the Moratorium marchers.
I do not have at hand the
Federal statute definition of
treason, but I note that Webster's
Third New International
Dictionary defines the word as
"the offense of attempting by
overt acts to overthrow the
government of the state to which
the offender owes allegiance or to
kill or personally injure the
sovereign or his family." What
convoluted logic could turn the
Moratorium march into treason?
Most of all, Professor Seifert is
incensed at the historian's charge
that there is "radically
anti-democratic logic inherent in
technological thinking."
In Good Faith
What should one conclude
from this exchange? I would
suggest an examination of
Professor Seifert's terms of
reference. In his first letter, he
states that the Administration is
attempting an extraordinarily
difficult task—to end the war—in
good faith. This is a matter of
opinion. Read I.F. Stone's article
in the current New York Review
for a contrary view.
Those persons who do not
accept Professor Seifert's terms of
reference have a legitimate right

to assemble in order to ask a
redress of grievances. The person
who cries "treason" in these
circumstances does appear to be
repudiating explicit constitutional
rights.
While rejecting name-calling,
Professor Seifert refers to the
Moratorium as a "circus," leading
one to wonder whether or not
there is something inherently
inconsistent in technological
thought. As for Professor
Kennedy's charge of
antidemocratic logic in
technological thinking, it may be
an exaggeration. After all,
Professor Siefert's letter may
merely be representative of his
own thought, rather than of all
technological thinking. It is not at
all necessary to distort the terms
of his letter in order to find
within it the implication that
non-specialists should hold their
tongues when confronted with
such "complex system problems"
was the war. Indeed, the scientist
states that the hard-working
specialists should have their
efforts rewarded with
"sympathetic support and
constructive criticism," all of
which implies that one does not
have the right to express the
opinion that the specialists are
wrong.
Georges Clemenceau warned,
in World War I, that war was too
important to be left to the
generals, as he asserted political
control over French policy. We
might conclude today that peace
is too important to be left to the
systems analysts.
