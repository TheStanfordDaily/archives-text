Tate Arrests
LOS ANGELES (AP> Two
men and a women from a
nomadic hippie colony were
named Monday in murder
warrants in the bizarre slayings of
seven persons including actress
Sharon Tate and some of her
jet-set friends.
Police Chief Edward M. Davis
told a news conference he expects
the County Grand Jury to indict
four or five more persons.
Answering questions about the
commune, he said "perhaps it
could have a religious
connotation, depending on your
interpretation."
Named in the warrants are
Charles D. Watson, 24, held in
Collin County Jail at McKinney,
Texas, after being arrested at his
home; Patricia Kernwinkel, 21,
sought in Alabama, and Linda
Louise Kasabian, 19, sought in
New Mexico.
The warrant accuses them of
the "ritualistic" killings of Miss
Tate, 26, honey blonde pregnant
wife of Polish film director
Roman Polanski; Hollywood hair
stylist, Jay Sebring; coffee heiress,
Abigail Folger; Policy playboy,
Voityck Frokowsky and Steven
Parent, a friend of the care taker
at the Tate estate where the
bodies—shot and stabbed—were
found Aug. 9.

The three also were accused of
the killings a day later of a
wealthy market owner and his
wife, Mr. and Mrs. Leno A.
LaBianca, stabbed at their
Hollywood home.
f We Won t Move'
SAN FRANCISCO
(AP)- Leaders of the Indians
occupying Alcatraz Island refused
to budge Monday despite a
request by a U.S. government
posse sent to the famed "Rock"
by Secretary of Interior Walter J.
Hickel.
"We won't move," said Indian
spokesman Richard Oakes, asked
by newsmen what the redmen
would do it the General Services
Administration tried to evict
them.
Hickel said, through he
regional office of the GSA in San
Francisco, that it wasn't in his
power to transfer ownership of
?l-acre Alcatraz to the Indians as
they demand.
The secretary told the Indians,
about 300 braves, squaws and
papooses, that they should move
off the bleak former prison a mile
off San Francisco and pursue
discussions. He will not negotiate
while the Indians are on the
island, he said.
