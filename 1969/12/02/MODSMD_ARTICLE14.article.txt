# Tutors Needed For Foreigners
## 
### 
The Asian-American Student
Alliance (A AS A) was approached
three weeks ago with a plea for
help in tutoring newly arrived
Asian students in English at
Mountain View High School. As
the program was being organized,
it was discovered that not only
Filipino, Chinese, and Japanese
students wanted assistance, but
that Cuban, Mexican, El
Salvadoranian, Turkish, and
Iranian students were also
enrolled in the English As A
Second Language Program and
wanted help.
The English As A Second
Language Program is a series of
English courses designed by
teachers at Mountain View High
School to give students with little
or no knowledge of English
intensive instruction in the English
language. The purpose of the
program is to give each foreign
student enough language

experience so that he can begin
taking regular high school courses.
The role of the tutors in this
program is to supplement the
mechanical aids and classroom
instruction by focusing on the
individual student and his
personal needs. The foreign
students need people with whom
they can identify and who can
understand the frustration of
being in a new environment and
not being able to understand
simply classroom assignments or
their new friends. They also need
people from outside the school to
encourage them to use English
and develop confidence in them
since they get little practice in
their homes.
The foreign students involved
in the English As A Second
Language Program are bright and
proud, but they do need help in
acquiring skills in English. The
participation of tutors is essential
for the success of the program,
but, unfortunately, there are not
enough tutors involved to assist all
45 students enrolled in the
program.
The time required of Stanford
students in the tutoring program
is two hours a week, and the
rewards are many. Experience in a
foreign language is not a
requirement, and the chances of
expanding the program to other
schools, or enlarging the program
to include a drop-in center to deal
with drug abuse problems and
juvenile delinquency are good.
For those people interested in
participating in the tutoring
program, the AASA is having an
organizational meeting in the
Arroyo House lounge at 7:30
tonight.
