The Stanfrod University
Medical Center Auxiliary has
voted to donate $25,000 to
Stanford University Hospital for
the building of plastic and
reconstructive surgery suites at
the Hospital's Hoover Pavilion.
Auxiliary president, Mrs.
George E. Boyd of Los Altos
Hills, announced the gift
yesterday saying that the
volunteer organization intends to
make two additional gifts of
$25,000 or more for the project
in 1970 and 1971.
Expressing appreciation,
hospital director Dr. Thomas A.
Gonda said "we are deeply
indebted to the Medical Center
Auxiliary for this gift which will
enable us to again use Hoover
Pavilion as a surgical unit of the
hospital.
"The Hoover Pavilion is well
suited to care for patients who
need short term acute admissions
for procedures that do not require
general anesthesia. A number of
these patients are orthopedic and
burn patients, so we also plan to
develop extensive physical and
occupational therapy facilities
there to provide excellent
rehabilitation care," he said.
The plastic and reconstructive
surgery suites at Hoover will
include related facilities such as
nursing stations and on-call
quarters for a plastic surgeon and
a general house doctor.
The Auxiliary has served the
Medical Center since the Center
opened in 1959. It raises its
money solely through the gift
shops it operates and taffs at the
hospital.

Kuehnelt will speak on

Kuehnelt-Leddihn was educated in
Austria and Hungary, and is a foreign
contributor for the National Review.
He has written novels and theoretical
works in several languages; he has
traveled most of the world and has
reading ability in 17 languages.
