# Pre-Med Meeting
## 
### 
The main pre-med advisor, Dr.
Donald L. Stilwel!, will present a
program of orientation tonight for
all pre-medical students who plan
to apply to medical schools during
the coming year.
The talk will be given in room
271 of Tresidder Union from
7:30-9:30 p.m. Emphasis will be
placed on the variety of factors to
be considered by the applicant
and his advisor in selecting a
realistic list of schools he should
apply to.
This talk will be repeated on
January 15. Today's meeting is
primarily a convenience for
students about to go overseas, but
is open to all who will apply to
medical schools in 1970. All those
will will apply in 1970 must
attend either meeting.
