# Psychodrama Techniques
## 
### 
After a two-week delay, a
demonstration of psychodrama
techniques will be given this
afternoon at the Medical Center.
The presentation will be
directed by Husain Chung, head
of the Human Institute in Palo
Alto and a noted local figure in
the field of psychodrama.
The purpose of the
psychodrama, an experience often
held in 40-hour marathon
sessions, will be a confrontation
of whether psychiatry or
psychotherapy are relevent or
obsolete.
A session by Chung was held
three weeks ago at the Medical
Center on the emotional problems
of abortion, but space for another
gathering two weeks ago was
denied.
Permission has now been
obtained, and the demonstration
is slated for Room 106 of the Med
Center at 4:30 p.m.
Psychodrama is an event where
a number of people meet in a
room for an agreed period of
time, trying for a personal
break-through. Such a
break-through is achieved by
acting out certain experiences.
Chung defines psychodrama as
"a kind of very crude, miniature
life form, wherein each person can
be encouraged to become what
they are, or exhibit what they are,
as they are right now, and react
and respond to the various
situations created around them."
