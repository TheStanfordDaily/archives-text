# Petris To Speak
## 
### 
State Senator Nicholas Petris,
sponsor of the bill to ban the
internal combustion engine from
California by 1975, will speak
Wednesday evening at 7:30 p.m.
in Toyon Lounge.
The senator from Alameda
Country will address a meeting of
the Ecological Juncture Series on
possible legislative solutions to
our environmental problems.
Petris focused public attention
on air pollution by automobiles
last July by introducing his bill to
the State Senate and by bringing
multimillionaire inventor, William
Lear, originator of the
now-famous Lear Jet, to testify
before the Senate Public Health
and Safety Committee on the
feasibility of smog-free cars. Lear
affirmed that, if pressured
enough, the auto industry giants
could certainly produce sufficient
steam or gas turbine engines by
the deadline to replace
conventional cars.
