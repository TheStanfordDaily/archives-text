# Budget Crisis Debated

Humanities and Sciences
faculty members asked Monday to
be involved in guiding Stanford's
$2.5 million belt-tightening
program.
The request was introduced
following a half-hour presentation
to the faculty assembly by
Provost Richard VV. Lyman, who
said that he expected a seven-man
committee on financial planning
would be named within a week to
start studying possible budget
base cuts for the 1970-71 school
year.
Lyman said he anticipates that
three professors from the school
of humanities and sciences will be
among the five faculty members
on the group, which will be
named by the Academic Senate's
Committee on Committees. Two

students will also be named to the
group by their peers.
The belt-tightening program is
designed to bring income and
expenditures of the University
into balance over a four-year
period. Nearly $1 million is
expected to be trimmed next
year.
Lyman emphasized that there
is no painless way of reducing
expenditures.
