# Economist Decries Old Politics, Delays

Old politics continues to
hamper the new economics, a
nationally prominent Stanford
economist believes.
Professor G.L. Bach of the
Graduate School of Business says
significant changes are needed in
federal taxing and spending
processes for the new economics
to improve further the nation's
growth.
At present, he notes, "Federal
spending decisions are dominated
by some 30 appropriations
subcommittees, many of which
are ruled by committee chairmen
who are virtually feudal lords in
their feifdoms."
Attempts to obtain a more
flexible tax policy—changing rates
fairly rapidly in response to
economic trends—have been
hamstrung because they usually
are tied to reforms in the tax
structure itself, he notes.
Throughout the past decade,
federal fiscal decisions based on
the new economics have been
delayed from one to three years
because of delays in obtaining
both Presidential and
Congressional support.
If changes in fiscal policy have
tended to come late, changes in

federal monetary policy "have
often been too strong," he
continues. He suggests that the
Federal Reserve Board should
place a little less emphasis on
current money market conditions
and relatively more stress on a
stably growing monetary base.
"It is clear that in inflationary
periods such as the recent past,
interest rates and money market
conditions provide inadequate,
indeed dangerous, signals to the
monetary policy makers," he
comments.
"Quoted interest rates reflect
not only monetary policy and
'real' forces in thy economy, but
also to some unmeasurable extent
the inflationary expectations of
borrowers and lenders. Thus high
interest rates may indicate an
inflationary, easy money policy,
not a restrictive tight money
policy."
Given the political difficulties
of obtaining a more discretionary
fiscal policy and"the high
probability of continuing
inflationary pressures," Bach says,
"we are probably fortunate to
have a Fed somewhat independent
from the day-to-day political
pressures of our times.
Government policy makers
"may have a hard time keeping
the economy precisely on the
track of stable economic growth"
because "it is still the private
sector—a huge three-fourths of the
total economy — that largely
determines whether we have
prosperity or recession, falling or
rising prices," Bach adds.
In general, he concludes, "The
American public, and the
American political process, clearly
put first priority on avoiding mass
unemployment and achieving
general prosperity. But not far
behind comes the fear of
substantial inflation, with its
pressure on the government for
anti-inflation measures.
"Thus, the postwar period
teaches us to expect persistently
rising prices, that top priority will
be given to maintaining prosperity
and high level employment, but
that counter pressures will grow
rapidly if inflation goes beyond a
modest rate."
Bach discussed his views at a
recent American Bankers
Association symposium on public
policy and economic
understanding, held in
Washington, D.C. ___
