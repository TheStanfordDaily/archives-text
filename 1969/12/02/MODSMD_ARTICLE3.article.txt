## Oil Depletion Cut 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)--The
Senate voted Monday to. cut the
oil and gas depletion allowance
from 27Vi per cent to 23 per
centâ€”in an action which had been
pinpointed as a measure of the
chamber's desire for major tax
reform.
The 27'/2 per cent figure, which
critics said had become in nearly
half a century a chief symbol of
industry favoritism, fell by a
startlingly wide margin.
By a vote of 30 to 62, the
Senate rejected an amendment by
Democrat Allen H. Ellender of
Louisiana to restore the 27'/2 per
cent which the Senate Finance
Committee had voted to cut to 23
per cent.
The Senate then voted 52 to
38 to reject an amendmentby Sen.
John J. Williams, R-Del., to cut
the allowance to 20 per cent, the
figure in the House-passed bill.
The two actions constituted
acceptance of the Finance
Committee's figure of 23 per cent,
leaving the final outcome to the
Senate-House conference who will
be charged with compromising the
two bills.
The conferees could agree on
either the 23 per cent or the 20
per cent or, more likely, could
adopt some figure between the
two.
President Nixon in his
campaign for election endorsed
the 27'/2 per cent figure and has
since said he feels it should be
retained. But he has said he will
go along with a reduction if it is
the will of Congress.
The reduction in the allowance
for depletion of oil and natural
gas reserves to 23 per cent would
bring in an estimated $175 million
in new revenue compared with
$345 million that the 20 percent
House cut would yield.
Cost Overruns
WASHINGTON
(AP)--Mammoth cost overruns of
$16.2 billion in the military's 34
weapons programs have been
reported to Congress by Secretary
of Defense Melvin R. Laird.

The figure includes the C5A
cargo plane and Minuteman
missile overruns disclosed earlier
this year and overruns in the Navy
shipbuilding program that
Secretary of the Navy John H.
Chafee said could top $1 billion.
Those three items make up
only a small part of the total.
And Laird, disclosing the
overruns in House appropriation
subcommittee testimony released
Monday, said he expects the
$16.2 billion figure to grow
higher.
"I am still not convinced that
we have uncovered all the
deficiencies in our current
programs," Laird told the
subcommittee, "and we will
continue to examine them and
keep the Congress informed."
The C5A's $1.5 billion and
Minuteman's $478 million
overruns disclosed at
congressional hearings this year
were dwarfed by the two largest
items on Laird's list: $4.46 billion
for the Fill swinging jet bomber
and $3.2 billion for an MK48
torpedo program that has been
accumulating overruns since it
started in 1964.
Brewster Indicted
WASHINGTON (AP)-Former
Sen. Daniel B. Brewster, D-Md., a
national mail order house and a
Washington lobbyist were indicted
by a federal grand jury here
today on bribery charges.
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell
said the 10-count indictment,
besides Brewster, named Spiegel
Inc. of Chicago and Cyrus T.
Anderson, the Washington
representative of the mail order
house.
The indictment charged that
Brewster received $24,500 in
exchange for his vote on "postage
rate legislation" while he was a
member of the Senate and its Post
Office and Civil Service
Committee.
Brewster was defeated for
reelection last year by Sen.
Charles Mathias, a Republican.

Mitchell said the indictments
stemmed from lengthy
investigations by the FBI and
federal grand juries in Baltimore
and Washington.
They charged that Spiegel and
Ande son made five separate
payments to Brewster "with the
intent to influence his action, vote
and decision on the postage rate
legislation."
The payments were made, the
indictments allege, between Jan.
10, 1966 and Jan. 31, 1968.
If convicted on all five counts,
Brewster could face a maximum
penalty of $90,000 in fines and
62 years imprisonment.
Both Spiegel and Anderson
would face similar penalties if
convicted.
