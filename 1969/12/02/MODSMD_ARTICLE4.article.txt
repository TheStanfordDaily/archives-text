# By-Laws Changed By Student Senate
## 
### 
The student Senate last night
began the job of adopting bylaws
to fit the new constitution, but
was forced to adjorn abruptly
when a quorum call found the
meeting one member short.
The body accepted the bylaws
as reported by the bylaws
committee with only minor
revisions. It amended the
proposed bylaws so that it would
take a 4/5 vote of the Senate to
expel a member instead of the
proposed 2/3.
It also rejected the committee's
recommendation that in the
future the chairman must be a
member of the body before
election.
Guests Not Invited
A proposed bylaw admitting
the President of the University,
the Provost, and a representative
of the Faculty Senate as
permanent invited guests with
speaking privileges failed to
receive the 2/3 majority necessary
for adoption.
The Senate also voted that the
deputy chairman should succeed
the chairman if he permanently
leaves the job.
Several speakers had suggested
this change in the proposed bylaw
in order to insure that the deputy

chairman take his job seriously
and that the replacement
chairman be familiar with Senate
procedures.
Financial Data Study
In other actions, Chairman
Dave Edwards appointed a
committee to begin preliminary
study on what university financial
data should be made public.
At last week's meeting the
Senate resolved that it supported
the publication of financial data.
Several student leaders, including
Edwards and ASSU Council of
presidents members John Grube
and Pat Shea felt that the
resolution was too vague and
might constitute an opinion that
student's personal financial
records should be open for
inspection.
Edwards asked the Senate's
advice and received an opinion
that a committee should study
what financial records should be
open for inspection.
The Senate reiterated the
position the old student
Legislature took concerning Shea
and the Council of Presidents. It
ruled that Shea is the sole
President and that the
constitution specifically forbids a
multiple presidency.
