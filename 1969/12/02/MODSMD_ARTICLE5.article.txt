# Bookstore To Cut Student Discount
## 
### JESSE CEDARBAUM 
Inflation has struck once again
at poor, struggling Stanford
studentsâ€”this time in the form of
a reduction in student discounts
at the Stanford Bookstore.
As of January 2, the Bookstore
will reduce its student discount
rate from eight to five percent in a
move blamed primarily on the
increase in labor costs.
The discount change,
recommended by the store's
executive board, was approved by
the general membership of the
Bookstore at its annual meeting
Nov. 18 at the Faculty Club.
The action was taken to meet a
prospective deficit, caused for the
most part by salary increases
granted to match the new $400
per month minimum established
by the University for its staff.
Although independent from the
University, the Bookstore tries to
stay competitive with University
and area pay scales.
Increased Operating Costs
Other factors in the decreasing
net income of the store have been
increases in all operating costs and
increased losses on textbook sales.
In its fiscal year ending June
30, 1969, the Bookstore had a net
operating income of $978 from
sales totaling $2,796,507, after
paying out $197,071 in discounts
at the present 8% rate. It is hoped
that savings from the discount
reduction and from other
economies will keep the store in
the black during the present year.

Textbooks are bought and sold
by the Bookstore at a 20% profit
margin. However, normal
operating costs average 21% per
book sold. The added rebate, paid
in the form of a discount at the
time of purchase, brings the cost
of operations up to about 29%.
To cover this deficit,
approximately 30% of the
merchandise handled by the store
is in "high-cost." goods, or
materials other than books.
Bookstore Control
The Bookstore is a non-profit
corporation and is owned and
operated by a group of thirty
faculty members who pay one
dollar each for the title of
"Member of the Bookstore." The
store's small profits go mostly
into building improvements and
maintenance. But, noted Clifford
Weigle, professor of
communication and a member of
the store's board of directors,
"We're already operating at
capacity, so we've got to start
planning ahead."
Weigle also remarked that the
Bookstore is one of the few
college stores that still gives
rebates or discounts in the face of
rising inflation. Most stores that
still offer refunds reimburse their
customers in the form of a rebate
that they never have to pay
because "most of the customers
lose their sales slips and thus can't
claim their payment."
