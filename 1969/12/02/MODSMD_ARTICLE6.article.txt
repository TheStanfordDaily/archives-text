### PAULPAPANEK 
In what seemed to be a major tactical move, the
SDS voted last night to demand that President
Kenneth Pitzer not allow a job recruiter from
General Electric to recruit on campus Thursday
and Friday.
Further, a majority of about fifty people
present voted to hold a rally Thursday if the
demand is not met. and to "interfere in whatever
way seems appropriate" with the recruiting.
"We want to make it clear that we think it is
wrong for a company that's on strike to be
recruiting here on campus," one member said
Other reasons lor the (I.E. demonstration were
enumerated. "The University should not be in
complicity with the fourth largest defense
corporation in the IJ S by allowing it to reeruit on
campus," as SDS spokesman told The l)nil>
"We also feel that allowing a corporation where
the workers are on strike is making a decision
directly to support management over employees

There whs also considerable concern about tne
role of outside demonstrators at the rally. Steve
Weissma n introduced n resolution that would
encourage any people coming from off campus to
he "sensitive to the goals of the Stanford group"
at the demonstration.
A high school student who was present
announced that her student union was "interested
in getting the movement going at Stanford." and
would he willing to bring 30 <o 50 people to the
domonstv.it ion.
Several speakers stressed the importance of
mobilizing a larger portion of the student body,
and suggested programs for leaflet ing and
canvassing in the dorms. "We need some thought
of exemplary action." one member remarked,
looking forward to future SDS moves which might
need a broader base of student support
"I don't see the purpose of staging
demonstrations to prove our impotence; and we
don't want to scare people awav."
