# Local Draftables Shiver Through Lottery Ordeal

### FRANK MILLER 
Stanford University held its
breath for two hours last night as
the first draft lottery since World
War II decided the military fate of
8,000 Stanford students. /
Apprehension was great before
the draw began and as birth dates
were drawn, joy, despair, and
confusion flowed freely across
campus. The magic "safe"
numbers varied between 170 and
230. Those who drew below 150
know they will very probably be
drafted while the upper 200's and
300's are probably free from
military service.
The numbers were determined
by drawing birth dates from a

fishbowl. Each eligible male
between 19 and 26 is placed by
this draw in a certain order of call
as soon as he loses his deferment
and becomes I-A. The lower a
person's draft number, the more
likely he will be drafted during his
one year of eligibility.
Unlucky students born on
September 14 will be the first to
be drafted. That date was drawn
number one. Chuck Comann, a
sophomore, reacted initially with
surprise at being selected to go
first in the draft.
"I'm really trapped in this
situation. In a way it's good
because I know I'll go and I can
make my plans for graduate
school. It's no different being one
than one hundred; I'm going to go
in. In general, it forces me to
realize that my future faces me in
two years."
A Winner
At the other end of the lottery,
Norm Goodman, a junior in
political science, "won" the
lottery with his June 8 birthday
which was drawn last. His chances
of being drafted became zero. "I
love the world, I feel like getting
drunk," he said. "But I still think
the draft stinks. It's a barbaric,
misguided attempt at peace."
More confusion over their draft
status greeted those who drew
in-between numbers. They must
wait a year to see if they'll be
drafted. One confused student
commented, "One hundred

eighty-nine is kind of an
in d eterminant number. It
probably means I'll just wait it
[ the draft ] out."
Students in most dorms
gathered around radios at 5 p.m.
to listen apprehensively for their
number to be drawn. Some buried
their heads in their arms when
they realized that they really
would be drafted. Others just
walked out of the room silent and
frustrated.
Despair Replaced
As the numbers got higher, the
despair was replaced with growing
hope. Cries of "Yahoo!" and "All
right, I'll take it" broke out.
Most of the dinner
conversation in dorms centered on
the lottery. Some had missed the
broadcast and were not sure of
their numbers. Others were too
sure.
One senior witha number in
the thirties protested, "But my
eyesight is terrible, my knees are
bad, I have flat feet . . ."
Everyone at the table told him
those excuses were not good
enough.
Finally, he said, "Maybe I'll
like the army. . ."
Big Willi Girls
Even in all-girl corridors, he
lottery was big news. One girl
squealed, "My fiance is 365!"
Others with boyfriends or
brothers near the top were
unhappy.
Many students entered

sweepstakes across the campus.
Draft eligible males contributed
money into a pool and the
contestant whose birth date was
drawn first collected the money.
One winner, a number four
with a birth date of February 14,
was sophomore Chris Redburn.
He commented, "That's the way
the cookie crumbles. I really don't
feel that sorry for myself."
Most Resigned
Most people were resigned to
their fate. A junior who drew
number 91 said, "I'm confused.
That's my main thing. For me the
draft has always been two years
away. Now, it sort of hit me in
the face. One of the main reasons
I was in school was because of the
draft, which is kind of dumb. But
now I'll have to continue."
General resentment against the
draft surfaced repeatedly among
students—even those lucky ones
who probably won't be drafted.
One senior with a very high
number commented, "It's pretty
good [his number]. But the whole
thing is a crock of shit. After all,
someone is number one. It's
beside the point. The thing that's
wrong with it is that it's forced
conscription. The method really
doesn't matter."
Another student whose draft
number is now 213 quietly
explained his feelings, "If I'd
been number one it wouldn't have
changed my plans any. I decided
some time ago I wasn't going."

right, I'll take it" broke out.
Most of the dinner
conversation in dorms centered on
the lottery. Some had missed the
broadcast and were not sure of
their numbers. Others were too
sure.
One senior witha number in
the thirties protested, "But my
eyesight is terrible, my knees are
bad, I have flat feet . . ."
Everyone at the table told him
those excuses were not good
enough.
Finally, he said, "Maybe I'll
like the army. . ."
Big Willi Girls
Even in all-girl corridors, he
lottery was big news. One girl
squealed, "My fiance is 365!"
Others with boyfriends or
brothers near the top were
unhappy.
Many students entered

sweepstakes across the campus.
Draft eligible males contributed
money into a pool and the
contestant whose birth date was
drawn first collected the money.
One winner, a number four
with a birth date of February 14,
was sophomore Chris Redburn.
He commented, "That's the way
the cookie crumbles. I really don't
feel that sorry for myself."
Most Resigned
Most people were resigned to
their fate. A junior who drew
number 91 said, "I'm confused.
That's my main thing. For me the
draft has always been two years
away. Now, it sort of hit me in
the face. One of the main reasons
I was in school was because of the
draft, which is kind of dumb. But
now I'll have to continue."
General resentment against the
draft surfaced repeatedly among
students—even those lucky ones
who probably won't be drafted.
One senior with a very high
number commented, "It's pretty
good [his number]. But the whole
thing is a crock of shit. After all,
someone is number one. It's
beside the point. The thing that's
wrong with it is that it's forced
conscription. The method really
doesn't matter."
Another student whose draft
number is now 213 quietly
explained his feelings, "If I'd
been number one it wouldn't have
changed my plans any. I decided
some time ago I wasn't going."
Stanford University held its
breath for two hours last night as
the first draft lottery since World
War II decided the military fate of
8,000 Stanford students. /
Apprehension was great before
the draw began and as birth dates
were drawn, joy, despair, and
confusion flowed freely across
campus. The magic "safe"
numbers varied between 170 and
230. Those who drew below 150
know they will very probably be
drafted while the upper 200's and
300's are probably free from
military service.
The numbers were determined
by drawing birth dates from a

fishbowl. Each eligible male
between 19 and 26 is placed by
this draw in a certain order of call
as soon as he loses his deferment
and becomes I-A. The lower a
person's draft number, the more
likely he will be drafted during his
one year of eligibility.
Unlucky students born on
September 14 will be the first to
be drafted. That date was drawn
number one. Chuck Comann, a
sophomore, reacted initially with
surprise at being selected to go
first in the draft.
"I'm really trapped in this
situation. In a way it's good
because I know I'll go and I can
make my plans for graduate
school. It's no different being one
than one hundred; I'm going to go
in. In general, it forces me to
realize that my future faces me in
two years."
A Winner
At the other end of the lottery,
Norm Goodman, a junior in
political science, "won" the
lottery with his June 8 birthday
which was drawn last. His chances
of being drafted became zero. "I
love the world, I feel like getting
drunk," he said. "But I still think
the draft stinks. It's a barbaric,
misguided attempt at peace."
More confusion over their draft
status greeted those who drew
in-between numbers. They must
wait a year to see if they'll be
drafted. One confused student
commented, "One hundred

eighty-nine is kind of an
in d eterminant number. It
probably means I'll just wait it
[ the draft ] out."
Students in most dorms
gathered around radios at 5 p.m.
to listen apprehensively for their
number to be drawn. Some buried
their heads in their arms when
they realized that they really
would be drafted. Others just
walked out of the room silent and
frustrated.

know they will very probably be
drafted while the upper 200's and
300's are probably free from
military service.
The numbers were determined
by drawing birth dates from a

fishbowl. Each eligible male
between 19 and 26 is placed by
this draw in a certain order of call
as soon as he loses his deferment
and becomes I-A. The lower a
person's draft number, the more
likely he will be drafted during his
one year of eligibility.
Unlucky students born on
September 14 will be the first to
be drafted. That date was drawn
number one. Chuck Comann, a
sophomore, reacted initially with
surprise at being selected to go
first in the draft.
"I'm really trapped in this
situation. In a way it's good
because I know I'll go and I can
make my plans for graduate
school. It's no different being one
than one hundred; I'm going to go
in. In general, it forces me to
realize that my future faces me in
two years."
A Winner
At the other end of the lottery,
Norm Goodman, a junior in
political science, "won" the
lottery with his June 8 birthday
which was drawn last. His chances
of being drafted became zero. "I
love the world, I feel like getting
drunk," he said. "But I still think
the draft stinks. It's a barbaric,
misguided attempt at peace."
More confusion over their draft
status greeted those who drew
in-between numbers. They must
wait a year to see if they'll be
drafted. One confused student
commented, "One hundred

eighty-nine is kind of an
in d eterminant number. It
probably means I'll just wait it
[ the draft ] out."
Students in most dorms
gathered around radios at 5 p.m.
to listen apprehensively for their
number to be drawn. Some buried
their heads in their arms when
they realized that they really
would be drafted. Others just
walked out of the room silent and
frustrated.
Despair Replaced
As the numbers got higher, the
despair was replaced with growing
hope. Cries of "Yahoo!" and "All
right, I'll take it" broke out.
Most of the dinner
conversation in dorms centered on
the lottery. Some had missed the
broadcast and were not sure of
their numbers. Others were too
sure.
One senior witha number in
the thirties protested, "But my
eyesight is terrible, my knees are
bad, I have flat feet . . ."
Everyone at the table told him
those excuses were not good
enough.
Finally, he said, "Maybe I'll
like the army. . ."
Big Willi Girls
Even in all-girl corridors, he
lottery was big news. One girl
squealed, "My fiance is 365!"
Others with boyfriends or
brothers near the top were
unhappy.
Many students entered

sweepstakes across the campus.
Draft eligible males contributed
money into a pool and the
contestant whose birth date was
drawn first collected the money.
One winner, a number four
with a birth date of February 14,
was sophomore Chris Redburn.
He commented, "That's the way
the cookie crumbles. I really don't
feel that sorry for myself."
Most Resigned
Most people were resigned to
their fate. A junior who drew
number 91 said, "I'm confused.
That's my main thing. For me the
draft has always been two years
away. Now, it sort of hit me in
the face. One of the main reasons
I was in school was because of the
draft, which is kind of dumb. But
now I'll have to continue."
General resentment against the
draft surfaced repeatedly among
students—even those lucky ones
who probably won't be drafted.
One senior with a very high
number commented, "It's pretty
good [his number]. But the whole
thing is a crock of shit. After all,
someone is number one. It's
beside the point. The thing that's
wrong with it is that it's forced
conscription. The method really
doesn't matter."
Another student whose draft
number is now 213 quietly
explained his feelings, "If I'd
been number one it wouldn't have
changed my plans any. I decided
some time ago I wasn't going."
