# Washington Roulette Returns
## 
### ED KOHN 
Men between 19 and 26 born
on Sept. 14 were picked to be the
first to go at 5 p.m., PST last
night as the nation's newly-revised
conscription lottery was
conducted at Selective Service
headquarters in Washington, D.C.
The lottery was the first to be
held since 1942. It followed
President Nixon's signing an
Executive Order a week ago
revising the procedures for
selection so that younger men will
be drafted first. The lottery ended
about 6:37 p.m. as a benediction
was offered.
Rep. Alexander Pirnie
(R-N.Y ), the ranking Republican
on a special House subcommittee
dealing with draft revisions, drew
the first capsule, containing Sept.

14, from the glass bowl shortly
after 5 p.m., PST. He was
succeeded by more than 50 young
men and women who have been
advising the President on the
draft.
One member of the group,
known as the Draft Advisory
Council, refused to take his turn
drawing a capsule. David L.
Fowler, a black from Washington,
D.C., said that his delegation had
instructed him not to take his
turn at the drawing for reasons
that would be explained later.
Protest at Ceremony
Larry McKibben, a member of
the lowa delegation, held up the
ceremonies briefly to read a
statement signed by fourteen
members of the advisory council
expressing "deep concern" over
the lottery system.
The group's statement also
protested the "total exclusion of
two individuals who did not wish
to actually draw numbers." The
unnamed delegates were from
Michigan and Alaska.
Some 25 college-age youths
stood outside the Selective Service
building to protest the lottery
during the proceedings. In a
statement, they termed the new
system "a masterful joke on the
American people." Some
members of the group said that
they would now have to burn
their birth certificates as well as
their draft cards.
The Selective Service estimates
that its manpower requirements
will be fulfilled by those up to the
170 th number pickedâ€”at the
most, the 230 th birthdate. Thus
those men whose numbers are
higher than 230 can be reasonably
sure that they will never face the
draft except in case of national
emergency or total mobilization.
Number Determines Dale
Men between 19 and '26

classified 1-A or 1-A-0 will be
called to service in the order in
which their birthdates were
selected last night. Those who are
presently deferred and who will
become eligible at a future date,
and who fall in the 19 to 26
category, will retain the number
that was drawn for them last
night.
392 capsules, one for each day
of the year including Feb. 29 and
one for each letter of the
alphabet, were selected. In the
event that two men at the same
draft board have the same
birthdate, the one whose last
name starts with the name first
drawn will be the first to be
drafted.
According to Nixon's
Executive Order, there will be a
new lottery held each Fall for the
men who turn 19 during the
preceding year and were not
eligible for the previous lottery.
Completed Rapidly
Last night's lottery was opened
after a brief invocation when draft
director Lewis B. Hershey ordered
that the black box containing the
capsules be unlocked and the
cylinders poured into the glass
container. The slips of paper in
the capsules were gummed on the
back and they were pasted on a
large board at one end of the
auditorium. The proceedings
lasted a little more than an hour
and a half.
The nation's last lottery,
conducted in 194 2, took some
sixteen hours to complete, as
10,000 capsules had to be
withdrawn, opened and read
during that ceremony. The results
of that lottery were never fully
utilized as the nation declared full
mobilization for World War II and
drafted every eligible young man
as soon as he could be squeezed
into a training camp.
