# Strip Slopped
## Bodkinophiles Upset 
### Skip Harris 
If The Daily would like to
make a real contribution to the
~| newspaper craft, it now has a
golden opportunity. Until last
Monday the Chronicle could boast
two first-rate features: Art Hoppe
and "Odd Bodkins." Two and a
half if you count Herb Caen, back
to two if you count "Dear Abby."
The Chronicle, in its wisdom,
has seen fit to discontinue the
cartoon strip "Odd Bodkins." The
reason given by the Chronicle is
that room was needed for "Miss
Peach." The reason not given by
the Chronicle is that the
publisher, Mr. Charles de Young
Thieriot, did not like the strip.
Since the first day of the
demise of "Odd Bodkins," the
Chronicle has received thousands
of phone calls and letters from
upset Bodkinophiles. There have
been articles in The Daily
Californian and The Daily Cator
protesting the action by the
Chronicle.
Nonetheless, the author of
"Odd Bodkins," Dan O'Neill,
informs us that there are no plans
to restore the strip. You might
wonder if this much ruckus would
be raised if "Apartment 3-G"
were to be discontinued. You can
be sure that if "Apartment 3-G"
disappeared and as loud a noise
were made over it as has been
made over "Odd Bodkins," that
"Apartment 3-G" would soon be
back into print.
Political Overtones
Unfortunately, the cartoon in
question has political and
philosophical overtones that are
not in the "mainstream of
American thought." "Odd
Bodkins" might even appeal to a
well known core of "effete snobs"
who are upset at the way things
are done around here.
At this point, I'd like to inform
Mr. C. de Y. Thieriot that some of
us who don't want to burn down
President Pitzer also happen to
like "Odd Bodkins." See, we feel
that it comes from a guy who is
aware of the world we face. It was
nice to know that a talented
Pepsi generation drop-out could
still be heard.
There is no reason not to
equate the Chronicle's actions
with those taken by CBS vis a vis
the Smothers Brothers. You can
only step on so many toes these
days. In neither case is there a real
question of censorship, only one
of taste. Some of you will just
have to suck it again.

However, if you want to show
that you don't like sucking it any
more than you have to, you can
write, phone, or picket the
Chronicle (The staff of which
recently picketed the Examiner
officcs protesting the editorial
policies of William Randolph
Hearst, Jr.). Just a few phone calls
expressing the sentiment: "I like
'Odd Bodkins,' I don't like the
way it was taken out, I don't
intend to buy your lousy paper
until it's back in," can work
wonders.
In the meantime you can catch
Don O'Neill's new book, Hear the
Sound ol My Feet Walking Drown
the Sound of My Voice Talking at
your bookstore. He will also be
the guest of Tresidder Union in
January in case you want to
assure yourself that he is for real.

question of censorship, only one
of taste. Some of you will just
have to suck it again.

However, if you want to show
that you don't like sucking it any
more than you have to, you can
write, phone, or picket the
Chronicle (The staff of which
recently picketed the Examiner
officcs protesting the editorial
policies of William Randolph
Hearst, Jr.). Just a few phone calls
expressing the sentiment: "I like
'Odd Bodkins,' I don't like the
way it was taken out, I don't
intend to buy your lousy paper
until it's back in," can work
wonders.
In the meantime you can catch
Don O'Neill's new book, Hear the
Sound ol My Feet Walking Drown
the Sound of My Voice Talking at
your bookstore. He will also be
the guest of Tresidder Union in
January in case you want to
assure yourself that he is for real.

If The Daily would like to
make a real contribution to the
~| newspaper craft, it now has a
golden opportunity. Until last
Monday the Chronicle could boast
two first-rate features: Art Hoppe
and "Odd Bodkins." Two and a
half if you count Herb Caen, back
to two if you count "Dear Abby."
The Chronicle, in its wisdom,
has seen fit to discontinue the
cartoon strip "Odd Bodkins." The
reason given by the Chronicle is
that room was needed for "Miss
Peach." The reason not given by
the Chronicle is that the
publisher, Mr. Charles de Young
Thieriot, did not like the strip.
Since the first day of the
demise of "Odd Bodkins," the
Chronicle has received thousands
of phone calls and letters from
upset Bodkinophiles. There have
been articles in The Daily
Californian and The Daily Cator
protesting the action by the
Chronicle.
Nonetheless, the author of
"Odd Bodkins," Dan O'Neill,
informs us that there are no plans
to restore the strip. You might
wonder if this much ruckus would
be raised if "Apartment 3-G"
were to be discontinued. You can
be sure that if "Apartment 3-G"
disappeared and as loud a noise
were made over it as has been
made over "Odd Bodkins," that
"Apartment 3-G" would soon be
back into print.
Political Overtones
Unfortunately, the cartoon in
question has political and
philosophical overtones that are
not in the "mainstream of
American thought." "Odd
Bodkins" might even appeal to a
well known core of "effete snobs"
who are upset at the way things
are done around here.
At this point, I'd like to inform
Mr. C. de Y. Thieriot that some of
us who don't want to burn down
President Pitzer also happen to
like "Odd Bodkins." See, we feel
that it comes from a guy who is
aware of the world we face. It was
nice to know that a talented
Pepsi generation drop-out could
still be heard.
There is no reason not to
equate the Chronicle's actions
with those taken by CBS vis a vis
the Smothers Brothers. You can
only step on so many toes these
days. In neither case is there a real
question of censorship, only one
of taste. Some of you will just
have to suck it again.
