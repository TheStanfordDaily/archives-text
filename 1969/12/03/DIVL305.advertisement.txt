An Aniiouncemement
The Draft's Fixed
(The following non-paid, non-political announcement was
submitted to the DAILY by those statistical spoilsports at Sigma
Chi.)
Below are the computations which represent each month's
"average" for Sam's raffle this year. If we were to assume that the
"bin" was filled by the progressive order in months —starting at the
bottom with January and culminating with December—and that
when the bin was spun, centrifugal force maintained the initial
order then we could easily surmise that one's chance of getting
fucked by Sam would get progressively better the later in the year
you are born. (Come to think of it, did you see any hands dig
down real deep in the bin?)
The question is whether the average for each month bear this
surmise out. Here are those averages:
December: 90.2—lowest
November: 112.07—2nd lowest
October: 182.2—6 th
September: 156.2—3rd
August: 169.8—4 th
July: 180.4—5 th
June: 195.7 —7 th x
May: 204.7-11 th
April: 203.7 —10th
March: 225.8—highest
February: 203—9 th
January: 201.1—8 th
One final note: l/3rd of December's numbers were below
61—which was 1/6 of the total. The odds against this were 2 to 1.
Ergo???
