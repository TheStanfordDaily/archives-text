Let's Consider: The Obligation of Universities
rii
————————-
ni
In a free society universities perform four primary functions which no other institutions are
112
equipped to fulfill in sufficient measure:
To educate scholars capable of assimilating, organizing
and transmitting knowledge to oncoming generations.
*
To educate open-minded, intellectually disciplined, and
emotionally mature citizens.
To educate competent professiora! workers in all areas
needed by society.
To create and organize new knowledge — research.
Recently another function has been advocated that universities become dedicated or
gans of social change and political action. Is this a good proposal?
For a university to advocate specific social change or political action it must take and sup
port one consensus view, but ths is antithetical to a necessary condition for research and scholar
ship the maintenance of an open intellectual atmosphere in which ideas can be tested one
against another and each confronted with all available data free from a priori bias or unbear
ble group pressure. Moreover, the university works with and needs the support of members of
all political factions. It cannot retain this support and also act as an organ for political action.
Thus, while individual members of the university community can and should state their posi
tion and take political action, as individuals, the university as an institution cannot do so with
out seriously jeopardizing its ability to perform its primary functions. Clear separation of indivi
dual political rights and obligatons from those of the university as an institution is essential to
the preservation and growth of a free society.
Where do you stand? Will you insist the university perform its primary functions, or will you
jeopardize those functions by insisting it support your own personal political view?
