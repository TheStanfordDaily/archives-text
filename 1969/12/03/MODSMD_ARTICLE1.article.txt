# Group Criticizes Land Development

### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Another campus group
criticized university land
development policies and asked
for an end to further construction
until a thorough study can be
made of the development's effects
on ecology, housing, and
employment.
In a letter delivered yesterday
to President Kenneth Pitzer,
David Jones, former chairman of
the Committee for New Politics,
also asked for "an immediate
clarification of the University's
land development policies and a
disclosure of the University's
criteria for land development
decisions."
Recently conservation groups
including the Environmental Law
Society, Stanford Conservation
Group, and Committee for Green
Foothills have pressured other
campus organizations to join them
in opposing the Coyote Hill
project, a thirty acre site
scheduled for light industrial
development within the next year.
New Study Asked
Specifically Jones requested
"that Stanford cease grading,
construction and leasing in the
foothill area" until the University
studies the "impact of the
development upon the ecological
balance" of the area.
Secondly Jones asked for
another study of the effect of
Stanford Industrial Park
employment on "Mid-peninsula
housing needs, tax levels, ethnic
composition and transportation
and recreation needs."
Finally he asked the University
to study "the economic, social,
and environmental advantages and
disadvantages of alternative
land-use proposals."
Jones feels that unless more

campus opposition can be
mobilized, the fight to save
Coyote Hill from development
will be lost.
Damage Done?
Some roads in the area have
already been completed prior to
building construction, Jones said.
"The Law Society and
Conservation Group may be able
to stop further construction," he
added, "but the damage may
already be done."
Forty per cent of the Coyote
Hill area will be developed,
according to Jones. Half of this
area will be occupied by buildings
and the other part will be roads,
parking lots, and landscaping.
Boyd Smith, assistant manager
of real estate, commented that
"All university land policies are
public." He said that the
university business office "doesn't
formulate policy; it follows orders
from the Board of Trustees who
decide on land use."
