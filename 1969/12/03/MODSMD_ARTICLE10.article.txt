# Still A Rough Draft
## Lottery Questions Answered 
### Alan Strain 
Perhaps the most direct way to
clear up some of the confusion
which has been created by the
lottery and the changes in
Selective Service Regulations is to
answer some of the most common
questions which have been asked
during the past several days.
I won't be nineteen until 1970.
Did Monday night's drawing apply
to ine, and when do I get into the
draftable pool?
No, Monday's drawing did not
apply to you. A new drawing will
be held late next year which will
determine your priority for call.
You will then enter the new
priority selection group which will
begin January 1, 1971, unless you
are deferred at that time. If you
are deferred, you will enter the
draftable pool at any time you
lose your deferment and revert to
I-A, up to age 26. Whenever you
do enter the draftable group your
priority will be determined by the
drawing that originally applied to
you as a nineteen-year-old.
Will the lottery affect my
deferment?
The "random selection
method" proclaimed by President
Nixon changes nothing except the
order of call. Strictly as a matter
of law it does not in any way alter
the classification system or the
reasons for which men may be
deferred. It is my guess, however,
that it may affect the policies of
many local boards with respect to
those deferments about which the
local board is granted wide
discretion, such as occupational
deferments. Betty Vetter,
Executive Director of the
Scientific Manpower Commission
in Washington, speculates that
many boards may view the man
who drew a low number much as
they now view the man nearing
26, making them less likely to
grant occupational deferments.
My number is in the 300's. I
want to give up my 11-Sand be
classified I-A immediately so I will
be in the 1970 group. How do I
do that?
Chances are if you already have
a 11-S for the current year that
your draft board will not consider
it possible to legally reclassify you
unless you drop out of school and
notify them. However, you can
hold your 11-S until the end of the
school year (normally October, if
not a senior) and still be in the
1970 priority selection group.
If I lose my student deferment
and become I-A next October will
I drop into the pool them, or not
until January '71.
You move into the priority
selection group just as soon as you
become I-A.
How long do I have to be in
the group to complete my year's
liability?

Three months or even a week
during which you are subject to
call has exactly the same effect as
a full year in the draftable group,
since the entire year's call to date
catches up with you on the day
you become I-A and join the
draftable men for that year. If
your number has already been
reached you are drafted
immediately. If not, and you pass
December 31 before your board
reaches your number, your
liability ends just the same as the
I-A who has been in he priority
selection group for twelve
months.
II it is late in the year and it
looks as if my number will be
reached, can I file an appeal to get
me beyond December 31 and out
of the draftable group?
The only effect of filing an
appeal is to delay an induction
order. If while on appeal your
number is reached before the end
of the calendar year and if the
appeal is finally unsuccessful you
will still be called even though the
appeal has carried you into the
next year without an induction
order. Of course if your appeal is
successful and you receive a
deferred classification you will
become liable again at some
future date should you become
I-A.
I will be 26 in March. Will I be
subject to call until December 31
or only until my birthday?

If your number has not been
reached your liability ends on
your birthday.
I received an induction order in
November which has been
postponed till June. Will I come
under the lottery or not?
You won't be affected by the
lottery in any way so long as your
induction order is merely
postponed. If you want to be
subject to the lottery you must
first have your classification
reopened and your induction
order cancelled. Your situation
emphasizes the crucial difference
between a postponement of
induction and a I-S(C) which is
issued after receipt of an
induction order to full time
undergraduate students and to
which some graduate students
may still be entitled. Incidentally,
your local board has the authority
to reopen your classification at
any time, provided there has been
a change in your status "due to
circumstances beyond the
registrant's control" (the lottery?)
which occured since you were last
classified by your board. If your
local board will not reopen, your
State Director or the National
Director also has the power to
order reopening.
