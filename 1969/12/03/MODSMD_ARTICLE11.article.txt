# A 						Statement Before Congress
## BW & The Extinction Of Man 
### Joshua Lederberg 
(The following is the first half
Of a statement by Professor
Joshua Lederberg of the
Department of Genetics before
the Subcommittee on National
Security Policy and Scientific
Developments, of the House
Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The second half of Professor
Lederberg's statement will appear
tomorrow.)
I am grateful for this
opportunity to express my
profound concern about the
continued involvement of this and
other nations in the development
of biological warfare.
This process puts the very
future of human life on earth in
serious peril.
It is all the more tragic because
the great powers who should be
hastening to institute
international controls have very
little to gain and much to lose in
relation to the present balance of
nuclear deterrence. Except for
incidental contagion, chemical
warfare presents many similar
issues; but I cannot speak to them
with the same immediacy of
personal expert knowledge.
Our ratification of the Geneva
Protocol would represent only the
first small step towards the
negotiation of international
controls. However, so long as we
have isolated ourselves as the only
-jmajor power to refuse to enter
into its commitment, this stands
as an immediate distraction to
further negotiation. It leaves on
the record a very low and
;u n convincing reading, indeed,
about our earnestness as a nation
in seeking a world order for the
management of this problem.
Cites Career
My own research career has
centered on the genetics of
bacteria With Dr. E.L. Tatum,

then at Yale, I had the thrill of
discovering genetic recombination
in bacteria. Later at the University
of Wisconsin with my then
graduate student Norton Zinder
(like E.L. Tatum now a professor
at Rockefeller University) I was
again privileged to help unearth
genetic transduction (the use of
viruses to convey information
from cell to cell). I have also
studied bacterial mutation, for
example to resistance against the
action of antibiotic drugs, in work
that complemented the pioneering
studies of Drs. S.E. Luria and Max
Delbrueck (named for the 1969
Nobel prize in medicine),
Basic scientists who have
worked in the genetics of bacteria
and viruses believe that these
discoveries have ever growing
importance for the prevention and
healing of serious human diseases.
We live, in the present era, in an
incompletely justified optimism
about having "conquered
infectious bacterial disease" as the
fruit of the development of the
antibiotics. However, viruses are
in general still beyond the reach
of antibiotic therapy. Even
bacteria, believed to be under firm
control with antibiotics, are
continuing their own evolution
and continue their assaults upon
human health with renewed vigor.
In the long run, only our
continued vigilance over bacterial
evolution can justify our hope of
maintaiing a decisive lead in this
life and death race.
However, whatever pride I
might wish to take in the eventual
human benefits that may arise
from my own research is turned
into ashes by the application of
this kind of scientific insight for
the engineering of biological
warfare agents. In this respect we
are in somewhat the same position

as the nuclear physicists who
foresaw the development of
atomic weapons.
BW Unstabili/ing
There is, however, a crucial
difference. Nuclear weaponry
depends on the most advanced
industrial technology. It has then
been monopolized by the great
powers long enough to sustain a
de facto balance of deterrence and
to build a security system based
on non-proliferation. Nuclear
power has thus, ironically,

become a stabilizing factor
tending to reinforce the status
quo in parallel with established
levels of economic and industrial
development. Germ power will
work just the other way.
The United Nations Study
Report on chemical and biological
weaponry has summarized some
infectious agents that have served
as points of departure for the
development of biological
weapons. Any knowledgeable
virologist could suggest many

more. I will not repeat these
technical details, nor will 1
bludgeon you with the horrible
diseases that some of these agents
provoke. I will also leave to your
own conscience the burden of
moral judgements about using
these kinds of weapons. Most
Americans would be repelled by
the thought, but perhaps no less
by exposure to the human
realities of any other form of
warfare. Overriding such
comparisons should be the grave
moral issue in a policy that risks
the lives of a world of innocent
bystanders. Fortunately, these
concerns actually converge with
our self-interest in calling for a
halt to BW before it becomes
established in the arms-traffic of
the world.
My main fears about BW have
to do with the side-effects of its
proliferation 1) as a technique of
aggression by smaller nations and
insurgent groups and 2) by the
inadvertent spread of disease.
Sale With lireat Powers
If the great powers could
actually protect the secrecy of
their BW work I would be much
less alarmed. The chance of BW
ever being used in a major
strategic attack is essentially
negligible in the face of the
nuclear deterrent. The suggestion
that we need BW or CW weapons
for specific retaliatory purposes in
order to deter their use aims at a
ridiculous kind of precision. Will
our deterrent missiles have to
follow the same trajectories as
those that might potentially
attack us? Will they have to be
launched at the same time of day?
Will they have to have the same
mix of explosive energy and
radioactive fallout? If we are
attacked with anthrax strain 827
must we reply with anthrax 827?
On the other hand, if I were a
Machiavellian adviser to a
would-be Hitler I might indeed
advocate a considerable
investment in biological weaponry
as a desperate approach to the
cheap aquisition of great power
even if at a very great risk. And,
of course, the first thing I would
do would be to plant my
intelligence agents in the existing
BW establishments of the
high-budget powers in order to get
the necessary scientific
information at the lowest possible
cost.
However, if I were patient I
would not bother to do even that.
No security system, no
counter-intelligence system in the
world expects more than a delay
of 5 to 10 years in the leakage of
vital information. We do not have,
and I presume do not
contemplate, a security
reservation like war-time Los
Alamos for the containment of
BW research. If a high level
activity is to be maintained there
will be frequent turnover of
personnel. It is unreasonable to
expect a tighter security barrier
here than has prevailed in any
other area, given the problems of
reconciling security with a free
society. Besides these channels for
diffusion of information, there are
also bound to be Pueblo-like
incidents, and finally calculated
leaks in the budget competition of
the services. The American people
might be the last to know. But we
can hardly rely on more than a
ten year delay between many
important discoveries in BW
research laboratories and their
availability to hostile and
irresponsible forces outside.
