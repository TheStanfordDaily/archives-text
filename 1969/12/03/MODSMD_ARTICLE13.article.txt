# Profit Is Their Product
## GE Recruiter Brings War Home 
### Jim Shock 
GE makes lightbulbs. Anyone
who ever watched Ronald Reagan
on the old General Electric
Theatre knows that. Fewer know
that GE also makes war. And, of
course, war profits.
From 1961 to 1967, GE
$7,166,000,000 in war
contracts. Last year, 20% of GE's
$359 million in profits came
directly from war production,
making the company the nation's
third largest defense contractor.
Along with the familiar toasters
and clock radios, GE makes
aircraft machine guns, helicopter
engines, and engines and
equipment for the RF4E, the Air
Force's most advanced
fighter-interceptor.
GE benefits in another
important way from the US war
machine. The massive overseas US
military presence protects the
profits being drawn from GE's
150 foreign branches, located in
countries like South Korea,
Taiwan, Argentina, and South
Africa. GE exploits the labor of
Third World people and supplies
the military with weapons needed
to repress revolutionary
movements that threaten GE and

other US corporate interests in
these same underdeveloped
nations. What more "rational"
system could be devised?
Oppressive Activities
GE's oppressive activities in the
pursuit of profit are by no means
limited to the Third World. In a
very real sense, GE also makes
"war" on American consumers
and workers.
Since 1911, when GE was
convicted of violating the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act by fixing
prices and eliminating
competition in the light bulb
market, the company has been a
defendant in 64 additional
government antitrust cases, 49 of
them in the last ten years. From
1962 to 1964, GE paid over $150
million in damages resulting from
suits filed by electric utility
companies charging GE with
price-fixing.
In addition to victimizing
consumers, GE has a long history
of underpaying its workers. While
the war-produced inflation has
caused the cost of living to
skyrocket (up 5.8% in the last
year), GE workers' wages have not
kept pace. The average wage is
$3.25 per hour or $6,500 per
year. According to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, it now takes in
the Bay Area at least $9,000 per

year for a family of four to live
decently.
Workers Unite
But GE workers are getting
together. 147,000 workers have
for the first time united to strike
GE nationally. Twelve unions
have banded together to demand a
decent standard of living for their
workers. Nixon and the nation's
corporate leaders have agreed that
the way to fight inflation is with
increased unemployment and
wage restraints. The strike at GE
is a test case of Nixon's
anti-working class, anti-inflation
policy .
This, then, is General Electric,
a model multinational
corporation.
To oppose GE's exploitative
operations throughout the world,
students have been joining striking
GE workers on the picket lines in
Oakland and San Jose. In
Berkeley yesterday, 200 students,
including some from Stanford,
joined in a demonstration against
the recruiter who was signing up
technicians and managers for the
GE "team." Tomorrow and
Friday, we get our chance the
recruiter will be at Stanford
conducting interviews at the
Placement Center.
No Oppression Rights
The April Third Movement,

through its words and actions, has
made clear its belief that
American corporate leaders have
no right to oppress the peoples of
the Third World or the citizens of
this country. Specifically, A3M
has acted on its demand that
Stanford University be in no way
complicit in carrying out these
policies. When the GE recruiter
sets foot on campus
we are again obligated to r
Along with high schc »r
college, and university s as
well as members of ca!
community and st GE
workers, we plan to i trate
our opposition to Genera. ,ectric
and the system it represents.
There will be a noon rally at
White Plaza tomorrow to decide
the exact form of the
demonstration.
This is an ideal opportunity for
us to unite our campus struggle
with those of working people
throughout the country. Only
when we recognize that the
anti-war and labor movements
have a common enemy—American
capitalism—will we be able to end
oppression in this country and in
the underdeveloped world. We can
begin to bring these struggles
together tomorrow. Off GE!!

and the system it represents.
There will be a noon rally at
White Plaza tomorrow to decide
the exact form of the
demonstration.
This is an ideal opportunity for
us to unite our campus struggle
with those of working people
throughout the country. Only
when we recognize that the
anti-war and labor movements
have a common enemy—American
capitalism—will we be able to end
oppression in this country and in
the underdeveloped world. We can
begin to bring these struggles
together tomorrow. Off GE!!
(Jim Shoch is a member of the
Stanford SDS.)
GE makes lightbulbs. Anyone
who ever watched Ronald Reagan
on the old General Electric
Theatre knows that. Fewer know
that GE also makes war. And, of
course, war profits.
From 1961 to 1967, GE
$7,166,000,000 in war
contracts. Last year, 20% of GE's
$359 million in profits came
directly from war production,
making the company the nation's
third largest defense contractor.
Along with the familiar toasters
and clock radios, GE makes
aircraft machine guns, helicopter
engines, and engines and
equipment for the RF4E, the Air
Force's most advanced
fighter-interceptor.
GE benefits in another
important way from the US war
machine. The massive overseas US
military presence protects the
profits being drawn from GE's
150 foreign branches, located in
countries like South Korea,
Taiwan, Argentina, and South
Africa. GE exploits the labor of
Third World people and supplies
the military with weapons needed
to repress revolutionary
movements that threaten GE and

other US corporate interests in
these same underdeveloped
nations. What more "rational"
system could be devised?
Oppressive Activities
GE's oppressive activities in the
pursuit of profit are by no means
limited to the Third World. In a
very real sense, GE also makes
"war" on American consumers
and workers.
Since 1911, when GE was
convicted of violating the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act by fixing
prices and eliminating
competition in the light bulb
market, the company has been a
defendant in 64 additional
government antitrust cases, 49 of
them in the last ten years. From
1962 to 1964, GE paid over $150
million in damages resulting from
suits filed by electric utility
companies charging GE with
price-fixing.
In addition to victimizing
consumers, GE has a long history
of underpaying its workers. While
the war-produced inflation has
caused the cost of living to
skyrocket (up 5.8% in the last
year), GE workers' wages have not
kept pace. The average wage is
$3.25 per hour or $6,500 per
year. According to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, it now takes in
the Bay Area at least $9,000 per

year for a family of four to live
decently.
Workers Unite
But GE workers are getting
together. 147,000 workers have
for the first time united to strike
GE nationally. Twelve unions
have banded together to demand a
decent standard of living for their
workers. Nixon and the nation's
corporate leaders have agreed that
the way to fight inflation is with
increased unemployment and
wage restraints. The strike at GE
is a test case of Nixon's
anti-working class, anti-inflation
policy .
This, then, is General Electric,
a model multinational
corporation.
To oppose GE's exploitative
operations throughout the world,
students have been joining striking
GE workers on the picket lines in
Oakland and San Jose. In
Berkeley yesterday, 200 students,
including some from Stanford,
joined in a demonstration against
the recruiter who was signing up
technicians and managers for the
GE "team." Tomorrow and
Friday, we get our chance the
recruiter will be at Stanford
conducting interviews at the
Placement Center.

through its words and actions, has
made clear its belief that
American corporate leaders have
no right to oppress the peoples of
