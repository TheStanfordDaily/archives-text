# Meissner Masters On Display; Style Spectrum Exhibit-Wide
## 
### BONNIE KOEHLER 
Eigiity-eight drawings by
European masters are featured in
the current exhibit at the
Stanford Art Gallery. The works,
dating from the fifteenth to the
nineteenth centuries, are on loan
from the Zurich collection of
Kurt Meissner and will be on
display until Sunday, December
14.
This major exhibition is the
first touring show of this scope to
begin its United States tour at the
Stanford Art Gallery. From here
it will go to the Detroit Institute
of Arts, and then the Finch
College Museum of Art, New
York, in April.
Dr. Francoise Forster -Hahn,
curator of the Stanford Art
Museum since February 1968, was
fortunate to acquire the rare
drawings on loan from Kurt
Meissner, a well known European
art dealer. Meissner has a private
collection of over 300 drawings
that he has been assembling for 30
years. Dr. Forster-Hahn selected
and organized the 88 drawings for
the traveling exhibition from the
larger collection herself last
winter. She and her husband

researched and catalogued the
exhibit in the spring and summer.
In all exhibitions of this nature
each work is extensively
researched to be sure it is
attributed to the correct artist and
is authentic, before it goes on
display. In the process Dr.
Forste-Hahn and her husband
were able to make new discoveries
in linking these drawings to other
existing works by the artist.
The exhibit includes drawings
by artists representing six
countries. They encompass a wide
spectrum of graphic media, color,
subject matter, purpose, depth,
mood, style, and even size.
Depth of Quality
Each work is fascinating. The
exhibit has an unusual depth of
quality. The drawings are
beautiful of themselves as well as
historically enlightening.
They are intimiate in that the
hand of the artist is evident in
each of the works. They capture a
quality of spontaneity and reveal
something of the thinking process
of the artist. They contain
qualities not usually seen in other
such complete works as the oil

paintings produced by these
masters. Looking at some of the
drawings is almost like glimpsing
into the artists' diary.
Only the fine watercolor
landscapes from the Netherland
group, signed and dated by the
artists, were ever intended to be
seen as finished products. Others,
from artists of Germany, France,
Switzerland, Italy and Spain, are
sketches made in preparation for
oil paintings, details from larger
works, or private studies.
The fascinating frames are an
integral part of the exhibit.
Meissner selects each frame for
the drawings from the same
period. The original weathered
and waterstained papers also
enhance the mood. The papers are
in shades of brown, yellow, grey,
and blue. The drawings are done
in orange, brown and black ink,
graphite, reddish and white chalk
and sheads of watercolor wash.
Wide Spectrum of Studies
The first drawing the viewer
sees upon entering the Gallery is
the dramatic red chalk study,
Head of a Woman by
Jean-Baptiste Greuze (18th
century). It is a preparatory study
for a larger painting, but very
evocative by itself.
Tintoretto's precise chalk
Studies After Michelangelo's
Sampson, is an example of a
private study not intended by the
artist for exhibition. The unsigned
work is a drawing made from a
Michelangelo sculpture; an artist
learning art from art.
The rapid impressionistic
penstrokes of Guercino's

Madonna and Child seem unusual
in their freedom and vigor for the
17 th century. The work is a
contrast in style to the careful ink
lines juxtaposed in Girolamo
Muziano's Mountainous
Landscape with Waterfall.
One of the collections pleasant
surprises is the tiny Nobleman and
His Page with Halberd by Jusepe
De Ribera. The ink sketch,
measuring about 4 by 6 inches, is
the drawing reproduced and
blown up to 2 by 3 feet for the
exhibitions posters. This
successful change in scale is surely
testimony to the drawing's
draughtsmanship and depth of
quality. 1 enjoy the drawing also
because the subject suggests
Cervantes' Don Quixote.
Timeless Drawings
Peter Paul Rubens is
represented in the collection by
his candid Head of Pan Sticking
Out His Tongue. The Watteau
works, are a black chalk landscape
and red chalk Study of a Tree
Stump.
Raphael's tiny Head of Putto is
one of the collections "jewels."
Two Dutch recent acquisitions
to the Meissner collection,
Winter' ? with Windmill and
Winl '.7 th century), by
Abrah Jemaker, are crisp in
their d« • >d suggest European
Christma scenes.
The t s drawings appeal
to a wiat audience. Everyone
viewing the exhibit will select his
own favorites. This is an excellent
exhibit and one of the better
things to come to Stanford this
year. A visit to the Old Masters
Drawing is an excursion through
Europe, a window in history, and
a rich and peaceful afternoon.


Collection of Kurt Meissner, Zurich
