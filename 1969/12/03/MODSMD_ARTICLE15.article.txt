# 'Androcles' Director
## Carey: Grandfather Figure 
### 
White-haired and half Irish,
Denis Carey is more like a
grandfather figure than a
traditional director to the actors
of the Stanford Repertory
Theater.
In his few months here, Carey
has impressed the cast, which
debuts tonight in his production
of "Androcles and the Lion,"
with his sense of concern. "He
weaves an intensely personal web
around each member of the cast.
We are very close to him," says
Will Rogers, who plays the
Captain in the play.
Carey is very hopef bout
"the emergency of a new <Tica
about which I care desp ly."
He sees. America as a ntier
country, and "now that ntier
belongs to the young people
During the Citober 15
Moratorium, he joined a student
group dramatizing the anti-war
feeling. "I've known war all my
life," he says,"and it's futile."
