# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Christmas Shopping 
### TERRY RUSTIN (First in a three-part series) 
The sun is still shining, and
Christmas is coming, bringing all
its joyous commercial delights. If
you or your friends like music, or
want to impress people who do,
there is no better holiday
purchase than a complete sound
system.
Even if you can't afford to buy
one, you might be able to buy
part of it and dream about the
rest. Here's a beautiful, not
overly-expensive system that you
can easily work up to, a system
that will satisfy you for many
years to come.
Shopping for sound is as
potentially dangerous as shopping
for anything else, and even though
the salesman seems hip, he still
gets paid by commission. So get
some impartial advice first from
several sources, decide on a
budget and future expansion,
portability problems and where
the set will go—and then march
down to the store.
Coin pon on Is
A complete sound
reproduction system can consist
of: turntable or record changer,
cartridge and stylus, tape deck or
tape recorder, tuner, amplifier,
speakers and headphones.
The two most delicate
members of this team, the two
which must be chosen the most
carefully, are the cartridge and the
speakers. The cartridge converts
the vibrations of the stylus in the
record groove into
electro-magnetic vibrations; the
speakers (and headphones)
transform these electro-magnetic
waves into sound waves in tbe air.
Intuitively, these are the two
places where poor quality will
degrade the ultimate sound the
most.
This is part of the reason for
preferring components to an
all-in-one set with turntable,
amplifier, speakers and radio all in
one unit. The manufacturer tends
to compromise in the area of
greatest expense—cartridge and
speakers—so that you may find
yourself with a competent
amplifier but gravelly sound.
Furthermore, should you
someday choose to buy better
speakers (and better ones are
being invented all the time), you
need not throw the whole set
away and start over.
Speakers
Acoustic Research (AR) makes
the best speakers today. In an area
where decision is usually based on
opinion, that statement comes as
near to fact as any that can be
made. AR pioneered the
development of the acoustic
suspension principle which
allowed big sound to come from
small boxes, sound which is closer
to "live" performance (classical,
jazz, rock, everything) than that
from any other type of speaker.
Acoustic suspension speakers
are replacing the old bass reflex
variety which employed the
natural resonance of a tube to
amplify the low notes. This causes
the tones in the low-frequency
rnage (50 to 150 cycles per
second) to be heard as a low
rumble, no one note

distinguishable from any other.
The bass tended to "boom" also,
since the resonating tube vibrates
more and more as bass notes
continue to be played.
These problems are eliminated
in the acoustic suspension design.
The quality engineering of AR
speakers produces clean tones to
the limits of audibility.
AR's pay for their fine
response by decreased efficiency.
This means that considerable
power (measured in watts) is
required to "push" them. The
sound is produced by the

vibration of the voice coil in a
strong magnetic field, and the
longer excursion made by the
voice coil and the larger the
magnet (other things being equal),
the more true will be the sound.
But this requires power, and the
power is provided by the
amplifier. The choice of amplifier,
therefore, depends largely on the
choice of speakers—which is why
we look at speakers first.
4, 2, 5, 3
AR makes four basic speaker
models, ranging in price from the
$58 each of the AR-4x to the
$'240 each of the fabulous AR-3a,
probably the finest speaker
available under four figures. In
between are the AR-2 and the
AR-5, the differences in price
reflecting the different tweeters
(speakers responding to high
notes) and woofers (those
producing low notes) used in each
speaker box (each of which
contains two or three separate
speakers). The high-priced boxes
are magnificent, of course, and are
nice to listen to in the showroom,
but when it comes to laying out
the bread, the AR-4x's give the
most for the money by far. You
would have to pay twenty or
thirty dollars more in another
brand for the same quality, and
then you would not be getting the
long-lasting quality of an AR
speaker.
The first item on our shopping
list: a pair of AR-4x speakers,
$116.

AR makes four basic speaker
models, ranging in price from the
$58 each of the AR-4x to the
$'240 each of the fabulous AR-3a,
probably the finest speaker
available under four figures. In
between are the AR-2 and the
AR-5, the differences in price
reflecting the different tweeters
(speakers responding to high
notes) and woofers (those
producing low notes) used in each
speaker box (each of which
contains two or three separate
speakers). The high-priced boxes
are magnificent, of course, and are
nice to listen to in the showroom,
but when it comes to laying out
the bread, the AR-4x's give the
most for the money by far. You
would have to pay twenty or
thirty dollars more in another
brand for the same quality, and
then you would not be getting the
long-lasting quality of an AR
speaker.
The first item on our shopping
list: a pair of AR-4x speakers,
$116.

The sun is still shining, and
Christmas is coming, bringing all
its joyous commercial delights. If
you or your friends like music, or
want to impress people who do,
there is no better holiday
purchase than a complete sound
system.
Even if you can't afford to buy
one, you might be able to buy
part of it and dream about the
rest. Here's a beautiful, not
overly-expensive system that you
can easily work up to, a system
that will satisfy you for many
years to come.
Shopping for sound is as
potentially dangerous as shopping
for anything else, and even though
the salesman seems hip, he still
gets paid by commission. So get
some impartial advice first from
several sources, decide on a
budget and future expansion,
portability problems and where
the set will go—and then march
down to the store.

A complete sound
reproduction system can consist
of: turntable or record changer,
cartridge and stylus, tape deck or
tape recorder, tuner, amplifier,
speakers and headphones.
The two most delicate
members of this team, the two
which must be chosen the most
carefully, are the cartridge and the
speakers. The cartridge converts
the vibrations of the stylus in the
record groove into
electro-magnetic vibrations; the
speakers (and headphones)
transform these electro-magnetic
waves into sound waves in tbe air.
Intuitively, these are the two
places where poor quality will
degrade the ultimate sound the
most.
This is part of the reason for
preferring components to an
all-in-one set with turntable,
amplifier, speakers and radio all in
one unit. The manufacturer tends
to compromise in the area of
greatest expense—cartridge and
speakers—so that you may find
yourself with a competent
amplifier but gravelly sound.
Furthermore, should you
someday choose to buy better
speakers (and better ones are
being invented all the time), you
need not throw the whole set
away and start over.

Acoustic Research (AR) makes
the best speakers today. In an area
where decision is usually based on
opinion, that statement comes as
near to fact as any that can be
made. AR pioneered the
development of the acoustic
suspension principle which
allowed big sound to come from
small boxes, sound which is closer
to "live" performance (classical,
jazz, rock, everything) than that
from any other type of speaker.
Acoustic suspension speakers
are replacing the old bass reflex
variety which employed the
natural resonance of a tube to
amplify the low notes. This causes
the tones in the low-frequency
rnage (50 to 150 cycles per
second) to be heard as a low
rumble, no one note

distinguishable from any other.
The bass tended to "boom" also,
since the resonating tube vibrates
more and more as bass notes
continue to be played.
These problems are eliminated
in the acoustic suspension design.

the vibrations of the stylus in the
record groove into
electro-magnetic vibrations; the
speakers (and headphones)
transform these electro-magnetic
waves into sound waves in tbe air.
Intuitively, these are the two
places where poor quality will
degrade the ultimate sound the
most.
This is part of the reason for
preferring components to an
all-in-one set with turntable,
amplifier, speakers and radio all in
one unit. The manufacturer tends
to compromise in the area of
greatest expense—cartridge and
speakers—so that you may find
yourself with a competent
amplifier but gravelly sound.
Furthermore, should you
someday choose to buy better
speakers (and better ones are
being invented all the time), you
need not throw the whole set
away and start over.
Speakers
Acoustic Research (AR) makes
the best speakers today. In an area
where decision is usually based on
opinion, that statement comes as
near to fact as any that can be
made. AR pioneered the
development of the acoustic
suspension principle which
allowed big sound to come from
small boxes, sound which is closer
to "live" performance (classical,
jazz, rock, everything) than that
from any other type of speaker.
Acoustic suspension speakers
are replacing the old bass reflex
variety which employed the
natural resonance of a tube to
amplify the low notes. This causes
the tones in the low-frequency
rnage (50 to 150 cycles per
second) to be heard as a low
rumble, no one note

distinguishable from any other.
The bass tended to "boom" also,
since the resonating tube vibrates
more and more as bass notes
continue to be played.
These problems are eliminated
in the acoustic suspension design.
The quality engineering of AR
speakers produces clean tones to
the limits of audibility.
AR's pay for their fine
response by decreased efficiency.
This means that considerable
power (measured in watts) is
required to "push" them. The
sound is produced by the

vibration of the voice coil in a
strong magnetic field, and the
longer excursion made by the
voice coil and the larger the
magnet (other things being equal),
the more true will be the sound.
But this requires power, and the
power is provided by the
amplifier. The choice of amplifier,
therefore, depends largely on the
choice of speakers—which is why
we look at speakers first.
4, 2, 5, 3
AR makes four basic speaker
models, ranging in price from the
$58 each of the AR-4x to the
$'240 each of the fabulous AR-3a,
probably the finest speaker
available under four figures. In
between are the AR-2 and the
AR-5, the differences in price
reflecting the different tweeters
(speakers responding to high
notes) and woofers (those
producing low notes) used in each
speaker box (each of which
contains two or three separate
speakers). The high-priced boxes
are magnificent, of course, and are
nice to listen to in the showroom,
but when it comes to laying out
the bread, the AR-4x's give the
most for the money by far. You
would have to pay twenty or
thirty dollars more in another
brand for the same quality, and
then you would not be getting the
long-lasting quality of an AR
speaker.
The first item on our shopping
list: a pair of AR-4x speakers,
$116.
