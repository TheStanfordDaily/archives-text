# For What It's Worth
## The 						Dead Awake 
### CRAIG OKINO 
The good Ol' Grateful Dead,
after wading through enormous
piles of bullshit, have finally put
out their double live album (with
virtually no help from Warner
Brothers), after a delay of four
months. It goes without saying
that Live/Dead (Warner Bros.
1830) is their best album yet; it
transcends any mere value
judgements ony might have. You
just listen to it, shake your head
in wonder, and mutter to
yourself, "the Dead, the Dead, the
Dead .
Ever since the beginning, while
other bands have had more
national success (the Airplane, Big
Brother), the Dead have always
been the San Francisco band.
While other groups have broken
up or changed because of internal
hassles, the Dead have added two
more members, Hart and
Constanten. And today, as most
of the third wave San Francisco
bands flood the ballrooms with
boring, imitative music, the
Dead's originality and brilliance
stand out even more.
The album is a
masterpiece—excellent cover

artwork and inner leaflet with the
words to the songs, and a
masterful job of mixing by the
Dead, the best quality for a live
album I've heard.
Continuous Sides
The first three sides of
Live/Dead were actually
performed continuously. The
Dead are very successful in
creating a steady flow of
extremely satisfying music, and
within this stream is constant
interaction, always with the
rhythmic undercurrent of the two
percussionists, Hart and
Kreutzmann; Phil Lesh's bass
behaving like a second lead quitar.
It begins with Jerry Garcia's
muted guitar, demonstrating his
ability to let the notes ooze out of
the strings. Midway through the
flow, Hart crashes the gong
behind the vocals (which are
fantastic throughout) —"Dark star
crashes/Pouring its light into
ashes/Reason tatters/The forces
tear loose from the axis." It's so
easy to get lost in this
music . . . and Garcia's quivering
vocals fit "Dark Star" (and
"Death" on the fourth side)
perfectly.
"Saint Stephen," which begins
the second side, comes off much
better than the Aoxomoxoa
version, partially because when
done live, Bob Weir sings lower
voice, whereas in the studio
Garcia overdubbed both parts.
"Talk about your plenty/Talk
about your ills/One man gathers
what another man spills." It
blends into "The Eleven," a Lesh
tune.
Pig Pen's Moment
Then comes Pig Pen's big
moment: ever since the Dead's
first album, Mr. McKernan has
stepped further from the
spotlight, and during
performances he stands in a
corner playing inaudible conga,
but this was a matter of personal
choice —he never has considered
himself a musician. The Dead have
left the rhythm and blues stage far
behind, and Pig Pen with it.
But they still do a tune like
"Lovelight," and do it well,
Garcia's guitar as funky and fast
as ever, Pig Pen working it out,
joined by Lesh and Weir in the
third chorus. It is simply another
musical vehicle for the Dead, just
as the slow blues by Rev. Gary
Davis, "Death Don't Have No
Mercy," the electronic feedback,
and the "Bid You Goodnight"
hymn on the fourth side are.
Nuff said. Buy the album and
listen to it. You'll see why Bill
Graham introduces the Dead as
"the greatest rock'n'roll band in
the world."

listen to it. You'll see why Bill
Graham introduces the Dead as
"the greatest rock'n'roll band in
the world."
The good Ol' Grateful Dead,
after wading through enormous
piles of bullshit, have finally put
out their double live album (with
virtually no help from Warner
Brothers), after a delay of four
months. It goes without saying
that Live/Dead (Warner Bros.
1830) is their best album yet; it
transcends any mere value
judgements ony might have. You
just listen to it, shake your head
in wonder, and mutter to
yourself, "the Dead, the Dead, the
Dead .
Ever since the beginning, while
other bands have had more
national success (the Airplane, Big
Brother), the Dead have always
been the San Francisco band.
While other groups have broken
up or changed because of internal
hassles, the Dead have added two
more members, Hart and
Constanten. And today, as most
of the third wave San Francisco
bands flood the ballrooms with
boring, imitative music, the
Dead's originality and brilliance
stand out even more.
The album is a
masterpiece—excellent cover

artwork and inner leaflet with the
words to the songs, and a
masterful job of mixing by the
Dead, the best quality for a live
album I've heard.
Continuous Sides
The first three sides of
Live/Dead were actually
performed continuously. The
Dead are very successful in
creating a steady flow of
extremely satisfying music, and
within this stream is constant
interaction, always with the
rhythmic undercurrent of the two
percussionists, Hart and
Kreutzmann; Phil Lesh's bass
behaving like a second lead quitar.
It begins with Jerry Garcia's
muted guitar, demonstrating his
ability to let the notes ooze out of
the strings. Midway through the
flow, Hart crashes the gong
behind the vocals (which are
fantastic throughout) —"Dark star
crashes/Pouring its light into
ashes/Reason tatters/The forces
tear loose from the axis." It's so
easy to get lost in this
music . . . and Garcia's quivering
vocals fit "Dark Star" (and
"Death" on the fourth side)
perfectly.
"Saint Stephen," which begins
the second side, comes off much
better than the Aoxomoxoa
version, partially because when
done live, Bob Weir sings lower
voice, whereas in the studio
Garcia overdubbed both parts.
"Talk about your plenty/Talk
about your ills/One man gathers
what another man spills." It
blends into "The Eleven," a Lesh
tune.
Pig Pen's Moment
Then comes Pig Pen's big
moment: ever since the Dead's
first album, Mr. McKernan has
stepped further from the
spotlight, and during
performances he stands in a
corner playing inaudible conga,
but this was a matter of personal
choice —he never has considered
himself a musician. The Dead have
left the rhythm and blues stage far
behind, and Pig Pen with it.
But they still do a tune like
"Lovelight," and do it well,
Garcia's guitar as funky and fast
as ever, Pig Pen working it out,
joined by Lesh and Weir in the
third chorus. It is simply another
musical vehicle for the Dead, just
as the slow blues by Rev. Gary
Davis, "Death Don't Have No
Mercy," the electronic feedback,
and the "Bid You Goodnight"
hymn on the fourth side are.
Nuff said. Buy the album and
listen to it. You'll see why Bill
