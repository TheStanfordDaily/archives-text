# 'Androcles' To Open
## 
### 
The Stanford Repertory
Theater ushers in the Christmas
season with flower power and
psychedelia in Bernard
Shaw's fable play for all ages,
"Androcles and the Lion,"
opening Dec. 3 for a three-week
run in Memorial Auditorium.
Performances are scheduled for
8 p.m. Dec. 3-6, 10-13, and 19-20
with matinees at 2, Dec. 6 and 13.
"Androcles and the Lion" is
based on the classic tale of a meek
but kindly tailor, Androcles, who
befriends a lion by pulling a giant
thorn from its paw. In Rome,
when Androcles is thrown to the
lions for being a Christian, the
lion he helped rufuses to eat him.
Shaw wrote this comedy as a
Christmas pantomime, a
traditional English entertainment
for the holidays. Full of spectacle,
music, farce, and pure fun, the
play has attracted audiences of all
ages. "It is a delightful
entertainment for children which
nevertheless contains matter for
the most mature wisdom to
ponder," explained Shaw.
In conjunction with the
December 6 performance of the
play, the Stanford Repertory
Theater is sponsoring a "Dinner
with the Director" program. The
SRT volunteers will host the
dinner.
Director Denis Carey, who
comes to Stanford with a
distinguished record of
accomplishments as an actor and
director in Great Britain, Canada,
Belgium, Yugoslavia, and the U.S.,
will speak about the play after the
steak dinner. Carey calls
"Androcles and the Lion" "an
irrestible parable for today" and
sees the early Christians' struggle
with the oppressive Roman
government as similar to today's
youth revolt.
An open host bar at 5 p.m.
with dinner at 6 is planned. The
public is invited to make
reservations at the SRT box office
before Nov. 28.
