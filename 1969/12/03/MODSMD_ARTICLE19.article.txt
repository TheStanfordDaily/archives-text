# Council Planned
## Reagan Meets Students 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
SACRAMENTO-Governor
Ronald Reagan and about 50
student leaders concluded their
second round of meetings late
Monday afternoon, indicating that
plans are nearly complete to form
a permanent student advisory
council.
"My own reply was I'd he
delighted," the governor told
newsmen afterward. He added, "I
call it good citizenship."
The two and one-half hour
session with representatives of
four University of California (UC)
schools and fourteen state colleges
was closed to the Capitol press
corps. The atmosphere inside the
Governor's press conference room
was cordial and businesslike, or
"free swinging" as Reagan termed
it.
Matt Maser, student
representative from UCLA noted,
"He has some very delicate
nerves . . .But he's trying and so
are we. And that is all we can
ask."
Bob Sandoval the student
body president from Cal State at
Fullerton, added, "We don't
understand each other all the
time. There were a few cases when
there were heated discussions."
A particularly delicate point
with the Governor was touched
when Dave Hubin, the student
body president from UC Davis,
accused Reagan of being against
higher education.
Hubin said that the UC student
body presidents want to make
sure that Reagan is not involved
politically in campus affairs. He
further asked that Reagan limit
his involvement on the Board of
Regents to an honorary,
non-voting position.
In a heated reply, Reagan
insisted that these sorts of charges
made communication difficult.
Despite all the claims that he
has injected politics into the UC

system, he challenged his critics to
give one specific instance of
breach of faith on his part. He
noted that the state constitution
requires not only that he be a
Regent, but that he chair all
meetings.
Since his election as Governor
three years ago, Reagan
continued, lie had never taken the
gavel at any meeting. And this was
stretching the law quite a bit, he
said.
Switching to the offensive, he
detailed examples of politics being
used against him.
One Regent appointed by
former Democratic Governor
Edmond G. "Pat" Brown was
active in forming faculty
committees against him in the
1966 campaign, Reagan charged.
He further claimed that
student newspapers on the UC
Campuses are only giving one side
of the issue. The Governor told
Hubin that he'd never seen the
student body presidents speak out
against this one-sidedness, and
that he had never been called by
student newspapers to let him
explain his positions.
Hubin, who walked out with
the school's newspaper editor
Bruce Daily, told the press that
Reagan was allowing students to
present their ideas on education
spending so that he could play
them off against the faculty.
"He is using it as a way to
further cut budgets," Hubin said.
"The basic thing is that I don't
trust the man," Daily added.
Reagan replied in his press
conference later that he had
assured students present, "Not
only would I not use any of it for
political purposes, but I said if
any of them tried to use it for
political purposes I'd walk away
and leave them."
Working with a series of 12
proposals made November 20 in
Los Angeles, students

concentrated on the proposal that
Reagan "accept some form of
student advisory council on an
informal basis to meet with him
regularly without administration
and faculty."
The original concern of
students, loosely banded together
under the title of the Student
Audit Committee, was that they
be given some voice in
considerations of tuition and
budget cuts.
Since that time, discussions
with the Governor appear to have
convinced students that there is a
need for an ongoing and
permanent structure for direct
communication.
One student humorously noted
that direct communication aids in
understanding, if only to
demonstrate that the Governor
doesn't wear guns.
Monday's proposal insisted
that the council "must not come
under the direction, control, or
influence of the Department of
Education or the Governor's
educational advisors." Education
Department head Max Rafferty
seems to draw even more
antagonism from students than
Reagan.
The realm of possible
discussion topics, based on the
past two meetings, is almost
endless.
Reagan closed out Monday's
meeting by saying that he would
be more than happy to discuss
what one student called
"para-military forces being
ordered on our campus."
Another big issue appears to be
the Educational Opportunities
Program (EOP), which provides
underprivileged students with
economic aid to attend college.
Students claim that it should
be the number one priority for
the state colleges. However, a
priority listing for the state
college system, which Cal State
Fullerton's Sandoval claims he got
through his "spies," lists EOP as
number 16.
A final unanswered question is
whether Reagan will show up on
any campus. Since his election,
the Governor admitted Monday,
he has been afraid to speak on any
campus for fear that he would
start a riot.
Jim Gillete, student body
president at Sonoma State,
personally assured him that this
wouldn't happen on his campus.
The invitation was left open.

delighted," the governor told
newsmen afterward. He added, "I
call it good citizenship."
The two and one-half hour
session with representatives of
four University of California (UC)
schools and fourteen state colleges
was closed to the Capitol press
corps. The atmosphere inside the
Governor's press conference room
was cordial and businesslike, or
"free swinging" as Reagan termed
it.
Matt Maser, student
representative from UCLA noted,
"He has some very delicate
nerves . . .But he's trying and so
are we. And that is all we can
ask."
Bob Sandoval the student
body president from Cal State at
Fullerton, added, "We don't
understand each other all the
time. There were a few cases when
there were heated discussions."
A particularly delicate point
with the Governor was touched
when Dave Hubin, the student
body president from UC Davis,
accused Reagan of being against
higher education.
Hubin said that the UC student
body presidents want to make
sure that Reagan is not involved
politically in campus affairs. He
further asked that Reagan limit
his involvement on the Board of
Regents to an honorary,
non-voting position.
In a heated reply, Reagan
insisted that these sorts of charges
made communication difficult.
Despite all the claims that he
has injected politics into the UC

system, he challenged his critics to
give one specific instance of
breach of faith on his part. He
noted that the state constitution
requires not only that he be a
Regent, but that he chair all
meetings.
Since his election as Governor
three years ago, Reagan
continued, lie had never taken the
gavel at any meeting. And this was
stretching the law quite a bit, he
said.
Switching to the offensive, he
detailed examples of politics being
used against him.
One Regent appointed by
former Democratic Governor
Edmond G. "Pat" Brown was
active in forming faculty
committees against him in the
1966 campaign, Reagan charged.
He further claimed that
student newspapers on the UC
Campuses are only giving one side
of the issue. The Governor told
Hubin that he'd never seen the
student body presidents speak out
against this one-sidedness, and
that he had never been called by
student newspapers to let him
explain his positions.
Hubin, who walked out with
the school's newspaper editor
Bruce Daily, told the press that
Reagan was allowing students to
present their ideas on education
spending so that he could play
them off against the faculty.
"He is using it as a way to
further cut budgets," Hubin said.
"The basic thing is that I don't
trust the man," Daily added.
Reagan replied in his press
conference later that he had
assured students present, "Not
only would I not use any of it for
political purposes, but I said if
any of them tried to use it for
political purposes I'd walk away
and leave them."
Working with a series of 12
proposals made November 20 in
Los Angeles, students

concentrated on the proposal that
Reagan "accept some form of
student advisory council on an
informal basis to meet with him
regularly without administration
and faculty."
The original concern of
students, loosely banded together
under the title of the Student
Audit Committee, was that they
be given some voice in
considerations of tuition and
budget cuts.
Since that time, discussions
with the Governor appear to have
convinced students that there is a
need for an ongoing and
permanent structure for direct
communication.
One student humorously noted
that direct communication aids in
understanding, if only to
demonstrate that the Governor
doesn't wear guns.
Monday's proposal insisted
that the council "must not come
under the direction, control, or
influence of the Department of
Education or the Governor's
educational advisors." Education
Department head Max Rafferty
seems to draw even more
antagonism from students than
Reagan.
The realm of possible
discussion topics, based on the
past two meetings, is almost
endless.
Reagan closed out Monday's
meeting by saying that he would
be more than happy to discuss
what one student called
"para-military forces being
ordered on our campus."
Another big issue appears to be
the Educational Opportunities
Program (EOP), which provides
underprivileged students with
economic aid to attend college.
Students claim that it should
be the number one priority for
the state colleges. However, a
priority listing for the state
college system, which Cal State
Fullerton's Sandoval claims he got
through his "spies," lists EOP as
number 16.
A final unanswered question is
whether Reagan will show up on
any campus. Since his election,
the Governor admitted Monday,
he has been afraid to speak on any
campus for fear that he would
start a riot.
Jim Gillete, student body
president at Sonoma State,
personally assured him that this
wouldn't happen on his campus.
The invitation was left open.

Ronald Reagan and about 50

plans are nearly complete to form

Governor's press conference room
was cordial and businesslike, or
"free swinging" as Reagan termed
it.
Matt Maser, student
representative from UCLA noted,
"He has some very delicate
nerves . . .But he's trying and so
are we. And that is all we can
ask."
Bob Sandoval the student
body president from Cal State at
Fullerton, added, "We don't
understand each other all the
time. There were a few cases when
there were heated discussions."
A particularly delicate point
with the Governor was touched
when Dave Hubin, the student
body president from UC Davis,
accused Reagan of being against
higher education.
Hubin said that the UC student
body presidents want to make
sure that Reagan is not involved
politically in campus affairs. He
further asked that Reagan limit
his involvement on the Board of
Regents to an honorary,
non-voting position.
In a heated reply, Reagan
insisted that these sorts of charges
made communication difficult.
Despite all the claims that he
has injected politics into the UC

system, he challenged his critics to
give one specific instance of
breach of faith on his part. He
noted that the state constitution
requires not only that he be a
Regent, but that he chair all
meetings.
Since his election as Governor
three years ago, Reagan
continued, lie had never taken the
gavel at any meeting. And this was
stretching the law quite a bit, he
said.
Switching to the offensive, he
detailed examples of politics being
used against him.
One Regent appointed by
former Democratic Governor
Edmond G. "Pat" Brown was
active in forming faculty
committees against him in the
1966 campaign, Reagan charged.
He further claimed that
student newspapers on the UC
Campuses are only giving one side
of the issue. The Governor told
Hubin that he'd never seen the
student body presidents speak out
against this one-sidedness, and
that he had never been called by
student newspapers to let him
explain his positions.
Hubin, who walked out with
the school's newspaper editor
Bruce Daily, told the press that
Reagan was allowing students to
present their ideas on education
spending so that he could play
them off against the faculty.
"He is using it as a way to
further cut budgets," Hubin said.
"The basic thing is that I don't
trust the man," Daily added.
Reagan replied in his press
conference later that he had
assured students present, "Not
only would I not use any of it for
political purposes, but I said if
any of them tried to use it for
political purposes I'd walk away
and leave them."
Working with a series of 12
proposals made November 20 in
Los Angeles, students

concentrated on the proposal that
Reagan "accept some form of
student advisory council on an
informal basis to meet with him
regularly without administration
and faculty."
The original concern of
students, loosely banded together
under the title of the Student
Audit Committee, was that they
be given some voice in
considerations of tuition and
budget cuts.
Since that time, discussions
with the Governor appear to have
convinced students that there is a
need for an ongoing and
permanent structure for direct
communication.
One student humorously noted
that direct communication aids in
understanding, if only to
demonstrate that the Governor
doesn't wear guns.
Monday's proposal insisted
that the council "must not come
under the direction, control, or
influence of the Department of
Education or the Governor's
educational advisors." Education
Department head Max Rafferty
seems to draw even more
antagonism from students than
Reagan.
The realm of possible
discussion topics, based on the
past two meetings, is almost
endless.
Reagan closed out Monday's
meeting by saying that he would
be more than happy to discuss
what one student called
"para-military forces being
ordered on our campus."
Another big issue appears to be
the Educational Opportunities
Program (EOP), which provides
underprivileged students with
economic aid to attend college.
Students claim that it should
be the number one priority for
the state colleges. However, a
priority listing for the state
college system, which Cal State
Fullerton's Sandoval claims he got
through his "spies," lists EOP as
number 16.
A final unanswered question is
whether Reagan will show up on
any campus. Since his election,
the Governor admitted Monday,
he has been afraid to speak on any
campus for fear that he would
start a riot.
Jim Gillete, student body
president at Sonoma State,
personally assured him that this
wouldn't happen on his campus.
The invitation was left open.
SACRAMENTO-Governor
Ronald Reagan and about 50
student leaders concluded their
second round of meetings late
Monday afternoon, indicating that
plans are nearly complete to form
a permanent student advisory
council.
"My own reply was I'd he
delighted," the governor told
newsmen afterward. He added, "I
call it good citizenship."
The two and one-half hour
session with representatives of
four University of California (UC)
schools and fourteen state colleges
was closed to the Capitol press
corps. The atmosphere inside the
