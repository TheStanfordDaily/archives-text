# SDS May Picket
## GE To Recruit As Planned 
### 
In spite of SDS demands that
the University not allow
representatives of General Electric
to recruit on campus, there will be
no changes in job interview
schedules, according to Ralph
Keller, director of the Placement
Center.
SDS voted Monday night to
demand that President Kenneth
Pitzer not permit GE to recruit on
campus and promised to
"interfere in whatever way seems

appropriate" with recruiting
tomorrow and Friday.
Administration officials had no
immediate response since a copy
of the SDS demands arrived late
yesterday afternoon. A news
release from the University News
Service stated, "Stanford has an
open recruiting policy." l
Spring Injunction
Jeff Littleboy of the news
service told the Palo Alto Times
yesterday that a permanent
injunction granted during last

spring's Encina sit-in against
persons disrupting campus
activities is still in effect.
In the letter to Pitzer, SDS
stated that allowing "recruitment
of potential strikebreakers . . .con
stitutes material opposition to the
strike." The letter also attacked
GE "as a political corporation
with immense power (that) plays
a reactionary role in American
policy formation."
SDS demanded that "GE
management not be allowed to

recruit on campus" and
additionally "that a representative
of the university administration"
answer the demands at a noon
rally tomorrow in White Plaza.
Sign ups Down
Placement Center director
Keller stated that 13 students
have signed up so far for
interviews tomorrow and none for
Friday. When a GE recruiter was
here Nov. 17, he interviewed 51
students.
At that time the news service
reported about two dozen
participated in a SDS picket line
at the Placement Office.
Over a year and a half ago
Provost Ricahrd Lyman refused a
similar demand from SDS to
refuse Dow Chemical recruiters on
campus.
The recruiters come to
Stanford tomorrow after a hectic
stay at the University of
California at Berkeley. About 200
campus supporters of GE strikers
picketed the Berkeley Placement
Center yesterday.
Early in the day a tear gas
grenade was thrown into the
building, forcing evacuation for
most of the morning.
Arleigh Williams, dean of
students, said recruiting interviews
were continued after most of the
gas had cleared.
The pickets marched to the
center from a Sproul Plaza noon
rally where Roger Fuller, United
Electrical Workers union steward,
called for unity between students
and workers after as well as during
the strike.
At the center, the pickets
dispersed after an hour. No arrests
were made, as the identity of the
gas grenade thrower was not
known.
A dozen police stood by during
the picketing of the placement
center. Two campus policemen
were treated for tear gas
inhalation during the morning's
escapades.
