# Diverse, Powerful Organization
## ASSU: Students or Monolith? 
### KATHY STEPHENSON 
"Which ASSU?" "Doesn't it
provide those charter flights?"
''Let me see... the
Associated. . . Stanford . . . Student
Union'." "A blank." "It's the
Senate and I don't know what else
they have!" "I haven't thought a
whole lot about it, to tell you the
truth."
These are just a sample of
student responses to the
question—"What is the ASSU?"
Most students would be shocked
to learn that they are the ASSU,
the "Associated Students of
Stanford University," a viable and
vital organization composed of
undergraduate and graduate
students, extending to all sectors
of campus activity.
Last year, the Associated
Students of Stanford University
elected a very new and innovative
student government, headed by a
unique Council of Presidents, with
a revised Constitution and a new
legislative body. The ASSU has a
new look, and this is a critical
year of transition and change in
student government.
But what does the Council of
Presidents see as the role of the
ASSU? Council member John
Grube notes, "Until three years
ago, student government was just
a sandbox activity. Student
government is now playing a
critical role in the decision-making
process of the University,
principally through student
participatio on University
Standing Committees, Trustee
Committees, and Committees of
the Academic Senate. The ASSU
exists for two basic reasons: 1) to
insure and represent the
expression of student interests in
University government, and 2) to
provide student services."
Strengthens Communication
The ASSU is trying to
strengthen channels of
communication within the
University by lobbying for more
student positions on University
committees, and by the recent
endeavors of the Internal
Communications Committee to
arrange dinners and informal
meetings between the Councl of
Presidents and students.
However, in the excitement
over newly-initiated programs,
ideas, and controversies, the
second basic reason for the
ASSU—"to provide student
services"—is frequently forgotten.
Student government, through the
administration of Student
Financial Manager David Swift,
utilizes each student's three
dollars per quarter to conceive,
plan, and finance a broad base of
programs and services—most of
which students take for granted.
The most basic are those
services directly under the
Student Financial Manager: 1) the
Travel Service, which charters
flights for Stanford students,

principally for Christmas and
summer vacations, 2) management
of the Boathouse and Lake
Operations, which provides
lifeguards, canoes, and floats in
the spring, 3) the Student Police
Force, 4) the Student
Management Internship Program
(SMIP), which was founded
several years ago by the Business
School students to secure summer
intern positions in industrial
management for Stanford
students, and 5) the Sunday
Flicks, which provides a special
breed of entertainment at 40
cents admission.
Student Services
Some of the more obvious
services are those provided by the
Elections Commission, which
manages all ASSU elections, and
the Pre-Reg Commission, which
introduces freshmen and transfer
students to Stanford. The
Graduate Student Association is
another organization that is
involved with Pre-Reg activities
and the Clearing House, and
provides varied programs for
graduate students as well. The
BSU and MECHA, both
attempting to acculturate the
white student to the black and
brown cultures, are also sponsored
by the ASSU.
There is a long list of other
commissions and boards which are
not so well known, but which do
play a significant role in campus
activities. Few students who went
to the Bonfire or participated in
the Big Game activities know
what Axe Comm or Cardinals
Board is. Yet both of these
student groups work behind the
scenes to build up school spirit.
Axe Comm plans all the rallies
and card stunts, and pays for half
of the clothing and traveling
expenses of the cheerleaders and
dollies. This year it also pays the
traveling expenses of Prince
Lightfoot.
Cardinals Board consists of 1 2
juniors and seniors who work on
four main projects a year. In the
fall, they organize Big Game
activities and coordinate the
freshmen working on the Bonfire.
Each winter, they organize a
public service project. In the
spring, there is High School Day
and finally "Con Home Drive"—a
week of fund-raising and
"fun-raising" including such
events as a carnival, a water-skiing
show on the lake, and a concert.
All the proceeds go to the
Stanford Convalescent Home for
handicapped children.
Interest Organizations
Another organization,
significant to those students who
heard Mayor Alioto, Barry
Goldwater, and Margaret Mead on
campus this year, is the Political
Union Board. It is a committee of
seven students, who work
continually to bring speakers to
campus, and to assist other

voluntary groups in their speakers
program.
The International Association,
centered in the Bechtel
International Center, also offers
speakers and films, and in
previous years, has sponsored
programs to Keio, the University
of Beirut, and the Free University
of Berlin. The Volunteers in Asia,
another group which has its own
film series, receive;* funds from
the ASSU through the
International Association.
Two other boards which
cannot be overlooked are the
Special Events Board and the Art
Board. Special Events plans
concerts, dances, and other special
activities sponsored by the ASSU.
It also compiles the quarterly
calendar. The Art Board provides
materials for all other
organizations, and is responsible
for the regulation of all public art
activities of the ASSU.
Student Publications
Another important sector of
campus life is that of student
publications. Both the Daily and
Sequoia operate with funds from
the ASSU. Other publications are
assisted by the ASSU Publications
Fund.
There are still more examples
which show the importance of the
ASSU in campus life, and help
dispel the notion that the ASSU is
nothing more than a monolithic
power located somewhere in the
Student Union.
