# Land Plan Lambasted
## 
### 
An 80-million-dollar building
project slated to go up along
Arastradero Road was severely
criticized by a planning consultant
team Friday.
The report said that the
project, which is being built by
the Land Resources Corporation,
and is the largest building project
in Palo Alto's history, has
"considerable economic
justification," but is so poorly
designed that the plans "are
difficult to take seriously."
The report was especially
critical of the high building
density of the project. "From the
esthetic standpoint, such densities
can be acceptable or even
desirable if done with excellence,"
the report said. But it added that
the "present design does not meet
this standard."
"The total visual effect seen
from the surrounding properties
and (Foothill) park will be to
change the present rolling
character of the foothills to a
series of stepped terrances covered
with housing," the report said.
