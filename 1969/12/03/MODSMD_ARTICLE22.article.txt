## Tribe Drops Opener; 32 for Terry 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's varsity basketball team opened its
season on a disappointing note Monday night as
they dropped a 96-94 decision to the Utah
Redskins in Salt Lake City.
The Indians led 94-93 with 33 seconds left in
the game, but Utah forward Kenny Gardner sank
two free throws to give the Utes a 95-94 lead. Walt
Hawkins iced the decision as he sunk a free throw
with one second remaining to make the final score
96-94.
Stanford had their work cut out for them in
facing a strong Utah team which was opening its
new pavilion against the Indians. It was an
extremely close first period and Stanford led
40-38 with 2:33 left in the half. The Redskins
then rolled off eight straight points for a 46-40
halftime lead.
Sophomore star Claude Terry, who hit on 14 of
18 field goal attempts and 4 of 6 free throws for
an outstanding 32 point performance, quickly got
Stanford back in the game. He hit four quick
hoops in the first four minutes of the second half
to tie the score up at 54-54.
Playing well, the Indians fought out to a 68-61
lead with 11:41 left. In the last ten minutes the
lead changed hands ten times.
Junior center Larry Rosenzweig, who, like
Terry, was playing in his first varsity game, got
nine of his nineteen points in the last few minutes
to give the Indians their 94-93 lead. But then the
Tribe, as it had been all night, was called for a
couple of costly fouls which gave Utah the win.
Stanford hit on 41 of 78 field goal attempts for
a remarkable 52.6 shooting percentage. Despite

getting fifteen more field goals, the Indians lost
the game at the free throw line. Taking advantage
of an extremely lucrative foul situation which saw
the Indians whistled down for fourteen more fouls
than the Utes, Utah converted 44 of 52 free
throws for an amazing 84.6 per cent.
Leading the way for Utah at the foul strip was
guard Mike Newlin who converted 23 of 25 free
throws. Newlin led all scorers with 33 points.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was quite
pleased with Terry and Rosenzweig. He said,
"They sure didn't play like it was their first varsity
game, they weren't tense at all." Rosenzweig's
performance—nine for twelve from the floor- was
all the more remarkable since he only played half
the game, splitting the time with starting center
Bill Palmer.
Tonight, the Indians open their home season
against San Jose State in Roscoe Maples Pavilion at
8:00 p.m. Leading the way for the Spartans will be
6-10 senior forward Coby Dietrick. Dietrick is a
fine shooter, who led the Spartans last year along
with now-departed center Darnell Hillman. At the
other forward will be Pete Hamm (6-6) and at
center will be 6-6 Bernie Veasey. The guards will
be Steve McKean (6-1) and Chris Geunther (6-0), a
couple of fine outside jumpshooters who are both
fairly quick.
Dallmar indicated that he will go with the same
lineup that started the Utah game—forwards Bill
Barber (6-4) and Fred Green (6-4); guards Claude
Terry (6-5) and DennisO'Neill(6-2V2); and center
Bill Palmer (6-7). Dallmar indicated that the 6-10
Rosenzweig will also see considerable action
against the Spartans.

behind-the-board jump shot in a game last year. Green will fill one of the
starting spots tonight when the Tribe opens the home season against San Jose
State.

getting fifteen more field goals, the Indians lost
the game at the free throw line. Taking advantage
of an extremely lucrative foul situation which saw
the Indians whistled down for fourteen more fouls
than the Utes, Utah converted 44 of 52 free
throws for an amazing 84.6 per cent.
Leading the way for Utah at the foul strip was
guard Mike Newlin who converted 23 of 25 free
throws. Newlin led all scorers with 33 points.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was quite
pleased with Terry and Rosenzweig. He said,
"They sure didn't play like it was their first varsity
game, they weren't tense at all." Rosenzweig's
performance—nine for twelve from the floor- was
all the more remarkable since he only played half
the game, splitting the time with starting center
Bill Palmer.
Tonight, the Indians open their home season
against San Jose State in Roscoe Maples Pavilion at
8:00 p.m. Leading the way for the Spartans will be
6-10 senior forward Coby Dietrick. Dietrick is a
fine shooter, who led the Spartans last year along
with now-departed center Darnell Hillman. At the
other forward will be Pete Hamm (6-6) and at
center will be 6-6 Bernie Veasey. The guards will
be Steve McKean (6-1) and Chris Geunther (6-0), a
couple of fine outside jumpshooters who are both
fairly quick.
Dallmar indicated that he will go with the same
lineup that started the Utah game—forwards Bill
Barber (6-4) and Fred Green (6-4); guards Claude
Terry (6-5) and DennisO'Neill(6-2V2); and center
Bill Palmer (6-7). Dallmar indicated that the 6-10
Rosenzweig will also see considerable action
against the Spartans.


USING THE BACKBOARD-Fred Green, Stanford forward, tries the tricky
behind-the-board jump shot in a game last year. Green will fill one of the
starting spots tonight when the Tribe opens the home season against San Jose
State.
Stanford's varsity basketball team opened its
season on a disappointing note Monday night as
they dropped a 96-94 decision to the Utah
Redskins in Salt Lake City.
The Indians led 94-93 with 33 seconds left in
the game, but Utah forward Kenny Gardner sank
two free throws to give the Utes a 95-94 lead. Walt
Hawkins iced the decision as he sunk a free throw
with one second remaining to make the final score
96-94.
Stanford had their work cut out for them in
facing a strong Utah team which was opening its
new pavilion against the Indians. It was an
extremely close first period and Stanford led
40-38 with 2:33 left in the half. The Redskins
then rolled off eight straight points for a 46-40
halftime lead.
Sophomore star Claude Terry, who hit on 14 of
18 field goal attempts and 4 of 6 free throws for
an outstanding 32 point performance, quickly got
Stanford back in the game. He hit four quick
hoops in the first four minutes of the second half
to tie the score up at 54-54.
Playing well, the Indians fought out to a 68-61
lead with 11:41 left. In the last ten minutes the
lead changed hands ten times.
Junior center Larry Rosenzweig, who, like
Terry, was playing in his first varsity game, got
nine of his nineteen points in the last few minutes
to give the Indians their 94-93 lead. But then the
Tribe, as it had been all night, was called for a
couple of costly fouls which gave Utah the win.
Stanford hit on 41 of 78 field goal attempts for
a remarkable 52.6 shooting percentage. Despite

getting fifteen more field goals, the Indians lost
the game at the free throw line. Taking advantage
of an extremely lucrative foul situation which saw
the Indians whistled down for fourteen more fouls
