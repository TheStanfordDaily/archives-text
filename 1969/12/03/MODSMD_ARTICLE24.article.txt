# 'Action -Oriented' Workshops
## SWOPSI Plans Announced 
### 
Organizers of the Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI) have announced
plans for eleven new workshops to
begin Winter Quarter. In addition,
five of the ten seminar-style
workshops begun this fall will
continue into Winter Quarter.
The SWOPSI program, which
was initiated over the summer by
graduate students Bob Jaffe and
Joel Primack and Joyce
Kobayashi of the ASSU Council
of Presidents, currently involves
several hundred students studying
and proposing solutions to
pressing social and political
problems.
Joyce, speaking for the
SWOPSI organizers, said that the
winter quarter program would be
quite similar to the fall program.
The workshops are to be
conducted as Undergraduate
Specials with from zero to three
units of credit. The majority of
this fall's courses were offered for
three units of credit.
Joyce said that the new
workshops will be listed together
with those continuing from the
fall in a catalogue to be
distributed at Winter Quarter
Registration. She indicated that as
in the fall all the enrollment and
registration questions would be
worked out at the first meeting of
each workshop.
