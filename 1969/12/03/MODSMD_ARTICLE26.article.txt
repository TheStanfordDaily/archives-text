# Mt. View Assemblyman Discusses New Politics
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
"Everything seems formless,"
and politics is "straddling between
the old which is very rigid and the
new which is still obscure,"
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos
said Monday.
In a blunt but friendly
question-and-answer session with
30 members and sympathizers of
the Committee for a New Politics,
the first-term liberal from
Mountain View's Twenty-Fourth
District emphasized that politics is
in a period of "massive and rapid
change."
"Its all changing so fast," he
confessed, "that when I talk
about a 'New Politics' I can't seem
ever to capture it all at one time. I
sometimes get close and then I
falter. What's more I don't think
there is any group that has a
vision of what it will be like."
Throughout his presentation
the burly politician pleased his
audience with straightforward
answers.
"He seemed so honest," one
girl commented after the session.
"He just didn't seem like a
politician. He may have been
wearing a green pin-stripe suit, but
he had long hair that wasn't
combed just so, and he said things
like 'far-out' and 'heavy.' He
didn't seem to be trying to win
you over all of the time with his
personality."
Individual Participation
The New Politics people
seemed equally pleased with
Vasconcello's political ideology of
increased freedom, responsibility,
and individual participation.
The legislator said, "I think a
lot of what we are talking about is
the need for more individuality
and autonomy. But. of course.

more freedom requires more
responsibility."
"Townhall Meetings"
The Assemblyman then went
on to describe the efforts he has
made to increase political
participation in his district.
"We are trying to confront
people in a way that engages their
attention," he said. "We want to
change people's attitudes and
lower their fears."
To do this he has organized
"townhall meetings" and sent
copies of position papers on
campus violence and other
controversial topics to each of his
constituents. In this way he thinks
he is challenging individuals with
some radically different ideas.
Mediocre Reaction
His district's reaction to the
innovations so far has been
mediocre. The crowds at the
"townhall meetings" have ranged
from 9 to 90.
But the bachelor legislator
remains optimistic. Though
Mountain View Democrats had
rumored earlier in the year that he
might run for Congressman Don
Edwards' Washington seat
Vasconcellos said Monday he
wants to stay in the state
legislature.
"Politics to me is being with
the people and not 3,000 miles
away," he said. "Even though
some might think so, I'm not the
ivory tower type."
What of the future?
Assemblyman Vasconcellos thinks
we are living it now. "In
California," he said, "We are on
the front edge of Western
Civilization. There's the drug
scene, the far Right and the far
Left. Its an exciting place to be if
you can stomach it."

falter. What's more I don't think
there is any group that has a
vision of what it will be like."
Throughout his presentation
the burly politician pleased his
audience with straightforward
answers.
"He seemed so honest," one
girl commented after the session.
"He just didn't seem like a
politician. He may have been
wearing a green pin-stripe suit, but
he had long hair that wasn't
combed just so, and he said things
like 'far-out' and 'heavy.' He
didn't seem to be trying to win
you over all of the time with his
personality."
Individual Participation
The New Politics people
seemed equally pleased with
Vasconcello's political ideology of
increased freedom, responsibility,
and individual participation.
The legislator said, "I think a
lot of what we are talking about is
the need for more individuality
and autonomy. But. of course.

more freedom requires more
responsibility."
"Townhall Meetings"
The Assemblyman then went
on to describe the efforts he has
made to increase political
participation in his district.
"We are trying to confront
people in a way that engages their
attention," he said. "We want to
change people's attitudes and
lower their fears."
To do this he has organized
"townhall meetings" and sent
copies of position papers on
campus violence and other
controversial topics to each of his
constituents. In this way he thinks
he is challenging individuals with
some radically different ideas.
Mediocre Reaction
His district's reaction to the
innovations so far has been
mediocre. The crowds at the
"townhall meetings" have ranged
from 9 to 90.
But the bachelor legislator
remains optimistic. Though
Mountain View Democrats had
rumored earlier in the year that he
might run for Congressman Don
Edwards' Washington seat
Vasconcellos said Monday he
wants to stay in the state
legislature.
"Politics to me is being with
the people and not 3,000 miles
away," he said. "Even though
some might think so, I'm not the
ivory tower type."
What of the future?
Assemblyman Vasconcellos thinks
we are living it now. "In
California," he said, "We are on
the front edge of Western
Civilization. There's the drug
scene, the far Right and the far
Left. Its an exciting place to be if
you can stomach it."
"Everything seems formless,"
and politics is "straddling between
the old which is very rigid and the
new which is still obscure,"
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos
said Monday.
In a blunt but friendly
question-and-answer session with
30 members and sympathizers of
the Committee for a New Politics,
the first-term liberal from
Mountain View's Twenty-Fourth
District emphasized that politics is
in a period of "massive and rapid
change."
"Its all changing so fast," he
confessed, "that when I talk
about a 'New Politics' I can't seem
ever to capture it all at one time. I
sometimes get close and then I
falter. What's more I don't think
there is any group that has a
vision of what it will be like."
