# Plunkett: The Quiet Quaterback
## 
### FRED MANN 
"Considering the circumstances, it sure would be easy to hate him.
But he's just not the type of guy anyone could hate. It's crazy."
Don Bunce, a soft-spoken blonde headed quarterback sat back and
talked about his close friend and biggest enemy, fraternity brother
Jim Plunkett. "It's so hard to get to know him, you just can't hate
him. All you feel is respect."
Both Bunce and Plunkett are currently concentrating their lives
around Stanford football, but there can be only one quarterback. The
rivalry is intense in practice, and both have the ability to be
super-stars, but it is Plunkett who has stolen the glory.
The 22-year old Mexican-American from San Jose has received
more publicity in his two years of varsity football than any other
Stanford athlete in history. His image is on the front of gamy
programs, press books, and even plastic water cups, and his name is
prominent in every publicity release on the West Coast.
The reason is simple: Jim Plunkett has proven himself on the
football field. He owns every league record a quarterback could drem
of, he is the team leader emotionally as well as physically, and he still
has another year at Stanford when he will improve even more.
In looking at Plunkett off the field, it is impossible to ignore his
work as a football player. He is constantly building himself physically
and mentally for a life of football. Critics from all over the country
have called him a perfect candidate for the high-paying world of
professional football, and naturally, Jim is looking forward to a pro
contract.
He, more than most, could use the money.
Along with his two older sisters, Jim helps support his mother who
is totally blind. His father, who ran a tobacco shop in San Jose and
was virtually sightless himself, passed away last spring. Jim worked
during high school in the summers to help out, and now assumes the
role of family provider. He is going to school on a Buck Club athletic
grant.
Not the Typical Quarterback
The quiet Bunce is not the stereotype of a football quarterback,
and the even quieter Plunkett is no where near that image.
"Yeah, I guess I'm a shy person," Jim remarked. He sat easily in a
deep chair in the TV room of the Delt house. Twenty other football
players are in the same fraternity. The season was over, and he was
relaxed.
"Now I've got some time to myself." The words were barely
audible over the din from the television and the nearby card game.
"He's not around as much as most of the other guys," remarked
Bunce, "and he's an introverted person. It's difficult to get close to
him. He's always in San Jose with either his family or Gini."
Plunkett's girl friend is a student at San Jose State. "We have been
very close for a long time," said Jim. "We have an understanding."
Again Bunce elaborated. "Although Jimmy always denies it, they
seem pretty serious. He was half-serious in discussing it with me for
the first time today."
What is in Plunkett's romantic future he will not say, but his
professional aims are not secret to anyone. "I'm looking forward to
pro ball," he commented. "I guess I've always wanted to be a pro
quarterback."
The Greatest In the Game?
If the experts are right, Jim will have his wish. Opposing coaches
call him the best pure passer that has ever played the game, and the
toughest quarterback college football has ever seen. His own coach
John Ralston, called his star "the best passer in the country . . . the
best I've ever coached ... a boy with the mental outlook of a
champion."
Even Vince Lombardi, the king of the National Football League,
said, "as it stands now, we would draft Jim over any other collegian in
the country."
The question arises, why doesn't he go to pro football now?
Academically, Plunkett is a senior, and needs to carry only a few extra
units to graduate with his class in June. But so far as football
eligibility goes, he has next year to play at Stanford. He sat out his
sophomore season as a redshirt.
This year was a great one for him. He finished as the number one
major school offensive player in the entire nation, and ranked third in
total passing. He was named on many all-star teams, and broke every
league record imaginable.
Playing next year for Stanford might only hurt his chances for a
high-paying professional offer. It will be difficult to repreat such a
statistically successful season, and there is always the chance of
serious injury, which has bothered him in the past.
But everyone agrees, it is almost certain that Jim Plunkett will be
back again next year. Ralston feels Jim gets better every year, and
waiting a while longer can only help him in the pros. "He is a gifted
athlete who improves every time out. He will have another
outstanding year," the coach said.
Bunce is puzzled as to why Plunkett would stay, but he is sure Jim
will be around next fall. "He must feel that he owes the school
something. After all, Stanford did give him a chance to play football
and make a name for himself."
Plunkett himself candidly admits that it is neither a commitment
nor a desire to improve that will keep him at Stanford. "Actually, I

haven't been approached by anyone," he said. 1 plan to talk to
people and get advice. The NCAA rules are strict on raiding colleges
for athletes, and 1 don't think I'm even on most teams' lists for this
year. But I'll do what is best for me."
Nt'\»*r Mali An Effort
It is this desire to help himself that Ralston notices most about his
quarterback. "Jim is the type that wants to improve. He throws SUO
times a day, studies the game of football, and thinks it all the time. He
has more confidence in himself everyday. He is an excellent person
who never does anything half way."
Bunce agreed with Ralston's comments and recalled an instance
when Jim was at his "all the way" best. "Onenight last spring, Jimmy
decided he was going to get drunk. It was really un typical, but once
he made up his mind, it was just like anything else-100 percent
effort.
"He went to Rat's and sat chugging pitchers until the deed was
done. Boy, did he pay for it that night!"
Aside from occasional outbursts, Plunkett tries to keep in shape.
He is physically ready for professional football He is big and very
strong for a quarterback —qualities necessary for the pounding of the
pros. He stands 6-3, weighs 20-1, and has hands huge enough to
control a football with ease.
"I guess I can throw the ball around 80 yards," he casually
remarked. There are few established pros who have that kind of
power. He shifted his sitting position in the chair and thought about
the importance of strength.
"Basically, you can throw the ball better from off balance if you're
strong, and you can play with injuries."
Last year, when he set conference records in total offense and
passing, Plunkett played the last five games with torn knee cartilage
which required an operation. This season, although he looked fine, he
suffered pains as well. "1 had a lot of shoulder trouble all the time,
and my other knee may need surgery," he said.
"Last year, I was scared. I'd get hit and then get up and look to see
if my knee was still there. But actually, I can't complain. The linemen
really get banged up all the time. Quarterback is a soft job.."
Plunkett and Bunce worked together last summer for a
construction company to keep them in shape for the easy job of

quarterbacking. Plunkett's dark face gleamed as he said he would
survive if he never worked construction again.
When the condition of your body can mean hundreds of thousands
of dollars, you tend to take care of it. "I'm always doing something
athletic," remarked Jim. "1 play a lot of basketball in the off-season
and I usually fool around with tennis, golf, handball, just about
everything." He played football, baseball and wrestling in high school.
Learned From The Community
"I'm glad I'm at Stanford. I've learned a lot besides being able to
play football. It is a difficult place for an athlete because he has to
combine sports and the classroom, but 1 know 1 ve gained a lot from
being here. I've learned from the community as well as the classes. 1
don't know whether a guy at USC could say the same thing."
Plunkett received offers from all the Pacific-8 schools as well as
Notre Dame, Navy, North Carolina, and Santa Clara.
"I really liked the Stanford recruiters," he said with a smile, "and
Coach Ralston. He was very personable. When I went to Cal, Coach
(Ray) Willsey scared me to death."
Although tilings seem to be going beautifully lor Plunkett, there
are certain disappointments along his successful trail. He was totally
snubbed in a recent Sports Illustrated story listing potential Heisman
Throhy candidates.
The article, written by Texan Dan Jenkins, showed pictures of four
junior quarterbacks (including rival UCLA's Dennis Dummit), all
ranking behind Plunkett in statistics, but did not even mention
Stanford's Mexican-American star.
The lack of national attention is bound to lose him votes in various
All-America balloting. But still, Jim Plunkett just goes on his quiet
way. His own family responsibilities are kept private, while his desire
to succeed in his chosen profession is evident to thousand s of
football fans every Saturday each fall.
"He doesn't let the publicity bother him," concludes Bunce. "He
never talks about himself personally. He's very humble and shy."
Bunce paused.
"He's amazing."


JIM PLUNKETT— Stanford's All-every tiling quarterback is looking forward to a
life of football, and currently plans to be back for the Indians next year. Last
night he was honored at the team awards banquet for his record-breaking year.
"Considering the circumstances, it sure would be easy to hate him.

JIM PLUNKETT— Stanford's All-every tiling quarterback is looking forward to a

night he was honored at the team awards banquet for his record-breaking year.
"Considering the circumstances, it sure would be easy to hate him.

Both Bunce and Plunkett are currently concentrating their lives
around Stanford football, but there can be only one quarterback. The
rivalry is intense in practice, and both have the ability to be
super-stars, but it is Plunkett who has stolen the glory.
The 22-year old Mexican-American from San Jose has received
more publicity in his two years of varsity football than any other
Stanford athlete in history. His image is on the front of gamy
programs, press books, and even plastic water cups, and his name is
prominent in every publicity release on the West Coast.
The reason is simple: Jim Plunkett has proven himself on the
football field. He owns every league record a quarterback could drem
of, he is the team leader emotionally as well as physically, and he still
has another year at Stanford when he will improve even more.
In looking at Plunkett off the field, it is impossible to ignore his

is totally blind. His father, who ran a tobacco shop in San Jose and

seem pretty serious. He was half-serious in discussing it with me for
the first time today."
What is in Plunkett's romantic future he will not say, but his
professional aims are not secret to anyone. "I'm looking forward to
pro ball," he commented. "I guess I've always wanted to be a pro
quarterback."
The Greatest In the Game?
If the experts are right, Jim will have his wish. Opposing coaches
call him the best pure passer that has ever played the game, and the
toughest quarterback college football has ever seen. His own coach
John Ralston, called his star "the best passer in the country . . . the
best I've ever coached ... a boy with the mental outlook of a
champion."
Even Vince Lombardi, the king of the National Football League,
said, "as it stands now, we would draft Jim over any other collegian in
the country."
The question arises, why doesn't he go to pro football now?
Academically, Plunkett is a senior, and needs to carry only a few extra
units to graduate with his class in June. But so far as football
eligibility goes, he has next year to play at Stanford. He sat out his
sophomore season as a redshirt.
This year was a great one for him. He finished as the number one
major school offensive player in the entire nation, and ranked third in
total passing. He was named on many all-star teams, and broke every
league record imaginable.
Playing next year for Stanford might only hurt his chances for a
high-paying professional offer. It will be difficult to repreat such a
statistically successful season, and there is always the chance of
serious injury, which has bothered him in the past.
But everyone agrees, it is almost certain that Jim Plunkett will be
back again next year. Ralston feels Jim gets better every year, and
waiting a while longer can only help him in the pros. "He is a gifted
athlete who improves every time out. He will have another
outstanding year," the coach said.
Bunce is puzzled as to why Plunkett would stay, but he is sure Jim
will be around next fall. "He must feel that he owes the school
something. After all, Stanford did give him a chance to play football
and make a name for himself."
Plunkett himself candidly admits that it is neither a commitment
nor a desire to improve that will keep him at Stanford. "Actually, I

haven't been approached by anyone," he said. 1 plan to talk to
people and get advice. The NCAA rules are strict on raiding colleges
for athletes, and 1 don't think I'm even on most teams' lists for this
year. But I'll do what is best for me."
Nt'\»*r Mali An Effort
It is this desire to help himself that Ralston notices most about his
quarterback. "Jim is the type that wants to improve. He throws SUO
times a day, studies the game of football, and thinks it all the time. He
has more confidence in himself everyday. He is an excellent person
who never does anything half way."
Bunce agreed with Ralston's comments and recalled an instance
when Jim was at his "all the way" best. "Onenight last spring, Jimmy
decided he was going to get drunk. It was really un typical, but once
he made up his mind, it was just like anything else-100 percent
effort.
"He went to Rat's and sat chugging pitchers until the deed was
done. Boy, did he pay for it that night!"
Aside from occasional outbursts, Plunkett tries to keep in shape.
He is physically ready for professional football He is big and very
strong for a quarterback —qualities necessary for the pounding of the
pros. He stands 6-3, weighs 20-1, and has hands huge enough to
control a football with ease.
"I guess I can throw the ball around 80 yards," he casually
remarked. There are few established pros who have that kind of
power. He shifted his sitting position in the chair and thought about
the importance of strength.
"Basically, you can throw the ball better from off balance if you're
strong, and you can play with injuries."
Last year, when he set conference records in total offense and
passing, Plunkett played the last five games with torn knee cartilage
which required an operation. This season, although he looked fine, he
suffered pains as well. "1 had a lot of shoulder trouble all the time,
and my other knee may need surgery," he said.
"Last year, I was scared. I'd get hit and then get up and look to see
if my knee was still there. But actually, I can't complain. The linemen
really get banged up all the time. Quarterback is a soft job.."
Plunkett and Bunce worked together last summer for a
construction company to keep them in shape for the easy job of

quarterbacking. Plunkett's dark face gleamed as he said he would
survive if he never worked construction again.
When the condition of your body can mean hundreds of thousands
of dollars, you tend to take care of it. "I'm always doing something
athletic," remarked Jim. "1 play a lot of basketball in the off-season
and I usually fool around with tennis, golf, handball, just about
everything." He played football, baseball and wrestling in high school.
Learned From The Community
"I'm glad I'm at Stanford. I've learned a lot besides being able to
play football. It is a difficult place for an athlete because he has to
combine sports and the classroom, but 1 know 1 ve gained a lot from
being here. I've learned from the community as well as the classes. 1
don't know whether a guy at USC could say the same thing."
Plunkett received offers from all the Pacific-8 schools as well as
Notre Dame, Navy, North Carolina, and Santa Clara.
"I really liked the Stanford recruiters," he said with a smile, "and
Coach Ralston. He was very personable. When I went to Cal, Coach
(Ray) Willsey scared me to death."
Although tilings seem to be going beautifully lor Plunkett, there
are certain disappointments along his successful trail. He was totally
snubbed in a recent Sports Illustrated story listing potential Heisman
Throhy candidates.
The article, written by Texan Dan Jenkins, showed pictures of four
junior quarterbacks (including rival UCLA's Dennis Dummit), all
ranking behind Plunkett in statistics, but did not even mention
Stanford's Mexican-American star.
The lack of national attention is bound to lose him votes in various
All-America balloting. But still, Jim Plunkett just goes on his quiet
way. His own family responsibilities are kept private, while his desire
to succeed in his chosen profession is evident to thousand s of
football fans every Saturday each fall.
"He doesn't let the publicity bother him," concludes Bunce. "He
never talks about himself personally. He's very humble and shy."
Bunce paused.
"He's amazing."


JIM PLUNKETT— Stanford's All-every tiling quarterback is looking forward to a
life of football, and currently plans to be back for the Indians next year. Last
night he was honored at the team awards banquet for his record-breaking year.
"Considering the circumstances, it sure would be easy to hate him.
But he's just not the type of guy anyone could hate. It's crazy."
Don Bunce, a soft-spoken blonde headed quarterback sat back and
talked about his close friend and biggest enemy, fraternity brother
Jim Plunkett. "It's so hard to get to know him, you just can't hate
him. All you feel is respect."
Both Bunce and Plunkett are currently concentrating their lives
around Stanford football, but there can be only one quarterback. The
rivalry is intense in practice, and both have the ability to be
super-stars, but it is Plunkett who has stolen the glory.
The 22-year old Mexican-American from San Jose has received
more publicity in his two years of varsity football than any other
Stanford athlete in history. His image is on the front of gamy
programs, press books, and even plastic water cups, and his name is
prominent in every publicity release on the West Coast.
The reason is simple: Jim Plunkett has proven himself on the
football field. He owns every league record a quarterback could drem
of, he is the team leader emotionally as well as physically, and he still
has another year at Stanford when he will improve even more.
In looking at Plunkett off the field, it is impossible to ignore his
work as a football player. He is constantly building himself physically
and mentally for a life of football. Critics from all over the country
have called him a perfect candidate for the high-paying world of
professional football, and naturally, Jim is looking forward to a pro
contract.
He, more than most, could use the money.
Along with his two older sisters, Jim helps support his mother who
is totally blind. His father, who ran a tobacco shop in San Jose and
was virtually sightless himself, passed away last spring. Jim worked
during high school in the summers to help out, and now assumes the
role of family provider. He is going to school on a Buck Club athletic
grant.
Not the Typical Quarterback
The quiet Bunce is not the stereotype of a football quarterback,
and the even quieter Plunkett is no where near that image.
"Yeah, I guess I'm a shy person," Jim remarked. He sat easily in a
deep chair in the TV room of the Delt house. Twenty other football
players are in the same fraternity. The season was over, and he was
relaxed.
"Now I've got some time to myself." The words were barely
audible over the din from the television and the nearby card game.
"He's not around as much as most of the other guys," remarked
Bunce, "and he's an introverted person. It's difficult to get close to
him. He's always in San Jose with either his family or Gini."
Plunkett's girl friend is a student at San Jose State. "We have been
very close for a long time," said Jim. "We have an understanding."
Again Bunce elaborated. "Although Jimmy always denies it, they
seem pretty serious. He was half-serious in discussing it with me for
the first time today."

times a day, studies the game of football, and thinks it all the time. He
has more confidence in himself everyday. He is an excellent person
who never does anything half way."
Bunce agreed with Ralston's comments and recalled an instance
when Jim was at his "all the way" best. "Onenight last spring, Jimmy
decided he was going to get drunk. It was really un typical, but once
he made up his mind, it was just like anything else-100 percent
effort.
"He went to Rat's and sat chugging pitchers until the deed was
done. Boy, did he pay for it that night!"
Aside from occasional outbursts, Plunkett tries to keep in shape.
He is physically ready for professional football He is big and very
strong for a quarterback —qualities necessary for the pounding of the
pros. He stands 6-3, weighs 20-1, and has hands huge enough to
control a football with ease.
"I guess I can throw the ball around 80 yards," he casually
remarked. There are few established pros who have that kind of
power. He shifted his sitting position in the chair and thought about
the importance of strength.
"Basically, you can throw the ball better from off balance if you're
strong, and you can play with injuries."
Last year, when he set conference records in total offense and
passing, Plunkett played the last five games with torn knee cartilage
which required an operation. This season, although he looked fine, he
suffered pains as well. "1 had a lot of shoulder trouble all the time,
and my other knee may need surgery," he said.
"Last year, I was scared. I'd get hit and then get up and look to see
if my knee was still there. But actually, I can't complain. The linemen
really get banged up all the time. Quarterback is a soft job.."
Plunkett and Bunce worked together last summer for a
construction company to keep them in shape for the easy job of

quarterbacking. Plunkett's dark face gleamed as he said he would
survive if he never worked construction again.
When the condition of your body can mean hundreds of thousands
of dollars, you tend to take care of it. "I'm always doing something
athletic," remarked Jim. "1 play a lot of basketball in the off-season
and I usually fool around with tennis, golf, handball, just about
everything." He played football, baseball and wrestling in high school.
Learned From The Community
"I'm glad I'm at Stanford. I've learned a lot besides being able to
play football. It is a difficult place for an athlete because he has to
combine sports and the classroom, but 1 know 1 ve gained a lot from
being here. I've learned from the community as well as the classes. 1
don't know whether a guy at USC could say the same thing."
Plunkett received offers from all the Pacific-8 schools as well as
Notre Dame, Navy, North Carolina, and Santa Clara.
"I really liked the Stanford recruiters," he said with a smile, "and
Coach Ralston. He was very personable. When I went to Cal, Coach
(Ray) Willsey scared me to death."
Although tilings seem to be going beautifully lor Plunkett, there
are certain disappointments along his successful trail. He was totally
snubbed in a recent Sports Illustrated story listing potential Heisman
Throhy candidates.
The article, written by Texan Dan Jenkins, showed pictures of four
junior quarterbacks (including rival UCLA's Dennis Dummit), all
ranking behind Plunkett in statistics, but did not even mention
Stanford's Mexican-American star.
The lack of national attention is bound to lose him votes in various
All-America balloting. But still, Jim Plunkett just goes on his quiet
way. His own family responsibilities are kept private, while his desire
to succeed in his chosen profession is evident to thousand s of
football fans every Saturday each fall.
"He doesn't let the publicity bother him," concludes Bunce. "He
never talks about himself personally. He's very humble and shy."
Bunce paused.
"He's amazing."


JIM PLUNKETT— Stanford's All-every tiling quarterback is looking forward to a
life of football, and currently plans to be back for the Indians next year. Last
night he was honored at the team awards banquet for his record-breaking year.
"Considering the circumstances, it sure would be easy to hate him.
But he's just not the type of guy anyone could hate. It's crazy."
Don Bunce, a soft-spoken blonde headed quarterback sat back and
talked about his close friend and biggest enemy, fraternity brother
Jim Plunkett. "It's so hard to get to know him, you just can't hate
him. All you feel is respect."
Both Bunce and Plunkett are currently concentrating their lives
around Stanford football, but there can be only one quarterback. The
rivalry is intense in practice, and both have the ability to be
super-stars, but it is Plunkett who has stolen the glory.
The 22-year old Mexican-American from San Jose has received
more publicity in his two years of varsity football than any other
Stanford athlete in history. His image is on the front of gamy
programs, press books, and even plastic water cups, and his name is
prominent in every publicity release on the West Coast.
The reason is simple: Jim Plunkett has proven himself on the
football field. He owns every league record a quarterback could drem
of, he is the team leader emotionally as well as physically, and he still
has another year at Stanford when he will improve even more.
In looking at Plunkett off the field, it is impossible to ignore his
work as a football player. He is constantly building himself physically
and mentally for a life of football. Critics from all over the country
have called him a perfect candidate for the high-paying world of
professional football, and naturally, Jim is looking forward to a pro
contract.
He, more than most, could use the money.
Along with his two older sisters, Jim helps support his mother who
is totally blind. His father, who ran a tobacco shop in San Jose and
was virtually sightless himself, passed away last spring. Jim worked
during high school in the summers to help out, and now assumes the
role of family provider. He is going to school on a Buck Club athletic
grant.
Not the Typical Quarterback
The quiet Bunce is not the stereotype of a football quarterback,
and the even quieter Plunkett is no where near that image.
"Yeah, I guess I'm a shy person," Jim remarked. He sat easily in a
deep chair in the TV room of the Delt house. Twenty other football
players are in the same fraternity. The season was over, and he was
relaxed.
"Now I've got some time to myself." The words were barely
audible over the din from the television and the nearby card game.
"He's not around as much as most of the other guys," remarked
Bunce, "and he's an introverted person. It's difficult to get close to
him. He's always in San Jose with either his family or Gini."
Plunkett's girl friend is a student at San Jose State. "We have been
very close for a long time," said Jim. "We have an understanding."
Again Bunce elaborated. "Although Jimmy always denies it, they
seem pretty serious. He was half-serious in discussing it with me for
the first time today."
What is in Plunkett's romantic future he will not say, but his
professional aims are not secret to anyone. "I'm looking forward to
pro ball," he commented. "I guess I've always wanted to be a pro
quarterback."
The Greatest In the Game?
If the experts are right, Jim will have his wish. Opposing coaches
call him the best pure passer that has ever played the game, and the
toughest quarterback college football has ever seen. His own coach
John Ralston, called his star "the best passer in the country . . . the
best I've ever coached ... a boy with the mental outlook of a
champion."
Even Vince Lombardi, the king of the National Football League,
said, "as it stands now, we would draft Jim over any other collegian in
the country."
The question arises, why doesn't he go to pro football now?
Academically, Plunkett is a senior, and needs to carry only a few extra
units to graduate with his class in June. But so far as football
eligibility goes, he has next year to play at Stanford. He sat out his
sophomore season as a redshirt.
This year was a great one for him. He finished as the number one
major school offensive player in the entire nation, and ranked third in
total passing. He was named on many all-star teams, and broke every
league record imaginable.
Playing next year for Stanford might only hurt his chances for a
high-paying professional offer. It will be difficult to repreat such a
statistically successful season, and there is always the chance of
serious injury, which has bothered him in the past.
But everyone agrees, it is almost certain that Jim Plunkett will be
back again next year. Ralston feels Jim gets better every year, and
waiting a while longer can only help him in the pros. "He is a gifted
athlete who improves every time out. He will have another
outstanding year," the coach said.
Bunce is puzzled as to why Plunkett would stay, but he is sure Jim
will be around next fall. "He must feel that he owes the school
something. After all, Stanford did give him a chance to play football
and make a name for himself."
Plunkett himself candidly admits that it is neither a commitment
nor a desire to improve that will keep him at Stanford. "Actually, I

haven't been approached by anyone," he said. 1 plan to talk to
people and get advice. The NCAA rules are strict on raiding colleges
for athletes, and 1 don't think I'm even on most teams' lists for this
year. But I'll do what is best for me."

Notre Dame, Navy, North Carolina, and Santa Clara.
"I really liked the Stanford recruiters," he said with a smile, "and
Coach Ralston. He was very personable. When I went to Cal, Coach
(Ray) Willsey scared me to death."
Although tilings seem to be going beautifully lor Plunkett, there
are certain disappointments along his successful trail. He was totally
snubbed in a recent Sports Illustrated story listing potential Heisman
Throhy candidates.
The article, written by Texan Dan Jenkins, showed pictures of four
junior quarterbacks (including rival UCLA's Dennis Dummit), all
ranking behind Plunkett in statistics, but did not even mention
Stanford's Mexican-American star.
The lack of national attention is bound to lose him votes in various
All-America balloting. But still, Jim Plunkett just goes on his quiet
way. His own family responsibilities are kept private, while his desire
to succeed in his chosen profession is evident to thousand s of
football fans every Saturday each fall.
"He doesn't let the publicity bother him," concludes Bunce. "He
never talks about himself personally. He's very humble and shy."
Bunce paused.
"He's amazing."


JIM PLUNKETT— Stanford's All-every tiling quarterback is looking forward to a
life of football, and currently plans to be back for the Indians next year. Last
night he was honored at the team awards banquet for his record-breaking year.
"Considering the circumstances, it sure would be easy to hate him.
But he's just not the type of guy anyone could hate. It's crazy."
Don Bunce, a soft-spoken blonde headed quarterback sat back and
talked about his close friend and biggest enemy, fraternity brother
Jim Plunkett. "It's so hard to get to know him, you just can't hate
him. All you feel is respect."
Both Bunce and Plunkett are currently concentrating their lives
around Stanford football, but there can be only one quarterback. The
rivalry is intense in practice, and both have the ability to be
super-stars, but it is Plunkett who has stolen the glory.
The 22-year old Mexican-American from San Jose has received
more publicity in his two years of varsity football than any other
Stanford athlete in history. His image is on the front of gamy
programs, press books, and even plastic water cups, and his name is
prominent in every publicity release on the West Coast.
The reason is simple: Jim Plunkett has proven himself on the
football field. He owns every league record a quarterback could drem
of, he is the team leader emotionally as well as physically, and he still
has another year at Stanford when he will improve even more.
In looking at Plunkett off the field, it is impossible to ignore his
work as a football player. He is constantly building himself physically
and mentally for a life of football. Critics from all over the country
have called him a perfect candidate for the high-paying world of
professional football, and naturally, Jim is looking forward to a pro
contract.
He, more than most, could use the money.
Along with his two older sisters, Jim helps support his mother who
is totally blind. His father, who ran a tobacco shop in San Jose and
was virtually sightless himself, passed away last spring. Jim worked
during high school in the summers to help out, and now assumes the
role of family provider. He is going to school on a Buck Club athletic
grant.
Not the Typical Quarterback
The quiet Bunce is not the stereotype of a football quarterback,
and the even quieter Plunkett is no where near that image.
"Yeah, I guess I'm a shy person," Jim remarked. He sat easily in a
deep chair in the TV room of the Delt house. Twenty other football
players are in the same fraternity. The season was over, and he was
relaxed.
"Now I've got some time to myself." The words were barely
audible over the din from the television and the nearby card game.
"He's not around as much as most of the other guys," remarked
Bunce, "and he's an introverted person. It's difficult to get close to
him. He's always in San Jose with either his family or Gini."
Plunkett's girl friend is a student at San Jose State. "We have been
very close for a long time," said Jim. "We have an understanding."
Again Bunce elaborated. "Although Jimmy always denies it, they
seem pretty serious. He was half-serious in discussing it with me for
the first time today."
What is in Plunkett's romantic future he will not say, but his
professional aims are not secret to anyone. "I'm looking forward to
pro ball," he commented. "I guess I've always wanted to be a pro
quarterback."
The Greatest In the Game?
If the experts are right, Jim will have his wish. Opposing coaches
call him the best pure passer that has ever played the game, and the
toughest quarterback college football has ever seen. His own coach
John Ralston, called his star "the best passer in the country . . . the
best I've ever coached ... a boy with the mental outlook of a
champion."
Even Vince Lombardi, the king of the National Football League,
said, "as it stands now, we would draft Jim over any other collegian in
the country."
The question arises, why doesn't he go to pro football now?
Academically, Plunkett is a senior, and needs to carry only a few extra
units to graduate with his class in June. But so far as football
eligibility goes, he has next year to play at Stanford. He sat out his
sophomore season as a redshirt.
This year was a great one for him. He finished as the number one
major school offensive player in the entire nation, and ranked third in
total passing. He was named on many all-star teams, and broke every
league record imaginable.
Playing next year for Stanford might only hurt his chances for a
high-paying professional offer. It will be difficult to repreat such a
statistically successful season, and there is always the chance of
serious injury, which has bothered him in the past.
But everyone agrees, it is almost certain that Jim Plunkett will be
back again next year. Ralston feels Jim gets better every year, and
waiting a while longer can only help him in the pros. "He is a gifted
athlete who improves every time out. He will have another
outstanding year," the coach said.
Bunce is puzzled as to why Plunkett would stay, but he is sure Jim
will be around next fall. "He must feel that he owes the school
something. After all, Stanford did give him a chance to play football
and make a name for himself."
Plunkett himself candidly admits that it is neither a commitment
nor a desire to improve that will keep him at Stanford. "Actually, I

haven't been approached by anyone," he said. 1 plan to talk to
people and get advice. The NCAA rules are strict on raiding colleges
for athletes, and 1 don't think I'm even on most teams' lists for this
year. But I'll do what is best for me."
Nt'\»*r Mali An Effort
It is this desire to help himself that Ralston notices most about his
quarterback. "Jim is the type that wants to improve. He throws SUO
times a day, studies the game of football, and thinks it all the time. He
has more confidence in himself everyday. He is an excellent person
who never does anything half way."
Bunce agreed with Ralston's comments and recalled an instance
when Jim was at his "all the way" best. "Onenight last spring, Jimmy
decided he was going to get drunk. It was really un typical, but once
he made up his mind, it was just like anything else-100 percent
effort.
"He went to Rat's and sat chugging pitchers until the deed was
done. Boy, did he pay for it that night!"
Aside from occasional outbursts, Plunkett tries to keep in shape.
He is physically ready for professional football He is big and very
strong for a quarterback —qualities necessary for the pounding of the
pros. He stands 6-3, weighs 20-1, and has hands huge enough to
control a football with ease.
"I guess I can throw the ball around 80 yards," he casually
remarked. There are few established pros who have that kind of
power. He shifted his sitting position in the chair and thought about
the importance of strength.
"Basically, you can throw the ball better from off balance if you're
strong, and you can play with injuries."
Last year, when he set conference records in total offense and
passing, Plunkett played the last five games with torn knee cartilage
which required an operation. This season, although he looked fine, he
suffered pains as well. "1 had a lot of shoulder trouble all the time,
and my other knee may need surgery," he said.
"Last year, I was scared. I'd get hit and then get up and look to see
if my knee was still there. But actually, I can't complain. The linemen
really get banged up all the time. Quarterback is a soft job.."
Plunkett and Bunce worked together last summer for a
construction company to keep them in shape for the easy job of

quarterbacking. Plunkett's dark face gleamed as he said he would
survive if he never worked construction again.
When the condition of your body can mean hundreds of thousands
of dollars, you tend to take care of it. "I'm always doing something
athletic," remarked Jim. "1 play a lot of basketball in the off-season
and I usually fool around with tennis, golf, handball, just about
everything." He played football, baseball and wrestling in high school.
Learned From The Community
"I'm glad I'm at Stanford. I've learned a lot besides being able to
play football. It is a difficult place for an athlete because he has to
combine sports and the classroom, but 1 know 1 ve gained a lot from
being here. I've learned from the community as well as the classes. 1
don't know whether a guy at USC could say the same thing."
Plunkett received offers from all the Pacific-8 schools as well as
Notre Dame, Navy, North Carolina, and Santa Clara.
"I really liked the Stanford recruiters," he said with a smile, "and
Coach Ralston. He was very personable. When I went to Cal, Coach

JIM PLUNKETT— Stanford's All-every tiling quarterback is looking forward to a
life of football, and currently plans to be back for the Indians next year. Last

"Considering the circumstances, it sure would be easy to hate him.

Don Bunce, a soft-spoken blonde headed quarterback sat back and
talked about his close friend and biggest enemy, fraternity brother
Jim Plunkett. "It's so hard to get to know him, you just can't hate

Both Bunce and Plunkett are currently concentrating their lives
around Stanford football, but there can be only one quarterback. The
rivalry is intense in practice, and both have the ability to be
super-stars, but it is Plunkett who has stolen the glory.
The 22-year old Mexican-American from San Jose has received
more publicity in his two years of varsity football than any other
Stanford athlete in history. His image is on the front of gamy
programs, press books, and even plastic water cups, and his name is
prominent in every publicity release on the West Coast.
The reason is simple: Jim Plunkett has proven himself on the
football field. He owns every league record a quarterback could drem

In looking at Plunkett off the field, it is impossible to ignore his

professional football, and naturally, Jim is looking forward to a pro
contract.
He, more than most, could use the money.
Along with his two older sisters, Jim helps support his mother who
is totally blind. His father, who ran a tobacco shop in San Jose and
was virtually sightless himself, passed away last spring. Jim worked
during high school in the summers to help out, and now assumes the
role of family provider. He is going to school on a Buck Club athletic
grant.
Not the Typical Quarterback
The quiet Bunce is not the stereotype of a football quarterback,
and the even quieter Plunkett is no where near that image.
"Yeah, I guess I'm a shy person," Jim remarked. He sat easily in a
deep chair in the TV room of the Delt house. Twenty other football
players are in the same fraternity. The season was over, and he was
relaxed.
"Now I've got some time to myself." The words were barely
audible over the din from the television and the nearby card game.
"He's not around as much as most of the other guys," remarked
Bunce, "and he's an introverted person. It's difficult to get close to
him. He's always in San Jose with either his family or Gini."
Plunkett's girl friend is a student at San Jose State. "We have been
very close for a long time," said Jim. "We have an understanding."
Again Bunce elaborated. "Although Jimmy always denies it, they
seem pretty serious. He was half-serious in discussing it with me for
the first time today."
What is in Plunkett's romantic future he will not say, but his
professional aims are not secret to anyone. "I'm looking forward to
pro ball," he commented. "I guess I've always wanted to be a pro
quarterback."
The Greatest In the Game?
If the experts are right, Jim will have his wish. Opposing coaches
call him the best pure passer that has ever played the game, and the
toughest quarterback college football has ever seen. His own coach
John Ralston, called his star "the best passer in the country . . . the
best I've ever coached ... a boy with the mental outlook of a
champion."
Even Vince Lombardi, the king of the National Football League,
said, "as it stands now, we would draft Jim over any other collegian in
the country."
The question arises, why doesn't he go to pro football now?
Academically, Plunkett is a senior, and needs to carry only a few extra
units to graduate with his class in June. But so far as football
eligibility goes, he has next year to play at Stanford. He sat out his
sophomore season as a redshirt.
This year was a great one for him. He finished as the number one
major school offensive player in the entire nation, and ranked third in
total passing. He was named on many all-star teams, and broke every
league record imaginable.
Playing next year for Stanford might only hurt his chances for a
high-paying professional offer. It will be difficult to repreat such a
statistically successful season, and there is always the chance of
serious injury, which has bothered him in the past.
But everyone agrees, it is almost certain that Jim Plunkett will be
back again next year. Ralston feels Jim gets better every year, and
waiting a while longer can only help him in the pros. "He is a gifted
athlete who improves every time out. He will have another
outstanding year," the coach said.
Bunce is puzzled as to why Plunkett would stay, but he is sure Jim
will be around next fall. "He must feel that he owes the school
something. After all, Stanford did give him a chance to play football
and make a name for himself."
Plunkett himself candidly admits that it is neither a commitment
nor a desire to improve that will keep him at Stanford. "Actually, I

haven't been approached by anyone," he said. 1 plan to talk to
people and get advice. The NCAA rules are strict on raiding colleges
for athletes, and 1 don't think I'm even on most teams' lists for this
year. But I'll do what is best for me."
Nt'\»*r Mali An Effort
It is this desire to help himself that Ralston notices most about his
quarterback. "Jim is the type that wants to improve. He throws SUO
times a day, studies the game of football, and thinks it all the time. He
has more confidence in himself everyday. He is an excellent person
who never does anything half way."
Bunce agreed with Ralston's comments and recalled an instance
when Jim was at his "all the way" best. "Onenight last spring, Jimmy
decided he was going to get drunk. It was really un typical, but once
he made up his mind, it was just like anything else-100 percent
effort.
"He went to Rat's and sat chugging pitchers until the deed was
done. Boy, did he pay for it that night!"
Aside from occasional outbursts, Plunkett tries to keep in shape.
He is physically ready for professional football He is big and very
strong for a quarterback —qualities necessary for the pounding of the
pros. He stands 6-3, weighs 20-1, and has hands huge enough to
control a football with ease.
"I guess I can throw the ball around 80 yards," he casually
remarked. There are few established pros who have that kind of
power. He shifted his sitting position in the chair and thought about
the importance of strength.
"Basically, you can throw the ball better from off balance if you're
strong, and you can play with injuries."
Last year, when he set conference records in total offense and
passing, Plunkett played the last five games with torn knee cartilage
which required an operation. This season, although he looked fine, he
suffered pains as well. "1 had a lot of shoulder trouble all the time,
and my other knee may need surgery," he said.
"Last year, I was scared. I'd get hit and then get up and look to see
if my knee was still there. But actually, I can't complain. The linemen
really get banged up all the time. Quarterback is a soft job.."
Plunkett and Bunce worked together last summer for a
construction company to keep them in shape for the easy job of

quarterbacking. Plunkett's dark face gleamed as he said he would
survive if he never worked construction again.
When the condition of your body can mean hundreds of thousands
of dollars, you tend to take care of it. "I'm always doing something
athletic," remarked Jim. "1 play a lot of basketball in the off-season
and I usually fool around with tennis, golf, handball, just about
everything." He played football, baseball and wrestling in high school.
Learned From The Community
"I'm glad I'm at Stanford. I've learned a lot besides being able to
play football. It is a difficult place for an athlete because he has to
combine sports and the classroom, but 1 know 1 ve gained a lot from
being here. I've learned from the community as well as the classes. 1
don't know whether a guy at USC could say the same thing."
Plunkett received offers from all the Pacific-8 schools as well as
Notre Dame, Navy, North Carolina, and Santa Clara.
"I really liked the Stanford recruiters," he said with a smile, "and
Coach Ralston. He was very personable. When I went to Cal, Coach
(Ray) Willsey scared me to death."
Although tilings seem to be going beautifully lor Plunkett, there
are certain disappointments along his successful trail. He was totally
snubbed in a recent Sports Illustrated story listing potential Heisman
Throhy candidates.
The article, written by Texan Dan Jenkins, showed pictures of four
junior quarterbacks (including rival UCLA's Dennis Dummit), all
ranking behind Plunkett in statistics, but did not even mention
Stanford's Mexican-American star.
The lack of national attention is bound to lose him votes in various
All-America balloting. But still, Jim Plunkett just goes on his quiet
way. His own family responsibilities are kept private, while his desire
to succeed in his chosen profession is evident to thousand s of
football fans every Saturday each fall.
"He doesn't let the publicity bother him," concludes Bunce. "He
never talks about himself personally. He's very humble and shy."
Bunce paused.
"He's amazing."


JIM PLUNKETT— Stanford's All-every tiling quarterback is looking forward to a
life of football, and currently plans to be back for the Indians next year. Last
night he was honored at the team awards banquet for his record-breaking year.
