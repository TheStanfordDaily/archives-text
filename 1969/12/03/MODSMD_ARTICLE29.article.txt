# Stanford Running Club Organized On Campus
## 
### 
For the past year a small
sporting organization has been
growing on and around the
Stanford campus. This is the
Stanford Running Club, which
now has a membership of about
twenty-five. Of these some fifteen
are active members, participating
in local AAU road races and
all-comers' meets. Other members
run less often but contribute
depth for track meets and such.
Club activities include a weekly
run, holding an official AAU race
every year, and participating in
other road runs. The weekly run is
on Sundays at 8:30 a.m., starting
on Angell Field. The pace is
leisurely and anyone is welcome
to join in. The annual race which
the club hosts is the Searsville
Lake (7.5 miles) Run in February.
Last year some 60 runners
participated.

The other road runs we have
participate; in include the Bay to
Breakers, the Dipsea, the 7 2 mile
(seven man) Lake Tahoe Relay,
the Petaluma Marathon, 10, 20,
'and 30 kilometer championships,
One Hour Run Championship in
Mill Valley, and the Rclmont
Marathon.
The last race of note was the
Berkeley to Moraga (13.9 miles)
Run. An occasional trophy, a
number of medals, and numerous
ribbons and certificates have come
out of these efforts.
Club members are looking
forward eagerly 'o the Petaluma
Marathon on December 14. Any
one wanting information or
transportation should call Ray
White (x 3052) or John Spurr
(328-81 17).
