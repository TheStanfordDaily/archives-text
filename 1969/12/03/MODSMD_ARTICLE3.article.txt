## House Backs Nixon On War 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
House overwhelmingly approved
Tuesday a resolution supporting
President Nixon's "efforts to
negotiate a just peace in
Vietnam."
The final vote was 333 to 55.
The debate was marked by
sometimes sharp criticism of
House procedures in bringing the
resolution to the floor with
amendments barred.
Rep. Donald W. Riegle, Jr.,
R-Mich., in one of the most
biting attacks on the leadership,
said he was concerned about what
was not in the resolution,
including the issues of troop
withdrawal and broadening the
South Vietnamese regime.
"But the most disturbing thing
has been the total destruction of
meaningful legislative processes by
the power structure of this House,
the leadership of both parties," he
said.
Backers of the resolution spent
a good deal of time fending off
arguments that it would be a
blank check for Nixon.
Rep. Thomas E. Morgan, D-Pa.,
chairman ofthe Foreign Affairs

Committee, told the House: "If
this were a blank check to escalate
the war, or carry it on
indefinitely, the chairman would
not be on it as a cosponsor."
Pilots Freed
PANNUNJON, Korea
(AP)â€”North Korea freed three
American helicopter crewmen
Wednesday after the United States
signed a letter of apology for their
violation of North Korean air
space.
The North Koreans had held
them for 3Vz months after their
helicopter was shot down 15 miles
north of the demilitarized zone
last Aug. 17.
In the letter of apology the
United States admitted that the
flight of the helicopter across
North Korea's frontier was a
"criminal act" in violation of the
Korean armistice. But a U.S.
Army statement issued after the
men were released repudiated the
admission, much as the U.S. Navy
did when it secured the release of
the 82 crewmen of the U.S. spy
ship Pueblo last December.

Cal Tuition
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-The
first proposed tuition in history
for University of California and
state college students is being
recommended by the
Coordinating Council for Higher
Education.
The official pronouncement
Monday said only that "student
charges should be increased
moderately."
Dr. Charles J. Hitch, University
of California president, said
Tuesday the word "moderately"
was included at his suggestion but
that the cost of education could
increase as much as $800 on some
campuses.
Even the minimum $100 figure
for colleges and $200 for the
university would force some
13,800 California students to find
some other medium of education,
council staff employees estimated.
The vote favoring tuition was
12-4, with two council members
abstaining. One of those
objecting, William Forbes of Los
Angeles, declared the increases in
student costs would "further

exclude the poor" from higher
learning.
"Why do we not honestly
equate poverty with racial
discrimination when it is so
clearly true?" he asked.
Paly Schools
PALO ALTO (APh-The board
of education here is challenging
the recent ruling by the State
Board of Education on the public
school teaching of the origin of
man.
In a resolution passed Monday
night, the local board asked the
state group to rescind its recent
ruling that science textbooks must
contain the Book of Genesis
account of the origin as well as
the Darwinian and other
competing theories.
If the ruling is not rescinded,
continued the resolution, the Palo
Alto board will join with other
school districts "to seek legislative
and/or injunctive relief."
The resolution objected to the
ruling on grounds the inclusion of
religious material in public school
teachings is unconstitutional.
