# Students Seek Counsel In Lottery Aftermath
## 
### 
The uncertainties generated by
Monday's draft lottery have
already induced many young men
in the area to seek information
from their local draft boards.
In addition, the Stanford
Selective Service counseling office
reported that it is being
"swamped" with students seeking
advice.
Both San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties' Selective Service
headquarters were flooded with
telephone calls from men
inquiring about their chances in
the lottery.
But they received a "no
comment" from the San Mateo
office supervisor, Mrs. Jessie Lee.
"We can't give any specific details
on potential inductees and our
1970 quotas until we get
confirmation from State Selective
Service headquarters in
Sacramento," explained Mrs. Lee.

Santa Clara headquarters were
so swamped with calls that the
switchboard had several people
waiting on each line for
information.
The Stanford Selective Service
counseling office had similarly
been packed by students seeking
information.
Susan Swarington, assistant to
draft counselor Alan Strain, said
that there have been "as many as
15 to 20 students waiting at one
time." Most of the questions were
concerning individual
susceptibilities to the draft.
"An individual's liability
depends on the needs of
individual boards," stated Miss
Swarington. "The local draft calls
are to be public knowledge, and a
student will have to be in close
contact with his board."
Radio Calls
Bay Area radio stations also
reported a heavy flow of
telephone inquiries about the
draft lottery.
KSFO reported that it had
handled up to 2,000 calls,
answering questions from callers
who wanted to verify birth date
drawings.
KPFA in Berkeley read the
entire list of birth dates twice
Monday night. Even so, news
director Lincoln Bergman said the
station's five telephone lines had

to be manned late into the night
answering inquiries.
The futures of Stanford men
were decided Monday night as,
one by one, the dates of their
birth were drawn in the first draft
lottery since the second World
War.
Beginning in January, potential
draftees will be called in the order
in which their birthdays were
drawn. Men in next year's draft
pool whose assigned numbers are
not reached by the end of the
year will be free from draft
liability unless there is a national
emergency.
Government officials have
stated that men whose birthdays
were among the last third of those
drawn —roughly those men with
numbers from the mid-200's
through 366-can be almost
certain to be free from the draft.
Those with birthdays drawn
among the first third will almost
surely be drafted, they have
added.
For those in the middle group,
there will be a year of
uncertainty. The higher a man's
number, the less his chance of
being taken.
A more complete discussion of
draft problems that Stanford men
will be facing is found in an article
by draft counselor Strain on page
two of today's edition.
