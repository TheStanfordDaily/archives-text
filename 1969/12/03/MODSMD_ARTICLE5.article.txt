# Ministers Charge Calley Scapegoat
## 
### 
Stanford's Dean of Chapel, B.
Davie Napier, joined with a group
of area clergymen yesterday to
protest the prosecution of Lt.
William L. Calley for his part in
last year's Song My massacre. The
clergymen charged that Calley is
being used as a scapegoat.
The group, composed of liberal
Palo Alto clergymen representing
a variety of faiths, issued a
statement on November 28,
declaring that "Lt. Calley, just as
each one of us, is responsible for
his own actions. But one man
cannot atone for the sins of a
whole nation. In the eyes of God
and man, we are accomplices to
the crimes of Vietnam and
should be so indicted." (See page
2 for complete text of the
statement.)
At a press conference Tuesday
morning held in First Lutheran
Church, Rev. Harold Varner
emphasized, "The issue is not
whether Calley is on trial. He is
just a part of what is on trial. We
are saying that the whole nation is
on trial. We must all look into the
mirror. We cannot use Calley as a
scapegoat."
Question Posed
Rev. Johnson posed the
question, "Who are the victims?"
He maintained that Calley was as
much a victim of government and
military policy as the men under
him.

In their statement, the group
rejected the argument that the
incident could be justified by
"laws of war," saying "war by
definition is complete
lawlessness."
The notion that Song My was
an isolated incident was also
rejected on the grounds that
thousands of people have been
murdered by both sides and the
particular instrument of
destruction makes little
difference.
Racism Decried
The clergymen also protested
what they termed the "racism"
involved in the incident. "If we
had seen pictures of blonde,
blue-eyed babies lying
machine-gunned in a ditch, our
revulsion would be unbearable.
We shudder when we realize that
these atrocities could surely
happen to our own children and
grandchildren. In the sustained
agony that is Vietnam, anv
atrocity has adequate precedent in
the actions of both sides."
The ecumenical group
consisted of Dean Napier, Rabbi
Sidney Akselrad, Reverend
Richard By field, Pastor Robert M.
Herhold, Pastor Rudy Johnson,
Reverend Dennis Nyberg, Father
Charles Quinn, Reverend Louis
Riley, Reverend Harold Varner,
and Reverend F. Dan ford Lion.
