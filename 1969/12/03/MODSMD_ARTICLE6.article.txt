# Pitzer: At Home And Away
## 
### SUSAN KRIEGER GREG WHITE 
After a year as Stanford's president, Kenneth Pitzer is a
man beset with pressures.
He is spending increasing amounts of time away from
the campus, often lobbying for the university's interests
or fulfilling fund-raising obligations.
At the same time, he finds himself increasingly thrust
into the self-ascribed role of campus "mediator and
persuader."
Controversy swirled around Stanford's President, even
before his arrival on campus. Complaints began with
student charges of undemocratic methods involved in his
selection.
His decision to call in police last spring to oust radical
demonstrators from a campus building placed him in the
midst of further controversy, only partially ameliorated
by his Convocation call for an end to the Vietnam war.
Although this fall has been generally peaceful, Pitzer
was again diverted from his heavy routine by another
University "crisis" when the publication of the "secret
salaries" became an issue.
Fund Drive
Today, much of the President's business keeps him
away from Stanford for long stretches of time.
Fund-raising and generating publicity for Stanford, for
example, occupy much of his time.
In order to cope with the present budget squeeze,
Pitzer is instituting a long-range financial program similar
to PACE, a fund-raising effort carried out in the early
sixties.
Alumni play a crucial role in fund-raising activities,
thereby making the handling of their complaints an
extremely critical and delicate operation. Last year's
demonstrations brought numerous threats of gift
withdrawals, making it essential for Pitzer to "make every
effort to reassure each alumnus that his gift will not be
misused."
Naturally, this wooing of alumni support requires
extensive travel on the part of the President.

The President's efforts have not all been successful, as
witnessed by a rumored $5 million gift withdrawal.
Notwithstanding these misfortunes, Pitzer notes, the total
amount of money in gifts is up this year.
The pursuit of funds is not Pitzer's sole reason for
visiting alumni throughout the country; he also attends
local alumni club meetings in an attempt to "personalize"
the University.
In attempts to maintain the University as an effective
lobby in government, Pitzer meets with legislators in both
Sacramento and Washington.
Pitzer cites the recent proposals for tax reform as issues
that demand the active communication between scholars
and lawmakers. The legislation as now formed would,
Pitzer maintains, "dry up" essential grants from
individuals and foundations, exacerbating an already
serious problem for the University.
Government Grants
Government research grants are a second example of
the crucial ties between the University and Washington,
that in turn necessitate much of Pitzer's travel. Recent
criticism of the University has centered on its alleged role
as a "research tool" of the government, especially of the
Defense Department, a role which could preempt its
concern with undergraduate education.
Last year's movement against war-related research
revealed that often the nature of this research is
determined by available funds rather than by the desires
of the researchers themselves. Pitzer, however, stated that
"we have had no particular pressure from executive
agencies."
Pitzer Absent
The President's heavy national schedule also finds him
on the board of the RAND Corporation and sitting as a
trustee of Pitzer College, in the Claremont group. Before
coming to Stanford, he was on the President's Science
Council and now maintains close contact with the
National Academy of Sciences. He also is involved in the

activities of the California Academy of Sciences and
UNESCO.
In addition, he belongs to several national
organizations that seek to improve American universities.
Pitzer still plans to devote much of his time to internal
university affairs. Anyone acquainted with the plethora of
committees at Stanford will appreciate his effort to
"attend all committee meetings" of consequence.
Delegation of Responsibility
Because of the complexity of running the University,
Pitzer shares the details of its operation with Provost
Richard Lyman. The President described the relationship
as one of an "alter ego"; he (Lyman) has authority in the
same areas of responsibility that are delegated to the
President."
Pitzer has also delegated responsibility for the
implementation of the SES reforms to Presidential
Assistant Willard Wyman.
One area of University activity to which the President
does not devote a great deal of time is direct contact with
undergraduate students. In the past he has spoken to
eating groups and occasionally does now, although he is
somewhat disenchanted with this means of
communication.
Student Representatives
Instead, he mainly relies on elected representatives,
such as the Council of Presidents and ASSU Senate, as his
channel to students.
He also keeps his door open to students, although
Presidential Assistant Fred Glover often acts as a
go-between. Few students take advantage of this
opportunity, so "Uncle Ken" remains a largely unknown
figure on campus.
After one year in the presidency, Kenneth Pitzer is
caught between the demands of the University and the
pressures and activities of the "outside world." He must
continue to balance these priorities if he is to remain an
effective leader or "persuader" within the Stanford
community.

Council and now maintains close contact with the
National Academy of Sciences. He also is involved in the

activities of the California Academy of Sciences and
UNESCO.
In addition, he belongs to several national
organizations that seek to improve American universities.
Pitzer still plans to devote much of his time to internal
university affairs. Anyone acquainted with the plethora of
committees at Stanford will appreciate his effort to
"attend all committee meetings" of consequence.
Delegation of Responsibility
Because of the complexity of running the University,
Pitzer shares the details of its operation with Provost
Richard Lyman. The President described the relationship
as one of an "alter ego"; he (Lyman) has authority in the
same areas of responsibility that are delegated to the
President."
Pitzer has also delegated responsibility for the
implementation of the SES reforms to Presidential
Assistant Willard Wyman.
One area of University activity to which the President
does not devote a great deal of time is direct contact with
undergraduate students. In the past he has spoken to
eating groups and occasionally does now, although he is
somewhat disenchanted with this means of
communication.
Student Representatives
Instead, he mainly relies on elected representatives,
such as the Council of Presidents and ASSU Senate, as his
channel to students.
He also keeps his door open to students, although
Presidential Assistant Fred Glover often acts as a
go-between. Few students take advantage of this
opportunity, so "Uncle Ken" remains a largely unknown
figure on campus.
After one year in the presidency, Kenneth Pitzer is
caught between the demands of the University and the
pressures and activities of the "outside world." He must
continue to balance these priorities if he is to remain an
effective leader or "persuader" within the Stanford
community.

After a year as Stanford's president, Kenneth Pitzer is a
man beset with pressures.
He is spending increasing amounts of time away from
the campus, often lobbying for the university's interests
or fulfilling fund-raising obligations.
At the same time, he finds himself increasingly thrust
into the self-ascribed role of campus "mediator and
persuader."
Controversy swirled around Stanford's President, even
before his arrival on campus. Complaints began with
student charges of undemocratic methods involved in his
selection.
His decision to call in police last spring to oust radical
demonstrators from a campus building placed him in the
midst of further controversy, only partially ameliorated
by his Convocation call for an end to the Vietnam war.
Although this fall has been generally peaceful, Pitzer
was again diverted from his heavy routine by another
University "crisis" when the publication of the "secret
salaries" became an issue.
Fund Drive
Today, much of the President's business keeps him
away from Stanford for long stretches of time.
Fund-raising and generating publicity for Stanford, for
example, occupy much of his time.
In order to cope with the present budget squeeze,
Pitzer is instituting a long-range financial program similar
to PACE, a fund-raising effort carried out in the early
sixties.
Alumni play a crucial role in fund-raising activities,
thereby making the handling of their complaints an
extremely critical and delicate operation. Last year's
demonstrations brought numerous threats of gift
withdrawals, making it essential for Pitzer to "make every
effort to reassure each alumnus that his gift will not be
misused."
Naturally, this wooing of alumni support requires
extensive travel on the part of the President.

The President's efforts have not all been successful, as
witnessed by a rumored $5 million gift withdrawal.
Notwithstanding these misfortunes, Pitzer notes, the total
amount of money in gifts is up this year.
The pursuit of funds is not Pitzer's sole reason for
visiting alumni throughout the country; he also attends
local alumni club meetings in an attempt to "personalize"
the University.
In attempts to maintain the University as an effective
lobby in government, Pitzer meets with legislators in both
Sacramento and Washington.
Pitzer cites the recent proposals for tax reform as issues
that demand the active communication between scholars
and lawmakers. The legislation as now formed would,
Pitzer maintains, "dry up" essential grants from
individuals and foundations, exacerbating an already
serious problem for the University.
Government Grants
Government research grants are a second example of
the crucial ties between the University and Washington,
that in turn necessitate much of Pitzer's travel. Recent
criticism of the University has centered on its alleged role
as a "research tool" of the government, especially of the
Defense Department, a role which could preempt its
concern with undergraduate education.
Last year's movement against war-related research
revealed that often the nature of this research is
determined by available funds rather than by the desires
of the researchers themselves. Pitzer, however, stated that
"we have had no particular pressure from executive
agencies."

The President's heavy national schedule also finds him

misused."
Naturally, this wooing of alumni support requires
extensive travel on the part of the President.

The President's efforts have not all been successful, as
witnessed by a rumored $5 million gift withdrawal.
Notwithstanding these misfortunes, Pitzer notes, the total
amount of money in gifts is up this year.
The pursuit of funds is not Pitzer's sole reason for
visiting alumni throughout the country; he also attends
local alumni club meetings in an attempt to "personalize"
the University.
In attempts to maintain the University as an effective
lobby in government, Pitzer meets with legislators in both
Sacramento and Washington.
Pitzer cites the recent proposals for tax reform as issues
that demand the active communication between scholars
and lawmakers. The legislation as now formed would,
Pitzer maintains, "dry up" essential grants from
individuals and foundations, exacerbating an already
serious problem for the University.
Government Grants
Government research grants are a second example of
the crucial ties between the University and Washington,
that in turn necessitate much of Pitzer's travel. Recent
criticism of the University has centered on its alleged role
as a "research tool" of the government, especially of the
Defense Department, a role which could preempt its
concern with undergraduate education.
Last year's movement against war-related research
revealed that often the nature of this research is
determined by available funds rather than by the desires
of the researchers themselves. Pitzer, however, stated that
"we have had no particular pressure from executive
agencies."
Pitzer Absent
The President's heavy national schedule also finds him
on the board of the RAND Corporation and sitting as a
trustee of Pitzer College, in the Claremont group. Before
coming to Stanford, he was on the President's Science
Council and now maintains close contact with the
National Academy of Sciences. He also is involved in the

activities of the California Academy of Sciences and
UNESCO.
In addition, he belongs to several national
organizations that seek to improve American universities.
Pitzer still plans to devote much of his time to internal
university affairs. Anyone acquainted with the plethora of
committees at Stanford will appreciate his effort to
"attend all committee meetings" of consequence.
Delegation of Responsibility
Because of the complexity of running the University,
Pitzer shares the details of its operation with Provost
Richard Lyman. The President described the relationship
as one of an "alter ego"; he (Lyman) has authority in the
same areas of responsibility that are delegated to the
President."
Pitzer has also delegated responsibility for the
implementation of the SES reforms to Presidential
Assistant Willard Wyman.
One area of University activity to which the President
does not devote a great deal of time is direct contact with
undergraduate students. In the past he has spoken to
eating groups and occasionally does now, although he is
somewhat disenchanted with this means of
communication.
Student Representatives
Instead, he mainly relies on elected representatives,
such as the Council of Presidents and ASSU Senate, as his
channel to students.
He also keeps his door open to students, although
Presidential Assistant Fred Glover often acts as a
go-between. Few students take advantage of this
opportunity, so "Uncle Ken" remains a largely unknown
figure on campus.
After one year in the presidency, Kenneth Pitzer is
caught between the demands of the University and the
pressures and activities of the "outside world." He must
continue to balance these priorities if he is to remain an
effective leader or "persuader" within the Stanford
community.
