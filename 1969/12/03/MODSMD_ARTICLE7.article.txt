# The 						SDS Again
## We Really Are Snobs 
### Leonard Siegel 
Vice-President Agnew recently
struck a popular chord when he
called the anti-war movement a
bunch of "effete snobs" The
American people, like myself, are
unfamiliar with the word
"effete," but everyone knows
what a snob is. And
unfortunately, those of us active
in the anti-war movement have
been cast, by our actions as well
as our position in society, as
snobs.
The peace movement began
several years ago on the college
campuses. Though it received
support from a few labor leaders
and received the tacit support of
black America, the anti-war
movement expanded largely into
upper - middle-class,
college-educated communities.
Now, at its peak—a result of the
circumstances of the war—the
movement has the sympathy or
potential support of millions
more. The question before us is
how to win allies from the
discon tended Americans that
consider us snobs.
One of the reasons the anti-war
movement has developed on he
campuses and in affluent
communities is simply that we can
"afford" to spend time or take
risks. Noting smugly how college
demonstrations confroin to the
quarter system, many working
Americans resent the fact that we

have "all that spare time." Others,
with families to support, fear
reprisal or hardship much more
than we do. Consequently, they
shy away from the anti-war
movement and the youth culture
identified with it.
Overcoming these difficulties
and expanding the base of the
anti-war movement is no easy
task. We must find ways to go to
the American people, for they will
surely not come to us. Many more
Americans than we would like to
believe are really feeling the pinch
of the war and the surrounding
economic situation. Yet they
respond to anti-war activity by
attempting to protect what
they've got, often forgetting the
role of the war in their troubles. A
sensible strategy, it seems, would
direct the anti-war movement
against visible symbols of
economic trouble as well as
symbols of American military
might.
This strategy should not be
confused with an approach
unfortunately used in many
movement leaflets or speeches. We
often try to appeal to people
merely according to their
immediate individual needs
without relating their problems to
the underlying moral and political
issues. Such a strategy does not
satisfactorily move people who
are used to hardship, and have

made sacrifices for past wars they
considered just. And if it works, it
could lead to the support of
"cheap," successful wars.
I would like to suggest that
anti-war action be directed against
General Electric during the
December Moratorium. GE is a
major war contractor I believe
that it is the major military
supplier of jet engines. But many
other corporations are similarly
involved. The significance of GE is
that the GE strike is universally
recognized by the labor
movement as a crucial battle
against the effects of war-induced
inflation. Movement involvement
against GE could begin to

overcome our image as snobs, and
hopefully begin to tie the labor
struggle against GE to the anti-war
struggle against the
" m il itary-ind u str ial-complex."
Such an action would not end the
war, nor would it automatically
win over the labor movement. It
does offer opportunities for
exposing the role of the
corporation, as well as trade union
leadership, in perpetuating the
war in Vietnam.
You don't have to be a
revolutionary to believe that the
anti-war movement should
connect itself with the labor
movement.
