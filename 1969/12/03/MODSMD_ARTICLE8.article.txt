The San Francisco Chronicle knuckled under to heavy pressure
from the people and resumed publication of the Marxian polemic
"Odd Bodkins."
Heeding the warning "Today's newspaper is tomorrow's toilet
paper," S.F.'s morning heavy chose to surrender to the moment.
All back strips (omitted "due to lack of space" according to
funnies editor Stan Arnold) were published.
"Bodkins" fill-in, the incredibly hilarious "Miss Peach,"
remained along with liberated, hang-loose "Tiffany Jones" and
moon-bound porker "Dick Tracy." To make way for the reinstated
"Odd" the Chronicle dropped dyke-industrialist "Robin Malone."
