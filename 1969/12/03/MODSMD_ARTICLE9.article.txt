The Honorable I {offman
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is unfortunate that the
Senate yielded to a handful of
pressure groups and denied the
Honorable Clement Haynsworth
the posit ion of associate justice to
the Supreme Court. Judge
Haynsworth's Judicial record is
exceptional. He would have been
an asset to the Supreme Court.
Especially in these times, when
the threat to our nation is so
great. We are in an unfriendly
world, one that the forces of
Communism seek to dominate
and presently at home they are
attempting to lead our youth
down the road to sedition and
anarchy.
One man who has shown that
he is willing to help stem this tide
of anarchy, now presides in
Federal District Court in Chicago.
Our group proposes that Pres.
Ricahrd M. Nixon take advantage
of this talent that is blooming in
Chicago. We urge the President to
appoint the Honorable Julius J.
Hoffman to the position of
associate justice of the Supreme
Court. We urge all of those who
share our admiration for Judge
Hoffman to make their feelings
known to President Nixon.

Refugees. Refugees. I am sick
and tired of hearing about
refugees.
The United States accepted
thousands of refugees.
Did we pen them in horrible
camps, make them live on a dole
for 21 years, or forbid them to
seek employment in our country?
Of course not. We are decent
human beings.
In every case each refugee was
helped to find a job and a home in
the United States and to become a
useful citizen.
Great Britain, too, accepted
thousands of refugees. Are they in
refugee camps for 21 years? Are
they beaten or killed if they dare
try to better their lot?
In every case, each person was
integrated into tho community
and is a useful citizen in his host
country.

The same story can be told of
Sweden, Norway, France,
Argentina, Brazil, etc. All who
sought a refuge in these countries
found help and a home.
Only in Arab lands is the
refugee not a human being, not a
person, but a thing.
The 400,000 people who fled
from invaded Israel in 1948 were
not welcomed by their own Arab
brethern. They were herded into
hovels in wretched camps by
Syria, Jordan and Egypt, those
upholders of the sanctity of life.
They were beaten or killed if they
tried to get jobs. They were not
allowed to be counted by U.N.
personnel so that their numbers
could be misrepresented.
There they have existed for 21
years unaided by their own
people, living on a dole handed
out by the United Nations.
How can the Arab leaders live
with themselves knowing that
they have blighted the lives of
400,000 people and their
descendants, now said to number
a million all told?
Big fish eats little fish and Big
Arab brother should worry over a
few hundred thousand souls if it is
politically useful to let them rot.
The Arab refugees could have
been settled twenty times over if
only an Arab could bring himself
to care for a fellow human being.
You don't have to be an Arab
to be a refugee. But heaven help
you if you are because the Arabs
will not.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We agonize that Lt. William L.
Calley, Jr. should alone by
charged with the mass murder of
109 Vietnamese men, women and
children. We believe that he is no
more guilty of murder than we
are. He was doing a job that we
paid him to do. We reject any
effort to make him our scapegoat.
We reject as specious the
argument that there are laws of
war. War by definition is complete
lawlessness. It makes no more
sense to talk about laws of war
than it does to talk about laws of
rioting.
We further reject the notion
that this was an isolated incident.
Thousands of men, women and
children have been murdered by
both sides. It matters little if the

instrument of their destruction
was a machine gun, artillary or a
bomb.
Lt. Calley's chief mistake was
in not ordering an air strike on the
village. Had children been burned
alive by napalm, as in fact they
have, instead of being shot,
nothing would have been said
officially.
Some of us served in World
War 11. We tried to believe that
there was something about
Americans that was not true
about Germans or Japanese. We
tried to believe that there was a
spirit of decency and mercy in us
that affected even our actions in
war. Any such belief has long ago
been torn to shreds by Vietnam.
As citizens and taxpayers, we are
in exactly the same position as the
Germans who were silent when
Hitler put men, women, and
children into the gas ovens.
We also confess our racism. If
we had seen pictures of blonde,
blue-eyed babies lying machine
gunned in a ditch, our revulsion
would be unbearable. We shudder
when we realize that these
atrocities could surely happen to
our own children and
grandchildren. In the sustained
agony that is Vietnam, any
atrocity has adequate precedent in
the actions of both sides.
Lt. Calley, just as each one of
us, is responsible for his own
actions. But one man cannot
atone for the sins of a whole
nation. In the eyes of God and
man, we are accomplices to the
crimes of Vietnam and should be
so indicted.

We agonize that Lt. William L.
Calley, Jr. should alone by
charged with the mass murder of
109 Vietnamese men, women and
children. We believe that he is no
more guilty of murder than we
are. He was doing a job that we
paid him to do. We reject any
effort to make him our scapegoat.
We reject as specious the
argument that there are laws of
war. War by definition is complete
lawlessness. It makes no more
sense to talk about laws of war
than it does to talk about laws of
rioting.
We further reject the notion
that this was an isolated incident.
Thousands of men, women and
children have been murdered by
both sides. It matters little if the

instrument of their destruction
was a machine gun, artillary or a
bomb.
Lt. Calley's chief mistake was
in not ordering an air strike on the
village. Had children been burned
alive by napalm, as in fact they
have, instead of being shot,
nothing would have been said
officially.
Some of us served in World
War 11. We tried to believe that
there was something about
Americans that was not true
about Germans or Japanese. We
tried to believe that there was a
spirit of decency and mercy in us
that affected even our actions in
war. Any such belief has long ago
been torn to shreds by Vietnam.
As citizens and taxpayers, we are
in exactly the same position as the
Germans who were silent when
Hitler put men, women, and
children into the gas ovens.
We also confess our racism. If
we had seen pictures of blonde,
blue-eyed babies lying machine
gunned in a ditch, our revulsion
would be unbearable. We shudder
when we realize that these
atrocities could surely happen to
our own children and
grandchildren. In the sustained
agony that is Vietnam, any
atrocity has adequate precedent in
the actions of both sides.
Lt. Calley, just as each one of

It is unfortunate that the

the posit ion of associate justice to

Haynsworth's Judicial record is
exceptional. He would have been
an asset to the Supreme Court.
Especially in these times, when
the threat to our nation is so
great. We are in an unfriendly
world, one that the forces of

anarchy.
One man who has shown that
he is willing to help stem this tide

Refugees. Refugees. I am sick
and tired of hearing about
refugees.
The United States accepted
thousands of refugees.
Did we pen them in horrible
camps, make them live on a dole
for 21 years, or forbid them to
seek employment in our country?
Of course not. We are decent
human beings.
In every case each refugee was
helped to find a job and a home in
the United States and to become a
useful citizen.
Great Britain, too, accepted
thousands of refugees. Are they in
refugee camps for 21 years? Are
they beaten or killed if they dare
try to better their lot?
In every case, each person was
integrated into tho community
and is a useful citizen in his host
country.

The same story can be told of
Sweden, Norway, France,
Argentina, Brazil, etc. All who
sought a refuge in these countries
found help and a home.
Only in Arab lands is the
refugee not a human being, not a
person, but a thing.
The 400,000 people who fled
from invaded Israel in 1948 were
not welcomed by their own Arab
brethern. They were herded into
hovels in wretched camps by
Syria, Jordan and Egypt, those
upholders of the sanctity of life.
They were beaten or killed if they
tried to get jobs. They were not
allowed to be counted by U.N.
personnel so that their numbers
could be misrepresented.
There they have existed for 21
years unaided by their own
people, living on a dole handed
out by the United Nations.
How can the Arab leaders live
with themselves knowing that
they have blighted the lives of
400,000 people and their
descendants, now said to number
a million all told?
Big fish eats little fish and Big
Arab brother should worry over a
few hundred thousand souls if it is
politically useful to let them rot.
The Arab refugees could have
been settled twenty times over if
only an Arab could bring himself
to care for a fellow human being.
You don't have to be an Arab
to be a refugee. But heaven help
you if you are because the Arabs
will not.
