# Senate Endorses Pitzer's BYU Stand
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate last night
passed a resolution endorsing
President Pitzer's decision to
suspend all Stanford activities
with Brigham Young University.
The resolution stated that
Pitzer had taken a courageous
action, acting on the basis "of a
Code of Honor rather than
political expediency." Only
Senators Witt and Shoch voted
against the motion.
An amendment to the
resolution, proposed by Sentor
Witt, stated that "we still await
his first public action as regards to
militarism and imperialism in this
country, an area in whith he has
shown no courage." It was
defeated decisively.
Another major topic of
discussion at last night's meeting
was the ASSU budget. The
sources of controversy were funds
granted to certain ASSU
organizations, such as Cardinals
Board and Axe Comm., before the
formal approval of the budget.
Senate Chairman David Edwards
announced that the Senate was
powerless to reclaim funds already
spent by the organizations. The
Senate could however reconsider

money that had been allocated
but not spent.
The formal consideration of the
budget will be completed by the
Senate at meetings on Monday and
Thursday of next week.
In other actions the Senate
approved the appointments made
by the Committee on
Nominations to the Committee on
Research of Academic Council,
the Committee on Public Events,
the Advisory Committee to the
Dean of Students and the
Committee on Foreign Studies
Programs of Academic Council.
The nominations to the
Committee on Research and the
Committee on Foreign Studies
Programs were the subject of
heated controversy, with alternate
nominations being proposed by
Senators Witt and Braunstein.
