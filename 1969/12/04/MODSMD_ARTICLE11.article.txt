# Rough Draft
## Effects Of Lottery 
### Alan Strain 
Here are some further questions
which have been raised during the
past few days about the effects of
the draft lottery. If you need
information about your own
situation, drop in at the Special
Services Office, 324 Old Union.
Counselors are also available to
discuss the draft at any time with
living or eating groups.
What number do 1 liave to have
to be absolutely safe?
No number is "absolutely
safe." The opinions that have
been published about which
numbers are safe and which
numbers are not are based not
only on manpower figures which
are only estimates but also on the
assumptions that there is a
uniform distribution of birthdates
and that quotas are equitably
assigned among boards. Neither of
these assumptions is necessarily
true especially with respect to
small local boards. In the past a
few boards have had to virtually
exhaust their available manpower
from 19 to 26 to meet their
quotas. Such boards may
conceivably reach very high
numbers to fill their quotas under
the lottery. Other boards may fill
their quotas from relatively low
numbers. The new procedures will
dramatize whatever inequities do
exist in the assignment of local
board quotas. What all this means,
of course, is that you have to
watch your own local board to see
how far they move down the list
from month to month to fill their
quotas. Generalities which may be
true for the country as a whole
may not apply to your own
particular board.
In reading the new regulations

published in the DAILY on
Tuesday, I noticed that no
reference is made to men with
I-O's. Does the lottery apply to
conscientious objectors?
Yes, it does. The new sections
of the regulations designate those
people who are to be ordered for
induction. Since c.o.'s are not
ordered for induction they are not
mentioned. However, section
1660.20 (d) provides that work
orders for c.o.'s shall not be issued
"prior to the time that the
registrant would have been
ordered to report for induction if
he has not been in Class 1-0 . .
So the local board must follow
the same order of call in issuing a
work order as they do in sending
an induction order.
How possible is it for me to
control when I take my chances in
the priority selection group?
That depends who you are and
what possibilities for deferment
are open to you. If you are able to
be in college for at least four years
that obviously gives you a choice
of up to four or five years in
which you could take your
chances in the pool. But the guy
who can't afford to go to college,
or who can't qualify for college or
some other deferable program, or
who doesn't have easy access to
information about the draft and
his alternatives within it, has s
very little control over when he
can join the draftables.
I have just been classified I-A
and will be in the lottery group
this next year, but I think I may
be medically disqualified. If I am
classified I-Y after a pre-induction
physical while subject to the

lottery, aam 1 then out of the
draft?
No, only out of the priority
selection group for as long as you
have the I-Y. If you are examined
again a year later, say, and found
acceptible you are immediately
subject to call as soon as you are
again classified I-A, provided you
are not yet 26.
If I go into the priority
selection group after the first year
won't nineteen-year-olds have to
be taken before men over 19 who
have lost their deferments?
Many news stories were
misleading in stating that only
nineteen year olds would be
drafted after the first year, or that
after the first year the call would
be on a youngest first basis with
nineteen-year-olds being called
first. This is not the case. All
those in the priority selection
group for a particular year—l-A's
who became 19 during the
preceding year plus those over 19
who are no longer deferred —will
be on an equal footing and subject
to call according to the number of
their birthdate which was drawn
whenever they were in the lottery.
I have a reasonably high
number and will probably allow
myself to become I-A and take
my chances. But suppose my
number looks like it will come up
in December and I can get a
deferment then. Am I out of the
draft for good?
The only thing that matters is
satisfying your one calendar year
of liability is whether or not you
passed December 31 in class I-A
without your number being
reached by your board. You could
repeat the process you describe
several times without ever getting
out of the priority selection group
for good. So you could
conceivably be in the draftable
group for a total of severa:
calendar years.
I am a fourth year graduate
student with a 11-S deferment. 1
will be twenty-six in 1971. Do I
revert to the draftable pool after
26 because I have had a 11-S
deferment?
Unless you are a medical
student your liability ends if you
pass your twenty-sixth birthday
while 11-S.
Tomorrow: A first assessment
of the over-all effects and
implications of the lottery.
