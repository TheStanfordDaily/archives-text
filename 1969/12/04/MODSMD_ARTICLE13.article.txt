### 
A Nice Life
Editor, THE DAILY:
Heinz Eulay in the October 29
issue of the Daily, was quoted as
saying that it is important to look
for more than teaching ability in
faculty because "Just teaching is a
nice life. You have 2 ftffice hours
and a light load of classes each
week, and then you go off who
knows where." I am unclear as to
the population of teachers he is
indicting (perhaps his own), but I
feel his generalized statement is an
unfair and inaccurate reflection of
the individual who is committed
to excellence in teaching. Just as
excellence in research and/or
writing requires innovative
thought, expertise of subject
matter, and the ability to raise
timely questions, so does
excellence in teaching. Just as
excellence in research and/or
writing takes many, many hours
of soul-searching and planning, so
does excellence in teaching.
Perhaps it is true that some
teachers simply dust off last
year(s)' lesson plan and present
this content to students. But, not
the teacher who is committed to
excellence. He constantly
evaluates, revises and updates his
material so he never leaches the
same class twice. If one teaches in
a field of rapidly changing
knowledge such as mine, he has a
responsibility to the student and
to himself to review all current
literature relevant to the topic(s)
he is teaching. Approximately 5
to 10 hours of time can easily be
spent reviewing anywhere from 20
to 50 journal articles on one topic
alone for one 50-minute class.
Onece the teacher has reviewed
all pertinent literature on a given
topic, he has to decide which
information he will present in
class and which information he
can assign for outside reading.
Such decision making is not done
in a vacuum. It is thoughtful; it is
based on knowledge of the
teaching-learning process; and it is
planned in accord with carefully
defined behavioral objectives for
the class.
The lesson plan is probably the
next step of preparation for the
conscientious teacher. If he does
not believe in "parroting to"
"things" called students, he must
carefully plan how he will
introduce content in his class
which allow students to discuss
problems and to apply and
synthesize knowledge. He must
also determine how he will
evaluate whether or not the
students meet the objectives for
his class. If he decides to
introduce any kind of innovative
teaching technology, for example,
a video tape depicting an unusual
phenonmenon, the teacher will
probably spend many hours
planning and writing the script for
the videotape and many more
hours of trial taping before he is
satisfied with the result.
Assuming the teacher is part of
a teaching team, he will spend
several hours a week planning the
total course with his colleagues.
He will also attend the lectures of
his colleagues so that he can
maintain continuity of purpose
and minimal repetition
throughout the course. If our
teacher has the added
responsiblity for planning a

laboratory experience, he will
easily spend 2 to 5 hours a week
preparing for the lab and from 6
to 20 hours a week guiding
students in he laboratory. And to
the above responsibilities generous
amounts of time for counseling
students and many hours a week
for curriculum evaluation, and I
arrive at the decision that "Just
teaching'' is a gross
understatement.
The above description is a
typical week for many of us
teaching in the health professions.
The investment of TEACHING
TIME alone is frequently 50 hours
a week and at times may be as
high as 80 hours. In response to
Heinz Eulau's comment "and then
(they) go off, who knows where,"
may I inform Mr. Eulau that the
conscientious teacher goes
—to the library to study;
—to his office to think and plan;and
—to his laboratory to work.

G.E. Workers
Editor, The DAILY:
John Wyler has apparently not
been following the Womens'
Liberation Movement closely
enough, as his letter to the Daily
on Friday proves. As a woman, I
am not "concerned" about G.E.
workers out on strike, and I am
not interested in "worthy causes."
I see the struggle of women for
equality and freedom as being the

same struggle as the brothers on
the picket line in their fight
against the giant corporation: that
is the struggle " against the
corporate capitalists, the ruling
class, who are making millions in
profit from a system that is
destroying the land, the people,
the food and the air of most of
the world.
More and more Women's
Liberation groups are taking a
stand with the people of the
world who are being used,
destroyed, manipulated, held
down, and are fighting back
against the social system these
men violently perpetuate. Because
we, too, are being used—crippled
by that system.
Freedom is a collective thing.
That is why women are coming
together in groups and that is why
groups are beginning to look
beyond themselves. The guys at
G.E. that I have met thru the
Strike understand this idea of
working together, of cooperating,
even though most Stanford
students have a hard time
envisioning it. For any one of us
to be free, to be equal, we all
must be.
Socialism, John, does not mean
poverty—quite the opposite. Of
course I use dish washers and
stoves and cars, but that's
technology, not capitalism.
Capitalism is standing in the way
of full utilization of the resources

of mother earth and the human
mind. Capitalism is tearing the
land apart, rather than working
with nature; capitalism is
destroying the air and the seas,
the wildlife; capitalism has turned
our resources away from medical
care, schools, decent housing,
better working conditions, and
less work for everyone, toward
missies, rockets, guns and tanks,
and wars of profit that kill our
youth and the youth of the world.
Under capitalism profit is the
deciding factor in what is
produced and for whom. The
needs of the majority of the
people are not being met, are
being trampled. The contradiction
between the need for economic
expansion and profit and the
needs of the people of the world
to live a full, healthy life cannot
be resolved under the capitalist
system.
That is why Womens'
Liberation leads to Socialism and
socialist revolution. Socialism
means using the resources
available for serving the people,
for researching and curing cancer,
for cooperating with nature and
beautifying our surroundings, for
building not destroying, for
making all aspects of life richer
and fuller for everyone. Only
under socialism can life begin to
be beautiful, and liberated, for
women and for all people. That's
what Women's Liberation is all
about.
Carrie Sapir

Marc's Dinner
I hesitate to criticize the
Woman's Liberation Movement
for fear of being written off as a
typical male with a dominance
"hang-up." Yet since my wife
agrees with me I come forward
with the most important member
of womanhood behind or better
yet in front of me, if Carrie Sapir
would have it that way.
I would like to comment on
Carrie's view of the relationship
between capitalism and
homemaking in her related article
concerning the strike at G.E.
Homemaking is a contrived tool of
capitalism for the exploitation of
women and the maintenance of
hierarchial social system; it is a
victim of capitalism's attempt to
change our culture for its own
greedy ends.
The television and the T.V.
dinner ruined homemaking and
made it alienated labor. (Since
G.E. makes televisions as well as
exploits workers I support the
strike.) Woman's liberation need
not be liberation from the home
but should be a denial of a kind of
homemaking that American
capitalists try to get women to
accept. It is no wonder women
need liberation from the home.
What is there in the home that is
creative or fulfilling? Our system
has so mechanized and plasticized
our way of life that women are
encouraged to do little but
indulge in mindless pleasures the
system invents to keep people
busy in all the "free" time they
have as a result of labor saving
devices.
Liberation should be freedom
from the labor principle as
something we have to do, to
activity we want to do. (Why
women want to get into the male
world of business—for equality's
sake or for any reason I can't
understand. Why a male wants to
get into it I'll never know.) I must
have overestimated Marcuse's
influence on the radical
movement.
The nuclear family and this
system's sterilization of it makes
the family a very inefficient,
unsatisying group. There are at
most two people available to
handle child rearing and domestic
duties and as Sapir points out it
usually dwindles to one. Thus the
need for changing our family
structure to a more
cooperative-dynamic group. We
must not forget only Marcuse but
the contribution and importance
of the "hip pie "-communal efforts
to the building of a social
revolution.
Liberation-revolution must be
directed at the roots of the
system. This includes our mind
system constructs (via
in trospec tion-meditation-drugs--
again the gifts of bohemians
-hip pies - mystics-non-violent
revolutionaries) and the systems
around us. It is wise to carefully
analyze the system in order to
attack and recreate it. Revolution
begins at home.
