## G.E. Strike Bum Issue 
### Jim Schnieder 
The SDS has recently been
under attack for its various
indiscretions both in and out of
the University community. Such
criticism has been expressed for
many reasons, i.e., disgust with
their tactics, repulsion for their
life style, disagreement on issues,
and a desire to crush dissent. I
wish to distinguish this particular
response from those which are
made from a desire to squelch
their ideas.
The behavior of the SDS, anal
as it may be, has served to make
people re-examine and question
long standing traditions and
beliefs; that is to say, while it
revels in the passions of an
exhumed puritanical sense of
self-righteousness, it is doing the
University and society a service by
bringing to light fresh and novel
perspectives.
Lest this be construed as being
an endorsement, carte blanche, let
me be careful to reiterate the need
to reject their tactics of violence,
intimidation, misrepresentation
and opportunism.
SDS Harrassing G.E.
Rumor has it that the SDS,
under the banner of the Boycott
GE Committee, is presently
protesting the on-campus
recruitment of Stanford students
by General Electric. Without
reading its literature on the
subject, the casual observer would
probably understand why the SDS

would want to harrass any large
U.S. corporation. However after
reading its literature, one has
difficulty resisting the notion that
his intelligence has been insulted.
We could explore the idea that
the SDS has tried to create a
bogus issue by pointing to a
representative sample of its
literature: (" . . .GE workers
whose average wage is $3.25/ hr.
According to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics it now takes in the Bay
Area at least $9000/yr. for a
family of four to live decently.")
This excerpt sounds impressive
until it is realized that the GE
workers average wage is slightly
over the national average for
manufacturing production
workers (BLS Dept. of Labor
1969). Secondly, the SDS
Committee on Land Development
will no doubt be telling us more
about the exorbitant cost of living
on the Bay Area. To compare the
local cost of living with GE's
average annual hourly employee's
wage is misleading. And of course
this overlooks the fact that large
corporations take into account
geographical cost of living
differentials—GE included. And
thirdly, it is unlikely that the
average number of dependents
supported by GE employees
would exceed the national average
for size of family, especially when
considering that a substantial

number of GE's employees are
single.
But then, such an analysis
could be seen as being an unfair
effort to cloud the issue with
facts.
Three Reasons
We are asked to support the GE
strike for three reasons: 1. GE is
just plain no good and we should
hit them where it hurts. 2. We
should support the oppressed
workers, and 3. We should make
the war less profitable for GE.
The SDS attempted to convince
us of the first reason by flashing
the Ronald Reagan and Joe
McCarthy cue cards. This may be
effective in eliciting a few visceral
twitches, but it is hardly
justification for supporting the
strike. The second reason is too
contradictory to be convincing; if
the SDS was successful in getting
GE to lose or drop war contracts
(20% of its business), the workers
would be the first to cry foul.
And the third reason is the
clincher—in its efforts to make the
war less profitable for GE, the
SDS may be instrumental in
making the war more profitable
for the workers by getting them a
greater share of the "war bucks."
In recognition of SDS's recent
statements, it is with a great deal
of pleasure that I pass on to it the
Spiro T. Agnew "Whpt Did I Say
Award."

by General Electric. Without
reading its literature on the
subject, the casual observer would
probably understand why the SDS

would want to harrass any large
U.S. corporation. However after
reading its literature, one has
difficulty resisting the notion that
his intelligence has been insulted.
We could explore the idea that
the SDS has tried to create a
bogus issue by pointing to a
representative sample of its
literature: (" . . .GE workers
whose average wage is $3.25/ hr.
According to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics it now takes in the Bay
Area at least $9000/yr. for a
family of four to live decently.")
This excerpt sounds impressive
until it is realized that the GE
workers average wage is slightly
over the national average for
manufacturing production
workers (BLS Dept. of Labor
1969). Secondly, the SDS
Committee on Land Development
will no doubt be telling us more
about the exorbitant cost of living
on the Bay Area. To compare the
local cost of living with GE's
average annual hourly employee's
wage is misleading. And of course
this overlooks the fact that large
corporations take into account
geographical cost of living
differentials—GE included. And
thirdly, it is unlikely that the
average number of dependents
supported by GE employees
would exceed the national average
for size of family, especially when
considering that a substantial

number of GE's employees are
single.
But then, such an analysis
could be seen as being an unfair
effort to cloud the issue with
facts.
Three Reasons
We are asked to support the GE
strike for three reasons: 1. GE is
just plain no good and we should
hit them where it hurts. 2. We
should support the oppressed
workers, and 3. We should make
the war less profitable for GE.
The SDS attempted to convince
us of the first reason by flashing
the Ronald Reagan and Joe
McCarthy cue cards. This may be
effective in eliciting a few visceral
twitches, but it is hardly
justification for supporting the
strike. The second reason is too
contradictory to be convincing; if
the SDS was successful in getting
GE to lose or drop war contracts
(20% of its business), the workers
would be the first to cry foul.
And the third reason is the
clincher—in its efforts to make the
war less profitable for GE, the
SDS may be instrumental in
making the war more profitable
for the workers by getting them a
greater share of the "war bucks."
In recognition of SDS's recent
statements, it is with a great deal
of pleasure that I pass on to it the
Spiro T. Agnew "Whpt Did I Say
Award."
The SDS has recently been
under attack for its various
indiscretions both in and out of
the University community. Such
criticism has been expressed for
many reasons, i.e., disgust with
their tactics, repulsion for their
life style, disagreement on issues,
and a desire to crush dissent. I
wish to distinguish this particular
response from those which are
made from a desire to squelch
their ideas.
The behavior of the SDS, anal
as it may be, has served to make
people re-examine and question
long standing traditions and
beliefs; that is to say, while it
revels in the passions of an
exhumed puritanical sense of
self-righteousness, it is doing the
University and society a service by
bringing to light fresh and novel
perspectives.
Lest this be construed as being
an endorsement, carte blanche, let
me be careful to reiterate the need
to reject their tactics of violence,
intimidation, misrepresentation
and opportunism.
