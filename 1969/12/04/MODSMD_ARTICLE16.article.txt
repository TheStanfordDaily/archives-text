# Nazi Trash
## Murderous Intentions 
### Ilan Eshel 
• Mr. Tamimi's article in the
of November 20 began with
a [discussion of the contributions
ofj ex-Nazi scientists and others to
the war efforts of the Egyptians
anjd the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine. He is
critical of the comparisons with
the Nazis sometimes used to
pajrtray Arab hatred for the Jews.
It j is clear that at this point in
history it is inappropriate to
cohipare the Nazi movement with
th£ Arab national movement.
Indeed it is not necessary to
invoke such analogies in analyzing
post-World War II genocidal
aiips of the Arab regimes and
national movements. These
milrderous intentions have been
unequivocally expressed in all
Arab mass media since the
inception of the state of Israel.
Th[ese expressions became most
vidious just before the six day
war.
.'Rather than discuss the
wt(ll-publicized exhortations to
kiljing and slaughter made by
Ar|ab nationalist leaders we
emphasize the more insidious
influences at work within the
Education ministries of the
various Arab regimes. The
following are typical of the
innumerable attempts made by
Arab educators to instill into
children the hatred of Jews and
thb will to exterminate the state
of|lsrael. In a third-year teacher
twining text "Arab Islamic
History", page 48, Egyptian
Milnistry of Education and
Instruction appears:
"The prophet enlightened us
{ibout the right way to treat
them (the Jew a; and succeeded
finally in crushing the plots
they had planned. We today
must follow this way and
purify Holy Palestine from
their filth in order to bring
back peace to the Arab
homeland."
And from "Basic Syntax and
Spelling," a text for fifth year
elementary school children,
published by Ministry of
Education and Instruction of
Syijia, 1963,
"Exercise: 'We shall expel all
the Jews.'
Analyze the following
Sentences:
1. The merchant himself
travelled to the African
continent.
2. We shall expel all the Jews
from the Arab countries,"
Again, in "Modern World
History," a text for third-year
Junior High School published by
The Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan, Ministry of Education and
Instruction, 1966, on page 150:
''The Jews in Europe were
persecuted and despised
because of their corruption,
meanness and treachery."
Finjally, in "Islamic Teaching," a
text for sixth-year elementary
school, published by Syrian
Ministry of Education and
Instruction, 1966-1967, on page
169:
t 1 h e Jews always and
Everywhere dislike people
living in peace, since their rule
and domination over others
depend on the existence of

anarchy, division and
contention.
Of course we admit the
difference between the intention
and the deed. The World's
attitude toward Hitler would no
doubt have been different had he
been defeated in 1939 before
putting his program of genocide
into effect.
As to Mr. Tamimi's accusation
that Israel is using Nazi tactics in
occupying Arab territory we feel
there is no need to invoke his
"tired spectre of Nazism" to argue
that the occupation of one
country's territory by another is
bad. We agree, whether it is Arab
territory occupied by Israel in a

time of war or, for example
German territory occupied by
other powers after a war. In the
recent elections the Israelis
demonstrated that they also agree.
The only party which used as a
justification for the permanent
holding of occupied areas the
old-fashioned argument quoted by
Mr. Tamimi, "The Jews' religious
emotional and historical claim to
Israel is stronger than that of the
Arabs" lost two of its four seats in
the 120 member parliament.
The aggressive military policies
of the Arab regimes failed
dismally in 1967. Since then some
Arab politicians have begun to
claim, but only for foreign
consumption and never in their
local media, that the objective of
the current terrorism is simply a
multiracial state. Some civil rights
have even been promised to the
Jews remaining in this great
homeland. It is difficult to avoid
noting that these "progressive
promises" were first heard in July
1967 after the more aggressive
solutions had failed. It is even
more difficult to conceive of such
a state existing in peace when the
Arab participants have been
educated from early childhood
from textbooks full of such
obscenities as
"The Jews are scattered to the
ends of earth, where they lived
exiled and despised, since, by
their nature they are vile
greedy and enemies of
mankind, by their nature they
were tempted to steal a land as
asylum for their disgrace."

Ordinances Reader" page 138,

High School, published by
Syrian ministry of Education
and Instruction, 1963-1964.
Irrespective of the above, it is
difficult to accept Mr. Tamimi's
claim that the present killing and
terrorism is simply calculated to
produce a Unified Palestinian
State. Surely before imposing this
ideal of a combined nation it is
first necessary that the
components of the union be able
to live in peace independently.
Unfortunately Mr. Tamimi's
article indicated that peace is far
from the objective sought by the
side he represents.

because of their corruption,
meanness and treachery."
Finjally, in "Islamic Teaching," a
text for sixth-year elementary
school, published by Syrian
Ministry of Education and
Instruction, 1966-1967, on page
169:
t 1 h e Jews always and
Everywhere dislike people
living in peace, since their rule
and domination over others
depend on the existence of

anarchy, division and
contention.
Of course we admit the
difference between the intention
and the deed. The World's
attitude toward Hitler would no
doubt have been different had he
been defeated in 1939 before
putting his program of genocide
into effect.
As to Mr. Tamimi's accusation
that Israel is using Nazi tactics in
occupying Arab territory we feel
there is no need to invoke his
"tired spectre of Nazism" to argue
that the occupation of one
country's territory by another is
bad. We agree, whether it is Arab
territory occupied by Israel in a

time of war or, for example
German territory occupied by
other powers after a war. In the
recent elections the Israelis
demonstrated that they also agree.
The only party which used as a
justification for the permanent
holding of occupied areas the
old-fashioned argument quoted by
Mr. Tamimi, "The Jews' religious
emotional and historical claim to
Israel is stronger than that of the
Arabs" lost two of its four seats in
the 120 member parliament.
The aggressive military policies
of the Arab regimes failed
dismally in 1967. Since then some
Arab politicians have begun to
claim, but only for foreign
consumption and never in their
local media, that the objective of
the current terrorism is simply a
multiracial state. Some civil rights
have even been promised to the
Jews remaining in this great
homeland. It is difficult to avoid
noting that these "progressive
promises" were first heard in July
1967 after the more aggressive
solutions had failed. It is even
more difficult to conceive of such
a state existing in peace when the
Arab participants have been
educated from early childhood
from textbooks full of such
obscenities as
"The Jews are scattered to the
ends of earth, where they lived
exiled and despised, since, by
their nature they are vile
greedy and enemies of
mankind, by their nature they
were tempted to steal a land as
asylum for their disgrace."

Ordinances Reader" page 138,

High School, published by

and Instruction, 1963-1964.
Irrespective of the above, it is
difficult to accept Mr. Tamimi's
claim that the present killing and
terrorism is simply calculated to
produce a Unified Palestinian
State. Surely before imposing this
ideal of a combined nation it is
first necessary that the
components of the union be able
to live in peace independently.
Unfortunately Mr. Tamimi's
article indicated that peace is far
from the objective sought by the
side he represents.

'How to use the Star of David.
• Mr. Tamimi's article in the
of November 20 began with
a [discussion of the contributions
ofj ex-Nazi scientists and others to
the war efforts of the Egyptians
anjd the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine. He is
critical of the comparisons with
the Nazis sometimes used to
pajrtray Arab hatred for the Jews.
It j is clear that at this point in
history it is inappropriate to
cohipare the Nazi movement with
th£ Arab national movement.
Indeed it is not necessary to
invoke such analogies in analyzing
post-World War II genocidal
aiips of the Arab regimes and
national movements. These
milrderous intentions have been
unequivocally expressed in all
Arab mass media since the
inception of the state of Israel.
Th[ese expressions became most
vidious just before the six day
war.
.'Rather than discuss the
wt(ll-publicized exhortations to
kiljing and slaughter made by
Ar|ab nationalist leaders we
emphasize the more insidious
influences at work within the
Education ministries of the
various Arab regimes. The
following are typical of the
innumerable attempts made by
Arab educators to instill into
children the hatred of Jews and
thb will to exterminate the state
of|lsrael. In a third-year teacher
twining text "Arab Islamic
History", page 48, Egyptian
Milnistry of Education and
Instruction appears:
"The prophet enlightened us
{ibout the right way to treat
them (the Jew a; and succeeded
finally in crushing the plots
they had planned. We today
must follow this way and
purify Holy Palestine from
their filth in order to bring
back peace to the Arab
homeland."
And from "Basic Syntax and
Spelling," a text for fifth year
elementary school children,
published by Ministry of
Education and Instruction of
Syijia, 1963,
"Exercise: 'We shall expel all
the Jews.'

continent.
