# Re-Reassessments
## Domestic Capitalism 
### Ivo Banac 
(Second of Two Parts) The
Progressive Labor Party, the SDS
Worker-Student Alliance caucus
and other progressive forces
believe that masses of Black and
white workers in this country can
be won to socialist ideas and to
internationalism. We view the
current nationalist epidemic as a
setback. However, we do not
propose to remain isolated from
the nationalist movement.
There is a great deal of talk
about united front against
imperialism at Stanford.
Unfortunately, because of the
opportunist influence of the Bay
Area "Revolutionary" Union,
united front is understood as "all
unity and no struggle." Marxists
have a duty to preserve their
independent position within the
united front. They of course
"unite with" nationalist and other
forces against imperialism. But to
stop here is wrong. They must
also "struggle against" nationalism
and other bourgeois ideology
within the same united front.
We do not criticize the
Vietnamese Lao Dong (Workers)
Party leadership in southern
Vietnam because it has entered
the united front with domestic
capitalists. We criticize it because
it has consistently refused to
simultaneously "struggle against"

these lorces. Not to unmask the
domestic capitalists for what they
are, not to struggle to win masses
to socialism is to mislead the
people.
Needless to say our attitude
has nothing in common with the
position of the French
"Communist" Party or the
Algerian war, a case which Mr.
Andre dished up in order to
"prove" that PL has an identical
outlook on Vietnam. To say that
PL has an identical position in
Vietnam as the French CP had on
Algeria is to say that PL supports
U.S. aggression in Vietnam. This
of course, is sheer slander. Not
even our most vociferous "critics"
can claim that without blushing.
PL was the first group to advance
the slogan "U.S. Get Out of

Vietnam, Now!" at the same time
when the social-democratic SDS
leadership, then headed by Clark
Kissinger, still bellowed "Part of
the Way with LBJ." PL has
participated in and given
leadership to the ghetto rebellions
(Harlem and Watts) and most of
the major campus struggles
(Columbia, SF State, Harvard). It
has consistently agitated against
imperialism in the working class.
I certainly hope that these
remarks of mine will spark some
sorely needed discussion which
became impossible during the Oct.
27 panel, due to Mr. Rappaport's
clowning.

Vietnamese Lao Dong (Workers)
Party leadership in southern
Vietnam because it has entered
the united front with domestic
capitalists. We criticize it because
it has consistently refused to
simultaneously "struggle against"

these lorces. Not to unmask the
domestic capitalists for what they
are, not to struggle to win masses
to socialism is to mislead the
people.
Needless to say our attitude
has nothing in common with the
position of the French
"Communist" Party or the
Algerian war, a case which Mr.
Andre dished up in order to
"prove" that PL has an identical
outlook on Vietnam. To say that
PL has an identical position in
Vietnam as the French CP had on
Algeria is to say that PL supports
U.S. aggression in Vietnam. This
of course, is sheer slander. Not
even our most vociferous "critics"
can claim that without blushing.
PL was the first group to advance
the slogan "U.S. Get Out of

Vietnam, Now!" at the same time
when the social-democratic SDS
leadership, then headed by Clark
Kissinger, still bellowed "Part of
the Way with LBJ." PL has
participated in and given
leadership to the ghetto rebellions
(Harlem and Watts) and most of
the major campus struggles
(Columbia, SF State, Harvard). It
has consistently agitated against
imperialism in the working class.
I certainly hope that these
remarks of mine will spark some
sorely needed discussion which
became impossible during the Oct.
27 panel, due to Mr. Rappaport's
clowning.

(Second of Two Parts) The
Progressive Labor Party, the SDS
Worker-Student Alliance caucus
and other progressive forces
believe that masses of Black and
white workers in this country can
be won to socialist ideas and to
internationalism. We view the
current nationalist epidemic as a
setback. However, we do not
propose to remain isolated from
the nationalist movement.
There is a great deal of talk
about united front against
imperialism at Stanford.
Unfortunately, because of the
opportunist influence of the Bay
Area "Revolutionary" Union,
united front is understood as "all
unity and no struggle." Marxists
have a duty to preserve their
independent position within the
united front. They of course
"unite with" nationalist and other
forces against imperialism. But to
stop here is wrong. They must
also "struggle against" nationalism
and other bourgeois ideology
within the same united front.
We do not criticize the
