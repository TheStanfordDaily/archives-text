# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Choice Components 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
In my last column, I discussed
the merits of the AR-4x speakers,
and the place of speakers as one
of the two most delicate
components of a stereo set. The
other component which must he
carefuily chosen is the cartridge.
The cartridge fits into the end
of the tone arm of the turntable
and holds the stylus, or needle.
The tip of the needle vibrates in
the record groove, and these
vibrations are translated into
electro-magnetic waves by the
cartridge.
Record needles are made of
metal with a tip made of diamond
or sapphire. Diamond needles are
several orders of magnitude
better. They are shaped as
spherical cones or as elliptical
cones. These new elliptical stylii
are much better, and have been
perfected only within the last few
years.
As the tip of the needle rides in
the record groove, it scratches
away at the sides of the groove,
and the resulting vibration of the
tip produces the sound.
Theoretically, the tip touches the
sides of the groove at only two
points, but in reality, the groove
deforms as the tip passes. With old
needles having a spherical tip,
considerable contact between
diamond needle and vinyl record
occurs. Diamond being by far the
harder substance, the little edges
in the groove are sandpapered off.
These fine ridges represent the
high frequencies on the record.
Thus, after a couple of plays on a
spherical needle, these high notes
are erased forever.
An elliptical needle has the
same problems, but since the
small edges of the ellipse touch
the groove, there is less surface of
diamond touching the record. The
tip vibrates back and forth with
much less record wear.
There are at least two other
advantages to the elliptical
cartridge. Since there is less
record-needle contact, the
vibrations picked up at each
instant are from a smaller length
of record groove. This gives a
cleaner, more exact reproduction
of sound.
The second advantage "is that
stylus pressure can be reduced.
Since the needle is responding
more exactly, less force is
required to keep the stylus in the
groove. Lowering the tracking
force to below one gram will
reduce both wear on records and
wear on the needle. Both will last
longer and give better service
throughout their life.

The Stanton 500E elliptical
cartridge is rated by Consumer
Reports, an honest and impartial
organization, as the best buy in
cartridges—the most for the
money. At $25, the 500E is
certainly a bargain, but our
prospective system deserves even
better—and I would suggest the
Shure M9IE elliptical cartridge.
Selling for $40, the M9IE allows
tracking down to half a gram, and
has tip dimensions of .0002" by
.0007", which have been shown
to be optimal measurements.
Tables and Changers
The turntable or record
changer is the most obvious
component, since it is handled the
most, but it is a far less decisive
piece of equipment than the
cartridge which it houses.
A turntable must spin the
records at a stable rate which does
not fluctuate with momentary
current changes or bumps and
jars. This requires a heavy platter
(on which the records rest), a
consistent motor, and some
mechanism to keep the motor
steady. Quality is measured in
terms of small values of wow,
flutter and rumble, the last
produced by a noisy motor.
A record changer differs from a
turntable in that it has an
automatic device which plays
several records in succession,
returns the tone arm to rest after
the last record, and then shuts
itself off. Manual turntables do
none of these things, and the
money which would have been
invested in these features is spent
on perfecting the turntable itself.
Purists looking for a quality
manual turntable will find the one
made by Acoustic Research (AR)
to be superior. For most of us,
though, the automatic return
feature is important, and for these
people, 1 would recommend the
Dual 1212. Including base, the
AR-XA sells for $78, the Dual
1212 for $90.
In addition to the regular
automatic features, the Dual has
anti-skate control and a cue pause
level which lifts the tone arm
straight up. This is an especially
valuable feature if you
contemplate any taping sessions.
