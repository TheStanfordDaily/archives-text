# Cost Squeeze
## Pepsi Gains Opposition 
### ED KOHN 
Hey gang, here's a neat new
game that you can all play. The
rules are simple, little or no
investment is required, and, best
of all, it's for a worthwhile cause.

You see, the Pepsi people
decided last week that it's time to
raise the prices on their addictive
soft-drinks again—this time to
twenty cents. These twelve-ounce
cans retail for somewhere around

eleven or twelve cents each, so it's
obvious that someone is really
cleaning up off the students again.
The game itself is easy. Just
follow these simple rules that we
have carefully developed over at
Branner.
First, feed your friendly Pepsi
machine fifteen cents in exact
change. Let it fall, and then
SMASH the black bar under the
famous "Pepsi" sign as hard as
you possibly can. If you're lucky,
the machine will pay out for all its
worth—until it runs out of cans
and gets the dry heaves. We've
already reamed the machines out
three or four times.
Liberated Cola
Not only will this liberation
hurt Pepsi's and Canteen's profits,
but it will also provide freebies for
your entire house or dorm. And,
if properly attempted, you will
aid the cause of non-violence by
allowing the Pepsi machine to
coexist peacefully right next to
the other money-grabbing vending
machines.
Don't forget, if nothing
happens, you can always get your
fifteen cents back.
While we're on the subject, we
might also note that the Tresidder
Store, the student cafeteria and
the bookstore all have raised, or in
the near future will raise their
prices.
The Tresidder Store beat Pepsi
to the punch by raising their
refreshment prices early last
month. They sell Coca-Cola
products. Judging by the
prevailing prices ir Palo Alto,
the students had a good thing
going for a while, but someone
sensed the change and slammed
the door, smashing a few
marooned toes in the process.
Buddy, Can I Borrow . . .
Not to be outdone, the student
union has raised the price of its
detergent-like coffee from a dime
to fifteen cents, and has
eliminated the "free refills"
policy. This, too, came within the
last month.
And, in a move that will bring
delight to the textbook—buying
public, as well as those who
cannot get off campus during the
week to purchase supplies, the
Bookstore's Board of Managers
announced last weekend that they
were being forced to lower the
student discount from eight to
five percent. As usual, operating
costs were blamed.
Parenthetically, one might note
that Princeton University Store
gives a ten percent discount and
allows students to charge on the
equivalent of a student body card.
Perhaps it's time to do
something. We are paying for
convenience and service that just
aren't there. It would serve little
purpose to boycott the student
union or the bookstore, for their
services are already extremely
limited.
Therefore I urge one and all to
be more careful in their buying, in
order to obtain the best value for
money. Perhaps selective buying
will force PEPSICO to realize that
all that glitters is not blue, red,
and white.

public, as well as those who
cannot get off campus during the
week to purchase supplies, the
Bookstore's Board of Managers
announced last weekend that they
were being forced to lower the
student discount from eight to
five percent. As usual, operating
costs were blamed.
Parenthetically, one might note
that Princeton University Store
gives a ten percent discount and
allows students to charge on the
equivalent of a student body card.
Perhaps it's time to do
something. We are paying for
convenience and service that just
aren't there. It would serve little
purpose to boycott the student
union or the bookstore, for their
services are already extremely
limited.
Therefore I urge one and all to
be more careful in their buying, in
order to obtain the best value for
money. Perhaps selective buying
will force PEPSICO to realize that
all that glitters is not blue, red,
and white.
Hey gang, here's a neat new
game that you can all play. The
rules are simple, little or no
investment is required, and, best
of all, it's for a worthwhile cause.

You see, the Pepsi people
decided last week that it's time to
raise the prices on their addictive
soft-drinks again—this time to
twenty cents. These twelve-ounce
cans retail for somewhere around

eleven or twelve cents each, so it's
obvious that someone is really
cleaning up off the students again.
The game itself is easy. Just
follow these simple rules that we
have carefully developed over at
Branner.
First, feed your friendly Pepsi
machine fifteen cents in exact
change. Let it fall, and then
SMASH the black bar under the
famous "Pepsi" sign as hard as
you possibly can. If you're lucky,
the machine will pay out for all its
worth—until it runs out of cans
and gets the dry heaves. We've
already reamed the machines out
three or four times.
Liberated Cola
Not only will this liberation
hurt Pepsi's and Canteen's profits,
but it will also provide freebies for
your entire house or dorm. And,
if properly attempted, you will
aid the cause of non-violence by
allowing the Pepsi machine to
coexist peacefully right next to
the other money-grabbing vending
machines.
Don't forget, if nothing
happens, you can always get your
fifteen cents back.
While we're on the subject, we
might also note that the Tresidder
Store, the student cafeteria and
the bookstore all have raised, or in
the near future will raise their
prices.
The Tresidder Store beat Pepsi
to the punch by raising their
refreshment prices early last
month. They sell Coca-Cola
products. Judging by the
prevailing prices ir Palo Alto,
the students had a good thing
going for a while, but someone
sensed the change and slammed
the door, smashing a few
marooned toes in the process.
Buddy, Can I Borrow . . .
Not to be outdone, the student
union has raised the price of its
detergent-like coffee from a dime
to fifteen cents, and has
eliminated the "free refills"
policy. This, too, came within the
last month.
And, in a move that will bring
delight to the textbook—buying
