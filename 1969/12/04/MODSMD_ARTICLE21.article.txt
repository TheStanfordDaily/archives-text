# UGLY Inspector Sees More Than Just Books
## 
### SYLVIA BROWN 
One of the faces familiar to
most Stanford undergraduates, if
they happen to pass occasionally
through UGLY's doors, is that of
Desmond Meharey, who works
there every day on the ground
floor, inspecting outgoing books
to make sure they are properly
checked out.
Now something of an
institution within an institution at
Stanford, Mr. Meharey has held
almost every imagineable kind of
job in various parts of the world
before coming here.
Born in North Ireland to a
Belfast industrialist's family, he
spent World War II as a Royal Air
Force bomber pilot and flight
instructor, jobs which took him
from France to South Africa to
London's darkest days during the
Battle of Britain.
Later on, Mr. Meharey became
a resident of Canada for thirteen
years, during which time he
helped to build railroads in the far
north and worked on establishing
radio communications for nothern
logging camps and mines. He has

had a ham radio operator's license
since then.
After many years of such
varied activity, Mr. Meharey is
enjoying his contact with
Stanford students. His only
complaint is with the undergrads
who react to his routine check of
outgoing books as if they were
being frisked by the police. "I'm
clean," the favorite parting shot
of these escapees from UGLY, is
not one of his favorite phrases.
The son of diplomatic parents
who raised their children in
neither the Catholic or Protestant
churches of North Ireland, Mr.
Meharey carries this diplomacy
through in his relationships here.
He declines to comment on either
the political position of the
university or the country.
Mr. Meharey is an official
citizen of Canada, but his range of
experiences describe a person
whose perspective now takes in a
great deal of the world. Still
interested in exploring the places
he's never been, Mr. Meharey
hopes to see parts of Asia and
Australia in the next few years.
