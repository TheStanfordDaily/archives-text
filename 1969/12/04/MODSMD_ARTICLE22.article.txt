# Colonialism: Myth? Reality? Racism?
## 
### BRUCE McKAY 
A tentative and sympathetic
epitaph for Colonialism was
offered by Dr. Eric von
Kuehnelt-Leddihn in his talk
"Colonialism: Myth or Reality"
given Tuesday night as the first
presentation of the Stanford
Center for Independent Studies.
The audience of about 30 persons
was given the choice of hearing
Dr. von Kuehnelt-Leddihn speak
on Colonialism or Student
Unrest—the audience chose
Colonialism but few anticipated
the speaker's viewpoint.
By the end of the meeting,
charges of racism were flowing
freely, some student unrest had
surfaced, and the Center for
Independent Studies had become
image conscious.
Dr. von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, 60,
was born in Austria and educated
there and in Hungary. His varied
career has included teaching at
Georgetown and Fordham,
writing for newspapers in Russia,
writing novels, and world travel.
His home is in Austria but he is
currently on a world tour. He Is a
foreign contributor for the
National Review.
After pointing out that he was
an Austrian and that Austria never
ha; colonies, and that he was
speaking to Americans who even
today have colonies—in particular
the Phillipines—the speaker
proceeded to trace the origin of
colonialism and its effect on
western civilization and the world.
The discussion ranged across
the Greek colonialistic extensions
of the mother city, the Roman
Empire, the Phonecians, the
Carthiginians, Ghana, the Ivory
Coast, and the Thirteen Colonies.
Superiority, Inferiority
The speaker stated: "There are
no superior or inferior races. I do
not believe in racial superiority.
But I do content that western
civilization is superior." He
explained that IQ differences can
be seen as educational differences,
and contended that the average
intelligence of the natives of
Katanga is as low as the white

population of Algeria. "Inferior
intelligence comes from neglect
during certain critical periods in
child development." He
contended that the high IQs of
upper class Europeans could be
attributed directly to the
influence of governesses.
Dark Splotches
The main point of the talk was
that the record of Colonialism is
really a quite creditable one, that
although there are "undoubtedly
a few dark splotches" the overall
record is nothing to be ashamed
of. "Christianity has brought
humaneness," claimed the
speaker, and he cited a practice in
New Guinea in which a mother
must give birth to her first child in
the wilderness, bash its brains out
against a tree, and adopt as her
"child" a piglet from the first sow
to come and eat at the remains of
her own baby. He observed that at
times Europeans had also
practiced horrors but that the
influence of Christianity—spread
by Colonialism—had led to more
humaneness. Questions about the
Inquisition arose from the floor
later.
Dr. von Kuehnelt-Leddihn also
contended that "the widespread
notion that colonies were
profitable is false," and that "with
the exception of a few cases in the
Caribbean" all colonies came to
be operating in the red. He
reported that the majority of
Africans that he has questioned if
they would prefer that the
Europeans had never set foot on
the dark continent reply "No."
Decolonialization
Current activities at
decolonialization were seen to be
a competition between Moscow
and Washington to see who can be
more anti-colonial. The results
havy been a pressure on
decolonialization which is
regrettable.
The Belgian plans for the
Congo were taken as an example

where a sound approach to
providing education starting at the
elementary level and working up
would have been quite effective if
it were not for the pressure to
speed up the process, particularly
on the part of the French.
France's colonial policies were
criticized: "The French are
investing more per capita in
colonies than Americans, but their
intent is to establish French as the
world language, as opposed to
English, or even Spanish."
The closing remarks were a
plea for balance. "I do not think
that there is reason to be ashamed
of past Colonial practice. There
has been some cruelty and there
are darkspots, sure, but we must
strike a balance. The gift of
western civilization is nothing to
be ashamed of."
Racism
Questions directed to the
speaker quickly moved from the
points stated in the talk to those
which were implied but not stated
and to points which had been
ignored. Feelings ran high. One
listener stood and said. "I charge
that you are a racist. And that
you have very carefully played on
elements in your speech to
develop racist ideas." Many
agreed, a few did not; an elderly
man who had arrived with the
speaker claimed, "There's nothing
I hate more than a racist. And I
feel sorry for him (the person who
made the original charge) because
he is a racist." Some complained
that the whole element of
ne o - colonialism had been
overlooked, others questioned the
unprofitability of colonies, and
the misuses of Christianity were
raised. Voices rose, tempers
flared, and finally someone felt
compelled to yell out, "This is a
lecture, not a goddam boxing
match!" In a few moments the
building's public address system
intervened, the cow bell rang to
close Tresidder for the night, and
the encounter was over.
