# Paly High
## Politics Allowed 
### 
A revision in the policy
banning political activities in the
three Palo Alto district high
schools will be made following a
proposal made Monday night by
district trustees.
The proposal, made by Trustee
Bernard Oliver, that the ban on
such groups would be deleted
from the policy, but it spelled out
that organizations promoting
dissidence, violence, truancy, or
other illegal actions would not be
allowed.
The motion was presented by
Oliver in a two page memorandum
presented at the start of the
meeting before a crowd of 200.
During a recess, angry students
seized the microphone, amid
shouts of "double-talk" at the
trustees. The students charged
that the motion offered no clear
explanation of what they could or
couldn't do on high school
campuses. Board President
Preston Cutler insisted that the
twenty students return to their
seats; they did not. Cutler
announced that the trustees
would retire to executive session.
During the trustees' absence,
person after person, on both sides
of the dispute, took the
microphone to explain their
thinking. Many of the students are
members of the radical Bay Area

High School Students Union
(HSSU). A suit filed by the
organization last month, which is
still pending, attempts to overturn
the district's political group
policy.
When the trustees returned to
the meeting, the HSSU members
had taken their seats. Cutler said
that the trustees had received an
apology during their executive
session from three students "for
the disruption."
Oliver said that the
administration of the schools is to
develop a new policy and take it
before the trustees a week from
next Monday. He said the revised
policy would encompass many of
the suggestions of the students,
plus part of his.
Board member David Fletcher
indicated that student actions
could decide whether the new
revision would be revoked. He
added that while the trustees
would approve the revision, many
adults in Palo Alto would oppose
the new policy.
The present board policy,
which will remain in effect at least
two more weeks, was adopted in
January, 1968. It states in part,
"Student organizations shall not
be permitted to engage in political
advocacy or activities of a partisan
political nature.
