# Eye Witness Talk On Red Asia
## 
### 
Today and tomorrow the
Center for East Asian Studies will
sponsor two speakers with
first-hand knowledge of Asian
Communist countries.
Gerard Chaliand, is a leading
French authority on Third World
revolution, teaches political
science at a new university set up
near Paris after the revolution of
May 1968. A member of a French
committee to aid Vietnam, he
spent 5 weeks in North Vietnam
making a detailed study of
regional and village reorganization
in response to the American
bombing. His book, Peasants of
North Vietnam and the War, has
just been published by Penguin
paperbacks. Chaliand has also
published books on Algeria and

the surprisingly successful
revolution in Portugese Guinea.
He believes in the importance of
ideology and political
organization for a successful
revolution, and is highly critical of
the theory of revolution
popularized by his countryman
Regis Debray.
Chaliand will offer two
lecturers at Stanford: "Life in
Rural North Vietnam,
1954-1965" at 4:15 this
afternoon in 274 Tresidder, and
"War in the Villages: North
Vietnam under the Bombing," at
8:00 tonight in 274 Tresidder.
Neale Hunter, an Australian
who taught English in Shanghai
from 1965 to 1967 will give a
lecture on "The Cultural
Revolution" tomorrow, Dec. 5, at
4:15. Mr. Hunter and his wife got ,
their jobs at the Shanghai Foreign
Languages Institute through a
want ad in a British newspaper.
When the Cultural Revolution
reached Shanghai all classes
stopped as the students began to
write "big character posters"
critical of the Communist Party
bureaucracy and the whole
educational system. Shanghai
polarized as 60 different groups of
radical and conservative Red
Guards tried to win support. Mr.
Hunter's students were among the
conservatives, while his wife's
students came from poorer
peasant background and joined
the radicals. Since leaving China,
the Hunters have been lecturing
and writing in the U.S. in an
effort to give a more accurate
report of a situation generally
distorted by the American press.
He taught a section of a new
radical course at Harvard, and
recently has been lecturing
extensively to Church groups. His
most recent book, Shanghai
Journal, is available in the
Stanford bookstore.


PROSPECTS OF A CON
TEMPORARY NOVELIST will be
outlined by Jerzy kosinski today at
4:15 in TMU Small Lounge. Kosinski is
the winner of the 1969 National Book
Award in Fiction. He came to this
country from Poland in 1957 and has
received a number of major awards and
fellowships. Starting in 1970 he will be
"author in residence" at Princeton
University.

Neale Hunter, an Australian
who taught English in Shanghai
from 1965 to 1967 will give a
lecture on "The Cultural
Revolution" tomorrow, Dec. 5, at
4:15. Mr. Hunter and his wife got ,
their jobs at the Shanghai Foreign
Languages Institute through a
want ad in a British newspaper.
When the Cultural Revolution
reached Shanghai all classes
stopped as the students began to
write "big character posters"
critical of the Communist Party
bureaucracy and the whole
educational system. Shanghai
polarized as 60 different groups of
radical and conservative Red
Guards tried to win support. Mr.
Hunter's students were among the
conservatives, while his wife's
students came from poorer
peasant background and joined
the radicals. Since leaving China,
the Hunters have been lecturing
and writing in the U.S. in an
effort to give a more accurate
report of a situation generally
distorted by the American press.
He taught a section of a new
radical course at Harvard, and
recently has been lecturing
extensively to Church groups. His
most recent book, Shanghai
Journal, is available in the
Stanford bookstore.

University.
Today and tomorrow the
Center for East Asian Studies will

first-hand knowledge of Asian
Communist countries.
