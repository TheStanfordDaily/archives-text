# Social Responsibility
## Business is Changing 
### PHIL REVZIN 
"Business is doing more today
than ever before in the area of
social responsibility, and getting
criticized more than ever for not
doing enough," commented
Business School Dean Arjay Miller
Tuesday night before a group of
students at the business school.
After a short talk on the social
responsibilities of the business
sector, Miller answered questions
from the group. The informal
session was organized by the
Student Management Internship
Program, an organization which
helps place students in summer
jobs in industry.
Dean Miller noted that there
were two main trends developing
in the business world. The

attitude of business is changing,
and more is being expected of the
private sector, he said.
Miller, who left a
Vice-President's position at Ford
Motor Company to come to
Stanford, detailed Ford's
participation in finding jobs for
blacks from the ghettos of
Detroit. Following the 1967
Detroit riots, he detailed, Ford
instituted a concentrated
recruiting program which resulted
in the hiring of 6000 workers
from the ghetto.
This hiring program was just a
part of Ford's effort, he said,
which included organizing a
company Department of Urban
Affairs to supervise the job of
upgrading opportunities for blacks
in phases of the Ford organization

such as franchizing and sales
management.
Ford also helped organize the
Economic Development Agency, a
private concern which helps
obtain loans, gives advice, and
attracts business for new
black-owned businesses.
Widening Gap
Commenting on business's role
in the "revolution of rising
expectations," Miller said that the
gap is widening between what
business can do, and what
business is being called upon to
accomplish.
"The magnitude of the
problems exceeds the response
which can be reasonably expected
from business, without undue
risks being incurred," the Dean
stated.
In order to better attack the
problem, the "ground rules must
be changed, and the private sector
must be turned on to public
problems. A reordering of
national goals and priorities,
which can't be accomplished
under the present rules, is
necessary," he continued.
Miller suggested the
establishment of a "National
Goals Institute" as a mechanism
to evaluate American priorities.
He envisions this institute as an
''information service for
Congress," which would conduct
research encompassing all sectors
of society, and issue reports as an
aid to congressional
decision-making.
Advisory Group
The main tasks of this advisory
group would be to predict
increases in nationwide
production, and then predict the
claims on this production,
recommending possible areas
where resources should be
allocated.
Miller touched on the role of
industry in the area of housing,
saying that corporations, with
government subsidies, could play
a large role in developing means of
handling this problem.
He concluded his presentation
by saying that "we must train
ourselves to tackle problems no
only through idealism, but also
through education."
In response to questions from
the floor, Dean Miller said that in
regard to problems such as
pollution due to automobile
exhaust fumes, the government
should set definite pollution
guidelines, and let industry
respond to meet these guidelines.

"Business is doing more today
than ever before in the area of
social responsibility, and getting
criticized more than ever for not
doing enough," commented
Business School Dean Arjay Miller
Tuesday night before a group of
students at the business school.
After a short talk on the social
responsibilities of the business
sector, Miller answered questions
from the group. The informal
session was organized by the
Student Management Internship
Program, an organization which
helps place students in summer
jobs in industry.
Dean Miller noted that there
were two main trends developing
in the business world. The

attitude of business is changing,
and more is being expected of the
private sector, he said.
Miller, who left a
Vice-President's position at Ford
Motor Company to come to
Stanford, detailed Ford's
participation in finding jobs for
blacks from the ghettos of
Detroit. Following the 1967
Detroit riots, he detailed, Ford
instituted a concentrated
recruiting program which resulted
in the hiring of 6000 workers
from the ghetto.
This hiring program was just a
part of Ford's effort, he said,
which included organizing a
company Department of Urban
Affairs to supervise the job of
upgrading opportunities for blacks
in phases of the Ford organization

such as franchizing and sales
management.
Ford also helped organize the
Economic Development Agency, a
private concern which helps
obtain loans, gives advice, and
attracts business for new
black-owned businesses.
Widening Gap
Commenting on business's role
in the "revolution of rising
expectations," Miller said that the
gap is widening between what
business can do, and what
business is being called upon to
accomplish.
"The magnitude of the
problems exceeds the response
which can be reasonably expected
from business, without undue
risks being incurred," the Dean
stated.
In order to better attack the
problem, the "ground rules must
be changed, and the private sector
must be turned on to public
problems. A reordering of
national goals and priorities,
which can't be accomplished
under the present rules, is
necessary," he continued.
Miller suggested the
establishment of a "National
Goals Institute" as a mechanism
to evaluate American priorities.
He envisions this institute as an
''information service for
Congress," which would conduct
research encompassing all sectors
of society, and issue reports as an
aid to congressional
decision-making.
Advisory Group
The main tasks of this advisory
group would be to predict
increases in nationwide
production, and then predict the
claims on this production,
recommending possible areas
where resources should be
allocated.
Miller touched on the role of
industry in the area of housing,
saying that corporations, with
government subsidies, could play
a large role in developing means of
handling this problem.
He concluded his presentation
by saying that "we must train
ourselves to tackle problems no
only through idealism, but also
through education."
In response to questions from
the floor, Dean Miller said that in
regard to problems such as
pollution due to automobile
exhaust fumes, the government
should set definite pollution
guidelines, and let industry
respond to meet these guidelines.
