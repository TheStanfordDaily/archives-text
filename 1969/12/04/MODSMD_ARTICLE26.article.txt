# 'If You're Not Violent Today, You Are Sick'
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
"I'm here to tell you that
you're full of shit," retorted the
little man in the front of the
auditorium. "That curiosity
business, that's sixteenth
century."
And so it went for hours. An
overflow crowd of 200 listened,
laughed, and tensed as Dr.
Husain Chung, master of the
psychodrama marathon, delivered
an attack on psychiatry and
psychotherapy.
There were no psychiatrists
present; at least none that would
step forward. A few medical
sLudents planning on a future in
the field were in evidence, while
the rest of the crowd consisted of
other medical students, faculty,
and assorted interested students
and citizens.
"I'm a math freak," said one
freshman waiting for the doctor's
arrival. "I think this is going to be
really interesting."

And it was. People eame and
went, but the good doctor
managed to hold them spellbound
until the necessity of dorm dinner
hours precipitated a mass exodus.
His arrival heralded by the
strains of Bob Dylan's, "The
Times They Are A'Changing," Dr.
Chung threw himself into the
fray, "I'm here because I think
psychiatry is obsolete. It's not in
with the times ... it would have
done Freud well, the
Puritans . . . but I don't think its
cool (for today). The
headshrinkers are copping out
because they're afraid to change."
You 're Sick
In harsh tones, he let the
crowd have it, "Not feeling things
is a copout. If you've been a silent
majority, you've been a sick silent
majority. If you're not violent
today you are sick ... if you are
not violent with the injustices
around you you're sick."
Touching briefly on Alcatraz,
and on the rage of Indians,
Orientals, Mexicans, blacks, and
white women, he concluded that,
"It's not all love, it's not all
happy, but rage sure makes
sense."
He practices what he preaches.
Asked by a member of the
audience what the fundamental
difference between himself and a
psychiatrist would be, he replied,
"If there's a chick and she's
running off the mouth with a lot
of bullshit, then I'd hit her."
A sample of his work
demonstrated the same point.
Playing an Asian student visiting a
psychiatrist, he demonstrated the
inability of a "huadshrinker" to
help with the problems of rage.
Psycliodrama
Turning ther *o his own form

of psychodrama-a marathon
encounter lasting upwards of
thirty hoursâ€”he and a group of
helpers acted out the aggressions,
hostilities, and desires of people
who have been face to face for
hours. The action was swift,
fierce, and not always amusing.
"I just put up with this guy for
three hours of bullshit," Chung
said, to one of the participants.
"Am I going to have to go
through the same thing with you
now?"
One of the dramatists objected
to the crowd, "Why all the people
staring at us?" And so it went.
Chung's point is clear: "A lot
of our problem is that we lay too
much faith with the
psychiatrist . . . There's a lot of
things stewing inside of you, but
you're not sick, so what do you
do?"
He noted that he doesn't see
patients for extended period.
Race
His other point is also clear,
though not as concise. Rage, he
feels, is common to all people in
our society. "Look at Dylan, his
records are selling everywhere. If
Dylan isn't rage what is?"
The demonstration marathon
drew to a close, and with it the
curses, the admonitions, and the
tension as well. The show was
over, but the idea wasn't dead.
Groups of people stood about
outside, or in the medical school
lounge, discussing what they had
just heard, and said, and felt.
"I think he's full of shit," said
one med student. "What a
quack."
"No he's not," replied the
reporter. "But then, I hate shrinks
myself."
