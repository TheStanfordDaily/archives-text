# Engineering Report Looks For Solutions
## 
### 
A new report on "Urban
Engineering," which grew out of
an earlier study at the School of
Engineering, presents blueprints
for putting engineering
technology to work on the
problems of traffic congestion,
inadequate housing, and pollution
in our cities.
The 311-page report,
completed last summer by the
Urban Engineering Study
Committee of the American
Society for Engineering
Education, was published recently
under a National Science
Foundation grant.
"The same American who
witnessed the trip to the moon
finds he cannot go downtown
conveniently," states the report.
"The underprivileged see billions
of dollars spent on what to them
are very abstract and often
irrelevant projects, while their
severe needs go seemingly
unnoticed.
"It is relatively easy to place
blame but quite difficult to find
real solutions. In all of this travail,
there lies a new challenge to
engineering, .science, and the
entire technological community."
To meet this challenge, the
report urges the development of
"interdisciplinary systems
engineering research" in
universities, and presents a broad
survey of what has been done and
should be done to find new
solutions to urban ills. It
emphasizes the team approach
and the training of "urban
engineers" to apply modern
technology to improving city
transportation, housing, and
environment.
Committee members for the
study were Profs. Dwight M.

Baumann of MIT, Bruce B.
Lusignan of Stanford, and
Stephen L. Dickerson of Georgia
Tech. Graduate students William
Hafferty of Stanford, Richard
Hess of Georgia Tech, and Robert
McGregor of MIT staffed the
study.
Their study was "in many
respects" a follow-up of a
preliminary study directed by
Stanford Visiting Prof. William
Bollay in the summer of 1968.
Graduate students Edward J.
Jaramillo Jr. and George A.
Kladnick staffed this study, which
also was financed by the National
Science Foundation.
Based on the report's
guidelines, a six-month
interdisciplinary study of San
Francisco housing and urban
development will be given as a
special course beginning in
January, officials announced. The
course will involve faculty
members and students in
medicine, law, business, the
humanities, physical and social
sciences as well as various
engineering departments.
"The problems of the city cut
across traditional professional
interests and abilities," says the
report. "The effective 'urban
engineer' will of necessity expand
his capabilities, not only into
related engineering and physical
science disciplines, but into the
social sciences, law, and
administrative sciences as well.
"As our society seeks to
reallocate its resources, it will be
important that workable
technological solutions and
technologists capable of changing
their theories into reality become
available."

Committee members for the
study were Profs. Dwight M.

Baumann of MIT, Bruce B.
Lusignan of Stanford, and
Stephen L. Dickerson of Georgia
Tech. Graduate students William
Hafferty of Stanford, Richard
Hess of Georgia Tech, and Robert
McGregor of MIT staffed the
study.
Their study was "in many
respects" a follow-up of a
preliminary study directed by
Stanford Visiting Prof. William
Bollay in the summer of 1968.
Graduate students Edward J.
Jaramillo Jr. and George A.
Kladnick staffed this study, which
also was financed by the National
Science Foundation.
Based on the report's
guidelines, a six-month
interdisciplinary study of San
Francisco housing and urban
development will be given as a
special course beginning in
January, officials announced. The
course will involve faculty
members and students in
medicine, law, business, the
humanities, physical and social
sciences as well as various
engineering departments.
"The problems of the city cut
across traditional professional
interests and abilities," says the
report. "The effective 'urban
engineer' will of necessity expand
his capabilities, not only into
related engineering and physical
science disciplines, but into the
social sciences, law, and
administrative sciences as well.
"As our society seeks to
reallocate its resources, it will be
important that workable
technological solutions and
technologists capable of changing
their theories into reality become
available."
A new report on "Urban
Engineering," which grew out of
an earlier study at the School of
Engineering, presents blueprints
for putting engineering
technology to work on the
problems of traffic congestion,
inadequate housing, and pollution
in our cities.
The 311-page report,
completed last summer by the
Urban Engineering Study
Committee of the American
Society for Engineering
Education, was published recently
under a National Science
Foundation grant.
"The same American who
witnessed the trip to the moon
finds he cannot go downtown
conveniently," states the report.
"The underprivileged see billions
of dollars spent on what to them
are very abstract and often
irrelevant projects, while their
severe needs go seemingly
unnoticed.
"It is relatively easy to place
blame but quite difficult to find
real solutions. In all of this travail,
there lies a new challenge to
engineering, .science, and the
entire technological community."
To meet this challenge, the
report urges the development of
"interdisciplinary systems
engineering research" in
universities, and presents a broad
survey of what has been done and
should be done to find new
solutions to urban ills. It
emphasizes the team approach
and the training of "urban
engineers" to apply modern
technology to improving city
transportation, housing, and
environment.
