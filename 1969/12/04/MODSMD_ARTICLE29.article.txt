# Indians Coast By Spartans
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
In their home opener last night
at Roscoe Maples Pavilion, the
Stanford basketball team coasted
by the San Jose State Spartans
84-72. The Indians continued the
hot shooting they had shown in
their narrow 96-94 loss to Utah as

they made 37 out of 75 for a 49.3
field goal percentage. The Indians
also avoided the foul problems
which accounted for their loss to
Utah.
Leading the scoring for the
Indians was guard Dennis O'Neill
who hit on 9 of 18 field goals and

one free throw for 19 points.
Following O'Neill in the scoring
column were Claude Terry and
Fred Green with 16 and 15
respectively.
The Spartans hit on only 27 of
73 field goal attempts for a poor
37% figure. Their leading scorer
was forward Coby Dietrick who
picked up 15. Center Bernie
Veasey added fourteen more.
The Indians started off
extremely slowly, but they took a
14-12 lead with 12:51 remaining
in the first half and they were
never headed the rest of the way.
Led by the shooting of Green and
Terry, the Cards pushed out to a
commanding 43-28 halftime lead.
In the second half, Stanford
continued its sizzling shooting
performance as they moved out to
a 73-49 lead with nine minutes
left in the game. With all the
starters out of the game except
for O'Neill, the Cards lead was
gradually diminished by the
Spartans.
Throughout the entire game it
was the outstanding outside
shooting of Stanford's guards
which destroyed the Spartans.
O'Neill, Terry and Osborn
combined, made 20 out of 35
field goals, most of which were
perimeter shots.
The Indians were also
impressive on defense as their
constantly tight defense and
alertness forced the Spartans into
nineteen turnovers. Stanford also
displayed good rebounding

strength as they stayed even with
the Spartans. Leading the way for
Stanford was substitute center
Larry Rosenzweig who picked up
eight rebounds while splitting
time with Bill Palmer.
Overall the Indians shoved,
flashes of excellence on botp
offense and defense. Their fine
shooting and consistent play gave
promise for an improvement over
last year's disappointing season.
Friday night the Tribe will ha*e
to face the nationally ranked Santa
Clara Broncos. The Broncos are
led by center Dennis Awtrey and
forward Ralph Ogden. Santa Clara
also has a couple of veteran
guards. The Indians will have to
put it all together if they are to
overtake the excellent Santa Clara
team. They will have to continue
the fine shooting they have shown
in their first two games and they
will have to avoid making the
costly foul and turnover errors
which can kill a team against
someone like Santa Clara.
In a preliminary game, the San
Jose State Spartan Frosh defeated
the Stanford freshmen 75-72.
