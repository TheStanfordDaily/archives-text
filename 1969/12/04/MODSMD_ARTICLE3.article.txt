# Defense Testimony Today In SRI Trial
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Defense testimony begins today
in the SRI trial of Stanford
student John Shoch, and
non-students Mike Vawter and his
wife Jan. The three are charged
with one count each of assault
and battery arising from an
incident involving Gene Tupper,
I'alo Alto Times photographer.
Deputy District Attorneys
Craig Brown and Alex Singleton
have presented several
eye-witnesses and about a dozen
photographs in attempting to
prove the defendants guilt.
In testimony yesterday, Tupper
positively identified Shoch and
the Vawters as part of a group of
demonstrators who accousted him
at the May 16 Industrial Park
demonstration.
Tupper, the prime prosecution
witness, also testified that his
watch was temporarily lost and
that he was forced to give up his
film to the group. He said the
encounter was the most serious
incident he had been involved in
in over 20 years of work for the
Times.
Separate Incidents
Defense Attorney James
Wolpman, in his opening remarks
yesterday, said that he intends to
show that there were two separate
incidents involving Tupper. In one
incident, including the three
defendants, there was a heated
argument, but no criminal action.
Wolpman contends that Tupper is
confused and is identifying the
defendants with a later incident in
which they were not actually
involved.
An important point in the
defense argument involves the use
of photographs in identification.
The defense maintains that
Tupper has been basing his
identification on photographs he
was shown two weeks after the
incident.
Wolpman also intends to show
that the prosecution testimony is
confusing and contains
contradictory statements and
references to unrelated incidents.
According to defendant Shoch,
"The prosecution and prosecution
witnesses have completely
confused all the events of May 16.
In my opinion the entire case is a
complete fabrication, and I think
the District Attorney knows it."
Heated Discussion
According to Shoch, the three
defendants became involved in a
discussion with Tupper about the
role of a photographer at the
demonstration. "Tupper vas
unresponsive, u ncommu nica / ive,
and extremely hostile," says
Shoch. Then the discu .sion

escalated into a heated argument.
Shoch admits there may have
been body contact, but denies any
assault or battery. "We're
innocent," he says.
Other prosecution witnesses
have testified that the defendants
were in the area and involved in
other similar incidents. A 1
Magazu, photographer for the San
Jose Mercury News, said that Mrs.
Vawter smeared petroleum jelly
on his camera lens during a
separate action that day. Magazu
said that the demonstration at
Hanover and Page Mill Road was
"unlike any other I've ever been
to."
Stanford graduate student
Douglas Greene also testified that
Mrs. Vawter tried to smear
vasoline on his camera lens.
In other prosecution testimony
Stanford graduate student Claude
Long said that he had seen the
defendants among a group of
demonstrators ringing Tupper. He
also testified that each of the
defendants had touched Tupper
and that Mrs. Vawter had
"grabbed" his arm.
Pushing and Shoving
During his opening statement
Prosecutor Brown told the seven
woman, five-man jury that Tupper
at one point found himself
surrounded by the defendants. He
said that they were pressing in on
him, yelling, grabbing, pushing,
holding him by his arms and
shoulders and demanding his
camera.
The charge of assault and
battery consists of the "attempt
and ability to use violence with
intent to hurt another person." It
carries a maximum penalty of
$500 fine and six months in jail.

other similar incidents. A 1
Magazu, photographer for the San
Jose Mercury News, said that Mrs.
Vawter smeared petroleum jelly
on his camera lens during a
separate action that day. Magazu
said that the demonstration at
Hanover and Page Mill Road was
"unlike any other I've ever been
to."
Stanford graduate student
Douglas Greene also testified that
Mrs. Vawter tried to smear
vasoline on his camera lens.
In other prosecution testimony
Stanford graduate student Claude
Long said that he had seen the
defendants among a group of
demonstrators ringing Tupper. He
also testified that each of the
defendants had touched Tupper
and that Mrs. Vawter had
"grabbed" his arm.
Pushing and Shoving
During his opening statement
Prosecutor Brown told the seven
woman, five-man jury that Tupper
at one point found himself
surrounded by the defendants. He
said that they were pressing in on
him, yelling, grabbing, pushing,
holding him by his arms and
shoulders and demanding his
camera.
The charge of assault and
battery consists of the "attempt
and ability to use violence with
intent to hurt another person." It
carries a maximum penalty of
$500 fine and six months in jail.
Defense testimony begins today
in the SRI trial of Stanford
student John Shoch, and
non-students Mike Vawter and his
wife Jan. The three are charged
with one count each of assault
and battery arising from an
incident involving Gene Tupper,
I'alo Alto Times photographer.
Deputy District Attorneys
Craig Brown and Alex Singleton
have presented several
eye-witnesses and about a dozen
photographs in attempting to
prove the defendants guilt.
In testimony yesterday, Tupper
positively identified Shoch and
the Vawters as part of a group of
demonstrators who accousted him
at the May 16 Industrial Park
demonstration.
Tupper, the prime prosecution
witness, also testified that his
watch was temporarily lost and
that he was forced to give up his
film to the group. He said the
encounter was the most serious
incident he had been involved in
in over 20 years of work for the
Times.
Separate Incidents
Defense Attorney James
Wolpman, in his opening remarks
yesterday, said that he intends to
show that there were two separate
incidents involving Tupper. In one
incident, including the three
defendants, there was a heated
argument, but no criminal action.
Wolpman contends that Tupper is
confused and is identifying the
defendants with a later incident in
which they were not actually
involved.
An important point in the
defense argument involves the use
of photographs in identification.
The defense maintains that
Tupper has been basing his
identification on photographs he
was shown two weeks after the
incident.
Wolpman also intends to show
that the prosecution testimony is
confusing and contains
contradictory statements and
references to unrelated incidents.
According to defendant Shoch,
"The prosecution and prosecution
witnesses have completely
confused all the events of May 16.
In my opinion the entire case is a
complete fabrication, and I think
the District Attorney knows it."
Heated Discussion
According to Shoch, the three
defendants became involved in a
discussion with Tupper about the
role of a photographer at the
demonstration. "Tupper vas
unresponsive, u ncommu nica / ive,
and extremely hostile," says
Shoch. Then the discu .sion

escalated into a heated argument.
Shoch admits there may have
been body contact, but denies any
assault or battery. "We're
innocent," he says.
Other prosecution witnesses
have testified that the defendants
were in the area and involved in
other similar incidents. A 1
