# Greg Brock
## The 						Running Artist 
### BROOK THOMAS 
Without a doubt Greg Brock is
the best distance runner ever to
compete for a Stanford varsity
team.
As a sophomore, he set school
records at two, three, and six
miles, along with placing fifth in
the NCAA 10,000 meters.
Succumbing to numerous
respiratory illnesses in his junior
year, Brock suffered a
disappointing season. Nonetheless,
his 20th place finish in the NCAA
cross country championships
helped the Indians to their second
place standing and earned him
All-America honors.
This year, recorvered from
all traces of illness, he reaffirmed
his national stature by improving
21 seconds on last year's time and
placing ninth in the recent NCAA
meet in New York.
But such high finishes don't
come without their accompanying
disappointments. In addition to
his illness-plagued junior year, he
also experienced a poor freshman
season when he failed to improve
on his best high school times.
As a result of battling back
after each disappointment, Brock
supplanted his freshman year
feelings of mixed naivity and
cockiness with a more controlled
attitude towards running.
Aware that too many factors
beyond his control can effect his
development, Brock retains the
confidence that he will be at his
peak for the big races.
Academics and a new social and
political awareness have forced
Brock to make multiple shifts in
his life style. He attributes a large
measure of his maturing attitude
to Stanford and the intellectual
atmosphere of the school. The
result of his changing is to keep
his emphasis on competition in
proper perspective.
Even so, as for all long distance
runners. Brock must come to
terms with the inevitable
question: why dedicate so much

of your life to a seemingly
unrewarding activity?
Because if it takes "the mind of
a writer" as poet Wallace Stevens
ways, to survey the winter
landscape and "not to think of
any misery in the sound of the
wind," it certainly takes a mind of
a runner to awaken each morning
at 6:30 a.m., to run for five miles
in the cold and dark, to follow
this with ten miles of track work
in the afternoon, and to reap
pleasure from such a routine.
But for Brock, running
becomes his artistic expression.
Just as the poet has analyzed the
structural devices of rhyme,
rhythm, and meter which go to
form his poem, so has Brock
analyzed the psychological aspects
which go to form his race.
He spends long hours increasing
his control over each aspect so
that, as he breaks another
Stanford or personal record, he
gives the illusion of ease of effort.
And just as the poet's art is to
fit the elements of structure into a
finished poem, so is Brock's art
the arrangement of his workouts
in such an order so as to approach
the perfect race. However, each
race and set of circumstances
constantly varies, so, by necessity,
he must constantly modify his
arrangement.
Of course, in he end, there can
be no adequate explanation of the
physical act of running or the
exhilaration of completing a
successful work of art, as Brock so
often does. But the protagonist in
"Loneliness of the Long-distance
Runner" helps explain Brock
when, speaking of himself, he
concludes:
"It was hard to understand, and
all I knew was that you had to
run, run, run, without knowing
why you were running, but on
you went through fields you
didn't understand and into woods
that made you afraid . . .And the
winning post was no end to
it . .
