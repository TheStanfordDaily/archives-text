# Stones, Airplane Hold Free Concert
## 
### 
The impossible will happen
Saturday.
The Rolling Stones, Grateful
Dead, and the Jefferson Airplane
will headline a free concert at
Sears Point International Raceway
in Sonoma, 30 miles north of San
Francisco.
Television and recording profits
from what could well be the most
exciting Bay Area concert of the
year will go to a committee aiding
Vietnamese orphans.
The concert itself, which was
originally organized by the
Grateful Dead, will run
continuously from 10 a.m.
Saturday morning until sundown.

Other bands are expected to play
in addition to the Stones, the
Dead, and the Airplane.
To get to the race track take
either 101 or 280 to San
Francisco, cross the Golden Gate
Bridge and continue north on
Route 101. Turn right on
Highway 37 and continue until
you turn left on Route 121.
Continue on 121 and you'll
reach the speedway which is ten
miles south of Sonoma. The Sears
Point International Raceway has
parking for 40,000 cars which
Craig Murphy, owner of the track
feels will not be enough.
