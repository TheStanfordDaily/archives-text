# Christmas Eve Concert
## Fresh Focus on Dec. M-days 
### PHIL REVZIN 
After two weeks of
consolidation and retrenching of
forces, Moratorium leaders are
looking forward to a fresh focus
of activity December 12, 13, and
24th, this month's national
Moratorium days.
National Moratorium
coordinator Sam Brown will visit
Stanford Tuesday and Wednesday
to observe the Bay Area
Moratorium organization, said
John Kramer, Stanford
Moratorium leader.
Activity will commence
December 10, 11, and 12, with
meetings in precincts to decide on
community courses of action.
Stanford students are urged to
attend these precinct sessions,
according to Kramer^
Leafletting and canvassing of

businesses by community groups
will take place December 12. High
school and junior college students
will lead the leafletting of
shopping centers, and will ask
shopkeepers to display peace
decorations and place collection
cans with the theme "Christmas
for the Vietnamese."
Proceeds from the sale of
"Christmas for the Vietnamese"
Christmas cards will go to the
Moratorium, and to the
Committee of Responsibility, a
group which provides orphanages
and medical care for children in
Vietnam.
Gift Donations
Moratorium leaders are asking
concerned people to donate funds
to the Moratorium in friends'
names, rather than give Christmas
gifts this year.
A "Pedal for Peace" bicycle
parade is scheduled for Saturday
December 13, in which junior
high school students will ride
from the EI Camino Park to White
Plaza to hold a rally.
A town meeting will be held at
7:30 p.m. the 13th, at the First
Methodist Church of Palo Alto.
Speakers have not as yet been set,
but David Ridenhour, credited
with disclosing the story of the
My Lai massacre, is tentatively
scheduled.
Bay Area Activity
Elsewhere in the Bay Area,
plans call for rallies and
community discussions of topics
related to the war, according to
deposed Berkeley student body
president Dan Siegel. A
symposium for G.l.s and veterans
to speak out against the war will
be held Sunday at Oakland
Technical High School.
The emphasis of the December
24th activity will be on home
community organizing by
vacationing students. Church
services with special peace themes,
leafletting, and peace caroling are
among the activities scheduled for
the Bay Area.

Stanford Moratorium leaders
are planning to organize in the
dormatories before the holidays,
to provide students with material
and ideas to aid hometown
organizing.
Transportation Leaflet ting
Students will be asked to pass
out leaflets on the busses, trains,
or planes they use to get home.
Packets of material will be
available at the ASSU office
December 12th.
The Moratorium committee
will sponsor a benefit concert in
the Los Angeles Colliseum the
evening of the 24th. Groups
scheduled to appear are Crosby,
Stills, Nash, and Young,
Creedence Clearwater Revival,
Donovan, and tentatively, the
Rolling Stones. Admission will be
$2.50, with G.l.s admitted free.
Another group which will be
active this month is the newly
formed loc?l chapter of the
Business Executives Move for
Peace, which includes
approximately 50 executives of
Industrial Park corporations who
signed a statement calling for "no
reprisals" against employees who
wish to participate in peace
demonstrations.

According to Kramer, the
Moratorium now can boast the
largest political organization, in
terms of number of workers, in
the Bay Area. A total of 150
peace centers have been
established within a 20 mile radius
of Stanford, Kramer said. These
peace centers consist of reading
libraries and places for discussion.
"The Bay Area Moratorium now
has twice as many workers as both
major political parties combined,
and has become a model for
organizations across the nation,"
Kramer commented.
Broadened Base
The organization is now at the
point where it could broaden its
base to encompass community
political action in addition to
protests. "The Moratorium will
seek to establish alternate
institutions, such as free legal and
medical clinics and high school
community centers. We will also
seek to make high schools more
responsive to the needs of the
community," Kramer added.
"Sixty percent of the decisions
which directly affect our lives are
made locally. We need to make
people aware that institutions
close to home must be changed,"
Kramer said.


COMMUNITY—PIans for this month's Moratorium are progressing with the hope that it will be as successful as
November's. While last month's activities focused on mass demonstrations such as the march to the Industrial Park,
shown above, this month will see Moratorium's emphasis switch to person to person contact, and canvassing.

signed a statement calling for "no
reprisals" against employees who
wish to participate in peace
demonstrations.

According to Kramer, the
Moratorium now can boast the
largest political organization, in
terms of number of workers, in
the Bay Area. A total of 150
peace centers have been
established within a 20 mile radius
of Stanford, Kramer said. These
peace centers consist of reading
libraries and places for discussion.
"The Bay Area Moratorium now
has twice as many workers as both
major political parties combined,
and has become a model for
organizations across the nation,"
Kramer commented.
Broadened Base
The organization is now at the
point where it could broaden its
base to encompass community
political action in addition to
protests. "The Moratorium will
seek to establish alternate
institutions, such as free legal and
medical clinics and high school
community centers. We will also
seek to make high schools more
responsive to the needs of the
community," Kramer added.
"Sixty percent of the decisions
which directly affect our lives are
made locally. We need to make
people aware that institutions
close to home must be changed,"
Kramer said.


COMMUNITY—PIans for this month's Moratorium are progressing with the hope that it will be as successful as
November's. While last month's activities focused on mass demonstrations such as the march to the Industrial Park,
shown above, this month will see Moratorium's emphasis switch to person to person contact, and canvassing.
After two weeks of
consolidation and retrenching of
forces, Moratorium leaders are
looking forward to a fresh focus
of activity December 12, 13, and
24th, this month's national
Moratorium days.
National Moratorium
coordinator Sam Brown will visit
Stanford Tuesday and Wednesday
to observe the Bay Area
Moratorium organization, said
John Kramer, Stanford
Moratorium leader.
Activity will commence
December 10, 11, and 12, with
meetings in precincts to decide on
community courses of action.
Stanford students are urged to
attend these precinct sessions,
according to Kramer^
Leafletting and canvassing of

businesses by community groups
will take place December 12. High
school and junior college students
will lead the leafletting of
shopping centers, and will ask
shopkeepers to display peace
decorations and place collection
cans with the theme "Christmas
for the Vietnamese."
Proceeds from the sale of
"Christmas for the Vietnamese"
Christmas cards will go to the
Moratorium, and to the
Committee of Responsibility, a
group which provides orphanages
and medical care for children in
Vietnam.
Gift Donations
Moratorium leaders are asking
concerned people to donate funds
to the Moratorium in friends'
names, rather than give Christmas
gifts this year.
A "Pedal for Peace" bicycle
parade is scheduled for Saturday
December 13, in which junior
high school students will ride
from the EI Camino Park to White
Plaza to hold a rally.
A town meeting will be held at
7:30 p.m. the 13th, at the First
Methodist Church of Palo Alto.
Speakers have not as yet been set,
but David Ridenhour, credited
with disclosing the story of the
My Lai massacre, is tentatively
scheduled.
Bay Area Activity
Elsewhere in the Bay Area,
plans call for rallies and
community discussions of topics
related to the war, according to
deposed Berkeley student body
president Dan Siegel. A
symposium for G.l.s and veterans
to speak out against the war will
be held Sunday at Oakland
Technical High School.
The emphasis of the December
24th activity will be on home
community organizing by
vacationing students. Church
services with special peace themes,
leafletting, and peace caroling are
among the activities scheduled for
the Bay Area.

Stanford Moratorium leaders
are planning to organize in the
dormatories before the holidays,
to provide students with material
and ideas to aid hometown
organizing.
Transportation Leaflet ting
Students will be asked to pass
out leaflets on the busses, trains,
or planes they use to get home.
Packets of material will be
available at the ASSU office
December 12th.
The Moratorium committee
will sponsor a benefit concert in
the Los Angeles Colliseum the
evening of the 24th. Groups
scheduled to appear are Crosby,
Stills, Nash, and Young,
Creedence Clearwater Revival,
Donovan, and tentatively, the
Rolling Stones. Admission will be
$2.50, with G.l.s admitted free.
Another group which will be
active this month is the newly
formed loc?l chapter of the
Business Executives Move for
Peace, which includes
approximately 50 executives of

community discussions of topics
related to the war, according to
deposed Berkeley student body
president Dan Siegel. A
symposium for G.l.s and veterans
to speak out against the war will
be held Sunday at Oakland
Technical High School.
The emphasis of the December
24th activity will be on home
community organizing by
vacationing students. Church
services with special peace themes,
leafletting, and peace caroling are
among the activities scheduled for
the Bay Area.

Stanford Moratorium leaders
are planning to organize in the
dormatories before the holidays,
to provide students with material
and ideas to aid hometown
organizing.
Transportation Leaflet ting
Students will be asked to pass
out leaflets on the busses, trains,
or planes they use to get home.
Packets of material will be
available at the ASSU office
December 12th.
The Moratorium committee
will sponsor a benefit concert in
the Los Angeles Colliseum the
evening of the 24th. Groups
scheduled to appear are Crosby,
Stills, Nash, and Young,
Creedence Clearwater Revival,
Donovan, and tentatively, the
Rolling Stones. Admission will be
$2.50, with G.l.s admitted free.
Another group which will be
active this month is the newly
formed loc?l chapter of the
Business Executives Move for
Peace, which includes
approximately 50 executives of
Industrial Park corporations who
signed a statement calling for "no
reprisals" against employees who
wish to participate in peace
demonstrations.

According to Kramer, the
Moratorium now can boast the
largest political organization, in
terms of number of workers, in
the Bay Area. A total of 150
peace centers have been
established within a 20 mile radius
of Stanford, Kramer said. These
peace centers consist of reading
libraries and places for discussion.
"The Bay Area Moratorium now
has twice as many workers as both
major political parties combined,
and has become a model for
organizations across the nation,"
Kramer commented.
Broadened Base
The organization is now at the
point where it could broaden its
base to encompass community
political action in addition to
protests. "The Moratorium will
seek to establish alternate
institutions, such as free legal and
medical clinics and high school
community centers. We will also
seek to make high schools more
responsive to the needs of the
community," Kramer added.
"Sixty percent of the decisions
which directly affect our lives are
made locally. We need to make
people aware that institutions
close to home must be changed,"
Kramer said.


COMMUNITY—PIans for this month's Moratorium are progressing with the hope that it will be as successful as
November's. While last month's activities focused on mass demonstrations such as the march to the Industrial Park,
shown above, this month will see Moratorium's emphasis switch to person to person contact, and canvassing.
