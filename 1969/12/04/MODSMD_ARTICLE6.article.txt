# SDS Plans Move Against Recruiters
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
Representatives from General
Electric plan to conduct job
interviews in the Placement
Center today despite the promise
of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) to "interfere in
whatever way seems appropriate."
Picketing starting at 10 a.m.
will be followed by a noon rally in
White Plaza. At this rally those
intending to demonstrate will vote
on the appropriate tactics for the
afternoon demonstration.
GE is expected to recruit on
campus today only, according to a
University spokesman. It is
reported that only 15 students
have scheduled interviews with
the company's representatives.
SDS's demand that GE
management not be allowed to
recruit on campus was rejected
Tuesday by University officials.
SDS wrote President Pitzer that
these interviews constituted "the
recruitment of potential
strikebreakers" and therefore
took the management's side in the
strike.
Provost Richard Lyman, in a
statement released yesterday,
stated, "It is University policy to
allow all employers equal access
to campus job recruiting facilities.
Such facilities exist as a service to
students; needless to say no
student need avail himself of this
service unless he wishes, and any
student is free both to choose
what placement interviews he
wishes to see and to express
publicly his view as to the policies
and actions of any employer using
Stanford's facilities."
In May 1968, a campus wide
referendum among Stanford
students resulted in support of the
open recruiting policy by a vote
of 3,920 to 676, Lyman added.
Strike For Wages
Since October 27, 147,000 GE
workers have been on strike
nationwide for higher wages. SDS
sees this strike as a test case of
Nixon's anti-inflation policy.
SDS also opposes GE for its
"war-profiteering." As the third
leading defense contractor, SDS
claims that last year 20% of its
$359 million profit came from
military work.
Support Expected
At today's demonstration
members of the United Electrical
Workers Union and concerned
students from other Bay Area
colleges and high schools are
expected to attend.

The demonstration at Stanford
follows one at Berkeley two days
ago where 200 GE sympathizers
picketed the Berkeley Placement
Center. A tear gas grenade was
thrown into the building and
forced the evacuation of the
recruiter.
Sanctions that the University
could possibly use against
demonstrators include invoking
the campus disruption policy. Part
one of this policy states that "it is
a violation of University policy
for a member of the faculty, staff,
or student body to prevent or
disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or
approved activity, such
as . . . interviews."
Violations of this policy are
handled by the Stanford Judicial
Council.
Also in effect is the permanent
injunction granted after the
Encina Sit-in last spring. It applies
only to those persons actually
named and served, and enjoins
them from disrupting campus
activities.
Refuse to Comment
In attempting to clarify
students' legal rights under the
injunction served to several dozen
students last year, several lawyers
associated with the university
refused to comment. One said
that it would show a lack of
integrity to talk with the
"opposition."
However, James Wolpman, a
lawyer for the April Third
Movement, explained that if the
plaintants stay within the limits
imposed by the injunction, they
cannot be held culpable if others
do cause a disruption. Thus it is
legal for them to peacefully
picket.
An injunction can be
prosecuted in two ways. If
Stanford presses charges, there
will be contempt proceedings with
no jury. The police can decide to
prosecute it as a criminal code
violation. This entails a jury trial.
In both cases the maximum
penalty is six months in jail and a
$500 fine.
In the event that the University
tries to issue a new restraining
order on those who are not now
enjoined, this order must be
served individually or must be
read over a microphone. The
University must go to court to get
a new injunction.

GE is expected to recruit on
campus today only, according to a
University spokesman. It is
reported that only 15 students
have scheduled interviews with
the company's representatives.
SDS's demand that GE
management not be allowed to
recruit on campus was rejected
Tuesday by University officials.
SDS wrote President Pitzer that
these interviews constituted "the
recruitment of potential
strikebreakers" and therefore
took the management's side in the
strike.
Provost Richard Lyman, in a
statement released yesterday,
stated, "It is University policy to
allow all employers equal access
to campus job recruiting facilities.
Such facilities exist as a service to
students; needless to say no
student need avail himself of this
service unless he wishes, and any
student is free both to choose
what placement interviews he
wishes to see and to express
publicly his view as to the policies
and actions of any employer using
Stanford's facilities."
In May 1968, a campus wide
referendum among Stanford
students resulted in support of the
open recruiting policy by a vote
of 3,920 to 676, Lyman added.
Strike For Wages
Since October 27, 147,000 GE
workers have been on strike
nationwide for higher wages. SDS
sees this strike as a test case of
Nixon's anti-inflation policy.
SDS also opposes GE for its
"war-profiteering." As the third
leading defense contractor, SDS
claims that last year 20% of its
$359 million profit came from
military work.
Support Expected
At today's demonstration
members of the United Electrical
Workers Union and concerned
students from other Bay Area
colleges and high schools are
expected to attend.

The demonstration at Stanford
follows one at Berkeley two days
ago where 200 GE sympathizers
picketed the Berkeley Placement
Center. A tear gas grenade was
thrown into the building and
forced the evacuation of the
recruiter.
Sanctions that the University
could possibly use against
demonstrators include invoking
the campus disruption policy. Part
one of this policy states that "it is
a violation of University policy
for a member of the faculty, staff,
or student body to prevent or
disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or
approved activity, such
as . . . interviews."
Violations of this policy are
handled by the Stanford Judicial
Council.
Also in effect is the permanent
injunction granted after the
Encina Sit-in last spring. It applies
only to those persons actually
named and served, and enjoins
them from disrupting campus
activities.

injunction served to several dozen
students last year, several lawyers
