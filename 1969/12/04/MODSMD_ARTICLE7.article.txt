## People's Parking A Failure 
### 
BERKELEY (AP)-The site of
"People's Park'" remains a
veritable no-man's land despite
another milestone reached
yesterday concerning that
troubled tract.
The University of California at
Berkeley, owner of the plot,
which was a storm center of
turmoil last spring, opened the
east end of the property as a
60-place pay parking lot.

Nobody would park there.
It was like the previously
opened soccer field, basketball
court, and volleyball court at the
other end.
Nobody plays there.
Students shun the new
facilities. Dr. Andrew Jameson,
vice chancellor for student affairs,
said, "We won't force anyone to
use it."
After the lot was opened

Wednesday, a small knot of
demonstraotrs appeared briefly to
make sure no one parked.
No one tried.
Report
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
National Commission on the
Causes and Prevention of Violence
urged yesterday that federal
courts be given power to block
private groups from interfering
with "the fundamental right to
free expression" by others.
Injunctions against such actions
by governments can be obtained
in federal court, the commission
said, but "no present federal law
affords remedy for private
abridgment of First Amendment
rights."
Asserting that its proposal
would apply both to protesters
and counter-protesters, the
commission said:
"When a mob forces a
university to suspend classes, the
right of teachers to teach and
students to learn are abridged.
When a speaker is shouted down
or forced from a platform, he is
deprived of freedom to speak, and
the great majority of the audience
is deprived of freedom to listen."
The commission proposed that
President Nixon ask Congress to
give U.S. district courts power to
grant injunctions when requested
by the attorney general "or
private persons, against the
threatened or actual interference
by any person . . .with the rights
of individuals or groups to
freedom of speech, freedom of
the press, peaceful assembly and
petition for redress of grievances."
Detention Gimps
WASHINGTON (AP>-The Nixon
administration urged Congress
Wednesday to repeal a law that
authorized the government to
round up subversives and place
them in detention camps.
It noted the statute has long
been repugnant to
Japanese-Americans, some of
whom were detained during World
War 11, and has now raised fears of
impending repression against
anti-war demonstrators.

In urging repeal, Deputy Atty.
Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst
acknowledged the rumors the
statute might be invoked against
dissidents and said these "fears
and suspicions—unfounded as
they may be"—will be allayed by
removing the law from the books.
Kleindienst took the position
on behalf of the Justice
Department in a letter to
Chairman James O Eastland,
D-Miss., of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, which is considering a
bill by Sen. Daniel K. Inouye.
D-Hawaii, to repeal the measure.
