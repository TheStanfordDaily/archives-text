# Panther Chief Nabbed for Threatening Nixon
## 
### 
Charging that David Hilliard
had threatened President Nixon's
life, Secret Service agents
yesterday arrested the Black
Panther Party Chief of State for
remarks made at November's
Moratorium rally.
Hilliard, 27, of Berkeley, Calif.,
was arrested in an automobile
without incident a few hours after
a federal grand jury returned a
secret indictment, said Tom
Hanson, agent in charge of the
Secret Service here.

Hilliard was held in lieu of
$30,000 bail for a plea hearing,
tentatively set for Dec. 17 by U.S.
District Judge Stanley Weigel.
The indictment charged that
Hilliard "willfully and knowingly
did publicly .. . make certain
threats to take the life of and to
inflict bodily harm upon the
President of the United States."
Over 175,000 people heard
Hilliard's speech in Golden Gate
Park on November 15, while
others listened to it on the radio
and educational television station
KQED.
Nixon Lambasted
The exact quote for which
Hilliard was charged, according to
The Black Panther, newspaper of
the Black Panther Party, is as
follows: "This is the man that's
responsible for all the attacks on
the Black Panther Party
nationally. This is the man that
sends his vicious murderous dogs
out into the black community and
invade upon our Black Panther
Party Breakfast Programs. Destroy
food that we have for hungry kids
and expect us to accept, shit like
that idly. Fuck that
motherfucking man. We will kill
Richard Nixon. We will kill any
motherfucker that stands in the
way of our freedom. We ain't here
for no goddamned peace, because
we know that we can't have no
peace because this country was
built on war. And if you want
peace you got to fight for it."

Hilliard's attorney, Charles
Garry, argued against the amount
of bail, saying that $30,000 was
"ransom."
Billiard is anxious to fight this
charge, Garry said. "He is not
going to run away. He will show
he is innocent of any
wrongdoing."
Bail No Problem
Justice Department attorney
Victor Worheide of Washington
said Hill iard "should have no
problem raising the bail if he has
the resources of the Black Panther
Party at his disposal."
Judge Weigel declined to lower
bail, commenting that threatening
the life of the President was "a
very serious charge," The judge
said Garry could seek reduction of
bail later if circumstances warrant.
Spokesmen for the Black
Panther Party headquarters in
Oakland declined to comment as
they will issue a press statement
this morning.
The Stanford Community
Against War and Fascism stated,
"We are not surprised that David
Hilliard was arrested. It is just one
more illustration of the fart, that
the Nixon regime is
conscientiously attempting to
wipe out the Black Panther Party.
In 1774 the motto of the Sons of
Liberty was "We Dare to be
Free." David Hilliard was arrested
for saying the same thing. More
power to David. Power to the
People."

Hilliard "willfully and knowingly
did publicly .. . make certain
threats to take the life of and to
inflict bodily harm upon the
President of the United States."
Over 175,000 people heard
Hilliard's speech in Golden Gate
Park on November 15, while
others listened to it on the radio
and educational television station
KQED.
Nixon Lambasted
The exact quote for which
Hilliard was charged, according to
The Black Panther, newspaper of
the Black Panther Party, is as
follows: "This is the man that's
responsible for all the attacks on
the Black Panther Party
nationally. This is the man that
sends his vicious murderous dogs
out into the black community and
invade upon our Black Panther
Party Breakfast Programs. Destroy
food that we have for hungry kids
and expect us to accept, shit like
that idly. Fuck that
motherfucking man. We will kill
Richard Nixon. We will kill any
motherfucker that stands in the
way of our freedom. We ain't here
for no goddamned peace, because
we know that we can't have no
peace because this country was
built on war. And if you want
peace you got to fight for it."

Hilliard's attorney, Charles
Garry, argued against the amount
of bail, saying that $30,000 was
"ransom."
Billiard is anxious to fight this
charge, Garry said. "He is not
going to run away. He will show
he is innocent of any
wrongdoing."
Bail No Problem
Justice Department attorney
Victor Worheide of Washington
said Hill iard "should have no
problem raising the bail if he has
the resources of the Black Panther
Party at his disposal."
Judge Weigel declined to lower
bail, commenting that threatening
the life of the President was "a
very serious charge," The judge
said Garry could seek reduction of
bail later if circumstances warrant.
Spokesmen for the Black
Panther Party headquarters in
Oakland declined to comment as
they will issue a press statement
this morning.
The Stanford Community
Against War and Fascism stated,
"We are not surprised that David
Hilliard was arrested. It is just one
more illustration of the fart, that
the Nixon regime is
conscientiously attempting to
wipe out the Black Panther Party.
In 1774 the motto of the Sons of
Liberty was "We Dare to be
Free." David Hilliard was arrested
for saying the same thing. More
power to David. Power to the
People."
Charging that David Hilliard
had threatened President Nixon's
life, Secret Service agents
yesterday arrested the Black
Panther Party Chief of State for
remarks made at November's
Moratorium rally.
Hilliard, 27, of Berkeley, Calif.,
was arrested in an automobile
without incident a few hours after
a federal grand jury returned a
secret indictment, said Tom
Hanson, agent in charge of the
Secret Service here.

Hilliard was held in lieu of
$30,000 bail for a plea hearing,
tentatively set for Dec. 17 by U.S.
District Judge Stanley Weigel.
The indictment charged that
Hilliard "willfully and knowingly
did publicly .. . make certain
threats to take the life of and to
inflict bodily harm upon the
President of the United States."
