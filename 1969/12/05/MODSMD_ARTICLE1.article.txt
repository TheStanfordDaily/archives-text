# Radicals Fight Conservatives Over GE Picket Photographs
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
What began as an uneventful
protects against General Electric
recruiting early yesterday
afternoon turned into a slugging
melee inside Tresidder Union
between youngish protesters and
conservative Free Campus
Movement (FCM) members.
The battle flared after FCM
photographers took photographs
of the demonstrators, who were
peacefully picketing the
University Placement Center.
A number of those in the
crowd reacted angrily to the
presence of the FCM
photographers. Photos taken by
conservatives last spring are being
used in the prosecution of
students arrested in the Stanford
Research Institute
demonstrations.
About 30 of the protesters,
including a large number of area
high school students, chased a
dozen FCM members as they left
the Placement Center. The
radicals demanded that FCM
photographer Craig Ostfeld
relinquish his film. Several scuffles

ensued as the right wingers were
chased around Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and into the
ground-floor lobby of Tresidder
where the Axe is normally
displayed.
Figlit Continued
The two groups continued to
fight inside Tresidder for another
20 minutes, despite attempts by
two plainclothes Stanford Police
officers to calm the crowd. The
scuffle ended when Ostfeld's
camera was finally wrestled from
him, although the film stayed in
FCM hands and is now being
processed.
There were no serious injuries
and no arrests have as yet been
made. Newly elected Young
Republican President Roger Reed
reported cuts, bruises, a bloody
nose, and a black eye, while FCM
member Doug Greene suffered
face lacerations and a bloody
nose.
Campus reaction to the
incidents was immediate and
overwhelming. Provost Richard
Lyman said the brawling was
"truly deplorable." A petition by

two dozen campus leaders
"strongly condemned" the
fighting, and Coalition for an
Academic Community President
Jim Schnieder called on President
Kenneth Pitzer to "find the
courage to do what is necessary."
Harvey Hukari, leader of the
FCM, which is a newly-formed
splinter of Young Americans for
Freedom, said last night that his
group will move swiftly to press
assault and battery charges against
approximately 15 radicals
involved in the Tresidder struggle.
Non-Stanford Students
"The bulk of people there were
non-Stanford students," Hukari
said last night in a Daily interview.
He plans to meet with the district
attorney this afternoon to
identify their assailants through
photos taken by non-FCM
members in Tresidder.
Hukari said his group will
consult lawyers on Monday to
discuss a possible suit against the
University for failure to provide
adequate protection. FCM
members will meet with Stanford
Police Chief Tom Bell this
morning to discuss the situation.
Nearby squads of both
Stanford police and Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputies were
not called in during the melee
despite requests from FCM
members for police aid. The
deputies were on hand for a
speech by an Israeli diplomat that
attracted Arab demonstrators.
The day began with a noon
rally in White Plaza. Several
speakers outlined their cases
against GE, which is currently
embroiled in a strike dispute. The
speakers, who included workers
from San Jose and Oakland, called
for a boycott of GE products and
for an end to recruiting by the
company on campus. The
company will not recruit at
Stanford today.
After the rally, about 90
protesters picketed in front of the
Placement Center. The front door
to the building was unlocked after
the lunch hour, but it was blocked
by placards and trash cans placed
in front of the picketers.
About half a dozen students
failed to complete interviews

scheduled there between 1 and 2
p.m., according to Placement
Director Ralph Keller. None
actually attempted to enter the
building. One was scheduled for
GE, while five had planned
interviews with other firms.
University officials had previously
reaffirmed Stanford's open
recruiting policy.
Instant Crowd Reaction
Appearance of Hukari, Greene,
Ostfeld, and a number of
heavy-set FCM sympathizers
caused an immediate reaction
from a number of those in the
crowd. Feelings against the
rightists have run high among
many students since films taken
and identified by the
conservatives were used in
connection with more than 100
arrests after last May's
demonstrations.
Several scuffles broke out
almost immediately as
grey-bearded Greene began to
snap pictures. At one point he was
shoved off a three-foot ledge in an
attempt to take away the camera.
After about 15 mminutes on
the scene, the FCM group began
to leave, followed by a trail of
taunting young people, both high
school students and some
members of Students for a
Democratic Society.
A number of local high school
girls, including one identified as
Andrea Holman, daughter of
Medical School Prof. Halsted
Holman, set upon the retreating
conservatives. The girls were
joined by a half dozen youthful
males, as the two groups
continued to struggle.
Flying Wedge Formed
The fights continued while the
dozen FCM members made their
way to Tresidder, leaving a trail of
arguing, angry students.
Once in Tresidder, the rightists
formed a flying wedge around the
small-but-burly Ostfeld, who now
carried the FCM camera. Radicals
crowded in the small lobby of the
Union. They confronted the
conservatives, who had their backs
against the wall in front of the
empty Axe trophy case. The
20-minute battle for possession of
