## Merry Xmas 
### 
It wasn't really Stanford.
The mob scene that raged through White Plaza yesterday afternoon
bore no resemblance to the thoughtful pursuits of the academic
community that purportedly exists under Stanford's palm trees. But it
happened.
Yesterday, the click of a camera shutter resurrected the violent
emotions which were engendered last Spring, but which have lain
dormant all fall.
The conflict was sparked by politics, cameras and memories. But
consider this: the spectators at the Union far outnumbered the
combatants. And, unlike most of those fighting, the onlookers were
students. Watching.
Cries of 'Cool it' and the temporary hiatus in the battle effected by
Stanford Police Chief Bell had little influence on the fighters. If there
were cooler heads around, they weren't making much of an effort to
prevail. One student couldn't have done much. The few faculty who
tried to intervene were ineffectual.
Yet how many students even had thoughts of stopping the
violence? Maybe, just maybe, it was fun to have a little action after a
relatively dull quarter.
Fun like this won't last long. If students, as a part of the Stanlord
community, can't contain the violence in their midst, another group,
perhaps outside the community, won't be hesitant or recalcitrant
about "keeping the peace."
If we've done nothing, we won't be able to complain when the
opportunity to police ourselves no longer exists.
Merry Christmas.
