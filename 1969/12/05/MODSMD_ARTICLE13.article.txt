## It's A Grand Old Flag 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON —President
Nixon's promise to bring the
country together doesn't seem to
be working too well. If anything,
people are more polarized than
they've ever been before.
A friend of mine, Mrs.
Johnston, told me the other day
what happened to her when she
decided to fly the Flag on
Veterans' Day. Mrs. Johnston's
been flying the American Flag
every Veterans' Day without
receiving much comfort. But this
year her effort became the cause
celebre on the block.
The first person to mention it
was a neighbor from across the
street who congratulated her for
flying the Flag and asked her to
sign a petition to impeach Justice
William Douglas of the U.S.

Supreme Court.
Mrs. Johnston said she wasn't
interested in signing any petitions
against the Supreme Court.
Why Fly the Flag
"Then why are you flying the
American Flag?" the neighbor
demanded.
"Because it's Veterans' Day,"
she said.
"Would you be willing to go to
a rally tomorrow against teaching
sex education in the schools?" the
neighbor demanded.
Mrs. Johnston said she
wouldn't.
The neighbor said angrily,
"And I believed you were a good
American."
A little later the neighbor's son,
a college student, said, "Mrs.
Johnston, I thought you were

sympathetic to our getting out of
Vietnam."
"I am," Mrs. Johnston said.
"Then why are you flying the
American Flag?"
"Flying the American Flag has
nothing to do with my feelings on
Vietnam, Bobby. It is our Flag
and I believe it should be
displayed on national holidays."
"What about all the innocent
people whose villages have been
burned and bombed, and the
profiteering South Vietnamese
generals who have numbered bank
accounts in Switzerland?" Bobby
said.
"That has nothing to do with
the Flag."
"Only super-Hawks fly the
Flag," said Bobby, as he walked
away in a huff.

The plumber arrived to do
some work, but when he saw the
Flag he decided Mrs. Johnston
would be interested in how he felt
about "People who are on welfare
and don't do any work and who
are always waiting for handouts,
and how the protesters ought to
all be put in jail . .
It cost Mrs. Johnston an extra
$9 an hour to listen to the
plumber's political philosophy.
When Mr. Johnston came home
from work, Mrs. Johnston told
him everything tha happened
during the day.
"Don't feel bad," he told her.
"I was driving without my lights
on today and a taxi driver yelled
at me, 'If you don't like America,
why don't you go back to the
Soviet Union where you belong?"

American."
A little later the neighbor's son,
a college student, said, "Mrs.
Johnston, I thought you were

sympathetic to our getting out of
Vietnam."
"I am," Mrs. Johnston said.
"Then why are you flying the
American Flag?"
"Flying the American Flag has
nothing to do with my feelings on
Vietnam, Bobby. It is our Flag
and I believe it should be
displayed on national holidays."
"What about all the innocent
people whose villages have been
burned and bombed, and the
profiteering South Vietnamese
generals who have numbered bank
accounts in Switzerland?" Bobby
said.
"That has nothing to do with
the Flag."
"Only super-Hawks fly the
Flag," said Bobby, as he walked
away in a huff.

The plumber arrived to do
some work, but when he saw the
Flag he decided Mrs. Johnston
would be interested in how he felt
about "People who are on welfare
and don't do any work and who
are always waiting for handouts,
and how the protesters ought to
all be put in jail . .
It cost Mrs. Johnston an extra
$9 an hour to listen to the
plumber's political philosophy.
When Mr. Johnston came home
from work, Mrs. Johnston told
him everything tha happened
during the day.
"Don't feel bad," he told her.
"I was driving without my lights
on today and a taxi driver yelled
at me, 'If you don't like America,
why don't you go back to the
Soviet Union where you belong?"
WASHINGTON —President
Nixon's promise to bring the
country together doesn't seem to
be working too well. If anything,
people are more polarized than
they've ever been before.
A friend of mine, Mrs.
Johnston, told me the other day
what happened to her when she
decided to fly the Flag on
Veterans' Day. Mrs. Johnston's
been flying the American Flag
every Veterans' Day without
receiving much comfort. But this
year her effort became the cause
celebre on the block.
The first person to mention it
was a neighbor from across the
street who congratulated her for
flying the Flag and asked her to
sign a petition to impeach Justice
William Douglas of the U.S.

Supreme Court.
Mrs. Johnston said she wasn't
interested in signing any petitions
against the Supreme Court.
Why Fly the Flag
"Then why are you flying the
American Flag?" the neighbor
demanded.
"Because it's Veterans' Day,"
she said.
"Would you be willing to go to
a rally tomorrow against teaching
sex education in the schools?" the
neighbor demanded.
Mrs. Johnston said she
wouldn't.
The neighbor said angrily,
"And I believed you were a good
American."
A little later the neighbor's son,
a college student, said, "Mrs.
Johnston, I thought you were
