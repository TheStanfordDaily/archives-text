Delta Kaiwa Epsilon vs.
Sigma Chi
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter is in response to an
article by Sigma Chi in the Daily
on Dec. 3, concerning the
supposed fixing of the draft. An
analysis by the Chi Square
method of the distribution of
draft numbers below 61 will
reveal that the distribution
achieved during the lottery was
purely random. Sigmi Chi would
have you believe that because
December received 10 numbers
that were below 61, and that this
is 1/6 of the total, that the odds
against such an occurrance were 2
to 1. They are not. The Chi Square
statistical analysis that I ran gave a
number that is almost exactly
what you would expect from a
random distribution of draft
numbers below 61. In other
words, the deviation from the
expected mean value by
December is not statistically
significant.
One other thing should be
noted about the Sigma Chi data
concerning the averages for each
month. They are incorrect. The
average for December is 122, not
90.2. The average for November is
148.7, not 112.07. There are
numerous other mistakes for
monthly average figures. But,
perhaps even more important than
this is the fact that the months
themselves are out of order. July
should be third, not fifth.
September is fourth, not third.
August is fifth, not fourth.
Finally, if the lottery were
"fixed" by the drawing
procedure, in the "progressive"
fashion indicated by Sigma Chi,
then why is January eighth on the
list, instead of the expected
twelfth? If one examines the
correct data, many such
inconsistencies will be found. The
draft wasn't fixed, but can Sigma
Chi make the same claim about its
data?

Freshman Irresponsibility
Editor, THE DAILY:
In yesterday's Daily, freshman
Ed Kohn described the
money-grubbing tactics of Pepsico
and Canteen who have raised the
price of soft drinks to 20 cents
per can. He also presented the
technique which he and his
Brothers have used to
gain revenge ior i!»i g.-'ss
injustice—damaging the : " no
and stealing uruuvs.

As a Stern resident, I also was
very distressed to see the price of
soda pop go up 33%, and I also at
first assumed that Canteen was
exploiting us poor students. In
fact, I am ashamed to admit that
my first gut reaction to this
situation was to write Canteen,
threatening to unplug their ice
cream machines if they didn't
lower prices.
It then occurred to me that
maybe a smarter thing to do
would be to go into competition
with them, installing a Coke
machine right next to each of
theirs, and selling mine for only
14 cents. I contacted the Business
Office to see if this would violate
the University's contract with
Canteen. It was then that I
learned that the decision to raise
prices was made not by Canteen
or Pepsi, but by the Tresidder
Union Board. Canteen, I was told,
would be willing to sell drinks for
15 cents, but was instructed to
raise prices by Tresidder who
receives most or all—l don't know
which—of the extra profit.
So to Mr. Kohn and his
Freshman Buddies, I would
suggest at least a tiny amount of
research before the vandalism is
initiated. Also, if their goal is
really to lower prices, and not just
to run amuck, they should appeal
to the Tresidder Union
Board—Mr. Duffy's office is
probably a good place to
start—rather than stealing drinks
and damaging machines which
raises the overhead of the
operation, and might make the 20
cent price inevitable.

Coyotes
Editor, THE DAILY:
Boyd Smith's column in the
Daily (November 26) reiterates
the University's position on land
development and Coyote Hill
carefully. The greatest
shortcoming of this statement is
not in any misrepresentation of
fact as much as its lack of
recognition of new considerations.
References are made, for example,
to the master plan developed in
the early 19505. There is,
however, no acknowledgement
that the whole framework or
thinking about land development
may have changed since that time.
Mr. Smith's outline of the
University's philosophy continues
to reflect a philosophy of land
developmopt th;it had its origins
wstcrn noimci 1

we have looked at social and
human problems. This view might
be called constructive
expansionism in its Stanford
version. Put more simply, it is an
attitude of "If you have a
problem, find some empty space
and build a new institution to
handle the problem" In the
1950s the industrial park seemed
a wise solution to the problems of
a developing military need for
advanced electronic technology
and the university's need for
unrestricted income. In the late
1960s social problems such as
inadequate low income housing in
the mid-peninsula area are being
fed into the same formula: build
federally-assisted housing units on
empty university land. While this
may make considerable sense as
thy university attempts to balance
its social priorities, it also reflects
the old philosophy of land
development. This philosophy
rests on values and events in the
past rather than anticipations of
the future. It is in this area of
future effects that Mr. Smith's
statement falls short.
Let me give a simple example
pertinent to the question of the
moratorium on Coyote Hill
development. The University has
decided to act in the area of low
income housing because the
development of the industrial
park generated thousands of new
jobs across the economic
spectrum. High rental and housing
costs in the Palo Alto area forced
both students and university
employees as well as industrial
park workers below the
managerial level to commute from
considerable distances. The Board
of Trustees' commitment for an
initial low income housing unit
would approximate four hundred
units, roughly ten percent of the
Palo Alto housing deficit. This
already limited contribution to
the housing picture would
undoubtedly be wiped out by the
additional jobs created in the
Coyote Hill extension of the
industrial park. Thus Mr. Smiths
statement that, "The low-income
housing proposal ... is in no way
endangered by Stanford land
development," is inaccurate il
seen in the wider context of the
intent of the housing proposal.
Mr. Smith also argues that a
moratorium on land chosen for
resarch park use a decade ago
would be "not only unfair, it,
quite likely would be illegal." He
does not make it clear how such a
moratorium would be illegal or
unfair, unless the momentum of
1-1 1 development itself has some
•! sanctity, lie emphasizes the

tastefulness and rigid aesthetic
considerations that limit lot
development in the industrial park
and especially Coyote Hill. While I
am delighted that it is possible to
construct industrial buildings
tastefully I question whether this
argument actually responds to
conservationist concerns. It is
pleasant to drive past tastefully
landscaped industrial buildings
rather than ugly ones, but it must
be said that aside from the
occasional visual experience
the preserved land has little use.
Has the University ever
considered, for example,
negotiating with industries that
they pool the unused land for
some usable park function? The
preserved top of Coyote Hill will
be totally inaccessible for human
use even in its preserved state.
Since industry obviously expends
considerable amounts on the
landscaping in the industrial park
I wonder whether it would be so
difficult to convince future
developers to pool land and
landscaping expenditure for
usable hiking, picnic areas for the
public or the university
community?
Mr. Smith also argues that
industrial land development is
necessitated by the tax burden of
land not put to academic use. I
would ask, how thoroughly have
academic uses been explored for
the now-taxed land? Has the
University ever lobbied with the
taxing governmental units for
exemption or modification of its
tax burden? More critically, it
could b" asked, to whit extent
has the >ng existence of a master
plan m; eit possible not to devise
ways of protecting they's
y's land and avoiding
high tax payments?
In sum, while one cannot find
fault with the University's
position as stated by Mr. Smith on
the basis of events in the past, one
can point to the future in which
peoplp will ask, "Why did they
not Ufok ahead? Why could they
not, in the universities at least,
have pooled the many resources
available to science and
scholarship and anticipated the
effects of present actions on
future events? Why in the
protected environment of the
university, and the smaller scale of
problems it faces compared to
larger society, could they not have
experimented with new ideas,
found a beginning for solulions to
living in a human ecology that
began to run out of space?"
