# Rough Draft
## Instant Analysis 
### Alan Strain ALAN STRAIN 
At the risk of being just
another commentator offering
instant analysis of Administration
actions, I should like to hazard a
guess or two about the effects of
President Nixon's "random
selection method" and what it
will mean in the long run.
From the beginning of the
Nixon Administration the draft
has been an issue of which it took
careful note. The campaign efforts
of the Young Republicans in
many states were built around
smiling posters of candidate
Nixon captioned "Oppose the
Draft? Vote for Nixon!" During
the past year the President was
clearly concerned about the state
of affairs on college campuses and
aware of the central part the draft
played in the disenchantment of
college students. Last May
Nixon delivered a major
presidential message on the draft,
calling for its repeal but proposing
some immediate changes. This fall
he moved quickly to cool off the
draft issue on campuses. First
there was the executive order
granting induction postponements
for the full academic year to
graduate students, then drastic
reductions in draft calls and the
announcement that General
Hershey, the national symbol of
the draft, would step down
February first. Finally, the
President pushed the lottery
through Congress with
unexpected speed.
During these months the draft
as an oppressive issue did indeed
seem to recede. While the
uncertainty and anxiety of many
individuals remained high, the
mood on campuses was hopeful,
attesting to the human tendency
to prefer new problems to old
ones or to believe that anything is
likely to be better than the evil
which now afflicts us.
Now that the lottery is an
accomplished fact, however, it
seems to me doubtful that its
effects are going to be what either
the students, or presumably the
Administration, hoped they
would be. True, the lottery
removed a particular kind of
uncertainty for those with very
high or very low numbers. But for
those with high numbers, the
certainty of not being drafted not
only produced joy and relief, but
uneasiness and even guilt because
of the close friends or roommates
who were nailed in the same
drawing that set them free. For
men drawing low numbers the
certainty of being called has
produced an unforseen level of
concern and evasive activity which
indicates that the channeling
effect of the draft will not
disappear, but rather intensify for
these men. The rest, perhaps the
majority of men, are as uncertain
and subject to paranoia and
channeling as ever.
Overnight Reality
In addition, the draft has
overnight become real to
thousands of addilic tal men,
judging from the avalanche of
men who descended on anyone
believed to know something about
the workings of the draft and the
grounds for deferment or
exemption. Up till now the draft
was for many college students a

vague and troubling shadow which
they hoped would fade away
before it enveloped them.
Suddenly it is a hard fact of life.
In his presidential message on
the draft, Nixon noted that
"present policies extend the
period during which young people
come to look upon Government
processes as particularly
arbitrary," and argued that a
random selection method would
"reduce the period of prime draft
vulnerability—and the uncertainty
that accompanies it—from seven
years to one year, so that the
young man would normally enter
that status during the time he was
19 years old and leave it during

the time he was 20." But given
the assumption that few men will
be drafted if they can help it, this
argument holds only for those
men who drew high numbers or
who cannot obtain a deferment.
For all those in college or with
other deferments available, little
has changed. A few can count on
never being drafted. Some will be
even more vulnerable to the
"pressured motivation" of the
draft to channel their lives. The
majority will still keep a
apprehensive eye on the draft and
be hung up on playing the angles
for as many years as they can. Fo
the basic cause of uncertainty still
remains: some go and some don't.

guess or two about the effects of
President Nixon's "random
selection method" and what it
will mean in the long run.
From the beginning of the
Nixon Administration the draft
has been an issue of which it took
careful note. The campaign efforts
of the Young Republicans in
many states were built around
smiling posters of candidate
Nixon captioned "Oppose the
Draft? Vote for Nixon!" During
the past year the President was
clearly concerned about the state
of affairs on college campuses and
aware of the central part the draft
played in the disenchantment of
college students. Last May
Nixon delivered a major
presidential message on the draft,
calling for its repeal but proposing
some immediate changes. This fall
he moved quickly to cool off the
draft issue on campuses. First
there was the executive order
granting induction postponements
for the full academic year to
graduate students, then drastic
reductions in draft calls and the
announcement that General
Hershey, the national symbol of
the draft, would step down
February first. Finally, the
President pushed the lottery
through Congress with
unexpected speed.
During these months the draft
as an oppressive issue did indeed
seem to recede. While the
uncertainty and anxiety of many
individuals remained high, the
mood on campuses was hopeful,
attesting to the human tendency
to prefer new problems to old
ones or to believe that anything is
likely to be better than the evil
which now afflicts us.
Now that the lottery is an
accomplished fact, however, it
seems to me doubtful that its
effects are going to be what either
the students, or presumably the
Administration, hoped they
would be. True, the lottery
removed a particular kind of
uncertainty for those with very
high or very low numbers. But for
those with high numbers, the
certainty of not being drafted not
only produced joy and relief, but
uneasiness and even guilt because
of the close friends or roommates
who were nailed in the same
drawing that set them free. For
men drawing low numbers the
certainty of being called has
produced an unforseen level of
concern and evasive activity which
indicates that the channeling
effect of the draft will not
disappear, but rather intensify for
these men. The rest, perhaps the
majority of men, are as uncertain
and subject to paranoia and
channeling as ever.
Overnight Reality
In addition, the draft has
overnight become real to
thousands of addilic tal men,
judging from the avalanche of
men who descended on anyone
believed to know something about
the workings of the draft and the
grounds for deferment or
exemption. Up till now the draft
was for many college students a

vague and troubling shadow which
they hoped would fade away
before it enveloped them.
Suddenly it is a hard fact of life.
In his presidential message on
the draft, Nixon noted that
"present policies extend the
period during which young people
come to look upon Government
processes as particularly
arbitrary," and argued that a
random selection method would
"reduce the period of prime draft
vulnerability—and the uncertainty
that accompanies it—from seven
years to one year, so that the
young man would normally enter
that status during the time he was
19 years old and leave it during

the time he was 20." But given
the assumption that few men will
be drafted if they can help it, this
argument holds only for those
men who drew high numbers or
who cannot obtain a deferment.
For all those in college or with
other deferments available, little
has changed. A few can count on
never being drafted. Some will be
even more vulnerable to the
"pressured motivation" of the
draft to channel their lives. The
majority will still keep a
apprehensive eye on the draft and
be hung up on playing the angles
for as many years as they can. Fo
the basic cause of uncertainty still
remains: some go and some don't.
At the risk of being just
another commentator offering
instant analysis of Administration
actions, I should like to hazard a
guess or two about the effects of
President Nixon's "random
selection method" and what it
will mean in the long run.
