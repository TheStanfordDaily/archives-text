# ISRAEL PAT MIHALY
## 
### 
In the last few weeks, after I
had written a number of articles
on the Arab-Israeli conflict I
decided to sit back in silence and
consider the replies in the Daily. I
was most disappointed that the
attacks were directed as much
against me as against the ideas I
expressed, and were presented in a
far less academic fasion than the
debate I had originally envisioned.
To call my articles "cheap
propaganda" or "Arab
propaganda" or to say that I live
in a "fantasy world" does not
befit a university like Stanford.
My concern over the Middle
East situation comes from a
careful study of the problem and
a realization that decisions made
both by the United States and the
United Nations in the last few
decades were not based on a
realistic picture of the situation.
Domestic pressures in America,
sincere sympathy for the victims
of World War 11, and a lack of
understanding of the Arabs, a
people so different from
ourselves, put blinders on
American policy makers so that
they could see only half the issue.
I do not presume to justify all
that the Arabs say or do; however,
I do question, as few do, the
all-powerful, all-knowing and
all-virtuous stereotype of Israel
which seeks to simplify tl
conflict
My earlier discussions in the
Daily were written with the
conviction that true peace in the
area could have and still can come
about only when Jews and Arabs
(both Christian and Moslem
Arabs) are allowed to live together
and govern their nation on a basis
of equality without regard to
religious or cultural differences.
A Unitary State
The unitary state which I feel is
the only real solution to a just and
durable peace is not a new
proposal or one which has
emerged out of Arab defeat. It
was first officially proposed by

the Arabs to the Peel Commission
of 1937. Then, in 1947 the people
of Palestine and all the Arab states
rejected the partition plan of the
United Nations because they
advocated one Palestine for all.
The Palestine Liberation
Organization, established since the
creation of Israel, and authorized
to represent the Palestinian
people, also has advocated this
unitary state. And this brings us
to 1969 and the newest and most
vital expression of Palestinian
nationalism, the guerrilla
movement. To ignore it or its
significance, or to view it only as a
destructive and negative force is
to be ignorant of the fact that it is
sustained and strengthened by a
positive goal. One of the largest
and best known of the guerrilla
organizations is Al- Fateh. the
Palestine Liberation Movement.
Its position paper is representative
of the feelings of the great majority
of Palestinians and hence an
understanding of it is vital to a
permanent solution of the
Arab-Israeli conflict. As it states:
"Like the people of Palestine,
Al-Fateh has not and will never
bestow undeserved legitimacy
upon the Zionist settler-state of
Israel . . . While Al-Fateh is
fighting the constitutional
existence of the Zionist State of
Israel, it is also fighting to create
the new Palestine of tomorrow—a
democratic non-sectarian Palestine
where Jews, Moslems, and
Christians will work, worship and
live peacefully together while
enjoying equal rights and
obligations."
Israel cannot impose a
permanent peace now any more I
than it could 22 years ago. Thus it
either sacrifices justice and peace
to the exclusive nationalism of .
Zionist statehood and faces the I
100 years war that U Thant
predicted, or it reverses its
priorities and makes a sincere
effort to end the stalemate in the
Middle East.

Israel . . . While Al-Fateh is
fighting the constitutional
existence of the Zionist State of
Israel, it is also fighting to create
the new Palestine of tomorrow—a
democratic non-sectarian Palestine
where Jews, Moslems, and
Christians will work, worship and
live peacefully together while
enjoying equal rights and
obligations."
Israel cannot impose a
permanent peace now any more I
than it could 22 years ago. Thus it
either sacrifices justice and peace
to the exclusive nationalism of .
Zionist statehood and faces the I
100 years war that U Thant
predicted, or it reverses its
priorities and makes a sincere
effort to end the stalemate in the
Middle East.
In the last few weeks, after I
had written a number of articles
on the Arab-Israeli conflict I
decided to sit back in silence and
consider the replies in the Daily. I
was most disappointed that the
attacks were directed as much
against me as against the ideas I
expressed, and were presented in a
far less academic fasion than the
debate I had originally envisioned.
To call my articles "cheap
propaganda" or "Arab
propaganda" or to say that I live
in a "fantasy world" does not
befit a university like Stanford.
My concern over the Middle
East situation comes from a
careful study of the problem and
a realization that decisions made
both by the United States and the
United Nations in the last few
decades were not based on a
realistic picture of the situation.
Domestic pressures in America,
sincere sympathy for the victims
of World War 11, and a lack of
understanding of the Arabs, a
people so different from
ourselves, put blinders on
American policy makers so that
they could see only half the issue.
I do not presume to justify all
that the Arabs say or do; however,
I do question, as few do, the
all-powerful, all-knowing and
all-virtuous stereotype of Israel
which seeks to simplify tl
conflict
My earlier discussions in the
Daily were written with the
conviction that true peace in the
area could have and still can come
about only when Jews and Arabs
(both Christian and Moslem
Arabs) are allowed to live together
and govern their nation on a basis
of equality without regard to
religious or cultural differences.
A Unitary State
The unitary state which I feel is
the only real solution to a just and
durable peace is not a new
proposal or one which has
emerged out of Arab defeat. It
was first officially proposed by

the Arabs to the Peel Commission
of 1937. Then, in 1947 the people
of Palestine and all the Arab states
rejected the partition plan of the
United Nations because they
advocated one Palestine for all.
The Palestine Liberation
Organization, established since the
creation of Israel, and authorized
to represent the Palestinian
people, also has advocated this
unitary state. And this brings us
to 1969 and the newest and most
vital expression of Palestinian
nationalism, the guerrilla
movement. To ignore it or its
significance, or to view it only as a
destructive and negative force is
to be ignorant of the fact that it is
sustained and strengthened by a
positive goal. One of the largest
and best known of the guerrilla
organizations is Al- Fateh. the
Palestine Liberation Movement.
Its position paper is representative
of the feelings of the great majority
of Palestinians and hence an
understanding of it is vital to a
permanent solution of the
Arab-Israeli conflict. As it states:
"Like the people of Palestine,
Al-Fateh has not and will never
bestow undeserved legitimacy
upon the Zionist settler-state of
Israel . . . While Al-Fateh is
fighting the constitutional
existence of the Zionist State of
Israel, it is also fighting to create
the new Palestine of tomorrow—a
democratic non-sectarian Palestine
where Jews, Moslems, and
Christians will work, worship and
