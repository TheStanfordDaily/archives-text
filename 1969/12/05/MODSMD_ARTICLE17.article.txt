# Coming Home To Roost
## Spring Battle Necessary? 
### Mark Weinberger 
Fall quarter is drawing to a
close, so it's time to bring out the
crash helmets, picket signs, throat
lozenges, no-doz, and keep them
handy.
After all, the annual spring fling
is only a quarter away.
In between the yawns, the
oft-heard slogan these first three
months has been, "Just wait 'till
the spring."
Except for a brief stint of press
censorship, the University
administration has had nothing to
do. President Pitzer has taken to
trooping across country during
the week, returning only for the
weekends. Bob Beyers, of the
News Service, has had to busy
himself with counting crowds at
Moratorium marches and churning
out dire warnings of Stanford's
impending financial doom.
Ilukari and LeMay
No one feels much like
protesting during the fall. A
General Electric protest earlier
this month drew only a handful
willing to take a moral stand
against exploitation and
imperialism. The best-attended
event (besides the graceful
Moratorium convocation Oct. 15)
was Barry CJoldwater's speech, an
amusing blend of Harvey Hukari
and General LeMay.
Yesterday's fisticuffs in front
of the Placement Center and in
Tresidder Union hardly qualifies
as a campus event worth
recording. High schoolers should
be banned from Stanford radicals'
semi-serious efforts at protest;
likewise, Harvey and his goon
squad should take the hint that
their photographic skills only
provoke more violence.
Except for the BSU, very few
people seem to be mad about
anything this year. Students are
grumbling because course

offerings are as meager for next
quarter, Pepsi is being boycotted,
Pat Shea is upset with anyone
who doesn't walk the moderate
tightrope, a few departments are
going through troubled times, and
the dope supply isn't all that
plentiful. But these are only
minor aches and pains; the Big
Issue is yet to come forth to
inflame the campus.
Land Policies
It seems unlikely that this
year's spring battle will appear
over an issue as limited as
University land development. I
could be wrong, but it seems that
land policies are going to be
settled somewhere in the morass
of committees which threaten to
choke issues to death.
Peace has a fairly solid ring to it
this year. Anti-war activity has the
greatest support ever among
campus groups, from students to
top administrators. How could the
war become a campus issue if
there were no reactionaries on
campus who opposed an end to
the war? Campus confrontations
need tangible enemies.
Who Isn't Tired?
Perhaps this will be the first
year in several that we will forego
the yearly spring ritual. After all,
who isn't tired of hearing Lenny
Siegel or Fred Cohen expounding?
Who isn't tired of reading those
boringly moderate statements by
Pitzer that always seem to
complement all sides but come
down on (ho side of tradition?
Who isn't tired of seeing the Palo
Alio Times distort what occurs
day after day? Who can stand one
more .lim Schnieder call for
moderation in all things except
moderation?
All of these personalities and
problems that consume so much
passion turn out in the final

analysis to be non-issues. Down a
level are human needs for peace
and love and community. Stick up
the periscope and look around at
American culture: indications are
clear that the rest of society offers
little chance of fulfillment of
these needs.
People Need People
It all comes down to the fact
that today's undergraduates are
bored, lonely, frustrated, and
scared. The April Third Movement
brought people together in a
manner they never have before,
and droves of students have been
searching for such a permanent
community ever since. The simple
fact is that in this time of Nixon,
Agnew, the draft, My Lai,
MIRV's, and environmental death,
people above all need other
people.
The anti-war movement can
serve this very human need,
especially as it becomes
increasingly isolated on the
campuses. As the cultural
genocide as practiced by Nixon,
television, and the corporations
homogenize society, the campuses
will increasingly become the bases
from which thÂ® counter-culture
can sprout.
'The day will arrive . .
The day will arrive when
colleges such as Stanford truly
govern themselves, casting aside
the elements that attempt to use
the university's resources in
support of the very system that
the college community is working
to restructure.
Some day, the annual spring
battle will become unnecessary
That day will arrive when those
with influence in this community
quit trying to serve two masters
