# Hazards To Man
## U.S. Pioneered Gas Warfare 
### Joshua Lederberg 
(The following is the second
half of an article by Joshua
Lederberg, Nobel Laureate, and
Professor of Genetics.)
As a matter of prudent
self-protection, BW research
laboratories in the U.S. and the
U.K. have pioneered in the
technology of containing
dangerous microbes. I have great
respect for the technical
capabilities of the senior civilian
management of these laboratories.
They should be credited with the
outmost diligence in protecting
both their personnel and the
surrounding community. They
have also published a great deal of
their work in the engineering of
such protective facilities and this
experience is unquestionably of
great value in public health work.
For example, the British
laboratories, at Porton, were
acclaimed for the safe handling of
the very dangerous Marburg virus
upon its first outbreak in Europe
two years ago.
In spite of these precautions,
disease organisms have
nevertheless escaped from time to
time and inevitably will do so in

the future. Such escapes already
constitute a breach of security.
They also compromise public
health, which is further
complicated by keeping civilian
physicians in ignorance of
potential agents that might
fulminate into large scale
epidemics. The intentional
development of virulent strains
resistant to conventional
antibiotics obviously worsens the
problem. We simply have no way
of assuring ourselves that a BW
development activity will not
eventually seed a catastrophic
world wide epidemic that ignores
national boundaries.
On the immediate horizon are
modern developments in
molecular genetics. These
undoubtedly point to the
development of agents against
which no reasonable defense can
be mounted. Because of the
uncertain danger of retro-action,
such agents are hardly likely to be
used in consequence of any
rational military decision, but
would obviously play into the
hands of aggressive insurgence and
blackmail.

Finally, even the publication,
albeit as a positive contribution to
humanity, of the technology of
safe containment insidiously helps
solve a problem that might have
hindered a potential insurgent
from dabbling in BW.
Problems of Control
The problem of containing
infectious agents being
manufactured and stockpiled in
large quantities, or tested in the
open air, is a much more difficult
technological challenge; and it is
encumbered with even more
official secrecy than the
laboratory work. We have little
better information than the Skull
Valley incident to help judge the
competence with which such
matters are handled. The main
effect of security has not been to
deny information to an enemy
but to protect an establishment
from both destructive and
constructive criticism at home. In
this case, more open constructive
criticism would be crucial for
assurance that procedures for
containing microbes are well
conceived and correctly
implemented.

BW agents for use against man
can be expected to be far more
capricious than any other form of
weapon. For any strategic purpose
they are essentially untestable
since large populations would
have to be held to an uncertain
risk. With nuclear weapons we can
at least be confident of the laws
of scaling. The destruction of
targets can be calculated from
simple physical measures like the
energy released. Nothing
comparable to this can possibly
apply to BW agents. For this
reason again the United States and
other nuclear powers have
absolutely nothing to lose in
disavowing their use in war. Our
continued participation in BW
development is akin to our
arranging to make hydrogen
bombs available at the
supermarket.
Microbiological research must
be expanded in programs of
public health research for defense
against our natural enemies. In
fact, the public health
bureaucracy has refused to give
prudent thought to the recurrence
of major pandemics of human
disease, be they of spontaneous or
human-intelligent origin. Perhaps
this is simply a consequence of
their sense of futility about
mobilizing the necessary measures
of global health needed to protect
the species. If we add to already
urgent concerns the spread of
dangerous diseases from large foci
of infection established by BW
attack, the prospects become even
gloomier.
Fear-Reducing BW
Our self-interest both as
Americans and human beings
urgently calls for the institution
of improved measures of world
public health and of international
controls on the development and
use of BW agents. Research
related to BW perhaps should
continue; but it is of the first
importance that this be
112 e a r - reducing rather than
fear-generating, for the latter can
only lead to mutual escalation of
anti-human developments.
It is difficult at this state to
detail the texture of new
agreements subsequent to our
ratifications of the Geneva
protocol. We cannot suddenly
impose unilateral decisions on the
international community; but no
other issue can evoke such a
unanimity of world opinion. New
agreements probably should
include 1) public legal
commitments against secret BW
research; 2) the establishment of

central, international laboratories
to monitor the occurrence of
threatening organisms and to help
develop generally available means
of protection against them; 3) a
legal system to protect the
freedom of information and
communication of data on disease
organisms to such central
authorities; 4) a general
acceleration of research and
health services to minimize the
incidence of infectious disease,
particularly in underdeveloped
countries. No situation could be
better designed for the evolution
of serious new viruses than the
existence of crowded, underfed
human populations in which foci
could development spread with a
minimum of medical control; 5)
treaty commitments on BW
analogous to the nuclear
nonprol iferation treaty; 6)
pre-a greed sanctions by the
civilized world against the release
or development of BW agents,
clearly invoking international law
against such "offenses against
mankind" as akin to war crimes.
Some of the expectations that
1 have outlined are speculations
which I fevently hope will be
proven false. Unfortunately, they
already have a proven historical
precedent. As many of you may
already know, the Black
Death—the epidemic of the
Bubonic Plague in Europe
between 1346 and 1350—was the
immediate consequence of a
primitive form of bacteriological
warfare. Genoese colonists in the
Crimea brought the plague back
to Italy with them when they
retreated from the fortress of
Fyodosia after having been
assaulted with the corpses from
the attacking Tartar hordes who
had been infested with the
disease. This epidemic subsided
only after killing approximately
1/3 of the population in Europe,
as well, presumably as an equal
toll in Asia and India. Unless we
learn to apply our common
energies against the common
enemies of all mankind, we are
foolish and arrogant to doubt that
history will record "Black Death
II," and more.

This testimony was prepared
just prior to President Nixon's
heartening announcement of new
U.S. initiatives towards the
regulation of BW. I am confident
that the Senate will now promptly
ratify the Geneva Protocol as a
basis for the further measures
needed to assure man's life and
health on this planet.

Our self-interest both as
Americans and human beings
urgently calls for the institution
of improved measures of world
public health and of international
controls on the development and
use of BW agents. Research
related to BW perhaps should
continue; but it is of the first
importance that this be
112 e a r - reducing rather than
fear-generating, for the latter can
only lead to mutual escalation of
anti-human developments.
It is difficult at this state to
detail the texture of new
agreements subsequent to our
ratifications of the Geneva
protocol. We cannot suddenly
impose unilateral decisions on the
international community; but no
other issue can evoke such a
unanimity of world opinion. New
agreements probably should
include 1) public legal
commitments against secret BW
research; 2) the establishment of

central, international laboratories
to monitor the occurrence of
threatening organisms and to help
develop generally available means
of protection against them; 3) a
legal system to protect the
freedom of information and
communication of data on disease
organisms to such central
authorities; 4) a general
acceleration of research and
health services to minimize the
incidence of infectious disease,
particularly in underdeveloped
countries. No situation could be
better designed for the evolution
of serious new viruses than the
existence of crowded, underfed
human populations in which foci
could development spread with a
minimum of medical control; 5)
treaty commitments on BW
analogous to the nuclear
nonprol iferation treaty; 6)
pre-a greed sanctions by the
civilized world against the release
or development of BW agents,
clearly invoking international law
against such "offenses against
mankind" as akin to war crimes.
Some of the expectations that
1 have outlined are speculations
which I fevently hope will be
proven false. Unfortunately, they
already have a proven historical
precedent. As many of you may
already know, the Black
Death—the epidemic of the
Bubonic Plague in Europe
between 1346 and 1350—was the
immediate consequence of a
primitive form of bacteriological
warfare. Genoese colonists in the
Crimea brought the plague back
to Italy with them when they
retreated from the fortress of
Fyodosia after having been
assaulted with the corpses from
the attacking Tartar hordes who
had been infested with the
disease. This epidemic subsided
only after killing approximately
1/3 of the population in Europe,
as well, presumably as an equal
toll in Asia and India. Unless we
learn to apply our common
energies against the common
enemies of all mankind, we are
foolish and arrogant to doubt that
history will record "Black Death
II," and more.

This testimony was prepared
just prior to President Nixon's
heartening announcement of new
U.S. initiatives towards the
regulation of BW. I am confident
that the Senate will now promptly
ratify the Geneva Protocol as a
basis for the further measures
needed to assure man's life and
health on this planet.
(The following is the second
half of an article by Joshua
Lederberg, Nobel Laureate, and
Professor of Genetics.)
As a matter of prudent
self-protection, BW research
laboratories in the U.S. and the
U.K. have pioneered in the
technology of containing
dangerous microbes. I have great
respect for the technical
capabilities of the senior civilian
management of these laboratories.
They should be credited with the
outmost diligence in protecting
both their personnel and the
surrounding community. They
have also published a great deal of
their work in the engineering of
such protective facilities and this
experience is unquestionably of
great value in public health work.
For example, the British
laboratories, at Porton, were
acclaimed for the safe handling of
the very dangerous Marburg virus
upon its first outbreak in Europe
two years ago.
In spite of these precautions,
disease organisms have
nevertheless escaped from time to
time and inevitably will do so in

the future. Such escapes already
constitute a breach of security.
They also compromise public
health, which is further
complicated by keeping civilian
physicians in ignorance of
potential agents that might
fulminate into large scale
epidemics. The intentional
development of virulent strains
resistant to conventional
antibiotics obviously worsens the
problem. We simply have no way
of assuring ourselves that a BW
development activity will not
eventually seed a catastrophic
world wide epidemic that ignores
national boundaries.
On the immediate horizon are
modern developments in
molecular genetics. These
undoubtedly point to the
development of agents against
which no reasonable defense can
be mounted. Because of the
uncertain danger of retro-action,
such agents are hardly likely to be
used in consequence of any
rational military decision, but
would obviously play into the
hands of aggressive insurgence and
blackmail.

Finally, even the publication,
albeit as a positive contribution to
humanity, of the technology of
safe containment insidiously helps
solve a problem that might have
hindered a potential insurgent
from dabbling in BW.
Problems of Control
The problem of containing
infectious agents being
manufactured and stockpiled in
large quantities, or tested in the
open air, is a much more difficult
technological challenge; and it is
encumbered with even more
official secrecy than the
laboratory work. We have little
better information than the Skull
Valley incident to help judge the
competence with which such
matters are handled. The main
effect of security has not been to
deny information to an enemy
but to protect an establishment
from both destructive and
constructive criticism at home. In
this case, more open constructive
criticism would be crucial for
assurance that procedures for
containing microbes are well
conceived and correctly
implemented.

BW agents for use against man
can be expected to be far more
capricious than any other form of
weapon. For any strategic purpose
they are essentially untestable
since large populations would
have to be held to an uncertain
risk. With nuclear weapons we can
at least be confident of the laws
of scaling. The destruction of
targets can be calculated from
simple physical measures like the
energy released. Nothing
comparable to this can possibly
apply to BW agents. For this
reason again the United States and
other nuclear powers have
absolutely nothing to lose in
disavowing their use in war. Our
continued participation in BW
development is akin to our
arranging to make hydrogen
bombs available at the
supermarket.
Microbiological research must
be expanded in programs of
public health research for defense
against our natural enemies. In
fact, the public health
bureaucracy has refused to give
prudent thought to the recurrence
of major pandemics of human
disease, be they of spontaneous or
human-intelligent origin. Perhaps
this is simply a consequence of
their sense of futility about
mobilizing the necessary measures
of global health needed to protect
the species. If we add to already
urgent concerns the spread of
dangerous diseases from large foci
of infection established by BW
attack, the prospects become even
gloomier.

health, which is further
complicated by keeping civilian
physicians in ignorance of
potential agents that might
fulminate into large scale
epidemics. The intentional
development of virulent strains
resistant to conventional
antibiotics obviously worsens the
problem. We simply have no way
of assuring ourselves that a BW
development activity will not
eventually seed a catastrophic
world wide epidemic that ignores
national boundaries.
On the immediate horizon are
modern developments in
molecular genetics. These
undoubtedly point to the
development of agents against
which no reasonable defense can
be mounted. Because of the
uncertain danger of retro-action,
such agents are hardly likely to be
used in consequence of any
rational military decision, but
would obviously play into the
hands of aggressive insurgence and
blackmail.

Finally, even the publication,
albeit as a positive contribution to
humanity, of the technology of
safe containment insidiously helps
solve a problem that might have
hindered a potential insurgent
from dabbling in BW.
Problems of Control
The problem of containing
infectious agents being
manufactured and stockpiled in
large quantities, or tested in the
open air, is a much more difficult
technological challenge; and it is
encumbered with even more
official secrecy than the
laboratory work. We have little
better information than the Skull
Valley incident to help judge the
competence with which such
matters are handled. The main
effect of security has not been to
deny information to an enemy
but to protect an establishment
from both destructive and
constructive criticism at home. In
this case, more open constructive
criticism would be crucial for
assurance that procedures for
containing microbes are well
conceived and correctly
implemented.

BW agents for use against man
can be expected to be far more
capricious than any other form of
weapon. For any strategic purpose
they are essentially untestable
since large populations would
have to be held to an uncertain
risk. With nuclear weapons we can
at least be confident of the laws
of scaling. The destruction of
targets can be calculated from
simple physical measures like the
energy released. Nothing
comparable to this can possibly
apply to BW agents. For this
reason again the United States and
other nuclear powers have
absolutely nothing to lose in
disavowing their use in war. Our
continued participation in BW
development is akin to our
arranging to make hydrogen
bombs available at the
supermarket.
Microbiological research must
be expanded in programs of
public health research for defense
against our natural enemies. In
fact, the public health
bureaucracy has refused to give
prudent thought to the recurrence
of major pandemics of human
disease, be they of spontaneous or
human-intelligent origin. Perhaps
this is simply a consequence of
their sense of futility about
mobilizing the necessary measures
of global health needed to protect
the species. If we add to already
urgent concerns the spread of
dangerous diseases from large foci
of infection established by BW
attack, the prospects become even
gloomier.
Fear-Reducing BW
Our self-interest both as
Americans and human beings
urgently calls for the institution
of improved measures of world
public health and of international
controls on the development and
use of BW agents. Research
related to BW perhaps should
continue; but it is of the first
importance that this be
112 e a r - reducing rather than
fear-generating, for the latter can
only lead to mutual escalation of
anti-human developments.
It is difficult at this state to
detail the texture of new
agreements subsequent to our
ratifications of the Geneva
protocol. We cannot suddenly
impose unilateral decisions on the
international community; but no
other issue can evoke such a
unanimity of world opinion. New
agreements probably should
include 1) public legal
commitments against secret BW
research; 2) the establishment of

central, international laboratories
to monitor the occurrence of
threatening organisms and to help
develop generally available means
of protection against them; 3) a
legal system to protect the
freedom of information and
communication of data on disease
organisms to such central
authorities; 4) a general
acceleration of research and
health services to minimize the
incidence of infectious disease,
particularly in underdeveloped
countries. No situation could be
better designed for the evolution
of serious new viruses than the
existence of crowded, underfed
human populations in which foci
could development spread with a
minimum of medical control; 5)
treaty commitments on BW
analogous to the nuclear
nonprol iferation treaty; 6)
pre-a greed sanctions by the
civilized world against the release
or development of BW agents,
clearly invoking international law
against such "offenses against
mankind" as akin to war crimes.
Some of the expectations that
1 have outlined are speculations
which I fevently hope will be
proven false. Unfortunately, they
already have a proven historical
precedent. As many of you may
already know, the Black
Death—the epidemic of the
Bubonic Plague in Europe
between 1346 and 1350—was the
immediate consequence of a
primitive form of bacteriological
warfare. Genoese colonists in the
Crimea brought the plague back
to Italy with them when they
retreated from the fortress of
Fyodosia after having been
assaulted with the corpses from
the attacking Tartar hordes who
had been infested with the
disease. This epidemic subsided
only after killing approximately
1/3 of the population in Europe,
as well, presumably as an equal
toll in Asia and India. Unless we
learn to apply our common
energies against the common
enemies of all mankind, we are
foolish and arrogant to doubt that
history will record "Black Death
II," and more.

This testimony was prepared
just prior to President Nixon's
heartening announcement of new
U.S. initiatives towards the
regulation of BW. I am confident
that the Senate will now promptly
ratify the Geneva Protocol as a
basis for the further measures
needed to assure man's life and
health on this planet.
(The following is the second
half of an article by Joshua
Lederberg, Nobel Laureate, and
Professor of Genetics.)
As a matter of prudent
self-protection, BW research
laboratories in the U.S. and the
U.K. have pioneered in the
technology of containing
dangerous microbes. I have great
respect for the technical
capabilities of the senior civilian
management of these laboratories.
They should be credited with the
outmost diligence in protecting
both their personnel and the
surrounding community. They
have also published a great deal of
their work in the engineering of
such protective facilities and this
experience is unquestionably of
great value in public health work.
For example, the British
laboratories, at Porton, were
acclaimed for the safe handling of
the very dangerous Marburg virus
upon its first outbreak in Europe
two years ago.
In spite of these precautions,
disease organisms have
nevertheless escaped from time to
time and inevitably will do so in

the future. Such escapes already
constitute a breach of security.
They also compromise public
health, which is further

authorities; 4) a general
acceleration of research and
health services to minimize the
incidence of infectious disease,
particularly in underdeveloped
countries. No situation could be
better designed for the evolution
of serious new viruses than the
existence of crowded, underfed
human populations in which foci
could development spread with a
minimum of medical control; 5)
treaty commitments on BW
analogous to the nuclear
nonprol iferation treaty; 6)
pre-a greed sanctions by the
civilized world against the release
or development of BW agents,
clearly invoking international law
against such "offenses against
mankind" as akin to war crimes.
Some of the expectations that
1 have outlined are speculations
which I fevently hope will be
proven false. Unfortunately, they
already have a proven historical
precedent. As many of you may
already know, the Black
Death—the epidemic of the
Bubonic Plague in Europe
between 1346 and 1350—was the
immediate consequence of a
primitive form of bacteriological
warfare. Genoese colonists in the
Crimea brought the plague back
to Italy with them when they
retreated from the fortress of
Fyodosia after having been
assaulted with the corpses from
the attacking Tartar hordes who
had been infested with the
disease. This epidemic subsided
only after killing approximately
1/3 of the population in Europe,
as well, presumably as an equal
toll in Asia and India. Unless we
learn to apply our common
energies against the common
enemies of all mankind, we are
foolish and arrogant to doubt that
history will record "Black Death
II," and more.

This testimony was prepared
just prior to President Nixon's
heartening announcement of new
U.S. initiatives towards the
regulation of BW. I am confident
that the Senate will now promptly
ratify the Geneva Protocol as a
basis for the further measures
needed to assure man's life and
health on this planet.
