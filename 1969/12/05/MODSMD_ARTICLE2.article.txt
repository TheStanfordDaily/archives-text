## Panthers Dead 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) The loader of
the Black Panther party in Illinois
and a party member were slain
and six persons injured Thursday
in the second shootout within a
month between the militant
organization and Chicago police.
Three members of the Panther
party were charged with
attempted murder and aggravated
battery in the predawn gun battle
in an apartment on the West Side.
The dead were Fred Hampton,
21, chairman of the Panther
organization in Illinois and
considered No. 3 man nationally
in the organization, and Mark
Clark, 22, of Peoria, III. Two
policemen were injured slightly.
A similar gun fight Nov. 13
claimed the lives of two
policemen and a Panther member.
Seven persons—six of them
policemen—were wounded.
The Cook County-Chicago
-state's attorney's office said
gunfire erupted as investigators,
carrying a search warrant, raided
an apartment shared by Hampton
and Bobby Rush, another Panther
official.
The warrant charging illegal
possession of firearms was issued
in Circuit Court Wednesday after
a witness testified he had seen "a
large cache of shotguns and other
weapons" in the building.
Edward V. Hanrahan, state's
attorney, said seven handguns,
seven shotguns and 1,000 rounds
of ammunition were confiscated.
One of the shotguns was stolen in
April from a Chicago Police
Department patrol car, he said
Hampton was among nine
persons who opened fire on 13
members of a special prosecution
unit of the state's attorney's
office who stormed through
barricaded doors at the
apartment, officials said.
Sgt. Dan Groth, leader of the
raid, said he twice pleaded with

cease firing. But each time, he
said, "a voice came from the back
and shouted: 'Shoot it out."
