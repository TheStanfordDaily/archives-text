# Shockley And Genocide
## On The Question Of Fascism 
### Randolph Bonner 
Fascism nd Genocide can occur
independently, but since the
experience of the Jews and
Gypsies in Nazi Germany, it has
become difficult to imagine one
without the other. To the extent
that we tend to picture them
together, there is the danger that
the recurrence of one will be
accompanied by the recurrence of
the other. That is, a people whose
resistence to Fascism is broken
will have no resistence to
Genocide, and vice versa. Thus it
is necessary to be doubly vigilant
if we desire to build a rational,
humane society.
In this vigilence we must be
mindful of the role of ideas: they
have a way of becoming "real"
sometimes. Dangerous ideas,
therefore, must be dealt with as
if they were already realized lest
they become realized. One
particularly dangerous idea was
put forth recently by Dr. William
Shockley (Stanford Daily, 26
Nov.). Dr. Shockley is concerned
with what he terms the
"Heredity-Poverty-Crime
Problem." That is, he feels Blacks

have developed inferior genes and
are thus inclined to lead lives of
poverty and crime. He also refers
to this as a "Human Quality
Problem." That these "problems"
have been overlooked by his
academic colleagues is "one of the
most grevious derilictions of
intellectual responsibility in the
history of civilization." Hence he
feels a great moral burden to
promote this sort of research.
If all works out, Dr. Shockley
forsees two principle beneficiaries
to all this research: himself and
the "American Negro." Himself in
that he will receive the Nobel
Prize, and the "American Negro"
in that there will be the "wise,
humane, and appropriate
prevention of hundreds of births
per day of ["American Negro"]
babies destined with high
probability to lives of frustration
in our modern, technological
society be genetic enslavement
limiting them to mental
retardation with IQ below 75."
And of course all the rest of us
will benefit by the "reduction" in
crime."

But the danger is not so much
that we will wake up some
morning to read headlines about
Dr. Shockley's delusions being
made into domestic policy, the
danger is that we will not wake up
to the fact that it is already
beginning to happen. We have
become so brutalized by our
repression of the People of
Vietnam, Thailand and elsewhere
and so afraid for our own
individual futures in a world that
is beyond our control that by the
time we can no longer ignore the
fact that Black Men and/or
Women are being sterilized (not to
mention murdered) we will not
even be able to imagine that we
could do anything to stop it. At
least it would appear that this is
what the Nixon Administration in
banking on.
We have been brutalized into
helplessness and are even further
brutalized by being forced to
realize our helplessness. The
Massacre of Mylai ("Pinkville")
occurred almost two years ago.
What can we do about it? Mrs.
Meadlo said, "I sent them [the
Army ] a good boy and they made
him a murderer." What can she
do? Women, children, and aged
men were killed and their bodies
set aflame by our boys, with our
money, in our name. What can we
do? Perhaps we are supposed to
be reassured because some
Senator or Congressman with
combat experience says he is
shocked and sickened.
The Nixon Administration
would like us to keep our heads in
the sand. It would not be good for
the peole of the United States to
know what is going on in their
country because the fact of the
matter is that there are already
genocidal policies being practiced
here, although perhaps not of a
magnitude sufficient for Dr.
Shockley's satisfaction. These
policies will be discussed in detail
in a future column.
The point is Genocide and
Fascism thrive on complacency
and complicity. But the choice of
whether or not to be complacent
and complying is ours to make.
Anyone interested in further
discussion is welcome to come
hear Charles Garry, attorney for
the Black Panther Party, next
Tuesday, 9 Dec., Cubberley
Auditorium, 8 p.m.

limiting them to mental
retardation with IQ below 75."
And of course all the rest of us
will benefit by the "reduction" in
crime."

But the danger is not so much
that we will wake up some
morning to read headlines about
Dr. Shockley's delusions being
made into domestic policy, the
danger is that we will not wake up
to the fact that it is already
beginning to happen. We have
become so brutalized by our
repression of the People of
Vietnam, Thailand and elsewhere
and so afraid for our own
individual futures in a world that
is beyond our control that by the
time we can no longer ignore the
fact that Black Men and/or
Women are being sterilized (not to
mention murdered) we will not
even be able to imagine that we
could do anything to stop it. At
least it would appear that this is
what the Nixon Administration in
banking on.
We have been brutalized into
helplessness and are even further
brutalized by being forced to
realize our helplessness. The
Massacre of Mylai ("Pinkville")
occurred almost two years ago.
What can we do about it? Mrs.
Meadlo said, "I sent them [the
Army ] a good boy and they made
him a murderer." What can she
do? Women, children, and aged
men were killed and their bodies
set aflame by our boys, with our
money, in our name. What can we
do? Perhaps we are supposed to
be reassured because some
Senator or Congressman with
combat experience says he is
shocked and sickened.
The Nixon Administration
would like us to keep our heads in
the sand. It would not be good for
the peole of the United States to
know what is going on in their
country because the fact of the
matter is that there are already
genocidal policies being practiced
here, although perhaps not of a
magnitude sufficient for Dr.
Shockley's satisfaction. These
policies will be discussed in detail
in a future column.
The point is Genocide and
Fascism thrive on complacency
and complicity. But the choice of
whether or not to be complacent
and complying is ours to make.
Anyone interested in further
discussion is welcome to come
hear Charles Garry, attorney for
the Black Panther Party, next
Tuesday, 9 Dec., Cubberley
Auditorium, 8 p.m.
(Randolph Homier is a graduate
student and a member of the
Stanford Community Against War
and Fascism.)
Fascism nd Genocide can occur
independently, but since the
experience of the Jews and
Gypsies in Nazi Germany, it has
become difficult to imagine one
without the other. To the extent
that we tend to picture them
together, there is the danger that
the recurrence of one will be
accompanied by the recurrence of
the other. That is, a people whose
resistence to Fascism is broken
will have no resistence to
Genocide, and vice versa. Thus it
is necessary to be doubly vigilant
if we desire to build a rational,
humane society.
In this vigilence we must be
mindful of the role of ideas: they
have a way of becoming "real"
sometimes. Dangerous ideas,
therefore, must be dealt with as
if they were already realized lest
they become realized. One
particularly dangerous idea was
put forth recently by Dr. William
Shockley (Stanford Daily, 26
Nov.). Dr. Shockley is concerned
with what he terms the
"Heredity-Poverty-Crime
Problem." That is, he feels Blacks

have developed inferior genes and
are thus inclined to lead lives of
poverty and crime. He also refers
to this as a "Human Quality
Problem." That these "problems"
have been overlooked by his
academic colleagues is "one of the
most grevious derilictions of
intellectual responsibility in the
history of civilization." Hence he
feels a great moral burden to
promote this sort of research.
If all works out, Dr. Shockley
forsees two principle beneficiaries
to all this research: himself and
the "American Negro." Himself in
that he will receive the Nobel
Prize, and the "American Negro"
in that there will be the "wise,
humane, and appropriate
prevention of hundreds of births
per day of ["American Negro"]
babies destined with high
probability to lives of frustration
in our modern, technological
society be genetic enslavement
limiting them to mental
retardation with IQ below 75."
And of course all the rest of us
will benefit by the "reduction" in
crime."
