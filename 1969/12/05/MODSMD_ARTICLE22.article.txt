## 'The Oak Leaf' 
### 
The following letter, addressed
to me by an undergraduate,
strikes me as an uncommonly
sensitive and discerning statement.
"Tonight, December 1, 1969,
the United States initiates its
lottery system for the
conscription into the Army of
550,000 young men. They must
fulfill their quota, of numbers, of
bodies, of the irreplaceable faces,
minds, ideas and capacities. I am,
like 850,000 others, no more than
a one-to-three digit number
followed by a letter for nly last
name. I am capable of shooting an
Ml 6, of strangling the "enemy"
or cutting his throat; therefore, 1
am valuable. I am young and
strong, capable of climbing
mountains, guiding a canoe
through treacherous water;
therefore, I am valuable not as
me, but as an instrument, a
serviceable tool until I am worn
beyond repair.
"I have no power to influence
present policy. There are only
generals, anxious to perpetuate
the destruction that ironically
sustains their positions of

authority, their limelight, their
distorted values. The channels to
leadership are clogged with
lobbys, precedents, paper, and
'mind-forged manacles.' I hang in
fragile suspension, revolted by
what I see and read, and at the
same time helpless to effect any
change, except within myself or
those I love.
"It seems easier to justify God's
ways to man than it does to
justify man's ways to man.
"I cannot submit to that which
repulses me. I cannot lose my
passion by forgetting or escaping.
I cannot lock the mind's door
without becoming cold, brutal, or
blind.
" . . What I have given you is a
symbolâ€”the oak leaf. It is strong,
never deceitful or ambitious. It is
always constant, well-balanced
and mortal except in the memory.
As a symbol it is as much a
solance to me as the girl I love . . .
"The time is appropriate for
this gift."
And appropriate for this
statement.
