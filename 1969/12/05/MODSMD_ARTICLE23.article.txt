# Calley & Us
## Guilt Not Ours 
### D.B. Jones 
I share the good churchmen's
agony (Daily letter, December 3)
that L.t. Calley should alone but
charged with the murder of 109
Vietnamese people. Some of his
subordinates and superiors should
share in the charge. But to extend
his presumed guilt "in the eyes of
God and man" to the entire
American population is senseless
and insane . . .and easy. God
hasn't been seen for some time,
and some maintain that He died;
His indictment is no special
burden for most of us. Nor is
"man" likely to indict, in any
meaningful way, 200,000,000
Americans. Were that unlikely to
occur, those who would suffer
most are our children. But the
writers aren't maintaining that our
sins should be visited upon our
children. They want us all to feel
guilty, presumably on the
assumption that mass guilt will
end the war in Vietnam. This is a
dubious, dangerous assumption.
It is true that had Calley
destroyed the village and its
inhabitants by calling in an
airstrike, he would not be facing a
mass murder charge. Our sense of
responsibility has not caught up
with our complex technology. We
are rightly shocked when one
human being faces another and
kills him in cold blood. But men
who kill by remote control are
not only rarely held accountable
for their actions, they are
rewarded for their cleanliness. I
am less troubled by the
brutalization of American
infantrymen than I am by the
ability of gentlemanly bomber
pilots and sophisticated
problem-solvers to accomplish the
same thing, on a grander scale,
without being brutalized.
Becoming "brutalized" implies
having first been a human being
with a moral sense. What is the
prerequisite for becoming a
technician? Corporal Meadlo was
at least capable of experiencing
some sort of redemption. In the
case of too many Americans,
there is nothing to redeem.
It is important to remember
that just as Calley was free not to
direct the mass murder of the
villagers, he was alse free not to
call in an airstrike. He was free to
have searched the village and
reported "No V.C. present,"
which was apparently the case. I
reject the implication that it is not
possible to act morally in such a
difficult situation. All situations
are ambiguous. How are we going
to react to the first major
manifestations of the impending
eco-catastrophe, when we begin
competing for food, air, and
water? There is not much
reasonable basis for hope as it
stands, and if we no longer believe
moral action is possible in
difficult situations, then there is
even less hope.
The churchmen claim belief
that Calley is "no more guilty of
murder than we are." It is hard to
draw a line between guilt and
innocence in the Vietnam
Atrocity, but draw a line we must.
My view is that Calley and his
men should face the charges
against them in a court of law. So
should Captain Medina, and, as
other specific instances of the

Vietnam Atrocity come to light,
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
other men. I think that some
should be held more responsible
than others; as anyone with a
rudimentary comprehension of
the military knows, an officer is
freer than his men. But it offends
my sense of justice that no
photographer can ever connect a
particular B-52 pilot with a
mutilated Vietnamese child. It is
outrageous that men like Dean
Rusk, McGeorge Bundy, and
Lyndon Johnson will probably
never answer charges of mass
murder in a court of lawâ€”though
I shudder to imagine what would
be the probable context for such
an event.
Others will have different views
as to where the line, which will in
fact be drawn, should be drawn.
Some, such as as the churchmen,
believe we are all equally
guilty . . .though it would stretch
the intellect to charge an illiterate
Mississippi black with complicity.
Some would charge only white
Americans . . .despite men like
David Harris on Linus Pauling.
Some would limit their
indictment to all members of the
armed forces, despite the fact that
the actions of many servicemen,
such as Warrant Officer
Thompson, are more
life-enhancing than those of the
draft-dodger who gets a good
aeronautical engineering job in the
absence of some of the
competition, or the pacifist who
owns stock in Dow-Chemical, or
the academic liberal who freely
sells his esoteric skills to the
Pentagon. But I grudgingly prefer
the Anglo-Saxon tradition of
assigning guilt only where no
reasonable doubt can be shown,
and only where the moral issues
are reasonably clear.
Near the root of the
churchmen's blanket accusation
of murder is their failure to
recognize and accept the
inescapable Injustice of justice,
the inevitability of suffering.
There has never been a perfect
society. Attempts to achieve
perfect justice usually result in
simplication of "good" and
"bad," followed by mass political
executions, Vietnams, Crusades,
pogroms, Jehads, or running
amok. Aware of history, the
churchmen would indict an entire
population, making not even the
crudest distinction. And while our
population is diverted by
self-absorbing, mildly masochistic
and pleasurable guilt, the war
continues.
It is man's moral duty to lessen
suffering, not to be so proud as to
try to eliminate it, while Nature
will not permit. I share the
churchmen's implied belief that
our current legal machinery and
moral thought is inadequate to
the task of lessening suffering in
our time in history. We must have
a better world or we will have
none at all. We can achieve a
better world only by appealing to
the best in man, not the worst. I
do not share the churchmen's loss
of faith in the noble potentialities
of men.
