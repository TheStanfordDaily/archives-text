# Only Alternative
## Socialist America 
### Bertie Anderson 
The Young Socialist Alliance is
a revolutionary socialist youth
organization which is fighting for
the construction of a socialist
America and a socialist world. We
see socialism as the only
alternative to a system which
inevitably produces wars of
aggression, the oppression of
national minorities, poverty, and
exploitation . . .capitalism.
The YSA supports the struggle
for socialist democracy in
Czechoslovakia, the rest of
Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union,
and China. These workers' states
have abolished capitalism and
should be supported for it, but
they are dominated by privileged
bureaucratic groupings which
must be removed before socialism
can be a reality.
The YSA is an internationalist
organization first and
foremostâ€”our program, an
international program.
In the United States there are
three central aspects to the YSA's
program:
The YSA supports the antiwar
movement, a mass movement of
action against the war in Vietnam.
YSA calls for the immediate
withdrawal of U.S. troops from
Vietnam. We work in antiwar
coalitions on a principled
revolutionary basis, uniting with
other groups not on the basis of
common program, but on the
basis of specifically agreed-on
joint action.
The YSA supports the black
liberation struggle and the
revolutionary nature of black
nationalism. Black and brown
people, the most exploited section
of the American population,
suffer a dual class and national
oppression. Fighting that dual
oppression, they will be the
vanguard of the American Socialist
revolution. The YSA it.self is a
multi-national organization, and
Third World YSAers actively
participate in all phases of the

liberation movements of the
oppressed national minorities in
this country. We believe that a
key development in the next
major stage of the black struggle
will be the formation of an
independent black party which
can fight for the interests of black
people independently of, and in
opposition to, thfe ruling-class
parties and institutions. The USA
defends all black and Third World
victims of ruling-class repression.
The YSA supports the candi
dates of the Socialist Workers Party
in elections, such as the 1969
mayoralty campaigns in Atlanta,
Cleveland, and New York. We see
this as a means of explaining
socialist ideas to the majority of
the people who still have illusions
about the bourgeois electoral
system. The working-class
movement has been repeatedly
beheaded through support to the
Democratic, Republican, and
other capitalist parties. The YSA
calls for an independent labor
party which can break with the
ruling class on the electoral arena
and pose the issue of politics on a
class basis. We oppose support to
any capitalist party or candidate
as a matter of Marxist principle.
As a revolutionary organization
the USA participates in all the
immediate struggles of the day.
For that reason, the YSA is not
simply a student organization, but
an organization of all revolutinary
youth: white, black, and Third
World; student, GI, and
working-class. Most of our
activities are presently on high
school and college campuses,
where the opportunities to
participate in and lead mass
actions are the greatest and where
the most people can be won over
to revolutionary ideas and to the
revolutionary youth organization,
the YSA.
