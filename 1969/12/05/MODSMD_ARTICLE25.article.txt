# Blacks, Whites Won't Pretend
## Women Meet For 'Gut-Level' Talks 
### MILLIE YOST 
Why do black and white
women feel the need to pretend
with each other?
Why is the white woman afraid
of the black woman?
Why is the black woman
"uptight" about black men dating
white women?
What effect does the tension
between white and black mothers
have on their children?
These are only a few of the
questions to be discussed by black
and white women from the Bay
Area and southern California in a
two-day conference beginning
tonight in East Palo Alto.
According to Mrs. Byron Skinner,
chairman of the conference,
approximately 300 to 500
students, housewives, and
professional women are expected
to attend.
Gut-Level Discussion
"It's time for a gut-level
discussion between black and
white women on the tensions
which have separated them for
two hundred years," said Mrs.
Skinner.
"The roots of the problem are
deep," Mrs. Skinner emphasized.
"White women have been taught
from generation to generation to
treat us as subservients. They
don't mind if we come into their
homes to cook and clean, but
when we stand up and speak out,
they get afraid. We want to know
why."
"The purpose of the conference
is to enable black and white
women to speak frankly and
honestly.
Stop Pretending
"Black and white women have
got to stop pretending with each
other," Mrs. Skinner said. "They
never talk about the deep
conflicts which exist between
them."
"At the conference everyone
will have the chance to say what is
on her mind. I'm not saying they
won't be put down for what they
say but they won't be shut up
either," she added.
Mrs. Gertrude Wilks, founder of
Mothers for Equal Education
(MEE), the organization which
sponsors the conference, hopes it
will bring about changes of
behavior in both the black and
white communities.

"Black women have got to
speak out if changes are to be
made and white women have got
to listen," says Mrs. Wilks.
"Whites have got to learn to
respect the black community.
They can't assume the right to
speak for the needs of the black
community. We have to do what
we see needs to be done. We have
to control our own community."
"One of the main questions to
be answered at the conference is:
why do white women come into
the black community to work?"
said Mrs. Wilks. "It should not be
their personal decision to come,
but the decision of the black
community."
She points out that blacks can't
decide to go into the white
community to work.
"In fact, two years ago when I
went into the white community
to talk to white women about
equal education, I was evicted by
the police three times."
Interracial Dating
Another issue to be discussed at
the conference is the tension
created by interracial dating.
Shirley Allen, a black Stanford
student who plans to attend the
conference, described how a black
woman feels when she sees a black
man with a white woman.
"There are more women than
men in the black community. So
when I see a black man with a
white chick, I feel she has taken
one of our fish out of the sea,"
she said. "I look at her and I can't
believe she knows shit about the
struggle Tie faces as a black man. I
look at him and ask why I have
turned natural when he still likes
straight hair. We have enough to
worry about as black women,
without that hassle. It's
unnecessary. White women don't
have it."
Asked why she plans to attend
the cortference, she said she
wanted to hear how other sisters
feel in the same situation and how
older white women feel about
interracial dating.
Midnight Seance
The two day conference is
divided into three parts: a
simulated seance at midnight
tonight, speakers and small group
discussions all day Saturday, and a
banquet Saturday night.

"Midnight was chosen for the
first session because poor mothers
with young children have
difficulty getting out of their
homes early in the evening," Mrs.
Skinner explained. "We also
thought it was an exciting and
different idea. Midnight is a quiet
time, and we hope the first session
will set the mood for the entire
conference.
"For Saturday we have invited
women who are not necessarily
known speakers but who
represent a variety of perspectives
on the issues of the conference,"
Mrs. Skinner said.
The small group discussions on
Saturday will center around
Margaret Walker's Jubilee which
all women attending the
conference are asked to read. The
novel deals with the attitudes of
black and white women about
each other in the Civil War era.
"But the issues are the same,"
Mrs. Skinner noted.
Indian Women
The conference concludes with
a banquet including speeches by
Mrs. Wilks, who is also director of
Nairobi High School, and an
Indian woman representing the
Indian group on Alcatraz.
"We don't expect miracles from
the conference," Mrs. Skinner
said, "but we hope all the women
will come away with a better
understanding of themselves and
others. We hope the unspoken
crisis between black and white
women will become a spoken
one."
Registration for the conference
to be held at Garden Oaks Junior
High School in East Palo Alto,
may be made by contacting the
MEE office, 2358 University
Avenue, East Palo Alto. The fee
of fifteen dollars may be paid at
that time or at the door. All
proceeds of the conference go to
meet the expenses of the Nairobi
Day School and High School.

be answered at the conference is:
why do white women come into
the black community to work?"
said Mrs. Wilks. "It should not be
their personal decision to come,
but the decision of the black
community."
She points out that blacks can't
decide to go into the white
community to work.
"In fact, two years ago when I
went into the white community
to talk to white women about
equal education, I was evicted by
the police three times."
Interracial Dating
Another issue to be discussed at
the conference is the tension
created by interracial dating.
Shirley Allen, a black Stanford
student who plans to attend the
conference, described how a black
woman feels when she sees a black
man with a white woman.
"There are more women than
men in the black community. So
when I see a black man with a
white chick, I feel she has taken
one of our fish out of the sea,"
she said. "I look at her and I can't
believe she knows shit about the
struggle Tie faces as a black man. I
look at him and ask why I have
turned natural when he still likes
straight hair. We have enough to
worry about as black women,
without that hassle. It's
unnecessary. White women don't
have it."
Asked why she plans to attend
the cortference, she said she
wanted to hear how other sisters
feel in the same situation and how
older white women feel about
interracial dating.
Midnight Seance
The two day conference is
divided into three parts: a
simulated seance at midnight
tonight, speakers and small group
discussions all day Saturday, and a
banquet Saturday night.

"Midnight was chosen for the
first session because poor mothers
with young children have
difficulty getting out of their
homes early in the evening," Mrs.
Skinner explained. "We also
thought it was an exciting and
different idea. Midnight is a quiet
time, and we hope the first session
will set the mood for the entire
conference.
"For Saturday we have invited
women who are not necessarily
known speakers but who
represent a variety of perspectives
on the issues of the conference,"
Mrs. Skinner said.
The small group discussions on
Saturday will center around
Margaret Walker's Jubilee which
all women attending the
conference are asked to read. The
novel deals with the attitudes of
black and white women about
each other in the Civil War era.
"But the issues are the same,"
Mrs. Skinner noted.
Indian Women
The conference concludes with
a banquet including speeches by
Mrs. Wilks, who is also director of
Nairobi High School, and an
Indian woman representing the
Indian group on Alcatraz.
"We don't expect miracles from
the conference," Mrs. Skinner
said, "but we hope all the women
will come away with a better
understanding of themselves and
others. We hope the unspoken
crisis between black and white
women will become a spoken
one."
Registration for the conference
to be held at Garden Oaks Junior
High School in East Palo Alto,
may be made by contacting the
MEE office, 2358 University
Avenue, East Palo Alto. The fee
of fifteen dollars may be paid at
that time or at the door. All
proceeds of the conference go to
meet the expenses of the Nairobi
Day School and High School.


GET IT TOGETHERâ€”BIack and white women will meet together this weekend
to discuss tensions between them. The conference wili be held in East Palo
Alto, and has been planned by women's organizations there.
Why do black and white
women feel the need to pretend
with each other?
Why is the white woman afraid
of the black woman?
Why is the black woman
"uptight" about black men dating
white women?
What effect does the tension
between white and black mothers
have on their children?
These are only a few of the
questions to be discussed by black
and white women from the Bay
Area and southern California in a
two-day conference beginning
tonight in East Palo Alto.
According to Mrs. Byron Skinner,
chairman of the conference,
approximately 300 to 500
students, housewives, and
professional women are expected
to attend.
Gut-Level Discussion
"It's time for a gut-level
discussion between black and
white women on the tensions
which have separated them for
two hundred years," said Mrs.
Skinner.
"The roots of the problem are
deep," Mrs. Skinner emphasized.
"White women have been taught
from generation to generation to
treat us as subservients. They
don't mind if we come into their
homes to cook and clean, but
when we stand up and speak out,
they get afraid. We want to know
why."
"The purpose of the conference
is to enable black and white
women to speak frankly and
honestly.
Stop Pretending
"Black and white women have
got to stop pretending with each
other," Mrs. Skinner said. "They
never talk about the deep
conflicts which exist between
them."
"At the conference everyone
will have the chance to say what is
on her mind. I'm not saying they
won't be put down for what they
say but they won't be shut up
either," she added.
Mrs. Gertrude Wilks, founder of
Mothers for Equal Education
(MEE), the organization which
sponsors the conference, hopes it
will bring about changes of
behavior in both the black and
white communities.

"Black women have got to
speak out if changes are to be
made and white women have got
to listen," says Mrs. Wilks.
"Whites have got to learn to
respect the black community.
They can't assume the right to
speak for the needs of the black
community. We have to do what
we see needs to be done. We have
to control our own community."
"One of the main questions to
be answered at the conference is:
why do white women come into
the black community to work?"
said Mrs. Wilks. "It should not be
their personal decision to come,

"But the issues are the same,"
Mrs. Skinner noted.
Indian Women
The conference concludes with
a banquet including speeches by
Mrs. Wilks, who is also director of
Nairobi High School, and an
Indian woman representing the
Indian group on Alcatraz.
"We don't expect miracles from
the conference," Mrs. Skinner
said, "but we hope all the women
will come away with a better
understanding of themselves and
others. We hope the unspoken
crisis between black and white
women will become a spoken
one."
Registration for the conference
to be held at Garden Oaks Junior
High School in East Palo Alto,
may be made by contacting the
MEE office, 2358 University

GET IT TOGETHERâ€”BIack and white women will meet together this weekend
to discuss tensions between them. The conference wili be held in East Palo
Alto, and has been planned by women's organizations there.
Why do black and white
women feel the need to pretend
with each other?
Why is the white woman afraid
of the black woman?
Why is the black woman
"uptight" about black men dating
white women?
What effect does the tension
between white and black mothers
have on their children?
These are only a few of the
questions to be discussed by black
and white women from the Bay
Area and southern California in a
two-day conference beginning
tonight in East Palo Alto.
According to Mrs. Byron Skinner,
chairman of the conference,
approximately 300 to 500
students, housewives, and
professional women are expected
to attend.
Gut-Level Discussion
"It's time for a gut-level
discussion between black and
white women on the tensions
which have separated them for
two hundred years," said Mrs.
Skinner.
"The roots of the problem are
deep," Mrs. Skinner emphasized.
"White women have been taught
from generation to generation to
treat us as subservients. They
don't mind if we come into their
homes to cook and clean, but
when we stand up and speak out,
they get afraid. We want to know
why."
"The purpose of the conference
is to enable black and white
women to speak frankly and
honestly.
Stop Pretending
"Black and white women have
got to stop pretending with each
other," Mrs. Skinner said. "They
never talk about the deep
conflicts which exist between
them."
"At the conference everyone
will have the chance to say what is
on her mind. I'm not saying they
won't be put down for what they
say but they won't be shut up
either," she added.
Mrs. Gertrude Wilks, founder of
Mothers for Equal Education
(MEE), the organization which
sponsors the conference, hopes it
will bring about changes of
behavior in both the black and
white communities.

"Black women have got to
speak out if changes are to be
made and white women have got
to listen," says Mrs. Wilks.
"Whites have got to learn to
respect the black community.
They can't assume the right to
speak for the needs of the black
community. We have to do what
we see needs to be done. We have
to control our own community."
"One of the main questions to
be answered at the conference is:
why do white women come into
the black community to work?"
said Mrs. Wilks. "It should not be
their personal decision to come,
but the decision of the black
community."
She points out that blacks can't
decide to go into the white
community to work.
"In fact, two years ago when I
went into the white community
to talk to white women about
equal education, I was evicted by
the police three times."
Interracial Dating
Another issue to be discussed at
the conference is the tension
created by interracial dating.
Shirley Allen, a black Stanford
student who plans to attend the
conference, described how a black
woman feels when she sees a black
man with a white woman.
"There are more women than
men in the black community. So
when I see a black man with a
white chick, I feel she has taken
one of our fish out of the sea,"
she said. "I look at her and I can't
believe she knows shit about the
struggle Tie faces as a black man. I
look at him and ask why I have
turned natural when he still likes
straight hair. We have enough to
worry about as black women,
without that hassle. It's
unnecessary. White women don't
have it."
Asked why she plans to attend
the cortference, she said she
wanted to hear how other sisters
feel in the same situation and how
older white women feel about
interracial dating.
Midnight Seance
The two day conference is
divided into three parts: a
simulated seance at midnight
tonight, speakers and small group
discussions all day Saturday, and a
banquet Saturday night.

"Midnight was chosen for the
first session because poor mothers
with young children have
difficulty getting out of their
homes early in the evening," Mrs.
Skinner explained. "We also
thought it was an exciting and
different idea. Midnight is a quiet
time, and we hope the first session
will set the mood for the entire
conference.
"For Saturday we have invited
women who are not necessarily
known speakers but who
represent a variety of perspectives
on the issues of the conference,"
Mrs. Skinner said.
The small group discussions on
Saturday will center around
Margaret Walker's Jubilee which
all women attending the
conference are asked to read. The
novel deals with the attitudes of
black and white women about
each other in the Civil War era.
"But the issues are the same,"
Mrs. Skinner noted.

Mrs. Wilks, who is also director of
