Dope & Ether
The recipe for ether-processed
marijuana which was printed in
yesterday's Chaparral is
dangerous, according to I.L.
Beauchamp, occupational health
engineer for the campus.
Beauchamp called the Daily last

night to relate several dangers in
the process. As stated in the
Chaparral article, ether fumes are
highly flammable, and are
dangerous when inhaled.
Beauchamp added that if an
experimenting student got hold of
some slightly old ether, it could
contain explosive peroxides.
Peroxides are poisonous, and the
chemical effect with marijuana is
unknown.
He added that if students have
any questions about handling
hazardous chemicals such as ether,
they may reach him at his Encina
office, or call at extension 2308.
Students however are reminded
that Beauchamp is a University
employee and probably a member
of Establishment.
