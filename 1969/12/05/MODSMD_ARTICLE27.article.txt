# Proposed Deanship Still Vacant
## 
### LESLIE CAMPBELL 
Undergraduates might not
know it, but they are deanless.
According to Prof. Mason Yearian
of physics, head of the Search
Committee to find a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies,
undergraduates will probably
remain in this deanless state until
the next academic year.
The search is on. Prof. Yearian
says that "suggestions for possible
candidates can be made to the
Chairman of the [Search]
Committee, or to any other
member of the committee."
The search for a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies is the
direct result of a recommendation
made last year in the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
reports.
"A new administrative position,
Dean of Undergraduate Studies,
should be established to exercise
continuing review of Stanford's
education of undergraduates, to
support and maintain what is
good, to aid in the renovation of
what is adequate, and to stimulate
and assist educational
innovation," the report says.
Prior to the SES report, the job
of heading undergraduate studies
was a dual position. There was a
Dean of Undergraduate Education
and a Director of General Studies,
each with their respective
committees.
The Dean of Undergraduate
Education had too many of the
Director of General Studies'
worries and was unable to cope

with the job as it was undefined at
the time. He left Stanford in
1961.
Requirements 'Restrictive'
The requirements prescribed by
the old General Studies Program
were, as Yearian admitted, "too
restrictive." The SES Report on
Undergraduate Education insisted
that "it is a sad fact that many of
our best students see the
prescriptiveness of the General
Studies Program as a symbol of
the faculty's lack of concern with
undergraduate education. Detailed
rules like those set out are viewed
as what Prof. Brooks Otis has
called 'general education by the
registrar's office."
The Search Committee has
already been formed. President
Pitzer and the Senate Committee
on Committees have already
appointed Professors Lawrence
Altman, chemistry; Herbert
Packer, law; Lawrence Ryan,
English and associate dean of
humanities and sciences; William
Reynolds, mechanical engineering;
Lewis Spitz, history; Morris
Zelditch, Jr., sociology; and
students Marshall Kildul'f, a junior
in history; Bradley Mac Lean, a
sophomore in philosophy; and
Philip Taubman, a senior in
history.
Pitzer named Yearian as
chairman of the Search
Committee. Vice President and
Provost Richard Lyman will serve
as an ex-officio member.
Job 'Challenging'
Yearian described his job as

"very challenging." He added that
his committee is a "good
committee; everyone is dedicated
and willing to v/ork hard."
The Dean of Undergraduate
Studies will be, Yearian said,
"responsible for innovative
problems in undergraduate

education and will cooperate with
school deans." The latter,
according to Yearian, will be the
Dean's major function.
Presently there is not enough
emphasis on undergraduate
courses and requirements in the
schools involved, Yearian claims;
most importantly the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the
School of Earth Science, and the
School of Engineering. The jiew
Dean will organize inter-school
and inter-departmental programs
so that undergraduate
requirements will be coherent.
According to Yearian,
approximately 92% of
undergraduate courses are
connected with the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Pjtzer
said, "Without precluding oilier
possibilities, it is our view thaf. the

Dean should be sought from
within the University and from
the faculty of the School of
Humanities and Sciences."
The new Dean will have an
operative staff and a budget, as
well as the Committee of
Undergraduate Studies.
Responsibilities Var>
Jobs falling partially under the
jurisdiction of the new Dean
include the hiring and promoting
of faculty and tenure decisions.
The SES Reports and Yearian
both state that the Dean and
Committee of Undergraduate
Studies must place more emphasis
on teaching, as opposed to
research, in evaluating faculty.
Yearian was eager to admit that
"in recognizing the excellence of
the faculty at Stanford, teaching
ability tends to get slighted in
some departments relative to
research." Yearian suggested that
the new Dean's position in the
faculty appointment process be
midway between the level of the
school dean and the school's
Committee on Appointments and
Promotions.
Taubman stressed "we are
looking for a man who does not
exist." He explained the viscious
circle. "We are looking for a man
who is interested in
undergraduates and is a respected
scholar, but a man who must
administer in many cases his own
colleagues, and thus perhaps lose
his respect as a fellow scholar."
The Dean's findings will go
directly to the Provosts and the
President. Yearian explained that
the Dean's position in university
government is a delicate situation.
"It will be a strange symbiotic
relationship; a little higher and a
little lower than department deans
in different ways."
Deanless undergraduates should
not be disillusioned. Check out
our faculty for potential deans,
inform the Search Committee of
your discoveries, and maybeby the
next academic year you wiil be
more lucky.

"A new administrative position,
Dean of Undergraduate Studies,
should be established to exercise
continuing review of Stanford's
education of undergraduates, to
support and maintain what is
good, to aid in the renovation of
what is adequate, and to stimulate
and assist educational
innovation," the report says.
Prior to the SES report, the job
of heading undergraduate studies
was a dual position. There was a
Dean of Undergraduate Education
and a Director of General Studies,
each with their respective
committees.
The Dean of Undergraduate
Education had too many of the
Director of General Studies'
worries and was unable to cope

with the job as it was undefined at
the time. He left Stanford in
1961.
Requirements 'Restrictive'
The requirements prescribed by
the old General Studies Program
were, as Yearian admitted, "too
restrictive." The SES Report on
Undergraduate Education insisted
that "it is a sad fact that many of
our best students see the
prescriptiveness of the General
Studies Program as a symbol of
the faculty's lack of concern with
undergraduate education. Detailed
rules like those set out are viewed
as what Prof. Brooks Otis has
called 'general education by the
registrar's office."
The Search Committee has
already been formed. President
Pitzer and the Senate Committee
on Committees have already
appointed Professors Lawrence
Altman, chemistry; Herbert
Packer, law; Lawrence Ryan,
English and associate dean of
humanities and sciences; William
Reynolds, mechanical engineering;
Lewis Spitz, history; Morris
Zelditch, Jr., sociology; and
students Marshall Kildul'f, a junior
in history; Bradley Mac Lean, a
sophomore in philosophy; and
Philip Taubman, a senior in
history.
Pitzer named Yearian as
chairman of the Search
Committee. Vice President and
Provost Richard Lyman will serve
as an ex-officio member.
Job 'Challenging'
Yearian described his job as

"very challenging." He added that
his committee is a "good
committee; everyone is dedicated
and willing to v/ork hard."
The Dean of Undergraduate
Studies will be, Yearian said,
"responsible for innovative
problems in undergraduate

education and will cooperate with
school deans." The latter,
according to Yearian, will be the
Dean's major function.
Presently there is not enough
emphasis on undergraduate
courses and requirements in the
schools involved, Yearian claims;
most importantly the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the
School of Earth Science, and the
School of Engineering. The jiew
Dean will organize inter-school
and inter-departmental programs
so that undergraduate
requirements will be coherent.
According to Yearian,
approximately 92% of
undergraduate courses are
connected with the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Pjtzer
said, "Without precluding oilier
possibilities, it is our view thaf. the

Dean should be sought from
within the University and from
the faculty of the School of
Humanities and Sciences."
The new Dean will have an
operative staff and a budget, as
well as the Committee of
Undergraduate Studies.
Responsibilities Var>
Jobs falling partially under the
jurisdiction of the new Dean
include the hiring and promoting
of faculty and tenure decisions.
The SES Reports and Yearian
both state that the Dean and
Committee of Undergraduate
Studies must place more emphasis
on teaching, as opposed to
research, in evaluating faculty.
Yearian was eager to admit that
"in recognizing the excellence of
the faculty at Stanford, teaching
ability tends to get slighted in
some departments relative to
research." Yearian suggested that
the new Dean's position in the
faculty appointment process be
midway between the level of the
school dean and the school's
Committee on Appointments and
Promotions.
Taubman stressed "we are
looking for a man who does not
exist." He explained the viscious
circle. "We are looking for a man
who is interested in
undergraduates and is a respected
scholar, but a man who must
administer in many cases his own
colleagues, and thus perhaps lose
his respect as a fellow scholar."
The Dean's findings will go
directly to the Provosts and the
President. Yearian explained that
the Dean's position in university
government is a delicate situation.
"It will be a strange symbiotic
relationship; a little higher and a
little lower than department deans
in different ways."
Deanless undergraduates should
not be disillusioned. Check out
our faculty for potential deans,
inform the Search Committee of
your discoveries, and maybeby the
next academic year you wiil be
more lucky.

Undergraduates might not
know it, but they are deanless.
According to Prof. Mason Yearian
of physics, head of the Search
Committee to find a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies,
undergraduates will probably
remain in this deanless state until
the next academic year.
The search is on. Prof. Yearian
says that "suggestions for possible
candidates can be made to the
Chairman of the [Search]
Committee, or to any other
member of the committee."
The search for a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies is the
direct result of a recommendation
made last year in the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
reports.

the time. He left Stanford in
1961.
Requirements 'Restrictive'
The requirements prescribed by
the old General Studies Program
were, as Yearian admitted, "too
restrictive." The SES Report on
Undergraduate Education insisted
that "it is a sad fact that many of
our best students see the
prescriptiveness of the General
Studies Program as a symbol of
the faculty's lack of concern with
undergraduate education. Detailed
rules like those set out are viewed
as what Prof. Brooks Otis has
called 'general education by the
registrar's office."
The Search Committee has
already been formed. President
Pitzer and the Senate Committee
on Committees have already
appointed Professors Lawrence
Altman, chemistry; Herbert
Packer, law; Lawrence Ryan,
English and associate dean of
humanities and sciences; William
Reynolds, mechanical engineering;
Lewis Spitz, history; Morris
Zelditch, Jr., sociology; and
students Marshall Kildul'f, a junior
in history; Bradley Mac Lean, a
sophomore in philosophy; and
Philip Taubman, a senior in
history.
Pitzer named Yearian as
chairman of the Search
Committee. Vice President and
Provost Richard Lyman will serve
as an ex-officio member.
Job 'Challenging'
Yearian described his job as

"very challenging." He added that
his committee is a "good
committee; everyone is dedicated
and willing to v/ork hard."
The Dean of Undergraduate
Studies will be, Yearian said,
"responsible for innovative
problems in undergraduate

education and will cooperate with
school deans." The latter,
according to Yearian, will be the
Dean's major function.
Presently there is not enough
emphasis on undergraduate
courses and requirements in the
schools involved, Yearian claims;
most importantly the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the
School of Earth Science, and the
School of Engineering. The jiew
Dean will organize inter-school
and inter-departmental programs
so that undergraduate
requirements will be coherent.
According to Yearian,
approximately 92% of
undergraduate courses are
connected with the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Pjtzer
said, "Without precluding oilier
possibilities, it is our view thaf. the

Dean should be sought from
within the University and from
the faculty of the School of
Humanities and Sciences."
The new Dean will have an
operative staff and a budget, as
well as the Committee of
Undergraduate Studies.
Responsibilities Var>
Jobs falling partially under the
jurisdiction of the new Dean
include the hiring and promoting
of faculty and tenure decisions.
The SES Reports and Yearian
both state that the Dean and
Committee of Undergraduate
Studies must place more emphasis
on teaching, as opposed to
research, in evaluating faculty.
Yearian was eager to admit that
"in recognizing the excellence of
the faculty at Stanford, teaching
ability tends to get slighted in
some departments relative to
research." Yearian suggested that
the new Dean's position in the
faculty appointment process be
midway between the level of the
school dean and the school's
Committee on Appointments and
Promotions.
Taubman stressed "we are
looking for a man who does not
exist." He explained the viscious
circle. "We are looking for a man
who is interested in
undergraduates and is a respected
scholar, but a man who must
administer in many cases his own
colleagues, and thus perhaps lose
his respect as a fellow scholar."
The Dean's findings will go
directly to the Provosts and the
President. Yearian explained that
the Dean's position in university
government is a delicate situation.
"It will be a strange symbiotic
relationship; a little higher and a
little lower than department deans
in different ways."
Deanless undergraduates should
not be disillusioned. Check out
our faculty for potential deans,
inform the Search Committee of
your discoveries, and maybeby the
next academic year you wiil be
more lucky.

Undergraduates might not
know it, but they are deanless.
According to Prof. Mason Yearian
of physics, head of the Search
Committee to find a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies,
undergraduates will probably
remain in this deanless state until
the next academic year.
The search is on. Prof. Yearian
says that "suggestions for possible
candidates can be made to the
Chairman of the [Search]
Committee, or to any other
member of the committee."
The search for a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies is the
direct result of a recommendation
made last year in the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
reports.
"A new administrative position,
Dean of Undergraduate Studies,
should be established to exercise
continuing review of Stanford's
education of undergraduates, to
support and maintain what is
good, to aid in the renovation of
what is adequate, and to stimulate
and assist educational
innovation," the report says.
Prior to the SES report, the job
of heading undergraduate studies
was a dual position. There was a
Dean of Undergraduate Education
and a Director of General Studies,
each with their respective
committees.
The Dean of Undergraduate
Education had too many of the
Director of General Studies'
worries and was unable to cope

with the job as it was undefined at
the time. He left Stanford in
1961.
