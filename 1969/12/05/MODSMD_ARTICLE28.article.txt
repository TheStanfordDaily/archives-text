# SRI Trial Defense Disputes Prosecution
## 
### 
The defense yesterday called
three witnesses in the most recent
trial arising from last spring's SRI
disruptions attempting to
discredit the story of the Palo
Alto Times' photographer
allegedly assaulted.
In the first day of defense
testimony, the three Stanford
students all testified that they say
the photographer, Gene Tupper,
involved in two separate incidents,
the first minor and the second the
one in which his film was taken
from him.
The defense maintains that
Tupper is confusing the two
incidents and accusing the
defendants, Stanford student,
John Shoch, and non-students
Mike Vawter and his wife Jan, of
assault and battery falsely.
Allegedly, he was |hown films and
pictures after the incident by the
police showing the defendants
with Tupper. Tupper then
assumed they were involved in the
assault and told police so.

In testimony Wednesday
Tupper identified each of the
defendants as members of a gang
of the demonstrators who
accosted him during the May 16
demonstration at Page Mill Road
and Hanover Street in the
Stanford Industrial Park.
Yesterday, Senior Dennis
Perluss testified that he observed
two separate actions involving
Tupper and demonstrators. He
added he did not recall the
presence of any of the three
defendants accused of roughing
up Tupper.
Weak and Trivial
Yale Braunstein, graduate
student in economics, and
sophomore Steve Savory likewise
testified that Tupper was involved
in two incidents. The first
allegedly was a minor incident
which defense attorney James
Wolpman has called the "weakest,
most trivial assault and battery
case."
The second incident was,
according to other testimony, a
10 minute encounter in which
Tupper claimed that he was
pushed down, that his watch was
temporarily lost and camera
around his neck snatched away.
He also declared that the
assailants demanded that he open
the camera and then stole the film
inside.

The defense hopes to
distinguish for the jury the two
incidents and show that the
defendants might have been
involved in the first but that no
evidence links them to the actual
assault.
The prosecution attempted to
discredit the witnesses and
therefore their testimony. The
deputy district attorneys tried to
discover any link between Steve
Savory and the April 3rd
Movement. They asked him if he
belonged to the movement and if
he helped to put up the barricade.
Evidently, it was hoped that by
identifying him with the
movement and participation in
the demonstrations, they might
question the credibility of the
witness.
Defense attorney Wolpman
indicated that the first incident
occurred when Mrs. Vawter
attempted to talk to Tupper
about his picture taking. Tupper
"behaved contemptuously to her
and shunted her aside," according
to Wolpman.
Vawter came into the incident
when Tupper allegedly pushed
Mrs. Vawter. Wolpman claimed
that during their short encounter
Tupper grabbed Vawter and
pushed him aside.
