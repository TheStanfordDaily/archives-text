# No Decision In Rupert Case

### 
A decision in anti-draft activist
Paul Rupert's legal battle to stay
out of the army was put off by
Judge Stanley Weigle pending
review of similar cases by the
Supreme Court.
"I've never seen a judge so
sympathetic," smiled Rupert, who
was involved in last spring's April
Third Movement as well as the
Resistance.
"When he told us that he was
going to wait until the Supreme
Court decided, he said a lot of
things that showed he was
against the draft," said Rupert.
Federal judge Weigle reduced bail
Wednesday for Black Panther
leader David Billiard from
$50,000 to $30,000.
Though Rupert feels it is
unlikely he will I be acquitted,
Weigle may give him a light
sentence such as social work or
teaching.
The draft resister, who worked
for the United Campus Ministry
last year, bases his defense on two
other contested cases up for
Supreme Court review. The first
argues that the framers of the
Constitution never intended to
give the government the power to
conscript citizens for the army.
The second case attacks the
conscientious objector clause of
the Selective Service Act. In part
this defense argues that using
religion as a criteria is a violation
Of the First Amendment
guaranteeing freedom of religion.
The Supreme Court is not
Expected to hand down a decision
until March, according to Rupert.
