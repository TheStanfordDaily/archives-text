# Men May Get More On-Campus Housing
## 
### 
The on-campus housing
situation at Stanford certainly
can't get much worse, and
improving things isn't an easy
task. But plans are in the offing to
at least make a dent in the
housing crush both for the
upcoming Winter Quarter and for
the 1970-71 school year.
A committee of eight students
and three faculty members is
currently working in conjunction
with Assistant Dean of S* f s
Bill Leland to come Up wi<
residence configuration
next year. The comn is
already met three tirr is
hoping to come up me
decisions by the end o.
The on-campus housing
situation is expected to improve
next quarter for men. but little

for women, Associate Dean of
Students Bill Leland said.
There are about 60 men on the
wait list for on-campus housing
and most of them are expected to
be accommodated in one of three
houses with large numbers of
vacancies.
However, women, and
particularly women transfers, are
worse off than the men.
The Housing Office tried to
ameliorate the situation by
creating coed dorms in Durand
and Burba iik. Durand opposed
going coed in a formal vote, and
Burbank's reaction was so
negative that a vote was not
taken.
The unusual step of asking
houses to go coed was taken
because "the proposition was that
the female housing situation
might be improved if it coincided
with the desires of the houses. We
just wanted to give them an
opportunity to say yes or no,"
Leland said.
The situation might still be
remedied however by trying to
put more women in Manzanita
Park. With a ratio of three males
for every women, it may be
difficult to fit many more women
in.
However the housing office
hopes that it can consolidate
those trailers which have men
leaving, so that more spaces will
be opened for women.
Leland admitted that the
student advisory committee on
housing was not consulted before
asking the two houses to go coed.
"We felt that it wasn't the
committees' immediate concern:
in a change of this kind the most
important views are those of the
houses concerned," Leland
commented.
The members of the Residence
Configuration committee, in
addition to Leland, are faculty
members Jim Glenn, director of
Wilbur Hall; Larry Horton, faculty
resident in Branner; Mike Boyle;
and students Carry Ridder; Chris
Harte (Chairman); Julie Forrester;
Dennis Shaver; Cliff Halverson;
Ken Flamm; Francine Tilton; and
Ralph Peterson.

creating coed dorms in Durand
and Burba iik. Durand opposed
going coed in a formal vote, and
Burbank's reaction was so
negative that a vote was not
taken.
The unusual step of asking
houses to go coed was taken
because "the proposition was that
the female housing situation
might be improved if it coincided
with the desires of the houses. We
just wanted to give them an
opportunity to say yes or no,"
Leland said.
The situation might still be
remedied however by trying to
put more women in Manzanita
Park. With a ratio of three males
for every women, it may be
difficult to fit many more women
in.
However the housing office
hopes that it can consolidate
those trailers which have men
leaving, so that more spaces will
be opened for women.
Leland admitted that the
student advisory committee on
housing was not consulted before
asking the two houses to go coed.
"We felt that it wasn't the
committees' immediate concern:
in a change of this kind the most
important views are those of the
houses concerned," Leland
commented.
The members of the Residence
Configuration committee, in
addition to Leland, are faculty
members Jim Glenn, director of
Wilbur Hall; Larry Horton, faculty
resident in Branner; Mike Boyle;

Harte (Chairman); Julie Forrester;
Dennis Shaver; Cliff Halverson;

The on-campus housing
situation at Stanford certainly
can't get much worse, and
improving things isn't an easy
task. But plans are in the offing to
at least make a dent in the
housing crush both for the
upcoming Winter Quarter and for
the 1970-71 school year.
A committee of eight students
and three faculty members is
currently working in conjunction
with Assistant Dean of S* f s
Bill Leland to come Up wi<
residence configuration
next year. The comn is
already met three tirr is
hoping to come up me
decisions by the end o.
The on-campus housing
situation is expected to improve
next quarter for men. but little

for women, Associate Dean of
Students Bill Leland said.
There are about 60 men on the
wait list for on-campus housing
and most of them are expected to
be accommodated in one of three
houses with large numbers of
vacancies.
However, women, and
particularly women transfers, are
worse off than the men.

ameliorate the situation by
creating coed dorms in Durand
