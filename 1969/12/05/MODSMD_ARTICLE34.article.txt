# Homeward Bound Or On The Ground

### TOM GIVEN 
Airlines may be the wings of
man, but without a reservation,
Christmas vacation travel becomes
a matter of sticking out one's
thumb on the Bay shore.
Unless you live somewhere near
to the Farm, your Christmas plans

will probably include a flight on a
commercial airline. That isâ€”it
should include a flight.
Space is going fast by all
indications. One student, calling
for a flight to Detroit for finals
week, had to call three lines
before finding a seat on a
convenient flight.
Similar experiences are awaiting
students trekking beyond the
Rockies to points east including
Chicago, New York, Boston, and
Philadelphia.
Heavy Booking
A United Air Lines reservation
clerk noted that, "We're starting
to book very heavily ... in fact,
most coachseats are sold out after
the eighteenth."
TWA said that some of their
flights east were already filled,
though spaces are still to be had
until the 1 7th.
The most emphatic notes of
panic arise from the throats of
American and Delta clerks.
American Airlines is asking all
passengers to pick up their tickets
a week in advance, or no
reservation. Delta, while allowing

passengers to pick up tickets an
hour before holiday flights, has
little left to offer.
"Between the 19th and the
22nd, the only seats available are
first class," warned a reservation
clerk. "We are taking names off
waiting lists already, and have
placed many people on their
desired flights."
Delta Does 11
Delta, of course, is the only
airline that will offer the student
confirmed holiday reservations at
a discount 75%. Since the rate
changes this fall, other airlines are
now charging from 60-80% for
standby tickets, though little luck
awaits the standby passenger for
the next few weeks.
If getting there is half the fun,
then getting back can only be
described as a pain. One ticket
clerk simply stated, "It is almost
impossible to get back to San
Francisco from anywhere in the
states."
Don't Try for the 3rd
A quick check of major airlines
confirms that traveling on the
third or fourth of January is not

in one's stars unless one has a
reservation.
All of which brings to mind
some of the aeronautical mishaps
this reporter has suffered at the
hands of the nation's airlines. One
Thanksgiving saw as a last resort a
three-stop four-hour flight from
Chicago on Braniff (known in
Texas as Goniff) Airlines. The
food was good, the stewardesses
humane, but there is little
incentive in this world to rouse
one from bed in order to catch a
5:00 a.m. flight that stops in
Kansas City, Wichita and
Oklahoma City.
A similar fate was once at hand
on a flight from El Paso to Austin
via the once-famous TTA (Trans
Texas Airlines to the FAA, but
Trick-or-Treat Airlines to its
passengers). Perhaps the bumpiest
flight since Lindberg was

Craftsmen"

interrupted only by a stewardess
spilling coffee over the man across
the aisle and a curt notification
that we were approximately 2,000
feet over the highest mountain in
the state.
Some lessons do sink in,
however; this year reservations are
in order and all is well with the
world. One can avoid finals or
registration, but in this country
the airlines have their schedules.
A check with the registrar's
office indicates that there are of
yet no contingency plans to hold
alternative registration in
Chicago-O 'Hare, New
York-Kennedy, or Los Angeles
International airports.
Students are advised that
waiting lists are being made for
space in Mem Aud . . . though one
is smart to reconfirm a week in
advance . . . Please check in thirty
minutes in advance and stow your
baggage under your seat . . .
