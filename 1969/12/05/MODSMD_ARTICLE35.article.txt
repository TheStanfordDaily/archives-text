There is really no excuse for
the bidding on this hand. As for
North-South, North should have
quietly passed 2 Hearts, and
South should have even more
quietly passed North's raise.
As for East-West, they may
have the balance of the points,
but it's a little difficult to see how
they can get into the action.
Anyhow, South felt somewhat
sick when he saw dummy come
down. But, taking a deep breath
and murmuring "Mission
Impossible," he set out to do his
best, praying for a little help from
his friends.
He ducked the excellent
opening lead in dummy and

captured East's jack with his king.
Feeling an urgent need for some
spade ruffs in dummy, he led a
small spade out of his hand. West
tried to 'take the trick with his
eight, but East was forced to win
with his jack.
Somehow, East couldn't find
the return of a heart. He decided
to lead the club ten (a
pseudo-falsecard?) and South
began to smile when dummy's
queen took the trick.
He cashed the diamond ace in
preparation to starting a
cross-ruff. His eyes popped,
however, on the next trick. He
lead a small diamond from
dummy and didn't know what to
think when East produced the
king (I don't really know what
West was thinking either).
He quickly ruffed (to West's
dismay), and proceeded to
continue his cross-ruff. He ruffed
a spade in dummy with the nine
of trumps, crossed to his hand
with the club ace, ruffed another
spade with the heart ace, cashed
the damond queen (pitching a
spade) and then ruffed a club in
his hand.
He now quietly led a spade,
losing his second trick to West's
queen, and had to take one of the

last two tricks with his 10-7 of
trumps behind East's Q-8.
Making four.
"Thank's for the raise," South
mumbled to his partner, as he
quietly collapsed in his chair.
