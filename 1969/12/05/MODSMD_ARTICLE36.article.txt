## A
						Trip In Time Saves Nine 
### 
(World-Wide Money Converter &
Tipping Guide, by Richard
Joseph; Doubleday, 99 pp.,
$1.50.)
By APHLINGO T. McNAUGHT
Doubleday has come out with a
new edition that should be
extremely useful for students
going overseas to have fun at an
overseas campus. Richard Joseph s
World Wide Money Converter and
Tipping Guide should be in the
hands of every student who tries
to tip at the local minimum (an
old Stanford custom. One theory
holds that little Leland was
murdered by a group of irate
Florentine waiter whom he tipped
too little.)
Unfortunately Joseph's makes
some critical omissions. He

neglects to mention that the
pound sterling is being
decimalized in February 1971,
and refuses to print the new
tables.
The new tables would be useful
in converting new money to old
money quicker than the locals,
who would be impressed at the
rapidity of your calculations.
lie also makes the mistake of
listing the halfcrown as a current
coin in spite of the fact that it

goes out of circulation before the
book's effect date.
Of interest to those students
with draft lottery numbers in the
first third of the list is the
conversion table for Thai
currency. Unfortunately
Vietnamese and Laotian
currencies are left out. Jewish
students will find the inclusion of
Jordanian and Egyptian currencies
useful at some indefinite date.
Above all we found this book
an exciting and interesting sage of
world money.
(Note to Econ 1 students: It's
small enough to smuggle into the
exam. Then you can discuss Thai
monetary problems sagaciously. It
might just hell) you pull out the
course.)
