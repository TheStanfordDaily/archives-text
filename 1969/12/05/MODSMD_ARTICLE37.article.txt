## Campus Could Get a Charge Out of Anti-Pollution Weapon

A possible answer to pollution
couldn't very well roar into town
in a cloud of smoke, instead it
hummed in.
The Electramite, an all electric
two-wheeled mini-bike, made its
Stanford debut Wednesday
outside of Meyer library. The
vehicle startled both cyclists and
pedestrians as it silently weaved
among them powered by a twelve
volt battery.
Zipping along at 20 to 40 miles
an hour (depending on the gear
sprocket), the Electramite costs
less than a penny a day to run;
needs no gas, oil, or water; no
clutch or gears; and produces no
fumes, oil drippings, or fire
hazards. The noise and pollution
of cars and motorcycles is
eliminated, but not the fun of
driving.
The Daily conducted an
exclusive road-test and found the
seat comfortable, the brakes good,
the steering responsive, the
acceleration quick, and the
suspension non-existant. This last
factor made the going rough on
uneven pavement but aside from
this, the mini-bike proved a fun

and efficient way to travel around
campus.
Charge It
The battery must be charged at
least every fifty miles, a process
requiring 2Vi hours. The battery
and battery charger are not
included in the whopping $169
price oT the bike, but several
owners could share a common
charger. The incredibly low
upkeep more than just'Hes the
initial price.
For the man who might want
to spend more, distributor Tom
Deane offers accessories of
windshields, chargers, fenders,
mirrors, horns, and lights which
could make the Electramite street
licenseable.
The license proved a problem
here on campus, the test drivers
were apprehended b' the
Stanford Police on their eys
and were informed that tor
vehicle could not be drive ihe
sidewalks and that an ur sed
vehicle couldn't use the ets.
Not much was left exc». the
dorm halls which provided a new
test track.
Bob Vannest, a Stern Hall
resident who will be
demonstrating the bike through
Monday commented he was going
to try and convince the police to
allow the Electramite on campus
since their objections to
mini-bikes had been the noise and
fire-hazards in the past and they
don't apfaly here.


IM) I, L DTI ON SOLUTION—Tho
Klectramite hummed onlo campus the

lan-enforcement officers. A possible
answer to the horrors of the
internal-comhustion engine, the
two-wheeled vehicle lias excellent parts
and no suspension.

among them powered by a twelve
volt battery.
Zipping along at 20 to 40 miles
an hour (depending on the gear
sprocket), the Electramite costs
less than a penny a day to run;
needs no gas, oil, or water; no
clutch or gears; and produces no
fumes, oil drippings, or fire
hazards. The noise and pollution
of cars and motorcycles is
eliminated, but not the fun of
driving.
The Daily conducted an
exclusive road-test and found the
seat comfortable, the brakes good,
the steering responsive, the
acceleration quick, and the
suspension non-existant. This last
factor made the going rough on
uneven pavement but aside from
this, the mini-bike proved a fun

and efficient way to travel around
campus.
Charge It
The battery must be charged at
least every fifty miles, a process
requiring 2Vi hours. The battery
and battery charger are not
included in the whopping $169
price oT the bike, but several
owners could share a common
charger. The incredibly low
upkeep more than just'Hes the
initial price.
For the man who might want
to spend more, distributor Tom
Deane offers accessories of
windshields, chargers, fenders,
mirrors, horns, and lights which
could make the Electramite street
licenseable.
The license proved a problem
here on campus, the test drivers
were apprehended b' the
Stanford Police on their eys
and were informed that tor
vehicle could not be drive ihe
sidewalks and that an ur sed
vehicle couldn't use the ets.
Not much was left exc». the
dorm halls which provided a new
test track.
Bob Vannest, a Stern Hall
resident who will be
demonstrating the bike through
Monday commented he was going
to try and convince the police to
allow the Electramite on campus
since their objections to
mini-bikes had been the noise and
fire-hazards in the past and they
don't apfaly here.

Klectramite hummed onlo campus the
other day, astonishing the local
lan-enforcement officers. A possible
answer to the horrors of the
internal-comhustion engine, the
two-wheeled vehicle lias excellent parts
and no suspension.
A possible answer to pollution
couldn't very well roar into town
in a cloud of smoke, instead it
hummed in.
The Electramite, an all electric
two-wheeled mini-bike, made its
Stanford debut Wednesday
outside of Meyer library. The
vehicle startled both cyclists and
pedestrians as it silently weaved
among them powered by a twelve
volt battery.
