Secretary of Transportation John Volpe yesterday honored Henry
("Bill") Potluck, whose revolutionary new transportation system has
been put into effect by Transunited Airlines and promises to
revolutionize travel in this country.
"The problems of airline crashes and sonic booms stand to be
eliminated due to the efforts of this one man," Volpe commented.
Put into non-technical language, Potluck's development, called the
Molasses Injection System, works this way: A huge tank of molasses is
installed at the rear of the airplane and piped into the engine
openings, which suck it in and pass it through the engine.
Potluck says he first came up with the idea when he saw a catering
truck filled with molasses likewise sucked into a jet engine in a mishap
at Will Rogers International Airport in Oklahoma City. "What would
it be like if only the molasses were sucked in.
As we now know, the result is two-fold: (A.) It sends a strange
combination of cooked molasses and engine fuel out of the other end,
and (B.) It prevents the engine from getting up enough thrust to let
the plane leave the ground.
"I was sure disappointed when 1 found out about part B," Potluck
mentions.
It was only later that he came upon the idea of putting grooves on
the wheels of the airplanes and running the craft along railroad tracks.
"Nobody else seemed to be using the tracks much," he says.
Top Transunited officials were dubious until they found that with
such a plan the aircraft needs no wings.
Stewardesses have remarked that since the top speed is now about
'â€¢) mph, they no longer have trouble serving meals in the time alloted.
>me businessmen had complained that the trips take too long, but
ever since the 2 drink restriction was supplanted by a no-limit policy,
few complaints have been herad.
Additional revenue has been generated for the airline by
reclamation of the cooked molasses and fuel mixture, which they have
marketed in 1 lb. boxes as "Jet-Go, the cereal that almost makes you
take off." The cereal's ad agency, Ed, Ed, Ed, and Harry, has launched
what it calls a modest ad campaign, featuring endorsement of the
cereal by Clement Haynsworth, Barry Goldwater.
The product received negative publicity earlier this year when
Milton Erg of Lompoc, Calif., bought a box of "Jet-Go" which
contained a slightly-mangled dead sea gull.
The problem has now been solved by grinding the material into fine
particles before packaging it.
