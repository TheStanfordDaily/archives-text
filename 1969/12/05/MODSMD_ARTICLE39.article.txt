# Movies: Bits and Pieces
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Max Ophuls' Lola Mantes, now
at the Surf in San Francisco, is a
fine, elegant film which deserves
the attention of anyone who cares
about movies. However, I must
add that the film comes as a slight
disappointment in the light of its
present noteriety and, formerly,
legendary status.
Sparked by Andrew Sams'
proclamatign that Lola Monies is
the greatest film of all time, the
nation's critics have somewhat
overpraised the picture and have
even somewhat enshrouded it
with an unfortunate air of
academic by calling it "a work of
film art." Actually, the fill.l is a
nice period romance, beautifully
and skillfully told.
An additional and indeed, the
most fascinating, dimension of
Ophuls' last picture is the unique
framework through which the
story is told. Lola, a reknowned
dancer and high class courtesan,
succumbs to become a circus
attraction, literally placing her
past and her soul up for public
auction. Answers to the crowd's
personal questions are done in
flashback and make up most of
the film. However, the circus
scenes are by far the most
memorable, as Ophuls stunningly
moves his camera, performers and
circus apparatus ad midst a maze
of billliant light and color.
Basically, the film is not
completely successful because of
its leading lady. When a romantic
film is meant to be
intoxicating—in a film where the
concept of love reaches its most
mystical and magical
proportions—the players must
possess that "certain something"
which raises them above the
ordinary. Talent often has nothing
to do with it, nor can the director
ever make up for slightly deficient
stars by adding even the greatest
amount of his own skill.
Garbo, Dietrich and, more
recently, Francoise Dorleac and
Anna Karina, have all transcended
their vehicles on several occasions
and have made otherwise
mediocre films into intriguing
studies of ambiguous but
fascinating females.
Unfortunately, Martine Carol
doesn't have "it"and some
portions of Lola Montes sink to
the level of soap opera—elegant

and aristocratic, to be sure, but
sudsy nonetheless.
Ustinov does a W.C.
As the ringmaster, Peter
Ustinov is his usual vastly
entertaining self, here coming
across as something like a
French-speaking W.C. Fields.
Anton Walbrook is very
impressive as a Bavarian king who
falls for Lola and Oscar Werner in
1955 looks very much like Oscar
Werner in 1969. As it is, Lola
Monies is very much worth seeing
but don't expect to be completely
overwhelmed.
Lola Monies marks the
beginning of an eleven-week series
of French film classics at the Surf.
Opening on December 25 is my
personal favorite, Children of
Paradise, along with Renoir's A
Day in the Country. Starting
January 1 and Feyder's Carnival
in Flanders and Carne's funny
Bizarre Bizarre and on January 5,
Clair's Under the Bool's of Paris
and Le Million. The rest of the
schedule includes rarely seen films
by Renoir, Virgo, Pagnol and Clair
and ends with another Ophuls, La
Bonde.
Showing now through
December 17 at the Telegraph
Cinema in Berkeley is "a work in
progress" by Jean-Luc Godard
called One American Movie.
Godard has temporarily stopped
work on this project but in the
meantime, producer/photographer

D.A. Pennebaker has assembled
the rushes as a kind of progress
report on Godard.
Godard began the film in the
fall of 1968 and the work being
shown in Berkeley includes the
well publicized sequences with
Eldridge Cleaver, Tom Hayden, Le
Roi Jones and the Jefferson
Airplane, who drove the police
crazy by playing on the roof of a
mid-town Manhattan hotel
Included is footage Pennebaker
shot of Godard making One
American Movie. Also on the bill
is a short in which Godard
answers questions about La
Chinoise, with his replies often
superimposed over the relevant
scenes from the film.

Dead Week Flicks
Film activity at Stanford
subsides greatly during Dead
Week. However, a couple of nice
films as well as an Eisenstein offer
adequate distraction from the
nightly grind.
Showing on Monday in the Art
Auditorium are The New
Improved Inner Argli, Little Jesus,
Physical Fitness, Saint Louis Blues
and Rodia. These experimental
films will be screened at 9 P.M.
Clive Miller will show two
thirties musicals this Tuesday in
Geology 320 and both star Fred
Astair and Ginger Rogers. Swing
Time is one of the team's very
best films, directed by the
estimable George Stevens.
Carefree offers superb songs by
Irving Berlin and nice supporting
work by Jack Carson, Ralph
Bellamy, and the screen's greatest
fruit, Franklin Pangborn.
Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky
is very impressive, even if it does
rank somewhat behind his greatest
films. The famous Battle on the
Ice set a standard for screen
battles to be surpassed in Russia's
recent War and Peace. In
Cubberley at 7:45 on Thursday.
That's it for this quarter.
Highlighting next quarter's film
schedule is a series of neglected
films of the sixties at Tresidder,
which includes Truffaut's Soft
Skin Peckinpali's Ride the High
Country, Demy's Bay of Angels
and Corman's Masque of the Red
Death.


LOVE ON AUCTION: Ringmaster Peter Ustinov presents the main attraction,
Lola Monies (Marline Carol) in Max Ophuls' legendary I'ilm, now at the Surf.
