# Tapedeck, Tuner, and Amp Complete Xmas Stereo Set
## 
### TERRY RUSTIN (Third in a three-part series) 
So far, we have chosen a pair of
speakers (AR-4x), a record
changer (Dual 1212) and a
cartridge (Shure M9IE) for our
complete stereo set. Today we
will add a tape deck, a tuner and
an amplifier.
Tape Decks
The analog of a turntable is a
tape deck. It does not have a
self-contained amplifier and
speaker as do tape recorders; as
turntables do with records, decks
play the tape and feed the
information into the amplifier.
Since you are buying an
amplifier anyway, you can save
some money by purchasing a tape
dock instead of a tape recorder.
Y o u have a superior
amplifier-speaker set, since tape
recorders are restricted in size. Of
course, a tape recorder can be
made to bypass its own amplifier
and feed into the system, but then
you have made it into a tape deck.
Tape decks use heads to read
the magnetic signals on the tape,
just as the stylus and cartridge
transmit the physical information
of the record groove. Heads come
with the deck, and must be cared
for more than a cartridge. They
should be de-magnetized every ten
hours of playing and should be
cleaned more often; replacement
heads are necessary after a few
years. But tape gives superior
sound, never scratches, and it can
be re-used when you tire of Gene
Vincent.
Roberts, Ampex and Teac are
the big names in tape, but the best
deck for the money is probably
the Sony 255. It costs $160, and
all its statistics compare favorably
with decks costs a hundred dollars
more. The Sony people
recommend that you use their
own brand of tape with their
recorders, but any high-quality
brand should work as well.
Sony also makes a fine stereo
tape recorder at a reasonable
price, the TC-200. If you want to
take your tape machine places, to
record albums or amaze your
firends, you'll need a tape
recorder, 112
Tuners
There is a lot of great music
news and information in the
airwaves, a free gift from local
radio stations. All you need to
hear it is a radio; to include a
radio in your stereo system, all
you need is a tuner.
Tuners come as separate
components, or in conjunction
with an amplifier, in which case
they are called "receivers." I feel
that a separate amplifier and tuner
is preferable to a receiver, for the
same reasons I prefer components
over an all-in-one system: more
choice, opportunity to update
separately, repair problems.
Nearly everyone makes a

reasonable tuner for about $100.
The Heath Company, however,
makes an FM tuner as good as any
of the others, in a $58 kit, the
AJ-14. I have not put one
together myself, but friends of
mine and Consumer Reports say
that a reasonably dexterous
person with no technical
background can put the thing
together in four or five hours. The
only tools needed are a
screwdriver, pliers and soldering
iron. Not only do you then have a
fine, inexpensive tuner, but you
made it yourself.
Amplifiers
Choice of amplifiers (or amps)
depends on what it must do; this
is why the amp should be chosen
last. We will need an amp with at
least 30 RMS watts, or about 60
IHF watts, with imputs for tape
deck, tuner and turntable, outputs
for speakers and tape.
Amplifiers increase in price
proportional to their power.
Power is measured in watts, either
IHF (peak output) or RMS
(continuous output). Be sure to
know whether the rating is IHF or
RMS. And there is no reason to
buy more power than you need.
Lafayette makes great
amplifiers and receivers; their new
catalogue lists the LA-324 at $60
and 50 watts IHF, and the
LA-750 at $80 and 80 watts IHF.
The LA-324 is lacking in some
controls that the LA-750 has.
Lafeyette has a store in Mt.
View, but they are poorly stocked
in their own equipment, and it
may take some time to receive a
special order. If they don't have
the equipment you want, you
might try another brand of amp.
Kenwood makes good amps,
only slightly more expensive than
comparable Lafeyette products.
They have an amp rated at 40
watts RMS which sells for $120.
Scott equipment is known to be
quite good, also, but you usually
end up paying for the name more
than the amplifier. The very best
amplifier available, with 100 watts
RMS and so little distortion it
cannot be measured, is the spartan
amp made by Acoustic Research.
It sells, quite fairly, or $23C.
Alco Home Electronics in Los
Altos boasts that they will match
any advertised price by a
competitor, and they quoted
lower prices to me than the other
stores in the area. Any store will
give a big discount if you buy a
complete system; I think you will
find, however, that Alco will
equal any other price.
There you have itâ€”a beautiful
stereo system. AR-4x speakers,
Dual 1212 record changer, Shuro
M9IE cartridge, Sony 255 tape
deck, Heath AJ-14 tuner,
Kenwood or Lafayette amplifier.
This neat little package retails for
$550 to $600. Merrv Christmas.
