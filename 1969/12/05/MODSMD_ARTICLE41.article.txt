## 'Lion' Roars at SRT 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
"Androcles and the Lion" is a
wonderful play; a kind of
Christmas present from George
Bernard Shaw to the world, SRT's
version, which opened Wednesday
night in Memorial Auditorium, is
a lot of fun and is certainly worth
seeing.
Let me say right away that I
liked "Androcles," and some
things about it I liked very much.
For instance, the acting is just
superb. Joseph Brockett is
perhaps a bit too aggressive an
Androcles for my taste, but then
Suzanne Bales' Magaera would
bring out the fighting spirit in any
man.
Will Rogers and
Weaver are fine as the Captain and
as Lavinia, the militant Christian
prisoner. They have the rather
awesome responsibility of
delivering most of the philosophy
and wit which Shaw has alloted to
this particular play, chiefly
concerning the stupidity of
martyrdom. They do it quite well.
Stephen Rosenfield is a very
funny Ceasar, dressed in
horm-rimmed glasses and a cape
emblazoned with dollar signs and
coming across like the first
vice-president of World Wide
Wickets. Stephen Book plays
Ferrovius, the warrior-turned
-Christian, with a hilarious,
ferocious, bear-like quality that
adds a lot of class to an already
impressive show.
The Lion
And finally, Stephen Cramolini
spends the whole play dressed in a
lion suit, crawling about on all
fours, roaring and waltzing. A
virtuoso performance with, alas,
limited career opportunities.
Director Denis Carey has taken
a rather unusual, and often
imaginitive approach, to
"Androcles," and the results,
while generally a lot of fun, are
sometimes a bit disappointing. I
guess I'm just a purist. I like to see
G.B. Shaw unencumbered by
gimmicks, and much of what Mr.

Carey has done in this show is
gimmicky.
For some reason he has found
it desirable to "contemporize" the
Christians, so they are dressed like
street-people. Well, I don't know
why this bothers me, but it does.
The rest of the cast is costumed in
the same spirit (e.g. football
uniforms for the gladiators), and
most of it is quite good, a lot of
fun (especially the Roman
numerals on the gladiators'
jersey).
I don't know why the
hippie-Christians bothered me so
much; perhaps because they were
sometimes so noisy and taken
with stage business that I couldn't
hear the other actors, who
happened to be speaking lines
written by the playwright;
perhaps because they insisted on
singing hymns at great length and
of little relevence to the show,
until I got the impression that Mr.
Carey was trying to stretch Mr.
Shaw's short script to he two-hour
point so the audience would feel
it had gotten its money's worth.
Ostentatious Christians
I don't know. But if those
damned, blaspheming Christians
had been a little less ostentatious,
both visually and audibly, George
Bernard Shaw, Mr. Carey, and
myself would all have benefited.
Perhaps the Romans had the right
idea all along.
In any case, despite the
Christians, the show is really a lot
of fun. Osborne Robinson's sets
are impressive, with fine detail
work that is seldom seen at
Stanford. As I mentioned earlier,
Douglas Russel's costumes can be
a real trip, nd frankly it's a relief
to get away from togas.
John Carney and Hugh
McCarten wrote original music
which was pleasant and melodic,
but which I would prefer to listen
to out of the context of the show.
SRT has given the Stanford
community a wonderful
Christmas present, and those of
you who can escape the lions of
academia in the next two weeks

would be wise to sacrifice a
couple of bucks to the gods of the
theater and enjoy yourselves. And
remember, in the words of Mr.
Shaw himself: "A drama critic is a
man who leaves no turn
unstoned." (Thought I'd just
throw that in!) So go and enjoy.
