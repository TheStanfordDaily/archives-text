## Oakland's 'Faust' Rings True 
### 
Hector Berlioz' dramatic
oratorio, "The Damnation of
Faust," has a long tradition of
controversy which makes any
presentation of the work an
interesting event. In 1828, the
young Berlioz set eight scenes
from Goethe's "Faust" to music.
The resulting score was seen by a
composer friend of the poet, who
described it as a "fragment of an
abortion resulting from a hideous
incest."
Not until eighteen years later
did Berlioz return to "Faust." In
1846 he added a great deal of new
material to some themes from the
"Eight Scenes" and called the
completed composition "The
Damnation of Faust." The first
performance, in December, 1846
was a complete disaster and
contributed to Berlioz' financial
ruin.
Today, after a century of
argument over the quality of the
oratorio's music, its worth Ls
generally well-recognized, and
controversy has centered on how
to present it. Since the first
performance, "The Damnation of
Faust" has been performed
alternately as a "dramatic
oratorio," which was the
composer's original intention, and
as an opera.
The debate on this subject
reached a somewhat hysterical
pitch this summer in London,
when a critic, taking issue with
the operatic staging of the work,

described the Faust as looking and
sounding like a "love-sick goat,"
and the Marguerite as having the
stage presence of a "rabbit." A
representative of the opera
company in question responded
to this review by pointing out that
Berlioz, after the fiasco of the
first performance of the work,
had given his approval to staged
versions.
Imagination Better than Staging
However, after hearing the
Oakland Symphony Orchestra's
December 2nd performance, in
concert form, I would guess that
the listener's imagination is
probably more satisfactory than
any but the best possible staging
could be.
Much of the credit for the
success of the concert should go
to the dynamic, but sensitive
conducting of the orchestra's
Musical Director, Gerhard Samuel.
The orchestra and chorus
generally responded extremely
well to the demands of the work,
which are considerable. The
important quartet of soloists met
their tasks with varying degrees of
ability.
The mezzo-soprano, Beverly
Wolff, as Marguerite, was the star
of the perofrmance, singing with
fervor and beautiful tone, Her two
arias were high-points in the
evening. The Mephistopheles of
the young, black bass-baritone
Simon Estes was nearly as good.
He has a very impressive voice,

and fell short of Miss Wolff only
in a comparative lack of subtlety,
which may be attributed to
inexperience.
Bressler Lacks Power
The title role of Faust was
taken by the tenor Charles
Bressler, who had very good ideas
about the part, and sang tastefully
enough, but his voice lacked
sufficient power and beauty. He
performed best in the quieter
moments of the score, when his
sensitivity was unhampered by
vocal distress.
George Baker, in the bass role
of Brander, a village drunkard,
also had vocal problems. Much of
the impact of Brander's "Song of
the Rat" vanished along with the
singer's low notes. In contrast, Mr.
Baker's higher range was very
impressive. He was billed in the
program as a "bass-baritone;"
presumably the emphasis is on
the latter vocal quality, rather
than the former.
In sum, the Oakland Symphony
presented a very satisfying
performance of a difficult, but
rewarding work. The program will
be repeated Sunday, December 7,
8:30 PM, at Zellerback Hall at UC
Berkeley.
