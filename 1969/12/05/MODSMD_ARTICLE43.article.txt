# Eliassen, Bach Talks
## Profs Hit Pollution, Politics 
### 
Money and public demand can
bring victory in the fight against
pollution, Civil Engineering
Professor Rolf Eliassen told a
Monday meeting of the Palo Alto
Rotary Club.
He explained that "technology
knows the means of preventing
pollution, but the masses don't
know what we can do ... if we're
not given the money."
The community must be
impressed with the horrors
pollution can bring if nothing is
done about it, he said.
Land planning and pollution

control services will become easily
available if there is demand for
them. Most important is
preliminary demand for legislative
action on the sources of pollution,
and the finds needed for its
prevention.
"We've spent billions but that's
not enough," he claimed. He
named air pollution as the most
serious problem, with cars as the
biggest offenders in California.
People have little concern over
the quality of the 35 pounds of
air they breath each day. It's an
elusive threat as "it knows no

boundaries but changes as the
wind blows."
We are also diminishing our
wealth in water, Eliassen added.
"We can't afford to throw away
once-used water."
Attention to better methods of
sewage disposal is necessary to
keep up with the 3Vi billion tons
of waste which is generated
annually, he said.
The Rotary Club's "Review and
Renew" committee chose Eliassen
to speak to the group. Pollution is
one of the major current problems

which is under consideration as a
Club action project.
Old Politics Blasted
Old politics continue to hamper
the new economics, a nationally
prominent Stanford economist
believes.
Prof. G.L. Bach of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business says
significant changes are needed in
federal taxing and spending
processes for the new economics
to further improve the nation's
growth.
At present, he notes, "federal
spending decisions are dominated
by some 30 appropriations
subcommittees, many ruled by
chairmen who are virtually feudal
lords in their feifdoms."
Attempts to obtain a more
flexible tax policy have been
hamstruhg because they usually
are tied to reforms in the tax
structure itself, he notes.
While changes in fiscal policy
have tended to come late, changes
in federal monetary policy "have
often been too strong," he added.
He suggests that the Federal
Reserve Board should place more
emphasis on developing a stably
growing monetary base.
Given "the high probability of
continuing inflationary
pressures," Bach says, "we are
probably fortunate to have a Fed
somewhat independent from
day-to-day politics."
"The Fed, partially insulated
behind the silken veil that cloaks
money and the high temple of
finance, can stand against
inflation when neither the
President nor the Congress feels
politically able to do so."
Government policy makers
"may have a hard time keeping
the economy precisely on the
track of stable economic growth,"
because "it is still the private
sector—three-fourths of the
economy—that largely determines
whether we have prosperity or
recession."
In general, he said, "the
American public and political
process clearly puts first priority
on avoiding mass unemployment
and achieving general prosperity.
But not far behind comes the fear
of substantial inflation."
Bach discussed his views at a
recent American Bankers
Association symposium in
Washington, D.C.

believes.
Prof. G.L. Bach of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business says
significant changes are needed in
federal taxing and spending
processes for the new economics
to further improve the nation's
growth.
At present, he notes, "federal
spending decisions are dominated
by some 30 appropriations
subcommittees, many ruled by
chairmen who are virtually feudal
lords in their feifdoms."
Attempts to obtain a more
flexible tax policy have been
hamstruhg because they usually
are tied to reforms in the tax
structure itself, he notes.
While changes in fiscal policy
have tended to come late, changes
in federal monetary policy "have
often been too strong," he added.
He suggests that the Federal
Reserve Board should place more
emphasis on developing a stably
growing monetary base.
Given "the high probability of
continuing inflationary
pressures," Bach says, "we are
probably fortunate to have a Fed
somewhat independent from
day-to-day politics."
"The Fed, partially insulated
behind the silken veil that cloaks
money and the high temple of
finance, can stand against
inflation when neither the
President nor the Congress feels
politically able to do so."
Government policy makers
"may have a hard time keeping
the economy precisely on the
track of stable economic growth,"
because "it is still the private
sector—three-fourths of the
economy—that largely determines
whether we have prosperity or
recession."
In general, he said, "the
American public and political
process clearly puts first priority
on avoiding mass unemployment
and achieving general prosperity.
But not far behind comes the fear
of substantial inflation."
Bach discussed his views at a
recent American Bankers
Association symposium in
Washington, D.C.
Money and public demand can
bring victory in the fight against
pollution, Civil Engineering
Professor Rolf Eliassen told a
Monday meeting of the Palo Alto
Rotary Club.
He explained that "technology
knows the means of preventing
pollution, but the masses don't
know what we can do ... if we're
not given the money."
The community must be
impressed with the horrors
pollution can bring if nothing is
done about it, he said.
Land planning and pollution

control services will become easily
available if there is demand for
them. Most important is
preliminary demand for legislative
action on the sources of pollution,
and the finds needed for its
prevention.
"We've spent billions but that's
not enough," he claimed. He
named air pollution as the most
serious problem, with cars as the
biggest offenders in California.
People have little concern over
the quality of the 35 pounds of
air they breath each day. It's an
elusive threat as "it knows no

boundaries but changes as the
wind blows."
We are also diminishing our
wealth in water, Eliassen added.
"We can't afford to throw away
once-used water."
Attention to better methods of
sewage disposal is necessary to
keep up with the 3Vi billion tons
of waste which is generated
annually, he said.
The Rotary Club's "Review and
Renew" committee chose Eliassen
to speak to the group. Pollution is
one of the major current problems

which is under consideration as a
Club action project.
