# Ph.D Blues Bring Grads Trouble

Is the price of a doctorate disillusionment and
loneliness?
The Stanford catalog has no such reference
under the prerequisites, but nonetheless, according
to Dr. James Lyons of the Counseling and Testing
Center, such despondency is common throughout
the ranks of doctoral candidates out on the Farm.
To probe these feelings, the Center sponsored
an encounter group for doctoral students on the
rag, where they revealed their sentiments and
found some company in misery.
The participants in the encounter group had
responded to invitations published in the Daily.
The notices read in part "Weekly discussions for
faltering doctoral candidates." This was a
deliberate attempt to reach candidates who were
hung-up, faltering, and disenchanted.
"What was most impressive," commented Dr.
Lyon, "was the group's disillusionment and
hopelessness. Many were at a stalemate on their
dissertationsâ€”a plateau in which nothing was
happening. Several reported having even lost all
interest in their field of study."
While stressing that the group constituted a
biased sample, Dr. Lyon said he felt their feelings
were nevertheless typical of a sizeable minority of
doctoral students.
Problems lor Years
"We have been counseling graduate students for
many years at the center and knew many had
serious problems. I'm tempted to say however that
I never realized the depth of the problems
encountered by some of the doctoral candidates."
Reasons given for their disillusionment varied
widely, but many students mentioned insufficient
opportunity to work closely with one's adviser or
to share ideas with fellow students.

"The students came to Stanford expecting to
find a serious, fraternal community of scholars.
These conditions no longer exist at Stanford, nor I
would say at very many other universities.
Naturally the students were disappointed."
Few Receive Degrees
Many students complained of the
competitiveness of graduate work. Some stated
that other doctoral candidates refused to discuss
their dissertations with them. As a result, the
students felt lonely and alienated; that there was
no one with whom they could discuss the
problems they encountered in their work.
"These candidates are not unique to Stanford,"
Dr. Lyon pointed out, "but are especially striking
in view of the University's extremely low
undergradute attrition rate of at the most fifteen
percent over a four year period." In contrast, the
Study of Education at Stanford estimated that less
than a third of the studen undertaking doctoral
studies actually receive their degrees.
Future Uncertain
The idea for the encounter group was first
proposed last fall. At that time the Counseling
Center was very active in group programs and was
exploring other fields to which group therapy
might be applied.
Dr. Lyon reports that as a group experiment, it
is not clear whether this weekly program could be
called a success or not. Serious doubts were raised
as to whether weekly meetings could actually be
maintained. "We've had a turnover of at least two
thirds from one week to the next," he reported.
"There probably are many reasons why more of
the students don't return. Some may be
discouraged by the fact that so many others feel
equally disenchanted."
