# Transplant Patients Can Now Monitor Own Heart Rate
## 
### 
Stanford University Hospital
heart transplant patients can now
monitor their own hearts for signs
of rejection.
Each of the five patients, who
has been discharged from the
hospital to resume normal living,
wears a small portable tape
recorder for a period of 10 hours,
two days a month. Leading into
the recorder which hangs at the
patient's side from a neck strap,
are three electrode wires that are
taped to the patient's chest and
provide a continuous, 10-hour
electrocardiogram (EKG)
recording for evaluation by
Stanford physicians.
"With the data provided by the
EKG recording over a substantial
period of time, our ability to
stut the overall function of
transplanted hearts and to detect
heart arrhythmia, or an irregular
heart beat, is greatly increased,"
said Dr. David Clark, a
cardiologist on the Stanford heart
transplant team. "The presence of
arrhythmias may be an indicator
of chronic rejection."
Previously, the patients' heart
function was monitored only for a
brief period of several minutes
during their weekly or bi-weekly
visits to the Stanford University
Clinics.
"The chance of detecting an
arrhythmia during this time was
quite slim," Dr. Clark said. "Now
we can get continuous EKG
readings during periods of varying
physical activity and sleep and can
take steps if necessary to combat
the rejection process in its earliest
stages.

"To date our success in
diagnosis and treatment of
rejection has been very
encouraging. This additional tool
will further our capability to cope
with this problem."
Chronic rejection, Dr. Clark
explained, appears to take place
slowly over a long period of time.
It results in an accumulation of
tissue deposits on the walls of
arteries in the heart. If severe, this
accumulation can eventually cut

off the blood supply to the
conduction center, or natural
pacemaker, of the heart.
"The heart's own pacemaker is
a small mass of specialized cells in
the upper right chamber of the
heart which initiates the electrical
impulses that cause the heart to
contract," Dr. Clark said. "When
the blood supply to this area is
insufficient because of gradual
blockage of the artery, the heart
may beat irregularly."
