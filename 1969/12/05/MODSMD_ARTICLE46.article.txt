# 10 Latin Americans Join Grad Program
## 
### 
Post-graduate courses at
Stanford for outstanding young
Latin American educators and
administrators has begun this fall
under a new Ford
Foundation-supported program.
The $318,000 grant brought
the first 10 men to the campus in
October under the auspices of
SlDEC—Stanford International
Education Center —a branch of the
School of Education.
The 10 will be candidates for
master's degrees in developmental
education, said Prof. Arthur
Coladarci, director of SIDEC and
associate dean of the School of
Education.
Working with Prof. Coladarci
on the project will be members of
the SIDEC staff, including Profs.
Frank Moore, Martin Carnoy,

Robert Textor, Hans Weiler, and
William Rideout.
Some of them will make an
annual recruiting trip to the area
to interview candidates nominated
by their own institutions.
The initial grant will support
the five-year plan for its first three
years, Prof. Coladarci said.
The Caribbean fellows, as they
will be called, will be trained in
interdisciplinary courses which
they then can take back to the
home countries to enhance their
own educational development.
In subsequent years, "alumni"
of the special SIDEC course will
meet with the faculty recruiters
on their annual trips to discuss
mutual problems and plan further
research indicated by local needs.
