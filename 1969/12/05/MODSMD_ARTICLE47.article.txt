# Sen Petris Asks Battle Against Smog
## 
### 
State Senator Nicholas Petris,
has revealed comprehensive plans
to attack the air pollution
problem on a number of fronts in
the next legislative session.
In a frank and enthusiastic
discussion with Stanford students
Wednesday night, Petris discussed
both the disturbing and the
optimistic aspects of the air
pollution fight and the present
advances in technology related to
it.
A leader in the environmental
quality issue and three-time
sponsor of bills to ban the internal
combustion engine from
California since his election to the
Assembly 11 years ago, Petris
attributed much of the pollution
problem to the selfish interests
and "tunnel vision" of
automakers and city planners who
refuse to consider the ecological
consequences of their decisions.
He told the students he is now
organizing, with the help of
consumer crusader Ralph Nader, a
"national stamp-out-smog day"
designed to pressure automobile
manufacturers into developing
pollution-free vehicles. On S-O-S
day, legislators around the
country will simultaneously
introduce bills banning the sale of
the internal combustion engine in
their states.
Tougher Standards
Senator Petris will be
reintroducing his bill from the last
session with one change—the new
bill will establish tougher
pollution standards which
automobiles must meet by 1975.
Only if these standards are not
met will the sale of the internal
combustion engine be banned.
The standards, however, are the
most stringent ever proposed
anywhere, and most experts
doubt that the internal
combustion engine could ever
meet them.
(His bill in the last legislative
session—an outright ban on the
sale of the internal combustion
engine—was approved by the
Senate by a 26-5 vote, but
defeated in the Assembly
Transportation Committee by one
vote after intensive lobbying
efforts by the oil and auto
industries).
Petris revealed that a
conversion device has been
developed by the Pacific Lighting
Company of Los Angeles which

would enable the regular internal
combustion engine to run on
natural gas with extremely low
pollutant characteristics.
Supplementary Bill
He is thinking of introducing a
supplementary bill which would
require everyone to convert their
old cars to run on natural gas after
January 1, 1975, when, if his
major bill is passed, the new
requirements would go into
effect.
Petris noted that the conversion
to natural gas would eventually
save the consumers money, as well
as aiding their health. While the
initial cost of the conversion
device would be $200 to 300, the
consumer would make this up in
the first year of operation through
savings in the price of gas.
However, this device will still
allow some level of automobile
pollution, as would another
much-discussed alternative, the
gas turbine engine (an engine
which, Petris said, Chrysler has
had for eighteen years, but won't
put on the market for fear of
unfavorable public reaction).
Senator Petris isn't satisfied
with even a small amount of
automobile pollution. His goal is
zero. He plans to introduce a bill
which will exempt smog-free cars
from all taxes. A new car which
emitted no pollutants would not
be charged with a sales tax, a
registration tax, or a licensing tax,
all of which are now mandatory.
The absence of these taxes would
make the smog free car
competitive with present types of
cars, which are bigger and more
powerful than most smog-free
alternatives.
Amendment On l ap
Another bill high on his list of
priorities is a Constitutional
amendment which would allow
the state to use revenues from the
gasoline tax for air pollution
control research and the
development of other forms of
transportation "from bicycle
paths to monorails."
Pollution research would
include the development of a new
propulsion system (electricity or
steam, for instance) and even new
fuels. Petris told the group that
one such fuel being developed is
methanol, an alchohol which can
be made from grain and produces
82% less pollution than gasoline.
The gas tax revenues would also

be used to improve and expand
rapid transit systems, if the
amendment is passed. At present
the gas tax revenue is used for
highway improvements and
construction.
Petris plans to introduce
legislation to require local Air
Pollution Control Districts to
make public their data on what
industries are putting into the air,
and how much.This information is
considered a "trade secret" by
industry, and the control districts
will therefore not publish the
"pollution quotients" of specific
industries.
"Identify Polluters"
The senator from Oakland
argued, "Polluters should be
identified and their contribution
to the pollution problem should
be made known to the public at
large. It is the public at large who
must suffer the effects of the
pollution in the air they breathe."
Petris warned the students

against developing the kind of
"tunnel vision" that he feels has
led to resistance from automakers.
Even though concerned citizens
are hammering away at the air
pollution problem, Petris said,
they shouldn't lose sight of the
total problem created by the
automobile.
"We should consider banning
cars entirely from urban areas. If
the congestion isn't improved, we
will soon have another major
public health problem to deal
with—an epidemic of nervous
breakdowns."
Again he sounded the theme of
tunnel vision, industry's inability
to see beyond its own immediate
interests. "However," he noted,
"it is in the auto industry's
interest to develop a new engine
before General Electric is selling
all the cars, just as it is in the oil
industry's interest to develop an
oil-based smog-free fuel before
they start finding engines that can
run on soda pop."
