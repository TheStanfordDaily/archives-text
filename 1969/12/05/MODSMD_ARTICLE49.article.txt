# H & S Discusses Budget Cuts
## 
### 
University budget cuts were the
major concern of the Humanities
and Sciences Assembly Monday
night.
Professor Bernard Cohen
introduced a motion calling lor a
moratorium on academic funds
reductions. The motion was
tabled when Provost Richard
Lyman assured the group that
faculty members would be
involved in guiding Stanford's 2.5
million belt-tightening program.
Lyman said he expected a
seven-man committee to be
named this week to start studying
where budget base cuts should be
made for 1 970-71.
Three professors from the
School of Humanities and
Sciences will be among the live
faculty on the group. Two
students will be chosen by the
Associated Students.
Both faculty and students will
be chosen by their own groups,
not selected by the Business
Office. Lyman emphasized, "We
don't want a watch dog
committee that is missing some of
its teeth."
"The facu 1 ty-student
committee will work on the
1970-71 budget, and its impact
will be even greater in subsequent
years as it becomes thoroughly
familiar with the financial aspects
of all University activities."

The belt-tightening program is
designed to bring current income
and expenditures of the
University into balance over a
four-year period. Nearly $1
million is expected to be trimmed
next year.
Lyman asserted that there is no
painless way to reduce
expenditures. One favorite dream
of faculty members, he suggested,
is that the University's Business
Office "has all sorts of fat in it.
"On the contrary, it has
suffered such budgetary pressure
already that its wage rates are
inadequate, turnover is too high,
and quality of service is
suffering."
In a university, he added,
"there is no single measure that
will give us a foolproof reading on
budgetary justice."
In the past three years the
University libraries and the School
of Humanities and Sciences have
together received nearly three
times the amount on new general
funds that have gone into
business, engineering, law,
education, and earth sciences
combined.
In answer to questions, Lyman
said the decline in federal research
volume is the principal factor now
imposing budget restraint on
Stanford.


AVOIDING SUDDEN DEATH—Mechanical walking machines built by students
in Mechanical Engineering 107 had to brave the danger of falling into the water
tank below the plank. The "walking machines" were limited to a maximum of
eight inches in length. The twenty-five students were told they would be graded
on their machines ability to walk the plank "with style" if at all.

and expenditures of the
University into balance over a
four-year period. Nearly $1
million is expected to be trimmed
next year.
Lyman asserted that there is no
painless way to reduce
expenditures. One favorite dream
of faculty members, he suggested,
is that the University's Business
Office "has all sorts of fat in it.
"On the contrary, it has
suffered such budgetary pressure
already that its wage rates are
inadequate, turnover is too high,
and quality of service is
suffering."
In a university, he added,
"there is no single measure that
will give us a foolproof reading on
budgetary justice."
In the past three years the
University libraries and the School
of Humanities and Sciences have
together received nearly three
times the amount on new general
funds that have gone into
business, engineering, law,
education, and earth sciences
combined.
In answer to questions, Lyman
said the decline in federal research
volume is the principal factor now
imposing budget restraint on
Stanford.


AVOIDING SUDDEN DEATH—Mechanical walking machines built by students
in Mechanical Engineering 107 had to brave the danger of falling into the water
tank below the plank. The "walking machines" were limited to a maximum of
eight inches in length. The twenty-five students were told they would be graded
on their machines ability to walk the plank "with style" if at all.
University budget cuts were the
major concern of the Humanities
and Sciences Assembly Monday
night.
Professor Bernard Cohen
introduced a motion calling lor a
moratorium on academic funds
reductions. The motion was
tabled when Provost Richard
Lyman assured the group that
faculty members would be
involved in guiding Stanford's 2.5
million belt-tightening program.
Lyman said he expected a
seven-man committee to be
named this week to start studying
where budget base cuts should be
made for 1 970-71.
Three professors from the
School of Humanities and
Sciences will be among the live
faculty on the group. Two
students will be chosen by the
Associated Students.
Both faculty and students will
be chosen by their own groups,
not selected by the Business
Office. Lyman emphasized, "We
don't want a watch dog
committee that is missing some of
its teeth."
"The facu 1 ty-student
committee will work on the
1970-71 budget, and its impact
will be even greater in subsequent
years as it becomes thoroughly
familiar with the financial aspects
of all University activities."

The belt-tightening program is
designed to bring current income
and expenditures of the
University into balance over a
four-year period. Nearly $1
million is expected to be trimmed
next year.
