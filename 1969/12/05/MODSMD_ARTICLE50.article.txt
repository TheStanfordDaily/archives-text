# Detects Antibodies
## Kidney Treatment 
### 
A new test that spells hope for
a greater number of successful
kidney transplants has been
developed by scientists here at
Stanford, reported Dr. Zoltan
Lucas in a transplant symposium
held Wednesday.
"By using this test, which
determines whether the potential
kidney transplant recipient has
developed antibodies in his blood
that will fight a newly
transplanted kidney, we are now
able to know which patients have
the best chance of having a
successful transplant," said Dr.
Lucas, assistant professor of
surgery at Stanford Med School.
"Correlation of data from
the new test, has shown that the
possibility of a patient acquiring
these anti-bodies is directly
related to the length of time that
the patient has been maintained
on an artificial kidney machine
(hemodialysis)," emphasized Dr.
Lucas.
Rather than waiting for the
"perfect match" of a kidney
whose tissue is similar to his own,
as would be found in a brother or
sister of the patient, he is better
off with a quick transplant
regardless of tissue match, so that
his system doesn't have the time
to build up the anti-bodies that
cause rejection.
Dr. Lucas explained that the
normal kidney not only filters
poisonous wastes from the body

in the form of urine, but that the
kidney manufacturers certain
hormones necessary to the
individual's well-being.
Though the kidney machine
does an efficient job of cleansing
the patient's blood, periodic
blood transfusions are needed to
maintain the hormone level. Every
transfusion however, introduces
antibodies harmful to foreign
organs.
According to Dr. Lucas, "If a

patient has developed these
antibodies, it is better that he not
have a transplant, but remain on
dialysis from then on."
"While the closeness of the
tissue match between donor and
recipient is important and
preferable when possible, our
studies have shown that this
importance diminishes after the
patient has been maintained by
the artificial kidney for longer
than three to six months."
