# Consultants Blast Foothills Project
## 
### 
The Palo Alto foothills may
have been saved the ravages of
grading and terracing for yet
another housing project due to a
recently released report by a team
of planning consultants hired by
the city.
The sharply worded report,
issued last Friday by the
consulting team of Livingston and
Blaney, criticized the plans for
$80 million worth of homes and
apartments, to be built by the
Land Resources Corporation.
The Land Resources proposal
came under attack for its
extensive grading operations, the
planned architectural design of
the homes, unstable soil
conditions, landscaping features,
and its traffic circulation plan.
The consultants noted that
grading of 95 percent of the ridges
would be required in order to
construct the 245 single family
homes, 340 "patio homes," 453
townhouses, 738 apartments, plus
the commercial and office center
called for in the present plan.
Priced Too High
The vast project, largest in Palo
Alto's history, will do little to
alleviate the city's housing
shortage, the consultants said,
because the family houses,

townhouses, and patio homes are
being priced too high for the
market.
The design of the buildings
composing the project drew
particular criticism in the report.
The architectural plans "are
difficult to take seriously,"
commented Livingston and
Blaney. "If an attempt was made
to relate building design with the
character of the site, it failed."
The proposed homes represent
"an array of building styles
ranging from bastard Elizabethan
and Georgian to Orange County
Ranch."
Oppressive Apartments
"The most oppressive part of
the development will be the 600
apartments planned for the
hillside north of Arastradero
Road. An effort has been made to
introduce variety by stepping
them up the slope, but there will
be enough large, barracks type
buildings to make a project-look
unavoidable," the report said.
The report warned against
"widespread unstable soil
conditions," and cautioned that
earthquake faults should be
pinpointed before any large
schools are built in the area.
