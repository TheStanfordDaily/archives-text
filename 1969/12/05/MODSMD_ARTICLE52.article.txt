# Womens' Liberation Plans For 1970
## 
### 
The liberated women of
Stanford University met
Wednesday night to discuss their
plans for the coming year. Among
those assembled were housewives,
a red dress fringed serape and
orange tights, and a crusader in
blue jeans and boots. A lone male
sat on the edge of the circle and
observed the proceedings dociley.
First on the agenda was
discussion of the planned use of
the Stanford Elementary School
building after it is vacated this
June.
Second was the discussion of
the planned GE strike. This
discussion was mainly between
the members of the Stanford SDS

present. It was decided that the
Women's Liberation generally
supported the strike against the
"imperialist policies of GE." One
member suggested that members
try to get interviews with the GE
recruiter to tie up his time.
Another member related her
experience with the Marine
Recruiter when she asked him if
she could "Learn to Command
Men."
Means of raising funds were
discussed. A Bake Sale was
suggested, but vetoed on the
grounds that it would be out of
context with the demands of the
movement. A film will be shown
early in the next quarter to raise
funds for the group.
