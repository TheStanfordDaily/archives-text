# In Anthro, Music
## New Courses Offered 
### 
Three unusual classes will be
offered winter quarter, one in the
anthropology department, and
two in music.
The new experimental course,
"Peoples of Thailand," will be
taught by Robert B. Textor,
Professor of Education and
Anthropology. He explains that
its aim is to "help meet students'
demands for 'relevance' without
sacrificing academic rigor."
Although some attention will
be given to all peoples of "Thai"
ethno-linguistic affiliation, found
in many Asian countries, the main
focus of the course will be on the
Siamese of central Thailand and
the Northeasterners of Khorat
Plateau.
Multi-Disciplinary Teams
The four-unit course, open to
upperclassmen and graduate
students, will meet three times a
week for lectures and discussion.
For several weeks the course will
also include a Tuesday evening
session during which students in
small multi-disciplinary teams will
"take the role of ethnographer"
and interview Thais on selected
problems.
Thai people now living and
working in the Bay Area will be
selected to participate; they will
play a variety of real and

simulated roles in selected
ethnographic situations.
Students interested in policy
problems may, for one additional
unit, participate in more
specialized discussions of policy
problems concerning political,
economic, and educational
"development." As members of
small voluntary teams, the
participating students will draft
position papers on selected issues
of policy.
Discussion and evaluation of
these papers will be confined to
the workshop sessions and will be
supplemented by the chosen
readings, class lectures, and
interviewing. Typical policy
questions might be: "What is the
impact of the American presence
in Thailand on the development
of participatory political
institutions?" or "Are foreign
private economic investments
likely to be hurt by economic
nationalism?" or "What should
UNESCO's policy be in advising
the Thai government on
upcountry elementary school
curriculum?"

The Music Department will
offer two three-unit courses
winter quarter which are not

meet from 4:15 to 6:05 on
Mondays. Thirty students will be

meet from 4:15 to 6:05 on
Mondays. Thirty students will be
chos>en to participate.
Prerequisites include ability as a
performer and a knowledge of
elementary music theory
equivalent to Music 21.
Mr. Handy, who plays piano,
saxophone, and other wind
instruments, has performed for
many years with his own band,
and other name groups; he has
toured the United States and
Europe extensively. Handy is
currently a member of the faculty
at San Francisco State College.
Three unusual classes will be
offered winter quarter, one in the
anthropology department, and
two in music.
The new experimental course,
"Peoples of Thailand," will be
taught by Robert B. Textor,
Professor of Education and
Anthropology. He explains that
its aim is to "help meet students'
demands for 'relevance' without
sacrificing academic rigor."
Although some attention will
be given to all peoples of "Thai"
ethno-linguistic affiliation, found
in many Asian countries, the main
focus of the course will be on the
Siamese of central Thailand and
the Northeasterners of Khorat
Plateau.
Multi-Disciplinary Teams
The four-unit course, open to
upperclassmen and graduate
students, will meet three times a
week for lectures and discussion.
For several weeks the course will
also include a Tuesday evening
session during which students in
small multi-disciplinary teams will
"take the role of ethnographer"
and interview Thais on selected
problems.
Thai people now living and
working in the Bay Area will be
selected to participate; they will
play a variety of real and

simulated roles in selected
ethnographic situations.
Students interested in policy
problems may, for one additional
unit, participate in more
specialized discussions of policy
problems concerning political,
economic, and educational
"development." As members of
small voluntary teams, the
participating students will draft
position papers on selected issues
of policy.
Discussion and evaluation of
these papers will be confined to
the workshop sessions and will be
supplemented by the chosen
readings, class lectures, and
interviewing. Typical policy
questions might be: "What is the
impact of the American presence
in Thailand on the development
of participatory political
institutions?" or "Are foreign
private economic investments
likely to be hurt by economic
nationalism?" or "What should
UNESCO's policy be in advising
the Thai government on
upcountry elementary school
curriculum?"
Music Courses
The Music Department will
offer two three-unit courses
winter quarter which are not
listed in the Time Schedule. Both

will be taught by noted jazz
musician John Handy.
"Afro-American Music" is to be
held from 1:15 to 3:05 on
Mondays. The class will begin

Afro-American music from 1619
to the present. Emphasis will be
on getting to know the music
through he use of recordings,
practical demonstrations and live
performance when possible. There
is no prerequisite.
Auditions will be held at the
first class meeting of Music 160,
''Techniques in Jazz
Improvisation." The course will
meet from 4:15 to 6:05 on
Mondays. Thirty students will be
chos>en to participate.
