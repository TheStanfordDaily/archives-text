# Indians Play 'Bronco Buster' Role Tonight
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Coming off an impressive 84-72
victory over San Jose State, the
StanfoVd basketball team hosts
nationally ranked Santa Clara at
8:00 p.m. tonight in Maples
Pavilion. The llth-ranked
Broncos, who had a 27-2 record
last year, opened their season
Monday night with an easy 81-55
victory over San Francisco State.
The Broncos are led by 6-10
center Dennis Awtrey and 6-5
forward Ralph Ogden. On
Monday night, Ogden led all
scorers with 21 points and Awtrey
added nineteen. Awtrey is a
strong aggressive player who fits
in perfectly with the rough and

tumble style of play of the
Broncos. Ogden is a fine shooter
and good rebounder despite his
size.
The Broncos have two fine
defensive guards in Terry O'Brien
(6-2) and Kevin Eagleson (5-10).
Rounding out an otherwise
veteran starting five will be 6-4
sophomore forward Bruce Bochte.
Overall, Santa Clara is a strong
board team with a good defense.
They will undoubtedly give the
Indians their stiffest challenge of
the young season.
Stanford will have to maintain
the fine shooting they have shown
in their first two games to stay
with the Broncos. The Indian

guards, Claude Terry and Dennis
O'Neill, are consistently fine
outside shooters, and forward
Fred Green also showed a fine
touch while picking up fifteen
points against San Jose State.

Bill Barber and Bill Palmer will
probably round out the starting
five against Santa Clara. 6-4
Forward Chuck Moore and 6-10
center Larry Rosenzweig, who
have both been impressive in
substitute roles, will probably also
see considerable action.
Rosenzweig picked up nineteen
points against Utah and eight
rebounds against SJS, while
sharing the center position with
Palmer. Moore hit on four of six
field goals Wednesday night and
he showed flashes of the excellent
shooting he displayed two years
ago.
The Indians surprised a lot of
people with their quickness and
shooting in the first two games,
and if they can keep it up they
will give Santa Clara a real battle.
As Santa Clara coach Dick
Garibaldi said after the SJS game,
"I'm glad we didn't have to play
them tonight. I look for Stanford
to give us one of our tough games
of the season."

shooting in the first two games,
and if they can keep it up they
will give Santa Clara a real battle.
As Santa Clara coach Dick
Garibaldi said after the SJS game,
"I'm glad we didn't have to play
them tonight. I look for Stanford
to give us one of our tough games
of the season."

LIP AND AWAY—Stanford's Chuck Moore (33) drives over three Spartans
Wednesday night in the Indians 84-72 win over San Jose State. The competition
will he rougher in tonight's 8 p.m. encounter with Santa Clara.
Coming off an impressive 84-72
victory over San Jose State, the
StanfoVd basketball team hosts
nationally ranked Santa Clara at
8:00 p.m. tonight in Maples
Pavilion. The llth-ranked
Broncos, who had a 27-2 record
last year, opened their season
Monday night with an easy 81-55
victory over San Francisco State.
The Broncos are led by 6-10
center Dennis Awtrey and 6-5
forward Ralph Ogden. On
Monday night, Ogden led all
scorers with 21 points and Awtrey
added nineteen. Awtrey is a
strong aggressive player who fits
in perfectly with the rough and

tumble style of play of the
Broncos. Ogden is a fine shooter
and good rebounder despite his
size.
The Broncos have two fine
defensive guards in Terry O'Brien
(6-2) and Kevin Eagleson (5-10).
Rounding out an otherwise
veteran starting five will be 6-4
sophomore forward Bruce Bochte.
Overall, Santa Clara is a strong
board team with a good defense.
They will undoubtedly give the
Indians their stiffest challenge of
the young season.
Stanford will have to maintain
the fine shooting they have shown
in their first two games to stay
with the Broncos. The Indian

guards, Claude Terry and Dennis
O'Neill, are consistently fine
outside shooters, and forward
Fred Green also showed a fine
touch while picking up fifteen
points against San Jose State.

Bill Barber and Bill Palmer will
probably round out the starting
five against Santa Clara. 6-4
Forward Chuck Moore and 6-10
center Larry Rosenzweig, who
have both been impressive in
substitute roles, will probably also
see considerable action.
Rosenzweig picked up nineteen
points against Utah and eight
rebounds against SJS, while
sharing the center position with
Palmer. Moore hit on four of six
field goals Wednesday night and
he showed flashes of the excellent
shooting he displayed two years
ago.
The Indians surprised a lot of
people with their quickness and
shooting in the first two games,
and if they can keep it up they
will give Santa Clara a real battle.
