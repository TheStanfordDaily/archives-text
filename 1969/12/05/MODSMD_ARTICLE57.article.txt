# The 						Rating Game
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
Quick, sports fans, what college basketball team
has the 11th toughest schedule in the country?
UCLA? South Carolina? Kentucky? Union Pacific?
Nope, it's Stanford.
At least that's what Gordon L. Wise, a
marketing prof at Wright State University in
Dayton, Ohio, says. Wise has just released the fifth
annual edition of his "Schedule Power
Ratings"—an exhaustive mathematical analysis of
the difficulty of basketball schedules to be played
by 211 college teams this season.
It's a mind-boggier.
As he did earlier this year with collegiate
football, Wise has sought to determine precisely
which teams play the toughest schedules and
which have, as he puts it, "pushover" opponents.
To do this he employs a relatively simple formula
which is based on a composite of all the pre-season
rankings by so-called "experts."
Power Points
Here's how it works: A group of 46 "rated"
teams, based on the composite of all pre-season
ratings and rankings, is gathered and each team is
given a "power point" value based on the
frequency and height of those ratings. Then, using
the ratings of these 46 teams, a ranking of
conferences, leagues and independent areas of the
country is made. This technique extends a "power
point" value to non-"rated" teams in various
leagues. In all, over 300 teams receive "power
point" values.
Next step is a close examination of the
schedules of the 21 1 selected college teams. Each
team's schedule is awarded the "power point"
value of each of its opponents, the values are
added and the total is divided by the number of
games on the team's slate. The result is an "average
power point" value for each team's schedule.
Many teams, of course, play in mid-season
tournaments, but Wise takes this factor into
account by determining the mathematical
probability of a particular team encountering each
of the other teams in a tourney and then assigning
the appropriate number of "power points" to that
team's schedule.
Basketball's traditional "home court advantage"
is noted, too, as additional "power points" are
awarded for each game played on opposition
territory.
Ranking Mailed
Wise then puts away his abacus and pencils and
sends out his own national ranking of the nation's
top teams —based solely on schedule strength. The
results are interesting.
South Carolina, the team generally
acknowledged to be the best in the country in
pre-season polls, has only the 19th toughest
schedule. Another supposed contender for
national honors, Purdue, has the 99th toughest
slate. Wise rates UCLA's schedule as only the 70th
strongest nationally, and New Mexico State,
picked for second by Sports Illustrated, ties with
Santa Clara for the 135 th most difficult schedule.
What teams, then, do have tough schedules?
Well, according to Wise, the nation's most
demanding schedule is about to be faced by
Michigan—a team which has six games with teams
ranked in the top 15. Close behind the Wolverines
is Notre Dame whose slate includes eight games

against teams in the top 20 plus the possibility of
meeting numer-one rated South Carolina in the
Sugar Bowl tournament. Wake Forest, a member
of the nation's toughest conference, according to
Wise, has the third toughest slate mainly because
of games against Atlantic Coast Conference foes
like South Carolina and North Carolina, not to
mention three games with Duke.
And what about the Indians? Wise doesn't go
into particulars, but the guess here is that
Stanford's 11th ranked schedule is the result of
two games against UCLA, USC, and Oregon State
(all in Wise's top 46 teams) plus single contests
with Santa Clara, St. John's, Utah, Cincinnati, and
San Jose State. Stanford is also listed as facing the
toughest schedule of any Pac-8 team.
In all, only five teams rank in the top 25 in both
Wise's book and according to the pre-season
composite. They are South Carolina, Notre Dame,
Duke, North Carolina and USC.
The entire concept of ranking schedules has
some important drawbacks, however. For one, the
whole scheme is based on the educated but clearly
speculative guesses of coaches and writers about
the quality of various teams in pre-season polls.
Since, with rare exceptions, most of the people
who vote in these polls have never seen the great
majority of the nation's teams play, there is a
certain inherent risk-factor contained in a ranking
theory based solely on their opinions. Wise's
ratings can be as good as but no better than his
composite of pre-season polls.
Secondly, his system by definition hurts highly
ranked teams, especially if those teams are the
only standouts in weak conferences. For instance,
last season UCLA was an overwhelming choice to
walk all over its Pac-8 foes. Thus, all teams in the
league gained valuable points for having the Bruins
on their schedule for two games. Yet UCLA,
unable to play itself, couldn't collect on those
"power points."
This phenomenon contributes directly to the
high ranking (third) of Wake Forest in the "power
point" poll. Although the Deacons finished with a
highly respectable 19-9 record last season, Wise s
ranking composite puts them in the 40th spot
nationally. But their schedule is loaded with
biggies while their league opponents don't gain
reciprocally from playing them.
In football, by the way, Wise's preseason
"power point" rankings put Stanford in the no. 36
spot this year. As things turned out, the Indians'
opponents finished with a 51-42-3 record, which
was better than all but one of the teams currently
ranked in the top ten—USC. The number one team
as far as schedule strength was concerned was
Mississippi State, whose opponents ran up a
combined 59-29-2 mark. Six of those opponents
are going to bowls while State ended the season
with three wins and seven losses.
What all this proves, of course, is debatable. The
evidence leads one to the conclusion that
evaluating teams on the strength of their schedules
can be unfair, but it is nonetheless true that the
"power point" system does show up usually
unnoticed strengths and weaknesses in the
schedules of some teams which can be helpful in
the final evaluation of those teams' true strengths.
In any case, it's good for an argument or two.
