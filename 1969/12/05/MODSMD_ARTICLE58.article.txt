# Phenoms Meet
## Baseball Underway 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
Stanford's 1970 baseball season
began yesterday.
In a series of group meetings
varsity coach Ray Young held

discussions with over sixty
candidates for spots on the two
teams Stanford will field this
spring: the varsity and a
freshman-sophomore Brave squad.
For the first time in nearly two
decades, freshmen will be eligible
for the varsity.
Full scale practice sessions
begin Jan. 5, less than a month
prior to the Feb. 3 openers for
both teams. On that date the
varsity will play a Philadelphia
Philly rookie team and the Braves
take on Gavilan Junior College.
Stanford, says Young, will
begin play this season with a
young and inexperienced squad.
The loss of eight key players, five
of whom signed pro contracts, has
left the Indians with some
important holes to fill.
Fortunately, however, three
pitchers who looked impressive
last year, are back.
Phil Keller, a right hander who
was named All-league and
All-District-8 last season while
winning eight and losing three
overall, will anchor a staff which
will also include right hander
Steve Dunning and southpaw Jim
Coate. In addition, Bob Marshall
and Bruce Schoen will do relief
and spot work, and there are
several promising freshmen and
sophomore pitchers.
In the infield, the only familiar
face will belong to Dick Borchers,
but he's likely to be shifted from
his second base spot. Mike Ewing
and Hank Snider, neither of
whom were regulars last season,
are holdovers in the outfield. At
the catching spot Don
Schellenberg, who broke his finger

in his second game last year, is the
prime candidate.
In all, the team looks good
defensively, and Young feels that
the pitching will have to "carry us
through the first few games until
we develop as a team." The coach,
of course, is optimistic; he sees
"outstanding potential."
But at this stage, who doesn't?
This fall 28 freshmen and 38
other players worked out several
times a week. After four weeks of
instruction the group placed three
weeks of intrasquad games. The
result was that at least four or five
freshmen are now varsity
candidates. They, the eight
returning lettermen, and others
who played on various levels last
season, will begin practice for the
19 spots on the varsity's travelling
squad right after vacation.

prior to the Feb. 3 openers for
both teams. On that date the
varsity will play a Philadelphia
Philly rookie team and the Braves
take on Gavilan Junior College.
Stanford, says Young, will
begin play this season with a
young and inexperienced squad.
The loss of eight key players, five
of whom signed pro contracts, has
left the Indians with some
important holes to fill.
Fortunately, however, three
pitchers who looked impressive
last year, are back.
Phil Keller, a right hander who
was named All-league and
All-District-8 last season while
winning eight and losing three
overall, will anchor a staff which
will also include right hander
Steve Dunning and southpaw Jim
Coate. In addition, Bob Marshall
and Bruce Schoen will do relief
and spot work, and there are
several promising freshmen and
sophomore pitchers.
In the infield, the only familiar
face will belong to Dick Borchers,
but he's likely to be shifted from
his second base spot. Mike Ewing
and Hank Snider, neither of
whom were regulars last season,
are holdovers in the outfield. At
the catching spot Don
Schellenberg, who broke his finger

in his second game last year, is the
prime candidate.
In all, the team looks good
defensively, and Young feels that
the pitching will have to "carry us
through the first few games until
we develop as a team." The coach,
of course, is optimistic; he sees
"outstanding potential."
But at this stage, who doesn't?
This fall 28 freshmen and 38
other players worked out several
times a week. After four weeks of
instruction the group placed three
weeks of intrasquad games. The
result was that at least four or five
freshmen are now varsity
candidates. They, the eight
returning lettermen, and others
who played on various levels last
season, will begin practice for the
19 spots on the varsity's travelling
squad right after vacation.
