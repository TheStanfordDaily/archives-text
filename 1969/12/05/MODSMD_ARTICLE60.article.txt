# Parish Named To All-America Teams

Recognition is finally coming.
After an entire season of being
shafted by national pollsters and
so-called experts, Stanford
football standouts are now being
honored in All-America selections.
The Sporting News and The
Associated Press have both
released their choices, and senior
linebacker Don Parish has stolen
the show for the Indians.
The quick, strong team captain
from Paso Robles was tabbed as a
first team Ail-American by pro
scouts in The Sporting News list,
and also by the highly respected
AP selectors.
And Parish was not the only
star honored. Junior quarterback
Him Plunkett was named to the
second AP team, junior tight end

Bob Moore made the AP third
team, and Bob Reinhard, John
Sande, and Rich Keller gained
honorable mention.
Reinhard, an offensive guard,
and Keller, a defensive back, are
seniors. Center Sande is a junior.
Last year, offensive lineman
Malcolm Snider was selected to
the first Sporting News team, and
end Gene Washington was placed
or the third unit. Both are now
highly successful rookies for
Atlanta and San Francisco in the
National Football League.
Before that however, Stanford
has been without a true
Ail-American for over a decade.
Parish may not have seen the end
of all the post-season honors yet.
He is a prime candidate for the
Pop Warner Award, given every
year to the outstanding senior
football player on the West Coast,
and the Voit Award which goes to
the best senior athlete on the
coast.
Parish was the quiet team
leader this season, and is certain
to go early in the pro football
draft next year. He was previously
named to the UPI All-America
second team, ana was generally
recognized by opposing coaches
(except UCLA's Tommy Prothro)
as the top linebacker in the West.
Prothro complained after the
UCLA-Stanford tie that the
defensive statistics were fixed,
crediting Parish with more tackles
than he deserved. (UCLA's star
linebacker Mike Ballou was not
selected in either of the recently
announced teams).
No other coaches could find
fault with Parish. "He's one of the
greatest I've ever seen at his
position," said John McKay of
use.
