# Ambassador Interrupted
## Arabs Heckle Israeli 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Israeli Ambassador Yitzhak
Rabin found more than a listening
audience yesterday at the
Tresidder Large Lounge. A
chanting, shouting group of
picketers attempted to disrupt his
address.
More than 30 demonstrators,
many of them Arabs, rattled
windows and hurled epithets at
the ambassador from outside the
Lounge. At one point doors had
to be locked to prevent the
protestors from entering.
Many of the demonstrators had
participated in the protest at the
Stanford Placement Center earlier.
Following the melee in the Union
they joined the Israel protest
upstairs.
The start of the ambassador's
talk was delayed about 15
minutes while a false fire alarm
sounded and doors were closed.
Six Santa Clara County Sheriff's
deputies came to the lounge
toward the end of his talk to
guard against any possible trouble.
Protect Safety
The poli'-e had been called by
plainclothesmen who were already
present to protect the safety of
Rabin. University officials
emphasized they had nothing to
do with calling the police on
campus.
The ambassador showed signs
of annoyance only when students
who wanted to hear him had to be
admitted through the rear door
onto the balcony. Later during
the speech demonstrators
marched around the balcony
peering in. Occasionally they
banged on the deck with sticks
and beat doors and windows in
time with the chanting.
Inside, Rabin said that the
Arabs urgently need peace. "The
real war," he said, "is against
hunger, poverty, disease, and
ignorance."
Want Peace
He repeated over and over that
the Israeli's want peace and that

they are ready to meet with Arab
leaders anytime for discussions
leading toward a peaceful solution
in the Middle East.
But he emphasized that even
without Arab cooperation "Israel
can live for 50 or 100 years." He
said, "We aren't ready for
halfbaked solutions which will
lead to another war, but we want
real peace and security."
Rabin was especially critical of
the USSR.
"The Soviet Union has decided
to exploit the conflict to gain
support in the Arab countries," he
said.
Con trol!* i nsion
"The Russians maintain
constant controlled tension—no
war and no peace. If there is peace
it will mark the end of the
Russian dream of dominance in
the Mediterranean. Peace means
redevelopment and the Russians
will offer little," he claimed, "not

because of moral conviction, but
because Israel will defeat the
Arabs and end the Russian
influence."
Toward the end of his talk,
about a dozen Arab students
came in the rear door. They
waited until the questioning
period to bring up the subject of
the ousted Palestinian Arabs.
Rabin embarked upon an
involved answer and was
interrupted often throughout.
At this point six deputies came
in to keep order. Those outside
shouted "pigs off campus."
During the question and answer
period the Arabs often
interrupted the ambassador with
shouts and heckling. Rabin
reacted with smiles, but found it
convenient to leave out a rear
entrance at the end of the
discussion. He was rushed into a
police car and carried swiftly
away.

The ambassador showed signs
of annoyance only when students
who wanted to hear him had to be
admitted through the rear door
onto the balcony. Later during
the speech demonstrators
marched around the balcony
peering in. Occasionally they
banged on the deck with sticks
and beat doors and windows in
time with the chanting.
Inside, Rabin said that the
Arabs urgently need peace. "The
real war," he said, "is against
hunger, poverty, disease, and
ignorance."
Want Peace
He repeated over and over that
the Israeli's want peace and that

they are ready to meet with Arab
leaders anytime for discussions
leading toward a peaceful solution
in the Middle East.
But he emphasized that even
without Arab cooperation "Israel
can live for 50 or 100 years." He
said, "We aren't ready for
halfbaked solutions which will
lead to another war, but we want
real peace and security."
Rabin was especially critical of
the USSR.
"The Soviet Union has decided
to exploit the conflict to gain
support in the Arab countries," he
said.
Con trol!* i nsion
"The Russians maintain
constant controlled tension—no
war and no peace. If there is peace
it will mark the end of the
Russian dream of dominance in
the Mediterranean. Peace means
redevelopment and the Russians
will offer little," he claimed, "not

because of moral conviction, but
because Israel will defeat the
Arabs and end the Russian
influence."
Toward the end of his talk,
about a dozen Arab students
came in the rear door. They
waited until the questioning
period to bring up the subject of
the ousted Palestinian Arabs.
Rabin embarked upon an
involved answer and was
interrupted often throughout.
At this point six deputies came
in to keep order. Those outside
shouted "pigs off campus."
During the question and answer
period the Arabs often
interrupted the ambassador with
shouts and heckling. Rabin
reacted with smiles, but found it
convenient to leave out a rear
entrance at the end of the
discussion. He was rushed into a
police car and carried swiftly
away.

AFTERMATH—Members of the Free Campus Movement (above) plan to press
assault and battery charges against radicals, who fought with them. Some of the
GF picketers allegedly struck several of the conservative students.
Israeli Ambassador Yitzhak
Rabin found more than a listening
audience yesterday at the
Tresidder Large Lounge. A
chanting, shouting group of
picketers attempted to disrupt his
address.
More than 30 demonstrators,
many of them Arabs, rattled
windows and hurled epithets at
the ambassador from outside the
Lounge. At one point doors had
to be locked to prevent the
protestors from entering.
Many of the demonstrators had
participated in the protest at the
Stanford Placement Center earlier.
Following the melee in the Union
they joined the Israel protest
upstairs.
The start of the ambassador's
talk was delayed about 15
minutes while a false fire alarm
sounded and doors were closed.
Six Santa Clara County Sheriff's
deputies came to the lounge
toward the end of his talk to
guard against any possible trouble.
Protect Safety
The poli'-e had been called by
plainclothesmen who were already
present to protect the safety of
Rabin. University officials
emphasized they had nothing to
do with calling the police on
campus.
