# Faculty Senate Decision
## Semester System Rejected 
### JUDY BIRK 
The "Great Calendar
Controversy" was at least
temporarily resolved yesterday
when the Faculty Senate voted
against changing Stanford's
academic calendar from the
quarter to the semester system.
General dissatisfaction with the
present quarter system was
expressed by faculty senators,
particularly those in the
Humanities and Sciences, but the
Senate's action is, in effect, a
re-affirmation of the quarter
system.
The recommendations of the
Ad Hoc Senate Committee on the
Calendar and Reading Period was
rejected by the Senate. It read as
follows:
Resolved that a semester
system, including a three-week
reading period and examination
period in each term, be instituted
in the academic year 1970-71, or
if that is not feasible, in the
academic year 1 97 I -72.
Resolved that the faculty of
each school be given the
responsibility to determine its
own calendar.
Resolved that it is the sense of

the Senate that the academic
calendar should be changed every
seven years, alternating between a
semester plan and a quarter plan.
Reading Period
Professor Edwin M Good,
Chairman of the Ad Hoc
Committee, stated that the
committee's primary concern was
adjusting the academic calendar to
allow time for a three week
reading period. The Committee
found a reading period extremely
difficult to insert into the quarter
system.
In forming its
recommendations, the Committee
considered the question: what is
the educational message conveyed
to students by the calendar? If a
reading period were instituted, it
would convey the message that
students need time to reflect on a
course's matter according to the
Committee.
In rejection of the Committee's
proposals it was argued that the
present quarter system allows
maximum flexibility as 2 or even
3-quarter courses may be devised.
Alternative Schemes
The faculty Senate discussed at
length several alternative course

credit schemes prepared by
Professor W.M. Kays, Executive
Head of the Mechanical
Engineering Department. The
alternatives ranged from retaining
the present unit system with no
changes to a proposal to adopt a
course system in which -18 courses
would be required for graduation.
Although the Senate took no
action on the issue, two
alternatives in particular were
recommended for further study
by the Senate Steering
Committee. The first alternative
recommends retention of the unit
system but a reduction of the
University graduate requirement
from 180 to 144 units. The
normal quarter load would then
be 1 2 units, the minimum being 9
units.
The second alternative favored
by Senate calls for adoption of a
course system in which 36 courses
would be required for graduation.
The normal load would be 3
courses with a maximum on 4
courses and a minimum of 2. This
alternative is essentially the SES
proposal.
The various alternative course
credit schemes will be studied
further in committee before they
are brought before the faculty
Senate for a vote.
