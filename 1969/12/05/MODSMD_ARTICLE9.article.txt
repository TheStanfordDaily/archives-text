# Rightists To Charge Assault And Battery
## 
### TOM GIVEN BILL FREIVOGEL 
Reeling from yesterday
afternoon's fisticuffs, the Free
Campus Movement decided last
night to fight back by pressing
asault and battery charges against
its young radical attackers.
FCM president Harvey Hukari
also criticized the failure of
campus police to break up the
melee, and in a private meeting
with Provost Richard Lyman
questioned the administration's
policy on the use of police in such
incidents.
Hukari said he thought the
thirty minutes that the fight
lasted without police intervention
was excessive.
Lyman agreed, but said he
"never asked that police not go
in" to break up the crowd inside
Tresidder. He also noted that he
had asked campus security
personnel to get more people
there.
Prior to the Hukari-Lyman
meeting last night, FCM members
had assembled at their Free
Market meeting room to rehash
the afternoon's events. There was
no open hostility in their
conversations, but most appeared
surprised and a few angered. The
conservatives were especially
bewildered at the meager police
reaction.
Where Were Police?
Freshman John Tolan, an FCM
sympathizer, charged, "I told the
Stanford cops that eight kids were
pinned up against a wall ... it
turned out the officers were under
orders not to go into the building.
They came, but were not allowed
out of their cars. It appears that
Stanford had not given them
permission to enter Tresidder."
Despite Lyman's denial of this
allegation, the cause of the police
delay remains a mystery. Campus
police Captain Bill Wullschleger
said he and Chief Tomas Bell
"went right into the middle" of
the tussle; but added, "After 10
or 15 minutes, we saw we weren't
getting anywhere.
"We worked our way outside,"
he continued, "and used our
walkie-talkie to suggest the Dean
of Students eome over, and then
we went back into the crowd."
Five minutes later the combatants
began to disperse.
Police Available
Uniformed campus police were
available hi ; urrr> oi

summoned by either Stanlord
officer. Wullschleger explained
that he thought this action would
only escalate the conflict.
Dean of Students Peterßulkeley
did respond to the two officers'
calls for help by sending student
police to the scene; but the
incident was over before they
arrived.
FCM members will delve
further into Chief Thomas Bell's
handling of the affair today when
a delegation from the group meets
with the Stanford Police Chief.
Lawsuit Considered
Other afternoon activities
today will include a visit to thp
Palo Alto District Attorney's
office, where assaulted members
plan to file assault and battery
charges and go through pictures to
discover the identities of their
assailants. "We have a lot of
photos to go through," noted
Hukari. "(Now) it's essential to go
outside of the university because
that's the only way to get back at
these punks."
Noted Hukari, "The problem is
that the University and the
Stanford police didn't act in any
way to protect us. In this incident
we weren't doing anything more
than taking photos."
More Photos
Leaders of the group later
announced that they will continue
to photograph future
demo nstra t ions. Emphasized
Hukari, "We're not just turning
them over to the police. We're not
arms of the Santa Clara law
enforcement agencies. The photos
will be used in the ARENA, to
display law breaking in action."
One member indicated that
three campus policemen suggested
that the FCM file such a suit;
"They were pretty upset at being
held back."

Dean of Students Peterßulkeley
did respond to the two officers'
calls for help by sending student
police to the scene; but the
incident was over before they
arrived.
FCM members will delve
further into Chief Thomas Bell's
handling of the affair today when
a delegation from the group meets
with the Stanford Police Chief.
Lawsuit Considered
Other afternoon activities
today will include a visit to thp
Palo Alto District Attorney's
office, where assaulted members
plan to file assault and battery
charges and go through pictures to
discover the identities of their
assailants. "We have a lot of
photos to go through," noted
Hukari. "(Now) it's essential to go
outside of the university because
that's the only way to get back at
these punks."
Noted Hukari, "The problem is
that the University and the
Stanford police didn't act in any
way to protect us. In this incident
we weren't doing anything more
than taking photos."
More Photos
Leaders of the group later
announced that they will continue
to photograph future
demo nstra t ions. Emphasized
Hukari, "We're not just turning
them over to the police. We're not
arms of the Santa Clara law
enforcement agencies. The photos
will be used in the ARENA, to
display law breaking in action."
One member indicated that
three campus policemen suggested
that the FCM file such a suit;
"They were pretty upset at being
held back."
Reeling from yesterday
afternoon's fisticuffs, the Free
Campus Movement decided last
night to fight back by pressing
asault and battery charges against
its young radical attackers.
FCM president Harvey Hukari
also criticized the failure of
campus police to break up the
melee, and in a private meeting
with Provost Richard Lyman
questioned the administration's
policy on the use of police in such
incidents.
Hukari said he thought the
thirty minutes that the fight
lasted without police intervention
was excessive.
Lyman agreed, but said he
"never asked that police not go
in" to break up the crowd inside
Tresidder. He also noted that he
had asked campus security
personnel to get more people
there.
Prior to the Hukari-Lyman
meeting last night, FCM members
had assembled at their Free
Market meeting room to rehash
the afternoon's events. There was
no open hostility in their
conversations, but most appeared
surprised and a few angered. The
conservatives were especially
bewildered at the meager police
reaction.
Where Were Police?
Freshman John Tolan, an FCM
sympathizer, charged, "I told the
Stanford cops that eight kids were
pinned up against a wall ... it
turned out the officers were under
orders not to go into the building.
They came, but were not allowed
out of their cars. It appears that
Stanford had not given them
permission to enter Tresidder."
Despite Lyman's denial of this
allegation, the cause of the police
delay remains a mystery. Campus
police Captain Bill Wullschleger
said he and Chief Tomas Bell
"went right into the middle" of
the tussle; but added, "After 10
or 15 minutes, we saw we weren't
getting anywhere.
"We worked our way outside,"
he continued, "and used our
walkie-talkie to suggest the Dean
of Students eome over, and then
we went back into the crowd."
Five minutes later the combatants
began to disperse.
