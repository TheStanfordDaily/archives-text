Why engineering students graduate to Lockheed.
Progress is a matter of degrees. But, that's only the beginning. At Lockheed Missiles
and Space Company, we're working on wideworld ... otherworld ... upperworld ... and
subworld projects. □ We're pretty high on space... we've got Agena and other
extremely advanced programs to prove it. And, when it comes to ballistic missiles,
Polaris and Poseidon show an arc of triumph. We think deeply, t00... consider our
deep submergence vehicles, for example. And, just to show you our feet are solidly
on the ground, we're working on advanced land vehicles. Information? Business,
government and industry get it out of our systems.
LMSC has been in the sea...on land...in the air...in space...and now, we're com
ing to your campus. We'd like to talk to you about coming to LMSC. Contact your place
ment office for an appointment. Our interview team will be on campus January 12.
Move up to Lockheed... or move over for those who do. □If an interview is incon
venient at this time, write to: College Relations Coordinator, P.O. Box 504, Sunnyvale,
California 94088. LMSC is an equal opportunity employer.
