# Grass Roots Organizing
## Land Use Stirs New Debate 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
After six months of rising
criticism, the University is
beginning a comprehensive review
of its land development policies.
Stanford's master plan for
industrial and commercial
development has spurred rapid
growth in he midpeninsula area
since 1952, but has brought with
it the worsening problems of
overcrowding, pollution, and a
critical housing shortage.
Opposition from local residents
has grown louder as Stanford
continued to expand its Industrial
Park. The Coyote Hill excavation
is being challenged by a lawsuit
from conservationists and a group
of Stanford law students.
Now a new group, Grass Roots,
has announced that it will provide
the first organized opposition to a
giant office-hotel complex on
Stanford land to be built by the
Dillingham Corporation. A Grass
Roots leaflet distributed in
registration packets today
questioned all further
non -academic development of
Stanford lands, except for
low-cost housing.
Grass Roots Forum
Grass Roots has scheduled a
public forum on "Stanford Land
and the Crisis in the Midpeninsula
Environment" for 7:30 p.m.
Wednesday in Cubberley
Auditorium
The re-evaluation of University
policy will be conducted by the
Committee on Land and Building
Development, chaired by chemical
engineering professor David
Mason. The committee passes on
all land development proposals for
academic and non-academic
purposes.
"Several committee members
feel we have been acting on things
too late, with too little
information," says Mason. The
Committee wants to find out
more about how the University
business office and planning
department develop programs for
land use.
In past years some committee
members complained that they
were just a "rubber stamp" for
new projects, says Mason. One
member circulated a
memorandum suggesting that the
committee should either be
dissolved or transformed into a
more effective watchdog on
University policies.
Last October the committee
received seven new members and a
new "charge" from President
Pitzer to look into all aspects of
Stanford's land policies. "Pitzer is
very anxious to update the master
plan," says Mason.
Mason has planned three
special meetings with
administrators in January to give
committee members the facts and
background they don't have. The

first cf these briefings will take
place today in the faculty club, to
review Stanford's five-year plan
for academic development.
Stop Development
One committee member,
psychology professor George A.
Kaplan, announced at the
committee's last meeting
December 29 that he seriously
questions whether Stanford
should go ahead with any land
development that will bring more
people into the area.
"More offices and factories
have a harmful effect on the
midpeninsula environment, and
they don't seem to be justified by
the small financial return to the
University," Kaplan said later.
No matter what the outcome
of the committee's study, some
changes seem likely for Stanford's
master plan. The plan currently
lists 1163 acres of vacant land as
available for eventual industrial
development, which could bring
as many as 36,000 more
employees to the area.
Environment and housing groups
seem dead-set against continued
industrial development.
Increased revenue is the main
reason for continued land
development, according to
University spokesmen. The
Coyote Hill development could
bring $200,000 annually at
present rates of return on the
University endowment, and the
Dillingham complex would earn
between $100,000 and $200,000.
Since the newly-constituted
Land and Building Development
Committee held its first meeting
in November, it has been getting
"tougher" in its scrutiny of
development projects, according
to Mason. "The committee is
getting more and more involved in
details."
Recently the committee
refused to approved the

architectural design of the new
education school research and
development building. The
committee asked for
modifications that will be
presented at a meeting January 9.
Stanford Elementary School
The committee has called for
completely fresh consideration of
possible uses for the Stanford
Elementary School site on
Mayfield Road near the center of
campus. The old committee had
suggested that garden apartments,
with preference for senior and
emeritus faculty, be built on the
site. Now the committee will
re-examine proposals for
recreational facilities and a
child-care center. "We're open to
more suggestions," says Mason.
The most controversial
Stanford projects now underway
were approved long before the
present committee was appointed.
These are the Coyote Hill
Industrial Park expansion, and the
Dillingham office-hotel complex
on El Camino Real at Page Mill
Road.
Coyote Hill
The Coyote Hill development
will subdivide a 177-acre foothill
area into 12 lots for industrial
tenants. When all the lots are
leased, a total of 3,000 to 5,000
more employees will be added to
the midpeninsula's tight housing
market and congested roads.
When construction of roads
started last summer at Coyote
Hill, several groups made vocal
criticisms and tried to block
approval for the project by the
Palo Alto Planning Commission
and City Council. Eventually the
development was approved by a
5-4 vote in the City Council, but
this decision is being challenged in
a lawsuit by the Environmental
Law Society and Committee for
Green Foothills which alleges
conflict of interest by two
councilmen.

As of last month, only one
lease had actually been signed for
Coyote Hill, according to Boyd
Smith, Stanford real estate
manager. Six other prospective
tenants were at various stages of
negotiations with Stanford.
The other controversial
Stanford project is the "Palo Alto
Square" development by the
Dillingham corporation on a
21-acre site at El Camino and Page
Mill Road. Two 10-story office
towers specializing in finance, and
a 17-story hotel are planned,
bringing about 1,500 more
employees to the area. The
complex will generate 8,300 more
automobile trips per day,
according to the city of Palo Alto,
necessitating a new overpass and
road expansion.
The actual lease for the
Dillingham site has not yet been
signed, according to Boyd Smith.
Construction is expected to begin
sometime this month or next
month, however.
The new Grass Roots
organization announced today
that a peaceful protest
demonstration will be held at the
Dillingham site on January 12.
The Stanford administration is
simultaneously taking action to
answer criticism of its land
development policies. A booklet
called "Questions and Answers
About Stanford Land
Development" is being prepared
by the University Relations
Office.
The related issue of low-cost
housing will also be in the
forefront of campus news this
month. The Ad-Hoc Housing
Advisory Committee, chaired by
history professor Gordon Wright,
plans to hear "all interested
groups" on the housing issue at
hearings in mid-January. Wright
has invited persons who wish to
speak to contact him
immediately.


THE NEW PALO ALTO?—Groundbreaking is near i'or this huge $12 million office-hotel complex at the corner of El
Camino and Page Mill Road on Stanford land, to be built by Dillingham Corp. A new Stanford organization, Grass Roots,
has protested that the complex will harm the environment and worsen the housing shortage by bringing 1,500 more
employees to the area. The University says it needs the money—an estimated $100,000 to $200,000 per year. Grass
Roots plans an educational forum Wednesday at 7:30 in Cubberley Auditorium and a peaceful protest demonstration at
the Dillingham site on January 12.
