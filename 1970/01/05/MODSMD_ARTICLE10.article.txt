# Fellow Nominations
## 
### 
University President Kenneth
S. Pitzer, has released a letter
(printed below) asking the
Stanford Community to submit

nominations for University
Fellows.
The Fellows of the University
program frees two faculty
members each year for a three
year period from their normal
duties. Instead, they use half their
time for their own development as
teachers and scholars and half on
such things as the promotion of
undergraduate education.
The program asks for young,
promising faculty members who
are willing to work on
University-wide problems. The
deadline for nominations is
January 15, 1970.
The full text of the letter
follows:
To the Stanford Community:
As you will recall, the Fellows of the
University program was launched last
year, financed by a grant from the
Ford Foundation, for the purpose of
encouraging responsible participation
in the University's affairs by junior
members of the faculty. Last April the
first four Fellows of the University
were named: Professors J. Merrill
Carlsmith, Bradley Efron, Robert J.
Madix and Mark Mancall.
Under this program, two or three
young faculty members each year are
released from their regular obligations
for a three-year period (with
corresponding reimbursement to their
schools or departments). These
University Fellows have half of their
time free for their own development as
teachers and scholars. The other half is
devoted to University service in a wide
variety of areas, with one very
important area being the promotion of
educational innovation at the
undergraduate level. In that specific
role, they help to administer the
Innovation Fund that is also provided
for by the Ford grant.
The purpose of this announcement
is to ask for nominations of young
faculty members from any school or
department in the University as
potential Fellows of the University,
beginning in Autumn Quarter 1970.
There are no fixed age or rank
limitations. The Fellows should be
young men or women whose future at
Stanford appears bright and who give
promise of becoming not only
distinguished teachers and scholars but
also academic statesmen who are
willing and able to help identify and
work on University-wide problems. We
hope to select two new Fellows during
the Winter Quarter. Therefore, please
send your nominations to me by
January 15, 1970.
Let me take this opportunity to
express once again my enthusiasm for
this program, which seeks to
strengthen the University as an
institution, and my appreciation to
those who will help by insuring that
the most qualified of our younger
faculty members are nominated as
University Fellows.
Yours very sincerely, K.S. Pitzer
