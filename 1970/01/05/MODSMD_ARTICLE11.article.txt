# In FCM-Radical Melee
## Police Role Questioned 
### 
Changes in the role of the
Stanford police are being
contemplated in the wake of last
month's fight between
conservatives and radicals in the
Tresidder Union lobby.
Commenting on the presence
of off-campus persons in that
incident, pitzer said the fact that
the University has little
jurisdiction over such persons
"forces us to give further
attention to the use of campus
police with increased authority or
Santa Clara County sheriff's
deputies."
The brawl erupted when
members of the conservative Free
Campus Movement (formerly

YAF) attempted to leave an SDS
demonstration against General
Electric recruiters. The
conservatives had been taking
pictures. Some of the
demonstrators attacked the
conservatives in an attempt to
prevent possible use of the
pictures by police. Several
conservatives were roughed up by
the group of mostly non-Stanford
Students.
FCM spokesmen and others
were highly critical of the failure
of Stanford or Santa Clara police
to break up the fight. Provost
Richard Lyman explained after
the incident that Stanford police
are not trained to handle

disturbances on campus. Such
disturbances are the responsibility
of the Santa Clara Sheriff's
Department. Stanford police are
not deputized officers and have
no arrest powers. Santa Clara
officers were on campus at the
time of the assault providing
security for the visiting Israeli
ambassador. These officers called
for other officers to break up the
fight which ended before deputies
arrived.
Pitzer said the University needs
"a more precise code of conduct"
than that provided by the
Fundamental Standard and the
campus policy on disruptions.
Conservative students have
filed assault charges against several
of the demonstrators. Most of
those attacking the FCM members
were apparently non-Stanford
students.
