# Students Selected For Judicial Council
## 
### 
After a three month delay,
student members of the Student
Judicial Council have been
appointed. The four faculty
members were appointed in
September.
There has been no active
Judicial Council since last June
when the old Council dissolved
with graduation. But, with the
selection of the students, the
Council could start hearing
complaints this week.
The four students selected by
the nominating committee are:
Frederick Dietz, business student;
Lynn Karowsky, junior in
policital science; H. Renton
Rolph, senion in political science;
and James Ware, law student.
Alternates selected (in order)
are: Samuel Adenubi, graduate
student in mechanical engineering;
Kent Conrad, junion in political
science; James Jenkins, senior in
English; and Richard Halpern,
senior in economics.
There was no Judicial Council
fall quarter because of a delay in
selecting the student members.
Last year's student legislature
failed to appoint three members
to a committee that would

nominate the student members.
Further delay resulted from
difficulties in organizing the new
student Senate this fall. The
student appointments to the
Judicial Council were finally
announced on December 12.
According to Gene F. Franklin,
professor of electrical engineering
and a faculty member on the
Judicial Council, the Council met
twice with University President
Kenneth Pitzer during finals week
in discussing the selection of a
chairman for the Council (the
chairman must be a Faculty
member from the Law School).
They made a recommendation,
but it is unknown if the appointee
has decided to accept the
position. A regular meeting of the
Judicial Council could take place
on Thursday if the chairman is
appointed by then.
Faculty members on the
Judicial Council are: Marc A.
Franklin, professor of law; Gene
F. Franklin, professor of electrical
engineering; Leonard M.
Horowitz, associate professor of
psychology; and David G.
Halliburton, assistant professor of
English.
