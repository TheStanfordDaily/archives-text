# Some Charges Dropped
## Six Plead Guilty In SRI Case 
### 
Stanford junior John Shoch
and the five other members of the
"barricade group" pleaded guilty
over vacation to unlawful
assembley in connection with last
spring's Stanford Research
Institute demonstrations.

Sentencing is scheduled for
sometime in the next few weeks.
The District Attorney dropped
"in the interests of justice"
charges of inciting to riot,
obstruction free movement,
disturbing the peace and failure to
disperse.
Shoch said that they entered a
guilty plea because "under the
terms of the California Penal
Code, every person at SRI that
day was guilty of unlawful
assembly."
Shock had earlier been
acquited of assault and battery
charges arising out of last spring's
SRI demonstrations. Ex-student
Mike Vawter and his wife Jan

were convicted of one count each
of assault in the trial which ended
during dead week.
Shoch and the Vawters were
accused of assaulting Palo Alto
Times photographer Gene Tupper,
while trying to take film from
him.
A fine of $400 and two years
probation was levied on the
Vawters.
In a related action William
Henry McCarthy, a sophmore,
plead nolo contendere (no
contest) to three misdemeanor
charges dating from the May 16
SRI demonstration. The District
Attorney dropped failure to
disperse and assault charges.
