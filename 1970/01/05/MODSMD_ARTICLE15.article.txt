# Board Increase Sought
## 
### 
The Stanford Trustees have
gone to court. They need the
permission of the Santa Clara
Superior Court to have the
election of some Trustees by
alumni and to change the term of
Trustees from the present ten
years to five years.
The change in the composition
of the Board was announced last
fall but any changes in the
selection or number of Trustees
need court approval. The Board
membership is being expanded
from the present 23 to 32. Eight
of the new members will be elected
by the alumni association, four of

them under 36 years of age and
four over. The ninth position will
be occupied by the University
president.
In their petition to the court
the Trustees state, "The alumni
continue to be an increasingly
important source of contribution,
and their support must be
broadened and increased to enable
Standord University to maintain
its educational standards."
Formally the petition seeks a
modification of the trust relating
to the creation and operation of
the University. Approval of the
court is expected.
