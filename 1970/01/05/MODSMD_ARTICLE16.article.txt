# Vacation Crimes
## Poison Stolen, Doctor Shot 
### 
Winter break provided a field
day for thieves on the Stanford
campus. Other serious crimes,
including murder, have also been
reported during the past two
weeks.
During exam week, a safe
containing deadly M99-Etorphine
and some cash was stolen from
the University hospital. A 24 year

old coed was raped near the
entrance pillars on Palm Drive.
Neither case has been solved,
although there have been some
leads in the safe burglary.
On Friday, Dec. 19, Dr. Leslie
James Kulhanek, a physician at
the Medical Center, was shot at
the Center's annual Christmas
party after an argument with
another employee who was
dancing with his wife. Kulhanek
died the next morning, despite
emergency surgery and extensive
blood transfusions when gunshot
wounds destroyed the vital vessels
of his heart.
Rudolph McKinley Gray, 25, a
computer attendant at the
Medical Center, turned himself in
to authorities about two hours
after the shooting. Palo Alto
police arrested him and charged
him with murder.
Vandalism recorded during the
vacation includes: destruction of a
newspaper vending machine;
stealing $121 worth of towels and
pillow cases from Toyon; and
stealing a tape deck, valued at
$175, from an auto parked in the
Tresidder Union parking lot.

According to a University
spokesman, the looting is "a part
of the three or more burglaries we
have a night."
Three youths were arrested by
a University patrolman after the
car in which they were riding was
found to contain loot from a law
student's room in Mayfield House.
According to police, a typewriter,
a television set, stereo equipment,
and an AM-FM radio were
recovered from the car. The three
were being held at North County
Jail, Palo Alto, on charges of
burglary.
Another safe, this one from the
Business School, was stolen during
the vacation, but an alert
University policeman was able to
capture two of three suspected
youths and retrieve the safe - but
not its contents - before the trio
could get off campus. The third
youth escaped with more than
$800 of the loot. The other two,
residents of Palo Alto, were
arrested carrying the safe, which
originally contained $844, as they
walked down Galvez St. at 1:15
a.m. Dec. 26.
Police at first thought that the
safe was the one stolen earlier
from the Medical Center, but later
learned that the Business School
had been vandalized. The youths
were booked on suspicion of
burglary and possession of stolen
property.

containing deadly M99-Etorphine
and some cash was stolen from
the University hospital. A 24 year

old coed was raped near the
entrance pillars on Palm Drive.
Neither case has been solved,
although there have been some
leads in the safe burglary.
On Friday, Dec. 19, Dr. Leslie
James Kulhanek, a physician at
the Medical Center, was shot at
the Center's annual Christmas
party after an argument with
another employee who was
dancing with his wife. Kulhanek
died the next morning, despite
emergency surgery and extensive
blood transfusions when gunshot
wounds destroyed the vital vessels
of his heart.
Rudolph McKinley Gray, 25, a
computer attendant at the
Medical Center, turned himself in
to authorities about two hours
after the shooting. Palo Alto
police arrested him and charged
him with murder.
Vandalism recorded during the
vacation includes: destruction of a
newspaper vending machine;
stealing $121 worth of towels and
pillow cases from Toyon; and
stealing a tape deck, valued at
$175, from an auto parked in the
Tresidder Union parking lot.

According to a University
spokesman, the looting is "a part
of the three or more burglaries we
have a night."
Three youths were arrested by
a University patrolman after the
car in which they were riding was
found to contain loot from a law
student's room in Mayfield House.
According to police, a typewriter,
a television set, stereo equipment,
and an AM-FM radio were
recovered from the car. The three
were being held at North County
Jail, Palo Alto, on charges of
burglary.
Another safe, this one from the
Business School, was stolen during
the vacation, but an alert
University policeman was able to
capture two of three suspected
youths and retrieve the safe - but
not its contents - before the trio
could get off campus. The third
youth escaped with more than
$800 of the loot. The other two,
residents of Palo Alto, were
arrested carrying the safe, which
originally contained $844, as they
walked down Galvez St. at 1:15
a.m. Dec. 26.
Police at first thought that the
safe was the one stolen earlier
from the Medical Center, but later
learned that the Business School
had been vandalized. The youths
were booked on suspicion of
burglary and possession of stolen
property.
Winter break provided a field
