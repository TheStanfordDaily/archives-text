# YR Trio Fired On
## 
### 
A bullet was fired into a car
occupied by three conservative
Stanford students on the morning
of December 9. The three
students were returning from San
Francisco airport where they had
just dropped off conservative
columnist William F. Buckley
after his speech in Memorial
Auditorium. Jackson Booth,
Roger Reed and Mike Wolf were
not injured.
The shot was fiÂ»-ed into the car,
owned by Reed, president of the
Stanford Young Republicans, and
driven by Wolf, past President of
the YR's. As the trio passed a
white camper truck that had
attempted to run them off the
road in Atherton, the camper
driver fired.
Atherton police immediately
stopped the camper and arrested
the driver, Jerry Jones of East
Palo Alto, charging him with
attempted murder. According to
Reed, Jones appeared to be
intoxicated and was middle-aged.
Standord conservative leader
Harvey Hukari says there was no
relation between the shooting and
recent conservative activities on
campus.
The shot lodged in Reed's car
and came from a .22 calliber
revolver. Such a revolver was
found in the cab of the truck.
