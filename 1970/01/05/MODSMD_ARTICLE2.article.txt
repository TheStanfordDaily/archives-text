## Miss. To Integrate Today 
### 
JACKSON, Miss. (AP)-A
federal court order takes effect
today to desegregate schools in 30
Mississippi districts. Gov. John
Bell Williams has told
Mississippians there is no legal
way to avoid the order and
cautioned them against any
violence.
"With God's help," Gov.
Williams said in an address on
statewide radio and television,
"let us make the best of a bad
situation."
But there were some who were
afraid of a new outbreak of racial
strife.
A force of 50 U.S. marshals
moved in during the weekend, not
because of any overt threat of
violence but to prevent any
recurrence of past troubles.
Some parent and church
groups have advised their
members to accept the
desegregation order, which is a
result of the U.S. Supreme Court
ruling Oct. 29 that the schools
must be desegregated now. Some
220 schools with a total
enrollment of about 135,000
pupils are involved, according to
figures supplied by the U.S.
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare.
Williams said in his address
Saturday night that 100 new
private schools have been

established in the 30 districts, in
churches, a factory and other
available facilities. He said he
would back a movement to build
up a private school system as a
"workable alternative" to public
schools.
Cautioning against violence,
Williams said, "Preservation of
public school is essential . . . Let
us remember that the public
schools, after all, are still public
property and willful damage or
destruction of these properties is
senseless. It is like cutting off a
nose to spite a face. Nothing can
be gained through violence acts of
any kind."
Aimew in Asia
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP)-Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew renewed
for worried Thai leaders Sunday
the U.S. pledge to stand by its
treaty commitments. He charged
that some congressional leaders
have permitted political
considerations to disrupt
America's relations with its
friends.
Agnew discussed these
questions at a private meeting
with Field Marshal Thanom
Kittikachorn, prime minister of
Thailand, and other Thai leaders.
American officials said the
meeting helped greatly to allay

fears that the United States might
renege on its Southeast Asis
Treaty Organization obligations.
"Some people back home are
so anxious to make friends of our
enemies that they even seem
ready to make enemies of our
friends," Agnew told the Thai
officials at the session, the
officials reported.
Sens. J. VV. Fulbright, D-Ark.,
Stuart Symington, D-Mo., and
Albert Gore, D-Tenn., have
questioned the extent of U.S.
committments to Thailand, while
Sens. John Sherman Cooper,
R-Ky., Frank Church, D-Idaho,
and Gordon Allott, R-Colo., were
leaders in the effort that resulted
in approval of a rider to the
defense appropriations act barring
use of American ground troops in
Laos or Thailand without specific
congressional approval.
Interrogation
SAIGON (Al')-A 01 newscaster
relieved of duty for accusing the
U.S. Command on a telecast of
suppressing unfavorable news said
Sunday night that high officers
attempted to interrogate him Tor
four hours without legal counsel.
Spec. 5 Robert Lawrence, 27,
of Atlanta, Ga., quoted one
colonel in the U.S. Command

inspector-general's office as telling
him Gen. Creighton W. Abrams
''was pressing for this
investigation and he had to get the
facts and they were to get the
facts."
A spokesman for the U.S.
Command said there would be no
immediate comment on
Lawrence's statements.
Earlier, the Command said
there would be an investigation of
Lawrence's broadcast "to decide
if there was any violation of a
military regulation." Until that
investigation is completed, the
command added, there would be
no comment on allegations made.
Abrams, commander of the
U.S. Military Assistance
Command Vietnam MACV which
oversees the American Forces
Vietnam Network AFVN, was
released from a hospital Saturday.
11<> is on a few days lease after
recovering from Pneumonia.
Lawrence said the
inspector-general's office finally
yielded to his request for legal
counsel and he was told to return
Monday, at which time he would
be provided a military attorney
for the interrogation.
