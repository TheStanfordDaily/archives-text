# Trustees To Review BYU Ban In Reaction To Alum Pressure
## 
### FRED MANN 
The Stanford Board of
Trustees will respond to the
demands of numerous alumni and
will discuss President Kenneth
Pitzer's controversial "Brigham
Young decision" at their meeting
next week.
The policy decision banning all
activities with BYU because of
alleged racial discrimination in the
Morman Church which sponsors
the university has caused a furor
among both Stanford alumni and
Mormons throughout the country.
Demands for Pitzer's ouster have
come from many sides, but Board
President W. Parmer Fuller 111
emphasized that Pitzer's fate will
not be discussed at the Board
meeting.
The controversy stems from
Pitzer's action in response to the
Stanford Human Relations
Commission which recommended
the break with BYU. In a
statement released November 11,
Pitzer asked the Stanford Athletic

Department to schedule no
further events with Brigham
Young University or other
institutions sponsored by the
Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints.
"I make this request on the
basis of the Human Relations
Commission recommendations
that states that it shall be the
policy of this university 'not to
schedule events with any
university, college, club, or other
institution or organization which
practices discrimination in any
manner on the basis of race or
national origin or which is
affiliated with or sponsored by an
institution which does so."
Mormon church policy states
that no Negro of African lineage
man may have the right of
priesthood. "So long as this policy
remains in effect," said Pitzer, "it is
my opinion that it constitutes
discrimination on the basis of race
within the meaning of the
guidelines established by the
Human Relations Commission."
BYU Blasts Policy
BYU and Mormon officials
blasted the Stanford policy calling
it "reverse discrimination on
hearsay evidence only." Dr.
Ernest L. Wilkinson, president of
the Utah school stated that BYU
has ''no policy which
discriminates in any way against
any race, and those who state
otherwise are either uninformed
or unfair."
"Friends and members of the
Mormon church now feel they
have been doubly discriminated
against," said Wilkinson. "First
because Dr. Pitzer has attempted
to set himself up as a judge of
their religious faith, and second,
because he has not applied the
same test to others."
Angry At Handling
Mormon officials were angered
by the handling of the policy
announcement. According to
Wilkinson, Stanford did not check
with any policy makers at BYU in
forming their decision, and only
informed Mormon officials of the

new policy while it was being
released to the press.
Stanford officials subsequently
apologized for the handling of the
announcement. It was emphasized
the apology was for the handling
and not for the substance of the
Pitzer decision.
It was apparently the handling
of the decision that disturbed
most ot the upset Stanford
alumni. Robert M. Levison, new
president of the Stanford Alumni
Association believes only a small
group of alumni think Pitzer made
a mistake.
Demand Firing
Several vocal alumni, acting
individually, have sent letters to
the Board of Trustees demanding
the firing of Pitzer, the reversal of
the decision, or both.
Hillsborough attorney Philip
Ray disclaimed the idea that he
was leading a crusade against
Pitzer, but "like many Stanford
alumni, I'm seriously offended by
Pitzer's decision."
Outspoken alumnus Maury M.
Travis of Denver has sent out
letters calling for Pitzer's ouster,
and criticizes the president for
"permitting an entire series of
radical incidents to embroil the
university in degenerative radical
permissiveness." The Class of '26
graduate called the "proscription"
against BYU "a disgrace" and
"the last straw."
Now, the debate has spread
throughout the country.
Syndicated columnist James J.
Kilpatrick wrote the "hot-eyed
liberals at Stanford" had
high-pressured Pitzer. He added:
"The incident provides a sad
example of what happens when
men who are obsessed with racial
discrimination become bigots on
their own."
Not Judge BYU
The Human Relations
Commission is made up of faculty
and students Pitzer's action on
their proposals deals only with
discrimination in Mormon Church
policy, and does not judge
conditions on the BYU campus
itself.

According to figures released
through the New York Times,
there are currently three blacks
enrolled at BYU out of 25,000
students.
The Mormon school has been
the target of numerous protests
throughout the fall. Football
teams from Wyoming University,
San Jose State, and elsewhere
have waged armband
demonstrations against the
Mormon racial policy. Stanford is
the only school to cut relations
entirely.
Scheduled Games
Stanford and BYU are
currently under contract for two
basketball games to be played
next season, and Pitzer stated that
the games would be held as
scheduled.
In the future, all proposed
schedules from the Athletic
Department will be submitted to
the Human Relations Commission
for screening. Any discriminatory
schools will be removed from the
lists.
In his statement, BYU
president Wilkinson said he felt
his school was being singled out
unfairly:
"We feel sure by way of
examples, that Stanford would
not refuse to play Notre Dame
because Pope Paul's position with
respect to priesthood, or celibacy,
or divorce, or birth control, may
be different from the views of
Stanford's Human Relations
Commission or those of President
Pitzer.
"Or that Stanford would not
refuse to play a Jewish instition of
higher learning because the Jewish
faith frowns on mixed marriage
with other races, does not permit
women to become rabbis, and
many orthodox Jews sincerely
believe themselves to be God's
Chosen People."
Wilkinson added he is taking
no part in the controversy
surrounding Pitzer's job as
Stanford president. His fate is "a
matter solely for Stanford and its
board of trustees," he said.

Mormon officials were angered
by the handling of the policy
announcement. According to
Wilkinson, Stanford did not check
with any policy makers at BYU in
forming their decision, and only
informed Mormon officials of the

new policy while it was being
released to the press.
Stanford officials subsequently
apologized for the handling of the
announcement. It was emphasized
the apology was for the handling
and not for the substance of the
Pitzer decision.
It was apparently the handling
of the decision that disturbed
most ot the upset Stanford
alumni. Robert M. Levison, new
president of the Stanford Alumni
Association believes only a small
group of alumni think Pitzer made
a mistake.
Demand Firing
Several vocal alumni, acting
individually, have sent letters to
the Board of Trustees demanding
the firing of Pitzer, the reversal of
the decision, or both.
Hillsborough attorney Philip
Ray disclaimed the idea that he
was leading a crusade against
Pitzer, but "like many Stanford
alumni, I'm seriously offended by
Pitzer's decision."
Outspoken alumnus Maury M.
Travis of Denver has sent out
letters calling for Pitzer's ouster,
and criticizes the president for
"permitting an entire series of
radical incidents to embroil the
university in degenerative radical
permissiveness." The Class of '26
graduate called the "proscription"
against BYU "a disgrace" and
"the last straw."
Now, the debate has spread
throughout the country.
Syndicated columnist James J.
Kilpatrick wrote the "hot-eyed
liberals at Stanford" had
high-pressured Pitzer. He added:
"The incident provides a sad
example of what happens when
men who are obsessed with racial
discrimination become bigots on
their own."
Not Judge BYU
The Human Relations
Commission is made up of faculty
and students Pitzer's action on
their proposals deals only with
discrimination in Mormon Church
policy, and does not judge
conditions on the BYU campus
itself.

According to figures released
through the New York Times,
there are currently three blacks
enrolled at BYU out of 25,000
students.
The Mormon school has been
the target of numerous protests
throughout the fall. Football
teams from Wyoming University,
San Jose State, and elsewhere
have waged armband
demonstrations against the
Mormon racial policy. Stanford is
the only school to cut relations
entirely.
Scheduled Games
Stanford and BYU are
currently under contract for two
basketball games to be played
next season, and Pitzer stated that
the games would be held as
scheduled.
In the future, all proposed
schedules from the Athletic
Department will be submitted to
the Human Relations Commission
for screening. Any discriminatory
schools will be removed from the
lists.
In his statement, BYU
president Wilkinson said he felt
his school was being singled out
unfairly:
"We feel sure by way of
examples, that Stanford would
not refuse to play Notre Dame
because Pope Paul's position with
respect to priesthood, or celibacy,
or divorce, or birth control, may
be different from the views of
Stanford's Human Relations
Commission or those of President
Pitzer.
"Or that Stanford would not
refuse to play a Jewish instition of
higher learning because the Jewish
faith frowns on mixed marriage
with other races, does not permit
women to become rabbis, and
many orthodox Jews sincerely
believe themselves to be God's
Chosen People."
Wilkinson added he is taking
no part in the controversy
surrounding Pitzer's job as
Stanford president. His fate is "a
matter solely for Stanford and its
board of trustees," he said.
The Stanford Board of
Trustees will respond to the
demands of numerous alumni and
will discuss President Kenneth
Pitzer's controversial "Brigham
Young decision" at their meeting
next week.
The policy decision banning all
activities with BYU because of
alleged racial discrimination in the
Morman Church which sponsors
the university has caused a furor
among both Stanford alumni and
Mormons throughout the country.
Demands for Pitzer's ouster have
come from many sides, but Board
President W. Parmer Fuller 111
emphasized that Pitzer's fate will
not be discussed at the Board
meeting.
The controversy stems from
Pitzer's action in response to the
Stanford Human Relations
Commission which recommended
the break with BYU. In a
statement released November 11,
Pitzer asked the Stanford Athletic

Department to schedule no
further events with Brigham
Young University or other
institutions sponsored by the
Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints.
"I make this request on the
basis of the Human Relations
Commission recommendations
that states that it shall be the
policy of this university 'not to
schedule events with any
university, college, club, or other
institution or organization which
practices discrimination in any
manner on the basis of race or
national origin or which is
affiliated with or sponsored by an
institution which does so."
Mormon church policy states
that no Negro of African lineage
man may have the right of
priesthood. "So long as this policy
remains in effect," said Pitzer, "it is
my opinion that it constitutes
discrimination on the basis of race
within the meaning of the
guidelines established by the
Human Relations Commission."
BYU Blasts Policy
BYU and Mormon officials
blasted the Stanford policy calling
it "reverse discrimination on
hearsay evidence only." Dr.
Ernest L. Wilkinson, president of
the Utah school stated that BYU
has ''no policy which
discriminates in any way against
any race, and those who state
otherwise are either uninformed
or unfair."
"Friends and members of the
Mormon church now feel they
have been doubly discriminated
against," said Wilkinson. "First
because Dr. Pitzer has attempted
to set himself up as a judge of
their religious faith, and second,
because he has not applied the
same test to others."

the only school to cut relations
entirely.
Scheduled Games
Stanford and BYU are
currently under contract for two
basketball games to be played
next season, and Pitzer stated that
the games would be held as
scheduled.
In the future, all proposed
schedules from the Athletic
Department will be submitted to
the Human Relations Commission
for screening. Any discriminatory
schools will be removed from the
lists.
In his statement, BYU
president Wilkinson said he felt
his school was being singled out
unfairly:
"We feel sure by way of
examples, that Stanford would
not refuse to play Notre Dame
because Pope Paul's position with
respect to priesthood, or celibacy,
or divorce, or birth control, may
be different from the views of
Stanford's Human Relations
Commission or those of President
Pitzer.
"Or that Stanford would not
refuse to play a Jewish instition of
higher learning because the Jewish
faith frowns on mixed marriage
with other races, does not permit
women to become rabbis, and
many orthodox Jews sincerely
believe themselves to be God's
Chosen People."
Wilkinson added he is taking
no part in the controversy
surrounding Pitzer's job as
Stanford president. His fate is "a
matter solely for Stanford and its
board of trustees," he said.
The Stanford Board of
Trustees will respond to the
demands of numerous alumni and
will discuss President Kenneth
Pitzer's controversial "Brigham
Young decision" at their meeting
next week.
The policy decision banning all
activities with BYU because of
alleged racial discrimination in the
Morman Church which sponsors
the university has caused a furor
among both Stanford alumni and
Mormons throughout the country.
Demands for Pitzer's ouster have
come from many sides, but Board
President W. Parmer Fuller 111
emphasized that Pitzer's fate will
not be discussed at the Board
meeting.
The controversy stems from
Pitzer's action in response to the
Stanford Human Relations
Commission which recommended
the break with BYU. In a
statement released November 11,
Pitzer asked the Stanford Athletic

Department to schedule no
further events with Brigham
Young University or other
institutions sponsored by the
Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints.
"I make this request on the
basis of the Human Relations
Commission recommendations
that states that it shall be the
policy of this university 'not to
schedule events with any
university, college, club, or other
institution or organization which
practices discrimination in any
manner on the basis of race or
national origin or which is
affiliated with or sponsored by an
institution which does so."
Mormon church policy states
that no Negro of African lineage
man may have the right of
priesthood. "So long as this policy
remains in effect," said Pitzer, "it is
my opinion that it constitutes
discrimination on the basis of race
within the meaning of the
guidelines established by the
Human Relations Commission."
BYU Blasts Policy
BYU and Mormon officials
blasted the Stanford policy calling
it "reverse discrimination on
hearsay evidence only." Dr.
Ernest L. Wilkinson, president of
the Utah school stated that BYU
has ''no policy which
discriminates in any way against
any race, and those who state
otherwise are either uninformed
or unfair."
"Friends and members of the
Mormon church now feel they
have been doubly discriminated
against," said Wilkinson. "First
because Dr. Pitzer has attempted
to set himself up as a judge of
their religious faith, and second,
because he has not applied the
same test to others."
Angry At Handling
Mormon officials were angered
by the handling of the policy
announcement. According to
Wilkinson, Stanford did not check
with any policy makers at BYU in
forming their decision, and only
informed Mormon officials of the

new policy while it was being
released to the press.
Stanford officials subsequently
apologized for the handling of the
announcement. It was emphasized
the apology was for the handling
and not for the substance of the
Pitzer decision.
It was apparently the handling
of the decision that disturbed
most ot the upset Stanford
alumni. Robert M. Levison, new
president of the Stanford Alumni
Association believes only a small
group of alumni think Pitzer made
a mistake.
Demand Firing
Several vocal alumni, acting
individually, have sent letters to
the Board of Trustees demanding
the firing of Pitzer, the reversal of
the decision, or both.
Hillsborough attorney Philip
Ray disclaimed the idea that he
was leading a crusade against
Pitzer, but "like many Stanford
alumni, I'm seriously offended by
Pitzer's decision."
Outspoken alumnus Maury M.
Travis of Denver has sent out
letters calling for Pitzer's ouster,
and criticizes the president for
"permitting an entire series of
radical incidents to embroil the
university in degenerative radical
permissiveness." The Class of '26
graduate called the "proscription"
against BYU "a disgrace" and
"the last straw."
Now, the debate has spread
throughout the country.
Syndicated columnist James J.
Kilpatrick wrote the "hot-eyed
liberals at Stanford" had
high-pressured Pitzer. He added:
"The incident provides a sad
example of what happens when
men who are obsessed with racial
discrimination become bigots on
their own."
Not Judge BYU
The Human Relations
Commission is made up of faculty
and students Pitzer's action on
their proposals deals only with
discrimination in Mormon Church
policy, and does not judge
conditions on the BYU campus
itself.

According to figures released
through the New York Times,
there are currently three blacks
enrolled at BYU out of 25,000
students.
The Mormon school has been
the target of numerous protests
throughout the fall. Football
teams from Wyoming University,
San Jose State, and elsewhere
have waged armband
demonstrations against the
Mormon racial policy. Stanford is
the only school to cut relations
entirely.
