ASSU Council of Presidents
member Patrick A. Shea was one
of four students in the western
United States selected for a
Rhodes Scholarship last month.
James L. Gibbs, associate
professor of anthropology,
received the E. Harris Harbison
Prize for gifted teaching along
with 20 other college professors.
In addition physics and SLAC
director professor Wolfgang
Panofsky was one of six scientists
awarded the National Medal of
Science by President Nixon.
Patrick Shea, a 21-year-old
political science major, became
the 33rd Stanford student to win
a Rhodes Scholarship.
He will study at Oxford
University during 1970-71.
Shea was one of the first
student leaders to endorse the

national moratorium on Vietnam
last summer.
A former aide to Utah Sen.
Frank Moss, Shea has also served
as a Volunteer in Asia.
Last spring, he helped initiate a
special election of student
representatives to the Student
Education Council to work with
faculty counterparts on changes
recommended by the Study of
Education at Stanford. The two
groups subsequently agreed on
comprehensive changes in
curricular requirements.
A native of Salt Lake City,
Shea spent long hours there and
on campus with Mormons
following the University's
announcement that it would
schedule no new intercollegiate
contests with institutions
sponsored by the Mormon
Church.
Shea is the first Stanford
student selected for a Rhodes
since 1967, when two seniors
received the internationally famed
honor.
