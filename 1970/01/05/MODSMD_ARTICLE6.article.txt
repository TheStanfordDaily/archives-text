## A 						New Decade 
### 
The end of the 1960's brought with it a
torrent of "review of the decade"
mutterings from the mass media. Almost to
a one, they outlined the tensions,
frustrations, violence, and unhappiness of
the decade past. They gave a token nod at
the triumphs of the 1960's-space, civil
rights gains, unparalleled wealth, and the
Mets. And they closed with an uneasy
feeling, making vague references to the
flowering of individual will and common
purpose that will save us from ecological
death and war-produced destruction during
the 1970's.
On the campus, we have little to rejoice
with the coming of the new decade. The
American people and the American
university seem to have never been so far
apart. The half of the population that Time
magazine calls the Middle Americans rejects
and in many cases even despises the values,
life style, and urgent sense of mission felt
so passionately by students and faculty
alike. That sense of isolation was best
demonstrated by the disclosure yesterday
of the Gallup popularity poll that placed
Richard Nixon, Billy Graham, and Spiro
Agnew as the country's most revered
Americans. Only the Rev. Graham could
make a safe appearance on most college
campuses, and that would be mostly for
laughs.
With the divisions in the country such as
they are, the recent furor over President
Kenneth Pitzer's announcement last
quarter that Stanford was severing relations
with Brigham Young Universi 1 *

its racial policies comes as little surprise.
For many, the country's colleges and
universities have served as one of the
bulwarks of white supremacy; for one of
the strongest universities to purposefully
stand on the side of the black man is little
more than a stab in the Silent Majority's
back.
Kenneth Pitzer is to be applauded for
committing Stanford's energies on the side
of essential social reform. It is the first time
since assuming Stanford's presidency a year
ago that Pitzer has converted moral
concern into direct action. Despite the fact
that the announcement and explanation of
the severance of ties with BYU were
bungled by university officials, there is no
reason that the new policy should not be
upheld by the trustees at their January
meeting.
The weight of this university should
rightfully stand firmly behind efforts to
cure our society of the ills that threaten to
tear it apart. In fact, moral suasion through
positive action should be extended to
efforts by the university community to end
American militaristic activities abroad and
to help in the solution of the spiraling
problems of our environment.
The university's voice is a powerful one.
As the mainstream of American opinion
and values held on campus continue to
drift farther apart, it is imperative that
America's great institutions of learning
speak with unfaltering voices of the new
directions for society for the upcoming
decade.
