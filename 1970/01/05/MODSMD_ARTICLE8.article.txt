Editor's Note—The Daily has
received a number of letters about
President Pitzer's decision to not
schedule athletic contests v. ith
schools sponsored by the Mormon
Church, because of the church's
doctrine concerning blacks. Below
are a selection.
Editor, THE DAILY,
This letter is an attempt to
make a grateful acknowledgement
to Stanford's action of severing
relations with Brigham Young
University. I am one student at
BYU (and believe me, there are in
actuality many more than one)
who is grateful for the move. You
may have heard that BYU is
"up-in-arms" over the move,
certainly most of it is. However
there are those here who

recognize that even though such
moves are negative, they are the
only pressures which will bring
meaningful and significant
changes to the attitudes of our
students and policies of our
institution.
This minority I speak of has no
way, other than letters such as I
write, to make their views known
to more than a few handfuls of
people. This year one of our last
channels was closed by screening
of "Letters to the Editor" in our
daily student paper. Also you
should realize that the
administrative structure here has
made internal alternations of the
institution, from students and
faculty, virtually, if not
completely, impossible.
Our foremost hope has now
turned to external sources of
pressure, such as Stanford's
action, the protest of the 14 black
football players at the University
of Wyoming, and other such
moves. The purpose of this
writing, then, is to support your
University's action and express
the hope that others investigate
this issue and follow suit.

Kenneth Pitzer.)
Dear Dr. Pitzer:
I read with great interest your
lucid statement on Stanford
policy as regards scheduling events
with discriminating institutions.
Any alumunus reading it should
well appreciate the direction the
University may take during your
administration.
Now that you have struck this
courageous blow against
discrimination, there are a few
other blots on the University's
athletic calendar that need
erasing. Two Los Angeles
institutions have been allowed to
compete against Stanford for
years in spite of the fact that one,
the University of Southern
California, was affiliated with, and
sponsored by, the Methodist
Church, which practices racial
discrimination to the extent of
having a totally segregated
denomination known as the
African Methodist Episcopal
Church. The other offender is the
University of California at Los
Angeles, whose admissions
director has a publicly announced
policy of admitting less qualified
members of certain "races," while
turning away fully qualified
applicants of different national
origin! The immediate cessation
of all relations with these two
institutions will remove any
suspicion that you are
discriminating in your
an ti-discrimination.
As other institutions clamor to
fill all the new gaps in the Big Red
schedules they can be checked for
purity, and only those up to our
standards allowed on the
schedule. With the tool you have
developed here we can reform a
large segment of society —it is only
surprising no one has done it
sooner. Think what Luther, or
Torquemada, might have
accomplished in Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor's job!
Knowing that you will be
undeterred by those who think of
a university as a disseminator of
useful knowledge rather than an
instrument of religious reform and

social improvement through
selective athletic scheduling,
Indiscriminately yours,

(Editor's note: the following
letter was sent to W. Parmer
Fuller, chairman of the Board of
Trustees.)
Dear Mr. Fuller,
I am writing to express my
sincere approval of the stand
taken by President Pitzer
regarding Stanford's association
with Brigham Young University.
Having grown up in a
predominately Mormon family in
Salt Lake City, I am only sorry
the stand wasn't taken ten years
sooner.
There is little if any doubt in
the minds of most Mormons that
the "spirit", if not the "letter" of
Mormon law discriminates against
blacks holding the priesthood.
I am appalled at President
Wilkinson's attempts to apply
pressure upon persons associated
with the Trustees at Stanford and
dismayed at the flimsy logic he

attempts to apply to the situation.
Surely the Catholics, Jews, and
Protestants have inequities in their
religious doctrines regarding birth
control, celebacy, and the role of
women, as do the Mormons as
well—however, this is, for the
moment, totally irrelevant! The
point is the Supreme Court of the
United States has finally declared
discrimination on the basis of race
illegal. For this reason the
decision to sever ties with BYU is
an important affirmation of faith
in the Civil Rights Movement, not
an attempt to pass judgment on
the tenets or the Mormon Church
or any other one.
The Mormon Church has
always been capable of changing
or adapting policies as the times
changed and as the need arose,
and I am confident they will
modify or clarify beyond any
doubt their qualifications for
holding the priesthood—responsi
bly, and without the dogmatic
and threatening gestures of
President Wilkinson.

received a number of letters about
President Pitzer's decision to not
schedule athletic contests v. ith
schools sponsored by the Mormon
Church, because of the church's
doctrine concerning blacks. Below
are a selection.
Editor, THE DAILY,
This letter is an attempt to
make a grateful acknowledgement
to Stanford's action of severing
relations with Brigham Young
University. I am one student at
BYU (and believe me, there are in
actuality many more than one)
who is grateful for the move. You
may have heard that BYU is
"up-in-arms" over the move,
certainly most of it is. However
there are those here who

recognize that even though such
moves are negative, they are the
only pressures which will bring
meaningful and significant
changes to the attitudes of our
students and policies of our
institution.
This minority I speak of has no
way, other than letters such as I
write, to make their views known
to more than a few handfuls of
people. This year one of our last
channels was closed by screening
of "Letters to the Editor" in our
daily student paper. Also you
should realize that the
administrative structure here has
made internal alternations of the
institution, from students and
faculty, virtually, if not
completely, impossible.
Our foremost hope has now
turned to external sources of
pressure, such as Stanford's
action, the protest of the 14 black
football players at the University
of Wyoming, and other such
moves. The purpose of this
writing, then, is to support your
University's action and express
the hope that others investigate
this issue and follow suit.

Kenneth Pitzer.)
Dear Dr. Pitzer:
I read with great interest your
lucid statement on Stanford
policy as regards scheduling events
with discriminating institutions.
Any alumunus reading it should
well appreciate the direction the
University may take during your
administration.
Now that you have struck this
courageous blow against
discrimination, there are a few
other blots on the University's
athletic calendar that need
erasing. Two Los Angeles
institutions have been allowed to
compete against Stanford for
years in spite of the fact that one,
the University of Southern
California, was affiliated with, and
sponsored by, the Methodist
Church, which practices racial
discrimination to the extent of
having a totally segregated
denomination known as the
African Methodist Episcopal
Church. The other offender is the
University of California at Los
Angeles, whose admissions
director has a publicly announced
policy of admitting less qualified
members of certain "races," while
turning away fully qualified
applicants of different national
origin! The immediate cessation
of all relations with these two
institutions will remove any
suspicion that you are
discriminating in your
an ti-discrimination.
As other institutions clamor to
fill all the new gaps in the Big Red
schedules they can be checked for
purity, and only those up to our
standards allowed on the
schedule. With the tool you have
developed here we can reform a
large segment of society —it is only
surprising no one has done it
sooner. Think what Luther, or
Torquemada, might have
accomplished in Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor's job!
Knowing that you will be
undeterred by those who think of
a university as a disseminator of
useful knowledge rather than an
instrument of religious reform and

social improvement through
selective athletic scheduling,
Indiscriminately yours,

(Editor's note: the following
letter was sent to W. Parmer
Fuller, chairman of the Board of
Trustees.)
Dear Mr. Fuller,
I am writing to express my
sincere approval of the stand
taken by President Pitzer
regarding Stanford's association
with Brigham Young University.
Having grown up in a
predominately Mormon family in
Salt Lake City, I am only sorry
the stand wasn't taken ten years
sooner.
There is little if any doubt in
the minds of most Mormons that
the "spirit", if not the "letter" of
Mormon law discriminates against
blacks holding the priesthood.
I am appalled at President
Wilkinson's attempts to apply
pressure upon persons associated
with the Trustees at Stanford and
dismayed at the flimsy logic he

attempts to apply to the situation.
Surely the Catholics, Jews, and
Protestants have inequities in their
religious doctrines regarding birth
control, celebacy, and the role of
women, as do the Mormons as
well—however, this is, for the
moment, totally irrelevant! The
point is the Supreme Court of the
United States has finally declared
discrimination on the basis of race
illegal. For this reason the
decision to sever ties with BYU is
an important affirmation of faith
in the Civil Rights Movement, not
an attempt to pass judgment on
the tenets or the Mormon Church
or any other one.
The Mormon Church has
always been capable of changing
or adapting policies as the times
changed and as the need arose,
and I am confident they will
modify or clarify beyond any
doubt their qualifications for
holding the priesthood—responsi
bly, and without the dogmatic
and threatening gestures of
President Wilkinson.

Editor's Note—The Daily has
received a number of letters about
President Pitzer's decision to not
schedule athletic contests v. ith
schools sponsored by the Mormon
Church, because of the church's
doctrine concerning blacks. Below
are a selection.
Editor, THE DAILY,
This letter is an attempt to
make a grateful acknowledgement
to Stanford's action of severing
relations with Brigham Young
University. I am one student at
BYU (and believe me, there are in
actuality many more than one)
who is grateful for the move. You
may have heard that BYU is
"up-in-arms" over the move,
certainly most of it is. However
there are those here who

recognize that even though such
moves are negative, they are the
only pressures which will bring
meaningful and significant
changes to the attitudes of our
students and policies of our
institution.
This minority I speak of has no
way, other than letters such as I
write, to make their views known
to more than a few handfuls of
people. This year one of our last
channels was closed by screening
of "Letters to the Editor" in our
daily student paper. Also you
should realize that the
administrative structure here has
made internal alternations of the
institution, from students and
faculty, virtually, if not
completely, impossible.
Our foremost hope has now
turned to external sources of
pressure, such as Stanford's
action, the protest of the 14 black
football players at the University
of Wyoming, and other such
moves. The purpose of this
writing, then, is to support your
University's action and express
the hope that others investigate
this issue and follow suit.

Kenneth Pitzer.)
Dear Dr. Pitzer:
I read with great interest your
lucid statement on Stanford
policy as regards scheduling events
with discriminating institutions.
Any alumunus reading it should
well appreciate the direction the
University may take during your
administration.
Now that you have struck this
courageous blow against
discrimination, there are a few
other blots on the University's
athletic calendar that need
erasing. Two Los Angeles
institutions have been allowed to
compete against Stanford for
years in spite of the fact that one,
the University of Southern
California, was affiliated with, and
sponsored by, the Methodist
Church, which practices racial
discrimination to the extent of
having a totally segregated
denomination known as the
African Methodist Episcopal
Church. The other offender is the
University of California at Los
Angeles, whose admissions
director has a publicly announced
policy of admitting less qualified
members of certain "races," while
turning away fully qualified
applicants of different national
origin! The immediate cessation
of all relations with these two
institutions will remove any
suspicion that you are
discriminating in your
an ti-discrimination.
As other institutions clamor to
fill all the new gaps in the Big Red
schedules they can be checked for
purity, and only those up to our
standards allowed on the
schedule. With the tool you have
developed here we can reform a
large segment of society —it is only
surprising no one has done it
sooner. Think what Luther, or
Torquemada, might have
accomplished in Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor's job!
Knowing that you will be
undeterred by those who think of
a university as a disseminator of
useful knowledge rather than an
instrument of religious reform and

social improvement through
selective athletic scheduling,
Indiscriminately yours,

(Editor's note: the following
letter was sent to W. Parmer
Fuller, chairman of the Board of
Trustees.)
Dear Mr. Fuller,
I am writing to express my
sincere approval of the stand
taken by President Pitzer
regarding Stanford's association
with Brigham Young University.
Having grown up in a
predominately Mormon family in
Salt Lake City, I am only sorry
the stand wasn't taken ten years
sooner.
There is little if any doubt in
the minds of most Mormons that
the "spirit", if not the "letter" of
Mormon law discriminates against
blacks holding the priesthood.
I am appalled at President
Wilkinson's attempts to apply
pressure upon persons associated
with the Trustees at Stanford and
dismayed at the flimsy logic he

attempts to apply to the situation.
Surely the Catholics, Jews, and
Protestants have inequities in their
religious doctrines regarding birth
control, celebacy, and the role of
women, as do the Mormons as
well—however, this is, for the
moment, totally irrelevant! The
point is the Supreme Court of the
United States has finally declared
discrimination on the basis of race
illegal. For this reason the
decision to sever ties with BYU is
an important affirmation of faith
in the Civil Rights Movement, not
an attempt to pass judgment on
the tenets or the Mormon Church
or any other one.
The Mormon Church has
always been capable of changing
