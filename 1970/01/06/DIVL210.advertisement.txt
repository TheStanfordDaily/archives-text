Take a
business man
to lunch
and talk Peace. The businessman
might be your father; or somebody
trying to recruit you.
Men of B.E.M. have marched side
by side with you in Washington,
in San Francisco.
We have been outspoken and direct:
"Stop it. Now."
We need more business executives
to amplify our voices —yours and ours.
Help us recruit. Why not
give this coupon to a 112 I
businessman? Help him
fill it out. It takes guts.
We know.
