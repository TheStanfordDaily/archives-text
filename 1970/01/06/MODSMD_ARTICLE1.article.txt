# Council Member Askinas Relinquishes ASSU Duties
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Barry Askinas, one of the four
members of the Associated
Students' Council of Presidents,
has virtually resigned his position
as a part of the ASSU executive.
Askinas decided in mid-fall
quarter that the increased and
conflicting pressures of his
commitments—to his doctoral
dissertation, to his jobs as a
residence tutor, and teaching
assistant—were severely draining
his effectiveness as a member of
the ASSU executive.

"1 was unrealistic in terms of
my expectations as to how much
energy was required in the
functions of a student body
president and a doctoral student.
There were too many things,"
Askinas said.
Other members of the ASSU
executive, however, refused to
accept Askinas' resignation last
fall. According to Askinas, they
felt that, even if he served in a
drastically limited role, he would
be making a significant
contribution to student
government. On the request of Pat
Shea, Askinas' colleague, the
Daily refrained from printing
Askinas' decision to resign at the
time. Askinas modified his plans,
agreeing to stay and work on
'long-term projects' for an
indefinite time.
"Nothing has changed since six
weeks ago," Askinas said last
night. He has relinquished all but
minimal duties in the ASSU
office, but is still regarded as a
member of the Council of
Presidents.
Askinas Disenchanted
Clarifying his reasons for
resigning, Askinas cited his
disenchantment with the
.mystique and power of student
politics. "The student government
has many functions, and only one
of these is the political function,"
Askinas said.
"There are also executive,
representative, organizational and
innovative duties," he added. "If
the Council of Presidents has
made any contribution to the

University, it's because these
other areas have been taken care
of."
Last year, Askinas served as
chairman of the Graduate
Students' Association, a position
which he feels he had a greater
impact than his present post. "I
could concentrate on issues then,"
he said. "I didn't have to spend
my time making symbolic
committee appearances."
"Being one Student Body
President wasn't substantive. It's
really symbolic crap," he said.
Naive About Position
"I was naive about the position
when I took it. I found I could
only accomplish limited things.
Accomplishments come through
ideas and action, but the
intellectual part is the most
important. I've been active for the
last two years, and I want to get
back to ideas."
Askinas added that another
galling part of his position as an
ASSU president was the necessity
of his counter-balancing Pat
Shea's political functions. He
explained that Shea was looked to
for communication between the
student executive and other
sectors of the University;
therefore, the voices of the
quieter presidents were drowned
out.
"John and Joyce work awfully
hard at things which don't seem
to grab the headlines. If we've
accomplished anything this year,
it's a result of what everybody's
done," he said.
When the Council of Presidents

was introduced last Spring as a
slate for the Student Body
President elections, each member
had a specified function.
Executive Functions
Joyce Kobayashi is responsible
for special projects, such as the
SWOPSI program and the new
student center.
John Grube's responsibility's
centered around the executive
functions of the office and work
with various University
committees. Askinas' was to work
with the problems of graduate
students and of housing, and
Shea's responsibility was
communicating with various
sectors of the University.
Before his election as a
member of the student executive,
Askinas helped to found the local
American Federation of Teachers
union of working graduate
students. He also served as
member of the University
Advisory Committee, and was a
member of the Steering
Committee of the Student
Education Council.
Askinas' interests in graduate
students and in housing have
borne fruit in the form of several
concrete accomplishments. He
was instrumental last year in
ensuring both the construction of
temporary housing for 500
students in Manzanita Park and
the plans for enlarged graduate
housing in Escondido Village.
In response to Askinas'
prodding, Stanford now actively
recruits minority students for
graduate study.
