# A 						Second Look
## Is BYU Stand 'Justified'? 
### Reed Watkins 
I was both disturbed and
saddened to learn of Dr. Pitzer's
new policy toward Brigham
Young University. It was not
stated whether this represented
the position of the Stanford
faculty, the students, or whether
it was merely Dr. Pitzer's ex parte
interpretation of the Human
Relations' Creed. In any event,
one is led to conclude it
represents a fairly sizable
viewpoint at Stanford, otherwise
it would not be an officially
stated position of the University.
Some may believe Stanford,
through Dr. Pitzer, has taken a
courageous stand on behalf of
"civil rights." In my opinion its a
reactionary and compromising
stand, and creates more
discrimination than it can hope to
eliminate. It represents an
unfeeling and insensitive approach
to a religious group whose
humanity and accomplishments
would be stamped out and
forgotten because of negative
reaction to a particular theological
dogma.
Historically, the Mormon
church, whose beginning was in
the early 180()'s, stood for
abolition of slavery and reparation
for wrongs inflicted upon the
black race. In Bringham Young's
first wagon train of Mormon
settlers into the Salt Lake Valley
in 1847 were one or two free
negroes, who enjoyed every
privilege, civil and otherwise,
granted the whites except
officiating in "priesthood"
functions, and which, apparently
from the record, was not
important to them.
I'm not justifying the
theological position of the
Mormon church in denying its
priesthood to Negroes. To many
there is no justification. However,
doctrines in the LDS church are
not changed by popular vote of its
members. Theologically speaking,
its doctrine is considered as having
been revealed of Clod and can
only be changed by further
revelation from God through the
President of the church, who is

accepted by the people as a
prophet, seer and revelator, the
same as Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah of
Old Testament times and Peter,
James, John, Paul, etc., of the
New Testament period.
With such a theological
background it seems pointless to
discriminate against Brigham
Young University. Its students
and faculty can't change the
theology of the LDS church.
Many possibly aren't concerned
with the issue. A fairly sizable
minority are not LDS.
The logic of Stanford's
position would seem to require
discrimination beyond merely a
church supported university. The
church supports a seminary
system in connection with all
schools where there is any of the
Mormon community. There is an
institute or seminary for LDS
students attending Stanford.
Where does the boycott stop?
What about business firms owned
or operated by LDS members?
Are they to renounce their faith?
Will Stanford over a period of
time eliminate LDS students from
its student body? And faculty?
Will the LDS people become the
"Jews" of the late 20th Century?
The LDS have experienced
substantial persecution and were a
persecuted minority until very
recent times.
And what about Stanford's
basic position? Is it justified? Is
the discrimination practiced by
the LDS church "different"
because based on "color" from
the discrimination now
announced by Stanford which is
based on "creed' '? Far better, in
my judgment, for Stanford to
announce disagreement with the
LDS theological position, but in
effect say we will try to win over
these error-prone people by
persuasion and love. The zealot
often falls into the very pit he
tries to eliminate. In my opinion
this has happened to a great
university, which my human
instinct tells me is now not as
great as it once was. Human
instinct also calls upon me to

re-evaluate my loyalty to Stanford
as an institution. At least in the
eyes of several of my
non-Stanford friends the lustre of
a Stanford education is severely
tarnished. Thus a chain reaction is
created defeating the very
objective Dr. Pitzer likely sought
to achieve.
Utah has held Stanford in high
regard. Many of Utah's most
promising students have chosen to
attend Stanford. The writer, I'm
sure, wants Utah's citizenry to
maintain this regard but quite
obviously feels Dr. Pitzer's stand
has penetrated deeply in an
adverse way. Utah is still
predominately LDS'
Being more philosophical than
religious by nature, hut at the
same time maintaining a strong
allegiance to the LDS church, I
hope my support of Stanford will
not diminish. I intend to maintain
loyalty in spite of what I consider
a substantial error dialectically
and tactically by Dr. Pitzer. I,
with many others (probably a
minority in the church at present)
would be most pleased if LDS
theology permitted Negroes to
hold the priesthood. I can
understand the viewpoint of those
who would like to eliminate this
discriminating doctrine. LDS
theology further states that at
some date the priesthood will be
extended to Negroes. But at the
same time the LDS church has a
great tradition in bearing
opposition and withstanding
persecution. I fear many will
interpret Stanford's action as
"expected" persecution and
become further entrenched in
their views.
In summary, I believe a more
considered and penetrating
analysis by Dr. Pitzer might have
produced a more sensitive
approach, avoided the alienation
of a substantial number of people
needlessly, and likely
accomplished more of his
long-range objectives.
