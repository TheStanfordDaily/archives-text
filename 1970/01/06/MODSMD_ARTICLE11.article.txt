# Stanford's Dilemma
## Ecology Begins At Home 
### Michael Sweeney 
The professor turned and gazed
out the window at the
smog-rimmed sky as he answered
the question.
"Yes, I agree that it would be
nice if the University stopped
developing its lands," he said,
"but we need the money."
His attitude was entirely
honest. It was based on the
sincere belief that the University
must, above all, preserve itself so
it can help society indirectly by
providing fresh ideas, technology,
and trained students. If tbe
University is messing up the
environment in its efforts to earn
money, well, that's just a price we
have to pay.
The University Relations office
has said the same thing in a recent
publication: "By developing a
portion of its land, Stanford is
strengthening resources that can
be used to attack many modern
social problems, both directly
and indirectly. It may add to local
problems in doing so."

Unfortunately, the explosive
pace of development has made
this attitude as outmoded and
potentially dangerous as the
internal combustion engine. The
environmental crisis is overtaking
Stanford. The costs of
overdevelopment and crowding
must now be weighed against the
dollars that the University hopes
to earn from leasing out its vacant
land.
Item: "Scientists at Stanford
University's Hopkins Marine
Station at Pacific Grove are
expressing alarm at the growing
pollution around their research
facilities on Monterey Bay."
Concentrations of DDT are
making some experiments
impossible.
Item: The University's huge
antennas and radio receivers on
the foothills behind campus are
getting more and more
interference from traffic on
nearby roads.
Item: Stanford is having

difficulty in hiring blacks and
chicanos to meet is minority
employment quotas because these
people can't find decent places to
live near campus.
Item: Scientists have calculated
that the Bay Area inversion basin
will run out of sufficient oxygen
for its population if we continue
the rate of development that
brings in more traffic, industry
and people, while it destroys
greenery and fills in the Bay.
Survival is now. Even Richard
Nixon says so. In fact, it
sometimes seems that the ruling
class is trying to drown us in sea
of sympathetic moans and groans
about pollution and the
population bomb. But actions
belie their words. As the
government bemoans water
pollution, it renews the Union Oil
leases in the Santa Barbara
channel. As Nixon laments the
housing shortage, he continues the
Vietnam War which has driven
interest rates so high that nobody
can borrow money to build more
housing.
And at Stanford, the
University proudly calls attention
to the excellent research work on
pollution and ecology by its
professors. Yet it goes ahead full
speed with the Coyote Hill and
Dillingham developments, which
will bring 4,500 to 6,500 more
employees to the crowded
midpeninsula, along with about
18 tons per day of air pollutants
from their autos.
Similarly, the University has
made a big fanfare over its plans
to build some low and moderate
income housing to help ease the

local housing crisis. It is a step in
the right direction for Stanford,
of course, since the land
development program has brought
17,000 workers to the area
without providing any housing for
them to live in. But it seems
somewhat hypocritical for the
University to imply that it is
helping solve the housing shortage
while it goes ahead with industrial
development that will add 4,500
to 6,500 more house-hunters to
the hectic housing market.
These numbers and statistics
don't tell the whole story of
Stanford's impact on the
midpeninsula. Overcrowding and
smog affect poor people more
than rich people, just like all this
country's problems. The Stanford
trustees and administrators can
live high in the foothills, above
the smog and beyond the blight of
the freeways. Low-paid workers,
at Stanford and throughout the
midpeninsula, are forced to live
far away from their jobs. Their
commute is longer, their rents are
proportionally higher, and the air
they breathe is fouler. But
low-income workers have had
absolutely no say in the decisions
Stanford makes about how it will
use its land.
If Stanford is to begin using its
land in the interests of the people
in the community, then those
people must begin to make the
decisions about how the land
should be used. It's in this spirit
that the new organization, Grass
Roots, will sponsor a forum
tomorrow night on "Stanford's
Land and the Crisis in the
Midpeninsula Environment."
