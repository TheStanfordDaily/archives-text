# Free University: Alive And Growing
## 
### 
Stanford, which has developed
such venerated American
institutions as SRI,
Hewlett-Packard, a still growing
industrial park, Hoover Tower,
and other pillars of the corporate
faith, also has unconventional
children, the Midpeninsula Free
University being one of the best
known examples.
What then of the Free
University Winter Season
Catalogue, adorned with stars and
stripes, and printed red, white,
and blue? Have the radicals sold
out and become flag wavers? No,
instead the current catalogue
appears to be an irreverent tribute
to Bob Cullenbine, recently
retired coordinator of the Free
University, who was busted last
Spring for allegedly displaying a
defaced American flag at the Free

University headquarters in Menlo
Park.
Cullenbine's arrest was only
one of a number of attacks upon
the Free University last year.
They were bombed several times
by an ultra-rightest terror group,
plans for a community center fell
through when downtown Palo
Alto businessmen refused to rent
them a building, and the city
council passed new laws designed
to end their Be-ins in El Camino
Park.
Much of the Free University's
energy went into defending
themselves, resulting in several
disappointing catalogues and a
drop in membership. This trend
appears to have reversed itself
with the current winter catalogue.
There are over 220 courses to
choose from, a large increase over
this past fall.


FREE U—The Midpeninsula Free University, alter a year of harassment from
many sides, is attempting a bold comeback with a colorful and expanded Winter
Season Catalogue. The catalogue offers over 220 courses ranging from
candlemaking to Yoga astrology.
