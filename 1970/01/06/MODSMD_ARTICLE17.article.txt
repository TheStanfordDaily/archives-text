# Coyote Hill
## Development Plans Endorsed 
### 
Development of land around
Coyote Hill in the southeastern
corner of the Stanford campus
should proceed according to
present plans, a comprehensive
Palo Alto foothill environmental
design study has recommended.
The finding upholds steps
already taken by the city and the
University, and runs counter to
requests by area conservation
groups that the land be used for
other purposes or be left
undeveloped.
Endorsement of plans for the
area comes from Livingston and
Blayney, a San Francisco city and
regional planning firm. The
organization is conducting a
two-year study for the city of
Palo Alto.
"No change" should be made
in the plans for the Stanford lands
already zoned LM-5 (limited
manufacturing, five-acre minimum
lots) and A-R (administrative
research), the city was advised.
Lands around Coyote Hill are
so designated, and have been
divided into 12 lots for industrial

park use. The top 37 acres of the
Hill itself were placed in the
University's Academic Reserve in
1968 and will not be developed
commercially.
Deer Creek G*ch, which
threads from Arasiradero Road
and along the western flank of the
Hill to Foothill Expressway,
should be left as "permanent open
space," Livingston and Blayney
recommend. This also is in
accordance with University plans;
an 18-hole public golf course is
being designed to follow the
Gulch, leaving the Creek in a
natural state.
Lands west of the Gulch and
north of a new road between
Arastradero and Page Mill Roads
should be given over to research
and development and
professional-administrative
offices, or to residential
development, the report states.
This is one of the sites Stanford is
considering for a low-income
housing project on the campus.
The University has no plans in
the near future for the
development of a hilly

undeveloped area south of the
new road.
Stanford has leased 940 of its
8800 acres in the past 20 years,
while placing 5200 acres in the
Academic Reserve, where most of
the land remains open or is lightly
used. The land development
program earns unrestricted funds
for education, offsets annual taxes
of $835,000 on lands not in
academic use, and retains
property for future educational
needs by way of long-term leases.
The Coyote Hill area was
zoned for industrial park
development in 1960, and the
zoning was reaffirmed in 1967.
Provisions for roads and city
water lines were made several
years ago, and roads north and
south of the Hill were built last
summer at a cost of $1.2 million
to the University. The city last fall
approved lot division and
subdivision plans for the property.
Building construction has begun
on one lot, and other firms have
expended over $100,000 in
planning their facilities.
In recent months, student and

off-campus organizations have
suggested many uses of the
property, ranging from a
moratorium on all development to
such purposes as some industrial
park uses, town houses, single
family residences, the golf course,
and a public park.
The City Planning Commission
and City Council, and the
Stanford Faculty Advisory
Committee on Land and Building
Development, last fall rejected a
moratorium on development
because of the numerous
authorizations that had been given
to the University and the
commitments that had been
made.
In November a suit was served
against the University and the
City by the Committee for Green
Foothills which charges
procedural irregularities in the
subdivision of the land and
cpnflicts of interest on the part of
two City Council members. The
University contends that it has
followed proper procedures and
will contest the suit.

This is one of the sites Stanford is
considering for a low-income
housing project on the campus.
The University has no plans in
the near future for the
development of a hilly

undeveloped area south of the
new road.
Stanford has leased 940 of its
8800 acres in the past 20 years,
while placing 5200 acres in the
Academic Reserve, where most of
the land remains open or is lightly
used. The land development
program earns unrestricted funds
for education, offsets annual taxes
of $835,000 on lands not in
academic use, and retains
property for future educational
needs by way of long-term leases.
The Coyote Hill area was
zoned for industrial park
development in 1960, and the
zoning was reaffirmed in 1967.
Provisions for roads and city
water lines were made several
years ago, and roads north and
south of the Hill were built last
summer at a cost of $1.2 million
to the University. The city last fall
approved lot division and
subdivision plans for the property.
Building construction has begun
on one lot, and other firms have
expended over $100,000 in
planning their facilities.
In recent months, student and

off-campus organizations have
suggested many uses of the
property, ranging from a
moratorium on all development to
such purposes as some industrial
park uses, town houses, single
family residences, the golf course,
and a public park.
The City Planning Commission
and City Council, and the
Stanford Faculty Advisory
Committee on Land and Building
Development, last fall rejected a
moratorium on development
because of the numerous
authorizations that had been given
to the University and the
commitments that had been
made.
In November a suit was served
against the University and the
City by the Committee for Green
Foothills which charges
procedural irregularities in the
subdivision of the land and
cpnflicts of interest on the part of
two City Council members. The
University contends that it has
followed proper procedures and
will contest the suit.
Development of land around
Coyote Hill in the southeastern
corner of the Stanford campus
should proceed according to
present plans, a comprehensive
Palo Alto foothill environmental
design study has recommended.
The finding upholds steps
already taken by the city and the
University, and runs counter to
requests by area conservation
groups that the land be used for
other purposes or be left
undeveloped.
Endorsement of plans for the
area comes from Livingston and
Blayney, a San Francisco city and
regional planning firm. The
organization is conducting a
two-year study for the city of
Palo Alto.
"No change" should be made
in the plans for the Stanford lands
already zoned LM-5 (limited
manufacturing, five-acre minimum
lots) and A-R (administrative
research), the city was advised.
Lands around Coyote Hill are
so designated, and have been
divided into 12 lots for industrial

park use. The top 37 acres of the
Hill itself were placed in the
University's Academic Reserve in
1968 and will not be developed
commercially.
Deer Creek G*ch, which
threads from Arasiradero Road
and along the western flank of the
Hill to Foothill Expressway,
should be left as "permanent open
space," Livingston and Blayney
recommend. This also is in
accordance with University plans;
an 18-hole public golf course is
being designed to follow the
Gulch, leaving the Creek in a
natural state.
Lands west of the Gulch and
north of a new road between
Arastradero and Page Mill Roads
should be given over to research
and development and
professional-administrative
offices, or to residential
development, the report states.
