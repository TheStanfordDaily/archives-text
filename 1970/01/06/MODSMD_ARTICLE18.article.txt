# Sapir Guilty In SRI Trial
## 
### 
Stanford medical student Marc
Sapir was found guilty yesterday
of two misdemeanor charges
arising from the May 16 Stanford
Research Institute (SRI)
demonstrations.
Judge William Ingram handed
down the decision after reviewing
the transcript of Sapir's earlier
trial which had resulted in a hung
jury. At his first trial in
September, Sapir conducted his
own defense.
Sentencing on the charges of
unlawful assembly and blocking a
public street was postponed until
January 14. Each of the violations
carries a maximum penalty of six
months in jail and a $500 fine.
Sapir was one of about 100
persons, arrested after the SRI
demonstrations. Most of those
charged are Stanford students
who are still awaiting trial.
In a similar December trial
Stanford junior John Shoch was
acquited of charges of assault and
battery. In that trial former
Stanford student Mike Vawter
and his wife Jan were found guilty
of assault.
In related court action Shoch
and five other members of a
barricade group made deals with
Judge Edward Scoyen and the
district attorney's office, and

agreed to plead guilty to charges
of unlawful assembly.
The guilty pleas were entered
by Shoch, fellow Stanford
students Robert Bows, Lucy
Wieland, Kathleen Boswell and
Terry Karl; and nonstudent Larry
Christiani.
In return for the guilty plea,
the district attorney's office
agreed to drop charges of
obstructing traffic, inciting to
riot, disturbing the peace, and
failure to disperse against each of
the defendants.
According to a defense
spokesman the deals were made
because of purely financial
considerations. The expenses of
research and trial costs, attorneys
and court fees, etc. made the deal
the most economically feasible
solution from either defense or
prosecution point of view.
However, one defendant
reported that the deal involved
complicated technical legal
arrangements which went far
beyond the scope of financial
considerations.
Meanwhile several other
defendants are also considering
the possibility of making deals
and pleading guilty rather than
going through the trial procedure.
More action in this area will be
taken in meetings later this week.
