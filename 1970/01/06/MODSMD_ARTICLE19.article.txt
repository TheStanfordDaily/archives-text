# Student Center Asks Educational Change
## 
### 
Experimentation in education,
directed reading, and new course
possibilities will be encouraged
under a new Student Center
recently founded.
The Student Center for
Innovation in Research and
Education will help students
contact faculty and other
members of the campus
community for research on
problems of mutual interest, allow
students to experiment with
subject matter which is not of
traditional academic interest, and
encourage students to examine
existing University policies,
programs, and proceduresâ€”an
"institutional introspection."
The Student Center will be
discussed by the Faculty Senate
Thursday and will consider giving
the Center power to award
academic credit.
Plans for the Center have been
developed over the past several
months by Joyce Kobayashi and

other members of the Associated
Students Council of Presidents in
collaboration with Bruce
Campbell, a recent graduate,
Profs. Merill Carlsmith, Mark
Mancall, and Bob Maddix, who
were selected this fall as
University Fellows.
The Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, a
faculty-student group, has
unanimously endorsed their
proposal that the Center's policy
be set by six students and five
faculty.
All policy board decisions
involving academic credit would
require a two-thirds majority,
including at least one student and
one faculty member. All work for
credit would require evaluation by
an individual holding a regular or
a temporary faculty appointment.
Votes of the 11-man Policy
Board on matters of academic
credit would be subject to review
by CUS, but it is hoped that the
board would be virtually
autonomous.
The University Fellows, a small
group of talented young faculty
members, have authorized
$20,000 from their Innovation
Fund to finance the first year of
the Center.
The 11-man policy board
would present an interim progress
report to the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies by the end
of spring quarter. CUS would have
power to terminate the
experimental project.
Individuals serving on the
Associated Students Council of
Presidents ran on an education
reform platform last spring.
