# On Development Policy
## Committee Questions Officials 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
The University's re-evaluation
of its land use policies got
underway yesterday with some
hard questioning by a
faculty-student committee.
In explaining to members of
the Land and Building
Development committee the
future plans for 30 new campus
buildings and improvements,
Vice-Provost Howard Brooks
acknowledged that "technically
this committee can review any
decision made by the Planning
Office."
The meeting was first in a
series of special briefings with
University administrators designed
to acquaint committee members
more fully with policy-making by
Stanford's Business and Planning
Offices.
The meeting also comes at a
time when student interest and
participation in land use issues is
growing, evidenced by the
formation of a new group, Grass
Roots, which plans to actively
protest the construction of the
Dillingham office-hotel complex
soon to be built on Stanford land.
The first briefing concerned
the five-year plan for academic
buildings. The next briefing, will
focus on land development in the
Industrial Park.
Planning Office Pamphlet
Brooks discussed a Planning
Office pamphlet outlining a

"Major Facilities Program" which
includes 30 projects ranging from
office remodeling to a $20 million
addition to the Main Library. He
stressed the difficulty in deciding
construction priorities and
commented "it's always a political
decision."
With many different
departments and projects
competing for University
resources, Brooks pointed out,
any decision is bound to upset
other groups hoping for financial
support.
Criteria used to determine
building priorities are difficult to
generalize since many
departments have unique needs
such as laboratories, computers,
or libraries.
To complicate plans further,
some projects that had expected
government financing are now left
with no way to cover construction
or maintenance costs.
Brooks cited fewer large
private contributions for building
construction and stated, "the
wave of enthusiasm for bricks and
mortor has faded."
Another problem involves the
use of restricted and unrestricted
funds in the University budget,
according to Brooks. For
example, sociology may be in
need of new office space more
than physics, but because a donor
specifies that his gift should be
limited to helping the physics

department, the University cannot
switch these restricted funds to
other uses.
Power to Review
In discussing the proposed
projects, Brooks mentioned to the
committee members that the
group could review any decisions
made by the Planning Office as
long as construction had not
started and no contracts were
signed.
Recently the committee
delayed approval of the
architectural design of the new
Education School research and
development building. The group
asked for modifications which will
be discussed at a meeting Friday.
This precedent could prove
significant in any efforts that the
committee may make in
re-directing land use. In the past
some committee members had felt
the group was too weak and
ineffectual in evaluating
University plans.
But last October President
Pitzer gave the committee a new
"charge" giving the group the
advisory power over all aspects of
the University's land policies.
Form Not Content
Committee member and
assistant professor of psychology
George A. Kaplan complained
that "it is the form and not the
content which we are asked to
approve. We are never asked

whether â€¢ a building is good to
begin with."
Kaplan asked Brooks if the
University ever planned "to
simply stop growing." Brooks
responded by listing several
assumptions that University
planners make in designing
campus buildings. First, the
student enrollment level off at
12,000 by 1975.
Secondly, the faculty will
increase by about 2 per cent per
year. By 1975, the number will
have grown by about 100 to
approximately 1100. At the
moment there is no ultimate limit
in sight.
Thirdly, the staff size will
expand by two to five per cent
each year.
In total, the campus
population could grow by as
much as 3,500 people.
Members of Grass Roots have
announced a rally next Monday
that will be held at the site of the
Dillingham project at the corner
of El Camino and Page Mill Road.
The group has protested that the
development will damage the
environment as well as worsen the
local housing shortage.
Grass Roots is also sponsoring
an educational forum tomorrow
night on "Stanford Land and the
Crisis in the Midpeninsula
Environment" at 7:30 in
Cubberley Auditorium.
