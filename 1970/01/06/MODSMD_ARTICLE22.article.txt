# Ski Holiday Awaits Snow Enthusiasts
## 
### 
Winter Carnival planning enters
the final stages of preparation
today with the last two days of
sales for the snow holiday,
January 9-11.
There is snow, and plenty of it,
on the slopes at Squaw Valley.
And Stanford ski enthusiasts,
reveled in their Christman present
of 3-5 feet of the flakey white
stuff, the only ingredient still
needed to make this year's Winter
Carnival a smashing success.
The lodging for two nights,
meals included, at Squaw's
Olympic Village has been
arranged, as have the group
discounts on lift tickets and rental
equipment.
A great band has been lined up
for the big dance and the Olympic
ice rink had been reserved for

skating and broom hockey prior
to the bash. Vicki Drake has even
given a definite "maybe" when
asked to serve as Winter Carnival
Queen.
Before Christmas, the only
thing lacking was a blanket of new
snow, and no amount of Carnival
planning seemed to help. But now
the snow has fallen, and reports
filtering back down from the
Sierra say that it is nothing short
of "great".
Tickets are on sale today and
tomorrow from 10-12 in front of
the post office for $20 to ski club
members, $23 to all others. The
price covers lodging and meals,
admission to the dance and ice
skating, and guarantees a $2 dollar
discount on lift tickets and a
discount on rental equipment.
