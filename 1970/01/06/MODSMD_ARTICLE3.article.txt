# A 						Radical Challenge To Policy

### 
Why should radicals care about
land development?
That question has arisen since
the sudden emergence of a new
activist group, calling itself the
Grass Roots. It sprang into
existence this week with the
announcement of a
demonstration, public forum, and
a barrage of leaflets and posters.
Grass Roots seems to draw on
the energies of a number of
people who have become
well-known in past radical
movements concerning the draft,
Vietnam War, and war research.
But the fledgling organization also
has members who have never
before been politically active.
Interviews with several Grass
Roots members show that the
group consists of people who
believe that the problems of
ecology, housing and the Vietnam
war are all tied to decisions about
the use of the land.
"Stanford has a lot of the only
untouched land in the area," says
Bruce Pollack, a former graduate
student who lives in Palo Alto.
"The environment is slowly but
surely being eaten up by

development which benefits
powerful real estate and financial
interests. One of our slogans is
'House People, Not Profits."
Pollack emphasizes that Grass
Roots is a community
organization, not just a Stanford
group. "It's the people of the area
who are affected by how Stanford
uses its land," he says."I want to
see Stanford land serve the people
by providing places to live near
where they work, and in
surroundings that are just as
beautiful as the ones the ruling
class gets."
Sheilah Dorsey, another Grass
Roots member, says her main
concern is "to take Santa Clara
County out of the war. The land
is being used for manufacturing. It
should be used for the people, for
housing and work that is related
to people's lives, not death."
Grass Roots has levied specific
criticisms at the upcoming
construction of a huge financial
center and hotel complex by
Dillingham Corporation at the
corner of Page Mill Road and El
Camino. A protest demonstration

has been called for Monday at the
Dillingham site.
"The Dillingham site is one of
the only available pieces of land
near downtown Palo Alto," says
Miss Dorsey. "It should be spared
becoming another office center. It
should be used either for a park or
housing."
Grass Roots has scheduled a
public forum on "Stanford's Land
and the Crisis in the Midpeninsula
Environment" for tomorrow night
at 7:30 p.m. in Cubberley.
Speakers will include Paul Rupert,
Vic VonSchlegell, and others.
Grass Roots members say th.<i
the group has no officers, but
instead will rely on democratic
decision-making to the greatest
possible extent. A coordinating
committee handles administrative
chores. Membership is open to
anyone.
"Our task is to get people
together around the land issue,"
says one member. Everybody is
uptight about it for one reason or
another â€”housing, ecology, traffic
or whatever. The people have got
to assume the power over these
things which affect their lives."
