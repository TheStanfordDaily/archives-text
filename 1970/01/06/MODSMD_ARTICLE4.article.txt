# Favorable Decision Expected Soon On Pill
## 
### 
University officials indicated
yesterday that chances for passage
of the birth control pill proposal
were good and that the new
policy might be announced as
early as next week. The proposal
would allow each physician at the
Cowell Health Center to prescribe
the pills regardless of the student's
age.
And in a move that would
officially bring liquor on campus
for the first time, the faculty club
has applied for an Alcoholic
Beverage Commission (ABC)
license to operate a bar on its
premises. The club was ordered
dry on Oct. 29 when the ABC
told the club to eliminate its
"locker system," which allowed
each professor to store his favorite
spirits on club premises. The ABC
had termed the system a "public
nuisance."
Dr. James P. McClenahan,
director of the health center, told

the Daily that no decision on the
pill proposal would be announced
before next week, contrary to
reports in the local press.
No Filial Decision
"It is still on President Pitzer's
desk," he said. "A final decision
has not been reached. The matter
is still in the deliberation stage. He
(President Pitzer) will probably
bring it up in the Board of
Trustees meeting next week. I'm
sure that the information will be
widely circulated once a decision
is reached."
Dr. McClenahan said that no
one from the Palo Alto Times,
which published the report, had
contacted him. He said that
several meetings were held to
consider the proposal last week
and that Pitzer was still sounding
out various University offices
about the proposed changes.
Since 1962, doctors at the
health center have been forbidden

to prescribe the pills for students
under 21 years of age who were
not married or were not planning
on getting married within 60 days.
Doctors at the health center have
been referring students to the
Planned Parenthood offices in
Palo Alto, creating an overload
situation there.
Notice Posted
Liquor has been officially
barred from the campus since its
creation at the request of Mrs.
Jane Stanford, who also took
steps to prevent the sale of hard
liquor in downtown Palo Alto.
Selling hard liquor in downtown
Palo Alto is still forbidden, but in
recent years both faculty club and
dormitory regulations have been
relaxed considerably.
In accordance with ABC
regulations, a 30-day notice was
posted at the club Dec. 19. If
there are no objections to the bar,
the club could receive its license
by late January or early February.
