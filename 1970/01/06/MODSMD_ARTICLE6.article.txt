# Draft Lottery Appears Less Fair Than Advertised
## 
### 
One month after the first
capsule was drawn in Washington,
the lottery and the draft continue
to be subjects of controversy in
the courts and on the campus.
Numerous suits have been filed
charging that the Selective Service
System failed to provide a random
selection in the drawings of
December 1, while the System
itself is considering further
reforms to correct abuses of the
lottery system.
While Alan Strain, Stanford
draft counselor, is uncertain of
the suits' prospects, he feels that
"it is clear that they did a sloppy
job."
He is hardly alone. At the
University of Michigan,
astronomer Dr. Fred T. Haddock
ran a statistical analysis of the
dates. He figured the average
order numbers for each month
from January to December as
201, 203, 226, 204, 208, 196,
182, 173, 157, 182, 149, and 122.
He estimated the odds against
such a progression resulting from
random selection were "100,000
to 1."
Another scientist, Berkeley's
Frank Asaro, calculated the odds
at 10,000 to 1. His odds are

determined by the exceptionally
low numbers assigned November
and December birthdates.
Adding further fuel to the
controversy is the hit and miss of
the lottery at the local level.
According to Strain, "It is quite
clear that numbers that have been
assumed to be safe are not so safe,
not just for local boards, but for
whole states."
Some local boards are finding
their pools containing few low
and many high numbers, and
whole states are finding that
Pentagon quotas may force them
to call almost all registrants.
The head of the Michigan
Selective Service system has said
that he expects that all Michigan
I-A registrants will be called,
despite their numbers. Strain
notes that his office has received
news of similar difficulties in four
other states.
In addition, local boards in
eight states have received
authorization to call up to
number 30 for the January call,
and up to 100 for the February
call.
Selective Service officials are
currently considering changes in
the methods of issuing quotas,

though no definite proposals have
yet been made.
Presently, state directors must
issue proportional quotas each
month to local boards. This may
result with some local boards
calling men with high numbers
while others are calling lower
numbers.
Consequently, the rules of
thumb for top third, middle third,
and lower third have been shunted
aside by draft counselors. What is
important now is the situation at
one's local board.
It is public information just
how far down the list a board is
calling to meet its quota. "So far,
it appears that they are
complying," indicates Strain.
As the returns on the new
system begin to come in, there are
indications of a push for more
extensive draft reform next year.
The Senate Armed Services
Committee has already planned
February hearings for proposals of
further reform. In addition, the
committee expects to probe
elimination of the draft in favor
of a volunteer army. However,
the likelihood of the draft's end
appears slim as long as the war
continues.
