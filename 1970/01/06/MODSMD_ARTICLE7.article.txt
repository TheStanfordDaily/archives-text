## U.M.W. Insurgent Murdered 
### 
CLARKSVILLE, Pa.
(AP) — Joseph A. "Jock"
Yablonski, who expressed fears
for his safety while campaigning
unsuccessfully for the presidency
of the United Mine Workers last
month, was found murdered
Monday along with his wife and
daughter.
State police said the
blood-splattered bodies were
found by Yablonski's son
Kenneth, an attorney, in the
upper rooms of the family's
colonial house in this small town
centered in the state's rich soft
coal fields. Police said they had
been dead at least three days.
Lt. Earl Wright said police had
no leads in the slaying and had
not determined a motive.
The pajama-clad body of the
59-year-old Yablonski was found
sprawled on the floor of an
upstairs bedroom. Police said the
union loader had been shot twice,
once in the back of the head and
once in the back.
The body of his wife, Margaret,
57, was found on a bed in the
same room and the daughter,
25-year-old Charlotte Joanne, was
found on a bed in an adjoining
room.
"Probably a Rifle"
Wright said both women were
also shot and their bodies caked
with blood. Investigators say they
have not determined how many
times they were shot.
Wright said the murder weapon
"was probably a rifle" because of
the size of the wounds.

Troopers said telephone lines
to the home had been cut and two
of the family's cars were found
with deflated tires.
But Wright said there was no
evidence of a struggle inside.
Door Forced
"They probably entered the
house through a basement door,"
he said. "It was forced."
Wright said Yablonski was
apparently shot as he lay in bed
and then toppled to the floor.
The murder victim used to say
that "Jock Yablonski can go
anywhere in the coal fields," an
area frequently torn by violence.
But after he was attacked and
knocked unconscious at a
campaign rally in Illinois, friends
said he became worried about his
safety.
Inquest
EDOARTOWN, Mass. (AP)-Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy testified for
two hours Monday opening a
secret inquest into the death of
Miss Mary Joe Kopechne, the
young secretary who died in
Kennedy's car last summer when
the auto plunged off a bridge into
an eight-foot-deep pond.
The 38 year old Mass.
Democrat declined to discuss the
specifics of his testimony, but
when asked about whether his
testimony parallelled his earlier
statement about Miss Kopechne's
death he replied:
"While I do not want to
characterize the testimony, I
would sav ves, substantially."

Kennedy, the first witness,
took the stand about two hours
after the inquest began and
returned after a break for lunch.
He left in midafternoon saying
that he had completed his
testimony but planned to keep
himself available in Hyannis Port
in the event that he was needed.
Kennedy won an importani
legal victory as the inquest opened
when District Court Judge James
A. Boyle ruled that he would
allow Kennedy and other
witnesses to present relevant
testimony of their own.
Kennedy's auto toppled off the
narrow, rickety bridge spanning
Poncha Pond on Chappaquiddick
last July 18 and landed bottom up
in 8 feet of water. Miss
Kopechne's body was recovered
from it about 10 hours later—at
about the same time that
Kennedy was reporting the
accident for the first time at the
Edgartown police station.
Kennedy is known to want to
prove more than anything else
that Miss Kopechne could not
have survived the mishap, even if
it had been reported immediately.
Desegratio n
JACKSON. Miss. (AP)-Eight
Mississippi school districts quietly
began total desegregation
Monday, but the full impact of
the U.S. Supreme Court's
sweeping desegregation order was
not immediately fell in many of
the 30 districts involved.

Most of the eight districts
which opened their schools
Monday limited activity to pupil
registration and orientation, but a
few started classes under the order
directed at 30 of the state's 149
districts.
Three other districts were to
begin registration Monday but
postponed it until later in the
week. Other districts under court
order are expected to open later
this week.
The new school term began
after Gov. John Bell Williams
appealed for patience and
nonviolence in a statewide
radio-television address over the
weekend. Williams noted that at
least 100 private school systems
were being established in the 30
districts. And the Mississippi
Legislature begins its sessions
Tuesday with strong support for
lawmakers to come up with a
state plan to finance the private
schools.
Where schools opened for
registration, there was general
peace and quiet.
At Columbia, where the
previously all-N eg r o and
predominantly while high schools
were merged, there were eight
white teenage pickets protesting
desegregation. But the white and
Negro student body presidents
called for unity in an appeal to
the assembled students.
