Spiritual Mentors
Editor, THE DAILY:
In reference to the article
"Ministers call Calley scapegoat,"
and to the letter of Rabbi
Axelrad, Reverends Byfield,
Nyberg, and Riley, Pastors
Herhold and Janson, Father
Quinn, and Dean Napier,
published in your December 3
issue, I hope you will give me the
opportunity to protest publicly
against the totalitarian ethics
invoked by our distinguished
spiritual mentors in their
misguided efforts to make me
atone for a sin I have not
committed.
My conviction that, had I been
placed in the My Lai situation, I
would have done my utmost to
prevent the massacre, may be
both wrong and irrelevant.
Unquestionably significant,
however, is the fact the the
reverend gentlemen want us to
confess in the name of the same
wicked notion of collective
responsibility used by the Nazis to
justify the extermination of Jews.
That the "crimes" Hitler imputed
to Jews were lies and fabrications,
is less abhorrent than the
underlying doctrine, that every
Jew was to be held accountable,
even those who, by the reckoning
of their very tormentors, had no
discernible part in the alleged
misdeeds.
I know well that a certain logic
can link, "de proche en proche,"
the most innocuous action to the
most apocalyptic consequence,
e.g., that a vote for Mr. Johnson
in 1964 may be construed ex post
facto as a contributing factor to
the My Lai massacre,
notwithstanding the fact that the
voters who made that choice
intended no such effect. But by
the strength of this logic,
everything can be seen as a remote
condition of everything else; and
by the strength of the
complementary ethics, everyone
be held accountable for every
action of everyone else. The
difficulty with this kind of ethics
is that it is self-consuming: if one
is to be responsible for everything,
one ends up by feeling responsible
for nothing; and if everyone is
equally responsible for something,
then no one is effectively
responsible for it.
A Catholic existentialist,
Gabriel Marcel, insisted some time
ago that "who loves everyone
loves no one," his point being that
love is choice, and that in the
absence of choice, there can be no
values. Mutatis mutandis, if there
is no conscious, willful choice,
there is no right and wrong, no
good and no evil. Consequently, I
may regret the foolishness of my
past action or inaction, I may
deplore the catastrophic
consequences of a shortsighted
decision; but I can feel no moral
responsibility for unforeseen
consequences I have not willed.
It is the reverend gentlemen's
failure to make distinctions
(between various kinds of
responsibility) that renders their
position unintelligible; it is their
failure to draw conclusions (from
their own premisses) that renders
it inconsequential. They assure us
that they feel they are as guilty
and as responsible as Lt. Calley.
But they fail to tell us where this
terrible feeling is going to lead
them, beyond writing an eloquent
letter to THE STANFORD
DAILY. Sure, they'll give a deeply
moving sermon to a deeply moved
audience next Sunday, send a
strongly worded telegram to
President Nixon enjoining him to
stop the war now, carry a most
comminatory placard at the next
demonstration, even insert a
cosmic full-page ad in the next
edition of The New York Times.
But if they really mean what they
say, this is far from enough: if
they share Lt. Calley's crime, then
surely they must share his
punishment too. For accomplices
to a massacre of innocents have
no business pontificating in the
pages of THE STANFORD
DAILY : infanticides belong in San

Quentin, not in the shadows of
Palm Drive.
Hence, the crucial question:
Are the reverend gentlemen
prepared to spend the rest of their
natural lives at hard labor? If they
are not, then their vigorous
breast-beating is a sham, another
instance of cheap sentimentality
and vacuous posturing, designed
essentially for the gratification of
self. In Hannah Arendt's words,
"It is quite gratifying to feel
guilty if you haven't done
anything wrong: how noble!"
Yours very sincerely,

Cafeteria Atrocities
Editor, THE DAILY
I hope that the recent shock
over the revelation that the
increase in vending machine
charges is going mainly to
Tresidder Union will create a
greater interest in the operations
of that establishment.
The Union cafeteria is run,
presumable, mainly in the
interests of students - yet do they
have any say in its operation or
any channels of communication
to voice their opinions? Consider
the following points:
1. The cafeteria appears to be
run as an autonomous arm of the
administration, without guidance
by those groups that use it -
students, staff and faculty.
2. The cafetaria's trading
accounts are not published - at
least, not in any widely
distributed forum such as The
Daily.

3. We all know that inflation is
running very strongly (at about 5
percent a year) but, by my rough
reckoning, Union prices have
increased, on the average, by
about 10 percent per year. Can
the management explain this?
4. Price rises are frequent and
unannounced and no explanation
for them is ever given. Sometimes
the subtle refinement of reducing
the quantity in a serving is used
instead of a price rise.
5. Price rises are highly
selective. Over the past year, some
items have not increased in price
while others have been raised by
50 percent. Is this reasonable?
6. Users will be familiar with
the over-ripe or bruised fruit, the
stale bread and cake and the sour
milk at breakfast (a specialty of
the Encina branch) that so ofter
appear.
7. No means, such as a
suggestion box, exists for students
and staff to register their
complaints and suggestions with
the management.
8. It would be interesting to
know what percentage of the
cafeteria's costs are attributable to
food, labor and overhead and how
these compare with other similar
establishments. How is the
overhead apportioned to the food
items - is it a constant percentage?
One assumes that cafeteria
receipts are used to cover
depreciation charges only on that
part of the Union building used
for the cafeteria, but I am sure
that a statement explaining this
would be welcome.

Here are some suggestions for
holding down costs and for
making the Tresidder food service
management more responsive to
the needs of its users.
1. Establish a student-faculty
staff committee with strong
advisory powers on all aspects of
Tresidder cafeteria operation.
2. Publish detailed accounts at
quarterly intervals with a
statement of how overhead and
labor charges are assigned to item
prices.
3. Announce all price rises two
weeks in advance with some
explanation of why they are
necessary.
4. Vary the menu. Eliminate
items for which demand is very
low and use imagination to create
low cost yet palatable
replacements.
5. Ensure that spoiled or
deteriorated food is not offered
for sale. See that milk and other
drink machines give full measure.
6. Seek to reduce costs by
reducing labor input. Perhaps
diners could be asked to bus their
own trays, as happens at many
other college cafeterias.
7. Schedule labor requirements
to match demand more closely,
including such unusual demands
as weekend conferences.
I hope that others will add
their suggestions to mine and that
the result may be a food service
that offers optimum service at
minimum cost.
