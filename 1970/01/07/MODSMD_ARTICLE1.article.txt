# Braunstein Denied Post Second Time
## 
### GREG WHITE 
Yale Braunstein, speaker of last
year's student legislature, has
twice been refused a place on the
Board of Trustees finance
committee by President Kenneth
Pitzer. Braunstein's rejection was
his second such exclusion from
the committee.
The refusal is sparking criticism
of Pitzer and may result in
student Senate resolutions
recommending keeping all
students off any Trustee
committee.
Pitzer rejected Braunstein's
nomination to the important
committee because Braunstein is
on probation. It is contrary to
University policy to put such
students in "positions of trust and
responsibility."
Braunstein says that he has
been kept on probation, thus
losing eligibility for the
nomination, by Pitzer because the
president is wary of the often
firey and controversial
ex —speaker. Braunstein's
probation and appeals history
stretches back to last spring.
Braunstein's first rejection
came at the end of fall term
before his appeal was heard by the
appeals board of the Judicial
Council.
Yesterday afternoon,
Braunstein met with Dean of
Students Peter J. Bulkeley who
reportedly urged him to withdraw
his nomination in order to smooth
relations with Pitzer. Braunstein is
standing firm, waiting for the
student Senate to consider the
matter in its meeting tomorrow
evening.
All Or None
Dave Edwards, chairman of the
student Senate, is upset at Pitzer's
continued refusal to accept the
nomination. "I personally don't
like it —if the students are to have
their own representative I don't
see why anyone should have a
veto. Yale has not been convicted
of any crime."
According to Edwards,
Braunstein and John Grube of the
Council of Presidents, a move may
be made at tomorrow's Senate
meeting to refuse approval of any
student nominee to Trustees
committees until Braunstein is
approved. Grube said that he "had
heard of senators who say if
Braunstein is rejected all the
nominations should be rejected."

Edwards said that he wanted to
study Pitzer's latest decision
before he decides what course of
action to follow at the Student
Senate meeting.
Three Term Probation
Braunstein was placed on
probation for three terms last year
by then Dean of Students Joel
Smith for a private matter that
was unconnected with any April 3
Movement activities. His
probation was slated to end in
June, 1 970.
Braunstein had agreed to a
hearing before Smith rather than
before the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) because Smith had
requested that he do so and
because he believed that the
charges would be dismissed or
probation limited to one term.
However, Smith indicated a
punishment that was harsher tharr
Braunstein had expected. His
ruling was the basis for Pitzer's
first rejection at the end of last
quarter.
No Other Objections
Braunstein's name was
submitted to Pitzer by the
Nominations Committee of the
ASSU, which is headed by Grube.
He was nominated to fill one of
fifteen vacancies on university
committees. Pitzer is reported to
have checked the nominations
with Board of Trustees President
W. Parmer Fuller and the
chairmen of the respective
committees. No objections were
understood to have been put
forward to any of the other
nominations.
Last spring, Braunstein,
angered by his unusually long
probation term, appealed Smith's
decision to the SJC,s appeal
board, which is composed of two
faculty members and one student.
Law professor Jack
Friedenthal, head of the SJC and
a member of the appeals board,
emphasized that the recent
hearing, held during the recent
Christmas vacation, was not a trial
but that it resulted in
"recommendations to the
President and (he) then informed
individuals involved of what the
decision has been."

Pitzer's original decision was
made before the appeal had been
heard. Friedenthal explained that
the several months delay between
Braunstein's request and the
recent hearing was actually the
fault of last year's legislature,
which was headed by Braunstein
himself. "The fault lies with the
fact that the student legislature
did not pick the students for the
student selection committee," he
said. It is this committee that
makes the nominations to the
President for the new members of
the SJC.
It was left for this year's

Senate, beset with internal
difficulties and a long wait for
election results, didn't get around
to choosing the new members
until last month. In effect, there
was no SJC to hear the case.
Finally, Braunstein agreed to
be heard by old members of the
Judicial Council. This was the
hearing that took place over
Christmas vacation, and its results
are those that particularly upset
Braunstein.
Harsh Decision
Prof. Thelton Henderson of the
Law School, Braunstein's counsel,
thinks "the hearing was

fair Friedenthal's rulings were
very fair and gave us wide latitude
in what we could present.
However, the decision was a
disappointment and a little
harsh."
The decision was to keep
Braunstein on probation.
"Frankly", Braunstein says,"I do
not understand what the Judicial
Council says. The president has
been given four or five alternatives
and he decided to take the one
that would keep me off the
finance committee. Pitzer doesn't
like me."
Braunstein feels that Pitzer's

stance may involve a lot more
than just harsh exercise of his
options as recommended by the
SJC appeal board. "They don't
want anybody in there who will
rock the boat or somebody who
knows what the budget is about."
No Jury Trial
According to his counsel
Henderson, this is just about what
he may have to do. "What
happens now is vague—l don't
think any case has ever been taken
further than this. We may have to
go to other courts outside of
Stanford. It all depends on what
Yale wants to do." According to

Braunstein, other lawyers told
him last spring that "courts would
find in my favor because 1 had no
real trial by jury."
Braunstein has mixed feelings
about the students role on the
trustee committees. "I sort of
agree that students shouldn't be
on them because it's
tokenism—there are only two
students to a committee and they
can easily be outvoted. However, I
wanted the nomination because I
think that somebody should point
out to the Trustees that what they
are doing is not necessarily the
best thing that has happened to
Stanford since the founding grant.
"But if the administration can
reject nominations, then its
possible that the Trustees will get
only people who are meek and
mild or who will tell them what
they want to hear."
