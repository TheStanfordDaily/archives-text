# Oh, Christ
## Stop The Stanford Housing Squeeze

. . 3. And all went to be
taxed, every one into his own
city . . .
"6. And so it was, that, while
they were there, the days were
accomplished that she should be
delivered.
"7. And she brought forth her
first-born son and wrapped him in
swaddling clothes, and laid him in
a manger: because there was no
room for them in the inn."
Christmas should be a time of
great joy, a celebration of birth.
But on the Peninsula this year, the
newly arrived worker, student or
faculty member probably found
no room at the inn, cursed the
growing population and wondered
why his higher taxes were not
improving his life.
If he looked around to see
what relief might be in sight, he
saw a new Palo Alto Civic Center,
which offered little in the way of
housing. If he looked to Stanford
lands, things were not much
better. Excavation has begun for
the new Coyote Hill Industrial
Park which will eventually bring
3000 to 4500 new jobs to this
already crowded area. A sign for
the new Dillingham financial
center called Palo Alto Square
now sits on the vacant land on the

corner of El Camino and Page Mill
Road in the old Industrial Park.
Dillingham (who built the lovely
Civic Center) will begin
construction soon on this tasteless
structure which will house
approximately 1500 new
employees. And new buildings are
going up in the rest of the old
Industrial Park as well.
No Housing in the Park
The person who already
commutes many miles to work or
school, or who pays exorbitant
rents in the area or who can't
seem to find even a distant or
expensive place to live won't find
much in the way of new homes on
the industrialized Stanford lands.
The trailers averted a student
housing crisis and the addition to
Escondido Village will probably
stabilize next fall's student crisis
at this year's level. The new
faculty homes will help out some
of the better-off full professors,
although new and junior faculty
members will not have an easy
task.
But what about those persons
with the greatest need: the staff
of the University which makes less
than $8,000 a year and numbers
several thousand people; the
employees of the present and new

"dustrial Park who can't afford
to live in Los Altos Hills or Palo
Alto and who are the majority of
the Park's 18,000 (soon to be over
20,000) employees; the
low-income blacks and
Mexican-Americans and working
class whites in the surrounding
communities who must compete
with each other and the
Stanford-based workers and the
thousands of students for the
limited low-cost housing in the
area? Should these people plan to
rent in the current housing project
on Stanford lands—the Oak Creek
Apartments, with studios starting
at $180 a month?
Little Low Cost Housing Planned
Needless to say the people who
most need housing can't live in
the housing currently being built
on the University's lands. The
University has done a study and
created a committee to
recommend some development of
low and moderate income housing
to offset some of the crisis its land
development practices have
helped create. But it appears that
the committee will be talking
about a few hundred units and
not the few thousand that just the
development of Coyote Hill and
the Dillingham center will
necessitate.

The buck may be passed to
Palo Alto and the surrounding
communities for their failure to
solve the housing and ecological
problems which come from rapid
industrial growth. And they do
share some of the blame. But one
fact is clear about the economy,
and thus the population of
Northern Santa Clara and
Southern San Mateo Counties: the
electronics-aerospace industries
that account for the phenomenal
growth of the area have their
origins in Stanford University's
long-outstanding science and
engineering schools. The early
discoveries of Stanford faculty
and graduates, small loans from
the University, use of the
laboratories and finally the
provision of land for industries
that wanted and needed to bo
near "a center of brains—that is,
near a university with a good
graduate program in engineering
and science . . (former Provost
Terman)—all these provisions and
more mark the history of the
growth of the industries and the
area.
University Tied to Industries
But the provision of land,
especially of Stanford land with
its easy access to the University's

"brains," has been the source of
much growth and many problems.
Stanford does earn necessary
income from leasing these lands,
although the whole Industrial Park
contributes less than the citcinford
Shopping Center which is on
one-eighth the acreage. Perhaps
more importantly, many of its
departments and their faculties
find lucrative contracting and
consultamcies, an industrial lab to
try their ideas in, and a place for
their graduate students to work.
The University too can go to these
industries for donations and new
buildings, which it has done with
success in the sciences and less
success in the humanities and
social sciences.
However, all this profit to the
University is bought at a price,
which the University has thus far
avoided facing. These social
costs—lack of housing, destruction
of the ecology of the area,
over-population—are being borne
by everyone. And the worst-paid
workers in the area are bearing the
heaviest costs. The time has come
for the University to face the
problems squarely.

Southern San Mateo Counties: the
electronics-aerospace industries
that account for the phenomenal
growth of the area have their
origins in Stanford University's
long-outstanding science and
engineering schools. The early
discoveries of Stanford faculty
and graduates, small loans from
the University, use of the
laboratories and finally the
provision of land for industries
that wanted and needed to bo

near a university with a good

and science . . (former Provost

more mark the history of the
growth of the industries and the
area.
University Tied to Industries
But the provision of land,
especially of Stanford land with
its easy access to the University's

"brains," has been the source of
much growth and many problems.
Stanford does earn necessary
income from leasing these lands,
although the whole Industrial Park
contributes less than the citcinford
Shopping Center which is on
one-eighth the acreage. Perhaps
more importantly, many of its
departments and their faculties
find lucrative contracting and
consultamcies, an industrial lab to
try their ideas in, and a place for
their graduate students to work.
The University too can go to these
industries for donations and new
buildings, which it has done with
success in the sciences and less
success in the humanities and
social sciences.
However, all this profit to the
University is bought at a price,
which the University has thus far
avoided facing. These social
costs—lack of housing, destruction
of the ecology of the area,
over-population—are being borne
by everyone. And the worst-paid
workers in the area are bearing the
heaviest costs. The time has come
for the University to face the
problems squarely.

"6. And so it was, that, while
they were there, the days were
accomplished that she should be
delivered.
"7. And she brought forth her
first-born son and wrapped him in
swaddling clothes, and laid him in
a manger: because there was no
room for them in the inn."
Christmas should be a time of
great joy, a celebration of birth.
But on the Peninsula this year, the
newly arrived worker, student or
faculty member probably found
no room at the inn, cursed the
growing population and wondered
why his higher taxes were not
improving his life.
If he looked around to see
what relief might be in sight, he
saw a new Palo Alto Civic Center,
which offered little in the way of
housing. If he looked to Stanford
lands, things were not much
better. Excavation has begun for
the new Coyote Hill Industrial
Park which will eventually bring
3000 to 4500 new jobs to this
already crowded area. A sign for
the new Dillingham financial
center called Palo Alto Square
now sits on the vacant land on the

corner of El Camino and Page Mill
Road in the old Industrial Park.
Dillingham (who built the lovely
Civic Center) will begin
construction soon on this tasteless
structure which will house
approximately 1500 new
employees. And new buildings are
going up in the rest of the old
Industrial Park as well.
No Housing in the Park
The person who already
commutes many miles to work or
school, or who pays exorbitant
rents in the area or who can't
seem to find even a distant or
expensive place to live won't find
much in the way of new homes on
the industrialized Stanford lands.
The trailers averted a student
housing crisis and the addition to
Escondido Village will probably
stabilize next fall's student crisis
at this year's level. The new
faculty homes will help out some
of the better-off full professors,
although new and junior faculty
members will not have an easy
task.
But what about those persons
with the greatest need: the staff
of the University which makes less
than $8,000 a year and numbers
several thousand people; the
employees of the present and new

"dustrial Park who can't afford
to live in Los Altos Hills or Palo
Alto and who are the majority of
the Park's 18,000 (soon to be over
20,000) employees; the
low-income blacks and
Mexican-Americans and working
class whites in the surrounding
communities who must compete
with each other and the
Stanford-based workers and the
thousands of students for the
limited low-cost housing in the
area? Should these people plan to
rent in the current housing project
on Stanford lands—the Oak Creek
Apartments, with studios starting
at $180 a month?
Little Low Cost Housing Planned
Needless to say the people who
most need housing can't live in
the housing currently being built
on the University's lands. The
University has done a study and
created a committee to
recommend some development of
low and moderate income housing
to offset some of the crisis its land
development practices have
helped create. But it appears that
the committee will be talking
about a few hundred units and
not the few thousand that just the
development of Coyote Hill and
the Dillingham center will
necessitate.

The buck may be passed to
Palo Alto and the surrounding
communities for their failure to
solve the housing and ecological
problems which come from rapid
industrial growth. And they do
share some of the blame. But one
fact is clear about the economy,

at this year's level. The new
faculty homes will help out some
of the better-off full professors,
although new and junior faculty
members will not have an easy
task.
But what about those persons
with the greatest need: the staff
of the University which makes less
than $8,000 a year and numbers
several thousand people; the
employees of the present and new

"dustrial Park who can't afford
to live in Los Altos Hills or Palo
Alto and who are the majority of
the Park's 18,000 (soon to be over
20,000) employees; the
low-income blacks and
Mexican-Americans and working
class whites in the surrounding
communities who must compete
with each other and the
Stanford-based workers and the
thousands of students for the
limited low-cost housing in the
area? Should these people plan to
rent in the current housing project
on Stanford lands—the Oak Creek
Apartments, with studios starting
at $180 a month?
Little Low Cost Housing Planned
Needless to say the people who
most need housing can't live in
the housing currently being built
on the University's lands. The
University has done a study and
created a committee to
recommend some development of
low and moderate income housing
to offset some of the crisis its land
development practices have
helped create. But it appears that
the committee will be talking
about a few hundred units and
not the few thousand that just the
development of Coyote Hill and
the Dillingham center will
necessitate.

The buck may be passed to
Palo Alto and the surrounding
communities for their failure to
solve the housing and ecological
problems which come from rapid
industrial growth. And they do
share some of the blame. But one
fact is clear about the economy,
and thus the population of
Northern Santa Clara and
Southern San Mateo Counties: the
electronics-aerospace industries
that account for the phenomenal
growth of the area have their
origins in Stanford University's
long-outstanding science and
engineering schools. The early
discoveries of Stanford faculty
and graduates, small loans from
the University, use of the
laboratories and finally the
provision of land for industries
that wanted and needed to bo
near "a center of brains—that is,
near a university with a good
graduate program in engineering
and science . . (former Provost
Terman)—all these provisions and
more mark the history of the
growth of the industries and the
area.
University Tied to Industries
But the provision of land,
especially of Stanford land with
its easy access to the University's

"brains," has been the source of
much growth and many problems.
Stanford does earn necessary
income from leasing these lands,
although the whole Industrial Park
contributes less than the citcinford
Shopping Center which is on
one-eighth the acreage. Perhaps
more importantly, many of its
departments and their faculties
find lucrative contracting and
consultamcies, an industrial lab to
try their ideas in, and a place for
their graduate students to work.
The University too can go to these
industries for donations and new
buildings, which it has done with
success in the sciences and less
success in the humanities and
social sciences.
However, all this profit to the
University is bought at a price,
which the University has thus far
avoided facing. These social
costs—lack of housing, destruction
of the ecology of the area,
over-population—are being borne
by everyone. And the worst-paid
workers in the area are bearing the
heaviest costs. The time has come
for the University to face the
problems squarely.

"6. And so it was, that, while
they were there, the days were
accomplished that she should be
delivered.
"7. And she brought forth her
first-born son and wrapped him in
swaddling clothes, and laid him in
a manger: because there was no
room for them in the inn."
Christmas should be a time of
great joy, a celebration of birth.
But on the Peninsula this year, the
newly arrived worker, student or
faculty member probably found
no room at the inn, cursed the
growing population and wondered
why his higher taxes were not
improving his life.
If he looked around to see
what relief might be in sight, he
saw a new Palo Alto Civic Center,
which offered little in the way of
housing. If he looked to Stanford
lands, things were not much
better. Excavation has begun for
the new Coyote Hill Industrial
Park which will eventually bring
3000 to 4500 new jobs to this
already crowded area. A sign for
the new Dillingham financial
center called Palo Alto Square
now sits on the vacant land on the

corner of El Camino and Page Mill
Road in the old Industrial Park.
Dillingham (who built the lovely
Civic Center) will begin
construction soon on this tasteless
structure which will house
approximately 1500 new
employees. And new buildings are
going up in the rest of the old
Industrial Park as well.
No Housing in the Park
The person who already
commutes many miles to work or
school, or who pays exorbitant
rents in the area or who can't
seem to find even a distant or
expensive place to live won't find
much in the way of new homes on
the industrialized Stanford lands.
The trailers averted a student
housing crisis and the addition to
Escondido Village will probably
stabilize next fall's student crisis
at this year's level. The new
