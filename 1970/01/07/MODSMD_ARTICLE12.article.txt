(Ed. Note—the following letter
to the Daily was dated Dec. 3,
1969.)
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article entitled "By-Laws
Changed by Student Senate,"
Tuesday, December 2, 1969,
needs to be clarified on two
points. 1) The Senate did not
complete its deliberations on the
entire By-Laws by the close of
Mondays meeting. Hopefully the
entire By-Laws will be accepted at
a near future meeting. 2) Last
year I chose to run and when
elected serve as one member of a
multiple "Hydra headed"
presidency. We were elected by a
1 nt bod" <"o"ni7'tnf of our
u .tilt. Joy rd Ba,.y a.c
( .! M " " do «i->oir snare,
i Minrt of (he /\sod

Executive workload. They should
receive equal credit.
The only obligation I see in the
hyper-legal role of "sole
president" for myself is to be held
accountable for the activities of
the ASSU Executive vis a vis the
ASSU Constitution.

Editor, THE DAILY:
112 admire the forthrightness of
President I'it/.er's statement of
open discrimination against
Mormons. The unanimous
endorsement of the statement by
the student senate makes it that

information about the Mormons
at Stanford, I am sure 1 can help
with the movement.
Putting down BYU was a fine
start but if BYU is to be branded
because of its association with the
Mormon Church, how much more
important is it to purge the
individual Mormons who hold the
church doctrines as a philosophy
of life.
I happen to know from
personal knowledge that Mormons
have infiltrated EVERY facet ol
the Stanford Community!! from
top to bottom. They threaten the
very fiber of the Stanford way of
life.
After considering the matter
carefully, I have come up with an
idea that has been effective in
protecting our society in the past.
' i addition, this suggestion has
w ? merit that it may lead to the
; ■" of federal support for

Stanford. (Some Philistine in
Washington may decide to apply
the standards of the civil rights act
to Stanford, as ridiculous as that
may sound.)
The more undesirable
Mormons could be eliminated by
requiring a simple loyalty oath of
all faculty, staff and students.
New applicants could sign the
oath as a matter of course. It
could read something like this:
"I have not, do not now, and
at no time in the future will I;
believe and practice the
doctrines of the Mormon
Church."
One word of caution. Through
the years Mormons have learned
various subtle menus to avoid
detection. They developed these
techniques in the past, when
certain Mormon doctrines were
considered immoral by great
institutions like Stanford. In those

times, however, the old-fashioned
means of discrimination were used
(rape, murder, denial of political
power, etc.).
I'm g1 a d we're more
sophisticated now. However, there
is one carryover from those
bygone days that could be useful
to Stanford officials in ferreting
out Mormons. I'm sure the casual
observer hasn't noticed, but, it
turns out if you examine a
Mormon's head very carefully,
there are two little horns a few
inches back from his forehead.
I hope this information will be
of help.

I am a Paly girl.
But not the kind you think.
Few, if anv, L'irls front Palo hit'll

are. When we want to have fun,
we don't solicit Stanford boys.
And just because some girl, any
girl, roves the Stanford campus,
that doesn't mean she comes from
Paly.
Often, Stanford activities fill in
for an empty night. Therefore,
Paly students will go on campus.
Some girls might meet Stanford
men; but most are just there for
some good, clean, innocent fun.
And we don't want to share the
reputation that the Paly (Jirl has.
It's especially bad when a herd
of Cubberley, Ounn, or other high
school girls cruise the campus.
Right off they're "Paly (lirls" to
the Stanford students.
Perhaps you Stanford men can
learn to differentiate among
women or do you need a course
for that, too?

idea that has been effective in
protecting our society in the past.
' i addition, this suggestion has
w ? merit that it may lead to the
; ■" of federal support for

Stanford. (Some Philistine in
Washington may decide to apply
the standards of the civil rights act
to Stanford, as ridiculous as that
may sound.)
The more undesirable
Mormons could be eliminated by
requiring a simple loyalty oath of
all faculty, staff and students.
New applicants could sign the
oath as a matter of course. It
could read something like this:
"I have not, do not now, and
at no time in the future will I;
believe and practice the
doctrines of the Mormon
Church."
One word of caution. Through
the years Mormons have learned
various subtle menus to avoid
detection. They developed these
techniques in the past, when
certain Mormon doctrines were
considered immoral by great
institutions like Stanford. In those

times, however, the old-fashioned
means of discrimination were used
(rape, murder, denial of political
power, etc.).
I'm g1 a d we're more
sophisticated now. However, there
is one carryover from those
bygone days that could be useful
to Stanford officials in ferreting
out Mormons. I'm sure the casual
observer hasn't noticed, but, it
turns out if you examine a
Mormon's head very carefully,
there are two little horns a few
inches back from his forehead.
I hope this information will be
of help.

I am a Paly girl.
But not the kind you think.
Few, if anv, L'irls front Palo hit'll

are. When we want to have fun,
we don't solicit Stanford boys.
And just because some girl, any
girl, roves the Stanford campus,
that doesn't mean she comes from
Paly.
Often, Stanford activities fill in
for an empty night. Therefore,
Paly students will go on campus.
Some girls might meet Stanford
men; but most are just there for
some good, clean, innocent fun.
And we don't want to share the
reputation that the Paly (Jirl has.
It's especially bad when a herd
of Cubberley, Ounn, or other high
school girls cruise the campus.
Right off they're "Paly (lirls" to
the Stanford students.
Perhaps you Stanford men can
learn to differentiate among

reputation that the Paly (Jirl has.
It's especially bad when a herd
of Cubberley, Ounn, or other high
school girls cruise the campus.
Right off they're "Paly (lirls" to
the Stanford students.
Perhaps you Stanford men can
learn to differentiate among
women or do you need a course
for that, too?

Shea Clarifies
(Ed. Note—the following letter
to the Daily was dated Dec. 3,
1969.)
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article entitled "By-Laws
Changed by Student Senate,"
Tuesday, December 2, 1969,
needs to be clarified on two
points. 1) The Senate did not
complete its deliberations on the
entire By-Laws by the close of
Mondays meeting. Hopefully the
entire By-Laws will be accepted at
a near future meeting. 2) Last
year I chose to run and when
elected serve as one member of a
multiple "Hydra headed"
presidency. We were elected by a

Executive workload. They should
receive equal credit.
The only obligation I see in the
hyper-legal role of "sole
president" for myself is to be held
accountable for the activities of
the ASSU Executive vis a vis the
ASSU Constitution.

Editor, THE DAILY:
112 admire the forthrightness of
President I'it/.er's statement of
open discrimination against
Mormons. The unanimous
endorsement of the statement by
the student senate makes it that
murh more impressive.

information about the Mormons
at Stanford, I am sure 1 can help
with the movement.
Putting down BYU was a fine
start but if BYU is to be branded
because of its association with the
Mormon Church, how much more
important is it to purge the
individual Mormons who hold the
church doctrines as a philosophy
of life.
I happen to know from
personal knowledge that Mormons
have infiltrated EVERY facet ol
the Stanford Community!! from
top to bottom. They threaten the
very fiber of the Stanford way of
life.
After considering the matter
carefully, I have come up with an
idea that has been effective in
protecting our society in the past.
' i addition, this suggestion has
w ? merit that it may lead to the
; ■" of federal support for

Stanford. (Some Philistine in
Washington may decide to apply
the standards of the civil rights act
to Stanford, as ridiculous as that
may sound.)
The more undesirable
Mormons could be eliminated by
requiring a simple loyalty oath of
all faculty, staff and students.
New applicants could sign the
oath as a matter of course. It
could read something like this:
"I have not, do not now, and
at no time in the future will I;
believe and practice the
doctrines of the Mormon
Church."
One word of caution. Through
the years Mormons have learned
various subtle menus to avoid
detection. They developed these
techniques in the past, when
certain Mormon doctrines were
considered immoral by great
institutions like Stanford. In those

times, however, the old-fashioned
means of discrimination were used
(rape, murder, denial of political
power, etc.).
I'm g1 a d we're more
sophisticated now. However, there
is one carryover from those
bygone days that could be useful
to Stanford officials in ferreting
out Mormons. I'm sure the casual
observer hasn't noticed, but, it
turns out if you examine a
Mormon's head very carefully,
there are two little horns a few
inches back from his forehead.
I hope this information will be
of help.

Pal\ Girl Onus
I (lilor, TIIK DAILY:
I am a Paly girl.
But not the kind you think.
Few, if anv, L'irls front Palo hit'll

are. When we want to have fun,
we don't solicit Stanford boys.
And just because some girl, any
girl, roves the Stanford campus,
that doesn't mean she comes from
Paly.
Often, Stanford activities fill in
for an empty night. Therefore,
Paly students will go on campus.
Some girls might meet Stanford
men; but most are just there for
some good, clean, innocent fun.
And we don't want to share the
reputation that the Paly (Jirl has.
It's especially bad when a herd
of Cubberley, Ounn, or other high
school girls cruise the campus.
Right off they're "Paly (lirls" to
the Stanford students.
Perhaps you Stanford men can
learn to differentiate among
women or do you need a course
