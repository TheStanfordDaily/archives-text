# Politics Approved
## 
### 
Palo Alto school board has
adopted a new policy allowing
high school students to form
partisan political organizations,
replacing a 1968 ban on such
activities. According to trustee Dr.
Bernard Oliver, the policy has the
capacity of making "all sides sort
of equally unhappy."
The new policy allows students
to form organizations as long as
they do not advocate violence,
truency, or other illegal acts. The
organizations may not place any
limitation on "race, creed or
political belief", membership shall
be limited to enrolled students,
and the organization must be
approved by the principle and be
assigned an approved sponser.
Dr. Oliver stated the policy was
more liberal than some trustees
and administrators wanted. An
ammendment to more specifically
prohibit outside radical
organizations, proposed by Dr.
Royce Cole, was defeated 4—l by
the board.
One student declared the board
and the policy were racist,
regarding the race, belief and
creed clause. The clause would
prevent black students from
forming exclusively black
organizations.
The new policy was approved
at a December 15 board meeting
attended by 200 persons,
including about 40 high school
students. The 300 word statement
was drafted after the board voted
in November to replace the old
policy stating "Student
organizations shall not be
permitted to engage in political
advocacy or activities of a partisan
political nature." The old policy
had been the subject of
board—stu dent debate since
school opened.
Policy Statement
The new policy statement
asserts:
"Student organizations should
have purposes that enhance the
recreational, or educational value
of school life without

substantially diminishing these
values for non—member students
and must not materially disrupt
the regular school program. No
organization shall exert undue
pressure on, or infringe the
constitutional rights of any
individual. Organizations are
encouraged to develop informed
student opinion through the
critical examination and balanced
presentation of controversial
issues.
"Organizations that attempt to
incite violence, truancy, or other
illegal actions or that disseminate
or assist in disseminating literature
which encites disruption, truancy,
violence, or illegal actions, are
considered disruptive and
therefore unacceptable.
"Membership shall be limited
to students enrolled in the school
and shall not be limited by race
creed, or political belief.
Approval Needed
"Student organizations must
be approved by the local school
principal according to an
administrative procedure which
takes into account the purposes,
membership, activities, financing,
responsibilities, affiliation, and
supervision of the proposed
group. Any affiliation of a local
student organization with an
outside organization must be
clearly described in writing and a
charter of the parent club, if a
charter exists, must be made a
part of the record at the time of
the application for approval.
"Each student organization
shall have a faculty sponsor
approved by the school principal.
All funds shall be deposited in the
student body accounts of the
school and all transfers of funds
to or from an outside organization
must be approved by the
principal.
"All student organization
activities are part of the total
educational process of the school,
and as such are subject to
administrative control and
supervision . .
