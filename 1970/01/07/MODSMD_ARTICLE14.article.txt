# Liberals Have Edge In Alumni Survey
## 
### 
Politically the Stanford
graduate is not the "average
Californian." A recent random
sample mail survey of Stanford
alumni living in California
revealed that "liberals" (29%)
slightly outnumbered
"conservatives" (26%). This is in
direct opposition to the rest of
the state where conservatives
outnumber liberals almost 2 to 1.
The majority of California alumni
(43%) regarded themselves as
"middle of the road."
Also revealed in the survey was
the somewhat contradictory
figures that Republican alumni
outnumber Democratic alumni
almost 2 to 1.
When the data is broken down
into regional groups it is seen that
the liberal advantage comes in
great part from the local 6 Bay
Area counties where liberals
outnumber conservatives 41% to
22%.
In other parts of the country
alumni tend to classify themselves
more strongly as liberals. Those
living in the Middle Atlantic
region are the most liberal, while
those in the Mountain States are
the most conservative. Again
Republicans outnumber Democrats;
this time almost 3 to 1.
No Student Trustee
The mail survey also touched
on the question of university
governance. Nearly two —thirds of
the alumni agreed that it would be
good if there were a greater
variety of background and age
among the Stanford trustees. A
slim majority (51% versus 37%),
though, still rejected the idea of a

student being a "fully active
member" of the board.
Similar views were shown when
the alumni were asked questions
regarding trustee selection. A
substantial majority rejected the
statement, "Members of the
Stanford Board of Trustees
choose their successors, and this is
the way it should be." At the
same time, alumni disapproved,
by a 2 to 1 margin, the idea that
students should be able to vote
for trustees directly or through
representatives. A majority
favored faculty voice in the
selection.
Another survey recently
conducted involved a 55 percent
sample of residents in one of the
coed dorms, including freshmen
through seniors. The survey
investigated the concerns of
Stanford undergrads.
Lack of Communication
According to the survey, the
greatest sources of concern among
Stanford University
undergraduates are dissatisfaction
with the quality of
communication with fellow
students and uncertainties about
future plans.
Other high—ranking sources of
worry were poor relations with
the opposite sex, lack of
self—confidence, despondency or
depression, too much study, and
ineffective use of time.
Fewer than one in 10 worried
about drinking, friendships with
members of the same sex, drug
usage, friction with parents,
suicidal thoughts, and
over —eating.

ineffective use of time.
Fewer than one in 10 worried
about drinking, friendships with
members of the same sex, drug
usage, friction with parents,
suicidal thoughts, and
over —eating.
Politically the Stanford
graduate is not the "average
Californian." A recent random
sample mail survey of Stanford
alumni living in California
revealed that "liberals" (29%)
slightly outnumbered
"conservatives" (26%). This is in
direct opposition to the rest of
the state where conservatives
outnumber liberals almost 2 to 1.
The majority of California alumni
(43%) regarded themselves as
"middle of the road."
Also revealed in the survey was
the somewhat contradictory
figures that Republican alumni
outnumber Democratic alumni
almost 2 to 1.
When the data is broken down
into regional groups it is seen that
the liberal advantage comes in
great part from the local 6 Bay
Area counties where liberals
outnumber conservatives 41% to
22%.
In other parts of the country
alumni tend to classify themselves
more strongly as liberals. Those
living in the Middle Atlantic
region are the most liberal, while
those in the Mountain States are
the most conservative. Again
Republicans outnumber Democrats;
this time almost 3 to 1.
No Student Trustee
The mail survey also touched
on the question of university
governance. Nearly two —thirds of
the alumni agreed that it would be
good if there were a greater
variety of background and age
among the Stanford trustees. A
slim majority (51% versus 37%),
though, still rejected the idea of a

student being a "fully active
member" of the board.
Similar views were shown when
the alumni were asked questions
regarding trustee selection. A
substantial majority rejected the
statement, "Members of the
Stanford Board of Trustees
choose their successors, and this is
the way it should be." At the
same time, alumni disapproved,
by a 2 to 1 margin, the idea that
students should be able to vote
for trustees directly or through
representatives. A majority
favored faculty voice in the
selection.
Another survey recently
conducted involved a 55 percent
sample of residents in one of the
coed dorms, including freshmen
through seniors. The survey
investigated the concerns of
Stanford undergrads.
Lack of Communication
According to the survey, the
greatest sources of concern among
Stanford University
undergraduates are dissatisfaction
with the quality of
communication with fellow
students and uncertainties about
future plans.
Other high—ranking sources of
worry were poor relations with
the opposite sex, lack of
self—confidence, despondency or
depression, too much study, and
ineffective use of time.
