A public forum on "Stanford's
Land and the Crisis in the
Midpeninsula Environment" is set
for tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
Cubberly Auditorium on the
Stanford campus.
The forum will feature five
speakers from the newly—formed
activist group, "Grass Roots,"
which plans a broadly—based
program on land use, ecology and
housing for the Midpeninsula area.
Grass Roots announced
Monday that it will sponsor a
peaceful protest demonstration
January 12 at the site of the new
"Palo Alto Square" office and
hotel complex which is scheduled
for construction by the
Dillingham Corporation at the
corner of El Camino and Page Mill
Road. The forum Wednesday
night will air objections to the
Dillingham project and other land
developments, including the
Coyote Hill Industrial Park.
The keynote speaker at the
forum will be Paul Rupert, a 1967
Stanford graduate who has been
active in the Palo Alto Resistance.
Rupert will give an overview of
Santa Clara county development
and the interrelated problems of
industrial development., housing
and ecology.
Joan Saunders, a resident of
East Palo Aito who has been
active in community organizing,

will describe the human problems
caused by the critical shortage of
low —rent housing in the
Midpeninsula area.
Marshall Johnson, a member of
the Palo Alto Resistance, will
discuss air pollution and other
ecological problems caused by
continued growth of the
Midpeninsula.
Vic Von Schlegell, a Stanford
graduate student and member of
the University committee on Land
and Building Development, will
present a critique of the
University's policies and
decision—making.
The fifth speaker will be
Michael Sweeney, a Stanford
student and Palo Alto resident,
who will discuss the Dillingham
project.
A movie will be shown during
the presentations, showing the
land development now underway
and some of the local problems of
housing and environment.
After the speeches, the floor
will be opened for general
discussion and debate. The forum
is open to all interested people in
the midpeninsula area.
