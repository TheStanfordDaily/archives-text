# Faculty Senate To Study Plans For Student Center
## 
### 
Plans for the Student Center
for Research and Innovation in
Education will be scrutinized a
second time tomorrow by the
faculty Senate.
At its last meeting the Senate
authorized granting four new
degrees and ruled that regularly
offered courses must be offeredfor
at least three units.
As proposed, the Center will
sponsor student initiated
experiments in directc-d reading
and other studies, and will
coordinate interested students and
faculty.
An eleven-member policy
board, including six students will
be able to award academic credit
for projects, and a student
director will run the center. (See
yesterday's Daily, p. 3.)
Following a brief discussion of
the center at a faculty Senate
meeting Dec. 18, Chairman
William Clebsch predicted, "I
firmly believe the Senate will
approve the center, although a
large number of members may
wish to alter details in the
proposal presented by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
"There is genuine enthusiasm
among faculty representatives for
student innovation in education at
Stanford."
New Degrees
The Senate also authorized
four new degrees on Dec. 18. The

School of Humanities and
Sciences may now award M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees in Modern
Thought and Literature.
The Committee on Latin
American Studies and the Dean of
Undergraduate studies may
recommend candidates for a B.A.
in Latin American Studies. The
Dean and the Committee on
Human Biology may recommend
candidates for a B.A. in Human
Biology, an inter-disciplinary
program funded by a Ford
Foundation grant.
The Senate made a
two-pronged attempt to follow
SES goals of reducing the number
of courses a student takes each
quarter. Courses regularly open to
undergraduates must now be at
least three units, although
exceptions can be made on
petition of the course instructor
or department.
When the second resolution is
implemented by administrators,
no student will be able to receive
more than 18 units of credit per
quarter except through special
petition. Formerly, students could
take 21 units of work without
special petition.

Plans for the Student Center
for Research and Innovation in
Education will be scrutinized a
second time tomorrow by the
faculty Senate.
At its last meeting the Senate
authorized granting four new
degrees and ruled that regularly
offered courses must be offeredfor
at least three units.
As proposed, the Center will
sponsor student initiated
experiments in directc-d reading
and other studies, and will
coordinate interested students and
faculty.
An eleven-member policy
board, including six students will
be able to award academic credit
for projects, and a student
director will run the center. (See
yesterday's Daily, p. 3.)
Following a brief discussion of
the center at a faculty Senate
meeting Dec. 18, Chairman
William Clebsch predicted, "I
firmly believe the Senate will
approve the center, although a
large number of members may
wish to alter details in the
proposal presented by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
"There is genuine enthusiasm
among faculty representatives for
student innovation in education at
Stanford."

of courses a student takes each

undergraduates must now be at
least three units, although
exceptions can be made on
petition of the course instructor
or department.
When the second resolution is
