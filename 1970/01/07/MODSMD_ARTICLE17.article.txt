### 
The long—dead undergraduate
literary magazine, Workshop, is
currently being revived. Five
students, acting as mere organizers
for the time being, are collecting
matterial through a network of
dorm representatives. Present
plans call for the first issue to
appear in early Febuary with
monthly issues thereafter. The
editors are hoping to build a
creative literary community,
centered around the Workshop.
There will be a meeting Thurs.
night at 7:30 in the Round Room
at Mem Chu for anyone interested
in working on this enterprise.
Material may also be submitted in
the undergraduate English office
and the Sequoia office. The first
deadline is late this month.


GIANT HANGAR MODEL for mammoth new passenger and cargo airplanes was designed and built by Stanford civil
engineering students including (left to right) Charles Kircher, Doug Perry, and Jack Goralnik. Though made of plastic the
1 /50th scale model exactly duplicates steel framework of a real hangar and the stresses that would be imposed on cables
supporting roof. Any type of building material could be used to cover the framework, the engineers said, with strength to
spare. - —
