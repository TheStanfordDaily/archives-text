# New Anti-War Party
## 
### 
Dissatisfaction with the way
the traditional two party system
in its dealings with the Vietnam
war has led Stanford area
residents to found an new
political party.
Led by a group of five area
residents, including Moratorium
student organizer John Kramer
and two Stanford professors,
Martin Carnoy and Martin Perl,
the Peninsula New Party will hold
its first meeting tonight at 8 in
Tresidder Union. The meeting will
develop a set of priorities for
action over the coming months

and create working committees to
organize these activities.
Desire to form the party arose
from an uncomfortable feeling
that many Moratorium supporters
felt when working within the two
party structure.
The party intends to
concentrate energies toward local
organizing and winning control of
local decisionâ€”making groups. It
will attempt to unify the peace
movement, voters who did not
vote in 1968, young people,
minority groups, and the ecology
movements.
