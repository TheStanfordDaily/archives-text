President Nixon spoke ot his
desire to create such a policy in a
Statement Friday in which he
named Steplun He , who had
been deputj ditecto; of the Urban
Affair; Council, as national
fchairm m ol the White House
Conference on Children and
"Youth. The conference will be
Jicld here Dec. ltf 18 1970.
Quietly and with little public
notice, the Nixon Administration
for some months has been
sketching the preliminary outline
, of what the White House calls a
"national youth policy."
In an interview, Mr. Ik: ; said it
•was his hope that the conference
would produce , among other
• achievements, a "major document
that will give substance to the idea
of a national youth policy that
' is, a policy that explicitly
• recognizes youth a i special
\ phenotm uon and s» eks to adjust
. government policy to the special
• needs of youth."
Already, however, one of Mr.
\ Nixon's younger aides, Chester E.
Finn Jr., a junior st iff member of
the Urban Affairs Council, has
made a number ol specific
observations about a possible
•youth policy that are said to have
provoked consid< rable interest
.among the President V senior
associates, including Daniel

Patrick Moynihan, the President's
senior Counselor, and John D.
Khrlichman, his assistant for
domestic affairs.
Pr« hcnted to Cabinet
Mr. Finn has outlined his case
in two documents. One, called
"Ecology of Youth," was
presented at a closed meeting of
the cabinet in September and
included contributions from other
young council staff members. It
apparently so impressed the
Cabinet that Rogers C. B. Morton,
chairman of the Republican
National Committee, had it
presented to a meeting of
Republican state chairmen.
The second document, an
internal position paper called
"Toward a National Youth
Policy," is modeled closely on
some of Mr. Moynihan's writings
about a national urban policy.
In the first paper, Mr. Finn and
hi colleagues called attention to
what they said was a "crisis" of
authority that many of the
nation's youth —by their
definition the II million
individuals aged 15 through
26 seemed to experiencing.
Goals Opposed By Young
"This crisis of authority," the
paper said, "has two main
elements: first, a feeling that the
political system is pursuing goals

opposed by the young; and
second, that the young do not fee!
they can affect these policies."
One of the central causes of
the present crisis, the Cabinet was
told, was the Governments own
policies. "If Government policies
affecting the young has one
theme,'" the paper said, it is to
encourage the young to prolong
their youth "and lengthen their
'dependency' on an essentially
adult society over which they
have little control."
Among these programs, the
authors cited the Federal
Cover n m ent's systemati c
promotion of higher education,
outdated civil service age
requirements, implicit Federal
support for long apprenticeship
programs, barriers to the vote and
public office, and a variety of
other well-intentioned efforts
whose net effect is to isolate
youth from an active role in
society commensurate with
youth's growing maturity.
Forcing I'.ntr) Into Socicty
Pursuing this theme in his
second paper, Mr. Finn asserted
that the contemporary youth
movement "may, in the broadest
sense, be seen as an attempt by
young people to force their entry
into society, to compel it to
acknowledge that they exist."

Among these programs, the

promotion of higher education,
outdated civil service age
requirements, implicit Federal
support for long apprenticeship

youth from an active role in

youth's growing maturity.

Pursuing this theme in his

President Nixon spoke ot his
desire to create such a policy in a
Statement Friday in which he
named Steplun He , who had
been deputj ditecto; of the Urban
Affair; Council, as national
fchairm m ol the White House
Conference on Children and
"Youth. The conference will be
Jicld here Dec. ltf 18 1970.
Quietly and with little public
notice, the Nixon Administration
for some months has been
sketching the preliminary outline
, of what the White House calls a
"national youth policy."
In an interview, Mr. Ik: ; said it
•was his hope that the conference
would produce , among other
• achievements, a "major document
that will give substance to the idea
of a national youth policy that
' is, a policy that explicitly
• recognizes youth a i special
\ phenotm uon and s» eks to adjust
. government policy to the special
• needs of youth."
Already, however, one of Mr.
\ Nixon's younger aides, Chester E.
Finn Jr., a junior st iff member of
the Urban Affairs Council, has
made a number ol specific
observations about a possible
•youth policy that are said to have
provoked consid< rable interest
.among the President V senior
associates, including Daniel

Patrick Moynihan, the President's
senior Counselor, and John D.
Khrlichman, his assistant for
domestic affairs.
Pr« hcnted to Cabinet
Mr. Finn has outlined his case
in two documents. One, called
"Ecology of Youth," was
presented at a closed meeting of
the cabinet in September and
included contributions from other
young council staff members. It
apparently so impressed the
Cabinet that Rogers C. B. Morton,
chairman of the Republican
National Committee, had it
presented to a meeting of
Republican state chairmen.
The second document, an
internal position paper called
"Toward a National Youth
Policy," is modeled closely on
some of Mr. Moynihan's writings
about a national urban policy.
In the first paper, Mr. Finn and
hi colleagues called attention to
what they said was a "crisis" of
authority that many of the
nation's youth —by their
definition the II million
individuals aged 15 through
26 seemed to experiencing.
Goals Opposed By Young
"This crisis of authority," the
paper said, "has two main
elements: first, a feeling that the
political system is pursuing goals

opposed by the young; and
second, that the young do not fee!
they can affect these policies."
One of the central causes of
the present crisis, the Cabinet was
told, was the Governments own
policies. "If Government policies
affecting the young has one
theme,'" the paper said, it is to
encourage the young to prolong
their youth "and lengthen their
'dependency' on an essentially
adult society over which they
have little control."
Among these programs, the
