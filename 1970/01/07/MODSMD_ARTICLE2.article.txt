# ROTC Enrollment Same Since Lottery

### Frank Miller 
Little increase or decrease
Reserve Officer's Training Corps
(ROTC) enrollment at Stanford
has been reported since the draft
lottery of last December.
According to officials of the
Air Force, Army, and Navy ROTC
units, there has been a slight
increase in enquiries by male
students who drew low numbers
in the lottery and are now highly
susceptible to the draft. There has
been an even smaller change in the
enrollment due to students
dropping out of the program
because they drew high numbers.
Each branch of the armed
orces has received enquiries from
students who feel threatened by
the draft, but the number varied
from the Army's estimate of 25 to
the Navy's report of just a few.
Army and Air Force have normal
programs that will allow many of
those interested to join ROTC
extended its normal deadline for
applications for the four year
contract program to January 16.
It has been suggested by some
that freshmen might join Navy
ROTC as a precaution against
drawing a low number in the draft
lottery. If they actually draw a
high number during their
sophomore year, then they can

drop out of the program. As in
the other ROTC programs, no
permanent commitment is made
by students until the start of their
third year in ROTC.
Army and Air Force programs
that might be of interest to those
with low numbers in the draft
lottery generally require
application for a two year
program during January. Those
admitted would spend some time
at summer camps and take ROTC
classes their last two years in
school.
Upon graduation the Army
requires the ROTC officer to
spend two years on active duty,
while the Air Force requires four
years. In many cases, these
programs are open to
upperclassmen and graduate
students. Although there are
quotas for these programs,
chances are evidently good that
applicants will be admitted.
Captain Carl R. Oliver, an
instructor in Army ROTC,
reported that there has "not really
been r substantial number of
students motivated t,o join ROTC
because of the lottery."
Evidently few Stanford
students have decided to enroll in
ROTC as a safety measure against
the draft.
