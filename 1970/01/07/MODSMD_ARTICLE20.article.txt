# Ten Film Programs On Tap This Quarter
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Winter quarter is traditionally
the most abutulent in film series.
This year, things seem to
following through true to form, as
no fewer than ten separate
programs are scheduled to fill up
the coming nine weeks.
Furthermore, judging only from
this week's offerings, the quality
practically outshines the quantity.
The season starts off in the
most glorious way imaginable with
Children of I'aradise, which is
without question my favorite film
of all time. Jacques Prevert's
.script is so rich and sensitive, the
performances, from Jean —Louis
Barrault and Arletty on down, are
so skilled and dense and Marcel
Carne's direction is so evocative of
the mid —nineteenth century
French milieu that one is rendered
totally intoxicated throughout the
film and for a good while
afterwards.
This 1945 production, made
during the Nazi occupation and
with several of the artists involved
under threat of arrest, is
constructed as a melodrama of
epic humanistic proportions.
Almost every conceivable emotion
is impressively displayed and the
film, with its long, receding final
shot, makes what to my mind is
the ultimate statement on the
possibilities for permanent
relationships and love. If you can
catch just one film this week or,
indeed, this quarter, make it
Children of Paradise, which the
International Association will
show on Thursday fit 7:45 in
Cubberley.
Also showing on Thursday in a
new series presented by the
International Society- law school
is Requiem loi .1 Heavyweight. A
tough drama based on Rod
Selling's original teleplay,
Anthonv Quinn is featured as a

washed up prize fighter facing a
miserable, degraded future. Jackie
Gleason, Mickey Rooney, Julie
Harris and a young C'assius Clay
score heavily in this 19G2 film
directed by Ralph Nelson. In the
graduate business school's Bishop
Auditorium at 7 and 9.
Starting off Tresidder's series
of neglected films of the sixties is
Jacques Demy's superb Bay of
Angels. Demy is most famous for
I'lie llinltrellas of Cherbourg but
his earlier, black—and—white
pictures are actually much better
and this one may he his best. The
c o m b in a t i on of D e 111 y ' s
beautifully energetic direction,
R a o u 1 C o u t a r d' s dazzling
photography and Michel
Legrand's joyous score constitutes
an ultimate triumph of style over
content, though Jeanne Moreau is
amazing us a Bette Davis type and
the gambling world settings are
most contagious. The ending is
rushed and initially unsatisfying
but, by contrast, the film opens
with a shot as exciting and
refreshing as any in memory. On
Friday at 7, 8 and 9.
Bergman Film
Smiles of a Summer iNiglil is
Ingmar Bergman's most appealing
film and the director's skill at
ribald comedy wiil come as a
surprise to those weaned on his
later, "black'' allegorical dramas.
This carnal caper features a
particularly original approach to
the battle of the sexes which
remains, as always, unwon. As
Smiles ot a Summer Nighl will be
shown in Cubberley at 7 and
9:30, proper planning makes it
easy to see both this and Bay of
Angles 011 Friday night. A
two film evening is high
recommended.
I lie Wrong Box is a somewhat
muted but still highly engaging
British slapstick comedy by Bryan

Forbes. As always, Peter Cook
and Dudley Moore are a joy and
the peculiar talents of Peter
Sellers, Michael Caine, Ralph
Richardson, John Mills, the late,
great Wilfrid Lawson and
composer John Barry contribute
effectively to the zany
proceedings. At Tresidder on
Saturday.

Though 1 somewhat prefer
Fellini's earlier pictures to his
recent symbolic exercises in
cinematic self—analysis, Juliet of
the Spirits still stands as a rather
unique experience if only because
of the director's experimentation
with form and color. Giulietta
Masina and inarguably more

captivating in The Nights of
Cabiria and La S trad a (before her
husband began using actors as
mannequins) than she is here.
Nonetheless, Fellini has been one
of the most formidable forces in
the cinema over the past twenty
yeara and until his Satyricon is
released stateside, Juliet of the
Spirits will serve quite adequately
as a representation of his
remarkable and thoroughly
cinematic personality. This is the
first of five films being presented
by Beta Chi and will be shown on
Saturday in Cubberley at 7, 9:30
and midnight.
Popi is one of the nicer films to
have been released over the past
year. Besides being funny and
involving in its own right, the
picture is especially commendable
in that its sociological elements
are not subject to polemicizing
and preaching. Alan Arkin stars in
the Sunday Flick at Mem And.
