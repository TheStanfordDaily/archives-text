# Prison Drama
## 
### 
"The Cage" by Rick Cluchey,
an explosive prison drama written,
directed, and performed by
former inmates of San Quentin,
will be presented by the Barbwire
Theatre for six performances in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium at
Stanford University.
The San Francisco—based,
non-profit organization will
appear under the auspices of the
Stanford Repertory Theater.
Performances of the play are
scheduled for 8 p.m. Jan. 9, 10,
16, and 18, and for 7 p.m. Jan. 11
and 18.
Following the performance
there will be a player—audience
discussion or "confrontation"
during which cast members will
examine current problems of
today's penal system.
"The Cage" was written by
Cluchey while he was serving a life
sentence without the possibility
of parole for robbery—kidnaping.
It was first performed by the San
Quentin Drama Workshop, a
group which under Cluchey's
leadership produced more than 35
plays for the inmates. Partly as a
result of this work, Gov. Edmund
Brown commuted Cluchey's
sentence to life parole after he
had served 12 years behind bars.
The Barbwire Theatre was
formed in February 1969 by a
group of ex—convicts who are
trying to provide both a step back
into society for those coming out
of prison and a means of bringing
prison problems forcibly to public
attention.
"What we hope to do is bring
about a change in the country's
penal system by showing the
junkyards and scrapheaps for
human beings that our prisons
have become," says Cluchey.
"We've got to start respecting
people in our society, even people
who fail."
"The Cage" concerns three
hardened inmates who initiate a
young man accused of murder
into the brutal realities of prison
existence. During the 80 minutes
of intense, often humorous,
theater, the players enact a bizarre
drama that demonstrates the
violence, homosexuality, ritual,
and fantasies of a world too often
ignored.
