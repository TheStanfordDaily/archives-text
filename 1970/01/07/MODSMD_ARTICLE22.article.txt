# Cagers Lose Six; Rosenzweig Out
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
After a disappointing holiday
season which saw them lose six
out of seven games, Stanford's
basketball team suffered another
setback Monday when it was
learned that 6-10 center Larry
Rosenzweig will be out for the
season with a knee injury. After a
fine start which saw him pick up
36 points and 27 rebounds as a
substitute in the first three games
of the season, Rosenzweig
strained his knee ligaments in the
Santa Clara game.
The injury appeared to be
healing somewhat until the night
before the Kodak Classic in
Rochester, N.Y., when
Rosenzweig retwisted the knee
severely enough to necessitate
surgery. The loss of Rosenzweig
places all the pressure on veteran
6-7 center Bill Palmer. Palmer's
only help will come from two 6-6
men, Steve Kuchenbecker and
Mike Michel.
Broncos Prevail
After a tough loss to Utah and
a romp over San Jose State, the
Indians returned to Maples
Pavilion December 5 to take on
the nationally ranked Santa Clara
Broncos. Against Santa Clara, the
Tribe hit a cold spell, shooting
under 40 per cent, and the
Broncos won easily, 72-60. The
loss was all the more costly since
both Rosenzweig and Chuck
Moore suffered fairly serious
injuries in the game. Moore
strained his right instep.
Following the Santa Clara
game, the Indians, minus
Rosenzweig and Moore, lost to
the University of San Francisco,
73-64. The Cards outshot the
Dons from the floor, 28 to 24,
but as in the Utah game, Stanford
lost the game on the foul line.
Dennis O'Neill led the scoring

with fourteen while Palmer added
1 2 points and 9 rebounds.
After a two week break for
examinations, Stanford resumed
action against St. John's of New
York. A fine 21 point effort by
O'Neill sparked the Indians to a
near upset over the nationally
ranked Redmen, but St. John's
came back from a fifteen point
first half deficit to win, 63-59.
The following night, Stanford
lost to the University of California
at Santa Barbara, 67-62. The
Indians had a very cold shooting
night (36 percent), and the
Gauchos took advantage of it for
a surprise win.
Tribe Whips Rochester
On December 29, the Indians
broke their four game losing
streak as they bombed Rochester,
114-78, in the opening round of
the Kodak Classic. The Indians
shot over 70 percent in the first
half on their way to a new Kodak
scoring record. Sophomore Claude
Terry led all scorers with 26 while
Palmer added 19. Consistent
forward Fred Green added 14.
The following night Stanford
took on Georgetown in the
championship game. Georgetown
pushed out to a 49-38 halftime
lead and coasted to a 101-81 win.
The Indians scored only three
fewer field goals than the Hoyas,
but once again they were
destroyed on free throws.
Terry had another fine night as
he scored 25 and Moore shook off
his bothersome injury problems
and added 18.
Lead Lost
After a short rest, the Tribe
started off the new year in
Cincinnati against the University
of Cincinnati Bearcats. Stanford
played extremely well as they led
by as many as 15 points in the
first half and held a 40-36

halftime lead. But the Indians'
shooting cooled off in the second
half and the Bearcats went ahead
57-55 with 10:30 left in the game.
Cincinnati guard Charlie Snow
sunk two free throws with a
minute left to ice the game,
79-74. Terry and O'Neill both had
17 points to pace the Indians.
This weekend the Indians
travel to the Northwest to open
Pac-8 league play against
Washington and Washington State.
The Huskies had been rated in the
top 1 0 in the nation in some polls,
but injuries may seriously hamper
them also.
Brilliant 6-9 sophomore Steve
Hawes and veteran guard Rafael
Stone are both out for up to six
â€¢weeks with hairline fractures of
the shin bone. With Hawes and
Stone, the Huskies compiled a
fine 9-2 preseason record, but
now they will have to lean heavily
on 6-5 forward George Irvine,
who is averaging better than 22
points per game.
Washington State also carries a
9-2 record into Pac-8 play. The
Cougars are led by two forwards,
Gary Elliot and Jim Meredith,
both of whom are averaging over
sixteen points per game. The
Cougars were hurt by the loss of
last year's leading scorer Ted
Wierman, but 6-8 JC transfer Jack
Bergersen has been doing a good
job.
Hough League
Stanford is stronger than its
2-7 record would indicate, but
unfortunately they play in
possibly the most talent-laden
conference in the nation. The
Indians have amazingly scored 46
more field goals than their
opponents, but they have been
hurt severely by fouls. Stanford's
opponents have hit on 100 more
free throws than the Tribe and
this has made the difference in
more than one game.
The loss of Rosenzweig means
that Stanford once agains goes
into conference play without a big
man. Stanford has two fine guards
in Terry and O'Neill who are
averaging 18.8 and 16.0 points
respectively. Fred Green has done
a fine job at one corner spot and
if Chuck Moore can shake off his
injury problems, the other
forward position would be set.
Still, without a big man, Stanford
fans will have to face another long
season.

Larry Rosenzweig, shooting here against Santa (.lara, is evidently out lor the
season with knee problems. The 6-10 center had been averaging 9.8 points for
the Tribe in the first four games. His absence leaves lull center responsibilities
on 6-7 senior Hill Palmer, who will have a lot of taller players to contend with as
the Pac-8 season gets underway.

Dennis O'Neill (42) tires a jump shot against Santa Clara in Stanford's 72-60 loss to the Broncos. O'Neill, averaging 16
points per game, is second high scorer behind sophomore Claude Terry, presently scoring at an 18.8 clip through the first
nine games. Forward Fred Green is third in the scoring column, hitting 10.4 points per game.
