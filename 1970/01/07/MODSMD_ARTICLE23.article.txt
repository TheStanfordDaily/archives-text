# Writers Needed
## 
### 
The ever-expanding Daily
sports staff has several openings
for talented scribes this quarter.
Anyone with a desire or
inclination to write sports should
attend the staff meeting at 4:30
Thursday in the Daily office.
Especially needed are reporters
for swimming, gymnastics, or
wrestling. No experience is
necessary. Those interested but
who are unable to attend
Thursday's meeting should
contact Fred Leeson at 327-2920
(x 626) or at the Daily (x 4632).
