While the Southern California
Trojans are busy savoring victory
in one of the dullest Rose Bowl
games ever played, football
honors are still being received in
Palo Alto as well as Los Angeles.
It was USC that knocked
Stanford out of the Rose Bowl
picture midway through the year,
and Tribe partisans parked in
front of TV sets throughout the
nation couldn't help but feel that
Jim Plunkett would have easily
clobbered the inept Michigan
team that the Trojans barely
defeated.
It's true, the Trojans did have
the talent and the luck (maybe
God really did letter at SC), but
Stanford individuals grabbed
almost as much ink during the
vacation as did the perennial
participants in the Rose Bowl.
Junior quarterback Plunkett
made the papers coast to coast in
announcing that he will return to

school next year for his final
season of eligibility. It had been
speculated that Jim would enter
the pro draft later this month.
His return ensures Stanford of
another year as a top contender
for the Pac-8 title. As the top
junior football player in the
country, he finished the season
third nationally in total offense,
and fifth in passing.
Plunkett also made news in
winning the Voit Award,
presented annually to the best
football player on the West Coast.
Senior linebacker Don Parish
joined in the glory, winning the
Warner Trophy as the outstanding

Senior football player on the
coast.
One member of the Stanford
team found glory in a foreign
position. Bubba Brown started in
the Shrine Bowl as a defensive
back, and came up with nine
tackles and numerous votes for
defensive player-of-the-game. It
was the first time in Brown's
Stanford career that he played
defense.
