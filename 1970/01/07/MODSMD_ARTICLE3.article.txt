# Budget Crisis
## More Federal Aid Necessary 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
"Stanford is in the midst of a
period of financial retrenchment
which may turn into a significant
academic retrenchment in the
years ahead unless a clearer policy
of federal interest evolves—and
soon."
This is the warning contained
in the 1969 Stanford Financial
Report distributed last month to
the campus community. The
report, sent also to congressmen
and federal officials, calls for
sharply expanded federal aid to
higher education, mainly through
direct financial aid to students.
Written by Kenneth
Cuthbertson, vice-president for
finance, the report recommends
a comprehensive program of
federal aid which might relieve the
present critical financial
conditions of most American
universities.
Among Cuthbertson's
proposals are direct federal
scholarships, a national "Student
Loan Bank," and increased tax
incentives for private gifts.
Stanford's financial troubles, as
the report emphasizes, are
especially serious. Stanford
announced last November a
cutback of $'2.5 million in
University expenditures over the
next four years, a decision which
financial officials claim is
"irreversible."
Construction Curtailment
"Some academic programs and
services simply will have to be
abandoned in order to properly
finance those which are to
continue," the report states.

Only recently, Provost Richard
Lyman warned that Stanford
faces a substantial curtailment of
new constructions because of
current freeze on federal funds.
Diminishing financial reserves
and federal research cutbacks are
blamed primarily for the budget
cuts. The report points out that
the University had to draw
$600,000 from reserves in
1968-69, and that amount is
expected to double in the present
financial year.
Research Cutbacks
With the exception of
inflationary forces, the report sees
federal research cutbacks as the
major factor in the decline in
Stanford's income growth.
Stanford lost over $2 million in
federal research contracts in 1968,
"probably $'2 million in 1969, and
perhaps $3 million this year," the
report states.
"Both the administration and
Congress have been making radical
cuts in the level of support for
basic research," Cuthbertson
writes in his report. "Worse yet,
the contest in Washington
between tax increases and
expenditure reductions has carried
into the fiscal year without
resolution so that uncertainty is
dominant.
"Fundamental research in
universities cannot be turned on
and off like watiT from a faucet,
yet the legislative appropriations
and administrative allocations
have tended to assume this. 1 he
universities are unable to make
projections of future financing.

Despite the announced cuts,
and a planned increase of $255 in
tuition for the 1970-71 year, the
report views the need for
expanded federal aid as "urgent."
"As this nation enters the
1970'5, an overall constructive
program is desperately needed for
higher education," Cuthbertson
claims.
The program he proposes
closely parallels in its major
suggestions one published last
year by the Carnegie Commission
on Higher Education. The report
suggests first a top-priority federal
program of direct grants to
students. The grants would assure
all college students with
demonstrated need some financial
aid to meet epenses at institutions
they select.
Freedom of Choice
The report concludes.
"Adequate scholarships to
individual students allow both an
important freedom of choice for
the student and a healthy
competition and pluralism in
higher education. Individual
institutions cannot provide this
level of support from existing
sources of funds; so a federal role
seems clear."
The report further proposes
that the federal government grant
cost-of-education supplements to
colleges and universities based on
the numbers of students holding
federal grants in each institution
Besides providing an incentive lot
recruiting promising studentf

from all income levels, the
supplements could be used by
institutions for general operations
costs.
Federal grants to universities
for innovative educational
programs are also strongly urged.
National Student Loan Bank
The third proposal is the
creation of a national student loan
bank, sponsored by the federal
government, which would
guarantee a loan to any student
who wanted one. "By not making
need a condition of eligibility, this
would give students greater
freedom of opportunity in
individual pursuits."
The need for the bank seems
clear. At Stanford, National
Defense Education Act loans have
risen from $650,000 in 1964-65
to approximately $1.4 million last
year. In addition, over 600
Stanford students applied for
private bank loans under a
federally guaranteed program.
Cu th bert son recommends,
fourth, continued government
sponsorship of University research
projects, arguing that such
sponsorship "has proven to be one
of the most effective means of
advancing knowledge in the
nation."
Itroiwler Research (irants
"A continuation of the trend
away from concentration of
research support in defense and
space agencies" is si.w.igiy
encouraged by the report.

thought the idea was worth wasting film on. There are unconfirmed rumors that both individuals were admitted to
Stanford on Cocoa hilfs and P.F. liver scholarships.
"Most important of all federal
policies," the report recommends,
"is the provision for tax incentives
to private philanthropy. Private
funds are essential to institutions
like Stanford but also to allow the
remarkable development of our
pluralistic system of higher
education. It is perhaps the best
example of a policy which
encourages competition and
innovation, and helps institutions
to help themselves."
In recent years, the report
declares, "The entire concept of
higher education has changed
from one of luxury to that of
necessity." Where only 50,000
students were enrolled in colleges
a century ago, today there are
over six million.
In the past two years, the
federal government has been
"equivocal" in its support of
higher education, the report
concludes. Indicative of the
support needed is the Carnegie
Commission estimate that federal
support levels should be tripled in
the next few years "if the federal
government is to assist state and
local governments and the private
sector in expanding higher
education as an essential
investment in the nation's
future."
University financial officials
are not optimistic about the
federal government's willingness
to make such a commitment.
Commented one official
yesterday, "The recent climate in
Washington has not been very
friendly to higher education "
"Stanford is in the midst of a
period of financial retrenchment
which may turn into a significant
academic retrenchment in the
years ahead unless a clearer policy

remarkable development of our
pluralistic system of higher
education. It is perhaps the best
example of a policy which
encourages competition and
innovation, and helps institutions
to help themselves."
In recent years, the report
declares, "The entire concept of
higher education has changed
from one of luxury to that of
necessity." Where only 50,000
students were enrolled in colleges
a century ago, today there are
over six million.
In the past two years, the
federal government has been
"equivocal" in its support of
higher education, the report
concludes. Indicative of the
support needed is the Carnegie
Commission estimate that federal
support levels should be tripled in
the next few years "if the federal
government is to assist state and
local governments and the private
sector in expanding higher
education as an essential
investment in the nation's
future."
University financial officials
are not optimistic about the
federal government's willingness
to make such a commitment.
Commented one official
yesterday, "The recent climate in
Washington has not been very
friendly to higher education "
"Stanford is in the midst of a
period of financial retrenchment
which may turn into a significant
academic retrenchment in the
years ahead unless a clearer policy
of federal interest evolves—and
soon."
This is the warning contained
in the 1969 Stanford Financial
Report distributed last month to
the campus community. The
report, sent also to congressmen
and federal officials, calls for
sharply expanded federal aid to
higher education, mainly through
direct financial aid to students.
Written by Kenneth
Cuthbertson, vice-president for
finance, the report recommends
a comprehensive program of
federal aid which might relieve the
present critical financial
conditions of most American
universities.
Among Cuthbertson's
proposals are direct federal
scholarships, a national "Student
Loan Bank," and increased tax
incentives for private gifts.
Stanford's financial troubles, as
the report emphasizes, are
especially serious. Stanford
announced last November a
cutback of $'2.5 million in
University expenditures over the
next four years, a decision which
financial officials claim is
"irreversible."
Construction Curtailment
"Some academic programs and
services simply will have to be
abandoned in order to properly
finance those which are to
continue," the report states.

Only recently, Provost Richard
Lyman warned that Stanford
faces a substantial curtailment of
new constructions because of
current freeze on federal funds.
Diminishing financial reserves
and federal research cutbacks are
blamed primarily for the budget
cuts. The report points out that
the University had to draw
$600,000 from reserves in
1968-69, and that amount is
expected to double in the present
financial year.
Research Cutbacks
With the exception of
inflationary forces, the report sees
federal research cutbacks as the
major factor in the decline in
Stanford's income growth.
Stanford lost over $2 million in
federal research contracts in 1968,
"probably $'2 million in 1969, and
perhaps $3 million this year," the
report states.
"Both the administration and
Congress have been making radical
cuts in the level of support for
basic research," Cuthbertson
writes in his report. "Worse yet,
the contest in Washington
between tax increases and
expenditure reductions has carried
into the fiscal year without
resolution so that uncertainty is
dominant.
"Fundamental research in
universities cannot be turned on
and off like watiT from a faucet,
yet the legislative appropriations
and administrative allocations
have tended to assume this. 1 he
universities are unable to make
projections of future financing.

Despite the announced cuts,
and a planned increase of $255 in
tuition for the 1970-71 year, the
report views the need for
expanded federal aid as "urgent."
"As this nation enters the
1970'5, an overall constructive
program is desperately needed for
higher education," Cuthbertson
claims.
The program he proposes
closely parallels in its major
suggestions one published last
year by the Carnegie Commission
on Higher Education. The report
suggests first a top-priority federal
program of direct grants to
students. The grants would assure
all college students with
demonstrated need some financial
aid to meet epenses at institutions
they select.
Freedom of Choice
The report concludes.
"Adequate scholarships to
individual students allow both an
important freedom of choice for
the student and a healthy
competition and pluralism in
higher education. Individual
institutions cannot provide this
level of support from existing
sources of funds; so a federal role
seems clear."
The report further proposes
that the federal government grant
cost-of-education supplements to
colleges and universities based on
the numbers of students holding
federal grants in each institution
Besides providing an incentive lot
recruiting promising studentf

from all income levels, the
supplements could be used by
institutions for general operations
costs.
Federal grants to universities
for innovative educational
programs are also strongly urged.
National Student Loan Bank
The third proposal is the
creation of a national student loan
bank, sponsored by the federal
government, which would
guarantee a loan to any student
who wanted one. "By not making
need a condition of eligibility, this
would give students greater
freedom of opportunity in
individual pursuits."
The need for the bank seems
clear. At Stanford, National
Defense Education Act loans have
risen from $650,000 in 1964-65
to approximately $1.4 million last
year. In addition, over 600
Stanford students applied for
private bank loans under a
federally guaranteed program.
Cu th bert son recommends,
fourth, continued government
sponsorship of University research
projects, arguing that such
sponsorship "has proven to be one
of the most effective means of
advancing knowledge in the
nation."
Itroiwler Research (irants
"A continuation of the trend
away from concentration of
research support in defense and
space agencies" is si.w.igiy
encouraged by the report.

thought the idea was worth wasting film on. There are unconfirmed rumors that both individuals were admitted to
Stanford on Cocoa hilfs and P.F. liver scholarships.

policies," the report recommends,
"is the provision for tax incentives
to private philanthropy. Private
funds are essential to institutions
like Stanford but also to allow the
remarkable development of our
pluralistic system of higher
education. It is perhaps the best

"Most important of all federal
policies," the report recommends,
"is the provision for tax incentives
to private philanthropy. Private
funds are essential to institutions
like Stanford but also to allow the
remarkable development of our
pluralistic system of higher
education. It is perhaps the best
example of a policy which
encourages competition and
innovation, and helps institutions
to help themselves."
In recent years, the report
declares, "The entire concept of
higher education has changed
from one of luxury to that of
necessity." Where only 50,000
students were enrolled in colleges
a century ago, today there are
over six million.
In the past two years, the
federal government has been
"equivocal" in its support of
higher education, the report
concludes. Indicative of the
support needed is the Carnegie
Commission estimate that federal
support levels should be tripled in
the next few years "if the federal
government is to assist state and
local governments and the private
sector in expanding higher
education as an essential
investment in the nation's
future."
University financial officials
are not optimistic about the
federal government's willingness
to make such a commitment.
Commented one official
yesterday, "The recent climate in
Washington has not been very
friendly to higher education "
"Stanford is in the midst of a
period of financial retrenchment
which may turn into a significant
academic retrenchment in the
years ahead unless a clearer policy
of federal interest evolves—and
soon."
This is the warning contained
in the 1969 Stanford Financial
Report distributed last month to
the campus community. The
report, sent also to congressmen
and federal officials, calls for
sharply expanded federal aid to
higher education, mainly through
direct financial aid to students.
Written by Kenneth
Cuthbertson, vice-president for
finance, the report recommends
a comprehensive program of
federal aid which might relieve the
present critical financial
conditions of most American
universities.
Among Cuthbertson's
proposals are direct federal
scholarships, a national "Student
Loan Bank," and increased tax
incentives for private gifts.
Stanford's financial troubles, as
the report emphasizes, are
especially serious. Stanford
announced last November a
cutback of $'2.5 million in
University expenditures over the
next four years, a decision which
financial officials claim is
"irreversible."
Construction Curtailment
"Some academic programs and
services simply will have to be
abandoned in order to properly
finance those which are to
continue," the report states.

Only recently, Provost Richard
Lyman warned that Stanford
faces a substantial curtailment of
new constructions because of
current freeze on federal funds.
Diminishing financial reserves
and federal research cutbacks are
blamed primarily for the budget
cuts. The report points out that
the University had to draw
$600,000 from reserves in
1968-69, and that amount is
expected to double in the present
financial year.
Research Cutbacks
With the exception of
inflationary forces, the report sees
federal research cutbacks as the
major factor in the decline in
Stanford's income growth.
Stanford lost over $2 million in
federal research contracts in 1968,
"probably $'2 million in 1969, and
perhaps $3 million this year," the
report states.
"Both the administration and
Congress have been making radical
cuts in the level of support for
basic research," Cuthbertson
writes in his report. "Worse yet,
the contest in Washington
between tax increases and
expenditure reductions has carried
into the fiscal year without
resolution so that uncertainty is
dominant.
"Fundamental research in
universities cannot be turned on
and off like watiT from a faucet,
yet the legislative appropriations
and administrative allocations
have tended to assume this. 1 he
universities are unable to make
projections of future financing.

Despite the announced cuts,
and a planned increase of $255 in
tuition for the 1970-71 year, the
report views the need for
expanded federal aid as "urgent."
"As this nation enters the
1970'5, an overall constructive
program is desperately needed for
higher education," Cuthbertson
claims.
The program he proposes
closely parallels in its major
suggestions one published last
year by the Carnegie Commission
on Higher Education. The report
suggests first a top-priority federal
program of direct grants to
students. The grants would assure
all college students with
demonstrated need some financial
aid to meet epenses at institutions
they select.
Freedom of Choice
The report concludes.
"Adequate scholarships to
individual students allow both an
important freedom of choice for
the student and a healthy
competition and pluralism in
higher education. Individual
institutions cannot provide this
level of support from existing
sources of funds; so a federal role
seems clear."
The report further proposes
that the federal government grant
cost-of-education supplements to
colleges and universities based on
the numbers of students holding
federal grants in each institution
Besides providing an incentive lot
recruiting promising studentf

from all income levels, the
supplements could be used by
institutions for general operations
costs.
Federal grants to universities
for innovative educational
programs are also strongly urged.
National Student Loan Bank
The third proposal is the
creation of a national student loan
bank, sponsored by the federal
government, which would
guarantee a loan to any student
who wanted one. "By not making
need a condition of eligibility, this
would give students greater
freedom of opportunity in
individual pursuits."
The need for the bank seems
clear. At Stanford, National
Defense Education Act loans have
risen from $650,000 in 1964-65
to approximately $1.4 million last
year. In addition, over 600
