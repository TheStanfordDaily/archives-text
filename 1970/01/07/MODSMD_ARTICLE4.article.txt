# Cost Overrun To Slow Coyote Hill Construction
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Super-high bids for
construction of the planned
animal research facility on Coyote
Hill have set the project back, but
apparently won't stop eventual
completion of the complex on the
easterly flank of the hill.
Robert Lindee, associate dean
of administration at the Medical
School, said that the project is
still "very alive." However, he is
currently analyzing the cost
over-run with representatives of
the University, Syntex
Corporation and the architect.
The National Institute of
Health (NIH) had earlier approved
a grant of $281,000 to construct
the $600,000 facility. Syntex, a
pharmaceutical firm specializing
in birth control pills, had also
agreed to share about $100,000 of
the building costs in return for

using part of the facilities which it
would lease.
Lindee declined to specify how
much the construction bids,
opened in late November, had
exceeded the estimated costs of
the project.
Reports indicated the costs
were about 20 to 30 percent
higher; one report indicated they
were as much as $900,000.
Unrevealed Reasons
The exact reasons for the price
rise haven't been revealed.
Possible items include rising
building costs, delays in releasing
the bids, and increasing prices in
the trades important to the
project.
Asked whether the project
would be doomed by the high
costs, Lindee said, "I honestly
don't know. We will have to do
some modifications to bring (the
costs) down."

He insists that it is only an
"impediment." The Medical
School is convinced, according to
Lindee, that the project can be
"salvaged to a tolerable degree."
Under the original agreement
with Syntex, the University
agreed to build two "separate
identifiable .. . but somewhat
similar units" for the two research
groups, with a third area for joint
use.
Possible Reduction
Any alteration in those plans
could mean a subsequent
reduction in the NIH grant if the
building space is reduced. Lindee
said last night that there is
"absolutely zero" possibility that
the governmental agency might
increase their grant to cover the
costs.
Lindee said a recent lawsuit
filed by the Committee for Green
Foothills against an industrial
subdivision by Stanford around
the base of the hill "hasn't
hampered the project."
Committee officers said they
didn't intend the suit to affect the
research facility.
The Medical School plans to
release a statement later this week
giving at least a tentative
indication of their plans.

Lindee said a recent lawsuit
filed by the Committee for Green
Foothills against an industrial
subdivision by Stanford around
the base of the hill "hasn't
hampered the project."
Committee officers said they
didn't intend the suit to affect the
research facility.
The Medical School plans to
release a statement later this week
giving at least a tentative
indication of their plans.

the Board of Trustees finance committee, liraunstein says that President Pit'/.er
is keeping him on probation in order to block the nomination. He intends to
take the matter to the student Senate meeting tomorrow night.
Super-high bids for
construction of the planned
animal research facility on Coyote
Hill have set the project back, but
apparently won't stop eventual
completion of the complex on the
easterly flank of the hill.
Robert Lindee, associate dean
of administration at the Medical
School, said that the project is
still "very alive." However, he is
currently analyzing the cost
over-run with representatives of
the University, Syntex
Corporation and the architect.
The National Institute of
Health (NIH) had earlier approved
a grant of $281,000 to construct
the $600,000 facility. Syntex, a
pharmaceutical firm specializing
in birth control pills, had also
agreed to share about $100,000 of
the building costs in return for

using part of the facilities which it
would lease.
Lindee declined to specify how
much the construction bids,
opened in late November, had
exceeded the estimated costs of
the project.
Reports indicated the costs
were about 20 to 30 percent
higher; one report indicated they
were as much as $900,000.
Unrevealed Reasons
The exact reasons for the price
rise haven't been revealed.
Possible items include rising
building costs, delays in releasing
the bids, and increasing prices in
the trades important to the
project.
Asked whether the project
would be doomed by the high
costs, Lindee said, "I honestly
don't know. We will have to do
some modifications to bring (the
costs) down."

He insists that it is only an
"impediment." The Medical
School is convinced, according to
Lindee, that the project can be
"salvaged to a tolerable degree."
Under the original agreement
with Syntex, the University
agreed to build two "separate
identifiable .. . but somewhat
similar units" for the two research
groups, with a third area for joint
use.
Possible Reduction
Any alteration in those plans
could mean a subsequent
reduction in the NIH grant if the
building space is reduced. Lindee
said last night that there is
"absolutely zero" possibility that
the governmental agency might
increase their grant to cover the
costs.
Lindee said a recent lawsuit
filed by the Committee for Green
Foothills against an industrial
subdivision by Stanford around
the base of the hill "hasn't
