## Daley Testifies At Riot Trial 
### 
CHICAGO (AP)—Chicago's Mayor
Richard J. Daley testified
Tuesday, during a stormy session
of the Chicago Seven conspiracy
trial, that he told all city officials
prior to the 1968 Democratic
National Convention to be
cooperative with everyone.
Daley, called as a defuse
witness, was excused after two
hours on the stand by a defense
attorney who claimed he could
not pre", 'ly examine the mayor
because of the judge's rulings.
Judge Julius J. Hoffman of
U.S. District Court ruled
repeatedly that William M.
Kunstler was asking leading
questions of Daley.
Daley testified that he told all
city officials to be cooperative
with everyone who wanted
permits during convention week.
Thomas A. Foran, U.S. district
attorney, made more than 75
objections to questions asked of
Daley by Kunstler.

Foran asked only two
questions in cross examination:
"In any conversation did you
ever suggest to anyone that parade
permits be denied to
demonstrators during convention
week."
"No," Daley said.
"In any conversations did you
ever suggest to anyone that
permits to sleep in the park be
denied."
"No," Daley said.
Kunstler, who is defending the
seven men accused of crossing
state lines to incite rioting during
the convention, was continually
admonished by Judge Hoffman to
ask proper questions.
Twice Hoffman denied
motions that the mayor be
declared a hostile witness.
Siiio-SoviW Split
MOSCOW (AP)—The Soviet press
accused Communist China

Tuesday of making "war
preparations" and making
"malicious attacks" on other
Communist countries.
The accusations, made by the
Communist organ Pravda and the
official news agency Tass, marked
a new step in the gradual
resumption of Soviet criticism of
Peking. Attacks against China
dropped off when border
negotiations began Oct. 20 in
Peking, but increased along with
signs that no progress was being
made in the talks.
God Not Dead?
LOS ANGELES (AP)-Plans for a
$l-million expedition to recover
timbers believed to be the remains
of Noah's Ark from a frozen lake
on Mt. Ararat in Turkey were
announced Tuesday by a team of
scientists and explorers.
Ralph E. Crawford, president
of Search Foundation Inc.,
Washington, D.C., told a news
conference several pieces of
hand-tooled wood more than
4,000 years old had been found in
an ice pack near the 14,000-foot
level on the 17,000-foot mountain
in northeast Turkey near the
Soviet Border.
Reports of the presence of a
large vessel high on Mt. Ararat
have persisted for centuries. The
prow of a ship was seen jutting fro
an ice pack by avalanche work
teams in 1810, and commercial
pilots have reported seeing a
ship-like shadow in the ice near
the top of the mountain.

Reagan Speech
SACRAMENTO (AP)-Gov.
Reagan told Californians Tuesday
that "the tone and spirit of the
70s must be on quality" of life,
and challenged them to "ask what
we can do for ourselves."
The new decade, Reagan said
in his annual "state of the state"
speech, "stirs our souls for a new
spirit . . . Our task for the 70s is
not more government, but better
government."
However, Reagan listed as his
own legislative proposals for the
year, stressing preservation of
California's priceless natural
environment, and protection of its
citizens from high taxes, dishonest
businessmen and drug dealers.
"If the young people are really
looking for action—constructive
action which can make the decade
of the 70s a benchmark in man's
search for a better world—they
can find it by working within the
system, reforming it, making it
more responsive to the citizenry,
and helping to get it out of our
pockets and off our backs."
His most specific proposals
came in the area of environment.
He urged passage of an
omnibus clean air law stiffening
antismog laws to preserve the
"magic of California." In
addition, "we must seriously
consider whether propulsion
systems other than the internal
combustion engine are practical,"
Reagan said.

LOS ANGELES (AP)-Plans for a
$l-million expedition to recover
timbers believed to be the remains
of Noah's Ark from a frozen lake
on Mt. Ararat in Turkey were
announced Tuesday by a team of
scientists and explorers.
Ralph E. Crawford, president
of Search Foundation Inc.,
Washington, D.C., told a news
conference several pieces of
hand-tooled wood more than
4,000 years old had been found in
an ice pack near the 14,000-foot
level on the 17,000-foot mountain
in northeast Turkey near the
Soviet Border.
Reports of the presence of a
large vessel high on Mt. Ararat
have persisted for centuries. The
prow of a ship was seen jutting fro
an ice pack by avalanche work
teams in 1810, and commercial
pilots have reported seeing a
ship-like shadow in the ice near
the top of the mountain.

Reagan Speech
SACRAMENTO (AP)-Gov.
Reagan told Californians Tuesday
that "the tone and spirit of the
70s must be on quality" of life,
and challenged them to "ask what
we can do for ourselves."
The new decade, Reagan said
in his annual "state of the state"
speech, "stirs our souls for a new
spirit . . . Our task for the 70s is
not more government, but better
government."
However, Reagan listed as his
own legislative proposals for the
year, stressing preservation of
California's priceless natural
environment, and protection of its
citizens from high taxes, dishonest
businessmen and drug dealers.
"If the young people are really
looking for action—constructive
action which can make the decade
of the 70s a benchmark in man's
search for a better world—they
can find it by working within the
system, reforming it, making it
more responsive to the citizenry,
and helping to get it out of our
pockets and off our backs."
His most specific proposals
came in the area of environment.
He urged passage of an
omnibus clean air law stiffening
antismog laws to preserve the
"magic of California." In
addition, "we must seriously
consider whether propulsion
systems other than the internal
combustion engine are practical,"
Reagan said.
CHICAGO (AP)—Chicago's Mayor
Richard J. Daley testified
Tuesday, during a stormy session
of the Chicago Seven conspiracy
trial, that he told all city officials
prior to the 1968 Democratic
National Convention to be
cooperative with everyone.
Daley, called as a defuse
witness, was excused after two
hours on the stand by a defense
attorney who claimed he could
not pre", 'ly examine the mayor
because of the judge's rulings.
Judge Julius J. Hoffman of
U.S. District Court ruled
repeatedly that William M.
Kunstler was asking leading
questions of Daley.
Daley testified that he told all
city officials to be cooperative
with everyone who wanted
permits during convention week.
Thomas A. Foran, U.S. district
attorney, made more than 75
objections to questions asked of
Daley by Kunstler.

Foran asked only two
questions in cross examination:
"In any conversation did you
ever suggest to anyone that parade
permits be denied to
demonstrators during convention
week."
"No," Daley said.
"In any conversations did you
ever suggest to anyone that
permits to sleep in the park be
denied."
"No," Daley said.
Kunstler, who is defending the
seven men accused of crossing
state lines to incite rioting during
the convention, was continually
admonished by Judge Hoffman to
ask proper questions.
Twice Hoffman denied
motions that the mayor be
declared a hostile witness.
