. Some people, who are not
fa/niliar with the Arab-Israeli
conflict, may mistakenly believe
that the right of self
daiermination for the Palestinians
of the main aims of Arab
nationalists at this time. In fact,
tljjis basic right has already been
accepted by most Israelis. On the
opier hand, the 1947 U.N.
resolution on the partition of
Pfflestine, which called for the
establishment of independent
Jfevish and Arab states, resulted in
thi? May 15, 1948 invasion by the
Afcabs of the just-proclaimed State
of Israel. Following their failure
to. conquer the new-born Jewish
tte, Egypt and Jordan annexed
t portion of Palestine which
U.N. Partition Plan had
ginally allocated to the
proposed Palestinian-Arab State.
Since then, Palestinian Arabs who
hj£ve accepted the idea of an
independent Palestinian-Arab
tte coexisting peacefully with
Israeli neighbor have been
eled as minimalists and traitors.
L In his address to the nation in
1962, Nasser specifically
Asserted that the main problem
f&ced by Arab nationalism at the
present time was the achievement
Of a land continuum "from the
Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian
©ulf." Millions of Kurds and
$outh Sudan Africans as well as
fsraelis and many other minorities
Ui the Middle East have already
become the victims of this Arab
pationalist "concern." In this
context, it is quite hard to
Understand the new slogan of
Arab propaganda which speaks of
J'multiracial unification of the
homeland." This phrase, coined
jecently for foreign consumption,
was stated as an Arab claim by
Miss Pat Mihaly in her December
p letter to the Stanford Daily. To
petter understand what the Arabs
fn e a n by ''multiracial
iinification," let us examine the
"Palestinian National Charter"
signed by all Palestinian
nationalist organizations at their
Fourth Congress held in Cairo
between the 10th and 17th of
July, 1968. This is the only
official statement of ideological
vie.ws and political positions

endorsed by all of these
organizations.
Palestinians
Article 1 of the Charter reads:
"Palestine is the homeland of the
Palestinian ARAB nation. It is a
part of the large Arab homeland."
Article 2 makes clear that the area
now called Israel is also a part of
this homeland. And Article 5
states: "Palestinians are ARAB
citizens who lived in Palestine
until 1947." One can imagine the
fate of the 2.5 million Israeli Jews
in this "multiracial homeland" of
the 1.5 million Arabs. Article 6
makes the magnanimous promise
that "the Jews who lived
PERMANENTLY in Palestine
before the beginning of the
Zionist invasion will be allowed to
stay and take, if they wish,
Palestinian citizenship." For this
purpose, "the beginning of the
Zionist invasion" is defined on
page 51 of Commentaries to the
Charter as "the year of 1917."
The Palestinian nationalist
organizations, and the A 1 Fatah in
particular, obviously feel that the
meaning of "multiracial
homeland" is adequately
expressed in the promise that a
fraction of Israel's Jewish
population will neither be
expelled nor exterminated. But
even these few "privileged" Jews
would be doomed to national
extinction within the bounderies
of the "multinational homeland."
Article 20 is quite explicit in this
respect. It postulates that the
concept and status of Jewish or
Israeli nationality will cease to
exist.
Democratic Union
To claim that the "Palestinian
National Charter" offers a bona
fide "multiracial solution" is
either cynical or naive. Yet, Miss
Mihaly's proposal for an
Is r a e 1 i - P a 1 e s t in i a n Arab
democratic union, if it is to be
accepted as genuine, may be
worth giving more serious
consideration, particularly in view
of the fact that a similar
4 ' J e w is h - Arab federation"
proposal is currently discussed
among some Israeli intellectuals.
In any event, a basic prerequisite
for such a "unification" is the
acceptance by both nations of the
reality of each other's existence
and of the idea that they can live
together in peace. Which brings us
to Miss Mihaly's last contention,
namely that the Arab nationalists
will NEVER accept the idea of an

independent Israel and will
continue their fight for her
destruction. As much as we would
like to disprove this claim, we are
not sure that we can. The forty
years-long history of Arab
nationalist beligerency against
Jews, Kurds, Assyrians, Copts and
South Sudan Africans provides
undisputable physical proof in
support of Miss Mihaly's
statement. And that makes it
amount to no more than a
ludicrous proposal to sacrifice
Israelis for the sake of "peace."
This position cannot but
remind us of a similar argument
advanced in 1938 by some British
intellectuals, who were in favor of
Czechoslovakia's handing over the
Sudetenland to Hitler, whose
plans were known to include the
ultimate conquest of the entire
country. Today, on the threshold
of 1970, it should be clear to all
that Israel's desire to exist is by
no means weaker than the
dedication of Arab nationalists to
the cause of her destruction.
War on Poverty
We believe, however, that
peace in the Middle East CAN be
achieved. Apart from the need to

put an end to senseless bloodshed,
peace is made imperative by the
necessity to embark on all-out war
against the backwardness and
poverty plageuing vast portions of
the region. For, despite their
being the richest oil producers in
the world, the Arab countries of
the Middle East spend most of
their national income on
maintaining their military
capability.
The achievement of peace will
clearly require "inconvenient"
compromises by both sides, and
above all—the mutual recognition
of physical and national existence.
At first, and perhaps initially
insignificant, step in this direction
could be a face-to-face dialogue
between Arab and Israeli students
in foreign countries. University
campuses, such as Stanford, could
serve as ideal places for meetings
of this kind.
Young Arab and Israeli
intellectuals, some of whom will
probably be tomorrow's leaders of
their respective countries, would
be ill-advised not to avail
themselves of this opportunity for
a direct and hopefully
constructive exchange of views.
