## The 						Egg-Cream Speaks! 
### J. Eustace Tilly 
Editor's note: This is the story
behind the story which appeared,
incomplete, in a large number of
newspapers around the world. The
Daily is releasing this account,
obtained from our Middle East
correspondent, as a public service.
We print the story exactly as
received from our correspondent:
Two weeks ago, a slight,
middle-aged balding man carrying
an unlighted cigar and smelling
slightly of garlic paced
apprehensively back and forth in
front of a humble but clean
delicatessen in downtown Tel
Aviv. He checked furtively around
him, and then darted into the
store. He approached the young
lad at the counter, and this
conversation ensued:

Counterboy: Shalom, ess, essy,
keep up your strength.
Man: Shalom. Do you have
dietetic pastrami?
Counterboy (with
recognition): We've just gotten a
shipment.
Man: Give me an egg-cream,
please.
The Counterboy reached
beneath the counter, took out a
huge pastrami sandwich and an
egg-cream in a short glass, handed
them to the man. Quickly taking
the sandwich and drink, the man
hurried to a dimly-lit back table,
opened the sandwich and took
out a photograph, held the
egg-cream to his ear, and pushed a
peppercorn. A pleasant masculine
voice came out of the egg-cream.

Egg-cream: Shalom, Mr.
Cohen. The structure you are
looking at is a radar station built
for our enemies by an eastern
European dictatorship, which, as
you know, seeks to provoke
another war for its own gain.
These stations have been giving
our pilots all kinds of tsuris,
believe me. If it wasn't for the
farmisht gunners they've got, it
would really be ach in uay. Our
intelligence has discovered that
new gunners are being sent to
these stations bordering the Suez
Canal, and since their radar will
detect us, well, you can imagine
what will happen. Our only
chance will be to discover how to
jam these radar installations. It
would be a machia you should

help us. Your mission, Chaim,
should you decide to accept it,
would be to capture one of these
7-ton radar stations and bring it
back to Israel. Maybe take two, if
they're small. As usual, should
you or any of your Chutzpah
Mission Force be caught or
captured, Moshe will deny any
knowledge of your actions. Be
careful, Chaim. Mazel Tov. This
egg-cream will self-destruct in five
seconds.
Chaim put down the
egg-cream, and began munching
on the pastrami sandwich. Eight
and a half-seconds later, the
egg-cream went up in a puff of
vaporized chicken soup. Taking a
tattered envelope marked
"C.M.F." in blue letters on a
white field from his pocket,
Chaim glanced around the
delicatessen to be certain he was
alone. The counterboy had pulled
the blinds and put a sign outside,
Don't Come In, Spy At Work.
Nodding, Chaim thumbed through
the pictures in the envelope,
pulling out several, including a
grandmotherly type with gray hair
tied up in a bun, holding a bowl
of chicken soup; a tailor with a
gold tooth and wire-rim
spectacles; a beautiful girl in
kibbutz farm clothes. He jotted
some notes to himself, to get
some acetylene torches wholesale
from his wife's cousin, to call his
nephew the colonel to get some
helicopters, and to ask his brother
the contractor to lend him a
bulldozer for the weekend.
Putting away pictures, notes, and
the singed egg-cream, Chaim lit his
cigar, nodded to the counterboy,
and quickly left the delicatessen.
Editor's note (again): The rest
of the story from our
correspondent is the same one
you undoubtedly read in the
weekend papers concerning a
certain radar station which
somehow is now Israeli property.
