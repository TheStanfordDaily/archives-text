# Activists Discuss Land-Use Protest
## 
### JOHN BOWEN 
Meeting as an "educational
forum" last night, Grass Roots, an
ecologically-oriented organization,
discussed both long-range
environmental trends and
immediate development proposals
for Stanford University lands.
The meeting's purpose was to
enlist general community support
for its activities. It also issued a
call for participation in a protest
march and rally, to be held next
Monday, Jan. 12, at the
Dillingham site, the corner of El
Camino and Page Mill Road.
In reference to the proposed
construction of the financial
center Mike Sweeney, one of the
organizers, called on Stanford not
to "sign the lease; they should
stop and let the people decide."
Judy Strasser, moderator for
the forum, focused the discussion
on "the problems that have
originated with land-use policies,
specifically in the Mid-peninsula
area, problems caused in large part
by Stanford University."
Housing Shortages
A film tour of Stanford lands
followed, narrated by Paul
Rupert. Rupert emphasized the
historical technological
dominance in land-use decisions at
Stanford, viewing them as
manifest in present housing
shortages, ecological disasters, and
the existence of a large war
economy in Santa Clara county.
Rupert then surveyed present
and proposed housing projects,
and showed their prices to be well
above the means of students,
staff, and many Industrial Park
workers necessitating mass
commutation from as far as 50
miles away.
"These decisions," he
concluded, "have been made on
the basis of what profit could be
made from those lands for
Stanford University."
East Palo Alto
Joan Saunders then testified to
the high rents and inadequate

housing in East Palo Alto, and to
the inability of present federal
programs to remedy the situation.
Marshall Johnson and Ned
Groth placed the specific
problems of Stanford land use
within the context of the general
ecological decay within the
country. Citing both population
growth and fast rises in per capita
production of polluting elements,
they noted that Santa Clara
county is exhibiting the second
fastest growth rate in the nation,
with the accompanying
environmental decay.
Vic von Schlegell charged that
Stanford and other similar
population groups are "acting in a
vacuum" in their decision-making,
placing top priority on the
immediate financial needs of the
University, rather than on the
social and environmental needs of
the area.
