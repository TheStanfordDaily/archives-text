## Mumbo Jumbo 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON—Most airports
are getting ready to handle the
new Boeing 747 jumbo jet which
accommodates 400 people. The
only airport that seems to be
dragging its heels and has done
nothing to improve its facilities to
receive the new transportation
marvel is Havana,
Worried officials from Boeing,
the major airlines and pilots'
associations have been in constant
conference trying to figure out
ways of getting Castro to get
cracking on his airport facilities.
At a meeting the other day, an
airline executive said, "I don't see
how we can fly the 747 between
New York and Miami if the
Havana airport is not capable of
handling our jets."
Havana Landing Strip
"It seems to me that Castro is
being very stubborn," another
airline executive complained. "He
knows our government won't
permit the 747 jumbo jets to fly
between Oklahoma City and
Atlanta unless the Havana landing
strip is improved."
"Carlson here has just been to
Havana to talk to Castro. What
were the results of your
negotiations?"
Carlson said, "It took me three
days to see Castro. Finally, he
received me, and I explained the
problem. I pointed out that the
entire airline industry of the
United States was at stake and
appealed to him to make it
possible for us to put the 747 in
service.
Busiest Air Terminal
"But Castro said it wasn't his
problem and we should have
consulted him before we started
building the jumbo jets. He
pointed out that besides normal
airline traffic, the hijackings made
Havana the busiest air terminal in
the world and all his facilities are
overtaxed."
"Did you tell him that we were
willing to make a large
contribution toward lengthening
his runway and improving his
baggage-handling facilities?"

"Yes, but he said that it would
still cost him a lot of money
because all the hijacked planes are
unscheduled and he never knows
when they will land. He feels he
can't keep Cuban airline terminal
employees hanging around waiting
to handle a hijacked planeload of
passengers."
"He's being unreasonable," a
Boeing man said. "He knows we
can't schedule hijacked planes.
Did you tell him we'd subsidize
him by giving him air mail
contracts on the hijacked planes?"
Subsidize Castro?
"Yes. He liked that. But he
pointed out that he also has to
handle air traffic of hijacked
planes from South America, and
even if the Americans gave him a
subsidy, he will still be going in a
hole with planes flying in from
Venezuela, Bolivia and Brazil.
Castro said he wasn't against
civilian aviation, it was just the
suspense of not knowing when the
planes were coming that was
getting his control tower down."
"He's got us by the hair. If we
don't persuade him to get ready
for the 747, the CAB may not
give us permission to fly it."
Recognize Castro's Regime
Carlson told the meeting,
"Castro said the only way we
could get him to lengthen the
runway and enlarge the airline
terminal was to recognize his
government."
"Impossible. The U.S.
government would never allow
it."
"That's what I told him. I said
even the health of Boeing
Aircraft's stock couldn't get the
government to budge on
recognition."
"What are we going to do?"
Carlson said, "I came up with a
compromise solution. I suggested
that if the U.S. government
doesn't recornize Castro's
government, perhaps it would
recognize the Havana airport."
"Did he go for it?"
"He did. Now all we have to do
is persuade Nixon."

contribution toward lengthening
his runway and improving his
baggage-handling facilities?"

"Yes, but he said that it would
still cost him a lot of money
because all the hijacked planes are
unscheduled and he never knows
when they will land. He feels he
can't keep Cuban airline terminal
employees hanging around waiting
to handle a hijacked planeload of
passengers."
"He's being unreasonable," a
Boeing man said. "He knows we
can't schedule hijacked planes.
Did you tell him we'd subsidize
him by giving him air mail
contracts on the hijacked planes?"
Subsidize Castro?
"Yes. He liked that. But he
pointed out that he also has to
handle air traffic of hijacked
planes from South America, and
even if the Americans gave him a
subsidy, he will still be going in a
hole with planes flying in from
Venezuela, Bolivia and Brazil.
Castro said he wasn't against
civilian aviation, it was just the
suspense of not knowing when the
planes were coming that was
getting his control tower down."
"He's got us by the hair. If we
don't persuade him to get ready
for the 747, the CAB may not
give us permission to fly it."
Recognize Castro's Regime
Carlson told the meeting,
"Castro said the only way we
could get him to lengthen the
runway and enlarge the airline
terminal was to recognize his
government."
"Impossible. The U.S.
government would never allow
it."
"That's what I told him. I said
even the health of Boeing
Aircraft's stock couldn't get the
government to budge on
recognition."
"What are we going to do?"
Carlson said, "I came up with a
compromise solution. I suggested
that if the U.S. government
doesn't recornize Castro's
government, perhaps it would
recognize the Havana airport."
"Did he go for it?"
"He did. Now all we have to do
is persuade Nixon."
WASHINGTON—Most airports
are getting ready to handle the
new Boeing 747 jumbo jet which
accommodates 400 people. The
only airport that seems to be
dragging its heels and has done
nothing to improve its facilities to
receive the new transportation
marvel is Havana,
Worried officials from Boeing,
the major airlines and pilots'
associations have been in constant
conference trying to figure out
ways of getting Castro to get
cracking on his airport facilities.
At a meeting the other day, an
airline executive said, "I don't see
how we can fly the 747 between
New York and Miami if the
Havana airport is not capable of
handling our jets."
Havana Landing Strip
"It seems to me that Castro is
being very stubborn," another
airline executive complained. "He
knows our government won't
permit the 747 jumbo jets to fly
between Oklahoma City and
Atlanta unless the Havana landing
strip is improved."
"Carlson here has just been to
Havana to talk to Castro. What
were the results of your
negotiations?"
Carlson said, "It took me three
days to see Castro. Finally, he
received me, and I explained the
problem. I pointed out that the
entire airline industry of the
United States was at stake and
appealed to him to make it
possible for us to put the 747 in
service.
Busiest Air Terminal
"But Castro said it wasn't his
problem and we should have
consulted him before we started
building the jumbo jets. He
pointed out that besides normal
airline traffic, the hijackings made
Havana the busiest air terminal in
the world and all his facilities are
overtaxed."
"Did you tell him that we were
willing to make a large
contribution toward lengthening
his runway and improving his
baggage-handling facilities?"

"Yes, but he said that it would
still cost him a lot of money
because all the hijacked planes are
unscheduled and he never knows
when they will land. He feels he
