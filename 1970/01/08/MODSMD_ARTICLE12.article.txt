## Jarvis Holds First Lecture 
### JOHN COONROD 
"If everyone in NASA had
been meditators, we would have
been on the moon years ago."
Jerry Jarvis, teacher of
transendental meditation told a
crowd of 350 in the art
auditorium Tuesday night.
Seated center stage, Jaryis
presented a two-hour
introductory lecture concerning
the possibilities of meditation.
Meditation, he explained, is a
mechanical method of obtaining a
fourth state of consciousness, a
state separate from waking,
sleeping, and deep sleep. "You
transcend through subtler and
subtler levels of thought until you
reach the source of thought."
Jarvis stated that man must
meditate as a way of dealing with
problems "not on the level of

problems." The quality of life, he
said, is rapidly deteriorating
because of tension and
frustration. If people would
meditate twice daily, they would
not be tense or frustrated, their
physical problems would
normalize, and they would be able
to tap a source of infinite creative
energy, he added.
In answer to a question
concerning the term "infinite,"
Jarvis quoted the Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi, "Infinite energy
must be expressed in an infinite
way." He said that while a
meditating athlete could not
throw a ball infinitely far, his life
quality as a whole would improve.
Further, he said, improvement
would be balanced, and not at the
expense of some other part of life.

Jarvis is currently teaching a
new undergraduate special on the
"Science of Creative Intelligence."
He studied meditation with the
Maharishi in India, and currently
works from the transcendental
meditation center in Berkeley.
Meditation is a completely
natural function, as natural as
breathing, according to Jarvis,
only one has to be put on to it.
To start meditation, one must
have four introductory sessions,
the first an initiation at the
Berkeley center. Neophites are
requested to donate $35, ($75 for
adult non students) to the center
to help spread meditation.
Before one starts meditation,
the center requests that he abstain
from marijuana and other drugs
for at least fifteen days "for
physiological considerations."
Jarvis said the beginner should use
his own good jud gme nt
concerning "cafein, nicotine, bad
air and the poison in vegetables."
Jarvis said that if one percent
of the world population were
meditators, their improved life
and influence would give the
world infinite energy and

opportunity for goodness. At the
present rate of growth in the
United States, doubling every year
for the past three years, a good
world quota could be reached by
1983. He said that the demand for
teachers in the United States is so
large that the Maharishi is coming
this summer to conduct two one
month courses to train teachers.
Currently half the students in the
Maharishi's classes in India are
American.
Jarvis related a story of a heart
researcher whose studies show
that a meditator's blood pressure
lowers, and thus improves his
chances against heart disease. He
said that meditation will give a
person improvement in nearly any
physical problem.
It takes a person five years to
completely get into meditation,
he said, but a meditator will
experience results after his first
sitting.
Jarvis's second lecture, next
Tuesday night in the art
auditorium at 8, will concern the
mechanics of meditation, and will
further discuss how one can start
lessons. The series of lectures is
open to the public and is free.
