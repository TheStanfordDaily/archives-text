# Nairobi Recruits For Chicanos
## 
### 
Aaron Manganiello, director of
the Veneceremos campus of
Nairobi College, announced
Monday that seventeen students
from Canada College in Redwood
City had been "recruited" to
register at the new campus,
designed primarily for
Mexican-Americans.
The new campus for Chicanos,
"Veneceremos" named from the
Spanish word meaning "We shall
overcome," will be located
upstairs in a building at Douglas
and Fair Oaks Avenues in Palo
Alto, which is also the site of the
PROBE Community Center.
Classes will also be held in service
centers and private homes.
Manganiello announced that
100 students had already
registered, thirty of these for the

Mexican-American program Two
Sierra High School teachers,
whose names have not yet been
announced, have been contacted
to teach at the college.
Courses for the Veneceremos
campus will include the history of
the Mexican revolution, Latin
American politics, and other
standard curricula such as English,
history, and mathematics.
The new campus was opened
because of a $10,000 donation
from the Field Foundation of
New York City, a family
foundation.
Manganiello also announced
the extension of the registration
deadline to this Friday, and that
classes on both campuses would
begin Monday.
