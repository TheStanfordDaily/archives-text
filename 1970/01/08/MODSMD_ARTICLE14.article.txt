# People's Parkers Picket Parking
## 
### 
The western portion of the
"People's Park" opened for
business as a parking lot during
Christmas vacation, and was
promptly surrounded by a picket
line.
Demonstrators, who have been
picketing the site daily since
Parking Company of America
opened it for business last
Tuesday, have asked drivers not to
park in the lot as a sign of
continued support for a
community—owned park on the
site at Haste and Bowditch.
The fencing of the
user-developed park, created by
area residents last spring, led to a
riot in which Alameda County
sheriffs fired on spectators, killing
one and injuring many more.
Lease
Parking Company of America,
on Orange County—based firm
with parking lots in seventeen
states, was the highest of three
bidders for the lot, according to
University spokesmen.
The University, leased the
western half of the disputed lot,
which was not actually used in the
park, for five years to the firm.
The University retained the
option to terminate the agreement
at any time, so they can begin
construction of apartments now
being planned for the site.
University real estate officer
Richard F. Hartsook, who
negotiated the lease, said the rent
will be $800 a month or a
percentage of the gross receipts,
whichever is greater.
Parking in one of the 116
spaces will cost 50 cents per day.
Merchan Is
Use of the facility has been
minimal since the official opening.
During the first day of operation,
reporters saw no cars in the lot
except that of a company official.
A half dozen vehicles were seen
in the lot the following day.
According to one of the picket
organizer, a check of Motor
Vehicle Department records
showed some of these cars
belonged to South Campus area
merchants.
Hartsook said he felt the
University was performing a
community service by leasing the
lot, citing several requests by area
merchants and the city of
Berkeley for additional parking in
the area.
The city is closing its lot at
Channing and Telegraph to build a
multi—story parking structure on
the site.
Police
Even though police have kept a
heavy guard on the new lot,
damage was done to two cars
parked there last week.

Berkeley police arrested one
man last Wednesday, charging him
with malicious mischief and illegal
posting of bills. The person
arrested had reportedly tried to
close the parking lot gates.
The demonstrators who have
visited the park daily since it
opened have carried signs urging
people not to use the lot and also
saying, "Park at Your Own Risk,"
In Memory of James Rector," etc.
Trouble
Parking Company of America
vice—president Frank Chavez said,
before operations began last week,
that he didn't expect any trouble
and hoped there would not be
any. Chavez appeared to be
somewhat surprised and irritated
with the presence of pickets when
the lot opened. However he has
not yet attempted to have the
police disperse the demonstrators
for trespassing.
Although the lot officially
opened for business on Dec. 30,
the gates were open and signs had
been posted and the lot was
apparently ready for business, on
December 23, 1969.
One person parked that day,
but after pickets appeared the lot
attendant closed the gates and
indicated the facility was not
officially opened.
The lot has no full-time
attendant. Users are supposed to
leave their money in a central
container which has a slot for
each numbered space, (reprinted
