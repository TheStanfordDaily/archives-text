# Survey Findings
## Pot Users 'Conventional' 
### 
Several reports have been
issued recently on the subject of
the use of marijuana and
hallucinoginic drugs, the type of
people that use them, and the
quality of drugs that can be
obtained from peddlers.
A study headed by Dr. Henry
E. Bruyn of the University of
California reported Cal students
who are heavy users of marijuana
or LSD are likely to become
dropouts. However, most students
use marijuana as a mild stimulant
on weekends only. Furthermore,
the quality of pot available from
street peedlers is often too poor
to produce hallucinations.
Dr. Bruyn gave a personal
estimate that the use of LSD on
the Berkeley campus had declined
since 1962, and is now at a level
of from two to four per cent of
the student body. He added that
from 5 to 10 per cent of students
there have had "an acquaintance"
with LSD.
The results of 1104 in—depth
interviews with San Francisco
adults on the subject of marijuana
use were reported in the current
issue of Science magazine. The
study, conducted by two
researchers from the
Langley—Porter Neuropsychiatric
Institute, showed that the typical
pot smoker in San Francisco is
"reasonably conventional."
The report, titled "Marijuana
Use Among Urban Adults", came
up with several interesting
conclusions:
— Heavy drinkers smoke
marijuana.
—Fifty—one per cent of the
men and 42 per cent of the
women who smoke more than one
pack of cigarettes a day said they
had smoked pot.
-Fifty-six per cent of the men
and 63 per cent of the women
who lacked a religious affiliation
had used marijuana.
—In the 18—to—24—year
group, "in general, the proportion
of students who report using
marijuana does not differ
markedly from the corresponding
proportion among
non —students." However, women
students are slightly more likely,
and male students slightly less
likely, to use marijuana than their
non —student counterparts.

Two additional releases from
other experts studying "street
drugs" have shown that the buyer
often does not know what he is
getting from the peddler, unless
he knows his contact personally.
A research group at the New
Jersey Neuro—Psychiatric
Institute at Princeton examined
thirty—six drug capsules donated
by users, and found that about
half of the capsules did not
contain the purported drug.
Thirteen samples alleged to be
mescaline did not contain the
active ingredient of peyote. Seven
of the capsules were actually LSD,
one asprin, and four were STP, a
much stronger drug than LSD.
Another substitute used in the
capsules was the compound

phenyclidamine, which is used to
anesthetize animals. It was
abondoned for human use because
of the terrifying psychotic
episodes it produced.
"Sacramental pot' ' Denied
In a more off—beat vein, a
Marin County freelance writer and
photographer has recently been
bound over to the Superior Court
for trial on possession of
marijuana. The writer, Jeffrey
Stallard, tried to have himself
arrested last March as a habitual
offender of the state's laws
regarding the use of the drug.
Stallard maintained that his use
of pot is part of his religious
experiments, and that he uses the
drug as one of the sacraments.
When the Marin County sheriff
refused to arrest him on these
grounds, Stallard drew a joint
from his shoe, and this turned the
trick.
In turning Stallard over to
stand trial, Marin Municipal Court
Judge Alvin H. Goldstein Jr.
maintained in a seven —page
opinion that there is "no such
religion as marijuana" and "no
empirical evidence that marijuana
is central to the practice of
anything other than this
defendant's philosophical
approach to life." The judge
added that such a reverence of
marijuana could open a Pandora's
box of "mischief" by so
classifying other drugs, such as
LSD, methadrine, and the opium
derivatives.

anything other than this

approach to life." The judge
added that such a reverence of

LSD, methadrine, and the opium

Several reports have been
issued recently on the subject of
the use of marijuana and
hallucinoginic drugs, the type of
people that use them, and the
quality of drugs that can be
obtained from peddlers.
A study headed by Dr. Henry
E. Bruyn of the University of
California reported Cal students
who are heavy users of marijuana
or LSD are likely to become
dropouts. However, most students
use marijuana as a mild stimulant
on weekends only. Furthermore,
the quality of pot available from
street peedlers is often too poor
to produce hallucinations.
Dr. Bruyn gave a personal
estimate that the use of LSD on
the Berkeley campus had declined
since 1962, and is now at a level
of from two to four per cent of
the student body. He added that
from 5 to 10 per cent of students
there have had "an acquaintance"
with LSD.
The results of 1104 in—depth
interviews with San Francisco
adults on the subject of marijuana
use were reported in the current
issue of Science magazine. The
study, conducted by two
researchers from the
Langley—Porter Neuropsychiatric
Institute, showed that the typical
pot smoker in San Francisco is
"reasonably conventional."
The report, titled "Marijuana
Use Among Urban Adults", came
up with several interesting
conclusions:
— Heavy drinkers smoke
marijuana.
—Fifty—one per cent of the
men and 42 per cent of the
women who smoke more than one
pack of cigarettes a day said they
had smoked pot.
-Fifty-six per cent of the men
and 63 per cent of the women
who lacked a religious affiliation
had used marijuana.
—In the 18—to—24—year
group, "in general, the proportion
of students who report using
marijuana does not differ
markedly from the corresponding
proportion among
non —students." However, women
students are slightly more likely,
and male students slightly less
likely, to use marijuana than their
non —student counterparts.

Two additional releases from
other experts studying "street
drugs" have shown that the buyer
often does not know what he is
getting from the peddler, unless
he knows his contact personally.
A research group at the New
Jersey Neuro—Psychiatric
Institute at Princeton examined
thirty—six drug capsules donated
by users, and found that about
half of the capsules did not
contain the purported drug.
Thirteen samples alleged to be
mescaline did not contain the
active ingredient of peyote. Seven
of the capsules were actually LSD,
one asprin, and four were STP, a
much stronger drug than LSD.
Another substitute used in the
capsules was the compound

phenyclidamine, which is used to
anesthetize animals. It was
abondoned for human use because
of the terrifying psychotic
episodes it produced.
"Sacramental pot' ' Denied
In a more off—beat vein, a
Marin County freelance writer and
photographer has recently been
bound over to the Superior Court
for trial on possession of
marijuana. The writer, Jeffrey
Stallard, tried to have himself
arrested last March as a habitual
offender of the state's laws
regarding the use of the drug.
Stallard maintained that his use
of pot is part of his religious
experiments, and that he uses the
drug as one of the sacraments.
When the Marin County sheriff
refused to arrest him on these
grounds, Stallard drew a joint
from his shoe, and this turned the
trick.
In turning Stallard over to
stand trial, Marin Municipal Court
Judge Alvin H. Goldstein Jr.
maintained in a seven —page
opinion that there is "no such
religion as marijuana" and "no
empirical evidence that marijuana
is central to the practice of
anything other than this
defendant's philosophical
approach to life." The judge
added that such a reverence of
