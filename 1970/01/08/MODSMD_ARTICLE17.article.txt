# Ask to Keep Shrine Game
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council has
unanimously come out in favor of
a resolution favoring the retention
of the East-West Shrine Game.
The game which this year had
been moved from Candlestick
Park due to the installation of a
new turf, was a tremendous
success, netting about $40,000.
Mayor Edward Arnold had
placed the item on the agenda.
Bob Young, assistant athletic
director at Stanford also was very
favorable to the game's return.
"We'd like to have it,"he
commented.
However, there are some
problems involved in keeping the
shrine game at Stanford. It is not
known whether the university's
tax status would allow the use of
the stadium for a non-educational
event. Cassius Kirk, the
university's legal counsel, said that
the tax status could possibly be a
problem. "I didn't say it was
insurmountable, but however
worthy, the Shrine game is not an
educational purpose."
Kirk went on to say that if a
request is made, the university
will explore the problem in depth.
"It might even require state
legislation and a ruling of the state
board of equalization," he said.
