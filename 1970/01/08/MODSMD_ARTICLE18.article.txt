# Radical Caucuses Discussed at NUC
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
The New University
Conference held its first meeting
of the quarter Tuesday evening at
Tresidder Union. The meeting
discussed reports from radical
caucuses at recent professional
conventions, the NUC's possible
role in the questions of land use
and ecology in the Stanford area,
and the directions and activities
NUC might take in the areas of
graduate student problems, salary,
tenure, and departmental
decision-making.
The New University
Conference is a nationwide group
of radicals who are trying to
politically create a new American
social and educational system to
replace the present one which
they feel is an instrument of class,
sexual and racial oppression.
Tuesday's meeting was chaired
by George Kaplan, assistant
professor of psychology. Kaplan
started out by saying that he felt
the Stanford NUC should be a
"radical, non-sectarian group,"
one which is "able to form its
own politics," and a group which
is "action-oriented."
Oliver Wendell Holmes, history

instructor, reported on the
attempts of radicals at the
American Historical Association
convention to make historians
become more politically active
through such means as a motion
to have the convention adopt a
position on the war in Vietnam, a
motion which was eventually
defeated. There were also reports
on the American Association for
the Advancement of Science and
the Modern Language Association
conventions. Leonard Herzenberg,
associate professor in »he Genetics
Department pointed out that the
AAAS convention had formed a
group to study the harmful effects
of herbicides presently being used
in Vietnam on the population and
ecology of the area.
Also discussed at the meeting
was NUC's possible role in doing
something about Stanford's land
use policies, which Kaplan said
were filled with "imperialism,
racism, militarism, and elitism." It
was generally felt that some
coordination with Grass Roots
might be useful.
The meeting closed with a
general discussion of education at
Stanford, particularly graduate
education. There was a general
condemnation of the SES report.
In the words of Martin Carnoy,
assistant professor in Education
and Economics, "It is worthless."
Attending the meeting was
Alex Giorgiadis, NUC coordinator
for Northern California. He
stressed the need for a closer
relationship between the Stanford
chapter of the NUC and the San
Francisco-Berkeley group. He also
spoke concerning a California
NUC conference to take place in
Los Angeles in mid-March. The
conference, he said, would mainly
be one for planning and strategy.
The next NUC meeting will be
Tuesday evening.

use policies, which Kaplan said
were filled with "imperialism,
racism, militarism, and elitism." It
was generally felt that some
coordination with Grass Roots
might be useful.
The meeting closed with a
general discussion of education at
Stanford, particularly graduate
education. There was a general
condemnation of the SES report.
In the words of Martin Carnoy,
assistant professor in Education
and Economics, "It is worthless."
Attending the meeting was
Alex Giorgiadis, NUC coordinator
for Northern California. He
stressed the need for a closer
relationship between the Stanford
chapter of the NUC and the San
Francisco-Berkeley group. He also
spoke concerning a California
NUC conference to take place in
Los Angeles in mid-March. The
conference, he said, would mainly
be one for planning and strategy.
The next NUC meeting will be
Tuesday evening.
The New University
Conference held its first meeting
of the quarter Tuesday evening at
Tresidder Union. The meeting
discussed reports from radical
caucuses at recent professional
conventions, the NUC's possible
role in the questions of land use
and ecology in the Stanford area,
and the directions and activities
NUC might take in the areas of
graduate student problems, salary,
tenure, and departmental
decision-making.
The New University
Conference is a nationwide group
of radicals who are trying to
politically create a new American
social and educational system to
replace the present one which
they feel is an instrument of class,
sexual and racial oppression.
Tuesday's meeting was chaired
by George Kaplan, assistant
professor of psychology. Kaplan
started out by saying that he felt
the Stanford NUC should be a
"radical, non-sectarian group,"
one which is "able to form its
own politics," and a group which
is "action-oriented."
Oliver Wendell Holmes, history

instructor, reported on the
attempts of radicals at the
American Historical Association
convention to make historians
become more politically active
through such means as a motion
to have the convention adopt a
position on the war in Vietnam, a
motion which was eventually
defeated. There were also reports
on the American Association for
the Advancement of Science and
the Modern Language Association
conventions. Leonard Herzenberg,
associate professor in »he Genetics
Department pointed out that the
AAAS convention had formed a
group to study the harmful effects
of herbicides presently being used
in Vietnam on the population and
ecology of the area.
Also discussed at the meeting
was NUC's possible role in doing
something about Stanford's land
use policies, which Kaplan said
were filled with "imperialism,
racism, militarism, and elitism." It
was generally felt that some
coordination with Grass Roots
might be useful.
