## Agnew Assures Asia 
### 
KUALA LUMPUR (AP)-Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew told
Malaysian leaders Thursday that
the United States won't leave
Southeast Asia "in the lurch"
against Communist aggression.
Agnew gave the assurances that
the United States would maintain
the Western presence in Southeast
Asia in hour-long conferences
with Prime Minister Tunku Abdul
Rahman and Tun Abdul Razak,
deputy premier and chief of
government operations.
The prime minister said he was
satisfied with the U.S. intentions
Agnew expressed.
Mrs. Agnew, feeling the strain
of the 11-nation trip, canceled her
morning appointments on the
advice of her doctor, Capt.
William Voss. Mrs. Mary Beal, her
personal secretary, said Mrs.
Agnew had "a slight temperature
and a stomach upset."
Armed soldiers stood every few
hundred feet along the 16-mile
route from Subang International
Airport to Agnew' s hotel when
the vice presidential party arrived
Wednesday. Five trucks carrying
riot police accompanied the
motorcade along the highway,
which had been cleared of traffic.
Environment
SACRAMENTO AP-Assembly
speaker Robert T. Monagan,
R-Tracy, announced formation
Wednesday of a select committee
on environmental quality and
immediately ran into an attack
from Assembly Democratic leader
Jesse M. Unruh.
Monagan said the committee,
made up of himself and the
chairmen of eight permanent
Assembly committees and chaired
by George W. Milias, R-Gilroy,
will be asked to draw up basic
guidelines for legislation.
"I anticipate several hundred
bills this year dealing with the
environment. We've never had this
before, so we need some
guidelines," Monagan said. "We
have seven different committees if
not more, dealing with the
problem."
"I don't see representation of
some outstanding members of this
house on the speaker's
committee," said Unruh, of
Inglewood. "I object to this
committee."
Unruh challenged the Monagan
committee after the Assembly
refused to suspend its rules to

allow immediate action on a
resolution introduced by Unruh
asking the federal government to
immediately halt oil drilling in the
Santa Barbara Channel.
Suspending the rules which send
resolutions first to committee
requires a two-thirds vote, far
above the party-line 31-28 vote
Unruh won. Monagan did promise
that the Unruh resolution would
be heard at the first meeting of
the Rules Committee next week.

Democrats accused Gov. Reagan
Wednesday of ignoring the really
basic problems facing California,
and said they'll offer their own

specific solutions this election
year.
Seven Democratic
assembly-men held a joint news
conference to announce
formation of a task force to
"explore eight California critical
problem areas that were largely
ignored by the governor's 'state of
the state' message."
The areas involve inflation,
unemployment, rising rates on
insurance and utilities, jammed
state colleges and university, tax
loopholes, offshore oil drilling,
housing, and rapid transit in urban
areas.
They also charged that Reagan
is trying in an election year to
capitalize on consumer concern
over the quality of what is
bought.

The areas involve inflation,
unemployment, rising rates on
insurance and utilities, jammed

KUALA LUMPUR (AP)-Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew told
Malaysian leaders Thursday that
the United States won't leave
Southeast Asia "in the lurch"
against Communist aggression.
Agnew gave the assurances that
the United States would maintain
the Western presence in Southeast
Asia in hour-long conferences
with Prime Minister Tunku Abdul
Rahman and Tun Abdul Razak,
deputy premier and chief of
government operations.
The prime minister said he was
satisfied with the U.S. intentions
Agnew expressed.
Mrs. Agnew, feeling the strain
of the 11-nation trip, canceled her
morning appointments on the
advice of her doctor, Capt.
William Voss. Mrs. Mary Beal, her
personal secretary, said Mrs.
Agnew had "a slight temperature
and a stomach upset."
Armed soldiers stood every few
hundred feet along the 16-mile
route from Subang International
Airport to Agnew' s hotel when
the vice presidential party arrived
Wednesday. Five trucks carrying
riot police accompanied the
motorcade along the highway,
which had been cleared of traffic.

SACRAMENTO AP-Assembly
speaker Robert T. Monagan,
R-Tracy, announced formation
Wednesday of a select committee
on environmental quality and
immediately ran into an attack
from Assembly Democratic leader
Jesse M. Unruh.
Monagan said the committee,
made up of himself and the
chairmen of eight permanent
Assembly committees and chaired
by George W. Milias, R-Gilroy,
will be asked to draw up basic
guidelines for legislation.
"I anticipate several hundred
bills this year dealing with the
environment. We've never had this
before, so we need some
guidelines," Monagan said. "We
have seven different committees if
not more, dealing with the
problem."
"I don't see representation of
some outstanding members of this
house on the speaker's
committee," said Unruh, of
Inglewood. "I object to this
committee."
Unruh challenged the Monagan
committee after the Assembly
refused to suspend its rules to

allow immediate action on a
resolution introduced by Unruh
asking the federal government to
immediately halt oil drilling in the
Santa Barbara Channel.
Suspending the rules which send
resolutions first to committee
requires a two-thirds vote, far
above the party-line 31-28 vote
Unruh won. Monagan did promise
that the Unruh resolution would
be heard at the first meeting of
the Rules Committee next week.
