# Mom's New Year: Problems Old & New
## 
### CISSIE BONINI 
Now that the rush of returning
to school has abated, it's time to
fulfill that New Year's resolution
and send those belated Christmas
and thank-you letters. Below are
some useful samples from recent
mail:
Dear Julie,
Thank you, dear, for the
lavendar shawl and lap rug.
Grandpa and I use them when we
come in from water-skiing and
they'll be nice and warm after
shooting the rapids this summer.
Love,
Grandma
Dear Mom and Dad,
I hope you weren't worried
when I didn't make it home over
Christmas vacation . . .the
Renaissance final was a bear and
the sun here at Acapulco is very
restoring. I'm a little short on
funds . . .
Dear Dr. Crosby,
Boy was I surprised with that
15 unit "F" on my honor's essay.
It sure game me a lot of laughs.
Yuk! Yuk!
I've altered my plans a bit since
we last met.

Dear Mom
Mister Franz Pot
regrets that he is unable
to accept the kind invitation
of the
United States Army
due to a Canadian commitment

Dear Alicia,
You are really being immature
to be offended with my gift card
enclosure. While it is true that the
"a 11-my-love-to-only-you-forever"
cards were imprinted, I plan to
give you lots of gifts and will need
lots of cards . . .

Dear Aunt Edith,
Thank you for the two pairs of
ear-muffs. All the guys in the
house are jealous. And I'm the
only Deke on campus with angora
muffs!
Appreciatively,
Philip
Dear Mr. Blanding,
Thank you for the "lid of good
stuff" and the $1500 check. I'm
afraid the Western Civ grade still
stands, though. But have a great
New Year.

Dear Godmother,
Thank you for the six pairs of
white kid gloves. They're handy
for my basketball class!
Your loving god-daughter.
Dear Mummy and Daddy,
Of course graduate school at
S.U. hasn't changed me and of
course I'm the same upright
fellow who attended Holy Cross.
That's just my cleaning woman
who keeps answering the phone
the evenings when you call . . .
Things sure are different here
than at the Cross.
Yours in the faith,
Francis X.

Dear Godmother,
Thank you for the six pairs of
white kid gloves. They're handy
for my basketball class!
Your loving god-daughter.
Dear Mummy and Daddy,
Of course graduate school at
S.U. hasn't changed me and of
course I'm the same upright
fellow who attended Holy Cross.
That's just my cleaning woman
who keeps answering the phone
the evenings when you call . . .
Things sure are different here
than at the Cross.
Yours in the faith,
Francis X.
Now that the rush of returning
to school has abated, it's time to
fulfill that New Year's resolution
and send those belated Christmas
and thank-you letters. Below are
some useful samples from recent
mail:
Dear Julie,
Thank you, dear, for the
lavendar shawl and lap rug.
Grandpa and I use them when we
come in from water-skiing and
they'll be nice and warm after
shooting the rapids this summer.
Love,
Grandma
Dear Mom and Dad,
I hope you weren't worried
when I didn't make it home over
Christmas vacation . . .the
Renaissance final was a bear and
the sun here at Acapulco is very
restoring. I'm a little short on
funds . . .
Dear Dr. Crosby,
Boy was I surprised with that
15 unit "F" on my honor's essay.
It sure game me a lot of laughs.
Yuk! Yuk!
I've altered my plans a bit since
we last met.
Sincerely,

Greetings . . .
Dear Mom
Mister Franz Pot
regrets that he is unable
to accept the kind invitation
of the
United States Army
due to a Canadian commitment

Dear Alicia,
You are really being immature
to be offended with my gift card
enclosure. While it is true that the
"a 11-my-love-to-only-you-forever"
cards were imprinted, I plan to
give you lots of gifts and will need
lots of cards . . .

Dear Aunt Edith,
Thank you for the two pairs of
ear-muffs. All the guys in the
house are jealous. And I'm the
only Deke on campus with angora
muffs!
Appreciatively,
Philip
Dear Mr. Blanding,
Thank you for the "lid of good
stuff" and the $1500 check. I'm
afraid the Western Civ grade still
stands, though. But have a great
New Year.
