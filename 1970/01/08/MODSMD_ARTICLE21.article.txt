# Doubled Up
## Strange Bids Stop Defense 
### Marshall Schwartz 
Defending a contract at the
one level is fairly unusual,
especially at duplicate bridge. Too
often, the defenders find they can
make a game and the points they
get for setting the opponents just
don't make up for the missed
game. Here, however, all turned
out well for East—West.

South was opening five —card
majors, so he started things off
with one club. It is hard to see
why North couldn't take a bid —
maybe the fact she was a classic
LOL (if you can't figure out what
that stands for, you'd better quit
right now) was the reason.
Anyhow, East reopened with a

double. This shows an opening
hand — which he has in support of
any other suit.
West Poorly Passes
West's penalty pass is also a
little strange. Normally, one
would want a better trump suit
(the length is fine — but the
quality is sorely lacking). So he
found himself on lead, decided to
attack trumps, and felt a little ill
when he saw dummy dome down.
South won the lead with the
eight in hand, after suffering the
slight shock of seeing East show
out on the first round. Having
nothing better to do, she (another
LOL) played the ace and queen of
trumps, which West wisely
allowed to hold.
South Sets Up Spades
South now tried to find the
spade ten and set up a trick in
that suit. She let a low spade and
— West balking before playing low
— inserted the sight, losing to
East's ten. East cashed the ace and
returned another spade, which
was ruffed in dummy.
Declarer, stumbling along, led
the diamond queen off board,
West taking his ace. He cashed the
trump king — pulling dummy's
last club — and exited with his last
spade — which East was forced to
win with his six.
East was in no mood to lead
hearts, so he switched to the
diamond jack. South won, and
tried to cash the heart ace. She
almost slipped off her chair when
West ruffed. A diamond served as
an entry to East's hand, and he
proceeded to cash the king—queen
of hearts before giving dummy the
last trick with the jack.
Down Two
Down two for +500 for
East—West.
It turned out that that extra
trick was needed, for most other
pairs found this auction:

pass pass pass
North led a club, and when
West found the heart ace onside
for a ruffing finesse, he took one
heart, the diamond ace, and eight
ruffing tricks to make his slim
game, for + 420.
But not quite as good as the
squeaky +500 our pair managed.

maybe the fact she was a classic
LOL (if you can't figure out what
that stands for, you'd better quit
right now) was the reason.
Anyhow, East reopened with a

double. This shows an opening
hand — which he has in support of
any other suit.
West Poorly Passes
West's penalty pass is also a
little strange. Normally, one
would want a better trump suit
(the length is fine — but the
quality is sorely lacking). So he
found himself on lead, decided to
attack trumps, and felt a little ill
when he saw dummy dome down.
South won the lead with the
eight in hand, after suffering the
slight shock of seeing East show
out on the first round. Having
nothing better to do, she (another
LOL) played the ace and queen of
trumps, which West wisely
allowed to hold.
South Sets Up Spades
South now tried to find the
spade ten and set up a trick in
that suit. She let a low spade and
— West balking before playing low
— inserted the sight, losing to
East's ten. East cashed the ace and
returned another spade, which
was ruffed in dummy.
Declarer, stumbling along, led
the diamond queen off board,
West taking his ace. He cashed the
trump king — pulling dummy's
last club — and exited with his last
spade — which East was forced to
win with his six.
East was in no mood to lead
hearts, so he switched to the
diamond jack. South won, and
tried to cash the heart ace. She
almost slipped off her chair when
West ruffed. A diamond served as
an entry to East's hand, and he
proceeded to cash the king—queen
of hearts before giving dummy the
last trick with the jack.
Down Two
Down two for +500 for
East—West.
It turned out that that extra
trick was needed, for most other
pairs found this auction:
S W N E
1 C pass 2 C double
pass 3 S pass 4 S
pass pass pass
North led a club, and when
West found the heart ace onside
for a ruffing finesse, he took one
heart, the diamond ace, and eight
ruffing tricks to make his slim
game, for + 420.
But not quite as good as the
squeaky +500 our pair managed.

Defending a contract at the
one level is fairly unusual,
especially at duplicate bridge. Too
often, the defenders find they can
make a game and the points they
get for setting the opponents just
don't make up for the missed
game. Here, however, all turned
out well for East—West.

South was opening five —card
majors, so he started things off
with one club. It is hard to see
why North couldn't take a bid —
maybe the fact she was a classic
LOL (if you can't figure out what
that stands for, you'd better quit
right now) was the reason.
