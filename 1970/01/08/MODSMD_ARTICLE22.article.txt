# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Wet Start for Season 
### Terry Rustin 
Josef Krips and the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra
opened their 1969 —1970 season
in December with two familiar,
(safe), un—inspired programs, a
rather soggy start to the
Beethoven commemorative
season. Since this is Maestro
Krips* last year with the
Symphony, they felt it
appropriate to honor their
conductor and the Beethoven
bicentennial by scheduling a
number of Beethoven's works.
Their intentions, however, were
better than their arithmetic, for
Beethoven was born December 1 5
or 16, 1770, and his 200 th
birthday is next season, not this
one.
In addition, they are
suffocating us with his works —
perhaps in an attempt to revive
the early 19th century custom of
playing three or four complete
symphonies at each marathon
concert. This year, all nine
symphonies, all five piano
concertos, the violin concerto, the
Missa Solemnis, and several
overtures will be played.
Even though I love Beethoven,
I must describe this scheduling as
stale and unimaginative.
Beethoven would have been better
respected by the performance of
some of his excellent
lesser—known works, such as the
Mass in C major, the concerto for
piano, violin and cello, the
Fantasia for piano, chorus and
orchestra, and the romances for
violin and orchestra.
Horns Kail Krips
The two December
performances did not do justice to

Maestro Kl ips, who is after all one
of the most highly respected
conductors in the world. Even the
maestro's new verve and elan
could not cajole cantibile who
remain the weakest section. This
was especially noticeable, and
particularly onerous in the
Tchaikowsky played at the second
concert, maintaining the tradition
of a fine orchestra with sickly
horns.
The season opened December 3
with Maestro Krips striding out to
the podium and immediately
fiving the downbeat for an
absolutely Prussian version of the
Star Spangled Banner. The
Overture to Egmont followed,
Beethoven's musical empathy
with the mis-understood Count
of Egmont of the Netherlands
annexation struggle in the 16th
century. Firm and well-played,
Egmont was to be the best piece
of the evening.
To some, Beethoven was the
composer of five symphonies,
inexplicably numbered 1,3,5,7
and 9. At least this concert season
will remind us that the even
numbered symphonies are also
worthy, although not so
well-known. The Second
Symphony, which followed
Egmont, began Beethoven's
transition from composing in
Mozart's image to the freeing of
his own great talents, so evident in
the Eroica. Played with the small
18th century style orchestra, the
Symphony No.2 was competently
played, but lacked the feeling of
change which Beethoven's
contemporaries instilled into the
piece.
Fifth is Disappointing
The real disappointment of the
evening was the symphony that is
frankly the most difficult to
perform, since it has been
performed so much. More people
can identify the da—da—da—
duuuuuum of the Fifth
Symphony than can remember
the Vice President's name, and
this one piece has received more
exposure than any other.
Well —known for his Beethoven
interpretations, Krips tried
something new this time, a
choppier, more rigid version, not
unlike the Teutonic feeling in the
National Anthem. The fermatas
were left out of the opening

measures, so the audience went
away humming an unfamiliar
Da —da —da —du m — Da—da—da—
duuuuuum.
The new Krips version is
original, different — but not the
way Beethoven wrote it, and not
as good. This first movement
builds on those ponderous,
deliberate chords, developing the
initially heavy triplet pattern into
a light, dance—like one. The
connection of the first few
measures was a musicological
mistake, a strange presentation
from a usually conservative
conductor. Maestro Krips is a
superb traditional conductor, and
the forays into innovation should
be left to Mr. Ozawa.
Second Concert Traditional
The December 10th concert
was eminently traditional.
Beginning with the Maross/.ek
Dances of the Hungarian Kodaly,
Beethoven's Second Piano
Concerto and Tchaikowsky's
Sixth Symphony completed the
sampling of musical leterature of
different styles and different
forms, in the manner of most
contemporary concerts. Again,
the short program work was the
most successful, the Piano
Concerto being over —dominated
by the strong playing of Rudolf
Firkusny, with the orchestra lost
in Beethoven's concertante, and
the Pathetique marred by the
failure of the horns to be worthy
of the part. Tchaikowsky had a
romantic soul but a superego that
told him to compose symphonies
in four movements, sonata form,
march minuet, rondo, or some
such arrangement.
Never at home in the concert
hall, Tchaikowsky's talent is best
seen on the ballet stage where his
expansive visions are free. When
such works are given a place on
the concert program, the
orchestra must call forth all of its
romantic potential.
Unfortunately, the Symphony
was not equal to the task.
Tonight, the San Francisco
Symphony under Maestro Krips,
with the Stanford University
Choir and Chorus, present
Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, the
Mass in D Major. There will be a
bus leaving from Tressider parking
lot at 6:45 PM and from Wilbur at
7:00 PM; round—trip fare is one
dollar. Purchase tickets in advance
at Tressider Box Office; any
spaces left will be sold at the bus.

Symphony No.2 was competently
played, but lacked the feeling of
change which Beethoven's
contemporaries instilled into the
piece.
Fifth is Disappointing
The real disappointment of the
evening was the symphony that is
frankly the most difficult to
perform, since it has been
performed so much. More people
can identify the da—da—da—
duuuuuum of the Fifth
Symphony than can remember
the Vice President's name, and
this one piece has received more
exposure than any other.
Well —known for his Beethoven
interpretations, Krips tried
something new this time, a
choppier, more rigid version, not
unlike the Teutonic feeling in the
National Anthem. The fermatas
were left out of the opening

measures, so the audience went
away humming an unfamiliar
Da —da —da —du m — Da—da—da—
duuuuuum.
The new Krips version is
original, different — but not the
way Beethoven wrote it, and not
as good. This first movement
builds on those ponderous,
deliberate chords, developing the
initially heavy triplet pattern into
a light, dance—like one. The
connection of the first few
measures was a musicological
mistake, a strange presentation
from a usually conservative
conductor. Maestro Krips is a
superb traditional conductor, and
the forays into innovation should
be left to Mr. Ozawa.
Second Concert Traditional
The December 10th concert
was eminently traditional.
Beginning with the Maross/.ek
Dances of the Hungarian Kodaly,
Beethoven's Second Piano
Concerto and Tchaikowsky's
Sixth Symphony completed the
sampling of musical leterature of
different styles and different
forms, in the manner of most
contemporary concerts. Again,
the short program work was the
most successful, the Piano
Concerto being over —dominated
by the strong playing of Rudolf
Firkusny, with the orchestra lost
in Beethoven's concertante, and
the Pathetique marred by the
failure of the horns to be worthy
of the part. Tchaikowsky had a
romantic soul but a superego that
told him to compose symphonies
in four movements, sonata form,
march minuet, rondo, or some
such arrangement.
Never at home in the concert
hall, Tchaikowsky's talent is best
seen on the ballet stage where his
expansive visions are free. When
such works are given a place on
the concert program, the
orchestra must call forth all of its
romantic potential.
Unfortunately, the Symphony
was not equal to the task.
Tonight, the San Francisco
Symphony under Maestro Krips,
with the Stanford University
Choir and Chorus, present
Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, the
Mass in D Major. There will be a
bus leaving from Tressider parking
lot at 6:45 PM and from Wilbur at
7:00 PM; round—trip fare is one
dollar. Purchase tickets in advance
at Tressider Box Office; any
spaces left will be sold at the bus.
Josef Krips and the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra
opened their 1969 —1970 season
in December with two familiar,
(safe), un—inspired programs, a
rather soggy start to the
Beethoven commemorative
season. Since this is Maestro
Krips* last year with the
Symphony, they felt it
appropriate to honor their
conductor and the Beethoven
bicentennial by scheduling a
number of Beethoven's works.
Their intentions, however, were
better than their arithmetic, for
Beethoven was born December 1 5
or 16, 1770, and his 200 th
birthday is next season, not this
one.
In addition, they are
suffocating us with his works —
perhaps in an attempt to revive
the early 19th century custom of
playing three or four complete
symphonies at each marathon
concert. This year, all nine
symphonies, all five piano
concertos, the violin concerto, the
Missa Solemnis, and several
overtures will be played.
Even though I love Beethoven,
I must describe this scheduling as
stale and unimaginative.
Beethoven would have been better
respected by the performance of
some of his excellent
lesser—known works, such as the
Mass in C major, the concerto for
piano, violin and cello, the
Fantasia for piano, chorus and
orchestra, and the romances for
violin and orchestra.
Horns Kail Krips
The two December
performances did not do justice to

Maestro Kl ips, who is after all one
of the most highly respected
conductors in the world. Even the
maestro's new verve and elan
could not cajole cantibile who
remain the weakest section. This
was especially noticeable, and
particularly onerous in the
Tchaikowsky played at the second
concert, maintaining the tradition
of a fine orchestra with sickly
horns.
The season opened December 3
with Maestro Krips striding out to
the podium and immediately
fiving the downbeat for an
absolutely Prussian version of the
Star Spangled Banner. The
Overture to Egmont followed,
Beethoven's musical empathy
with the mis-understood Count
of Egmont of the Netherlands
annexation struggle in the 16th
century. Firm and well-played,
Egmont was to be the best piece
of the evening.
To some, Beethoven was the
composer of five symphonies,
inexplicably numbered 1,3,5,7
and 9. At least this concert season
will remind us that the even
numbered symphonies are also
worthy, although not so
well-known. The Second
Symphony, which followed
Egmont, began Beethoven's
transition from composing in
Mozart's image to the freeing of
his own great talents, so evident in
the Eroica. Played with the small
18th century style orchestra, the
Symphony No.2 was competently
played, but lacked the feeling of

Josef Krips and the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra
opened their 1969 —1970 season
in December with two familiar,
(safe), un—inspired programs, a
rather soggy start to the
Beethoven commemorative
season. Since this is Maestro
Krips* last year with the
Symphony, they felt it
appropriate to honor their
conductor and the Beethoven
bicentennial by scheduling a
number of Beethoven's works.
Their intentions, however, were
better than their arithmetic, for
Beethoven was born December 1 5
or 16, 1770, and his 200 th
birthday is next season, not this
one.
In addition, they are
suffocating us with his works —
perhaps in an attempt to revive
the early 19th century custom of
playing three or four complete
symphonies at each marathon
concert. This year, all nine
symphonies, all five piano
concertos, the violin concerto, the
Missa Solemnis, and several
overtures will be played.
Even though I love Beethoven,
I must describe this scheduling as
stale and unimaginative.
Beethoven would have been better
respected by the performance of
some of his excellent
lesser—known works, such as the
Mass in C major, the concerto for
piano, violin and cello, the
Fantasia for piano, chorus and
orchestra, and the romances for
violin and orchestra.
Horns Kail Krips
The two December
performances did not do justice to

Maestro Kl ips, who is after all one
of the most highly respected
conductors in the world. Even the
maestro's new verve and elan
could not cajole cantibile who
remain the weakest section. This
was especially noticeable, and
particularly onerous in the
Tchaikowsky played at the second
concert, maintaining the tradition
of a fine orchestra with sickly
horns.
The season opened December 3
with Maestro Krips striding out to
the podium and immediately
fiving the downbeat for an
absolutely Prussian version of the
Star Spangled Banner. The
Overture to Egmont followed,
Beethoven's musical empathy
with the mis-understood Count
of Egmont of the Netherlands
annexation struggle in the 16th
century. Firm and well-played,
Egmont was to be the best piece
of the evening.
To some, Beethoven was the
composer of five symphonies,
inexplicably numbered 1,3,5,7
and 9. At least this concert season
will remind us that the even
numbered symphonies are also
worthy, although not so
well-known. The Second
Symphony, which followed
Egmont, began Beethoven's
transition from composing in
Mozart's image to the freeing of
his own great talents, so evident in
the Eroica. Played with the small
18th century style orchestra, the
Symphony No.2 was competently
played, but lacked the feeling of
change which Beethoven's
contemporaries instilled into the
piece.
Fifth is Disappointing
The real disappointment of the
evening was the symphony that is
frankly the most difficult to
perform, since it has been
performed so much. More people
can identify the da—da—da—
duuuuuum of the Fifth
Symphony than can remember
the Vice President's name, and
this one piece has received more
exposure than any other.
Well —known for his Beethoven
interpretations, Krips tried
something new this time, a
choppier, more rigid version, not
unlike the Teutonic feeling in the
National Anthem. The fermatas
were left out of the opening

measures, so the audience went
away humming an unfamiliar
Da —da —da —du m — Da—da—da—
duuuuuum.
The new Krips version is
original, different — but not the
way Beethoven wrote it, and not
as good. This first movement
builds on those ponderous,
deliberate chords, developing the
initially heavy triplet pattern into
a light, dance—like one. The
connection of the first few
measures was a musicological
mistake, a strange presentation
from a usually conservative
conductor. Maestro Krips is a
superb traditional conductor, and
the forays into innovation should
be left to Mr. Ozawa.
Second Concert Traditional
The December 10th concert
was eminently traditional.
Beginning with the Maross/.ek
Dances of the Hungarian Kodaly,
Beethoven's Second Piano
Concerto and Tchaikowsky's
Sixth Symphony completed the
sampling of musical leterature of
different styles and different
forms, in the manner of most
contemporary concerts. Again,
the short program work was the
most successful, the Piano
Concerto being over —dominated
by the strong playing of Rudolf
Firkusny, with the orchestra lost
in Beethoven's concertante, and
the Pathetique marred by the
failure of the horns to be worthy
of the part. Tchaikowsky had a
romantic soul but a superego that
told him to compose symphonies
in four movements, sonata form,
march minuet, rondo, or some
such arrangement.
Never at home in the concert
hall, Tchaikowsky's talent is best
seen on the ballet stage where his
expansive visions are free. When
such works are given a place on
the concert program, the
orchestra must call forth all of its
romantic potential.
Unfortunately, the Symphony
was not equal to the task.
Tonight, the San Francisco
Symphony under Maestro Krips,
with the Stanford University
Choir and Chorus, present
Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, the
Mass in D Major. There will be a
bus leaving from Tressider parking
lot at 6:45 PM and from Wilbur at
7:00 PM; round—trip fare is one
dollar. Purchase tickets in advance
at Tressider Box Office; any
spaces left will be sold at the bus.
