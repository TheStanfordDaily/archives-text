# The 						Wandering Jew
## Motown is Notown for Rads 
### Tom Given 
Not even Princeton could hold
a crowd. It wasn't the acting; and
even the material wasn't bad.
Detroit just wasn't ready for it.
What had been a warm and
well dressed crowd of local alumni
out to see the Triangle show — a
student produced variety show
that has toured the country since
the turn of the century — became
a hostile pack of catcallers as the
sons of Princeton watched
contemporary Princeton men and
women toss violence war, racism,
and censorship out of a script and
into the fray.
By intermission, close to fifty
of the five hundred person
audience had left; another one
hundred respectable alums
stomped out before the final
curtain. The rest didn't tarry long
either. To Californians raised on
Hayokawan stereotypes of the
new left, it was one right from the
SDS notebook.
Tension in Town
The rudeness, bitterness, and
hostility unleashed by a college
roadshow were not unusual. These
emotions and reactions course
throughout Motown.
In an upper middle class
neighborhood within city limits, a
mother who braved the Freedom
Rides ten years ago won't let her
child go to the store.
Not that there are many stores
left; this area saw many of its
stores burned out during the 1967
riots. Some never reopened, and
those that are open have changed
to accomodate a less affluent
clientele. To find a pair of
sweatsocks on Livernois — once
the "Avenue of Fashion" — is in
1969 an impossibility.
Walking with Mace
An elderly couple continues its
walks at night — bolstered now
with a thick walking stick and a can
of Mace.
"It all come on so suddenly,"
says a housewife preparing to
move to the suburbs. "There's no
time to react to anything."
Some are digging in to stay —

buying locks, replacing stained
glass windows with safer
aluminum frames, raising dogs,
and hiring watchmen. Those who
leave don't escape.
Suburban Paranoia
The paranoia does not stop at
city limits. Five miles north of the
city, in suburban development,
people lock their cars as soon as
they get in. Most homes are
locked at all times, and fancier
suburbs have private guards to
supplement local law and order.
Many well—to—do blacks
follow the same course. Some of
the most vehement defenders of
current school boundaries are
blacks defending "good"
elementary schools against poorer
blacks.
Downtown, one can see The
Detroit News, one of the two
morning dailies, preparing to
move to the suburbs. Concerts
may come to the city, but few
suburbanites attend. Detroit may
mean Motown, but a Temptations
concert can attract few whites to
the Civic Center to see it.
One almost goes through basic
training before attempting such an
excursion — learning places to
park, which ramp to walk on,
which elevator to ride, which
ticket to buy. Hints of dire
consequences underline every
piece of "advice".
Downtown Deadly
As a result, downtown Detroit
is dismally deserted by almost
everyone. Most restaurants have
moved to the suburbs, as have
stores, offices, and factories.
What remains are a few banks,
some old office towers,
half—filled garages, and empty
sidewalks. Huge portions of the
downtown area are razed, making
way for urban renewal that may
force feed life into the town.
Above the scene of the
desolation is a billboard erected
by the new mayor, Roman
Gribbs. It reads, "This may be the
Dawn of a New Detroit." Viewing
the devastation around it, one can
only hope so.

blacks defending "good"
elementary schools against poorer
blacks.
Downtown, one can see The
Detroit News, one of the two
morning dailies, preparing to
move to the suburbs. Concerts
may come to the city, but few
suburbanites attend. Detroit may
mean Motown, but a Temptations
concert can attract few whites to
the Civic Center to see it.
One almost goes through basic
training before attempting such an
excursion — learning places to
park, which ramp to walk on,
which elevator to ride, which
ticket to buy. Hints of dire
consequences underline every
piece of "advice".
Downtown Deadly
As a result, downtown Detroit
is dismally deserted by almost
everyone. Most restaurants have
moved to the suburbs, as have
stores, offices, and factories.
What remains are a few banks,
some old office towers,
half—filled garages, and empty
sidewalks. Huge portions of the
downtown area are razed, making
way for urban renewal that may
force feed life into the town.
Above the scene of the
desolation is a billboard erected
by the new mayor, Roman
Gribbs. It reads, "This may be the
Dawn of a New Detroit." Viewing
the devastation around it, one can
only hope so.
Not even Princeton could hold
a crowd. It wasn't the acting; and
even the material wasn't bad.
Detroit just wasn't ready for it.
What had been a warm and
well dressed crowd of local alumni
out to see the Triangle show — a
student produced variety show
that has toured the country since
the turn of the century — became
a hostile pack of catcallers as the
sons of Princeton watched
contemporary Princeton men and
women toss violence war, racism,
and censorship out of a script and
into the fray.
By intermission, close to fifty
of the five hundred person
audience had left; another one
hundred respectable alums
stomped out before the final
curtain. The rest didn't tarry long
either. To Californians raised on
Hayokawan stereotypes of the
new left, it was one right from the
SDS notebook.
Tension in Town
The rudeness, bitterness, and
hostility unleashed by a college
roadshow were not unusual. These
emotions and reactions course
throughout Motown.
In an upper middle class
neighborhood within city limits, a
mother who braved the Freedom
Rides ten years ago won't let her
child go to the store.
Not that there are many stores
left; this area saw many of its
stores burned out during the 1967
riots. Some never reopened, and
those that are open have changed
to accomodate a less affluent
clientele. To find a pair of
sweatsocks on Livernois — once
the "Avenue of Fashion" — is in
1969 an impossibility.
Walking with Mace
An elderly couple continues its
walks at night — bolstered now
with a thick walking stick and a can
of Mace.
"It all come on so suddenly,"
says a housewife preparing to
move to the suburbs. "There's no
time to react to anything."
Some are digging in to stay —

buying locks, replacing stained
glass windows with safer
aluminum frames, raising dogs,
and hiring watchmen. Those who
leave don't escape.
Suburban Paranoia
The paranoia does not stop at
city limits. Five miles north of the
city, in suburban development,
people lock their cars as soon as
they get in. Most homes are
locked at all times, and fancier
suburbs have private guards to
supplement local law and order.
Many well—to—do blacks
follow the same course. Some of
the most vehement defenders of
current school boundaries are
blacks defending "good"
elementary schools against poorer
blacks.
