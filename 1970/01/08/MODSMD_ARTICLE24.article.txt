# Swimming Season Opens Saturday
## 
### 
A grueling schedule, the advent
of a talented group of freshmen
and the return of a large
contingent of record-setting
lettermen will all be combined to
add excitement to Stanford's
1970 swimming season, which
begins this Saturday.
Coach Jim Gaughran's squad
opens the home season with the
Stanford Invitational Relays in
the Encina Pools here Saturday at
2 p.m. Swimmers from the Santa
Clara Swim Club and the Foothill
Aquatic Club will compete with
Stanford swimmers from the
varsity, JV, and freshmen levels.
The meet is the traditional
relay opener for the Indians, and
although scheduling complications
have kept the number of
participants lower than usual, it
looks to be an exciting affair.
Gaughran says that his swimmers
"are in the best shape they've ever
been this early in the year."
The squad has just returned
from the Hawaii Swim Forum
Collegiate Invitational, a
two-week training session which
culminated in a seven team meet.
Outstanding performers for the
Indians included NCAA champion
John Ferris, who swam the 200
butterfly in 1:55 and the 100 in
51.9, and newcomer Brian Job,
who turned in excellent times in
both the 100 and 200
breaststrokes.
Junior Brent Berk looked good
in the 500 freestyle and was
second only to sophomore Mark
Shelley in the 1000 freestyle.
Freshman Steve Carey won the 50
and 100 freestyles and swam a
47.8 leg of the freestyle relay
team that won.
Interesting Opponents
Stanford faced Utah, New
Mexico, University of the Pacific,
Oregon, Barbors Pt. Naval Air
Station and Brigham Young

University in the meet which
came after two weeks of twice a
day workouts in a 50 meter pool
at the Naval Base.
On January 17, the Indians
host Washington State University
in the first of six tough dual meets
before the Far Western
Invitational on Feb. 21. A meet
with the newly-powerful
Washington Huskies and a
three-team affair with Santa Clara
and Foothill lead up to a return
match between Stanford and
Yale, here on Feb. 7.
Last year Yale upset the
Indians a week after Stanford had
ended USC's long dual meet win
streak in a thrilling match before a
giant crowd here. After edging the
Trojans 57-56 the Indians had the
tables turned on them the next
week in New Haven as the Elis
astonished everyone with a
sensational 71-42 triumph. The
Tribe will be looking for revenge
when Yale makes the trip west.
Following the Yale meet,
Stanford will travel south to meet
UCLA and USC in back to back
contests on February 13 and 14.
With Stanford, USC, and UCLA
likely to be three of the top four
teams in the NCAA
Championships this year, that
weekend will provide two of the
top dual meets of the 1970
collegiate season.
The season will end for the
Indians at the University of Utah
on March 26-28 with the NCAA
Championships.
Tribe Stronger
Despite the loss through
graduation of seniors Pete Siebert,
Morgan Manning, Jeff Hammett
and Luis Nicolao, the returning
letterman and the incoming frosh,
who will be eligible for varsity
competition this year, should
leave the Tribe in an overall
stronger position than in 1969.
Nine Stanford varsity records

were broken last season, and all of
the swimmers involved in those
records return.
NCAA champions Ferris and
Fred Haywood lead the returning
swimmers. Ferris' 1:49.6
record-breaking victory in the 200
butterfly, and Haywood's win
over Charlie Hickcox in the 100
backstroke were highlights of the
1969 NCAA Championships for
the Tribe. Sophomore Dave
Shilling, runner-up in the 200
breast-stroke, and NCAA freestyle
finalists Berk, Jamie Knorr, Rick
Eagleston and Bob Jamison will
all be back for the 1970 season.
Also back from last year's
squad are freestylers Shelley, Bert
Mason, Ray Collins, Bob Bebb,
Larry Lozensky, John Glaser, Bill
Huck, and Jack Wells, along with
Rob Woolley and Larry Schadt in
the backstroke, breaststrokers Jim
Morris and Mark Bergstron and
butterfliers Terry Foote, Brook
Cross and Randy Wilkins.
Returning diver, junior Ted
Nichols, will be joined by NCAA

finalist Bill Main, who was out of
competition last year, soph Fred
Bachman, and junior college
transfer Ed. Lederman.
The presence of one of the top
ranked AAU butterfliers, Mike
Masarie, who sat out last year
following his transfer to Stanford,
also enhances the Indians'
strength in that spot.
Strong Frosh
Stanford's incoming frosh, now
eligible for four years of varsity
competition under new NCAA
rules, will be big factors in the
1970 campaign. Led by 1968
Olympian, and national
breaststroke champion Brian Job,
the frosh could make all the
difference this season. Joining Job
in immediate varsity action will be
sprinter Steve Carey and distance
freestyler Tim Broderick.
Other top frosh include
sprinter Bob Warren, freestylers
Dick Gleason, Dan Powlison, Bob
Wilson and appropriately named
Stanford Schwimer, along with
Dan Gerken in the butterfly and

individual medley, backstrokers
Mike Schoen and Stuart Rowe,
and diver Steve Riffenburgh.
Head Coach Gaughran was
captain of both the swimming and
water polo teams as a senior at
Stanford in 1954 and is now in his
tenth year as mentor here. Over
the last four years his swimmers
have compiled a 34-4-1 record,
and the outlook for the upcoming
campaign is as bright as the
records of the recent ones.
One of the year's top events
looks to be the medley relay, with
Haywood (52.5), Shilling (58.8),
Ferris (48.6) and Eagleston (46.9)
returning intact. This is the same
unit which bettered the existing
American and NCAA record by
2.7 seconds while being edged out
by Indiana last year. Newcomer
Job will be challenging for the
breaststroke spot and Carey and
Jamison are in the running for the
anchor leg.


NCAA CHAMPION: Fred Haywood is just one of a galax\ of stars swimming this season for Stanford. A 1969 Collegiate
\II American in the 100 yard backstroke, 200 backstroke, and a member of the Tribe's 400 medley relay contingent,
Haywood will see action in Saturday's meet in the Encina Pools.
A grueling schedule, the advent

Returning diver, junior Ted
Nichols, will be joined by NCAA

finalist Bill Main, who was out of
competition last year, soph Fred
Bachman, and junior college
transfer Ed. Lederman.
The presence of one of the top
ranked AAU butterfliers, Mike
Masarie, who sat out last year
following his transfer to Stanford,
also enhances the Indians'
strength in that spot.
Strong Frosh
Stanford's incoming frosh, now
eligible for four years of varsity
competition under new NCAA
rules, will be big factors in the
1970 campaign. Led by 1968
Olympian, and national
breaststroke champion Brian Job,
the frosh could make all the
difference this season. Joining Job
in immediate varsity action will be
sprinter Steve Carey and distance
freestyler Tim Broderick.
Other top frosh include
sprinter Bob Warren, freestylers
Dick Gleason, Dan Powlison, Bob
Wilson and appropriately named
Stanford Schwimer, along with
Dan Gerken in the butterfly and

individual medley, backstrokers
Mike Schoen and Stuart Rowe,
and diver Steve Riffenburgh.
Head Coach Gaughran was
captain of both the swimming and
water polo teams as a senior at
Stanford in 1954 and is now in his
tenth year as mentor here. Over
the last four years his swimmers
have compiled a 34-4-1 record,
and the outlook for the upcoming
campaign is as bright as the
records of the recent ones.
One of the year's top events
looks to be the medley relay, with
Haywood (52.5), Shilling (58.8),
Ferris (48.6) and Eagleston (46.9)
returning intact. This is the same
unit which bettered the existing
American and NCAA record by
2.7 seconds while being edged out
by Indiana last year. Newcomer
Job will be challenging for the
breaststroke spot and Carey and
Jamison are in the running for the
anchor leg.


NCAA CHAMPION: Fred Haywood is just one of a galax\ of stars swimming this season for Stanford. A 1969 Collegiate
\II American in the 100 yard backstroke, 200 backstroke, and a member of the Tribe's 400 medley relay contingent,
Haywood will see action in Saturday's meet in the Encina Pools.
A grueling schedule, the advent
of a talented group of freshmen
and the return of a large
contingent of record-setting
lettermen will all be combined to
add excitement to Stanford's
1970 swimming season, which
begins this Saturday.
Coach Jim Gaughran's squad
opens the home season with the
Stanford Invitational Relays in
the Encina Pools here Saturday at
2 p.m. Swimmers from the Santa
Clara Swim Club and the Foothill
Aquatic Club will compete with
Stanford swimmers from the
varsity, JV, and freshmen levels.
The meet is the traditional
relay opener for the Indians, and
although scheduling complications
have kept the number of
participants lower than usual, it
looks to be an exciting affair.
Gaughran says that his swimmers
"are in the best shape they've ever
been this early in the year."
The squad has just returned
from the Hawaii Swim Forum
Collegiate Invitational, a
two-week training session which
culminated in a seven team meet.
Outstanding performers for the
Indians included NCAA champion
John Ferris, who swam the 200
butterfly in 1:55 and the 100 in
51.9, and newcomer Brian Job,
who turned in excellent times in
both the 100 and 200
breaststrokes.
Junior Brent Berk looked good
in the 500 freestyle and was
second only to sophomore Mark
Shelley in the 1000 freestyle.
Freshman Steve Carey won the 50
and 100 freestyles and swam a
47.8 leg of the freestyle relay
team that won.
Interesting Opponents
Stanford faced Utah, New
Mexico, University of the Pacific,
Oregon, Barbors Pt. Naval Air
Station and Brigham Young

University in the meet which
came after two weeks of twice a
day workouts in a 50 meter pool
at the Naval Base.
On January 17, the Indians
host Washington State University
in the first of six tough dual meets
before the Far Western
Invitational on Feb. 21. A meet
with the newly-powerful
Washington Huskies and a
three-team affair with Santa Clara
and Foothill lead up to a return
match between Stanford and
Yale, here on Feb. 7.
Last year Yale upset the
Indians a week after Stanford had
ended USC's long dual meet win
streak in a thrilling match before a
giant crowd here. After edging the
Trojans 57-56 the Indians had the
tables turned on them the next
week in New Haven as the Elis
astonished everyone with a
sensational 71-42 triumph. The
Tribe will be looking for revenge
when Yale makes the trip west.
Following the Yale meet,
Stanford will travel south to meet
UCLA and USC in back to back
contests on February 13 and 14.
With Stanford, USC, and UCLA
likely to be three of the top four
teams in the NCAA
Championships this year, that
weekend will provide two of the
top dual meets of the 1970
collegiate season.
The season will end for the
Indians at the University of Utah
on March 26-28 with the NCAA
Championships.
Tribe Stronger
Despite the loss through
graduation of seniors Pete Siebert,
Morgan Manning, Jeff Hammett
and Luis Nicolao, the returning
letterman and the incoming frosh,
who will be eligible for varsity
competition this year, should
leave the Tribe in an overall
stronger position than in 1969.
Nine Stanford varsity records

were broken last season, and all of
the swimmers involved in those
records return.
NCAA champions Ferris and
Fred Haywood lead the returning
swimmers. Ferris' 1:49.6
record-breaking victory in the 200
butterfly, and Haywood's win
over Charlie Hickcox in the 100
backstroke were highlights of the
1969 NCAA Championships for
the Tribe. Sophomore Dave
Shilling, runner-up in the 200
breast-stroke, and NCAA freestyle
finalists Berk, Jamie Knorr, Rick
Eagleston and Bob Jamison will
all be back for the 1970 season.
Also back from last year's
squad are freestylers Shelley, Bert
Mason, Ray Collins, Bob Bebb,
Larry Lozensky, John Glaser, Bill
Huck, and Jack Wells, along with
Rob Woolley and Larry Schadt in
the backstroke, breaststrokers Jim
Morris and Mark Bergstron and
butterfliers Terry Foote, Brook
Cross and Randy Wilkins.

match between Stanford and
Yale, here on Feb. 7.
Last year Yale upset the
Indians a week after Stanford had
ended USC's long dual meet win
streak in a thrilling match before a
giant crowd here. After edging the
Trojans 57-56 the Indians had the
tables turned on them the next
week in New Haven as the Elis
astonished everyone with a
sensational 71-42 triumph. The
Tribe will be looking for revenge
when Yale makes the trip west.
Following the Yale meet,
Stanford will travel south to meet
UCLA and USC in back to back
contests on February 13 and 14.
With Stanford, USC, and UCLA
likely to be three of the top four
teams in the NCAA
Championships this year, that
weekend will provide two of the
top dual meets of the 1970
collegiate season.
The season will end for the
Indians at the University of Utah
on March 26-28 with the NCAA
Championships.
Tribe Stronger
Despite the loss through
graduation of seniors Pete Siebert,
Morgan Manning, Jeff Hammett
and Luis Nicolao, the returning
letterman and the incoming frosh,
who will be eligible for varsity
competition this year, should
leave the Tribe in an overall
stronger position than in 1969.
Nine Stanford varsity records

were broken last season, and all of
the swimmers involved in those
records return.
NCAA champions Ferris and
Fred Haywood lead the returning
swimmers. Ferris' 1:49.6
record-breaking victory in the 200
butterfly, and Haywood's win
over Charlie Hickcox in the 100
backstroke were highlights of the
1969 NCAA Championships for
the Tribe. Sophomore Dave
Shilling, runner-up in the 200
breast-stroke, and NCAA freestyle
finalists Berk, Jamie Knorr, Rick
Eagleston and Bob Jamison will
all be back for the 1970 season.
Also back from last year's
squad are freestylers Shelley, Bert
Mason, Ray Collins, Bob Bebb,
Larry Lozensky, John Glaser, Bill
Huck, and Jack Wells, along with
Rob Woolley and Larry Schadt in
the backstroke, breaststrokers Jim
Morris and Mark Bergstron and
butterfliers Terry Foote, Brook
Cross and Randy Wilkins.
Returning diver, junior Ted
Nichols, will be joined by NCAA

finalist Bill Main, who was out of
competition last year, soph Fred
Bachman, and junior college
transfer Ed. Lederman.
The presence of one of the top
ranked AAU butterfliers, Mike
Masarie, who sat out last year
following his transfer to Stanford,
also enhances the Indians'
strength in that spot.
Strong Frosh
Stanford's incoming frosh, now
eligible for four years of varsity
competition under new NCAA
rules, will be big factors in the
1970 campaign. Led by 1968
Olympian, and national
breaststroke champion Brian Job,
the frosh could make all the
difference this season. Joining Job
in immediate varsity action will be
sprinter Steve Carey and distance
freestyler Tim Broderick.
Other top frosh include
sprinter Bob Warren, freestylers
Dick Gleason, Dan Powlison, Bob
Wilson and appropriately named
Stanford Schwimer, along with
Dan Gerken in the butterfly and

individual medley, backstrokers
Mike Schoen and Stuart Rowe,
and diver Steve Riffenburgh.
Head Coach Gaughran was
captain of both the swimming and
water polo teams as a senior at
Stanford in 1954 and is now in his
tenth year as mentor here. Over
the last four years his swimmers
have compiled a 34-4-1 record,
and the outlook for the upcoming
campaign is as bright as the
records of the recent ones.
One of the year's top events
looks to be the medley relay, with
Haywood (52.5), Shilling (58.8),
Ferris (48.6) and Eagleston (46.9)
returning intact. This is the same
unit which bettered the existing
American and NCAA record by
2.7 seconds while being edged out
by Indiana last year. Newcomer
Job will be challenging for the
breaststroke spot and Carey and
Jamison are in the running for the
anchor leg.


NCAA CHAMPION: Fred Haywood is just one of a galax\ of stars swimming this season for Stanford. A 1969 Collegiate
\II American in the 100 yard backstroke, 200 backstroke, and a member of the Tribe's 400 medley relay contingent,
Haywood will see action in Saturday's meet in the Encina Pools.
A grueling schedule, the advent
of a talented group of freshmen
and the return of a large
contingent of record-setting
lettermen will all be combined to
add excitement to Stanford's
1970 swimming season, which
begins this Saturday.
Coach Jim Gaughran's squad
opens the home season with the
Stanford Invitational Relays in
the Encina Pools here Saturday at
2 p.m. Swimmers from the Santa
Clara Swim Club and the Foothill
Aquatic Club will compete with
Stanford swimmers from the
varsity, JV, and freshmen levels.
The meet is the traditional
relay opener for the Indians, and
although scheduling complications
have kept the number of
participants lower than usual, it
looks to be an exciting affair.
Gaughran says that his swimmers
"are in the best shape they've ever
been this early in the year."
The squad has just returned
from the Hawaii Swim Forum
Collegiate Invitational, a
two-week training session which
culminated in a seven team meet.
Outstanding performers for the
Indians included NCAA champion
John Ferris, who swam the 200
butterfly in 1:55 and the 100 in
51.9, and newcomer Brian Job,
who turned in excellent times in
both the 100 and 200
breaststrokes.
Junior Brent Berk looked good
in the 500 freestyle and was
second only to sophomore Mark
Shelley in the 1000 freestyle.
Freshman Steve Carey won the 50
and 100 freestyles and swam a
47.8 leg of the freestyle relay
team that won.
Interesting Opponents
Stanford faced Utah, New
Mexico, University of the Pacific,
Oregon, Barbors Pt. Naval Air
Station and Brigham Young

University in the meet which
came after two weeks of twice a
day workouts in a 50 meter pool
at the Naval Base.
On January 17, the Indians
host Washington State University
in the first of six tough dual meets
before the Far Western
Invitational on Feb. 21. A meet
with the newly-powerful
Washington Huskies and a
three-team affair with Santa Clara
and Foothill lead up to a return
match between Stanford and
Yale, here on Feb. 7.
