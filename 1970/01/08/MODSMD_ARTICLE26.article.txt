# Theta Delts Take Mural Point Lead
## 
### SCOTT BURNS 
For the fourth quarter in a row
the Theta Delts lead all other IM
teams in the point standings, even
though the lead is not really
convincing. Right behind them in
the standings are the KA's and the
Alpha Sigs, who also used overall
participation in all sports to
accumulate their points. Oddly
enough, the Theta Delts got all
their points without winning a
single title in any sportâ€”they just
took lots of seconds and thirds in
the tournaments.
El Toro again cleaned up on
the "L" taking sixth place overall,
while being 29 places above the
next highest eating club team. The
Dislocations, in trying to repeat
their football championship,
accumulated enough points to
give them eighth place and the
highest independent team
standing. The First Year Biz team
was the highest placing graduate
team taking 9th place.
Branner placed highest among
the coed dorms (16th), while
Burbank was the highest among
the upper class dorms (19th).
Trancos was the top freshman
dorm (24th). Roble ended up
taking last place by being the only
team to go into the hole (-8
points).

Last Quarter
The Alpha Sigs won the "B"
football tournament at the end of
last quarter by upending the KA's
2 6-6. The passing of Doug
Thompson to John Haxo, Dave
Harper, and Nick Farwell put the
Alpha Sigs in the lead 13-0 and
after that the KA's had real
problems catching up. The alert
Alpha Sig defense picked off
seven KA passes in the game to
stop almost all KA threats.
As the score became 19-6 in
the second half, the victory keg
was tapped by the leaders. Since
this reporter was helping to
celebrate the victory at the keg,
recollections of the last part of
the game are sketchy, and for the
life of me, I can't remember how
the Alpha Sigs made their last
touchdown. All I know is that
they won 26-6.
Under infinite pressure, the
Med School team (of Jim Green,
Marty Josephson, and Jim
Williams) overcame the challenge
of the SAE's to win the billiards
tourney. Even though the SAE's
showed more precision in sinking
balls, 174-158, Med won on
match play.
The KA team of Chuck
Coolidge and Jack Krug beat the
Phuds to win the Tennis Doubles
Tournament, and the DU "A"
team of Don Ingram and Mike
Stevens spiked their way to the
Two-Man Volleyball
championship over the Defending
Champs (the Dekes).
