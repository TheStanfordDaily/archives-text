# Local Draft Calls
## Equality To Be Maintained 
### 
Local draft boards, following
instructions issued from the
national Selective Service System,
will not be inducting anyone into
the military in January with a
lottery number above 30.
Many draft boards, however, in
order to meet their quota, have
had to induct men with numbers
as high as 30. While there will be
no problems in meeting quotas,
the Selective Service had not
anticipated reaching No. 30 this
early.
State draft directors
questioned on this development
said they believed that the
reaching of the designated "stop"
so early in the first month of the
lottery was an indication that men
with numbers into the 300's
would be drafted in 1970.
White House officials,
nonetheless, are sticking to their
original estimate that men with
numbers in the top third of the

lottery stand slim chance of being
drafted.
The No. 30 guideline is an
attempt, according to the national
Selective Service headquarters, to
maintain a measure of equality
between states—and draft boards
within states—while filling the
12,500 quota requested by the
Defense Department.
The number 30 was chosen,
officials said, because it represents
approximately one-twelfth of the
366 birthdates in the lottery pool.
Court Challenge
In another development, the
new draft lottery is being
challenged in a Wisconsin Federal
district court. David S. Stodolsky,
a University of Wisconsin student,
filed suit on grounds that the
lottery is biased against men born
late in the year.
The suit seeks to void the
December 1, 1969 lottery and

force a new drawing. Mr.
Stodolsky's lawyers are arguing
that the Executive order behind
the lottery called for a random
drawing and that the actual
drawing was not random.
Stodolsky also asked U.S.
District Judge James Doyle to
prevent the Selective Service
System from inducting men until
a new lottery can be held.
However, Judge Doyle denied the
request, saying that there was not
enough evidence to warrant an
injunction.
"Randomn ess" Questioned
The issue at stake is precisely
the drawing's "randomness." A
nuclear chemist at Berkeley's
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory,
Frank Asaro, said that the odds
against getting the pattern of
birthdates that was pulled from
bowl are more than 10,000 to
one.
Other experts in probability
said that there are enormous odds
against a random selection process
producing the result of last
month's lottery; one estimate,
from a University of Michigan
professor, was "over 100,000 to
one."
It is overwhelmingly clear that
men born in the latter half of the
year —especially in November and
December —got early numbers on
the list, while those born in early
months got "safer" numbers. The

average number for men born in
January is 201; the average for
December is 122. If the draw was
random, each month could be
expected to have an average
around 183-184.
Layering Effect
According to Dr. Asaro and the
other critics, what happened was a
"Layering" effect in its giant
bowl—produced by inadvertantly
stacking the capsuled numbers in
a month-after-month order and a
failure to stir the total mixture.
A Selective Service spokesman
denied that a "layering" had
taken place in the final capsule
arrangement in the bowl. He siad
that the officials first counted the
January capsules into a large box,
and segregated them with a
divider while the February
capsules were counted into the
box.
The divider was then removed
and the two months apparently
"mixed." The same procedure was
followed for the succeeding
months, a month being counted
out and then pushed together
with the previous months.
The box was then shut and
shaken several times and carried
up several flights of stairs, which,
according to the spokesman, Navy
Captain William Pascoex, further
mixed the capsules. The capsules
were then dumped from about
three feet over the howl.
