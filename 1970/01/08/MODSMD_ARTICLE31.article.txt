## 
### FRED MANN 
Raymond F. Bacchetti,
assistant provost and director of
the Stanford summer session, has
been appointed associate provost
of the university.
At the same time, associate
dean of students Sally Mahoney
has been moved up to fill
Bacchetti's post as assistant
provost and summer session head.
Bacchetti's appointment by
President Kenneth S. Pitzer is
effective immediately. He
previously served as assistant dean
of the school of humanities and
sciences and assistant to the
chancellor of the City University
of New York.
The 36 year old administrator
returned to Stanford in 1966 as
assistant to the provost, and was
named assistant provost the next
year. He holds bachelors and
masters degrees from Rutgers
University, and a doctorate in
higher education from Stanford.
Bacchetti has been active in
different minority student

programs at Stanford, and has
been involved in numerous special
projects. As a member of the task
force committee, he is actively
involved in admission and
recruitment of minority students.
It is expected Bacchetti will
continue with more or less the
same duties in his new position.
Included in his plans are work on
the American Indian program, the
budget and budget reduction
programs, and work as unofficial
laison between Stanford and
Nairobi College.
"It's really a mixed bag of
duties," said Bacchetti. "I am
especially interested in minority
affairs, but all of us on the
Provost staff are generalists. We
have to handle all sorts of
problems."
One of his first tasks will be to
appoint a university Ombudsman
at the beginning of next month.
Miss Mahoney will also join the
staff of the Provost at the
conclusion of her duties in the
Dean of Students office.
