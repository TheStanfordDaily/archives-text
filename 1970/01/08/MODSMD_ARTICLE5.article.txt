# Student Senate Backs Braunstein For Post
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
In a purposeful display, the
student Senate last night
nominated Yale Braunstein for a
student position on the trustee
committee on finance.
Braunstein's nomination had
previously been vetoed by
President Kenneth Pitzer because
he is on probation. One of the
conditions of his probation was
that he not serve on committees
appointed by the President or
other members of the
administration.
The first step in his approval
came when the Senate supported
a resolution to President Pitzer
stating that the ASSU
Constitution says that any
registered student is eligible for
any committee position.
The constitution states that
"The Committee on Nominations

shall announce all positions for
which it seeks representation to
the entire association. All
members of the Association shall
be accorded equal opportunity to
apply for these positions (Article
11, Section 8.)
Resolution
The Senate resolved that "it is
the firm opinion of the Senate of
the ASSU that any student who is
a registered student, is eligible for
nomination by the ASSU
Nomination Committee."
A clause which would have
asked President Pitzer to
reconsider the case at hand was
deleted because the Senate felt
that it weakened the resolution.
The resolution was introduced
by Senator Jim Schnieder, a
frequent foe of Braunstein in past
Senate meetings. Schnieder said
that he introduced the resolution
as a matter of principle.
Braunstein later publicly
thanked his former foes in the
Senate who endorsed him on the
resolution.
Three motives seemed to have
underlined the Senate's strong
statement. One was the feeling
that Braunstein was the student
most qualified to sit on the
trustee finance committee because
of his knowledge of the subject
and his sharp eye for detail.
Reasons for Support
Many of the more radical
members of the Senate also
supported the recommendation in
the belief that the President does
not have the power to exclude a
student from committees because
he is on probation. They feel that
this power did not exist in the
past and that President Pitzer
appropriated the power.
Other Senators supported
Braunstein on principle: either
that the committee on
Nomination's nominations should
always be accepted or that the
Senate has the right to appoint
members to committees.
These people combined to pass
the resolution nearly
unanimousily. There was almost

no open opposition to Braunstein
or the resolution in the debates,
except to question its weakness.
Braunstein's Claim
Braunstein claimed that he is
already on one committee
appointed by the President, and
that students with probation
conditions similar to his have been
accepted by President Pitzer for
committees, implying that he is
being kept only off this specific
committee.
Prof. .lack Fried en thai,
chairman of the Stanford Judicial
Council attended the meeting to
explain to the Senators the
judicial procedures that
Braunstein went through before
being placed on probation.
