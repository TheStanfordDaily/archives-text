# One Coyote Hill Contract Cancelled

### BOB LITTERMAN 
Syntex Corporation cancelled
its participation in the Coyote Hill
Animal Research Facility
yesterday in the face of Tuesday's
unexpectedly high construction
bids.
Robert Lindee, associate dean
of administration at the Medical
School indicated that the
University is still evaluating the
possibility of proceeding with the
project on its own.
According to Dr. Robert J.
Glaser, vice-president for medical
affairs and dean of the School of
Medicine, the University has
received a 60-day extension on a
grant for the project from the
National Institutes of Health to
explore alternative plans for the
Center.
"The need for animal research
facilities is and will become
increasingly more urgent," Dr.
Glaser said. "We are hopeful that

necessary funds will become
available so that construction on
the most critical portions of the
proposed facility can begin in the
near future."
According to Lindee, the
University is trying to find ways
to scale down the size of the
project to its bare minimum
However, he said it would still
need an additional source of
funds.
The Animal Research center
was conceived two years ago as a
joint project by the University
and Syntex Corporation. The
University planned to construct,
own and manage the Center and
lease part of the facility to
Syntex. Funds for the center were
to have been provided by a
$281,000 grant from the National
Institutes of Health to the School
of Medicine and a matching
amount by Syntex Corporation.
