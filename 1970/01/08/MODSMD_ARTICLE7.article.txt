# Stanford Land's Pathway To Development
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
(First of a three-part series)
Stanford represents a builders dream - an open island in a sea of
swiftly rising urbanization.
It remains the largest piece of undeveloped land in Santa Clara
Valley, a place where many crowded people are eager to secure room
to build homes, schools, hospitals, parks and industries to provide
jobs.
But Stanford lands are not for sale. In 188f> Senator Leland
Stanford laid down the first guidelines for the use of the land. "The
endowment of (these) lands (is) made because they are, in themselves,
of great value, and their proper management will insure the university
an income much greater than would be realized were their value to be
invested in any reliable, interest bearing security."
The Senator did not, however, spell out the details of "proper
management." He felt that a flexible policy would help the University
to adapt to changing needs in the future.
Pre-World War II Problems
Before World War II Stanford ran into few land development
problems. Open lands abounded, community demands were few, tax
pressures were light, and there was plenty of money available to pay
for educational needs.
After the war, conditions changed rapidly. The University's
enrollment rose from 7,244 to 12,024 and the population of San
Mateo and Santa Clara Counties soared from 418,000 to 1,460,000.
Holding on to its open lands during such a phenomenal growth period
began to make Stanford look rather conservative. Moreover, as a
private institution, the University's lands always have vulnerable to
condemnation.
Over the years Stanford has given land for the railroad
right-of-way, E. Camino Real, Palo Alto High School, Palo Alto
Hospital, a city reservoir, the Veterans Administration Hospital, the
Hetch Hetchy water line, the new Junipero Serra Freeway, and
numberous other community needs.
Protection
In order to protect its lands from widespread condemnation, soon
after World War II President Donald Tresidder established the
University Planning Office. Since then, a series of Master Plans of
Land Use have been prepared and used as guides for the utilization
and preservation of the 8800 acres of Stanford property.

At the time, a faculty committee noted, "It took a great many
meetings for us all truly to appreciate that the planning cannot please
everyone, not even the 10 members of the committee. Most of us
would still prefer to see Stanford's lands kept open as farm lands, but
we know this is not feasible."
According to University Documents, Stanford developed its lands
for three reasons: to secure funds to support its educational program,
to pay tin 1 relentlessly increasing taxes on all lands not actually used
for academic purposes, and to protect the open lands from
condemnation by neighboring communities.
Risiiic Costs
In 1950, the University was faced with rising educational costs, the
need to expand and renovate facilities, and a student body which had
doubled in the past four years. Meanwhile, taxes had risen to the
point where agricultural use of the land no longer paid for itself
Planning studies conducted at the request of the trustees
several land developments which might serve both the public and the
University. First, the trustees authorized the construction of the

Stanford Shopping Center. The Center generated property and sales
tax revenue for schools, the city and Santa Clara County while,
yielding income for the University.
The committee on Plant Development, organized in 1950, became
the I'acuity Advisory Committee on Land and Building Development
in 1951. Its prupose has been to make recommendations to the
President of the University on all land and building proposals. Three
students were added to the group in 1967-68.
In 1953 the University conducted a comprehensive land use study.
That study, and a second one three years later, placed heavy emphasis
on land development.
Policies Slated
In 1954 the trustees stated several broad land development
policies:
1. That in granting these lands, the founders chose to locate the
University thereon with awareness that the natural beauty and other
esthetic qualities of the lands would have a direct influence upon the
future of the University;
2. That it is encumbent upon the trustees to preserve these
qualities . . . while at the same time using (the lands) for the material
benefit of the University;
3. That the customary considerations applying to the subdivision
of lands for utilitarian purposes will be applied . . . (but) that material
gain is not necessarily the governing factor;
4. That the aid of the development shall be to produce ... a
community of which the trustees and all those who have (the
University's) welfare at heart can be proud, and that will, by reason of
the fact that it. is a university project, serve in an important way as an
educational example in the field of community development.
Academic Reserve
In accordance with these principles today's master plan leaves
nearly two-thirds of the University's available land, 52.39 acres, in
Academic Reserve. On the 940 acres which have been developed,
Stanford has been very strict in insuring proper use of the land.
The Stanford Industrial Park was born in 1951 when Varian
Associates leased 10 acres in the southeast corner of University
property. During the first five years of i'- development, the Park t>jev

Stanford represents a builders dream - an open island in a sea of
swiftly rising urbanization.
It remains the largest piece of undeveloped land in Santa Clara
Valley, a place where many crowded people are eager to secure room
to build homes, schools, hospitals, parks and industries to provide
jobs.
But Stanford lands are not for sale. In 188f> Senator Leland
Stanford laid down the first guidelines for the use of the land. "The
endowment of (these) lands (is) made because they are, in themselves,
of great value, and their proper management will insure the university
an income much greater than would be realized were their value to be
invested in any reliable, interest bearing security."
The Senator did not, however, spell out the details of "proper
management." He felt that a flexible policy would help the University
to adapt to changing needs in the future.
Pre-World War II Problems
Before World War II Stanford ran into few land development
problems. Open lands abounded, community demands were few, tax
pressures were light, and there was plenty of money available to pay
for educational needs.
After the war, conditions changed rapidly. The University's
enrollment rose from 7,244 to 12,024 and the population of San
Mateo and Santa Clara Counties soared from 418,000 to 1,460,000.
Holding on to its open lands during such a phenomenal growth period
began to make Stanford look rather conservative. Moreover, as a
private institution, the University's lands always have vulnerable to
condemnation.
Over the years Stanford has given land for the railroad
right-of-way, E. Camino Real, Palo Alto High School, Palo Alto
Hospital, a city reservoir, the Veterans Administration Hospital, the
Hetch Hetchy water line, the new Junipero Serra Freeway, and
numberous other community needs.
Protection
In order to protect its lands from widespread condemnation, soon
after World War II President Donald Tresidder established the
University Planning Office. Since then, a series of Master Plans of
Land Use have been prepared and used as guides for the utilization
and preservation of the 8800 acres of Stanford property.

At the time, a faculty committee noted, "It took a great many
meetings for us all truly to appreciate that the planning cannot please
everyone, not even the 10 members of the committee. Most of us
would still prefer to see Stanford's lands kept open as farm lands, but
we know this is not feasible."
According to University Documents, Stanford developed its lands
for three reasons: to secure funds to support its educational program,
to pay tin 1 relentlessly increasing taxes on all lands not actually used
for academic purposes, and to protect the open lands from
condemnation by neighboring communities.
Risiiic Costs
In 1950, the University was faced with rising educational costs, the
need to expand and renovate facilities, and a student body which had
doubled in the past four years. Meanwhile, taxes had risen to the
point where agricultural use of the land no longer paid for itself
Planning studies conducted at the request of the trustees
several land developments which might serve both the public and the
University. First, the trustees authorized the construction of the

Stanford Shopping Center. The Center generated property and sales
tax revenue for schools, the city and Santa Clara County while,
yielding income for the University.
The committee on Plant Development, organized in 1950, became
the I'acuity Advisory Committee on Land and Building Development
in 1951. Its prupose has been to make recommendations to the
President of the University on all land and building proposals. Three
students were added to the group in 1967-68.
In 1953 the University conducted a comprehensive land use study.
That study, and a second one three years later, placed heavy emphasis
on land development.
Policies Slated
In 1954 the trustees stated several broad land development
policies:
1. That in granting these lands, the founders chose to locate the
University thereon with awareness that the natural beauty and other
esthetic qualities of the lands would have a direct influence upon the
future of the University;
2. That it is encumbent upon the trustees to preserve these
qualities . . . while at the same time using (the lands) for the material
benefit of the University;
3. That the customary considerations applying to the subdivision
of lands for utilitarian purposes will be applied . . . (but) that material
gain is not necessarily the governing factor;
4. That the aid of the development shall be to produce ... a
community of which the trustees and all those who have (the
University's) welfare at heart can be proud, and that will, by reason of
the fact that it. is a university project, serve in an important way as an
educational example in the field of community development.

Academic Reserve. On the 940 acres which have been developed,

Stanford represents a builders dream - an open island in a sea of
swiftly rising urbanization.
It remains the largest piece of undeveloped land in Santa Clara
Valley, a place where many crowded people are eager to secure room
to build homes, schools, hospitals, parks and industries to provide
jobs.
But Stanford lands are not for sale. In 188f> Senator Leland
Stanford laid down the first guidelines for the use of the land. "The
endowment of (these) lands (is) made because they are, in themselves,
of great value, and their proper management will insure the university
an income much greater than would be realized were their value to be
invested in any reliable, interest bearing security."
The Senator did not, however, spell out the details of "proper
management." He felt that a flexible policy would help the University
to adapt to changing needs in the future.
Pre-World War II Problems
Before World War II Stanford ran into few land development
problems. Open lands abounded, community demands were few, tax
pressures were light, and there was plenty of money available to pay
for educational needs.
After the war, conditions changed rapidly. The University's
enrollment rose from 7,244 to 12,024 and the population of San
Mateo and Santa Clara Counties soared from 418,000 to 1,460,000.
Holding on to its open lands during such a phenomenal growth period
began to make Stanford look rather conservative. Moreover, as a
private institution, the University's lands always have vulnerable to
condemnation.
Over the years Stanford has given land for the railroad
right-of-way, E. Camino Real, Palo Alto High School, Palo Alto
Hospital, a city reservoir, the Veterans Administration Hospital, the
Hetch Hetchy water line, the new Junipero Serra Freeway, and
numberous other community needs.
Protection
In order to protect its lands from widespread condemnation, soon
after World War II President Donald Tresidder established the
University Planning Office. Since then, a series of Master Plans of
Land Use have been prepared and used as guides for the utilization
and preservation of the 8800 acres of Stanford property.

At the time, a faculty committee noted, "It took a great many
meetings for us all truly to appreciate that the planning cannot please
everyone, not even the 10 members of the committee. Most of us
would still prefer to see Stanford's lands kept open as farm lands, but
we know this is not feasible."
According to University Documents, Stanford developed its lands
for three reasons: to secure funds to support its educational program,
to pay tin 1 relentlessly increasing taxes on all lands not actually used
for academic purposes, and to protect the open lands from
condemnation by neighboring communities.
Risiiic Costs
In 1950, the University was faced with rising educational costs, the
need to expand and renovate facilities, and a student body which had
doubled in the past four years. Meanwhile, taxes had risen to the
point where agricultural use of the land no longer paid for itself
Planning studies conducted at the request of the trustees
several land developments which might serve both the public and the
University. First, the trustees authorized the construction of the

Stanford Shopping Center. The Center generated property and sales
tax revenue for schools, the city and Santa Clara County while,
yielding income for the University.
The committee on Plant Development, organized in 1950, became
the I'acuity Advisory Committee on Land and Building Development
in 1951. Its prupose has been to make recommendations to the
President of the University on all land and building proposals. Three
students were added to the group in 1967-68.
In 1953 the University conducted a comprehensive land use study.
That study, and a second one three years later, placed heavy emphasis
on land development.
Policies Slated
In 1954 the trustees stated several broad land development
policies:
1. That in granting these lands, the founders chose to locate the
University thereon with awareness that the natural beauty and other
esthetic qualities of the lands would have a direct influence upon the
future of the University;
2. That it is encumbent upon the trustees to preserve these
qualities . . . while at the same time using (the lands) for the material
benefit of the University;
3. That the customary considerations applying to the subdivision
of lands for utilitarian purposes will be applied . . . (but) that material
