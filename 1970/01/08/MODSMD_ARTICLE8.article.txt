## On Graduate Fellowships 
### Barry Askinas 
I spent part of my Christmas
vacation in Washington, D.C.,
lobbying with government and
educational association officials to
change the nature of graduate
student fellowship support. At a
time when more and more
universities are making
commitments to recruit and enroll
graduate students from minority
and other disadvantaged groups,
funds for the support of graduate
education are drying up. A f^w

years ago, grad students in the
major institutions could look
forward (often in all but the
hard-core humanities), to several
years of funding. The federal
government gave out fellowships
and traineeships—NSF, NDE,
NIH; the university itself, or the
foundations—Ford, Woodrow
Wilson Danforth, provided more;
and finally there was always a
teaching or research assistantship
from some professor ready and

willing to exploit the willing
student. Ten years ago, when a
graduate student received about
$2000 a year, he could live fairly
well. Today, with $2500, he
cannot: that is, if he can get the
$2500.
Suddenly, the government is
cutting back, both in the number
of fellowships and in the research
funds which also support graduate
students. Universities already hurt
by shrinking alumni

contributions, are taking money
out of graduate student support
to cover the salaries of professors
affected by the research cutbacks.
Foundations for the most part are
putting their money elsewhere.
While undergraduate and
professional graduate student
(law, medicine, business) aid has
been based on need, graduate aid
in the academic disciplines has
depended largely on merit. If you
were "good" you got money, and
everybody got about the same.
With fewer fellowships
available, and even those few,
often providing insufficient funds
to live on, where does this leave
the poor student? the minority
student? How can he go to
graduate school? The funds have
to come from somewhere.
In a time of scarcity, we can no
longer afford to subsidize the
affluent as we support the less
affluent. I propose that a need
concept be introduced ijito
graduate student aid, bringing it
more into line with undergraduate
and professional student
scholarship support.
However, I do not propose
totally throwing out the idea of
support based in merit. Rather the
graduate student should receive a
minimum stipend as a result of
merit, and how much more he
receives in addition would depend
on need. This gives all graduate
students a floor from which to
support themselves and maintain
their independence from their
parents (if they so choose), and at

the same time puts the burden of
further support on those most
able to support it—the relatively
affluent.
Graduate schools would
require all applicants for aid
beyond that minimum stipend, to
fill out a form similar to the
College Scholarship Service CSS
form that undergraduate students
provide. Depending on the age of
the applicant, the form would be
filled out either by the student
himself or by his parents outlining
the income, assets, recources, and
expenses of the student and his
family. It is not clear at just what
age, parents would no longer be
seen as being responsible or partly
responsible for the education of
their children, but one might
speculate that cut-off point
should lie somewhere in the age
range of twenty-three to
twenty-six.
One school acting alone or a
change in one government support
program will make little
difference. The individual
university might in fact lose many
qualified (but relatively wealthy)
graduate students to institutions
not basing fellowship support on
need. Only thru changes in
existing federal legislation and the
co-operation of graduate schools
and deans can we resolve this
national problem.

professional graduate student
(law, medicine, business) aid has
been based on need, graduate aid
in the academic disciplines has
depended largely on merit. If you
were "good" you got money, and
everybody got about the same.
With fewer fellowships
available, and even those few,
often providing insufficient funds
to live on, where does this leave
the poor student? the minority
student? How can he go to
graduate school? The funds have
to come from somewhere.
In a time of scarcity, we can no
longer afford to subsidize the
affluent as we support the less
affluent. I propose that a need
concept be introduced ijito
graduate student aid, bringing it
more into line with undergraduate
and professional student
scholarship support.
However, I do not propose
totally throwing out the idea of
support based in merit. Rather the
graduate student should receive a
minimum stipend as a result of
merit, and how much more he
receives in addition would depend
on need. This gives all graduate
students a floor from which to
support themselves and maintain
their independence from their
parents (if they so choose), and at

the same time puts the burden of
further support on those most
able to support it—the relatively
affluent.
Graduate schools would
require all applicants for aid
beyond that minimum stipend, to
fill out a form similar to the
College Scholarship Service CSS
form that undergraduate students
provide. Depending on the age of
the applicant, the form would be
filled out either by the student
himself or by his parents outlining
the income, assets, recources, and
expenses of the student and his
family. It is not clear at just what
age, parents would no longer be
seen as being responsible or partly
responsible for the education of
their children, but one might
speculate that cut-off point
should lie somewhere in the age
range of twenty-three to
twenty-six.
One school acting alone or a
change in one government support
program will make little
difference. The individual
university might in fact lose many
qualified (but relatively wealthy)
graduate students to institutions
not basing fellowship support on
need. Only thru changes in
existing federal legislation and the
co-operation of graduate schools
and deans can we resolve this
national problem.

I spent part of my Christmas
vacation in Washington, D.C.,
lobbying with government and
educational association officials to
change the nature of graduate
student fellowship support. At a
time when more and more
universities are making
commitments to recruit and enroll
graduate students from minority
and other disadvantaged groups,
funds for the support of graduate
education are drying up. A f^w

years ago, grad students in the
major institutions could look
forward (often in all but the
hard-core humanities), to several
years of funding. The federal
government gave out fellowships
and traineeships—NSF, NDE,
NIH; the university itself, or the
foundations—Ford, Woodrow
Wilson Danforth, provided more;
and finally there was always a
teaching or research assistantship
from some professor ready and

willing to exploit the willing
student. Ten years ago, when a
graduate student received about
$2000 a year, he could live fairly
well. Today, with $2500, he
cannot: that is, if he can get the
$2500.
Suddenly, the government is
cutting back, both in the number
of fellowships and in the research
funds which also support graduate
students. Universities already hurt
by shrinking alumni

contributions, are taking money
out of graduate student support
to cover the salaries of professors
affected by the research cutbacks.
Foundations for the most part are
putting their money elsewhere.
