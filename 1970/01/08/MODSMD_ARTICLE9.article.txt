Damn the Draft
(The letter below is a copy of
a letter sent to Representative
McCtoshey in Washington)
Dear Representative McCloskey:
I recently spoke with Mr. John
Wilson of your office regarding
the problems I have been having
with my Draft Board. Although
he was most considerate and
helpful, I am writing to urge you
and your office to take a stronger
stand on the question of the draft.
Mr. Wilson indicated that he
believed only the first third of the
lottery numbers drawn this year
would be drafted. Selective
.Service had made statements to
the contrary, and in at least some
jurisdictions, numbers as high as
67 have been reached in selecting
the extremely low January, 1970
• call. The lottery is a farce, and is
meaningless as long as the draft
call is so large.
The Military Selective Service
Act of 1967 is unconstitutional
both in toto and in many of its
individual parts. In regards to the
basic illegality of conscription, I
would like to refer vou to 64
Michigan L.R. 1493 "(1969), as
j well as to your Stanford
undergraduate education, where
' you were exposed to many of the
same instructors and materials
that I was during my years there.
It is my firm conviction that in a
. free society no man should have
' to give his life for his country
, unless he voluntarily chooses to do
'so (I am not talking about
criminal law, though presumably
the death penalty is a dead letter
I now). If there is no popular
i support for the military, or for a
| war, citizens should not be forced
' to participate.
The draft laws are grossly
unconstitutional in several other
! respects, as follows:
The imposition of criminal
[penalties for refusing induction or
for non-cooperation. War registers
are, nothing but political prisoners
in the classic sense of the word,
and imprisonment is a horrible
violation of their first amendment
rights. There is no demonstrable
societal need to have conscription
at all in this country, and men like
David Harris, also a Stanford
Alum, who are serving terms in
prison for having the courage to
speak up for their convictions,
• should be granted immediate
Presidential Pardons. I urge you to
press the President to take such
action.
* Registrants are denied Due
Process of Law when they are
refused the basic constitutional
right of having an attorney
present when they appear before
their local boards. Selective
Service Regulations are difficult
for attorneys to understand,
what's more the average
nineteen-year-old.
Local Boards are often
composed of bigoted, unskilled
individuals. Many of whom are
still closely associated with the
military and who would be
unqualified to sit on any other
kind of tribune in the United
States.
The 1967 Act violates the

registrant's right to interstate
travel (See Shapiro v. Thompson,
394 U.S. 606 (1969), by
prohibiting the transfer of an
individual's file from one Local
Board's jurisdiction to another's.
The happenstance of where one
registers at the age of eighteen is
binding from then on. Even now,
President Nixon is proposing
subsidies to unemployed men so
that they can move to parts of the
country where work is available.
Why should young men be forced
to communicate with a board
hundreds of miles from where
they live and work? This system
not only discriminates against the
poor, it causes all citizens an
unnecessary and wasteful expense,
and is further denial of Procedural
Due Process.
The whole concept of Local
Board autonomy is
constitutionally and logically
repugnant. Not only because of
the restrictions it puts on the right
to travel, but because the system
guarantees a lack of Equal
Protection of the Laws. Why
should a man from Westchester
County be inducted on different
grounds than a man from San
Mateo County? It is claimed that
"national" defense is involved.
Our economy and labor market
are national concerns. Then why
not have a truly national selective
service system? For any
conscientious and sensitive
citizen, being drafted is a highly
punitive procedure. If it were not
for the deplorable condition of
our prisons, two years in prison
would be preferable to two years
as a G.I. Therefore, it is vital that
if the draft is to continue at all,
full procedural protection be
given to each and every registrant.
Equal Protection is denied
registrants in certain categories as
well. For instance, 11-S deferments
must be given as a matter of law,
and yet boards often refuse to
give a student who subsequently
marries and has children a 111-A
deferment, whereas a 16-year-old
father will be exempted. This type
of discrimination against the
educated is impossible to justify.
By writing the 11-S deferment into
the statute, Congress obviously
felt it advanced national goals to
produce educated individuals who
were skilled enough to operate the
increasingly complex society we
live in today. If education is a
national goal, how can we
possibly turn around and kill off
the very people we spent millions
of dollars to produce? Is it only
because students "weren't drafted
earlier"? I could name millions
who weren't drafted for one
reason or another. Why should
students be singled out for special
hounding and persecution? Or is it
because the Pentagon insists that
the threat of the draft is necessary
to keep enlistments up?
It would certainly be
appropriate for you to introduce
legislation that calls for an
immediate end to the draft, for
whatever reasons you think are
most expedient.
1 ask only that the government
allow each citizen to pursue his

chosen career without fear of
induction and without the
necessity of carrying around a
card in his wallet which orders
him to report every change of
address to the Selective Service
System until he is 45. This system
is remarkably like the Soviet
Union's system for restricting the
mobility of its citizens, and I
would suspect that young
Americans would be more
anxious to enlist in the Armed
Forces if they had more freedoms
to protect. Please do something
before even more educated young
Americans are forced to leave the
country, to sit in prison, or to
compromise their values in order
to escape this most visible
manifestation of what is rapidly
becoming an American Police
State.

Cafeteria Defense
Editor, THE DAILY:
Peter Whitford's January 6th
letter to the Daily includes some
welcome and helpful suggestions
regarding Tresidder food service
operations. It also contains some
inaccuracies (prices have increased
about 15% over a 7 year
period—not 10% per year as
stated), the most critical of which
is the assumption of no student
involvement in operational policy.
Responsibility for the
administration of Tresidder Union
is vested in the Stanford Union
Committee, which for many years
has had equal representation from
students, faculty, and
administration; and ever since its
opening—many years before the
current focus on student
participation in University
go v e rnance—Tresidder has
operated with a Union Board
composed exclusively of students.
This Board, which is open to
any Stanford student, meets
regularly—usually once a
week—and welcomes participation
by any student interested
Without a per capita student
fee for financial support (as is
typically assessed at most College
Unions) the Stanford Union relies
on its revenue producing
operations to support such
community services as meeting
rooms, lounges, browsing room,
music-listening facilities, practice
room, information center, art
displays, ASSU office space,
Coffee House, and a variety of
programs
In successfully maintaining a
balance between the revenue
operations (including food
service) and these many activities
and their related costs, the Union
Board and Union Committee over
the years have been (and I believe
continue to be) very responsive to
the Stanford Community.
Implementing the interest of
Donald B. Tresidder, president of
Stanford University from 1943
until his death in 1948, the
Memorial Union is indeed
Stanford's community
