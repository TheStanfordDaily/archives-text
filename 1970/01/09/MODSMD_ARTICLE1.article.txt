# Dean's Decision Reversed
## Flo Mo Sexes To Integrate 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Reversing an earlier decision by
Dean of Students Peter Bulkeley,
the University Administration
yesterday agreed to allow the
residents of two Florence Moore
dormitories, one male and the
other female, to form two
co-educational residences.
The two freshman dormitories,
Loro and Paloma, will re-arrange
themselves this weekend by
lottery so that each will have one
floor of men and one of women.
This is only the second time in
recent University history that an
entire residence configuration has
been shifted in the middle of an
academic year. At the close of fall
quarter, 1968, the two houses of
Grove, which had been separated
by sexes, merged to go co-ed by
floors.
Final Assessment
Assessing the Administration's
final stand on the matter,
Bulkeley cited the "evident
maturity of the individuals" as
one determining factor in the
decision. "Considering the entire
set of circumstances," Bulkeley
said, "the decision was absolutely
right."
When the final decision to go
co-ed had been made early in
Dean Week, Paul Maxwell, the
Resident Assistant in Loro,
notified Bill Leland. According to
Maxwell, Leland was in favor of
the plan, which at that time
entailed one of the two residences
going co-ed by alternate rooms on
the same floor.
Leland told Maxwell that there
might be problems with members
of the Dean of Students' staff, but
added that he felt the two
residences had been extremely
careful of the rights of each
individual, and that the decision
had been arrived at correctly.
Freshman residents of the two
dormitories had discussed and
dismissed the possibility of
merging early last quarter, but
discussion on the subject
reappeared late in the quarter.
After lengthy meetings and a
number of votes, the residents
decided to go ahead with the plan.
New Debate
New and heated debate among
the residents broke out over
whether the new arrangement
would involve integration by
floors or by alternate rooms.
Eventually, a compromise
solution was worked, whereby
one residence would go coed with
alternate rooms, and the other by
corridors.

The eventual veto of the
residences' plan was received with
shock by the students, who had
been unaware that there was a
possibility of being overruled.
"We assumed," said Maxwell,
"that if the decision had to come
from the Dean 112 Students Office,
they would inform us of it during
the decision-making process, not
afterwards."
A letter informing the residents
of the Administration's veto was
sent to their homes during
Christmas vacation. Dean
Bulkeley, who had been in
consultation with Provost Richard
Lyman, Assistant to the President
Willard Wyman, and Leland,
explained to the Daily that "if a
precedent has been set (for
mid-year changes), it can
sometimes be interpreted as an
encouragement."
New Scrutiny
The veto was placed under
close scrutiny early this week,
after a closed meeting of the
residents of the two dorms and a
panel including Lyman and
Bulkeley. At this time Lyman
explained to the students that the
"only reasonable safeguard for
individual choice is a combination
of annual decisions and annual
choices on the configuration of
dormitories.
"Stanford can't take care of
the minorities who may object, if
there's a change every other
week," Lyman declared.
One student, replying to the
Provost, asserted that he, along
with others, felt "it's wrong to
have the horse shot out from
under us." He pointed out that, in
his view, the democratic process
had been taken almost to the
point of absurdity in an effort to
protect minority rights.
One student dissenter, who
said she had originally opposed
the plan, commented "I didn't
feel the pressure of the group. I
found my reasons against it
weren't well-founded."
A number of residents
commented that the move could
be looked on as an experiment, as
the original Grove House was.
Lyman concluded the meeting
by explaining that the decision
had been made with an eye to
protecting both the individuals
and the University.
Students Not Consulted
After the meeting, Mandy
Reynolds, president of ftiloma,
explained that she had been
informed after the resident's final
vote that the Dean of Students

Office would consult with her if
there was a possibility of a veto.
She said that the first notification
of the decision was the letter she
received over vacation.
According to Bulkeley, no
attempt to consult directly with
the students involved was made
between the time Leland
informed him of their decision
and the time he decided to
overrule it.
Last Tuesday night's meeting,
however, made a substantial
impression on the Administrators,
who deliberated two days before
reversing the decision
yesterday—while insisting that the
'alternate rooms' plan be dropped.
W. Parmer Fuller, president of
the Board of Trustees, and one
other trustee have apparently

been informed of the final
decision, but the Daily was unable
to reach Fuller last night for
comment.
Dean Bulkeley told the Daily
last night that an explanitory letter
will be sent to the parents of the
students, explaining the reasons
for the change —that the
University's interest is in the best
possible living arrangements for
students, that these students, after
careful consideration think the
change is better, and that a
detailed study of the situation is
being made.
