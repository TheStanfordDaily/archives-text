### 
John V. Tunney, three-term
Congressman for the 38th
District, put an end to year-long
rumors yesterday by announcing
that he will run for the U.S.
Senate. During his 15-minute
news conference in San Francisco,
hr said the first phase of his
campaign would concentrate on
threats to California's
environment, when he will outline
his ideas for preserving ecological
quality in the state.
Speaking in a slow, deliberate
voice, wife at side, the legislator
said he would participate in the
•lan, 28 commemoration in Santa
Barbara of last year's oil blowout.
Tunney reacted strongly to a
conjecture by the press that the
concentration by all statewide
candidates on pollution would
mask deeper differences between
them. "The problem here is one,
not of rhetoric, but of action."
The important thing, he said, is
which man can make the
necessary changes, not simply talk
about them.
