## Martha Mitchell 
### Art Buchwald ART BUCHWALD 
WASHINGTON — All of
Washington is talking about
Attorney General John Mitchell's
wife, Martha. Mrs. Mitchell has
made almost as big a splash as
Vice President Sprio Agnew, with
such remarks on TV as the one
that her husband would like to
trade some American liberals for
some Russian Communists.
She also told Time magazine's
Dean Fischer, "Any time you get
somebody marching in the streets,
it's catering to revolution. . .My
family worked for everything. We
even had a deed from the king of
England for property in South
Carolina. Now these jerks come
along and try to give it to the
Communists. .
Commenting on life in
Washington, she said, "It's quite a
comedown in many ways. We're
not living on the same means we
had in Rye, N.Y. I think the
government should give us free
housing. We'll be happy to gc
back and make some money."
Foggy Bottom
Mrs. Mitchell in her TV
broadcasts and interviews has
given us an insight into a Cabinet
officer's life that we never had
before, and I can imagine what
happens when the Mitchells return
home in the evening to their posh
apartment at the Watergate in the
Foggy Bottom part of
Washington.
The attorney general enters
first and checks all the closets.
"There's none in here."
Mrs. Mitchell looks under the
bed. "There's none here."
They both look in the laundry
room. "There's none here," the
attorney general says.
"Oh, John"
Mrs. Mitchell sighs, "Oh, John,
can't you do something about the
liberals so we don't have to go
through this every night?"
I"- "I'm trying, Martha. I'm
working on a list of liberals to
exchange for Communists with
the Soviet Union. Once we get it
drawn up, we'll present it to
Russians at the SALT talks in
Helsinki."
"Good," Mrs. Mitchell replies.
"I'd rather have out and out
fcommunists in this country, than
people with Marxist ideas who
Won't admit their true colors."
"Well, let's go to bed, Martha."
"Suppose they march
tonight?" Mrs. Mitchell says.
"I don't think they will. The
Justice Department would have
let me know if they had any
plans. We should be able to get a
good night's sleep."
Wail for Bed, Martha
"How do we know they're not
in the lobby waiting for us to go
to bed?"
"Don't you remember? I
checked the lobby before I came
up. There isn't a liberal in the
entire Watergate complex."
"If they only gave us a free
house, we could electrify the
fence."

"Martha, you shouldn't fret."
Get Hack
"Why shouldn't I? This place is
costing us a pretty packet and it's
certainly a comedown from Rye,
N.Y. Why don't we go back and
make some money, John?"
"We will, Martha, but there is
important work to be done. Do
you know I managed to keep a
Marxist Belgian professor from
entering the United States last
week, over the objections of the
secretary of state?"
"I'm so proud of you, John.
Have you done anything yet
about the 55 senators who voted
against Judge Haynsworth?"
Liberal Commies
"I've got everyone at Justice

working on it now. We think we
may be able to prove a conspiracy
between the mobilization
organizers, the Eastern Liberal
Establishment, Joan Baez and the
senators who voted against
Haynsworth."
"That would be wonderful.
John, did you hear something in
the bathroom?"
"The water's running. Stay
back, Martha."
The attorney general goes into
the bathroom and comes out
whitefaced.
"It's John Kenneth Galbraith.
He's taking a shower!"
"I knew it," Martha cries. "I
told you we should have never
come to Washington."

"Why shouldn't I? This place is
costing us a pretty packet and it's
certainly a comedown from Rye,
N.Y. Why don't we go back and
make some money, John?"
"We will, Martha, but there is
important work to be done. Do
you know I managed to keep a
Marxist Belgian professor from

secretary of state?"
"I'm so proud of you, John.
Have you done anything yet
about the 55 senators who voted

"I've got everyone at Justice

working on it now. We think we
may be able to prove a conspiracy
between the mobilization
organizers, the Eastern Liberal
Establishment, Joan Baez and the
senators who voted against
Haynsworth."
"That would be wonderful.
John, did you hear something in
the bathroom?"
"The water's running. Stay
back, Martha."
The attorney general goes into
the bathroom and comes out
whitefaced.
"It's John Kenneth Galbraith.
He's taking a shower!"
"I knew it," Martha cries. "I
told you we should have never
come to Washington."
WASHINGTON — All of
Washington is talking about
Attorney General John Mitchell's
wife, Martha. Mrs. Mitchell has
made almost as big a splash as
Vice President Sprio Agnew, with
such remarks on TV as the one
that her husband would like to
trade some American liberals for
some Russian Communists.
She also told Time magazine's
Dean Fischer, "Any time you get
somebody marching in the streets,
it's catering to revolution. . .My
family worked for everything. We
even had a deed from the king of
England for property in South
Carolina. Now these jerks come
along and try to give it to the
Communists. .
Commenting on life in
Washington, she said, "It's quite a
comedown in many ways. We're
not living on the same means we
had in Rye, N.Y. I think the
government should give us free
housing. We'll be happy to gc
back and make some money."
Foggy Bottom
Mrs. Mitchell in her TV
broadcasts and interviews has
given us an insight into a Cabinet
officer's life that we never had
before, and I can imagine what
happens when the Mitchells return
home in the evening to their posh
apartment at the Watergate in the
Foggy Bottom part of
Washington.
The attorney general enters
first and checks all the closets.
"There's none in here."
Mrs. Mitchell looks under the
bed. "There's none here."
They both look in the laundry
room. "There's none here," the
attorney general says.
"Oh, John"
Mrs. Mitchell sighs, "Oh, John,
can't you do something about the
liberals so we don't have to go
through this every night?"
I"- "I'm trying, Martha. I'm
working on a list of liberals to
exchange for Communists with
the Soviet Union. Once we get it
drawn up, we'll present it to
Russians at the SALT talks in
Helsinki."
"Good," Mrs. Mitchell replies.
"I'd rather have out and out
fcommunists in this country, than
people with Marxist ideas who
Won't admit their true colors."
"Well, let's go to bed, Martha."
"Suppose they march
tonight?" Mrs. Mitchell says.
"I don't think they will. The
Justice Department would have
let me know if they had any
plans. We should be able to get a
good night's sleep."
Wail for Bed, Martha
"How do we know they're not
in the lobby waiting for us to go
to bed?"
"Don't you remember? I
checked the lobby before I came
up. There isn't a liberal in the
entire Watergate complex."
"If they only gave us a free
house, we could electrify the
fence."
