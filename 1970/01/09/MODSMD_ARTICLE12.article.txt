# Control Of Drugs
## After DDT What? 
### Joshua Lederberg 
In recommending the strict
regulation and gradual phasing-out
of DDT, Health, Education and
Welfare Secretary Robert H.
Finch has made a difficult, but I
believe correct, choice among
several options. Our environment
is already heavily contaminated
with DDT. Human exposure to it
will scarcely be affected by a
restricted level of continued use,
for a few years. Meanwhile, we
would seek formulas for rational
decisions about, say,
health-related applications, whose
benefits might outweigh the
measured risks. We should not
neglect standards for foodstuffs to
eliminate those which are so
heavily contaminated that they
add an unreasonable extra burden
to their consumers.
We might also ponder whether
to look for those people who have
the heaviest DDT loads and
investigate the benefits and risks
of medically supervised
treatments to wash out the
pesticide residues that now
average more an 10 PPM in human
fat tissue. These measures may be
more drastic than existing
evidence of harmful effects of
DDT to man would justify. It
would be preposterous to await
this level of proof before
controlling the use of the
pesticide.
The DDT and cyclamate
episodes should move us to hard
thinking about preventing similar
ones before they have gone so far.
In scheduling our priorities, we
probably should concentrate on
pollutants that are the most
widely spread, emanate from a
limited number of sources, and
tend to accumulate chronically
within the body. These criteria are
almost a definition of the lead
from auto exhausts — the mere
fact that lead is accumulating in
human bones is enough reason to
ban the use of lead additives in
gasoline BEFORE we discover the
full magnitude of its impact on
human health.
Responsibility For Safety
We also need new approaches
to the testing of environmental
additives, be they related to drugs,
food, pest control or fuel.
Existing procedures lay the full
responsibility (if any) on the
industrial sponsor of a product. A
government bureau then has the
unpleasant task of policing the
"proofs" of safety, which must be
done in a framework of rigid
bureaucratic regulations. The
evidence is also rarely accessible
to general scientific criticism. The
system is then heavily burdened
by pressures of self-interest, and
suspicions thereof, which repel
creative investigators. Only after a
product has been certified and
marketed is it likely to receive
aggressive, independent criticism.
This is unfair, even to the
manufacturer who has committed
his reputation to a product before
it can be properly tested, not to
mention the public interest.
Senator Gaylord Nelson has
proposed a big step in the right
direction in his bill for a national
drug testing center, an idea that

could readily be extended to
other additives. This would be
supervised by the FDA, but test
operations could be subcontracted
to other institutions. The costs
would be paid by the sponsors of
the drugs. This approach should
allow much greater flexibility on
the part of an independent testing
center for deciding on which tests
are most appropriate and
necessary.
In fact, the bill could be
improved by incorporating
incentive features, for example a
standardized fee related to
population exposure rather than
the cost of testing. And the
sponsor should get a rebate if his
product is found harmless; pay a
penalty if the testing center

discovers a hazard before the
sponsor does. We could then
exploit some of the inherent
advantages of free competition,
which are a drag on the present
system.
Incentive Usage
The cost of adequate testing is
inevitably a burden on innovation
and when it pushes a sponsor into
prematurely marketing a product,
it may do public harm. We ought
to think of tax incentives and
subsidies to the testing center as
positive remedies and penalties for
carelessness as negative ones.
Finally, we ought not give the
purveyors of products "generally
accepted as safe" an unfair
advantage when these have not
been fully tested either.

controlling the use of the
pesticide.
The DDT and cyclamate
episodes should move us to hard
thinking about preventing similar
ones before they have gone so far.
In scheduling our priorities, we
probably should concentrate on
pollutants that are the most
widely spread, emanate from a
limited number of sources, and
tend to accumulate chronically
within the body. These criteria are
almost a definition of the lead
from auto exhausts — the mere
fact that lead is accumulating in
human bones is enough reason to
ban the use of lead additives in
gasoline BEFORE we discover the
full magnitude of its impact on
human health.
Responsibility For Safety
We also need new approaches
to the testing of environmental
additives, be they related to drugs,
food, pest control or fuel.
Existing procedures lay the full
responsibility (if any) on the
industrial sponsor of a product. A
government bureau then has the
unpleasant task of policing the
"proofs" of safety, which must be
done in a framework of rigid
bureaucratic regulations. The
evidence is also rarely accessible
to general scientific criticism. The
system is then heavily burdened
by pressures of self-interest, and
suspicions thereof, which repel
creative investigators. Only after a
product has been certified and
marketed is it likely to receive
aggressive, independent criticism.
This is unfair, even to the
manufacturer who has committed
his reputation to a product before
it can be properly tested, not to
mention the public interest.
Senator Gaylord Nelson has
proposed a big step in the right
direction in his bill for a national
drug testing center, an idea that

could readily be extended to
other additives. This would be
supervised by the FDA, but test
operations could be subcontracted
to other institutions. The costs
would be paid by the sponsors of
the drugs. This approach should
allow much greater flexibility on
the part of an independent testing
center for deciding on which tests
are most appropriate and
necessary.
In fact, the bill could be
improved by incorporating
incentive features, for example a
standardized fee related to
population exposure rather than
the cost of testing. And the
sponsor should get a rebate if his
product is found harmless; pay a
penalty if the testing center

discovers a hazard before the
sponsor does. We could then
exploit some of the inherent
advantages of free competition,
which are a drag on the present
system.
Incentive Usage
The cost of adequate testing is
inevitably a burden on innovation
and when it pushes a sponsor into
prematurely marketing a product,
it may do public harm. We ought
to think of tax incentives and
subsidies to the testing center as
positive remedies and penalties for
carelessness as negative ones.
Finally, we ought not give the
purveyors of products "generally
accepted as safe" an unfair
advantage when these have not
been fully tested either.
In recommending the strict
regulation and gradual phasing-out
of DDT, Health, Education and
Welfare Secretary Robert H.
Finch has made a difficult, but I
believe correct, choice among
several options. Our environment
is already heavily contaminated
with DDT. Human exposure to it
will scarcely be affected by a
restricted level of continued use,
for a few years. Meanwhile, we
would seek formulas for rational
decisions about, say,
health-related applications, whose
benefits might outweigh the
measured risks. We should not
neglect standards for foodstuffs to
eliminate those which are so
heavily contaminated that they
add an unreasonable extra burden
to their consumers.
We might also ponder whether
to look for those people who have
the heaviest DDT loads and
investigate the benefits and risks
of medically supervised
treatments to wash out the
pesticide residues that now
average more an 10 PPM in human
fat tissue. These measures may be
more drastic than existing
evidence of harmful effects of
DDT to man would justify. It
would be preposterous to await
this level of proof before
controlling the use of the
pesticide.
