On January 7, 1970, the
Senate of the ASSU sent to
President Pitzer a list of
nominations of students to serve
on various committees of the
Stanford Board of Trustees.
Included on that list was the name
of Yale Braunstein. The President
had previously notified the Senate
that Mr. Braunstein was not
eligible to be appointed since he
had recently been convicted of a
violation of the Fundamental
Standard and was serving a period
of probation during which he was
specifically barred from serving
"on a University committee if
appointment requires approval of
the President or any other officer
of the University."
The sentence was imposed
under the strict terms of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter.
At his own request, Mr.
Braunstein's case was heard first
by the Dean of Students pursuant
to Section 11. I. of the Charter;
Mr. Braunstein then appealed this
decision under Section 11.1.2. to
an appellate committee of the
Stanford Judicial Council. The
latter committee unanimously
upheld that portion of the
sentence regarding service on
committees, stating that the
nature of the crime "fully justifies
the University administration's
refusal to appoint him to
positions of trust and
responsibility. The relation
between the crime and this aspect
of the penalty is direct and fully
justifiable." The appellate
committee recommended that the
President affirm this part of the
sentence, which he did.
The reason that the Student
Senate refused to remove the
name of Yale Braunstein from the
list of nominees was contained in

its resolution passed on January 7,
1 970. The resolution was
premised on the notion that the
constitution of the ASSU provides
that all members of the
Association shall be accorded
equal opportunity to apply for
student positions and hence the
President's action in refusing to
recognize Mr. Braunstein was in
violation of the spirit of that
constitution. This notion is
utterly false.
First, the ASSU Constiutuion
merely allows all students to
apply; it certainly does not
declare that any student is eligible
to serve. Second, and more
important, the ASSU Constitution
is subordinate to the Legislative
and Judicial Charter on all matters
of discipline, and it would fly in
the face of the working and spirit
of that Charter to permit the
ASSU Constitution to limit the
powers conferred on either the

SCLC or SJC with regard to
disciplinary problems including
what are appropriate penalties in a
disciplinary case.
The resolution of the student
senate directly contravenes the
will of those constituencies of the
University, including the student
body, which after much
discussion and preliminary
drafting and temporary approval,
formally adopted the Charter.
F- rthermore, Article IV, section 1
of the ASSU Constitution, itself,
formally recognizes the authority
of the University judicial bodies as
established by the Charter.
The contest here is thus not
between the Student Senate and
the University President, but
between the Student Senate and
all the constituencies of the
University which, under the
Legislative and Judicial Charter,
have formally entrusted the
disciplinary process to special
student-faculty tribunals.
If President Pitzer were now to
affirm Mr. Braunstein's
nomination, his act would directly
contravene the Charter. All of the
University's recent constitutional
history flatly contradicts the
Student Senate's notion that it,
and only it, can be a source of
power in the University regarding
any matter touching student
affairs.

nomination, his act would directly

power in the University regarding
any matter touching student

On January 7, 1970, the
Senate of the ASSU sent to
President Pitzer a list of
nominations of students to serve
on various committees of the
Stanford Board of Trustees.
Included on that list was the name
of Yale Braunstein. The President
had previously notified the Senate
that Mr. Braunstein was not
eligible to be appointed since he
had recently been convicted of a
violation of the Fundamental
Standard and was serving a period
of probation during which he was
specifically barred from serving
"on a University committee if
appointment requires approval of
the President or any other officer
of the University."
The sentence was imposed
under the strict terms of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter.
At his own request, Mr.
Braunstein's case was heard first
by the Dean of Students pursuant
to Section 11. I. of the Charter;
Mr. Braunstein then appealed this
decision under Section 11.1.2. to
an appellate committee of the
Stanford Judicial Council. The
latter committee unanimously
upheld that portion of the
sentence regarding service on
committees, stating that the
nature of the crime "fully justifies
the University administration's
refusal to appoint him to
positions of trust and
responsibility. The relation
between the crime and this aspect
of the penalty is direct and fully
justifiable." The appellate
committee recommended that the
President affirm this part of the
sentence, which he did.
The reason that the Student
Senate refused to remove the
name of Yale Braunstein from the
list of nominees was contained in

its resolution passed on January 7,
1 970. The resolution was
premised on the notion that the
constitution of the ASSU provides
that all members of the
Association shall be accorded
equal opportunity to apply for
student positions and hence the
President's action in refusing to
recognize Mr. Braunstein was in
violation of the spirit of that
constitution. This notion is
utterly false.
First, the ASSU Constiutuion
merely allows all students to
apply; it certainly does not
declare that any student is eligible
to serve. Second, and more
important, the ASSU Constitution
is subordinate to the Legislative
and Judicial Charter on all matters
of discipline, and it would fly in
the face of the working and spirit
of that Charter to permit the
ASSU Constitution to limit the
powers conferred on either the

SCLC or SJC with regard to
disciplinary problems including
what are appropriate penalties in a
disciplinary case.
The resolution of the student
senate directly contravenes the
will of those constituencies of the
University, including the student
body, which after much
discussion and preliminary
drafting and temporary approval,
formally adopted the Charter.
F- rthermore, Article IV, section 1
of the ASSU Constitution, itself,
formally recognizes the authority
of the University judicial bodies as
established by the Charter.
The contest here is thus not
between the Student Senate and
the University President, but
between the Student Senate and
all the constituencies of the
University which, under the
Legislative and Judicial Charter,
have formally entrusted the
disciplinary process to special
student-faculty tribunals.
If President Pitzer were now to
affirm Mr. Braunstein's
nomination, his act would directly
contravene the Charter. All of the

history flatly contradicts the
