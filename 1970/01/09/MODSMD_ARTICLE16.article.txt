# ASSU Forms Jobs Agency
## 
### RANDY ROTH 
/ Stanford student seeking
employment is a confused
individual. Where can he go? What
kind of job can he get? Other than
traditional jobs such as hashing, it
is difficult to locate any
employment. The Stanford
Placement Center is supposed to
provide this service, but
unfortunately its rapport with
both students and employers is
too weak, and thus it is incapable
of filling the need.
To solve this problem, the
ASSU is now setting up a clearing
house for all student jobs, except
those related to scholarships. This
new office, called the Student
Jobs Agency, will hold records of
each student with a skill or desire
to work, including typists,
musicians, laborers etc. Striving to
build a reputation in the job
market, the agency can be of help
to everyone in employers
or employees through its
channels. Operating within the
ASSU and run by students
themselves, it has the potential for

providing effective service and for
creating new job opportunities for
students.
Some work has already been
done. For instance, the
maintenance rates of the Stanford
Physical Plant are extremely high,
and investigations show that there
are many jobs, such as arranging
furniture, public address systems,
projectors etc., which the Physical
Plant cannot handle efficiently.
By having these jobs filled by
students, Physical Plant
employees will not be replaced,
but rather, freed to do more
involved maintenance work. In
addition, many paying jobs such
as ushering and student policing
are not easily filled, frequently
due to lack of knowledge about
their availability. These jobs will
be dispensed in the future through
this new placement service.
All employers and students
have been encouraged to support
this effort to simplify job-seeking
by utilizing the Student Jobs
Agency. The Agency is now open
in the ASSU Office, 1-3 p.m.
Monday thru Friday.
