# New Party Meets To Formulate Policy
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
A committee to research and
formulate a possible program of
political action for coming
months was formed last night at
the first meeting of the Peninsula
New Party.
Martin Carnoy, one of the
group's leaders, and a co-chairman
of the Stanford Moratorium
Committee, said "It is an
unfortunate fact of life that
despite 'reforms' such as the unit
rule abolition, it is likely that
Hubert Humphrey, or if he bows
out, Edmund Muskie, will be the
Democratic candidate for
president in 1972. There was a
fantastic effort for reform within
the party in 1968, which resulted
in no tangible changes."

Carnoy pointed out, to the
group of about 40 people, that a
"few people, working effectively,
can and have done much in the
way of political organizing."
The group, which has grown
out of work last year, and a
meeting last November in
Washington, is part of a
nationwide new party movement.
Possible issues the party will
consider, and formulate policy on,
include environmental problems,
inflation, population growth, and
the position of minorities in our
society.
The new party will work
toward establishing a solid
political base in the community,
hopefully providing a forum for
people disaffected from the
present two parties.
