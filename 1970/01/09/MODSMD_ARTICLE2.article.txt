# Student Center Plan Given Faculty Nod
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
The faculty Senate swiftly
cleared the way yesterday for
operation of the Student Center
for Innovation and Research in
Education.
After less than 45 minutes of
questioning and debate, the
Senate unanimously accepted the
Undergraduate Studies
Committee's report on the Center.
It will serve as a mechanism for
students to initiate courses and
directed reading programs, and a
means of coordinating students
and faculty with similar interests.
The Center will probably be fully
operational by Spring Quarter..
An 11 member subcommittee
of the Undergraduate Studies
Committee will function as board
of directors for the Center, with
power to award academic credit
for its courses. The board will
include six students, and a student
will be appointed manager of the
Center.
All decisions involving
academic credit will require a
two-thirds majority of the board,
including at least one student and
one faculty member. All work for
credit must be evaluated by
someone holding a regular or
temporary faculty appointment.
Following common practice,
the Undergraduate Studies
Committee can reverse decisions
of its subcommittee, the board.
However, planners hope the board
will be virtually autonomous.

The Senate partially hashed
out the matter on Dec. 18.
Yesterday members questioned
Undergraduate Studies Committee
chairman Mark Mancall and
Council of Presidents members
Joyce Kobayashi and Pat Shea
before accepting the proposal.
The proposal was developed
over the past nine months by Miss
Kobayashi and other members of
the Council of Presidents. They
worked closely with the
Undergraduate Studies Committee
and four University
Fe 11 ows â€”Ma nc a 11, Merrill
Carlsmith, Brad Efron, and
Robert Madix. The Fellows will
finance the Center for its first
year with $20,000 of their project
funds.
President Kenneth Pitzer
remarked that the proposal was
"very thoughtfully worked out."
Senate chairman William
Clebsch had predicted the plan
would be approved, perhaps with
minor changes. He remarked
"There is genuine enthusiasm
among faculty representatives for
student innovation in educations
at Stanford."
In other actions the Senate
Committee on Committees
announced that almost all faculty
positions on committees had been
filled. It was also reported that
the formal part of the SES study
has been completed, and reports
have now been submitted from all
areas.
