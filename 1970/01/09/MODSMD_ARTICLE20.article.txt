# Freshman Vacation
## Serves Time In Florida 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
While other Stanford men were
making time in the closing days of
their vacation freshman John
Cheronis was serving time.
John's ordeal began when the
Ft. Lauderdale police raided a
party he was attending in response
to a noise complaint last Saturday
night. Up6n entering the premises
the officers began to record the
names of the people present and
when they came to John they
decided to interrogate him.
Negative replies to questions
concerning whether he had been
drinking, smoking, shooting, or
popping didn't faze the officers,
one of whom said "Listen kid,
we've seen eyes like that before."
When he rose from where he had
been sitting to comply with the
officers' request that he walk a
straight line, the spot he was
sitting in was searched and after
he walked the line the police
turned him around and
handcuffed him.
Busted as a Drunk
John was informed he was
under arrest for public
intoxication. If his responses were
dulled or his eyes wild it was only
because he was still suffering the
tail end of a bad cold, so John
asked for a blood test or
breath-a-lizer examination to
prove he was not drunk.
This was denied him since in
Florida as in other states such
tests are granted only in cases of
drunk driving. In the case of a

"walking drunk," it is the officer's
word against that of the suspect.
Coincidentally, John was the
only man at the party with a
beard and shaggy hair. When he
arrived at the city jail, he found
his cellmates to be of similar
appearance. Most of them felt
they had been singled out from a
group of innocents because of
their hippy like appearance. This
could be a reflection of the police
tactic of attempting to separate
those they think are trouble
makers from the rest of a group.
Saturday Trial Sot
The six hour ordeal ended at

seven a.m. when bail was posted
and John was released. His mug
shots and finger prints are now
part of the Ft. Lauderdale City
Police Department's extensive file.
Trial has been set for this
Saturday but there are hopes it
will be postponed to spring
vacation.
John's reaction to the whole
incident was that "I couldn't
believe that it was happening. I
was not drunk and hadn't had a
thing to drink and since I know I
hadn't done anything to in any
way anger the police, 1 suspect my
appearance might have provoked
their arrest." When back home
again, the first thing to go was his
beard.
