# For What It's Worth
## Quicksilver Slipping 
### CRAIG OKINO 
Ah, how easy it is for a rock
group to fall into oblivion. Cream
went sour, so did Moby Grape and
Traffic, and Janis replaced Big
Brother and the Holding Co. with
more anemic musicians. All these
bands had excellent original
material in their early days, but
due to internal hassles found it
difficult to create songs of similar
quality as time went on.
Thus it was saddening last New
Year's Eve when it was announced
that the Quicksilver Messenger
Service, one of the best San
Francisco bands, would be no
more, rhythm quitarist Gary
Duncan leaving to form another
group with Dino Valenti,
folksinger and member of the
Quicksilver family.
But where the other bands left
with a whimper (especially
Cream's Goodbye, and Traffic's
Last Exit, and Moby Grape's
Truly Fine Citizen), Quicksilver's
supposed last album, Happy
Trails, was the best rock'n'roll
recording out of San Francisco.
(Live Dead and Pointed Head
included). It demonstrated the
power of Quicksilver in person,
the interaction and creativity of
the two guitarists, Duncan and
Cipollina, the driving rhythm of
Elmore, and the shouting vocals
of Freiburg and Duncan.
Good news reached the many
Quicksilver fans during the
summer when it was learned that
Nicky Hopkins, the session pianist
who has played with every
possible group (including the
Stones, Jeff Beck and the
Airplane) had permanently
become a member of the
Messenger Service, joining the
remaining members, and the first
album with the new lineup was
eagerly awaited.
Shady Grove (Capitol
SKAO-391), the first major album
released in 1970, is the product of
the new Quicksilver. It begins
with the title tune, a frilly intro
by Hopkins leading into the
infamous driving Bo Diddley
guitar riff used on "Who Do You
Love," with Freiburg's excellent
vocal in the foreground ("I used
to walk the city streets/Now I
wander far and wide/And I never
found my happiness 'till/I moved

to the countryside. . .out in Shady
Grove").
Unfortunately, it's the only
song of any merit on the album,
the rest of it barely being worth
the plastic it's made from (with
the exception of "Joseph's Coat"
on side 21. The remainder of the
tunes are characterized by
whining vocals and a shitty mixing
job which buries Cipollina's guitar
in the background and muddies
Hopkins' piano.
Why such a poor showing from
a formerly fine group? One factor
is the seeming inability to fit
Hopkins' piano into what was
previously an all-guitar context.
The result is aimless doodling and
the absence of any decent guitar
breaks by Cipollina.
Also, Quicksilver's previous
formula was to transform old folk
songs, such as "Dino's Song",
Codeine," "Babe I'm Gonna
Leave You", and "Pride of Man",
into a rock'n'roll format, and they
did this well. They did not write
very much original material, and
what they did have was penned
mostly by Duncan. On Shady
Grove, Friedburg and Cipollina,
although aided by Nick
Gravenites, show they aren't
brilliant in the songwriting
department.
Maybe Gary Duncan and Dino
Valenti will have better luck with
their group, the Outlaws.
Meanwhile, cross another name
off an ever-decreasing list of
outstanding rock bands. But
Quicksilver is always full of
surprises, so I'd advise you to use
a pencil instead of a pen.
