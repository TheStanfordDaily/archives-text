# The 						Dead Letter
## He Feels A Draft 
### NEIL ARNET 
Don't mind the typing, the
stationery, or the sense of what
I'm writing. Basically I need to
think some things out and I
thought it would help to write out
my thoughts.
The draft is giving me fits. My
draft board is difficult; it doesn:t
grant deferments or hardly
anything and C.O.'s are certainly
hard to come by. Essentially the
problem is what I am going to do
with my life and can I do what I
want to do; this certainly should
ring true to you and other senior
men.
Reality is that I may never
know what I truly want to do, so
I better choose something rather
than do nothing at all (which is
what I have been doing).
Realization is that the draft
actually shouldn't change any of
my plans, but that it does.
Sunday I heard Kingman
Brewster of Yale (on Meet the
Press) stating that he felt one of
the basic problems of education
was the extrinsic situations
forcing young people into

attending school from ages 6 to
25. Brewster felt that obviously
some people should have their
education broken up (for
example, by working or traveling),
and some perhaps shouldn't be in
school at all. What he was trying
to explain was a system of
education for education's
sake —not for mother or father or
money or status or draft evasion.
At the moment I know I'm in
need of a break from school, but
the draft good-guys wouldn't
understand. I'm in the process of
trying to attain a C.0., but I really
don't know if I'll get it.
All of a sudden my education
has really lost direction. Here I am
a psychology major, and yet I
can't continue on into graduate
school. Same thing goes for
Classics if I were to obtain a
second major. The draft would
grab me first or interrupt me after
a year.
Well, kid, I have a class to
attend. Just wanted to share some
frustration and futility with you.
Please write.
Peace—as ever,
Neil
