Studied With Segovia
A native of California,
Parkening began studying the
guitar at the age of eleven with
the celebrated classical guitarists
Celedonio and Pepe Romero. In
1964 Parkening received a full
scholarship to the first Master

Class of Andres Segovia given in
America, and was invited by
Segovia to join the Jury of the
International Guitar Competition
of Spain.
In March, 1963 Parkening
made his professional debut at the
age of fourteen at UCLA's Royce
Hall. Since then he has been a
guest soloist with more than
twenty orchestras in California
and all the major symphonies in
the Los Angeles area. His New
York debut will be this April with
the Little Orchestra Society in
Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall.
Records Acclaimed
Both a full scholarship student
at USC and a teaching lecturer on
the guitar on the School of Music
Faculty, Parkening also records
for Capitol and Angel Records.
His first two records
demonstrate, as stated in the New
York Times, "the kind of
impeccable musicianship that only
greatly talented people achieve at
any age . . .his musical grasp of
broad ideas is as impressive as his
utter technical security and
control in shading, colors and
dynamics."

Parkening's concert can be
