# SF Symphony, Choir In Outstanding Missa
## 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Every year, Harold Schmidt,
Stanford Choral Director,
surrenders his podium to Josef
Krips, conductor of the San
Francisco Symphony. Last year,
the Stanford group gave a fine
performance of Verdi's Requiem;
Wednesday evening, an even
better performance of
Beethoven's Missa Solemnis was
presented. The Symphony, Choir
and Chorus accompanied soloists
Wilma Lipp, Janet Baker, Richard
Lewis and Richard Cross in this
extremely difficult piece, the Masr.
in D Major.
The orchestra played better
than they yet have this season,
and the Choir, despite the
protestations of Mr. Schmidt that
"we should have done better,"
was superb.

I was somewhat disappointed
with the soloists. The relatively
thin voice of the bass, Mr. Cross
marred the Agnus Dei, the final
section of the piece, while the
soprano, Miss Lipp, continually
had problems in intonation,
especially in the duet sections
with the fine contralto, Miss
Baker. Mr. Lewis sang a clear,
strong tenor, and although his
part was not large, I felt he gave
the best solo performance. When
singing as a quartet, the soloists
blended, only lacking strength in
the bass line.
Choir Enthusiastic
The Choir attacked the piece
enthusiastically, but not maturely,
in the Kyrie and the Gloria. The
basses, especially, revealed their
youth in these sections, but
improved in the Credo; the Choir

finished the piece like an
experienced group.
The orchestra has overcome
some of the insecurity that has
plaugued it recently, and played
with the Choir, not against it, not
overpowering the soloists. Friends
of the Cjjoir felt that Maestro
Krips kept the singers too far in
the background, but this was not
really the case. Beethoven's
composition, written at the same
time as the Choral Symphony the
Ninth, represents an attempt to
expand the concert musicians into
an orchestra incorporating singers,
not an instrumental ensemble
sitting before a vocal ensemble.
In the Missa, the solos are not
restricted to the vocal quartet.
The Sanctus begins with a brass
choir, and I was much relieved to
hear the horns playing sensitively.
In the past, the horns have been
the weakest section of the
Symphony, but except for some
faults in the Amen of the Gloria,
they were considerably improved.
Sanctus Exceptional
The best section of the Missa
was the Sanctus, without
question. Besides the brass choir,
it contained rich, tender soli
passages for viola and then violin,
and a superb solo by
Concertmaster Jacob
Krachmainick.
The San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra and the Stanford
Chorus and Choir return to the
Opera House tonight for the final
performance of Beethoven's Missa
Solemnis at 8:30 PM. Tickets will
be available at the Box Office.
Two excellent productions of
the Missa Solemnis are available
on Angel Records. Both feature
the New Philharmonia Orchestra,
one with von Karajan and
Schwarzkopf, the other with
Klemperer and Soderstrom.

with the fine contralto, Miss
Baker. Mr. Lewis sang a clear,
strong tenor, and although his
part was not large, I felt he gave
the best solo performance. When
singing as a quartet, the soloists
blended, only lacking strength in
the bass line.
Choir Enthusiastic
The Choir attacked the piece
enthusiastically, but not maturely,
in the Kyrie and the Gloria. The
basses, especially, revealed their
youth in these sections, but
improved in the Credo; the Choir

finished the piece like an
experienced group.
The orchestra has overcome
some of the insecurity that has
plaugued it recently, and played
with the Choir, not against it, not
overpowering the soloists. Friends
of the Cjjoir felt that Maestro
Krips kept the singers too far in
the background, but this was not
really the case. Beethoven's
composition, written at the same
time as the Choral Symphony the
Ninth, represents an attempt to
expand the concert musicians into
an orchestra incorporating singers,
not an instrumental ensemble
sitting before a vocal ensemble.
In the Missa, the solos are not
restricted to the vocal quartet.
The Sanctus begins with a brass
choir, and I was much relieved to
hear the horns playing sensitively.
In the past, the horns have been
the weakest section of the
Symphony, but except for some
faults in the Amen of the Gloria,
they were considerably improved.
Sanctus Exceptional
The best section of the Missa
was the Sanctus, without
question. Besides the brass choir,
it contained rich, tender soli
passages for viola and then violin,
and a superb solo by
Concertmaster Jacob
Krachmainick.
The San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra and the Stanford
Chorus and Choir return to the
Opera House tonight for the final
performance of Beethoven's Missa
Solemnis at 8:30 PM. Tickets will
be available at the Box Office.
Two excellent productions of
the Missa Solemnis are available
on Angel Records. Both feature
the New Philharmonia Orchestra,
one with von Karajan and
Schwarzkopf, the other with
Klemperer and Soderstrom.
Every year, Harold Schmidt,
Stanford Choral Director,
surrenders his podium to Josef
Krips, conductor of the San
Francisco Symphony. Last year,
the Stanford group gave a fine
performance of Verdi's Requiem;
Wednesday evening, an even
better performance of
Beethoven's Missa Solemnis was
presented. The Symphony, Choir
and Chorus accompanied soloists
Wilma Lipp, Janet Baker, Richard
Lewis and Richard Cross in this
extremely difficult piece, the Masr.
in D Major.
The orchestra played better
than they yet have this season,
and the Choir, despite the
protestations of Mr. Schmidt that
"we should have done better,"
was superb.

I was somewhat disappointed
with the soloists. The relatively
thin voice of the bass, Mr. Cross
marred the Agnus Dei, the final
section of the piece, while the
soprano, Miss Lipp, continually
had problems in intonation,
especially in the duet sections
with the fine contralto, Miss
Baker. Mr. Lewis sang a clear,
strong tenor, and although his
part was not large, I felt he gave
the best solo performance. When
