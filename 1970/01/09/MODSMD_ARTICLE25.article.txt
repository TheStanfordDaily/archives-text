# Sequoia Hits Mark

### TOM GIVEN 
One is usually hesitant about reviewing a literary magazine, and
with reason. A sampling of fourth-grade English books demonstrates
that the geniuses of the past were never truly appreciated, and as the
saying goes, to become famous one must usually be dead.
In light of this, the safe course is to praise the potential of a writer
while denying his present genius. This is the case to be made for the
Winter Quarter Sequoia, Stanford's quarterly contribution to truth
and beauty.
The reasons for this are simply; true genius is so impossible to
define that this critic, like many of his predecessors, chooses to cop
out rather than face an angry mob. Suffice it to say that the magazine
is highly entertaining, and that its stories, poems, and photos can
make sense even to non-English majors.
Absent are the l pseudo-profound works of prose that so many of us
mistake for fiction, Both short stories—by Robert Kirschner and Kim
very well done. Kirschner's work, "Make it Better",
was an excellent portrayal of night and day people, coexisting in a
single city. It is without question the highpoint of the magazine.
This is not to deny other talent in the Sequoia. The volume,
besides its contents, is praise worthy, with photography that captures
many of the written moods within. Both David Levinthal, who
produced the cover and most of the photos, and Bruce Byers deserve
much credit for their work.
The poetry is of a consistently good quality, and is well worth
reading—even for diehard poetry-haters. Most notable are "Break of
Day" by Jack Anderson and "Hitchhiking" by Phillip Spiegel.
The Sequoia is published quarterly, by the ASSU. Subscriptions are
$2.75 a year. Individual copies are $.75 each.
