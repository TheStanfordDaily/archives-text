# Bruins Host Gymnastic Opener
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Stanford gymnasts probably
won't win their first outing of the
new season when they meet
UCLA tonight in Los Angeles.
Right now that isn't their primary
concern.
In the first place, according to
Coach Dan Millman, "The
Pacific-8 is by far the toughest
conference in the country in
gymnastics." Cal and the
University of Washington are
national champion calibre and
USC and UCLA are only a notch
behind. The Indians, Millman
predicts, will probably be fifth.
But in the second place, points
and victories and winners are
gradually being de-emphasized in
competitive gymnastics.
"We like to win," the
second-year coach says, "but
winning is a side effect and not a
goal. The whole goal is to put on
an aesthetic performance purely
on perfect body control."
Local sports fans, to whom
such a statement might seem a
little far out, can get their first
look at the 1970 gymnasts Jan. 17
at 7:30 p.m. in Gncina Pavilion
when the Indians host Sacramento
State.
But the first obstacle is tonight
in Los Angeles where Millman and
eight gymnasts open the season.
Competition is divided into six

categories, and each participant is
judged on his execution of
fundamental-to-difficult moves he
must perform. Everybody starts
with 10 points; if he finishes with
eight he's doing well and a 9.2-9.7
would put him with the best in
the nation.
The scores of the best three of
four performers from the same
squad in each category are added
together to determine the team
score.
Stanford will be operating with
a "young but very talented team"
according to Millman. Of the eight
men on the traveling squad, four
are freshme.i, one is a sophomore,
two are juniors and one is a
senior.
Leading the Tribe this year is
Steve Rochell, a junior from
Illinois who last year placed 11th
in NCAA competition on the
rings. He gets strong support from
three California freshmen, Rich
Jerome, Chris Harrold and Murray
Kephart.
Harold and Jerome, both from
Sacramento, appear to be the top
two all-around performers.
Kephart, a Los Angeles product,
won the LA city championship
last year on the high bar.
Others making the trip include
Brian Morgan, sophomore, who
competes in all events; Ted
Miyamoto, a freshman back-up


all-around performer; Dennis
Mesick, a senior specialist on the
side horse; and Bob Tomlinson, a
junior who also concentrates on
the side horse.

fundamental-to-difficult moves he
must perform. Everybody starts
with 10 points; if he finishes with
eight he's doing well and a 9.2-9.7
would put him with the best in
the nation.
The scores of the best three of
four performers from the same
squad in each category are added
together to determine the team
score.
Stanford will be operating with
a "young but very talented team"
according to Millman. Of the eight
men on the traveling squad, four
are freshme.i, one is a sophomore,
two are juniors and one is a
senior.
Leading the Tribe this year is
Steve Rochell, a junior from
Illinois who last year placed 11th
in NCAA competition on the
rings. He gets strong support from
three California freshmen, Rich
Jerome, Chris Harrold and Murray
Kephart.
Harold and Jerome, both from
Sacramento, appear to be the top
two all-around performers.
Kephart, a Los Angeles product,
won the LA city championship
last year on the high bar.
Others making the trip include
Brian Morgan, sophomore, who
competes in all events; Ted
Miyamoto, a freshman back-up


all-around performer; Dennis
Mesick, a senior specialist on the
side horse; and Bob Tomlinson, a
junior who also concentrates on
the side horse.


IN THE AlR — Steve Rochell on the
rings, above, and Murray Kephart on
the high bar, right, work through their
gymnastic tricks in renovated Encina
Pavilion in preparation for tonight's
season-opening competition against
UCLA in Los Angeles. The Tribe
performers will host many of the best
collegiate teams in the nation during
their four-date home schedule which
begins January 17.
Stanford gymnasts probably
won't win their first outing of the
new season when they meet
UCLA tonight in Los Angeles.
Right now that isn't their primary
concern.
In the first place, according to
Coach Dan Millman, "The
Pacific-8 is by far the toughest
conference in the country in
gymnastics." Cal and the
University of Washington are
national champion calibre and
USC and UCLA are only a notch
behind. The Indians, Millman
predicts, will probably be fifth.
But in the second place, points
and victories and winners are
gradually being de-emphasized in
competitive gymnastics.
"We like to win," the
second-year coach says, "but
winning is a side effect and not a
goal. The whole goal is to put on
an aesthetic performance purely
on perfect body control."
Local sports fans, to whom
such a statement might seem a
little far out, can get their first
look at the 1970 gymnasts Jan. 17
at 7:30 p.m. in Gncina Pavilion
when the Indians host Sacramento
State.
But the first obstacle is tonight
in Los Angeles where Millman and
eight gymnasts open the season.
Competition is divided into six

categories, and each participant is
judged on his execution of
fundamental-to-difficult moves he
must perform. Everybody starts
with 10 points; if he finishes with
eight he's doing well and a 9.2-9.7
would put him with the best in
the nation.
