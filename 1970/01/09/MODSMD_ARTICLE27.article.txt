# Cagers Open Pac-8 Play In Northwest
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's varsity basketball
team travels to Washington and
Washington State this weekend to
open what promises to be a long
and difficult Pac-8 season. The
Indians carry a 2-7 record to the
Northwest while both Washington
and WSU have 9-2 preseason
records. Furthermore, the Cards
will have to do without the
services of 6-10 center Larry
Rosenzweig, who is sidelined for
the season with a knee injury.
Stanford's probable starting
lineup for Saturday night's game
against Washington and Monday
night's game against WSU will
consist of guards Dennis O'Neill
(6-3) and Calude Terry (6-5);
forwards Fred Green (6;4) and
Chuck Moore (6-4) and center Bill
Palmer (6-7).
Red Guard
O'Neill and Terry give Stanford
possibly the finest guard
combination on the coast. They
are averaging 18.8 and 16.0 points
respectively and both are shooting
around the 50% mark. Green has
played agressively, especially on
defense, and if Moore can shake
off his injury problems, the Tribe
will be able to count on a couple
of solid performers at the corner
spots. Palmer is naturally
handicapped by his lack of size,
but fortunately the Pac-8 centers
are a bit smaller this year than
last.
Saturday night the Cards will
face a strong Washington team
which will have a veteran starting
five, despite a couple of costly
injuries. Missing from the Huskie's
lineup will be outstanding
sophomore center Steve Hawes
and veteran guard Rafael Stone.
Both Hawes and Stone are out for
up to six weeks with hairline
fractures of the shin bone and
their loss will definitely hurt the
Huskies.
Replacing Hawes in the
starting lineup will be veteran 6-9
pivotman Jay Bond. Bond was
honorable mention all-conference
last year, and he gave the Indians

fits in Washington's two victories
over Stanford last year. Flanking
Bond on the front line will be Pat
Woolcock (6-5) and George Irvine
(6-s'/2). Irvine has been carrying
the offensive burden for the
Huskies with an average of over
22 points per game. He has hit on
a fantastic 64.4% of his shots to
rank sixth in the nation in that
category.
Washington, ranked 14th in
this week's AP poll, will be hurt
by the loss of Stone and Hawes,
but they will still be heavy
favorites over the Indians.
WSU Ranked 1 9th
Washington State, ranked 19th
in this week's UPI poll, will also
give the Cards a severe test. The
Cougars are let by a pair of
forwards, Gary Elliot (6-6) and
Jin Meredity (6-7). Through
eleven games Elliot leads the team
both in scoring and rebounding.
He is averaging 16.4 points 10
rebounds per game. Meredith is
close behind with 15.6 and 7.7
rebounds per game.
The Cougar guards are Dennis
Hogg (6-5) and Rick Erickson
(6-0) Hogg is a good shooter and a
fine rebounder. The converted
forward is averaging 13.5 points
and 6.8 rebounds per game. The
veteran Erickson is also averaging
in double figures, at a 10.8 clip.


CO-CAPTAIN: Terry Crenshaw (above), 177 lbs., leads Stanford's wrestlers into
their 1970 season Uiis afternoon along with 167 lb. Bill Ross. The grovelling
Indian grapplers greet the new year with a grueling grind of weekend
groundbreakers.
