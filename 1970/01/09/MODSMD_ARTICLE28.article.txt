Eight exciting IM activities are
being offered this quarter. Next
Monday leagues start in basketball
and soccer, with the basketball
games being played in Maples on
the newly-lined side courts. Also
on Monday single elimination
tournaments start in table tennis
and a new sport, badminton.
There will be one-night
tournaments later in the quarter
for wrestling (February 10 and
12), weight lifting (February 23),
and boxing (March 3 and 5). Also,
bowling is being continued from
last quarter.

Rounding out the starting five
is center Jack Bergersen (6-9) a
transfer from Shoreline
Community College, Bergersen
has filled in nicely for the
graduated ted Wierman and is
averaging 8.9 points.
WSU did not play an extremely
tough non-conference schedule,
but they have still looked fairly
impressive. The Indians have
always had a tough time playing
in Pullman and Monday night's
game promises to be another
tough contest.
Both the Washington and WSU
game will be aired on KSFO TV,
Channel 44. Air time for both
games will be 8:00 P.M.
