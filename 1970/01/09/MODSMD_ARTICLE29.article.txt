# Frosh Face Alums, JV
## 
### 
After a month's layoff,
Stanford's freshman basketball
team returns to action tomorrow
night against a combined
Alumni-JV team. The Alumni
team will feature former center
Tom Dose who holds the four
year individual scoring record at
Stanford with 1,596 points from
1961-1964.
The freshmen have a 2-1 record
with victories over Santa Clara
(76-60) and USF (92-77), after an
opening loss to San Jose State
(72-75). Leading scorer for the
Indians is John Stratton, a 6-2
guard who is averaging 20.3 who
is hitting at an 18.3 clip. Also
impressive in the last outing
against USF was 6-4 forward Bob
Buell from San Jose, who is
recovering from a knee operation.
Rounding out the starting five
will probably be Mark Hanson
(6-4) and center Pat Stevens (6-4).
Following the Alumni game, the
freshmen will return to action
next Friday against the Cal Frosh.
Tipoff for tomorrow night's game
in Maples Pavilion is 6:00 P.M.
