## Mid-East Hijack 
### 
BEIRUT, Labanon (AP>-A
bespectacled French-speaking
European with a gun hijacked a
Trans World Airlines jet with 20
persons aboard between Paris and
Rome early Friday and forced the
pilot to fly to Beirut.
Shortly after the big Boeing
707 landed in the Lebanese
capital, the hijacker fired several
bullets into the plane's instrument
panel, but nobody was hurt.
The other 19 persons aboard
took off their shoes and slid out
of the plane's emergency exit
chutes. The hijacker followed
them down, and Lebanese
security men grabbed him as he
hit the ground. They slapped him
several times and disarmed him as
he protested in French.
"He was dark-haired and wore
spectacles," said the engineer on
the flight, Earl Lima.
"He traveled in tourist class
with a French passport and spoke
French. He did not appear to be
an Arab."
Another airline official
tentatively identified the hijacker
as Christian Bellon, a Frenchman.
He was taken to the terminal
building for interrogation by
security men, and newsmen could
not learn immediately the motive
for the hijacking.
The plane was TWA's flight
802 from New York to Rome. It
left Paris with only three
passengers from New York, all
Americans; six passengers who
boarded in Paris, including three
TWA employees; the eight
members of the flight crew, and
three other TWA flight personnel
being transferred to Rome. Most
of the passengers from New York
got off in Paris.
