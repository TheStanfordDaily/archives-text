# Outlook Bright For Rugby
## 
### 
Rugby fans are in for a bonus
weekend, as four games are slated
for this Saturday afternoon when
Stanford's ruggers open their
season by hosting the Peninsula
Ramblers.
Coach Pete Kmetovic is
optimistic regarding his club's
prospects for the year. "We've got
perhaps the best set of backs that
I've ever had the opportunity to
coach here at Stanford,"
commented Kmetovic. "We may
have to gut it out for awhile until
we get better organized, but it
looks real good."
Joining Jack Shultz, Jim
Kauffman, Kip Oxman, Jin
Squeri, Jack Lasater, Chuck
Williams, and Don Bunce in the
backfield is former British
International player, Stewart
Wilson, who "runs, passes, and
kicks extremely well and tackles
like a fiend," according to one of
his teammates.
Veteran scrum men include
Captain, Joe Neal, Bill Buckland,
Pat Preston, Leon Hartvickson,
Wade Killefer, Pete Crosby, and
Jack Alustriza, Ron Kadziel, Bill
Alexander, Jerry Dover and Bill
McDonald.

The Ramblers are an old time
Club team that comes to Stanford
boasting a 5-0 won-loss record.
Their great degree of experience is
expected to play a big factor in
the outcome of Saturday's match.
The Stanford Varsity will meet
the Ramblers' number one team
at 1:30 while at 3:00 the second
teams of each club will play. Also
at 3:00, the Tribe's third unit will
take on the University Club, and

the Red and White fourth squad
will meet the Rambler's third
tema.
Stanford will be playing a 14
game schedule including the four
game Monterey Tournament to be
held late in the season. Their
biggest games are expected to be
with the BATS Rugby Club,
UCLA, University of British
Columbia, and of course, Cal.
