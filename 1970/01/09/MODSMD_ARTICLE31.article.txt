# Tripleheader
## Wrestling Openers 
### FRED MANN 
For the first time in a long
time, the Stanford wrestling team
will be strong contenders for
league and national honors.
Coach Dave Reed's Indians will
get their first tests today, tonight,
and tomorrow in the Old Pavilion
as the season opens against three
different opponents.
At 4:30 p.m., Stanford takes
on Cal State at Fullerton, and
then enjoys a few hours rest
before meeting San Diego State
tonight at 7:30 p.m. If wrestlers
are still walking after their
day-night doubleheader, they will
face another tough assignment
against UCLA tomorrow night at
7:30 p.m.
It is quite a schedule for any
team at any time. But for the
Stanford wrestling team, it will be
more than just three meets in two
days— it may well indicate how
the entire season will go.

In many respects, the Indians
are an unknown quantity. Led by
senior Terry Crenshaw, the fourth
place finisher in the NCAA finals
two years ago, the Tribe will
definitely have a shot at the
Pacific-8 crown this year, but the
road will be extremely difficult.
The UCLA meet is a big one in
that the Bruins are league
opponents. They have been
beaten this year by Fresno State,
but still must rank as favorites
over the Tribe. However, an upset
is a large possibility, and Coach
Reed feels his squad is ready for
the acid test.
Aside from Crenshaw at 177
lbs., Stanford will be led by
co-captain Bill Ross (167 lbs.),
David Kopolow (118 lbs.), Dave
Thomas (142 lbs.), Len Smith
(150 lbs.), and Arthur Smiley
(heavyweight).
