# Prof Predicts Life In 1970's
## 
### 
The college students of the
'70's will be just as unswervingly
idealistic and grimly determined
to right today's wrongs as they
were in the decade just closed,
Prof. John D. Black, director of
Stanford's Counseling and Testing
Center, told the San Francisco
Advertising Club here Wednesday
noon.
And if they ever give up the
idea that they can influence the
political processes for the
betterment of mankind, "America
is really in for trouble," he told
the businessmen.
He offered some realistic
predictions for the club's
consideration:
"The public relations problems
of the large corporation,
particularly those selling to the
general public, will be much more
sensitive and complex.

"The company image will
become more important, but this
image will not depend simply on
the quality of its products or
services or whether its prices are
lower, but on a whole complex of
other factors as well â€”such as its
treatment of employees, its vigor
in minority hiring and promotion,
its freedom from exploitation of
undeveloped countries, its efforts
to conserve natural resources and
prevent polution, its own ethical
standards and its commitment to
solving social problems.
"The next decade will see
consumers joining employees in
demands for proper wage scales
and working conditions," he
predicted. "The grape boycott is
an omen of the future . . .It will
be much easier to boycott GE,
Ford Motor Co. or Pan American
than it is a product as anonymous
as grapes."
