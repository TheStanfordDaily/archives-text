EDGARTOWN, Mass.
(AP)â€”The inquest into the death
of Mary Jo Kopechne ended
Thursday and the presiding judge
said he would review the
testimony and write his report as
speedily as possible.
Judge James A. Boyle said,
however, he would not hurry the

process at the expense of making
a careful judgment. He said he did
not know how long it would take
him to make his recommendations
to the Superior Court on whether
Miss Kopechne's death was the
result of any criminal act.
Miss Kopechne, 28, a
Washington, D.C. secretary, died
last July 18 when Se. Edward M.
Kennedy's car toppled into a tidal
pool from Dike Bridge on nearby
Chappaquiddick Island.
Shortly before 2 p.m.,
Thursday, Dist. Atty. Edmund S.
Dinis, who sought the inquest,
emerged from the red brick
courthouse on Martha's Vineyard
and told newsmen: "The hearing
part of the inquest is over. There
will be no further testimony."
The inquest opened Monday.
The proceeding now is entirely
in the hands of Boyle, 63, who
must decide whether to
recommend criminal prosecution
in the case.
He has an unspecified amount
of time to study the inquest
transcript.
