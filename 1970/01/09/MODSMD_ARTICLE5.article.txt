SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP)—The nation's next two
launches toward moon landings
have been posponed, indicating a
general rescheduling of manned
space flights to increase their
scientific value.
The space agency announced
Thursday that Apollo 13, man's
third moon landing flight, will be
launched April 11 instead of
March 12, and Apollo 14 has been
put off until the fall, instead of
July 11.

Scientists greeted the news
with delight. Many have bitterly
criticized the space agency for
scheduling moon landings close
together, saying four-month
intervals did not leave enough
"time for studying the results of
one flight before launching
another. jrf
The original schedule had
called for launching Apollo 15 in
November, but no announcement
was made about it.
Officials had said earlier this
week they were considering
stretching out the moon
exploration program, making
flights six months apart
A schedule under
consideration, an official said
then, includes two flights this
year, two in 1971, none in 1972,
two in 1973 and one in 1974.
