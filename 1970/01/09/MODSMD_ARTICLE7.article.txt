# Noisy Contingent Present
## Chicanos Voted Huge Budget 
### 
As a vocal contingent of 40
MECHA mpmbers applauded, the
student Senate last night
appropriated $10,184.50 for the
Chicano organization—but not
until it had rejected a budget that
was 50 cents higher.
A series of inconclusive ballots
were taken. The sum finally
approved was the second
compromise budget submitted by
the organization.
Carl Vasquez, the MECHA
spokesman, presented an original
budget of $12,245.00 saying that
"students know very little of us
Chicanos. We want to use this
money to educate them."
"This amount may seem
exorbitant," he said. "But it's
been a long time coming."
After this budget was rejected,
Vasquez offered another, saying:
" We presented this budget in good
fa. th; we did not tome here to
pliiy games. So we offer a
compromise budget: $10,185.
The MECHA contingent broke

into cheering and clapping. When
they quieted, Senate Chairman
Dave Edwards opened the
question to floor debate. Yale
Braunstein's speech in favor of the
compromise was heavily
applauded by the Chicanos, as
were statements by Leo Bazile
and Peter Carpenter. However,
when a move was made to accept
the compromise sum, the vote
rejected it.
After a series of inconclusive
ballots, Edwards called a
ten-minute recess. After the
break, Vasquez made another
appeal to the Senate. He
presented a second compromise
sum, $10,184.50, in order to
re-admit the proposal to the floor.
The Senate passed this resolution,
17-8, and the Chicanos broke into
applause.
Presence Felt
The Chicano presence was
heavily felt throughout the
meeting. Edwards requested that
all Senators sit at the front of the

room so that there would be seats
for the contingent.
The group sat silently at the
back of the room as Dean of
Students Peter J. Bulkeley
explained the University
budgetary situation to the Senate.
Bulkeley said that, in the
absence of an effective Senate and
Constitution last spring, an
interim mechanism was needed to
organize the ASSU budget. He
was therefore appointed by the
administration to draw up, in
consultation with other
organizations, a tentative budget.
The tentative budget allocated
money to organizations that
needed it immediately, such as the
Pre-Reg committee, and also
assigned tentative amounts to
other organizations. His budget
called for a $4,875.00
Contribution to MECHA.
Bulkeley's comments were met by
silence from the MECHA
students.

silence from the MECHA
students.
As a vocal contingent of 40
MECHA mpmbers applauded, the
student Senate last night
appropriated $10,184.50 for the
Chicano organization—but not
until it had rejected a budget that
was 50 cents higher.
A series of inconclusive ballots
were taken. The sum finally
approved was the second
compromise budget submitted by
the organization.
Carl Vasquez, the MECHA
spokesman, presented an original
budget of $12,245.00 saying that
"students know very little of us
Chicanos. We want to use this
money to educate them."
"This amount may seem
exorbitant," he said. "But it's
been a long time coming."
After this budget was rejected,
Vasquez offered another, saying:
" We presented this budget in good
fa. th; we did not tome here to
pliiy games. So we offer a
compromise budget: $10,185.
The MECHA contingent broke

into cheering and clapping. When
they quieted, Senate Chairman
Dave Edwards opened the
question to floor debate. Yale
Braunstein's speech in favor of the
compromise was heavily
applauded by the Chicanos, as
were statements by Leo Bazile
and Peter Carpenter. However,
when a move was made to accept
the compromise sum, the vote
rejected it.
After a series of inconclusive
ballots, Edwards called a
ten-minute recess. After the
break, Vasquez made another
appeal to the Senate. He
presented a second compromise
sum, $10,184.50, in order to
re-admit the proposal to the floor.
The Senate passed this resolution,
17-8, and the Chicanos broke into
applause.
Presence Felt
The Chicano presence was
heavily felt throughout the
meeting. Edwards requested that
all Senators sit at the front of the

room so that there would be seats
for the contingent.
The group sat silently at the
back of the room as Dean of
Students Peter J. Bulkeley
explained the University
budgetary situation to the Senate.
Bulkeley said that, in the
absence of an effective Senate and
Constitution last spring, an
interim mechanism was needed to
organize the ASSU budget. He
was therefore appointed by the
administration to draw up, in
consultation with other
organizations, a tentative budget.
The tentative budget allocated
money to organizations that
needed it immediately, such as the
Pre-Reg committee, and also
assigned tentative amounts to
other organizations. His budget
called for a $4,875.00
Contribution to MECHA.
Bulkeley's comments were met by
silence from the MECHA
students.
