# Pitzer Firmly Rejects Braunstein Nomination
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
President Kenneth Pitzer
declared again yesterday that he
cannot accept Yale Braunstein for
a position on the trustee
committee on finance.
"I can't accept the Senate
nomination: it would be a
complete violation of the judicial
system of the campus. I have to
maintain the integrity of that
system," Pitzer told the Daily last
night.
Pitzer had vetoed Braunstein's
nomination before vacation
because he is on probation,
forbidding him from holding
positions on committees
appointed by the President or
other university officials.
Wednesday night, however, the
student Senate rejected Pitzer's
position by officially nominating
Braunstein for the post.
In a letter written to the Daily
(see page 2), Prof. Jack
Friedenthal, former chairman of
the Stanford Judicial Council
rejected the Senate's rationale for
pushing the Braunstein for the
post.
"The contest here is not
between the student Senate and
the University President," he
writes, "but between the student
Senate and all the constituencies

of the University, which, under
the Legislative and Judicial
Charter, have formally entrusted
the judicial process to special
student-faculty tribunals.
"If President Pitzer were now
to affirm Mr. Braunstein's
nomination, his act would directly
contravene the Charter. All the
University's recent constitutional
history flatly contradicts the
student Senate's notion that it,
and only it, can be a source of
power in the University regarding
any matter touching student
affairs."
Two Bases
Friedenthal makes this
contention on two bases: first,
that the ASSU Constitution only
guarantees students the right to
apply to committees, but does not
guarantee their right to serve.
Second, he contends that the
Legislative and Judicial Charter,
which contains the judicial
structure, is superior to the
Constitution.
The Constitution only states,
"The Association shall recognize
the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the
Association only if these bodies
have been approved by 2/3 of
those members of the Association

voting in a general election.
(Article IV, sec. 1.)"
Braunstein replies: "The
President and Prof. Friedenthal
refuse to recognize that the ASSU
Constitution not only specifies
the responsibilities of students
and student government but also
gives them well-defined rights.
''Article IV of the
Constitution, which was approved
by the President, permits the
Judicial Charter to exist but in no
manner makes anything superior
to the Constitution. This is
obvious because the Constitution
contains the procedures by which
a judicial document can be
accepted by the student body.
"Anyway what would be the
sense of being guaranteed the
right to apply for a committee if
the right to serve were not also
guaranteed."
It remains unclear what the
next step is. The Administration is
firm in its intention to uphold
Braunstein's probation and the
judicial system.
The Senate is also determined:
some members support Braunstein
because he is probably the student
most qualified to serve on a
finance committee, others because
of principle. Braunstein is their
man. The Senate meets next
Thursday.

positions on committees
appointed by the President or
other university officials.
Wednesday night, however, the
student Senate rejected Pitzer's
position by officially nominating
Braunstein for the post.
In a letter written to the Daily
(see page 2), Prof. Jack
Friedenthal, former chairman of
the Stanford Judicial Council
rejected the Senate's rationale for
pushing the Braunstein for the
post.
"The contest here is not
between the student Senate and
the University President," he
writes, "but between the student
Senate and all the constituencies

of the University, which, under
the Legislative and Judicial
Charter, have formally entrusted
the judicial process to special
student-faculty tribunals.
"If President Pitzer were now
to affirm Mr. Braunstein's
nomination, his act would directly
contravene the Charter. All the
University's recent constitutional
history flatly contradicts the
student Senate's notion that it,
and only it, can be a source of
power in the University regarding
any matter touching student
affairs."
Two Bases
Friedenthal makes this
contention on two bases: first,
that the ASSU Constitution only
guarantees students the right to
apply to committees, but does not
guarantee their right to serve.
Second, he contends that the
Legislative and Judicial Charter,
which contains the judicial
structure, is superior to the
Constitution.
The Constitution only states,
"The Association shall recognize
the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the
Association only if these bodies
have been approved by 2/3 of
those members of the Association

voting in a general election.
(Article IV, sec. 1.)"
Braunstein replies: "The
President and Prof. Friedenthal
refuse to recognize that the ASSU
Constitution not only specifies
the responsibilities of students
and student government but also
gives them well-defined rights.
''Article IV of the
Constitution, which was approved
by the President, permits the
Judicial Charter to exist but in no
manner makes anything superior
to the Constitution. This is
obvious because the Constitution
contains the procedures by which
a judicial document can be
accepted by the student body.
"Anyway what would be the
sense of being guaranteed the
right to apply for a committee if
the right to serve were not also
guaranteed."
It remains unclear what the
next step is. The Administration is
firm in its intention to uphold
Braunstein's probation and the
judicial system.
The Senate is also determined:
some members support Braunstein
because he is probably the student
most qualified to serve on a
finance committee, others because
of principle. Braunstein is their
man. The Senate meets next
Thursday.
President Kenneth Pitzer
declared again yesterday that he
cannot accept Yale Braunstein for
a position on the trustee
committee on finance.
"I can't accept the Senate
nomination: it would be a
complete violation of the judicial
system of the campus. I have to
maintain the integrity of that
system," Pitzer told the Daily last
night.
Pitzer had vetoed Braunstein's
nomination before vacation
because he is on probation,
forbidding him from holding
positions on committees
appointed by the President or
other university officials.
