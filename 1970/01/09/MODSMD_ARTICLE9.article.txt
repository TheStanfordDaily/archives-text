# Moratorium
## January Plans Focus On Small Groups 
### 
Little direct action has been
slated locally for the Jan. 15
Moratorium, but efforts will
continue to strengthen the 94
community peace centers
established in private homes.
A mass Town Meeting in
Memorial Church is also planned,
according to Bob Clark, a
coordinator for the local
Moratorium effort.
The Jan. 15 meeting will
consist of three parts, according
to local Moratorium co-chairmen
John Kramer and Martin Carnoy.
Madalaine Dudes, a member of
the Women's International League
for Peace and Freedom, and one
of 130 women who travelled to
Paris on behalf of the prisoners of
war, is slated to speak. Other
speakers will be announced soon.
A Town Meeting, chaired by
Carnoy, will follow, with
emphasis on possible action
community discussion groups can
take in the coming weeks. The

meeting would be held in an
"open mike" format to encourage
community participation. Bob
Clark said that he hoped ideas,
suggestions, and action would be
generated from the floor. He
termed the Town Meeting "a
chance for real participation in
decision making."
Albert Garrard will close the
meeting with a reading of a story
about the Song My massacre that
appeared recently in the "New
Yorker" magazine.
Clark said that there will be an
open meeting Sunday night in 270
Tresidder to discuss student
participation in a community
council that will be composed—if
the measure is approved by the
students—of four students, two
members of the faculty or staff,
and seven members of the
community at large. The council
was approved at a community
meeting Jan. 5.

He also said the Moratorium is
trying to place an organizer in
every dorm, department and
activity to make sure that ideas
filter up to the coordinators of
the movement. "We hope to
decentralize the decision-making
process an d increase
involvement," he said.
Nationwide Moratorium
emphasis will be placed on efforts
to convince the populace that
President Nixon's policies will not
end the war and that continuing
anti-war pressure is essential,
according to speakers at a Jan. 6
news conference in San Francisco.
Each mid-month will be called
"peace action" day. No major
rallies or demonstrations are
planned until April.
Taxpayer rallies April 15,
income tax filing deadline, will
"center on the issues of high taxes
due to disproportionate military
spending," one coordinator
explained.
Massive demonstrations,
supported by Gl's, are slated for
Good Friday (March 27) and
Memorial Day (May 30). These
demonstrations will provide
forums for disaffected Gl's to
explain their positions on the war.
Another important facet of
anti-war activity will be a
campaign to focus attention on
repression in this country. This
activity, which will be sponsored
by the New Mobilization to End
the War in Vietnam (New Mobe),
will take the form of an
anti-repression campaign in
support of the Black Panthers,
dissident Gl's and draft resisters.
The New Mobe also hopes to
focus attention on corporate
involvement in the war.
Several national groups are
concentrating on local political
activity. These groups intend to
work for candidates committed to
withdrawal. Moratorium leaders
plan to work closely with
"reform" groups such as the
Americans for Democratic Action,
providing a "funnel for
manpower" at the local level.
Current plans call for assistance to
50 or 60 as of yet unnamed
candidates to both houses of
Congress.

will take the form of an
anti-repression campaign in
support of the Black Panthers,
dissident Gl's and draft resisters.
The New Mobe also hopes to
focus attention on corporate
involvement in the war.
Several national groups are
concentrating on local political
activity. These groups intend to
work for candidates committed to
withdrawal. Moratorium leaders
plan to work closely with
"reform" groups such as the
Americans for Democratic Action,
providing a "funnel for
manpower" at the local level.
Current plans call for assistance to
50 or 60 as of yet unnamed
candidates to both houses of
Congress.
Little direct action has been
slated locally for the Jan. 15
Moratorium, but efforts will
continue to strengthen the 94
community peace centers
established in private homes.
A mass Town Meeting in
Memorial Church is also planned,
according to Bob Clark, a
coordinator for the local
Moratorium effort.
The Jan. 15 meeting will
consist of three parts, according
to local Moratorium co-chairmen
John Kramer and Martin Carnoy.
Madalaine Dudes, a member of
the Women's International League
for Peace and Freedom, and one
of 130 women who travelled to
Paris on behalf of the prisoners of
war, is slated to speak. Other
speakers will be announced soon.
A Town Meeting, chaired by
Carnoy, will follow, with
emphasis on possible action
community discussion groups can
take in the coming weeks. The

meeting would be held in an
"open mike" format to encourage
community participation. Bob
Clark said that he hoped ideas,
suggestions, and action would be
generated from the floor. He
termed the Town Meeting "a
chance for real participation in
decision making."
Albert Garrard will close the
meeting with a reading of a story
about the Song My massacre that
appeared recently in the "New
Yorker" magazine.
Clark said that there will be an
open meeting Sunday night in 270
Tresidder to discuss student
participation in a community
council that will be composed—if
the measure is approved by the
students—of four students, two
members of the faculty or staff,
and seven members of the
community at large. The council
was approved at a community
meeting Jan. 5.

He also said the Moratorium is
trying to place an organizer in
every dorm, department and
activity to make sure that ideas
filter up to the coordinators of
the movement. "We hope to
decentralize the decision-making
process an d increase
involvement," he said.
Nationwide Moratorium
emphasis will be placed on efforts
to convince the populace that
President Nixon's policies will not
end the war and that continuing
anti-war pressure is essential,
according to speakers at a Jan. 6
news conference in San Francisco.
Each mid-month will be called
"peace action" day. No major
rallies or demonstrations are
planned until April.
Taxpayer rallies April 15,
income tax filing deadline, will
"center on the issues of high taxes
due to disproportionate military
spending," one coordinator
explained.
Massive demonstrations,
supported by Gl's, are slated for
Good Friday (March 27) and
Memorial Day (May 30). These
demonstrations will provide
forums for disaffected Gl's to
explain their positions on the war.
Another important facet of
anti-war activity will be a
campaign to focus attention on
repression in this country. This
activity, which will be sponsored
by the New Mobilization to End
the War in Vietnam (New Mobe),
will take the form of an
anti-repression campaign in
support of the Black Panthers,
dissident Gl's and draft resisters.
