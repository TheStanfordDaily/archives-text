If you don't like the way people talk to each other,
we'll pay you to change it.
We're in the communications business.
And during the next 30 years we're going to upgrade all the equip
ment we now have in order to provide even better service to our 6 million
existing customers.
As if that weren't enough we're also going to have to come up with
enough new equipment to provide telephone service to about 26 million
more people. As well as equipment for a much more extensive data com
munications program.
We need enough people (electrical, civil, mechanical and industrial
engineers, designers, accountants and economists) to plan, design, build
and operate a company that will be four times bigger than we are today.
We also need engineers, researchers and scientists to develop electronic
switching equipment, laser and other communications systems we'll be
using 10, 25 and 50 years from now.
But this isonlyone part of our communications business.
Our Sylvania people, for example, are involved in other types of
communications. Like color television sets, satellite tracking stations
and educational television systems.
Automatic Electric, Lenkurt, Ultronic Systems and someof ourother
companies, subsidiaries and divisions are working on advanced types of
integrated circuitry, electro-opticals and communications systems be
tween people and computers and between computers and computers.
So if you think you have something to say about the way people talk
to each other... we're ready to listen.
