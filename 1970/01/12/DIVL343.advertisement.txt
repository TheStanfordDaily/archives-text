A First-Hand Chronicle
by Ruth Epperson Kennell
i
"This fascinating look at Dreiser's responses to a 77-day
visit to the USSR in 1927 is invaluable to any complete study
of this man who was one of our greatest novelists.
Mrs. Kennell, an Oklahoma-born writer who served as Dreiser's
secretary and interpreter in Russia, quotes from her notes made
at the time, and from letters written over the next 20 years; she
writes warmly of the Russian theater, churches, villages, city life,
the politics and political thought of that first Soviet decade. De
scribing personalities, her writing takes on new dimensions;
Dorothy Thompson is here, Bernard Shaw, Stanislavsky, Gorky,
Meyerhold. the Bolshoi Ballet." —Publisher's Weekly (10/20/69)
