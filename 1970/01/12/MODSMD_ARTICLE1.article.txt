# Despite Extensive Opposition
## Coyote Hills Industrialized 
### 
(Editor's note: This is the second
installment of a three part report
dealing with Stanford's land
usage. The first article appeared
last Thursday; the series will be
concluded later this week.)
Since World War 11, Stanford
University has grown from a
respected rural university into a
rapidly growing center of the
educational-industrial-financial
complex.
The industrial buildup of the
mid-peninsula region had its start
during the greatly increased
military demands of the second
World War; however, Stanford did
not join the movement until later.
The Stanford Industrial Park
was born in 1951 when Varian
Associates leased 10 acres in the
southeast corner of University
property, an area which had been
previously designated for limited
industrial development. In leasing
this land the University was
following policies which were
incorporated into the first of
several Master Plans for Land
Development.
During the first five years of its
development, the Park grew
slowly, with only seven leases
occupying 53 acres at the end of
1955. For most firms the use of
Stanford land is unfeasible
because of the very high standards
which have been set for its use.
High Standards, Low Income
The University has been very
careful in its selection of tenants
for the industrial park. Although
material considerations are
important, they are not the main
factor. By imposing development
standards unsurpassed anywhere
in the country, Stanford greatly
reduced the amount of income it
could have earned from the land it
has leased. According to one
University spokesman, quality has
been, and remains, the overriding
factor in deciding who would use
the University lands. Throughout
the years, the trustees have
insisted that the natural beauty of
the area and other aesthetic

qualities be preserved in the
development of Stanford
property.
The University does not solicit
firms to come to the Industrial
Park. Prospective tenants submit
plans to the University and those
that pass the preliminary tests are
invited to develop an overall plan
detailing the type, size, and
location of all buildings, roads,
parking lots, landscaping and
other factors. The plans are first
considered by the Business Office.
Then they are given to the
Faculty Advisory Committee on
Land Development, then to the
President, and finally to the Board
of Trustees for approval.
The 60 tenants who currently
occupy 571 acres in the industrial
park represent a diverse segment
of American industry. In addition
to the military-oriented industries,
the world's largest producer of
birth control pills, a manufacturer
of instruments for measurement
of air pollution, a company
seeking an insecticide that will not
harm the environment, and a
leader in the educational
computer field all lease land.
Coyote Hill Controversy
Expansion of Industrial Park
into the Coyote Hill area has been
the cause of much controversy
through the '60s. Actually,
Coyote Hill itself has not been in
danger, having been put into
academic reserve.
The expansion began in May
1960 when land surrounding
Coyote Hill was rezoned for
industrial use. Later, in November
of that year, a referendum was
introduced to block the rezoning.
However, after Stanford presented
its case to the voters, the issue was
defeated by a margin of 57V2
percent to 42'/2 percent.
Between 1963 and 1967
Stanford and the city of Palo Alto
prepared the site for development.
Plans were made for utilities and
roads to service the area. In 1968,
a tentative lot division map
covering the area was given

conditional approval by the city.
Final approval was given in April
1969, and Stanford immediately
signed construction contracts for
roads and utilities in the area.
Procedural Lawsuits
All has not gone smoothly,
however, in the Coyote Hill
development. Last summer the
city challenged Stanford's
subdivision of the property, and
even as that problem was being
settled in November, a law suit
was filed by the Committee for
Green Foothills in regard to the
subdivision procedures. The
University does not see these
obstacles as substantial, especially
since it could not begin building
during the wet winter months
anyway. Recently, Boyd Smith,
assistant manager of real estate,
commented, "We think the
lawsuit is a phony, and they don't
have any grounds to stand on in
court."
In addition to the Committee
for Green Foothills, Coyote Hill
development has encountered
opposition from several local
conservation groups including the
Stanford Conservation Group, the
Environmental Law Society, and
most recently the Grass Roots
organization.
The industrial development of
the Palo Alto region has led in
recent years to an acute housing
shortage. Last June a
student-faculty-staff committee
reported that a serious shortage of
low-income housing existed in the
area, that Stanford helped
produce it, and that the
University had "a moral
obligation to be actively involved
in solving problems affecting the
community."
Low Cost Housing Shortage
Since then the University has
made low-income housing a top
priority item of its development
program. Several sites are now
under consideration for low-cost
housing. Long overdue, the
Moore-Jacks student residences
have been delayed while the
University reviews the housing
needs and preferences in light of
the recent trends toward co-ed
living.
Perhaps the biggest stumbling
block to low-cost housing has
been congressional cuts in the
federal rent subsidies. This help is
a necessity for low-cost housing.
According to Smith, lack of
federal aid almost rules out the
economic feasibility of building
new apartments for low income
families. He says, for example,
that one of the main reasons for
the difference in rent between the
Oak Ridge apartments and the
Manzanita trailers is the lack of
federal aid to the former.
One housing project which was
begun on Stanford lands, but
which was never completed, was
to be located on the land near
Menlo Park and Atherton. Before
it could be built, the land was
diverted by the University to be
used for the Stanford Linear
Accelerator. The 480 acre, two
mile installation ended the
residential plans for the area.
Dam Proposal
Another undeveloped project is
the proposed Ladera Dam. The
Army Corps of Engineers
conceived of this earth-fill
structure across what is now
known as the Webb Ranch to
provide flood control for San
Francisquito Creek. For a few

weeks during wet years, the dam
would create a 450-acre lake. In
dry times, it would leave a
similarly large wallow in a huge
sun-baked basin.
After Stanford proposed an
alternate solution, the Army's
proposal was reconsidered. No
final solution has been reached
yet, although it is expected that
the dam plans will be dropped
within the next few months.
Another recent land use
controversy centers on the use of
Stanford property on the corner
of Page Mill and El Camino Real
for the Dillingham "Palo Alto
Square" development. The
financial center planned for that
20 acre plot would include two
10-story office towers, low-rise
office wings, a 17-story hotel and
convention center, and a large
theatre. The center is part of a
city plan to develop Palo Alto
into a financial center for the
entire mid-peninsula. Local
opposition however, has called it,
an architectural monostrosity. . .
certain to further increase the
frustration of the ordinary man. . .
and a potential catastrophy for
the area.


HORSE SENSE—iliesc peaceful-looking crcatures are the
present occupants of land that is slated to become "Palo
Alto Square," a $12 million development on University
laniLs. Grass Roots, one of several conservation
organizations protesting the Dillingham financial center,

plans a march and rally this afternoon at three along El
Camino to Page Mill Road. "Palo Alto Square" is one of
several land developments that have generated animosity
toward the University. For details, see the two stories
below.

dealing with Stanford's land
usage. The first article appeared
last Thursday; the series will be

Since World War 11, Stanford
University has grown from a
respected rural university into a
rapidly growing center of the
educational-industrial-financial
complex.
The industrial buildup of the
mid-peninsula region had its start
during the greatly increased
military demands of the second
World War; however, Stanford did
not join the movement until later.
The Stanford Industrial Park
was born in 1951 when Varian
Associates leased 10 acres in the
southeast corner of University
property, an area which had been
previously designated for limited
industrial development. In leasing
this land the University was
following policies which were
incorporated into the first of
several Master Plans for Land
Development.
During the first five years of its
development, the Park grew
slowly, with only seven leases
occupying 53 acres at the end of
1955. For most firms the use of
Stanford land is unfeasible
because of the very high standards
which have been set for its use.
High Standards, Low Income
The University has been very
careful in its selection of tenants
for the industrial park. Although
material considerations are
important, they are not the main
factor. By imposing development
standards unsurpassed anywhere
in the country, Stanford greatly
reduced the amount of income it
could have earned from the land it
has leased. According to one
University spokesman, quality has
been, and remains, the overriding
factor in deciding who would use
the University lands. Throughout
the years, the trustees have
insisted that the natural beauty of
the area and other aesthetic

qualities be preserved in the
development of Stanford
property.
The University does not solicit
firms to come to the Industrial
Park. Prospective tenants submit
plans to the University and those
that pass the preliminary tests are
invited to develop an overall plan
detailing the type, size, and
location of all buildings, roads,
parking lots, landscaping and
other factors. The plans are first
considered by the Business Office.
Then they are given to the
Faculty Advisory Committee on
Land Development, then to the
President, and finally to the Board
of Trustees for approval.
The 60 tenants who currently
occupy 571 acres in the industrial
park represent a diverse segment
of American industry. In addition
to the military-oriented industries,
the world's largest producer of
birth control pills, a manufacturer
of instruments for measurement
of air pollution, a company
seeking an insecticide that will not
harm the environment, and a
leader in the educational
computer field all lease land.
Coyote Hill Controversy
Expansion of Industrial Park
into the Coyote Hill area has been
the cause of much controversy
through the '60s. Actually,
Coyote Hill itself has not been in
danger, having been put into
academic reserve.
The expansion began in May
1960 when land surrounding
Coyote Hill was rezoned for
industrial use. Later, in November
of that year, a referendum was
introduced to block the rezoning.
However, after Stanford presented
its case to the voters, the issue was
defeated by a margin of 57V2
percent to 42'/2 percent.
Between 1963 and 1967
Stanford and the city of Palo Alto
prepared the site for development.
Plans were made for utilities and
roads to service the area. In 1968,
a tentative lot division map
covering the area was given

conditional approval by the city.
Final approval was given in April
1969, and Stanford immediately
signed construction contracts for
roads and utilities in the area.
Procedural Lawsuits
All has not gone smoothly,
however, in the Coyote Hill
development. Last summer the
city challenged Stanford's
subdivision of the property, and
even as that problem was being
settled in November, a law suit
was filed by the Committee for
Green Foothills in regard to the
subdivision procedures. The
University does not see these
obstacles as substantial, especially
since it could not begin building
during the wet winter months
anyway. Recently, Boyd Smith,
assistant manager of real estate,
commented, "We think the
lawsuit is a phony, and they don't
have any grounds to stand on in
court."
In addition to the Committee
for Green Foothills, Coyote Hill
development has encountered
opposition from several local
conservation groups including the
Stanford Conservation Group, the
Environmental Law Society, and
most recently the Grass Roots
organization.
The industrial development of
the Palo Alto region has led in
recent years to an acute housing
shortage. Last June a
student-faculty-staff committee
reported that a serious shortage of
low-income housing existed in the
area, that Stanford helped
produce it, and that the
University had "a moral
obligation to be actively involved
in solving problems affecting the
community."
Low Cost Housing Shortage
Since then the University has
made low-income housing a top
priority item of its development
program. Several sites are now
under consideration for low-cost
housing. Long overdue, the
Moore-Jacks student residences
have been delayed while the
University reviews the housing
needs and preferences in light of
the recent trends toward co-ed
living.
Perhaps the biggest stumbling
block to low-cost housing has
been congressional cuts in the
federal rent subsidies. This help is
a necessity for low-cost housing.
According to Smith, lack of
federal aid almost rules out the
economic feasibility of building
new apartments for low income
families. He says, for example,
that one of the main reasons for
the difference in rent between the
Oak Ridge apartments and the
Manzanita trailers is the lack of
federal aid to the former.
One housing project which was
begun on Stanford lands, but
which was never completed, was
to be located on the land near
Menlo Park and Atherton. Before
it could be built, the land was
diverted by the University to be
used for the Stanford Linear
Accelerator. The 480 acre, two
mile installation ended the
residential plans for the area.
Dam Proposal
Another undeveloped project is
the proposed Ladera Dam. The
Army Corps of Engineers
conceived of this earth-fill
structure across what is now
known as the Webb Ranch to
provide flood control for San
Francisquito Creek. For a few

weeks during wet years, the dam
would create a 450-acre lake. In
dry times, it would leave a
similarly large wallow in a huge
sun-baked basin.
After Stanford proposed an
alternate solution, the Army's
proposal was reconsidered. No
final solution has been reached
yet, although it is expected that
the dam plans will be dropped
within the next few months.
Another recent land use
controversy centers on the use of
Stanford property on the corner
of Page Mill and El Camino Real
for the Dillingham "Palo Alto
Square" development. The
financial center planned for that
20 acre plot would include two
10-story office towers, low-rise
office wings, a 17-story hotel and
convention center, and a large
theatre. The center is part of a
city plan to develop Palo Alto
into a financial center for the
entire mid-peninsula. Local
opposition however, has called it,
an architectural monostrosity. . .
certain to further increase the
frustration of the ordinary man. . .
and a potential catastrophy for
the area.

organizations protesting the Dillingham financial center,

Camino to Page Mill Road. "Palo Alto Square" is one of

(Editor's note: This is the second

dealing with Stanford's land

last Thursday; the series will be

Since World War 11, Stanford
University has grown from a
respected rural university into a
rapidly growing center of the
educational-industrial-financial
complex.
The industrial buildup of the
mid-peninsula region had its start
during the greatly increased
military demands of the second
World War; however, Stanford did
not join the movement until later.
The Stanford Industrial Park
was born in 1951 when Varian
Associates leased 10 acres in the
southeast corner of University
property, an area which had been
previously designated for limited
industrial development. In leasing
this land the University was
following policies which were
incorporated into the first of
several Master Plans for Land
Development.
During the first five years of its
development, the Park grew
slowly, with only seven leases
occupying 53 acres at the end of
1955. For most firms the use of
Stanford land is unfeasible
because of the very high standards
which have been set for its use.
High Standards, Low Income
The University has been very
careful in its selection of tenants
for the industrial park. Although
material considerations are
important, they are not the main
factor. By imposing development
standards unsurpassed anywhere
in the country, Stanford greatly
reduced the amount of income it
could have earned from the land it
has leased. According to one
University spokesman, quality has
been, and remains, the overriding
factor in deciding who would use
the University lands. Throughout
the years, the trustees have
insisted that the natural beauty of
the area and other aesthetic

qualities be preserved in the
development of Stanford
property.
The University does not solicit
firms to come to the Industrial
Park. Prospective tenants submit
plans to the University and those
that pass the preliminary tests are
invited to develop an overall plan
detailing the type, size, and
location of all buildings, roads,
parking lots, landscaping and
other factors. The plans are first
considered by the Business Office.
Then they are given to the
Faculty Advisory Committee on
Land Development, then to the
President, and finally to the Board
of Trustees for approval.
The 60 tenants who currently
occupy 571 acres in the industrial
park represent a diverse segment
of American industry. In addition
to the military-oriented industries,
the world's largest producer of
birth control pills, a manufacturer
of instruments for measurement
of air pollution, a company
seeking an insecticide that will not
harm the environment, and a
leader in the educational
computer field all lease land.
Coyote Hill Controversy
Expansion of Industrial Park
into the Coyote Hill area has been
the cause of much controversy
through the '60s. Actually,
Coyote Hill itself has not been in
danger, having been put into
academic reserve.
The expansion began in May
1960 when land surrounding
Coyote Hill was rezoned for
industrial use. Later, in November
of that year, a referendum was
introduced to block the rezoning.
However, after Stanford presented
its case to the voters, the issue was
defeated by a margin of 57V2
percent to 42'/2 percent.
Between 1963 and 1967
Stanford and the city of Palo Alto
prepared the site for development.
Plans were made for utilities and
roads to service the area. In 1968,
a tentative lot division map
covering the area was given

conditional approval by the city.
Final approval was given in April
1969, and Stanford immediately
signed construction contracts for
roads and utilities in the area.
Procedural Lawsuits
All has not gone smoothly,
however, in the Coyote Hill
development. Last summer the
city challenged Stanford's
subdivision of the property, and
even as that problem was being
settled in November, a law suit
was filed by the Committee for
Green Foothills in regard to the
subdivision procedures. The
University does not see these
obstacles as substantial, especially
since it could not begin building
during the wet winter months
anyway. Recently, Boyd Smith,
assistant manager of real estate,
commented, "We think the
lawsuit is a phony, and they don't
have any grounds to stand on in
court."
In addition to the Committee
for Green Foothills, Coyote Hill
development has encountered
opposition from several local
conservation groups including the
Stanford Conservation Group, the
Environmental Law Society, and
most recently the Grass Roots
organization.
The industrial development of
the Palo Alto region has led in
recent years to an acute housing
shortage. Last June a
student-faculty-staff committee
reported that a serious shortage of
low-income housing existed in the
area, that Stanford helped
produce it, and that the
University had "a moral
obligation to be actively involved
in solving problems affecting the
community."
Low Cost Housing Shortage
Since then the University has
made low-income housing a top
priority item of its development
program. Several sites are now
under consideration for low-cost
housing. Long overdue, the
Moore-Jacks student residences
have been delayed while the
University reviews the housing
needs and preferences in light of
the recent trends toward co-ed
living.
Perhaps the biggest stumbling
block to low-cost housing has
been congressional cuts in the
federal rent subsidies. This help is
a necessity for low-cost housing.
According to Smith, lack of
federal aid almost rules out the
economic feasibility of building
new apartments for low income
families. He says, for example,
that one of the main reasons for
the difference in rent between the
Oak Ridge apartments and the
Manzanita trailers is the lack of
federal aid to the former.
One housing project which was
begun on Stanford lands, but
which was never completed, was
to be located on the land near
Menlo Park and Atherton. Before
it could be built, the land was
diverted by the University to be
used for the Stanford Linear
Accelerator. The 480 acre, two
mile installation ended the
residential plans for the area.
Dam Proposal
Another undeveloped project is
the proposed Ladera Dam. The
Army Corps of Engineers
conceived of this earth-fill
structure across what is now
known as the Webb Ranch to
provide flood control for San
Francisquito Creek. For a few

weeks during wet years, the dam
would create a 450-acre lake. In
dry times, it would leave a
similarly large wallow in a huge
sun-baked basin.
After Stanford proposed an
alternate solution, the Army's
proposal was reconsidered. No
final solution has been reached
yet, although it is expected that
the dam plans will be dropped
within the next few months.
Another recent land use
controversy centers on the use of
Stanford property on the corner
of Page Mill and El Camino Real
for the Dillingham "Palo Alto
Square" development. The
financial center planned for that
20 acre plot would include two
10-story office towers, low-rise
office wings, a 17-story hotel and
convention center, and a large
theatre. The center is part of a
city plan to develop Palo Alto
into a financial center for the
entire mid-peninsula. Local
opposition however, has called it,
an architectural monostrosity. . .
certain to further increase the
frustration of the ordinary man. . .
and a potential catastrophy for
the area.

organizations protesting the Dillingham financial center,

organizations protesting the Dillingham financial center,

plans a march and rally this afternoon at three along El
Camino to Page Mill Road. "Palo Alto Square" is one of
several land developments that have generated animosity
toward the University. For details, see the two stories
below.
(Editor's note: This is the second
installment of a three part report
dealing with Stanford's land
usage. The first article appeared
last Thursday; the series will be
concluded later this week.)
Since World War 11, Stanford
University has grown from a
respected rural university into a
rapidly growing center of the
educational-industrial-financial
complex.
The industrial buildup of the
mid-peninsula region had its start
during the greatly increased
military demands of the second
World War; however, Stanford did
not join the movement until later.
The Stanford Industrial Park
was born in 1951 when Varian
Associates leased 10 acres in the
southeast corner of University
property, an area which had been
previously designated for limited
industrial development. In leasing
this land the University was
following policies which were
incorporated into the first of
several Master Plans for Land
Development.
During the first five years of its
development, the Park grew
slowly, with only seven leases
occupying 53 acres at the end of
1955. For most firms the use of
Stanford land is unfeasible
because of the very high standards
which have been set for its use.
High Standards, Low Income
The University has been very
careful in its selection of tenants
for the industrial park. Although
material considerations are
important, they are not the main
factor. By imposing development
standards unsurpassed anywhere
in the country, Stanford greatly
reduced the amount of income it
could have earned from the land it
has leased. According to one
University spokesman, quality has
been, and remains, the overriding
factor in deciding who would use
the University lands. Throughout
the years, the trustees have
insisted that the natural beauty of
the area and other aesthetic

qualities be preserved in the
development of Stanford
property.
The University does not solicit
firms to come to the Industrial
Park. Prospective tenants submit
plans to the University and those
that pass the preliminary tests are
invited to develop an overall plan
detailing the type, size, and
location of all buildings, roads,
parking lots, landscaping and
other factors. The plans are first
considered by the Business Office.
Then they are given to the
Faculty Advisory Committee on
Land Development, then to the
President, and finally to the Board
of Trustees for approval.
The 60 tenants who currently
occupy 571 acres in the industrial
park represent a diverse segment
of American industry. In addition
to the military-oriented industries,
the world's largest producer of
birth control pills, a manufacturer
of instruments for measurement
of air pollution, a company
seeking an insecticide that will not
harm the environment, and a
leader in the educational
computer field all lease land.
Coyote Hill Controversy
Expansion of Industrial Park
into the Coyote Hill area has been
the cause of much controversy
through the '60s. Actually,
Coyote Hill itself has not been in
danger, having been put into
academic reserve.
The expansion began in May
1960 when land surrounding
Coyote Hill was rezoned for
industrial use. Later, in November
of that year, a referendum was
introduced to block the rezoning.
However, after Stanford presented
its case to the voters, the issue was
defeated by a margin of 57V2
percent to 42'/2 percent.
Between 1963 and 1967
Stanford and the city of Palo Alto
prepared the site for development.
Plans were made for utilities and
roads to service the area. In 1968,
a tentative lot division map
covering the area was given

conditional approval by the city.
Final approval was given in April
1969, and Stanford immediately
signed construction contracts for
roads and utilities in the area.
Procedural Lawsuits
All has not gone smoothly,
however, in the Coyote Hill
development. Last summer the
city challenged Stanford's
subdivision of the property, and
even as that problem was being
settled in November, a law suit
was filed by the Committee for
Green Foothills in regard to the
subdivision procedures. The
University does not see these
obstacles as substantial, especially
since it could not begin building
during the wet winter months
anyway. Recently, Boyd Smith,
assistant manager of real estate,
commented, "We think the
lawsuit is a phony, and they don't
have any grounds to stand on in
court."
In addition to the Committee
for Green Foothills, Coyote Hill
development has encountered
opposition from several local
conservation groups including the
Stanford Conservation Group, the
Environmental Law Society, and
most recently the Grass Roots
organization.
The industrial development of
the Palo Alto region has led in
recent years to an acute housing
shortage. Last June a
student-faculty-staff committee
reported that a serious shortage of
low-income housing existed in the
area, that Stanford helped
produce it, and that the
University had "a moral
obligation to be actively involved
in solving problems affecting the
community."
Low Cost Housing Shortage
Since then the University has
made low-income housing a top
priority item of its development
program. Several sites are now
under consideration for low-cost
housing. Long overdue, the
Moore-Jacks student residences
have been delayed while the
University reviews the housing
needs and preferences in light of
the recent trends toward co-ed
living.
Perhaps the biggest stumbling
block to low-cost housing has
been congressional cuts in the
federal rent subsidies. This help is
a necessity for low-cost housing.
According to Smith, lack of
federal aid almost rules out the
economic feasibility of building
new apartments for low income
families. He says, for example,
that one of the main reasons for
the difference in rent between the
Oak Ridge apartments and the
Manzanita trailers is the lack of
federal aid to the former.
One housing project which was
begun on Stanford lands, but
which was never completed, was
to be located on the land near
Menlo Park and Atherton. Before
it could be built, the land was
diverted by the University to be
used for the Stanford Linear
Accelerator. The 480 acre, two
mile installation ended the
residential plans for the area.
Dam Proposal
Another undeveloped project is
the proposed Ladera Dam. The
Army Corps of Engineers
conceived of this earth-fill
structure across what is now
known as the Webb Ranch to
provide flood control for San
Francisquito Creek. For a few

weeks during wet years, the dam
would create a 450-acre lake. In
dry times, it would leave a
similarly large wallow in a huge
sun-baked basin.
After Stanford proposed an
alternate solution, the Army's
proposal was reconsidered. No
final solution has been reached
yet, although it is expected that
the dam plans will be dropped
within the next few months.
Another recent land use
controversy centers on the use of
Stanford property on the corner
of Page Mill and El Camino Real
for the Dillingham "Palo Alto
Square" development. The
financial center planned for that
20 acre plot would include two
10-story office towers, low-rise
office wings, a 17-story hotel and
convention center, and a large
theatre. The center is part of a
city plan to develop Palo Alto
into a financial center for the
entire mid-peninsula. Local
opposition however, has called it,
an architectural monostrosity. . .
certain to further increase the
frustration of the ordinary man. . .
and a potential catastrophy for
the area.
