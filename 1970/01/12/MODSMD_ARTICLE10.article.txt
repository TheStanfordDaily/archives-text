# Almost A Final Word On BYU
## Stanford Action: “Regretable’ But Right 
### John D. Black 
Alumnus Reed Watkins has
written a temperate and rational
comment on the Stanford-BYU
situation, which is a refreshing
contrast to much that has been
said and written on the subject,
including some of the remarks of
BYU President Wilkinson.
Unfortunately, he makes the
same mistake most others have
made by operating from the
assumption that Stanford was
attempting, by its action, to
coerce or persuade the Mormon

Church to alter its doctrines. I am
sure neither Dr. Pitzer nor the
Human Relations Commission
regarded that goal as appropriate
for us to undertake or that either
had such exaggerated notions of
Stanford's influence.
All the critics seem to overlook
the crucial fact that we have
finally come to realize that it is
unconscionable for the university
to force students to participate in
an act that they regard as an

affront to their human dignity, a
blow to their struggle to achieve
self-esteem.
The U.S. Employment Service
would not force a Jew to accept a
job in a country club that
excluded Jews membership. The
Fairmont Hotel would not require
Negro waiters to serve a banquet
honoring George Wallace. We
would not, I am sure, ask our
Black athletes to play a team from
the University of South Africa.
While the position of the Mormon

Church differs in substantial
degree from that of South Africa's
government, both ostensibly say
the Black man is not entitled to
the same status or privileges as the
white man, and if you're being
discriminated against, the hurt
doesn't vary with the degree.
Individuals Answer?
Some critics might argue that
we could solve the problem by
permitting athletes as individuals
to refuse to play certain teams
when to do so would be

personally offensive to them.
Aside from the fact that such a
policy would make it far more
difficult to field a winning team,
it is unacceptable on other
grounds.
Intercollegiate athletics is an
official university activity carrying
unit credit toward graduation; it is
also for many students a valuable
means to financing their
education and, for a gifted few,
playing regularly and well may be
vital to future athletic careers. For

most varsity athletes,
participation is also important to
their physical and phychological
well being. For all these reasons,
athletics cannot be viewed as a
trivial and entirely voluntary
extra-curricular function that does
not deserve the same moral
scrutiny we would give, let us say,
to the grading practices of a
university department with
respect to minority students.
Some critics have the
impression that the Mormons
merely exclude Blacks from some
few special positions of honor and
responsibility (though if such
were the case it would still
constitute discrimination).
Actually, of course, as a church
without professional clergy, the
"priesthood" is the class of
membership held by almost all
Mormon men over twelve years
old, and a white youth who does
not choose to enter it is, for all
practical purposes, a drop-out.
Denied Manhood
It may also be that, perhaps
unconsciously, the Negro race is
particularly offended by the
Church's stand because it singles
out its males for exclusion from a
symbolic transition from boyhood
to manhood, and this appears to
deny Black masculinity.
A church is a private, voluntary
association of persons and as such,
it has a right to choose its own
members and to believe in God as
revealed to its members. On the
other hand, Stanford University
has an obligation to its students to
refrain from sanctioning officially
or being a part, to relationships or
activities which constitute
discrimination on the basis of
race, creed, or color. Regretablc
though it is on many counts, the
University's action seems to me
eminently right. (.John D. Black is
