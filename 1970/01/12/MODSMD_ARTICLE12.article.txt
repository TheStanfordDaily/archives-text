## The 						Floating University

The University, from its
inception at Texila, India (now
Pakistan) or later in ancient
Greece, or still later during the
medieval period in Europe, has
undergone enormous changes. But
there are certain aspects of it
which have remained wholly
unaltered. University has been in
the past and remains at present a
land based institution.
Many new forms of universities
arc predicted in the twenty first
century, the University Cities,
Multiversity etc. . But the most
interesting invention of the
coming century would be the
mobile university, a university
ship floating on the high seas and
other waterways.
The floating university would
not be introduced because of land
scarcity. The population
explosion (if it follows the
present predictions) is not
expected to reach a disasterous
scale in the next century. The
prime justification to move the
institution of learning out of land
to sea lies in its adaptability to
t,h e needs of growing
internationalism in education. The
present solutions to this problem
such as exchange of scholars or
campuses abroad are inadequate.
A floating university, because of
its mobility, will be in a position
to use instruction and facilities of
another floating or land based
(near the harbour) university in
addition to its own. It will be
possible for a student of a floating
university to spend a quarter of
language learning in France or
Germany, another quarter in
U.S.A. learning computer sciences
and yet another quarter in
developing country studying some
aspects of agricultural economics.
A floating university will have
the advantage of creating a perfect
balance between academic
persuits and recreation. It is
conceivable to arrange a schedule
in a way that most of the working
days are spent on the high seas,
Isolated from the hussle and
bussle of the populated areas, thus
providing an ideal working
environment. The holidays and
weekends could very well be spent
participating in a community's

activities-while docked in a near
by port - sight seeing or in any
other desirable way.
Space Limitations Solved
For the university to become
ship bounded, certain
developments in education
technology have to precede. A
university essentially consists ol a
student body, teaching staff (and
administration), libraries, class
rooms and laboratories. Most of
the space in a university is
required for class room and
library purposes. There is a move
going on to simplify the library
techniques and class room
instruction methods. Microfilm
techniques can drastically reduce
the library space requirement,
perhaps to one-tenth. The formal
type of class room lecture is also
giving way to an informal
discussion or seminar session.
These two developments will
make it possible to run a
university efficiently within the
space limitations of a ship. It is
also imaginable that living rooms,
bed rooms and open decks of a
university ship serve as an extra
space for informal seminar
sessions.
Another great advantage of the
university ship would be a close,
informal and harmonious
relationship between the teacher
and the taught. This will be
developed primarily because of
the "passenger psychology". Like
the passengers of a cruising voyage
- where all formalities and status
symbols are forgotten and
everyone thinks of himself and
others as just passangers the
relationship between the students
and professors will be more of
equals.
One of the weaknesses of the
land based universities is the lack
of communication between the
scholars at national and
international levels. There will be
a lot more exchange of scholars
between the floating universities
because of the very nature of their
make-up. Two or more floating
universities sailing on the same
route would not find it
inconvenient to exchange half ot
their student body or teaching
staff for a few weeks or a quarter
or so. Besides academic benefits,

the exchange of young scholars on
such a mass scale would add
variety and diversity to their
social life.
li.N . Problem Sol\ ed
Floating university would be
an ideal solution to the problem
facing the United Nations in
establishing an International
University. United Nations has
found it almost exhausting to
select a country to locate
International University. No
country seems to satisfy the
Secretary General's criteria "that
it be a country noted for its spirit
of tolerance and freedom of
thought". Floating university
appears not only to satisfy the
Secretary General's criteria but it
will also be acceptable to all the
member states since it can visit
their respective shores on a
pre-planned schedule.
There are many problems
which a university ship must solve
before it would gain acceptability
and popularity among the
scholars. Leading one is sea

sickness. From the present
experience of some nations
operating "factory ships", canning
fish, it appears that sea sickness
can be overcome. Besides it is not
unreasonable to expect that the
improved technology of the next
century would make the sea
passage fairly smooth and sea
sickness,even in the roughest seas.
Before the floating university
becomes a reality, some sort of
experimentation is necessary. The
responsibility for this should
logically fall on an advanced and
wealthy nation such as United
States. Perhaps U.S. Naval Ship
New Jersey recently suspended
from active service, after
neces s a r y renov a t i on an d
modifications could become an
experimental U. become an
experimental U.S. University Ship
New Jersey.
