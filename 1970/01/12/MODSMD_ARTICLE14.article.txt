# On The Question Of Fascism
## A 						Cold Day In The Booth 
### Miriam Cherry 
When I sat at our booth last
week near white plaza it provided
me with more questions than
answers. Passers-bv glanced at the
sign THE COMMUNITY
AGAINST WAR AND FASCISM,
apparently not a new name to
some. Occasionally, there was a
shudder from those quickly
eyeing the bulletin board that
pictured the bloodied bodies of
the My Lai women and children.
One person walked by reading the
sign aloud, "Genocide". I asked
those who neared the table if they
had signed the petition protesting
the treatment Bobby Seale
received in Judge Hoffman's court

â€” the treatment which denied his
constitutional rights. Mostly there
was a favorable response to the
petition as names were eagarly
attached by displaying a negative
shake of the head and continuing
along the path, "business as
usual".
A question that had been
forming in my mind was finally
addressed to a student who had
just finished signing the petition:
"Aren't Stanford students
interested in the problem of
genocide?" He replied, "They
don't believe it. It's easier to
block it than to try to think about
it."

What that student's evaluation
said to me was that if creative and
intellectual youth are not
interested in grappling with
whether or not there are forms of
genocide perpetrated against the
Vietnamese, the Blacks, the
Chicanos, and the American
Indians, then there is possibly no
consideration of what fascism is
or whether it now exists in the
U.S. or whether there is a fast
move in that direction.
Could it be there is such a lack
of inner-freedom, even among the
youth, that they prefer authority
with all its law-and-order demands
to taking responsible action for a

better government for all people?
Is there such enormous fear that
as individuals we will fail if we
attempt to challenge the System?
Do the vast majority, therefore,
want to be controlled by mass
media, by politicians, by secret
agents, by police, by the military,
and by a double-standard of
justice in the courts? That is why,
you see, that cold day at the
booth left me with a lot of
questions.
