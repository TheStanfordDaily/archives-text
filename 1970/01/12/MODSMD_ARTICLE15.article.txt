Poisoned Ground
Editor, THE DAILY:
Manzanita Park use to be a
empty field covered with the
nearest natural plant community
on campus—grass, weeds, and wild
plants. But in the name of
progress, they have changed it
into a trailer park, and have
attempted to make it green once
again. I was initially shocked
when I saw the man come around
with soil sterilizer and put it on
the ground before the stones were
put down. He scattered his little
pieces of chemicals around the
sidewalks and steps to our trailer
and we quickly brushed them off
before the neighborhood pets got
to them.
Thinking this was their last
mistake, 1 walked out of my
trailer Tuesday morning only to
bo thrown into shock—men
Spraying weed poison on all the
soil. It was too late. Maybe no
trailer park animals died, but it
certainly hasn't helped their
health. Everyone knows there are
hundreds of dogs and cats
officially or unofficially in the
trailers who are now surrounded
by poisoned ground. And if the
trailers are really temporary, all of
the chemicals now in the soil
certainly won't help future plants.
I predict that unless we
examine these methods, more
poisons will be sprayed on the
trees, on the grass field, and of
course on the soil to save those
precious ice plants. Just as Prof,
fehrlich said on T.V. Wednesday
nigbt, ecology starts at home.

LStrange World
I
• Editor, THE DAILY:
I It is a strange world when
[Michael Sweeney (Ecology Begins
'at Home, Stanford Dail>, 6
•'January 1970) in the name of
{working people can condemn
{Stanford for helping to create jobs
•for 17,000 workers and for
'considering the creation of jobs
for another 4,500 to 6,500. We
; must control our environment and
■insure that, we leave the best

possible world for our children,
but we must also provide the
day-to-day necessities of life. The
17,000 workers must provide
these for themselves and their
families. These 17,000 workers
and their families are living
realities. If Mr. Sweeney could bar
them from the mid-peninsula,
where would he have them go? If
4,500 to 6,500 additional people
are available for employment on
Stanford land, they must also
exist and need the work. Would
they cease to exist if no jobs were
provided? It is striking that Mr.
Sweeney should find the
University somewhat hypocritical
for providing jobs, for thousands
without also providing housing for
them. He would apparently solve
their housing problem by denying
them jobs.
All this is not to say that we do
not have critical ecological
problems. We do, but we must
find rational solutions. For
example, Mr. Sweeney is rightly
concerned about the smog and
congestion produced by driving to
and from work, but isn't it better
to solve this problem through
smog-free public transportation
rather than by denying jobs to
those who need them?
Low-cost housing, minority
employment porgrams and above
all educational institutions are
good, but they do not generate, in
themselves, the materials
necessary to support life.

Monday night
I've been reading Mailer's
Armies of I li e Night, a
more-or-less subjective account of
the '67 march on the Pentagon.
f*'ge 307 there's an account of
how one girl was beaten and
dragged off, her face a ragged
patchwork of skin and blood. I
read it and something happened, I
don't know what it was, a
crystaline flash of the clarity that
must come with satori. It was as if
my blood boiled. All the good
pragmatic rationalization I've

papered over my conscience
seared away, I was almost
nauseous at my own cowardice.
Were I blind as some are, I would
be evil in my blindness; but with
all the tutored, nutured sharpness
of my moral vision, I've used my
intellect to sell out a realization of
common humanity.
Sure I'm a drug-deranged
danger to American society, I've
tasted love and brotherhood and
honesty and sulked away to join
the oppressors of our brutalized
anesthesized society.
And I'm writing about it. I
think and talk and reason about it
until my opiated conscience
doesn't hurt any more. Schooled
to a fine pitch of rationality, I
need not fear the human vision
within me because I've the
Novocain of careful thought and
pragmatic clearheadedness. I guess
I haven't the moral strength of
Lyndon Johnson, and by now
calling myself names I've solved
even that realization. My fervor's
abated now, I can go and read or
eat or sleep and this razor insight
will doubtless fade with time.

A rah Hoodlums
(Following is a copy of a letter
sent to the Israeli Ambassador,
Yitzhak Rabin, by Maury Travis,
Stanford graduate)
Yitzhak Rabin, the great Israeli
general, mastermind of the
greatest military victory June
510, 19fi7 over all Arab armies,
now Ambassador of Israel,
Wash ing ton, D.C.—hounded.

harassed, heckled, shouted at,
interrupted by Arab student
hoodlums at Stanford December
4, 1969 .
My dead Ambassador Rabin:
As a Stanford alumnus (Class
of 1926, AB 1927, AM 1930
Earth Sciences (Geology) I wish
to apologize for the regrettable
incident of December 4, 1969,
Stanford University, Tresidder
Large Lounge, by Stanford Arab
students and others.
I am notifying immediately the
U.S. Immigration Naturalization
Service (Washington, D.C.) and
the Institute International
Education (New York City)
asking for immediate investigation
and proceedings leading to
deportation of all Aral) students
involved.
Please be assured that the great
majority of Stanford students and
alumni and the officers of
Stanford University have the
greatest respect for The State of
Israel.
Nevertheless, it is reprehensible
that Stanford security officers did
not provide sufficient protection
to insure a peaceful, orderly and
dignified appearance of Your
Excellency.
On February 20, 1967 I made
a similar apology to The
Honorable Vice-President Hubert
H. Humphrey who was subjected
to an attempted assault by
students and non-students after a
well-received address, also by a
minority clique of hoodlums.
Yours very respectfully
MAURY M. TRAVIS
