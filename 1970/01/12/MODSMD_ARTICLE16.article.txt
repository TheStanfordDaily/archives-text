# Jet Watchers Make SF Airport Scene
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
It's tuc greatest show on earth,
and not >;ven P.T. Barnum himself
collects < nickel for it.
It's the San Francisco
International Airport, which aside
from b» irg a terminal for airlines
and thrir passengers, offers the
Bay Ar« i a daily show. It never
varies, but the spectators keep
coming .nyhow.
A inny day brings out
rubber uckers from all over who
sit and vatch as jet after jet taxis
out ont > the runways and, with a
blast of .moke and sound, lifts off
the ground for distant
destinat ons.
Watch from Cars
Most of them park along the
southern and western edges of the
Airport. Taking the Millbrae exit
'on the May shore (one exit south
d)f the Airport proper), simply
cross the Freeway and follow Old
jßayshore Road. One favorite spot
is along the old highway, where it
Jneets the Bay. Here the delights
fof vicarious flight join those of
pay-wat vhing, another popular
pastime involving wildlife, East
bay scenery (on a clear day), and
boats.
* To gf-t closer looks at the
transportation picture, one need
Simply follow the Old Bayshore
Highway north, going straight
where the road curves west to
cross the freeway. Here the thrill
of close action can stir your
blood, engulf your eyes, bloubout
your ear:-, and even hit your face.
Sightseeir-g in this region—near

the red windshield at the end of
the runway, is out of the
ordinary. The signs warn of jet
blast, and the warnings have their
merits.
At this range the noise and the
very vibrations of jet engines
overwhelm you. A 727 or a 707
lumbers along the runway on its
awkward way up, leaving the
spectator in its trail. The scene is
dramatic, and a coat to shield
your face and ears comes in
mighty handy.
Mixed Crowd Makes Scene
As a spontaneous, individual
activity, plane watching is limited
to no age group, race, sex, or class
level. A sample afternoon brought
out an old man in a Rambler, a
housewife and kids in a Ford
station wagon, a photographer in
a Volkswagen, and two hitchikers.
They come to see modern
technology in action, and the
airport obliges with an honest
spectacle. The jets leave in their
wakes huge clouds of black
exhaust, the freeway adds its own
special smog and noise, while the
Bay itself looks slightly putrid.
Perhaps P.T. Barnum was
right—a sucker is born every
minute.
