# This Week's Films
## Harlow, Polanski, And Bates On View 
### TODD McCARTHY 
This week's films lean heavily
to the somberly dramatic. At the
same time, however, what is close
to the best work of John
Schlesinger, Jean Cocteau, Akira
Kurosawa and Joseph Losey is on
view, as well as films of varying
quality by Antonioni, Roman
Polanski and Jean Vigo.
Clive Miller's Tuesday night
program in Geology 320 starts off
at 8 p.m. with a 30-minute
excerpt from Shipmates Forever,
a 1935 musical with Dick Powell
and Ruby Keeler. Following that
at 8:30 and 10:30 is Bombshell, a
fine 1933 comedy starring Jean
Harlow, who gives what is
probably her best performance in
this picture. Those who are
familiar with Harlow only as a
legend and not as an actress would
do well to be introduced to her
here.
Eclipse has been the subject of
vehement arguments among
critics, some finding it a deeply
meaningful expression of
contemporary alienation and
others finding it a singularly
dismal experience. Undoubtedly,
anyone interested in Antonioni
will consider his 1961 film
mandatory viewing. At Tresidder
on Wednesday.
Vampyr on Tuesday
Carl Dreyer's Vampyr has
taken its place in film history as
one of the few films roughly
described as vampire movies to
transcent the genre and invoke
genuine horror. At the same time,
the Danish director's film seems
somewhat silly and inordinately

slow today. But, as Dreyer himself
has stated in response to this
criticism, "The rhythm of a film
depends on the rhythm of milieu
and epoch." This 1931
production, admittedly filled with
some astonishing visual effects,
will be shown on Thursday at
7:45 in Cubberley by the
International Association.
Racial attitudes have greatly
changed since A Raisin in the Sun
was released in 1961, but the fine
humor and humanistic qualities of
Lorraine Hansberry's play have
remained engaging constants over
the years. Really not much as film
but the performances of Sidney
Poitier, Claudia McNeill, Ruby
Dee, Diana Sands and Ivon Dixon
are uniformly excellent. In Bishop
Auditorium at 7 and 9:30 on
Thursday.
Schlosinger and Bates
The seldom-seen A Kind of
Loving was a highly creditable
directorial debut for John
Schlesinger and served as well to
introduce the remarkable Alan
Bates to the screen. Interestingly,
this love story set in the British
working class remains
Schlesinger's most sensitive film
and even today, the director
acknowledges it as perhaps his
favorite and closely felt work.
Somehow, it shows. At Tresidder
on Friday at 7, 8 and 9.
Orpheus is Jean Cocteau's
masterpiece in the cinema and
film was but one of the many arts
Cocteau dabbled and succeeded
in. In this picture the director

dwelt on two themes which
obsessed him throughout his
career —the ancient legend of
Orpheus and the concept of the
poet in society—within the
framework of a mystical poem
concerning death. On Friday at 7
and 9:30 in Cubberley.
Subterranean Series
Starting off a Friday series of
underground films in Geology 320
at 11 p.m. are Jean Vigo's
celebrated short, "A Propos de
Nice," Bruce Baillie's "Mass for
the Dakota Sioux," the great
Rene Clair's "Entr'Acte," Jonas
Mekas' "Notes on the Circus,"
Shriley Clarke's "The Bridges Go
Round," James Broughton's
"Looney Tom the Happy Lover,"
and "Night on Bald Mountain."
While a small but vocal
following of cultists seems willing
to praise practically anything
Joseph Losey does, Accident is
one of his few films to attain
widespread praise. With the
considerable assistance of
scenarist Harold Pinter, the
director creates an intriguing
atmosphere of sexual ambiguity in
this picture and draws superb
performances from Dirk Bogarde,
Stanley Baker, Michael York,
Vivien Merchant, Delphine Seyrig
and, in a cameo, Pinter himself.
At Tresidder on Saturday.
First Japanese Flick
The first in a Saturday series of
Japanese films is Akira
Kurosawa's Ikiru (To Live),

showing in Cubberley at 7:30 and
10. This may be the director's
most personal and humanistic film
and movingly displays a
condemned man's search for
meaning in his life. A recipiant of
numerous awards, the picture
stays in the memory long after
viewing it.
The conclusion of Rosemary's

Haby left me with a most
unpleasant aftertaste and made
me wonder to what end Polanski
had put all his sly direction.
Judging from its box office
receipts, however, most people
were not disappointed and those
who want to catch it again can see
it at the Sunday Flicks in Mem
Aud.


SUPERB PERFORMANCE—Dirk Bogarde is starred in Joseph Losey's
ACCIDENT. The film, written by Harold Pinter, will be shown at Tresidder on
Saturday.

here.
Eclipse has been the subject of
vehement arguments among
critics, some finding it a deeply
meaningful expression of
contemporary alienation and
others finding it a singularly
dismal experience. Undoubtedly,
anyone interested in Antonioni
will consider his 1961 film
mandatory viewing. At Tresidder
on Wednesday.
Vampyr on Tuesday
Carl Dreyer's Vampyr has
taken its place in film history as
one of the few films roughly
described as vampire movies to
transcent the genre and invoke
genuine horror. At the same time,
the Danish director's film seems
somewhat silly and inordinately

slow today. But, as Dreyer himself
has stated in response to this
criticism, "The rhythm of a film
depends on the rhythm of milieu
and epoch." This 1931
production, admittedly filled with
some astonishing visual effects,
will be shown on Thursday at
7:45 in Cubberley by the
International Association.
Racial attitudes have greatly
changed since A Raisin in the Sun
was released in 1961, but the fine
humor and humanistic qualities of
Lorraine Hansberry's play have
remained engaging constants over
the years. Really not much as film
but the performances of Sidney
Poitier, Claudia McNeill, Ruby
Dee, Diana Sands and Ivon Dixon
are uniformly excellent. In Bishop
Auditorium at 7 and 9:30 on
Thursday.
Schlosinger and Bates
The seldom-seen A Kind of
Loving was a highly creditable
directorial debut for John
Schlesinger and served as well to
introduce the remarkable Alan
Bates to the screen. Interestingly,
this love story set in the British
working class remains
Schlesinger's most sensitive film
and even today, the director
acknowledges it as perhaps his
favorite and closely felt work.
Somehow, it shows. At Tresidder
on Friday at 7, 8 and 9.
Orpheus is Jean Cocteau's
masterpiece in the cinema and
film was but one of the many arts
Cocteau dabbled and succeeded
in. In this picture the director

dwelt on two themes which
obsessed him throughout his
career —the ancient legend of
Orpheus and the concept of the
poet in society—within the
framework of a mystical poem
concerning death. On Friday at 7
and 9:30 in Cubberley.
Subterranean Series
Starting off a Friday series of
underground films in Geology 320
at 11 p.m. are Jean Vigo's
celebrated short, "A Propos de
Nice," Bruce Baillie's "Mass for
the Dakota Sioux," the great
Rene Clair's "Entr'Acte," Jonas
Mekas' "Notes on the Circus,"
Shriley Clarke's "The Bridges Go
Round," James Broughton's
"Looney Tom the Happy Lover,"
and "Night on Bald Mountain."
While a small but vocal
following of cultists seems willing
to praise practically anything
Joseph Losey does, Accident is
one of his few films to attain
widespread praise. With the
considerable assistance of
scenarist Harold Pinter, the
director creates an intriguing
atmosphere of sexual ambiguity in
this picture and draws superb
performances from Dirk Bogarde,
Stanley Baker, Michael York,
Vivien Merchant, Delphine Seyrig
and, in a cameo, Pinter himself.
At Tresidder on Saturday.
First Japanese Flick
The first in a Saturday series of
Japanese films is Akira
Kurosawa's Ikiru (To Live),

showing in Cubberley at 7:30 and
10. This may be the director's
most personal and humanistic film
and movingly displays a
condemned man's search for
meaning in his life. A recipiant of
numerous awards, the picture
stays in the memory long after
viewing it.
The conclusion of Rosemary's

Haby left me with a most
unpleasant aftertaste and made
me wonder to what end Polanski
had put all his sly direction.
Judging from its box office
receipts, however, most people
were not disappointed and those
who want to catch it again can see
it at the Sunday Flicks in Mem
Aud.


SUPERB PERFORMANCE—Dirk Bogarde is starred in Joseph Losey's
ACCIDENT. The film, written by Harold Pinter, will be shown at Tresidder on
Saturday.
This week's films lean heavily
to the somberly dramatic. At the
same time, however, what is close
to the best work of John
Schlesinger, Jean Cocteau, Akira
Kurosawa and Joseph Losey is on
view, as well as films of varying
quality by Antonioni, Roman
Polanski and Jean Vigo.
Clive Miller's Tuesday night
program in Geology 320 starts off
at 8 p.m. with a 30-minute
excerpt from Shipmates Forever,
a 1935 musical with Dick Powell
and Ruby Keeler. Following that
at 8:30 and 10:30 is Bombshell, a
fine 1933 comedy starring Jean
Harlow, who gives what is
probably her best performance in
this picture. Those who are
familiar with Harlow only as a
legend and not as an actress would
do well to be introduced to her
here.

International Association.
Racial attitudes have greatly
changed since A Raisin in the Sun
was released in 1961, but the fine
humor and humanistic qualities of
Lorraine Hansberry's play have
remained engaging constants over
the years. Really not much as film
but the performances of Sidney
Poitier, Claudia McNeill, Ruby
Dee, Diana Sands and Ivon Dixon
are uniformly excellent. In Bishop
Auditorium at 7 and 9:30 on
Thursday.
Schlosinger and Bates
The seldom-seen A Kind of
Loving was a highly creditable
directorial debut for John
Schlesinger and served as well to
introduce the remarkable Alan
Bates to the screen. Interestingly,
this love story set in the British
working class remains
Schlesinger's most sensitive film
and even today, the director
acknowledges it as perhaps his
favorite and closely felt work.
Somehow, it shows. At Tresidder
on Friday at 7, 8 and 9.
Orpheus is Jean Cocteau's
masterpiece in the cinema and
film was but one of the many arts
Cocteau dabbled and succeeded
in. In this picture the director

dwelt on two themes which
obsessed him throughout his
career —the ancient legend of
Orpheus and the concept of the
poet in society—within the
framework of a mystical poem
concerning death. On Friday at 7
and 9:30 in Cubberley.
Subterranean Series
Starting off a Friday series of
underground films in Geology 320
at 11 p.m. are Jean Vigo's
celebrated short, "A Propos de
Nice," Bruce Baillie's "Mass for
the Dakota Sioux," the great
Rene Clair's "Entr'Acte," Jonas
Mekas' "Notes on the Circus,"
Shriley Clarke's "The Bridges Go
Round," James Broughton's
"Looney Tom the Happy Lover,"
and "Night on Bald Mountain."
While a small but vocal
following of cultists seems willing
to praise practically anything
Joseph Losey does, Accident is
one of his few films to attain
widespread praise. With the
considerable assistance of
scenarist Harold Pinter, the
director creates an intriguing
atmosphere of sexual ambiguity in
this picture and draws superb
performances from Dirk Bogarde,
Stanley Baker, Michael York,
Vivien Merchant, Delphine Seyrig
and, in a cameo, Pinter himself.
At Tresidder on Saturday.
First Japanese Flick
The first in a Saturday series of
Japanese films is Akira
Kurosawa's Ikiru (To Live),

showing in Cubberley at 7:30 and
10. This may be the director's
most personal and humanistic film
and movingly displays a
condemned man's search for
meaning in his life. A recipiant of
numerous awards, the picture
stays in the memory long after
viewing it.
The conclusion of Rosemary's

Haby left me with a most
unpleasant aftertaste and made
me wonder to what end Polanski
had put all his sly direction.
Judging from its box office
receipts, however, most people
were not disappointed and those
who want to catch it again can see
it at the Sunday Flicks in Mem
Aud.


SUPERB PERFORMANCE—Dirk Bogarde is starred in Joseph Losey's
ACCIDENT. The film, written by Harold Pinter, will be shown at Tresidder on
Saturday.
This week's films lean heavily
to the somberly dramatic. At the
same time, however, what is close
to the best work of John
Schlesinger, Jean Cocteau, Akira
Kurosawa and Joseph Losey is on
view, as well as films of varying
quality by Antonioni, Roman
Polanski and Jean Vigo.
Clive Miller's Tuesday night
program in Geology 320 starts off
at 8 p.m. with a 30-minute
excerpt from Shipmates Forever,
a 1935 musical with Dick Powell
and Ruby Keeler. Following that
at 8:30 and 10:30 is Bombshell, a
fine 1933 comedy starring Jean
Harlow, who gives what is
probably her best performance in
this picture. Those who are
familiar with Harlow only as a
legend and not as an actress would
do well to be introduced to her
here.
Eclipse has been the subject of
vehement arguments among
critics, some finding it a deeply
meaningful expression of
contemporary alienation and
others finding it a singularly
dismal experience. Undoubtedly,
anyone interested in Antonioni
will consider his 1961 film
mandatory viewing. At Tresidder
on Wednesday.
Vampyr on Tuesday
Carl Dreyer's Vampyr has
taken its place in film history as
one of the few films roughly
described as vampire movies to
transcent the genre and invoke
genuine horror. At the same time,
the Danish director's film seems
somewhat silly and inordinately

slow today. But, as Dreyer himself
has stated in response to this
criticism, "The rhythm of a film
depends on the rhythm of milieu
and epoch." This 1931
production, admittedly filled with
some astonishing visual effects,
will be shown on Thursday at
7:45 in Cubberley by the
International Association.
