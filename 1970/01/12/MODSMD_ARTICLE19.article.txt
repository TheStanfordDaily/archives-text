# In Coffee House, At Least
## Wilbur Cuisine Improving 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
"Running a coffee house is
something I've always wanted to
do," says Dave Sklar, a
sophomore and part owner of the
Wilbur Coffee House. Dave admits
that the idea of making some
money also played a role in his
and sophomore John Bodine's
idea to start a coffee house in the
Wilbur complex. But more than
this, says Sklar, "We both felt
there was a need for some place in
Wilbur where students could talk
informally and meet students
from other dormitories."
The coffee house, open for a
term now and located at the
entrance to the Madera dining
room, can certainly boast one of
the more unusual menus in the
Bay Area, with such items as
Luxionkugel, a mixture of
noodles and raisins; blintzes, a
fruit filled pancake; Mewauk
pastries, a type of coffee cake;
and the specialty of the house,
Squishy Princess in Crunchy
Castle, with or without Cloud
(whipped cream),which consists of
cherries and pineapples covered
with a brown sugar crust.
Sandwiches are also served.
Sklar claims that it was his
mother who gave him the idea for
such exotic foods, although it was
a lady he sat next to on an
airplane who suggested coffee
cake. "It was mainly Mom," he
admits shyly. The food, imported
from Oakland every week, is
prepared by Hank Nagel, whom
Sklar claims to be the last
surviving member of the Mewauk
Indian tribe, and who now works
as a cook in the fashionable
Oakland dockyards.

Although well on its way to
success now, the coffee house got
off to a shaky start, lack of capital
being the main problem. As Sklar,
showing his great knowledge of
finance, puts it, "We knew we
were in for trouble when we ran
out of money." It was then that
the services of Allan Wernick,
former ASSU presidential
candidate on the Benevolent
Despot ticket, were acquired, as
Allan became a part owner. "It
was just that we needed the
money," sighs Sklar.
Wernick, as might be expected,
had some comments of his own
on the coffee house, and once
again, as might be expected, these
comments were more politically
oriented than Sklar's. Wernick
sees the Wilbur Coffee House
essentially as a people's response
to the Stanford Coffee House,
which Wernick termed a
"commercialistic, capitalistic
monstrosity." Getting a little
carried away with himself,
Wernick closed his comments with
a cry of, "Coffee to the People!"
John Bodine admits that one of
the goals of the coffee house is to
eventually serve free coffee some
day, but just when depends on
business.
A large part of the coffee
house is also entertainment,
especially on the weekends.
Wernick, in a more serious vein,
feels that what had been needed
was a place where amateur
musicians might perform, and that
the coffee house is just such a
place. The coffee house has had
many amateur performances
ranging from jazz and rock to
folk.

However, the most important
aspect of the coffee house, Sklar
feels, is still to provide a place for
freshmen to meet and talk
informally. "We want everyone to
feel at home and welcome, that is,
a sense of belonging or relatedness
to the coffee house, as opposed to
a coffee house where you merely
go and eat."
