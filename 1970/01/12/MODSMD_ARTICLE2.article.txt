# Grass Roots March
## 
### 
Grass Roots, a radical
conservation group, plans a march
and rally today to demonstrate
against the multi-million dollar
Dillingham financial center. Led
by their red-tuniced "Hard Fife
and Drum Core," Grass Roots and
its student and community
supporters will march at three this
afternoon one-half mile on El
Camino Real, from Stanford
Avenue to Page Mill Road.
Grass Roots claims that the
$12 million Dillingham
development, to be called "Palo
Alto Square," would significantly
worsen two pressing problems in
the midpeninsula: housing and
ecology.
The two 10-story office lowers
and the 17-story hotel*convention
center would bring in 1,500
employees, according to
architect's estimates.
Increases Problems —
Their housing needs would bt>
added to the extremely tight
mid-peoinsula housing market,
which been particularly hard
on Japwn people and
other groups. The
DillingharoV'pfojecl would also
pave acres for a parking

lot generating 8300 more
automobile trips per day,
according to a city traffic study
The smoggy Bay Area can't
absorb this pollution, says Grass
Roots.
The purpose of the
demonstration is to publicize
these problems, and to, bring
pressure against the University not
to sign the lease for the property.
Grass Roots believes that the
Dillingham project is an important
link in a whole chain of industrial,
office and road developments
around Stanford land that are
designed to serve the interests of
corporations that specialize in
military-related production and
research. Directors of these
corporations tend to dominate the
Stanford Board of Trustees. Grass
Roots further charges people who
live or work in the area have
systematically been denied an
opportunity to control land use.
The organization plans to huild
alliance with community groups
throughout the area to halt the
exploitation of the land for
private profit. One of the group's
slogans is "House People, Not
Profits."
