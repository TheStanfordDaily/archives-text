# Pre-Reg Commission Seeks New Chairman
## 
### 
The ASSU Pre-Registration
Commission has begun to plan
next Fall's Pre-Reg Week to
welcome and orient Stanford's
new students. The leaders of this
past Fall's Pre-Reg are now
accepting applications from any
undergraduate interested in
serving as Chairman or
Vice-Chairman for next Fall.
Application forms are available in
the ASSU office and should be
completed and returned before
Friday, January 16.
An applicant wishing to discuss
the responsibilities, duties,
dangers and pleasures of chairing
Pre-Reg may contact either of this

year's leaders, Renton Rolph or
Stephen Otto.
Assuming a leadership position
in Pre-Reg at the present time will
afford a wide range of planning
discretion to the new Chairman.
Working with the Pre-Reg
Planning Committee, composed of
faculty, students and Dean of
Students representatives, a
vigorous Pre-Reg Chairman can
derive great satisfaction from a
close association with the diverse
groups and individuals concerned
with new student orientation.
Also, although the University is in
a period of financial stress, there
is the possibility of a full-time job
next summer for the Chairman.
