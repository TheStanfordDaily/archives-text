# Asian-American Group Initiates New Courses
## 
### 
Although its organization is
still unsettled, the Asian American
Student Alliance (AASA) has
already initiated new projects and
courses at Stanford.
AASA has formed two
undergraduate specials for winter
quarter, one dealing with
community action, the other a
SWOPSI course on the relocation
of Japanese Americans during
World War 11. The latter will
investigate the resources of
Hoover tower dealing with the
subject. Both are open to any
interested person.
Developing a bibliography of
material on Asian Americans
available in Stanford libraries is
another AASA project. Along
with this will go an investigation
of conditions such as education,
jobs, land ownership, and drug
usage in Asian American
communities like in Mountain
View.
Tutoring in Mountain View is
also being done by AASA with the
help of several non-Asians. There
they help immigrants, many from
South America, improve their
English.
Through tutoring and other
projects, AASA hopes to involve
itself in community action and to
give people an idea of Asian
American pride.
The budget which AASA must
soon present to the Student
Senate for approval or revision is
still uncertain, but will be finished
this week.
The budget proposed by the
steering committee of AASA asks
for $4800, the majority to be
used for cultural activities, ethnic
studies, and tutoring. Some of it
will also go to completing and
stocking the new AASA office at
544 Alvarado.
At the meeting last Saturday,
AASA members discussed the
organization and purpose of the
group. They decided to form a
steering committee composed of
committee chairmen and also
giving an equal vote to each
member who attends the steering
committee meetings.

This committee will be the
chief executive body, but will
leave major decisions up to the
group as a whole. No constitution
has yet been written.
Whether AASA should form a
common ground for all interested
Asian Americans at Stanford, or
whether it should be a diverse
group providing for varying
interests was another question
discussed, but not decided.
The AASA members interested
in the budget met yesterday to
work on the budget, and it will be
approved by the group in a
meeting on Tuesday.
