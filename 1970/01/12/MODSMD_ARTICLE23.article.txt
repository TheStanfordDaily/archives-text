# Succeeding FBI ’s Hoover? Belmont Denies Speculations
## 
### LFO M NICHOLAS 
Alan H. Belmont, a former FBI
official now employed here as
associate director of the Hoover
Institution, has dismissed as
"groundless speculation" recent
newspaper reports that he is
considered a likely choice to
replace J. Edgar Hoover.
"Such talk isn't new," Belmont
told the I>ail v. "Last March a
similar rumor appeared in'T.S.
News and World Report' and
alleged that my appointment was
imminent."
However, Belmont declined
any speculation of his own,

including his availability lor the
job and other possible nominees
should Hoover decide to step
down. But he stoutly defended his
former chief as a man of "high
conviction" who "stood up
against terrific odds to build a
first-rate Bureau."
Stories appearing last week in
the I.<>> \ngeles limes and St.
Louis (■ lo be-I) em ocra t placed
Belmont at the top of a five-man
list of possible successors to
Hoover. Other mentioned were
Supreme Court Justice Byron
White, John E. Ingersoll, director
of the Bureau of Narcotics and

Dangerous Drugs; Charles H.
Rogovin, administrator of the
Law Enforcement Assistance
Administration; and Lawrence E.
Walsh, former deputy negotiator
at the Paris Peace Talks.
Hoover turned 75 last Sunday
amid mounting expectations that
his 15-year tenure in Washington
may at last be approaching an
end. Official word is that Hoover
is in excellent health and welcome
to stay as long as he likes, but
public appearances have grown
rare while FBI leadership remains
as autocratic as ever. Critics of
Hoover allege that no healthy
arguments exist within the bureau
of the kind that produce wise
decisions elsewhere in
government. Supposedly, this has
motivated some outstanding men
to seek careers in other agencies.
Belmont disagrees. "I'm in his
(Hoover's) corner all the way," he
ways.
By its very nature, Belmont
argues, an organization concerned
with direct law enforcement needs
tight discipline for effectiveness.
As for charges of anacronism, he
responded "If you really examine
the record, you'll see that the
Bureau has always been far ahead
of its time in anticipating and
planning for new trends in law
en forcement."
Just what kind of man should
lead the PBI after Hoover steps
down?
"Certainly, he should have
been intimately acquainted with
he Bureau and its operations,"
tMmont says. "Like Hoover, he
must have sufficient strength of
character to keep the FBI above
partisan politics." He thinks the
chances are "very good" that
President Nixon will appoint such
a man. "The people have a high
regard for the Bureau," Belmont
explained, "and they can
rightfully expect the appointment
of a man who can maintain that
esteem."
