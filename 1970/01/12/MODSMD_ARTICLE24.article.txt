## 
### 
James H. Smith, professor by
courtesy at Stanford University,
died Thursday at Stanford
University Hospital. He was 74.
Smith was internationally
known for his discovery of the
way chlorophyll is formed. In
1927 he joined the Carnegie
Institution Department of Plant
Biology and then traveled to
Europe to learn of new techniques
in microchemist r y be in g
developed by Professor Frit/. Pregl
in Graz, Austria, and new
techniques in photochemistry
used by Professor Victor Henri in
Zurich.
Applying these new chemical
procedures, unknown at this time
in America, he discovered the way
chlorophyll is formed.
Smith graduated from
Monmouth College in Illinois and
took some graduate work at
Harvard University before the
outbreak of World War I.
He served in the Chemical
Warfare service and later in the
U.S. Public Health Service while
he served in the Army during the
war.
Smith received his doctorate
from the University of Chicago in
