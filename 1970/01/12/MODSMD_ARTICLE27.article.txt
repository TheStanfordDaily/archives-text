# Lawsuit 'Fatally Defective'
## University Rejects Charges 
### 
A lawsuit charging Stanford
and the City of Palo Alto with
procedural irregularities and two
city councilmen with conflicts of
interest in the development of
Stanford lands around Coyote Hill
is "fatally defective" in many
respects, the University has
replied.
In a brief filed January 6 with
the Santa Clara County Superior
Court, Stanford legal
representatives state that the
Committee for Green Foothills
and four individuals have failed to
prove their case of improper
actions.
The brief points out that the
plaintiffs' complaint shows that
Stanford and the City complied
with all provisions of the law in
proceeding with the development,
that Councilmen Frank Gallagher
and Jack R. Wheatley were not in
conflict of interest in voting in
favor of development, that the
plaintiffs can show no invasion of
their legally protected interests,
and that in any event the facts
pleaded do not state a case for
action against the University or
the City.
"This is a strike suit," the brief
concludes. "It is intended only to
prevent construction of
improvements on Coyte Hill.
Unlike the ordinary action, so
long as the Complaint here is
permitted to remain on files it has
the effect the plaintiffs want — no
lessee or lender feels he can
proceed to improve the property
without risk.
"For the reasons set forth
above, the complaint is fatally
defective. Its existence for just
over a month has already caused
Stanford, its tenants and
prospective tenants, their lenders,
the City, and responsible City
officials serious difficulties. The
complaint should be thrown out

— where it belongs — for good and
all . . ."
The suit against the University
and the City challenged the way
in which Stanford gained city
approval to divide 175 acres
around the Hill for leasing. It
contended that when the
University applied to divide the
property into four parcels, it
intended to later subdivide the
property into other parcels. This
was done, the plaintiffs charged,
to avoid various legal restrictions.
The Stanford legal counsel,
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &
Enersen of San Francisco, replied
that before taking any actions the
University secured full and proper
City approval, as shown in the
complaint itself. The laws are
designed to prevent subdivision
without approval, and the
plaintiffs fail to show that this
was done, the brief said.
"Total compliance with land
division mapping requirements
should not be turned into total
non-compliance. If the Committee
(for Green Foothills) is right, the
whole statutory scheme of
simplified approval procedures for
certain types of divisions is
absolutely ineffective. Any
redivision would call every
original division into question . . .
There is no authority for the
proposition that following the
statutory procedures for
redivision makes a division
originally approved illegal."
"The Committee pleads, but,
in making its charges, ignores, the
key point — Stanford, the City
and the City officials operated
throughout in accordance with
the applicable law, and Stanford
applied for, and the City granted,
approvals in accordance with the
Act and Ordinances . . . Palo Alto
approved Standord's redivisions
after Stanford followed the most

rigorous procedures it could be
required to follow."
"The Committee alleges
nothing more than that Stanford
has followed the law at every
stage of the proceedings. That is
not a cause of action."
As for the charge that Mr.
Gallagher, a Stanford employee,
and Mr. Wheatley, a contractor
who stated that he expected to
bid on Coyote Hill projects, were
in conflict of interest, the brief
replied that neither was in conflict
under California law.
One California statute deals
with the interests of public
officials in public contracts; no
public contract is involved. The
second statute relates only to
direct financial interests of
officials. The Stanford brief states
that neither defendant
councilman is alleged to have a
direct financial interest in the
Coyote Hill property. Even if a
council member does have a direct
financial interest, however, his
vote is not improper so long as he
has disclosed that interest.
Before voting on September 8
in favor of Stanford land
development plans, both
councilmen disclosed their
relationship to the issue and
stated that they had been advised
by the City Attorney that they
were not in conflict of interest.
The brief points out that the
four individuals named as
plaintiffs — Mildred S. Justesen,
Judith Dean Yarborough, George
Cowie, and Osman C. Fox — were
never identified or otherwise
mentioned, and did not sign the
complaint.
In any event, none of the
individuals, nor the Committee,
show that any of their legal rights
have been invaded, the brief
states. Nor does the Committee
allege that it is a City taxpayer, or
that it represents the City's
taxpayers.
