# Huskies Grab Overtime Win
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's basketball team
opened its Pac-8 season Saturday
night in Seatle with a
heatbreaking 76-73 overtime loss
to Washington. The Indians, who
trailed throughout most of the
game finally closed the gap and
tied the game with seven seconds
left at 69-69 on a basket by Fred
Green. Stanford quickly fell
behind in the overtime and never
caught the Huskies.
The Tribe started out the night
shooting coldly and quickly fell
behind 13-3. The Indians were
plagued by poor shooting and
numerous turnovers for much of
the first half, as the Huskies
maintained a lead in the nine to
13 point range. Paced by the
shooting of guards Dennis O'Neill
and Claude Terry, the Tribe
fought back and cut the lead to
36-29 at halftime. O'Neill and
Terry accounted for seventeen of
the Indians' first half points.
Stanford finally cut the lead to
five at the start of the second half,
but Washington maintained a six
to ten point margin.
Eventually the Cards picked up
some momentum, and field goals
by Terry and O'Neill cut the lead
to four at 55-51. The Indians
stayed close and with less than
two minutes left they trailed by
only 66-63.
Green Unbelievable
A pair of free throws by
Washington guard Dave
Willenborg gave the Huskies a
68-63 advantage, but Green cut it
to three with 45 seconds left.
Center Bill Palmer scored with 20
seconds left to make it 68-67.
After a free throw by Willenborg,
the Indians got the ball back with
14 seconds to go, trailing 69-67.
Green, who played one of the
finest games of his career, drove
all the way for an unbelievable
layup with seven seconds left to
make it 69-69 and force the
overtime.

In the overtime period, the
Tribe quickly fell behind 73-69 on
four points by forward George
Irvine, who ended up with 22
points. The Indians cut it to 74-73
on baskets by O'Neill and Terry.
Palmer then missed a crucial first
shot of a one and one with less
than two minutes remaining and
the Huskies got the ball back.
Washington stalled until 17
seconds were left when Terry
fouled Willenborg, who hit the
first free throw for a 75-73 lead.
He missed the second shot, but
Washington got the rebound and
Willenborg hit another free throw
to make it 76-73. Green tried to
go for a three point play but he
got called for an offensive foul as
the game ended.
The Indians were led by Terry
who picked up 19, while O'Neill
and Green both added 17. Pacing
the Huskies were their two fine
forwards Irvine and Woolcock
who both scored 22 points.
Center Jay Bond added 13.
Fouls Tell Again
Stanford outshot Washington
from the floor, 46.2 to 41.2
percent. The Indians also
rebounded well as they were
out rebounded by only one, 48 to
47. But as has been the story so
often this year, Stanford picked
up two more field goals, losing
the game at the free throw line.
