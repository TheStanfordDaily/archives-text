Despite gloomy skies, the
Stanford swimming team opened
their home season Saturday on a
bright note as they downed Santa
Clara Swin Club and Foothill
Aquatic Club in the Stanford
Invitational Relays.
Tribe swimmers set two meet
records and recorded some
life-time bests as they won seven
of the eleven events and grabbed
second places in the other four.
Santa Clara finished second in the
meet with the JV Stanford team
third and Foothill fourth. And for
the first time in four years the
opening day crowd didn't have to
sit in the rain.
Coach Jim Gaughran of
Stanford termed the meet a "good
start" and said he was especially
pleased with the fine times by
some of the freshmen. Bob
Warren, a frosh from Hawaii,
swam two life-time bests as he
recorded a 21.9 in anchoring the
200 medly relay and a 49.7
swimming on the JV 400 freestyle
team.
Meet Record
The afternoon began
interestingly enough when the
Indians set a new meet record of
1.26.9 in the 200 freestyle relay
with Rick Eagleston, Bob
Jamison, Bob Bebb, and Steve
Carey clinching it.
The tribe captured the first
four events before Santa Clara
finally broke the ice with a
victory in the 300 backstroke
relay. Santa Clara also won the
one and three meter diving events
as well as the 400 freestyle relay,
just touching out Stanford by half
a second.
The rest of the meet was all
Stanford. A new meet record was
set in the 300 breaststroke relay
swum by sophomores Dave
Shilling, Jim Morris, and anchored
by freshman Brian Job, last year's
NCAA champion. They coasted in
to better the old mark by 4.6
seconds with a time of 3.02.6.

Shilling set a new varsity record in
that event with 1.00.5 for the first
100 yards.
Captain Haywood
Fred Haywood, who was
elected this year's team captain in
the morning before the meet,
showed the style that enabled him
to win the 100 backstroke in the
NCAA's last year as he anchored
the backstroke relay with a 52.5.
He also led off the 400 medley
relay with a 53.5.
Joining Haywood on probably
the best medley relay team in the
country are Job, Carey, and John
Ferris, another NCAA champion.
This relay team is expected to be
the rallying point for the entire
team throughout the season.
The two juniors, Haywood and
Ferris, were on last year's team
that was touched out by Indiana
in the national meet. Saturday's
time of 3.32.4 was more than four
seconds faster than any other time
recorded so far this season in the
country.
Stanford divers grabbed both
second places as Ted Nichols
coupled with Fred Bachman and
Ed Lederman to perform well.

Next week the tribe swimmers
take on a good Washington State
team at the Encina pool. Coach
Gaughran expects it to be a
"tough meet" as WSU has a strong
team, particularly in the distance
events. They also sport a great
b reaststroker and a fine
backstroker.
The relays gave people an
opportunity to witness Stanford's
depth. The next few weeks of dual
meet competition could illustrate
its outstanding individual
personnel in every event.
FINAL SCORE: S.U. 86, SCSC
