# Board To Consider BYU Ban Amidst Latest Alumni Protest
## 
### JOHN BOWEN 
A new alumni blast and an
official reaffirmation of policy
from the Mormon church have
contributed to mounting
dissatisfaction with President
Pitzer's decision to refrain from
scheduling any future athletic
contests with Brigham Young
University. Tomorrow's meeting
of the Board of Trustees will
include a report from Pitzer on
the issue and could result in either
an affirmation or overruling of the
President's stand.
Stanford alumnus Dudley
Swim, a former president of the
Alumni Association, accused the
university of "discrimination on
the grounds of religion" in a letter
to the Board of Trustees.
BYU Respectable
Swim then suggested that
Stanford should be "learning"
from BYU, contending that:
"At BYU, unlike so many
schools, happily campus life does
not embrace chainwalking to far
left bigotry, homage to alien
ideologies, disrespect for the
American flag, arrogant,
traitorous flaunting of enemy
flags, championing of drug use,
dedication to debauchery, and
physical violence threatened or in

fact—whether it be hoodlumism
(such as raiding Trustees' meeting)
or murder."
Few Complaints
In response to Swim's blast,
the current president of the
Alumni Association, Robert
Levisan, Jr., expressed
"disappointment that (he) chose
to use the press," over and above
registering his opinion with the
Trustees.
Levison reminded the Daily
that no official position has yet
been taken on the question by his
organization, but that he
personally had heard from "only
very few alumni who were
disappointed with the decision
itself." He did, however,
acknowledge that the decision
may have the effect of reducing
contributions from some alumni,
although "not any more than SRI,
or any other issue."
The Trustees have received
"several hundred letters" relating
to the issue, according to
Vice-President and Provost
Richard W. Lyman. Lyman
estimated, however, that the
newly initiated policy is "not
likely to change."
President Kenneth Pitzer
described the balance of mail
coming to his office as
"favorable."
Mormon Doctrine
The second major development
over the weekend was the release
to the public of a statement by
the Presidency of the Mormon
Church reaffirming the portion of
church doctrine in question.
The doctrine excludes Negroes
from the priesthood, thus,
according to Mormon theology,
denying to them the attainment
of the highest of three heavens in
the next life.
In part, the church letter,
dated Dec. 15, said:
"We believe the Negro, as well
as those of other races, should
have his full constitutional
privileges as a member of society
and we hope that members of the
church everywhere will do their
part as citizens to see that these
rights are held inviolate.
"Each citizen must have equal
protection and opportunities
under the law with reference to
civil rights. However, matters of
faith, conscience and theology are
not within the purview of civil
law.
Inability to Change
"Were we the leaders of an
enterprise created by ourselves
and operated only according to
our own earthly wisdom, it would
be a simple thing to act according
to popular will, but we believe
this work is directed by God and
that the conferring of the
priesthood must await His
revelation . . .
"Some time at God's eternal
plan the Negro will be given the
right to hold the priesthood . . ."

The President of the Mormon,
David McKay, said several years
ago that the ban derived from a
paragraph in the book of
Abraham which pronounced the
Egyptian pharoah as
"cursed ... as pertaining to the
priesthood." Those of African
descent, therefore, suffer this
"curse."
President Pitzer's decision of
last November 12th was based on
a recommendation by the
Stanford Human Relations
Commission.
No Coercion
Both Pitzer and Lyman
emphasized that the purpose of
the ban was not to attempt to
change the Mormon doctrine, but
simply to make certain individuals
more "comfortable." Lyman
compared athletic relations to
social relations, saying that
"people are made uncomfortable
by competing with BYU; that's
reason enough (for the ban)."
Pitzer's comment was that
"Stanford's business is to schedule
basketball games—not to coerce
anyone."
Recent attacks on Pitzer's
decision have noted a possible
inconsistency in his actions.
Banning athletic contests with
BYU without taking a similar
stand with regard to other
institutions that similarly practice
discrimination, some observers
claim, places the university in a
"hypocriticil" position.
Hypocrisy?
For example, institutions
sponsored by the Methodist
church, such as USC, should be
excluded from such competition,
according to some, because the
Methodist church maintains a
segregated denomination, the
African Methodist Episcopalian
Church.

Similarly, they claim that
Jewish institutions should also be
excluded, if the University is to
remain consistent in its policies,
because the Jewish religion frowns
on racially mixed marriages and
forbids women to become rabbis
(discrimination on the basis of
sex).
When asked for comment on
these questions, President Pitzer
replied that he could see "no
similarity" with the BYU
situation, and that what the
Methodists might do "in certain
areas" would not affect the
campus of the universities in
question. The President was then
unable to suggest any ways in
which the Mormon policy
affected the BYU campus, but
rather said that he would stand on
his earlier statement.
Contradictions
A major "communication gap"
seems to exist between Pitzer and
those objecting to his decision.
While the President disclaims any
intention to "reform" BYU, his
major detractors have seized upon
just that intent.
For example, in a letter to the
Daily last week, Reed Watkins,
Stanford Law School graduate
and attorney in Salt Lake City,
thought it "pointless to
discriminate against Brigham
Young University (since) its
students and faculty can't change
the theology of the LDS church,"
a point made by the Church in
their letter printed above.
However, in a seemingly
contradictory statement, the First
Counselor to the President of the
LDS Church, Hugh B. Brown,
indicated that Negro admission to
the Mormon priesthood would
come about "in the ordinary
evolution of things as we go along,
since human rights are basic to the
church."
A new alumni blast and an
official reaffirmation of policy
from the Mormon church have
contributed to mounting
dissatisfaction with President
Pitzer's decision to refrain from
scheduling any future athletic
contests with Brigham Young
University. Tomorrow's meeting

LDS Church, Hugh B. Brown,
indicated that Negro admission to
the Mormon priesthood would
come about "in the ordinary
evolution of things as we go along,
since human rights are basic to the
church."
A new alumni blast and an
official reaffirmation of policy
from the Mormon church have
contributed to mounting
dissatisfaction with President
Pitzer's decision to refrain from
scheduling any future athletic
contests with Brigham Young
University. Tomorrow's meeting
of the Board of Trustees will
include a report from Pitzer on
the issue and could result in either
an affirmation or overruling of the
President's stand.
Stanford alumnus Dudley
Swim, a former president of the
Alumni Association, accused the
university of "discrimination on
the grounds of religion" in a letter
to the Board of Trustees.
BYU Respectable
Swim then suggested that
Stanford should be "learning"
from BYU, contending that:
"At BYU, unlike so many
schools, happily campus life does
not embrace chainwalking to far
left bigotry, homage to alien
ideologies, disrespect for the
American flag, arrogant,
traitorous flaunting of enemy
flags, championing of drug use,
dedication to debauchery, and
physical violence threatened or in

fact—whether it be hoodlumism
(such as raiding Trustees' meeting)
or murder."
Few Complaints
In response to Swim's blast,
the current president of the
Alumni Association, Robert
Levisan, Jr., expressed
"disappointment that (he) chose
to use the press," over and above
registering his opinion with the
Trustees.
Levison reminded the Daily
that no official position has yet
been taken on the question by his
organization, but that he
personally had heard from "only
very few alumni who were
disappointed with the decision
itself." He did, however,
acknowledge that the decision
may have the effect of reducing
contributions from some alumni,
although "not any more than SRI,
or any other issue."
The Trustees have received
"several hundred letters" relating
to the issue, according to
Vice-President and Provost
Richard W. Lyman. Lyman
estimated, however, that the
newly initiated policy is "not
likely to change."
President Kenneth Pitzer
described the balance of mail
coming to his office as
"favorable."
Mormon Doctrine
The second major development
over the weekend was the release
to the public of a statement by
the Presidency of the Mormon
Church reaffirming the portion of
church doctrine in question.
The doctrine excludes Negroes
from the priesthood, thus,
according to Mormon theology,
denying to them the attainment
of the highest of three heavens in
the next life.
In part, the church letter,
dated Dec. 15, said:
"We believe the Negro, as well
as those of other races, should
have his full constitutional
privileges as a member of society
and we hope that members of the
church everywhere will do their
part as citizens to see that these
rights are held inviolate.
"Each citizen must have equal
protection and opportunities
under the law with reference to
civil rights. However, matters of
faith, conscience and theology are
not within the purview of civil
law.
Inability to Change
"Were we the leaders of an
enterprise created by ourselves
and operated only according to
our own earthly wisdom, it would
be a simple thing to act according
to popular will, but we believe
this work is directed by God and
that the conferring of the
priesthood must await His
revelation . . .
"Some time at God's eternal
plan the Negro will be given the
right to hold the priesthood . . ."

The President of the Mormon,
David McKay, said several years
ago that the ban derived from a
paragraph in the book of
Abraham which pronounced the
Egyptian pharoah as
"cursed ... as pertaining to the
priesthood." Those of African
descent, therefore, suffer this
"curse."
President Pitzer's decision of
last November 12th was based on
a recommendation by the
Stanford Human Relations
Commission.
No Coercion
Both Pitzer and Lyman
emphasized that the purpose of
the ban was not to attempt to
change the Mormon doctrine, but
simply to make certain individuals
more "comfortable." Lyman
compared athletic relations to
social relations, saying that
"people are made uncomfortable
by competing with BYU; that's
reason enough (for the ban)."
Pitzer's comment was that
"Stanford's business is to schedule
basketball games—not to coerce
anyone."
Recent attacks on Pitzer's
decision have noted a possible
inconsistency in his actions.
Banning athletic contests with
BYU without taking a similar
stand with regard to other
institutions that similarly practice
discrimination, some observers
claim, places the university in a
"hypocriticil" position.
Hypocrisy?
For example, institutions
sponsored by the Methodist
church, such as USC, should be
excluded from such competition,
according to some, because the
Methodist church maintains a
segregated denomination, the
African Methodist Episcopalian
Church.

Similarly, they claim that
Jewish institutions should also be
excluded, if the University is to
remain consistent in its policies,
because the Jewish religion frowns
on racially mixed marriages and
forbids women to become rabbis
(discrimination on the basis of
sex).
When asked for comment on
these questions, President Pitzer
replied that he could see "no
similarity" with the BYU
situation, and that what the
Methodists might do "in certain
areas" would not affect the
campus of the universities in
question. The President was then
unable to suggest any ways in
which the Mormon policy
affected the BYU campus, but
rather said that he would stand on
his earlier statement.
Contradictions
A major "communication gap"
seems to exist between Pitzer and
those objecting to his decision.
While the President disclaims any
intention to "reform" BYU, his
major detractors have seized upon
just that intent.
For example, in a letter to the
Daily last week, Reed Watkins,
Stanford Law School graduate
and attorney in Salt Lake City,
thought it "pointless to
discriminate against Brigham
Young University (since) its
students and faculty can't change
the theology of the LDS church,"
a point made by the Church in
their letter printed above.
However, in a seemingly
contradictory statement, the First
Counselor to the President of the
LDS Church, Hugh B. Brown,
indicated that Negro admission to
the Mormon priesthood would
come about "in the ordinary
evolution of things as we go along,

the theology of the LDS church,"
a point made by the Church in
their letter printed above.
However, in a seemingly
contradictory statement, the First
Counselor to the President of the
LDS Church, Hugh B. Brown,
indicated that Negro admission to
the Mormon priesthood would
come about "in the ordinary
evolution of things as we go along,
since human rights are basic to the
church."
A new alumni blast and an
official reaffirmation of policy
from the Mormon church have
contributed to mounting
dissatisfaction with President
Pitzer's decision to refrain from
scheduling any future athletic
contests with Brigham Young
University. Tomorrow's meeting
of the Board of Trustees will
include a report from Pitzer on
the issue and could result in either
an affirmation or overruling of the
President's stand.
Stanford alumnus Dudley
Swim, a former president of the
Alumni Association, accused the
university of "discrimination on
the grounds of religion" in a letter
to the Board of Trustees.
BYU Respectable
Swim then suggested that
Stanford should be "learning"
from BYU, contending that:
"At BYU, unlike so many
schools, happily campus life does
not embrace chainwalking to far
left bigotry, homage to alien
ideologies, disrespect for the
American flag, arrogant,
traitorous flaunting of enemy
flags, championing of drug use,
dedication to debauchery, and
physical violence threatened or in

fact—whether it be hoodlumism
(such as raiding Trustees' meeting)
or murder."
Few Complaints
In response to Swim's blast,
the current president of the
Alumni Association, Robert
Levisan, Jr., expressed
"disappointment that (he) chose
to use the press," over and above
registering his opinion with the
Trustees.
Levison reminded the Daily
that no official position has yet
been taken on the question by his
organization, but that he
personally had heard from "only
very few alumni who were
disappointed with the decision
itself." He did, however,
acknowledge that the decision
may have the effect of reducing
contributions from some alumni,
although "not any more than SRI,
or any other issue."
The Trustees have received
"several hundred letters" relating
to the issue, according to
Vice-President and Provost
Richard W. Lyman. Lyman
estimated, however, that the
newly initiated policy is "not
likely to change."
President Kenneth Pitzer
described the balance of mail
coming to his office as
"favorable."
Mormon Doctrine
The second major development
over the weekend was the release
to the public of a statement by
the Presidency of the Mormon
Church reaffirming the portion of
church doctrine in question.
The doctrine excludes Negroes
from the priesthood, thus,
according to Mormon theology,
denying to them the attainment
of the highest of three heavens in
the next life.
In part, the church letter,
dated Dec. 15, said:
"We believe the Negro, as well
as those of other races, should
have his full constitutional
privileges as a member of society
and we hope that members of the
church everywhere will do their
part as citizens to see that these
rights are held inviolate.
"Each citizen must have equal
protection and opportunities
under the law with reference to
civil rights. However, matters of
faith, conscience and theology are
not within the purview of civil
law.
Inability to Change
"Were we the leaders of an
enterprise created by ourselves
and operated only according to
our own earthly wisdom, it would
be a simple thing to act according
to popular will, but we believe
this work is directed by God and
that the conferring of the
priesthood must await His
revelation . . .
"Some time at God's eternal
plan the Negro will be given the
right to hold the priesthood . . ."

The President of the Mormon,
David McKay, said several years
ago that the ban derived from a
paragraph in the book of
Abraham which pronounced the
Egyptian pharoah as
"cursed ... as pertaining to the
priesthood." Those of African
descent, therefore, suffer this
"curse."
President Pitzer's decision of
last November 12th was based on
a recommendation by the
Stanford Human Relations
Commission.
No Coercion
Both Pitzer and Lyman
emphasized that the purpose of
the ban was not to attempt to
change the Mormon doctrine, but
simply to make certain individuals
more "comfortable." Lyman
compared athletic relations to
social relations, saying that
"people are made uncomfortable
by competing with BYU; that's
reason enough (for the ban)."
Pitzer's comment was that
"Stanford's business is to schedule
basketball games—not to coerce
anyone."
Recent attacks on Pitzer's
decision have noted a possible
inconsistency in his actions.
Banning athletic contests with
BYU without taking a similar
stand with regard to other
institutions that similarly practice
discrimination, some observers
claim, places the university in a
"hypocriticil" position.
Hypocrisy?
For example, institutions
sponsored by the Methodist
church, such as USC, should be
excluded from such competition,
according to some, because the
Methodist church maintains a
segregated denomination, the
African Methodist Episcopalian
Church.

Similarly, they claim that
Jewish institutions should also be
excluded, if the University is to
remain consistent in its policies,
because the Jewish religion frowns
on racially mixed marriages and
forbids women to become rabbis
(discrimination on the basis of
sex).
When asked for comment on
these questions, President Pitzer
replied that he could see "no
similarity" with the BYU
situation, and that what the
Methodists might do "in certain
areas" would not affect the
campus of the universities in
question. The President was then
unable to suggest any ways in
which the Mormon policy
affected the BYU campus, but
rather said that he would stand on
his earlier statement.
Contradictions
A major "communication gap"
seems to exist between Pitzer and
those objecting to his decision.
While the President disclaims any
intention to "reform" BYU, his
major detractors have seized upon
just that intent.
For example, in a letter to the
Daily last week, Reed Watkins,
Stanford Law School graduate
and attorney in Salt Lake City,
thought it "pointless to
discriminate against Brigham
Young University (since) its
students and faculty can't change
the theology of the LDS church,"
a point made by the Church in
their letter printed above.
However, in a seemingly
contradictory statement, the First
Counselor to the President of the
