# Title Bound?
## Sterling Mat Debut 
### BOB TODA 
The Stanford wrestling squad
fought its way to impressive wins
over Cal State, Fullerton, San
Diego State, and UCLA this past
weekend. If this is any indication
of what lies in store, the Indians
have a good chance to challenge
the perennial champions of the
Pac-8, Oregon State.
In the first contest against Cal
State, seven Indian wrestlers had
their baptism into varsity
wrestling. Outstanding
performances were turned in by
Dave Dopolow (118 lbs.), Len
Smith (150 lbs.), Bill Ross (167
lbs.), Terry Crenshaw (177 lbs.),
and Bob Leeper (190 lbs.). The
matmen went on to win 24-12.
Later that night, Stanford
hosted San Diego State and
defeated them 20-13. Fine
performances were once again
turned in by Kopolow, Smith, and
Crenshaw. In addition, Dale Ikeda
(134), Dave Thomas (142), Ray

Williams (190), and Lee Fair
(heavyweight), all wrestled well.
The greatest satisfaction of all,
especially to Coach Dave Reed,
came Saturday night as Stanford
trounced UCLA 25-9. This victory
was a fine example of team effort
as all ten men performed well.
Strategic Move
All of the matches were hard
fought. In a bit of strategy, Bruce
Bell sweated down to 118 lbs.
prior to the meet when it was
learned that UCLA planned to
forfeit that weight class so that
Dave Kopolow could wrestle at
126. The strategy worked as
Kopolow decisioned his man 17-7.
Captain Terry Crenshaw picked
up the only fall of the match
when he pinned Dave Dearborn in
the time of 2:30. Heavyweight
Lee Fair turned in his best match
in defeating his man 7-0. Williams,
Thomas and Smith wrestled
impressively as they both won by
decisions.
With many strong performers,
the Indians are definitely a team
to watch. Next Saturday, the
Stanford wrestlers travel across
the bay to Hayward where they

will take on the University of
Nevada and Cal State Hayward.
The next home meet will be
against the University of
California-Santa Barbara Jan. 24.
Match time at the old pavillion
will be 7:30 p.m. Summaries:
