# Pitzer Critical Of Stress On Students
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
In a rare but non-controversial
session of the Academic Council,
Pres. Kenneth Pitzer criticized
excessive pressure on students
from parents, employers and the
draft to stay in school.
Pitzer reviewed important
developments in undergraduate
and graduate education Friday
before about 100 of the
1000-member group. Faculty
Senate chairman William Clebsch
summarized fall quarter activities
of the smaller faculty
decision-making group, and
revealed it will soon consider the
status of ROTC.

For the first time, Council
members allowed students to
enter Dinkelspiel Auditorium to
report on the proceedings
directly.
The Council voted to permit
Campus Report and the
student-run Daily and KZSU to
cover future meetings first hand.
As in the faculty Senate, they
must report only actions taken,
and cannot quote speakers
directly without their permission.
In an overview of University
problems and accomplishments,
Pitzar criticized "pressure to
continue ciasses without
inteiruption in cace? where a
break for work or other activities
wou-d be best for the individual.
Pratt Pressure
"The pressure on young men
from the draft is most
unfortunate, but it is at least
decreasing, and I hope it may be
eliminated soon.
"But there is also excessive
pressure in many cases from
parents and friends, as well as the
influence of employers demanding
degrees as credentials for
employment," he observed.
"Numerous studies over several
decades have shown that the
principal reason students leave
college is not low grades or bank
balances. It's lack of motivation.
We should make every effort to
reduce those forces which lead a
student who has lost his
motivation to feel he must
continue university study without
interruption," Pitzer said.
ROTC Report
Clebsch said the report from a
special committee studying ROTC
is "responsive to at least three
features of the traditional ROTC
contracts." Its recommendations
will be debated in the faculty
Senate on Jan. 22.
The report found changes
cannot be made in "punitive
clauses" of government contracts
with individual students for
financial aid, Clebsch said. It
recommends credit be given on a
course-by-course, year-by-year
basis as is done for Undergraduate
Specials. Third, it abolishes
faculty rank for ROTC
instructors, but accords them staff
privileges such as library use and
parking.

The Council voted to permit
Campus Report and the
student-run Daily and KZSU to
cover future meetings first hand.
As in the faculty Senate, they
must report only actions taken,
and cannot quote speakers
directly without their permission.
In an overview of University
problems and accomplishments,
Pitzar criticized "pressure to
continue ciasses without
inteiruption in cace? where a
break for work or other activities
wou-d be best for the individual.
Pratt Pressure
"The pressure on young men
from the draft is most
unfortunate, but it is at least
decreasing, and I hope it may be
eliminated soon.
"But there is also excessive
pressure in many cases from
parents and friends, as well as the
influence of employers demanding
degrees as credentials for
employment," he observed.
"Numerous studies over several
decades have shown that the
principal reason students leave
college is not low grades or bank
balances. It's lack of motivation.
We should make every effort to
reduce those forces which lead a
student who has lost his
motivation to feel he must
continue university study without
interruption," Pitzer said.
ROTC Report
Clebsch said the report from a
special committee studying ROTC
is "responsive to at least three
features of the traditional ROTC
contracts." Its recommendations
will be debated in the faculty
Senate on Jan. 22.
The report found changes
cannot be made in "punitive
clauses" of government contracts
with individual students for
financial aid, Clebsch said. It
recommends credit be given on a
course-by-course, year-by-year
basis as is done for Undergraduate
Specials. Third, it abolishes
faculty rank for ROTC
instructors, but accords them staff
privileges such as library use and
parking.
