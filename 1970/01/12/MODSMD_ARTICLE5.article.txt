# Daily Eats

### 
An unusually delectable Daily
staff luncheon will be held
Tuesday at noontime. We thought
we'd change the date in order to
emphasize the unheard of
goodness and bountifulness of this
exclusive, catered event.
Naturally, all Daily staffers, old
and new, are invited, as well as
anyone else interested in good
conversation, better munchies and
out.stnndinp journalism criticism.
