# Corridors, Even
## Flo Mo, Toyon Go Coed 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
With much clatter and bustle,
Loro and Paloma, two Florence
Moore dormitories, merged to
become two co-ed houses on
Saturday. At the same time, six
girls on one floor in Toyon moved
down the hall, into an adjacent
all-male corridor.
The okay for the Toyon move
came from the Dean of Students
office simultaneously with the
Florence Moore decision. "It was
apprently tied to the Florence
Moore decision," said Paul

MacGregor, the director of
Toyon.
Dean of Students Peter
Bulkeley commented that "the
two situations are separable, and
defendably so, but if you try to
do one thing in one place, you
have to take the entire context of
the residence system under
consideration."
Less Reason to 'Nix'
"Given the sense of the
Florence Moore decision," he
added, "there was less reason to
say no (to Toyon)."

Toyon residents decided on
their move about two weeks
before the end of last quarter. At
that time, according to
MacGregor, the Dean of Students
office was notified. It was not
until this week, however, that
final okay was received from the
Dean's office.
"A lot of people were upset at
the length of time the decision
took," said MacGregor, "But
they're happy now."
Rising early on Saturday
morning, residents of the two
Florence Moore dormitories
started their move. "There were
100 people walking back and
forth," one Loro resident
commented. "There was a
tremendous amount to be moved.
Closer Together
"The move has probably pulled
us closer together than anything
else," the freshman added. "It was
a hassle, but it was great."
Some of the students started
repainting their rooms even before
the confusion of the move
subsided. Hastily-rolled posters
were unrolled and plastered on
new walls even before the walls
had dried.
In high spirits since the
rescinding of the original veto on
the move, residents of the two
dormitories seemed to be calmer,
yet still quietly elated after the
move.
A prominent reason for the
original veto was apparently that
the University had sent the Board
of Trustees a letter soon after
they had decided to allow male
dormitories in Florence Moore,
stating that the residences would
remain segregated.

residents, explaining the reasons

us closer together than anything
else," the freshman added. "It was
a hassle, but it was great."
Some of the students started
repainting their rooms even before
the confusion of the move
subsided. Hastily-rolled posters
were unrolled and plastered on
new walls even before the walls
had dried.
In high spirits since the
rescinding of the original veto on
the move, residents of the two
dormitories seemed to be calmer,
yet still quietly elated after the
move.
A prominent reason for the
original veto was apparently that
the University had sent the Board
of Trustees a letter soon after
they had decided to allow male
dormitories in Florence Moore,
stating that the residences would
remain segregated.

parents of Florence Moore
residents, explaining the reasons
for the move (outlined in Friday's
Dnilv ) is now in the mail


SI IK'S ABOI'T A MOVER—Two former Paloina-itea help out with The Great
Mov«- in Florence Moore last Saturday. I,oro an<l Paloma now each have one
floor of men and one of women.
With much clatter and bustle,
Loro and Paloma, two Florence
Moore dormitories, merged to
become two co-ed houses on
Saturday. At the same time, six
girls on one floor in Toyon moved
down the hall, into an adjacent
all-male corridor.
The okay for the Toyon move
came from the Dean of Students
office simultaneously with the
Florence Moore decision. "It was
apprently tied to the Florence
Moore decision," said Paul

MacGregor, the director of
Toyon.
Dean of Students Peter
Bulkeley commented that "the
two situations are separable, and
defendably so, but if you try to
do one thing in one place, you
have to take the entire context of
the residence system under
consideration."
Less Reason to 'Nix'
"Given the sense of the
Florence Moore decision," he
added, "there was less reason to
say no (to Toyon)."

Toyon residents decided on
their move about two weeks
before the end of last quarter. At
that time, according to
MacGregor, the Dean of Students
office was notified. It was not
until this week, however, that
final okay was received from the
Dean's office.
"A lot of people were upset at
the length of time the decision
took," said MacGregor, "But
they're happy now."
Rising early on Saturday
morning, residents of the two
Florence Moore dormitories
started their move. "There were
100 people walking back and
forth," one Loro resident
commented. "There was a
tremendous amount to be moved.
Closer Together
"The move has probably pulled
us closer together than anything
else," the freshman added. "It was
a hassle, but it was great."
Some of the students started
repainting their rooms even before
the confusion of the move
subsided. Hastily-rolled posters
were unrolled and plastered on
