# Braunstein
## 
### 
It is a moderately edifying experience to
watch the current struggle between the
Administration and the student Senate over
the appointment of Yale Braunstein to the
trustee committee on finance. The
Administration tells us that we are dealing
with a judicial issue because Braunstein is
on a probation which forbids his
appointment to a committee which is
appointed by the President or other
university officials. His probation contains
this condition becuse of the thoughtless
nature of the offense of which he was
convicted. The Senate replies that the issue
is one of the validity of the ASSU
Constitution: specifically those sections
guaranteeing the rights of students to serve
on committees and the section dealing with
judicial procedures.
The right to apply for committees is
explicitly guaranteed by the Constitution
(Article 11, section 8, part D) the
Administration contends that this does not
guarantee Braunstein's right to serve on a
committee. Two things are obvious: first
that the rights guaranteed are rights granted
by the President and the trustees, which
means that they should not be abrogated
by the President of the University, except
in an extreme emergency. Second, the
Administration's assertion that the right to
apply does not imply the right to serve is
obviously balderdash, for the right to apply
has no meaning at all unless the right to
serve is also guaranteed.
President Pitzer claims that he is
upholding the campus judicial system by

refusing Braunstein for the committee post.
The Daily most certainly agrees that the
judicial system is a good one and deserves
support. But it is certainly unclear which is
superior: the Constitution or the Judicial
Charter. We also feel that system should be
flexible. The decisions of the Stanford
Judicial Council are strong
recommendations to the President, not
binding judicial decisions. ("Its decisions
shall not be appealable except in the sense
that all its decisions must be
recommendations to the President of the
University," Legislative and Judicial
Charter, Article 11, section A, part 1.)
We would hope that President Pitzer
rescind the part of Braunstein's probation
forbidding his appointment. Braunstein is
qualified to sit on that committee and is
the choice of the Senate. His appointment
has meaning in involving students in
governance. We can hardly imagine the
President opposing a nomination to the
Senate of the Academic Council. The
student Senate should be just as important
a body.
If the President does not reverse his
decision, the student Senate has a number
of alternatives open to it, the most fruitful
of which would be to refuse to nominate
anyone else. They should not allow
President Pitzer the luxury of saying that
students are meaningfully involved in
governance. If Braunstein is rejected, we
shall know that we are not.
