## Lyman Replies To The DAILY 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I write to protest against the
one-sidedness and incompleteness
of the front page article,
"Braunstein Denied Post Second
Time." It provided no basis on
which the Stanford community
could make even a tentative
judgment as to the rights and
wrongs of the matter.
First, in twenty-four
paragraphs of material there is but
one citation of anyone other than
Braunstein himself and his
supporters. Some minimal
consultation of other sources
might have turned up the pure,
unadulterated fiction of such
statements as Braunstein's: "The
President has been given four or
five alternatives and he decided to
take the one that would keep me
off the finance committee." There
is not one shred of truth in that
assertion. The President received
one recommendation and only
one from the Stanford Judicial
Council following Mr.
Braunstein's appeal, and he
accepted and acted upon it.
Second, and central to the
entire controversy, is the fact that
Mr. Braunstein wants to have his

cake of confidentiality and eat his
fill of publicity, all at the same
time. How can anyone make any
estimate as to whether his
punishment is too harsh, too
lenient, or just right, when
nothing is made public concerning
the actions for which he was put
on probation? The Daily, with a
degree of delicacy not always seen
in its pages, merely refers to his
conviction "for a private matter
that was unconnected with any
April 3 Movement activities." (No
explanation is offered as to why
your reporter considered it
necessary to separate the matter
from the April 3 Movement.) If
Mr. Braunstein wishes to make the
decision a public issue, he should
make the entire record public, not
just those portions that suit his
purposes.
Thirdly, Mr. David Edwards,
Chairman of the Student Senate,
is quoted as saying: "I personally
don't see why anyone should have
a veto. Yale has not been
convicted of any crime." The
latter sentence is only true if one
ignores the established
mechanisms for on-campus
judicial process—mechanisms

among which Braunstein himself
made a conscious and deliberate
choice last Spring. He was
convicted, and sentenced; it is
that sentence that he has this Fall
unsuccessfully appealed.
Finally, there appears to have
been no recognition on the Daily's
part (and the coverage given the
Student Senate's action still shows
none) that more is at issue here
than Mr. Braunstein or the rights
and wrongs of appointments to
Trustee Committees. If the stage
were national instead of within
the University, and the Congress
of the United States began
undoing decisions of the Supreme
Court which it did not like, I
would expect to find the Daily
supporting the Court. The
Student Senate, without
bothering even to ascertain the
nature of the offense for which
Mr. Braunstein was convicted,
proceeds to brush aside the
judicial mechanisms as if this were
a matter of no concern whatever.
Whether the Senate had any'
constitutional right to do this is a
matter on which I suppose there
can be argument; but to write
about the case as if no such issue

were involved is a disservice to the
Daily's readership—that is, to all
of us.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In order to contribute my own
opinion to the discussion as a
hedge against possible future
charges that those who supported
the President and opposed the
Senate did not hold forth and
declare themselves (their silence
thus being taken to render their
views irrelevant), I aver that I
wholeheartedly support President
Pitzer in his decision to reject the
nomination of Yale Braunstein to
the Trustee Finance Committee
and that I excoriate my
representatives in the Senate for
their brash bad judgment in the
matter.

one from the Stanford Judicial
Council following Mr.
Braunstein's appeal, and he
accepted and acted upon it.
Second, and central to the
entire controversy, is the fact that
Mr. Braunstein wants to have his

cake of confidentiality and eat his
fill of publicity, all at the same
time. How can anyone make any
estimate as to whether his
punishment is too harsh, too
lenient, or just right, when
nothing is made public concerning
the actions for which he was put
on probation? The Daily, with a
degree of delicacy not always seen
in its pages, merely refers to his
conviction "for a private matter
that was unconnected with any
April 3 Movement activities." (No
explanation is offered as to why
your reporter considered it
necessary to separate the matter
from the April 3 Movement.) If
Mr. Braunstein wishes to make the
decision a public issue, he should
make the entire record public, not
just those portions that suit his
purposes.
Thirdly, Mr. David Edwards,
Chairman of the Student Senate,
is quoted as saying: "I personally
don't see why anyone should have
a veto. Yale has not been
convicted of any crime." The
latter sentence is only true if one
ignores the established
mechanisms for on-campus
judicial process—mechanisms

among which Braunstein himself
made a conscious and deliberate
choice last Spring. He was
convicted, and sentenced; it is
that sentence that he has this Fall
unsuccessfully appealed.
Finally, there appears to have
been no recognition on the Daily's
part (and the coverage given the
Student Senate's action still shows
none) that more is at issue here
than Mr. Braunstein or the rights
and wrongs of appointments to
Trustee Committees. If the stage
were national instead of within
the University, and the Congress
of the United States began
undoing decisions of the Supreme
Court which it did not like, I
would expect to find the Daily
supporting the Court. The
Student Senate, without
bothering even to ascertain the
nature of the offense for which
Mr. Braunstein was convicted,
proceeds to brush aside the
judicial mechanisms as if this were
a matter of no concern whatever.
Whether the Senate had any'
constitutional right to do this is a
matter on which I suppose there
can be argument; but to write
about the case as if no such issue

were involved is a disservice to the
Daily's readership—that is, to all
of us.

In order to contribute my own
opinion to the discussion as a
hedge against possible future
charges that those who supported
the President and opposed the
Senate did not hold forth and
declare themselves (their silence
thus being taken to render their
views irrelevant), I aver that I
wholeheartedly support President
Pitzer in his decision to reject the
nomination of Yale Braunstein to
the Trustee Finance Committee
and that I excoriate my
representatives in the Senate for
their brash bad judgment in the
matter.
Mike Wolf

I write to protest against the
one-sidedness and incompleteness
of the front page article,
"Braunstein Denied Post Second
Time." It provided no basis on
which the Stanford community
could make even a tentative
judgment as to the rights and
wrongs of the matter.
First, in twenty-four
paragraphs of material there is but
one citation of anyone other than
Braunstein himself and his
supporters. Some minimal
consultation of other sources
might have turned up the pure,
unadulterated fiction of such
statements as Braunstein's: "The
President has been given four or
five alternatives and he decided to
take the one that would keep me
off the finance committee." There
is not one shred of truth in that
assertion. The President received
one recommendation and only
one from the Stanford Judicial
Council following Mr.
Braunstein's appeal, and he
accepted and acted upon it.
