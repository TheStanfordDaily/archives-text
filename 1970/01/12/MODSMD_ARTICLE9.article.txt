# On Braunstein
## What Should We Do? 
### Jim Schnieder 
The thought that Yale
Braunstein might even be
appointed Dog Catcher would
strike horror to the hearts of
those who have come to know his
manner of performance, judgment
and presentation in LASSU and
during last year's other
disruptions. The mere suggestion
that he could serve on a Trustee
committee shakes the pen with
which I write. President Pitzer's
decision to deny Mr. Braunstein's
appointment is an understandable
one. He might have based his
decision on three things: 1. His
knowledge of the University's
finances could enable him to
subvert the purposes of the
Trustee Finance Committee to his
own narrow and well defined
political aims. 2. President Pitzer
has the power to deny Mr.
Braunstein's appointment. 3. A
legal hook was provided by the
SJC on which President Pitzer
could hang his preference, thus
lending legitimacy to his decision.
It would be somewhat fulfilling
to turn my eyes from an inequity
and allow Mr. Braunstein to be
shuffled under the rug, thus
chalking one up for the multitude
who question the legitimacy of his
very existence, but this would be
to deny that objective element
which, from time to time, comes
to haunt us all —otherwise known
as the conscience. When Mr.
Braunstein was first denied his
appointment, after a momentary
feeling of exhiliration, I came to
recognize that it had been denied

for the wrong reason,
furthermore, the reason given
posed a threat to the integrity of
the ASSU Constitution and the
rights of students.
Mr. Braunstein was denied his
appointment on the grounds that
he was not eligible for
nomination. This was the point
objected to, because according to
the ASSU Constitution, as
approved by the Board of
Trustees, every student who is a
registered student shall receive all
privileges of membership
including equal consideration by
the ASSU Committee on
Nominations; the student in
question was eligible. Members of
the Student Senate felt duty
bound to see that the ASSU
Constitution be more fully
understood by the President;
consequently a resolution was
drafted, passed, and sent to the
President giving him an explicit
statement as to the eligibility of
students to serve on committees.
A clause which may have made
the resolution more clear to the
President had been deleted before
final passage, it read: "Therefore
be it further resolved that: While
the Senate recognizes the
University President's authority to
confirm or reject student
nominees to Trustee committees,
we request that he give due
consideration to the eligibility of
such nominees as set forth in the
ASSU Constitution."
As for interpretations of the
ASSU Constitution which have
come from sources other than the
Senate, it should be noted that
the Senate is given express
authority to interpret it by the
document itself.
No Presidential Respect
The resolution was the object
of a great deal of debate. In the
course of that debate, it became
apparent that the issue went
beyond the question of Mr.
Braunstein's qualifications or the
need for the Senaty to defend the
Constitution it was entrusted to
protect. The real issue, made clear
by the President's decision as
published in Friday's Daily, is that
the President does not respect the
wishes of the Senate. It has been
said that a statesman is one who is
held up from pressure on all sides.
If this also is the case with the
effective administrator, it is
incumbant upon the Senate to do
its part in keeping the President
upright, as it were. Lets for a
moment look at the Senate's
Counterpart, the Academic
Senate. Would the most casual
observer believe that the President
would trifle with its power, or
with those things which its
constituency hold sacred, i.e., the
effective right of academic
appointment and salary? The
answer is an unequivocal "No."
If there had been a request
from the Academic Senate for
him to reverse a decision
concerning the powers of that
body, it seems unlikely that the
President would incur the wrath
of the Academic Senate by
denying its request. How then is it
that he denies our request?

Perhaps it is because he views the
Senate as a conglomeration of
student representatives rendered
impotent by being bound up in
the bureaucratic humbug of a
legislative structure, too enmeshed
in "the system" to bring any kind
of real pressure on him as an
administrator. While this generally
might be the case, it should be
recognized that, just as with the
Academic Senate, the Senate of
the ASSU has its tender spots—the
power of the Senate is one. It
should be further recognized that
in any legislative body, unanimity
of opinion allows for a more
directive effort.
Those who serve on the ASSU
Committee on Nominations and
the Senate spend a sizable amount
of time, energy in the executive of
their duties. To have the President
treat with apparent ill regard a
joint decision of these bodies
comes as a slap to the very spirit
that created these bodies—the
spirit of responsible student
power through the governmental
process. UfJ e thing cannot be
denied, excepting a few Senators,
myself included, the Senate has
endorsed Mr. Braunstein's
appointment as a student
representative to the Trustee
Finance Committee. The
Committee on Nominations and
the Senate may have made a
mistake in doing so, but it should
be their right to make such a
mistake. Who can best ascertain
who will best represent students,
the University President or the
Senate?
No Show-down
It is conceivable to even the
most staunch defenders of the
Senate's prerogative, that a
mistake in appointment so severe
as to place an undue burden on
the members of a committee
could be made. In such a case, it
would only be reasonable to
accept the persona non grata
rejection of a student appointee
by vote of the committee itself.
Now to the question, "What to
do?" Being somewhat reluctant to
turn to the distasteful politics of
confrontation and having a high
regard for pragmatic solutions
based on realistic assessment, it
would seem that pursuing the
appointment of Mr. Braunstein
further would prove antithetical
to the long range objectives of
those who favor a greater and
more meaningful participation of
students in the governance of the
University. If we did pursue the
matter, relations between the
Senate and the President and
Trustees would become strained
at a time in which we need good
rapport to make student
membership in the Trustee
committee structure work.
This is not to say that the
principle we are concerned with
should be abandoned, but rather
by virtue of the Braunstein
incident, we have served notice
that in the future, similar
situations will be addressed in a
unified and vigorous manner.

power of the Senate is one. It
should be further recognized that
in any legislative body, unanimity
of opinion allows for a more
directive effort.
Those who serve on the ASSU
Committee on Nominations and
the Senate spend a sizable amount
of time, energy in the executive of
their duties. To have the President
treat with apparent ill regard a
joint decision of these bodies
comes as a slap to the very spirit
that created these bodies—the
spirit of responsible student
power through the governmental
process. UfJ e thing cannot be
denied, excepting a few Senators,
myself included, the Senate has
endorsed Mr. Braunstein's
appointment as a student
representative to the Trustee
Finance Committee. The
Committee on Nominations and
the Senate may have made a
mistake in doing so, but it should
be their right to make such a
mistake. Who can best ascertain
who will best represent students,
the University President or the
Senate?
No Show-down
It is conceivable to even the
most staunch defenders of the
Senate's prerogative, that a
mistake in appointment so severe
as to place an undue burden on
the members of a committee
could be made. In such a case, it
would only be reasonable to
accept the persona non grata
rejection of a student appointee
by vote of the committee itself.
Now to the question, "What to
do?" Being somewhat reluctant to
turn to the distasteful politics of
confrontation and having a high
regard for pragmatic solutions
based on realistic assessment, it
would seem that pursuing the
appointment of Mr. Braunstein
further would prove antithetical
to the long range objectives of
those who favor a greater and
more meaningful participation of
students in the governance of the
University. If we did pursue the
matter, relations between the
Senate and the President and
Trustees would become strained
at a time in which we need good
rapport to make student
membership in the Trustee
committee structure work.
This is not to say that the
principle we are concerned with
should be abandoned, but rather
by virtue of the Braunstein
incident, we have served notice
that in the future, similar
situations will be addressed in a
unified and vigorous manner.

member of the ASSU Senate.)
The thought that Yale
Braunstein might even be
appointed Dog Catcher would
strike horror to the hearts of
those who have come to know his
manner of performance, judgment
and presentation in LASSU and
during last year's other
disruptions. The mere suggestion
that he could serve on a Trustee
committee shakes the pen with
which I write. President Pitzer's
decision to deny Mr. Braunstein's
appointment is an understandable
one. He might have based his
decision on three things: 1. His
knowledge of the University's
finances could enable him to
subvert the purposes of the
Trustee Finance Committee to his
own narrow and well defined
political aims. 2. President Pitzer
has the power to deny Mr.
Braunstein's appointment. 3. A
legal hook was provided by the
SJC on which President Pitzer
could hang his preference, thus
lending legitimacy to his decision.
It would be somewhat fulfilling
to turn my eyes from an inequity
and allow Mr. Braunstein to be
shuffled under the rug, thus
chalking one up for the multitude
who question the legitimacy of his
very existence, but this would be
to deny that objective element
which, from time to time, comes
to haunt us all —otherwise known
as the conscience. When Mr.
Braunstein was first denied his
appointment, after a momentary
feeling of exhiliration, I came to
recognize that it had been denied

for the wrong reason,
furthermore, the reason given
posed a threat to the integrity of
the ASSU Constitution and the
rights of students.
Mr. Braunstein was denied his
appointment on the grounds that
he was not eligible for
nomination. This was the point
objected to, because according to
the ASSU Constitution, as
approved by the Board of
Trustees, every student who is a
registered student shall receive all
privileges of membership
including equal consideration by
the ASSU Committee on
Nominations; the student in
question was eligible. Members of
the Student Senate felt duty
bound to see that the ASSU
Constitution be more fully
understood by the President;
consequently a resolution was
drafted, passed, and sent to the
President giving him an explicit
statement as to the eligibility of
students to serve on committees.
A clause which may have made
the resolution more clear to the
President had been deleted before
final passage, it read: "Therefore
be it further resolved that: While
the Senate recognizes the
University President's authority to
confirm or reject student
nominees to Trustee committees,
we request that he give due
consideration to the eligibility of
such nominees as set forth in the
ASSU Constitution."
As for interpretations of the
ASSU Constitution which have
come from sources other than the
Senate, it should be noted that
the Senate is given express
authority to interpret it by the
document itself.
No Presidential Respect
The resolution was the object
of a great deal of debate. In the
course of that debate, it became
apparent that the issue went
beyond the question of Mr.
Braunstein's qualifications or the
need for the Senaty to defend the
Constitution it was entrusted to
protect. The real issue, made clear
by the President's decision as
published in Friday's Daily, is that
the President does not respect the
wishes of the Senate. It has been
said that a statesman is one who is
held up from pressure on all sides.
If this also is the case with the
effective administrator, it is
incumbant upon the Senate to do
its part in keeping the President
upright, as it were. Lets for a
moment look at the Senate's
Counterpart, the Academic
Senate. Would the most casual
observer believe that the President
would trifle with its power, or
with those things which its
constituency hold sacred, i.e., the
effective right of academic
appointment and salary? The
answer is an unequivocal "No."
If there had been a request
from the Academic Senate for
him to reverse a decision
concerning the powers of that
body, it seems unlikely that the
President would incur the wrath
of the Academic Senate by
denying its request. How then is it
that he denies our request?

Perhaps it is because he views the
Senate as a conglomeration of
student representatives rendered
impotent by being bound up in
the bureaucratic humbug of a
legislative structure, too enmeshed
in "the system" to bring any kind
of real pressure on him as an
administrator. While this generally
might be the case, it should be
recognized that, just as with the
Academic Senate, the Senate of
the ASSU has its tender spots—the
power of the Senate is one. It
should be further recognized that

final passage, it read: "Therefore
be it further resolved that: While
the Senate recognizes the
University President's authority to
confirm or reject student
nominees to Trustee committees,
we request that he give due
consideration to the eligibility of
such nominees as set forth in the
ASSU Constitution."
As for interpretations of the
ASSU Constitution which have
come from sources other than the
Senate, it should be noted that
the Senate is given express
authority to interpret it by the
document itself.
No Presidential Respect
The resolution was the object
of a great deal of debate. In the
course of that debate, it became
apparent that the issue went
beyond the question of Mr.
Braunstein's qualifications or the
need for the Senaty to defend the
Constitution it was entrusted to
protect. The real issue, made clear
by the President's decision as
published in Friday's Daily, is that
the President does not respect the
wishes of the Senate. It has been
said that a statesman is one who is
held up from pressure on all sides.
If this also is the case with the
effective administrator, it is
incumbant upon the Senate to do
its part in keeping the President
upright, as it were. Lets for a
moment look at the Senate's
Counterpart, the Academic
Senate. Would the most casual
observer believe that the President
would trifle with its power, or
with those things which its
constituency hold sacred, i.e., the
effective right of academic
appointment and salary? The
answer is an unequivocal "No."
If there had been a request
from the Academic Senate for
him to reverse a decision
concerning the powers of that
body, it seems unlikely that the
President would incur the wrath
of the Academic Senate by
denying its request. How then is it
that he denies our request?

Perhaps it is because he views the
Senate as a conglomeration of
student representatives rendered
impotent by being bound up in
the bureaucratic humbug of a
legislative structure, too enmeshed
in "the system" to bring any kind
of real pressure on him as an
administrator. While this generally
might be the case, it should be
recognized that, just as with the
Academic Senate, the Senate of
the ASSU has its tender spots—the
power of the Senate is one. It
should be further recognized that
in any legislative body, unanimity
of opinion allows for a more
directive effort.
Those who serve on the ASSU
Committee on Nominations and
the Senate spend a sizable amount
of time, energy in the executive of
their duties. To have the President
treat with apparent ill regard a
joint decision of these bodies
comes as a slap to the very spirit
that created these bodies—the
spirit of responsible student
power through the governmental
process. UfJ e thing cannot be
denied, excepting a few Senators,
myself included, the Senate has
endorsed Mr. Braunstein's
appointment as a student
representative to the Trustee
Finance Committee. The
Committee on Nominations and
the Senate may have made a
mistake in doing so, but it should
be their right to make such a
mistake. Who can best ascertain
who will best represent students,
the University President or the
Senate?
No Show-down
It is conceivable to even the
most staunch defenders of the
Senate's prerogative, that a
mistake in appointment so severe
as to place an undue burden on
the members of a committee
could be made. In such a case, it
would only be reasonable to
accept the persona non grata
rejection of a student appointee
by vote of the committee itself.
Now to the question, "What to
do?" Being somewhat reluctant to
turn to the distasteful politics of
confrontation and having a high
regard for pragmatic solutions
based on realistic assessment, it
would seem that pursuing the
appointment of Mr. Braunstein
further would prove antithetical
to the long range objectives of
those who favor a greater and
more meaningful participation of
students in the governance of the
University. If we did pursue the
matter, relations between the
Senate and the President and
Trustees would become strained
at a time in which we need good
rapport to make student
membership in the Trustee
committee structure work.
This is not to say that the
principle we are concerned with
should be abandoned, but rather
by virtue of the Braunstein
incident, we have served notice
that in the future, similar
situations will be addressed in a
unified and vigorous manner.

The thought that Yale
Braunstein might even be
appointed Dog Catcher would
strike horror to the hearts of
those who have come to know his
manner of performance, judgment
and presentation in LASSU and
during last year's other
disruptions. The mere suggestion
that he could serve on a Trustee
committee shakes the pen with
which I write. President Pitzer's
decision to deny Mr. Braunstein's
appointment is an understandable
one. He might have based his
decision on three things: 1. His
knowledge of the University's
finances could enable him to
subvert the purposes of the
Trustee Finance Committee to his
own narrow and well defined
political aims. 2. President Pitzer
has the power to deny Mr.
Braunstein's appointment. 3. A
legal hook was provided by the
SJC on which President Pitzer
could hang his preference, thus
lending legitimacy to his decision.
It would be somewhat fulfilling
to turn my eyes from an inequity
and allow Mr. Braunstein to be
shuffled under the rug, thus
chalking one up for the multitude
who question the legitimacy of his
very existence, but this would be
to deny that objective element
which, from time to time, comes
to haunt us all —otherwise known
as the conscience. When Mr.
Braunstein was first denied his
appointment, after a momentary
feeling of exhiliration, I came to
recognize that it had been denied

for the wrong reason,
furthermore, the reason given
posed a threat to the integrity of
the ASSU Constitution and the
rights of students.
Mr. Braunstein was denied his
appointment on the grounds that
he was not eligible for
nomination. This was the point
objected to, because according to
the ASSU Constitution, as
approved by the Board of
Trustees, every student who is a
registered student shall receive all
privileges of membership
including equal consideration by
the ASSU Committee on
Nominations; the student in
question was eligible. Members of
the Student Senate felt duty
bound to see that the ASSU
Constitution be more fully
understood by the President;
consequently a resolution was
drafted, passed, and sent to the
President giving him an explicit
statement as to the eligibility of
students to serve on committees.
A clause which may have made
