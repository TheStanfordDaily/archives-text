# Teach-In To Focus On Dangers To Ecology
## 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
With the sweeping changes of
1970'5, many expect that there
will come an awakened
consciousness among the
American public of the level of
environmental poisoning and a
swift demand from the country
for a sane and sound ecological
policy. This is, what students,
professors, and congressmen are
hoping as they lay plans for the
first "National Ecology Teach-In"
on April 22.
The teach-in, to be held on
college campuses across the
country, is specially designed to
awaken the American public to
the imminency of ecological
catastrophe, and the urgency of
the need for strong government
action to control population
growth.
To coordinate, service, and
help organize the local campus
teach-in's, a national headquarters
has been established in
Washington.
National leaders include
Senator Gay lord Nelson (D-Wis.),
originator of the teach-in idea,
Congressman Paul McCloskey
(R-Calif.), Sydney Howe,
president of the Conservation
Foundation, and Stanford's own
Dr. Paul Ehrlich, nationally
known population biologist.
Dennis Hayes, former student
body president, is working with
Sen. Nelson to help coordinate
the various local efforts, while
former Daily editor Philip
Taubman is concentrating his
efforts on obtaining national
publicity for the teach-in.

National leaders emphasize
that their main purpose is to
advise and aid local groups in
planning their own teach-in, and
act mainly as an information
clearing house. The national office
will coordinate the local efforts to
maximize their effect on the
American public, but it will
emphasize decentralization and
localization, since each area of the
country has its own unique
ecology, and its own special
environmental problems.
Medical student David Sachs,
former president of the Stanford
Conservation Group and an
organizer of the teach-in here,
cites the Coyote Hill controversy
and the Central California Water
Project as two local issues that
will receive prime attention in
April. The purpose of the water
project is to divert water from
northern California rivers into
Southern California.
Proponents of the project
argue that it is desperately needed
to bring more central California
land into agricultural production
and to meet the water supply
needs of the rapidly growing Los
Angeles area. Yet ecologists argue
just as vehemently that diverting
more water to Los Angeles will
only encourage more population
growth in an already
overpopulated area.
Ecologists also claim that there
is already too much central valley
land under production.
Congressman McCloskey recently
cited the case of one farmer who

was paid $ 4Vi million to take
acreage out of production. With
tax money going to these farmers
to stop producing and to the
water project to encourage
production, notes Sachs, "The
taxpayer loses at both ends."
Moratorium Role
Though there is no official
contact between the two
organizations, the Moratorium
may also play a role in the
teach-in, examining the
relationship between the war in
Vietnam and the deterioration of

our environment, and perhaps
concentrating in particular on the
effects that the war has had on
the ecology of Vietnam.
Another strong possibility for
exploration in the teach-in is the
local problem of air pollution.
The SWOPSI class dealing with
this issue, led by graduate student
Ned Groth, is now into its second
quarter of investigation into
peninsula industries and the Bay
Area Air Pollution Control
District, and is expected to
publish its findings and

conclusions at the end of this
quarter.
The specific form of the
teach-in has not yet been decided
on, but a campus wide meeting
will be held within the next two
weeks to discuss the matter,
according to another of the
Stanford organizers, Glenn Lopez.
Lopez, chairman of the
Stanford Committee on
Population and Environment, and
an organizer of last November's
Student Environmental Congress
here, is one who feels that the

issue of Vietnam and that of the
environment are related in an
important way. At the Congress
he stated, "For any chance of
survival at all, human beings must
stop fighting and work to counter
the almost insurmountable
problems of over-population and
environmental deterioration."
Legislation Sought
Lopez hopes that specific
legislative proposals (on both a
state and national level) will grow
out of the teach-in. Indeed, some
highly placed officials in the
movement are so optimistic about
the effect of the teach-in on
American public opinion that
they foresee the passage of a
national bill legalizing abortion in
America, a bill which is at this
stage, inconceivable.
Lopez would also like to see a
coordination of Stanford's efforts
with those of high schools and
other colleges in the area, passing
on information and advice for
forming their own programs for
April 22.

Planners of the teach-in are
presently considering asking the
administration to postpone classes
on the 22nd. If this fails, they will
follow the general course that
succeeded so well in the
Moratoriumâ€”trying to get as
many individual professors as
possible to cancel their classes.
Public Concern
Leaders of the movement
emphasize that the time has
passed when the public could
ignore the deterioration of their
environment, trusting that the
government would take the
initiative to protect it. Ecologists
feel that the problem of the
quality of our world and our lives
can no longer be the exclusive
concern of a small cluster of
scientists and government
technicians. As the open letter to
college students from the national
office so clearly argues, "The time
has come for all citizens to begin
thinking about the basic questions
raised by technological advances
and environmental degradation."
