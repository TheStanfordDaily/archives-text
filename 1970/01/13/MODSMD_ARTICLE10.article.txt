# Environmental Vulnerability
## Poisoned By 'Economic Arrogance' 
### Joshua Lederberg 
The most important biological
discovery of the 1960's was the
awakening of everyman to the
vulnerability of the environment,
and therefore of human health
and survival, to the appetites of
sub-optimized technology. The
most urgent business of the 70's
must remain the building of
orderly communities among and
within the nations; and then we
must learn how not to poison
ourselves as a side-effect of
economic arrogance and scientific
ignorance.
Until now, the environment
has been exploited as if it were a
free good; in fact it is everybody
else's property. The reassertion of
the community's rights is an
inevasible Lest of the integrity of
free-enterprise economics and
democratic government.
Wise policies for managing the
environment depend on much
more than good intentions and
the ultimate dedication of civic
power to the common welfare.
They also require factual
information on hazards and
benefits for an efficient and just
allocation of costs and profits.
The first article of an
environmental bill of rights must

be to shift the burden of risk for
untried technologies away from a
helpless consumer public to their
sponsors and profiters (sic not
profiteers). This is not a vindictive
or confiscatory proposal, but a
necessary ingredient of a fair
market where the cost of
information about a product is
high compared to its unit price.
This principle has been
established in law for food
additives, but for few other
markets. Besides direct regulatory
law, however, we also have
possible recourse to liability for
damages, compulsory insurance,
tax incentives, and sometimes
simple civic conscience.
In a recent article in Science
magazine, Chauncey Starr, Dean
of the UCLA School of Engineering
has attempted to develop a calculus
of technological risk as an extension
For example, Dr. Starr counts
the fatalities that are associated in
any way with conventional
electric power to be 4 deaths per
year per million-kilowatt power
station. On the assumption that
this death index represents a
pragmatic, social balancing of the
costs and benefits of electric
power, it is used as a criterion for

the risk analysis of nuclear power
plant operations.
Power plant catastrophes
which might disperse radiation are
postulated to cause human
damage counted as ten lethal
cancers per million. A plant need
then run for only two and one
half years to satisfy the death
index, and the limiting factor
would therefore be the risk to the
capital invested in the plant. (This
would have to reach a calculated
useful life of at least 30 years).
It would, I hope, be unfair to
take this hypothetical argument as
the reasoned posture of nuclear
safety analysis and I will respond
only in equally hypothetical
terms.
Above all, these are the wrong
questions for risk analysis. If
capital investment would tolerate
a catastrophe every thirty years,
my own anxieties must revert to
the effects of population exposure
to radiation. It costs us dearly to
be as unsure as we are whether the
fallout could cause 5 or 500
cancers. Furthermore, the analysis
totally ignores other health
effects, including fetal injury and
gene mutation.

The market where risks are
balanced is also very different for
the two cases. In my use of
conventional electric power, I
happily pay an extra premium for
safe wiring, care of appliances,
educating my self and my family
and other ways of reducing the
personal risk of fire or
electrocution below the average.

The marginal costs of that
safety eifort are the measure of
the risk market, which is relatively
open and fair for conventional
electricity. The comparable costs
are perhaps not quite infinite for
my personal quest for nuclear
safety, but I am not sure where I
could emigrate.
Is there a fair chess game in
town?
