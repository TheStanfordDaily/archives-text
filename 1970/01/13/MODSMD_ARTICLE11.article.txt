# Volunteers in Asia Unveils 1970 Plans
## 
### 
Volunteers in Asia outlines its
plans for 1970 this evening at
7:30 in the Tresidder small
lounge. The Stanford-based
volunteer organization intends to
have seventy workers in eight
areas of Asia during the coming
year.
Begun by a group of Stanford
freshmen in 1963 as a summer
experiment in service and
experimental education, the
program has grown to include not
only summer assignments but
academically-related six-month
posts for undergraduates and
two-year positions for graduates.
The program is now active in
Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Philippines, Korea, Japan, Taiwan,
Macao, and Nepal. The greatest
recent growth has taken place in
Indonesia; VIA was the first
volunteer-sending organization to
be asked into the country since
the Peace Corps left in 1965.
Requests from the Ministry of
Education call for teachers in
outer island universities; an
invitation from the Family

Planning Institute will send
volunteers to central or east Java
and Bali.
During this evening's program,
Chris Foulke and Laura Masunaga
will describe the Hong Kong
program and Mike Benefiel the
Japan assignments. Dan Morrow,
just returned from east Java, will
outline the six-month program.
Dwight Clark, VlA's director, will
report on recent program changes
and additions; Paul Richardson,
chairman of VlA's board of
directors, will moderate.
VIA is now in its second year
of placing a small number of
undergraduates in six-month
programs which allow students to
remain relatively current
academically through directed
reading arrangements for credit
while still fulfilling a fulltime
work assignment in Asia. The
program is a precursor of
fieldwork programs now made
possible through the
just-established Student Center
for Educational Innovation and
Research.

Most VIA volunteers are given
teaching assignments, usually in
English instruction. Others teach
science and social science subjects,
lead recreation projects, and work
in medical and health education
settings. All go at the invitation of
local institutions, whether a
university or college, secondary
school, hospital, refugee group, or
welfare organization.


FROM Sll{, WITH LOVE: Volunteers In Asia (VIA) sends volunteers to six areas in Asia to serve as teachers for periods of
(wo months, six months, and two years. Here one of 70 volunteers last year explains problems in algebra to high school
students in the Itiilippines. Volunteers teach a wide range of subjects in English, mathematics, and the physical and social
sciences.

FROM Sll{, WITH LOVE: Volunteers In Asia (VIA) sends volunteers to six areas in Asia to serve as teachers for periods of
(wo months, six months, and two years. Here one of 70 volunteers last year explains problems in algebra to high school
students in the Itiilippines. Volunteers teach a wide range of subjects in English, mathematics, and the physical and social
sciences.
Volunteers in Asia outlines its
plans for 1970 this evening at
7:30 in the Tresidder small
lounge. The Stanford-based
volunteer organization intends to
have seventy workers in eight
areas of Asia during the coming
year.
Begun by a group of Stanford
freshmen in 1963 as a summer
experiment in service and
experimental education, the
program has grown to include not
only summer assignments but
academically-related six-month
posts for undergraduates and
two-year positions for graduates.
The program is now active in
Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Philippines, Korea, Japan, Taiwan,
Macao, and Nepal. The greatest
recent growth has taken place in
Indonesia; VIA was the first
volunteer-sending organization to
be asked into the country since
the Peace Corps left in 1965.
Requests from the Ministry of
Education call for teachers in
outer island universities; an
invitation from the Family

Planning Institute will send
volunteers to central or east Java
and Bali.
During this evening's program,
Chris Foulke and Laura Masunaga
will describe the Hong Kong
program and Mike Benefiel the
Japan assignments. Dan Morrow,
just returned from east Java, will
outline the six-month program.
Dwight Clark, VlA's director, will
report on recent program changes
and additions; Paul Richardson,
chairman of VlA's board of
directors, will moderate.
VIA is now in its second year
of placing a small number of
undergraduates in six-month
programs which allow students to
remain relatively current
academically through directed
reading arrangements for credit
while still fulfilling a fulltime
work assignment in Asia. The
program is a precursor of
fieldwork programs now made
possible through the
just-established Student Center
for Educational Innovation and
Research.

Most VIA volunteers are given
teaching assignments, usually in
English instruction. Others teach
science and social science subjects,
lead recreation projects, and work
in medical and health education
settings. All go at the invitation of
local institutions, whether a
university or college, secondary
school, hospital, refugee group, or
welfare organization.
