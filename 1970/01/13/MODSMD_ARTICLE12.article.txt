# People Help People' McCloskey Tells Students
## 
### JOHN JOHNSTON 
San Mateo County
Congressman Pete McCloskey said
Friday that "government is not
the answer to the social ills."
The Republican leader told
delegates to the Conference on
Volunteer Services on campus
that the direction should be that
"people help people." He
suggested that "perhaps it is the
role of government to provide
money to people like you."
Speaking informally and
without notes, McCloskey praised
the young people of this country
for their unflagging idealism and
enthusiasm in the face of great
obstacles. He noted the new
emphasis young people have
brought on such problems as
Vietnam, racial discrimination,
and pollution of the environment.
"However," he continued,
"this idealism has not thus far
been translated into effective
action."
Lack of Leadership
One reason for this is a "gap in
leadership and organizational
ability." Calling the conference
"as important as anything
happening in this country today,"
McCloskey expressed the hope
that the ideas generated here
would go far in filling this gap.
Another great need of student
volunteers is "stick-to-itiveness."
"It's fine to gather one day for a
community clean-up or a
protest," he told them, "but a
good volunteer is one who works

all nine months of the school year
helping a child to read."
Nevertheless, the Congressman
felt very strongly on the role of
volunteer services in this country.
Local Examples
To support his contention that
government cannot cure social ills,
McCloskey cited several local
examples including the
educational level in East Palo Alto
schools, legal assistance services
for the poor, and the distribution
of birth control information as
programs where government
action has failed. In all the cases
he noted, student volunteers
could, and in some are, fulfilling
vital needs.
He urged the conference
delegates not to be discouraged
with failure of many programs.
"Only one out of every
twenty-five volunteer programs
formed succeeds." This is
approximately the same success
ratio as newly-formed private
businesses, he noted.
Ending his address with a
positive suggestion, McCloskey
urged the delegates to "stop
griping and start acting" as a "plea
on the part of government to
people to do the things
government cannot do."
Afternoon Session
After a short question period,
the 150 delegates attending the
conference from Washington,
Oregon, California, Hawaii,
Alaska, and Guam adjourned for
lunch.

San Mateo County
Congressman Pete McCloskey said
Friday that "government is not
the answer to the social ills."
The Republican leader told
delegates to the Conference on
Volunteer Services on campus
that the direction should be that
"people help people." He
suggested that "perhaps it is the
role of government to provide
money to people like you."
Speaking informally and
without notes, McCloskey praised
the young people of this country
for their unflagging idealism and
enthusiasm in the face of great
obstacles. He noted the new
emphasis young people have
brought on such problems as
Vietnam, racial discrimination,
and pollution of the environment.
"However," he continued,
"this idealism has not thus far
been translated into effective
action."
Lack of Leadership
One reason for this is a "gap in
leadership and organizational
ability." Calling the conference
"as important as anything
happening in this country today,"
McCloskey expressed the hope
that the ideas generated here
would go far in filling this gap.
Another great need of student
volunteers is "stick-to-itiveness."
"It's fine to gather one day for a
community clean-up or a
protest," he told them, "but a
good volunteer is one who works

all nine months of the school year
helping a child to read."
Nevertheless, the Congressman
felt very strongly on the role of
volunteer services in this country.
Local Examples
To support his contention that
government cannot cure social ills,
McCloskey cited several local
examples including the
educational level in East Palo Alto
schools, legal assistance services
for the poor, and the distribution
of birth control information as
programs where government
action has failed. In all the cases
he noted, student volunteers
could, and in some are, fulfilling
vital needs.
He urged the conference
delegates not to be discouraged
with failure of many programs.
"Only one out of every
twenty-five volunteer programs
formed succeeds." This is
approximately the same success
ratio as newly-formed private
businesses, he noted.
Ending his address with a
positive suggestion, McCloskey
urged the delegates to "stop
griping and start acting" as a "plea
on the part of government to
people to do the things
government cannot do."
Afternoon Session
After a short question period,
the 150 delegates attending the
conference from Washington,
Oregon, California, Hawaii,
Alaska, and Guam adjourned for
lunch.
