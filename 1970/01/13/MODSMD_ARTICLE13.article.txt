# New Committee Formed
## Emphasis On Female Opportunities 
### SUSAN KRIEGER 
Concern for opportunities of
women has lead to the creation of
the Committee on the Education
and Employment of Women. The
charge, issued by Joyce Kobayashi
of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, directs the committee
to explore issues concerning
undergraduate, graduate, and
professional women.

The committee will consist of
nine members, three presidential
appointees, three appointed by
the Academic Senate, all of whom
have been selected, and three
students. Student applications are
due Friday, January 16, and may
be obtained from the ASSU
office. Men, as well as women
students are welcomed to apply.

Five specific duties have been
set up. By reviewing policies
which appear to restrict women,
increasing the number of women
faculty members, and by
exploration of programs for the
continuing education of mature
women, the committee hopes to
increase educational
opportunities.
In addition, they plan to
recommend changes which would
equalize career opportunities for
women throughout Stanford.
It is hoped that counseling
services will be more adaptable to
women's changing needs. This will
include personal development,
plans for careers, and education
up to the professional level.
The committee also hopes to
propose services, such as child
care centers, which would enable
women to reach their educational
and professional goals.

In addition, they will advise
the University of the needs of
women and of changes needed to
meet these needs.
Members of the administration
will be invited to attend meetings
as if they were ex officio members
whenever recommendations which
would affect their responsibilities
are being considered, if their
attendance is relevant. Whether or
not they are invited to attend,
they will always be notified of thv
consideration of these issues.
Because the committee's
function in relation to other
University committees has not
been defined, the CEEW is
considered experimental. It will
be reviewed after about a year to
determine if it is performing
properly or should be reorganized.
