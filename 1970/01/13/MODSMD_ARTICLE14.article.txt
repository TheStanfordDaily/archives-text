# Draft Deferments On The Way Out
## 
### 
| WASHINGTON (AP) â€”Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
disclosed yesterday that the Nixon Administration is planning
| further changes in draft procedures, including the elimination of
most deferments.
"I would not want to say all deferments," Laird said. "As you
know we have medical deferments and we have hardship
deferments. But I am talking in the area of student deferments,
occupational deferments and parental deferments."
He said he believes these can be gradually phased out.
More than 2 million men now hold student deferments.
The secretary was interviewed on a television-radio program.
Laird said he believes the recently adopted random-selection
system has corrected one of the major inequities by reducing a
registrant's period of uncertainty but he continued:
"The President wants to move ... so that all young people are
treated equally and fairly. And I believe we will move in the
direction of eliminating some of the occupational deferments,
student deferments and other types of deferments ..."
The Secretary indicated a fiscal 1971 defense budget of about
$73 billion by saying it will be $10 billion under the $83 billion he
said was proposed by a former administration.
