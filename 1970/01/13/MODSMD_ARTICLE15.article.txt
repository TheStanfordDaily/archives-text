# Prof Criticizes French Education
## 
### 
The French government,
sometimes regarded as
ultra-conservative and rigidly
bureaucratic, is moving toward
major changes in its educational
system.
It is establishing
"experimental" universities,
beginning to decentralize its
educational administration, and
finding ways to finance changes,
reports Charles Frankel, professor
of philosophy at Columbia
University.
Prof. Frankel, a guest of H.
Thomas James, dean of Stanford's

School of Education Friday
(Jan. 9), added a cautionary note:
"Whether they will actually make
all the changes remains to be
seen."
Their report, which was
commissioned by President De
Gaulle, is being translated into
French and will get its preliminary
hearing before French educators
in March.
The study's broad
recommendations are:
—That the French Bureau of
Education pour more money into
the underdeveloped areas and
underprivileged people in its own
country;
—That it establish a more
diversified curriculum to
encourage students to go on to
higher education;
—That it re-do its whole
competitive examination system
"for more diagnostic purposes"
rather than the weeding out of all
but the very bright;
—That in higher education the
French lay less stress on college
"faculties" of this or that
discipline and give students a
wider choice in university majors,
establish more specialized
universities (again, like the U.S.)
and seek to establish more
residential colleges.
The two experimental
universities established so far are
both near Paris—Vincennes, which
is considered politically "far left,"
and Dauphine, which features
seminar-type instruction and
student participation in faculty
and administrative affairs.
