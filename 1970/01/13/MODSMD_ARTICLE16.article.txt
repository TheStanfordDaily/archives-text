# Brilliant Talent Inside 'The Cage'
## 
### MARILYN MORRIS 
Does the allure of stage life and
critical praise incline an
ex-convict's aspirations toward
life in the theatre? No, insist
Robert Poole and Ernie Allen,
two principals in the Barbwire
Theatre production of "The
Cage", Rick Cluchey's drama of
penal injustice.
To view the performances of
Poole and Allen is to doubt their
denial of theatrical ambition. On
stage as "Al" and "Doc", two
predatory black homosexuals,
they exchanged volleys of angry
dialogue with improvisational
ease. Naturally. Both are veterans
of the California penal system;
they know wherof they speak.
"Except, Allen grins, "I like
girls."
Fri day's opening night
audience would have been
incredulous to learn that Robert
Poole's visceral portrayal of "Al"
was his acting debut. Even more
surprising is his admission that
"I'm not interested in acting . . .
I'm a writer." Prior to his three
year stint in "the joint" for
forgery, Poole authored
screenplays for Robert Gordon
Productions. Currently, his
melodrama "The Black and the
Beautiful" is being considered b*
Screen Gems and Sammy Davis
Jr., but the parolee also writes in
the comic genre. His newest, still
unfinished piece, "Happy Water",
is an idyllic fantasy in which the
patrons of a bar are served an
elixir which makes them oblivious
to ethnic roles. "It's funny," he
says with a flush of boyish pride.

Ernie Allen, on the other hand,
is a man of carefully checked rage.
However, his childhood was not
scarred by the privation which
typically produces a criminal.
What, then, turned the track star
of Hollywood High into the San
Quentin inmate convicted of
grand theft? "Racism in the
Georgia National Guard." Allen
speaks between his teeth, "I
planned to go to college on the
G.I. bill . . . That's a crock of
shit." Asked whether drama
figures in his plans beyond the
Barbwire, his impatience erupted.
"Dig this," he snapped, his finger
jabbing the biography printed on
the theatre program. There were
listed an impressive array of
credits which please him far
beyond any theatrical kudo:
0.E.0. community organizer;
Project Co-ordinater for Brandeis
University's study of violence;
San Francisco Mental Health
Association and still more. His
chief delight is in the work of
S.A.T.E. (Self Advancement
Through Education) out of which
grew the experimental work
furlow program for convicts.
Academe, rather than the stage, is
his turf. "Social change is where
I'm at."
"The Cage" suggests that the
correctional system stunts a man's
character, rather than
rehabilitating it. "It's medieval,"
Allen recalls. What is remarkable,
then, about both Robert Poole
and Ernie Allen is that, in each,
the altruistic impulse emerged
from"the joint."

shit." Asked whether drama
figures in his plans beyond the
Barbwire, his impatience erupted.
"Dig this," he snapped, his finger
jabbing the biography printed on
the theatre program. There were
listed an impressive array of
credits which please him far
beyond any theatrical kudo:
0.E.0. community organizer;
Project Co-ordinater for Brandeis
University's study of violence;
San Francisco Mental Health
Association and still more. His
chief delight is in the work of
S.A.T.E. (Self Advancement
Through Education) out of which
grew the experimental work
furlow program for convicts.
Academe, rather than the stage, is
his turf. "Social change is where
I'm at."
"The Cage" suggests that the
correctional system stunts a man's
character, rather than
rehabilitating it. "It's medieval,"
Allen recalls. What is remarkable,
then, about both Robert Poole
and Ernie Allen is that, in each,
the altruistic impulse emerged
from"the joint."
Does the allure of stage life and
critical praise incline an
ex-convict's aspirations toward
life in the theatre? No, insist
Robert Poole and Ernie Allen,
two principals in the Barbwire
Theatre production of "The
Cage", Rick Cluchey's drama of
penal injustice.
To view the performances of
Poole and Allen is to doubt their
denial of theatrical ambition. On
stage as "Al" and "Doc", two
predatory black homosexuals,
they exchanged volleys of angry
dialogue with improvisational
ease. Naturally. Both are veterans
of the California penal system;
they know wherof they speak.
"Except, Allen grins, "I like
girls."
Fri day's opening night
audience would have been
incredulous to learn that Robert
Poole's visceral portrayal of "Al"
was his acting debut. Even more
surprising is his admission that
"I'm not interested in acting . . .
I'm a writer." Prior to his three
year stint in "the joint" for
forgery, Poole authored
screenplays for Robert Gordon
Productions. Currently, his
melodrama "The Black and the
Beautiful" is being considered b*
Screen Gems and Sammy Davis
Jr., but the parolee also writes in
the comic genre. His newest, still
unfinished piece, "Happy Water",
is an idyllic fantasy in which the
patrons of a bar are served an
elixir which makes them oblivious
to ethnic roles. "It's funny," he
says with a flush of boyish pride.

Ernie Allen, on the other hand,
is a man of carefully checked rage.
However, his childhood was not
scarred by the privation which
typically produces a criminal.
What, then, turned the track star
of Hollywood High into the San
Quentin inmate convicted of
grand theft? "Racism in the
Georgia National Guard." Allen
speaks between his teeth, "I
planned to go to college on the
G.I. bill . . . That's a crock of
shit." Asked whether drama
