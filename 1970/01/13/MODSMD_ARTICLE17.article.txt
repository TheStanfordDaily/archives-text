# Vietnam Peace Fast
## 
### 
A two-day fast of meals in
University Residences will take
place Friday and Saturday,
January 16 and 17, in connection
with the January Moratorium.
The boycott is aimed at raising
maney for Vietnamese refugees.
The University Food Services
has agreed to rebate
approximately 70c to 75c for
each lunch and dinner not eaten
on Friday and Saturday.
Proponents of the boycott in
the Student Mobilization
Committee stress that civilian
refugees in Vietnam, who now
number an estimated four million,
are in great need of financial help.
A similar one-day program last
year at Stanford for Biafra netted
over $1,200.

According to the University
Food Services, students
participating in the boycott will
not have to turn in their meal
cards.
Instead, funds raised for the
Vietnamese refugees "will
represent savings in food costs
resulting from meals missed by
meal contract holders. The
absentee figures will be based on
the difference between the normal
pattern of attendance at the
specific meals scheduled for the
Moratorium fast," according to
W.P. Mevers, Manager of the
University Food Services.
All money collected from the
Food Services will be sent to the
American Friends Services
Committee.
