# Students Mobe Drafts Anti-War Plans
## 
### 
Plans were made at last
Thursday's Student Mobilization
Committee meeting to build
toward a massive spring anti-war
offensive at Stanford.
A two-day meal boycott has
been planned to coincide with the
Moratorium this month.
The Thursday meeting
concentrated on how to involve a
broad base of students in
committed anti-war work.
Emphasis was placed on making
the movement as democratic as
possible. Instead of having
officers, committees are being
formed for specific functions, and
the leadership of each committee
will rotate periodically among
those who wish to take
responsibility. By giving all
members the opportunity to gain
experience in leading the
movement, SMC hopes to avoid
having the anti-war movement
dependent on only a few leaders.
Open meetings will be held
every Wednesday at 4:15 P.M. in
Serra Lounge (Stern Complex) to
discuss, plan, and build anti-war
activities.
A car pool is being arranged for
those who wish to attend the SMC
regional conference in San
Francisco on January 17. There
will also be a national SMC

conference in Cleveland from
February 13 through 15. This
meeting will set the tone for the
spring offensive. SMC is soliciting
contributions to charter a bus,
hoping that as many students as
possible from the West Coast will
be able to participate in making
decisions for the peace movement.
SMC is one of the oldest
national anti-war groups, founded
in 1966. Among other anti-war
activities, SMC played a key role
in building the mass march in S an
Francisco last November.
Plans are in the making now
for the next big action on the
West Coast, a War Crimes Tribunal
to indict the California
educational system for its alledged
complicity with the war in
Vietnam. Intensive research is
being carried out in SMC's all over
the state, including Stanford.
Efforts are also being made to
bring high school students and
Gl's into the peace movement and
to support the GE workers strike,
the Black Panthers, and the
Chicago 7.
In addition to supporting the
national and regional anti-war
actions, the local SMC is planning
a major drive to involve Stanford
students in regular, on-going
anti-war work. During the week
of January 19 through 23, a
regional SMC leader, along with
local SMC members, will speak
each night after dinner at
different dormitory complexes to
explain SMC and build the
anti-war movement on campus.
Efforts are being made to
coordinate this drive with the
Stanford Moratorium.

activities.
A car pool is being arranged for
those who wish to attend the SMC
regional conference in San
Francisco on January 17. There
will also be a national SMC

conference in Cleveland from
February 13 through 15. This
meeting will set the tone for the
spring offensive. SMC is soliciting
contributions to charter a bus,
hoping that as many students as
possible from the West Coast will
be able to participate in making
decisions for the peace movement.
SMC is one of the oldest
national anti-war groups, founded
in 1966. Among other anti-war
activities, SMC played a key role
in building the mass march in S an
Francisco last November.
Plans are in the making now
for the next big action on the
West Coast, a War Crimes Tribunal
to indict the California
educational system for its alledged
complicity with the war in
Vietnam. Intensive research is
being carried out in SMC's all over
the state, including Stanford.
Efforts are also being made to
bring high school students and
Gl's into the peace movement and
to support the GE workers strike,
the Black Panthers, and the
Chicago 7.
In addition to supporting the
national and regional anti-war
actions, the local SMC is planning
a major drive to involve Stanford
students in regular, on-going
anti-war work. During the week
of January 19 through 23, a
regional SMC leader, along with
local SMC members, will speak
each night after dinner at
different dormitory complexes to
explain SMC and build the
anti-war movement on campus.
Efforts are being made to
coordinate this drive with the
Stanford Moratorium.
Plans were made at last
Thursday's Student Mobilization
Committee meeting to build
toward a massive spring anti-war
offensive at Stanford.
A two-day meal boycott has
been planned to coincide with the
Moratorium this month.
The Thursday meeting
concentrated on how to involve a
broad base of students in
committed anti-war work.
Emphasis was placed on making
the movement as democratic as
possible. Instead of having
officers, committees are being
formed for specific functions, and
the leadership of each committee
will rotate periodically among
those who wish to take
responsibility. By giving all
members the opportunity to gain
experience in leading the
movement, SMC hopes to avoid
having the anti-war movement
dependent on only a few leaders.
Open meetings will be held
every Wednesday at 4:15 P.M. in
Serra Lounge (Stern Complex) to
discuss, plan, and build anti-war
activities.
