# Freshman Rick Jerome In Impressive Debut
## 
### 
Stanford and UCLA gymnasts
performed almost exactly as
expected in their league opener
last weekend in Los Angeles.
Stanford's Rich Jerome didn't.
Jerome, a freshman from
Sacramento, surprised most of the
experts by nearly defeating Dusty
Ritter, a smooth UCLA veteran,
in all-around competition. Ritter
prevailed 50.15 to 47.1.
Stanford lost the dual meet
150.65 to 1 31.3, which, according
to Indian Coach Dan Millman, is
just about what he figured it
would be. But Jerome was the
surprise.
"I'm extremely impressed with
him," Millman said, pointing out
that Jerome never competed in
gymnastics in high school. "No
doubt he should be one of the
finest gymnasts in the United
States in one or two years."
In the meantime, the Indians

are off to a good start this year.
Last year's top Stanford score in
league competition was 132; they
nearly equalled that the first time
out Friday night.
With the Pac-8 being as strong
as it is however, the Tribe
probably won't be able to
improve on last season's
sixth-place finish more than one
step.
"We need to work harder,"
Millman says."I think we're
working toward an early season
peak—perhaps we'll reach it this
week."
Sacramento State visits Encina
Pavilion Saturday night at 7:30
p.m. in what looks to be the
closest home showing of the
season. Future home meets are
scheduled with Washington and
San Jose State Feb. 14, California
and Washington State Feb. 21,
and USC and Oregon Feb. 28.
