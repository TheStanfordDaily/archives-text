## Biafra Surrenders 
### 
LAGOS NIGERIA AP-Biafra's
surrender after 30 months of war
was accepted in a Monday
midnight broadcast by Nigerian
federal leader Maj. Gen. Yakubu
Gowon. He urged all Nigerians to
treat the defeated rebels as
brothers.
The capitulation ended a
succession that wiped out nearly a
generation of Ibo tribe
children-perhaps two million lives
over-all-and shattered black
Africa's once most promising
nation.
A massive international effort
took shape to care for perhaps
four million hungry Ibos expected
to emerge from within Biafra's
dwindled boundaries following
the surrender.
Maj. Gen. Phillip Effiong, a
minority Effik tribesman left in
charge when Biafra's leader, Gen.
C. Odumegwu Ojukwu, caught
one of the last flights out,
capitulated in a broadcast at 4:40
p.m.-10:40 a.m. EST. He agreed
to discuss terms in the framework
of a united Nigeria.
He ordered his troops
disengaged and appealed to
federal leader Gowon to cease fire
while a settlement was negotiated.
Accepting the surrender,
Gowon said in a 10-minute
broadcast that there would bf a
"general amnesty for all those
misled into attempting to
disintegrate the country."
Gowon, 35, has been
championing moderation
throughout the war, saying that
Ibos were Nigerians. He has
repeatedly asked his soldiers to
show restraint and some have
attributed the slow progress of the
war to this.
When Ojukwu succeeded May
30, 1967 to safeguard Ibo
security, Biafrr was the entire
Eastern Region-30,000 square
miles. At the end, it was sliced to
less than 1,000 square miles.
The last link to the world-Uli
air-strip was poinded to rubble by
Soviet-built bombers and fighters.
While Biafra crumbled, a search
was on for Ojukwu who put his
white Mercedes staff car on a

transport plane Sunday and went
off, he said, to speak with Biafra's
friends about peace.
He promised to return.
The 45-year-old Effiong said
on Radio Biafra: "I am convinced
now a stop must be put to the
bloodshed that is going on as a
result of the war. I am also
convinced that the suffering of
our people must be brought to an
end.
"Those elements of the old
government regime who have
made negotiation and
reconciliation impossible have
voluntarily removed themselves
from our midst.
Alioto Won t Run

SAN FRANCISCO AP-Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto said Monday
that he will not run for the
Democratic nomination for
governor of California.
"I shall not run for Governor
this time around," he told a news
conference at San Francisco City
Hall.
He said the burdens of working
on San Francisco's problems as
mayor were immense.

"Combined with the efforts
required of me to prosecute my
libel suit against Look magazine,
they make it impractical, at this
time, to undertake the additional
burden of a prolonged and
time-consuming campaign for
governor."
Allioto has sued Look in U.S.
District Court for $12.5 million
dollars damages. The magazine
last September published an
article alleging that the mayor had
links with the Mafia underworld
organization.
Roger Boas, California
Democratic chairman, followed
Alioto's statement with call for
unity behind Jess Unruh,
Assembly minority leader, as the
party's candidate for governor.
Alioto's decision not to contest
Jesse Unruh, California Assembly
minority leader, for the
governorship nomination came
after disclosures last month that
he had shared antitrust suit fees
with John O'Connell, former
Washington attorney general.
Alioto declared that the
Washington antitrust suit
disclosures had no bearing in his
decision.
Aides Indicted
NEW YORK AP—A former top
aide to House speaker John W.
McCormack and a lawyer-lobbyist
were accused today by a federal
grand jury of conspiring to use the
speaker's office to try to influence
matters before government
bodies.
The conspiracy, according to
the federal prosecutor here,
involved Martin Sweig,
McCormack's suspended senior
aide, who was accused of misusing
his office to pressure numerous
federal agencies in behalf of
persons referred to him by Nathan
M. Voloshen, the lawyer.
Among agencies contacted
during the six-year course of the
conspiracy, the U.S. attorney
listed the Departments of Justice,
Treasury, Defense, Labor and Post
Office and the Selective Service
System.

Alioto Won t Run

SAN FRANCISCO AP-Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto said Monday
that he will not run for the
Democratic nomination for
governor of California.
"I shall not run for Governor
this time around," he told a news
conference at San Francisco City
Hall.
He said the burdens of working
on San Francisco's problems as
mayor were immense.

"Combined with the efforts
required of me to prosecute my
libel suit against Look magazine,
they make it impractical, at this
time, to undertake the additional
burden of a prolonged and
time-consuming campaign for
governor."
Allioto has sued Look in U.S.
District Court for $12.5 million
dollars damages. The magazine
last September published an
article alleging that the mayor had
links with the Mafia underworld
organization.
Roger Boas, California
Democratic chairman, followed
Alioto's statement with call for
unity behind Jess Unruh,
Assembly minority leader, as the
party's candidate for governor.
Alioto's decision not to contest
Jesse Unruh, California Assembly
minority leader, for the
governorship nomination came
after disclosures last month that
he had shared antitrust suit fees
with John O'Connell, former
Washington attorney general.
Alioto declared that the
Washington antitrust suit
disclosures had no bearing in his
decision.
Aides Indicted
NEW YORK AP—A former top
aide to House speaker John W.
McCormack and a lawyer-lobbyist
were accused today by a federal
grand jury of conspiring to use the
speaker's office to try to influence
matters before government
bodies.
The conspiracy, according to
the federal prosecutor here,
involved Martin Sweig,
McCormack's suspended senior
aide, who was accused of misusing
his office to pressure numerous
federal agencies in behalf of
persons referred to him by Nathan
M. Voloshen, the lawyer.
Among agencies contacted
during the six-year course of the
conspiracy, the U.S. attorney
listed the Departments of Justice,
Treasury, Defense, Labor and Post
Office and the Selective Service
System.

LAGOS NIGERIA AP-Biafra's
surrender after 30 months of war
was accepted in a Monday
midnight broadcast by Nigerian
federal leader Maj. Gen. Yakubu
Gowon. He urged all Nigerians to
treat the defeated rebels as
brothers.
The capitulation ended a
succession that wiped out nearly a
generation of Ibo tribe
children-perhaps two million lives
over-all-and shattered black
Africa's once most promising
nation.
A massive international effort
took shape to care for perhaps
four million hungry Ibos expected
to emerge from within Biafra's
dwindled boundaries following
the surrender.
Maj. Gen. Phillip Effiong, a
minority Effik tribesman left in
charge when Biafra's leader, Gen.
C. Odumegwu Ojukwu, caught
one of the last flights out,
capitulated in a broadcast at 4:40
p.m.-10:40 a.m. EST. He agreed
to discuss terms in the framework
of a united Nigeria.
He ordered his troops
disengaged and appealed to
federal leader Gowon to cease fire
while a settlement was negotiated.
Accepting the surrender,
Gowon said in a 10-minute
broadcast that there would bf a
"general amnesty for all those
misled into attempting to
disintegrate the country."
Gowon, 35, has been
championing moderation
throughout the war, saying that
Ibos were Nigerians. He has
repeatedly asked his soldiers to
show restraint and some have
attributed the slow progress of the
war to this.
When Ojukwu succeeded May
30, 1967 to safeguard Ibo
security, Biafrr was the entire
Eastern Region-30,000 square
miles. At the end, it was sliced to
less than 1,000 square miles.
The last link to the world-Uli
air-strip was poinded to rubble by
Soviet-built bombers and fighters.
While Biafra crumbled, a search
was on for Ojukwu who put his
white Mercedes staff car on a

transport plane Sunday and went
off, he said, to speak with Biafra's
friends about peace.
He promised to return.
The 45-year-old Effiong said
on Radio Biafra: "I am convinced
now a stop must be put to the
bloodshed that is going on as a
result of the war. I am also
convinced that the suffering of
our people must be brought to an
end.
"Those elements of the old
government regime who have
made negotiation and
reconciliation impossible have
voluntarily removed themselves
from our midst.

generation of Ibo tribe
children-perhaps two million lives
over-all-and shattered black
Africa's once most promising
nation.
A massive international effort
took shape to care for perhaps
four million hungry Ibos expected
to emerge from within Biafra's
dwindled boundaries following
the surrender.
Maj. Gen. Phillip Effiong, a
minority Effik tribesman left in
charge when Biafra's leader, Gen.
C. Odumegwu Ojukwu, caught
one of the last flights out,
capitulated in a broadcast at 4:40
p.m.-10:40 a.m. EST. He agreed
to discuss terms in the framework
of a united Nigeria.
He ordered his troops
disengaged and appealed to
federal leader Gowon to cease fire
while a settlement was negotiated.
Accepting the surrender,
Gowon said in a 10-minute
broadcast that there would bf a
"general amnesty for all those
misled into attempting to
disintegrate the country."
Gowon, 35, has been
championing moderation
throughout the war, saying that
Ibos were Nigerians. He has
repeatedly asked his soldiers to
show restraint and some have
attributed the slow progress of the
war to this.
When Ojukwu succeeded May
30, 1967 to safeguard Ibo
security, Biafrr was the entire
Eastern Region-30,000 square
miles. At the end, it was sliced to
less than 1,000 square miles.
The last link to the world-Uli
air-strip was poinded to rubble by
Soviet-built bombers and fighters.
While Biafra crumbled, a search
was on for Ojukwu who put his
white Mercedes staff car on a

transport plane Sunday and went
off, he said, to speak with Biafra's
friends about peace.
He promised to return.
The 45-year-old Effiong said
on Radio Biafra: "I am convinced
now a stop must be put to the
bloodshed that is going on as a
result of the war. I am also
convinced that the suffering of
our people must be brought to an
end.
"Those elements of the old
government regime who have
made negotiation and
reconciliation impossible have
voluntarily removed themselves
from our midst.
Alioto Won t Run

SAN FRANCISCO AP-Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto said Monday
that he will not run for the
Democratic nomination for
governor of California.
"I shall not run for Governor
this time around," he told a news
conference at San Francisco City
Hall.
He said the burdens of working
on San Francisco's problems as
mayor were immense.

"Combined with the efforts
required of me to prosecute my
libel suit against Look magazine,
they make it impractical, at this
time, to undertake the additional
burden of a prolonged and
time-consuming campaign for
governor."
Allioto has sued Look in U.S.
District Court for $12.5 million
dollars damages. The magazine
last September published an
article alleging that the mayor had
links with the Mafia underworld
organization.
Roger Boas, California
Democratic chairman, followed
Alioto's statement with call for
unity behind Jess Unruh,
Assembly minority leader, as the
party's candidate for governor.
Alioto's decision not to contest
Jesse Unruh, California Assembly
minority leader, for the
governorship nomination came
after disclosures last month that
he had shared antitrust suit fees
with John O'Connell, former
Washington attorney general.
Alioto declared that the
Washington antitrust suit
disclosures had no bearing in his
decision.
Aides Indicted
NEW YORK AP—A former top
aide to House speaker John W.
McCormack and a lawyer-lobbyist
were accused today by a federal
grand jury of conspiring to use the
speaker's office to try to influence
matters before government
bodies.
The conspiracy, according to
the federal prosecutor here,
involved Martin Sweig,
McCormack's suspended senior
aide, who was accused of misusing
his office to pressure numerous
federal agencies in behalf of
persons referred to him by Nathan
M. Voloshen, the lawyer.
Among agencies contacted
during the six-year course of the
conspiracy, the U.S. attorney
listed the Departments of Justice,
Treasury, Defense, Labor and Post
Office and the Selective Service
System.
