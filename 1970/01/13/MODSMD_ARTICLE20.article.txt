# Cougars Top Cards
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford closed out a disappointing road trip
with a 72-62 loss to Washington State last night in
Pullman, Washington. The Indians, as against
Washington Saturday night, started slowly and
with the Cougars shooting well against the Indian's
zone, they fell behind early. Sparked by the
shooting of 6-5 guard Dennis Hogg, WSU pulled
out to an early 24-1 4 lead.
Stanford fell into further troubles with poor
shooting and costly turnovers, as they fell behind
33-16 before abandoning their zone defense with
five minutes remaining in the half. The change did
little good though, as the Cougars led at halftime
42-27.
The Cougars outshot the Tribe by a large
margin in the first half, 45% to 26.5%, as WSU
picked up eight more field goals than Stanford.
Pacing the Cougars was Hogg with 14 points, while
Palmer led Stanford with eight.
Stanford started shooting better at the outset
of the second half, but the Cougar lead remained
constant between 12 and 14 points. Stanford cut
the lead to nine a couple of times in the second
half, but they could never get any closer against a
stubborn WSU defense.
One big problem for the Cards was the failure
of stalwart guard Claude Terry to carry the scoring
load he usually does. Terry failed to hit a field goal
until midway into the second half, and he finished
the night with only nine points, far below his
nineteen point average.
The Cougars were led by Hogg's twenty points,
while center Jack Bergersen added eleven. The
Indians were paced by Dennis O'Neill's seventeen
point performance, while center Bill Palmer added
16. The Cards had a lot of trouble against a tough
WSU zone defense, especially in the early going,
and they had an almost impossible task in trying
to overcome a big halftime lead.

The loss to the 19th ranked Cougars dropped
the Indian's season record to 2-9. The Cougars are
now 11-2 overall and 2-0 in Pac-8 play, while the
Indians have failed to win in two league contests.
Friday night the Cards return to Roscoe Maples
Pavilion to take on the California Bears. The Bears
were impressive 84-64 victors over the tough
Washington Huskies last night, and they will give
the Indians another tough contest. The Bears are
an explosive but terribly inconsistent team. They
are led by former Sequoia High School star Charlie
Johnson and outstanding junior forward Jackie
Ridgle. Rounding out the starting five for the
Bears will probably be Ansley Truitt, Phil Chenier
and Leo Dorado. If the Bears can put it all
together as they did last night, they will give the
unlucky Indians still another tough night.
