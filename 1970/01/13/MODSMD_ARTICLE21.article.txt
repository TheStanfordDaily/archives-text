## Card Keglers Bowled Over 
### 
The men's and women's varsity
bowling teams returned Saturday
night from a disappointing day's
matches in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Masters
League at Fresno State. The men's
team won three points and lost
five in spite of three more good
team efforts. The women had
several good individual
performances but could not put
them together and they lost all
eight points.
With the scratch league at its
halfway mark, the men are in
seventh place out of eight teams
and the women are last in their
four-team division. The men's
division is led by Fresno State,
which has a 5-man team average
of 990 per game. The women are
led by an equally formidable rival
in Chico State which has won
29.5 points and lost only 2.5 over
the season.
As player-coach of the men's
team, Ralph Kimball remarked,
"This is probably the best
collegiate league in the nation."
He pointed out that at least five
bowlers in the men's division are
averaging 200 or better.

The league bowls one Saturday
each month, with the different
member schools taking turns as
host. The teams then bowl two
three-game blocks, each against a
different opponent.
In Saturday's first match, the
men won three points (two games
and total pinfall) from Santa
Clara. High scorer for the men was
Doug Cutting with a 564 series
and a fine 224 game. Kimball shot
180-182-188 to finish second with
a 550.
The women met Berkeley in
the first match and lost a
heartbreaking first game by only
six pins. Berkeley went on to win
all four points. High series for the
Stanford team was Julie Fleece's
489 with a high game of 208.
Chico State stayed in front of
the Stanford men all the way in
the second match although the
Stanford team shot three good
team games of 91 2, 917, and 914.
The Stanford effort was led by
Kimball's fine 200-214-21 6 series
of 630. Bob Appleby also had a
good 580 series with a 216 game.

The women also played their
second match against Chico State.
They had a good team effort of
797 in the second game when
they were tied with the Chico girls
to the last frame but lost by 15
pins. The Stanford team high
scorer was Diane DePaolis with a
505 series; Kathy Ewing also had
a nice 197 game and a 490 series.
Two girls on the Chico team, who
are averaging in the 180's, had
series of 541 and 520.
When asked to comment on
this year's team, Kimball said,
"This is definitely a building year.
Stanford has twice been the men's
champions, and a building year
such as this one is inevitable."
Kimball also mentioned that the
girls' team was the second-place
team in last year's regional
tournament and has a good
chance of repeating its showing
this year. This quarter, both the
men's and women's team will be
focusing attention on getting
ready for the regionals which will
be held at Fresno in February.
