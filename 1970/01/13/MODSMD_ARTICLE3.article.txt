# Grass Roots Rally Protests Dillingham
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
More than 180 people gathered
at the site of the proposed
Dillingham hotel-office complex
yesterday afternoon to protest
University land use policies. The
rally was organized by the radical
land use group Grass Roots and
capped a half mile march down El
Camino to the "Palo Alto Square"
site adjacent to the Industrial
Park.
Grass Roots spokesman
Michael Sweeney said that the
"project will economically benefit
the Industrial Park companies.
Santa Clara county can't continue
growing at this rate. It's a ticket
to disaster."

Rally speakers pointed out that
the office complex will force
1500 more people into an already
tight housing market.
Marching in time to the beat of
a "hard fife and drum corps," the
group walked down the sidewalk,
observing all traffic lights.
Carrying signs reading "House
People, Not Profits," and "Leland
Stanford is a Money Grubbing
Landlord," the marchers drew
stares from workers in offices
along the route.
Need Ignored
A tent was erected at the rally
symbolizing low-cost housing, a
need which Grass Roots feels is
being ignored by industry and the
university.
A large contingent of Santa
Clara county policemen stationed
themselves near the rally site.
Several patrol cars circled the area
throughout the demonstration.
Policemen and cameramen from
local television stations
photographed the proceedings.
Following speeches, rally
participants formed a picket line
in front of the site. Marchers
posted their signs on the fence
surrounding the area
Picketers distributed a leaflet
explaining Grass Roots opposition
to the development to
businessmen and passers-by along
the march route. Reactions of the
onlookers ranged from skepticism
to outright laughter as the group
rambled by.
In related developments, the
Ad Hoc Committee on Low-Cost
Housing, chaired by Professor of
History, Gordon Wright of the
department, announced that it
will be holding hearings tonight
and Thursday night on the local
housing situation. The first of the
closed hearings, tonight at 7 p.m.
room 267 of Tresider Union, will
concern itself with the opinions of
various Stanford groups on the
housing issue. The second meeting
will focus on the needs of
off-campus groups.
