# 'No Comment' On Offense
## Proposal Backs Braunstein 
### 
The controversy over Yale
Braunstein's nomination to the
Trustee Finance Committee will
return to the student Senate floor
Thursday, but the story of why he
has been placed on probation will
almost surely remain untold.
Senators Rick Atkins and Paul
Witt will offer a resolution
demanding that Braunstein be
seated "immediately and without
fail," and maintaining that
President Kenneth Pitzer can
never exclude a duly nominated
candidate for any office or
committee.
Pitzer rejected Braunstein's
nomination by the student
Committee on Nominations
because he has been put on
probation under campus judicial
proceedures and specifically
prohibited from serving on
committees.
In a memo received yesterday
by Provost Richard Lyman, a
spokesman for Braunstein warned,
"No aspects of the case

concerning Mr. Braunstein are to
be made public under any
circumstances. Any failure in this
regard will mean that Mr.
Braunstein will be forced to sue
the University for breach of
contract."
Refusal To Reveal
Braunstein absolutely refused
again yesterday to discuss why he
is on probation, despite a
challenge by Lyman to make the
facts behind his case public
"If Mr. Braunstein wished to
make the decision a public issue,
he should make the entire record
public, not just those portions
that suit his purposes," Lyman
wrote in a letter published in
yesterday's Daily.
"I have made my decision and
it is my absolute right under the
judicial charter," Braunstein
countered. "If Lyman wishes to
abridge my rights let him rewrite
the judicial charter."
Braunstein, himself a Senate
member, said he did not know if

the Atkins-Witt resolution
supporting him would pass. He
said, if he is not appointed the
Senate might refuse to appoint
student members to any
committees, name its own
"shadow committees" of
students, faculty and trustees, or
name students to all committees
except finance. The group might
also drop the whole issue, he said.
