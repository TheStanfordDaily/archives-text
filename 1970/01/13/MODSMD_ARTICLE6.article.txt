# Socialism: Serious Alter native'

### LANG ATWOOD 
"Capitalism Fouls Things Up." This Socialist
Worker's Party (SWP) slogan sums up the feelings
of Dianne Feeley, a Marxist and Women's
Liberation advocate, who is the SWP candidate
for the U.S. Senate seat of George Murphy.
Miss Feeley forsees the day when the masses
of people will stand up and fight the "evils" of
capitalism as manifested in the economy and
government of the United States and its allies.
She told the Daily in a recent interview that the
revolution will come when the people are
presented with a serious alternative to the
present system, one that is genuinely better and
not just rhetoric.
Membership in the Socialist Worker's Party
and her candidacy for the Senate on the SWP
slate came after a long period of radicalization,
which began in 1960 when Miss Feeley protested
the hosing of students who were demonstrating
against the House Un-American Activities
Committee hearings in San Francisco. She
became a pacifist and demonstrated on the East
Coast against the production and spread of
nuclear weapons while working as an associate
editor of the Catholic Worker. Miss Feeley was a
teacher during the 1965 Freedom Now struggles
in Mississippi and was a leader of the Strike
Support Committee at San Francisco State
College last year, where she is currently a
graduate student in Interdisciplinary Studies in
Education.
Women's Liberation
Socialist politics have led Miss Feeley into the
Women's Liberation movement, a struggle which
she feels fits well with SWP goals.
"It's going to be necessary to have a socialist
revolution to carry out those demands . . . even
simple ones like equal pay for women. Well, that
just makes sense, but when in history has that
demand been implemented?" she asked.
"The first time was in 1871, the time of the
Paris Commune when socialists took state power
for only two months. Even in Cuba . . . which
has numerous problems that we don't have to
quite the same extent, nonetheless they're able
to implement immediately equal pay for equal
work," she explained.

Miss Feeley points out that the Women's
Liberation movement is a broad-based one
composed of Republicans, Democrats, anarchists
and revolutionaries. Not all women's
liberationists would agree with her Marxist
analysis, which advocates a guaranteed paid wage
to the woman who chooses to be a homemaker,
textbooks rewritten to remove myths of

women's inferiority, no
discrimination in
education and
employment, complete
control of her own
body with the right of
abotion and twenty
four hour child care
centers.
Her campaign is
more than a declaration
of women's rights. Miss
Feeley mounts a serious
attack on our present
system at various levels
including ecological
destruction, world-wide
U.S. imperialism and
the repression of
minorities and other
dissidents.
Tax On Polluters
Citing the pollution
problem as an example
that "capitalism can't
do anything right,"
Miss Feeley proposes to
levy a 100 percent tax
on industries that are
causing pollution and
use the money to build
a large-scale rapid
transit system.

Stressing that the people would make the
decisions on the basis of scientific fact after the
revolution, she puts her hope for the future in
councils of elected citizens.
She believes that these councils could operate
the factories more efficiently than present
management because operations would be on the
basis of "need" rather than "demand" and

profits.
"There's no rational
reason for profit and
demand other than that
a few people owning all
want to maximize that
profit; that's not a good
enough reason for me,
and that's one of the
reasons why I'm a
socialist,'' she
explained.
When asked during
the interview how such
a system would
operate, she replied
that a basic supply of a
given product would be
produced based on
anticipated need plus
an additional surplus to
meet any unexpected
demand. What this
means, she explained, is
that an integrated
world economic system
would be created to
replace thy present
capitalistic one in
operation today.
''The present
international economy
is based on profit for a

few and not need for the many . . . that's why
the only thing that can replace capitalism is
another economic system. We can't go back to
some primitive life style, we can only go on to
another international system," Miss Feeley said.
Revolution Necessary
Although certain that a revolution is
necessary, Miss Feeley believes that a lot can be
accomplished before the revolution, and this is
why she is running for the Senate. Although she
has no illusions about winning in 1970, she sees a
gradual radicalization taking place, especially in
the anti-war movement, that will make a socialist
victory possible in the future.
When asked if people would be voting for her
as a gesture of protest, she agreed in part, but she
claimed it would also be an endorsement of the
SWP platform from those already radicalized.
"It all depends which stage they're at when
they vote," she commented.
A Peaceful Change
"The American revolution is going to be the
most profoundly democratic thing we have ever
seen. I base that on the high technological and
communications level of the United States and
on the very democratic instincts of the masses of
people, who will be capable of ruling their own
lives," she explained.
Miss Feeley feels that there is a growing
awareness of the problems and effects of
capitalism. She says that the people want an
alternative but have been conditioned not to
trust their fellow man and this prevents (hem
from speaking out. She hopes that her candidacy
will provide a focus for this unrest and allow
people to get together to work for a new state.
Unity Necessary
"My role is to point out how this all fits
together; how the problems of ecology, Third
World, Women's Liberation and a relevent
education, how all of these problems that
alienate all of us fit together, and that the only
way we're going to win is by getting together and
doing something about it, not by going off, not
by martyrdom but by standing up together and
making a very profound change," she explained.
Miss Feeley will be appearing on campus on
February 8, to speak on "Women in the 70's."

revolution will come when the people are
presented with a serious alternative to the
present system, one that is genuinely better and
not just rhetoric.
Membership in the Socialist Worker's Party
and her candidacy for the Senate on the SWP
slate came after a long period of radicalization,
which began in 1960 when Miss Feeley protested
the hosing of students who were demonstrating
against the House Un-American Activities
Committee hearings in San Francisco. She
became a pacifist and demonstrated on the East
Coast against the production and spread of
nuclear weapons while working as an associate
editor of the Catholic Worker. Miss Feeley was a
teacher during the 1965 Freedom Now struggles
in Mississippi and was a leader of the Strike
Support Committee at San Francisco State
College last year, where she is currently a
graduate student in Interdisciplinary Studies in
Education.
Women's Liberation
Socialist politics have led Miss Feeley into the
Women's Liberation movement, a struggle which
she feels fits well with SWP goals.
"It's going to be necessary to have a socialist
revolution to carry out those demands . . . even
simple ones like equal pay for women. Well, that
just makes sense, but when in history has that
demand been implemented?" she asked.
"The first time was in 1871, the time of the
Paris Commune when socialists took state power
for only two months. Even in Cuba . . . which
has numerous problems that we don't have to
quite the same extent, nonetheless they're able
to implement immediately equal pay for equal
work," she explained.

Miss Feeley points out that the Women's
Liberation movement is a broad-based one
composed of Republicans, Democrats, anarchists
and revolutionaries. Not all women's
liberationists would agree with her Marxist
analysis, which advocates a guaranteed paid wage
to the woman who chooses to be a homemaker,
textbooks rewritten to remove myths of

women's inferiority, no
discrimination in
education and
employment, complete
control of her own
body with the right of
abotion and twenty
four hour child care
centers.
Her campaign is
more than a declaration
of women's rights. Miss
Feeley mounts a serious
attack on our present
system at various levels
including ecological
destruction, world-wide
U.S. imperialism and
the repression of
minorities and other
dissidents.
Tax On Polluters
Citing the pollution
problem as an example
that "capitalism can't
do anything right,"
Miss Feeley proposes to
levy a 100 percent tax
on industries that are
causing pollution and
use the money to build
a large-scale rapid
transit system.

Stressing that the people would make the
decisions on the basis of scientific fact after the
revolution, she puts her hope for the future in
councils of elected citizens.
She believes that these councils could operate
the factories more efficiently than present
management because operations would be on the
basis of "need" rather than "demand" and

profits.
"There's no rational
reason for profit and
demand other than that
a few people owning all
want to maximize that
profit; that's not a good
enough reason for me,
and that's one of the
reasons why I'm a
socialist,'' she
explained.
When asked during
the interview how such
a system would
operate, she replied
that a basic supply of a
given product would be
produced based on
anticipated need plus
an additional surplus to
meet any unexpected
demand. What this
means, she explained, is
that an integrated
world economic system
would be created to
replace thy present
capitalistic one in
operation today.
''The present
international economy
is based on profit for a

few and not need for the many . . . that's why
the only thing that can replace capitalism is
another economic system. We can't go back to
some primitive life style, we can only go on to
another international system," Miss Feeley said.
Revolution Necessary
Although certain that a revolution is
necessary, Miss Feeley believes that a lot can be
accomplished before the revolution, and this is
why she is running for the Senate. Although she
has no illusions about winning in 1970, she sees a
gradual radicalization taking place, especially in
the anti-war movement, that will make a socialist
victory possible in the future.
When asked if people would be voting for her
as a gesture of protest, she agreed in part, but she
claimed it would also be an endorsement of the
SWP platform from those already radicalized.
"It all depends which stage they're at when
they vote," she commented.
A Peaceful Change
"The American revolution is going to be the
most profoundly democratic thing we have ever
seen. I base that on the high technological and
communications level of the United States and
on the very democratic instincts of the masses of
people, who will be capable of ruling their own
lives," she explained.
Miss Feeley feels that there is a growing
awareness of the problems and effects of
capitalism. She says that the people want an
alternative but have been conditioned not to
trust their fellow man and this prevents (hem
from speaking out. She hopes that her candidacy
will provide a focus for this unrest and allow
people to get together to work for a new state.
Unity Necessary
"My role is to point out how this all fits
together; how the problems of ecology, Third
World, Women's Liberation and a relevent
education, how all of these problems that
alienate all of us fit together, and that the only
way we're going to win is by getting together and
doing something about it, not by going off, not
by martyrdom but by standing up together and
making a very profound change," she explained.
Miss Feeley will be appearing on campus on
February 8, to speak on "Women in the 70's."

"Capitalism Fouls Things Up." This Socialist
Worker's Party (SWP) slogan sums up the feelings
of Dianne Feeley, a Marxist and Women's

Coast against the production and spread of
nuclear weapons while working as an associate
editor of the Catholic Worker. Miss Feeley was a
teacher during the 1965 Freedom Now struggles
in Mississippi and was a leader of the Strike
Support Committee at San Francisco State
College last year, where she is currently a
graduate student in Interdisciplinary Studies in
Education.
Women's Liberation
Socialist politics have led Miss Feeley into the
Women's Liberation movement, a struggle which
she feels fits well with SWP goals.
"It's going to be necessary to have a socialist
revolution to carry out those demands . . . even
simple ones like equal pay for women. Well, that
just makes sense, but when in history has that
demand been implemented?" she asked.
"The first time was in 1871, the time of the
Paris Commune when socialists took state power
for only two months. Even in Cuba . . . which
has numerous problems that we don't have to
quite the same extent, nonetheless they're able
to implement immediately equal pay for equal
work," she explained.

Miss Feeley points out that the Women's
Liberation movement is a broad-based one
composed of Republicans, Democrats, anarchists
and revolutionaries. Not all women's
liberationists would agree with her Marxist
analysis, which advocates a guaranteed paid wage
to the woman who chooses to be a homemaker,
textbooks rewritten to remove myths of

women's inferiority, no
discrimination in
education and
employment, complete
control of her own
body with the right of
abotion and twenty
four hour child care
centers.
Her campaign is
more than a declaration
of women's rights. Miss
Feeley mounts a serious
attack on our present
system at various levels
including ecological
destruction, world-wide
U.S. imperialism and
the repression of
minorities and other
dissidents.
Tax On Polluters
Citing the pollution
problem as an example
that "capitalism can't
do anything right,"
Miss Feeley proposes to
levy a 100 percent tax
on industries that are
causing pollution and
use the money to build
a large-scale rapid
transit system.

Stressing that the people would make the
decisions on the basis of scientific fact after the
revolution, she puts her hope for the future in
councils of elected citizens.
She believes that these councils could operate
the factories more efficiently than present
management because operations would be on the
basis of "need" rather than "demand" and

profits.
"There's no rational
reason for profit and
demand other than that
a few people owning all
want to maximize that
profit; that's not a good
enough reason for me,
and that's one of the
reasons why I'm a
socialist,'' she
explained.
When asked during
the interview how such
a system would
operate, she replied
that a basic supply of a
given product would be
produced based on
anticipated need plus
an additional surplus to
meet any unexpected
demand. What this
means, she explained, is
that an integrated
world economic system
would be created to
replace thy present
capitalistic one in
operation today.
''The present
international economy
is based on profit for a

few and not need for the many . . . that's why
the only thing that can replace capitalism is
another economic system. We can't go back to
some primitive life style, we can only go on to
another international system," Miss Feeley said.
Revolution Necessary
Although certain that a revolution is
necessary, Miss Feeley believes that a lot can be
accomplished before the revolution, and this is
why she is running for the Senate. Although she
has no illusions about winning in 1970, she sees a
gradual radicalization taking place, especially in
the anti-war movement, that will make a socialist
victory possible in the future.
When asked if people would be voting for her
as a gesture of protest, she agreed in part, but she
claimed it would also be an endorsement of the
SWP platform from those already radicalized.
"It all depends which stage they're at when
they vote," she commented.
A Peaceful Change
"The American revolution is going to be the
most profoundly democratic thing we have ever
seen. I base that on the high technological and
communications level of the United States and
on the very democratic instincts of the masses of
people, who will be capable of ruling their own
lives," she explained.
Miss Feeley feels that there is a growing
awareness of the problems and effects of
capitalism. She says that the people want an
alternative but have been conditioned not to
trust their fellow man and this prevents (hem
from speaking out. She hopes that her candidacy
will provide a focus for this unrest and allow
people to get together to work for a new state.
Unity Necessary
"My role is to point out how this all fits
together; how the problems of ecology, Third
World, Women's Liberation and a relevent
education, how all of these problems that
alienate all of us fit together, and that the only
way we're going to win is by getting together and
doing something about it, not by going off, not
by martyrdom but by standing up together and
making a very profound change," she explained.
Miss Feeley will be appearing on campus on
February 8, to speak on "Women in the 70's."

"Capitalism Fouls Things Up." This Socialist
Worker's Party (SWP) slogan sums up the feelings
of Dianne Feeley, a Marxist and Women's
Liberation advocate, who is the SWP candidate
for the U.S. Senate seat of George Murphy.
Miss Feeley forsees the day when the masses
of people will stand up and fight the "evils" of
capitalism as manifested in the economy and
government of the United States and its allies.
She told the Daily in a recent interview that the
revolution will come when the people are
presented with a serious alternative to the
present system, one that is genuinely better and
not just rhetoric.
Membership in the Socialist Worker's Party
and her candidacy for the Senate on the SWP
slate came after a long period of radicalization,
which began in 1960 when Miss Feeley protested
the hosing of students who were demonstrating
against the House Un-American Activities
Committee hearings in San Francisco. She
became a pacifist and demonstrated on the East
Coast against the production and spread of
nuclear weapons while working as an associate
