# Housing Priorities
## 'Need Factor' 
### Barry Askinas 
Last week I wrote about the
necessity for introducing a need
factor into graduate student
fellowship support. At the present
time most awards are based solely
on merit. In a time of shrinking
graduate support and growing
commitments to enroll more
minority graduate students, there
is a clear conflict inherent in
current policy. Support in the
professional schools —law,
medicine, and business—as well as
in undergraduate years, is based
on need. I was simply arguing that
other graduate aid should mov6 in
that direction.
If we are going to have more
students from less affluent
backgrounds, the money has to
come from somewhere, and since
the government is cutting back on
fellowship funds, that means that
students from relatively wealthy
backgrounds should receive less
aid.
There is one way in which
Stanford can help the less wealthy
student. Rents in Escondido
Village are 30 to 40 dollars a
month less than similar
apartments in the Palo Alto and
surrounding areas. Those students
who live in Escondido can be
regarded as receiving an additional
300 to 400 dollar a year
scholarship from the university.
Since not all graduate students
can live in Escondido —There is a
long waiting list and an immediate
need to construct perhaps 1000 to
1500 more spaces beyond the
current additions—the university
should assign spaces in Escondido
to relatively less affluent students,
giving this 300 to 400 dollar
annual scholarship to those who
need it most.
Bias Toward Poor
This would mean the
development of a "means test"
for Escondido. Students with
family incomes or assets greater
than X dollars would not be
accomodated in the Village until
all students with incomes or assets
below X dollars had been
accomodated. For example, there
are some families in the Village
with annual incomes of 10 and 12
thousand dollars or more while
some off-campus families deep in
debt are being gouged by local
landlords.

An alternative to this plan
would be the use of a differential
rate structure (quite difficult to
administer) which would charge
different monthly rents for the
same type of apartment,
according to the income and
assets of the occupants. This would
preserve the socio-economic
balance of Escondido, but the
complexities of administration
might prove very costly.
Of course, this whole approach
obscures a basic Stanford
problem. We need more housing
(Surprise!). My plan is only an
attempt to more equitably
distribute a scarce resource. In my
next column I'll talk about what's
wrong with present housing
priorities and how current policies
make for many dull places to live.

annual scholarship to those who
need it most.
Bias Toward Poor
This would mean the
development of a "means test"
for Escondido. Students with
family incomes or assets greater
than X dollars would not be
accomodated in the Village until
all students with incomes or assets
below X dollars had been
accomodated. For example, there
are some families in the Village
with annual incomes of 10 and 12
thousand dollars or more while
some off-campus families deep in
debt are being gouged by local
landlords.

An alternative to this plan
would be the use of a differential
rate structure (quite difficult to
administer) which would charge
different monthly rents for the
same type of apartment,
according to the income and
assets of the occupants. This would
preserve the socio-economic
balance of Escondido, but the
complexities of administration
might prove very costly.
Of course, this whole approach
obscures a basic Stanford
problem. We need more housing
(Surprise!). My plan is only an
attempt to more equitably
distribute a scarce resource. In my
next column I'll talk about what's
wrong with present housing
priorities and how current policies
make for many dull places to live.

Last week I wrote about the
necessity for introducing a need
factor into graduate student
fellowship support. At the present
time most awards are based solely
on merit. In a time of shrinking
graduate support and growing
commitments to enroll more
minority graduate students, there
is a clear conflict inherent in
current policy. Support in the
professional schools —law,
medicine, and business—as well as
in undergraduate years, is based
on need. I was simply arguing that
other graduate aid should mov6 in
that direction.
If we are going to have more
students from less affluent
backgrounds, the money has to
come from somewhere, and since
the government is cutting back on
fellowship funds, that means that
students from relatively wealthy
backgrounds should receive less
aid.
There is one way in which
Stanford can help the less wealthy
student. Rents in Escondido
Village are 30 to 40 dollars a
month less than similar
apartments in the Palo Alto and
surrounding areas. Those students
who live in Escondido can be
regarded as receiving an additional
300 to 400 dollar a year
scholarship from the university.
Since not all graduate students
can live in Escondido —There is a
long waiting list and an immediate
need to construct perhaps 1000 to
1500 more spaces beyond the
current additions—the university
should assign spaces in Escondido
to relatively less affluent students,
giving this 300 to 400 dollar
annual scholarship to those who
need it most.
