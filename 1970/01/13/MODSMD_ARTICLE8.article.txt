# The 						Dillingham Issue
## House People, Not Profits 
### Lee Herzenberg 
The Southwest corner of El
Camino and Page Mill Road, now
occupied by several peaceful
horses grazing in a fenced,
uncultivated field, is about to
erupt into a modern, elegant
center of high finance, replete
with two 10-story office towers, a
17-story hotel convention center
and 13 acres of hardtop for
parking.
Stanford, owner of the land,
has agreed to a lease (not yet
signed) which will give a return of
about $120,000 a year and allow
Stanford to gather all the benefits
it can from having a large business
and financial center in such close
proximity.
The Palo Alto Planning
Commission and Palo Alto City
Council, charged with regulating
the use of land in Palo Alto for
the best long-term interests of all
its citizens, passed the entire
project within four months of its
proposal, giving no attention to
the combined increase in traffic at
Page Mill and El Camino from this
project and the Coyote Hill
Industrial Park but insisting on
the addition of another 100 trees
to the parking lot plans to
increase the aesthetic view for
passers-by.
Viewed by itself, Palo Alto
Square would be another
architectural monstrosity, set in a
location certain to further
increase the frustration of the
ordinary man trying to drive
home after a long day at work,
offering services to an elite group
who already get more than their
share of the resources of the area.
It will also have a potentially
catastrophic effect on the
already-impossible local housing
market. As it was vainly argued to
the city Planning Commission, the
complex will rapidly increase the
commercial demand for
surrounding land, driving up land
"values." This will jeopardize the
nearby residential areas, which
now provide most of the only
reasonably-priced housing in Palo
Alto. In addition, the complex
will bring 1,500 more employees
into the area to compete for
housing. Rents will continue to
soar, and the lowest-paid workers
will be forced to live farther from
their jobs.
But the full picture only
emerges when the project is
considered in relation to the rest

of the planned construction in the
area: Palo Alto Square is the
major cog of a series of high rise
buildings intended for
construction in the early 1970's
which will convert Palo Alto into
a "skyline" city making Palo Alto
the industrial and financial hub of
a highly developed peninsula.
For example, just noting
publicly discussed plans, there are
6 more acres on the northwest
corner of Page Mill and El Camino
for which office buildings are
being proposed; Coyote Hill, an
extension of Stanford Industrial
Park, south and west of Page Mill
Road is planned to bring in 12
factories and 5,000 more
employees; a "superblock"
financial center in downtown Palo
Alto; a huge new hospital complex
near the Palo Alto Clinic, again
downtown, which will provide
highly specialized and profitable
geriatric medicinal care for
patients from the entire Bay Area.
Add these to the already
existing Hare, Brewer & Kelley
Building on University Avenue,
the grandiose new City Hall
Building at Hamilton and Gryant,
and the picture is clear. Owners of
small businesses and homes
sandwiched between these giants
will not be able or even want to
resist the pressures to sell, so that
by the end of the 1970's
residential areas in the central
sections of Palo Alto, opposite
Stanford, will be a thing of the
past. Commuting to suburban
areas like Hayward, Fremont and
Cupertino will be commonplace,
made tolerable by a network of
expressways around and between
the skyscrapers.
Stanford, long known as "The
Farm" will probably try to keep
this identity in spite of finding
itself increasingly surrounded by
city. An island of green, it will
probably try to preserve the few
open spaces left on campus by
using more of its undeveloped
land in the foothills to provide
housing for faculty and students
who would otherwise have to
commute long distances or pay
high rents in the city.
But what, then, for the
development of Page Mill and El
Camino? Here is a valuable piece
of undeveloped land, close to
shops, schools, what little public
transportation there is — easily

accessible to most of Palo Alto
and Stanford. Are there uses to
which it could be put which
would serve the needs of the
people of the area and break the
chain of pro 112 i t•making
overdevelopment of the Palo Alto
Area? Several suggestions come to
mind, perhaps others will be
forthcoming if the creative
energies of the community are
focused in this direction.
It should be possible to put a
park on the site. Certainly the
young people of Stanford and the
community would be well served,
especially if the park contained
adequate facilities for large rock
concerts and be-ins, as well as for
out-door symphony concerts and
plays. Nearby,a large
community hall could house
indoor concerts and large
meetings and double as a
community center for teenagers
when not in use.
But perhaps better still, the
area could be used for low and
moderate cost housing. Stanford
has already proposed several
smaller parcels along Page Mill
Road as possible housing sites.
Were these grouped together, and
the site next to Hewlett Packard
and the northwest corner of El
Camino added to the package,
a neighborhood linking College
Terrace and Barron Park could be
created. Residents could walk to
the California Avenue shopping
center, S.P. station, Greyhound
stop and bike to Stanford and the
Industrial Park. Creative
architecture could block out El
Camino traffic, or use the
frontage for shops serving the
housing area.
The big question is not, at this
moment, what should be built at
Page Mill and El Camino. There is
still time for the community to
decide that, and it should be a
community decision. The urgent
question is whether the business
office at Stanford, and the
absentee landlord Board of
Trustees, shall be allowed to
squander a valuable resource of
the community, the last large
vacant land parcel close into
town, for a handful of silver,
which probably, in the end, will
go to pay for the wages of sin
inherent in the project.
