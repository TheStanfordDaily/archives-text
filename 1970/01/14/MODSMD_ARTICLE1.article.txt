# No New Research Restrictions
## SKI To Buy Its Independence 
### BOB MICHELET 
Final agreement for the
separation of Stanford University
and the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) was announced
yesterday by the Board of
Trustees.
SRI will pay the university $25
million at the rate of one percent
of its gross operating revenue a
year, starting in 1971. After that
total is reached, SRI will continue
indefinately to pay the university
one half of one percent of its
revenues for its independence.
SRI was the focus of
demonstrations against
war-related research last spring,
and University polls favored
limiting the kinds of work it could
do. Restrictions imposed on
biological warfare research last
spring will be continued, but no
legal provision was made in the
agreement to place further
restrictions on work done at SRI.
The agreement was announced
jointly by Trustees President W.
Parmer Fuller and SRI Board
Chairman Ernest C. Arbuckle.
Under terms of the agreement,
SRI will remain a non-profit
research organization, but without
legal ties to Stanford. It will
continue to use the name
Stanford Research Institute for no
longer than five years.
Control Relinquished
In addition, the Trustees will
relinquish control of SRI,
including the authority to elect
the governing SRI Board. In the
future, the SRI Board will fill its
own vacancies and have sole
responsibility for Institute
policies.
Yesterday's action was

described as a final agreement in
principle with contractual
arrangements and legal work to be
completed later. The decision to
separate SRI and Stanford was
made by the Trustees last May.
Stanford's relation with the
Institute was the cause of student
demonstrations last spring,
including two sit-ins and a
demonstration at the Hanover
Street SRI facility that resulted in
1 00 arrests.
Protest focused on war-related
research being conducted at SRI,
particularly that in chemical and
biological warfare methods.
The announcement yesterday
came nearly one year after
students raided a Trustees meeting
at the Faculty Club, one of the
first major incidents in the
controversy over SRI research
policy.
Severence Recommended
Last spring, a 12-member
student-faculty committee
recommended severence as well as
restraints on the type of research
at SRI. Yesterday's
announcement made no reference
to any such guidelines.
Fuller noted that the successful
performance of the agreement
depends on the financial
condition of SRI and said
important " consideration will be
given that factor in applying
provisions of the contract.
In the joint announcement,
Fuller and Arbuckle said the final
plans were reached after
considering a number of
alternatives of carrying out the
May decision.
They added the agreement was
reached after consultation with a

"wide variety of interested
parties," including members of
the university and Institute
communities.
Benefits Noted
'We believe that today's
agreement is in the best interest of
both the university and the
Institute and that it will work to
the long-run benefits of each,"
they said.
SRI President Charles
Anderson agreed that the move
would be in the best interests of
both institutions.
"We are pleased the matter is
finally settled in that it removes
some of the uncertainties under
which we have been operating
since last May," he said.
Stanford President Kenneth
Pitzer commented on the decision
in a statement that stressed the
financial aspects of the agreement.
"The final agreement by the
Board of Trustees fully and
equitably recognizes their basic
responsibility for the long run
financial welfare of the
university," he said.
"The agreement is in keeping
with the Faculty Senate
Resolution of Nov. 13, 1969,
which also recognized 'the serious
financial problems confronting
the university and their
implications for desirable
educational innovations and for
appropriate salary scales."
Financial Gap Cited
Pitzer cited a possible gap of
several million dollars between
revenues and needs of Stanford by
the end of the decade and added
"a portion of the prospective

revenue from the separation of
SRI may be used to help finance
education and research in new
areas of broad concern to faculty
and students."
A meeting was held early
yesterday afternoon to announce
the decision to selected faculty
and students. The story, however,
had already been printed in the
Palo Alto Times.
Students at the meeting were
Pat Shea, representing the Council
of Presidents, and John Shoch,
vice-chairman of the student
Senate. Faculty included the
heads of university departments
and schools and the faculty
Senate Steering Committee.
Questions during the meeting
focused on who was consulted in
the move, the base for the
financial arrangements and if
chemical and biological warfare
restrictions would be maintained.
It was indicated that last spring's
temporary restrictions would be
continued.
SRI was founded by Stanford
in 194 6 to "promote the
educational purposes of
(Stanford) by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research . . . and to extend
scientific knowledge in the several
pursuits and professions of life."
Research Provided
SRI provides specialized
research services to business,
industry, foundations and the
go ernment. More than 70
percent of its project revenue
comes from government sources,
and nearly three-fourths of that
sum is from military research.
SRI presently employees about

3,000 persons and is now a global
operation.
Autonomy Favored
In a survey last spring, 72
percent of SRl's staff favored
independence, while only 10
percent endorsed closer ties.
Ninety-one percent preferred that
"research policy at SRI should be
determined by procedures
established by the SRI
management and staff."
Those majority opinions are in
line with the new arrangement.
The Institute presently
undertakes about 750 new
research projects each year in
various fields. Its revenues last
year totaled approximately $58
million.
That sum makes the yearly
payments by SRI under the new
agreement about $580,000. At
that rate, it would take 43 years
to pay off the debt, but
anticipated growth by SRI should
decrease that time considerably.

TRUSTEE VISITâ€”The Board of Trustees concluded a two-day series of meetings
on campus yesterday. They discussed Pres. Pitzer's ban on athletics with BYU but
did not overturn the ruling; pursuant to a Board directive, final plans were
completed for severing Stanford Research Institute from the University.
