Maury T. Contradicted
Editor, TIIF. DAILY:
I would like to fnake a brief
comment on a letter from a Mr.
Maury Travis which appeared in
the Daily on January 12. My first
reaction upon reading the same
letter in the Palo Alto Times
several weeks ago was to write a
letter of reassurance to Arab
students at Stanford. However, I
quickly came to the conclusion
that no one would take thy letter
seriously and decided not to call
any further attention to it. I am
always surprised to find our
newspapers printing letters of this
kind.
Since it now has appeared in
the Daily, I do feel it is essential
that all students studying at
Stanford who are not U.S. citizens
be reassured that no authority
rests with the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service nor
with the Institute for
International Education, to
"investigate" or to initiate
"proceedings leading to
deportation" of any foreign
students because of their
participation in political activity
while in this country. I also know
of no instance in which such
action has ever been attempted at
Stanford. I believe the dancer of

deportation would exist only if a
student were arrested and
convicted of a serious crime.
If any foreign student is
personally harassed or threatened
by anyone, including persons
claiming to represent the United
States Government, for being
outspoken on political matters or
for participating in political
activities I urge him to let me
know. 1 would then take
appropriate action as a
representative of this university to
protect the student.
