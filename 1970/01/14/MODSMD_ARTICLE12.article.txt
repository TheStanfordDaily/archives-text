# Moratorium Highlight
## Memorial Service Thurs. 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
Smaller meetings will replace
massive marches and trudging
through the rain in this month's
Vietnam Moratorium.
Again focusing on the 15th of
the month as the prime day for
action, leaders of the Stanford
Moratorium and the New
Mobilization-West have laid plans
for a number of anti-war
activities.
At Stanford, the center of
attention will be a mass Town
Meeting, tomorrow at 8:15 p.m.
in Memorial Church. The
community meeting, to be chaired
by Rabbi Sidney Akselrad of

Congregation Beth Am in Los
Altos Hills, will feature a
memorial tribute to the late Rev.
Martin Luther King, Jr., whose
birthdate was Jan. 15.
James Simmons, assistant to
President Kenneth Pitzer, will give
the memorial address, which will
be followed by taped excerpts
from a speech by King. The theme
of the meeting will be "Peace in
Vietnam and Peace at Home,"
two dreams of King which
coincide with the Moratorium's
goals.
Madeline Duckies will report at
the meeting on her "mercy
mission" to North Vietnam. Mrs.

Duckies and her traveling
companion, Mrs. Cora Weiss,
returned last month from a
two-week stay in North Vietnam.
They brought back names of
some of the American war
prisoners and messages from the
prisoners to American families.
Mrs. Duckies is chairman of the
San Francisco Committee of
Responsibility.
S lan l ord Speakers
Also on the program for the
evening are David R. Hawk, one
of the four originators of the
Vietnam Moratorium and a
member of the national
committee; John E. Thorne, San
Jose attorney active in the
Committee for a Direct Attack on
the Legality of the Vietnam War;
and Stanford English professor
Albert Guerard, who will close the
meeting with a reading of a story
about the massacre at My Lai.
An important part of the
gathering will be the actual Town
Meeting that will follow the
speeches. The meeting will be held
in an "open mike" format, with
anyone present allowed to speak.
The meeting will deal in part with
possible action the community
discussion groups can take in the
coming weeks. But it is hoped
new ideas and suggestions, as well
as action will be generated.
In the Bay Area, a peaceful
sit-in is planned for this morning
at the Oakland Induction Center.
The sit-in, organized by the
American Friends Service
Committee, is one of many

non-violent obstructions of
induction centers in major cities
around the country today.
Some see these sit-ins as the
first step in a nationwide program
of civil disobedience organized by
anti-war leaders to protest the
draft.
SF Rally
Tomorrow, a rally to honor
King will be held in front of the
Federal Building in San Francisco,
450 Golden Gate Avenue. The
.ally, organized by the San
Francisco Moratorium and New
Mobe-West in conjunction with
the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, "will protest
repression of political dissenters
and black and brown people in
the United States, as well as
urging an immediate withdrawal
of American forces from
Vietnam."
Speakers will include Dr.
Carlton G oodlett, physician,
publisher, and member of the
Mobe steering committee; Paul
McMahon, a Vietnam Veteran;
and a representative of the
Welfare Rights Organization.
A list of "American victims of
racism and repression who have
been killed or jailed during the
past decade" will be read at the
rally. In addition, a number of
churches in San Francisco will
ring bells at noon tomorrow in
memoriam to Dr. King and as
witness for American desire for
peace.

activities.
At Stanford, the center of
attention will be a mass Town
Meeting, tomorrow at 8:15 p.m.
in Memorial Church. The
community meeting, to be chaired
by Rabbi Sidney Akselrad of

Congregation Beth Am in Los
Altos Hills, will feature a
memorial tribute to the late Rev.
Martin Luther King, Jr., whose
birthdate was Jan. 15.
James Simmons, assistant to
President Kenneth Pitzer, will give
the memorial address, which will
be followed by taped excerpts
from a speech by King. The theme
of the meeting will be "Peace in
Vietnam and Peace at Home,"
two dreams of King which
coincide with the Moratorium's
goals.
Madeline Duckies will report at
the meeting on her "mercy
mission" to North Vietnam. Mrs.

Duckies and her traveling
companion, Mrs. Cora Weiss,
returned last month from a
two-week stay in North Vietnam.
They brought back names of
some of the American war
prisoners and messages from the
prisoners to American families.
Mrs. Duckies is chairman of the
San Francisco Committee of
Responsibility.
S lan l ord Speakers
Also on the program for the
evening are David R. Hawk, one
of the four originators of the
Vietnam Moratorium and a
member of the national
committee; John E. Thorne, San
Jose attorney active in the
Committee for a Direct Attack on
the Legality of the Vietnam War;
and Stanford English professor
Albert Guerard, who will close the
meeting with a reading of a story
about the massacre at My Lai.
An important part of the
gathering will be the actual Town
Meeting that will follow the
speeches. The meeting will be held
in an "open mike" format, with
anyone present allowed to speak.
The meeting will deal in part with
possible action the community
discussion groups can take in the
coming weeks. But it is hoped
new ideas and suggestions, as well
as action will be generated.
In the Bay Area, a peaceful
sit-in is planned for this morning
at the Oakland Induction Center.
The sit-in, organized by the
American Friends Service
Committee, is one of many

non-violent obstructions of
induction centers in major cities
around the country today.
Some see these sit-ins as the
first step in a nationwide program
of civil disobedience organized by
anti-war leaders to protest the
draft.
SF Rally
Tomorrow, a rally to honor
King will be held in front of the
Federal Building in San Francisco,
450 Golden Gate Avenue. The
.ally, organized by the San
Francisco Moratorium and New
Mobe-West in conjunction with
the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, "will protest
repression of political dissenters
and black and brown people in
the United States, as well as
urging an immediate withdrawal
of American forces from
Vietnam."
Speakers will include Dr.
Carlton G oodlett, physician,
publisher, and member of the
Mobe steering committee; Paul
McMahon, a Vietnam Veteran;
and a representative of the
Welfare Rights Organization.
A list of "American victims of
racism and repression who have
been killed or jailed during the
past decade" will be read at the
rally. In addition, a number of
churches in San Francisco will
ring bells at noon tomorrow in
memoriam to Dr. King and as
witness for American desire for
peace.
