# Jurist Views High Court

### 
In the permanent conflict
between law and society, the
Supreme Court's duty is to supply
a "working agreement" or
common balance between them, a
leading woman jurist told the
Stanford Faculty Women's Club
Monday.
Shirley Hufstedler, a judge in
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth District (Los Angeles),
conceded to the 150 women
present that she herself doesn't
always agree with some judges and
some decisions.
"But," she said, "there must be
only one law for the good and the
bad, the white or the colored, the
rich or the poor. "Justice for
some means justice for none," she
said.
Mrs. Hufstedler, a graduate of
Stanford Law School, analyzed
the history of the Supreme Court
and the reasons for some of the
attacks on it."The court is
attacked, she said, because it is
one of the three heads of the U.S.
government; its work is not
understood; it is not democratic;
and it is "the ultimate arbiter of
issues which most deeply divide
our nation."
The court is not democratic
and not elective for very good
reasons â€”to safeguard it against all
political and social pressures, and
"to keep it above the hysteria"
which has prevailed in the
country, particularly by current
crises like the Vietnam war, and
racial tension.
The court, in short, must make
the final decisions, and as with
most decision-makers, it can never
please everybody.
