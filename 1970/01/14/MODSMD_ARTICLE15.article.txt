# 'Cage' Is Vehicle For Confrontation
## 
### ROBIN LAKE 
Ex-convicts cannot vote, so
how can they elect people who
favor penal reform? San Quentin
originally designed to hold 2800
men, now houses over 4000. We
support the prison system with
millions of tax dollars. There are
over half a million people in U.S.
prisons; the rate of recidivism is
over 80% and the crime rate
continues to climb. What can you
do about it?
For a small but worthwhile
start you can go see the Barbwire
Theater's production of The Cage
which opened in Dinkelspiel last
Friday.
All eight members of the
company are ex-convicts, four of
them with over thirty years
between them in San Quentin.
The Cage is more of an
hors-d'oeuvre than a
chef-d'oeuvre. Author Rick
Cluchey has written this prison
drama with the purpose of
educating the public, not only as
to the necessity for penal reform
but more so for a long hard look at
the socioeconomic causes for
crime. The Barbwire Theater is
attempting to fight the causes
rather than the product. To this
end, the second half of the
evening - and the real meat - is a
"confrontation" or
question-answer period between
performers and public.
Heavy Opening
The Cage opens strong with
sterile P.A. announcements and
stark setting - a single central
"john" in a bare cell. Prison
environment depicts the sadism of
the guards, homosexuality (what
else? when men are deprived of all
female contact - even Playboy!),
and the power-plays and wary
confrontations between the
prisoners.
Conflict is heightened through
the introduction of an outsider
into the established status quo. In
this instance Jive, % fair-hared
first-timer Jof Jailing his
teenage girlfriend, is -thrust into
the cell wtth three hardened
Hatchet, an arsonist,
'has?t|e«n inside for eighteen years
and is obviously a nut acting out
his favorite power fantasies as the
General, judge and God. Al, the
cripple, who carries a blade,
suffers from classic insecurity, is
the target of everyones' wrath and
in turn projects his frustrations on
Jive.
Cons Play Games
The other member of the cell,
Doc, the most intelligent, tries to
play both ends of the stick as well
as the middle. Under the guise of
protector he initiates the bound
blinfolded and unwilling Jive at
the expense of Al's jealousy. Doc
tries to placate the fanatic
Hatchet by playing along and
out-thinking him at his own
games. Once he even allows his
"cool" to slip in a genuine
moment of concern when Hatchet
and Al are being worked over by
the guards - a protest which only
boomerangs. Most of the hour and

a half is filled with the "games"
the three cons play around Jive.
The actors generally perform
well. Ernie Allen as Doc is
especially impressive, with
Randolph Dobbs (Jive) and
author Rick Cluchey (Hatchet)
turning in strong performances.
The latters' maniacal portrayal is
often criticised as overdone or out
of place, to which Mr. Cluchey
has an answer. Robert Poole as Al
is less effective since much of his
excellent characterisation is lost
through a lack of vocal clarity, a
problem compounded in the
direction by the fact that he
continually upstages himself.
Visual Effects
Apart from this, director Ken
Whelan manages his material and
cast with ingenuity. There are
several visual highlites including
the opening scene, the epileptic fit
counterpointed against a casual
argument, and the multiple uses
of the toilet-altar.
If the play 'is deliberately
underwritten and often
underplayed to make it more
palatable, perhaps Mr. Cluchey
underestimates his public bred on
T.V., Viet Nam, Marat/Sade,
Artaud and Westerns. It seemed to
me the play lost considerable
focus and bite in an effort to woo
the public through humor - and
what could have been an
essentially thoughtful audience, as
was later demonstrated during tne
question period, relapsed
astonishingly for the greater part
into a sickly sympathetic giggling
morass.
I do not think this is the
reaction The Cage is aiming for or
merits. It is a fault in the direction
that the audience can be laughing
at and perhaps missing
the societal parallels.
No Comedy in Cage
' There is nothing inherently
comic about men caged like
animals or on trial for their lives. I
for one found their desperate
efforts to "structure their time"
(as Dr. Eric Berne puts it in
Games People Play,) not only
savage but heart-rending.
However, there was none of the
power that I had been led to
expect. The only two memorable
moments were one of Hatchet's
monologues and Al's speech for
the prosecution with us as the
silent acquiescent jury.
Certainly there are moments of
genuine humor, as well there
needs be to prevent us joining
Hatchet around his bend, but such
moments should be the exception
or they lose their cathartic value
and become easy laugh lines lost
in waves of uncomfortable
sniggers.
Confrontation Highlight
Treading a precarious line
twixt drama and social
commentary, educational theater
and documentary, the real success
of The Cage is apparent in the
confrontation period. Ably
chaired by director Ken Whelan,
the company answers with a show
of honesty, warmth, and above all
a self-assurance that does more to

impress themselves on our
consciousness than the play.
Given that The Cage is a
necessary vehicle to provide a
common starting point, I would
suggest cutting half an hour off
the play and adding it to the
discussion period which is the
raison d'etre and really scores.
Theater Fills Gap
Not yet a year old The
Barbwire Theater is a vital
example of a most effective
rehabilitationary venture - one
that is self-motivated by the men
themselves. The first six months
outside are the hardest, without
friends, money or a job, and The
Barbwire Theater is attempting to
fill that gap and provide a training
ground leading to re-integration
into society.
It is obviously not every
convict's way back but the idea
holds valid and the proofs of
success are before us. I wish them
the best of luck and support in
their well-deserved efforts. The
Cage will be repeated this
weekend, Friday and Saturday at
8:00 p.m. and Sunday at 7:00

of honesty, warmth, and above all
a self-assurance that does more to

impress themselves on our
consciousness than the play.
Given that The Cage is a
necessary vehicle to provide a

suggest cutting half an hour off
the play and adding it to the
discussion period which is the
raison d'etre and really scores.
Theater Fills Gap
Not yet a year old The
Barbwire Theater is a vital
example of a most effective
rehabilitationary venture - one
that is self-motivated by the men
themselves. The first six months
outside are the hardest, without
friends, money or a job, and The
Barbwire Theater is attempting to
fill that gap and provide a training
ground leading to re-integration
into society.
It is obviously not every
convict's way back but the idea
holds valid and the proofs of
success are before us. I wish them
the best of luck and support in
their well-deserved efforts. The
Cage will be repeated this
weekend, Friday and Saturday at
8:00 p.m. and Sunday at 7:00
p.m.
Ex-convicts cannot vote, so
how can they elect people who
favor penal reform? San Quentin
originally designed to hold 2800
men, now houses over 4000. We
support the prison system with
millions of tax dollars. There are
over half a million people in U.S.
prisons; the rate of recidivism is
over 80% and the crime rate
continues to climb. What can you
do about it?
For a small but worthwhile
start you can go see the Barbwire
Theater's production of The Cage
which opened in Dinkelspiel last
Friday.
All eight members of the
company are ex-convicts, four of
them with over thirty years
between them in San Quentin.
The Cage is more of an
hors-d'oeuvre than a
chef-d'oeuvre. Author Rick
Cluchey has written this prison
drama with the purpose of
educating the public, not only as
to the necessity for penal reform
but more so for a long hard look at
the socioeconomic causes for
crime. The Barbwire Theater is
attempting to fight the causes
rather than the product. To this
end, the second half of the
evening - and the real meat - is a
"confrontation" or
question-answer period between
performers and public.
Heavy Opening
The Cage opens strong with
sterile P.A. announcements and
stark setting - a single central
"john" in a bare cell. Prison
environment depicts the sadism of
the guards, homosexuality (what
else? when men are deprived of all
female contact - even Playboy!),
and the power-plays and wary
confrontations between the
prisoners.
Conflict is heightened through
the introduction of an outsider
into the established status quo. In
this instance Jive, % fair-hared
first-timer Jof Jailing his
teenage girlfriend, is -thrust into
the cell wtth three hardened
Hatchet, an arsonist,
'has?t|e«n inside for eighteen years
and is obviously a nut acting out
his favorite power fantasies as the
General, judge and God. Al, the
cripple, who carries a blade,
suffers from classic insecurity, is
the target of everyones' wrath and
in turn projects his frustrations on
Jive.
Cons Play Games
The other member of the cell,
Doc, the most intelligent, tries to
play both ends of the stick as well
as the middle. Under the guise of
protector he initiates the bound
blinfolded and unwilling Jive at
the expense of Al's jealousy. Doc
tries to placate the fanatic
Hatchet by playing along and
out-thinking him at his own
games. Once he even allows his
"cool" to slip in a genuine
moment of concern when Hatchet
and Al are being worked over by
the guards - a protest which only
boomerangs. Most of the hour and

a half is filled with the "games"
the three cons play around Jive.
The actors generally perform
well. Ernie Allen as Doc is
especially impressive, with
Randolph Dobbs (Jive) and
author Rick Cluchey (Hatchet)
turning in strong performances.
The latters' maniacal portrayal is
often criticised as overdone or out
of place, to which Mr. Cluchey
has an answer. Robert Poole as Al
is less effective since much of his
excellent characterisation is lost
through a lack of vocal clarity, a
problem compounded in the
direction by the fact that he
continually upstages himself.
Visual Effects
Apart from this, director Ken
Whelan manages his material and
cast with ingenuity. There are
several visual highlites including
the opening scene, the epileptic fit
counterpointed against a casual
argument, and the multiple uses
of the toilet-altar.
If the play 'is deliberately
underwritten and often
underplayed to make it more
palatable, perhaps Mr. Cluchey
underestimates his public bred on
T.V., Viet Nam, Marat/Sade,
Artaud and Westerns. It seemed to
me the play lost considerable
focus and bite in an effort to woo
the public through humor - and
what could have been an
essentially thoughtful audience, as
was later demonstrated during tne
question period, relapsed
astonishingly for the greater part
into a sickly sympathetic giggling
morass.
I do not think this is the
reaction The Cage is aiming for or
merits. It is a fault in the direction
that the audience can be laughing
at and perhaps missing
the societal parallels.
No Comedy in Cage
' There is nothing inherently
comic about men caged like
animals or on trial for their lives. I
for one found their desperate
efforts to "structure their time"
(as Dr. Eric Berne puts it in
Games People Play,) not only
savage but heart-rending.
However, there was none of the
power that I had been led to
expect. The only two memorable
moments were one of Hatchet's
monologues and Al's speech for
the prosecution with us as the
silent acquiescent jury.
Certainly there are moments of
genuine humor, as well there
needs be to prevent us joining
Hatchet around his bend, but such
moments should be the exception
or they lose their cathartic value
and become easy laugh lines lost
in waves of uncomfortable
sniggers.
Confrontation Highlight
Treading a precarious line
twixt drama and social
commentary, educational theater
and documentary, the real success
of The Cage is apparent in the
confrontation period. Ably
chaired by director Ken Whelan,
the company answers with a show
of honesty, warmth, and above all
a self-assurance that does more to

impress themselves on our
consciousness than the play.

No Comedy in Cage
' There is nothing inherently
comic about men caged like
animals or on trial for their lives. I
for one found their desperate
efforts to "structure their time"
(as Dr. Eric Berne puts it in
Games People Play,) not only
savage but heart-rending.
However, there was none of the
power that I had been led to
expect. The only two memorable
moments were one of Hatchet's
monologues and Al's speech for
the prosecution with us as the
silent acquiescent jury.
Certainly there are moments of
genuine humor, as well there
needs be to prevent us joining
Hatchet around his bend, but such
moments should be the exception
or they lose their cathartic value
and become easy laugh lines lost
in waves of uncomfortable
sniggers.
Confrontation Highlight
Treading a precarious line
twixt drama and social
commentary, educational theater
and documentary, the real success
of The Cage is apparent in the
confrontation period. Ably
chaired by director Ken Whelan,
the company answers with a show
of honesty, warmth, and above all
a self-assurance that does more to

impress themselves on our
consciousness than the play.
Given that The Cage is a
necessary vehicle to provide a
common starting point, I would
suggest cutting half an hour off
the play and adding it to the
discussion period which is the
raison d'etre and really scores.
Theater Fills Gap
Not yet a year old The
Barbwire Theater is a vital
example of a most effective
rehabilitationary venture - one
that is self-motivated by the men
themselves. The first six months
outside are the hardest, without
friends, money or a job, and The
Barbwire Theater is attempting to
fill that gap and provide a training
ground leading to re-integration
into society.
It is obviously not every
convict's way back but the idea
holds valid and the proofs of
success are before us. I wish them
the best of luck and support in
their well-deserved efforts. The
Cage will be repeated this
weekend, Friday and Saturday at
8:00 p.m. and Sunday at 7:00
p.m.
Ex-convicts cannot vote, so
how can they elect people who
favor penal reform? San Quentin
originally designed to hold 2800
men, now houses over 4000. We
support the prison system with
millions of tax dollars. There are
over half a million people in U.S.
prisons; the rate of recidivism is
over 80% and the crime rate
continues to climb. What can you
do about it?
For a small but worthwhile
start you can go see the Barbwire
Theater's production of The Cage
which opened in Dinkelspiel last
Friday.
All eight members of the
company are ex-convicts, four of
them with over thirty years
between them in San Quentin.
The Cage is more of an
hors-d'oeuvre than a
chef-d'oeuvre. Author Rick
Cluchey has written this prison
drama with the purpose of
educating the public, not only as
to the necessity for penal reform
but more so for a long hard look at
the socioeconomic causes for
crime. The Barbwire Theater is
attempting to fight the causes
rather than the product. To this
end, the second half of the
evening - and the real meat - is a
"confrontation" or
question-answer period between
performers and public.
Heavy Opening
The Cage opens strong with
sterile P.A. announcements and
stark setting - a single central
"john" in a bare cell. Prison
environment depicts the sadism of
the guards, homosexuality (what
else? when men are deprived of all
female contact - even Playboy!),
and the power-plays and wary
confrontations between the
prisoners.
Conflict is heightened through
the introduction of an outsider
into the established status quo. In
this instance Jive, % fair-hared
first-timer Jof Jailing his
teenage girlfriend, is -thrust into
the cell wtth three hardened
Hatchet, an arsonist,
'has?t|e«n inside for eighteen years
and is obviously a nut acting out
his favorite power fantasies as the
General, judge and God. Al, the
cripple, who carries a blade,
suffers from classic insecurity, is
the target of everyones' wrath and
in turn projects his frustrations on
Jive.
Cons Play Games
The other member of the cell,
Doc, the most intelligent, tries to
play both ends of the stick as well
as the middle. Under the guise of
protector he initiates the bound
blinfolded and unwilling Jive at
the expense of Al's jealousy. Doc
tries to placate the fanatic
Hatchet by playing along and
out-thinking him at his own
games. Once he even allows his
"cool" to slip in a genuine
moment of concern when Hatchet
and Al are being worked over by
the guards - a protest which only
boomerangs. Most of the hour and

a half is filled with the "games"
the three cons play around Jive.
The actors generally perform
well. Ernie Allen as Doc is
especially impressive, with
Randolph Dobbs (Jive) and
author Rick Cluchey (Hatchet)
turning in strong performances.
The latters' maniacal portrayal is
often criticised as overdone or out
of place, to which Mr. Cluchey
has an answer. Robert Poole as Al
is less effective since much of his
excellent characterisation is lost
through a lack of vocal clarity, a
problem compounded in the
direction by the fact that he
continually upstages himself.
Visual Effects
Apart from this, director Ken
Whelan manages his material and
cast with ingenuity. There are
several visual highlites including
the opening scene, the epileptic fit
counterpointed against a casual
argument, and the multiple uses
of the toilet-altar.
If the play 'is deliberately
underwritten and often
underplayed to make it more
palatable, perhaps Mr. Cluchey
underestimates his public bred on
T.V., Viet Nam, Marat/Sade,
Artaud and Westerns. It seemed to
me the play lost considerable
focus and bite in an effort to woo
the public through humor - and
what could have been an
essentially thoughtful audience, as
was later demonstrated during tne
question period, relapsed
astonishingly for the greater part
into a sickly sympathetic giggling
morass.
I do not think this is the
reaction The Cage is aiming for or
merits. It is a fault in the direction
that the audience can be laughing
at and perhaps missing
the societal parallels.
