## Necrology 1969 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Looking over any year's
obituary list for film personalities
can very easily render the
concerned observer extremely
melancholy. It is inevitable that
each year, many actors, actresses,
directors and even obscure
technicians that we have known
and loved on screen will pass on.
These artists, at least the good
ones, have involved the public in
their own personalities and have,
in their own way, become a part
of our own emotional
autobiographies.
In retrospect, it is occasionally
tempting to grant the label of
"great artist" to some perennial
performers or dedicated
entertainers. At the same time,
post mortum career
summarizations can provide
factual evidence to slander those
people whose work we did not
care for. No matter. Following is a
list of those tilm personalities who
died during 1969, with brief notes
on those less well known.
Garland, Karloff
Charles Brackett, who co-wrote
with Billy Wilder some of the
latter's best films; Eduardo
Ciannelli, one of the great
character actors of all-time and
who had the misfortune of
playing his last role in The Secret
of Santa Victoria; Karl Freund,
cinematographer on such early
landmark films as Last Laugh,
Metropolis and Variety; Judy
Garland; Leo Gorcey,
wise-cracking leader of the
Bowery Boys; Sonja Henie, ice
skater cum actress; Martita Hunt,
British grands dame; Jeffrey
Hunter, dubiously remembered
for turning King of Kings into "I
Was a Teen-Age Jesus;" Boris
Karloff.

Frank Lawton, most
memorable as the grown-up half
of David Copperfield; Leo
McCarey, director of Going My
Way and such classics as Duck
Soup and Ruggles of Red Gap;
Eric Portman, British actor;
Thelma Ritter, one of our greatest
character actresses, a six-time
nominee for an Academy Award,
winner of none.
Tate, Von Sternberg
John Steinbeck, novelist, many
of whose books were turned into
films; Sharon Tate; Robert
Taylor, leading man who wound
up his career by following Ronald
Reagan on "Death Valley Days;"
Josef von Sternberg, one of
Hollywood's very greatest
directors, neglected in recent
years due to his supposedly
anachronistic exoticism, two of

whose films will be shown here
within the next few weeks; Ruth
White, whose career as a
prominant character actress was
only just beginning.
Three people who were
indirectly related to commercial
films were Richard Griffith, film
historian and curator of the film
library of the Museum of Modern
Art, Rolling Stone Brian Jones
and Frank Loesser, composer of
such Broadway shows as Guys and
Dolls and How to Succeed in
Business.
* * *
Continuing at the Surf Theatre
in San Francisco is a superb series
of French film classics.
Concluding their run tonight are
Jean Vigo's amazing Zero i'or
Conduct and L'Atalaute.
Playing on Thursday through
Saturday is Marius, part one of
the seldom-seen Pagnol trilogy, as
well as a documentary on one of
the cinema's pioneers called Abel
G a 11 ce — Yesterday and Today.
Pagnol's The Well-Digger's
Daughter and Renois's great
Boudu Saved from Drowning will
be shown on Sunday and Monday.
* *
Finally, a National Society of
Student Film Critics as been
formed, with headquarters in New
York and here at Stanford. The
organization, formed in order to
create lines of communication
between young film enthusiasts
across the country, will announce
its film awards for 1969 in
mid-March.

years due to his supposedly
anachronistic exoticism, two of

whose films will be shown here
within the next few weeks; Ruth
White, whose career as a
prominant character actress was
only just beginning.
Three people who were
indirectly related to commercial
films were Richard Griffith, film
historian and curator of the film
library of the Museum of Modern
Art, Rolling Stone Brian Jones
and Frank Loesser, composer of
such Broadway shows as Guys and
Dolls and How to Succeed in
Business.

Continuing at the Surf Theatre
in San Francisco is a superb series
of French film classics.
Concluding their run tonight are
Jean Vigo's amazing Zero i'or
Conduct and L'Atalaute.
Playing on Thursday through
Saturday is Marius, part one of
the seldom-seen Pagnol trilogy, as
well as a documentary on one of
the cinema's pioneers called Abel
G a 11 ce — Yesterday and Today.
Pagnol's The Well-Digger's
Daughter and Renois's great
Boudu Saved from Drowning will
be shown on Sunday and Monday.

Finally, a National Society of
Student Film Critics as been
formed, with headquarters in New
York and here at Stanford. The
organization, formed in order to
create lines of communication
between young film enthusiasts
across the country, will announce
its film awards for 1969 in
mid-March.


JOSEF VON STERNBERG 1894-1969
Looking over any year's
obituary list for film personalities
can very easily render the
concerned observer extremely
melancholy. It is inevitable that
each year, many actors, actresses,
directors and even obscure
technicians that we have known
and loved on screen will pass on.
These artists, at least the good
ones, have involved the public in
their own personalities and have,
in their own way, become a part
of our own emotional
autobiographies.
In retrospect, it is occasionally
tempting to grant the label of
"great artist" to some perennial
performers or dedicated
entertainers. At the same time,
post mortum career
summarizations can provide
factual evidence to slander those
people whose work we did not
care for. No matter. Following is a
list of those tilm personalities who
died during 1969, with brief notes
on those less well known.
Garland, Karloff
Charles Brackett, who co-wrote
with Billy Wilder some of the
latter's best films; Eduardo
Ciannelli, one of the great
character actors of all-time and
who had the misfortune of
playing his last role in The Secret
of Santa Victoria; Karl Freund,
cinematographer on such early
landmark films as Last Laugh,
Metropolis and Variety; Judy
Garland; Leo Gorcey,
wise-cracking leader of the
Bowery Boys; Sonja Henie, ice
skater cum actress; Martita Hunt,
British grands dame; Jeffrey
Hunter, dubiously remembered
for turning King of Kings into "I
Was a Teen-Age Jesus;" Boris
Karloff.

Frank Lawton, most
memorable as the grown-up half
of David Copperfield; Leo
McCarey, director of Going My
Way and such classics as Duck
Soup and Ruggles of Red Gap;
Eric Portman, British actor;
Thelma Ritter, one of our greatest
character actresses, a six-time
nominee for an Academy Award,
winner of none.
Tate, Von Sternberg
John Steinbeck, novelist, many
of whose books were turned into
films; Sharon Tate; Robert
Taylor, leading man who wound
up his career by following Ronald
Reagan on "Death Valley Days;"
Josef von Sternberg, one of
Hollywood's very greatest
directors, neglected in recent
years due to his supposedly
anachronistic exoticism, two of

whose films will be shown here
within the next few weeks; Ruth
White, whose career as a
prominant character actress was
only just beginning.
