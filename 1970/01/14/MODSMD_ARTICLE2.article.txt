## Biafra Relief Effort Snarled 
### 
LAGOS (AP) —A massive
international effort to rush food
to millions of Biafran tribesmen
was stalled Tuesday despite the
war's end as relief officials waited
for approval of the Nigerian
government.
The hitch in the relief program
developed as 6,000 Biafran troops
surrendered to the federal army as
the first step toward abolishing
Biafra as a political and geographic
entity.
An estimated four million Ibos
and other tribesmen in the bush
are believed in need of food and
medical aid.
The sudden end of the
30-month war appeared to have
caught the federal government off
guard. The only official comment
was a broadcast at midnight
Monday by Maj. Gen. Yakubu
Gowon, Nigeria's chief of state.
The broadcast said:
"All field commanders will
take all necessary measures to give
full protection to surrendering
troops. Field commanders are
instructed to push on and
establish effective federal presence
in all areas still remaining in
secessionist control.

Gowon declared a general
amnesty "for all those misled into
the futile attempt to disintegrate
the country." He did not mention
the leaders, including, Gen. C.
Odumegwu Oukwu who left the
country and still is hiding.
Oil Charges
SANTA BARBARA, Calif.
(AP)—Four major oil companies
are charged with 343 criminal
counts in connection with the
Santa Barbara Channel oil spill,
county Dist. Atty. David Minier
disclosed Tuesday, adding he
could be jailed for contempt of
court.
Minier said he had filed the
complaint in Municipal Court
against Union, Mobel, Texaco and
Gulf oil companies. The 87-page
complaint charges the companies
with polluting state waters
beginning with an under-sea
blow-out in January of 1969.
The oil companies obtained an
injunction last year from U.S.
District Court Judge Albert
Stephens Jr. barring him from
prosecuting or "otherwise
harassing" them, Minier said.

Minier said he expects the oil
firms to ask judge Stephens to
hold him in contempt. But he
considers the federal injunction
"invalid and unenforceable,"
Minier said.
Minier said he filed the
complaint late Monday because a
delay would allow the one-year
"statute of limitations" to elapse.
Assemblyman Don
MacGillivray, R-Santa Barbara,
introduced a bill this week aimed
at prohibiting all new oil drilling
in state waters within the channel.
Court Ruling
WASHINGTON (AP -A
three-judge federal court panel
banned Tuesday tax-exempt
status for private schools in
Mississippi that discriminate
against Negroes. Persons
contributing to those schools also
were denied tax deductions.
The order will remain in effect
until a suit filed by five Negro
families, claiming that tax
exemptions amount to federal aid
to segregated schools, is resolved
at trial.

The opinion, by Judge Harold
Leventhal of the Court of Appeals
and District Judges John H. Pratt
and Joseph C. Waddy, said the
relief granted today is "Not
necessarily our last ruling on the
matter. .
They indicated that if special
situations arise as the result of the
ruling, parties involved can
petition for hearings on those
issues raised.
Hayakawa
SACRAMENTO (AP)-California
poiticians conducted a post
analysis Tuesday of Mayor Joseph
Alioto's decision not to run for
governor while S.I. Hayakawa
prepared a political
announcement of his own.
Hayakawa, president of San
Francisco State College, said he
would announce Thursday
whether he'll be a Democratic
candidate for the U.S. Senate seat
held by Republican George
Murphy.
A close Hayakawa aide said the
college president had reached his
decision but had not told anyone
what it was. Political experts said
he would have the best chance of
any Democrat against Murphy,
the former movie actor who is
seeking a second term.
A UPI report in the Palo Alto
Times stated that Hayakawa had
decided not to run, preferring to
remain at the University, but that
this would be announced
officially on Thursday.
