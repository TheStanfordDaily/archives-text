# Stanford, SRI Co-Sponsoring National Priorities Conference
## 
### 
Setting of national priorities —
how they are arrived at and how
changed — will be the subject of a
three-day forum January 15-17
under the joint sponsorship of
Stanford University and Stanford
Research Institute.
During the forum leaders in
American government, business,
and education — as well as
students and faculty of Stanford
University and professional
researchers from SRI — will
participate in a series of panel
discussions and question and
answer sessions designed to
explore a wide range of opinion
on the topic.
All sessions will be held in
Cummings Art Auditorium on
campus and all will be open to the
public.
"The forum is an attempt to
increase public understanding of
the process by which America's
national priorities are set, and to
explore alternatives for changing
this process," explained Dr. Kan
Chen of SRl's Institute Programs
Office, who is the forum
organizer. "We are experiencing
today a great deal of social
tension because many people
believe our national priorities
should be reordered, but too few

fully understand how these
priorities are set or the
opportunities for change in this
process."
Working with Dr. Chen in
organizing the forum were two
Stanford faculty members,
Professors Robert Mozley and
Robert North, and three students,
Joyce Kobayashi, Mark Herlach,
and Paul Maxwell. Funds for the
forum were jointly supplied by
SRI and the University.
At the first session of the
forum, beginning at 7:30 p.m. on
Thursday, panelists will present an
overview of the issues involved.
The moderator will be John
Grube of the ASSU Council of
Presidents.

Science, Stanford University on
"Macro Problems Facing the
Nation and the World;" Leonard
A. Lecht, Director of the Center
for Priority Analysis, National
