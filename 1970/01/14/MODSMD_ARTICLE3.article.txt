# Pitzer Adopts Change In Campus Pill Policy
## 
### ED KOHN 
President Kenneth Pitzer
yesterday approved a proposal
that will allow Cowell Health
Center to dispense birth control
pills to all coeds. The new policy
will go into effect immediately.
Yesterday's announcement
followed a study that lasted
almost eighteen months. The
change of policy to prescribe the
pill was jointly recommended by
the Health Service and the Dean
of Students Office some months
ago.
In announcing the decision,
Pitzer in effect rescinded a 1962
decision that permitted the pills
to be perscribed only for students
who were married. Those who had
plans to get married within 60
days or those who were at least 21
years old.
In the past, unmarried students
desiring the pills had been referred
to such groups as the Planned
Parenthood clinic in Palo Alto or
the Santa Clara County Health
Department.
Dr. James B. McClenahan,
Director of Cowell, emphasized
that the decision was "strictly a
medical one."
Question Of Health
He said that the matter was a
question of public health and
medicine and was not reached as a
social judgement.
"Stanford's policy says that
"The University respects and
relies upon the relationship,
between student and physician,
and physicians at the Health
Service will, in their professional
judgement, diagnose and treat
patients who need medical
attention or care for personal
medical problems," McClenahan
said.
McClenahan stated that the
decision to provide birth control
counsel is similar to the policies
now followed by many other
coeducational institutions. He said
that the Health Service will J
continue to work entirely on an '
individual doctor-patient basis.
Urge Counsel
"When students inquire about '
contraception," he said, "we urge '
that they counsel with parents, '
clergymen, or physicians, J
evaluating emotional,"
psychological, and moral'
considerations."

Late yesterday afternoon,
McClenahan told the Daily :
"This is a new service for
Cowell and we want to proceed
carefully to be certain that this is
well done. How many students
will request this type of care is
unknown, and some changes in
staffing and patterns of handling
patients will very probably be
required.
"Several provisions have been
initiated, but we ask for the
cooperation and patience of the
students and the rest of the
University and community,
especially during the transition
period."
Policy Review
He said that the proposal was
adopted as a result of the policy
review held recently. There were a
series of meetings held about the
matter last week, and rumors had
been circulating through the
campus for the past two weeks.
The proposal was given to Pitzer
at the beginning of Fall Term.
McClenahan acknowledged
that Stanford students had placed
a burden on local birth control
clinics during recent months. "I
think that this will cut down on
the strain placed on the Planned
Parenthood Center in Palo Alto as
well as the load on the Santa Clara
County Health Department," he
said.
In approving the proposal
yesterday Pitzer said:

"Our Student Health Service
physicians should be free to
practice medicine in a way that
best serves the health needs of our
students today. The doctors who
are closest to Stanford students
and who are the most directly
concerned about their welfare
should be as free as other doctors
to exercise their professional
judgement in giving proper
counsel and in prescribing proper
care for their patients."
Legality Check
One of the major reasons that
the decision was delayed was that
University officials wanted to
make sure the school was not
breaking one of several California
codes dealing with the problem of
medical prescriptions to minors.
A decision was apparently
reached to revise Cowell's medical
bulletin to state that the center
does prescribe the pills. Thus,
when a parent allows his daughter
to attend Stanford, he is giving
consent to the announced policy.
There was considerable
on-campus support for the
measure before Pitzer announced
his decision. In a poll taken earlier
this year in a coed, four-class
dorm, over 90 percent of those
polled thought that Cowell should
prescribe the pills to "anyone who
wants them and is medically able
to take them."

series of meetings held about the
matter last week, and rumors had
been circulating through the
campus for the past two weeks.
The proposal was given to Pitzer
at the beginning of Fall Term.
McClenahan acknowledged
that Stanford students had placed
a burden on local birth control
clinics during recent months. "I
think that this will cut down on
the strain placed on the Planned
Parenthood Center in Palo Alto as
well as the load on the Santa Clara
County Health Department," he
said.
In approving the proposal
yesterday Pitzer said:

"Our Student Health Service
physicians should be free to
practice medicine in a way that
best serves the health needs of our
students today. The doctors who
are closest to Stanford students
and who are the most directly
concerned about their welfare
should be as free as other doctors
to exercise their professional
judgement in giving proper
counsel and in prescribing proper
care for their patients."
Legality Check
One of the major reasons that
the decision was delayed was that
University officials wanted to
make sure the school was not
breaking one of several California
codes dealing with the problem of
medical prescriptions to minors.
A decision was apparently
reached to revise Cowell's medical
bulletin to state that the center
does prescribe the pills. Thus,
when a parent allows his daughter
to attend Stanford, he is giving
consent to the announced policy.
There was considerable
on-campus support for the
measure before Pitzer announced
his decision. In a poll taken earlier
this year in a coed, four-class
dorm, over 90 percent of those
polled thought that Cowell should
prescribe the pills to "anyone who
wants them and is medically able
to take them."
President Kenneth Pitzer
yesterday approved a proposal
that will allow Cowell Health
Center to dispense birth control
pills to all coeds. The new policy
will go into effect immediately.
Yesterday's announcement
followed a study that lasted
almost eighteen months. The
change of policy to prescribe the
pill was jointly recommended by
the Health Service and the Dean
of Students Office some months
ago.
In announcing the decision,
Pitzer in effect rescinded a 1962
decision that permitted the pills
to be perscribed only for students
who were married. Those who had
plans to get married within 60
days or those who were at least 21
years old.
In the past, unmarried students
desiring the pills had been referred
to such groups as the Planned
Parenthood clinic in Palo Alto or
the Santa Clara County Health
Department.
Dr. James B. McClenahan,
Director of Cowell, emphasized
that the decision was "strictly a
medical one."
Question Of Health
He said that the matter was a
question of public health and
medicine and was not reached as a
social judgement.
"Stanford's policy says that
"The University respects and
relies upon the relationship,
between student and physician,
and physicians at the Health
Service will, in their professional
judgement, diagnose and treat
patients who need medical
attention or care for personal
medical problems," McClenahan
said.
McClenahan stated that the
decision to provide birth control
counsel is similar to the policies
now followed by many other
coeducational institutions. He said
that the Health Service will J
continue to work entirely on an '
individual doctor-patient basis.
Urge Counsel
"When students inquire about '
contraception," he said, "we urge '
that they counsel with parents, '
clergymen, or physicians, J
evaluating emotional,"
psychological, and moral'
considerations."

Late yesterday afternoon,
McClenahan told the Daily :
"This is a new service for
Cowell and we want to proceed
carefully to be certain that this is
well done. How many students
will request this type of care is
unknown, and some changes in
staffing and patterns of handling
patients will very probably be
required.
"Several provisions have been
initiated, but we ask for the
cooperation and patience of the
students and the rest of the
University and community,
especially during the transition
period."
