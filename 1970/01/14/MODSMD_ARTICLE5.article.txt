# More Belt-Tightening
## Summer Festival Cut 
### 
Plans for the Stanford Summer
Festival have been discontinued
for 1 970 because of severe budget
restraints facing the University.
Several attractions for the
Festival, still in preliminary
negotiation, may be included in
an expanded summer program
offered through the Office of
Public Events.
The increased costs deemed
necessary for planning a full-scale
Festival and the desire of
Executive Producer Stephen A.
Baffrey to devote more of his
time to private, off-campus
cultural programming were
primary factors leading to a
one-year moratorium on the
Festival, according to University
Relations Director Lyle M.
Nelson.
Baffrey, who will remain on
the University Relations staff on a
half-time basis, said "My decision
is purely a personal one; and it
reflects my desire to decrease the
intensity of my involvement in
this highly con central e d

enterprise, and to explore a
number of private interests.
"I deeply regret that it comes
at a time when many pressures on
Stanford's excellent leadership
combine to make this moratorium
the only possible decision.
"During its six years, the
Stanford Summer Festival has
made significant contributions —
to the campus, to the community
and to the arts. I hope this chango
in dimension for the program will
be not so much a cause for lament
but an inspiration to others to
carry on this exciting mission in
the excellent tradition Stanford
has established."
Working in collaboration with
a faculty committee, Baffrey built
the Festival into one of the best
known summer cultural programs
in the West.
During 1969, the Festival
attracted a paid audience of
nearly 72,000, the highest in its
six-year history.
Total University subsidies for
the Festival in this period

amounted to $560,000. Of this
amount, about $230,000 was
covered by special gifts, while
$330,000 came from general
University revenue.
During the next few months,
the University plans a thorough
review of its cv cural programs
and their expense.
In October, the University
indicated that sufficient financial
support for the new season had
been obtained through a grant
from the San Francisco
Foundation and gifts from
anonymous donors. But a more
detailed examination of estimated
costs for a full-scale Festival,
coupled with increased budgetary
restraint throughout the
University, forced the decision to
discontinue the program for one
year.
Pending negotiations with
private donors and performing
groups will determine the extent
to which the summer public
events program may be expanded.

The Festival opened in 1964
with a Shakespearean program
which quickly established it as a
leading center for cultural events.
Later, the Festival introduced
the American Conservatory
Theatre (ACT) to the Bay Area
and played a key part in ACT's
decision to become a resident
company in San Francisco.
The Stanford program has
provided a model for similar
events at Lincoln Center in New
York, and Temple Festival in
Philadelphia, and others.
Stanford Festival bookings
have contributed growing public
recognition to such varied groups
as the Joffrey Ballet, the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and
the New York City Opera, which
now visits Los Angeles regularly.
The Festival also has sponsored
the American debut of the
Orchestra de la Suisse Romande
and the national or regional
premiere of such individual artists
as Bruno (Jelber, Isabel Rivas, and
Kllv Amelinc.

the University Relations staff on a
half-time basis, said "My decision
is purely a personal one; and it
reflects my desire to decrease the
intensity of my involvement in
this highly con central e d

enterprise, and to explore a
number of private interests.
"I deeply regret that it comes
at a time when many pressures on
Stanford's excellent leadership
combine to make this moratorium
the only possible decision.
"During its six years, the
Stanford Summer Festival has
made significant contributions —
to the campus, to the community
and to the arts. I hope this chango
in dimension for the program will
be not so much a cause for lament
but an inspiration to others to
carry on this exciting mission in
the excellent tradition Stanford
has established."
Working in collaboration with
a faculty committee, Baffrey built
the Festival into one of the best
known summer cultural programs
in the West.
During 1969, the Festival
attracted a paid audience of
nearly 72,000, the highest in its
six-year history.
Total University subsidies for
the Festival in this period

amounted to $560,000. Of this
amount, about $230,000 was
covered by special gifts, while
$330,000 came from general
University revenue.
During the next few months,
the University plans a thorough
review of its cv cural programs
and their expense.
In October, the University
indicated that sufficient financial
support for the new season had
been obtained through a grant
from the San Francisco
Foundation and gifts from
anonymous donors. But a more
detailed examination of estimated
costs for a full-scale Festival,
coupled with increased budgetary
restraint throughout the
University, forced the decision to
discontinue the program for one
year.
Pending negotiations with
private donors and performing
groups will determine the extent
to which the summer public
events program may be expanded.

The Festival opened in 1964
with a Shakespearean program
which quickly established it as a
leading center for cultural events.
Later, the Festival introduced
the American Conservatory
Theatre (ACT) to the Bay Area
and played a key part in ACT's
decision to become a resident
company in San Francisco.
The Stanford program has
provided a model for similar
events at Lincoln Center in New
York, and Temple Festival in
Philadelphia, and others.
Stanford Festival bookings
have contributed growing public
recognition to such varied groups
as the Joffrey Ballet, the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and
the New York City Opera, which
now visits Los Angeles regularly.
The Festival also has sponsored
the American debut of the
Orchestra de la Suisse Romande
and the national or regional
premiere of such individual artists
as Bruno (Jelber, Isabel Rivas, and
Kllv Amelinc.
Plans for the Stanford Summer
Festival have been discontinued
for 1 970 because of severe budget
restraints facing the University.
Several attractions for the
Festival, still in preliminary
negotiation, may be included in
an expanded summer program
offered through the Office of
Public Events.
The increased costs deemed
necessary for planning a full-scale
Festival and the desire of
Executive Producer Stephen A.
Baffrey to devote more of his
time to private, off-campus
cultural programming were
primary factors leading to a
one-year moratorium on the
Festival, according to University
Relations Director Lyle M.
Nelson.
