# Notes From Bolivia
## Starting The New Year 
### Hugh J. McCarten 
On New Year's Day this year
(January 1) the family and I sat
around the living room, recovering
from one of Mother's famous
'' b ea ns-and-frankfurts" holiday
lunches and whiling away the
hours before the first of the
annual football "bowl" games
appeared on our TV screen. As
usual, everybody had a favorite
team or player and a friendly
wager here and there was not
uncommon.
"What team do you like this
year?" I asked one of the friendly
wagers (the one who looked like
Judy Canova).
"Simon and Garfunkel," he
replied, "although you can't beat
Lennon-McCartney for dominant
sevenths."
Idiotic Parents
I was at the point of arguing
this when little brother Dorrit
rushed in, announcing that he had
invented yet another cure for
sniffles. Even at his young age,
Dorrit was better read than most
dock workers and because of his
singular penchant for the literary,
had won the nickname of
"America's Favorite Wash-day
Detergent" from his envious
second grade classmates. Such
precociousness did not sit well
with Father, however, an
immigrant (New Jersey) who had
only an M.A. in comp-lit. to his
name. Pop was overly sensitive to
remarks about "backward,
uneducated, idiotic parents," and
this fact often emerged in his
conversation.
"Why don't you shut up," he
suggested before Dorrit had even
finished speaking.
Up With People
"All right," said Dorrit, "but
first I want to tell my New Year's
resolutions. I got tired of making
up resolutions for myself, so I
made some up for all mankind."
At this juncture everyone in
the room suddenly remembered
that their cars were
double-parked—even Grandma
who didn't own a car. They
rushed out of the room en masse
(in a mess) leaving Dorrit and me

alone. We exchanged glances, but
soon rushed to Macy's to return
them.
"Well, what have you resolved
for the lucky people." This from
me.
'I just don't think "
"There are several things that I
just don't think people should
do." This from Dorrit.
"Well, what is it you don't
want people to do?" I was getting
plenty sore because my chair was
so uncomfortable.
"First of all," said Dorrit, "I
don't ever want to hear another
version of George Gershwin's

'Summertime' performed by man,
woman, or beast on any
instrument or combination of
instruments including the oud, the
nose flute, the sackbutt, or the
seal horns."
The Original Truman
"Not even the original hit
single by Harry Truman?"
There was a silence which
lasted several days, but as it
turned out, Dorrit had dreamed
up only one other resolution
which he had written down. It
contained many surprises—the
biggest one being that Dorrit
could write.

We, the people, resolve to try
to avoid the following overworked
words and expressions in our daily
conversation (and our wildest
dreams!)
bummer - trip - scene (as in "bad
scene") - good vibes - bad vibes -
hassle - far out - groovy - freaky -
to groove - Oh wow! - blow my
mind - to dig - heavy - to get into -
and many more . . .
