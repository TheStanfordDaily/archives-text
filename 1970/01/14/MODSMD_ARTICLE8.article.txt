## Kill The Courts 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON —There has
been a great deal ol' criticism of
the courts in this country.
Because of the backlog of cases,
plus cumbersome appeals and
bureaucratic procedures, it takes
longer and longer for a man to be
given a fair trial.
Prof. Horace Hafflefinger of
the Institute of Sustained
Jurisprudence has been making a
study of the problem and has
come to the conclusion that you
don't need the courts at all. In
today's world of speedy
communications, he says, trying a
man before a jury and in a
courtroom is old-fashioned.
Prof. Hafflefinger told me, "It
is so much easier and faster to try
someone in the press than in a
court. Why must a person wait six
months to a year for a trial when
all the facts of the case have been
laid before the public as soon as
the person has been arrested?"
"But, Professor, under our
system, isn't a person presumed
innocent until proven guilty?"
"Of course," Prof. Hafflefinger
said. "And I intend to do nothing
to change this. But the press is
still in a better position to report
all the facts than the district
attorney.
"Let us take, for example, the
Sharon Tate murder case. As soon
as the indictments were handed

down, the press went to work.
One newspaper printed the entire
confession of one of the girls; a
national magazine went into detail
on the sordid life habits of the
accused; television reported
interviews with lawyers of the
people involved.
"The result of all this was that
the public knew far more about
the case than the prosecutor.
"Adding all this information
up, I don't think there is one
person in this country who has
not made up his mind on the
innocence or guilt of the accused
people in the Tate murders. Now I
ask you, if the public already
knows if they are innocent or
guilty, why do the people need a
trial?"
"To make it legal?" I
suggested.
"Hogwash," Prof. Hafflefinger
said.
"What about something like
the Song My massacres?"
"This is another example of
where a trial is unnecessary. Both
national news magazines put Lt.
Calley on their covers. The public
has seen photographs of
massacred people. They have read
testimony from men who were
there. What good is a court
martial going to do when it's
obvious to the world who was
responsble for what happened at
Song My?"
"Then what you're saying is
that we are helping justice by
eliminating the court system."
"Exactly. The court system
was necessary before people could
read newspapers and magazines
and watch television. But now
with all the news media at their
command they are in a much
better position to evaluate a crime
than 12 strangers and a man in a
long black robe."
"Prof. Hafflefinger, how would
you propose that the public make
its decision as to the innocence or
guilt of the accused?"
"After each story concerning a
crime, the newspaper or magazine
would be obligated to run a box
which said: A —guilty,
B —innocent. The reader would
mail this in on a post card to the
publication, which would then
print the results. In the case of
television it would be done on a
random telephone sampling. In
any case, whatever the public
decided would be final, and we
would do away with the fiendish
system of court appeals once and
for all."

Because of the backlog of cases,
plus cumbersome appeals and
bureaucratic procedures, it takes
longer and longer for a man to be
given a fair trial.
Prof. Horace Hafflefinger of
the Institute of Sustained
Jurisprudence has been making a
study of the problem and has
come to the conclusion that you
don't need the courts at all. In
today's world of speedy
communications, he says, trying a
man before a jury and in a
courtroom is old-fashioned.
Prof. Hafflefinger told me, "It
is so much easier and faster to try
someone in the press than in a
court. Why must a person wait six
months to a year for a trial when
all the facts of the case have been
laid before the public as soon as
the person has been arrested?"
"But, Professor, under our
system, isn't a person presumed
innocent until proven guilty?"
"Of course," Prof. Hafflefinger
said. "And I intend to do nothing
to change this. But the press is
still in a better position to report
all the facts than the district
attorney.
"Let us take, for example, the
Sharon Tate murder case. As soon
as the indictments were handed

down, the press went to work.
One newspaper printed the entire
confession of one of the girls; a
national magazine went into detail
on the sordid life habits of the
accused; television reported
interviews with lawyers of the
people involved.
"The result of all this was that
the public knew far more about
the case than the prosecutor.
"Adding all this information
up, I don't think there is one
person in this country who has
not made up his mind on the
innocence or guilt of the accused
people in the Tate murders. Now I
ask you, if the public already
knows if they are innocent or
guilty, why do the people need a
trial?"
"To make it legal?" I
suggested.
"Hogwash," Prof. Hafflefinger
said.
"What about something like
the Song My massacres?"
"This is another example of
where a trial is unnecessary. Both
national news magazines put Lt.
Calley on their covers. The public
has seen photographs of
massacred people. They have read
testimony from men who were
there. What good is a court
martial going to do when it's
obvious to the world who was
responsble for what happened at
Song My?"
"Then what you're saying is
that we are helping justice by
eliminating the court system."
"Exactly. The court system
was necessary before people could
read newspapers and magazines
and watch television. But now
with all the news media at their
command they are in a much
better position to evaluate a crime
than 12 strangers and a man in a
long black robe."
"Prof. Hafflefinger, how would
you propose that the public make
its decision as to the innocence or
guilt of the accused?"
"After each story concerning a
crime, the newspaper or magazine
would be obligated to run a box
which said: A —guilty,
B —innocent. The reader would
mail this in on a post card to the
publication, which would then
print the results. In the case of
television it would be done on a
random telephone sampling. In
any case, whatever the public
decided would be final, and we
would do away with the fiendish
system of court appeals once and
for all."
