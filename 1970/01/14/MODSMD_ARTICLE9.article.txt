strange languages.
HOUSING: Shelter; The
immediate environment of

HO USING NEED: Serious.
The Santa Clara County Housing
Authority has a waiting list of
approximately 1000. There are
2000 low income families on the
Sati Mateo County Housing
Authority's waiting list.
SAN MATEO COUNTY
HOUSING AUTHORITY: A joke.
Ineptly managed, inadequately
funded. Many families do not
bother to go on the waiting list
because of a three-year wait.
SAN MATEO COUNTY: One
of the richest counties in the
world.

SANTA CLARA COUNTY:
One of the largest centers of
war-related electronics industry in
the world.
THE FARM: A huge parcel of
8800 acres, located between San
Mateo and Santa Clara counties.
Most of it is open land, but it is
also occupied by a large industrial
park (571 acres), a shopping
center, SLAC, route 280, cattle
and a university.
STANFORD BUSINESS
OFFICE: Runs the business of the
Farm. Especially concerned with
Land Development.
LAND DEVELOPMENT:
(choose one) a) A way of
maximizing profits, b) smothering
nature with asphalt, c) Creating an
environment to meet the needs
the people on the land.
EXORBITANT LAND COSTS:
Caused by lack of available vacant
land. A major cause of the
housing crisis.

HIGH INTEREST RATE:
Usury. Stifles housing
construction in capitalist
economy. Limits housing supply,
thus helping realtors by increasing
demand. Slows inflation by
causing recession.
TENANTS: Those who do not
get a federal subsidy for housing.
FHA (FEDERAL HOUSING
ADMINISTRATION): A federal
agency, source of federal housing
subsidies. Controlled by mortgage
companies and large developers.
Subsidized the WASP escape to
the suburbs in the 1950'5.
FHA 2.76 PROGRAM: A new
program for tenants, initiated in

One of the few sources of federal

236 project without rent
supplement does not involve

project must have a monthly

project, supplements rental so
that low-income tenants pay only
25% of their income for rent.
(Catch-22: Congress appropriated
only a pitifully small
amount / a ilows only 40%
rent-supplement in an FHA 236
project/requires local Government
approval.)
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
APPROVAL: One of the ways of
stopping low-income housing on a
local level. Realtors stir up racist
and reactionary sentiments.
FHA PER/UNIT COST
LIMITS: Maximum allowable cost
per unit. Scaled so that large units
for families cannot be built.
LOW INCOME LARGE
FAMILIES: Those who have the
most serious housing need. Should
be involved in planning of housing
on Stanford land.
PLANNING COMMITTEES:
Groups of "Interested Citizens."
Frequently avoid participation by
Low Income future tenants on
planning of housing projects.
TOKENISM: A way of
blunting protest without
responding to need. An old honky
trick.

construction in capitalist
economy. Limits housing supply,

One of the few sources of federal

FHA minimum income limits, a
236 project without rent
supplement does not involve
low-income people.
FHA MINIMUM INCOME
LIMITS: Tenants of an FHA 236
project must have a monthly
income at least four times the
basic rent. Without rent
supplement, this effectively
eliminates low-income people
from this subsidy.
RENT SUPPLEMENT
PROGRAM: Rent subsidy for low

income tenants. In a FHA 236
project, supplements rental so
that low-income tenants pay only
25% of their income for rent.
(Catch-22: Congress appropriated
only a pitifully small
amount / a ilows only 40%
rent-supplement in an FHA 236
project/requires local Government
approval.)
LOCAL GOVERNMENT

stopping low-income housing on a
local level. Realtors stir up racist
and reactionary sentiments.
FHA PER/UNIT COST
LIMITS: Maximum allowable cost
per unit. Scaled so that large units
for families cannot be built.
LOW INCOME LARGE
FAMILIES: Those who have the
most serious housing need. Should

on Stanford land.
