Stanford Faculty & Staff!
Stanford University housing loan interest rates
are expected to be raised dramatically on Feb
ruary Ist. Those of you with ground leases
prior to then, and who start construction before
the summer will benefit from existing rates.
If we can help you choose a building site by
providing preliminary plans, costs, and/or
professional opinion, our services are FREE, our
reaction time will be fast!
