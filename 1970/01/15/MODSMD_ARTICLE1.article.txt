# Organizing Local Employees
## Unions Make Slow Gains 
### ED KOHN 
(Editor's note: The following
report is the first of four articles
dealing with the Physical Plant
employees and the Teamsters
Union. The remaining articles will
be published in Friday's.
Monday's and Tuesday's Daily.
Tomorrow's installment will deal
with an exchange of letters
between Teamsters and University
officials.)
There are two new officially
recognized unions on the Stanford
campus, at the Fire Department
and at the Stanford University
Press. In addition, several
employee associations have
received indirect, tacit approval.
The firemen belong to 1-12 of
the International Association of
Firefighters, a branch of the
AFL-CIO, while the printshop
employees belong to a Pressman's
Union.
A third union is struggling for
recognition and a voice in campus
labor affairs; it is this group, the
Ad Hoc Teamsters Union, that
will provide the focal point for
these articles.
Some background information
is necessary to understand the
position of the Ad Hoc Teamsters.
The development of the "union
movement" at Stanford dates
back to 1964-65, when some
electricians and electronics
technicians employed by SLAC
attempted to establish an
International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers (IBEW) local
there.
The University refused to
recognize either the group or the
union, and after a court fight, the
groups suspended their efforts.
In its court suit, the
electricians and the IBEW (which
is affiliated with the AFL-CIO)
asked the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) to
intervene in their behalf, but the
NLRB refused to do so, saying

that it had no jurisdiction where a
non-profit educational institution
was involved. That decision has
yet to be reversed, although it has
been challenged in recent years
and another suit, similar to the
one brought by the IBEW in
1 965, is presently under
consideration.
Renewed Campus Interest
In recent years, there has been
a renewed interest in the labor
union movement on campuses
throughout the nation. The
Teamsters, for example, maintain
locals on five private university
campuses, including the
University of Chicago and
Fordham University.
The Teamsters and other
unions have also established many
other locals at public, state-run
schools throughout the nation,
since these locals are not in
conflict with the NLRB's 1965
decision in the IBEW case and
other precedent actions.
The Ad Hoc Teamsters Union,
which calls itself the School,
Clerical Allied and Maintenence
Division of Teamsters Local 856,
is the bigge.s and probably the
most act'v- labor group on
campus.
An ou of the Freight
Checkers, Clerical Employees and
Helpers Local 856, which is based
in San Francisco, the ad hoc
group presently numbers 150 and
is growing at the rate of fifteen
members a week, according to
Keith Stothers, a steamfitter in
the Physical Plant who
coordinates most of the group's
activities.
Widespread Plant Support
Despite the cool reception that
the group has received from the
University administration, the
organization, which is centered
around the Physical Plant,
encompasses most of the
steamfitters, sheet iron workers,
air conditioning mechanics,

electricians, plumbers, machinists,
laborers and gardeners who are
assigned to the campus at large.
Some of the Plant's office help
and estimators have also signed
letters of intent indicating that
they desire an election to see
whether or not the Teamsters are
to be recognized as their
bargaining agent.

For the most part, the campus
unions and employee
organizations were brought about
by, and deal primarily with,
employee grievances.
Much of the interest in the Ad
Hoc Teamsters stems from the
University's threatened layoff of
the carpenters and painters
employed in the shops. In late
October and throughout
November, University officials
termed the painters and
carpenters "luxury" workers

because of the "high costs" and
"unproductivity" associated with
them
Physical Plant Director
Elbridge Bacon, who defined
'productivity' as "getting the job
done" in a November meeting
with employees, said that Physical
Plant labor is charged out at $9
per hour, while the average
worker receives about $4.50 per
hour. However, the $9 per hour
figure includes supervisors'
salaries, staff benefits,
miscellaneous casts, and operation and
maintenence of the plant's
vehicles.
Of fifteen carpenters on
campus in October, two are left.
The work that was scheduled for
the other thirteen has been
subcontracted to local firms at an
hourly rate of between $12.50
and $14.00 per man.
None of the painters have left
so far, but Stothers indicated that
most are insecure and that some
have made inquiries about other

opportunities. Most of the
department carpenters have gone
to Mills College. And, according
to one report, the University has
taken "at least one" application
for the position of carpenter from
a younger man than those he will
replace.
Requested to Intervene
The Teamsters Union entered
the picture in September of this
year, even before the layoff of the
painters and carpenters was
threatened. Acting upon the
request of Stothers, the union has
held several meetings with
Physical Plant employees and

others who might belong to the
catagories that the Teamsters are
seeking to represent.
Stothers said that he had asked
the Teamsters to hold exploratory
talks with the Plant workers
because he felt that the other
unions that might be able to
represent the group, like the
IBEW or other branches of the
AFL-CIO do not command
sufficient support in a situation
such as Stanford's. He said that
one reason for the rapid growth of
the Ad Hoc Teamsters was that
most of the Plant employees are
acquainted with the Teamsters'

power in this area and that the
men respected the Teamsters.
He said that many employees
of the Physical plant were
members of the Stanford
Employees Association (SEA) but
that the group was "too much of
a company union" to hold the
workers' support over a long
period of time. He said that their
lack of affiliation with bigger
organizations also weakened their
position.

and Local 856's Secretary, Rudy

University administration, the
organization, which is centered
around the Physical Plant,
encompasses most of the
steamfitters, sheet iron workers,
air conditioning mechanics,

electricians, plumbers, machinists,
laborers and gardeners who are
assigned to the campus at large.
Some of the Plant's office help
and estimators have also signed
letters of intent indicating that
they desire an election to see
whether or not the Teamsters are
to be recognized as their
bargaining agent.

For the most part, the campus
unions and employee
organizations were brought about
by, and deal primarily with,
employee grievances.
Much of the interest in the Ad
Hoc Teamsters stems from the
University's threatened layoff of
the carpenters and painters
employed in the shops. In late
October and throughout
November, University officials
termed the painters and
carpenters "luxury" workers

because of the "high costs" and
"unproductivity" associated with
them
Physical Plant Director
Elbridge Bacon, who defined
'productivity' as "getting the job
done" in a November meeting
with employees, said that Physical
Plant labor is charged out at $9
per hour, while the average
worker receives about $4.50 per
hour. However, the $9 per hour
figure includes supervisors'
salaries, staff benefits,
miscellaneous casts, and operation and
maintenence of the plant's
vehicles.
Of fifteen carpenters on
campus in October, two are left.
The work that was scheduled for
the other thirteen has been
subcontracted to local firms at an
hourly rate of between $12.50
and $14.00 per man.
None of the painters have left
so far, but Stothers indicated that
most are insecure and that some
have made inquiries about other

opportunities. Most of the
department carpenters have gone
to Mills College. And, according
to one report, the University has
taken "at least one" application
for the position of carpenter from
a younger man than those he will
replace.
Requested to Intervene
The Teamsters Union entered
the picture in September of this
year, even before the layoff of the
painters and carpenters was
threatened. Acting upon the
request of Stothers, the union has
held several meetings with
Physical Plant employees and

others who might belong to the
catagories that the Teamsters are
seeking to represent.
Stothers said that he had asked
the Teamsters to hold exploratory
talks with the Plant workers
because he felt that the other
unions that might be able to
represent the group, like the
IBEW or other branches of the
AFL-CIO do not command
sufficient support in a situation
such as Stanford's. He said that
one reason for the rapid growth of
the Ad Hoc Teamsters was that
most of the Plant employees are
acquainted with the Teamsters'

power in this area and that the
men respected the Teamsters.
He said that many employees
of the Physical plant were
members of the Stanford
Employees Association (SEA) but
that the group was "too much of
a company union" to hold the
workers' support over a long
period of time. He said that their
lack of affiliation with bigger
organizations also weakened their
position.

Union. The remaining articles will

between Teamsters and University

There are two new officially
recognized unions on the Stanford
campus, at the Fire Department
and at the Stanford University
Press. In addition, several
employee associations have
received indirect, tacit approval.
The firemen belong to 1-12 of
the International Association of
Firefighters, a branch of the
AFL-CIO, while the printshop
employees belong to a Pressman's
Union.
A third union is struggling for
recognition and a voice in campus
labor affairs; it is this group, the
Ad Hoc Teamsters Union, that
will provide the focal point for
these articles.
Some background information
is necessary to understand the
position of the Ad Hoc Teamsters.
The development of the "union
movement" at Stanford dates
back to 1964-65, when some
electricians and electronics
technicians employed by SLAC
attempted to establish an
International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers (IBEW) local
there.
The University refused to
recognize either the group or the
union, and after a court fight, the
groups suspended their efforts.
In its court suit, the
electricians and the IBEW (which
is affiliated with the AFL-CIO)
asked the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) to
intervene in their behalf, but the
NLRB refused to do so, saying

that it had no jurisdiction where a
non-profit educational institution
was involved. That decision has
yet to be reversed, although it has
been challenged in recent years
and another suit, similar to the
one brought by the IBEW in
1 965, is presently under
consideration.
Renewed Campus Interest
In recent years, there has been
a renewed interest in the labor
union movement on campuses
throughout the nation. The
Teamsters, for example, maintain
locals on five private university
campuses, including the
University of Chicago and
Fordham University.
The Teamsters and other
unions have also established many
other locals at public, state-run
schools throughout the nation,
since these locals are not in
conflict with the NLRB's 1965
decision in the IBEW case and
other precedent actions.
The Ad Hoc Teamsters Union,
which calls itself the School,
Clerical Allied and Maintenence
Division of Teamsters Local 856,
is the bigge.s and probably the
most act'v- labor group on
campus.
An ou of the Freight
Checkers, Clerical Employees and
Helpers Local 856, which is based
in San Francisco, the ad hoc
group presently numbers 150 and
is growing at the rate of fifteen
members a week, according to
Keith Stothers, a steamfitter in
the Physical Plant who
coordinates most of the group's
activities.
Widespread Plant Support
Despite the cool reception that
the group has received from the
University administration, the
organization, which is centered

report is the first of four articles
dealing with the Physical Plant
employees and the Teamsters
Union. The remaining articles will

Tomorrow's installment will deal
with an exchange of letters
between Teamsters and University
officials.)
There are two new officially
recognized unions on the Stanford
campus, at the Fire Department
and at the Stanford University
Press. In addition, several
employee associations have
received indirect, tacit approval.
The firemen belong to 1-12 of
the International Association of
Firefighters, a branch of the
AFL-CIO, while the printshop
employees belong to a Pressman's
Union.
A third union is struggling for
recognition and a voice in campus
labor affairs; it is this group, the
Ad Hoc Teamsters Union, that
will provide the focal point for
these articles.
Some background information
is necessary to understand the
position of the Ad Hoc Teamsters.
The development of the "union
movement" at Stanford dates
back to 1964-65, when some
electricians and electronics
technicians employed by SLAC
attempted to establish an
International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers (IBEW) local
there.
The University refused to
recognize either the group or the
union, and after a court fight, the
groups suspended their efforts.
In its court suit, the
electricians and the IBEW (which
is affiliated with the AFL-CIO)
asked the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) to
intervene in their behalf, but the
NLRB refused to do so, saying

that it had no jurisdiction where a
non-profit educational institution
was involved. That decision has
yet to be reversed, although it has
been challenged in recent years
and another suit, similar to the
one brought by the IBEW in
1 965, is presently under
consideration.
Renewed Campus Interest
In recent years, there has been
a renewed interest in the labor
union movement on campuses
throughout the nation. The
Teamsters, for example, maintain
locals on five private university
campuses, including the
University of Chicago and
Fordham University.
The Teamsters and other
unions have also established many
other locals at public, state-run
schools throughout the nation,
since these locals are not in
conflict with the NLRB's 1965
decision in the IBEW case and
other precedent actions.
The Ad Hoc Teamsters Union,
which calls itself the School,
Clerical Allied and Maintenence
Division of Teamsters Local 856,
is the bigge.s and probably the
most act'v- labor group on
campus.
An ou of the Freight
Checkers, Clerical Employees and
Helpers Local 856, which is based
in San Francisco, the ad hoc
group presently numbers 150 and
is growing at the rate of fifteen
members a week, according to
Keith Stothers, a steamfitter in
the Physical Plant who
coordinates most of the group's
activities.
Widespread Plant Support
Despite the cool reception that
the group has received from the
University administration, the
organization, which is centered
around the Physical Plant,
encompasses most of the
steamfitters, sheet iron workers,
air conditioning mechanics,

electricians, plumbers, machinists,
laborers and gardeners who are
assigned to the campus at large.
Some of the Plant's office help
and estimators have also signed
letters of intent indicating that
they desire an election to see
whether or not the Teamsters are
to be recognized as their
bargaining agent.

For the most part, the campus
unions and employee
organizations were brought about
by, and deal primarily with,
employee grievances.
Much of the interest in the Ad
Hoc Teamsters stems from the
University's threatened layoff of
the carpenters and painters
employed in the shops. In late
October and throughout
November, University officials
termed the painters and
carpenters "luxury" workers

because of the "high costs" and
"unproductivity" associated with
them
Physical Plant Director
Elbridge Bacon, who defined
'productivity' as "getting the job
done" in a November meeting
with employees, said that Physical
Plant labor is charged out at $9
per hour, while the average
worker receives about $4.50 per
hour. However, the $9 per hour
figure includes supervisors'
salaries, staff benefits,
miscellaneous casts, and operation and
maintenence of the plant's
vehicles.
Of fifteen carpenters on
campus in October, two are left.
The work that was scheduled for
the other thirteen has been
subcontracted to local firms at an
hourly rate of between $12.50
and $14.00 per man.
None of the painters have left
so far, but Stothers indicated that
most are insecure and that some
have made inquiries about other

opportunities. Most of the
department carpenters have gone
to Mills College. And, according
to one report, the University has
taken "at least one" application
for the position of carpenter from
a younger man than those he will
replace.
Requested to Intervene
The Teamsters Union entered
the picture in September of this
year, even before the layoff of the
painters and carpenters was
threatened. Acting upon the
request of Stothers, the union has
held several meetings with
Physical Plant employees and

others who might belong to the
catagories that the Teamsters are
seeking to represent.
Stothers said that he had asked
the Teamsters to hold exploratory
talks with the Plant workers
because he felt that the other
unions that might be able to
represent the group, like the
IBEW or other branches of the
AFL-CIO do not command
sufficient support in a situation
such as Stanford's. He said that
one reason for the rapid growth of
the Ad Hoc Teamsters was that
most of the Plant employees are
acquainted with the Teamsters'

power in this area and that the
men respected the Teamsters.
He said that many employees
of the Physical plant were
members of the Stanford
Employees Association (SEA) but
that the group was "too much of
a company union" to hold the
workers' support over a long
period of time. He said that their
lack of affiliation with bigger
organizations also weakened their
position.

letters between President Pitzer

conflict with the NLRB's 1965
decision in the IBEW case and
other precedent actions.
The Ad Hoc Teamsters Union,
which calls itself the School,
Clerical Allied and Maintenence
Division of Teamsters Local 856,
is the bigge.s and probably the
most act'v- labor group on
campus.
An ou of the Freight
Checkers, Clerical Employees and
Helpers Local 856, which is based
in San Francisco, the ad hoc
group presently numbers 150 and
is growing at the rate of fifteen
members a week, according to
Keith Stothers, a steamfitter in
the Physical Plant who
coordinates most of the group's
activities.
Widespread Plant Support
Despite the cool reception that
the group has received from the
University administration, the
organization, which is centered
around the Physical Plant,
encompasses most of the
steamfitters, sheet iron workers,
air conditioning mechanics,

electricians, plumbers, machinists,
laborers and gardeners who are
assigned to the campus at large.
Some of the Plant's office help
and estimators have also signed
letters of intent indicating that
they desire an election to see
whether or not the Teamsters are
to be recognized as their
bargaining agent.

For the most part, the campus
unions and employee
organizations were brought about
by, and deal primarily with,
employee grievances.
Much of the interest in the Ad
Hoc Teamsters stems from the
University's threatened layoff of
the carpenters and painters
employed in the shops. In late
October and throughout
November, University officials
termed the painters and
carpenters "luxury" workers

because of the "high costs" and
"unproductivity" associated with
them
Physical Plant Director
Elbridge Bacon, who defined
'productivity' as "getting the job
done" in a November meeting
with employees, said that Physical
Plant labor is charged out at $9
per hour, while the average
worker receives about $4.50 per
hour. However, the $9 per hour
figure includes supervisors'
salaries, staff benefits,
miscellaneous casts, and operation and
maintenence of the plant's
vehicles.
Of fifteen carpenters on
campus in October, two are left.
The work that was scheduled for
the other thirteen has been
subcontracted to local firms at an
hourly rate of between $12.50
and $14.00 per man.
None of the painters have left
so far, but Stothers indicated that
most are insecure and that some
have made inquiries about other

opportunities. Most of the
department carpenters have gone
to Mills College. And, according
to one report, the University has
taken "at least one" application
for the position of carpenter from
a younger man than those he will
replace.
Requested to Intervene
The Teamsters Union entered
the picture in September of this
year, even before the layoff of the
painters and carpenters was
threatened. Acting upon the
request of Stothers, the union has
held several meetings with
Physical Plant employees and

others who might belong to the
catagories that the Teamsters are
seeking to represent.
Stothers said that he had asked
the Teamsters to hold exploratory
talks with the Plant workers
because he felt that the other
unions that might be able to
represent the group, like the
IBEW or other branches of the
AFL-CIO do not command
sufficient support in a situation
such as Stanford's. He said that
one reason for the rapid growth of
the Ad Hoc Teamsters was that
most of the Plant employees are
acquainted with the Teamsters'

power in this area and that the
men respected the Teamsters.
He said that many employees
of the Physical plant were
members of the Stanford
Employees Association (SEA) but
that the group was "too much of
a company union" to hold the
workers' support over a long
period of time. He said that their
lack of affiliation with bigger
organizations also weakened their
position.
