Political Paranoia
Editor. THE DAILY:
Yale Braunstein's reaction to
the remarks of Provost Lyman
constitutes a textbook case in
political paranoia. Fortunately,
the facts of this sub-episode are
clearly on the record. Provost
Lyman's letter of January 12,
1970 to the Daily said, "If Mr.
Braunstein wishes to make the
decision a public issue, he should
make the entire record public, not
just those portions that suit his
purposes."
Apparently, Mr. Braunstein
saw this as a threat to make his
record public, although a fair
reading of the words, untainted
by political distortion, would
more accurately characterize them
as a challenge rather than a threat.
In any event, the next step, as
reported in the following day's
Daily was a communication to the
Provost from a "spokesman" for
Braunstein warning, "No aspects
of the case concerning Mr.
Braunstein are to be made public
under any circumstances. Any
failure in this regard will mean
that Mr. Braunstein will be forced
to sue the University for breach of
contract."
Mr. Braunstein's spokesman
evidently did not indicate which
particular contract might be
breached, but since the possible
violation of this alleged contract
right existed entirely in his
principal's own imagination, the
point is not a terribly important
one.
To complete the record, Mr.
Braunstein, himself, is quoted in
the Daily as huffing, "I have made
my decision and it is my absolute
right under the Judicial Charter. If
Lyman wishes to abridge my

rights let him rewrite the Judicial
Charter."
In a time when suspicion of
motives parades as realism and
demonology substitutes for
analysis, it may be difficult to
read words for their plain meaning
and to avoid imputing to others
intentions that one might have
himself were the circumstances to
be reversed. Mr. Braunstein's
sputtering upon finding himself
skewered by a public airing of his
desire for selective confidentiality
can be a valuable lesson to those
who are prepared to learn from it.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Since the cartoon of Stan
Krute in Tuesday's (Jan. 13) Daily
perpetuates a common
misconception with respect to the
current controversy concerning
the guidelines for science
education in California schools, it
is perhaps worth while to attempt
briefly to set the record straight.
Reliable information is still the
best basis for intelligent judgment,
even in the area of creation and
evolution.
1. The proposed changes in the
guidelines do not suggest that the
Genesis story of creation be
taught as an alternative to the
theory of evolution.
Z. What the proposed changes
do suggest is that since there are
and have been various scientific
theories involving a "creation"
concept, e.g., the steady-state
cosmology of Hoyle, the
guidelines should indicate that we
do not know that a continuous

uniform pattern of evolution is
adequate to describe all the
phenomena involved in the
development of the present state
of man and the world.
It is only a defense of honesty
and scientific integrity to present
scientific theories as partial and
incomplete descriptions of the
world. This is true of such
"well-established" theories as the
quantum theory and relativity
theory. It is certainly true of the
theory of evolution, which by its
very nature is much less
susceptible to crucial tests of its
validity. Yet the tendency has
been to present the general theory
of evolution, "amoeba-to-man",
as if the books were closed and all
problems were answered.
It is likewise only a defense of
honesty and scientific integrity to
emphasize that scientific theories
by their very nature do not treat
origins. Genuine origins are
singularities that scientists prefer
to work their way around, hence
the proposal of a cyclical universe
to avoid the singularity of the
"big bang" origin. Education in
the meaning of science should
stress this characteristic of
science, rather than giving the
impression that because
amoeba-to-man can be described,
the origin of the amoeba is a
matter of indifference.
Personally I think that the
attempt to use the word
"creation" in a scientific sense in
the same context as "evolution" is
sematically impossible because of
the strong historical and
emotional associations of these
terms. When the scientist speaks
about "creation" in his context,
including the conservation of
energy, he is using the word in a

very specialized way. To expect
the public to accept this use of
the word and to divorce it from
its common association with
religious writings is in my opinion
a hopeless goal.
It is important to realize,
however, that the present
controversy does not center on
the question: "Should the Bible
be taught as science?"
Sincerely yours,

Editor, THE DAILY:
May I remind Mr. Travis after
his bitter remarks directed
towards the Arab community at
Stanford that there are those who
do not regard Israel as the flower
of democracy, but as a festering
sore in Arab territory.
These people have a right to
demonstrate their disrespect for
Israel publicly, and may I assure
Mr. Travis that the Arabs are no
more "hoodlams" than the
concerned Americans who
demonstrate against the Vietnam
war here in the USA.
May I also suggest to Mr. Travis
that he be so courteous as to
extend to foreigners that
unquestionable right of freedom
of expression that he would
presumably allow his fellow
Americans, and not threaten them
with deportation orders he is
unable to bring about.

susceptible to crucial tests of its
validity. Yet the tendency has
been to present the general theory
of evolution, "amoeba-to-man",
as if the books were closed and all
problems were answered.
It is likewise only a defense of
honesty and scientific integrity to
emphasize that scientific theories
by their very nature do not treat
origins. Genuine origins are
singularities that scientists prefer
to work their way around, hence
the proposal of a cyclical universe
to avoid the singularity of the
"big bang" origin. Education in
the meaning of science should
stress this characteristic of
science, rather than giving the
impression that because
amoeba-to-man can be described,
the origin of the amoeba is a
matter of indifference.
Personally I think that the
attempt to use the word
"creation" in a scientific sense in
the same context as "evolution" is
sematically impossible because of
the strong historical and
emotional associations of these
terms. When the scientist speaks
about "creation" in his context,
including the conservation of
energy, he is using the word in a

very specialized way. To expect
the public to accept this use of
the word and to divorce it from
its common association with
religious writings is in my opinion
a hopeless goal.
It is important to realize,
however, that the present
controversy does not center on
the question: "Should the Bible
be taught as science?"

May I remind Mr. Travis after
his bitter remarks directed
towards the Arab community at
Stanford that there are those who
do not regard Israel as the flower
of democracy, but as a festering
sore in Arab territory.
These people have a right to
demonstrate their disrespect for
Israel publicly, and may I assure
Mr. Travis that the Arabs are no
more "hoodlams" than the
concerned Americans who
demonstrate against the Vietnam
war here in the USA.
May I also suggest to Mr. Travis
that he be so courteous as to
extend to foreigners that
unquestionable right of freedom
of expression that he would
presumably allow his fellow
Americans, and not threaten them
with deportation orders he is
unable to bring about.

Political Paranoia
Editor. THE DAILY:
Yale Braunstein's reaction to
the remarks of Provost Lyman
constitutes a textbook case in
political paranoia. Fortunately,
the facts of this sub-episode are
clearly on the record. Provost
Lyman's letter of January 12,
1970 to the Daily said, "If Mr.
Braunstein wishes to make the
decision a public issue, he should
make the entire record public, not
just those portions that suit his
purposes."
Apparently, Mr. Braunstein
saw this as a threat to make his
record public, although a fair
reading of the words, untainted
by political distortion, would
more accurately characterize them
as a challenge rather than a threat.
In any event, the next step, as
reported in the following day's
Daily was a communication to the
Provost from a "spokesman" for
Braunstein warning, "No aspects
of the case concerning Mr.
Braunstein are to be made public
under any circumstances. Any
failure in this regard will mean
that Mr. Braunstein will be forced
to sue the University for breach of
contract."
Mr. Braunstein's spokesman
evidently did not indicate which
particular contract might be
breached, but since the possible
violation of this alleged contract
right existed entirely in his
principal's own imagination, the
point is not a terribly important
one.
To complete the record, Mr.
Braunstein, himself, is quoted in
the Daily as huffing, "I have made
my decision and it is my absolute
right under the Judicial Charter. If
Lyman wishes to abridge my

rights let him rewrite the Judicial
Charter."
In a time when suspicion of
motives parades as realism and
demonology substitutes for
analysis, it may be difficult to
read words for their plain meaning
and to avoid imputing to others
intentions that one might have
himself were the circumstances to
be reversed. Mr. Braunstein's
sputtering upon finding himself
skewered by a public airing of his
desire for selective confidentiality
can be a valuable lesson to those
who are prepared to learn from it.

Since the cartoon of Stan
Krute in Tuesday's (Jan. 13) Daily
perpetuates a common
misconception with respect to the
current controversy concerning
the guidelines for science
education in California schools, it
is perhaps worth while to attempt
briefly to set the record straight.
Reliable information is still the
best basis for intelligent judgment,
even in the area of creation and
evolution.
1. The proposed changes in the
guidelines do not suggest that the
Genesis story of creation be
taught as an alternative to the
theory of evolution.
Z. What the proposed changes
do suggest is that since there are
and have been various scientific
theories involving a "creation"
concept, e.g., the steady-state
cosmology of Hoyle, the
guidelines should indicate that we
do not know that a continuous

uniform pattern of evolution is
adequate to describe all the
phenomena involved in the
development of the present state
of man and the world.
It is only a defense of honesty
and scientific integrity to present
scientific theories as partial and
incomplete descriptions of the
world. This is true of such
"well-established" theories as the
quantum theory and relativity
theory. It is certainly true of the
theory of evolution, which by its
very nature is much less

evidently did not indicate which
particular contract might be
breached, but since the possible
violation of this alleged contract
right existed entirely in his
principal's own imagination, the
point is not a terribly important
one.
To complete the record, Mr.
Braunstein, himself, is quoted in
the Daily as huffing, "I have made
my decision and it is my absolute
right under the Judicial Charter. If
Lyman wishes to abridge my

rights let him rewrite the Judicial
Charter."
In a time when suspicion of
motives parades as realism and
demonology substitutes for
analysis, it may be difficult to
read words for their plain meaning
and to avoid imputing to others
intentions that one might have
himself were the circumstances to
be reversed. Mr. Braunstein's
sputtering upon finding himself
skewered by a public airing of his
desire for selective confidentiality
can be a valuable lesson to those
who are prepared to learn from it.

Since the cartoon of Stan
Krute in Tuesday's (Jan. 13) Daily
perpetuates a common
misconception with respect to the
current controversy concerning
the guidelines for science
education in California schools, it
is perhaps worth while to attempt
briefly to set the record straight.
Reliable information is still the
best basis for intelligent judgment,
even in the area of creation and
evolution.
1. The proposed changes in the
guidelines do not suggest that the
Genesis story of creation be
taught as an alternative to the
theory of evolution.
Z. What the proposed changes
do suggest is that since there are
and have been various scientific
theories involving a "creation"
concept, e.g., the steady-state
cosmology of Hoyle, the
guidelines should indicate that we
do not know that a continuous

uniform pattern of evolution is
adequate to describe all the
phenomena involved in the
development of the present state
of man and the world.
It is only a defense of honesty
and scientific integrity to present
scientific theories as partial and
incomplete descriptions of the
world. This is true of such
"well-established" theories as the
quantum theory and relativity
theory. It is certainly true of the
theory of evolution, which by its
very nature is much less
susceptible to crucial tests of its
validity. Yet the tendency has
been to present the general theory
of evolution, "amoeba-to-man",
as if the books were closed and all
problems were answered.
It is likewise only a defense of
honesty and scientific integrity to
emphasize that scientific theories
by their very nature do not treat
origins. Genuine origins are
singularities that scientists prefer
to work their way around, hence
the proposal of a cyclical universe
to avoid the singularity of the
"big bang" origin. Education in
the meaning of science should
stress this characteristic of
science, rather than giving the
impression that because
amoeba-to-man can be described,
the origin of the amoeba is a
matter of indifference.
Personally I think that the
attempt to use the word
"creation" in a scientific sense in
the same context as "evolution" is
sematically impossible because of
the strong historical and
emotional associations of these
terms. When the scientist speaks
about "creation" in his context,
including the conservation of
energy, he is using the word in a

very specialized way. To expect
the public to accept this use of
the word and to divorce it from
its common association with
religious writings is in my opinion
a hopeless goal.
It is important to realize,
however, that the present
controversy does not center on
the question: "Should the Bible
be taught as science?"

Editor, THE DAILY:
May I remind Mr. Travis after
his bitter remarks directed
towards the Arab community at
Stanford that there are those who
do not regard Israel as the flower
of democracy, but as a festering
sore in Arab territory.
These people have a right to
demonstrate their disrespect for
Israel publicly, and may I assure
Mr. Travis that the Arabs are no
more "hoodlams" than the
concerned Americans who
demonstrate against the Vietnam
war here in the USA.
May I also suggest to Mr. Travis
that he be so courteous as to
extend to foreigners that
unquestionable right of freedom
of expression that he would
presumably allow his fellow
Americans, and not threaten them
with deportation orders he is
unable to bring about.

Political Paranoia
Editor. THE DAILY:
Yale Braunstein's reaction to
the remarks of Provost Lyman
constitutes a textbook case in
political paranoia. Fortunately,
the facts of this sub-episode are
clearly on the record. Provost
Lyman's letter of January 12,
1970 to the Daily said, "If Mr.
Braunstein wishes to make the
decision a public issue, he should
make the entire record public, not
just those portions that suit his
purposes."
Apparently, Mr. Braunstein
saw this as a threat to make his
record public, although a fair
reading of the words, untainted
by political distortion, would
more accurately characterize them
as a challenge rather than a threat.
In any event, the next step, as
reported in the following day's
Daily was a communication to the
Provost from a "spokesman" for
Braunstein warning, "No aspects
of the case concerning Mr.
Braunstein are to be made public
under any circumstances. Any
failure in this regard will mean
that Mr. Braunstein will be forced
to sue the University for breach of
contract."
Mr. Braunstein's spokesman
evidently did not indicate which
particular contract might be
breached, but since the possible
violation of this alleged contract
right existed entirely in his
principal's own imagination, the
point is not a terribly important
