# Students Staff Surplus Surgeons, Sierra Camp Doctor Says Here
## 
### WILLIAM JAHNKE 
Stanford students will have
until Feb. 2 to apply for summer
employment at the Stanford
Sierra Camp, owned and operated
by the Stanford Alumni
Association for alumni, faculty,
staff, parents of Stanford
students, and their families. The
camp accomodates approximately
200 campers per week and will
operate from June 20 to
September 5.
The Sierra Camp is located
along the southwest shore of
Fallen Leaf Lake and near the
southern end of Lake Tahoe.
Although the camp is only a short
drive from the activity of
Stateline, Nevada, the atmosphere
is relaxed. The cabins have a rustic
appearance, but they are not
without modern utilities.
Programs are planned for all
age groups and for all interests.
The Papoose Playground is a
supervised play area for children
three years or older. Handicraft
instruction, movies, nature walks,
and campfires are among the
activities for preteens. Teenagers
hold dances and cookouts in
addition to participating in the
cultural activities established for
the benefit of the adults.
The recreation facilities are
based on the wilderness of the
Sierra Nevada and on Fallen Leaf
Lake. On the waterfront there is
boating, sailing, swimming, water
skiing, and fishing. The very
young fisherman has access to the
Witches' Pool, a private trout
pond for children under sixteen.
Several horseback rides are
organized each week, and there
are many opportunities for nature
hikes. Athletic facilities vary from
tennis to archery.
To entertain the adults during
the evenings, a stimulating
cultural program is planned. A
lounge including a library and a
bar, is set aside for the exclusive
use of the adults. Art instruction
is offered daily. Among the more
successful of the camp's activities
is, a speaker program of
prominent members of the
Stanford faculty. The student
staff members offer entertainment
not only by leading singing and
games, but also by holding panel
discussions on topics related to
student life and student thought
at Stanford University. In this
sense, the Camp is a
communications device between
the alumni and the student.
Because the success of the
camp relies so heavily upon the
effectiveness of the student staff
members, Mr. Hildrith of the
Alumni Association, director of
the Sierra Camp, urges any
student who is enthusiastic about
the outdoors and about working
with people of any age to apply.
The jobs available include hashing
in the dining room, supervising
the Camp's fountain and store,
supervising children between the
ages of three and ten, instructing
arts and crafts, organizing hiking,
boating, and sailing, and
lifesaving. In addition, a
nightwatchman and an accountant
are needed. Some of these
openings involve working all hours
on one job; others involve
working in several different areas
each part-time (e.g. hashing
part-time and lifesaving
part-time). Besides these duties
each employee must clean cabins
each Saturday between the arrival
and departure of the campers.
There are approximately thirty
positions available. Each student
will work approximately
forty-four hours per week over a
six-day period with one day off. A
salary will be paid, and room and
board will be furnished. Student
staff members may use the
Camp's facilities when they are
not being used by campers.
Students who enjoy the

outdoors and who enjoy the
company of other people would
enjoy working at the Camp as
other students have in past
summers. To one female student
her camp experiences were so
rewarding that she is willing to
relinquish a high-paying job in her
field of interest just to work at
the Camp again. Don Nanney,
who was last summer's program
and recreation director and who
has worked at the Sierra Camp for

the past three summers
enthusiastically described his
experiences. The camp life gave
him "the opportunity to meet
many people who became his best
friends.'? Furthermore, the
student can become acquainted
with faculty members and alumni
on an informal basis amid the
pleasant atmosphere of the
mountains and the lake. Don says
that unless the employee is
working full-time on one activity,
he is on a weekly schedule, never
doing the same tasks each day.
Hence, the duties never become
monotonous or repetitious.
Having been employed at
commercial resorts previously,
Don describes the Stanford Sierra
Camp as more informal and more
stimulating. In the past, he notes,
there have always been more
women staff members than men;
this is one place where the
notorious Stanford ratio does not
apply. Finally, Don expressed the
attitude which student staffers
should have: the student
employees should want to have
fun while working and want to
help the campers have fun.
Those who are interested in
applying for summer work should
see Jan Ready in the Bowman
Alumni House for an application
and for an interview. The
application deadline is Feb. 2,
1970. Applicants will be informed
of their status prior to the end of
the Winter Quarter so that they
may respond within the first ten
days of the Spring Quarter.

An anesthesiologist here says
the United States has too many
surgeons.
He poses the question of
whether or not an excessive
number of surgical operations is
performed, implying a variation in
the theme of Parkinson's Law:
where there are too many
surgeons they will fill their time
by doing too many operations.
Dr. John P. Bunker says he is
concerned about the problem
because the United States has an
excessive number of physicians in
some specialties and not enough
in others.
He wonders if the country
provides "luxury" surgery for the
well-to-do while failing to provide
proper care for the poor.
Dr. Dunker is professor and
chairman of the department of
anesthesia at the School of
Medicine. His views appear in the
January 15 issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine.
He draws his conclusions from
a comparative study of operations
and surgeons in the United States
and in England and Wales.
"The American surgeon is
more aggressive," he writes, "He
appears to hold higher
expectations of what surgery can
offer in the treatment of disease,
whereas the British surgeon is

more modest in his expectations,
possibly more realistic, but also
possibly missing opportunities for
surgical care."
American surgeons operate
nearly twice as ofter as the
English and Welsh, Dr. Bunker
reports, and offers statistics to
support his thesis.
Under the British National
Health Service, "the surgeon is a
true consultant," Dr. Bunker
explains. "He sees patients only as
they are referred to him by the
general practitioner or internist,
and he is hospital based.
"The American surgeon, by
contrast, may function as
consultant exactly as his British
counterpart, but he may also
accept patients without referral,
or he may be the primary
physician-general practitioner,
referring the patient to himself for
surgery, and thus creating his own
demand."
The Stanford anesthesiologist
stresses that his findings do not
necessarily lead to the conclusion
that American surgeons operate
more often as the public health
might justify. The direct
measurement of the quality of
medical care is exceedingly
difficuly, he says.

staff members may use the
Camp's facilities when they are
not being used by campers.
Students who enjoy the

outdoors and who enjoy the
company of other people would
enjoy working at the Camp as
other students have in past
summers. To one female student
her camp experiences were so
rewarding that she is willing to
relinquish a high-paying job in her
field of interest just to work at
the Camp again. Don Nanney,
who was last summer's program
and recreation director and who
has worked at the Sierra Camp for

the past three summers
enthusiastically described his
experiences. The camp life gave
him "the opportunity to meet
many people who became his best
friends.'? Furthermore, the
student can become acquainted
with faculty members and alumni
on an informal basis amid the
pleasant atmosphere of the
mountains and the lake. Don says
that unless the employee is
working full-time on one activity,
he is on a weekly schedule, never
doing the same tasks each day.
Hence, the duties never become
monotonous or repetitious.
Having been employed at
commercial resorts previously,
Don describes the Stanford Sierra
Camp as more informal and more
stimulating. In the past, he notes,
there have always been more
women staff members than men;
this is one place where the
notorious Stanford ratio does not
apply. Finally, Don expressed the
attitude which student staffers
should have: the student
employees should want to have
fun while working and want to
help the campers have fun.
Those who are interested in
applying for summer work should
see Jan Ready in the Bowman
Alumni House for an application
and for an interview. The
application deadline is Feb. 2,
1970. Applicants will be informed
of their status prior to the end of
the Winter Quarter so that they
may respond within the first ten
days of the Spring Quarter.

An anesthesiologist here says
the United States has too many
surgeons.
He poses the question of
whether or not an excessive
number of surgical operations is
performed, implying a variation in
the theme of Parkinson's Law:
where there are too many
surgeons they will fill their time
by doing too many operations.
Dr. John P. Bunker says he is
concerned about the problem
because the United States has an
excessive number of physicians in
some specialties and not enough
in others.
He wonders if the country
provides "luxury" surgery for the
well-to-do while failing to provide
proper care for the poor.
Dr. Dunker is professor and
chairman of the department of
anesthesia at the School of
Medicine. His views appear in the
January 15 issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine.
He draws his conclusions from
a comparative study of operations
and surgeons in the United States
and in England and Wales.
"The American surgeon is
more aggressive," he writes, "He
appears to hold higher
expectations of what surgery can
offer in the treatment of disease,
whereas the British surgeon is

more modest in his expectations,
possibly more realistic, but also
possibly missing opportunities for
surgical care."
American surgeons operate
nearly twice as ofter as the
English and Welsh, Dr. Bunker
reports, and offers statistics to
support his thesis.
Under the British National
Health Service, "the surgeon is a
true consultant," Dr. Bunker
explains. "He sees patients only as
they are referred to him by the
general practitioner or internist,
and he is hospital based.
"The American surgeon, by
contrast, may function as
consultant exactly as his British
counterpart, but he may also
accept patients without referral,
or he may be the primary
physician-general practitioner,
referring the patient to himself for
surgery, and thus creating his own
demand."
The Stanford anesthesiologist
stresses that his findings do not
necessarily lead to the conclusion
that American surgeons operate
more often as the public health
might justify. The direct
measurement of the quality of
medical care is exceedingly
difficuly, he says.

Stanford students will have
until Feb. 2 to apply for summer
employment at the Stanford
Sierra Camp, owned and operated
by the Stanford Alumni
Association for alumni, faculty,
staff, parents of Stanford
students, and their families. The
camp accomodates approximately
200 campers per week and will
operate from June 20 to
September 5.
The Sierra Camp is located
along the southwest shore of
Fallen Leaf Lake and near the
southern end of Lake Tahoe.
Although the camp is only a short
drive from the activity of
Stateline, Nevada, the atmosphere
is relaxed. The cabins have a rustic
appearance, but they are not
without modern utilities.
Programs are planned for all
age groups and for all interests.
The Papoose Playground is a
supervised play area for children
three years or older. Handicraft
instruction, movies, nature walks,
and campfires are among the
activities for preteens. Teenagers
hold dances and cookouts in
addition to participating in the
cultural activities established for
the benefit of the adults.
The recreation facilities are
based on the wilderness of the
Sierra Nevada and on Fallen Leaf
Lake. On the waterfront there is
boating, sailing, swimming, water
skiing, and fishing. The very
young fisherman has access to the
Witches' Pool, a private trout
pond for children under sixteen.
Several horseback rides are
organized each week, and there
are many opportunities for nature
hikes. Athletic facilities vary from
tennis to archery.
To entertain the adults during
the evenings, a stimulating
cultural program is planned. A
lounge including a library and a
bar, is set aside for the exclusive
use of the adults. Art instruction
is offered daily. Among the more
successful of the camp's activities
is, a speaker program of
prominent members of the
Stanford faculty. The student
staff members offer entertainment
not only by leading singing and
games, but also by holding panel
discussions on topics related to
student life and student thought
at Stanford University. In this
sense, the Camp is a
communications device between
the alumni and the student.
Because the success of the
camp relies so heavily upon the
effectiveness of the student staff
members, Mr. Hildrith of the
Alumni Association, director of
the Sierra Camp, urges any
student who is enthusiastic about
the outdoors and about working
with people of any age to apply.
The jobs available include hashing
in the dining room, supervising
the Camp's fountain and store,
supervising children between the
ages of three and ten, instructing
arts and crafts, organizing hiking,
boating, and sailing, and
lifesaving. In addition, a
nightwatchman and an accountant
are needed. Some of these
openings involve working all hours
on one job; others involve
working in several different areas
each part-time (e.g. hashing
part-time and lifesaving
part-time). Besides these duties
each employee must clean cabins
each Saturday between the arrival
and departure of the campers.
There are approximately thirty
positions available. Each student
will work approximately
forty-four hours per week over a
six-day period with one day off. A
salary will be paid, and room and
board will be furnished. Student
staff members may use the
Camp's facilities when they are
not being used by campers.

Under the British National
Health Service, "the surgeon is a
true consultant," Dr. Bunker
explains. "He sees patients only as
they are referred to him by the
general practitioner or internist,
and he is hospital based.
"The American surgeon, by
contrast, may function as
consultant exactly as his British
counterpart, but he may also
accept patients without referral,
or he may be the primary
physician-general practitioner,
referring the patient to himself for
surgery, and thus creating his own
demand."
The Stanford anesthesiologist
stresses that his findings do not
necessarily lead to the conclusion
that American surgeons operate
more often as the public health
might justify. The direct
measurement of the quality of
medical care is exceedingly
difficuly, he says.

Stanford students will have
until Feb. 2 to apply for summer
employment at the Stanford
Sierra Camp, owned and operated
by the Stanford Alumni
Association for alumni, faculty,
staff, parents of Stanford
students, and their families. The
camp accomodates approximately
200 campers per week and will
operate from June 20 to
September 5.
The Sierra Camp is located
along the southwest shore of
Fallen Leaf Lake and near the
southern end of Lake Tahoe.
Although the camp is only a short
drive from the activity of
Stateline, Nevada, the atmosphere
is relaxed. The cabins have a rustic
appearance, but they are not
without modern utilities.
Programs are planned for all
age groups and for all interests.
The Papoose Playground is a
supervised play area for children
three years or older. Handicraft
instruction, movies, nature walks,
and campfires are among the
activities for preteens. Teenagers
hold dances and cookouts in
addition to participating in the
cultural activities established for
the benefit of the adults.
The recreation facilities are
based on the wilderness of the
Sierra Nevada and on Fallen Leaf
Lake. On the waterfront there is
boating, sailing, swimming, water
skiing, and fishing. The very
young fisherman has access to the
Witches' Pool, a private trout
pond for children under sixteen.
Several horseback rides are
organized each week, and there
are many opportunities for nature
hikes. Athletic facilities vary from
tennis to archery.
To entertain the adults during
the evenings, a stimulating
cultural program is planned. A
lounge including a library and a
bar, is set aside for the exclusive
use of the adults. Art instruction
is offered daily. Among the more
successful of the camp's activities
is, a speaker program of
prominent members of the
Stanford faculty. The student
staff members offer entertainment
not only by leading singing and
games, but also by holding panel
discussions on topics related to
student life and student thought
at Stanford University. In this
sense, the Camp is a
communications device between
the alumni and the student.
Because the success of the
camp relies so heavily upon the
effectiveness of the student staff
members, Mr. Hildrith of the
Alumni Association, director of
the Sierra Camp, urges any
student who is enthusiastic about
the outdoors and about working
with people of any age to apply.
The jobs available include hashing
in the dining room, supervising
the Camp's fountain and store,
supervising children between the
ages of three and ten, instructing
arts and crafts, organizing hiking,
boating, and sailing, and
lifesaving. In addition, a
nightwatchman and an accountant
are needed. Some of these
openings involve working all hours
on one job; others involve
working in several different areas
each part-time (e.g. hashing
part-time and lifesaving
part-time). Besides these duties
each employee must clean cabins
each Saturday between the arrival
and departure of the campers.
There are approximately thirty
positions available. Each student
will work approximately
forty-four hours per week over a
six-day period with one day off. A
salary will be paid, and room and
board will be furnished. Student
staff members may use the
Camp's facilities when they are
not being used by campers.
Students who enjoy the

outdoors and who enjoy the
company of other people would
enjoy working at the Camp as
other students have in past
summers. To one female student
her camp experiences were so
rewarding that she is willing to
relinquish a high-paying job in her
field of interest just to work at
the Camp again. Don Nanney,
who was last summer's program
and recreation director and who
has worked at the Sierra Camp for

the past three summers
enthusiastically described his
experiences. The camp life gave
him "the opportunity to meet
many people who became his best
friends.'? Furthermore, the
student can become acquainted
with faculty members and alumni
on an informal basis amid the
pleasant atmosphere of the
mountains and the lake. Don says
that unless the employee is
working full-time on one activity,
he is on a weekly schedule, never
doing the same tasks each day.
Hence, the duties never become
monotonous or repetitious.
Having been employed at
commercial resorts previously,
Don describes the Stanford Sierra
Camp as more informal and more
stimulating. In the past, he notes,
there have always been more
women staff members than men;
this is one place where the
notorious Stanford ratio does not
apply. Finally, Don expressed the
attitude which student staffers
should have: the student
employees should want to have
fun while working and want to
help the campers have fun.
Those who are interested in
applying for summer work should
see Jan Ready in the Bowman
Alumni House for an application
and for an interview. The
application deadline is Feb. 2,
1970. Applicants will be informed
of their status prior to the end of
the Winter Quarter so that they
may respond within the first ten
days of the Spring Quarter.

An anesthesiologist here says
the United States has too many
surgeons.
He poses the question of
whether or not an excessive
number of surgical operations is
performed, implying a variation in
the theme of Parkinson's Law:
where there are too many
surgeons they will fill their time
by doing too many operations.
Dr. John P. Bunker says he is
concerned about the problem
because the United States has an
excessive number of physicians in
some specialties and not enough
in others.
He wonders if the country
provides "luxury" surgery for the
well-to-do while failing to provide
proper care for the poor.
Dr. Dunker is professor and
chairman of the department of
anesthesia at the School of
Medicine. His views appear in the
January 15 issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine.
He draws his conclusions from
a comparative study of operations
and surgeons in the United States
and in England and Wales.
"The American surgeon is
more aggressive," he writes, "He
appears to hold higher
expectations of what surgery can
offer in the treatment of disease,
whereas the British surgeon is

more modest in his expectations,
possibly more realistic, but also
possibly missing opportunities for
surgical care."
American surgeons operate
nearly twice as ofter as the
English and Welsh, Dr. Bunker
reports, and offers statistics to
support his thesis.
Under the British National
Health Service, "the surgeon is a
true consultant," Dr. Bunker
explains. "He sees patients only as
they are referred to him by the

ages of three and ten, instructing
arts and crafts, organizing hiking,
boating, and sailing, and
lifesaving. In addition, a
nightwatchman and an accountant
are needed. Some of these
openings involve working all hours
on one job; others involve
working in several different areas
each part-time (e.g. hashing
part-time and lifesaving
part-time). Besides these duties
each employee must clean cabins
each Saturday between the arrival
and departure of the campers.
There are approximately thirty
positions available. Each student
will work approximately
forty-four hours per week over a
six-day period with one day off. A
salary will be paid, and room and
board will be furnished. Student
staff members may use the
Camp's facilities when they are
not being used by campers.
Students who enjoy the

outdoors and who enjoy the
company of other people would
enjoy working at the Camp as
other students have in past
summers. To one female student
her camp experiences were so
rewarding that she is willing to
relinquish a high-paying job in her
field of interest just to work at
the Camp again. Don Nanney,
who was last summer's program
and recreation director and who
has worked at the Sierra Camp for

the past three summers
enthusiastically described his
experiences. The camp life gave
him "the opportunity to meet
many people who became his best
friends.'? Furthermore, the
student can become acquainted
with faculty members and alumni
on an informal basis amid the
pleasant atmosphere of the
mountains and the lake. Don says
that unless the employee is
working full-time on one activity,
he is on a weekly schedule, never
doing the same tasks each day.
Hence, the duties never become
monotonous or repetitious.
Having been employed at
commercial resorts previously,
Don describes the Stanford Sierra
Camp as more informal and more
stimulating. In the past, he notes,
there have always been more
women staff members than men;
this is one place where the
notorious Stanford ratio does not
apply. Finally, Don expressed the
attitude which student staffers
should have: the student
employees should want to have
fun while working and want to
help the campers have fun.
Those who are interested in
applying for summer work should
see Jan Ready in the Bowman
Alumni House for an application
and for an interview. The
application deadline is Feb. 2,
1970. Applicants will be informed
of their status prior to the end of
the Winter Quarter so that they
may respond within the first ten
days of the Spring Quarter.

An anesthesiologist here says
the United States has too many
surgeons.
He poses the question of
whether or not an excessive
number of surgical operations is
performed, implying a variation in
the theme of Parkinson's Law:
where there are too many
surgeons they will fill their time
by doing too many operations.
Dr. John P. Bunker says he is
concerned about the problem
because the United States has an
excessive number of physicians in
some specialties and not enough
in others.
He wonders if the country
provides "luxury" surgery for the
well-to-do while failing to provide
proper care for the poor.
Dr. Dunker is professor and
chairman of the department of
anesthesia at the School of
Medicine. His views appear in the
January 15 issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine.
He draws his conclusions from
a comparative study of operations
and surgeons in the United States
and in England and Wales.
"The American surgeon is
more aggressive," he writes, "He
appears to hold higher
expectations of what surgery can
offer in the treatment of disease,
whereas the British surgeon is

more modest in his expectations,
possibly more realistic, but also
possibly missing opportunities for
surgical care."
American surgeons operate
nearly twice as ofter as the
English and Welsh, Dr. Bunker
reports, and offers statistics to
support his thesis.
Under the British National
Health Service, "the surgeon is a
true consultant," Dr. Bunker
explains. "He sees patients only as
they are referred to him by the
general practitioner or internist,
and he is hospital based.
"The American surgeon, by
contrast, may function as
consultant exactly as his British
counterpart, but he may also
accept patients without referral,
or he may be the primary
physician-general practitioner,
referring the patient to himself for
surgery, and thus creating his own
demand."
The Stanford anesthesiologist
stresses that his findings do not
necessarily lead to the conclusion
that American surgeons operate
more often as the public health
might justify. The direct
measurement of the quality of
medical care is exceedingly
difficuly, he says.
