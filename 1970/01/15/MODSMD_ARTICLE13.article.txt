# Low-cost Housing Hearings Continue
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
The President's Ad Hoc
Committee on low cost housing
will continue hearings tonight at
7:30 in Tressider, Room 275. The
hearings began Tuesday night
when several local organizations
made recommendations to the
committee.
The 15 man Ad Hoc
Committee, appointed by
President Pitzer in late October,
has been meeting once a week
since mid November in its study
of the housing shortage.
According to Chairman Gorden
Wright, the committee was
charged by Pitzer, "to study and
report to him on the many
complicated and sensitive issues
which surround housing on
Stanford lands."
Wright made clear in his
opening statement at Tuesday's
meeting that the committee has
no power to make or even
recommend a plan for University
housing policy. It can only advise
the President and suggest several
alternatives which he might
follow.
Richard Kershner, representing
the United Stanford Employees
(SE), denounced the Stanford
housing policies saying, "It is time
they stopped living off the
people." He suggested that the
University start taking a "people
oriented" view.
Specifically, he called for 6000
units of housing with 2500 on
Stanford lands, rent rates adjusted
according to income, positive
ecological environment, and a
good transportation system which
could be "along non-conventional
lines."
A representative of the
Stanford Conservation Society
suggested that of the many
proposed sites for low-cost
housing, only those on the
flatlands behind the medical
school, and in the industrial park
should be used. He said the sites
in the foothills should not be used
because the land is unstable, and
for aesthetic reasons.
A report from the Frenchman's
Hills Association said that there
was no consenses of opinion from
the people of that development.
Although some members
reportedly favored opening the
area for low-cost housing, others
complained that the University
had promised that the area would
be restricted for the use of only
certain faculty and staff. Other
members said that if low and
moderate cost houses were going
to be built in Frenchman's Hills,
then th«£ should be built in all
the other faculty and staff areas.
Professor Feldman,
representing the Junior Faculty
Forum, recommended that the
University build, "the largest

number of housing units
compatible with good design." He
said that no presently conceivable
program could meet all the need.

The committee will hold a
second public hearing tonight at 7
p.m. in room 270 of Tresidder
Union to hear community
representatives give their views on
what housing projects Stanford
will undertake.
Mark Weiss, representing the
Grass Roots organization, began
by expressing his dissatisfaction
with the committee, and
comparing it with the SRI study
committee of last year. He then
told the committee that in its
report it should recommend the
following: Stanford should give
land for free for low-cost housing,
it should attempt to get lower or
no interest loans for the housing,
it should take a loss in building
the housing regardless of federal
support, it should attempt to end
the war in Vietnam which causes
the housing shortage, and it
should stop military-industrial
growth and the financial center,
while at the same time creating
jobs for construction, services,
and meeting social needs.

certain faculty and staff. Other
members said that if low and
moderate cost houses were going
to be built in Frenchman's Hills,
then th«£ should be built in all
the other faculty and staff areas.
Professor Feldman,
representing the Junior Faculty
Forum, recommended that the
University build, "the largest

number of housing units
compatible with good design." He
said that no presently conceivable
program could meet all the need.

The committee will hold a
second public hearing tonight at 7
p.m. in room 270 of Tresidder
Union to hear community
representatives give their views on
what housing projects Stanford
will undertake.
Mark Weiss, representing the
Grass Roots organization, began
by expressing his dissatisfaction
with the committee, and
comparing it with the SRI study
committee of last year. He then
told the committee that in its
report it should recommend the
following: Stanford should give
land for free for low-cost housing,
it should attempt to get lower or
no interest loans for the housing,
it should take a loss in building
the housing regardless of federal
support, it should attempt to end
the war in Vietnam which causes
the housing shortage, and it
should stop military-industrial
growth and the financial center,
while at the same time creating
jobs for construction, services,
and meeting social needs.
The President's Ad Hoc
Committee on low cost housing
will continue hearings tonight at
7:30 in Tressider, Room 275. The
hearings began Tuesday night
when several local organizations
made recommendations to the
committee.
The 15 man Ad Hoc
Committee, appointed by
President Pitzer in late October,
has been meeting once a week
since mid November in its study
of the housing shortage.
According to Chairman Gorden
Wright, the committee was
charged by Pitzer, "to study and
report to him on the many
complicated and sensitive issues
which surround housing on
Stanford lands."
Wright made clear in his
opening statement at Tuesday's
meeting that the committee has
no power to make or even
recommend a plan for University
housing policy. It can only advise
the President and suggest several
alternatives which he might
follow.
Richard Kershner, representing
the United Stanford Employees
(SE), denounced the Stanford
housing policies saying, "It is time
they stopped living off the
people." He suggested that the
University start taking a "people
oriented" view.
Specifically, he called for 6000
units of housing with 2500 on
Stanford lands, rent rates adjusted
according to income, positive
ecological environment, and a
good transportation system which
could be "along non-conventional
lines."
A representative of the
Stanford Conservation Society
suggested that of the many
proposed sites for low-cost
housing, only those on the
flatlands behind the medical
school, and in the industrial park
should be used. He said the sites
in the foothills should not be used
because the land is unstable, and
for aesthetic reasons.
A report from the Frenchman's
Hills Association said that there
was no consenses of opinion from
the people of that development.
Although some members
reportedly favored opening the
area for low-cost housing, others
complained that the University
had promised that the area would
be restricted for the use of only
certain faculty and staff. Other
members said that if low and
moderate cost houses were going
to be built in Frenchman's Hills,
then th«£ should be built in all
the other faculty and staff areas.
