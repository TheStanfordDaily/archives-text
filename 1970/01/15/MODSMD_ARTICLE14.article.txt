# New Urban Coalition Fights Local Problems
## 
### 
Ira Hall, director of the
Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition
outlined the history and activities

of his organization Tuesday night
as a guest speaker in Serra lounge.
The Coalition, he said, grew
out of the summer riots of 1967.
Nationally, it brings together
diverse elements of the
community to attack problems of
housing, employment, health, and
law. Here, on the local level, the
Coalition spans the half million
people from Sunnyvale to San
Mateo. The policy committee
combines business executives,
mayors, members of minority
communities, and elements of the
Stanford community, such as
Provost Richard Lyman.
The Mid-Peninsula has the
same problems as Watts or
Harlem, Hall said, the difference
being in magnitude. "Given the
large magnitude of resourses and
the small magnitude of the
problems, if we can not solve
them the outlook is dismal for the
large metropolitan areas."
Business men here are more
interested in change then they are
in other areas, he said.
The Coalition tries to solve
problems by specifying restraints,
and then marshalling resources to
implement a program, Hall stated
In low cost housing, he said,
restraints include local high costs
of labor and land, lack of
expertise in handling FHA and
HUD red tape, lack of capital, and
racism. "Many people will agree
low cost housing is a great idea,
they just don't want it built next
to them."
The Coalition can provide
technical expertise and parlay the

moral and capital commitment of
other organizations such as
churches, Hall said. The UC is
currently working on a 32 unit
pilot project in Mountain View
which will contain 2Vi acres of
housing and a 2'/a acre park, he
said, and they are looking for $1
million to form a Housing
Development Corporation.
The Coalition has joined with
corporations to form investment
companies for black
entrepreneurs. Currently, these
firms will provide $450,000 to
this area, which in turn can be
used by entrepreneurs to gain an
additional $1.8 million in loans
guaranteed by the federal Small
Business Administration. Ten
business proposals thus far have
been tentatively approved, and
others are being considered.
In the area of health, the
Coalition is working with the East
Palo Alto community health
center in trying to obtain a new
building, and to change the
structure of the Center. Hall said
that through history, health
centers have been demeaning and
inefficient, and that the center in
East Palo Alto would like to
become a center for the entire
community, rather than just for
the poor.
The Coalition can use student
participation, Hall said. "I'm not
just looking for students not just
as students, I'm looking for
students as minds," he added,
saying that students can
participate as full coalition
members in every task force.

Nationally, it brings together
diverse elements of the
community to attack problems of
housing, employment, health, and
law. Here, on the local level, the
Coalition spans the half million
people from Sunnyvale to San
Mateo. The policy committee
combines business executives,
mayors, members of minority
communities, and elements of the
Stanford community, such as
Provost Richard Lyman.
The Mid-Peninsula has the
same problems as Watts or
Harlem, Hall said, the difference
being in magnitude. "Given the
large magnitude of resourses and
the small magnitude of the
problems, if we can not solve
them the outlook is dismal for the
large metropolitan areas."
Business men here are more
interested in change then they are
in other areas, he said.
The Coalition tries to solve
problems by specifying restraints,
and then marshalling resources to
implement a program, Hall stated
In low cost housing, he said,
restraints include local high costs
of labor and land, lack of
expertise in handling FHA and
HUD red tape, lack of capital, and
racism. "Many people will agree
low cost housing is a great idea,
they just don't want it built next
to them."
The Coalition can provide
technical expertise and parlay the

moral and capital commitment of
other organizations such as
churches, Hall said. The UC is
currently working on a 32 unit
pilot project in Mountain View
which will contain 2Vi acres of
housing and a 2'/a acre park, he
said, and they are looking for $1
million to form a Housing
Development Corporation.
The Coalition has joined with
corporations to form investment
companies for black
entrepreneurs. Currently, these
firms will provide $450,000 to
this area, which in turn can be
used by entrepreneurs to gain an
additional $1.8 million in loans
guaranteed by the federal Small
Business Administration. Ten
business proposals thus far have
been tentatively approved, and
others are being considered.
In the area of health, the
Coalition is working with the East
Palo Alto community health
center in trying to obtain a new
building, and to change the
structure of the Center. Hall said
that through history, health
centers have been demeaning and
inefficient, and that the center in
East Palo Alto would like to
become a center for the entire
community, rather than just for
the poor.
The Coalition can use student
participation, Hall said. "I'm not
just looking for students not just
as students, I'm looking for
students as minds," he added,
saying that students can
participate as full coalition
members in every task force.
Ira Hall, director of the
Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition
outlined the history and activities

of his organization Tuesday night
as a guest speaker in Serra lounge.
The Coalition, he said, grew
out of the summer riots of 1967.
