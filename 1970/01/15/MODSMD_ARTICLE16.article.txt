## Transfer Trauma 
### NEIL ARNET 
Dear Bob,
Hello there. Thought I'd let
you know about an amazing
coincidence. Yesterday I met a
girl who transferred from the
University of Florida. Her name is
Naoimi Goldman. She used to
date Bart - you might ask him
about her..
Anyway, she was telling me all
the problems she's been having
making the transition to Stanford,
It seems she doesn't know who to
talk to for help. Naturally, I
offered my services. She's really
quite upset, but don't worry - it's
all part of the transfer syndrome.
That's one of my pet peeves -
the staus of transfer students.
Essentially transfers just don't
evoke anyone's special interest.
Whereas freshman have all kinds
of assistance and opportunities,
and whereas graduates have the
attention of their individual
departments, transfers receive no
special aid.
Large Gransfer Body
And it's not as if there were
only a handful of transfers. Last
year over 500 transfers were
admitted, and this Fall and Winter
450 have already joined the
Stanford community. In fact,
almost one out of every four
undergraduates began his study at
some other institution.
usually past transfers themselves.
However, especially in Fall
Quarter, there remains the
problem of fully integrating these
new students into the educational
community
Forced Off in Fall
In the Fall, dormitory housing
remains rather tight before
registration, and so most transfers
are forced to reside off campus or

in fraternities. They have as a
circle of friends other transfers,
or, in the case of fraternity men,
their brothers. This is indeed
unfortunate, if only because the
circle is so limited.
To me the greatness of
Stanford lies in its diversity and
its freedom for creativity, and all
its students deserve to
participate in this greatness.
Unfortunately many transfers
never do. I doubt this can be said
of many who entered here as
freshman, for freshman are forced
by circumstance to deal with the
diversity and freedom of
Stanford.
Bleak Outlook
Well, this portrayal of transfer
life has been rather bleak and
deliberately so, but there are ways
that individual transfers can and
do integrate themselves into the
Stanford community They can
bccome eating associates at the
dorms or join one of the Eating
Clubs. Then, of course, there
exists a tremendously wide range
of activities - writing for any one
of the publications, acting in or
working on the crew for plays or
simply ushering for them, playing
stramurals, or perhaps even
hashing.
Well, Bob, that's about it on
the topic of transfers. Actually I
could explain the plan to have
orientation in the middle of the
quarter (when people better know
what problems face them) rather
than before it even begins, but
that would take too much time
especially since I've got to get at
least some sleep.
As ever,
Neil
