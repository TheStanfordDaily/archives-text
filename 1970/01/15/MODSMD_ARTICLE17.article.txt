# Stanford Art Gallery Commemorates Matisse
## 
### BONNIE KOEHLER 
The one-hundredth birthday
of the French artist Henri
Matisse is being
commemorated by an
exhibition of his drawings
and prints at the Stanford
Art Gallery through January
25th. Happy Birthday Henri!
The exhibition of 61
pieces was assembled
specifically for this showing
from works owned by the
Stanford Museum, the Bender
Room of the Graduate
Library, and private Bay
Area collections.
The San Francisco area is
fortunate in possessing an
unusual amount of Matisse
works. This is due in part
to writer Gertrude Stein,
who once lived here, and
her secretary Alice B. Toklas
(yes, she's the one). They
both lived in the artist's
cult of Paris during the
early part of the century,
knew Matisse and brought
much of his work to the
United States.
Matisse worked in all media
from architecture to oil painting.
The Stanford exhibit contains
representatives from his graphics
and sculpture: 27 black and white
lithographs, 12 etchings, various
other graphics including drypoint,
aquatint, pen and ink, and water
color, 21 colored stencils from
paper cuts, and 2 bronze
sculptures.
The impact of the exhibit as a
whole is one of colorful harmony
and simplicity expressed through
basic line, form and rolor. "I

think only of rendering my
sensations." Mattisse said.
Art of Distillation
Matisse's art involves
selection. He distills the
forms he uses, and
manipulates them to avoid
tenseness, or the feeling of
being crowded or heavy. He
uses line to its fullest
advantage in his drawings;
often with only five or six
lines defining a shape.
Matisse reacted against the
neo-impressionists by using
solid, pure form and outline,
and contrasted with Van
Gogh in his expression of
serenity as opposed to
tension.
Matisse reacts most to his
own vision of the world.
His work has been very
influencial to modern abstract
art, especially in the 50's.
Sculptures Stand-Out
The works in the Stanford
Gallery exhibit span Matisse's
career chronologically. The
most striking pieces upon
entering the Gallery are the
two sculptures Reclining Nude
I ( 1 9 0 7 ) and Head of
Marguerite (1906). They
represent his early work in
Paris prior to World War I.
The Reclining Nude I reflects
the artist's involvement with
cubism: in the slightly
exaggerated arabesque and
planned surface.
Of the other works, the
colorful stencils and several
of the lithographs are the
most rewarding.
Seated Nude in Wicker
Chair (1914) and Head of a
Girl (c.1906-1914) are among
the black and white
lithograph prints that use
simple line for expression.
They are beautiful in their
uniqueness and purity. The
single subject of each is the
center of contemplation. The
artist thickens the black line
in his Figure Au 112 urban

(c.1947) an aqua-tint of a
much later period, it further
defines his simplicity.
The series of six black
and grey soft ground
etchings, done by the artist
for an edition of James
Joyce's Ulysses show Matisse
as an illustrator and
storyteller. In these the
theme is confined to the
page, contrasting with his
other media where the forms
suggest a denial of these
limits.
The four etchings, from
lit-ad of Man (c. 19-19) to
Reclining Nude (1929) are a
pleasant surprize because they
are so small and delicate.
Happ> Colors
The most obviously
delightful group of works is
the series of 20 colored
prints. They are from
Matisse's paper-cut illustrations
for his hand written book
Ja/.z (1917). The subjects are
horses, hearts, people, flowers
and other things, and the
theme is jazz. The colors
are pure red, black, yellow,
blue, purple, green, brown,
and pink. The forms are
solid, overlapping shapes and
curves that characterize
Matisse. They generate a
happy felling and one can
almost hear the music they
represent.
"A picture is a unique
event, a birth, which enriches
the universe as it is grasped
by the human mind, by
bringing a new form into
it." Matisse once said.
Soothe your mind and
spend an hour with Matisse.
Elsen to Speak
Dr. Albert Elsen will
speak on the print and
drawing exhibit next
Wednesday, Jan. 21st at 8:15
p.m. in the Gallery. Elsen,
Stanford Art faculty prof., is
the author of a recent book
on the Sculpture of Matisse.

Seated Nude in Wicker
Chair (1914) and Head of a
Girl (c.1906-1914) are among
the black and white
lithograph prints that use
simple line for expression.
They are beautiful in their
uniqueness and purity. The
single subject of each is the
center of contemplation. The
artist thickens the black line
in his Figure Au 112 urban

(c.1947) an aqua-tint of a
much later period, it further
defines his simplicity.
The series of six black
and grey soft ground
etchings, done by the artist
for an edition of James
Joyce's Ulysses show Matisse
as an illustrator and
storyteller. In these the
theme is confined to the
page, contrasting with his
other media where the forms
suggest a denial of these
limits.
The four etchings, from
lit-ad of Man (c. 19-19) to
Reclining Nude (1929) are a
pleasant surprize because they
are so small and delicate.
Happ> Colors
The most obviously
delightful group of works is
the series of 20 colored
prints. They are from
Matisse's paper-cut illustrations
for his hand written book
Ja/.z (1917). The subjects are
horses, hearts, people, flowers
and other things, and the
theme is jazz. The colors
are pure red, black, yellow,
blue, purple, green, brown,
and pink. The forms are
solid, overlapping shapes and
curves that characterize
Matisse. They generate a
happy felling and one can
almost hear the music they
represent.
"A picture is a unique
event, a birth, which enriches
the universe as it is grasped
by the human mind, by
bringing a new form into
it." Matisse once said.
Soothe your mind and
spend an hour with Matisse.
Elsen to Speak
Dr. Albert Elsen will
speak on the print and
drawing exhibit next
Wednesday, Jan. 21st at 8:15
p.m. in the Gallery. Elsen,
Stanford Art faculty prof., is
the author of a recent book
on the Sculpture of Matisse.
The one-hundredth birthday
of the French artist Henri
Matisse is being
commemorated by an
exhibition of his drawings
and prints at the Stanford
Art Gallery through January
25th. Happy Birthday Henri!
The exhibition of 61
pieces was assembled
specifically for this showing
from works owned by the
Stanford Museum, the Bender
Room of the Graduate
Library, and private Bay
Area collections.
The San Francisco area is
fortunate in possessing an
unusual amount of Matisse
works. This is due in part
to writer Gertrude Stein,
who once lived here, and
her secretary Alice B. Toklas
(yes, she's the one). They
both lived in the artist's
cult of Paris during the
early part of the century,
knew Matisse and brought
much of his work to the
United States.
Matisse worked in all media
from architecture to oil painting.
The Stanford exhibit contains
representatives from his graphics
and sculpture: 27 black and white
lithographs, 12 etchings, various
other graphics including drypoint,
aquatint, pen and ink, and water
color, 21 colored stencils from
paper cuts, and 2 bronze
sculptures.
The impact of the exhibit as a
whole is one of colorful harmony
and simplicity expressed through
basic line, form and rolor. "I

think only of rendering my
sensations." Mattisse said.
Art of Distillation
Matisse's art involves
selection. He distills the
forms he uses, and
manipulates them to avoid
tenseness, or the feeling of
being crowded or heavy. He
uses line to its fullest
advantage in his drawings;
often with only five or six
lines defining a shape.
Matisse reacted against the
neo-impressionists by using
solid, pure form and outline,
and contrasted with Van
Gogh in his expression of
serenity as opposed to
tension.
Matisse reacts most to his
own vision of the world.
His work has been very
influencial to modern abstract
art, especially in the 50's.
Sculptures Stand-Out
The works in the Stanford
Gallery exhibit span Matisse's
career chronologically. The
most striking pieces upon
entering the Gallery are the
two sculptures Reclining Nude
I ( 1 9 0 7 ) and Head of
Marguerite (1906). They
represent his early work in
Paris prior to World War I.
The Reclining Nude I reflects
the artist's involvement with
cubism: in the slightly
exaggerated arabesque and
planned surface.
Of the other works, the
colorful stencils and several
of the lithographs are the
most rewarding.

works. This is due in part
to writer Gertrude Stein,
who once lived here, and
her secretary Alice B. Toklas
(yes, she's the one). They
both lived in the artist's
cult of Paris during the
early part of the century,
knew Matisse and brought
much of his work to the
United States.
Matisse worked in all media
from architecture to oil painting.
The Stanford exhibit contains
representatives from his graphics
and sculpture: 27 black and white
lithographs, 12 etchings, various
other graphics including drypoint,
aquatint, pen and ink, and water
color, 21 colored stencils from
paper cuts, and 2 bronze
sculptures.
The impact of the exhibit as a
whole is one of colorful harmony
and simplicity expressed through
basic line, form and rolor. "I

think only of rendering my
sensations." Mattisse said.
Art of Distillation
Matisse's art involves
selection. He distills the
forms he uses, and
manipulates them to avoid
tenseness, or the feeling of
being crowded or heavy. He
uses line to its fullest
advantage in his drawings;
often with only five or six
lines defining a shape.
Matisse reacted against the
neo-impressionists by using
solid, pure form and outline,
and contrasted with Van
Gogh in his expression of
serenity as opposed to
tension.
Matisse reacts most to his
own vision of the world.
His work has been very
influencial to modern abstract
art, especially in the 50's.
Sculptures Stand-Out
The works in the Stanford
Gallery exhibit span Matisse's
career chronologically. The
most striking pieces upon
entering the Gallery are the
two sculptures Reclining Nude
I ( 1 9 0 7 ) and Head of
Marguerite (1906). They
represent his early work in
Paris prior to World War I.
The Reclining Nude I reflects
the artist's involvement with
cubism: in the slightly
exaggerated arabesque and
planned surface.
Of the other works, the
colorful stencils and several
of the lithographs are the
most rewarding.
Seated Nude in Wicker
Chair (1914) and Head of a
Girl (c.1906-1914) are among
the black and white
lithograph prints that use
simple line for expression.
They are beautiful in their
uniqueness and purity. The
single subject of each is the
center of contemplation. The
artist thickens the black line
in his Figure Au 112 urban

(c.1947) an aqua-tint of a
much later period, it further
defines his simplicity.
The series of six black
and grey soft ground
etchings, done by the artist
for an edition of James
Joyce's Ulysses show Matisse
as an illustrator and
storyteller. In these the
theme is confined to the
page, contrasting with his
other media where the forms
suggest a denial of these
limits.
The four etchings, from
lit-ad of Man (c. 19-19) to
Reclining Nude (1929) are a
pleasant surprize because they
are so small and delicate.
Happ> Colors
The most obviously
delightful group of works is
the series of 20 colored
prints. They are from
Matisse's paper-cut illustrations
for his hand written book
Ja/.z (1917). The subjects are
horses, hearts, people, flowers
and other things, and the
theme is jazz. The colors
are pure red, black, yellow,
blue, purple, green, brown,
and pink. The forms are
solid, overlapping shapes and
curves that characterize
Matisse. They generate a
happy felling and one can
almost hear the music they
represent.
"A picture is a unique
event, a birth, which enriches
the universe as it is grasped
by the human mind, by
bringing a new form into
it." Matisse once said.
Soothe your mind and
spend an hour with Matisse.
