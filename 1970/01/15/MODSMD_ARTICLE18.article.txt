## Bidders' Choices 
### Marshall Schwartz 
If you're wondering why the
bidding isn't complete, it's
because that's the basis for this
whole thing. What bid would you
make holding the South hand? At
a recent duplicate tournament,
three separate answers were
found, but only two of them will
work.
Obviously, South can bid
either 4 Hearts, 4 Spades—both of
which North will pass—or pass.
Usually, 7-4-1-1 hands, even this
powerful, aren't suited for no
trump. So some people bid four
spades—a bad bid, because it only
repeats what he has already
shown—or four hearts.
Four spades, which seems quite
reasonable, runs into a stone wall
otherwise known as a 4-1 heart
split. Against 4 spades, West
always led his singleton heart. So
South, having absolutely no entry
to his lovely dummy, always lost
the ace-king of trumps, a heart
ruff (East returns a heart when he
takes the trump ace) and the
fourth heart, for down one.

Unfortunately, this was the
response my partner chose.
Four hearts is tricky—the bad
split again causes problems, but it
always makes. West will lead a
minor suit—probably the club
Jack—and declarer will then test
trumps. After hearing the bad
news, the obvious play is to attack
spades. Now, although East gets in
twice with the two top spades, he
cannot knock out both of South's
remaining entries to his hand —the
diamond ace and the trump
queen. All he will get are the ace
and king of spades and a trump
trick.
South will go down, however,
if he is stupid enough to cash his
other minor suit ace before
attacking spades. Now he can be
locked on dummy, and will also
have to lose a trick to the
diamond 10 because of the 5-1
split in that suit.
Three-No Possible
Three no trump is
untouchable. After the lead of
either a heart or club from East,
declarer (North is now declarer)
cashes his minor suit aces and
attacks spades. If clubs were led,
the defense can hold North to
three by again attacking clubs,
forcing him to cash his nine top
tricks—three hearts, four
diamonds, and two clubs.
If clubs aren't led —say the jack
of hearts comes out, declarer
simply attacks spades, and
proceeds to make four (if the
defense never lets North get into
his own hand), losing the same
tricks lost at four hearts, or even
five, if they let him pitch his
losing heart on the club king.
This is probably the best spot,
since, if hearts aren't bid, the
most likely lead is a heart. Despite
this, I do not recommend playing
all misfits in three no trump.
