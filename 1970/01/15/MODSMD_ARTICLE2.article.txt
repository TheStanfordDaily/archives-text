# Moratorium: New Direction
## COMMENTARY 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
Forsaking the obvious trappings of a mass
movement—the sprawling marches, the cheering
throngs, and overflowing rallies, the canvassers
fanning out over an area of a million people —the
Stanford Moratorium has chosen to take on a
different complexion in the coming months.
Moratorium leaders in the mid-peninsula are
placing top priority on mobilizing the local
communities. To work toward this goal, 94
community peace centers have been established
from Atherton to Mountain View, with
membership between ten and 20 in each.
The neighborhood groups have already
produced several results: First they have served as
forums for discussion providing new ideas for the
future direction of the Moratorium.
One idea is to put effective pressure on present
city council members and to work in the coming
elections toward gaining control of local city
councils. Some citizens hope that their cities might
be declared "war free zones," declaring peace with
Vietnam, and passing stiff ordinances regarding
war-related industries in the community.
Hopefully, the complexion of the local draft
boards will be changed. But Bob Clark, student
coordinator for the Stanford Moratorium, is
optimistic: "If a community becomes a war free
zone, and achieves a real commitment against war
the draft board won't be able to operate in a
vacuum. They'll have to take note of the public
feeling."
Another idea from the community groups is to
expand the breadth of the Moratorium to a
consideration of ecology. Many of those active in
the Moratorium feel that the same institutions that
are responsible for the war are responsible as well
for the destruction of our environment.
"Institutions must be changed," Clark argues,
"if policies are to be changed effectively. By
institutions I mean not only the corporate system,
the governmental system, the educational system,
but also sets of values.
Moratorium leaders are now emphasizing local
politics over state and national because they
believe that electoral politics can only be effective
in changing institutions if it is attempted from the
bottom up. Bob Clark, who has been instrumental
in organizing the community groups, believes the
groups have already accomplished much: namely,
that they have broken down the isolation that so
often exists between neighbors, especially in the

suburbs, and revitalized "popular participation''in
the political system.
Because the action-discussion type of group
that has been established in the communities does
breed more involvement, he would like to see
these established at Stanford, in dorms,
fraternities, and among members of various
campus organizations. Clark also hopes to tie the
campus groups in with the groups in the
community, perhaps on a one-to-one basis. The
campus groups might eventually work with those
in the community to change the nature of local
governments, making Stanford a vital, working
partner with the rest of the mid-peninsula
communities.
Though they are placing a great deal of
importance on local politics and issues,
Moratorium leaders feel that Vietnam is still very
much the issue. "Nixon has won the first round of
the battle for public opinion," Clark admits, "but
to win the whole battle he will have to either win
the war (which is inconceivable) or withdraw our
troops rapidly without a military catastrophe."
Moratorium leaders cite numerous other related
issues which might be dealt with, the most
important of which is the draft. A campaign
against the draft could assume a three track plan.
First, the Moratorium is considering increasing
efforts to organize and encourage mass resistance
with classic methods of non-violence. The sit-in at
the Oakland Induction Center yesterday is an
example of this kind of action.
A second possible track might be the
encouragement of legislative proposals liberalizing
the granting of conscientious objector status. And
a third proposal, in Clark's view, is putting
pressure on local school boards to provide free
draft counseling to high school students.
Another area of possible activity would be
raising money for peasant refugees in South
Vietnam. Last month the Moratorium raised
money for the Committee of Responsibility
(which works with refugee children in Vietnam),
and tomorrow and Saturday a food fast in the
University residences will raise money for the
American Friends Service Committee for the same
purpose.
Clark also sees other possibilities for helping
Vietnam "When and if the war ends, perhaps we
can raise money to restore the ecology of South
Vietnam, and rebuild the villages that we have
burned to the ground."
