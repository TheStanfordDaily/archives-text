## The 						Company Presents Brecht 
### 
The Company, Stanford's
undergraduate drama group, is
finally presenting its production
of "The Caucasian Chalk Circle"
by Bertolt Brecht. The play has
been in rehearsal since the

direction of John Davis, a senior
in Speech and Drama.
Performances are Monday through
Friday, January 19 to 23, at 8
p.m., in the Old Pavilion. As
always, admission is free.
Because of an unusual scene
design which encloses the
audience, seating is limited. Free
tickets will be given out this
Thursday and Friday afternoons
in White Plaza, and also at the
door, if any remain.
Because seating is on the floor,
bringing a pillow is recommended,

as is leaning against one's
neighbor.
