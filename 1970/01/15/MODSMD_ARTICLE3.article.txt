# Anti-War Talks Set For Church Meeting
## 
### JOHN ECKHOUSE 
David Hawk, one of the four
founders and coordinators of the
National Vietnam Moratorium,
will be a feature speaker at a
community meeting planned by
the Stanford-Peninsula
Moratorium Committee at 8:15
tonight in Stanford Memorial
Church.
Hoping to learn from the
recent success of the local
Stanford organization, Hawk is
currently in the Bay Area to plan
future strategy.
Twenty-six year old Hawk feels
"it is appropriate to come to
Stanford" because this has been
the most successful area for the
Moratorium. "The Peninsula is
really the model of what we hope
to encourage people to do all
around the country."
Hawk emphasized that the old
Moratorium formula: one day of
protest in October, 2 days in
November, etc. has been
abandoned in favor of community
organization and political
education. One day a month is
still reserved "as a facilitating tool
for local groups" to gain public
recognition.
Taxpayer Rallies
In the near future the
Moratorium hopes to attract
public attention with taxpayers'
rallies in large cities, a nationwide
fast, participation in selected
Congressional campaigns, and an

Easter vacation tour of Vietnam
by a troupe of entertainers.
As part of their community
education plans, Moratorium
leaders in several large cities will
organize taxpayers' rallies at
Internal Revenue Service Centers
on April 15, the deadline for
paying taxes.
Hawk hopes to convince
taxpayers of the direct
relationship of inflation and
higher taxes to defense spending.
He will point out that "the
Federal government spends
money not on welfare, as is
generally believed, but on war and
the weapons of war."
A nation-wide fast is planned
for the same time, with proceeds
earmarked for Vietnamese relief
agencies.
The National Moratorium is
presently doing research to see
which 1970 electoral campaigns it
might attempt to enter. Hawk
mentioned that money,
volunteers, and other resources
exist "for a limited number of
Congressional campaigns,"
numbering between 15 and 40.
He indicated that the
Moratorium is willing to throw

support to third or fourth party
candidates if it does not find
Democratic or GOP nominees
acceptable.
Easter Entertainment
The hoped-for Easter
entertainment tour is seen as a
rebuttal to similar undertakings
by Martha Raye and Bob Hope.
Hawk said he is currently
negotiating with a number of
nationally known rock and soul
bands to perform in Vietnam, R &
R centers, and several West Coast
military bases.
Admitting that "we do
anticipate some difficulty," Hawk
is seeking the cooperation of
USO, the State Department, and
the Pentagon. Although there is to
be no overt political content, the
former Union Theological
Seminary student noted that most
rock and folk groups do sing
messages of peace.
Moratorium leaders also plan
to revive the circulation of "We
Won't Go" statements on college
campuses. Draft age men who sign
these statements indicate that
they will not serve in the armed
forces as long as the Vietnam War
continues.

education plans, Moratorium
leaders in several large cities will
organize taxpayers' rallies at
Internal Revenue Service Centers
on April 15, the deadline for
paying taxes.
Hawk hopes to convince
taxpayers of the direct
relationship of inflation and
higher taxes to defense spending.
He will point out that "the
Federal government spends
money not on welfare, as is
generally believed, but on war and
the weapons of war."
A nation-wide fast is planned
for the same time, with proceeds
earmarked for Vietnamese relief
agencies.
The National Moratorium is
presently doing research to see
which 1970 electoral campaigns it
might attempt to enter. Hawk
mentioned that money,
volunteers, and other resources
exist "for a limited number of
Congressional campaigns,"
numbering between 15 and 40.
He indicated that the
Moratorium is willing to throw

support to third or fourth party
candidates if it does not find
Democratic or GOP nominees
acceptable.
Easter Entertainment
The hoped-for Easter
entertainment tour is seen as a
rebuttal to similar undertakings
by Martha Raye and Bob Hope.
Hawk said he is currently
negotiating with a number of
nationally known rock and soul
bands to perform in Vietnam, R &
R centers, and several West Coast
military bases.
Admitting that "we do
anticipate some difficulty," Hawk
is seeking the cooperation of
USO, the State Department, and
the Pentagon. Although there is to
be no overt political content, the
former Union Theological
Seminary student noted that most
rock and folk groups do sing
messages of peace.
Moratorium leaders also plan
to revive the circulation of "We
Won't Go" statements on college
campuses. Draft age men who sign
these statements indicate that
they will not serve in the armed
forces as long as the Vietnam War
continues.
David Hawk, one of the four
founders and coordinators of the
National Vietnam Moratorium,
will be a feature speaker at a
community meeting planned by
the Stanford-Peninsula
Moratorium Committee at 8:15
tonight in Stanford Memorial
Church.
Hoping to learn from the
recent success of the local
Stanford organization, Hawk is
currently in the Bay Area to plan
future strategy.
Twenty-six year old Hawk feels
"it is appropriate to come to
Stanford" because this has been
the most successful area for the
Moratorium. "The Peninsula is
really the model of what we hope
to encourage people to do all
around the country."
Hawk emphasized that the old
Moratorium formula: one day of
protest in October, 2 days in
November, etc. has been
abandoned in favor of community
organization and political
education. One day a month is
still reserved "as a facilitating tool
for local groups" to gain public
recognition.
Taxpayer Rallies
In the near future the
Moratorium hopes to attract
public attention with taxpayers'
rallies in large cities, a nationwide
fast, participation in selected
Congressional campaigns, and an

Easter vacation tour of Vietnam
by a troupe of entertainers.
