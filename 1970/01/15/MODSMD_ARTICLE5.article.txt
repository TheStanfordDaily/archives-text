## Warning Of Pill Dangers 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP>-Millions of
women taking birth control pills
are exposing themselves to a
broad range of suspected diseases
including cancer and may be
endangering future generations,
investigating senators were told
Wednesday.
"Never in history have so many
individuals taken such potent
drugs with so little information
available as to actual and potential
hazards," said Dr. High J. Davis of
John Hopkins University.
"Shall we have millions of
women on the pill for 20 years
and then discover it was all a great
mistake?" he asked.
Davis testified as the Senate
monopoly subcommittee opened
hearings into the safety of oral
contraceptives and particularly
whether women are being
adequately warned of the dangers.
The hearings by the
subcommittee headed by Sen.
Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., mark the
first look Congress has taken at
the pill in the 10 years it has been
on the market.
Although all of the day's
witnesses called for caution in use
of the pill, none was as critical as
Davis, who helped found John
Hopkins' contraception research
center in 1963.
Citing reports that listed more
than 50 separate possible side
effects from the pill, including
fatal blood clotting, Davis said
that even if these were ignored
"the nagging specter of cancer
remains."
"Breast cancers," he said,
"have been induced in at least five
different species of animals by
treatment with the same synthetic
hormones being marketed in oral
contraceptives."
Every important agent that has
been shown to cause cancer in
humans, he added, also has been
shown to cause it in animals and
there is no reason to believe oral
contraceptives will be the single
exception.

Davis also recommended that
no woman be allowed to use any
oral contraceptive more than two
years.
Oakland Sit-hi
OAKLAND AP — January
anti-war Moratorium activities
opened here early Wednesday
morning in a driving rain as 19
persons were arrested for blocking
entry to the Oakland Induction
Center.

In Los Angeles, 19 others were
arrested under similar
circumstances.
Those arrested here said other
demonstrations were planned in
Philadelphia, Boston, Washington
and Milwaukee.
"Peace rallies are no longer
enough," said hand bills passed
out by the demonstrators as they
sat down in entrances to the draft
center. "We must stop supporting
the war with our bodies and our
money."

The leaflet also called for
resisting the draft lottery "no
better than a selective method of
slavery."
Saying they were a coalition of
individuals representing no
particular organizations, the 19
said they offered no violence
when arrested by police.

Like everything else in
contemporary America, draft
protests are becoming
standardized, canned affairs. But
the cast of yesterday's induction
center sit-in apparently enjoyed
just going through the routine.
'Cause everybody went away
happy.
Eighteen protestors did just
that, winning appropriate legal
recognition of their civil
disobedience.
Two squads of Oakland's finest
made some easy arrests that didn't
shoot back, got their backs on the
TV news and something to tell
their neighbors about.
Reporters got a quick,
six-paragraph story in under 45
minutes.
Sympathizers got to clap, sing,
shout, hold umbrellas over
policemen/themselves, play
guitars, and go home.
Ambitious militants registered
their protest passively, sprawled
across two entranceways to the
drab building. Smiling faces
glistened in the rain as a
heavy-jowled officer (of course)
recited constitutional rights that
didn't alter the situation.
Efficient, black-jacketed men
dragged the obstenate into
paddywagons. The crowd cheered,
waved good-bye, sang some more,
and drifted away like a class
dismissed.

hazards," said Dr. High J. Davis of
John Hopkins University.
"Shall we have millions of
women on the pill for 20 years
and then discover it was all a great
mistake?" he asked.
Davis testified as the Senate
monopoly subcommittee opened
hearings into the safety of oral
contraceptives and particularly
whether women are being
adequately warned of the dangers.
The hearings by the
subcommittee headed by Sen.
Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., mark the
first look Congress has taken at
the pill in the 10 years it has been
on the market.
Although all of the day's
witnesses called for caution in use
of the pill, none was as critical as
Davis, who helped found John
Hopkins' contraception research
center in 1963.
Citing reports that listed more
than 50 separate possible side
effects from the pill, including
fatal blood clotting, Davis said
that even if these were ignored
"the nagging specter of cancer
remains."
"Breast cancers," he said,
"have been induced in at least five
different species of animals by
treatment with the same synthetic
hormones being marketed in oral
contraceptives."
Every important agent that has
been shown to cause cancer in
humans, he added, also has been
shown to cause it in animals and
there is no reason to believe oral
contraceptives will be the single
exception.

Davis also recommended that
no woman be allowed to use any
oral contraceptive more than two
years.
Oakland Sit-hi
OAKLAND AP — January
anti-war Moratorium activities
opened here early Wednesday
morning in a driving rain as 19
persons were arrested for blocking
entry to the Oakland Induction
Center.

In Los Angeles, 19 others were
arrested under similar
circumstances.
Those arrested here said other
demonstrations were planned in
Philadelphia, Boston, Washington
and Milwaukee.
"Peace rallies are no longer
enough," said hand bills passed
out by the demonstrators as they
sat down in entrances to the draft
center. "We must stop supporting
the war with our bodies and our
money."

The leaflet also called for
resisting the draft lottery "no
better than a selective method of
slavery."
Saying they were a coalition of
individuals representing no
particular organizations, the 19
said they offered no violence
when arrested by police.

(DAILY reporter Nick Nicholas

anti-war demonstration in
Oakland, his commentary

Like everything else in
contemporary America, draft
protests are becoming
standardized, canned affairs. But
the cast of yesterday's induction
center sit-in apparently enjoyed
just going through the routine.
'Cause everybody went away
happy.
Eighteen protestors did just
that, winning appropriate legal
recognition of their civil
disobedience.
Two squads of Oakland's finest
made some easy arrests that didn't
shoot back, got their backs on the
TV news and something to tell
their neighbors about.
Reporters got a quick,
six-paragraph story in under 45
minutes.
Sympathizers got to clap, sing,
shout, hold umbrellas over
policemen/themselves, play
guitars, and go home.
Ambitious militants registered
their protest passively, sprawled
across two entranceways to the
drab building. Smiling faces
glistened in the rain as a
heavy-jowled officer (of course)
recited constitutional rights that
didn't alter the situation.
Efficient, black-jacketed men
dragged the obstenate into
paddywagons. The crowd cheered,
waved good-bye, sang some more,
and drifted away like a class
dismissed.
