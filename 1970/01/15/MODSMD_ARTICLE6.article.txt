# Focus On Priorities
## Conference Slated 
### JULIE FLEECE 
The Conference on National
Priorities co-sponsored by
Stanford University and the
Stanford Research Institute will
open tonight with a panel
discussion entitled "Overviews."
All of the sessions today,
tomorrow, and Saturday will be
held in Cummings Art
Auditorium.
The 7:30 program will present
three speakers: Robert C. North,
Stanford Political Science
Professor, on "Macro Problems
Facing the Nation and the
World"; Leonard A. Lecht, of the
National Planning Association, on
"Goals, Priorities, and
Dollars —The Next Decade"; and
Arjay Miller, Dean of the
Graduate Business School, on "A
Proposal for the National Goals
Institute".
The speakers will be followed
by a general discussion, with John
Grube of the ASSU Council of
Presidents as moderator.
Origin of Idea
The idea for a conference on
national priorities originated
during last spring's
demonstrations at Stanford.
According to Pat Shea of the
Council of Presidents, "This

conference grew out of last spring
because some of the people at SRI
felt like they wanted to do
something."
"It (the conference) really is an
opportunity for people to hear
people who are involved both
from a cultural and a
counter-cultural point of view" he
added.
Shea cited Congressman Paul
N. McCloskey as an example of
cultural involvement, since he is in
an influential policy-making
position. McCloskey will be
moderator for tomorrow night's
session on federal priorities.
Counler-Culture
An as-yet-undetermined
representative of a counter-culture
will also be featured on the
program. It is possible that this
representative will question the
validity and effectiveness of
discussing national priorities.
Understanding the national
priorities, however, is the stated
goal of the conference. Joyce
Kobayashi of the Council of
Presidents thinks the main interest
of the conference is its coherence
in an overall examination of the
basic mechanisms for doing things
in this country—for example, the
intricacies of budget handling.
