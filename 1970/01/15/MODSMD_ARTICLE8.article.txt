# Vietnamese Student Editor
## Courageous Plea For Peace 
### Le VanNghia 
(Editor's Note: Following is a
brief commentary on this letter
by David Marr, an Assistant
Professor of Vietnamese Studies
at Berkeley.)
Le Van Nghia, the author of
the following letter, is a 24 year
old student at the University of
Saigon and editor of the school
newspaper, Sinh Vien. The
previous editor, Nguyen Truong
Con, is now serving five years hard
labor on the notorious prison
island of Con Son.)
One senses that to Nghia, who
is a cripple, courage comes
naturally. He is a native of Ben
Tre—the city for which, during
the Tet, 1968 struggles, an
American commander delivered
the infamous epitaph: "We had to
destroy this town in order to save
it.
Le Van Nghia's references to
Saigon student efforts to end the
War are modest, almost
self-de meaning. It should be
realized, however, that hundreds
of Nghia's student associates have
been seized in their homes, or off
the streets by the Saigon police
and subjected to indefinite
detention without trial. The game
they are playing is as real as the
violence of the war that is going

on around them, and the stakes
they are putting up against the
prize of peace can include their
own lives. Le Van Nghia's letter to
American students is a sincere and
truthful representation of the
feelings and hopes of most of the
Vietnamese student community.
To Our American Student
Friends:
I am writing these lines from
southern Viet Nam, from a land
which is like a furnace resounding
with bullets and bombs, blood,
fire, and sudden death.
The frightening circumstances
of war are with us daily, but we
know we still have some American
friends, the brothers of those who
are forced to come here and shed
their blood and meet a tragic
death. If the warfare does not
end, I worry about the fate of my
people, and I also endlessly have
painful thoughts about you;
maybe you too will be forced to
come over here, following the
steps of your older friends.
Affection and Hopefulness
Vietnamese students look upon
you with affection and
hopefulness. The students of
southern Viet Nam admire your
work. You have dared to struggle,
to demonstrate, and call upon the

American Government to end the
war in Viet Nam. You have
requested the government to bring
home your beloved American
youth, to end the useless sacrifice
of blood, and to avoid the
destruction of a friendly country
by sowing the seeds of racial
extermination on your friends,
who were born in this century and
are of the same generation as you.
The whole world looks in your
direction with faith and
appreciation. You have
intelligence and compassion for
humanity, in this the
dehumanized 20th century—the
age of machines.
"Painful for Us"
It pains me to talk of these
things with you. Surely, you have
asked yourself many times why
you and the young people of the
world are demonstrating,
appealing for an end to the war,
calling for peace, while we, the
Vietnamese students, are quiet
and passive. If you understand us
you will know how painful it is
for us —we have spent many long
tearful nights. Here, we have
suffered under the law, from
armed terror, and experienced
harsh oppression, and we have not
been able to do anything.

Meetings and demonstrations end
in arrests, detentions and ruthless
beatings. How many of our young
Vietnamese student friends are
now lying buried in the
prisons . . .?
As the school year begins, and
I send my Vietnamese student
friends to you, the American
students, our faith and hope. We
are confident that your
compassion for humanity will
urge you to continue the struggle
to force the American
Government to truly want to end
this war. We hope that you will
play a big part in bringing peace
back to Viet Nam so that we,
your friends, can avoid the unjust
destruction of our young people,
and we hope that in the future
you will not have to come here
with guns in hatred. But certainly
you will never do so willingly. We
are ready to welcome you in the
days of peace in our homeland
with all our affection.
We send to you many good
wishes, hopes, and our complete
heartfelt admiration.

feelings and hopes of most of the
Vietnamese student community.
To Our American Student
Friends:
I am writing these lines from
southern Viet Nam, from a land
which is like a furnace resounding
with bullets and bombs, blood,
fire, and sudden death.
The frightening circumstances
of war are with us daily, but we
know we still have some American
friends, the brothers of those who
are forced to come here and shed
their blood and meet a tragic
death. If the warfare does not
end, I worry about the fate of my
people, and I also endlessly have
painful thoughts about you;
maybe you too will be forced to
come over here, following the
steps of your older friends.
Affection and Hopefulness
Vietnamese students look upon
you with affection and
hopefulness. The students of
southern Viet Nam admire your
work. You have dared to struggle,
to demonstrate, and call upon the

American Government to end the
war in Viet Nam. You have
requested the government to bring
home your beloved American
youth, to end the useless sacrifice
of blood, and to avoid the
destruction of a friendly country
by sowing the seeds of racial
extermination on your friends,
who were born in this century and
are of the same generation as you.
The whole world looks in your
direction with faith and
appreciation. You have
intelligence and compassion for
humanity, in this the
dehumanized 20th century—the
age of machines.
"Painful for Us"
It pains me to talk of these
things with you. Surely, you have
asked yourself many times why
you and the young people of the
world are demonstrating,
appealing for an end to the war,
calling for peace, while we, the
Vietnamese students, are quiet
and passive. If you understand us
you will know how painful it is
for us —we have spent many long
tearful nights. Here, we have
suffered under the law, from
armed terror, and experienced
harsh oppression, and we have not
been able to do anything.

Meetings and demonstrations end
in arrests, detentions and ruthless
beatings. How many of our young
Vietnamese student friends are
now lying buried in the
prisons . . .?
As the school year begins, and
I send my Vietnamese student
friends to you, the American
students, our faith and hope. We
are confident that your
compassion for humanity will
urge you to continue the struggle
to force the American
Government to truly want to end
this war. We hope that you will
play a big part in bringing peace
back to Viet Nam so that we,
your friends, can avoid the unjust
destruction of our young people,
and we hope that in the future
you will not have to come here
with guns in hatred. But certainly
you will never do so willingly. We
are ready to welcome you in the
days of peace in our homeland
with all our affection.
We send to you many good
wishes, hopes, and our complete
heartfelt admiration.

Le Van Nghia, the author of
the following letter, is a 24 year
old student at the University of
Saigon and editor of the school

the infamous epitaph: "We had to

Le Van Nghia's references to

self-de meaning. It should be
realized, however, that hundreds
of Nghia's student associates have
been seized in their homes, or off
