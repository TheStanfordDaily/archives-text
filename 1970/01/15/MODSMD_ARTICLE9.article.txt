# Fishy Fishbowl
## Lottery Proposal 
### Hazel Edwards 
The lottery was intended to
expose all draft age men to the
luck of the draw, for an impartial
determination of who should
serve.
The results are so heavily
weighted towards selection of
those with birth dates in the later
months of the year, as to question
their impartiality. A professor of
mathematics at N.Y. University
has examined the figures below,
and stated they are not random!
With 12 months to draw from,
it would be imagined that after 4
dozen dates were drawn, they
would fall approximately 4 from
each month. The actual figures
were 8 dates from December, only
1 date from January. November
and December drew 13 dates,
January and February only 3
dates.
Outcome Examined
If we examine how many were
drawn from each month, January
all the way to December, dates
drawn bv month were 1, 2, 3, 3,

4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4, 5, 8. In other
words there is a steady increase as I
we go later in the year. For
numbers drawn in the Ist, 2nd,
3rd and 4th quarters of the year,
the figures are 6, 10, 15, and 17.
It is the consistency of these
progressive results which opens up
some thoughts as to how well the
capsules were mixed in the fish
bowl.
Obvious Conclusions
Of the first 100 dates selected,
15 were from the month of
December, only 6 from January.
Since January capsules went into
the fishbowl first, and December
capsules went in last, the
conclusions are obvious.
Would it not be fairer in future
lotteries to use 12 fish bowls, one
for each month, and draw by a
lottery sequence one from each
bowl, so that after 48 capsules are
drawn the results would be 4 from
each month, and not an 8 to ratio
as in the lottery just held? Minor
adjustments could compensate for
uneven months and monthly birth
rates.
True Random Sequence
The same result may be
accomplished by one fish bowl if
the lottery is listed in dozens. If
the first 3 dates drawn were all
September, instead of being
assigned 1, 2, 3, they would be
assigned a dozen apart, that is 1,
13, 25. If the next 3 selections
were December, June, December,
they would be assigned, 2, 3, 14.
This would provide a true random
sequence even if the fish bowl
were not thoroughly mixed.

the first 3 dates drawn were all
September, instead of being
assigned 1, 2, 3, they would be
assigned a dozen apart, that is 1,
13, 25. If the next 3 selections
were December, June, December,
they would be assigned, 2, 3, 14.
This would provide a true random
sequence even if the fish bowl
were not thoroughly mixed.

The lottery was intended to
expose all draft age men to the
luck of the draw, for an impartial
determination of who should
serve.
The results are so heavily
weighted towards selection of
those with birth dates in the later
months of the year, as to question
their impartiality. A professor of
mathematics at N.Y. University
has examined the figures below,
and stated they are not random!
With 12 months to draw from,
it would be imagined that after 4
dozen dates were drawn, they
would fall approximately 4 from
each month. The actual figures
were 8 dates from December, only
1 date from January. November
and December drew 13 dates,
January and February only 3
dates.
Outcome Examined
If we examine how many were
drawn from each month, January
all the way to December, dates
drawn bv month were 1, 2, 3, 3,

4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4, 5, 8. In other
words there is a steady increase as I
we go later in the year. For
numbers drawn in the Ist, 2nd,
3rd and 4th quarters of the year,
the figures are 6, 10, 15, and 17.
It is the consistency of these
progressive results which opens up
some thoughts as to how well the
capsules were mixed in the fish
bowl.
Obvious Conclusions
Of the first 100 dates selected,
15 were from the month of
December, only 6 from January.
Since January capsules went into
the fishbowl first, and December
capsules went in last, the
conclusions are obvious.
Would it not be fairer in future
lotteries to use 12 fish bowls, one
for each month, and draw by a
lottery sequence one from each
bowl, so that after 48 capsules are
drawn the results would be 4 from
each month, and not an 8 to ratio
as in the lottery just held? Minor
adjustments could compensate for
uneven months and monthly birth
rates.
True Random Sequence
The same result may be
accomplished by one fish bowl if
the lottery is listed in dozens. If
the first 3 dates drawn were all
September, instead of being
assigned 1, 2, 3, they would be
assigned a dozen apart, that is 1,
13, 25. If the next 3 selections
were December, June, December,
they would be assigned, 2, 3, 14.
