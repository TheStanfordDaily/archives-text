# M-Day Speakers Praise Kings Efforts
## 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
In a program heavily
dominated by references to the
memory of the late Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King, a variety of
speakers assessed the past and
future of the Vietnam War and
the Moratorium.
The audience of 500 students
and community members was
solemn and reserved as it listened
to the words of the late Dr. King,
urging anti-war demonstrators to
"continue to follow the dictates
of conscience —even if that means
breaking unjust laws."
The memorial speech, delivered
by Assistant to the President,
James Simmons, praised Dr. King
as a leader in the quest for peace,
as well as in the quest for equal
human rights for all.
"As much as he lived and died
for equality of men on these
shores," Simmons said, "he lived
and worked and died for
peace . . .So if you are ready to
dedicate yourselves to peace,
remember his words: 'Love ye,
one another."
Commitment to Dream
Simmons called for a
commitment to fulfill the dream
of Dr. King, to re-invest America's
resources in the building of peace
at home. He quoted King:
"Together, black and white, rich
and poor, all of us together, we
must put our souls, hearts, minds
and resources into making this
nation a nation of equality for all
men."
Of most importance for the
Moratorium itself was the address
by national coordinator David
Hawk, who praised the
Mid-Peninsula Moratorium for its
emphasis on community
organization.
In the future he said, the
Moratorium must convince the
American people that
Vietnamization is futile, and will
prolong our involvement in the
war rather than end it; that the
tax dollars being spent on the war
(19c of every tax dollar) are
largely responsible for the serious
state of the economy.
People who realize that the war
is immoral as Hawk said, "are not
about to be co-opted or bought
off by token troop withdrawals."

Americans must realize, he
argued, that "Vietnam is not an
aberration of American foreign
policy, but is in fact its very
fruition and fulfillment. It is the
logic of American foreign policy
that Vietnamese peasants are
'better dead than Red' and that
we have the right to destroy
Vietnamese villages in order to
'save' them."
Hawk called for a permanent
and unwavering commitment to
changing the institutions
responsible for Vietnam. He
emphasized such possibilities for
action as draft resistance, sit-ins,
and determined, persistent
canvassing.
Madeline Duckless, of the
Committee of Responsibility,
discussed her recent trip to North
Vietnam, praising the North
Vietnamese people for their
dramatic improvements in health
and education.

by Assistant to the President,
James Simmons, praised Dr. King
as a leader in the quest for peace,
as well as in the quest for equal
human rights for all.
"As much as he lived and died
for equality of men on these
shores," Simmons said, "he lived
and worked and died for
peace . . .So if you are ready to
dedicate yourselves to peace,
remember his words: 'Love ye,
one another."
Commitment to Dream
Simmons called for a
commitment to fulfill the dream
of Dr. King, to re-invest America's
resources in the building of peace
at home. He quoted King:
"Together, black and white, rich
and poor, all of us together, we
must put our souls, hearts, minds
and resources into making this
nation a nation of equality for all
men."
Of most importance for the
Moratorium itself was the address
by national coordinator David
Hawk, who praised the
Mid-Peninsula Moratorium for its
emphasis on community
organization.
In the future he said, the
Moratorium must convince the
American people that
Vietnamization is futile, and will
prolong our involvement in the
war rather than end it; that the
tax dollars being spent on the war
(19c of every tax dollar) are
largely responsible for the serious
state of the economy.
People who realize that the war
is immoral as Hawk said, "are not
about to be co-opted or bought
off by token troop withdrawals."

Americans must realize, he
argued, that "Vietnam is not an
aberration of American foreign
policy, but is in fact its very
fruition and fulfillment. It is the
logic of American foreign policy
that Vietnamese peasants are
'better dead than Red' and that
we have the right to destroy
Vietnamese villages in order to
'save' them."
Hawk called for a permanent
and unwavering commitment to
changing the institutions
responsible for Vietnam. He
emphasized such possibilities for
action as draft resistance, sit-ins,
and determined, persistent
canvassing.
Madeline Duckless, of the
Committee of Responsibility,
discussed her recent trip to North
Vietnam, praising the North
Vietnamese people for their
dramatic improvements in health
and education.


HAWK—David Hawk, national coordinator for (lie Moratorium, was on of the
featured speakers last in the memorial service for Dr. Martin Luther King.
In a program heavily
dominated by references to the
memory of the late Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King, a variety of
speakers assessed the past and
future of the Vietnam War and
the Moratorium.
The audience of 500 students
and community members was
solemn and reserved as it listened
to the words of the late Dr. King,
urging anti-war demonstrators to
"continue to follow the dictates
of conscience —even if that means
breaking unjust laws."
The memorial speech, delivered
by Assistant to the President,
James Simmons, praised Dr. King
as a leader in the quest for peace,
as well as in the quest for equal
human rights for all.
