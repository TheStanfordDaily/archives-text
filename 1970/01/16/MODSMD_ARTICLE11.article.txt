## A 						New American Ideology 
### James Perloff 
David Hawk was one of the
founders of the national
Moratorium, yet in speaking to
him one forgets one's negative
impressions of the liberalism
inherent in the effort.
For instance, he feels that the
Moratorium is not merely an
effort to end the War, but an
effort to build a base for reform
of American ideology.
"We call for immediate
demands," he says, "but it's a
long term struggle. The Cold War
has been going on for 20 years,
and the politics of expansion for
100: it's built into the system.
"You're not going to turn it
down overnight. We've got to
organize for the next 20 years.
Maybe there's not enough time.
"The Movement has got to
grow until you can bring it to bear
politically." To do things about
ROTC, the draft, counterinsur
gency research.
Wearing an expensive looking
suit and cowboy boots, Hawk
made the Moratorium seem a
means to a greater end. "Before
you can get people to look at
policies in general they have to see
it through Vietnam. Until they
admit their country is wrong, you
can't get them to think about
ROTC or Latin America."
His Own Parents
But then, until recently he
couldn't even get his own parents
to see "expansionist policies."
They voted for Nixon.

"Now they wear an anti-war
button," he relates, almost
proudly.
But he really doesn't see the
Moratorium as a matter of single
conversions. "I've been working
for three years on various ways to
end the War. The number of
people who oppose the war has
grown exponentially," he tells the
interviewer.
But he stills sees a generation
gap: "You are going to have a
split between the kids and the
adults, who will work for the
more dovish candidate: the kids
won't have anything to do with
electoral politics.
Two Evils
"The tragedy is that the adults
are still into the lesser of two evils
thing:kidsaren't."He says that the
kids will only work for a
candidate strong on the end of the
war and the draft.
The 26-year-old former
champion diver has reason to be
concerned about the draft: he's
scheduled to go on trial at the end
of the month, for refusing
induction. He turned in his draft
card two years ago.
But he didn't seem concerned.
He may be saved from prison by a
recent court decision ruling illegal
inductions for turning one's draft
card in.
The boy politician sent his card
in because he felt that his student

deferment was class-based: the
rich go to college and get
deferments, the poor become
cannon fodder.
Under-Class
However, his mission now can
be interpreted as saving the
under-class by an immediate
withdrawal. What is immediate
withdrawal?
"It's a principle which speaks
as much to the position that what
we are doing in Vietnam is
fundamentally wrong and
immoral as it does to a period of
time. What you mean by
immediate withdrawal is as soon
as physically possible," he says.
Hawk follows the McCarthy
(Mary) lines: it's the job of the
"statesmen-politicians" to figure a
way to pull the troops out
quickly: they get paid to make
decisions like that. "Nixon and
Kissenger will come up with a
policy when we're strong enough
to force them to."
But then someone put it more
succintly: "When you're being
raped its not a question of
negotiation, but withdrawal."
Telling Dick
How do the People tell the
President that they're fed up?
"We've proved our point in terms
of demonstrations, how many
people oppose the War. It would
seem silly to try and duplicate
that month after month. We hope
that enough people are ready to
do the day to day nitty gritty
work, to bring the people to bring
political pressure."
Yet he opposes making the
Moratorium into a political party.
"We don't envision ourselves
becoming a political party: we're'
an anti-war organization," he says.
However, it will support
Congressional candidates.
According to Hawk, "We're
not supporting liberals or leftists,
we're supporting anti-war
candidates. We're not into running
people who will get three percent
of the vote, but rather people who
can win and have the right stand
on the issue. I suspect we'll be
helping a limited number of
people: 15 to 40 perhaps."
Hawk spent 1968 supporting
one anti-war candidate: but Sen/
McCarthy lost.
