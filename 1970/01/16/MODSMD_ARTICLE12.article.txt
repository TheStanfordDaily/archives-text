## Hope 
### 
F-ditor, THE DAILY:
Having observed Hope's recent
Vietnam trip, with his usual
post-game comments, I can't help
but make comparisons and
observations. The social
significance of Hope—apart from
his name —is striking.
Hope is no more than a very
appropriate symbol of middle
America. Note the recent
photograph in national news
magazines — almost a
scenario—Richard Nixon, Fred
McMurray, Jimmy Stewart and
Bob Hope. Each man, and the
group together, is a real symbol of
what middle Americans want
most—affluence, popularity, a
"sober" sense of humor and
absolute moral righteousness.
They play golf.
Stewart Alsop, in one of his
more incisive Newsweek articles,
ventured to guess that Richard
Nixon and Company fully intends
to keep a solid wall between
themselves and the youth of the
country, appeasing them to keep
the peace during off-years, but
stirring them up with repression
and inflammatory talk during
election years, where backlash
counts. Hope, in particular, plays
a role in this system which
perhaps even Dick himself doesn't
fully understand. He is the older
generation's placebo to the
troops the "good" kids —whose
standard repertoire of funnies
usually is based on indirect jabs at
, people who stand out. Hope helps
to "keep them in their place"
with an annual circus of
comedians, clean-cut young
singers, well-built starlets and (of
course) Miss America. The
conclusion of each show is a
heart-felt chorus of "Silent
Night," (though we all know that
the peace we sing about will never
happen, so fight on!)
But Hope has only fulfilled
half of his role. He now must
convey his impression of "our
courageous fighting men" to
middle America, and help actively
to perpetuate the myth that only
a handful of American youth are
dissatisfied with the state of the
country. The annual journey is
incomplete without the
stockholders report, and that is
indeed the most important part of

the trip, for the TV special picks
up part of the tab and persuades
the middle American that all is
well for another year. And note
that the sentiments expressed by
those who return are universally
the same—"We're sorry to see men
fight and die, but they must."
It's the perpetration of this
gigantic hoax that makes Bob
Hope so valuable to the Nixon
administration. We however, can
ascribe no malice aforethought to
the venerable entertainer, just as
we cannot attribute malice to the
middle American.
