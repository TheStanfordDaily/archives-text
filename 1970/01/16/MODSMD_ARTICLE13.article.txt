# McCarten Critique
## What Torment! 
### Stephen Jones 
It wasn't New Year's Day, but
I was eating a bowl of llama stew
at Aunt Tressie's, wondering why
nobody who passed by looked
like Judy Canova, when a
well-meaning but clumsy Swiss
douane spilled a cup of
un-flavored yogurt at my feet.
Not wanting to embarrass the
chap I showed him my passport
and proceeded to wipe up the
sticky curds with page two of the
Daily. Imagine my shock when I
saw that although the yogurt
came neat and tidy off the floor,
none of it stuck to Mr. McCarten's
column. Picture an L-shaped
patch of perfectly clean newsprint
in the middle of a slimy second
page. Realizing that Mr. McCarten
had gone to extreme lengths to
catch my attention, I decided to
give his work a quick glance.
Finding that it neither feinted,
ducked, nor fought back, I read
on.
Suddenly we have Little Dorrit
with "yet another" cure for
sniffles. Here I am in my 74th day
of chronic sniffles (Cowell Health
Center has informed me I will
actually have to start paying for
their treatment â€”something about
my warranty running out) and all
along they have had an ample
supply of Dorrit's Disposable
Sniffle Swabs. What torment!

But the last bit of truly
unchewable phlegm came up with
Dorrit's last resolution: the
avoidance of "overworked words
and expressions." Some of my
favorite terms are "good,"
"vibes-bad," "and many more,"
"freaky to groove," "as in bad,"
etc. I see no reason to delete these
pearls from my everyday pate of
prose. Perhaps Mr. McCarten
would do better to consider some
of our really overworked words
and expressions. The substitution
of an animal grunt such as
"umph" or "numph" for such
terms would give our language a
much more direct and visceral
flavor. For instance, we could
start out by replacing such tired
words as "and,""the," etc. Or we
could just get rid of articles umph
conjunctions in general. Next on
numph list would be umph old
drearies, verbs. Then umph
numph prepositions umph
pronouns. Eventually numph
course, numph numph umph
adverbs, umph nouns. Umph
umph numph umph numph
numph umph umph umph numph
umph numph overworked umph,
eh Mr. McCarten?
