Cal Band
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am the manager of the
University of California Straw Hat
Band and as you know we will be
coming to Stanford on January 16
for the basketball game in Maple's
Pavilion. On previous visits to
your campus we have been the
victums of several pranks
perpetrated by your band,
fraternities, and other immature
groups.
We realize that your band's
music is more appealing to
Stanford fans and that your band
is more "spirited", however we
implore the Stanford band and
friends to refrain from such
pranking on our coming visit, for
these juvenile acts cost us much
valuable rehersal time and severely
detract from our preformance.
Please, just leave us alone.
Sincerely,
Jerry E. Taylor
Senior Manager

Filth vs. Facts
Editor, THE DAILY:
The January 9 issue of The
Daily carried an article by Mr.
Roth regarding student
employment in which he indicates
that "... it is difficult to locate
any employment." Mr. Roth went
on to report that, "The Stanford
Placement Center is supposed to
provide this service, but
unfortunately its rapport with
both students and employers is
too weak and thus it is incapable
of filling the need."
It is interesting to note that
Mr. Roth does not supply
evidence to support his
statements. His comments
therefore become by simple
definition nothing more than
assertions and allegations. In this
connection and to the contrary it
can be reported as a matter of fact
that during the last academic year
reported upon, 2,269 students
registered with the Placement
Service seeking intermittent
employment. These 2,269
students secured 4,527 part-time
jobs from an offering of 6,133 job
openings which were identified by
Mrs. Barbara Cochran, the
Director of Student Employment,
with the aid of one clerical
assistant.
In fairness to Mrs. Cochran, it
also should be noted that she is
usually in her office until 10 p.m.
or later, four evenings a week and
several hours on weekends
compensating for the limitations
imposed by a two-employee staff.
Her accomplishments under the
circumstances would seem
considerable if reasonably
assessed.
I hope it is not unfair to say
that Mr. Roth's assessment,
without any apparent effort to
secure accurate information, is
not one which is likely to inspire
confidence in his integrity as a
reporter.

Blessed Friends
Editor, THE DAILY: For fear
I've missed someone, I am
publishing this note of thanks to
all of you for your love and gifts
to the East Palo Alto Community
Service Center during
Thanksgiving and Christmas. We
shall forever be grateful to all of
you that brought and sent your
gifts.
Our thanks to the many many
youngsters that shared their toys
with many of our children that
would not have enjoyed the
happiness of toys, because you
our friends and neighbors shared.
We served more than three
hundred families with enough
food and toys for each child in
every family. Clothing were
available for all. Again the staff of
the E.P.A. Community Center
along with all the people were
served. Thank all of you and wish
for all of you a blesses and
prosperous year and may your
heart be encouraged to continue
to help those that are in need.
Remember the Center is a
year-round project and need your
help to continue its service.

Songmy Incident
Editor, THE DAILY:
The following news was
collected by a committee that has
been assisting citizens in taxpayer
and selective service suits,
challenging the use of illegal
techniques and weapons in
Vietnam.
In Paris on November 20th, the
PRG delegation (People's
Revolutionary Government,
formed early this year by
Vietnamese political groups in
South Vietnam including the
NLF) released a letter written by
"a local section of the Liberation
Women's Association" that was
released in Hanoi by ambassador
Nguyen Van Tien "long before
the world press reported the
Songmy incidents."
The letter stated that after an
artillery attack, helicopters
brought troops. Continuing:
"From the moment of their
arrival, the aggressors opened
fire on everybody, sparing no
one, destroying houses and
livestock. Those in shelters
were machine-gunned or killed
by grenades. The U.S. troops
were shouting 'Vietcong!
Vietcong!' They covered a
wounded mother with a baby
at her breast with lime. Two
young women were raped and
then killed together with their
four children.... A group of
about one hundred women,
children and older people were
herded towards a canal bank
and machine-gunned and then
grenades were thrown into the
heap of wounded and dying
and dismembered bodies lying
in a sea of blood. Small
children who were not hit by
bullets or grenade fragments
were smothered under the
weight of bodies."
The letter stated that the
obvious purpose or the operation
was to destroy the village and

massacre the inhabitants.
Continuing, it states:
In a single day, 502 people in
our and neighboring hamlets
who were working here were
massacred under horrible
circumstances. Over 170
children were killed. Three
hundred houses were
destroyed, over 870 livestock
killed. In our hamlet .. .
nothing is left but ashes and
cries of grief. In virtually every
home candles are burning for
the dead."
Jumping back to where we are
in the U.S., authorities in
Washington are confering, to
decide if a ' ' special
civilian-military tribunal" will be
set up to try the men who have
been released from the service but
are under investigation for the
Songmy incident. A comment of
Captain Medina's council and
lawyer F. Lee Bailey is quite
significant, also.

In an interview printed in tne
NYT December 1, 1969 (p. 12)
Attorney Bailey said that he had
confered at length with Captain
Medina, and had sent a telegram to
President Nixon asking for a
conference with White House staff
members.
Describing the telegram Bailey
stated: "I said I thought this case,
and especially the case of Captain

Medina had very broad
implications far transcending any
individual. The company
commander gave a lawful order,
and now they are threatening to
punish him for it."
But a lot, politically, militarily
and legally, turns on exactly what
the intended order to Medina was.
Military officials as high as
General Creighton Abrahams have
characterized as "hard core" the
liberated or "enemy held"
provinces of coastal Quang Nam,
Quang Tin and Quang Ngai
provinces Songmy was in. The
district advisor Lt. Col. David
Gavin in Quang Ngai province
said, Songmy was in an area that
"had been Communist territory
since the 1940'5." It had been
liberated during the war against
the French.
Our research supports the view
that such disregard for life and
even intent to kill civilians is not
isolated to individuals but is a way
the military is attempting to solve
difficult problems.
At the November 20th news
conference, PRG spokesman
Dueng Dinh Thao reported a
massacre at Balagan village in
Quang Ngai province where
women, children and old men
were drowned during the
"accelerated pacification" drive
into the area last January.
Over 11,000 inhabitants,
"many of them attached
neck-to-neck by ropes," were put
into camps called relocation
centers while their village was
destroyed. The conditions in the
camp, with over 3200 women,
6700 children and more than a
thousand older men were cited as
unimaginable, without sufficient
food or any medical attention.
Since the PRG did not say, we do
not know if the status of the
civilians in the camp was that of
most civilians relocated in the
south in the drives.
He reported, however, that
when the people of the camp,
"inmates", began to struggle for
improvements of their conditions

early in March (they had been
moved in the operation of
January 13, 1969), three separate
groups of approximately 400 were
, loaded aboard barges that were
towed by naval vessels which
speeded up and made sharp turns,
capsizing the barges. He reported
that only one person survived and
the camp officials explained the
bodies that washed ashore for
many days afterwards as victims
who "were drowned in a storm
while being transferred to
Camranh."
We are collecting documents
and reports and in addition are
trying to set up a clipping service.
We thought that the Daily should
have this news as well as the news
that Dispatch News Service in
Viet-Nam has offered through us
their coverage of the Viet-Nam
events. Tom Fox, an IVS worker
now at Yale gave us that contact.

Marvelous Rapport
Editor, THE DAILY:
I was disappointed in the
inaccuracy of Randy Roth's
comments (January 9, 1970)
about the Placement Center.
Mr. Roth is incorrect in his
judgment that the Placement
Center's "rapport with both

students and employers is too
weak, and thus it is incapable of
filling the need" (i.e., to locate
employment).
As both an undergraduate and
a graduate student at Stanford, I
have always had excellent rapport
with the Placement Center, and its
staff has located a wide range of
part-time jobs for me. These have
varied from weekend manager of a
small restaurant to an internship
in a local school district.
Mr. Roth should more
carefully research his topic before
writing an article.
