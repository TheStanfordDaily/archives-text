### 
The Daily welcomes letters
from its readers on matters
concerning Stanford and the
world at large. In order to
receive consideration for
publication, they should be
typed on a 60 space line,
double spaced, and clearly
signed and identified.
Noms-de-plume and
pseudonoms will be used for
publication only if there is a
damn good reason.
