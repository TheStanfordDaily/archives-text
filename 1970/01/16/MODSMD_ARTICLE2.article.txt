# Housing Committee Hears Local Views

### BOB LITTERMAN 
Community participation from
the beginning in low and
m o d e r a t e - in come housing
programs emerged as a major
concern of organizations
appearing before the President's
Ad Hoc Committee on University
Housing.
One proposal which was
presented jointly by four of the
organizations and introduced by
the Urban Coalition, called for the
use of flexible housing units built
on steel frames which could be
maintained, remodeled, and
rebuilt at low cost. According to
Professor Richard Martin of SRI
the units represent a fusing of
production capabilities and
household requirements.
Acute Shortage
All speakers emphasized the
acute shortage of any low-income
housing in the mid-peninsula area.
Many called for the largest project
feasible, and several maintained
that no matter what Stanford
does it cannot solve the problem.
In marked contrast, the
supporters of the flexible housing
concept proposed that not only
could Stanford work to solve the
local problem, but that it could,
by supporting their program, help
to alleviate the housing problem
throughout the United States and
the world.
After several county officials
had spoken concerning the
desperate need for action on the
part of Stanford, the
vice-chairman of the committee,
Robert Rosensweig, felt
personally compelled to state his
opinion of the limit of Stanford's
responsibility.
Rosensweig said that 10 per
cent of the housing need would
represent a fair share for Stanford.
He said that instead of lessoning
local government responsibility
the Stanford project should bring
pressure to bear on the local
communities. Questioned about
how many Stanford students and
employees are competing for
housing in local communities, he
replied that it was less than
Lockheed brings in.
Janet Refem representing the
Mid-peninsula Community House,
called for the University to stop
all industrial development and
reconsider the Dillingham project
until a Master Plan was presented
to local communities and hearings
were held.
More People
One of the committee
members reported that the

Dillingham project would bring in
enough people to offset the
low-income housing the
University will probably build.
Upon further questioning, Ed
Scoles, Assistant Business Manager
of University housing, reported
that although "we've come down
the primrose path together for
years," Stanford and Dillingham
have not yet signed the lease.
Several questions in the
discussion after the presentations
related to the validity of the
composition of the Housing
committee. Several present called
for representation for Stanford
employees and those of
low-income.
