# Faculty Radicals Plan NUC Goals
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
The New University
Conference (NUC) held its second
meeting of the quarter Tuesday
night at Tresidder. The meeting
discussed NUC's role in the
United Stanford Employees
demands for staff representation
on University committees, heard
reports from committees it has
formed to present a radical
critique of the University from
the radical point of view, and
finally discussed what was exactly
NUC's function and how it should
go about achieving its goals.
It was unanimously felt that
NUC should support United
Stanford Employees and the
coalition of various staff oriented
groups which are presently trying
to bring about greater staff
participation in University
decision-making. John Harris, a
staff member employed at SLAC
and a member of USE was chosen
NUC's representative in this area.
Reports were then heard from
committees that NUC has set up to
study various aspects of the
University: graduate students,
their departments and related
problems; the role of women; and
radical teaching.
John Be rninghausen, a
graduate student in Asian
languages, felt that it was
necessary to investigate the power
structure of various departments
and the graduate student's
relationship to his department,
criticizing what he termed, "the
desire of most graduate schools to
train people to merely be
researchers."
Commenting on the faculty

perspective, John Flores, assistant
professor of German, also felt that
it was necessary for the
committee to take a hard look at
the hiring, salary, and tenure
policies of the University faculty,
stating that the people who are in
charge of hiring at Stanford have
"incestuous hiring practices." He
also felt it was necessary to
consider the idea of Stanford
faculty going outside of the
University and teaching the
working class or at Nairobi
College, for example.
In the areas of women and
radical teaching, Janet Weiss, a
graduate student in English, and
Chairman of the meeting, felt that
special preference ought to be
given to the hiring of women in
the University, due to its past
record of discrimination. Merle
Rabine, a freshman English T.A.
added that the NUC had been
neglecting the whole area of
producing radical teachers and
how to produce them.
At the close of the meeting,
there was a feeling by some that
with all of its energies focused on
the University, NUC was
somewhat neglecting its stated
goal of "politically creating a new
form of American Socialism."
However, there was also feeling
that the University was the most
natural place for students and
professors to start work. As
Joseph Hordigree, a campus
minister, put it, "If you're a
doctor and want to change things,
the most natural place to start is
in the hospital."
The next NUC meeting will be
Tuesday, January 27.

committee to take a hard look at
the hiring, salary, and tenure
policies of the University faculty,
stating that the people who are in
charge of hiring at Stanford have
"incestuous hiring practices." He
also felt it was necessary to
consider the idea of Stanford
faculty going outside of the
University and teaching the
working class or at Nairobi
College, for example.
In the areas of women and
radical teaching, Janet Weiss, a
graduate student in English, and
Chairman of the meeting, felt that
special preference ought to be
given to the hiring of women in
the University, due to its past
record of discrimination. Merle
Rabine, a freshman English T.A.
added that the NUC had been
neglecting the whole area of
producing radical teachers and
how to produce them.
At the close of the meeting,
there was a feeling by some that
with all of its energies focused on
the University, NUC was
somewhat neglecting its stated
goal of "politically creating a new
form of American Socialism."
However, there was also feeling
that the University was the most
natural place for students and
professors to start work. As
Joseph Hordigree, a campus
minister, put it, "If you're a
doctor and want to change things,
the most natural place to start is
in the hospital."
The next NUC meeting will be
Tuesday, January 27.
The New University
Conference (NUC) held its second
meeting of the quarter Tuesday
night at Tresidder. The meeting
discussed NUC's role in the
United Stanford Employees
demands for staff representation
on University committees, heard
reports from committees it has
formed to present a radical
critique of the University from
the radical point of view, and
finally discussed what was exactly
NUC's function and how it should
go about achieving its goals.
It was unanimously felt that
NUC should support United
Stanford Employees and the
coalition of various staff oriented
groups which are presently trying
to bring about greater staff
participation in University
decision-making. John Harris, a
staff member employed at SLAC
and a member of USE was chosen
NUC's representative in this area.
Reports were then heard from
committees that NUC has set up to
study various aspects of the
University: graduate students,
their departments and related
problems; the role of women; and
radical teaching.
John Be rninghausen, a
graduate student in Asian
languages, felt that it was
necessary to investigate the power
structure of various departments
and the graduate student's
relationship to his department,
criticizing what he termed, "the
desire of most graduate schools to
train people to merely be
researchers."
Commenting on the faculty

perspective, John Flores, assistant
professor of German, also felt that
it was necessary for the
committee to take a hard look at
the hiring, salary, and tenure
policies of the University faculty,
stating that the people who are in
charge of hiring at Stanford have
"incestuous hiring practices." He
also felt it was necessary to
