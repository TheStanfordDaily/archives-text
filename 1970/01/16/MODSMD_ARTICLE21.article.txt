# FCM Plans Suits Over Dec. 4 Clash
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
A forthcoming damage suit
against the University, a
continuing campaign to make
ASSU membership voluntary and
the effect of the new "Grass
Roots" organization on campus
politics were among the topics
discussed at a meeting of the Free
Campus Movement t FCM)
Wednesday night.
FCM President Harvey Hukari
said that a damage suit and an
injunction request would be filed
against the University at the end
of the month. The suits stem from
a Dec. 4 incident in Tresidder
Union when FCM members, who
had been photographing a picket
line at the Placement Center
protesting the presence of General
Electric recruiters, were attacked
by a group of pickets who
objected to the photographers.
In the ensuing scuffle, which
lasted half an hour, calls to local
police agencies for help by FCM
supporters failed to bring
assistance any closer than the
Union's parking lot.
According to Hukari, the
intention of the suit is to get
Stanford to take its responsibility
for protecting student's rights
seriously.
". . . . Ultimately I expect the
suits to be very productive," he
said.
While acknowledging the
importance of proper land use,
Hukari criticized the radical
takeover of local conservation
groups.
" 'Grass Roots' is following the
same pattern of radicalization as
the April Third Movement," he
explained.

Hukari said that 'Grass Roots'
could lead unsuspecting
conservationists into violent
confrontation with local
authorities. He strongly criticized
'Grass Roots' leaders Paul Rupert,
Mike Sweeney and Mary Hanson
for "urging people on to the
barricades but never getting
busted themselves."
The twenty FCM members
present also discussed possible
plans for bringing conservative
and libertarian speakers to the
campus and running an anarchist
candidate for ASSU president in
the spring.
