# Meditation Professor Claims 'Life Is Bliss'

"TM in the AM and the PM."
Goes the slogan. It describes both
the personal life style and the
ultimate social goal of Jerry
Jarvis, this Quarter's ASSU
professor and national head of
Students International Meditation
Society.
Jarvis' lecture style reflects the
peace and lack of tension which
he feels is the result of
transcendental meditation.
Speaking slowly and deliberately,
with sincere conviction and a
quick answer to every question,
he is an excellent salesman for TM
(Transcendental Meditation), a
technique which claims to enable
the individual to lead a happier,
more fulfilled life on his own
terms.

"Wars, injustices, increasing
disease, crimes, these are anti-life.
But these things are symptoms,
not problems. Social agencies deal
with the symptoms. More
hospitals, more police to cope. It's
like trying to stop a river at the
mouth, rather than the source."
"Constructive social change
comes from the same place as the
problems—the individuals who
make up society. If one percent of
the world population were
meditators, their influence would
be sufficient to neutralize the
tension of the other 99 percent.
When that occurs, war could not
happen. It is the most effective
political action to stop wars once
and for all."
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
This 1 percent goal necessitates
a busy schedule for Jarvis, who
must keep numerous speaking
engagements as well as performing
his administrative functions at
SIMS and teaching his course at
Stanford. Jarvis was not involved
in any meditation at all until
1961, when he saw a newspaper
ad for a lecture in Los Angeles by
the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the

foremost teacher and world leader
of transcendental meditation.
"I had always had hopes of
someday meeting a rishi, which
means holy sage. I thought it
would be good even to see how
such a great man walked. When I
fould out that maharishi means
great holy sage, it seemed worth
looking into. I heard the
introductory lecture and started
meditating, and I have found that
it is all he said it was."
Later Jarvis took the
Maharishi's three month course in
India to learn to be a teacher of

meditation, and in 1966, the
SIMS was started, with Jarvis
appointed as director. He began
teaching on campus at UCLA that
year. Since then, the movement
has been spreading rapidly.
"The current interest in
meditation represents the
increasing need of man to find a
way to cope with living. He feels
increasingly restricted in his
progress, and the ways that have
been offered for centuries have
failed to remove the restrictions.
However, transcendental
meditation allows man to evolve
in an unrestricted way."
Bliss Consciousness
"The nature of the mind is to
be in bliss consciousness, not to
wander, but to be satisfied and
contented. The natural tendency
of the mind is to seek a state of
greater happiness. This is the basic
motivation of human life. If it is
hindered or thwarted, we feel
tension, pain, suffering."
Meditation removes this
tension becauses it makes it
possible to draw on infinite
individual resources of energy,
intelligence and happiness. The
individual's potential for action is
increased because of his expanded
more profound consciousness.
Jarvis emphasizes that
transcendental meditation
involves only a mechanical
technique. "It's not necessary to
have any emotional or intellectual
committment, or even to believe
that it will work. It's better to be
sceptical than to have blind faith
in the whole thing. Meditation is
based on direct experience. All we
ask is that you see for yourself."

meditation allows man to evolve

"The nature of the mind is to
be in bliss consciousness, not to
wander, but to be satisfied and
contented. The natural tendency
of the mind is to seek a state of
greater happiness. This is the basic
motivation of human life. If it is
hindered or thwarted, we feel
tension, pain, suffering."
Meditation removes this
tension becauses it makes it
possible to draw on infinite
individual resources of energy,
intelligence and happiness. The
individual's potential for action is
increased because of his expanded
more profound consciousness.
Jarvis emphasizes that
transcendental meditation
involves only a mechanical
technique. "It's not necessary to
have any emotional or intellectual
committment, or even to believe
that it will work. It's better to be
sceptical than to have blind faith
in the whole thing. Meditation is
based on direct experience. All we
ask is that you see for yourself."
"TM in the AM and the PM."
Goes the slogan. It describes both
the personal life style and the
ultimate social goal of Jerry
Jarvis, this Quarter's ASSU
professor and national head of
Students International Meditation
Society.
Jarvis' lecture style reflects the
peace and lack of tension which
he feels is the result of
transcendental meditation.
Speaking slowly and deliberately,
with sincere conviction and a
quick answer to every question,
he is an excellent salesman for TM
(Transcendental Meditation), a
technique which claims to enable
the individual to lead a happier,
more fulfilled life on his own
terms.

"Wars, injustices, increasing
disease, crimes, these are anti-life.
But these things are symptoms,
not problems. Social agencies deal
with the symptoms. More
hospitals, more police to cope. It's
like trying to stop a river at the
mouth, rather than the source."
"Constructive social change
comes from the same place as the
problems—the individuals who
make up society. If one percent of
the world population were
meditators, their influence would
be sufficient to neutralize the
tension of the other 99 percent.
When that occurs, war could not
happen. It is the most effective
political action to stop wars once
and for all."
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
This 1 percent goal necessitates
a busy schedule for Jarvis, who
must keep numerous speaking
engagements as well as performing
his administrative functions at
SIMS and teaching his course at
Stanford. Jarvis was not involved
in any meditation at all until
1961, when he saw a newspaper
ad for a lecture in Los Angeles by
the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the

foremost teacher and world leader
of transcendental meditation.
"I had always had hopes of
someday meeting a rishi, which
means holy sage. I thought it
would be good even to see how
such a great man walked. When I
fould out that maharishi means
great holy sage, it seemed worth
looking into. I heard the
introductory lecture and started
meditating, and I have found that
it is all he said it was."
Later Jarvis took the
Maharishi's three month course in
India to learn to be a teacher of

meditation, and in 1966, the
SIMS was started, with Jarvis
appointed as director. He began
teaching on campus at UCLA that
year. Since then, the movement
has been spreading rapidly.
"The current interest in
meditation represents the
increasing need of man to find a
way to cope with living. He feels
increasingly restricted in his
progress, and the ways that have
been offered for centuries have
failed to remove the restrictions.
However, transcendental
meditation allows man to evolve
in an unrestricted way."
