# 'Don't Want A Strike'
## Teamsters Ask Meeting 
### ED KOHN 
Second of a series
One of the universal
complaints voiced by the men
who want to join the Teamsters
Union is the University's low
salaries coupled with the lack of
tenure. Although the University's
official pay base is $400 per
month, some of the gardeners
have been working on an hourly
basis at $2 per hour. Only within
the past six weeks have these
employees been classified as full
time employees and paid the $400
monthly minimum.
Several of the Physical Plant
employees told the Dail> during
one of the November meetings
that they continued to work for
Stanford, despite salaries that
they contend rank among the
lowest on the Peninsula, because
they thought that they were
employed under some sort of
"gentlemen's agreement tenure."
However, no tenure (job
security) provision exists for the
staff; in fact, they do not work
under a contract. Tenure is
offered only to high-ranking
members of the faculty and
administration. "No one ever gets
fired at Stanford" is an old
employee slogan that is heard
time and time again—in a jeering
tone—for most of the workers,
particularly those in the Physical
Plant, know of the carpenters'
situation.
Plant employees are also
concerned about their fringe
benefits, seniority rights, working
conditions and safety, retirement
and pension plans, insurance
options and grievance
proceedures. The men say that
new employees are being paid as
much as, or more than, they are,
with less experience and less
seniority. They also say that their
pay raises are sporatic.
The plant's apprentice program
has come under heavy fire at
several meetings from workers
who state that they are required
to complete segments of the
unaccredited correspondence
school course instruction they
receive on their own time. These
employees also state that they do
not receive the training that they
first expected when they were
hired here.

When these men questioned
some members of the Plant's
administration about the program
some months ago, they were told,

in effect, to 'like it or leave,' says
Keith Stothers.
About 150 out of a little more
than 200 employees at the
Physical Plant have signed
''authorization for
representation" letters with Local
856. These letters, which are
being held by the union in their
San Francisco office, give the
Teamsters the right to ask the
University to hold an election to
determine whether or not the
Teamsters should be permitted to
represent the Physical Plant
employees. These letters do not
bind the signers to vote for the
union in the balloting.
However, these letters of intent
may prove useless if the
University refuses to deal with the
Teamsters at all. Since the NLRB
has ruled that it cannot intervene
in matters pertaining to non-profit
educational institutions, the
Teamsters and Physical Plant
employees may find the going a
bit rough during the coming
months.
Doesn't Want Strike
Art Davis, a business
representative of Local 856, told
the Daily earlier this week that
"We don't want a strike here."
However, he said that the union
might not have another recourse
of action if the University
continues to rebuff its efforts to
hold a representation election. He
added that the Teamsters and the
Physical Plant employees could
effectively shut down the school.
In a letter that President Pitzer
sent Rudy Tham, Seretary of
Local 856, on Dec. 11, he said:
"With regard to your request
for a meeting to discuss a
bargaining unit and the initiation
of contract negotiation, the
University administration believes
that any problems or questions
affecting its employees can be
satisfactorily resolved within the
University community itself by
the employees and the
administration without need of
participation by an outside
organization such as your Union.
The University believes that it has
no obligation, legal or otherwise,
to meet with you and your Union
to negotiate on contract terms
and conditions of employment for
the Physical Plant Department.
No University Obligation
"We shall, as has been our
policy in the past, be glad to meet

with and to arrange for meetings
between members of Stanford's
staff and their supervisors or
department heads to discuss any
questions regarding their
employment which they may wish
to raise. In other words, although
Stanford declines your request to
engage in collective bargaining
with you, it is always willing to
have its employees, individually or
in groups, bring up for discussion
any matters involving their
employment.
"Concerning your statement
that there have been incidents of
discrimination against Stanford
employees because of their
affiliation with your Union, please
be assured that it is the policy of
Stanford University not to
interfere in any way with the
formation or activities of
voluntary employee organizations.
This policy has been
communicated to all department
heads and will be brought to their
attention periodically. Enclosed
for your information is a recent
memorandum on this subject."
In his reply to the University
president, Tham asked Pitzer to
clarify his previous letter, noting
that his statement was
"confusing .. .(and that) we
would like to have the matter
clarified "
"Hard To Reconcile"
Tham said in part:
"Both the text of your letter
and the content of the
memorandum which you enclosed
clearly state that University
employees are free to join and
participate in "voluntary
employee organizations,"
including labor unions which are
seeking representation rights and
improved wages and working
conditions for their members. We
find this policy hard to reconcile
with another statement in your
letter to the effect that "questions
affecting (University) employees
can be satisfactorily resolved
within the University itself by the
employees and the administration
and without the need of
participation by an outside
organization such as (Local 856)."
Does this mean that you will
refuse to recognize and meet with
Local 856, which University
employees are free under
University policy to join and
designate as their representative,
even if an overwhelming majority
within an appropriate bargaining
unit have freely selected it as their
collective bargaining
representative?
"Our interest in this matter is
in giving effective representation
to the Physical Department
employees who have authorized
us to speak in their behalf with
respect to their wages and
working conditions. Before we
decide our course of action, we
feel we have a responsibility to
obtain from you an unambigious
answer to the question whether
the University will reject
collective bargaining with us
irrespective of the wishes of its
employees. As you can readily
understand, it is only fair to you
and ourselves that the University's
position on this matter be known
to the employees involved, and
that the policy and actions of
Local 856 be based upon accurate
information."
Under Pressure
Tham closed his letter by
stating that "we are under
considerable pressure to act, but
we do not think that we should
do so without hearing from you."
Davis said that if the men at
the Physical Plant wished to do
so, an informational picket line
would be set up. He noted that
during the bi-weekly meetings
Plant employees have been
consistently demanding action. He
said that a vote on the picket line
could come "within four to six
weeks." He said that this step,
which would be undertaken only
with overwhelming worker
support, would be an extreme
move that would only follow the
University's refusal to recognize
the union.
He said that the Teamsters
would take steps to sue the
University if any employee is fired
because of his union affiliation.
Davis said that he was checking
out reports of intimidation by
some supervisory personnel.

"gentlemen's agreement tenure."
However, no tenure (job
security) provision exists for the
staff; in fact, they do not work
under a contract. Tenure is
offered only to high-ranking
members of the faculty and
administration. "No one ever gets
fired at Stanford" is an old
employee slogan that is heard
time and time again—in a jeering
tone—for most of the workers,
particularly those in the Physical
Plant, know of the carpenters'
situation.
Plant employees are also
concerned about their fringe
benefits, seniority rights, working
conditions and safety, retirement
and pension plans, insurance
options and grievance
proceedures. The men say that
new employees are being paid as
much as, or more than, they are,
with less experience and less
seniority. They also say that their
pay raises are sporatic.
The plant's apprentice program
has come under heavy fire at
several meetings from workers
who state that they are required
to complete segments of the
unaccredited correspondence
school course instruction they
receive on their own time. These
employees also state that they do
not receive the training that they
first expected when they were
hired here.

When these men questioned
some members of the Plant's
administration about the program
some months ago, they were told,

in effect, to 'like it or leave,' says
Keith Stothers.
About 150 out of a little more
than 200 employees at the
Physical Plant have signed
''authorization for
representation" letters with Local
856. These letters, which are
being held by the union in their
San Francisco office, give the
Teamsters the right to ask the
University to hold an election to
determine whether or not the
Teamsters should be permitted to
represent the Physical Plant
employees. These letters do not
bind the signers to vote for the
union in the balloting.
However, these letters of intent
may prove useless if the
University refuses to deal with the
Teamsters at all. Since the NLRB
has ruled that it cannot intervene
in matters pertaining to non-profit
educational institutions, the
Teamsters and Physical Plant
employees may find the going a
bit rough during the coming
months.
Doesn't Want Strike
Art Davis, a business
representative of Local 856, told
the Daily earlier this week that
"We don't want a strike here."
However, he said that the union
might not have another recourse
of action if the University
continues to rebuff its efforts to
hold a representation election. He
added that the Teamsters and the
Physical Plant employees could
effectively shut down the school.
In a letter that President Pitzer
sent Rudy Tham, Seretary of
Local 856, on Dec. 11, he said:
"With regard to your request
for a meeting to discuss a
bargaining unit and the initiation
of contract negotiation, the
University administration believes
that any problems or questions
affecting its employees can be
satisfactorily resolved within the
University community itself by
the employees and the
administration without need of
participation by an outside
organization such as your Union.
The University believes that it has
no obligation, legal or otherwise,
to meet with you and your Union
to negotiate on contract terms
and conditions of employment for
the Physical Plant Department.
No University Obligation
"We shall, as has been our
policy in the past, be glad to meet

with and to arrange for meetings
between members of Stanford's
staff and their supervisors or
department heads to discuss any
questions regarding their
employment which they may wish
to raise. In other words, although
Stanford declines your request to
engage in collective bargaining
with you, it is always willing to
have its employees, individually or
in groups, bring up for discussion
any matters involving their
employment.
"Concerning your statement
that there have been incidents of
discrimination against Stanford
employees because of their
affiliation with your Union, please
be assured that it is the policy of
Stanford University not to
interfere in any way with the
formation or activities of
voluntary employee organizations.
This policy has been
communicated to all department
heads and will be brought to their
attention periodically. Enclosed
for your information is a recent
memorandum on this subject."
In his reply to the University
president, Tham asked Pitzer to
clarify his previous letter, noting
that his statement was
"confusing .. .(and that) we
would like to have the matter
clarified "
"Hard To Reconcile"
Tham said in part:
"Both the text of your letter
and the content of the
memorandum which you enclosed
clearly state that University
employees are free to join and
participate in "voluntary
employee organizations,"
including labor unions which are
seeking representation rights and
improved wages and working
conditions for their members. We
find this policy hard to reconcile
with another statement in your
letter to the effect that "questions
affecting (University) employees
can be satisfactorily resolved
within the University itself by the
employees and the administration
and without the need of
participation by an outside
organization such as (Local 856)."
Does this mean that you will
refuse to recognize and meet with
Local 856, which University
employees are free under
University policy to join and
designate as their representative,
even if an overwhelming majority
within an appropriate bargaining
unit have freely selected it as their
collective bargaining
representative?
"Our interest in this matter is
in giving effective representation
to the Physical Department
employees who have authorized
us to speak in their behalf with
respect to their wages and
working conditions. Before we
decide our course of action, we
feel we have a responsibility to
obtain from you an unambigious
answer to the question whether
the University will reject
collective bargaining with us
irrespective of the wishes of its
employees. As you can readily
understand, it is only fair to you
and ourselves that the University's
position on this matter be known
to the employees involved, and
that the policy and actions of
Local 856 be based upon accurate
information."
Under Pressure
Tham closed his letter by
stating that "we are under
considerable pressure to act, but
we do not think that we should
do so without hearing from you."
Davis said that if the men at
the Physical Plant wished to do
so, an informational picket line
would be set up. He noted that
during the bi-weekly meetings
Plant employees have been
consistently demanding action. He
said that a vote on the picket line
could come "within four to six
weeks." He said that this step,
which would be undertaken only
with overwhelming worker
support, would be an extreme
move that would only follow the
University's refusal to recognize
the union.
He said that the Teamsters
would take steps to sue the
University if any employee is fired
because of his union affiliation.
Davis said that he was checking
out reports of intimidation by
some supervisory personnel.
(Monday: An explanation of
the Teamsters Union's support on

Second of a series
One of the universal
complaints voiced by the men
who want to join the Teamsters
Union is the University's low
salaries coupled with the lack of
tenure. Although the University's
official pay base is $400 per
month, some of the gardeners
have been working on an hourly
basis at $2 per hour. Only within
the past six weeks have these
employees been classified as full
time employees and paid the $400
monthly minimum.
Several of the Physical Plant
employees told the Dail> during
one of the November meetings
that they continued to work for
Stanford, despite salaries that
they contend rank among the
lowest on the Peninsula, because
they thought that they were
employed under some sort of
"gentlemen's agreement tenure."

seniority. They also say that their
pay raises are sporatic.
The plant's apprentice program
has come under heavy fire at
several meetings from workers
who state that they are required
to complete segments of the
unaccredited correspondence
school course instruction they
receive on their own time. These
employees also state that they do
not receive the training that they
first expected when they were
hired here.

When these men questioned
some members of the Plant's
administration about the program
some months ago, they were told,

in effect, to 'like it or leave,' says
Keith Stothers.
About 150 out of a little more
than 200 employees at the
Physical Plant have signed
''authorization for
representation" letters with Local
856. These letters, which are
being held by the union in their
San Francisco office, give the
Teamsters the right to ask the
University to hold an election to
determine whether or not the
Teamsters should be permitted to
represent the Physical Plant
employees. These letters do not
bind the signers to vote for the
union in the balloting.
However, these letters of intent
may prove useless if the
University refuses to deal with the
Teamsters at all. Since the NLRB
has ruled that it cannot intervene
in matters pertaining to non-profit
educational institutions, the
Teamsters and Physical Plant
employees may find the going a
bit rough during the coming
months.
Doesn't Want Strike
Art Davis, a business
representative of Local 856, told
the Daily earlier this week that
"We don't want a strike here."
However, he said that the union
might not have another recourse
of action if the University
continues to rebuff its efforts to
hold a representation election. He
added that the Teamsters and the
Physical Plant employees could
effectively shut down the school.
In a letter that President Pitzer
sent Rudy Tham, Seretary of
Local 856, on Dec. 11, he said:
"With regard to your request
for a meeting to discuss a
bargaining unit and the initiation
of contract negotiation, the
University administration believes
that any problems or questions
affecting its employees can be
satisfactorily resolved within the
University community itself by
the employees and the
administration without need of
participation by an outside
organization such as your Union.
The University believes that it has
no obligation, legal or otherwise,
to meet with you and your Union
to negotiate on contract terms
and conditions of employment for
the Physical Plant Department.
No University Obligation
"We shall, as has been our
policy in the past, be glad to meet

with and to arrange for meetings
between members of Stanford's
staff and their supervisors or
department heads to discuss any
questions regarding their
employment which they may wish
to raise. In other words, although
Stanford declines your request to
engage in collective bargaining
with you, it is always willing to
have its employees, individually or
in groups, bring up for discussion
any matters involving their
employment.
"Concerning your statement
that there have been incidents of
discrimination against Stanford
employees because of their
affiliation with your Union, please
be assured that it is the policy of
Stanford University not to
interfere in any way with the
formation or activities of
voluntary employee organizations.
This policy has been
communicated to all department
heads and will be brought to their
attention periodically. Enclosed
for your information is a recent
memorandum on this subject."
In his reply to the University
president, Tham asked Pitzer to
clarify his previous letter, noting
that his statement was
"confusing .. .(and that) we
would like to have the matter
clarified "
"Hard To Reconcile"
Tham said in part:
"Both the text of your letter
and the content of the
memorandum which you enclosed
clearly state that University
employees are free to join and
participate in "voluntary
employee organizations,"
including labor unions which are
seeking representation rights and
improved wages and working
conditions for their members. We
find this policy hard to reconcile
with another statement in your
letter to the effect that "questions
affecting (University) employees
can be satisfactorily resolved
within the University itself by the
employees and the administration
and without the need of
participation by an outside
organization such as (Local 856)."
Does this mean that you will
refuse to recognize and meet with
Local 856, which University
employees are free under
University policy to join and
designate as their representative,
even if an overwhelming majority
within an appropriate bargaining
unit have freely selected it as their
collective bargaining
representative?
"Our interest in this matter is
in giving effective representation
to the Physical Department
employees who have authorized
us to speak in their behalf with
respect to their wages and
working conditions. Before we
decide our course of action, we
feel we have a responsibility to
obtain from you an unambigious
answer to the question whether
the University will reject
collective bargaining with us
irrespective of the wishes of its
employees. As you can readily
understand, it is only fair to you
and ourselves that the University's
position on this matter be known
to the employees involved, and
that the policy and actions of
Local 856 be based upon accurate
information."
Under Pressure
Tham closed his letter by
stating that "we are under
considerable pressure to act, but
we do not think that we should
do so without hearing from you."
Davis said that if the men at
the Physical Plant wished to do
so, an informational picket line
would be set up. He noted that
during the bi-weekly meetings
Plant employees have been
consistently demanding action. He
said that a vote on the picket line
could come "within four to six
weeks." He said that this step,
which would be undertaken only
with overwhelming worker
support, would be an extreme
move that would only follow the
University's refusal to recognize
the union.
He said that the Teamsters
would take steps to sue the
University if any employee is fired
because of his union affiliation.
Davis said that he was checking
out reports of intimidation by
some supervisory personnel.
(Monday: An explanation of
the Teamsters Union's support on
campus.)
Second of a series
One of the universal
complaints voiced by the men
who want to join the Teamsters
Union is the University's low
salaries coupled with the lack of
tenure. Although the University's
official pay base is $400 per
month, some of the gardeners
have been working on an hourly
basis at $2 per hour. Only within
the past six weeks have these
employees been classified as full
time employees and paid the $400
monthly minimum.
Several of the Physical Plant
employees told the Dail> during
one of the November meetings
that they continued to work for
Stanford, despite salaries that
they contend rank among the
lowest on the Peninsula, because
they thought that they were
employed under some sort of
"gentlemen's agreement tenure."
However, no tenure (job
security) provision exists for the
staff; in fact, they do not work
under a contract. Tenure is
offered only to high-ranking
members of the faculty and
administration. "No one ever gets
fired at Stanford" is an old
employee slogan that is heard
time and time again—in a jeering
tone—for most of the workers,
particularly those in the Physical
Plant, know of the carpenters'
situation.
Plant employees are also
concerned about their fringe
benefits, seniority rights, working
conditions and safety, retirement
and pension plans, insurance
options and grievance
proceedures. The men say that
new employees are being paid as
much as, or more than, they are,
with less experience and less
seniority. They also say that their
pay raises are sporatic.

856. These letters, which are
being held by the union in their
San Francisco office, give the
Teamsters the right to ask the
University to hold an election to
determine whether or not the
Teamsters should be permitted to
represent the Physical Plant
employees. These letters do not
bind the signers to vote for the
union in the balloting.
However, these letters of intent
may prove useless if the
University refuses to deal with the
Teamsters at all. Since the NLRB
has ruled that it cannot intervene
in matters pertaining to non-profit
educational institutions, the
Teamsters and Physical Plant
employees may find the going a
bit rough during the coming
months.
Doesn't Want Strike
Art Davis, a business
representative of Local 856, told
the Daily earlier this week that
"We don't want a strike here."
However, he said that the union
might not have another recourse
of action if the University
continues to rebuff its efforts to
hold a representation election. He
added that the Teamsters and the
Physical Plant employees could
effectively shut down the school.
In a letter that President Pitzer
sent Rudy Tham, Seretary of
Local 856, on Dec. 11, he said:
"With regard to your request
for a meeting to discuss a
bargaining unit and the initiation
of contract negotiation, the
University administration believes
that any problems or questions
affecting its employees can be
satisfactorily resolved within the
University community itself by
the employees and the
administration without need of
participation by an outside
organization such as your Union.
The University believes that it has
no obligation, legal or otherwise,
to meet with you and your Union
to negotiate on contract terms
and conditions of employment for
the Physical Plant Department.
No University Obligation
"We shall, as has been our
policy in the past, be glad to meet

with and to arrange for meetings
between members of Stanford's
staff and their supervisors or
department heads to discuss any
questions regarding their
employment which they may wish
to raise. In other words, although
Stanford declines your request to
engage in collective bargaining
with you, it is always willing to
have its employees, individually or
in groups, bring up for discussion
any matters involving their
employment.
"Concerning your statement
that there have been incidents of
discrimination against Stanford
employees because of their
affiliation with your Union, please
be assured that it is the policy of
Stanford University not to
interfere in any way with the
formation or activities of
voluntary employee organizations.
This policy has been
communicated to all department
heads and will be brought to their
attention periodically. Enclosed
for your information is a recent
memorandum on this subject."
In his reply to the University
president, Tham asked Pitzer to
clarify his previous letter, noting
that his statement was
"confusing .. .(and that) we
would like to have the matter
clarified "
"Hard To Reconcile"
Tham said in part:
"Both the text of your letter
and the content of the
memorandum which you enclosed
clearly state that University
employees are free to join and
participate in "voluntary
employee organizations,"
including labor unions which are
seeking representation rights and
improved wages and working
conditions for their members. We
find this policy hard to reconcile
with another statement in your
letter to the effect that "questions
affecting (University) employees
can be satisfactorily resolved
within the University itself by the
employees and the administration
and without the need of
participation by an outside
organization such as (Local 856)."
Does this mean that you will
refuse to recognize and meet with
Local 856, which University
employees are free under
University policy to join and
designate as their representative,
even if an overwhelming majority
within an appropriate bargaining
unit have freely selected it as their
collective bargaining
representative?
"Our interest in this matter is
in giving effective representation
to the Physical Department
employees who have authorized
us to speak in their behalf with
respect to their wages and
working conditions. Before we
decide our course of action, we
feel we have a responsibility to
obtain from you an unambigious
answer to the question whether
the University will reject
collective bargaining with us
irrespective of the wishes of its
employees. As you can readily
understand, it is only fair to you
and ourselves that the University's
position on this matter be known
to the employees involved, and
that the policy and actions of
Local 856 be based upon accurate
information."
Under Pressure
Tham closed his letter by
stating that "we are under
considerable pressure to act, but
we do not think that we should
do so without hearing from you."
Davis said that if the men at
the Physical Plant wished to do
so, an informational picket line
would be set up. He noted that
during the bi-weekly meetings
Plant employees have been
consistently demanding action. He
said that a vote on the picket line
could come "within four to six
weeks." He said that this step,
which would be undertaken only
with overwhelming worker
support, would be an extreme
move that would only follow the
University's refusal to recognize
the union.
He said that the Teamsters
would take steps to sue the
University if any employee is fired
because of his union affiliation.
Davis said that he was checking
out reports of intimidation by
some supervisory personnel.

Second of a series
One of the universal
complaints voiced by the men
who want to join the Teamsters
Union is the University's low
salaries coupled with the lack of
tenure. Although the University's
official pay base is $400 per
month, some of the gardeners
have been working on an hourly
basis at $2 per hour. Only within
the past six weeks have these
employees been classified as full
time employees and paid the $400
monthly minimum.
Several of the Physical Plant
employees told the Dail> during
one of the November meetings
that they continued to work for
Stanford, despite salaries that
they contend rank among the
lowest on the Peninsula, because
they thought that they were
employed under some sort of
"gentlemen's agreement tenure."
However, no tenure (job
security) provision exists for the
staff; in fact, they do not work
under a contract. Tenure is
offered only to high-ranking
members of the faculty and
administration. "No one ever gets
fired at Stanford" is an old
employee slogan that is heard
time and time again—in a jeering
tone—for most of the workers,
particularly those in the Physical
Plant, know of the carpenters'
situation.
Plant employees are also
concerned about their fringe
benefits, seniority rights, working
conditions and safety, retirement
and pension plans, insurance
options and grievance
proceedures. The men say that
new employees are being paid as
much as, or more than, they are,
with less experience and less
seniority. They also say that their
pay raises are sporatic.
The plant's apprentice program
has come under heavy fire at
several meetings from workers
who state that they are required
to complete segments of the
unaccredited correspondence
school course instruction they
receive on their own time. These
employees also state that they do
not receive the training that they
first expected when they were
hired here.
Letters Request Vote
When these men questioned
some members of the Plant's
administration about the program
some months ago, they were told,

in effect, to 'like it or leave,' says
Keith Stothers.
About 150 out of a little more
than 200 employees at the
Physical Plant have signed
''authorization for
representation" letters with Local
856. These letters, which are
being held by the union in their
San Francisco office, give the
Teamsters the right to ask the
University to hold an election to
determine whether or not the
Teamsters should be permitted to
represent the Physical Plant
employees. These letters do not
bind the signers to vote for the
