# Petitions Ask Ballot Additions

Put this in your pipe and
smoke it: Phenol Formaldehyde
Resin, Pyrolized Hydrocarbons,
calcium, magnesium and sodium
carbonates, aldehydes, organic
acid residues, etc., etc., etc.
Chances are you wouldn't inhale a
puff on this stuff any more than
you'd pack your proverbial pipe
with dried manure, had you a
choice in the matter.
The sad fact is, however, that
you have no choice, simply
because the aromas of the
above-named chemicals are
ever-present in the air we breathe
daily. And these vile pollutants
comprise only part of the list of
the daily excretions of but one
local factory. The roll call of
various types of industrial waste
contaminating our biosphere goes
far beyond the simple "carbon

monoxide" and "sulfur dioxide"
greeted by Jeanie in HAIR.
Principal antagonists in the
continuing battle over air
pollution are the Bay Area Air
Pollution Control District
(BAAPCD) and the Citizens
Against Air Pollution, Inc.
(CAAP). BAAPCD is an arm of
local government that was set up
in 1955 to establish and enforce
restrictions on the releasing of
contaminants into the atmosphere
of the Bay Area. CAAP and other
citizens' groups, however, contend
that BAAPCD is merely collecting
its nearly $2 million a year in tax
revenues and is doing nothing to
help alleviate the constantly
worsening air pollution situation.
As an example, CAAP members
cite the fact that one of
BAAPCD's criteria for
determining whether or not the
smoke spewed out by a factory is

within acceptable limitations is an
e ye b a 11 - c h a r t proceedure
developed in 1899 for estimating
the density of coal smoke by its
relative blackness. According to
this test, equipment for removing
contaminant particles is
completely adequate so long as
smoke emerges from the chimney
no darker in color than
"pigeon-grey".
Ballot Petitions
In order to strengthen existing
pollution control measures and to
insure the efficiency of
governmental pollution-control
bureaus, as well as to place some
of the responsibility for limiting
pollution on the shoulders of the
offenders themselves, CAAP is
sponsoring two petitions to have
anti-pollution measures placed on
the ballot in the upcoming 1970
elections.
Green Ballot
One, the green ballot, requires
325,178 signatures of registered
voters. If successful, the following
items will appear on the 1970
election ballot for a vote of the
people of California to change the
current statutes. It:
1. Declares that each industrial
or manufacturing plant must

record and publish a list of all
pollutants discharged within six
months after the measure is
passed and e\e r y month
thereafter. (Thus, there can no
longer be protected and concealed
pollutants as there now are,
despite the existence of the Bay
Area Air Pollution Control
District, paid to patrol pollution.)
2. Requires that upon the
request of any citizen, certain
designated law enforcement
officers must demand that
polluters reduce their pollutants
to one per cent within five years
or lace se\ere penalties.
3. Provides that 1972 or later
model petroleum-powered motor
vehicles and other specified
vehicles, must have anti-pollution
devices which meet prescribed
standards.
4. In order to assure the
enforcement of this initiative,
once passed, included in the
wording is a provision for
state-financed sources to monitor
the polluters. Otherwise the
measure could conceivably be set
aside for lack of allocated funds
by sources opposed to this effort
to end the pollution of our
California environment. The

amount necessary for such
monitoring is far less than that
involved in cleaning up pollution
devastation. For example, in the
Lansing and Detroit, Michigan
areas, tax-payers are obliged to
provide some $115 million to
clean up a portion of polluted
Lake Erie.
\\ hite Petition
The white petition requires
5 2 0,276 registered California
voters' signatures. It, too will
appear on the 1970 election ballot
for a popular vote if successful.
This initiative would:
1. Amend the Health and
Safety Code of the California
State Constitution declaring that
"All persons have the inalienable
right to live in an environment
free of pollution and
contamination. . . The primary
responsibility for eliminating
environmental pollution rests
upon the manufacturers of
pollution-producing products and
industries which cause pollution
in their activities. The burden of
pollution control shall not be
placed upon the individual citizen
by exhorbitant profiteering,
excessive taxes or otherwise." In
other words, it will be up to those
responsible for polluting to
finance the cleaning-up projects
and not up to tax-supported
control and enforcement agencies
and not up to the people to pay
by facing higher prices on
products.
Deadline Near
The deadline for filing
petitions in Monday, Jan. 19,
1970. A petition to be signed by
Santa Clara County registered
voters is available at information
desks in all Co-op markets when
the desk is manned by the
consumer adviser or a volunteer.
Santa Clara County petition
coordinator, Mrs. Jeanne Martin
said that there is also a pressing
need for more people to take the
petitions around to gather
signatures. Extra copies of the
petitions may be picked up at the
Co-op markets.

petitions or about the Citizens
against Air Pollution can be

Area Air Pollution Control
District, paid to patrol pollution.)
2. Requires that upon the
request of any citizen, certain
designated law enforcement
officers must demand that
polluters reduce their pollutants
to one per cent within five years
or lace se\ere penalties.
3. Provides that 1972 or later
model petroleum-powered motor
vehicles and other specified
vehicles, must have anti-pollution
devices which meet prescribed
standards.
4. In order to assure the
enforcement of this initiative,
once passed, included in the
wording is a provision for
state-financed sources to monitor
the polluters. Otherwise the
measure could conceivably be set
aside for lack of allocated funds
by sources opposed to this effort
to end the pollution of our
California environment. The

amount necessary for such
monitoring is far less than that
involved in cleaning up pollution
devastation. For example, in the
Lansing and Detroit, Michigan
areas, tax-payers are obliged to
provide some $115 million to
clean up a portion of polluted
Lake Erie.
\\ hite Petition
The white petition requires
5 2 0,276 registered California
voters' signatures. It, too will
appear on the 1970 election ballot
for a popular vote if successful.
This initiative would:
1. Amend the Health and
Safety Code of the California
State Constitution declaring that
"All persons have the inalienable
right to live in an environment
free of pollution and
contamination. . . The primary
responsibility for eliminating
environmental pollution rests
upon the manufacturers of
pollution-producing products and
industries which cause pollution
in their activities. The burden of
pollution control shall not be
placed upon the individual citizen
by exhorbitant profiteering,
excessive taxes or otherwise." In
other words, it will be up to those
responsible for polluting to
finance the cleaning-up projects
and not up to tax-supported
control and enforcement agencies
and not up to the people to pay
by facing higher prices on
products.
Deadline Near
The deadline for filing
petitions in Monday, Jan. 19,
1970. A petition to be signed by
Santa Clara County registered
voters is available at information
desks in all Co-op markets when
the desk is manned by the
consumer adviser or a volunteer.
Santa Clara County petition
coordinator, Mrs. Jeanne Martin
said that there is also a pressing
need for more people to take the
petitions around to gather
signatures. Extra copies of the
petitions may be picked up at the
Co-op markets.
Further information about
petitions or about the Citizens
against Air Pollution can be
obtained by contacting Mr. Peter
Giamalis, 858 Rorke Way, Palo
Alto, 321-2286. Mr. Giamalis is
Palo Alto City Coordinator for
CAAP. Caught twice to identify
yourself.
Put this in your pipe and
smoke it: Phenol Formaldehyde
Resin, Pyrolized Hydrocarbons,
calcium, magnesium and sodium
carbonates, aldehydes, organic
acid residues, etc., etc., etc.
Chances are you wouldn't inhale a
puff on this stuff any more than
you'd pack your proverbial pipe
with dried manure, had you a
choice in the matter.
The sad fact is, however, that
you have no choice, simply
because the aromas of the
above-named chemicals are
ever-present in the air we breathe
daily. And these vile pollutants
comprise only part of the list of
the daily excretions of but one
local factory. The roll call of
various types of industrial waste
contaminating our biosphere goes
far beyond the simple "carbon

monoxide" and "sulfur dioxide"
greeted by Jeanie in HAIR.
Principal antagonists in the
continuing battle over air
pollution are the Bay Area Air
Pollution Control District
(BAAPCD) and the Citizens
Against Air Pollution, Inc.
(CAAP). BAAPCD is an arm of
local government that was set up
in 1955 to establish and enforce
restrictions on the releasing of
contaminants into the atmosphere
of the Bay Area. CAAP and other
citizens' groups, however, contend
that BAAPCD is merely collecting
its nearly $2 million a year in tax
revenues and is doing nothing to
help alleviate the constantly
worsening air pollution situation.
As an example, CAAP members
cite the fact that one of
BAAPCD's criteria for
determining whether or not the
smoke spewed out by a factory is

within acceptable limitations is an
e ye b a 11 - c h a r t proceedure
developed in 1899 for estimating
the density of coal smoke by its
relative blackness. According to
this test, equipment for removing
contaminant particles is
completely adequate so long as
smoke emerges from the chimney
no darker in color than
"pigeon-grey".
Ballot Petitions
In order to strengthen existing
pollution control measures and to
insure the efficiency of
governmental pollution-control
bureaus, as well as to place some
of the responsibility for limiting
pollution on the shoulders of the
offenders themselves, CAAP is
sponsoring two petitions to have
anti-pollution measures placed on
the ballot in the upcoming 1970
elections.
Green Ballot
One, the green ballot, requires
325,178 signatures of registered
voters. If successful, the following
items will appear on the 1970
election ballot for a vote of the
people of California to change the
current statutes. It:
1. Declares that each industrial
or manufacturing plant must

record and publish a list of all
pollutants discharged within six
months after the measure is
passed and e\e r y month
thereafter. (Thus, there can no
longer be protected and concealed
pollutants as there now are,
despite the existence of the Bay
Area Air Pollution Control
District, paid to patrol pollution.)
2. Requires that upon the
request of any citizen, certain
designated law enforcement
officers must demand that
polluters reduce their pollutants
to one per cent within five years
or lace se\ere penalties.

Resin, Pyrolized Hydrocarbons,
calcium, magnesium and sodium
carbonates, aldehydes, organic
acid residues, etc., etc., etc.
Chances are you wouldn't inhale a
puff on this stuff any more than
you'd pack your proverbial pipe
with dried manure, had you a
choice in the matter.
The sad fact is, however, that
you have no choice, simply
because the aromas of the
above-named chemicals are
ever-present in the air we breathe
daily. And these vile pollutants
comprise only part of the list of
the daily excretions of but one
local factory. The roll call of
various types of industrial waste
contaminating our biosphere goes
far beyond the simple "carbon

monoxide" and "sulfur dioxide"
greeted by Jeanie in HAIR.
Principal antagonists in the
continuing battle over air
pollution are the Bay Area Air
Pollution Control District
(BAAPCD) and the Citizens
Against Air Pollution, Inc.
(CAAP). BAAPCD is an arm of
local government that was set up
in 1955 to establish and enforce
restrictions on the releasing of
contaminants into the atmosphere
of the Bay Area. CAAP and other
citizens' groups, however, contend
that BAAPCD is merely collecting
its nearly $2 million a year in tax
revenues and is doing nothing to
help alleviate the constantly
worsening air pollution situation.
As an example, CAAP members
cite the fact that one of
BAAPCD's criteria for
determining whether or not the
smoke spewed out by a factory is

within acceptable limitations is an
e ye b a 11 - c h a r t proceedure
developed in 1899 for estimating
the density of coal smoke by its
relative blackness. According to
this test, equipment for removing
contaminant particles is
completely adequate so long as
smoke emerges from the chimney
no darker in color than
"pigeon-grey".
Ballot Petitions
In order to strengthen existing
pollution control measures and to
insure the efficiency of
governmental pollution-control
bureaus, as well as to place some
of the responsibility for limiting
pollution on the shoulders of the
offenders themselves, CAAP is
sponsoring two petitions to have
anti-pollution measures placed on
the ballot in the upcoming 1970
elections.
Green Ballot
One, the green ballot, requires
325,178 signatures of registered
voters. If successful, the following
items will appear on the 1970
election ballot for a vote of the
people of California to change the
current statutes. It:
1. Declares that each industrial
or manufacturing plant must

record and publish a list of all
pollutants discharged within six
months after the measure is
passed and e\e r y month
thereafter. (Thus, there can no
longer be protected and concealed
pollutants as there now are,
despite the existence of the Bay
Area Air Pollution Control
District, paid to patrol pollution.)
2. Requires that upon the
request of any citizen, certain
designated law enforcement
officers must demand that
polluters reduce their pollutants
to one per cent within five years
or lace se\ere penalties.
3. Provides that 1972 or later
model petroleum-powered motor
vehicles and other specified
vehicles, must have anti-pollution
devices which meet prescribed
standards.
4. In order to assure the
enforcement of this initiative,
once passed, included in the
wording is a provision for
state-financed sources to monitor
the polluters. Otherwise the
measure could conceivably be set
aside for lack of allocated funds
by sources opposed to this effort
to end the pollution of our
California environment. The

amount necessary for such
monitoring is far less than that
involved in cleaning up pollution
devastation. For example, in the
Lansing and Detroit, Michigan
areas, tax-payers are obliged to
provide some $115 million to
clean up a portion of polluted
Lake Erie.
\\ hite Petition
The white petition requires
5 2 0,276 registered California
voters' signatures. It, too will
appear on the 1970 election ballot
for a popular vote if successful.
This initiative would:
1. Amend the Health and
Safety Code of the California
State Constitution declaring that
"All persons have the inalienable
right to live in an environment
free of pollution and
contamination. . . The primary
responsibility for eliminating
environmental pollution rests
upon the manufacturers of
pollution-producing products and
industries which cause pollution
in their activities. The burden of
pollution control shall not be
placed upon the individual citizen
by exhorbitant profiteering,
excessive taxes or otherwise." In
other words, it will be up to those
responsible for polluting to
finance the cleaning-up projects
and not up to tax-supported
control and enforcement agencies
and not up to the people to pay
by facing higher prices on
products.
Deadline Near
The deadline for filing
petitions in Monday, Jan. 19,
1970. A petition to be signed by
Santa Clara County registered
voters is available at information
desks in all Co-op markets when
the desk is manned by the
consumer adviser or a volunteer.
Santa Clara County petition
coordinator, Mrs. Jeanne Martin
said that there is also a pressing
need for more people to take the
petitions around to gather
signatures. Extra copies of the
petitions may be picked up at the
Co-op markets.
Further information about
petitions or about the Citizens
against Air Pollution can be
obtained by contacting Mr. Peter
Giamalis, 858 Rorke Way, Palo
Alto, 321-2286. Mr. Giamalis is
Palo Alto City Coordinator for
CAAP. Caught twice to identify
