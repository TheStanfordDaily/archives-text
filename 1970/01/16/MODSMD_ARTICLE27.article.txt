# Lawyers Term Suit 'Fatally Defective'
## 
### 
University lawyers replied last
week to the suit to stop the
development of Coyote Hill,
saying that the suit was "fatally
defective."
The suit is intended only to
prevent construction of
improvements on Coyote Hill and
has already caused Stanford, the
city, and city officials serious
difficulties.
The suit challenged the way in
which Stanford gained city
approval to divide 175 acres
around the hill for leasing. It
contended that when the
University applied to divide the
property into four parcels it
intended to later subdivide the
property into other parcels.
If the Committee (For Green
Foothills) is right, the whole
statutory scheme of simplified
approval procedures for certain
types of divisions is ineffective.
Any redivision would call every
original division into question.
The key point that Stanford
contends is that the city and the
city officials operated throughout
in accordance with the applicable

law, and Stanford applied for, and
the City granted, approvals in
accordance with the Act and
Ordinances.
Stanford denies that Frank
Gallagher, a Stanford employee,
and Mr. Wheatley, a contractor
expecting to bid on Coyote Hill
projects, were in conflict of
interest. Before voting on
September 8, in favor of Stanford
land development plans, they
both disclosed their ideas on the
issue and stated that they were
advised by the City Attorney that
they were not in conflict of
interest.
Four plaintiffs - Mildred S.
Justesen, Judith Dean
Yarborough, George Cowie, and
Osman C. Fox—were never
mentioned and did not sign the
contract.
None of the individuals, nor
the Committee, shows that any of
his legal rights has been invaded.
Nor does the Committee allege
that it represents the City's
taxpayers.
This suit will be heard on
January 16 at 9 o'clock at the
North County Court House.
