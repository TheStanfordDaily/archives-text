## Consumer Groups Asked To Politicize 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Represen
tatives of the nation's major
consumer organizations were
exhorted Thursday to marshal
their resources for political
leverage to implement existing
laws and improve the quality of
the environment.
A succession of speakers,
arguing that the consumer
movement already has moved into
a new phase, urged the Consumer
Assembly to gird for a series of
tests in the nation's legislatures,
courts and streets.
"The consumer movement is at
a critical point in its history, and
we face a critical danger - the
danger that we will be fooled by
fake reform," said Bess Myerson
Grant, New York City's
commissioner for consumer
affairs.
Consumer crusader Ralph
Nader, keynote speaker for the
assembly, urged members to
commit their treasuries to the
creation of public-service law
firms to counteract Washington
lobbyists.
"The rights accorded all
citizens in our legal system have
little or no operational meaning
without remedies and lawyers to
put these remedies into practice
against the exploitation of the
consumer," he said.
MIT Riot
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)-A
band of some 200 demonstrators
smashed through a door Thursday
and seized the offices of the top
officials of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.
The group, many of them MIT

students, demanded abolition of
the MIT discipline committee and
cancellation of punishments
meted out to students who took
part in previous unruly
demonstrations.
The door to the office of MIT
President Howard W. Johnson was
broken in by four ski-masked men
using a battering ram made of two
four foot pipes welded together,
with hand holds on the sides.
Rock Speaks Out
BOSTON (AP)â€”Dr. John Rock,
codeveloper of the oral
contraceptive pill, said Thursday
he deplores critical testimony
being given to a U.S. Senate
subcommittee on dangers of the
pill.
"They wouldn't hold these
theories if they had more
association with obstetricians and
gynecologists who have been
working with women for the last
15 year."
Dr. Hugh J. Davis, of the Johns
Hopkins University School of
Medicine, told the sub-committee,
for example, that the pill might
cause cancer. Synthetic hormones
in the pill have caused breast
cancer in five species of animals,
he said, and every agent shown to
cause cancer in humans also has
been shown to cause cancer in
animale.
Careful observation of women
who have used oral contraceptives
for many years indicates that if
there is any relationship between
ingested estrogen and cancer, of
the breast or pelvic organs, it is a
favorable one and not a bad one.
