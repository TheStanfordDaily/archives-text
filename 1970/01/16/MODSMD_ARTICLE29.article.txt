# Professional Women Meet With Students
## 
### 
Not satisfied with Women's
Liberation, bridge clubs, or secret
sororities, 40 women met as a part
of the Professional Women-Youth
Committee yesterday at the
Stanford Institute for Human
Problems.
The participants introduced
themselves— a biophysicist, an
associate provost, a genetics
researcher, two graduate students
in psychology, a resident sponsor,
a freshman, a representative of
the chapel and of the YWCA.
Each spoke of the reason for
her interest in the group, and of
her position in the community.
Often interrupted by
exclamations of "Yes, I can help
you," or "I've had that
experience, too," or "I think we
should discuss that matter more
fully," the women began to
realize that they were not alone.
The meeting enabled young
women to meet with older
professional women, while serving
simultaneously as a forum in
which these professional women
could discuss how they combined
their professional and personal
lives.
"One of the problems worth
discussing," says Majorie Locoff,
group organizer and associate
researcher at the Institute, "is
how women deal with their own
concepts of femininitv > while

taking on the increased
responsibilities which accompany
jobs of a higher social status."
"There are few women models
to base one's decisions on," she
continued. "Women are just
beginning to move up into higher
economic positions, and these
women, in a sense, are pioneers.
In this position they suffer a
psycho-social strain, so their
problems are worthy of
examination, not only for
themselves, but for society at
large."
Among the announcements of
the session was that of the
Academic Senate's invitation to
various faculty members to the
Committee on the Education and
Employment of Women in the
University.
The appointments announced
were: Professor Kurt
M u e I 1 e r - Vo 11 mer, German
Department, Dean Lincoln Moses,
Dean of the Graduate Division,
Judy Fair, Chief Librarian of
Government Documents Division,
Mary Sunseri, mathematics
professor, and Abbe von Schlegell,
of public events. The three
student members remain to be
chosen.
The Professional
Women-Youth Committee is an
ad-hoc sub-group of the Women's
Forum, a central clearing house
for female activity on campus.


WHEN THE RAIN COMES—Some Stanford students just love to study in the
great outdoors, no matter what the weather. This one seems intent on his
reading despite a moderate drizzle thdtmust be soaking the Itfwer portion of his
clothing.
