Black student leaders attacked
black complacency at a rally
commemorating the birthday of
Dr. Martin Luther King. A crowd
of about fifty people, almost
entirely black, listened in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium to Dave
Edwards, Johnie Scott, Buff
Parham, Leo Bazile and Mike
Dawson discuss the meaning to
black students of Dr. King's life
and death.
Dawson, the moderator,
emphasized the controversy that
exists concerning the role of Dr.
King in the fight for black
freedom. He also spoke of the
significance of King's assasination.
"On that day,"he said, "we
realized that our lives until then
had been worthless. Since then
we've changed."
"A complacency has developed
in black America," declared Buff

Parham, Black Student Union
co-chairman. "We see colored
people on TV right up along side
honky and think we've made it.
But things haven't changed."
Parham cited the alumni pressure
being put on President Pitzer to
reverse his decision. "Those are
the same alumni who set up a
Martin Luther King memorial
fund and say they understand
how we feel about his death "
Celebration of Life
Johnie Scott, who later
participated in readings from the
works of black poets in the
Tressider Small Lounge, said none
of his poetry would be concerned
with King's death "I don't want
this thing to be morbid. Today
should be a celebration of life.
Our attitudes should be positive."
Student Senate Chairman Dave
Edwards stated that it was not
until 1966 that he decided, as a
result of Martin Luther King's
speeches against the war in
Vietnam, that Dr. King was
speaking for him.
"I realized then that the
problems of black people in
America were the problems of
poor people all over the world,
and that we had a common
enemy." Edwards concluded by
saying that Dr. King's courage and
knowledge, if not his methods,
were examples for all black people
to follow.
BSU Chairman Leo Bazile
criticized the black students who
had not come to the gathering.
"The people here are the ones
who keep the whole
merry-go-round turning" he said
"The other 200 just ride.'*
A Job to Do
Bazile reminded the audience
that the black freshmen and
graduate students on campus were
here as a result of demands
presented after the assasination of

Dr. King. "We have a job to do, if
for nobody else, then for Dr.
King," he declared. "We all have
got to be leaders."
Bazile closed the meeting
with comments on the
controversy over the Braunstein
nomination to the Board of
Trustees. "Let this be a lesson to
you," he said, "on how people
play games to make you think
you have power. Everytime you
read the word 'student' substitute
'nigger' and each time you read
'Pitzer' substitute 'white man' and
you'll know how this applies to
you."
