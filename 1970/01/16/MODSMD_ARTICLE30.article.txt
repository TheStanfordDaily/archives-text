# U.S. Pollution Meetings Set
## 
### 
A day of ecological concern for
the baby birds and gentle breezes
of spring is being planned for
April 22. Environmental teach-ins
will give students and members of
communities all across the nation
a chance to learn the facts of the
ecological crisis.
Although nationwide action is
planned for the day, each locality
will organize its own programs.
Local groups will decide the issues
upon which to focus and the
activities most appropriate.
Coordination of plans has been
undertaken by a student-run
office in Washington D.C.
Environmental Teach-in, Inc. is
entirely dependent upon
contributions for financial
support.
The broad scope of activities
suggested for April 22 indicates
the importance of allowing local
control of the day. It is hoped
that high schools, colleges, and
community groups will work
together for the greatest strength
of impact possible.
Seminars and courses on the
environment will be organized.
The role of the university in
determining ecological conditions
will be investigated. Reports on
the financial angle of pollution
control will mobilize participation
of business schools.
Marches and rallies, mock
funerals for the internal
combustion engine,
Environmental Inventory Tours of
local offenders, and bicycle
parades will show the energetic
concern of those involved in the
protest.
Environmental fairs on April
22 will have exhibits of local
water, dead fish and other victims
of pollution to dramatize the
danger. Possibly, these will lead to
more permanent environmental
centers in many communities.
