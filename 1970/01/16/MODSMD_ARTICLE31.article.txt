# Prison Reform...
## Another View 
### DOUG SORENSEN 
The Stanford Repertory
Theater is currently presenting the
Barbwire theatre production of
Rick Cluchey's "The Cage," a
portrayal of the fear and despair
of four prison cellmates. Similar
dramas have been performed, but
"The Cage" is unique in that its
writer, director and cast are
themselves ex-convicts.
In fact, the play was first
performed in prison by the San
Quentin Drama Workshop (under
a French title and setting lest the
authorities be offended at the
implication that such scenes might
take place at their institution.)
But as the recent execution of
three Soledad inmates for the
infraction of "fist fighting"
indicates, the play does not
exaggerate. It offers a rare
opportunity for the Stanford
community to see it like it is.
After each performance the
cast returns to the stage to
"confront" the audience, as they
put it. They discuss prison reform
and answer questions from the
audience. Many of the playgoers
seemed to feel that prisons were
an admitted evil, but one
necessary for their security. But
their security would be enhanced
only if prisons kept their inmates
for life or taught them not to
commit crimes when released.
They do neither.
If proof is required of the
monumental failure of our
"correctional institutions" it lies
in the simple statistic of the
national recidivism rate of 80%.
That means that eight of every ten
men released from prison will
eventually return there. The
system does not correct.
Nor are the necessary
improvements so difficult to

concieve. Expert penologists have
been making the same suggestions
for years. Tear down the bars and
the walls, allow the individual to
leave the institution during ihe
day to hold a job, provide
adaquate phychiatrist per 5000
inmates in maximum security
institutions), allow conjugal visits
or weekend furloughs so that the
men can maintain normal sexual
relationships, provide extensive

follow-up support after release. In
general, attempt to integrate the
individual back into the
community instead of isolating
him from it; build up his self
respect instead of destroying it.
These concepts are not based
upon mere speculation. They have
been successfully implemented in
several other countries. For
example, a Danish institution for
treatment of "chronic criminals,"

i.e., those with three or more
convictions which has been
operating on these principles for
over a decade has reduced its
recidivism rate to 10%.
The research has been done.
The means for change are
available. What is lacking seems to
be the will. We are apparently a
nation which would ratner expend
its resources reaching the moon or
killing Asians than providing
necessary treatment for its own
citizens.
Who is in prison? A 1966
report by SRI to the President's
Commission on Crime in the
District of Columbia is illustrative.
Ninety percent had annual
incomes of less than $5000; their
median age was 29.2 and
approximately three fourths were
between 18 and 34 years; 80%
had a prior adult criminal record;
78% were black.
Compare this with the famous
General Electric price fixing case.
The illegal sales totaled $1.75
billion per year. The result was 24
suspended sentences and seven
sentences of 30 days. These have
been the only anti-trust prison
sentences in the last decade.

The point is this. In a society
which relies for its primary source
of individual motivation on the
profit motive some men will
violate the rules of the game in
the pursuit of wealth. Some of
these violations are available only
to the rich. These include restraint
of trade, misrepresentation in
advertising, infringements of
patents and copyrights, violations
of wage regulations, industrial
espionage, padding of expense
accounts, prohibited forms of
monopoly, mislabeling products
and the dilution or adulteration of
products. Society deals with these
violations through a variety of
regulatory agencies, cease and
desist orders and court
injunctions. It extremely rarely
sends the offenders to jail.
On the other hand, some types
of criminal activity are available
primarily to the poor. These
include robbery, burglarly, auto
theft and petty gambling. As long
as it is only this latter category of
"criminals" who fill our prisons, it
is doubtful that the middle class
will ever get very excited about
prison reform. They don't need
to.

of four prison cellmates. Similar
dramas have been performed, but
"The Cage" is unique in that its
writer, director and cast are
themselves ex-convicts.
In fact, the play was first
performed in prison by the San
Quentin Drama Workshop (under
a French title and setting lest the
authorities be offended at the
implication that such scenes might
take place at their institution.)
But as the recent execution of
three Soledad inmates for the
infraction of "fist fighting"
indicates, the play does not
exaggerate. It offers a rare
opportunity for the Stanford
community to see it like it is.
After each performance the
cast returns to the stage to
"confront" the audience, as they
put it. They discuss prison reform
and answer questions from the
audience. Many of the playgoers
seemed to feel that prisons were
an admitted evil, but one
necessary for their security. But
their security would be enhanced
only if prisons kept their inmates
for life or taught them not to
commit crimes when released.
They do neither.
If proof is required of the
monumental failure of our
"correctional institutions" it lies
in the simple statistic of the
national recidivism rate of 80%.
That means that eight of every ten
men released from prison will
eventually return there. The
system does not correct.
Nor are the necessary
improvements so difficult to

concieve. Expert penologists have
been making the same suggestions
for years. Tear down the bars and
the walls, allow the individual to
leave the institution during ihe
day to hold a job, provide
adaquate phychiatrist per 5000
inmates in maximum security
institutions), allow conjugal visits
or weekend furloughs so that the
men can maintain normal sexual
relationships, provide extensive

follow-up support after release. In
general, attempt to integrate the
individual back into the
community instead of isolating
him from it; build up his self
respect instead of destroying it.
These concepts are not based
upon mere speculation. They have
been successfully implemented in
several other countries. For
example, a Danish institution for
treatment of "chronic criminals,"

i.e., those with three or more
convictions which has been
operating on these principles for
over a decade has reduced its
recidivism rate to 10%.
The research has been done.
The means for change are
available. What is lacking seems to
be the will. We are apparently a
nation which would ratner expend
its resources reaching the moon or
killing Asians than providing
necessary treatment for its own
citizens.
Who is in prison? A 1966
report by SRI to the President's
Commission on Crime in the
District of Columbia is illustrative.
Ninety percent had annual
incomes of less than $5000; their
median age was 29.2 and
approximately three fourths were
between 18 and 34 years; 80%
had a prior adult criminal record;
78% were black.
Compare this with the famous
General Electric price fixing case.
The illegal sales totaled $1.75
billion per year. The result was 24
suspended sentences and seven
sentences of 30 days. These have
been the only anti-trust prison
sentences in the last decade.

The point is this. In a society
which relies for its primary source
of individual motivation on the
profit motive some men will
violate the rules of the game in
the pursuit of wealth. Some of
these violations are available only
to the rich. These include restraint
of trade, misrepresentation in
advertising, infringements of
patents and copyrights, violations
of wage regulations, industrial
espionage, padding of expense
accounts, prohibited forms of
monopoly, mislabeling products
and the dilution or adulteration of
products. Society deals with these
violations through a variety of
regulatory agencies, cease and
desist orders and court
injunctions. It extremely rarely
sends the offenders to jail.
On the other hand, some types
of criminal activity are available
primarily to the poor. These
include robbery, burglarly, auto
theft and petty gambling. As long
as it is only this latter category of
"criminals" who fill our prisons, it
is doubtful that the middle class
will ever get very excited about
prison reform. They don't need
to.
