# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Erica Morini Impressive In SF Solo 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
You can usually tell the music
appreciators from the
symphony-goers at concerts. They
arrive on time, wait for the house
lights before leaving, read the
program notes, and know not to
applaud between movements. But
Wednesday night at the San
Francisco Symphony, patrons
who understood the Beethoven
"Violin Concerto" joined in
strong applause at the end of its
first movement, in recognition of
the fantastic cadenza played by
Miss Erica Morini, the soloist.
Following the custom of his
day, Beethoven composed his
"Violin Concerto" with a place
for a cadenza near the end of each
of the three movements, but did
not write the cadenzas himself. It
was thought that the performer
should have an opportunity to
express his own feelings about the
work, and to show his dexterity in
developing the themes on his own.
Joachim Premiere
It was for Joachim, the greatest
violinist of his time, that
Beethoven designed this concerto,
and Joachim's cadenzas were
transcribed later. It was these
original Joachim cadenzas, with a
contemporary and feminine touch
added, that Miss Morini played
Wednesday evening, and they
were an astounding success.

Most well-known concert
violinists are men, so the
Beethoven "Violin Concerto",
considered the touchstone of
concert violin pieces, is usually
heard in a strong, masculine
interpretation, with heavy,
forceful cadenzas. Miss Morini,
who told me she began playing
these cadenzas about five years
ago, performed with a graceful,
singing tone, light and delicate
bowing. Some of her low notes
were lost in the vastness of the
Opera House, but her fluid,
romantic treatment of the
concerto more than compensated
for this.
Metronome in the Panharmonium
Beethoven's "Symphony No.
8" preceeded the "Concerto" on
the program, and was well-played
by the Symphony. Many people
mistakenly assume that since
Beethoven was often gruff and
grouchy, and since much of his
music is so tempestuous, that the
man was incapable of humor. The
"Eighth Symphony," and the
story behind it, disconfirm this
hypothesis, for it is a

tongue-in-cheek musical game full
of little pauses and surprises.
The work grew out of its
second movement, which imitates
the playful combination of
musical gadgets called the
panharmonium invented by
Beethoven's friend Malzel. It
contained an early metronome;
the tick-tick-tick is in the
woodwinds, while the rest of
"instrument" is represented in the
strings. It is a light-hearted
symphony, an unexpected
precursor to the stormy and
passionate Ninth Symphony. With
an asute conductor and a versatile
orchestra, the "Symphony No. 8"
can be the success it was in
Beethoven's time, with lightness
and humor, as it was Wednesday
evening.
New Walton Work
The opening piece of the
evening was a new work in World
Premiere by Sir William Walton,
commissioned by Dr. Ralph
Dorfman of San Francisco.
Entitled "Improvisations on an
Impromptu of Benjamin Britten,"
it contains a set of five variations
on a theme, each one expressing a

different emotion, from elegeic to
threatening. It was a particularly
effective performance of one of
the world's finest living
composers.
This splendid concert program
will be presented again at 8:30
P.M. in San Francisco's War
Memorial Opera House tonight
and Saturday night, with Miss
Morini the soloist. Student tickets
are available, although the
Symphony Bus runs only on
Wednesday night. This is the
finest program the Symphony has
presented in some time, and
should not be missed.
Opening Night Repeat
For those who missed its
opening concert, the Symphony
will repeat that All-Beethoven
program consisting of the
"Egmont Overture," "Symphony
No. 2" and "Symphony No. 5."
The concert will be held January
24 at Foothill College in Los
Altos at 8:15 P.M. Tickets can be
purchased at the Palo Alto Box
Office in Town and Country
Village, or from the Los Altos
Committee of the Symphony,
P.O. Box 806, Los Altos.

8" preceeded the "Concerto" on
the program, and was well-played
by the Symphony. Many people
mistakenly assume that since
Beethoven was often gruff and
grouchy, and since much of his
music is so tempestuous, that the
man was incapable of humor. The
"Eighth Symphony," and the
story behind it, disconfirm this
hypothesis, for it is a

tongue-in-cheek musical game full
of little pauses and surprises.
The work grew out of its
second movement, which imitates
the playful combination of
musical gadgets called the
panharmonium invented by
Beethoven's friend Malzel. It
contained an early metronome;
the tick-tick-tick is in the
woodwinds, while the rest of
"instrument" is represented in the
strings. It is a light-hearted
symphony, an unexpected
precursor to the stormy and
passionate Ninth Symphony. With
an asute conductor and a versatile
orchestra, the "Symphony No. 8"
can be the success it was in
Beethoven's time, with lightness
and humor, as it was Wednesday
evening.
New Walton Work
The opening piece of the
evening was a new work in World
Premiere by Sir William Walton,
commissioned by Dr. Ralph
Dorfman of San Francisco.
Entitled "Improvisations on an
Impromptu of Benjamin Britten,"
it contains a set of five variations
on a theme, each one expressing a

different emotion, from elegeic to
threatening. It was a particularly
effective performance of one of
the world's finest living
composers.
This splendid concert program
will be presented again at 8:30
P.M. in San Francisco's War
Memorial Opera House tonight
and Saturday night, with Miss
Morini the soloist. Student tickets
are available, although the
Symphony Bus runs only on
Wednesday night. This is the
finest program the Symphony has
presented in some time, and
should not be missed.
Opening Night Repeat
For those who missed its
opening concert, the Symphony
will repeat that All-Beethoven
program consisting of the
"Egmont Overture," "Symphony
No. 2" and "Symphony No. 5."
The concert will be held January
24 at Foothill College in Los
Altos at 8:15 P.M. Tickets can be
purchased at the Palo Alto Box
Office in Town and Country
Village, or from the Los Altos
Committee of the Symphony,
P.O. Box 806, Los Altos.
You can usually tell the music
appreciators from the
symphony-goers at concerts. They
arrive on time, wait for the house
lights before leaving, read the
program notes, and know not to
applaud between movements. But
Wednesday night at the San
Francisco Symphony, patrons
who understood the Beethoven
"Violin Concerto" joined in
strong applause at the end of its
first movement, in recognition of
the fantastic cadenza played by
Miss Erica Morini, the soloist.
Following the custom of his
day, Beethoven composed his
"Violin Concerto" with a place
for a cadenza near the end of each
of the three movements, but did
not write the cadenzas himself. It
was thought that the performer
should have an opportunity to
express his own feelings about the
work, and to show his dexterity in
developing the themes on his own.
Joachim Premiere
It was for Joachim, the greatest
violinist of his time, that
Beethoven designed this concerto,
and Joachim's cadenzas were
transcribed later. It was these
original Joachim cadenzas, with a
contemporary and feminine touch
added, that Miss Morini played
Wednesday evening, and they
were an astounding success.

Most well-known concert
violinists are men, so the
Beethoven "Violin Concerto",
considered the touchstone of
concert violin pieces, is usually
heard in a strong, masculine
interpretation, with heavy,
forceful cadenzas. Miss Morini,
who told me she began playing
these cadenzas about five years
ago, performed with a graceful,
singing tone, light and delicate
bowing. Some of her low notes
were lost in the vastness of the
Opera House, but her fluid,
romantic treatment of the
concerto more than compensated
for this.
Metronome in the Panharmonium
Beethoven's "Symphony No.
8" preceeded the "Concerto" on
the program, and was well-played
by the Symphony. Many people
mistakenly assume that since
