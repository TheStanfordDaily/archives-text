# Parkening Outstanding
## Ranges From Bach To Sor 
### DANA GIOIA 
and CHARIE MASSION
Perhaps the only nice thing the
University of Southern California
has sent Stanford this year is
Christopher Parkening.
Parkening, a twenty-one year
old senior and teaching lecturer
on the Music Faculty of USC,
performed a concert sponsored by
the Public Events Office of
classical guitar music last Friday
in Memorial Hall to an audience
of over 1,000 people.
Beginning his second national
tour this season, Parkening began
studying guitar at eleven, made his
formal debut at UCLA's Royce
Hall at fourteen, and has since
played as a guest soloist with
more than twenty California
orchestras and symphonies. His
New York debut will be at
Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall
this April.
Parkening's Stanford concert
was a comprehensive selection of
compositions from the limited
repertoire of classical works for
the guitar. Music ranged from
Elizabethan England's John
Dowland to the twentieth century
Venezuelan composer Antonio
Lauro. Because of the relatively
recent, and now still partial,
acccptance of the guitar as a
classical instrument, guitarists
often feel compelled to establish
their concert programs on a
framework of traditional classical
music. Parkening was no
exception.
Leaned on Bach
Seeking to break with the
stereotype of Spanish folk music,
Parkening relied on Dowland and

J.S. Bach to justify his guitar as a
valid classical instrument.
"Galliard" and "Fantasie," the
works by Dowland certainly have
a place in the background of any
classical guitarist, but both
seemed inconsequential when
compared with the music of Issac
Albeniz and Fernado Sor, which
Parkening performed later in the
evening.
Three of the four pieces by J.S.
Bach that Parkening played were
comparable in programming to
the Dowland. However,
"Gavotte," Sonata VI for
unaccompanied violin, was
extraordinary. In this light, quick
piece with running rhythms, the
musical content definitely
complimented the musical media.
Latin Tradition
Despite transcriptions and
infrequent exceptions, both the
guitar's and Parkening's repetoire
centers in the Spanish and Latin
tradition. Most of the music
totally suitable to the guitar stems
from cultures with the greatest
aesthetic and technical
understanding of the instrument.
Friday's audience sensed the
difference between the works
performed for formal artistic
justification and those which were
justified completely by
Parkening's fingers on the strings.
Polite applause followed the
recital of transcriptions of Bach
and Dowland, ecstatic clapping,
shouts and bravos overflowed
after compositions by Albeniz and
Sor, and the Spanish folk songs.
Our undoubted favorite was
the performance of "Austurias"
(Suite Espanole) written by the

late nineteenth century composer
Albeniz. Everything vibrant
associated with Spain was present
in this piece. Parkening executed
this with remarkable flair,
controlling the subtle shadowing
well.
Shows Other Side
"Alhambra," in contrast,
revealed a different facet of
Spanish music. In this gentle
piece, Parkening demonstrated his
mastery of the difficult technique
of vibrato. The next piece,
"Variations on a Theme by
Mozart" by Sor, revealed
Parkening's technical brilliance
without falling into the cliches of
virtuosity.
Concluding the concert with
three traditional Spanish folk
songs, arranged with resounding
Latin bravura, Parkening gave the
audience exactly what it came
for —exciting musical
showmanship. The response to his
final number was so
overwhelmingly enthusiastic that
he repeated it as an encore. Then
despite pleas for further encores,
he left.
The only major criticism that
can be levelled on this otherwise
excellent concert was that
Parkening lacked stage presence.
It would not be expected that so
young a performer would be so
completely shackled by concert
protocol. He only said three
sentences during the entire
evening. Yet it may be his youth
that explains this timidity, but
such small personal quirks could
hardly spoil an evening of exciting
music.

and CHARIE MASSION
Perhaps the only nice thing the
University of Southern California
has sent Stanford this year is
Christopher Parkening.
Parkening, a twenty-one year
old senior and teaching lecturer
on the Music Faculty of USC,
performed a concert sponsored by
the Public Events Office of
classical guitar music last Friday
in Memorial Hall to an audience
of over 1,000 people.
Beginning his second national
tour this season, Parkening began
studying guitar at eleven, made his
formal debut at UCLA's Royce
Hall at fourteen, and has since
played as a guest soloist with
more than twenty California
orchestras and symphonies. His
New York debut will be at
Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall
this April.
Parkening's Stanford concert
was a comprehensive selection of
compositions from the limited
repertoire of classical works for
the guitar. Music ranged from
Elizabethan England's John
Dowland to the twentieth century
Venezuelan composer Antonio
Lauro. Because of the relatively
recent, and now still partial,
acccptance of the guitar as a
classical instrument, guitarists
often feel compelled to establish
their concert programs on a
framework of traditional classical
music. Parkening was no
exception.
Leaned on Bach
Seeking to break with the
stereotype of Spanish folk music,
Parkening relied on Dowland and

J.S. Bach to justify his guitar as a
valid classical instrument.
"Galliard" and "Fantasie," the
works by Dowland certainly have
a place in the background of any
classical guitarist, but both
seemed inconsequential when
compared with the music of Issac
Albeniz and Fernado Sor, which
Parkening performed later in the
evening.
Three of the four pieces by J.S.
Bach that Parkening played were
comparable in programming to
the Dowland. However,
"Gavotte," Sonata VI for
unaccompanied violin, was
extraordinary. In this light, quick
piece with running rhythms, the
musical content definitely
complimented the musical media.
Latin Tradition
Despite transcriptions and
infrequent exceptions, both the
guitar's and Parkening's repetoire
centers in the Spanish and Latin
tradition. Most of the music
totally suitable to the guitar stems
from cultures with the greatest
aesthetic and technical
understanding of the instrument.
Friday's audience sensed the
difference between the works
performed for formal artistic
justification and those which were
justified completely by
Parkening's fingers on the strings.
Polite applause followed the
recital of transcriptions of Bach
and Dowland, ecstatic clapping,
shouts and bravos overflowed
after compositions by Albeniz and
Sor, and the Spanish folk songs.
Our undoubted favorite was
the performance of "Austurias"
(Suite Espanole) written by the

late nineteenth century composer
Albeniz. Everything vibrant
associated with Spain was present
in this piece. Parkening executed
this with remarkable flair,
controlling the subtle shadowing
well.
Shows Other Side
"Alhambra," in contrast,
revealed a different facet of
Spanish music. In this gentle
piece, Parkening demonstrated his
mastery of the difficult technique
of vibrato. The next piece,
"Variations on a Theme by
Mozart" by Sor, revealed
Parkening's technical brilliance
without falling into the cliches of
virtuosity.
Concluding the concert with
three traditional Spanish folk
songs, arranged with resounding
Latin bravura, Parkening gave the
audience exactly what it came
for —exciting musical
showmanship. The response to his
final number was so
overwhelmingly enthusiastic that
he repeated it as an encore. Then
despite pleas for further encores,
he left.
