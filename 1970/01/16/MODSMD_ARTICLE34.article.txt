## Barbra's Mae, Hitchcock Just Fair 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Hello Dolly
Never have I seen $20 million
evaporate so mindlessly. At the
same time, however, Gene Kelly's
film is considerably more
tolerable than the stage version,
which has been responsible for
two of my most excruciating
theatre experiences during the
sixties. Hello Dolly seemed merely
to occupy the screen I was staring
at and only the somewhat
perverse ironies of the casting
made the screen any more
interesting to look at than the
other walls of the Century 21
Theatre.
Much has been made of the
fact that Barbra Streisand is much
younger than any other actress to
have played the obnoxious Dolly
Levi and some have posed the
question of how the vibrant Miss
Streisand could be just coming
out of mourning for her long lost
husband and not have been to
Harmonica Gardens for "years
and years" without having been
married in the area of age 10. For
me, any pleasure I received was
derived from just such
incongruities, for not only is
Barbra an intriguingly young
Dolly, but in her characterization
are to be found heavy traces of
Mae West as well as strange
mixtures of Jewish and Irish
accents.

In certain scenes Walter
Matthau comes across as W.C.
Fields to Brabra's Mae but overall
he exhibits insufficient charm as
the man Dolly dreams of marrying
(and that's to say nothing of his
singing and dancing capabilities).
Michael Crawford is fun when he's
moving around but other-wise his
British accent keeps slipping
through. However, I've never
really heard anyone talk the way
he does in the film, so my
fascination with his speech
patterns kept me awake while
Barbra wasn't on.
Since Gene Kelly either
appeared in and/or co-directed
some of the greatest movie
musicals of all time An American
in Paris, Singin' in the Rain, On
the Town, many more) one might
reasonably expect a little vitality,
originality and even some nice
nostalgia in a film by him. But no,
Hello Dolly is a thoroughly
impersonal item straight off th'
20th Century-Fox products
line with "Handle With Ca:
marked all over it. The only real
difference between this and Star!
of last year and The Sound of
Music of three years before is the
difference between Barbra
Streisand and Julie Andrews. But
because of this difference, the
kind of material that used to
endanger diabetics now only

causes a slight numbness in the
gluteus maximus. Adalen '31
Bo Widerberg is best known
I for the ultimately suffocating
beauty of Elvira Madigau. In his
new film, which reportedly boasts
. the largest budget ever for a
[ Swedish picture, the director
tackles as his subject the country's
only major labor strike in which
several people were killed back in
1931.

The film's finale, with the
town of Adalen's peaceful
demonstrators marching in the
face of flying bullets in what
seems a disturbing combination of
self-sacrifice (if not suicide) and
inexcusable government massacre
of citizens, manages to create
substantial sympathy for both the
character and the film. However,
the ending stands alone,
unsupported by very much that
has preceded it. What remains is
a pastiche of Swedish life at the
lime, nicely photographed but
basically just fitfully interesting.
Several sequences stand out as
notably funny and poignant.
Strongest in my memory is a
scene in which some young
Swedish boys listen to records of
American Negro jazz of the time
and try to imitate it on make-shift
instruments. Ultimately,
Widerberg can be commended for
his feeling for life but he needs to
develop a sense of drama before
he can hope to meaningfully
relate a story as well as images.
Topaz
I think of myself as a dedicated
admirer of Alfred Hitchcock but
not even the AUTEUR theory can
save his latest picture. I don't
want to make any premature

generalizations about what is
happening to the master's talent
(some critics have claimed that
he's lost his "touch")—let's just
say that he's made some mediocre
films before (Suspicion and To
Catch a Tliiel in the '40's and
'50's respectively) and that Topaz
is the least distinguished of his
'60's efforts.
Much of the film unfolds much
as a Man From I'NCLE episode
and at that, Robert Vaughn and
David McCallum are infinitely
more appealing personalities than
Frederick Stafford and John
Forsythe. However, the rest of the
cast, from Michel Piccoli to
Philippe Noiret to John Verson
and, especially, to Roscoe Lee
Brown, is most engaging.
Strangely, Hitchcock's direction
seems to visibly improve when he
is working with these expert
actors and not with the bland
Stafford.
Indeed, two sequences stand
favorable comparison with
anything Hitchcock has done. The
entire "hotel" sequence with
Roscoe Lee Brown is the
director's best work since the
birds attacked Bodega Bay back in
1963 and a luncheon of political
intrigue is framed and cut to tense
perfection. But the ending is an
example of montage at its worst
and, along with most of the film,
is disappointing coming from the
hand of Hitchcock.

Frederick Stafford and John
Forsythe. However, the rest of the
cast, from Michel Piccoli to
Philippe Noiret to John Verson
and, especially, to Roscoe Lee
Brown, is most engaging.
Strangely, Hitchcock's direction
seems to visibly improve when he
is working with these expert
actors and not with the bland
Stafford.
Indeed, two sequences stand
favorable comparison with
anything Hitchcock has done. The
entire "hotel" sequence with
Roscoe Lee Brown is the
director's best work since the
birds attacked Bodega Bay back in
1963 and a luncheon of political
intrigue is framed and cut to tense
perfection. But the ending is an
example of montage at its worst
and, along with most of the film,
is disappointing coming from the
hand of Hitchcock.


ODD COUPLE—Louis Armstrong welcomes Barbra Streisand back where slit
belongs in HELLO DOLLY, Gene Kelly 's screen version oi' the Broadway hit.
Hello Dolly
Never have I seen $20 million
evaporate so mindlessly. At the
same time, however, Gene Kelly's
film is considerably more
tolerable than the stage version,
which has been responsible for
two of my most excruciating
theatre experiences during the
sixties. Hello Dolly seemed merely
to occupy the screen I was staring
at and only the somewhat
perverse ironies of the casting
made the screen any more
interesting to look at than the
other walls of the Century 21
Theatre.
Much has been made of the
fact that Barbra Streisand is much
younger than any other actress to
have played the obnoxious Dolly
Levi and some have posed the
question of how the vibrant Miss
Streisand could be just coming
out of mourning for her long lost
husband and not have been to
Harmonica Gardens for "years
and years" without having been
married in the area of age 10. For
me, any pleasure I received was
derived from just such
incongruities, for not only is
Barbra an intriguingly young
Dolly, but in her characterization
are to be found heavy traces of
Mae West as well as strange
mixtures of Jewish and Irish
accents.

In certain scenes Walter
Matthau comes across as W.C.
Fields to Brabra's Mae but overall
he exhibits insufficient charm as
the man Dolly dreams of marrying
(and that's to say nothing of his
singing and dancing capabilities).
Michael Crawford is fun when he's
moving around but other-wise his
British accent keeps slipping
through. However, I've never
really heard anyone talk the way
he does in the film, so my
fascination with his speech
patterns kept me awake while
Barbra wasn't on.
Since Gene Kelly either
appeared in and/or co-directed
some of the greatest movie
musicals of all time An American
in Paris, Singin' in the Rain, On
the Town, many more) one might
reasonably expect a little vitality,
originality and even some nice
nostalgia in a film by him. But no,
Hello Dolly is a thoroughly
impersonal item straight off th'
20th Century-Fox products
line with "Handle With Ca:
marked all over it. The only real
difference between this and Star!
of last year and The Sound of
Music of three years before is the
difference between Barbra
Streisand and Julie Andrews. But
because of this difference, the
kind of material that used to
endanger diabetics now only

causes a slight numbness in the
gluteus maximus. Adalen '31
Bo Widerberg is best known
I for the ultimately suffocating
beauty of Elvira Madigau. In his
new film, which reportedly boasts
. the largest budget ever for a
[ Swedish picture, the director
tackles as his subject the country's
only major labor strike in which
several people were killed back in
1931.

The film's finale, with the
town of Adalen's peaceful
demonstrators marching in the
face of flying bullets in what
seems a disturbing combination of
self-sacrifice (if not suicide) and
inexcusable government massacre
of citizens, manages to create
substantial sympathy for both the
character and the film. However,
the ending stands alone,
unsupported by very much that
has preceded it. What remains is
a pastiche of Swedish life at the
lime, nicely photographed but
basically just fitfully interesting.
Several sequences stand out as
notably funny and poignant.
Strongest in my memory is a
scene in which some young
Swedish boys listen to records of
American Negro jazz of the time
and try to imitate it on make-shift
instruments. Ultimately,
Widerberg can be commended for
his feeling for life but he needs to
develop a sense of drama before
he can hope to meaningfully
relate a story as well as images.
Topaz
I think of myself as a dedicated
admirer of Alfred Hitchcock but
not even the AUTEUR theory can
save his latest picture. I don't
want to make any premature

generalizations about what is
happening to the master's talent
(some critics have claimed that
he's lost his "touch")—let's just
say that he's made some mediocre
films before (Suspicion and To
Catch a Tliiel in the '40's and
'50's respectively) and that Topaz
is the least distinguished of his
'60's efforts.
Much of the film unfolds much
as a Man From I'NCLE episode
and at that, Robert Vaughn and
David McCallum are infinitely
more appealing personalities than
Frederick Stafford and John
Forsythe. However, the rest of the
cast, from Michel Piccoli to

his feeling for life but he needs to
develop a sense of drama before
he can hope to meaningfully
relate a story as well as images.
Topaz
I think of myself as a dedicated
admirer of Alfred Hitchcock but
not even the AUTEUR theory can
save his latest picture. I don't
want to make any premature

generalizations about what is
happening to the master's talent
(some critics have claimed that
he's lost his "touch")—let's just
say that he's made some mediocre
films before (Suspicion and To
Catch a Tliiel in the '40's and
'50's respectively) and that Topaz
is the least distinguished of his
'60's efforts.
Much of the film unfolds much
as a Man From I'NCLE episode
and at that, Robert Vaughn and
David McCallum are infinitely
more appealing personalities than
Frederick Stafford and John
Forsythe. However, the rest of the
cast, from Michel Piccoli to
Philippe Noiret to John Verson
and, especially, to Roscoe Lee
Brown, is most engaging.
Strangely, Hitchcock's direction
seems to visibly improve when he
is working with these expert
actors and not with the bland
Stafford.
Indeed, two sequences stand
favorable comparison with
anything Hitchcock has done. The
entire "hotel" sequence with
Roscoe Lee Brown is the
director's best work since the
birds attacked Bodega Bay back in
1963 and a luncheon of political
intrigue is framed and cut to tense
perfection. But the ending is an
example of montage at its worst
and, along with most of the film,
is disappointing coming from the
hand of Hitchcock.


ODD COUPLE—Louis Armstrong welcomes Barbra Streisand back where slit
belongs in HELLO DOLLY, Gene Kelly 's screen version oi' the Broadway hit.
Hello Dolly
Never have I seen $20 million
evaporate so mindlessly. At the
same time, however, Gene Kelly's
film is considerably more
tolerable than the stage version,
which has been responsible for
two of my most excruciating
theatre experiences during the
sixties. Hello Dolly seemed merely
to occupy the screen I was staring
at and only the somewhat
perverse ironies of the casting
made the screen any more
interesting to look at than the
other walls of the Century 21
Theatre.
Much has been made of the
fact that Barbra Streisand is much
younger than any other actress to
have played the obnoxious Dolly
Levi and some have posed the
question of how the vibrant Miss
Streisand could be just coming
out of mourning for her long lost
husband and not have been to
Harmonica Gardens for "years
and years" without having been
married in the area of age 10. For
me, any pleasure I received was
derived from just such
incongruities, for not only is
Barbra an intriguingly young
Dolly, but in her characterization
are to be found heavy traces of
Mae West as well as strange
mixtures of Jewish and Irish
accents.

In certain scenes Walter
Matthau comes across as W.C.
Fields to Brabra's Mae but overall
he exhibits insufficient charm as
the man Dolly dreams of marrying
(and that's to say nothing of his
singing and dancing capabilities).
Michael Crawford is fun when he's
moving around but other-wise his
British accent keeps slipping
through. However, I've never
really heard anyone talk the way
he does in the film, so my
fascination with his speech
patterns kept me awake while
Barbra wasn't on.
Since Gene Kelly either
appeared in and/or co-directed
some of the greatest movie
musicals of all time An American
in Paris, Singin' in the Rain, On
the Town, many more) one might
reasonably expect a little vitality,
originality and even some nice
nostalgia in a film by him. But no,
Hello Dolly is a thoroughly
impersonal item straight off th'
20th Century-Fox products
line with "Handle With Ca:
marked all over it. The only real
difference between this and Star!
of last year and The Sound of
Music of three years before is the
difference between Barbra
Streisand and Julie Andrews. But
because of this difference, the
kind of material that used to
endanger diabetics now only

causes a slight numbness in the
gluteus maximus. Adalen '31
Bo Widerberg is best known
I for the ultimately suffocating
beauty of Elvira Madigau. In his
new film, which reportedly boasts
. the largest budget ever for a
[ Swedish picture, the director
tackles as his subject the country's
only major labor strike in which
several people were killed back in
1931.

The film's finale, with the
town of Adalen's peaceful
demonstrators marching in the
face of flying bullets in what
seems a disturbing combination of
self-sacrifice (if not suicide) and
inexcusable government massacre
of citizens, manages to create
substantial sympathy for both the
character and the film. However,
the ending stands alone,
unsupported by very much that
has preceded it. What remains is
a pastiche of Swedish life at the
lime, nicely photographed but
basically just fitfully interesting.
Several sequences stand out as
notably funny and poignant.
Strongest in my memory is a
scene in which some young
Swedish boys listen to records of
American Negro jazz of the time
and try to imitate it on make-shift
instruments. Ultimately,
Widerberg can be commended for
his feeling for life but he needs to
develop a sense of drama before
he can hope to meaningfully
relate a story as well as images.
