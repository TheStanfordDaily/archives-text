# For What It's Worth
## Kinks Release Story Album 
### COREY GOODMAN 
Rock music made its invasion
from England in the fall of 1963
and on into 1964. Since then,
most of the early groups have had
their couple of bit hits and have
split up. But two groups of the
first wave, The Beatles and
Stones, are still together, just as
some of the later ones- The
Moody Blues and The Who. And
The Kinks, finishing a U.S. tour in
December and releasing Arthur,
have also made a strong return
from those early days.
F rom each of these five
established English groups has
come some of the best song
writing talent around-Lennon and
McCartney, Jagger and Richards,
Peter Townshend, Redwave and
Knight, and Ray Davies. And now
with the addition of Arthur, each
has tried their hand at creating a
story album, a composition that
tries to go beyond the ordinary
pop music that they themselves
had created.
From Sergeant to Majesties
First came Sgt. Pepper, saying
goodbye to the simple boy/girl
love song Beatles and bringing in
the message, "I'd love to turn you
on." But not letting themselves
get upstaged, The Stones departed
from their continued success and
tried to produce Sgt. Pepper 11, or
Their Satanic Majesties Request.
The album design was as different
as Sgt. Pepper had been, and there
were some good songs inside. But
it just wasn't The Stones- the bad
boys giving up sex and violence
and going mystic, when Jagger
and Richards were their best at
dirty rock. And so they dropped
out until they got back to their
music with Beggar's Banquet.

Out of isolation came The
Moody Blues with their rock
symphony, Days of Future
Passed. It had some good songs,
some fine arranging, but had a bit
too much orchestration as a
novelty to make good rock.
'Tommy' Stands Alone
Then The Who, coming a long
way from "My Generation" or
even "Pictures of Lily," released
Townshend's masterpiece,

Tommy. It is the rock opera to go
down in history as probably the
best album in '69 and when
performed on stage, one of the
most moving experiences.
Tommy, its music and message, is
all alone, and being worthless to
try to better it, The Kinks didn't
try.

Ray Davies, taking time off
from handing poison cookies out
to crippled children, created
Arthur, rock's musical telling
England her old glorious days are
over. Its not a response to any
other group's music or style, but
pure Kinks. Now that it has been
out for more than a month, its
easier to look at it as it takes its
place in music.
Style is Rough
The Kinks music is as rough as
their conduct, and somehow all
the roughness in Ray's flat voice
and the other rough edges balance
out to add to the drive of Ray's
words and music. The songs start
with a mood, a part of the story,
but each one ends with the
satisfying Kinks' hard rock drive,
the same feeling you get from
"You Really Got Me," except
with equally driving words this
time around.
"Victoria" starts the album out
with Davies screaming "long ago
life was clean, sex was bad and
obscene." Two good songs later,
after a look at the army
("permission to speak Sir,
permission to breathe Sir"),
Arthur leaves the troubled world
and goes for a picnic, but as the
instruments yell "you're
brainwashed, yes you are, yes you
are." So at the end, Arthur is
blind, but The Kinks offer old
England a hand, "we love you and
want to help you."
Arthur isn't a serious
masterpiece, and I can't say that I
like it as much as Sgt. Pepper or
Tommy, but it is good fun music
knocking England, and a good
sample of one direction the early
English rock invaders have taken.

want to help you."
Arthur isn't a serious
masterpiece, and I can't say that I
like it as much as Sgt. Pepper or
Tommy, but it is good fun music
knocking England, and a good
sample of one direction the early
English rock invaders have taken.


THE KINKS
Rock music made its invasion
from England in the fall of 1963
and on into 1964. Since then,
most of the early groups have had
their couple of bit hits and have
split up. But two groups of the
first wave, The Beatles and
Stones, are still together, just as
some of the later ones- The
Moody Blues and The Who. And
The Kinks, finishing a U.S. tour in
December and releasing Arthur,
have also made a strong return
from those early days.
F rom each of these five
established English groups has
come some of the best song
writing talent around-Lennon and
McCartney, Jagger and Richards,
Peter Townshend, Redwave and
Knight, and Ray Davies. And now
with the addition of Arthur, each
has tried their hand at creating a
story album, a composition that
tries to go beyond the ordinary
pop music that they themselves
had created.
From Sergeant to Majesties
First came Sgt. Pepper, saying
goodbye to the simple boy/girl
love song Beatles and bringing in
the message, "I'd love to turn you
on." But not letting themselves
get upstaged, The Stones departed
from their continued success and
tried to produce Sgt. Pepper 11, or
Their Satanic Majesties Request.
The album design was as different
as Sgt. Pepper had been, and there
were some good songs inside. But
it just wasn't The Stones- the bad
boys giving up sex and violence
and going mystic, when Jagger
and Richards were their best at
dirty rock. And so they dropped
out until they got back to their
music with Beggar's Banquet.

Out of isolation came The
Moody Blues with their rock
symphony, Days of Future
Passed. It had some good songs,
some fine arranging, but had a bit
too much orchestration as a
novelty to make good rock.
'Tommy' Stands Alone
Then The Who, coming a long
way from "My Generation" or
even "Pictures of Lily," released
Townshend's masterpiece,

Tommy. It is the rock opera to go
down in history as probably the
best album in '69 and when
performed on stage, one of the
most moving experiences.
Tommy, its music and message, is
all alone, and being worthless to
try to better it, The Kinks didn't
try.

Ray Davies, taking time off
from handing poison cookies out
to crippled children, created
Arthur, rock's musical telling
England her old glorious days are
over. Its not a response to any
other group's music or style, but
pure Kinks. Now that it has been
out for more than a month, its
easier to look at it as it takes its
place in music.
Style is Rough
The Kinks music is as rough as
their conduct, and somehow all
the roughness in Ray's flat voice
and the other rough edges balance
out to add to the drive of Ray's
words and music. The songs start
with a mood, a part of the story,
but each one ends with the
satisfying Kinks' hard rock drive,
the same feeling you get from
"You Really Got Me," except
with equally driving words this
time around.
"Victoria" starts the album out
with Davies screaming "long ago
life was clean, sex was bad and
obscene." Two good songs later,
after a look at the army
("permission to speak Sir,
permission to breathe Sir"),
Arthur leaves the troubled world
and goes for a picnic, but as the
instruments yell "you're
brainwashed, yes you are, yes you
are." So at the end, Arthur is
blind, but The Kinks offer old
England a hand, "we love you and
want to help you."
Arthur isn't a serious
masterpiece, and I can't say that I
like it as much as Sgt. Pepper or
