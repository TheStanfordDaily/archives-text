## Bears Invade Maples 
### 
Coming off a pair of tough
road losses to Washington and
Washington State, Stanford's
basketball team opens its home
conference schedule tonight
against California. Stanford has a
poor 2-9 season record, but five of
the defeats have been by five
points or less.
California carries a 7-5 record
but they have explosive potential
as they showed in an 84-64
victory over Washington Monday
night.
Leading the Golden Bears is
returning all-conference guard
Charlie Johnson (6-0). As a
sophomore last year, the former
Sequoia high school guard was
seventh in the conference in
scoring and fourth in rebounding.
Johnson's running mate in the
backcourt will be Leo Dorado
(6-1) who broke into the Bear
starting lineup just last weekend.
Four Ciuards
Against Washington, California
in effect used a four guard defense
with two 6-4 men, Phil Chenier

and Jackie Ridgle, playing up
front. Chenier is a fine sophomore
from Berkeley high school who
can make up for his size with his
jumping ability. Ridgle was a
second team all-conference
selection last year who picked up
32 points and 23 rebounds in last
weekend's games against
Washington and WSU.
The biggest surprise for the
Bears so far has been the
performance of 6-9 sophomore
center Ansley Truitt. Truitt
netted 24 points and hauled in 18
rebounds to pace Cal to its win
against Washington. Truitt has
been plagued in inconsistency, but
when he plays up to his
capabilities he can be awesome, as
he showed last weekend.
Stanford will go with the same
starting five that played against
Washington and WSU: Claude
Terry (6-5) and Dennis O'Neill
(6-3) at the guards; Chuck Moore
(6-4) and Fred Green (6-4) at the
forwards, and Bill Palmer (6-7) at
center.

The biggest surprise of last
weekend's games was the
performance of Palmer, especially
against WSU when he picked up
16 points and 14 rebounds. Terry
and O'Neill .still pace the Cards
with 17.9 and 16.2 point averages,
while Green is averaging 10.5
points with a fine 51.1 f o shooting
average.
New OI louse
Cal's victory over Washington
gave the Bears renewed hopes of
contending for the league title.
Against the Huskies, Cal used a
whole new high-low post offense
and a /one defense. The speed and
jumping ability of the Bear's four
guard offense gives other teams
fits and Cal's new offense may
force a couple of adjustments in
Stanford's defense. If Cal can
continue to play as they did
against Washington, they will give
the Indians a lot of trouble.
In a 5:50 preliminary to
tonight's game, the Stanford
Frosh will take on the California
Frosh. The Indians are coming off
a tough win over the Alumni.
Stanford has been lead by guards
John Stratton and Pat Rusco on
their way to a 3-1 record.
The Cal Frosh are led by 6-6
center John Coughran from San
Jose and Joe Simpson, a 6-2 guard
from White Castle, Louisiana.
Simpson is another in a long line
of Cal guards who are good
jumpers and outside shooters,
while Coughran is primarily a
muscleman.

jumping ability of the Bear's four
guard offense gives other teams
fits and Cal's new offense may
force a couple of adjustments in
Stanford's defense. If Cal can
continue to play as they did
against Washington, they will give
the Indians a lot of trouble.
In a 5:50 preliminary to
tonight's game, the Stanford
Frosh will take on the California
Frosh. The Indians are coming off
a tough win over the Alumni.
Stanford has been lead by guards
John Stratton and Pat Rusco on
their way to a 3-1 record.
The Cal Frosh are led by 6-6
center John Coughran from San
Jose and Joe Simpson, a 6-2 guard
from White Castle, Louisiana.
Simpson is another in a long line
of Cal guards who are good
jumpers and outside shooters,
while Coughran is primarily a
muscleman.


TKRR Y-FlKl)—Sophomore Claude Terry drives successfully against a Sanla
Clara opponent last month. The DAILY hopes to gel a new stock of up-to-date
photos in tonight's game against California.
Coming off a pair of tough
road losses to Washington and
Washington State, Stanford's
basketball team opens its home
conference schedule tonight
against California. Stanford has a
poor 2-9 season record, but five of
the defeats have been by five
points or less.
California carries a 7-5 record
but they have explosive potential
as they showed in an 84-64
victory over Washington Monday
night.
Leading the Golden Bears is
returning all-conference guard
Charlie Johnson (6-0). As a
sophomore last year, the former
Sequoia high school guard was
seventh in the conference in
scoring and fourth in rebounding.
Johnson's running mate in the
backcourt will be Leo Dorado
(6-1) who broke into the Bear
starting lineup just last weekend.
Four Ciuards
Against Washington, California
in effect used a four guard defense
with two 6-4 men, Phil Chenier

and Jackie Ridgle, playing up
front. Chenier is a fine sophomore
from Berkeley high school who
can make up for his size with his
jumping ability. Ridgle was a
second team all-conference
selection last year who picked up
32 points and 23 rebounds in last
weekend's games against
Washington and WSU.
The biggest surprise for the
Bears so far has been the
performance of 6-9 sophomore
center Ansley Truitt. Truitt
netted 24 points and hauled in 18
rebounds to pace Cal to its win
against Washington. Truitt has
been plagued in inconsistency, but
when he plays up to his
capabilities he can be awesome, as
he showed last weekend.
Stanford will go with the same
starting five that played against
Washington and WSU: Claude
Terry (6-5) and Dennis O'Neill
(6-3) at the guards; Chuck Moore
(6-4) and Fred Green (6-4) at the
forwards, and Bill Palmer (6-7) at
center.

The biggest surprise of last
weekend's games was the
performance of Palmer, especially
against WSU when he picked up
16 points and 14 rebounds. Terry
and O'Neill .still pace the Cards
with 17.9 and 16.2 point averages,
while Green is averaging 10.5
points with a fine 51.1 f o shooting
average.
New OI louse
Cal's victory over Washington
gave the Bears renewed hopes of
contending for the league title.
Against the Huskies, Cal used a
whole new high-low post offense
and a /one defense. The speed and
jumping ability of the Bear's four
guard offense gives other teams
fits and Cal's new offense may
force a couple of adjustments in
Stanford's defense. If Cal can
continue to play as they did
