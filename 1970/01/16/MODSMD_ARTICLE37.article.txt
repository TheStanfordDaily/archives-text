# Indians Threaten Sacramento String
## 
### 
None of the Encina Pavilion
regulars is quite sure just how long
it has been since Stanford
gvmnasts defeated Sacramento
State.
They get another try tomorrow
night at 7:30 p.m. in their
revamped home quarters.
"I was hopeful last year," says
Coach Dan Millman, "and this
year I'm confident. It will be a
close match but I'm optimistic
about the outcome."
The visiting Hornets move in,
though, with some impressive
material, headed by Jim Fisher

and Dan Barber. Fisher, fifth last
year in NCAA free exercise, is
particularly noted for his
individual and dramatic style.
Like finishing a forward
somersault in splits.
Barber, a senior, is State's top
all-around competitor and figures
to be in a close evening-long
individual bettle with surprising
Stanford freshman Rich Jerome in
that affair.
Jerome's strongest events
appear to be free exercise and
parallel bars, where he scored
marks of 8.45 and 8.35 out ol a
possible ten last week in Los
Angeles.
In analyzing his team, Millman
advises fans to keep an eye on
Jerome in all events; Brian Morgan
figures to score well in free
exercise; Dennis Mesick should
lead the Indians on the side horse;
Steve Rochelle, 11th in NCAA
last year, is one of the best around
on the rings, and Murray Kephart
should score well on the high bar
and in free exercise.
For Sacramento State to
continue its mastery over
Stanford, Fisher and Barber will
have to contribute heavily; both
are scheduled to compete in all six
events.
But Stanford should be able to
hold them back. In the seasoner
opener last week the Tribe fell
only a point short of its best score
all last season.
"And we've worked our tails
off this week," Millman adds.
