# Icemen Slate Oakland Game
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
The Stanford hockey team has
announced a contest against a new
University of California squad in
the Oakland Coliseum-Arena on
Feb. 21.
Already billed as the first Big
Game ice hockey match between
the two rivals, the game will be
played as part of a doubleheader,
with the Oakland Seals meeting
the Pittsburgh Penguins in the
other half. Game time for the
Stanford-Cal match will be 5:30,
with the National Hockey League
contest beginning at 8 p.m.
Ticket plans will be
announced.
The new Cal team has joined
the year-old Bay Area Hockey

League on January 1 and was a
6-4 victim to the Indians last
Monday night in San Francisco.
The two teams play once more,
on Feb. 17 in Belmont, before
their third and final match in
Oakland.
Stanford has now won twice
and lost eight times in league play,
with a game against San Francisco
coming up Monday night at 8 in
Leggs Ice Arena in the city.
On Dec. 8 the Indians dropped
a 6-4 decision to San Francisco in
a game where the Tribe, ahead 4-3
in the early minutes of the third
period, was hurt by penalties and
couldn't hold the lead.
Despite the loss, the Indians on
several occasions showed

conclusively that they were
skating more as a unit and getting
stronger as a team.
These trends were evident in
Monday's win over Cal. An
unassisted first period tally by
Torrey early in the game gave
Stanford a lead it never
relinquished. Both Torrey and
Tittman had two goals in the
game, and Baldwin and Tom Love
had one each. Love is a newcomer
who played hockey at Colorado
College.
Baldwin Leads Scoring
Scoring statistics released by
head coach, league president and
founder Torrey show winger
Baldwin leading the team in
points with 1 7, on seven goals and
ten assists. Torrey, with ten goals,
is in second place with 15 points
and junior Don Mitchell has six
goals and 12 points. Behind him
are Tittman (ten points) and
hockey club president Bob Kadlec
(six points). Gianos has seven
points. <

In the cage, goaltender Gary
Aitken, a grad student in Spanish,
made 179 saves in five games, for
an average of 35.8 saves per game.
George Meredith, an engineering
grad student has stopped 118
shots in four games.
The new Cal team has been
organized along much the same
lines as the Stanford club. Prior to
1950, the Bears had a nationally
known but isolated hockey team
which was finally forced to cease
play, partly due to a paucity of
opponents.
Now, after a decade of
phenomenal hockey expansion on
both the college and professional
levels, interest in the sport has
grown in the Bay Area.
Nevertheless, the only other
college hockey team on the West
Coast is a University of
Washington club in Seattle. Menlo
College in Menlo Park has formed
a junior college squad.

Oakland.
Stanford has now won twice
and lost eight times in league play,
with a game against San Francisco
coming up Monday night at 8 in
Leggs Ice Arena in the city.
On Dec. 8 the Indians dropped
a 6-4 decision to San Francisco in
a game where the Tribe, ahead 4-3
in the early minutes of the third
period, was hurt by penalties and
couldn't hold the lead.
Despite the loss, the Indians on
several occasions showed

conclusively that they were
skating more as a unit and getting
stronger as a team.
These trends were evident in
Monday's win over Cal. An
unassisted first period tally by
Torrey early in the game gave
Stanford a lead it never
relinquished. Both Torrey and
Tittman had two goals in the
game, and Baldwin and Tom Love
had one each. Love is a newcomer
who played hockey at Colorado
College.
Baldwin Leads Scoring
Scoring statistics released by
head coach, league president and
founder Torrey show winger
Baldwin leading the team in
points with 1 7, on seven goals and
ten assists. Torrey, with ten goals,
is in second place with 15 points
and junior Don Mitchell has six
goals and 12 points. Behind him
are Tittman (ten points) and
hockey club president Bob Kadlec
(six points). Gianos has seven
points. <

In the cage, goaltender Gary
Aitken, a grad student in Spanish,
made 179 saves in five games, for
an average of 35.8 saves per game.
George Meredith, an engineering
grad student has stopped 118
shots in four games.
The new Cal team has been
organized along much the same
lines as the Stanford club. Prior to
1950, the Bears had a nationally
known but isolated hockey team
which was finally forced to cease
play, partly due to a paucity of
opponents.
Now, after a decade of
phenomenal hockey expansion on
both the college and professional
levels, interest in the sport has
grown in the Bay Area.
Nevertheless, the only other
college hockey team on the West
Coast is a University of
Washington club in Seattle. Menlo
College in Menlo Park has formed
a junior college squad.
The Stanford hockey team has
announced a contest against a new
University of California squad in
the Oakland Coliseum-Arena on
Feb. 21.
Already billed as the first Big
Game ice hockey match between
the two rivals, the game will be
played as part of a doubleheader,
with the Oakland Seals meeting
the Pittsburgh Penguins in the
other half. Game time for the
Stanford-Cal match will be 5:30,
with the National Hockey League
contest beginning at 8 p.m.
Ticket plans will be
announced.
The new Cal team has joined
the year-old Bay Area Hockey

League on January 1 and was a
6-4 victim to the Indians last
Monday night in San Francisco.
The two teams play once more,
on Feb. 17 in Belmont, before
their third and final match in
Oakland.
