# For Secretary Of State
## Track Coach Jordan May Run 
### FRED MANN 
Pay ton Jordan, Stanford's
well-known and often
controversial track and field
coach, may quit the University to
enter state politics.
Jordan is reportedly
considering running for Secretary
of State of California on the
Republican ticket. He is scheduled
to talk with party leaders
tomorrow in San Jose at the
meeting of the board of directors
of the conservative California
Republican Assembly.
Jordan is currently in
Washington D.C., and unavailable
for comment.
One Other Opponent
The only other Republican to
announce for the Secretary of
State post is Assemblyman George
W. Milias of Gilroy. Edmund G.
Brown, Jr., son of the former
governor, is expected to announce
his candidacy for the Democratic
nomination.
Jordan has served as Stanford
track coach for 13 years, and has
consistently built powerful teams,
the best of which came in 1963
when the Indians finished second
in the NCAA championships.
Olympic Coach
Before coming to Stanford,
Jordan spent 10 championship
years at Occidental College where
he was named to the NAIA Hall
of Fame for his coaching talents.
A former president and current
vice-president of the National
Collegiate Track Coaches

Association, he is an experienced
coach on the international level,
having helped several national
teams prepare for the Olympics.
In 1968 Jordan was named head
coach of the United States track
and field team. Under his
leadership, it won more medals
than any U.S. team in history.
At the height of the black
athletes' Olympic boycott
movement, Jordan became the
major target for black criticism.
He and San Jose State professor
Harry Edwards, leader of the
proposed boycott, made headlines
at a Stanford forum discussion on
the role of the black athlete.
Criticized By Many
In calling coaches some of the
biggest racists in America,
Edwards singled out Jordan as
"the devil" and said, "You have
about as much business running
an athletic team that contains
minority-group people as Adolf
Hitler has being Grand Marshall of
Israel's Maccabean Games."
Other critics said Jordan
displayed "an amazing lack of
awareness of the problem* of
black athletes and an alarming
insensitivity to racial issues in
general."
But many students and
university personnel defended
Jordan as "a respected coach and
person," and blasted Edwards for
the "vicious personal attack."
Jordan's problems did not end
there however, as Ramparts
Magazine revealed that Jordan had

called Edwards a communist.
Ramparts quoted Jordan as
stating, "I have been reading
material by the House Committee
on Un-American Activities and I
can see that Edwards is a
commie." The article went on to
attribute Jordan with saying "And
I wouldn't be surprised if Tommie
Smith and Lee Evans (San Jose
State boycotting black athletes)
were also communists . . . If
Edwards wanted to go to Russia,
I'd give him $1,500 out of my
own pocket."
Jordan denied making the
statements.
More Controversy
Before the Olympic boycott
troubles, Coach Jordan had
created a controversy when he
threw freshman Patrick Morrison
off the Indian track team in the
spring of 1966 for his "Beatle"
haircut. Morrison held Stanford
records for the 1 00 and 200 yard
dashes. His times were invalidated.
Many athletes protested the
action and some even quit the
team. The Ramparts issue
(April-May, 1968) quoted from a
letter written by Jordan to the
parents of one of the athletes who
quit during the Morrison
controversy. He reportedly wrote:
"I firmly believe our country is
going through an era in which
fundamental values, laws, and free
institutions (and I include
Stanford) are under attack. This
Morrison case, trite as it might
first appear, is nevertheless a

manifestation of this nationwide
philosophic anarchy.
"I have become convinced that
if America is to survive these
attacks, we will need a renewal of
respect for law and orderly
process . . . Fine young men, like
your son, should not be duped
and then follow like sheep behind
men like young David Harris and
Morrison."
