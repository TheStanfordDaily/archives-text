# Swimmers Take On Cougars Here
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
Stanford's highly rated varsity swimming team, with an impressive
86-76 victory over the Santa Clara Swim Club behind them from last
weekend's Stanford Relays, hosts Washington State tomorrow at
Encina Pool.
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran, however, is looking at the match a
week ahead against the Cougars' sister school, the University of
Washington. Stanford meets the Huskies here on Jan. 23.
"We don't expect much trouble tomorrow," Gaughran commented
on the Indians' prospects against the Pullman club,"and we plan to
swim people in one event each, in order to give as many guys as
possible the chance to compete - unless we run into unforseen
trouble." Considering the caliber of Gaughran's swimmers, such
trouble seems remote.
No Cougar Lettermen
The Cougars, under coast Doug Gibb, meet Stanford with nine
returning lettermen on the squad, among them distance freestylers
Dan Yielding and Bob Svoboda. The two distance swimmers can look
foreward to competiton from NCAA freestyle finalists Brent Berk and
Jamie Knorr, along with Bert Mason, Mark Shelley, and freshman Tim
Broderick.
Washington State's backstrokers—sophomore Brad Story and high
school Ail-American Garey Ha<er, will have to contend with NCAA
backstroke champion Fred Haywood, the Indians captain for the '70
season, as well as sophomores Larry Schadt and Rob Wolley. Brent
Youngblood, the Cougar's All-American high-school butterflier faces
an outstanding squad of Stanford butterfliers led by NCAA champ
John Ferris. The 1968 olympian has hit 1:55.0 thus far (at the Hawaii
Swim Forum Collegiate Invitational), for the 200-yd. butterfly, which
he won last year at Indiana.
Ferris is joined by Mike Masarie, one of the top-ranked AAU
butterfliers who sat out the '69 season following his transfer to
Stanford, and by a trio of Sophomores, Terry Foote, Brooke Cross,
and Randy Wilkins. Washington State's co-captain Bob Elby, a
breaststroker, will face Job, Morris, and Schilling.
Splendid Sprinters
Other promising Stanford competitors include freestyle sprinters
Rick Eagleston, John Glaser, Bob Jamison, Jack Wells, Bill Huck,
freshman Bob Warren, and Bob Bebb, who set the freshman record for
the 50 free last year with a time of 21.5; distance freestylers Larry
Lozensky, and Ray Collins; divers Ted Nichols, Bill Main (a 1968
NCAA finalist out of competition last year), Fred Bachman, and
junior college transfer Lederman.
Looking foreward to a difficult meet with the surprisingly strong
Washington Huskies, Coach Gaughran said "We've been sufficiently
frightened by Washington's performances that we can look forward to
a week of hard practice to prepare for them." Posted on the bulletin
board at Encina Pool is a list of top collegiate times through January
12—and underlined on the top of the list is the justifiable question
"Who ARE those guys?", referring to the rash of Washington
swimmers, largely most of the eleven meet events.
