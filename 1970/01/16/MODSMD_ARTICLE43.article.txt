# Despite Rain
## Diamond Gems Sought 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
Nearly fifty Stanford baseball
players have been braving the
elements and working out on a
daily basis since the beginning of
the quarter in preparation for the
Indians' first gamesâ€”now less than
three weeks away.
On Feb. 3 the varsity hosts a
Philadelphia Philly rookie squad
and the sophomore-freshman
"Brave" team takes on Gavilan
Junior College. The games are the
first of more than ninety
scheduled for the two teams this
season.
The chances are, of course,
that winter and spring rains will
slim down those schedules
somewhat. But the precipitation
so far this month hasn't kept the
Tribe overly idle.
Indoor workouts and
classroom situation briefings have
been combined by Coach Ray
Young with outdoor running,
throwing and hitting drills with
the result that nearly all players
feel that they're getting a good
chance to get in shape.
Sunken Scene
The scene in Sunken Diamond
Tuesday was typical: there was a
variety of continuous action in
the batting cages and the outfield
along with a steady stream of
hitters taking cuts in the field
cage.
Pitching coach Tom Dunton
has his 18 hurlers throwing about
ten minutes of batting practice
every day and spending additional
time on fielding, pickoff and
defensive drills.
In fact, the weather has limited
only the infield drills, despite a
new leveling of the infield with
additional dirt during the
Christmas break. Drainage has
been considerably improved, as
has the appearance of the base
lines and the home plate area.
Talent Abounds
After losing six starters from
last year's squad, Young is now
faced with the prospect of
drawing on an apparent
cornucopia of talent to fill out the
varsity. The coach feels he has so
many equally talented individuals

that extensive platooning in early
season play will be a must, not to
mention an advantage.
Senior Mike Ewing, named to
the Pac-B's 2nd team last season
after a torrid second half gave him
a .400 average in league play,
looks to be a shoo-in in the
outfield, probably left. Others
vying for outfield spots include
Hank Snider, who hit .444 in 19
games last year, and juniors Neal
Hoffacker, Curt Fant and Sandy
Swanson, a transfer from Florida.
Infield prospects include Dick
Borchers and Bob Marshall at
third base and a host of
newcomers. At first base,
freshman Mike Nelson, transfer
Bob Wilhelm and Jack Lynn, a
member of last season's Brave
squad, are the candidates. At
second, sophs Phil Kelber and
Gary Osterhout have the early
line, while Borchers and soph
Dave Edson ary in the running for
the shortstop spot.
Catchers include senior Don
Schellenberg, sidelined much of
last season by a hand injury, along
with Bob Reece and strong-armed
Glen Johnson, both freshmen.
Mound Core Deep
Pitching Coach Dunton sees
veterans Phil Keller, a unaninous
All-District 8 righthander last
season who was 8-3 with a 1.96
ERA, Steve Dunning (0.82 ERA
in three league games) and Jim
Coate (4-0 overall and as 0.96
league ERA) forming the nucleus
of a strong, deep staff.
Other pitchers include junior
Bruce Schoen, soph Bob
Kammeyer, senior Bob Sharpe
and transfer soph Tom Changnon.
If these four can perform with
any degree of success, and if the
three varsity holdovers can come
close to their 1969 performances,
the loss of Bob Boone (9-1) and
Rod Poteete (6-2) from last
season should easily be overcome.
In addition, Young is faced
with the pleasant prospect of
having a number of players who
can play more than one position.
Infielder Marshall can play the
outfield and pitch. All of the
catchers can also play outfield, as

can firstbasemen Nelson, Wilhelm
and Lynn. In short, personnel
versatility looks to be one of the
Tribe's big assets this season.
As Young says, "It's just a bear
trying to figure who the hell's
going to play where."
Diamonds In the Rough
To add to the confusion, four
members of a local pro
organization, B. Bonds, H. Lanier,
M. McCormick, and K. Henderson
are working out in the Sunken
Diamond several times a week.
Chances are, though, that Young
won't confuse these individuals
with members of his own squad.
In the meantime, workouts
continue. The rain will hurt
progress, but, as Hank Snider put
it, "as long as you can do
something every day," old batting
eyes and strong, supple throwing
arms will return. Right now an
immediate goal is preparation for
the first intrasquad game, on Jan.
24.
