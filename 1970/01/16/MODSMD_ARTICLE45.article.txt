A new course entitled
"Seminar on International
Simulation" is being given this
quarter. Although offered by the
Engineering School, it is open to
anyone and is taught chiefly by
Political Science Professor
Lagerstrom.
The class will be divided into
teams, each of which will work
with one underdeveloped South
American country. Each member
of a team will hold a position of
power, such as head of state,
military leader, or simply citizen.
Decisions made by the students
concerning such things as
developing the country will be put
through a computer, which will
determine the results of the
actions.
The course will be given for 2
units, preferably pass/fail, and
meets Monday evenings in room
285 in the Engineering corner.

Elections for all Black Student
Union (BSU) offices will be held

The offices open are those of
Chairman, Vice-Chairman,
Treasurer, and Recording and
Corresponding Secretaries.
Nominations will be open up

Those interested in making

A survey to determine the
extent of community use of the
Meyer Library will be conducted
on Saturday, Jan. 17, from 10:00
a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and Sunday,
Jan. 18, through Thursday, Jan.
22, from 6:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.
Persons entering the library
will be asked to show their
Stanford identification, or if they
are not from Stanford, to indicate
where they live and attend school.
The survey is prompted by
numerous comments from
Stanford students that use of
Meyer Library by residents from
nearby communities and students
from other schools makes it
difficult for Stanford students to
find study space and good study
conditions.
The results will be made
available to the faculty-student

Committee on Libraries for
consideration.

To help relieve Finals tension,
San Jose State has decided to
offer free psychological advice to
callers on a 24-hour basis through
January 23.
To handle "call-in"
psychological and drug problems,
three extra lines have been
installed. The numbers are
287-8004, 287-8005, and
287-8006. The lines will be
manned by faculty and students
trained in clinical psychological,
with outside psychologists and
psychiatrists for reference.
A new course entitled
"Seminar on International
Simulation" is being given this
quarter. Although offered by the
Engineering School, it is open to
anyone and is taught chiefly by
Political Science Professor
Lagerstrom.
The class will be divided into
teams, each of which will work
with one underdeveloped South
American country. Each member
of a team will hold a position of
power, such as head of state,
military leader, or simply citizen.
Decisions made by the students
concerning such things as
developing the country will be put
through a computer, which will
determine the results of the
actions.
The course will be given for 2
units, preferably pass/fail, and
meets Monday evenings in room
285 in the Engineering corner.

Elections for all Black Student
Union (BSU) offices will be held
this Sunday, January 18, at 2:00
p.m. in Room 270 of Tresidder.
The offices open are those of
Chairman, Vice-Chairman,
Treasurer, and Recording and
Corresponding Secretaries.
Nominations will be open up
until the time of the elections.
Those interested in making
nominations or seeking further
information about the elections
should contact Dave Edwards or
Jon Sylvester.

A survey to determine the
extent of community use of the
Meyer Library will be conducted
on Saturday, Jan. 17, from 10:00
a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and Sunday,
Jan. 18, through Thursday, Jan.
22, from 6:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.
Persons entering the library
will be asked to show their
Stanford identification, or if they
are not from Stanford, to indicate
where they live and attend school.
The survey is prompted by
numerous comments from
Stanford students that use of
Meyer Library by residents from
nearby communities and students
from other schools makes it
difficult for Stanford students to
find study space and good study
conditions.
The results will be made
available to the faculty-student

Committee on Libraries for
consideration.
