# ASSU Senate Rescinds Nominations Support
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
The student Senate passed a
resolution last night withdrawing
support for all of its nominations
for eight student seats on trustee
committees. The move came in
the wake of President Pitzer's veto
of the nomination of Yale
Braunstein to the Finance
Committee. The measure passed
14-12 after lengthy debate.
"Student membership on these
committees has changed nothing,"
said Senator Leo Bazile, "and I
don't think we should send
anyone at all."
Senator Jim Schnieder
introduced a compromise
proposal which would have left
Braunstein's seat vacant, which,
along with a motion endorsing
Braunstein and calling for no
students to serve on the
committees until the matter was
resolved, was defeated.
During the course of the
debate Senator Braunstein
claimed that an administration
spokesman had told him that if he
pursued this matter further, it
would be considered a probation
violation. ASSU President Pat
Shea commented that although he
didn't agree with the implication
that Braunstein was being
threatened, he would resign his
post if Braunstein was indeed
ousted from the university
because of his original offense.
Shea later told the Daily that
"In the last three days the
University community has been
adjusting internally to many
decisions from BYU to a new Vice
President for Research to the
Braunstein case. In each of these
cases I have found a strong ally in
President Pitzer.
Seek Reversal
"I will personally seek to
reverse the Senate's decision
concerning nominations. I would
encourage my fellow students to
seek out their representatives and

recommend that they support me
in reaffirming the nominations.
"The influence students have
in issues such as BYU is of the
utmost importance to maintain. I
invite interested senators to seek
me out for discussion."
One of the co-signers of the
resolution, Rick Atkins, told the
DaiI> "the Constitution of ASSU
guarantees certain rights to
individual members of the
association. The Senate reaffirmed
this in Schnieder's resolution last
week. The constitution states that
ASSU is the sole representative of
the student body.
Only Course
If President Pitzer wants to
arbitrarily supercede established
working procedures, then the only
course open to the Senate is to
recognize that it indeed does not
have the power it is supposed to
have.
Since the President is keeping a
student off the committee ad lib,
then he must ultimately be able to
pick students for committees ad
lib. Therefore we have withdrawn
our endorsements of any student
nominees.
The Senate also passed, by a
14-10 vote, a resolution
introduced by Senator John
Shoch condemning the Board of
Trustees "for having acted in their
own economic self interest while
ignoring the attitudes of many
members of the community
concerning the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI)."
The resolution also "expressed
the hope that members of the
community will continue to press
their efforts to redirect research
policy at SRI."
Gross Negligence
In introducing the resolution,
Shoch said the "trustees have
been grossly negligent in ignoring
the wishes of much of their
constituency."
A resolution calling for the

Stanford police to "stop giving
punitive tickets and to end
repressive actions in this manner
against students," was defeated.
The text of the Senate
Braunstein resolution follows:
Whereas the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University has
established certain standing
committees, namely: Committee on
Academic Affairs, Committee in Land
Development, Committee on Finance,
Committee on Buildings and Grounds,
and Committee on Planning and
Development, and
Recognizing that student
membership on these committees has
been requested by the Board of
Trustees, and
Recognizing that the ASSU and no
other entity is the sole representative
of the entire Stanford Student Body
(Constitution: 1,3), and
Recognizing that the Senate of the
ASSU is the only representative
legislative body of the Associated
Students with the final authority
(Constitution: 11,8; 11,9) of
confirmation of student nominees to
university committees, and
Whereas Vale M. Braunstein and
Robert Grant were selected by the
ASSU Committee on Nominations
(Constitution 11,8) and confirmed by
the ASSU Senate (Constitution 11,9) as
the best qualified candidates to fill the
student vacancies on the Committee on
Finance, and
Recognizing that the right of Yale
M. Braunstein to serve on the
Committee on Finance is guaranteed
(Constitution: 1,2) by the Constitution
of the Associated Students of Stanford
University as signed and approved by
President Kenneth S. Pitzer and as
reaffirmed by the ASSU Senate in
Special Session (January 7, 1970).
Whereas President Pitzer has chosen
not to recognize the selected nominees
of the Senate of the Associated
Students of Stanford University; and
Whereas the Senate has no other
recourse in order to act in accordance
with the mandate to represent the
interests of the Associated Students;
and
Whereas it has become clear that the
Senate of the Associated Students does
not in fact have the actual power to
appoint student representatives to
Trustee Committees,
Therefore be it resolved;
That the Senate of the Associated
Students hereby withdraws its
endorsement of any and all student
members of Trustee Committees.

anyone at all."
Senator Jim Schnieder
introduced a compromise
proposal which would have left
Braunstein's seat vacant, which,
along with a motion endorsing
Braunstein and calling for no
students to serve on the
committees until the matter was
resolved, was defeated.
During the course of the
debate Senator Braunstein
claimed that an administration
spokesman had told him that if he
pursued this matter further, it
would be considered a probation
violation. ASSU President Pat
Shea commented that although he
didn't agree with the implication
that Braunstein was being
threatened, he would resign his
post if Braunstein was indeed
ousted from the university
because of his original offense.
Shea later told the Daily that
"In the last three days the
University community has been
adjusting internally to many
decisions from BYU to a new Vice
President for Research to the
Braunstein case. In each of these
cases I have found a strong ally in
President Pitzer.
Seek Reversal
"I will personally seek to
reverse the Senate's decision
concerning nominations. I would
encourage my fellow students to
seek out their representatives and

recommend that they support me
in reaffirming the nominations.
"The influence students have
in issues such as BYU is of the
utmost importance to maintain. I
invite interested senators to seek
me out for discussion."
One of the co-signers of the
resolution, Rick Atkins, told the
DaiI> "the Constitution of ASSU
guarantees certain rights to
individual members of the
association. The Senate reaffirmed
this in Schnieder's resolution last
week. The constitution states that
ASSU is the sole representative of
the student body.
Only Course
If President Pitzer wants to
arbitrarily supercede established
working procedures, then the only
course open to the Senate is to
recognize that it indeed does not
have the power it is supposed to
have.
Since the President is keeping a
student off the committee ad lib,
then he must ultimately be able to
pick students for committees ad
lib. Therefore we have withdrawn
our endorsements of any student
nominees.
The Senate also passed, by a
14-10 vote, a resolution
introduced by Senator John
Shoch condemning the Board of
Trustees "for having acted in their
own economic self interest while
ignoring the attitudes of many
members of the community
concerning the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI)."
The resolution also "expressed
the hope that members of the
community will continue to press
their efforts to redirect research
policy at SRI."
Gross Negligence
In introducing the resolution,
Shoch said the "trustees have
been grossly negligent in ignoring
the wishes of much of their
constituency."
A resolution calling for the

Stanford police to "stop giving
punitive tickets and to end
repressive actions in this manner
against students," was defeated.
The text of the Senate
Braunstein resolution follows:
Whereas the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University has
established certain standing
committees, namely: Committee on
Academic Affairs, Committee in Land
Development, Committee on Finance,
Committee on Buildings and Grounds,
and Committee on Planning and
Development, and
Recognizing that student
membership on these committees has
been requested by the Board of
Trustees, and
Recognizing that the ASSU and no
other entity is the sole representative
of the entire Stanford Student Body
(Constitution: 1,3), and
Recognizing that the Senate of the
ASSU is the only representative
legislative body of the Associated
Students with the final authority
(Constitution: 11,8; 11,9) of
confirmation of student nominees to
university committees, and
Whereas Vale M. Braunstein and
Robert Grant were selected by the
ASSU Committee on Nominations
(Constitution 11,8) and confirmed by
the ASSU Senate (Constitution 11,9) as
the best qualified candidates to fill the
student vacancies on the Committee on
Finance, and
Recognizing that the right of Yale
M. Braunstein to serve on the
Committee on Finance is guaranteed
(Constitution: 1,2) by the Constitution
of the Associated Students of Stanford
University as signed and approved by
President Kenneth S. Pitzer and as
reaffirmed by the ASSU Senate in
Special Session (January 7, 1970).
Whereas President Pitzer has chosen
not to recognize the selected nominees
of the Senate of the Associated
Students of Stanford University; and
Whereas the Senate has no other
recourse in order to act in accordance
with the mandate to represent the
interests of the Associated Students;
and
Whereas it has become clear that the
Senate of the Associated Students does
not in fact have the actual power to
appoint student representatives to
Trustee Committees,
Therefore be it resolved;
That the Senate of the Associated
Students hereby withdraws its
endorsement of any and all student
members of Trustee Committees.
The student Senate passed a
resolution last night withdrawing
support for all of its nominations
for eight student seats on trustee
committees. The move came in
the wake of President Pitzer's veto
of the nomination of Yale
Braunstein to the Finance
Committee. The measure passed
14-12 after lengthy debate.

violation. ASSU President Pat
Shea commented that although he
didn't agree with the implication
that Braunstein was being
threatened, he would resign his
post if Braunstein was indeed
ousted from the university
because of his original offense.
Shea later told the Daily that
"In the last three days the
University community has been
adjusting internally to many
decisions from BYU to a new Vice
President for Research to the
Braunstein case. In each of these
cases I have found a strong ally in
President Pitzer.
Seek Reversal
"I will personally seek to
reverse the Senate's decision
concerning nominations. I would
encourage my fellow students to
seek out their representatives and

recommend that they support me
in reaffirming the nominations.
"The influence students have
in issues such as BYU is of the
utmost importance to maintain. I
invite interested senators to seek
me out for discussion."
One of the co-signers of the
resolution, Rick Atkins, told the
DaiI> "the Constitution of ASSU
guarantees certain rights to
individual members of the
association. The Senate reaffirmed
this in Schnieder's resolution last
week. The constitution states that
ASSU is the sole representative of
the student body.
Only Course
If President Pitzer wants to
arbitrarily supercede established
working procedures, then the only
course open to the Senate is to
recognize that it indeed does not
have the power it is supposed to
have.
Since the President is keeping a
student off the committee ad lib,
then he must ultimately be able to
pick students for committees ad
lib. Therefore we have withdrawn
our endorsements of any student
nominees.
The Senate also passed, by a
14-10 vote, a resolution
introduced by Senator John
Shoch condemning the Board of
Trustees "for having acted in their
own economic self interest while
ignoring the attitudes of many
members of the community
concerning the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI)."
The resolution also "expressed
the hope that members of the
community will continue to press
their efforts to redirect research
policy at SRI."
Gross Negligence
In introducing the resolution,
Shoch said the "trustees have
been grossly negligent in ignoring
the wishes of much of their
constituency."
A resolution calling for the

Stanford police to "stop giving
punitive tickets and to end
repressive actions in this manner
against students," was defeated.
The text of the Senate
Braunstein resolution follows:
Whereas the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University has
established certain standing
committees, namely: Committee on
Academic Affairs, Committee in Land
Development, Committee on Finance,
Committee on Buildings and Grounds,
and Committee on Planning and
Development, and
Recognizing that student
membership on these committees has
been requested by the Board of
Trustees, and
Recognizing that the ASSU and no
other entity is the sole representative
of the entire Stanford Student Body
(Constitution: 1,3), and
Recognizing that the Senate of the
ASSU is the only representative
legislative body of the Associated
Students with the final authority
(Constitution: 11,8; 11,9) of
confirmation of student nominees to
university committees, and
Whereas Vale M. Braunstein and
Robert Grant were selected by the
ASSU Committee on Nominations
(Constitution 11,8) and confirmed by
the ASSU Senate (Constitution 11,9) as
the best qualified candidates to fill the
student vacancies on the Committee on
Finance, and
Recognizing that the right of Yale
M. Braunstein to serve on the
Committee on Finance is guaranteed
(Constitution: 1,2) by the Constitution
of the Associated Students of Stanford
University as signed and approved by
President Kenneth S. Pitzer and as
reaffirmed by the ASSU Senate in
Special Session (January 7, 1970).
Whereas President Pitzer has chosen
not to recognize the selected nominees
of the Senate of the Associated
Students of Stanford University; and
Whereas the Senate has no other
recourse in order to act in accordance
with the mandate to represent the
interests of the Associated Students;
and
Whereas it has become clear that the
Senate of the Associated Students does
not in fact have the actual power to
appoint student representatives to
Trustee Committees,
Therefore be it resolved;
That the Senate of the Associated
Students hereby withdraws its
endorsement of any and all student
members of Trustee Committees.
The student Senate passed a
resolution last night withdrawing
support for all of its nominations
for eight student seats on trustee
committees. The move came in
the wake of President Pitzer's veto
of the nomination of Yale
Braunstein to the Finance
Committee. The measure passed
14-12 after lengthy debate.
"Student membership on these
committees has changed nothing,"
said Senator Leo Bazile, "and I
don't think we should send
anyone at all."
Senator Jim Schnieder
introduced a compromise
proposal which would have left
Braunstein's seat vacant, which,
along with a motion endorsing
Braunstein and calling for no
students to serve on the
committees until the matter was
resolved, was defeated.
During the course of the
debate Senator Braunstein
claimed that an administration
spokesman had told him that if he
pursued this matter further, it
would be considered a probation
violation. ASSU President Pat
Shea commented that although he
didn't agree with the implication
that Braunstein was being
threatened, he would resign his
post if Braunstein was indeed
ousted from the university
because of his original offense.
