# Form Your Own Course
## Student Center To Open 
### KATHY STEPHENSON 
"Responsive"—a significant
word in the ASSU vocabulary—is
embodied in the new Student
Center for Innovation in Research
and Education. Planned and
proposed by Bruce Campbell and
the ASSU Council of Presidents,
the Student Center promises to
fill a large gap that has been
evident in independent study at
Stanford
No longer will a student, who
is interested in a project outside
the conventional curriculum, be
sent from professor to professor
in the hope of finding a sponsor.
A student, who may want to leave
the idyllic university setting to do
field work, will now be able to get
full credit.
The objective of the Student

Center is to serve as a "focus for
education in innovation: an
agency for facilitating student and
student-faculty research and field
work; an institution responsive to
the course interests of students; a
source of institutional
introspection for the University."
This objective is implemented
through three main functions.
First, the Student Center can
grant credit of up to 27 units for
student-initiated work. For
example, a student may receive 15
units for a quarter of individual
work; while for preparatory
background and reading he may
get 6 units.
Secondly, the Center provides
accessible channels to interested
faculty. It can also refer the
student to past or current

programs, pertinent to his
interest. Temporary academic
appointments can be granted to a
qualified person outside the
University, under whom a student
may wish to work.
Thirdly, the Center can help
the student find funding for major
projects, both directly from the
Innovation fund and indirectly by
handling contacts to University
Fellows, specific agencies and
major firms.
Graduate Students
How will this new mechanism
process students' proposals? The
Center will be headed by an 11
member Policy Board (for which
applications are now available).
The Board will include 5 faculty
members selected by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and 6 students picked by
the Committee on Nominations.
It is hoped that two of the
student members will be graduate
students. As Council of Presidents
member, Joyce Kobayashi states,
"The role of graduate students in
undergraduate education is
becoming increasingly significant
because who is more
knowledgeable about
undergraduate problems and new
solutions than those who have
experienced it."
The Board will elect a half-time
director, preferably a grad
student, who will be paid a salary
comparable to teaching assistant

pay. He will be assisted by a
full-time secretary and a half-time
assistant. When a student submits
his proposal to the Board, the
evaluation process includes a
statement of interest; discussion
with the student; and recruitment
of a faculty sponsor.
San Francisco Urban Center
By next week, after final
selection of the Board, the
Student Center for Innovation in
Research and Education will begin
operation. The ASSU Council of
Presidents anticipates many fresh
student-initiated ideas. Some
interesting possibilities might
include: an Urban Center in San
Francisco; the establishment of an
Experimental College; academic
credit for students working on
curriculum changes at Stanford;
undergraduate research projects
on subjects like air pollution;
research at the overseas campuses
related to the specific country; or
full credit for students doing
research while on field work or in
programs such as Volunteers in
Asia, for as Joyce Kobayashi
believes, "If a student has a
sincere interest, he should be able
to formulate his own program
with an interested faculty member
while away from the University."
The Student Center is a
student-managed mechanism for
any student who has creative ideas
and wants to implement them in
his own individual program—a
prerogative previously enjoyed
mainly by honor students.
