## Arab Student's Views What Peace Means To Us 
### Amin A. Missallati 
Introductory Note
In reference to the recent letter
from a Stanford graduate asking
for the deportation of all Arab
students who dared speak out
against the visit of Israeli
Ambassador Rabin to
Stanford—the enclosed statement
speaks for itself.
This statement is date-lined
STANFORD-Dec. 4, 1969. It
was the result of much
deliberation between we the Arab
students in our efforts to explain
as simply and directly as possible
the reasons for objecting to
Rabin's appearance on campus.
The statement was delivered, in
advance of the demonstration, to
the Daily and other papers in the
area. But if read at all, it certainly
was not printed.
The Daily's disregard of the
opinion of a recognized part of
the current Stanford student
body, while turning its attention

to the vengeful complaint of a
' single graduate of some 40 years
I ago, is indeed regrettable. As
> Stanford students we must
t question the integrity of the
' editorial board which made such a
> decision.
t We would like also to remind
the author of the letter in
1 question that we shall continue to
t stand by our principles as
explained in our statement. And
we should indeed welcome any
investigations into our thoughts
and actions. For who
knows-perhaps such an
investigation would provide an
occasion for us to present our
very legitimate case.
What Peace Means to Us
We take the occasion of the
arrival in San Francisco of General
Itzhak Rabin, the Israeli
' Ambassador, to express our
t opinion of what Peace means to
i us in the Middle East. We think

that the origins of the problem
itself are quite simple, although
possible solutions are extremely
difficult. The "existence"—
although mutually unrecognized
formally—of a "State of Israel"
and an exiled "Palestinian People"
testify proof of our following
conclusions.
First, we feel that the breach
of peace and escalation of tension
over the past 50 years or so were
the direct result of:
1. The idea—born of European
and American discrimination—
that a solution to Anti-Jewish
persecution would be the
"establishment of a political state
in which Jews are the dominant
and overwhelming majority," i.e.,
the Zionist Movement to re-gather
Jews from all over the world to
form a state.
2. The implementation of this
idea in Palestine —a land that
already had an established culture
and population, but a newly
awakening political and national
consciousness: This
implementation took very little
account of the people of Palestine
on whose soil the "new state" was
being formed. As a consequence
of the logic of the Zionist idea,
and as a matter of fact, the
Palestinian people found
themselves stateless—if not
homeless—on the eve of the
establishment of the State of
Israel.
3. The nature, definition, and
stated goals of the Israeli State:
From its very name, the Jewish
state has been and still is a state
that discriminates on the basis of
religion and ethnic origin. Among
all states or countries in the
world, its nationality laws are
unique in accepting and rejecting
citizenship, not on the basis of
brith-rights but religious and/or
ethnic background. This meant
that the Palestinian Arabs who
weren't Jewish had two
unpleasant choices—that of being
refugees outside the land to which
they held birth-rights, or that of
remaining on their land as
second-class citizens at best. A
land in which they henceforth
would be obliged to sing a
national anthem that says, "In my
bosom beats a Jewish heart."
4. The maintainance of the
state by force of arms rather than

face up to responsibilities of
justice and repatriation to the
Palestinians: Former Israeli Prime
Minister, Ben Gurion, once said
with pride and determination,
"This state (Israel) was created by
force and shall be maintained by
force." This attitude and
sanctioned policy again left our
people with two distasteful
choices—to accept the negation of
their existance and birth-rights as
a "fait acompli," or begin to
defend themselves. Unfortunately,
the simple people on both sides
were caught up into the spiral of
such logic for survival, the spiral
of a vicious combat not of their
own making.
The previous conclusions
reflect, to a great extent, the
outlines of our view. But this is
not enough. If we are to learn
anything from the painful
experiences of the Middle East
conflict and from examples set by
other peoples in the world, then
the following principles must
apply in our attempts at finding a
formula for a "permanent peace."
1. Multi-religious and
multi-ethnic communities should
always be governed by secular law
based on individual human and
political rights regardless of
"color, creed, religion, or national
origin." A state based on religious
and ethnic background is not
viable in the 20th century.
2. The Palestinian people have
the right for "self-determination."
And they are asking for a secular
Bi-National state for Moslems,
Jews, and Christians.
3. If self-determination is
denied, then armed resistance is
justified.
Conclusion
As a consequence of the above
principles—and the previous
points of our view on the
conflict—we conclude that Middle
Eastern PEACE and happiness can
only be brought about by a
mutual recognition of Palestinian
and Jewish presence and rights on
the land West of the Jordan
River—and the creation of a new
order in which, under secular law,
Moslems, Christians, and Jew can
live in equality.
