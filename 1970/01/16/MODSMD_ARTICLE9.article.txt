# None Wake Today
## 
### 
With dawn-like futures
(and dusk-like minds
forgetting the sun
as they count off the time
that marks off the seasons
in spite of the days
that fall from the years
with all of their ways 112
they sit in the refuge
with giant size views
that won V feel the wind
that begins to bring news
c and looking out slowly
they wait patiently
5 till practice attaches
I a false sympathy
that strangles their children
who listen so well
to sounds of their voices
that echo the shell
and fills up the youngness
with thick clouds of sounds
that use up the air I
till they're left to the ground
which buckles the efforts
to straighten the curves
and marks off so clearly |
the ones who will serve
but all this comes later
and none wake today
so sleepv they still trudge
along the right way
