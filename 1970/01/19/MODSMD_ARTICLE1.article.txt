# Planned For Frenchman's Hill
## Petition Hits Low-Cost Housing 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Fear of falling property values
reportedly drove Stanford faculty
members to circulate a petition
last summer asking that low-cost
housing not be built on land
adjoining Frenchman's Hill. The
petition, dated June 11, asked
that the hillside acreage either be
left vacant or be earmarked for
"single-family, individual unit
housing which is similar in
character to that now being
constructed on Frenchman's
Hill."
The petition continued, "To
take other courses of action,
whether they be in the form of
apartment, buildings, town houses,
low-cost housing, or an expansion
of Stanford Industrial Park, would
surely not benefit either aesthetic
attributes or property values in
College Terrace and French man's
Hill.
Frenchman's Hill is a faculty
residential area owned by
Stanford. The hillside adjacent to
it was mentioned by the report of

the moulton low-cost housing
committee as one of 1 1 proposed
sites for low and moderate income
housing.
Halt Signed Peti lion
Mrs. Arthur Bienenstock,
Frenchman's Hill representative to
the Stanford Homeowners'
Association, believes that
approximately half of the area's
residents signed the petition.
However, many of the faculty
members living in the housing
development reacted strongly
against the sponsors of the
petition.
On June 18, Assistant Provost
Raymond Bacchetti wrote a letter
to Prof. William R. Rambo,
Chairman of the Committee on
Land and Building Development.
It read, "Dedication of the hill
side acreage to low and moderate
income housing would, in my
judgment, be wholly in accord
with the values to which Stanford
has increasingly become
dedicated. Accordingly, a more
appropriate reaction to a decision

taken or in prospect would be one
of pride and commitment to a
view of society which places social
justice above personal property."
Since last June, some of the
signees of the petition have had
second thoughts about their
action. Dr. Paul Johnson, one of
the five original sponsors, says
that he misunderstood the
wording of the petition and that
he did not realize how his actions
would be interrupted by residents.
Not S> non> inous
"To me, the terms 'low income
housing' and 'low - cost housing'
are not synonymous," he
explained. "I am against building
sub-standard dwellings as a
solution to a housing problem. My
own idea would be to build homes
of the nature of those already
existing on Frenchman's Hill and
then grant subsidies to
low-income families so that they
could afford to live there."
Bruce G. Hinchcliffe and
Richard L. Bennett, opponents of
the petition, argued that faculty

members mov in g into
Frenchman's Hill were warned
that the land adjacent to it might
someday be used for multi-unit
housing. In a letter to one of the
sponsors of the petition they
wrote, "We, and we believe other
lessees, understood prior to
making our investment that the
University was considering the hill
in question as a site for higher
density development."
The petition was one of a series
of incidents stemming from the
low-cost housing controversy.
A nother was a stormy
confrontation between
Admin is t ration represe nta lives
and Frenchman's Hill residents at
a meeting of the Stanford
Homeowners Association.
Frenchman's Hill lessees have
since formed an independent
group which they hope will better
represent their viewpoint.
The entire low income housing
problem is now being reviewed by
the President's Ad Hoc
Committee on University
Housing.
