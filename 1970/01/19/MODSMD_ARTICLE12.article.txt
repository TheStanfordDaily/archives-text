# Watts Troupe Will Appear
## 
### 
On Thursday through Saturday
evenings, January 22-24, the
Studio Watts Workshop Drama
Group will present three free
performances of ''THE
PRODUCT" at 8:30 P.M. in the
Little Theatre. These
performances, presented for the
benefit of the local community,
are part of the Studio's
Co mmunity-Centered Programs.
The visit to Stanford was made
possible by a grant to Studio
Watts Workshop by the National
Endowment for the Arts. Free
tickets for the production may be
obtained in advance at Memorial
Auditorium Box Office and
Tresidder Union Box Office.

Donations to help cover costs may
be sent to Studio Watts, B\>x
.'5963, Stanford.
In the past two years, groups
from the Studio have presented
two other plays at Stanford: "No
Exit" and "Black Girl in Search of
God" adapted by Wanda
Coleman. The current production,
directed by James M. Woods, and
written by Frank Joseph and
Wanda Coleman, is an
experimental approach to theatre.
The procedure in this approach
is that the actors create the idea
for a scene or series of scenes and
work out the idea by role-playing
an "encounter." Through
discussions with the director and a

professional writer a motif is
extracted, and the series of
"encounters" takes shape as a
whole.
According to the Friends of
Studio Watts Workshop, the
Studio approach is unique in that
"THE PRODUCT" manages to
combine theatre as education and
theatre as art; theatre as a finished
product and theatre as a continual
process of human exploration.
