# Warrant Out For Stolen AEL Paper
## 
### JOHN ECKHOUSE 
Police officials and the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's
Office have not yet closed their
files on the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL) sit-in at
Stanford last spring.
Robert Cullenbine, former
Coordinator of the Midpeninsula
Free University, has been served a
warrant for allegedly removing
two reams of paper and 6000
sheets of blank cover paper from
the basement of the lab last April
18. It was worth a total of $1 15.
The incident occurred as
protestors hurriedly prepared to
evacuate the building and was
reportedly observed by the

superintendent of the printing
shop and a Stanford police
officer.
Cullenbine denies that he stole
anything. "1 might have removed
it—if he says he saw me it might
be true, I don't remember—but it
was in the midst of clearing the
building of our property while
everyone was running around in a
panic. As far as I remember, the
things I removed were printed
material or paper donated by
students, including $400 worth of
Free University paper."
Cullenbine's lawyer, Jim
Wolpman, doesn't believe that his
client was singled out by the
University for prosecution
because of his frequent radical
political activities. "The problem
is that he is well-known," said
Wolpman.
A warrant has also been issued
for a second person allegedly
involved in the incident.
Identification of the two
accused persons was made
through the use of photos taken
by the University Photo
Department and (he Stanford
News Service.
Wolpman and Cullenbine are
upset, however, at the long delay
between the time the arrest
warrant was issued and when it
was actually served. The
complaint was originally reported
to the Stanford Police
Department by the head of the
print shop on May 21,
1969—almost a month after the
alleged theft. Warrants were issued
May 29, but Cullenbine was not
served until December 23, seven
months later.
Attorney Wolpman has
indicated that he will make a
motion for dismissal of charges on
the grounds that his client was
denied of his Constitutional right
to a speedy trial. Cullenbine says
that he was always available for
arrest and cannot understand the
delay. The Palo Alio Times
reported that an immediate
attempt to serve the warrant
failed because a clerk misspelled
Cullenbine's name.

sheets of blank cover paper from
the basement of the lab last April
18. It was worth a total of $1 15.
The incident occurred as
protestors hurriedly prepared to
evacuate the building and was
reportedly observed by the

superintendent of the printing
shop and a Stanford police
officer.
Cullenbine denies that he stole
anything. "1 might have removed
it—if he says he saw me it might
be true, I don't remember—but it
was in the midst of clearing the
building of our property while
everyone was running around in a
panic. As far as I remember, the
things I removed were printed
material or paper donated by
students, including $400 worth of
Free University paper."
Cullenbine's lawyer, Jim
Wolpman, doesn't believe that his
client was singled out by the
University for prosecution
because of his frequent radical
political activities. "The problem
is that he is well-known," said
Wolpman.
A warrant has also been issued
for a second person allegedly
involved in the incident.
Identification of the two
accused persons was made
through the use of photos taken
by the University Photo
Department and (he Stanford
News Service.
Wolpman and Cullenbine are
upset, however, at the long delay
between the time the arrest
warrant was issued and when it
was actually served. The
complaint was originally reported
to the Stanford Police
Department by the head of the
print shop on May 21,
1969—almost a month after the
alleged theft. Warrants were issued
May 29, but Cullenbine was not
served until December 23, seven
months later.
Attorney Wolpman has
indicated that he will make a
motion for dismissal of charges on
the grounds that his client was
denied of his Constitutional right
to a speedy trial. Cullenbine says
that he was always available for
arrest and cannot understand the
delay. The Palo Alio Times
reported that an immediate
attempt to serve the warrant
failed because a clerk misspelled
Cullenbine's name.
