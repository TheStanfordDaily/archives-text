# Placement Aid For Humanities Grads
## 
### CATHY COOPER 
Coming soon to the Placement
Service nearest you: a Director of
Humanities Placement. When
filled, the newly-created post will
aid graduates in humanities and
the liberal arts in finding
employ ment.
In addition, the new Director
will oversee expansion of the
Service's summer employment
division and will develop a new
program of career planning to
assist undergraduates from the
time they enter Stanford until
they graduate and secure a job.

Creation of the new position is
in response to the long-realized
neglect of the liberal arts student
by the Placement Service in favor
of graduates in sciences and other
highly specialized fields.
According to Dr. Ralph Keller,
Director of the Placement Service,
this bias arose from the origins of
placement services in general; a
university placement service is an
outgrowth of the placement
services of the different schools
and unfortunately retains the bias
against the liberal arts student.
Dr. Keller stated that hiring of
the new director will be just the
first step in revamping the whole
concept of the placement service.
Currently the service functions
primarily as a job-finding agency.
As envisioned, it will focus more
on the total range of career
planning.
Beginning in the freshman
year, the student will be offered
information about possible careers
that match his interests and given

individual counseling to help him
plan hi* «. ducntion.
"Our goal as a career-planning
service should be to integrate
educational experience and
employment," Keller continued.
"Up until now the Placement
Service has been an administrative
appendage rather than an integral
part of the university."
This new look for the
Placement Service has been
evolving since Dr. Keller took his
present post in 196,"). His studies,
those of an independent firm of
management consultants, and the
Study of Education at Stanford
all pointed to the need for new
and expanded efforts in the area
of career counseling. A committee
headed by Dean Sally Mahoney is
now devising a plan whereby the
Placement Service can offer these
new services without a sizable
increase in budget.
Lack of funds has retarded the
implementation of oft-repeated
recommendations. The salary of
the Director of Humanities
Placement will be financed by the
imposition of fees for placement
services previously offered free to
Stanford alumni.
In line with the widespread
student interest in socially
relevant careers, the Placement
Service is working closely with
SCIP — Socially Concerned
Industrial Placement—a group
headed by grad students Ben Segal
and (Jregg Dixon, and with several
SWOPSI groups who are exploring
opportunities in such fields as
urban development, ecology,
education and race relations.
