# Taylor Doubtful On 11th Game
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
There is only a slim possibility that Stanford will exercise its
option to schedule an 1 Ith football game in the future, thereby taking
advantage of last week's NCAA decision permitting such a game.
Athletic Director Charles A. Taylor, ju*t back from the NCAA
meetings in Washington, told the I)ail > that although "at this time we
haven't even had a chance to think about it, I'm not too enthused
about the proposal."
Taylor plans to discuss the possibility of scheduling an 11th game
with his assistants and the University administration early this week
before coming to a final decision.
He said that an 11th game could be "worthwhile"if it were against
"the right team at the right time in the right place." Taylor expressed
wariness at pushing the season's last game any closer to dead week and
finals and equal reluctance at playing any more games before the
opening of school in September.
"It would be a question of finding the appropriate opponent."
Taylor said, "So few teams draw well out here." It is believed that the
'right team' would most likely be an intersectional opponent.
Taylor let it be known that at a meeting prior to last week's NCAA
conference the directors of the Pacific-8, realizing that the issue would
be brought up in Washington, had discussed and approved—though
not unanimously —the concept of an 1 1 game schedule. Stanlord s
athletic director termed the NCAA move "permissive legislation"
giving individual teams the right to exercise or reject the lltli game.
No teams are obligated to play an 11th game, regardless of the
position of their conference.

The longer season has been suggested for several years, but
approval was delayed until it became clear that increasingly large
athletic expenses warranted another game. Now that such a contest
has been authorized, speculation has already centered on the
possibilities of such glamour match-ups as Penn State-Texas,
Missouri-USC and Notre Dame-Michigan.
Ot course, financially, no Stanford game could do better than a
second Bin Game with Cal. But Taylor, commenting that suggestions
to open and close the season with Cal were not new, played down that
possibility.
Other ramifications of the 11th game option include increased
television revenue for the NCAA and the chance that an even longer
schedule would further inflame those portions of the academic
community already disturbed about the huge investment which goes
into the college game. ABC-TV, which televises college football under
contract to the NCAA, has indicated that it would be favorable to any
number of attractive games.

Taylor said, "So few teams draw well out here." It is believed that the
'right team' would most likely be an intersectional opponent.
Taylor let it be known that at a meeting prior to last week's NCAA
conference the directors of the Pacific-8, realizing that the issue would
be brought up in Washington, had discussed and approved—though
not unanimously —the concept of an 1 1 game schedule. Stanlord s
athletic director termed the NCAA move "permissive legislation"
giving individual teams the right to exercise or reject the lltli game.
No teams are obligated to play an 11th game, regardless of the
position of their conference.

The longer season has been suggested for several years, but
approval was delayed until it became clear that increasingly large
athletic expenses warranted another game. Now that such a contest
has been authorized, speculation has already centered on the
possibilities of such glamour match-ups as Penn State-Texas,
Missouri-USC and Notre Dame-Michigan.
Ot course, financially, no Stanford game could do better than a
second Bin Game with Cal. But Taylor, commenting that suggestions
to open and close the season with Cal were not new, played down that
possibility.
Other ramifications of the 11th game option include increased
television revenue for the NCAA and the chance that an even longer
schedule would further inflame those portions of the academic
community already disturbed about the huge investment which goes
into the college game. ABC-TV, which televises college football under
contract to the NCAA, has indicated that it would be favorable to any
number of attractive games.
