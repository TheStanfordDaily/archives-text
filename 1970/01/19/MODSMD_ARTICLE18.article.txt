# Ruggers Annihilate Piedmont Club, 51-8
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
The Piedmont fullback took a
long time getting up. Wade
Killefer had just run over him for
Stanford's seventh successful try
of the first half.
At the end of the full eighty
minutes, Piedmont was left
wondering why every time they
looked around Stanford's elusive
backs were crossing their goal line,
Don Bunce was left with a big
headache, and the Indians were
left with a more than comfortable
cushion in the scoring column,
51-8.
Individual stars were difficult
to isolate, but Jim Kauffman put
on another dazzling display of
speed, scoring three tries, Steward
Wilson played even above his
advance press clippings, and Jack
Schultz turned in a generally
outstanding performance. Chuck
Williams was instrumental,
assisting on many of the tries, and
Wade Killefer and Jack Lasater
accounted for twelve points
between them.
Piedmont was never in it.
Breaks, Pat Preston, Leon
Hartvickson, and Jerry Dover
successfully prevented the
Piedmont club from generating
much of an offense by
interrupting the continuity of its
attack before it could get started.
On the other side of the coin,
Scrum Half Jim Squeri, got the
ball out to Stanford's backs
consistently all afternoon and
every time the ball started down
the line the threat to go all the
way became a very real one.

Before the fans had even found
a good vantage point around the
alternate field where the game was
played due to soggy conditions on
the regular varsity turf, Jim
Kauffman had put the Trihe on
the scoreboard, carrying across the
goal line after a quick series of
passes from Shultz and Preston.
-Jack Lasater did the honors on
the next try, plunging into the
corner to give Leon Hartvickson
the opportunity to kick his
second conversion of the day. He
split the uprights from a tough
angle.
Stanford controlled a line-out
situation, and Don Bunce passed
off just as he was hit. The play
continued, but Bunce didn't get
up. He'd caught a foot or a knee
to the side of the head and left
the game with the help of his
teammates feeling a little woozy.
He headed for the dressing room
early.
Out on the field, the scoring
spree continued. Kauffman scored
and then Lasater again. Shultz
found some running room down
the sidelines, and on a picture
perfect play, Chuck Williams
teamed up with Kauffman for yet
another successful try.
Killefer's bulldoze job on the
beleagured Piedmont fullback
ended the scoring for the first half
with the Indians enjoying a lead
of 35-0.
Piedmont broke into the
scoring column with a try to open
the second half, but Stanford
wasn't through. It was Killefer
again taking a pass from Steward
Wilson and powering his way
across the goal line.
Then Wilson himself, on the
greatest individual effort of the
afternoon, popped the ball out of
his own end, raced underneath,
fielded it, and dove across the goal
line for the try.
Shultz concluded the scoring
by muscling his way across the
goal line with Stanford's eleventh
try of the day. Piedmont added a
penalty kick as kind of an
afterthought to round off the
afternoon.

He headed for the dressing room
early.
Out on the field, the scoring
spree continued. Kauffman scored
and then Lasater again. Shultz
found some running room down
the sidelines, and on a picture
perfect play, Chuck Williams
teamed up with Kauffman for yet
another successful try.
Killefer's bulldoze job on the
beleagured Piedmont fullback
ended the scoring for the first half
with the Indians enjoying a lead
of 35-0.
Piedmont broke into the
scoring column with a try to open
the second half, but Stanford
wasn't through. It was Killefer
again taking a pass from Steward
Wilson and powering his way
across the goal line.
Then Wilson himself, on the
greatest individual effort of the
afternoon, popped the ball out of
his own end, raced underneath,
fielded it, and dove across the goal
line for the try.
Shultz concluded the scoring
by muscling his way across the
goal line with Stanford's eleventh
try of the day. Piedmont added a
penalty kick as kind of an
afterthought to round off the
afternoon.
The Piedmont fullback took a
long time getting up. Wade
Killefer had just run over him for
Stanford's seventh successful try
of the first half.
At the end of the full eighty
minutes, Piedmont was left
wondering why every time they
looked around Stanford's elusive
backs were crossing their goal line,
Don Bunce was left with a big
headache, and the Indians were
left with a more than comfortable
cushion in the scoring column,
51-8.
Individual stars were difficult
to isolate, but Jim Kauffman put
on another dazzling display of
speed, scoring three tries, Steward
Wilson played even above his
advance press clippings, and Jack
Schultz turned in a generally
outstanding performance. Chuck
Williams was instrumental,
assisting on many of the tries, and
Wade Killefer and Jack Lasater
accounted for twelve points
between them.
Piedmont was never in it.
Breaks, Pat Preston, Leon
Hartvickson, and Jerry Dover
successfully prevented the
Piedmont club from generating
much of an offense by
interrupting the continuity of its
attack before it could get started.
On the other side of the coin,
Scrum Half Jim Squeri, got the
ball out to Stanford's backs
consistently all afternoon and
every time the ball started down
the line the threat to go all the
way became a very real one.

Before the fans had even found
a good vantage point around the
alternate field where the game was
played due to soggy conditions on
the regular varsity turf, Jim
Kauffman had put the Trihe on
the scoreboard, carrying across the
goal line after a quick series of
passes from Shultz and Preston.
-Jack Lasater did the honors on
the next try, plunging into the
corner to give Leon Hartvickson
the opportunity to kick his
second conversion of the day. He
split the uprights from a tough
angle.
Stanford controlled a line-out
situation, and Don Bunce passed
off just as he was hit. The play
continued, but Bunce didn't get
up. He'd caught a foot or a knee
to the side of the head and left
the game with the help of his
teammates feeling a little woozy.
