# Indians Take Thriller By 2
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON FRED LEESON 
Stanford's basketball team finally captured
some of the breaks which had been escaping it for
so long Friday night, defeating California 73-71.
The Indians lost an eleven point lead late in the
game, and when Cal guard Charlie Johnson hit a
bank shot with 57 seconds left for a 71-69 lead,
Stanford seemed on the verge of another
frustrating loss.
But Indian guard Claude Terry hit a 15 foot
jumper with 31 seconds left to knot the score at
71-71. Cal then worked for the Ist shot, but an
errant pass by Bobby White was picked off by
Chuck Moore who passed to Dennis O'Neill who
was fouled on his drive by the frustrated White.
With one second remaining on the clock,
O'Neill calmly hit both ends of a 1 and 1 for the
win.
The Indians started out fast and jumped off to
a 22-12 lead midway through the first half. Led b>
the shooting of Terry and a fine man-to-man
defense, the Cards maintained their ten point
margin for a 44-34 halftime lead.
Bears Came Back
The Tribe kept their ten point advantage
through the first seven minutes of the second half,
but the Bears then made their move. Led by the
shooting of sophomore center Ansley Truitt, the
Bears quickly cut into Stanford's lead until they
tied the game up at 65-65 with 6:05 remaining.
Truitt then hit a free throw to give Cal their first
lead of the night at 66-65.
After a scoreless two minutes, Bill Palmer hit a
jumper for a 67-66 Stanford lead, but Jackie
Ridgle put Cal out in front again by two on a lay
in and a free throw. Stanford tied the game again
at 69-69 with 1:20 left on a pair of clutch free
throws by reserve forward Steve Kuchenbecker
which set the stage for the dramatic final minute
of action.
Stanford shot a fine 47% from the field as they
connected on 27 out of 58 shots. Pacing the
Indians was Terry with 22 points, while O'Neill
added 12 and Moore and Palmer added ten each.
Palmer, who went into the game leading the league
in rebounding, picked up eleven big bounds to lead
both teams. Kuchenbecker played his best game of
the year as he hit on 3 out of 3 from the floor and
two clutch free throws in a substitute role for Fred
Green who got in foul trouble early in the second
half.
California was paced by Truitt with 21 points,
14 of them in the second half. Ridgle added 19
and Johnson picked up 17. The loss dropped the

Bears' record to 7-6, while they share a 1-2 league
record with Stanford. The victory for Stanford
was only their third in twelve starts.
Card Frosh Win
In a preliminary game, Stanford's frosh team
hit on 1 4 of their first 22 shots on their way to an
eleven point halftime lead, and the Indians staved
off a second half Cal rally to coast to an 85-80
victory.
Pacing the little Indians was 6-4 center Pat
Stevens, who picked up 26 points and 20
rebounds. Stevens hit on 10 of 16 field goals and 6
of 7 free throws for an outstanding night. He was
followed in the scoring column by John Stratton
with 16 and Mike Boryla with 13. The Indians
shot a fine 49% from the floor and outrebounded
Cal 59-40.
Next weekend Stanford hosts Wyoming and Air
Force in a pair of non-league contests while the
Frosh, now 3-1, will take on Hamilton Air Force
Base and UC Davis.

"I've about had it," a hoarse
fan rasped during Friday night's
game, "and there's still eight
minutes left."
The Indians have had similar
problems in five earlier
games—either blowing early leads
or losing in the last moments.
After leading Cal for 34 minutes
by margins as big as ten, it looked
like Stanford was about to drop
out of another one.
But not this time.
Pressure defense, sharp
shooting and a fortuitious foul
sent the Bears back disappointed.
In the Stanford dressing room,
the joy of coming back for the
win overshadowed any comment
on a number of fine individual
performances.
F or instance, Steve
Kuchenbecker, a reserve forward
who played perhaps the best game
of his career, wouldn't even talk
about himself. "After five games
of being so close, it was a real
mental victory for us to come
from behind. We really came
through in the clutch, .the whole
team showed a lot of cool."
Including Kuchenbecker, who
filled in for Fred Green and
drilled in three field goals and two
foul shots without missing an
attempt.
Another pressure performance
was turned in by Chuck Moore,
who tallied ten points and seven
rebounds on a badly sprained
instep. "Once we got going it
didn't bother me," he said peeling
off a protective pad, "or at least I
didn't think about it. This was the
most I've moved since it
happened."
Indian center Bill Palmer who
battled impressive Cal sophomore
center Ainsley Truitt
elbow-for-elbow said, "He's the
best center I've faced."
Including Lew Alcindor?
"The best this year." he
corrected.
"Psychologically, we were
really hurting for a win," he
continued. "With this one and a
few more we'll be a much better
team by the end."

California was paced by Truitt with 21 points,
14 of them in the second half. Ridgle added 19

Card Frosh Win
In a preliminary game, Stanford's frosh team

eleven point halftime lead, and the Indians staved
off a second half Cal rally to coast to an 85-80
victory.
Pacing the little Indians was 6-4 center Pat
Stevens, who picked up 26 points and 20
rebounds. Stevens hit on 10 of 16 field goals and 6

Including Kuchenbecker, who
filled in for Fred Green and
drilled in three field goals and two
foul shots without missing an

Another pressure performance
was turned in by Chuck Moore,
who tallied ten points and seven

instep. "Once we got going it
didn't bother me," he said peeling

out of another one.
But not this time.
Pressure defense, sharp
shooting and a fortuitious foul
sent the Bears back disappointed.
In the Stanford dressing room,
the joy of coming back for the
win overshadowed any comment
on a number of fine individual
performances.
F or instance, Steve
Kuchenbecker, a reserve forward
who played perhaps the best game
of his career, wouldn't even talk
about himself. "After five games
of being so close, it was a real
mental victory for us to come
from behind. We really came
through in the clutch, .the whole
team showed a lot of cool."
Including Kuchenbecker, who
filled in for Fred Green and
drilled in three field goals and two
foul shots without missing an
attempt.
Another pressure performance
was turned in by Chuck Moore,
who tallied ten points and seven
rebounds on a badly sprained
instep. "Once we got going it
didn't bother me," he said peeling
off a protective pad, "or at least I
didn't think about it. This was the
most I've moved since it
happened."
Indian center Bill Palmer who
battled impressive Cal sophomore
center Ainsley Truitt
elbow-for-elbow said, "He's the
best center I've faced."
Including Lew Alcindor?
"The best this year." he
corrected.
"Psychologically, we were
really hurting for a win," he
continued. "With this one and a
few more we'll be a much better
team by the end."

Stanford's basketball team finally captured
some of the breaks which had been escaping it for
so long Friday night, defeating California 73-71.
The Indians lost an eleven point lead late in the
game, and when Cal guard Charlie Johnson hit a
bank shot with 57 seconds left for a 71-69 lead,
Stanford seemed on the verge of another
frustrating loss.
But Indian guard Claude Terry hit a 15 foot
jumper with 31 seconds left to knot the score at
71-71. Cal then worked for the Ist shot, but an
errant pass by Bobby White was picked off by
Chuck Moore who passed to Dennis O'Neill who
was fouled on his drive by the frustrated White.
With one second remaining on the clock,
O'Neill calmly hit both ends of a 1 and 1 for the
win.
The Indians started out fast and jumped off to
a 22-12 lead midway through the first half. Led b>
the shooting of Terry and a fine man-to-man
defense, the Cards maintained their ten point
margin for a 44-34 halftime lead.
Bears Came Back
The Tribe kept their ten point advantage
through the first seven minutes of the second half,
but the Bears then made their move. Led by the
shooting of sophomore center Ansley Truitt, the
Bears quickly cut into Stanford's lead until they
tied the game up at 65-65 with 6:05 remaining.
Truitt then hit a free throw to give Cal their first
lead of the night at 66-65.
After a scoreless two minutes, Bill Palmer hit a
jumper for a 67-66 Stanford lead, but Jackie
Ridgle put Cal out in front again by two on a lay
in and a free throw. Stanford tied the game again
at 69-69 with 1:20 left on a pair of clutch free
throws by reserve forward Steve Kuchenbecker
which set the stage for the dramatic final minute
of action.
Stanford shot a fine 47% from the field as they
connected on 27 out of 58 shots. Pacing the
Indians was Terry with 22 points, while O'Neill
added 12 and Moore and Palmer added ten each.
Palmer, who went into the game leading the league
in rebounding, picked up eleven big bounds to lead
both teams. Kuchenbecker played his best game of
the year as he hit on 3 out of 3 from the floor and
two clutch free throws in a substitute role for Fred
Green who got in foul trouble early in the second
half.
California was paced by Truitt with 21 points,
14 of them in the second half. Ridgle added 19
and Johnson picked up 17. The loss dropped the

Bears' record to 7-6, while they share a 1-2 league
record with Stanford. The victory for Stanford
was only their third in twelve starts.
Card Frosh Win
In a preliminary game, Stanford's frosh team
hit on 1 4 of their first 22 shots on their way to an
eleven point halftime lead, and the Indians staved
off a second half Cal rally to coast to an 85-80
victory.
Pacing the little Indians was 6-4 center Pat
Stevens, who picked up 26 points and 20
rebounds. Stevens hit on 10 of 16 field goals and 6
of 7 free throws for an outstanding night. He was
followed in the scoring column by John Stratton
with 16 and Mike Boryla with 13. The Indians
shot a fine 49% from the floor and outrebounded
Cal 59-40.
Next weekend Stanford hosts Wyoming and Air
Force in a pair of non-league contests while the
Frosh, now 3-1, will take on Hamilton Air Force
Base and UC Davis.

"I've about had it," a hoarse
fan rasped during Friday night's
game, "and there's still eight
minutes left."
The Indians have had similar
problems in five earlier
games—either blowing early leads
or losing in the last moments.
