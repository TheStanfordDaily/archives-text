# ASSU Insurance Costs Jump 85,000%
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Student protest across the
nation has provoked varied and
unexpected reactions.
One major and often
unmentioned result of student
unrest has been the increased
reluctance of insurance companies
to cover university organizations
such as Stanford's ASSU. The
ASSU, in fact, is an excellent
example of the problems
university organizations are
presently facing in obtaining
adequate coverage.
In the past, the ASSU had a
general liability policy which
covered three things: bodily
injury up to $100,000 or
$1,000,000 depending on the
number of persons involved,
property damage up to $100,000,
and personal injury (i.e. libel,
slander) up to $100,000. The
premium ASSU paid for such a
policy was $300 a year.
This year, when the ASSU's
three year policy with the
Fireman's Fund expired and the
ASSU went to renew it.the

premium for exactly the same
policy was $250,000 a year. To
put this another way, the
premium was raised
approximately 85,000%, an
increase which David Swift,
student financial manager, termed
"hardly inflationary."
One in Filly
Eventually, the ASSU
contacted Marshall McClennan,
the brokerage firm, who in turn
contacted over fifty insurance
companies for the ASSU. Out of
these fifty, there was only one
who was willing to carry the
ASSU, this, in spite of the fact
that the ASSU, in the words of
Swift, "doesn't have a blemish on
its record."
The Insurance Company of
North America, INA, was willing
to cover bodily injury up to
$10,000 and property damage up
to $5,000 for a premium of
$7,500. The ASSU finally agreed
with INA on a policy in which
coverage for bodily injury was
$300,000 and $100,000 for
property damage. No personal

injury insurance was available.
The cost of this policy was
$10,000 a year. Due to the fact
that it was a seller's market and
that the ASSU had to be covered,
this was the best the ASSU could
do.
Private Procedures
In view of the difficulty
obtaining what he thought to be a
fair and reasonable policy, Swift
requested information on the
underwriting procedures of the
various insurance companies and
received what he termed, "totaliy
unsatisfactory replies."
The insurance company
position, says Swift, was that in
covering an organization such as
the ASSU they were dealing
totally in the dark. There was no
way, they claimed, to follow past
underwriting practices or to
scientifically arrive at a figure.
Swift feels that a solution to this
problem might be that the
insurance companies, after a
year-end audit of the class of
insurees in which the ASSU falls,
take off their percentage profit

and rebate those organizations
such as the / SSU which were
overcharged. Lut the insurance
companies, said Swift, were not
overly responsive to this idea.
The type of situation the
insurance companies are apparently
scared of is one in which members
of an ASSU organization commit
some action resulting in a large
suit, in which, as in a case in Ohio,
an unincorporated organization
such as the ASSU could be held
responsible.
'Reagan Viewpoint'
Swift feels that the main
reason that insurance rates are
almost prohibitively high for
university organizations is that the
insurance companies have adopted
a "Reagan point of view, in which
the campus is looked upon as a
place which is fomenting
revolutionaries, and where people
act irrationally."
As long as this view is prevalent
in the outside world, says Swift,
the insurance companies will be
able to justify their exorbitant
rates.

university organizations are
presently facing in obtaining
adequate coverage.
In the past, the ASSU had a
general liability policy which
covered three things: bodily
injury up to $100,000 or
$1,000,000 depending on the
number of persons involved,
property damage up to $100,000,
and personal injury (i.e. libel,
slander) up to $100,000. The
premium ASSU paid for such a
policy was $300 a year.
This year, when the ASSU's
three year policy with the
Fireman's Fund expired and the
ASSU went to renew it.the

premium for exactly the same
policy was $250,000 a year. To
put this another way, the
premium was raised
approximately 85,000%, an
increase which David Swift,
student financial manager, termed
"hardly inflationary."
One in Filly
Eventually, the ASSU
contacted Marshall McClennan,
the brokerage firm, who in turn
contacted over fifty insurance
companies for the ASSU. Out of
these fifty, there was only one
who was willing to carry the
ASSU, this, in spite of the fact
that the ASSU, in the words of
Swift, "doesn't have a blemish on
its record."
The Insurance Company of
North America, INA, was willing
to cover bodily injury up to
$10,000 and property damage up
to $5,000 for a premium of
$7,500. The ASSU finally agreed
with INA on a policy in which
coverage for bodily injury was
$300,000 and $100,000 for
property damage. No personal

injury insurance was available.
The cost of this policy was
$10,000 a year. Due to the fact
that it was a seller's market and
that the ASSU had to be covered,
this was the best the ASSU could
do.
Private Procedures
In view of the difficulty
obtaining what he thought to be a
fair and reasonable policy, Swift
requested information on the
underwriting procedures of the
various insurance companies and
received what he termed, "totaliy
unsatisfactory replies."
The insurance company
position, says Swift, was that in
covering an organization such as
the ASSU they were dealing
totally in the dark. There was no
way, they claimed, to follow past
underwriting practices or to
scientifically arrive at a figure.
Swift feels that a solution to this
problem might be that the
insurance companies, after a
year-end audit of the class of
insurees in which the ASSU falls,
take off their percentage profit

and rebate those organizations
such as the / SSU which were
overcharged. Lut the insurance
companies, said Swift, were not
overly responsive to this idea.
The type of situation the
insurance companies are apparently
scared of is one in which members
of an ASSU organization commit
some action resulting in a large
suit, in which, as in a case in Ohio,
an unincorporated organization
such as the ASSU could be held
responsible.
'Reagan Viewpoint'
Swift feels that the main
reason that insurance rates are
almost prohibitively high for
university organizations is that the
insurance companies have adopted
a "Reagan point of view, in which
the campus is looked upon as a
place which is fomenting
revolutionaries, and where people
act irrationally."
As long as this view is prevalent
in the outside world, says Swift,
the insurance companies will be
able to justify their exorbitant
rates.
Student protest across the
nation has provoked varied and
unexpected reactions.
One major and often
unmentioned result of student
unrest has been the increased
reluctance of insurance companies
to cover university organizations
such as Stanford's ASSU. The
ASSU, in fact, is an excellent
example of the problems
university organizations are
