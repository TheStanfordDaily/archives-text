# Card Merman Drown Cougars

### DOUG WILSON 
One down and none to go for
the Stanford swimmers.
The next ones might not be so
easy.
In its dual-meet and Pacific-8
opener at Encina pool Saturday
afternoon, the Stanford Indians
overpowered Washington State,
86-27. The Indians swept every
event except for the butterfly and
the 400-yd. freestyle relay, which
were won by the Cougars, and the
200-yd. backstroke (won by
Stanford's Fred Haywood), in
which Washington State's Brad
Story edged sophomore Rob
Wooley for second-place honors.
The Indian medley relay team
of Woolley, Jim Morris, Terry
Foote, and Bob Warren set the
precedent for the rest of the
afternoon's events, winning the
race with a time of 3:43.8.
Freshman Tim Broderick, with a
time of 10.1 2.6, beat teammate
Mark Shelley for a victory in the
1000-yd. freestyle; Stanford's
John Glaser edged out WSU's Nix
to finish second to freshman Steve
Carey in the 200-yd. freestyle
(Carey's time: 1:49.0); and junior

Rick Eagelston posted a 22.5 to
win the 50-yd. freestyle, followed
by frosh sprinter Ollie Press and
soph freestyler Bill Huck.
Ferris Blazes
John Ferris, the Indians'
NCAA butterfly champion,
demonstrated his prowess as an
all-around swimmer, beating
teammate Dave Schilling in the
200-yd. individual medley. Ferris's
time of 1:59.8 unofficially puts
him second in the nation so far,
behind Texas' Doug Russell.
Also posting 1-2 finishes were
Bob Jamison and Ray Collins
(100 freestyle—47.B by Jamison);
Brent Berk and Bert Mason in the
500-yd. freestyle (4:51.9 by
Berk); and freshman breaststroke
ace Brian Job, edging
NCAA-runner-up Schilling with a
best-in-the-nation time of 2:09.5.
In the 200-yd. backstroke,
Haywood posted a time of 1:59.4.
Placing 1-2 in both the 1-meter
and 3-meter diving events were
Bill Main and Ted Nichols. Main
scored 280.5 points in the 1-meter
event, and later came back to win
his second round of diving with

320.2 points from the 3-meter
competition.
Washington State's Dan
Yielding overtook Stanford
butterflier on the fifth of eight
lengths of the butterfly race to
win the 200-yd. event in 2:06.5.
Cougar teammate Rob Jackson
placed second. And, in what can
only be described as a gesture of
mercy toward the unfortunate
Cougars, Steve Carey, anchorman
on the Indians' 400-yd. freestyle
relay, missed a turn and
Washington State won their
second—and last—event of the
day.
Next week, Stanford meets the
first of several top collegiate
squads scheduled this year when
the University of Washington
visits Encina pool Friday, Jan. 23,
at 3 p.m. Several Huskie freshmen
dominate the national statistics,
notably breast-stroker Rick
Colella, whose time of 2:11.3 for
200-yds. had been top-ranked
nationally-until last Saturday,
Stanford, and Job.
At any rate, Washington State's
amicable coach Doug Gibb was, if
disappointed, also impressed. His
pick for the Pac-8 title:
"Stanford."


BIG WHEEL: Stanford's John Ferris, who competes in several events, swam the
200 yard individual medley in 1:59.8 Saturday to unofficially put him second in
the nation in thai event. The Tribe routed Washington State's Cougars, 86 27.
