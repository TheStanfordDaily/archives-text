# Gymnasts Conquer Sacramento Squad
## 
### 
Led by Rich Jerome and Steve
Rochell, Stanford gymnasts won
four of six events Saturday night
and defeated Sacramento State
134.2 to 123 in the Tribe's 1970
home debut.
Stanford's point total was a
new school record, as was the
estimated crowd of 400 which
nearly filled Encina Pavilion for
the smooth two hour
performance.
Jerome, a freshman, led all
competitors in three events while
compiling a total of 47.25 points
to win easily all-around honors.
Sacramento's Jim Fisher trailed
with 41.85.
Rochell led the field on the
rings, earning considerable fan
appreciation along with his 8.55
score. He also scored 8.0 on the
parallel bars for third place in that
event.
Jerome placed first in vaulting
(8.55), parallel bars (8.4) and
highbar, where his 8.7 was the
best mark registered by anybody
in any event.
Fisher's 8.65 in free exercise
was the best individual
performance by Sacramento

State. Ten is the maximum
possible, eight is very good.
Other high Stanford scores
were earned by Murray Kephart in
free exercise (7.65), Dennis
Mesick on the side horse (7.25),
Ted Miyamoto vaulting (7.65) and
on the parallel bars (7.3).
Over cookies in his office
afterward, Coach Dan Millman
said, "Most members of the team
hit about the best they've ever hit,
but there's still room for
improvement."
Sacramento out-scored
Stanford 24.3 to 22.9 in free
exercise but the Tribe took the
team lead on the side horse, the
second event, and never
relinquished it.
The visiting Hornets eked out a
23.50-23.05 edge in vaulting but
lost points badly on the high bar
where they were out-scored 23.2
to 17.25. '
With their season record now
1-1, Stanford gymnasts travel to
Santa Barbara next Saturday for a
meet with UCSB. Next home
action is Feb. 14 against
Washington and San Jose State.
