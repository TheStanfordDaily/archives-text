# Med Center Initiates New Jobs Program
## 
### 
A new program to provide
training and job opportunity for
disadvantaged groups and to
increase the supply of paramedical
personnel will be initiated at the
medical center.
Implementation of the first
phase of the three-fold
Intergraded Assistant Program and
planning of the second phase will
be funded by a $65,000 grant to
the Medical Center from Carnegie
Corporation of New York.
Awarding of the grant was
announced today by the Carnegie
Corporation. Long range funding
for Phases II and 111 in still being
sought from federal and private
sources.
Initially participants will be
instructed in the basic areas of
language, writing, reading and
mathematics. They will be granted
time off to work at one of four
proposed instructional terminals
located in the Medical Center.
These terminals will handle 240
lessons a dav.
Utilization of the computer
will be under the direction of Max
German, a member of the Staff of
Dr. Patrick Suppes, professor of
statistics at Stanford.

The educational courses
provided by the computer will be
sufficient to allow students, after
completion, to be tested through a
local district and receive their high
school diplomas.
