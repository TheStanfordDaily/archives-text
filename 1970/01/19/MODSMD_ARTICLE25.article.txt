# With Student Mobe
## Moratorium Meetings 
### 
In keeping with its expressed
desire of decentralizing
organization, the Stanford
Moratorium, in conjunction with
the Student Moblization
Committee, has planned four
meetings for this week to organize
action groups in the various
dorms.
The action groups, to be
modeled after the 94 groups in
the community, will offer
individual students in the dorms
an opportunity to discuss the
directions that they would like to
see the moratorium take on a
local level, and plan action they
would like to take on their own
initiative.
The program tor the meetings

will be partly informational.
Moratorium leaders will discuss
the past tactics, such as marches,
rallies and communities, and their
limitations as tactics for the
future.
The schedule for the dorm
meetings this week is as follows:
For The Stern Houses—Serra
Hall Lounge—Monday, 6:30 p.m.
F or The Wilbur
