# Foothills Hassle
## Coyote Hill Irregularities Cited In Court Hearing 
### 
Stanford and the Committee
for Green Foothills faced each
other in court Friday for the first
time in the dispute over

Stanford's subdivision of the land
around Coyote Hill.
The Committee, in its
complaint, had charged that

Stanford underwent procedural
irregularities in its obtaining
permission for subdivision of the
Coyote Hill area, enabling
development of the area for light
industry. Stanford claims that the
Committee charges were
unfounded and that the complaint
was merely an attempt to hinder
potential development of the area.
Judge James B. Scott, of the
Santa Clara Superior Court, heard
Attorney James Danaher state
that there were two causes for
action against Stanford. First of
all, Danaher said, "Stanford, when
it originally applied for division of
the land into four sections,
already had plans to further
subdivide the land." Stanford
applied for division into only four
sections merely to avoid certain
legal restrictions, he claimed. He
also charged that Palo Alto
Planning Commissioner Lewis
Fourcroy overstepped his legal
powers in granting Stanford
permission to carry out certain
improvements on the land.
Second, when the Palo Alto
City Council voted on subdivision
of the Coyote Hill Area and
approved the subdivision by a
vote of 5 to 4, two of the
Councilmen voting had conflicts
of interest, Danaher said. One was

a Stanford employee and the
other a potential contractor in the
Coyote Hill area
Stanford counsel Frederick
Koenig, of McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown, and Enerson, claimed that
at all times Stanford had been in
total compliance with local and
state ordinances and that
Stanford's alleged intent to
further subdivide the land at the
time of application for the
original four divisions certainly
was not enough to constitute a
cause of action
City attorney James
Hi I debrand, referring to the
conflict of interests referred to by
Hanaher, said that because Coyote
Hill was a non-contractual matter,
and because both Councilmen
stated their financial interest in
the area priot to voting, there was
no violation of the law.
Hi Ide brand also staled that
Planning Commissioner had in no
way over stepped his legal powers.
The Committee now has ten
days to submit briefs, followed by
ten days in which Stanford must
submit briefs. Judge Scott will
then have 90 days to decide if
there is a cause for action.

powers in granting Stanford
permission to carry out certain
improvements on the land.
Second, when the Palo Alto
City Council voted on subdivision
of the Coyote Hill Area and
approved the subdivision by a
vote of 5 to 4, two of the
Councilmen voting had conflicts
of interest, Danaher said. One was

a Stanford employee and the
other a potential contractor in the
Coyote Hill area
Stanford counsel Frederick
Koenig, of McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown, and Enerson, claimed that
at all times Stanford had been in
total compliance with local and
state ordinances and that
Stanford's alleged intent to
further subdivide the land at the
time of application for the
original four divisions certainly
was not enough to constitute a
cause of action
City attorney James
Hi I debrand, referring to the
conflict of interests referred to by
Hanaher, said that because Coyote
Hill was a non-contractual matter,
and because both Councilmen
stated their financial interest in
the area priot to voting, there was
no violation of the law.
Hi Ide brand also staled that
Planning Commissioner had in no
way over stepped his legal powers.
The Committee now has ten
days to submit briefs, followed by
ten days in which Stanford must
submit briefs. Judge Scott will
then have 90 days to decide if
there is a cause for action.
