# Senate, Admin Fight Expected Over Yale
## 
### 
The administration and student
Senate head for a showdown this
week over student nominations to
trustee committees.
Officials from the President's
office have indicated they are
unwilling to change their veto of
Yale Braunstein's nomination to
the trustee finance committee.
Last Thursday the student Senate
rescinded the nominations of all
eight students on trustee
committees because President
Pi t z e r denied Braunstein's
nomination.
Provost Richard Lyman
commenting on the Senate action
said, "I regret it very much and
hope they will reconsider."
Lyman also said that clear legal
issues are involved in the veto
decision and does not see much
hope for a compromise on the
issue.
President Pitzer has been out
of town since before the Senate
meeting. However, Presidential
Executive Assistant Frederick
Glover said, "We told Yale that he
wasn't going to be nominated."
Glover continued that all students
were nominated in good faith.
The student Senate has refused

to agree with President Pitzer that
Braunstein cannot serve on
committees because he is on
probation. Many senators believe
Pitzer's veto shows that the
Senate does not really appoint
students to committees.
By withdrawing the
nominations of all students to the
trustee committees, "The Senate
served notice that it will not
pretend there are student
representatives where there really
aren't," according to Braunstein.
The Senate made the
nominations two weeks ago.
Senate Chairman Dave Edwards
said that the nominations were
made "in toto" and that when
Pitzer vetoed Braunstein's
nomination he "completely
negated our consent right then
and there."
Confusion arose after Pitzer's
veto because Braunstein was never
formally notified of the action.
Pitzer sent a letter to John Grube,
chairman of the Nominations
committee, informing him of the
veto, but Braunstein did not
receive a copy.
The eight students who had
been nominated for trustee
committees will hold a meeting on
Wednesday to decide what action
to take. But they are no longer
official student representatives
according to Edwards.
Senators disagreed on the
possibility of a compromise.
Edwards and Senate
Vice-chairman John Shoch agreed
that they are willing to
compromise and think something
can be arranged. However,
Braunstein said, "Compromise is
possible, but I don't think it's
likely."
