Leo Bazile was re-elected
chairman of the Black Student
Union during a meeting yesterday
afternoon.
Elected by acclamation were:
Jon Sylvester, vice-chairman;
Channing Johnson, treasurer;
Debbv Fields, corresponding
secretary; and Rita Bernstein,
recording secretary.
About 70 blacks attended the
elections, held in 270 Tresidder.
There are about 350 black
students on campus.
Chairman Bazile opened the
meeting and cited two problems

that the BSU will face during the
months ahead. Hp said that many
of the BSU programs were being
held up by the University
administration and that a smooth
transition of leadership was
necessary for the group.
The group then proceeded to
elect new officers. There were
originally two nominations for
Chairman: Bazile and Jake Carter.
A question and answer session
followed, after which Robert
Wilson, a freshman, became the
third candidate for Chairman.
Wilson challenged the current

weight of upperclassmen on the
BSU's Executive Commit too.
Considerable debate ensued
concerning the restructuring of
the BSU's executive structure. A
caucus was held to consider the
proposals.
After a recess, a new plan of
executive control was presented
to the assembly. The proposal
included a sharing of the office of
Chairman. After debate, the
elections were held and Bay.ilt* was
elected Chairman, thus rejecting
the proposal.
