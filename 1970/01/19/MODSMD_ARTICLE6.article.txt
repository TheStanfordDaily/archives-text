# Dean Calls For Group To Study Nation's Goals
## 
### SUSAN MAAS 
A national goals institute
should be established to study
objectively the nation's priorities,
Arjay Miller, dean of the School
of Business, told last week's
Forum on National Priorities.
Although having no legislative
power, the organization would
supply information on which
intelligent choices could be made.
Miller also said that shortages
in public goods today are in such
areas as education, housing, and
the environment, for which there
is no normal market mechanism.
Their needs must therefore be
provided through the political
process.
Other participants at the
three-day Stanford forum
included political science
professor Robert C. North;
Leonard A. Lecht, director of the
Center for Priority Analysis of the
National Planning Association;
congressmen Paul M. McCloskey
(R-Calif.) and Henry S. Reuss
(D-Wisc.); John R. Stark,
executive director of the Joint
Economic Committee of
Congress; and G. William
Domhoff, professor of psychology
at the University of California,
Santa Cruz.
Upside-down Priorities
Opening the speeches, Prof.

North declared that "the priorities
of the world are upside-down.
"We have never before lived in
anything like the kind of world
we live in now," he continued.
Before, tribes had been buffered
from each other, but now we are
all living "cheek to jowl."
Because of this, "the
environment we are shaping
changes so rapidly our institutions
are inadequate to handle the
problems." New priorities should
make the abundant life available
to all, and form new institutions
to substitute for the present
nation-state system.
Public Decisions
John Stark called for more
effective decision-making in the
public sector, criticizing the fact
that "military programs account
for half of the federal budget.
"There is no objective
mechanism in Congress to
establish priorities," he stated,
suggesting that Congress consider
the budget in its entirety rather
than in chunks, perhaps establish
a supercommittee for this.
Consideration would include
the total requirements of the
nation, apportionment of the
budget, and estimation of the
level of revenue available to
Congress.

"Priorities are made by heads
of big corporations—the power
elite of America," Prof. Domhoff
said.
Power F.liJe
This elite controls priorities
primarily through appointments
to the government and through
blue ribbon commissions, which
consist of "11 or 12 businessmen,
one woman, one black, and good
old George Meany." Many of the
same people make up different
commissions.
"We are heading for a
corporate America,"he stated,
"and I think America will
acquiesce in this." Domhoff
would like to see a leveling of
economic positions, but added, "I
am cynical of change."
Prof. Martin Carnoy declared
that "we have got to liberate the
corporate structure" by making it
less competitive and more
democratic. "We may not be able
to do it,"he added, "but that's
where the problem is."
Need To Win
He compared militarism and
the corporate form as two
different forms or the
competitiveness taught us from
childhood. "We compete with
Russia because we have a great
desire to win, to be the best
man." Carnoy believed only
democratic election of
corporation boards by workers
would save corporations, but he
was uncertain that business would
accept the idea.
"There are two overriding
priorities that don't appear on
most lists," Harold Willens,
Chairman of the Businessmen's
Educational Fund, stated, "first,
getting rid of our besetting fear of
communism, and second, bringing
our military under public
control.
"Seventy percent of the
nonfixed budget goes to the
military, and only 11 percent to
the building of America,"he said.
"We are caught up in a madness.
As we increase our military
power, we decrease our national
security. We may already be a de
facto military state."
Vietnam A Mistake
Congressman Reuss also
complained about the amount of
the budget going to the military
establishment, while "we are short
on programs affecting the quality
of life."
"Vietnam is our country's
greatest mistake, but it can
become our great opportunity, if
it causes a reordering of our
priorities." He concluded that
fighting communism is a mistake,
because "orthodox communism
can't survive prosperity."
He called for the 1970's to be
"the decade of the environment,"
dedicated to cleaning up air,
water, and soil, as well as
"reconstructing urban life."
Both Congressmen Reuss and
McCloskey said the Congressional
seniority system should be
abandoned.
The Forum was sponsored by
Stanford and the Stanford
Research Institute.

competitiveness taught us from
childhood. "We compete with
Russia because we have a great
desire to win, to be the best
man." Carnoy believed only
democratic election of
corporation boards by workers
would save corporations, but he
was uncertain that business would
accept the idea.
"There are two overriding
priorities that don't appear on
most lists," Harold Willens,
Chairman of the Businessmen's
Educational Fund, stated, "first,
getting rid of our besetting fear of
communism, and second, bringing
our military under public
control.
"Seventy percent of the
nonfixed budget goes to the
military, and only 11 percent to
the building of America,"he said.
"We are caught up in a madness.
As we increase our military
power, we decrease our national
security. We may already be a de
facto military state."
Vietnam A Mistake
Congressman Reuss also
complained about the amount of
the budget going to the military
establishment, while "we are short
on programs affecting the quality
of life."
"Vietnam is our country's
greatest mistake, but it can
become our great opportunity, if
it causes a reordering of our
priorities." He concluded that
fighting communism is a mistake,
because "orthodox communism
can't survive prosperity."
He called for the 1970's to be
"the decade of the environment,"
dedicated to cleaning up air,
water, and soil, as well as
"reconstructing urban life."
Both Congressmen Reuss and
McCloskey said the Congressional
seniority system should be
abandoned.
The Forum was sponsored by
Stanford and the Stanford
Research Institute.
A national goals institute
should be established to study
objectively the nation's priorities,
Arjay Miller, dean of the School
of Business, told last week's
Forum on National Priorities.
Although having no legislative
power, the organization would
supply information on which
intelligent choices could be made.
Miller also said that shortages
in public goods today are in such
areas as education, housing, and
the environment, for which there
is no normal market mechanism.
Their needs must therefore be
provided through the political
process.
Other participants at the
three-day Stanford forum
included political science
professor Robert C. North;
Leonard A. Lecht, director of the
Center for Priority Analysis of the
National Planning Association;
congressmen Paul M. McCloskey
(R-Calif.) and Henry S. Reuss
(D-Wisc.); John R. Stark,
executive director of the Joint
Economic Committee of
Congress; and G. William
Domhoff, professor of psychology
at the University of California,
Santa Cruz.
Upside-down Priorities
Opening the speeches, Prof.

North declared that "the priorities
of the world are upside-down.
"We have never before lived in
anything like the kind of world
we live in now," he continued.
Before, tribes had been buffered
from each other, but now we are
all living "cheek to jowl."
Because of this, "the
environment we are shaping
changes so rapidly our institutions
are inadequate to handle the
problems." New priorities should
make the abundant life available
to all, and form new institutions
to substitute for the present
nation-state system.
Public Decisions
John Stark called for more
effective decision-making in the
public sector, criticizing the fact
that "military programs account
for half of the federal budget.
"There is no objective
mechanism in Congress to
establish priorities," he stated,
suggesting that Congress consider
the budget in its entirety rather
than in chunks, perhaps establish
a supercommittee for this.
Consideration would include
the total requirements of the
nation, apportionment of the
budget, and estimation of the
level of revenue available to
Congress.

"Priorities are made by heads
of big corporations—the power
elite of America," Prof. Domhoff
said.
Power F.liJe
This elite controls priorities
primarily through appointments
to the government and through
blue ribbon commissions, which
consist of "11 or 12 businessmen,
one woman, one black, and good
old George Meany." Many of the
same people make up different
commissions.
"We are heading for a
corporate America,"he stated,
"and I think America will
acquiesce in this." Domhoff
would like to see a leveling of
economic positions, but added, "I
am cynical of change."
Prof. Martin Carnoy declared
that "we have got to liberate the
corporate structure" by making it
less competitive and more
democratic. "We may not be able
to do it,"he added, "but that's
where the problem is."
Need To Win
He compared militarism and
the corporate form as two

make the abundant life available
to all, and form new institutions
to substitute for the present
nation-state system.
Public Decisions
John Stark called for more
effective decision-making in the
public sector, criticizing the fact
that "military programs account
for half of the federal budget.
"There is no objective
mechanism in Congress to
establish priorities," he stated,
suggesting that Congress consider
the budget in its entirety rather
than in chunks, perhaps establish
a supercommittee for this.
Consideration would include
the total requirements of the
nation, apportionment of the
budget, and estimation of the
level of revenue available to
Congress.

"Priorities are made by heads
of big corporations—the power
elite of America," Prof. Domhoff
said.
Power F.liJe
This elite controls priorities
primarily through appointments
to the government and through
blue ribbon commissions, which
consist of "11 or 12 businessmen,
one woman, one black, and good
old George Meany." Many of the
same people make up different
commissions.
"We are heading for a
corporate America,"he stated,
"and I think America will
acquiesce in this." Domhoff
would like to see a leveling of
economic positions, but added, "I
am cynical of change."
Prof. Martin Carnoy declared
that "we have got to liberate the
corporate structure" by making it
less competitive and more
democratic. "We may not be able
to do it,"he added, "but that's
where the problem is."
Need To Win
He compared militarism and
the corporate form as two
different forms or the
competitiveness taught us from
childhood. "We compete with
Russia because we have a great
desire to win, to be the best
man." Carnoy believed only
democratic election of
corporation boards by workers
would save corporations, but he
was uncertain that business would
accept the idea.
"There are two overriding
priorities that don't appear on
most lists," Harold Willens,
Chairman of the Businessmen's
Educational Fund, stated, "first,
getting rid of our besetting fear of
communism, and second, bringing
our military under public
control.
"Seventy percent of the
nonfixed budget goes to the
military, and only 11 percent to
the building of America,"he said.
"We are caught up in a madness.
As we increase our military
power, we decrease our national
security. We may already be a de
facto military state."
Vietnam A Mistake
Congressman Reuss also
complained about the amount of
the budget going to the military
establishment, while "we are short
on programs affecting the quality
of life."
"Vietnam is our country's
greatest mistake, but it can
become our great opportunity, if
it causes a reordering of our
priorities." He concluded that
fighting communism is a mistake,
because "orthodox communism
can't survive prosperity."
He called for the 1970's to be
"the decade of the environment,"
dedicated to cleaning up air,
water, and soil, as well as
"reconstructing urban life."
Both Congressmen Reuss and
McCloskey said the Congressional
seniority system should be
abandoned.

Stanford and the Stanford
