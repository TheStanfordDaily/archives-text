## University Replies To 'Grass Roots' 
### Boyd Smith 
So many inaccurate and misleading statements about
Stanford land development have appeared in l)ail>
columns in recent weeks and in the literature of "Grass
Roots" that it is impossible to respond to all of them.
Some of the points raised have been substantive ones, but
many others have been so absurd that it is difficult to take
them seriously. Let me deal first with some of the general
themes that run through most of the arguments.
Theme no. I—"The people have absolutely no say in
how Stanford lands shall be used."
This is a ridiculous, and actually dishonest, statement.
The voters of the area have always decided, and are still
deciding, how Stanford lands can be developed. Before any
development steps are taken, the University requests
annexation and prezoning to a neighboring community.
The community has complete power to establish land use
and to accept or reject annexation. Community members
are given the opportunity to express their opinions through
public hearings which are held before planning
commissions and city councils. In the end, land use policy
is set by elected representatives of the people.
The actions of these representatives are open to direct
challenge by public referendum. After land use is
established, but before any development can take place,
public hearings are held again before planning commissions
and city councils to comply with state subdivision law.
Before a parcel of land can be developed, the public is
given the opportunity to voice its opinion on at least six
different formal occasions separated in time by many
months.
On the campus the University Land and Building
Development Committee created in 1950 has reviewed,
and in many cases suggested revisions to, all general and
specific land use plans. Its recommendations then go to the
President and to the Board of Trustees.
These processes have been followed to the letter in the
case of the Dillingham development and Coyote Hill. Three
bodies, the Palo Alto Planning Commission, the City
Council and the Stanford Land and Building Development
Committee have specifically approved these projects, and
as recently as the last four months of 1969. The Livingston
and Blayney Foothills Knvironmental Study, undertaken
for the City, in December specifically endorsed the
University's plans for development and open areas around
Coyote Mill.
We are being told that the people of the area do not
have a chance to participate in the determination of
Stanford land use plans. A much more accurate evaluation
of the charge is that a minority of Stanford students is
trying to dictate to the University, the City and the
permanent local residents how Stanford lands should be
used.
Theme no. 2—Stanford is eating lip all its lands through
commercial development.
This is also untrue. The largest and fastest growing
segment of Stanford land is the academic reserve, the bulk
of which lies in the foothills. Since 1953 the University has
increased the size of the reserve from 2,250 acres to 5,200
acres. At the same time, the lands designated for
development have been decreased from 6000 acres to
2,900 acres. In all, only 940 acres, or 1 1% of Stanford's
total of 8,800 acres, actually have been developed. These
facts are conveniently ignored by those who prefer to paint
a picture of a ruthless, land-devouring institution.
Theme no. 3 —The Land and Building Development
Committee has been ineffective in the past and the new
one is the only one to look out for campus interests.
Recently a Daily story noted that the new Committee
set a "precedent" by delaying approval of a School of
Education research and development structure. Such a
precedent was set many, many years ago, for the
Committee has returned projects for revision on numerous
occasions. Earlier committees also played an important
part in advising the President on Stanford's Land Use Plan.

Theme no. 4—Stanford land development is basic-all) an
evil force that is responsible for the worsening problems of
overcrowding, pollution and housing on the Peninsula.
This argument does two things: it ignores the many,
substantial benefits that Stanford's land development
program has brought to the area, and it heaps the blame
for regional social problems on the University.
The Stanford land program has created what has been
heralded by planners and architects throughout the world
as an outstanding working environment. It has been a
model to be emulated and copied. Indeed, the strict
architectural site controls imposed by the University have
been basically responsible for its popularity and success.
The land program has provided superior public schools,
city parks and better government services through local
taxes. It has also provided funds for the educational work
of a major private university. Stanford receives about $2
million annually, while area communities receive about
$10 million in taxes and other charges, not to mention the
take-home pay of employees representing all social,
economic and racial groups.
To be sure, development has been accompanied by
increased traffic, a phenomenon which is not unique to
Stanford or any other area of concentrated population in
this country or abroad. It is unfortunate that all of us are
so closely tied to the automobile.
Independent of the actions of self-named revolutionists,
millions are being spent to overcome air pollutants and
replace the automobile with rapid transit. Unfortunately
the people of Santa Clara County, those who must
shoulder the cost of rapid transit, have twice rejected it at
the polls. We face many problems, the solutions of which
are sometimes opposing, but today's problems would be
far worse and we would have far less ability to tackle them
if our economy were not sound. One need only look at the
developing countries of the world for evidence of this.
Theme no. s—Stanford5 —Stanford has ignored the area need lor
low-income housing.
Hindsight is a wonderful asset in these matters. The
need for such housing was by no means as clear or as
pressing a few years ago as it appears to be today. The
University considered low- and moderate-cost housing in
1954, but it was found that the demand was being
adequately met off the campus, that more campus land
should be set aside for future academic needs and that a
smaller portion of land should be used for income
producing activities. In the mid-sixties, an abundance of all
housing types was readily available. Apartment
construction in Menlo Park, Mountain View and Palo Alto
soared to all-time heights. Later, as a result of area-wide
layoffs and an over-supply of housing, vacancy rates
soared, foreclosures became abundant and construction
ceased.
Today, of course, the situation is far different. Local
demand exceeds supply and, although this may not always
be the case, a University committee appointed by the
President is vigorously studying a low-income housing
project. Acting-President Glaser and President Pitzer both
encouraged the City of Palo Alto to study the use of the
old corporation yard property across El Camino Real for
such purposes. Four years ago before the housing problem
became an issue of campus concern, the University
commenced negotiations for the construction of 700
apartment units on Willow Road. A superficial analysis of
rent structures at Oak Creek Apartments has caused some
to accuse the University of building for the rich.
When the hard economic facts of apartment
construction in 1970 are evaluated, however, it is clear that
the rents reflect moderate-cost housing without subsidy at
today's prices. An 800 square foot apartment at Escondido
Village rents for $125 per month, but there are some very
basic differences in the cost of Escondido Village and Oak
Creek Apartments. The University borrowed money from
the federal government at 3 percent to build student

housing while the developers of Oak Creek Apartments
must pay today's going interest rate of 9 percent. This
factor alone causes a monthly rent increase of $50 in an
apartment unit which costs $10,000 (800 square feet at
$12 per square foot) to build. Escondido Village pays no
property taxes ($2O per month), and the land was
contributed ($l5 per month) plus. Escondido Village was
built five years ago. Since then construction costs have
risen on the average of 6% ($2O per month) per year. No
developer's return or vacancy factor has been considered.
Small wonder that similar size units at Oak Creek
Apartments start at $210 per month. This rent reflects
today's world. Only substantial subsidies will bring rent
lower.
The Dillingham site on Page Mill Road, incidentally, has
never been considered for low-income housing. Sensitive
planning would never seek to justify housing in that
location. Eleven other sites on the campus were suggested
by the Moulton committee last spring.
There have been other themes and many other points in
Daily columns and in the emotional appeals by "Grass
Roots" which deserve to be carefully scrutinized in the
light of fact and truthfulness, but space does not permit a
response to all of them. Let me summarize several with
these observations: the Dillingham project is not causing
the city or county to build an overpass at El Camino and
Page Mill Road as the overpass was first discussed in 1960
and approved by Palo Alto and the County before the
Dillingham project was announced; the City Council of
Palo Alto thoroughly examined traffic surveys and
projections for the Dillingham and Coyote Hill projects;
the unrestricted income to the University from these
projects has been grossly understated; a recent Stanford
Industrial Park survey showed that 70% of those earning
less than $5,000 a year live within five miles of their work
and 50% of those earning from $5,000 to $15,000 live
within five miles of their work; and the University is
exploring every possible plan, including bills passed in the
most recent legislative session, for holding space open
while paying minimal taxes.
Ironically, at the same time the University is being
urged and threatened with coercion to not develop its
lands for income, it is being urged by the very same people
to solve other vital social problems at considerable
expense.
What about the future? Why not halt all projects
immediately? The answer is that the basic needs remain.
Sixty-three percent of a student's educational costs is not
covered by tuition. New and desirable programs require
funding. And the basic benefits to all society continue
through the education of youth. Secondly, commitments
have been made in good faith after obtaining complete
approval by the elected representatives of the people in
Palo Alto and by the designated University committees. To
stop planned developments because of the superficial and
often unsubstantiated objections of a small minority would
be impossible in view of the long chain of irrevocable
commitments already in effect.
There is, however, continuing awareness on the part of
the University that any major new undertakings must be
carefully reviewed. The Board of Trustees has authorized,
in principle, President Pitzer to hire an outside consultant
to review the Land Use Plan, and the President had earlier
asked the Land and Building Committee to take a fresh
look at long-range plans and proposals for the use of lands
outside the academic reserve. He has asked the committee
"to bear in mind the needs of the total community,
including ecological and environmental matters, as well as
the critical need for additional financial support."
I would like to take up this question and other positive
matters in another column. I am most grateful for the
opportunities already given me by the Daily to express the
University's views.

"to bear in mind the needs of the total community,
including ecological and environmental matters, as well as
the critical need for additional financial support."
I would like to take up this question and other positive
matters in another column. I am most grateful for the
opportunities already given me by the Daily to express the
University's views.

So many inaccurate and misleading statements about
Stanford land development have appeared in l)ail>
columns in recent weeks and in the literature of "Grass
Roots" that it is impossible to respond to all of them.
Some of the points raised have been substantive ones, but
many others have been so absurd that it is difficult to take
them seriously. Let me deal first with some of the general
themes that run through most of the arguments.
Theme no. I—"The people have absolutely no say in
how Stanford lands shall be used."
This is a ridiculous, and actually dishonest, statement.
The voters of the area have always decided, and are still
deciding, how Stanford lands can be developed. Before any
development steps are taken, the University requests
annexation and prezoning to a neighboring community.
The community has complete power to establish land use
and to accept or reject annexation. Community members
are given the opportunity to express their opinions through
public hearings which are held before planning
commissions and city councils. In the end, land use policy
is set by elected representatives of the people.
The actions of these representatives are open to direct
challenge by public referendum. After land use is
established, but before any development can take place,
public hearings are held again before planning commissions
and city councils to comply with state subdivision law.
Before a parcel of land can be developed, the public is
given the opportunity to voice its opinion on at least six
different formal occasions separated in time by many
months.
On the campus the University Land and Building
Development Committee created in 1950 has reviewed,
and in many cases suggested revisions to, all general and
specific land use plans. Its recommendations then go to the
President and to the Board of Trustees.
These processes have been followed to the letter in the
case of the Dillingham development and Coyote Hill. Three
bodies, the Palo Alto Planning Commission, the City
Council and the Stanford Land and Building Development
Committee have specifically approved these projects, and
as recently as the last four months of 1969. The Livingston
and Blayney Foothills Knvironmental Study, undertaken
for the City, in December specifically endorsed the
University's plans for development and open areas around
Coyote Mill.
We are being told that the people of the area do not
have a chance to participate in the determination of
Stanford land use plans. A much more accurate evaluation
of the charge is that a minority of Stanford students is
trying to dictate to the University, the City and the
permanent local residents how Stanford lands should be
used.
Theme no. 2—Stanford is eating lip all its lands through
commercial development.
This is also untrue. The largest and fastest growing
segment of Stanford land is the academic reserve, the bulk
of which lies in the foothills. Since 1953 the University has
increased the size of the reserve from 2,250 acres to 5,200
acres. At the same time, the lands designated for
development have been decreased from 6000 acres to
2,900 acres. In all, only 940 acres, or 1 1% of Stanford's
total of 8,800 acres, actually have been developed. These
facts are conveniently ignored by those who prefer to paint
a picture of a ruthless, land-devouring institution.
Theme no. 3 —The Land and Building Development
Committee has been ineffective in the past and the new
one is the only one to look out for campus interests.
Recently a Daily story noted that the new Committee
set a "precedent" by delaying approval of a School of
Education research and development structure. Such a
precedent was set many, many years ago, for the
Committee has returned projects for revision on numerous
occasions. Earlier committees also played an important
part in advising the President on Stanford's Land Use Plan.

Theme no. 4—Stanford land development is basic-all) an
evil force that is responsible for the worsening problems of
overcrowding, pollution and housing on the Peninsula.
This argument does two things: it ignores the many,
substantial benefits that Stanford's land development
program has brought to the area, and it heaps the blame
for regional social problems on the University.
The Stanford land program has created what has been
heralded by planners and architects throughout the world
as an outstanding working environment. It has been a
model to be emulated and copied. Indeed, the strict
architectural site controls imposed by the University have
been basically responsible for its popularity and success.
The land program has provided superior public schools,
city parks and better government services through local
taxes. It has also provided funds for the educational work
of a major private university. Stanford receives about $2
million annually, while area communities receive about
$10 million in taxes and other charges, not to mention the
take-home pay of employees representing all social,
economic and racial groups.
To be sure, development has been accompanied by
increased traffic, a phenomenon which is not unique to
Stanford or any other area of concentrated population in
this country or abroad. It is unfortunate that all of us are
so closely tied to the automobile.
Independent of the actions of self-named revolutionists,
millions are being spent to overcome air pollutants and
replace the automobile with rapid transit. Unfortunately
the people of Santa Clara County, those who must
shoulder the cost of rapid transit, have twice rejected it at
the polls. We face many problems, the solutions of which
are sometimes opposing, but today's problems would be
far worse and we would have far less ability to tackle them
if our economy were not sound. One need only look at the
developing countries of the world for evidence of this.
Theme no. s—Stanford5 —Stanford has ignored the area need lor
low-income housing.
Hindsight is a wonderful asset in these matters. The
need for such housing was by no means as clear or as
pressing a few years ago as it appears to be today. The
University considered low- and moderate-cost housing in
1954, but it was found that the demand was being
adequately met off the campus, that more campus land
should be set aside for future academic needs and that a
smaller portion of land should be used for income
producing activities. In the mid-sixties, an abundance of all
housing types was readily available. Apartment
construction in Menlo Park, Mountain View and Palo Alto
soared to all-time heights. Later, as a result of area-wide
layoffs and an over-supply of housing, vacancy rates
soared, foreclosures became abundant and construction
ceased.
Today, of course, the situation is far different. Local
demand exceeds supply and, although this may not always
be the case, a University committee appointed by the
President is vigorously studying a low-income housing
project. Acting-President Glaser and President Pitzer both
encouraged the City of Palo Alto to study the use of the
old corporation yard property across El Camino Real for
such purposes. Four years ago before the housing problem
became an issue of campus concern, the University
commenced negotiations for the construction of 700
apartment units on Willow Road. A superficial analysis of
rent structures at Oak Creek Apartments has caused some
to accuse the University of building for the rich.
When the hard economic facts of apartment
construction in 1970 are evaluated, however, it is clear that
the rents reflect moderate-cost housing without subsidy at
today's prices. An 800 square foot apartment at Escondido
Village rents for $125 per month, but there are some very
basic differences in the cost of Escondido Village and Oak
Creek Apartments. The University borrowed money from
the federal government at 3 percent to build student

housing while the developers of Oak Creek Apartments
must pay today's going interest rate of 9 percent. This
factor alone causes a monthly rent increase of $50 in an
apartment unit which costs $10,000 (800 square feet at
$12 per square foot) to build. Escondido Village pays no
property taxes ($2O per month), and the land was
contributed ($l5 per month) plus. Escondido Village was
built five years ago. Since then construction costs have
risen on the average of 6% ($2O per month) per year. No
developer's return or vacancy factor has been considered.
Small wonder that similar size units at Oak Creek
Apartments start at $210 per month. This rent reflects
today's world. Only substantial subsidies will bring rent
lower.
The Dillingham site on Page Mill Road, incidentally, has
never been considered for low-income housing. Sensitive
planning would never seek to justify housing in that
location. Eleven other sites on the campus were suggested
by the Moulton committee last spring.
There have been other themes and many other points in
Daily columns and in the emotional appeals by "Grass
Roots" which deserve to be carefully scrutinized in the
light of fact and truthfulness, but space does not permit a
response to all of them. Let me summarize several with
these observations: the Dillingham project is not causing
the city or county to build an overpass at El Camino and
Page Mill Road as the overpass was first discussed in 1960
and approved by Palo Alto and the County before the
Dillingham project was announced; the City Council of
Palo Alto thoroughly examined traffic surveys and
projections for the Dillingham and Coyote Hill projects;
the unrestricted income to the University from these
projects has been grossly understated; a recent Stanford
Industrial Park survey showed that 70% of those earning
less than $5,000 a year live within five miles of their work
and 50% of those earning from $5,000 to $15,000 live
within five miles of their work; and the University is
exploring every possible plan, including bills passed in the
most recent legislative session, for holding space open
while paying minimal taxes.
Ironically, at the same time the University is being
urged and threatened with coercion to not develop its
lands for income, it is being urged by the very same people
to solve other vital social problems at considerable
expense.
What about the future? Why not halt all projects
immediately? The answer is that the basic needs remain.
Sixty-three percent of a student's educational costs is not
covered by tuition. New and desirable programs require
funding. And the basic benefits to all society continue
through the education of youth. Secondly, commitments
have been made in good faith after obtaining complete
approval by the elected representatives of the people in
Palo Alto and by the designated University committees. To
stop planned developments because of the superficial and
often unsubstantiated objections of a small minority would
be impossible in view of the long chain of irrevocable
commitments already in effect.
There is, however, continuing awareness on the part of
the University that any major new undertakings must be
carefully reviewed. The Board of Trustees has authorized,
in principle, President Pitzer to hire an outside consultant
to review the Land Use Plan, and the President had earlier
asked the Land and Building Committee to take a fresh
look at long-range plans and proposals for the use of lands
outside the academic reserve. He has asked the committee
"to bear in mind the needs of the total community,
including ecological and environmental matters, as well as
the critical need for additional financial support."

There is, however, continuing awareness on the part of
the University that any major new undertakings must be
carefully reviewed. The Board of Trustees has authorized,
in principle, President Pitzer to hire an outside consultant
to review the Land Use Plan, and the President had earlier
asked the Land and Building Committee to take a fresh
look at long-range plans and proposals for the use of lands
outside the academic reserve. He has asked the committee
"to bear in mind the needs of the total community,
including ecological and environmental matters, as well as
the critical need for additional financial support."
I would like to take up this question and other positive
matters in another column. I am most grateful for the
opportunities already given me by the Daily to express the
University's views.

So many inaccurate and misleading statements about
Stanford land development have appeared in l)ail>
columns in recent weeks and in the literature of "Grass
Roots" that it is impossible to respond to all of them.
Some of the points raised have been substantive ones, but
many others have been so absurd that it is difficult to take
them seriously. Let me deal first with some of the general
themes that run through most of the arguments.
Theme no. I—"The people have absolutely no say in
how Stanford lands shall be used."
This is a ridiculous, and actually dishonest, statement.
The voters of the area have always decided, and are still
deciding, how Stanford lands can be developed. Before any
development steps are taken, the University requests
annexation and prezoning to a neighboring community.
The community has complete power to establish land use
and to accept or reject annexation. Community members
are given the opportunity to express their opinions through
public hearings which are held before planning
commissions and city councils. In the end, land use policy
is set by elected representatives of the people.
The actions of these representatives are open to direct
challenge by public referendum. After land use is
established, but before any development can take place,
public hearings are held again before planning commissions
and city councils to comply with state subdivision law.
Before a parcel of land can be developed, the public is
given the opportunity to voice its opinion on at least six
different formal occasions separated in time by many
months.
On the campus the University Land and Building
Development Committee created in 1950 has reviewed,
and in many cases suggested revisions to, all general and
specific land use plans. Its recommendations then go to the
President and to the Board of Trustees.
These processes have been followed to the letter in the
case of the Dillingham development and Coyote Hill. Three
bodies, the Palo Alto Planning Commission, the City
Council and the Stanford Land and Building Development
Committee have specifically approved these projects, and
as recently as the last four months of 1969. The Livingston
and Blayney Foothills Knvironmental Study, undertaken
for the City, in December specifically endorsed the
University's plans for development and open areas around
Coyote Mill.
We are being told that the people of the area do not
have a chance to participate in the determination of
Stanford land use plans. A much more accurate evaluation
of the charge is that a minority of Stanford students is
trying to dictate to the University, the City and the
permanent local residents how Stanford lands should be
used.
Theme no. 2—Stanford is eating lip all its lands through
commercial development.
This is also untrue. The largest and fastest growing
segment of Stanford land is the academic reserve, the bulk
of which lies in the foothills. Since 1953 the University has
increased the size of the reserve from 2,250 acres to 5,200
acres. At the same time, the lands designated for
development have been decreased from 6000 acres to
2,900 acres. In all, only 940 acres, or 1 1% of Stanford's
total of 8,800 acres, actually have been developed. These
facts are conveniently ignored by those who prefer to paint
a picture of a ruthless, land-devouring institution.
Theme no. 3 —The Land and Building Development
Committee has been ineffective in the past and the new
one is the only one to look out for campus interests.
Recently a Daily story noted that the new Committee
set a "precedent" by delaying approval of a School of
Education research and development structure. Such a
precedent was set many, many years ago, for the
Committee has returned projects for revision on numerous
occasions. Earlier committees also played an important
part in advising the President on Stanford's Land Use Plan.

Theme no. 4—Stanford land development is basic-all) an
evil force that is responsible for the worsening problems of
overcrowding, pollution and housing on the Peninsula.
This argument does two things: it ignores the many,
substantial benefits that Stanford's land development
program has brought to the area, and it heaps the blame
for regional social problems on the University.
The Stanford land program has created what has been
heralded by planners and architects throughout the world
as an outstanding working environment. It has been a
model to be emulated and copied. Indeed, the strict
architectural site controls imposed by the University have
been basically responsible for its popularity and success.
The land program has provided superior public schools,
city parks and better government services through local
taxes. It has also provided funds for the educational work
of a major private university. Stanford receives about $2
million annually, while area communities receive about
$10 million in taxes and other charges, not to mention the
take-home pay of employees representing all social,
economic and racial groups.
To be sure, development has been accompanied by
increased traffic, a phenomenon which is not unique to
Stanford or any other area of concentrated population in
this country or abroad. It is unfortunate that all of us are
so closely tied to the automobile.
Independent of the actions of self-named revolutionists,
millions are being spent to overcome air pollutants and
replace the automobile with rapid transit. Unfortunately
the people of Santa Clara County, those who must
shoulder the cost of rapid transit, have twice rejected it at
the polls. We face many problems, the solutions of which
are sometimes opposing, but today's problems would be
far worse and we would have far less ability to tackle them
if our economy were not sound. One need only look at the
developing countries of the world for evidence of this.
Theme no. s—Stanford5 —Stanford has ignored the area need lor
low-income housing.
Hindsight is a wonderful asset in these matters. The
need for such housing was by no means as clear or as
pressing a few years ago as it appears to be today. The
University considered low- and moderate-cost housing in
1954, but it was found that the demand was being
adequately met off the campus, that more campus land
should be set aside for future academic needs and that a
smaller portion of land should be used for income
producing activities. In the mid-sixties, an abundance of all
housing types was readily available. Apartment
construction in Menlo Park, Mountain View and Palo Alto
soared to all-time heights. Later, as a result of area-wide
layoffs and an over-supply of housing, vacancy rates
soared, foreclosures became abundant and construction
ceased.
Today, of course, the situation is far different. Local
demand exceeds supply and, although this may not always
be the case, a University committee appointed by the
President is vigorously studying a low-income housing
project. Acting-President Glaser and President Pitzer both
encouraged the City of Palo Alto to study the use of the
old corporation yard property across El Camino Real for
such purposes. Four years ago before the housing problem
became an issue of campus concern, the University
commenced negotiations for the construction of 700
apartment units on Willow Road. A superficial analysis of
rent structures at Oak Creek Apartments has caused some
to accuse the University of building for the rich.
When the hard economic facts of apartment
construction in 1970 are evaluated, however, it is clear that
the rents reflect moderate-cost housing without subsidy at
today's prices. An 800 square foot apartment at Escondido
Village rents for $125 per month, but there are some very
basic differences in the cost of Escondido Village and Oak
Creek Apartments. The University borrowed money from
the federal government at 3 percent to build student

housing while the developers of Oak Creek Apartments
must pay today's going interest rate of 9 percent. This
factor alone causes a monthly rent increase of $50 in an
apartment unit which costs $10,000 (800 square feet at
$12 per square foot) to build. Escondido Village pays no
property taxes ($2O per month), and the land was
contributed ($l5 per month) plus. Escondido Village was
built five years ago. Since then construction costs have
risen on the average of 6% ($2O per month) per year. No
developer's return or vacancy factor has been considered.
Small wonder that similar size units at Oak Creek
Apartments start at $210 per month. This rent reflects
today's world. Only substantial subsidies will bring rent
lower.
The Dillingham site on Page Mill Road, incidentally, has
never been considered for low-income housing. Sensitive
planning would never seek to justify housing in that
location. Eleven other sites on the campus were suggested
by the Moulton committee last spring.
There have been other themes and many other points in
Daily columns and in the emotional appeals by "Grass
Roots" which deserve to be carefully scrutinized in the
light of fact and truthfulness, but space does not permit a
response to all of them. Let me summarize several with
these observations: the Dillingham project is not causing
the city or county to build an overpass at El Camino and
Page Mill Road as the overpass was first discussed in 1960
and approved by Palo Alto and the County before the
Dillingham project was announced; the City Council of
Palo Alto thoroughly examined traffic surveys and
projections for the Dillingham and Coyote Hill projects;
the unrestricted income to the University from these
projects has been grossly understated; a recent Stanford
Industrial Park survey showed that 70% of those earning
less than $5,000 a year live within five miles of their work
and 50% of those earning from $5,000 to $15,000 live
within five miles of their work; and the University is
exploring every possible plan, including bills passed in the
most recent legislative session, for holding space open
while paying minimal taxes.
Ironically, at the same time the University is being
urged and threatened with coercion to not develop its
lands for income, it is being urged by the very same people
to solve other vital social problems at considerable
expense.
What about the future? Why not halt all projects
immediately? The answer is that the basic needs remain.
Sixty-three percent of a student's educational costs is not
covered by tuition. New and desirable programs require
funding. And the basic benefits to all society continue
through the education of youth. Secondly, commitments
have been made in good faith after obtaining complete
approval by the elected representatives of the people in
Palo Alto and by the designated University committees. To
stop planned developments because of the superficial and
often unsubstantiated objections of a small minority would
be impossible in view of the long chain of irrevocable
commitments already in effect.
There is, however, continuing awareness on the part of
the University that any major new undertakings must be
carefully reviewed. The Board of Trustees has authorized,
in principle, President Pitzer to hire an outside consultant

funding. And the basic benefits to all society continue
through the education of youth. Secondly, commitments
have been made in good faith after obtaining complete
approval by the elected representatives of the people in
Palo Alto and by the designated University committees. To
stop planned developments because of the superficial and
often unsubstantiated objections of a small minority would
be impossible in view of the long chain of irrevocable
commitments already in effect.
There is, however, continuing awareness on the part of
the University that any major new undertakings must be
carefully reviewed. The Board of Trustees has authorized,
in principle, President Pitzer to hire an outside consultant
to review the Land Use Plan, and the President had earlier
asked the Land and Building Committee to take a fresh
look at long-range plans and proposals for the use of lands
outside the academic reserve. He has asked the committee
"to bear in mind the needs of the total community,
including ecological and environmental matters, as well as
the critical need for additional financial support."
I would like to take up this question and other positive
matters in another column. I am most grateful for the
opportunities already given me by the Daily to express the
University's views.

So many inaccurate and misleading statements about
Stanford land development have appeared in l)ail>
columns in recent weeks and in the literature of "Grass
Roots" that it is impossible to respond to all of them.
Some of the points raised have been substantive ones, but
many others have been so absurd that it is difficult to take
them seriously. Let me deal first with some of the general
themes that run through most of the arguments.
Theme no. I—"The people have absolutely no say in
how Stanford lands shall be used."
This is a ridiculous, and actually dishonest, statement.
The voters of the area have always decided, and are still
deciding, how Stanford lands can be developed. Before any
development steps are taken, the University requests
annexation and prezoning to a neighboring community.
The community has complete power to establish land use
and to accept or reject annexation. Community members
are given the opportunity to express their opinions through
public hearings which are held before planning
commissions and city councils. In the end, land use policy
is set by elected representatives of the people.
The actions of these representatives are open to direct
challenge by public referendum. After land use is
established, but before any development can take place,
public hearings are held again before planning commissions
and city councils to comply with state subdivision law.
Before a parcel of land can be developed, the public is
given the opportunity to voice its opinion on at least six
different formal occasions separated in time by many
months.
On the campus the University Land and Building
Development Committee created in 1950 has reviewed,
and in many cases suggested revisions to, all general and
specific land use plans. Its recommendations then go to the
President and to the Board of Trustees.
These processes have been followed to the letter in the
case of the Dillingham development and Coyote Hill. Three
bodies, the Palo Alto Planning Commission, the City
Council and the Stanford Land and Building Development
Committee have specifically approved these projects, and
as recently as the last four months of 1969. The Livingston
and Blayney Foothills Knvironmental Study, undertaken
for the City, in December specifically endorsed the
University's plans for development and open areas around
Coyote Mill.
We are being told that the people of the area do not
have a chance to participate in the determination of
Stanford land use plans. A much more accurate evaluation
of the charge is that a minority of Stanford students is
trying to dictate to the University, the City and the
permanent local residents how Stanford lands should be
used.
Theme no. 2—Stanford is eating lip all its lands through
commercial development.
This is also untrue. The largest and fastest growing
segment of Stanford land is the academic reserve, the bulk
of which lies in the foothills. Since 1953 the University has
increased the size of the reserve from 2,250 acres to 5,200
acres. At the same time, the lands designated for
development have been decreased from 6000 acres to
2,900 acres. In all, only 940 acres, or 1 1% of Stanford's
total of 8,800 acres, actually have been developed. These
facts are conveniently ignored by those who prefer to paint
a picture of a ruthless, land-devouring institution.
Theme no. 3 —The Land and Building Development
Committee has been ineffective in the past and the new
one is the only one to look out for campus interests.
Recently a Daily story noted that the new Committee
set a "precedent" by delaying approval of a School of
Education research and development structure. Such a
precedent was set many, many years ago, for the
Committee has returned projects for revision on numerous
occasions. Earlier committees also played an important
part in advising the President on Stanford's Land Use Plan.

Theme no. 4—Stanford land development is basic-all) an
evil force that is responsible for the worsening problems of
overcrowding, pollution and housing on the Peninsula.
This argument does two things: it ignores the many,
substantial benefits that Stanford's land development
program has brought to the area, and it heaps the blame
for regional social problems on the University.
The Stanford land program has created what has been
heralded by planners and architects throughout the world
as an outstanding working environment. It has been a
model to be emulated and copied. Indeed, the strict
architectural site controls imposed by the University have
been basically responsible for its popularity and success.
The land program has provided superior public schools,
city parks and better government services through local
taxes. It has also provided funds for the educational work
of a major private university. Stanford receives about $2
million annually, while area communities receive about
$10 million in taxes and other charges, not to mention the
take-home pay of employees representing all social,
economic and racial groups.
To be sure, development has been accompanied by
increased traffic, a phenomenon which is not unique to
Stanford or any other area of concentrated population in
this country or abroad. It is unfortunate that all of us are
so closely tied to the automobile.
Independent of the actions of self-named revolutionists,
millions are being spent to overcome air pollutants and
replace the automobile with rapid transit. Unfortunately
the people of Santa Clara County, those who must
shoulder the cost of rapid transit, have twice rejected it at
the polls. We face many problems, the solutions of which
are sometimes opposing, but today's problems would be
far worse and we would have far less ability to tackle them
if our economy were not sound. One need only look at the
developing countries of the world for evidence of this.
Theme no. s—Stanford5 —Stanford has ignored the area need lor
low-income housing.
Hindsight is a wonderful asset in these matters. The
need for such housing was by no means as clear or as
pressing a few years ago as it appears to be today. The
University considered low- and moderate-cost housing in
1954, but it was found that the demand was being
adequately met off the campus, that more campus land
should be set aside for future academic needs and that a
smaller portion of land should be used for income
producing activities. In the mid-sixties, an abundance of all
housing types was readily available. Apartment
construction in Menlo Park, Mountain View and Palo Alto
soared to all-time heights. Later, as a result of area-wide
layoffs and an over-supply of housing, vacancy rates
soared, foreclosures became abundant and construction
ceased.
Today, of course, the situation is far different. Local
demand exceeds supply and, although this may not always
be the case, a University committee appointed by the
President is vigorously studying a low-income housing
project. Acting-President Glaser and President Pitzer both
encouraged the City of Palo Alto to study the use of the
old corporation yard property across El Camino Real for
such purposes. Four years ago before the housing problem
became an issue of campus concern, the University
commenced negotiations for the construction of 700
apartment units on Willow Road. A superficial analysis of
rent structures at Oak Creek Apartments has caused some
to accuse the University of building for the rich.
When the hard economic facts of apartment
construction in 1970 are evaluated, however, it is clear that
the rents reflect moderate-cost housing without subsidy at
today's prices. An 800 square foot apartment at Escondido
Village rents for $125 per month, but there are some very
basic differences in the cost of Escondido Village and Oak
Creek Apartments. The University borrowed money from
the federal government at 3 percent to build student

housing while the developers of Oak Creek Apartments
must pay today's going interest rate of 9 percent. This
factor alone causes a monthly rent increase of $50 in an
apartment unit which costs $10,000 (800 square feet at
$12 per square foot) to build. Escondido Village pays no
property taxes ($2O per month), and the land was
contributed ($l5 per month) plus. Escondido Village was
built five years ago. Since then construction costs have
risen on the average of 6% ($2O per month) per year. No
developer's return or vacancy factor has been considered.
Small wonder that similar size units at Oak Creek
Apartments start at $210 per month. This rent reflects
today's world. Only substantial subsidies will bring rent
lower.
The Dillingham site on Page Mill Road, incidentally, has
never been considered for low-income housing. Sensitive
planning would never seek to justify housing in that
location. Eleven other sites on the campus were suggested
by the Moulton committee last spring.
There have been other themes and many other points in
Daily columns and in the emotional appeals by "Grass
Roots" which deserve to be carefully scrutinized in the
light of fact and truthfulness, but space does not permit a
response to all of them. Let me summarize several with
these observations: the Dillingham project is not causing
the city or county to build an overpass at El Camino and
Page Mill Road as the overpass was first discussed in 1960
and approved by Palo Alto and the County before the
Dillingham project was announced; the City Council of
Palo Alto thoroughly examined traffic surveys and
projections for the Dillingham and Coyote Hill projects;
the unrestricted income to the University from these
projects has been grossly understated; a recent Stanford
Industrial Park survey showed that 70% of those earning
less than $5,000 a year live within five miles of their work
and 50% of those earning from $5,000 to $15,000 live
within five miles of their work; and the University is
exploring every possible plan, including bills passed in the
most recent legislative session, for holding space open
while paying minimal taxes.
Ironically, at the same time the University is being
urged and threatened with coercion to not develop its
lands for income, it is being urged by the very same people
to solve other vital social problems at considerable
expense.
What about the future? Why not halt all projects
immediately? The answer is that the basic needs remain.
Sixty-three percent of a student's educational costs is not
covered by tuition. New and desirable programs require
funding. And the basic benefits to all society continue
through the education of youth. Secondly, commitments
have been made in good faith after obtaining complete
approval by the elected representatives of the people in
Palo Alto and by the designated University committees. To

Ironically, at the same time the University is being
urged and threatened with coercion to not develop its
lands for income, it is being urged by the very same people
to solve other vital social problems at considerable
expense.
What about the future? Why not halt all projects
immediately? The answer is that the basic needs remain.
Sixty-three percent of a student's educational costs is not
covered by tuition. New and desirable programs require
funding. And the basic benefits to all society continue
through the education of youth. Secondly, commitments
have been made in good faith after obtaining complete
approval by the elected representatives of the people in
Palo Alto and by the designated University committees. To
stop planned developments because of the superficial and
often unsubstantiated objections of a small minority would
be impossible in view of the long chain of irrevocable
commitments already in effect.
There is, however, continuing awareness on the part of
the University that any major new undertakings must be
carefully reviewed. The Board of Trustees has authorized,
in principle, President Pitzer to hire an outside consultant
to review the Land Use Plan, and the President had earlier
asked the Land and Building Committee to take a fresh
look at long-range plans and proposals for the use of lands
outside the academic reserve. He has asked the committee
"to bear in mind the needs of the total community,
including ecological and environmental matters, as well as
the critical need for additional financial support."
I would like to take up this question and other positive
matters in another column. I am most grateful for the
opportunities already given me by the Daily to express the
University's views.

So many inaccurate and misleading statements about
Stanford land development have appeared in l)ail>
columns in recent weeks and in the literature of "Grass
Roots" that it is impossible to respond to all of them.
Some of the points raised have been substantive ones, but
many others have been so absurd that it is difficult to take
them seriously. Let me deal first with some of the general
themes that run through most of the arguments.
Theme no. I—"The people have absolutely no say in
how Stanford lands shall be used."
This is a ridiculous, and actually dishonest, statement.
The voters of the area have always decided, and are still
deciding, how Stanford lands can be developed. Before any
development steps are taken, the University requests
annexation and prezoning to a neighboring community.
The community has complete power to establish land use
and to accept or reject annexation. Community members
are given the opportunity to express their opinions through
public hearings which are held before planning
commissions and city councils. In the end, land use policy
is set by elected representatives of the people.
The actions of these representatives are open to direct
challenge by public referendum. After land use is
established, but before any development can take place,
public hearings are held again before planning commissions
and city councils to comply with state subdivision law.
Before a parcel of land can be developed, the public is
given the opportunity to voice its opinion on at least six
different formal occasions separated in time by many
months.
On the campus the University Land and Building
Development Committee created in 1950 has reviewed,
and in many cases suggested revisions to, all general and
specific land use plans. Its recommendations then go to the
President and to the Board of Trustees.
These processes have been followed to the letter in the
case of the Dillingham development and Coyote Hill. Three
bodies, the Palo Alto Planning Commission, the City
Council and the Stanford Land and Building Development
Committee have specifically approved these projects, and
as recently as the last four months of 1969. The Livingston
and Blayney Foothills Knvironmental Study, undertaken
for the City, in December specifically endorsed the
University's plans for development and open areas around
Coyote Mill.
We are being told that the people of the area do not
have a chance to participate in the determination of
Stanford land use plans. A much more accurate evaluation
of the charge is that a minority of Stanford students is
trying to dictate to the University, the City and the
permanent local residents how Stanford lands should be
used.
Theme no. 2—Stanford is eating lip all its lands through
commercial development.
This is also untrue. The largest and fastest growing
segment of Stanford land is the academic reserve, the bulk
of which lies in the foothills. Since 1953 the University has
increased the size of the reserve from 2,250 acres to 5,200
acres. At the same time, the lands designated for
development have been decreased from 6000 acres to
2,900 acres. In all, only 940 acres, or 1 1% of Stanford's
total of 8,800 acres, actually have been developed. These
facts are conveniently ignored by those who prefer to paint
a picture of a ruthless, land-devouring institution.
Theme no. 3 —The Land and Building Development
Committee has been ineffective in the past and the new
one is the only one to look out for campus interests.
Recently a Daily story noted that the new Committee
set a "precedent" by delaying approval of a School of
Education research and development structure. Such a
precedent was set many, many years ago, for the
Committee has returned projects for revision on numerous
occasions. Earlier committees also played an important
part in advising the President on Stanford's Land Use Plan.

Theme no. 4—Stanford land development is basic-all) an
evil force that is responsible for the worsening problems of
overcrowding, pollution and housing on the Peninsula.
This argument does two things: it ignores the many,
substantial benefits that Stanford's land development
program has brought to the area, and it heaps the blame
for regional social problems on the University.
The Stanford land program has created what has been
heralded by planners and architects throughout the world
as an outstanding working environment. It has been a
model to be emulated and copied. Indeed, the strict
architectural site controls imposed by the University have
been basically responsible for its popularity and success.
The land program has provided superior public schools,
city parks and better government services through local
taxes. It has also provided funds for the educational work
of a major private university. Stanford receives about $2
million annually, while area communities receive about
$10 million in taxes and other charges, not to mention the
take-home pay of employees representing all social,
economic and racial groups.
To be sure, development has been accompanied by
increased traffic, a phenomenon which is not unique to
Stanford or any other area of concentrated population in
this country or abroad. It is unfortunate that all of us are
so closely tied to the automobile.
Independent of the actions of self-named revolutionists,
millions are being spent to overcome air pollutants and
replace the automobile with rapid transit. Unfortunately
the people of Santa Clara County, those who must
shoulder the cost of rapid transit, have twice rejected it at
the polls. We face many problems, the solutions of which
are sometimes opposing, but today's problems would be
far worse and we would have far less ability to tackle them
if our economy were not sound. One need only look at the
developing countries of the world for evidence of this.
Theme no. s—Stanford5 —Stanford has ignored the area need lor
low-income housing.
Hindsight is a wonderful asset in these matters. The
need for such housing was by no means as clear or as
pressing a few years ago as it appears to be today. The
University considered low- and moderate-cost housing in
1954, but it was found that the demand was being
adequately met off the campus, that more campus land
should be set aside for future academic needs and that a
smaller portion of land should be used for income
producing activities. In the mid-sixties, an abundance of all
housing types was readily available. Apartment
construction in Menlo Park, Mountain View and Palo Alto
soared to all-time heights. Later, as a result of area-wide
layoffs and an over-supply of housing, vacancy rates
soared, foreclosures became abundant and construction
ceased.
Today, of course, the situation is far different. Local
demand exceeds supply and, although this may not always
be the case, a University committee appointed by the
President is vigorously studying a low-income housing
project. Acting-President Glaser and President Pitzer both
encouraged the City of Palo Alto to study the use of the
old corporation yard property across El Camino Real for
such purposes. Four years ago before the housing problem
became an issue of campus concern, the University
commenced negotiations for the construction of 700
apartment units on Willow Road. A superficial analysis of
rent structures at Oak Creek Apartments has caused some
to accuse the University of building for the rich.
When the hard economic facts of apartment
construction in 1970 are evaluated, however, it is clear that
the rents reflect moderate-cost housing without subsidy at
today's prices. An 800 square foot apartment at Escondido
Village rents for $125 per month, but there are some very
basic differences in the cost of Escondido Village and Oak
Creek Apartments. The University borrowed money from
the federal government at 3 percent to build student

housing while the developers of Oak Creek Apartments
must pay today's going interest rate of 9 percent. This
factor alone causes a monthly rent increase of $50 in an
apartment unit which costs $10,000 (800 square feet at
$12 per square foot) to build. Escondido Village pays no
property taxes ($2O per month), and the land was
contributed ($l5 per month) plus. Escondido Village was
built five years ago. Since then construction costs have
risen on the average of 6% ($2O per month) per year. No
developer's return or vacancy factor has been considered.
Small wonder that similar size units at Oak Creek
Apartments start at $210 per month. This rent reflects
today's world. Only substantial subsidies will bring rent
lower.
The Dillingham site on Page Mill Road, incidentally, has
never been considered for low-income housing. Sensitive
planning would never seek to justify housing in that
location. Eleven other sites on the campus were suggested
by the Moulton committee last spring.
There have been other themes and many other points in
Daily columns and in the emotional appeals by "Grass
Roots" which deserve to be carefully scrutinized in the
light of fact and truthfulness, but space does not permit a
response to all of them. Let me summarize several with
these observations: the Dillingham project is not causing
the city or county to build an overpass at El Camino and
Page Mill Road as the overpass was first discussed in 1960
and approved by Palo Alto and the County before the
Dillingham project was announced; the City Council of
Palo Alto thoroughly examined traffic surveys and
projections for the Dillingham and Coyote Hill projects;
the unrestricted income to the University from these
projects has been grossly understated; a recent Stanford
Industrial Park survey showed that 70% of those earning
less than $5,000 a year live within five miles of their work
and 50% of those earning from $5,000 to $15,000 live
within five miles of their work; and the University is
exploring every possible plan, including bills passed in the
most recent legislative session, for holding space open
while paying minimal taxes.
Ironically, at the same time the University is being
urged and threatened with coercion to not develop its
lands for income, it is being urged by the very same people
to solve other vital social problems at considerable
expense.
