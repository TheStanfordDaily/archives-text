# The 						Weeks' Films
## Truffaut, Antonioni, Penn On Tap 
### Todd McCarthy 
There are more films showing
on campus this week than in any
week since I started writing this
column just a year ago. One could
say that we have a severe case of
filmic over-population but that
can only be for the good.
On Tuesday in Geology 320 at
8 and 10:30, Clive Miller will
show the original, 1934 Cleopatra.
Cecil B. DeMille's direction is
predictably broad and outlandish
but all in all, this version starring
Claudette Colbert is more
satisfactory than the huge 1963
production. Showing at 10 are
two Busby Berkeley musical
numbers from In Caliente.
Two Before Zero is a film
record of the growth of
Communism from Marx to Castro.
According to program notes,
"segments on the Russian
Revolution and Stalinist takeover
are particularly good." This
documentary will be shown in
Bishop Auditorium on Thursday
at 7 and 9.
Shakespeare Wallah, an
off-beat entry from India, is this
week's International Association
film. The picture depicts an
itinerant Shakespearean company
travelling about India and offers
an interesting contrast in cultures.
In Cubberley on Thursday at
7:45.
If I had to recommend one
film this week above all others, it
would be Francois Truffaut's The
Soft Skin, showing at Tresidder
on Friday at 7, 8 and 9. While
many people have seen Truffaut's
first three pictures, few have seen
and not many more have even
heard of this 1964 production,
which I feel is the director's
second best film. It is here that
Truffaut's Hitchcockian
tendancies and his innate Gallic
humanism are most effectively
combined, even if the shocking
ending does seem somewhat out
of place. However, I still can't
determine whether my enthusiasm
for The Soft Skin stems more
from Francois or Francoise
Dorleac, for it is here that the late
French actress is immortalized for
all-time at her radiant, seductive
best. If you don't care for
Francoise, you may not like the
film but on this, it's impossible
for me to comment objectively.
L'Avven Wira is widely thought
of as one of the most important

films of the sixties and I suppose
it is a classic of sorts on the
subjects of alienation and
non-communication. Nonetheless,
everything I dislike in Antonioni
is brought to a point in this
picture—slowness, aridness and an
uncomfortable feeling that you're
supposed to be finding something
''significant'' in the
mean inglessness of the dull
characters' actions. To each his
own. In Cubberley on Friday at 7
and 9:30.
Harper doesn't quite live up to
expectations as a successful return
to Hollywood's halycon days of
the private eye thriller but it's a
lot of fun anyway. Especially
ingratiating is the cast, from Paul
Newman to Julie Harris, Robert
Wagner, Shelley Winters, Janet
Leigh, Arthur Hill and, in a camp
appearance, Lauren Bacall. In the
Rinconada dining hall at 11 on
Friday.
Being shown at the

underground film series this
Friday are Stan Brakhage's
"Prelude to Dog Star Man,'' Hans
Richter's "Ghosts Before
Breakfast," Chaplin's "The
Bond," Disney's "The Skeleton
Dance," Willard Maas' "Image in
the Snow,'' Broughton's
"Adventures of Jimmy" and"The
Loves of Franistan."
Hiroshima Moil Amour seemed
more important when it was
released in 1960 than it does
today. Indeed, the calculated use
of a jumbled time structure has
been used to better effect in such
"glossy" pictures as Two for the
Roa<l than it is here. For the most
part the film is engrossing, though
the heroine's seemingly endless
reminiscences tend to wear on the
nerves. In Cubberley on Saturday
at 7:30 and 1 0.
John Schlesinger's Far From
the Maddening Crowd eventually
collapses under its own weight but
not before the director has served

up an often stunning and sensual
picture of "Hardy country." Alan
Bates, Terence Stamp and Peter
Finch are excellent and Julie
Christie is gorgeous if somewhat
less strong as the heroine. The
contributions of photographer
Nick Roeg and composer Richard
Rodney Bennett are particularly
noteworthy in this evocative,
leisurely romance. At Tresidder
on Saturday.
Judging from the publicity
handouts, The End of August at
the Hotel Ozone sounds very

promising. This is the first of four
films which ASSU will be showing
in association with New Line
Cinema, an organization designed
to present notable feature films as
yet unreleased in the United
States. Hotel Ozone, made in
Czechoslovakia in 1966, is a
dramatic futuristic fantasy dealing
with eight women searching for a
man to propagate the species in a
post-World War 111 situation. It
will be shown, along with the
shorts "Summer War" and
"Dodge City," in Dinkelspiel on
Saturday night.
After all the recent films in
which everyone has died in slow
motion, it will be interesting to
see if Bonnie and Clyde comes
across as strongly as it did two
years ago. Warren, Faye, Gene,
Estelle and Michael -J. will all be at
Mom Aud Sunday night.

DAILY's resident film person.)


FRANCOIS FT I*RANCOISE—the ureal Francoise Dorleac stars in Francois
