Technology is as old as
mankind, perhaps older.
Technology developed primarily
through the slow process of trial
and error. Although through the
evolutionary process technology
registered improvements - some of
them of remarkable significance -
on the whole it remained a
"craft" technology until
eighteenth century. It was based
on craft skills, much labour and
an out-standing ingenuity. Not
until the middle of eighteenth
century, when industrial
revolution began in western
Europe, did a radical change in
technology take place. The new
technology or the industrial
technology infused within itself
the principles of applied sciences,
from which it had kept a decent
distance before.
Technologists were seldom
popular among the academicians.
Until the middle of the eighteenth
century, the natural and physical
scientists had looked upon
technologists with contempt.
They were thought unworthy of
being admitted to the academic
world. The universities had no
place for technologists, their way
of thinking, being practical, was
deemed intellectually rugged.
Even their inventiveness was
considered of low calibre. As
industrial revolution advanced,
the industrial technology gained
maturity and respectability. The
social importance that industrial
revolution gave to the role of
technologists was good enough to
humble the natural and physical
scientists into accepting the
machine scientists as equals. These
new technologists who held
respectable positions in the
academic world were called
"Engineers". In fact they were a
cross breed between the old
technologists and applied
scientists.
The engineers who served the
civilians instead of the army were
called civil engineers. They did all
kinds of engineering jobs. Later
on the hybridizing of technology
to various physical sciences
produced mechanical, electrical,
chemical, electronic, aeronautic
etc. engineers.
Hum animation
A process which might be
called humanization of
technology started during the
early part of this century. Human
conscience could not bear any
longer the ruthless and brutal
atrocities committed by machine
culture on the industrial worker.
There was also great pressure
exerted by the newly organized
workers unions. This new
challenge was met by a new breed
of engineers, the industrial
engineers. His job was to establish
time and performance standards
and to simplify the methods and
processes. His role was to create
fair and comfortable working
conditions for the worker, and to
increase efficience and
productivity which was to the
employer's advantage. From these
humble beginnings the industrial
engineering has come a long way.
Today it has among its folds
specialists in industrial economics,
psychology, organizational
behavior, human factors in
technology, biomechanics,
environment etc., besides
sophisticated mathematical tools
of operations research and
statistics.
The human development
process follows four distinct
stages - the development of new
techniques, their introduction,
adoption (elimination of side
effects) and a steady state. The
state of political, social, and
economic institutions and
organization of a culture influence
the kind of problems and goals

that are set before the engineers.
Until recently, the industrial
revolution being in the
''development'' and
"introduction" stage, the role of
engineers was limited to design,
layout and operation of machines.
Increasing production or services
was what made an engineer
successful. Whether the new
machines and processes caused
harmful effects on human beings
was almost ignored. It is being
increasingly felt now that some
one has to look into the problems
of adoption and side effects of the
industrial technology. Not only is
it important for a present but
more so for the future
development of society. A
technology is well adopted only
after its side effects harmless or
insignificant. How well a society
solves the problems of adoption
and side effects determines its
future growth.
Challenges Ahead
The two great challenges of the
next century are the exploding
population and the leisure time.
These problems in essence are not
new. Once (or perhaps more than
once) before the mankind faced
similiar problems, although the
degree and magnitude were
different. The early agricultural
society grew out of the hunting
and gathering culture. The
agricultural society by comparison
had superior technology, more
material goods, more leisure time
and rather comfortable living

conditions. Since the life in an
agricultural society faced less
natural hazards and was more
stable as compared to the hunting
culture, there also was a mini
population explosion. It was some
time after the introduction of
agricultural techniques that a
steady state was reached which
continued until the industrial
revolution. In a similar fashion,
the introduction of industrial
technology which began about
two hundred years ago in the
West, and is being rapidly injected
in the East, must find a steady
state. The talent and skill required
to approach this steady state will
be provided by a new race of
engineers, the Social Engineers.
Social engineering would most
probably be an off shoot of
industrial engineering. It would
emerge as a result of cross
breeding between social sciences
and engineering disciplines. The
chief task of social engineers
would be to plan and create a new
social set up compatible to the
modern electronic technology.
Besides learning science and
technology, city and town
planning, family structure and
planning, leisure designing etc.,
would be an important part of a
social engineer's curiculum.
In the next century there
would be a great need of social
engineers in the developing
countries with large populations,
such as India, China, Pakistan, and
Indonesia. Because of a rapid

introduction of industrial
technology and a very high
population density, their
problems of adoption and side
effects would reach unpleasant
proportions in the coming
century.
Engineering as it is today is
primarily a male profession. It is
rarely fancied by women. This
would not be true of social
engineering. In fact most
successful social engineers would
be women. To be good social
engineer would not only require a
good knowledge of applied and
social sciences, but also a deep
understanding of human nature.
Women because of their
tenderness and highly developed
intuition are perhaps more
suitable.
Some educational institutes
have already felt the need to move
in the right direction.
Loughborough University of
Technology in United Kingdom
offers a masters degree in
'Leisure'. Imperial College of
Science, London has a masters
degree program in 'History of
Technology', offered to
engineering graduates. Stanford is
planning an inter-departmental
engineering curriculum in ecology
and conservation.

rarely fancied by women. This
would not be true of social
engineering. In fact most
successful social engineers would
be women. To be good social
engineer would not only require a
good knowledge of applied and
social sciences, but also a deep
understanding of human nature.
Women because of their
tenderness and highly developed
intuition are perhaps more
suitable.
Some educational institutes
have already felt the need to move
in the right direction.
Loughborough University of
Technology in United Kingdom
offers a masters degree in
'Leisure'. Imperial College of
Science, London has a masters
degree program in 'History of
Technology', offered to
engineering graduates. Stanford is
planning an inter-departmental
engineering curriculum in ecology
and conservation.

Technology is as old as
mankind, perhaps older.
Technology developed primarily
through the slow process of trial
and error. Although through the
evolutionary process technology
registered improvements - some of
them of remarkable significance -
on the whole it remained a
"craft" technology until
eighteenth century. It was based
on craft skills, much labour and
an out-standing ingenuity. Not
until the middle of eighteenth
century, when industrial
revolution began in western
Europe, did a radical change in
technology take place. The new
technology or the industrial
technology infused within itself
the principles of applied sciences,
from which it had kept a decent
distance before.
Technologists were seldom
popular among the academicians.
Until the middle of the eighteenth
century, the natural and physical
scientists had looked upon
technologists with contempt.
They were thought unworthy of
being admitted to the academic
world. The universities had no
place for technologists, their way
of thinking, being practical, was
deemed intellectually rugged.
Even their inventiveness was
considered of low calibre. As
industrial revolution advanced,
the industrial technology gained
maturity and respectability. The
social importance that industrial
revolution gave to the role of
technologists was good enough to
humble the natural and physical
scientists into accepting the
machine scientists as equals. These
new technologists who held
respectable positions in the
academic world were called
"Engineers". In fact they were a
cross breed between the old
technologists and applied
scientists.
The engineers who served the
civilians instead of the army were
called civil engineers. They did all
kinds of engineering jobs. Later
on the hybridizing of technology
to various physical sciences
produced mechanical, electrical,
chemical, electronic, aeronautic
etc. engineers.
Hum animation
A process which might be
called humanization of
technology started during the
early part of this century. Human
conscience could not bear any
longer the ruthless and brutal
atrocities committed by machine
culture on the industrial worker.
There was also great pressure
exerted by the newly organized
workers unions. This new
challenge was met by a new breed
of engineers, the industrial
engineers. His job was to establish
time and performance standards
and to simplify the methods and
processes. His role was to create
fair and comfortable working
conditions for the worker, and to
increase efficience and
productivity which was to the
employer's advantage. From these
humble beginnings the industrial
engineering has come a long way.
Today it has among its folds
specialists in industrial economics,
psychology, organizational
behavior, human factors in
technology, biomechanics,
environment etc., besides
sophisticated mathematical tools
of operations research and
statistics.
The human development
process follows four distinct
stages - the development of new
techniques, their introduction,
adoption (elimination of side
effects) and a steady state. The
state of political, social, and
economic institutions and
organization of a culture influence
the kind of problems and goals

that are set before the engineers.
Until recently, the industrial
revolution being in the
''development'' and
"introduction" stage, the role of
engineers was limited to design,
layout and operation of machines.
Increasing production or services
was what made an engineer
successful. Whether the new
machines and processes caused
harmful effects on human beings
was almost ignored. It is being
increasingly felt now that some
one has to look into the problems
of adoption and side effects of the
industrial technology. Not only is
it important for a present but
more so for the future
development of society. A
technology is well adopted only
after its side effects harmless or
insignificant. How well a society
solves the problems of adoption
and side effects determines its
future growth.
Challenges Ahead
The two great challenges of the
next century are the exploding
population and the leisure time.
These problems in essence are not
new. Once (or perhaps more than
once) before the mankind faced
similiar problems, although the
degree and magnitude were
different. The early agricultural
society grew out of the hunting
and gathering culture. The
agricultural society by comparison
had superior technology, more
material goods, more leisure time
and rather comfortable living

conditions. Since the life in an
agricultural society faced less
natural hazards and was more
stable as compared to the hunting
culture, there also was a mini
population explosion. It was some
time after the introduction of
agricultural techniques that a
steady state was reached which
continued until the industrial
revolution. In a similar fashion,
the introduction of industrial
technology which began about
two hundred years ago in the
West, and is being rapidly injected
in the East, must find a steady
state. The talent and skill required
to approach this steady state will
be provided by a new race of
engineers, the Social Engineers.
Social engineering would most
probably be an off shoot of
industrial engineering. It would
emerge as a result of cross
breeding between social sciences
and engineering disciplines. The
chief task of social engineers
would be to plan and create a new
social set up compatible to the
modern electronic technology.
Besides learning science and
technology, city and town
planning, family structure and
planning, leisure designing etc.,
would be an important part of a
social engineer's curiculum.
In the next century there
would be a great need of social
engineers in the developing
countries with large populations,
such as India, China, Pakistan, and
Indonesia. Because of a rapid

introduction of industrial
technology and a very high
population density, their
problems of adoption and side
effects would reach unpleasant
proportions in the coming
century.
Engineering as it is today is
primarily a male profession. It is
rarely fancied by women. This
would not be true of social
engineering. In fact most

probably be an off shoot of
industrial engineering. It would
emerge as a result of cross
breeding between social sciences
and engineering disciplines. The
chief task of social engineers
would be to plan and create a new
social set up compatible to the
modern electronic technology.
Besides learning science and
technology, city and town
planning, family structure and
planning, leisure designing etc.,
would be an important part of a
social engineer's curiculum.
In the next century there
would be a great need of social
engineers in the developing
countries with large populations,
such as India, China, Pakistan, and
Indonesia. Because of a rapid

introduction of industrial
technology and a very high
population density, their
problems of adoption and side
effects would reach unpleasant
proportions in the coming
century.
Engineering as it is today is
primarily a male profession. It is
rarely fancied by women. This
would not be true of social
engineering. In fact most
successful social engineers would
be women. To be good social
engineer would not only require a
good knowledge of applied and
social sciences, but also a deep
understanding of human nature.
Women because of their
tenderness and highly developed
intuition are perhaps more
suitable.
Some educational institutes
have already felt the need to move
in the right direction.
Loughborough University of
Technology in United Kingdom
offers a masters degree in
'Leisure'. Imperial College of
Science, London has a masters
degree program in 'History of
Technology', offered to
engineering graduates. Stanford is
planning an inter-departmental
engineering curriculum in ecology
and conservation.

Technology is as old as
mankind, perhaps older.
Technology developed primarily
through the slow process of trial
and error. Although through the
evolutionary process technology
registered improvements - some of
them of remarkable significance -
on the whole it remained a
"craft" technology until
eighteenth century. It was based
on craft skills, much labour and
an out-standing ingenuity. Not
until the middle of eighteenth
century, when industrial
revolution began in western
Europe, did a radical change in
technology take place. The new
technology or the industrial
technology infused within itself
the principles of applied sciences,
from which it had kept a decent
distance before.
Technologists were seldom
popular among the academicians.
Until the middle of the eighteenth
century, the natural and physical
scientists had looked upon
technologists with contempt.
They were thought unworthy of
being admitted to the academic
world. The universities had no
place for technologists, their way
of thinking, being practical, was
deemed intellectually rugged.
Even their inventiveness was
considered of low calibre. As
industrial revolution advanced,
the industrial technology gained
maturity and respectability. The
social importance that industrial
revolution gave to the role of
technologists was good enough to
humble the natural and physical
scientists into accepting the
machine scientists as equals. These
new technologists who held
respectable positions in the
academic world were called
"Engineers". In fact they were a
cross breed between the old
technologists and applied
scientists.
The engineers who served the
civilians instead of the army were
called civil engineers. They did all
kinds of engineering jobs. Later
on the hybridizing of technology
to various physical sciences
produced mechanical, electrical,
chemical, electronic, aeronautic
etc. engineers.
Hum animation
A process which might be
called humanization of
technology started during the
early part of this century. Human
conscience could not bear any
longer the ruthless and brutal
atrocities committed by machine
culture on the industrial worker.
There was also great pressure
exerted by the newly organized
workers unions. This new
challenge was met by a new breed
of engineers, the industrial
engineers. His job was to establish
time and performance standards
and to simplify the methods and
processes. His role was to create
fair and comfortable working
conditions for the worker, and to
increase efficience and
productivity which was to the
employer's advantage. From these
humble beginnings the industrial
engineering has come a long way.
Today it has among its folds
specialists in industrial economics,
psychology, organizational
behavior, human factors in
technology, biomechanics,
environment etc., besides
sophisticated mathematical tools
of operations research and
statistics.
The human development
process follows four distinct
stages - the development of new
techniques, their introduction,
adoption (elimination of side
effects) and a steady state. The
state of political, social, and
economic institutions and
organization of a culture influence
the kind of problems and goals

that are set before the engineers.
Until recently, the industrial
revolution being in the
''development'' and
"introduction" stage, the role of
engineers was limited to design,
layout and operation of machines.
Increasing production or services
was what made an engineer
successful. Whether the new
machines and processes caused
harmful effects on human beings
was almost ignored. It is being
increasingly felt now that some
one has to look into the problems
of adoption and side effects of the
industrial technology. Not only is
it important for a present but
more so for the future
development of society. A
technology is well adopted only
after its side effects harmless or
insignificant. How well a society
solves the problems of adoption
and side effects determines its
future growth.
Challenges Ahead
The two great challenges of the
next century are the exploding
population and the leisure time.
These problems in essence are not
new. Once (or perhaps more than
once) before the mankind faced
similiar problems, although the
degree and magnitude were
different. The early agricultural
society grew out of the hunting
and gathering culture. The
agricultural society by comparison
had superior technology, more
material goods, more leisure time
and rather comfortable living

conditions. Since the life in an
agricultural society faced less
natural hazards and was more
stable as compared to the hunting
culture, there also was a mini
population explosion. It was some
time after the introduction of
agricultural techniques that a
steady state was reached which
continued until the industrial
revolution. In a similar fashion,
the introduction of industrial
technology which began about
two hundred years ago in the
West, and is being rapidly injected
in the East, must find a steady
state. The talent and skill required
to approach this steady state will
be provided by a new race of
engineers, the Social Engineers.
Social engineering would most
probably be an off shoot of

emerge as a result of cross

and engineering disciplines. The
