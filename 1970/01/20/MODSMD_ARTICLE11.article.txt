# Crass Roots Booklet
## Do Your Homework 
### Victor von Schlegell 
Many of the points raised in
Boyd Smith's article (January 19)
entitled, "University Replies to
Grass Roots" have been answered
in the Grass Roots booklet; much
of the controversy is, as one might
predict, a matter of
interpretation: Mr. Smith claims,
for example, that the surrounding
communities decide, through a
process of several steps, the uses
of Stanford's lands. The key to
this statement is that the
neigh boring community — which
holds the power to refuse or to
accept annexation — is not the
only community affected by
Stanford's decisions. Coyote Hill
is an example: While it is true that
Palo Alto ultimately decided the
fate of industrial development in
that area, what Mr. Smith fails to
note is that Los Altos Hills is the
community bordering the Hill,
and therefore the community to
which the eyesore, congestion and
pollution is most relevant. Other
communities also affected are not
accorded the privilege of passing
on land use: East Palo Alto,
proven to be the benefactor of
high rents due to the housing
shortage, is not represented in the
decision-making, for example.
With respect to the Academic
Senate's Committee on Land, and
Building Development, Mr. Smith
points out — and correctly — that
that committee has authority over
the development of Stanford's
lands; what he fails to mention is
that the committee has been
shackled by past decisions of the
committee, and is often
intimidated into abiding by the
past committee decision. Coyote
Hill is a good example again: in
late summer, a minority of the
committee asked for a
moratorium on land development
on the Hill, until the committee
could be given the opinions of
groups and communities which
are not represented in Palo Alto.

The Business Office responded by
suggesting that a moratorium
would be a sign of "bad faith" to
developers, and would tie the
Business Office's hands if they
were working with the possibility
of a change in policy with respect
to land use. They further pointed
out that the use of Coyote Hill
had been established by the
committee in 1960, and that it
would be deleterious to break the
earlier decision. While admitting
that they had no notion of
community feeling, the majority
of the committee denied the
moratorium. The examples go on,
but what is salient to note is that
Mr. Smith's allegation is only
partly correct.
Mr. Smith also maintains that
"hindsight is a wonderful asset"
with respect to low cost housing.
But he neglects to mention that
the University was blessed with
foresight: a study by Patti Wilson,
completed for last year's Moulton
Committee on Low Cost Housing,
reveals that Alf Brandin, Vice
President for Business Affairs,
admitted to being able to predict
the obvious need for housing for
increasingly diversified groups of
people, but that the University
did not see providing for their
housing as its responsibility.
One can answer the rest of Mr.
Smith's column along the same
lines; I would recommend that the
Grass Roots booklet be read. Mr.
Smith finally maintains "to stop
planned developments because of
the superficial and often
un-substantiated objections of a
small minority would be
impossible in view of the long
chain of irrevocable
committments already in effect,"
but does not fully substantiate
that claim, as evidence provided
above suggests. One of those
"irrevocable commitments" is to
Fairchild Semi-Conductor, for
example, which is beginning

construction on Coyote Hill.
While ostensibly a "clean"
company, semi-conductor
production in fact is a serious
pollution-producer. Are these the
irrevocable commitments which
the University must honor? One
would certainly hope not. The
long-run effects of Stanford's land
development policies can only be
estimated — but such estimation
has not even really begun. The
University, through a letter by
Robert Riley, predecessor to Mr.
Smith, carefully excluded Coyote
Hill, from the Livingston and
Blaney Foothills Environmental
Study , for example: this was to be
the study to be used in
determining the future of the
foothills.
On the basis of these
arguments, and those which are to
be found in the Grass Roots
booklet, I would recommend the
following:
First, that the University
declare a moratorium on further
land development, until an
accurate estimate can be made of
both short-run and long-run
effects of the policies.
Secondly, that the University
set about to re-think funding as
provided by land development —
how crucial is it in fact, and can
alternative means of support be
located?
Third, that a subcommittee of
the Committee on Land and
Building Development be
established to constantly review
plans for land development as
they evolve in the Business Office.
These are only a few, and are,
of course, confined to Stanford.
But in addition, the University
should, I think, establish channels
by which community opinion —
from Los Altos Hills, East Palo
Alto, Menlo Park, etc., can be
measured and used in
decision-making.
