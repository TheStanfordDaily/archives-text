Middle American docs his

hditor, THF. DAILY:
Patrick Cunningham's letter on
January 16, HOPE, has prompted
me to write this letter. I do not
intend to take issue with
Cunningham on his views of Bob
Hope. But his belittling and
ridiculing references to middle
America hit home—and hard. If
there has been one attitude in
liberal Stanford thought which I
have noticed more than anything
else, it is the disparaging view of
middle class Americans, which
bespeaks to me nothing but
intellectual snobbery and gross
short-si gh te d ness.
I am a Stanford student, and
the offspring of so-called middle
Americans. My family is not
impoverished, but we are not well
off, only because my mother
works as well as my father,
sometimes taking in more than
him.
I worked hard to get into this
school, both academically, and on
the job, and my financial future
after this year is uncertain. But we
have learned to respect hard work,
though it may not be easy; the
value of capitalism, though wo
have not received all of its
benefits; and in these tumultous
times, respect for authority. I am

indebted to my parents for the
help they have given me through
loans, mortages, and sacrifice.
This does not mean that middle
America can't oppose war. Many
do, including my own parents.
They feel their hard earned
money is surely being employed
for futile purposes, and that it is
morally wrong. They, too, have
misgivings about Spiro Agnew,
and strongly distrust, but attempt
to respect, President Nixon. They,
too, are well read, informed, well
mannered, and appreciative of the
arts. But they oppose those who
scoff at them when they are
working hard in a physically
exhausting occupation to keep
America going and to help
America improve, usually with
barely adequate compensation. It
hurts my parents, and it hurts me,
to see intellectual, social, or racial
minorities reduce the value of
democracy to glorified
armtwisting, or to suddenly
subject the hard working middle
Americans to their idealistic, but
sadly unrealistic ideologies.
When I came to Stanford, I was
expecting to find a more
factually-based liberalism than I
found in high school. I am
disappointed. I have come to the
conclusion that it would behoove
many liberals and leftists who so

handily criticize middle America,
to endure for a prolonged period
of time the hopes, ups, downs,
and hardships of middle America.
I fear it is too easy for them to sit
back and cautiously analyze
middle America in a totally
academic vein, without being able
to understand or to empathize
with this sector of American
society.
It is time some people realized
that middle America—despite the
fact that it is predominantly
white, that it deplores the
dissolution of long-established
values, and that it established
many of these values—that middle
America, too, has a dream: to be
understood.
I'm part of it, and I'm proud.
IN o Longer Silent
Draft Hearings
K (I it or, Till, DAILY:
The draft lottery has brought
more than confusion to the
problem of military service for
Stanford men. When Senator
Kennedy agreed to support (he
President's bill this fall, the price
was draft reform hearings this
spring prior to the 1971
expiration of the Selective Service
law. The war continues and Mr.

Laird recently announced that the
administration would request that
all but medical and hardship
deferments be terminated or
phased out. It seems that the
administration has quietly shelved
the idea of a volunteer army, a
campaign promise of Mr. Nixon.
Surprised by the sudden
decision for early hearings,
advocates of outright repeal of the
draft have little time to organize
before hearings commence. If
hearings result in even minor
changes in the law this year, there
is little chance of outright repeal
when the draft comes up for
reenactment next year. We have
several months at best to block a
slightly "reformed" draft law
which won't be seriously
considered again for a long five
years.
We urge all individuals
interested in getting rid of the
dralt to attend the meeting in the
small lounge of Tresidder on
Wednesday afternoon, January
21st, at 4:30.

intend to take issue with
Cunningham on his views of Bob
Hope. But his belittling and
ridiculing references to middle
America hit home—and hard. If
there has been one attitude in
liberal Stanford thought which I
have noticed more than anything
else, it is the disparaging view of
middle class Americans, which
bespeaks to me nothing but
intellectual snobbery and gross
short-si gh te d ness.
I am a Stanford student, and
the offspring of so-called middle
Americans. My family is not
impoverished, but we are not well
off, only because my mother
works as well as my father,
sometimes taking in more than
him.
I worked hard to get into this
school, both academically, and on
the job, and my financial future
after this year is uncertain. But we
have learned to respect hard work,
though it may not be easy; the
value of capitalism, though wo
have not received all of its
benefits; and in these tumultous
times, respect for authority. I am

indebted to my parents for the
help they have given me through
loans, mortages, and sacrifice.
This does not mean that middle
America can't oppose war. Many
do, including my own parents.
They feel their hard earned
money is surely being employed
for futile purposes, and that it is
morally wrong. They, too, have
misgivings about Spiro Agnew,
and strongly distrust, but attempt
to respect, President Nixon. They,
too, are well read, informed, well
mannered, and appreciative of the
arts. But they oppose those who
scoff at them when they are
working hard in a physically
exhausting occupation to keep
America going and to help
America improve, usually with
barely adequate compensation. It
hurts my parents, and it hurts me,
to see intellectual, social, or racial
minorities reduce the value of
democracy to glorified
armtwisting, or to suddenly
subject the hard working middle
Americans to their idealistic, but
sadly unrealistic ideologies.
When I came to Stanford, I was
expecting to find a more
factually-based liberalism than I
found in high school. I am
disappointed. I have come to the
conclusion that it would behoove
many liberals and leftists who so

handily criticize middle America,
to endure for a prolonged period
of time the hopes, ups, downs,
and hardships of middle America.
I fear it is too easy for them to sit
back and cautiously analyze
middle America in a totally
academic vein, without being able
to understand or to empathize
with this sector of American
society.
It is time some people realized
that middle America—despite the
fact that it is predominantly
white, that it deplores the
dissolution of long-established
values, and that it established
many of these values—that middle
America, too, has a dream: to be
understood.
I'm part of it, and I'm proud.
IN o Longer Silent
Draft Hearings
K (I it or, Till, DAILY:
The draft lottery has brought
more than confusion to the
problem of military service for
Stanford men. When Senator
Kennedy agreed to support (he
President's bill this fall, the price
was draft reform hearings this
spring prior to the 1971
expiration of the Selective Service
law. The war continues and Mr.

Laird recently announced that the
administration would request that
all but medical and hardship
deferments be terminated or
phased out. It seems that the
administration has quietly shelved
the idea of a volunteer army, a
campaign promise of Mr. Nixon.
Surprised by the sudden
decision for early hearings,
advocates of outright repeal of the
draft have little time to organize
before hearings commence. If
hearings result in even minor
changes in the law this year, there
is little chance of outright repeal
when the draft comes up for
reenactment next year. We have
several months at best to block a
slightly "reformed" draft law
which won't be seriously
considered again for a long five
years.
We urge all individuals
interested in getting rid of the
dralt to attend the meeting in the
small lounge of Tresidder on
Wednesday afternoon, January
21st, at 4:30.
