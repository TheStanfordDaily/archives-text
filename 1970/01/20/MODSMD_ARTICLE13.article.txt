# Job Market Diminishing For Modern Language PhD's
## 
### 
"Sorry, PhDs, Stanford's not
hiring this year."
Such words coming from many
Modern Language departments of
universities across the country
may increase student uneasiness
about future jobs for PhDs.
The Modern Language
Association (MLA) annual
convention is a little publicized
job hunting market except among
professors and terminal graduate
students in the modern languages
of English, German, French and
Italian, and Spanish and
Portuguese. Many graduating
PhDs attend the annual
convention looking for jobs while
professors attend to interview
applicants, see old friends or to
hear scholarly lectures. This year's
MLA convention was in Denver,
Colorado from December 26-30,
1969.
After spending four or more
years preparing for a PhD and an
academic career, what job
opportunities does a terminal grad
student in modern languages have
to look forward to? Lan Watt,
chairman of the English
Department at Stanford said,
"About one third the jobs in
' 4 pr e s t i g i o us " English
Departments are available this
year as compared with five years
ago." Watt, who helped prepare
students of his department for the
convention and visited Denver
himself during the meeting,
stressed that there are jobs for all
PhDs but that expectations may
not be met as to placement.
Preparation
Preparation for the MLA starts
for a grad student at the beginning
of his final year. He has to write
letters of introduction to all
institutions in which he is
interested. The German
Department at Stanford says in an
information bulletin to its
terminal grad students that 40 to
50 letters is not excessive and the
English Department recommends
from 20 to 50 letters (at times
twice that number are written)
saying that replies expressing
interest are rarely more than 10
percent of the original number of
letters.
The English Department at
Stanford received over 300 initial
letters of introduction from
students across the country last
year and this year over 700 letters
were received though no positions
will be opening.
The next step in preparation is
scheduling of interviews to be
made at the convention which is
done in the fall or often at the
convention itself.
Central Meeting Place
Very few jobs are finalized at
the MLA Convention; basically
the convention provides an
opportunity for a central meeting
place for interviews which may
later be acted upon when
departments know their operating
budgets and hiring plans. All
Stanford modern language
department chairmen felt that
their own final year grad students
would be placed this year without
too much difficulty.
Placement advice from a
student's department varies with
the size of the department.
Stanford's Spanish Department,
for example, has four terminal
PhDs and can provide advising on
an individual level as can the
German and French departments.
The English department provides

students with a general
comprehensive information sheet
in conjunction with individual
advising. This year for the first
time the department had an
official placement advisor to
direct students and answer
questions. Professor Fred C.
Robinson was the advisor and
worked with Watt in aiding and
informing grad students.
This year's convention was
originally scheduled to be in
Chicago but was transferred to
Denver as a political expression
against Chicago for the
occurrences during the
Democratic National Convention
in 1967.
Too Small
Responses to Denver varied but
most MLA people felt that the
city was too small for the
convention. In addition, inclement
weather grounded several East
Coast flights into Denver during
the convention and travel
expenses kept other people away
from the mile-high city.
Opinion of the convention
itself by Stanford students ranged
from positive response to remarks
that the convention was "very
tedious." One student said, "I've
never drunk so much in an equal
period of time in my life."
lan Watt, with aid from others,
wrote a 12 page information
paper last year to aid his terminal
grad students with information
about placement. He said that
with the large number of final
year students in the English
Department (15), individual
advising of general proceedures is
impossible.
"Slave-Market"
Watt comments about the
convention in the paper saying,
"Its most violent antagonists
present it as merely a slave-market
organized by senior mediocrities
to humiliate young job-seekers
into a paralyzed docility." He
continues, "Slaves, however, have
never negotiated their own fates
nor drawn their own salaries; nor
do they usually institute the
market themselves."
The number of graduate
students across the country is
increasing. In modern languages
the present 30,000 members of
the MLA are double the number
of members of five years ago.
Statistics prepared by Watt show
that the Stanford English
Department had 119 grad
students, 260 undergrads and 6
PhDs conferred in 1959. In 1969
the grads numbered 130,
undergrads 569 and 26 PhDs were
given. During that ten year period
the number of grad students
fluctuated but the number of
undergrads in English increased
steadily each year.
The tendency toward an
increasing number of
undergraduate majors in all
departments indicates that more
demands will be made for
entrance to grad schools with
eventual greater increase in job
demand. However, during the
next few years this spiraling
tendency will be slowed down at
the graduate school level. Namely,
quotas of entering students will be
decreased. This braking will be
due in part to a near overflow of
PhDs on the job market and to
budget tightening in many

universities such as Stanford itself
which will limit financial aid and
hiring of new faculty.
Recession
Department chairmen at
Stanford hope that the necessary
recession will last only three or
four years and then allow for
expansion again. Bernard
Gicovate, chairman of the Spanish
Department, noted that for
Spanish PhDs there are more good
people and fewer number of good
jobs available which indicates the
general problem of all PhD job
seekers.
Lan Watt has pointed out that
with the decreasing number of
"prestigious" job opportunities,
PhDs in the U.S. will have to
consider filling growing demands
for competent teachers elsewhere
such as in junior colleges.
"But in one way or another,
alas," states Watt's information
sheet, "it has always been true
that the academic garland has 'to
be run for, not without dust and
heat."
"Sorry, PhDs, Stanford's not
hiring this year."

Modern Language departments of

Stanford hope that the necessary
recession will last only three or
four years and then allow for
expansion again. Bernard
Gicovate, chairman of the Spanish
Department, noted that for
Spanish PhDs there are more good
people and fewer number of good
jobs available which indicates the
general problem of all PhD job
seekers.
Lan Watt has pointed out that
with the decreasing number of
"prestigious" job opportunities,
PhDs in the U.S. will have to
consider filling growing demands
for competent teachers elsewhere
such as in junior colleges.
"But in one way or another,
alas," states Watt's information
sheet, "it has always been true
that the academic garland has 'to
be run for, not without dust and
heat."
"Sorry, PhDs, Stanford's not
hiring this year."
Such words coming from many
Modern Language departments of
universities across the country
may increase student uneasiness
about future jobs for PhDs.
The Modern Language
Association (MLA) annual
convention is a little publicized
job hunting market except among
professors and terminal graduate
students in the modern languages
of English, German, French and
Italian, and Spanish and
Portuguese. Many graduating
PhDs attend the annual
convention looking for jobs while
professors attend to interview
applicants, see old friends or to
hear scholarly lectures. This year's
MLA convention was in Denver,
Colorado from December 26-30,
1969.
After spending four or more
years preparing for a PhD and an
academic career, what job
opportunities does a terminal grad
student in modern languages have
to look forward to? Lan Watt,
chairman of the English
Department at Stanford said,
"About one third the jobs in
' 4 pr e s t i g i o us " English
Departments are available this
year as compared with five years
ago." Watt, who helped prepare
students of his department for the
convention and visited Denver
himself during the meeting,
stressed that there are jobs for all
PhDs but that expectations may
not be met as to placement.
Preparation
Preparation for the MLA starts
for a grad student at the beginning
of his final year. He has to write
letters of introduction to all
institutions in which he is
interested. The German
Department at Stanford says in an
information bulletin to its
terminal grad students that 40 to
50 letters is not excessive and the
English Department recommends
from 20 to 50 letters (at times
twice that number are written)
saying that replies expressing
interest are rarely more than 10
percent of the original number of
letters.
The English Department at
Stanford received over 300 initial
letters of introduction from
students across the country last
year and this year over 700 letters
were received though no positions
will be opening.
The next step in preparation is
scheduling of interviews to be
made at the convention which is
done in the fall or often at the
convention itself.
Central Meeting Place
Very few jobs are finalized at
the MLA Convention; basically
the convention provides an
opportunity for a central meeting
place for interviews which may
later be acted upon when
departments know their operating
budgets and hiring plans. All
Stanford modern language
department chairmen felt that
their own final year grad students
would be placed this year without
too much difficulty.
Placement advice from a
student's department varies with
the size of the department.
Stanford's Spanish Department,
for example, has four terminal
PhDs and can provide advising on
an individual level as can the
German and French departments.
The English department provides

students with a general
comprehensive information sheet
in conjunction with individual
advising. This year for the first
time the department had an
official placement advisor to
direct students and answer
questions. Professor Fred C.
Robinson was the advisor and
worked with Watt in aiding and
informing grad students.
This year's convention was
originally scheduled to be in
Chicago but was transferred to
Denver as a political expression
against Chicago for the
occurrences during the
Democratic National Convention
in 1967.
Too Small
Responses to Denver varied but
most MLA people felt that the
city was too small for the
convention. In addition, inclement
weather grounded several East
Coast flights into Denver during
the convention and travel
expenses kept other people away
from the mile-high city.
Opinion of the convention
itself by Stanford students ranged
from positive response to remarks
that the convention was "very
tedious." One student said, "I've
never drunk so much in an equal
period of time in my life."
lan Watt, with aid from others,
wrote a 12 page information
paper last year to aid his terminal
grad students with information
about placement. He said that
with the large number of final
year students in the English
Department (15), individual
advising of general proceedures is
impossible.
"Slave-Market"
Watt comments about the
convention in the paper saying,
"Its most violent antagonists
present it as merely a slave-market
organized by senior mediocrities
to humiliate young job-seekers
into a paralyzed docility." He
continues, "Slaves, however, have
never negotiated their own fates
nor drawn their own salaries; nor
do they usually institute the
market themselves."
The number of graduate
students across the country is
increasing. In modern languages
the present 30,000 members of
the MLA are double the number
of members of five years ago.
Statistics prepared by Watt show
that the Stanford English
Department had 119 grad
students, 260 undergrads and 6
PhDs conferred in 1959. In 1969
the grads numbered 130,
undergrads 569 and 26 PhDs were
given. During that ten year period
the number of grad students
fluctuated but the number of
undergrads in English increased
steadily each year.
The tendency toward an
increasing number of
undergraduate majors in all
departments indicates that more
demands will be made for
entrance to grad schools with
eventual greater increase in job
demand. However, during the
next few years this spiraling
tendency will be slowed down at
the graduate school level. Namely,
quotas of entering students will be
decreased. This braking will be
due in part to a near overflow of
PhDs on the job market and to
budget tightening in many

universities such as Stanford itself
which will limit financial aid and
hiring of new faculty.

the number of grad students
fluctuated but the number of
undergrads in English increased
steadily each year.
The tendency toward an
increasing number of
undergraduate majors in all
departments indicates that more
demands will be made for
entrance to grad schools with
eventual greater increase in job
demand. However, during the
next few years this spiraling
tendency will be slowed down at
the graduate school level. Namely,
quotas of entering students will be
decreased. This braking will be
due in part to a near overflow of
PhDs on the job market and to
budget tightening in many

universities such as Stanford itself
which will limit financial aid and
hiring of new faculty.
Recession
Department chairmen at
Stanford hope that the necessary
recession will last only three or
four years and then allow for
expansion again. Bernard
Gicovate, chairman of the Spanish
Department, noted that for
Spanish PhDs there are more good
people and fewer number of good
jobs available which indicates the
general problem of all PhD job
seekers.
Lan Watt has pointed out that
with the decreasing number of
"prestigious" job opportunities,
PhDs in the U.S. will have to
consider filling growing demands
for competent teachers elsewhere
such as in junior colleges.
"But in one way or another,
alas," states Watt's information
sheet, "it has always been true
that the academic garland has 'to
be run for, not without dust and
heat."
"Sorry, PhDs, Stanford's not
hiring this year."
Such words coming from many
Modern Language departments of
universities across the country
may increase student uneasiness
about future jobs for PhDs.
The Modern Language
Association (MLA) annual
convention is a little publicized
job hunting market except among
professors and terminal graduate
students in the modern languages
of English, German, French and
Italian, and Spanish and
Portuguese. Many graduating
PhDs attend the annual
convention looking for jobs while
professors attend to interview
applicants, see old friends or to
hear scholarly lectures. This year's
MLA convention was in Denver,
Colorado from December 26-30,
1969.
After spending four or more
years preparing for a PhD and an
academic career, what job
opportunities does a terminal grad
student in modern languages have
to look forward to? Lan Watt,
chairman of the English
Department at Stanford said,
"About one third the jobs in
' 4 pr e s t i g i o us " English
Departments are available this
year as compared with five years
ago." Watt, who helped prepare
students of his department for the
convention and visited Denver
himself during the meeting,
stressed that there are jobs for all
PhDs but that expectations may
not be met as to placement.
Preparation
Preparation for the MLA starts
for a grad student at the beginning
of his final year. He has to write
letters of introduction to all
institutions in which he is
interested. The German
Department at Stanford says in an
information bulletin to its
terminal grad students that 40 to
50 letters is not excessive and the
English Department recommends
from 20 to 50 letters (at times
twice that number are written)
saying that replies expressing
interest are rarely more than 10
percent of the original number of
letters.
The English Department at
Stanford received over 300 initial
letters of introduction from
students across the country last
year and this year over 700 letters
were received though no positions
will be opening.
The next step in preparation is
scheduling of interviews to be
made at the convention which is
done in the fall or often at the
convention itself.
Central Meeting Place
Very few jobs are finalized at
the MLA Convention; basically
the convention provides an
opportunity for a central meeting
place for interviews which may
later be acted upon when
departments know their operating
budgets and hiring plans. All
Stanford modern language
department chairmen felt that
their own final year grad students
would be placed this year without
too much difficulty.
Placement advice from a
student's department varies with
the size of the department.
Stanford's Spanish Department,
for example, has four terminal
PhDs and can provide advising on
an individual level as can the
German and French departments.
The English department provides

students with a general
comprehensive information sheet
in conjunction with individual
advising. This year for the first
time the department had an
official placement advisor to
direct students and answer
questions. Professor Fred C.
Robinson was the advisor and
worked with Watt in aiding and
informing grad students.
This year's convention was
originally scheduled to be in
Chicago but was transferred to
Denver as a political expression
against Chicago for the
occurrences during the
Democratic National Convention
in 1967.
Too Small
Responses to Denver varied but
most MLA people felt that the
city was too small for the
convention. In addition, inclement
weather grounded several East
Coast flights into Denver during
the convention and travel
expenses kept other people away
from the mile-high city.
Opinion of the convention
itself by Stanford students ranged
from positive response to remarks
that the convention was "very
tedious." One student said, "I've
never drunk so much in an equal
period of time in my life."
lan Watt, with aid from others,
wrote a 12 page information
paper last year to aid his terminal
grad students with information
about placement. He said that
with the large number of final
year students in the English
Department (15), individual
advising of general proceedures is
impossible.
"Slave-Market"
Watt comments about the
convention in the paper saying,
"Its most violent antagonists
present it as merely a slave-market
organized by senior mediocrities
to humiliate young job-seekers
into a paralyzed docility." He
continues, "Slaves, however, have
never negotiated their own fates
nor drawn their own salaries; nor
do they usually institute the
market themselves."
The number of graduate
students across the country is
increasing. In modern languages
the present 30,000 members of
the MLA are double the number
of members of five years ago.
Statistics prepared by Watt show
that the Stanford English
Department had 119 grad
students, 260 undergrads and 6
PhDs conferred in 1959. In 1969
the grads numbered 130,
undergrads 569 and 26 PhDs were
given. During that ten year period
the number of grad students
fluctuated but the number of
undergrads in English increased
steadily each year.
