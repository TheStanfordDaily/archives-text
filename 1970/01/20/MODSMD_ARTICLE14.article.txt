# Myths About Campus Protest Challenged By Urban Group
## 
### 
Black student protests at
colleges and universities are more
numerous and more successful
than those instigated by white
students, according to a study of
student protests last year. Urban
Research Corporation study
covered pro tests on 232
campuses, representing a third of
the nation's student enrollment.
The study reported that
forty-nine percent of the protests
were initiated by black students
demanding black studies
programs, more black faculty and
students, better facilities and
other reforms. Their demands
were rejected only half as often as
those made by white and mixed
student groups.
Surprisingly, the Vietnam
war was not one of the more
popular issues. John Naisbitt,
president of Urban Research
Corp. and an assistant to former
HEW Secretary John W. Gardner,
said, "The incidence of war as a
major factor in protests was far
less than the incidence of race or
'student power' issues. This would
tend to contradict major
assumptions by national
policymakers that an end to the
Vietnam war and the draft will
end campus problems. The draft,
for example, was a major factor in
only 1 percent of all protests."

Naisbitt reported that the
study was undertaken as a result
of information received by the
organization which "seemed to
conflict with many widespread
impressions."
Statistical data used in the
report was obtained through
computer analysis of 292
individual protest profiles. Each
profile had been checked for
accuracy by the concerned
students and administrators.
A second popular belief
challenged by the study is that of
New Left involvement in campus
protests. The report found that
"Students for a Democratic
Society and other organizations
with identifiably radical views,
commitments and rhetoric were
active in less than half of the
white protests and in only 28
percent of all protests," the study
said.
The New Left political groups
are often blamed for the majority
of campus protests.
Other statistics in the study
included totals of 3652 student
arrests, 156 expulsions and 708
probations. Injuries occurred in
22 percent of the protests and
property was damaged in 19
percent.
