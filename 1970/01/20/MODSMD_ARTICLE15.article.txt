# Felix Block To Speak
## Physics In Modern Society 
### 
A 1952 Nobel Prize winner in
physics, Prof. Felix Bloch, will tell
"How I Became a Physicist" in
the third lecture of a series being
presented by Stanford physicists
to explain the role of physics in
modern society.
Bloch, whose work brought
him close to such great scientists
as Bohr, Heisenberg, and Fermi,
will speak about his own
development at 8 tonight in the
Physics Lecture Hall. His lecture
will be open to the public.
In a recent campus interview,
Bloch spoke of the unique
individuality of the famous
physicists he has known.
"Except for their common
interest in physics," he said, "I
can think of no characteristic
shared by all of them. I would
have to describe each separately,
and I could speak for an hour
about each one.
"For example a great man like
Niels Bohr, whom I admired
tremendously as one of the most
profound thinkers of our time,
could not be characterized in a
few words. Nor can one separate
the entire personality of such a
man from his work as a
physicistâ€”his discoveries were a
natural outgrowth of the deep
understanding with which he
looked at the whole world."
Regarding some student
complaints that universities place
too much emphasis on research
and not enough on teaching,
Block said: "You teach while you
are doing research and you learn

while you teach. I've always
deplored the separation of the
two in a university. It is bad to do
nothing but teach, or to do
research to the exclusion of
contact with students."
While he prefers non-military
research himself, the Stanford
physicist said he felt that the
choice is an individual matter.
"I would not abstain from basic
research just because I don't know
what it will lead to," he said.
"When I did basic research I never
thought of the applications. It was
the best research 1 did, though

some of my work may have
contributed to electronic devices
on battleships.
"Of course this does not mean I
am not in sympathy, for example,
with critics who say we have our
priorities mixed up. There is much
truth in that.
"To demand that we readjust
our priorities is very fair. The
trouble with that is, of course,
that many young people are very
inexperienced and impatient."
Bloch said there is no question
that the "abrupt way" cutbacks
of government research funds
u ?.ve been initiated will hurt
physics.
