# Nation Plans For Ecology Teach-In
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP>-Opponents
of environmental pollution are
organizing a nationwide wave of
campus rallies with some big-name
speakers April 22.
The "Earth Day" campaign
was disclosed Sunday by the
Environmental Teach-in Inc., a
student group formed to take up
the suggestion first put forward
by Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis.,
and Rep. Paul McCloskey, R-Calif.
"We've heard from about 350
colleges, who have written about
what they can do," said Philip
Taubman, spokesman for the
group and presently a Stanford
senior. "About 50 are really well
along in their plans.
"Some of the activity actually
starts before April 22," Taubman
said. "The first is this week at
Northwestern where there will be
an all-night teach-in on
environment Friday."
A large conference on
environmental problems is
planned at the University of
Michigan in March, Taubman
added.
The April 22 activities will be
similar in form to the local-level
programs of the Vietnam
Moratorium war protesters last
fall with an emphasis on campus
and community participation.
At this stage, at least, the
project is strictly educational, not
political, Taubman said,
"although there may be places
well informed enough that they'll
want to press for specific
reforms."

"One of the things that we've
been suggesting, is thai they
conduct environmental
inventories to look at their local
problems, locate them and study
them," said Linda Billings, a
former member of Nelson's staff
now with the Teach-in.
Sponsors say they are inviting
name speakers, including
politicians and environment
experts, to take part in the rallies
and conferences. Nelson's office
says he expects to accept several
speaking invitations.
Nelson and McCloskey fostered
the organization, "but they have
pretty much pulled back from it
now, letting the students run it,"
a Nelson aide said.
Nelson has been invited to
meet with United Nations
Secretary General I! Thant later
this month, and an aide says the
Teach-in approach to
environmental problems is
expected to be a chief topic.
What happens with Teach-in
depends on what happens April
22, said Taubman. "If there is a
demand for other days like this
then we will have to decide what
to do. Right now, the staff is just
here until April 22 or a few days
after "
Teach-in ran a full page
advertisement in Sunday editions
of the New York Times asking
support of the campaign.
The ad said April 22 "is a day
to challenge the corporate and
governmental leaders who promise
change, but who short change the
necessary programs."

problems, locate them and study
them," said Linda Billings, a
former member of Nelson's staff
now with the Teach-in.
Sponsors say they are inviting
name speakers, including
politicians and environment
experts, to take part in the rallies
and conferences. Nelson's office
says he expects to accept several
speaking invitations.
Nelson and McCloskey fostered
the organization, "but they have
pretty much pulled back from it
now, letting the students run it,"
a Nelson aide said.
Nelson has been invited to
meet with United Nations
Secretary General I! Thant later
this month, and an aide says the
Teach-in approach to
environmental problems is
expected to be a chief topic.
What happens with Teach-in
depends on what happens April
22, said Taubman. "If there is a
demand for other days like this
then we will have to decide what
to do. Right now, the staff is just
here until April 22 or a few days
after "
Teach-in ran a full page
advertisement in Sunday editions
of the New York Times asking
support of the campaign.
The ad said April 22 "is a day
to challenge the corporate and
governmental leaders who promise
change, but who short change the
necessary programs."
WASHINGTON (AP>-Opponents
of environmental pollution are
organizing a nationwide wave of
campus rallies with some big-name
speakers April 22.
The "Earth Day" campaign
was disclosed Sunday by the
Environmental Teach-in Inc., a
student group formed to take up
the suggestion first put forward
by Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis.,
and Rep. Paul McCloskey, R-Calif.
"We've heard from about 350
colleges, who have written about
what they can do," said Philip
Taubman, spokesman for the
group and presently a Stanford
senior. "About 50 are really well
along in their plans.
"Some of the activity actually
starts before April 22," Taubman
said. "The first is this week at
Northwestern where there will be
an all-night teach-in on
environment Friday."
A large conference on
environmental problems is
planned at the University of
Michigan in March, Taubman
added.
The April 22 activities will be
similar in form to the local-level
programs of the Vietnam
Moratorium war protesters last
fall with an emphasis on campus
and community participation.
At this stage, at least, the
project is strictly educational, not
political, Taubman said,
"although there may be places
well informed enough that they'll
want to press for specific
reforms."

"One of the things that we've
been suggesting, is thai they
conduct environmental
inventories to look at their local
problems, locate them and study
them," said Linda Billings, a
former member of Nelson's staff
now with the Teach-in.
