## New Court Nominee 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon reached into the federal
judiciary yesterday and picked a
circuit judge named George
Harrold Carswell to serve as a
justice of the Supreme Court
succeeding Abe Fortas who
resigned under fire.
The nomination was sent to the
Senate in late afternoon. Hearings
by the Judiciary Committee are
expected to begin Jan. 27.
A repeat of last year's struggle
over Nixon's first nomination of a
Fortas successor seems unlikely.
The nomination of Carswell to
the seat left vacant by the
resignation of Fortas last May was
announced by Ronald L. Ziegler,
the White House press secretary,
who said the 50-year-old judge
meets President Nixon's desires to
have a "strict constructionist" sit
on the bench.
Carswell, of Tallahassee, Fla.,
has been a federal judge since
1958. A Democrat turned
Republican, he was named chief

judge for the Northern District of
Florida by former President
Dwight D. Eisenhower and
elevated to the sth U.S. Circuit
Court of New Orleans by Nixon.
Ziegler said Carswell's personal
and judicial background, including
financial holdings and income tax
returns, were investigated with the
result the judge received a
complete clearance.
There was no immediate
indication from Capitol Hill that
the Carswell nomination will draw
substantial opposition in the
Senate which last year refused to
confirm Circuit Judge Clement F.
Haynsworth Jr. for the Fortas
seat.
Draft Rulings
WASHINGTON (AP) - Local
draft boards were barred Monday
by the Supreme Court from
' ceding the induction of
Vietnam war protesters.
The only punishment Selective
Service law provides is
prosecution for resisting
induction, said Justice William O.
Douglas in a 5-3 decision.
The law, he said, does not give
the Selective Service System
"free-wheeling authority to ride
herd on the registrants using
immediate induction as a
disciplinary or vindictive
measure."
The ruling rejected the Justice
Department's twin contentions
that the regulations were not
being used to punish and that
they should be available to correct
violations of draft law.
"If federal or state laws are
violated by registrants, they can
be prosecuted," Douglas said.
"If induction is to be
substituted for these prosecutions,
a vast rewriting of the act is
needed." At the same time the
court rejected a plea by Lawrence
R. Velvel, a University of Kansas
law professor, that it declare the
Vietnam war unconstitutional.

Biafra Aid
LAGOS (AP) — An American ship
loaded with 5,000 tons of food

U.N. Secretary-General U Thant
wound up a fact-finding visit to
Lagos declaring "I am convinced
that the process of national
reconciliation has started very
auspiciously."
Thant said Heindrich Beer,
head of the League of Red Cross
Societies, has returned from a visit
to what was Biafra and reported
he had found "no hint or even the
slightest, remotest evidence of
violence or mistreatment of Ibos
by federal forces."
