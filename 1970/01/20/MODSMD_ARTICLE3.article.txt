# Fire Damages Sterling Home
## 
### 
Fire caused extensive damage
Monday to the Woodside home of
Chancellor Wallace Sterling.
Sterling was in Washington, D.
C., and his wife had left the house
but did not get back until more
than an hour after the fire broke
out in the first-floor kitchen area.
A private officer of the
Woodside Patrol noticed the
smoke and flames shortly after he
had checked the residence.
Sterling's private office and
study on the second floor of the
old two-story house at 2220
Stockbridge were unharmed,
although damage on the first floor
appeared extensive.
In July 1968, over $100,000
damage occured in a fire in
Sterling's office on campus. The
July fire was set by arsonists.
