# Pitzer Asks Limited Credit For ROTC; Faculty To Decide
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Limited academic credit will be
allowed Army Reserve Officer's
Training Corps (ROTC) courses
according to a recommendation
from President Kenneth Pitzer.
Pitzer released a student-faculty
report yesterday recommending
that Army ROTC courses be
reviewed "in accordance with
normal University procedures and
granted appropriate academic
credit for those courses which
meet established University
standards." There would be no
automatic or blanket credit—each
course would be submitted to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies for approval.
The report also recommended
abolishing departmental status for
ROTC and replacing it with a
Center For Military Studies. In
addition it suggests changing the
title of the Professor of Military
Science to "Director" with all
faculty privileges except that of
membership in the Academic
Council.
The faculty Senate will
consider the report at its regular
meeting Thursday. Pitzer
"strongly" urged favorable action
by the Senate, which is required
for credit to be given.
Previous Senate Decision
Last spring the faculty Senate
decided that "after a transitional
period, there should be no
academic credit received for
participation in programs of
military training and education."
This is set to take effect with the
freshman class next fall. The
Senate's action followed a
faculty-student committee
in-depth study of the position of
ROTC at Stanford.
The President's Advisory
Committee on ROTC affairs was
appointed last spring to work out
details for the "revision or
termination of the contracts
between Stanford and the armed
forces. . ." in line with the
decisions of the faculty Senate.
Colonel Stanley Ramey,
professor of military science, said
that Army ROTC will request six
to nine units of credit from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which has the power to
grant academic credit for
non-departmental programs.
Army ROTC students may now
take up to 27 of the 180 course
units required for graduation from
military teachers.
24 Unit Minimum Asked
Colonel Robert Thomas,
professor of naval science, said,
"A minimum of 24 units would
be the smallest number submitted
for credit (by Navy ROTC).
A minority of the eight
member committee dissented.
Alan Manne, professor in the
graduate school of business, and
Lyman P. Van Slyke, professor of
history and a member of the
student-faculty study of ROTC
last year, said, "Stanford is being
asked to adopt the DOD's
(Department of Defense) position,
and thereby to reverse last spring's
faculty decision."
Faculty Action Termed Decisive
Calling the faculty action of
last spring "a sound one and long
overdue", Manne and Van Slvke

said, "In the matter of academic
credit, we believe that faculty
views ought to be decisive, and
that the faculty has already
expressed its views
unambiguously."
This report deals only with the
Army ROTC and is based on a
proposal of Col. Ramey from the
Army. Navy and Air Force ROTC
will be considered at a later time.
According to a letter from
Pitzer to the Senate, "The Air
Force and the Navy have
indicated that they would
generally consider the fate of this
proposal as setting a broad
precedent for their own
approaches to contract revision.
Na\y Action lii Future
Provided the Army's proposal is
approved, Col. Thomas would
recommend that the Navy
continue Navy ROTC at Stanford
and said, "I would think there
would be a good possibility they
would continue."
Pitzer said "The question of
granting limited academic credit is
the crux of the matter. . ." Some
faculty members and students
have argued that any credit to
ROTC courses is a reversal of the
Senate's decision.
In April of 1969, the faculty
upheld by a vote of 403-356 the
decision of the faculty Senate to
end academic credit for military
training. In February, the students
approved 2,106 lo 1,397 the
resolution declaring "ROTC has a
legitimate place on campus and
deserves support and credit from
the University for all those parts
of the program that are of genuine
academic inderest."
Trustees Pressure Pitzer
A month later, the Board of
Trustees called ROTC "vital to
the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military
service" and urged Pitzer to
continue negotiations with the
Defense Department "leading to
appropriate actions which will
improve and vitalize this
important program."
Besides denying credit, the
Senate also removed departmental
status of ROTC effective 1973
removed faculty status from the
ROTC instructors also beginning
1973, and recommended revising
contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces to
remove certain punitive clauses
and to reflect actual practice.
The Center for Military Studies,
with a senior military officer
serving as its director, would be an
"integral element in the structure
of this institution," the new
report claims, and would answer
to the Provost's Office.
Officers Given Professor's Rights
The report recommended that
the title of "Director of the
Center of Military Studies" be
given to the senior officer. Other
officers would be called Associate
or Assistant Directors, and will
receive "those full rights and
privileges normally accorded
Professors of the University,
except tenure and membership on
the- Academic Council."
Pitzer said the status of the
military officers would "be the
same as that of temporary

menbers of the University Staff,
which currently includes about
1,750 persons in addition to the
faculty. He called the position of
the officers analogous to that of
members of United Campus
Ministry, who perform various
campus services while basically
employed by outside institutions
and who from time to time give
undergraduate special courses for
credit.
The committee voted on three
alternative recommendations for
the President. The first is the one
that has been outlined "subject to
obtaining the advice and consent
of the faculty Senate on the
proposal for the granting of
academic credit on a
course-by-course basis. . The
decision to submit this question
to the Senate was recommended
because of disagreement within
the committee about whether this
credit would violate the Senate's
prior decision.

The issue of credit for ROTC
courses will probably determine
the future of ROTC at Stanford.
Prof. Manne said that his
committee found "no statutory
requirement that ROTC must
receive academic credit." Sources
have indicated that part of the
insistence on some type of credit
for Army ROTC arises because
influential members of Confess
have informally told the Army
not to back down to the
universities on this issue.
The Navy insists on credit for
its courses. Colonel Thomas said,
"If a mechanism for granting
credit is set up, my
recommendation would be to
continue ROTC and to see how it
works. If such a mechanism is not
adopted as part of the framework
for continuing ROTC, I do not
believe the Navy would continue
ROTC." Thus, the Senate vote on
this issue takes on a larger
significance.

would be a good possibility they
would continue."
Pitzer said "The question of
granting limited academic credit is
the crux of the matter. . ." Some
faculty members and students
have argued that any credit to
ROTC courses is a reversal of the
Senate's decision.
In April of 1969, the faculty
upheld by a vote of 403-356 the
decision of the faculty Senate to
end academic credit for military
training. In February, the students
approved 2,106 lo 1,397 the
resolution declaring "ROTC has a
legitimate place on campus and
deserves support and credit from
the University for all those parts
of the program that are of genuine
academic inderest."
Trustees Pressure Pitzer
A month later, the Board of
Trustees called ROTC "vital to
the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military
service" and urged Pitzer to
continue negotiations with the
Defense Department "leading to
appropriate actions which will
improve and vitalize this
important program."
Besides denying credit, the
Senate also removed departmental
status of ROTC effective 1973
removed faculty status from the
ROTC instructors also beginning
1973, and recommended revising
contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces to
remove certain punitive clauses
and to reflect actual practice.
The Center for Military Studies,
with a senior military officer
serving as its director, would be an
"integral element in the structure
of this institution," the new
report claims, and would answer
to the Provost's Office.
Officers Given Professor's Rights
The report recommended that
the title of "Director of the
Center of Military Studies" be
given to the senior officer. Other
officers would be called Associate
or Assistant Directors, and will
receive "those full rights and
privileges normally accorded
Professors of the University,
except tenure and membership on
the- Academic Council."
Pitzer said the status of the
military officers would "be the
same as that of temporary

menbers of the University Staff,
which currently includes about
1,750 persons in addition to the
faculty. He called the position of
the officers analogous to that of
members of United Campus
Ministry, who perform various
campus services while basically
employed by outside institutions
and who from time to time give
undergraduate special courses for
credit.
The committee voted on three
alternative recommendations for
the President. The first is the one
that has been outlined "subject to
obtaining the advice and consent
of the faculty Senate on the
proposal for the granting of
academic credit on a
course-by-course basis. . The
decision to submit this question
to the Senate was recommended
because of disagreement within
the committee about whether this
credit would violate the Senate's
prior decision.

The issue of credit for ROTC
courses will probably determine
the future of ROTC at Stanford.
Prof. Manne said that his
committee found "no statutory
requirement that ROTC must
receive academic credit." Sources
have indicated that part of the
insistence on some type of credit
for Army ROTC arises because
influential members of Confess
have informally told the Army
not to back down to the
universities on this issue.
The Navy insists on credit for
its courses. Colonel Thomas said,
"If a mechanism for granting
credit is set up, my
recommendation would be to
continue ROTC and to see how it
works. If such a mechanism is not
adopted as part of the framework
for continuing ROTC, I do not
believe the Navy would continue
ROTC." Thus, the Senate vote on
this issue takes on a larger
significance.

Limited academic credit will be
allowed Army Reserve Officer's
Training Corps (ROTC) courses
according to a recommendation
from President Kenneth Pitzer.
Pitzer released a student-faculty
report yesterday recommending
that Army ROTC courses be
reviewed "in accordance with
normal University procedures and
granted appropriate academic
credit for those courses which
meet established University
standards." There would be no
automatic or blanket credit—each
course would be submitted to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies for approval.
The report also recommended
abolishing departmental status for
ROTC and replacing it with a
Center For Military Studies. In
addition it suggests changing the
title of the Professor of Military
Science to "Director" with all
faculty privileges except that of
membership in the Academic
Council.
The faculty Senate will
consider the report at its regular
meeting Thursday. Pitzer
"strongly" urged favorable action
by the Senate, which is required
for credit to be given.
Previous Senate Decision
Last spring the faculty Senate
decided that "after a transitional
period, there should be no
academic credit received for
participation in programs of
military training and education."
This is set to take effect with the
freshman class next fall. The
Senate's action followed a
faculty-student committee
in-depth study of the position of
ROTC at Stanford.
The President's Advisory
Committee on ROTC affairs was
appointed last spring to work out
details for the "revision or
termination of the contracts
between Stanford and the armed
forces. . ." in line with the
decisions of the faculty Senate.
Colonel Stanley Ramey,
professor of military science, said
that Army ROTC will request six
to nine units of credit from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which has the power to
grant academic credit for
non-departmental programs.
Army ROTC students may now
take up to 27 of the 180 course
units required for graduation from
military teachers.
24 Unit Minimum Asked
Colonel Robert Thomas,
professor of naval science, said,
"A minimum of 24 units would
be the smallest number submitted
for credit (by Navy ROTC).
A minority of the eight
member committee dissented.
Alan Manne, professor in the
graduate school of business, and
Lyman P. Van Slyke, professor of
history and a member of the
student-faculty study of ROTC
last year, said, "Stanford is being
asked to adopt the DOD's
(Department of Defense) position,
and thereby to reverse last spring's
faculty decision."
Faculty Action Termed Decisive
Calling the faculty action of
last spring "a sound one and long
overdue", Manne and Van Slvke

said, "In the matter of academic
credit, we believe that faculty
views ought to be decisive, and
that the faculty has already
expressed its views
unambiguously."
This report deals only with the
Army ROTC and is based on a
proposal of Col. Ramey from the
Army. Navy and Air Force ROTC
will be considered at a later time.
According to a letter from
Pitzer to the Senate, "The Air
Force and the Navy have
indicated that they would
generally consider the fate of this
proposal as setting a broad
precedent for their own
approaches to contract revision.
Na\y Action lii Future
Provided the Army's proposal is
approved, Col. Thomas would
recommend that the Navy
continue Navy ROTC at Stanford

would be a good possibility they
would continue."

believe the Navy would continue
ROTC." Thus, the Senate vote on
this issue takes on a larger
significance.

Limited academic credit will be
allowed Army Reserve Officer's
Training Corps (ROTC) courses
according to a recommendation
from President Kenneth Pitzer.
Pitzer released a student-faculty
report yesterday recommending
that Army ROTC courses be
reviewed "in accordance with
normal University procedures and
granted appropriate academic
credit for those courses which
meet established University
standards." There would be no
automatic or blanket credit—each
course would be submitted to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies for approval.
The report also recommended
abolishing departmental status for
ROTC and replacing it with a
Center For Military Studies. In
addition it suggests changing the
title of the Professor of Military
Science to "Director" with all
faculty privileges except that of
membership in the Academic
Council.
The faculty Senate will
consider the report at its regular
meeting Thursday. Pitzer
"strongly" urged favorable action
by the Senate, which is required
for credit to be given.
Previous Senate Decision
Last spring the faculty Senate
decided that "after a transitional
period, there should be no
academic credit received for
participation in programs of
military training and education."
This is set to take effect with the
freshman class next fall. The
Senate's action followed a
faculty-student committee
in-depth study of the position of
ROTC at Stanford.
The President's Advisory
Committee on ROTC affairs was
appointed last spring to work out
details for the "revision or
termination of the contracts
between Stanford and the armed
forces. . ." in line with the
decisions of the faculty Senate.
Colonel Stanley Ramey,
professor of military science, said
that Army ROTC will request six
to nine units of credit from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which has the power to
grant academic credit for
non-departmental programs.
Army ROTC students may now
take up to 27 of the 180 course
units required for graduation from
military teachers.
24 Unit Minimum Asked
Colonel Robert Thomas,
professor of naval science, said,
"A minimum of 24 units would
be the smallest number submitted
for credit (by Navy ROTC).
A minority of the eight
member committee dissented.
Alan Manne, professor in the
graduate school of business, and
Lyman P. Van Slyke, professor of
history and a member of the
student-faculty study of ROTC
last year, said, "Stanford is being
asked to adopt the DOD's
(Department of Defense) position,
and thereby to reverse last spring's
faculty decision."
Faculty Action Termed Decisive
Calling the faculty action of
last spring "a sound one and long
overdue", Manne and Van Slvke

said, "In the matter of academic
credit, we believe that faculty
views ought to be decisive, and
that the faculty has already
expressed its views
unambiguously."
This report deals only with the
Army ROTC and is based on a
proposal of Col. Ramey from the
Army. Navy and Air Force ROTC
will be considered at a later time.
According to a letter from
Pitzer to the Senate, "The Air
Force and the Navy have
indicated that they would
generally consider the fate of this
proposal as setting a broad
precedent for their own
approaches to contract revision.
Na\y Action lii Future
Provided the Army's proposal is
approved, Col. Thomas would
recommend that the Navy
continue Navy ROTC at Stanford
and said, "I would think there
would be a good possibility they
would continue."
Pitzer said "The question of
granting limited academic credit is
the crux of the matter. . ." Some
faculty members and students
have argued that any credit to
ROTC courses is a reversal of the
Senate's decision.
In April of 1969, the faculty
upheld by a vote of 403-356 the
decision of the faculty Senate to
end academic credit for military
training. In February, the students
approved 2,106 lo 1,397 the
resolution declaring "ROTC has a
legitimate place on campus and
deserves support and credit from
the University for all those parts
of the program that are of genuine
academic inderest."
Trustees Pressure Pitzer
A month later, the Board of
Trustees called ROTC "vital to
the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military
service" and urged Pitzer to
continue negotiations with the
Defense Department "leading to
appropriate actions which will
improve and vitalize this
important program."
Besides denying credit, the
Senate also removed departmental
status of ROTC effective 1973
removed faculty status from the
ROTC instructors also beginning
1973, and recommended revising
contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces to
remove certain punitive clauses
and to reflect actual practice.
The Center for Military Studies,
with a senior military officer
serving as its director, would be an
"integral element in the structure
of this institution," the new
report claims, and would answer
to the Provost's Office.
Officers Given Professor's Rights
The report recommended that
the title of "Director of the
Center of Military Studies" be
given to the senior officer. Other
officers would be called Associate
or Assistant Directors, and will
receive "those full rights and
privileges normally accorded
Professors of the University,
except tenure and membership on
the- Academic Council."
Pitzer said the status of the
military officers would "be the
same as that of temporary

menbers of the University Staff,
which currently includes about
1,750 persons in addition to the
faculty. He called the position of
the officers analogous to that of
members of United Campus
Ministry, who perform various
campus services while basically
employed by outside institutions
and who from time to time give
undergraduate special courses for
credit.
The committee voted on three
alternative recommendations for
the President. The first is the one
that has been outlined "subject to
obtaining the advice and consent
of the faculty Senate on the
proposal for the granting of
academic credit on a
course-by-course basis. . The
decision to submit this question
to the Senate was recommended
because of disagreement within
the committee about whether this
credit would violate the Senate's
prior decision.

The issue of credit for ROTC
courses will probably determine
the future of ROTC at Stanford.
Prof. Manne said that his
committee found "no statutory
requirement that ROTC must
receive academic credit." Sources
have indicated that part of the
insistence on some type of credit
for Army ROTC arises because
influential members of Confess
have informally told the Army
not to back down to the
universities on this issue.
The Navy insists on credit for
its courses. Colonel Thomas said,
"If a mechanism for granting
credit is set up, my
recommendation would be to
continue ROTC and to see how it
works. If such a mechanism is not
adopted as part of the framework
for continuing ROTC, I do not
believe the Navy would continue
ROTC." Thus, the Senate vote on

recommend that the Navy
continue Navy ROTC at Stanford
and said, "I would think there
would be a good possibility they
would continue."
Pitzer said "The question of
granting limited academic credit is
the crux of the matter. . ." Some
faculty members and students
have argued that any credit to
ROTC courses is a reversal of the
Senate's decision.
In April of 1969, the faculty
upheld by a vote of 403-356 the
decision of the faculty Senate to
end academic credit for military
training. In February, the students
approved 2,106 lo 1,397 the
resolution declaring "ROTC has a
legitimate place on campus and
deserves support and credit from
the University for all those parts
of the program that are of genuine
academic inderest."
Trustees Pressure Pitzer
A month later, the Board of
Trustees called ROTC "vital to
the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military
service" and urged Pitzer to
continue negotiations with the
Defense Department "leading to
appropriate actions which will
improve and vitalize this
important program."
Besides denying credit, the
Senate also removed departmental
status of ROTC effective 1973
removed faculty status from the
ROTC instructors also beginning
1973, and recommended revising
contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces to
remove certain punitive clauses
and to reflect actual practice.
The Center for Military Studies,
with a senior military officer
serving as its director, would be an
"integral element in the structure
of this institution," the new
report claims, and would answer
to the Provost's Office.
Officers Given Professor's Rights
The report recommended that
the title of "Director of the
Center of Military Studies" be
given to the senior officer. Other
officers would be called Associate
or Assistant Directors, and will
receive "those full rights and
privileges normally accorded
Professors of the University,
except tenure and membership on
the- Academic Council."
Pitzer said the status of the
military officers would "be the
same as that of temporary

menbers of the University Staff,
which currently includes about
1,750 persons in addition to the
faculty. He called the position of
the officers analogous to that of
members of United Campus
Ministry, who perform various
campus services while basically
employed by outside institutions
and who from time to time give
undergraduate special courses for
credit.
The committee voted on three
alternative recommendations for
the President. The first is the one
that has been outlined "subject to
obtaining the advice and consent
of the faculty Senate on the
proposal for the granting of
academic credit on a
course-by-course basis. . The
decision to submit this question
to the Senate was recommended
because of disagreement within
the committee about whether this
credit would violate the Senate's
prior decision.

The issue of credit for ROTC
courses will probably determine
the future of ROTC at Stanford.
Prof. Manne said that his
committee found "no statutory
requirement that ROTC must
receive academic credit." Sources
have indicated that part of the
insistence on some type of credit
for Army ROTC arises because
influential members of Confess
have informally told the Army
not to back down to the
universities on this issue.
The Navy insists on credit for
its courses. Colonel Thomas said,
"If a mechanism for granting
credit is set up, my
recommendation would be to
continue ROTC and to see how it
works. If such a mechanism is not
adopted as part of the framework
for continuing ROTC, I do not
believe the Navy would continue
ROTC." Thus, the Senate vote on
this issue takes on a larger
significance.
