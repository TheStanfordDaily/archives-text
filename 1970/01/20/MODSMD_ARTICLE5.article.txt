# No Restrictions On SRI War Research
## 
### NICK NICHOLAS 
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) bought its independence
with no University strings
attached to control its research
activities, Trustee President W.
Parmer Fuller said yesterday.
But SRI officials insist that
restrictions imposed last spring on
biological warfare research remain
"pretty much effective" under an
independant board of directors.
"No guidelines either expressed
or implied governing the kind of
research SRI could undertake
were either expressed or implied"
Fuller said.
Government-military research is
declining at SRI though more in
response to national trends than
to local pressure, according to
Leroy V. Goodman, director of
communications and relations.
"Most of our present military
research is under contracts
awarded before the controversy,"
Goodman added. "Now, we're
looking more and more to the
private business sector for
contracts."
Final Terms
Last spring's demonstrations
against war-related research
precipitated a trustee decision on
May 13 to sever SRI-University
ties. Terms of the final agreement
reached last week call for $25
million in payments to the
University at the rate of one per
cent of yearly gross operating
revenues. SRl's 1969 total of $58
million would yield $580,000 a
year, with increases due to SRl's
anticipated growth.
University officials have not
earmarked the funds for any
specific purpose, but the
additional income will be sorely
needed to offset current operating
deficits.
Although SRI has an advisory
group of research staff members,
the leader of this group expects

no internal changes bringing direct
staff participation in
policy-making. Dr. Felix Smith,
president of the Institute
Advisory group thinks that
primary power will continue to
rest with the Board of Directors.
He expects a continuation of the
trend toward non-military
research.
SR.I Reputation
Loss of "Stanford" in the SRI
name, another term of the
agreement effective in five years,
will have little effect on business,
officials assert.
"We've built up a reputation
not so much from our University
ties as from the continued quality
of research," Goodman believes.
Trustee Fuller is equally
confident. "SRI has its own fine
personnel and can go it alone
without any difficulty," he says.
Members of the April 3rd
Movement feel the separation
agreement circumvents their
demands by selling a deceptive
solution.
"Separation compounds the
problem, "says Barbara Hyland,
"because CBW research continues
without any restrictions. It's just
the same thing cloaked in
misleading language."
Miss Hyland believes that SRI
should have been brought under
more direct University control
through a "control board
composed of both students and
faculty."
ASSU Resolution
Student Senate member Yale
Braunstein believes that trustees
did "exactly what they intended
to do all along."
ASSU Senate members
Thursday passed a resolution
condemning the trustees action as
one motivated by "economic
self-interest ignoring the wishes of
their constituents." The motion,
authored by vice-chairman John
Shoch, won by a 14-10 margin.

research is under contracts
awarded before the controversy,"
Goodman added. "Now, we're
looking more and more to the
private business sector for
contracts."
Final Terms
Last spring's demonstrations
against war-related research
precipitated a trustee decision on
May 13 to sever SRI-University
ties. Terms of the final agreement
reached last week call for $25
million in payments to the
University at the rate of one per
cent of yearly gross operating
revenues. SRl's 1969 total of $58
million would yield $580,000 a
year, with increases due to SRl's
anticipated growth.
University officials have not
earmarked the funds for any
specific purpose, but the
additional income will be sorely
needed to offset current operating
deficits.
Although SRI has an advisory
group of research staff members,
the leader of this group expects

no internal changes bringing direct
staff participation in
policy-making. Dr. Felix Smith,
president of the Institute
Advisory group thinks that
primary power will continue to
rest with the Board of Directors.
He expects a continuation of the
trend toward non-military
research.
SR.I Reputation
Loss of "Stanford" in the SRI
name, another term of the
agreement effective in five years,
will have little effect on business,
officials assert.
"We've built up a reputation
not so much from our University
ties as from the continued quality
of research," Goodman believes.
Trustee Fuller is equally
confident. "SRI has its own fine
personnel and can go it alone
without any difficulty," he says.
Members of the April 3rd
Movement feel the separation
agreement circumvents their
demands by selling a deceptive
solution.
"Separation compounds the
problem, "says Barbara Hyland,
"because CBW research continues
without any restrictions. It's just
the same thing cloaked in
misleading language."
Miss Hyland believes that SRI
should have been brought under
more direct University control
through a "control board
composed of both students and
faculty."
ASSU Resolution
Student Senate member Yale
Braunstein believes that trustees
did "exactly what they intended
to do all along."
ASSU Senate members
Thursday passed a resolution
condemning the trustees action as
one motivated by "economic
self-interest ignoring the wishes of
their constituents." The motion,
authored by vice-chairman John
Shoch, won by a 14-10 margin.
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) bought its independence
with no University strings
attached to control its research
activities, Trustee President W.
Parmer Fuller said yesterday.
But SRI officials insist that
restrictions imposed last spring on
biological warfare research remain
"pretty much effective" under an
independant board of directors.
"No guidelines either expressed
or implied governing the kind of
research SRI could undertake
were either expressed or implied"
Fuller said.
Government-military research is
declining at SRI though more in
response to national trends than
to local pressure, according to
Leroy V. Goodman, director of
communications and relations.
"Most of our present military
research is under contracts
awarded before the controversy,"
Goodman added. "Now, we're
looking more and more to the
private business sector for
contracts."
