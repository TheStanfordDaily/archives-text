"Lither the birth rate is going to go down or the death
rate is going to go up in the next twenty years. The
people like the Pope are working for more wars or
famines. "—Dr. Paul Erhlieh.

"This guy Erhlich has to be read to be believed, hi his
way he's worse than Hitler. . . These are the views oj a
zealot, not of a rational man ... Charles MeCabe it] the
San Francisco Chronicle, Jan. 19, 1970.

Stanford population biologist
Pai'l Ehrlich is a self-assured
pessimist with a mission. He
thinks the world is sitting on a
population bomb, he is sure he is
right, and he wants everyone to
know about the danger.
So with the zeal of a missionary
and the manner of Ralph Nader,
the 37 year old biologist teaches,
travels and speaks in hope of
creating a greater awareness of
population pressures.
With an inner nervous energy
barely hidden beneath an outer
calm, Ehrlich floods his audiences
with shocking facts and figures,
and projects equally shocking
solutions.
Because of this unflinchingly
bleak presentation, the news
media has comfortably branded
him one of the neo-Malthusian
"doomsday scientists."
Labels Minor
Still, the short-haired professor
claims these labels are of only
minor irritation. "To the people
who are optimistic at this stage of
the game," he comments, "I can
only say, if you can keep your
head while the others are losing
theirs, then that is so much the
better for you."
But when contacted yesterday
about San Francisco Chroniclr
columnist Charles McCabe's
"Spectator" column in which he
was referred to as a "zealot" who

is "In his way . . . worse than
Hitler," Ehrlich seemed more than
mildly disturbed.
"I think McCabe sizes it up
hirrself," he said. "He clearly
indicates he is for killing people
over 60 rather than controlling
the population. It is too bad that
a man who is presumably literate
cannot make sense of himself.
Not Mandatory
"I want to emphasize," he
continued, "that I have never
favored mandatory birth control.
But we must realize that the
choice is between birth control
and a much greater death rate."
Ehrlich's mention of "killing
people over 60" referred to a
paragraph in the McCabe column
that reads, "Killing people when
they are 60 is perhaps better than
preventing their birth. Decimating
doctors every year or so is perhaps
better than preventing the birth of
children. I frankly don't know."
Cast in this light the Ehrlich reply
obviously'seems exaggerated.
But it is difficult to determine
whether this kind of
overstatement is an Ehrlich
characteristic, or rather the
product of a split-second
emotional response. It is not
uncommon, however, for him to
blast out a rapid-fire sentence, and
then qualify it slightly after a few
moments recollection.
Nevertheless what he is saying
is more important than how he is

saying it—and it is what he is
saying that frightens people.
Khrlich Discusses Solutions
Relaxing in the living-room of
their home at the base of the
Stanford foothills a few weeks
ago, Ehrlich discussed recent
developments in population
biology and explained his
recommendations for solutions.
As he pointed toward the inner
court of his Spanish-style home,
he lamented the deterioration of
the environment in the San
Francisco Bay area.
"When I came here 10 years
ago," he said, "you could see
Mount Hamilton in the coastal
range almost every day. Now I
can't even remember the last time
I saw it."
But the tall, slim biologist had
some reason for optimism. The
week before, Johnny Carson had
displayed Ehrlich and his theories
for a full hour before his
late-nigh { viewers who are
accustomed only to 10 to 20
minute slots.
Enrouraped by Carson
"Did you see the Tonight Show
last week?" he reflected. "I was
rather encouraged by the full hour
Carson accorded me. I think it is
an indication of a growing
awareness of the environmental
problem,"
steadfastly maintains
that to most of the people in the
United States the awareness of
ecological dangers is nothing new.

PAI'L KIIHLICII: "It you're booking
passage on the Titanic, there\ no use
going steerage."
"It's taken time for the media ana
the politicians to catch up with
this." hr contends.
Time magazine coverage of
environmental problems is a
typical example of how the media
has functioned in the past, he says
flipping through old clippings. "It
has just been awful.
"They have quoted all kinds of
optimistic predictions about the
abundance and the
over-abundance of food; but there
isn't a well-trained population

biologist that would agree with
them. The most optimistic hope
to maintain the present
inadequate levels of world-wide
nutrition only for 10 to 20 more
years. They all admit that the
'Green revolution' will fade away
by then."
Solu lions K evolutionary
For Ehrlich, the facts of
population growth and food
availablility are hard and the
solutions revolutionary.
"Despite the bullshit in
magazines like Time, we are not
properly feeding and clothing over
half of the three and one-half
billion people we have now. I
can't even talk about the
optimistic estimate of feeding
seven billion by the end of this
decade until we can handle the
present situation.
"Today, 10 to 20 million
people die each year of starvation
or diseases that starvation causes.
And fully one-half of the
population suffers from
malnutrition.
"The hard facts are." he
continues, "that as a friend of
mine says, the world is a whole
system of slums with a few islands
of affluence. Studies show that
the world can only support one
billion people at the U.S. standard
of living. At the present rate of
doubling time of the population,
there should bo seven billion
people in the world by the year
2000.

But no one thinks there will be.
There can only be death, war,
pestilence or famine to reduce the
number if there aren't drastic
efforts at population control."
Analysis in Hook
Ehrlich's analysis of the
population problem was first put
in book form three years ago in
"The Population Bomb." Now, he
and his wife, are expanding on his
earlier efforts in a new and longer
volume, Population Resources and
Knviron men t.
A large part of this work is
devoted to the Ehrlichs' solutions
to the problem. They recommend
a four-point program.
Limit population to two
children per couple,
Initiate "New Politics" grass
roots political movements to
influence the federal government.
De-develop the United States
and help initiate a limited
development of underdeveloped
countries.
Engage in "positive political
action" rather than "negative
protest."
The Ehrlichs put most emphasis
on the need for a reduced
population and an effort at
de-developing the United States
and other advanced countries.
Americans Huge Burden
To Americans, surprised that
they need to restrict the number
of their own children, he replies,
"Each American child is 50 times
the burden on the world

environmental situation than each
Indian child is because of the
automobiles he drives, etc. And
when he becomes a consumer, his
burden is several hundred times as
great."
Most in his audiences are also
perturbed by his call for
de-development of the U.S. But
he says, "We need to stop this
cowboy economy that is only
directed at increasing the amount
rather than the quality of things.
"The effects on the world of
this economy are horrible. Some
people have a good deal of trouble
explaining our war in Vietnam
and our recent switch of policy in
the Middle East. But I think it is
rather obvious.
"We need the resources from
southeast Asia to fuel our
economy, and Rockefeller and the
boys need the oil from the Arab
countries in the Middle East. It all
adds up to a world-wide looting
ring."
There is no hesitation about
Paul Ehrlich. He sees a potentially
disastrous problem and thinks he
has some of the solutions to it.
How sure is he that his predictions
will come true?
"Let me put it this way," he
says. "Imagine you are shooting at
a computer with a gun. It is only a
matter of time before it will stop.
The same may be said of the
population problem. It is only a
matter of time until population
growth becomes uncontrollable."
