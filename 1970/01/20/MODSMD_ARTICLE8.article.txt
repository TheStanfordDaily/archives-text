# Road to Rearmament?
## Why Japanese Riot 
### Jim Shoch 
On November 16, near Tokyo's
Haneda airport, thousands of
young students and workers
battled riot police for hours with
staves, tear gas, and molotov
cocktails. The demonstrators'
goal: to keep Japanese Prime
Minister Eisaku Sato from leaving
for Washington to finish
negotiating the "reversion" of
Okinawa to Japan.
Why did these militant Leftists
risk injury and arrest to keep their
Prime Minister from leaving the
country? The answer to this
question is complicated but
important.
Since the Ryukyu Islands were
taken from Japan after World War
11, the US has turned Okinawa,
the largest of the islands into a
veritable arsenal; 45,000
servicemen are stationed at the
117 bases scattered across the
island.
Launching Pad lor US
Okinawa has been the primary
staging ground for the US war
effort in Vietnam. US Army
troops are transported and
supplied from Okinawa. Navy
vessels engaged in the conflict use
Okinawa as a supply and repair
base. Most importantly, Okinawa
is home base for the giant B-52's
that each day hit targets in
Vietnam and Laos.
Japan itself aids the US war
effort in a similar war. Under the
terms of the Treaty of Mutual
Security and Cooperation (or

Ampo, as the Japanese call it), the
US maintains 138 military
installations in Japan. These bases
have also served as staging grounds
for the Vietnam conflict.
Escape Clause
At their November meeting
Sato and President Nixon agreed
to the reversion of Okinawa by
1972. An escape clause in the
agreement provides that after
1972, the US might keep nuclear
weapons on the island and
continue to use the bases there in
an unrestricted manner to aid the
war effort if both Japan and the
US agree to such an arrangement
at that time. Japan will
undoubtedly accede to US
pressure for such agreement when
the time comes.
In addition to the return of
Okinawa, Sato and Nixon agreed
to the continuation of the
Security Treaty, due for
"automatic extension" next June
23. Japan, then, will continue to
aid the US intervention in
Vietnam.
Eliminate US Bases
The Haneda airport battle,
along with others in Japan during
the five days from November 13
to 17, was part of a long-term
strategy designed to end the
Security Treaty and to eliminate
all US bases on Okinawa and in
Japan—a strategy whose ultimate
goal is the disengagement of Japan
from America's imperialist Asian
policy and the replacement of
expansionist Japanese capitalism
with democratic socialism.
But who were these courageous
street fighters, 2,000 of whom
were arrested in their great
attempt to keep Sato from leaving
for Washington? For the answer,
we must jump back to the end of
World War 11.
The Zengakuren (All Japan
Students' League) was formed
soon after the war. Under the
influence of the Japan Communist
Party (JCP), the Zengakuren
adopted in the immediate
post-war period the goal of
peaceful revolution; shifted to an
advocacy of armed struggle during
the Korean War; and swung back
again, along with the JCP, to
promoting peaceful revolution.
University Strikes
In 1958, the Zengakuren split
with the JCP and moved further
left, using such tactics as
university strikes and large
demonstrations—tactics opposed
by the JCP.
During the early 1960'5, after
the Security Treaty had been
signed, the Zengakuren was
relatively quiet. However, during
these years, its belief in struggle
was significantly strengthened.
When Sato tried to leave
Haneda airport on October 8,
1967, for an earlier meeting on
Okinawa with President Johnson,
members of the Zengakuren
battled the riot police with
wooden staves and metal pipes,
called hebabo (literally, "violence
staves").
Several demonstrations were
held in 1968, including one early
in the year to oppose the docking
of the nuclear-powered American
aircraft carrier Enterprise.
/enkyoto Emergen
In January, 1968, a strike

began in the Medical Faculty at
the University of Tokyo, the most
prestigious and influential
university in the country. The
strike centered around low pay
and miserable working conditions.
When the riot police were called
to break down the barricades in
front of the Medical School, the
conflict expanded. Demands for
self-government were promulgated
and a new intra-university
organization was formed called
the Zenkyoto (Students'
Conference for All-University
Struggle). The organization
included elements from all the
factions of the student Left
(except Minsei, the pro-JCP
faction) and non-sect radicals.
(The Japanese Left is even more
sect-ridden than our own. The
Zenkyoto has actually fought
battles with the Minsei and
Kakumaru, another of the sects.)
During the Tokyo University
strike, the Zenkyoto formed
valuable ties with the workers'
union called Sohyo, the largest
and most influential union in
Japan.
SRI Nozzle?
In January, 1969, after two
days of fighting, the riot police
retook the barricaded
administration building using tear
gas dropped from helicopters. (It
seems Governor Reagan keeps up
on events in Japan. Could SRI
have designed the nozzle?) This
led to an extension of the struggle
to universities throughout Japan.)
In April, 1969, students from
Zenkyoto factions participated in
Okinawa demonstrations. This
was the first time the new
Zenkyoto joined in open activity
with other leftist groups; mainly
Hansen (the workers' anti-war
movement), and Beheiren
(Citizens' Union for Peace in
Vietnam).
This led on September 15,
1969, to the formation of the
All-Japan Zenkyoto including all
old factions of Zengakuren,
except Minsei and Kakumaru.
This group sponsored
International Anti-War Day on
October 21. During this single day
7 00,000 Japanese citizens
participated in 832 rallies.
Street-fighting occurred in several
cities. It was this same Zenkyoto
that led the fighting at the time of
Sato's departure in November.
The several thousand arrests
made during the battle of the
sixteenth and in the massive
police dragnets preceeding it have
seriously weakened the Zenkyoto.
The organization has much
regrouping to do before next
summer when the Security Treaty
is due who will play the most
important role in delaying and
perhaps stopping this
remilitarization.

Hatano, student at the
University of Tokyo and member
of the Zenkyoto, will be on
campus this Wednesday. He will
be showing a film of the Sato
demrthst rations in Tokyo and
discussing the politics of the
student left in Japan. 7:30 in
Bishop Auditorium.

again, along with the JCP, to
promoting peaceful revolution.
University Strikes
In 1958, the Zengakuren split
with the JCP and moved further
left, using such tactics as
university strikes and large
demonstrations—tactics opposed
by the JCP.
During the early 1960'5, after
the Security Treaty had been
signed, the Zengakuren was
relatively quiet. However, during
these years, its belief in struggle
was significantly strengthened.
When Sato tried to leave
Haneda airport on October 8,
1967, for an earlier meeting on
Okinawa with President Johnson,
members of the Zengakuren
battled the riot police with
wooden staves and metal pipes,
called hebabo (literally, "violence
staves").
Several demonstrations were
held in 1968, including one early
in the year to oppose the docking
of the nuclear-powered American
aircraft carrier Enterprise.
/enkyoto Emergen
In January, 1968, a strike

began in the Medical Faculty at
the University of Tokyo, the most
prestigious and influential
university in the country. The
strike centered around low pay
and miserable working conditions.
When the riot police were called
to break down the barricades in
front of the Medical School, the
conflict expanded. Demands for
self-government were promulgated
and a new intra-university
organization was formed called
the Zenkyoto (Students'
Conference for All-University
Struggle). The organization
included elements from all the
factions of the student Left
(except Minsei, the pro-JCP
faction) and non-sect radicals.
(The Japanese Left is even more
sect-ridden than our own. The
Zenkyoto has actually fought
battles with the Minsei and
Kakumaru, another of the sects.)
During the Tokyo University
strike, the Zenkyoto formed
valuable ties with the workers'
union called Sohyo, the largest
and most influential union in
Japan.
SRI Nozzle?
In January, 1969, after two
days of fighting, the riot police
retook the barricaded
administration building using tear
gas dropped from helicopters. (It
seems Governor Reagan keeps up
on events in Japan. Could SRI
have designed the nozzle?) This
led to an extension of the struggle
to universities throughout Japan.)
In April, 1969, students from
Zenkyoto factions participated in
Okinawa demonstrations. This
was the first time the new
Zenkyoto joined in open activity
with other leftist groups; mainly
Hansen (the workers' anti-war
movement), and Beheiren
(Citizens' Union for Peace in
Vietnam).
This led on September 15,
1969, to the formation of the
All-Japan Zenkyoto including all
old factions of Zengakuren,
except Minsei and Kakumaru.
This group sponsored
International Anti-War Day on
October 21. During this single day
7 00,000 Japanese citizens
participated in 832 rallies.
Street-fighting occurred in several
cities. It was this same Zenkyoto
that led the fighting at the time of
Sato's departure in November.
The several thousand arrests
made during the battle of the
sixteenth and in the massive
police dragnets preceeding it have
seriously weakened the Zenkyoto.
The organization has much
regrouping to do before next
summer when the Security Treaty
is due who will play the most
important role in delaying and
perhaps stopping this
remilitarization.

On November 16, near Tokyo's
Haneda airport, thousands of
young students and workers
battled riot police for hours with
staves, tear gas, and molotov
cocktails. The demonstrators'
goal: to keep Japanese Prime
Minister Eisaku Sato from leaving
for Washington to finish
negotiating the "reversion" of
Okinawa to Japan.
Why did these militant Leftists
risk injury and arrest to keep their
Prime Minister from leaving the
country? The answer to this
question is complicated but
important.
Since the Ryukyu Islands were
taken from Japan after World War
11, the US has turned Okinawa,
the largest of the islands into a
veritable arsenal; 45,000
servicemen are stationed at the
117 bases scattered across the
island.
Launching Pad lor US
Okinawa has been the primary
staging ground for the US war
effort in Vietnam. US Army
troops are transported and
supplied from Okinawa. Navy
vessels engaged in the conflict use
Okinawa as a supply and repair
base. Most importantly, Okinawa
is home base for the giant B-52's
that each day hit targets in
Vietnam and Laos.
Japan itself aids the US war
effort in a similar war. Under the
terms of the Treaty of Mutual
Security and Cooperation (or

Ampo, as the Japanese call it), the
US maintains 138 military
installations in Japan. These bases
have also served as staging grounds
for the Vietnam conflict.
Escape Clause
At their November meeting
Sato and President Nixon agreed
to the reversion of Okinawa by
1972. An escape clause in the
agreement provides that after
1972, the US might keep nuclear
weapons on the island and
continue to use the bases there in
an unrestricted manner to aid the
war effort if both Japan and the
US agree to such an arrangement
at that time. Japan will
undoubtedly accede to US
pressure for such agreement when
the time comes.
In addition to the return of
Okinawa, Sato and Nixon agreed
to the continuation of the
Security Treaty, due for
"automatic extension" next June
23. Japan, then, will continue to
aid the US intervention in
Vietnam.
Eliminate US Bases
The Haneda airport battle,
along with others in Japan during
the five days from November 13
to 17, was part of a long-term
strategy designed to end the
Security Treaty and to eliminate
all US bases on Okinawa and in
Japan—a strategy whose ultimate
goal is the disengagement of Japan
from America's imperialist Asian
policy and the replacement of
expansionist Japanese capitalism
with democratic socialism.
But who were these courageous
street fighters, 2,000 of whom
were arrested in their great
attempt to keep Sato from leaving
for Washington? For the answer,
we must jump back to the end of
World War 11.
The Zengakuren (All Japan
Students' League) was formed
soon after the war. Under the
influence of the Japan Communist
Party (JCP), the Zengakuren
adopted in the immediate
post-war period the goal of
peaceful revolution; shifted to an

On November 16, near Tokyo's
Haneda airport, thousands of
young students and workers
battled riot police for hours with
staves, tear gas, and molotov
cocktails. The demonstrators'
goal: to keep Japanese Prime
Minister Eisaku Sato from leaving
for Washington to finish
negotiating the "reversion" of
Okinawa to Japan.
Why did these militant Leftists
risk injury and arrest to keep their
Prime Minister from leaving the
country? The answer to this
question is complicated but
important.
Since the Ryukyu Islands were
taken from Japan after World War
11, the US has turned Okinawa,
the largest of the islands into a
veritable arsenal; 45,000
servicemen are stationed at the
117 bases scattered across the
island.
Launching Pad lor US
Okinawa has been the primary
staging ground for the US war
effort in Vietnam. US Army
troops are transported and
supplied from Okinawa. Navy
vessels engaged in the conflict use
Okinawa as a supply and repair
base. Most importantly, Okinawa
is home base for the giant B-52's
that each day hit targets in
Vietnam and Laos.
Japan itself aids the US war
effort in a similar war. Under the
terms of the Treaty of Mutual
Security and Cooperation (or

Ampo, as the Japanese call it), the
US maintains 138 military
installations in Japan. These bases
have also served as staging grounds
for the Vietnam conflict.
Escape Clause
At their November meeting
Sato and President Nixon agreed
to the reversion of Okinawa by
1972. An escape clause in the
agreement provides that after
1972, the US might keep nuclear
weapons on the island and
continue to use the bases there in
an unrestricted manner to aid the
war effort if both Japan and the
US agree to such an arrangement
at that time. Japan will
undoubtedly accede to US
pressure for such agreement when
the time comes.
In addition to the return of
Okinawa, Sato and Nixon agreed
to the continuation of the
Security Treaty, due for
"automatic extension" next June
23. Japan, then, will continue to
aid the US intervention in
Vietnam.
Eliminate US Bases
The Haneda airport battle,
along with others in Japan during
the five days from November 13
to 17, was part of a long-term
strategy designed to end the
Security Treaty and to eliminate
all US bases on Okinawa and in
Japan—a strategy whose ultimate
goal is the disengagement of Japan
from America's imperialist Asian
policy and the replacement of
expansionist Japanese capitalism
with democratic socialism.
But who were these courageous
street fighters, 2,000 of whom
were arrested in their great
attempt to keep Sato from leaving
for Washington? For the answer,
we must jump back to the end of
World War 11.
The Zengakuren (All Japan
Students' League) was formed
soon after the war. Under the
influence of the Japan Communist
Party (JCP), the Zengakuren
adopted in the immediate
post-war period the goal of
peaceful revolution; shifted to an
advocacy of armed struggle during
the Korean War; and swung back
again, along with the JCP, to
promoting peaceful revolution.
University Strikes
In 1958, the Zengakuren split
with the JCP and moved further
left, using such tactics as
university strikes and large
demonstrations—tactics opposed
by the JCP.
During the early 1960'5, after
the Security Treaty had been
signed, the Zengakuren was
relatively quiet. However, during
these years, its belief in struggle
was significantly strengthened.
When Sato tried to leave
Haneda airport on October 8,
1967, for an earlier meeting on
Okinawa with President Johnson,
members of the Zengakuren
battled the riot police with
wooden staves and metal pipes,
called hebabo (literally, "violence
staves").
Several demonstrations were
held in 1968, including one early
in the year to oppose the docking
of the nuclear-powered American
aircraft carrier Enterprise.
/enkyoto Emergen
In January, 1968, a strike

began in the Medical Faculty at
the University of Tokyo, the most
prestigious and influential
university in the country. The
strike centered around low pay
and miserable working conditions.
When the riot police were called
to break down the barricades in
front of the Medical School, the
conflict expanded. Demands for
self-government were promulgated
and a new intra-university
organization was formed called
the Zenkyoto (Students'
Conference for All-University
Struggle). The organization
included elements from all the
factions of the student Left
(except Minsei, the pro-JCP
faction) and non-sect radicals.
(The Japanese Left is even more
sect-ridden than our own. The
Zenkyoto has actually fought
battles with the Minsei and
Kakumaru, another of the sects.)
During the Tokyo University
strike, the Zenkyoto formed
valuable ties with the workers'
union called Sohyo, the largest
and most influential union in
Japan.
SRI Nozzle?
In January, 1969, after two
days of fighting, the riot police
retook the barricaded
administration building using tear
gas dropped from helicopters. (It
seems Governor Reagan keeps up
on events in Japan. Could SRI
have designed the nozzle?) This
led to an extension of the struggle
to universities throughout Japan.)
In April, 1969, students from
Zenkyoto factions participated in
Okinawa demonstrations. This
was the first time the new
Zenkyoto joined in open activity
with other leftist groups; mainly
Hansen (the workers' anti-war
movement), and Beheiren
(Citizens' Union for Peace in
Vietnam).
This led on September 15,
1969, to the formation of the
All-Japan Zenkyoto including all
old factions of Zengakuren,
except Minsei and Kakumaru.
This group sponsored
International Anti-War Day on
October 21. During this single day
7 00,000 Japanese citizens
participated in 832 rallies.
Street-fighting occurred in several
cities. It was this same Zenkyoto
that led the fighting at the time of
Sato's departure in November.
The several thousand arrests
made during the battle of the
sixteenth and in the massive
police dragnets preceeding it have
seriously weakened the Zenkyoto.

goal is the disengagement of Japan
from America's imperialist Asian
policy and the replacement of
expansionist Japanese capitalism
with democratic socialism.
But who were these courageous
street fighters, 2,000 of whom
were arrested in their great
attempt to keep Sato from leaving
for Washington? For the answer,
we must jump back to the end of
World War 11.
The Zengakuren (All Japan
Students' League) was formed
soon after the war. Under the
influence of the Japan Communist
Party (JCP), the Zengakuren
adopted in the immediate
post-war period the goal of
peaceful revolution; shifted to an
advocacy of armed struggle during
the Korean War; and swung back
again, along with the JCP, to
promoting peaceful revolution.
University Strikes
In 1958, the Zengakuren split
with the JCP and moved further
left, using such tactics as
university strikes and large
demonstrations—tactics opposed
by the JCP.
During the early 1960'5, after
the Security Treaty had been
signed, the Zengakuren was
relatively quiet. However, during
these years, its belief in struggle
was significantly strengthened.
When Sato tried to leave
Haneda airport on October 8,
1967, for an earlier meeting on
Okinawa with President Johnson,
members of the Zengakuren
battled the riot police with
wooden staves and metal pipes,
called hebabo (literally, "violence
staves").
Several demonstrations were
held in 1968, including one early
in the year to oppose the docking
of the nuclear-powered American
aircraft carrier Enterprise.
/enkyoto Emergen
In January, 1968, a strike

began in the Medical Faculty at
the University of Tokyo, the most
prestigious and influential
university in the country. The
strike centered around low pay
and miserable working conditions.
When the riot police were called
to break down the barricades in
front of the Medical School, the
conflict expanded. Demands for
self-government were promulgated
and a new intra-university
organization was formed called
the Zenkyoto (Students'
Conference for All-University
Struggle). The organization
included elements from all the
factions of the student Left
(except Minsei, the pro-JCP
faction) and non-sect radicals.
(The Japanese Left is even more
sect-ridden than our own. The
Zenkyoto has actually fought
battles with the Minsei and
Kakumaru, another of the sects.)
During the Tokyo University
strike, the Zenkyoto formed
valuable ties with the workers'
union called Sohyo, the largest
and most influential union in
Japan.
SRI Nozzle?
In January, 1969, after two
days of fighting, the riot police
retook the barricaded
administration building using tear
gas dropped from helicopters. (It
seems Governor Reagan keeps up
on events in Japan. Could SRI
have designed the nozzle?) This
led to an extension of the struggle
to universities throughout Japan.)
In April, 1969, students from
Zenkyoto factions participated in
Okinawa demonstrations. This
was the first time the new
Zenkyoto joined in open activity
with other leftist groups; mainly
Hansen (the workers' anti-war
movement), and Beheiren
(Citizens' Union for Peace in
Vietnam).
This led on September 15,
1969, to the formation of the
All-Japan Zenkyoto including all
old factions of Zengakuren,
except Minsei and Kakumaru.
This group sponsored
International Anti-War Day on
October 21. During this single day
7 00,000 Japanese citizens
participated in 832 rallies.
Street-fighting occurred in several
cities. It was this same Zenkyoto
that led the fighting at the time of
Sato's departure in November.
The several thousand arrests
made during the battle of the
sixteenth and in the massive
police dragnets preceeding it have
seriously weakened the Zenkyoto.
The organization has much
regrouping to do before next
summer when the Security Treaty
is due who will play the most
important role in delaying and
perhaps stopping this
remilitarization.

Hatano, student at the
University of Tokyo and member
of the Zenkyoto, will be on
campus this Wednesday. He will
be showing a film of the Sato
demrthst rations in Tokyo and
discussing the politics of the
student left in Japan. 7:30 in
Bishop Auditorium.
