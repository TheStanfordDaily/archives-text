# Land Use Controversy
## Development: Profit Or Loss?

An outspoken challenge to
Stanford's policy in expanding an
Industrial Park into the Coyote
Hill area and the Dillingham
financial center has been offered
by the radical land-use group,
Grass Roots.
Stanford's policy has been to
develop a certain percentage of its
land to pay increasing taxes, to
support its educational program
and to protest its land from
condemnation by neighboring
communities.
Grass Roots, contends that
these developments will worsen
Jie ecological problems and the
housing crisis in the area, will
generate too much traffic, and
that they are unpopular in the
community. Further, Grass Roots
maintains that the new income to
Stanford from these developments
will be far too small to justify the
> social costs.
Financial Gain
For example, the gain from
Coyote Hill development has been
estimated at about $4 million on
pre-paid leases. This money will
be placed in the University's
endowment where the University
says it will earn between 10 and
12 percent interest. Each year 5
percent will be made available to
the University for spending and
the rest will be reinvested.
According to Grass Roots
member Michael Sweeney, the
real income is thus $200,000 a
year and this is "infinitesimally
smaller than its social cost."
However according to University
Real Estate manager, Boyd Smith,
the income will be approximately
$400,000. To him this money
represents a very important part
of the University's unrestricted
educational budget and is
especially significant in the
percentage it contributes towards
the university's new programs
budget.
According to University Vice-
President for Finance, Kenneth
Cuthbertson, the total income
would best be described by the
$400,000 figure, but the spending
budget which can actually be used
each year is about half that
amount."
(lousing Shortage
In another instance Smith also
quotes from a recent study based
upon facts gleaned from
employers by Alan Maremont,
University consultant on
low-income housing, which shows
that a majority of the employees
in the Stanford Industrial Park
live within five miles of their
work.
Sweeney, however, accused
Smith of lying with statistics. He
quotes the Moulton report on
low-income housing of April,
1969: "the high cost of new
housing and the shortage of older
low priced housing have forced a
large proportion of lower and
even moderate income Palo
Alto-Stanford employees to seek
housing well outside the area."
The University maintains that
the local communities have

control over the use of Stanford
lands. Citizens may exert direct
control either through the
referendum process, or through
their elected representatives, the
city council, which has control
over the zoning of Stanford lands.
Grass Roots insists however
that outspoken local opposition
has been ignored (the Committee
for Green Foothills has 1000
members) and that if the people
of the area had an opportunity to
express their will on the issue,
there is every reason to believe
that they would halt the Coyote
Hill and Dillingham projects.
Development Future
According to Sweeney, what
happens on Stanford land will
have crucial influence on how
built-up the Mid-peninsula will
become in the next decade. If
Stanford adds 5,000 more jobs in
manufacturing and research, there
will be strong pressure to go ahead
with existing plans to convert
downtown Palo Alto into a
complex of high rise financial
office towers."
Says Smith, "How can all
development be stopped and at
the same time better employment
opportunities for the poor be
provided; how can we provide
more public parks without greater
tax revenue; when it costs $1,300
per year to send one child to
school, how can we talk about
adding more children to the rolls
through low-income housing
projects while local school
districts are already under
financed if the local tax base is
kept constant; can Stanford
continue the costly subsidization
of open lands at a time when
expenses outstrip revenues?
"Coyote Hill development will

provide an example to the
Peninsula and the entire country
of the type of working
environment all men deserve. It
will contain 50% open space after
total development.
As long as people need work,
there will be a need for quality
industrial and office development.
Coyote Hill fills this need."

Sweeney agrees that some
co-operation between the
University and industry isn't
necessarily a bad thing, but says,
"the consequences of building an
industrial park shouldn't be
environmental polution, a housing
crisis, and strengthening of the
military-industrial complex."

come under close scrutiny from many segments of

month. The University's position on the
development has been defined by Real Estate
Manager Boyd Smidi.
