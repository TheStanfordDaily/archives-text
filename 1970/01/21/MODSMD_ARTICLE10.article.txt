# Community Of Many
## Child Care 
### Glenda Jones 
A community of parents,
teachers, student "work-study"
volunteers and other interested
people involved in the
organization and development of
the Stanford Community
Children's Center since October
1969 have learned a lot about
how to run a cooperative Center.
The parents of enrolled children
are working in jobs at the Center
as varied as volunteer teachers,
buyers of supplies, janitors and
newsletter editor, and have hired
teachers and established policy.
Presently there are three
committees to facilitate running
the Center smoothly. The
PROGRAM COMMITTEE has a
variety of functions including the
responsibility for planning
immediate and long range
programs. This committee
discusses the direction of the
overall program, the kinds of
activities, and the role of the
parents and student volunteers.
The OPERATIONS
COMMITTEE is responsible for
the day to day functioning of the
Center. It coordinates and directs
a supplies committee, which buys
all edibles and non-edibles, an
equipment committee for
building, borrowing and repairing,
and a clean-up committee which
organizes volunteers' work
schedules.
The three elected positions of
co-ordinator, treasurer and
newsletter editor combine to
make up the COORDINATING
COMMITTEE.
Future of Child Care
This program is only a start. As
the next steps are planned,
important questions will be raised
and discussed. What are the
questions employees and students

have about the Center? How is the
program related to employment
conditions at Stanford? Shouldn't
the University assume more of a
responsibility in this project?
To answer some questions
about the University
responsibility: Stanford should be
just as concerned about providing
child care for the community as it
is about providing cafeterias,
faculty clubs, student and faculty
housing, placement centers, and
the like. The University also has at
its disposal the expertise to find
federal grants and subsidies for
innovative parent-initiated
programs, and the legal aid from
its own Law School to help
combat miles of red tape. The
University also has an obligation
to take the lead in supporting and
implementing educational
programs since its primary
function is to educate.
Recruiting children from their
parents' place of work —the
University — and not from their
separate neighborhoods would
create a Center used by students,
employees and faculty. This
would cut across racial, economic
and educational lines and dispell
the myth that only those mothers
on welfare need child care center
facilities.
Meeting To Be Held
Stanford employees, students,
and faculty are working to expand
child care in our community. We
need the support and help of
everyone who thinks this is vital.
A meeting for everyone who
wants to be involved in Stanford
Child Care or who wants to find
out what is happening in Child
Care is urged to come to a
meeting MONDAY, JANUARY
26, 8:00 p.m., Tressider Union,
Room 274.

Room 274.
A community of parents,
teachers, student "work-study"
volunteers and other interested
people involved in the
organization and development of
the Stanford Community
Children's Center since October
1969 have learned a lot about
how to run a cooperative Center.
The parents of enrolled children
are working in jobs at the Center
as varied as volunteer teachers,
buyers of supplies, janitors and
newsletter editor, and have hired
teachers and established policy.
Presently there are three
committees to facilitate running
the Center smoothly. The
PROGRAM COMMITTEE has a
variety of functions including the
responsibility for planning
immediate and long range
programs. This committee
discusses the direction of the
overall program, the kinds of
activities, and the role of the
parents and student volunteers.
The OPERATIONS
COMMITTEE is responsible for
the day to day functioning of the
Center. It coordinates and directs
a supplies committee, which buys
all edibles and non-edibles, an
equipment committee for
building, borrowing and repairing,
and a clean-up committee which
organizes volunteers' work
schedules.
The three elected positions of
co-ordinator, treasurer and
newsletter editor combine to
make up the COORDINATING
COMMITTEE.
Future of Child Care
This program is only a start. As
the next steps are planned,
important questions will be raised
and discussed. What are the
questions employees and students

have about the Center? How is the
program related to employment
conditions at Stanford? Shouldn't
the University assume more of a
responsibility in this project?
To answer some questions
about the University
responsibility: Stanford should be
just as concerned about providing
child care for the community as it
is about providing cafeterias,
faculty clubs, student and faculty
housing, placement centers, and
the like. The University also has at
its disposal the expertise to find
federal grants and subsidies for
innovative parent-initiated
programs, and the legal aid from
its own Law School to help
combat miles of red tape. The
University also has an obligation
to take the lead in supporting and
implementing educational
programs since its primary
function is to educate.
Recruiting children from their
parents' place of work —the
University — and not from their
separate neighborhoods would
create a Center used by students,
employees and faculty. This
would cut across racial, economic
and educational lines and dispell
the myth that only those mothers
on welfare need child care center
facilities.
Meeting To Be Held
Stanford employees, students,
and faculty are working to expand
child care in our community. We
need the support and help of
everyone who thinks this is vital.
A meeting for everyone who
wants to be involved in Stanford
Child Care or who wants to find
out what is happening in Child
Care is urged to come to a
meeting MONDAY, JANUARY
26, 8:00 p.m., Tressider Union,
