### MARK BARTLETT 
The Stanford-Keio Exchange
Committee begins its 1970
on-campus activities this Saturday
evening, with the showing of
IKIRU (to live!), a Kurosawa
masterpiece that has become a
classic of the Sixties.
IKIRU, the first of this year's
Keio Committee Japanese Film
Festival, is set in the troublsome
Post-War period and tells the story
of a man's agonizing search for
the meaning of life . . .a man with
but a short time to live.
Film Quarterly : "Kurosawa has
endowed the film with
compassion and understanding,
with an ironic awareness of
human weakness and a knowledge
of the dignity of the individual. ..
It is one of the most powerful
humanistic documents the screen
has yet presented."
The Festival continues on
January 24 with Alain Resnais'
HIROSHIMA, MON AMOUR, the
story of a love affair between an
impressionable French actress and
a married Japanese architect.
January 31 brings the all-time
Samurai classic back to the
Stanford campus. YOJIMBO
brought T oshiro Mifune the
Venice Best Actor Award for his
portrayal of an unemployed
Samurai who offers his services to
the highest bidder.
Time: "Looped in a soggy
kimono, crusted with stubble and
sweat, gliding like a tiger,
scratching like an ape, he presents
a ferocious and ironical protrait of
a military monk, a galahad with
lice.'' Enriching the
cinematographic methods that he
used in YOJIMBO, Akira
Kurosawa scores again with his
adaptation of Shakespeare's
"Macbeth".
War Lord Tale
KUMONOSUJO weaves the
tale of a power-hungry war lord in
16th century Japan during the
Sengoku civil wars. Time: ". . .
the spectator scarcely has time to
realize, as the images deafen and
the noises decorate his
imagination, that he is
experiencing effects of cinema
seldom matched in their headlong
masculine power of imagination."
KUMONOSUJO will be
screened on February 7 and will
be followed three weeks later with
the last and major offering of this
year's Japanese Film Festival,
Kihachi Okamoto's THE SWORD
OF DOOM. In what one critic
called "a modern poem of
violence", Okamoto brings
together perhaps the two greatest
screen actors in Japan, Tatsuya
Nakadai and Toshiro Mifune.
Murder, Vengeance
THE SWORD OF DOOM is a
story of senseless murder, political
assassinations, family vengeance,
and ultimate self-hatred all
wrapped in the hectic decade
preceding the War of the
Restoration. The New York Times
says of this film: "This dreadful,
climatic sequence of wholesale
carnage, when the pent-up hero
goes berserk in a houseful of
assassin accomplices, splatters the
eye." All of the preceding films
will be screened on Saturday
evenings in Cubberly Auditorium

with showings at 7:30 and 10:00
P.M.
The Keio Committee's
Japanese Film Festival enters its
fourth year of bringing the best of
Japanese cinema to the Stanford
Community. The Festival is an
annual fund-raising event to
support the programs of the
Stanford-Keio Exchange
Committee.
In February, 12 Keio students
arrive on campus and begin 8
weeks of intimate exposure to
American university life and to
American culture in general. A
like number of Stanford students
selected in the fall depart in June
for two months of travel in Japan,
living in host families in Tokyo,
Kyoto, Nara, and participating in
a number of programs designed to
bring the Japanese and Stanford
students into cultural, political,
and human interaction.


FIRE DAMAGE-Damaged portion of home of Chancellor Wallace Sterling is
shown following the Monday afternoon blaze that caused $115,000 damage to
the Woodside residence. The fire was confined to the kitchen, adjacent hallways,
storage room and eating area. Fire Department officials say the blaze was of
natural origin. It started outside the kitchen in a pile of firewood. Both Sterling
and his wife were away at the time of die fire, which took about 30minutes to
control.
