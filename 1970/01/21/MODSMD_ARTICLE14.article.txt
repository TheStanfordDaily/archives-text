# UC's Heyns Hits Credit For Courses
## 
### 
University of California at
Berkeley Chancellor Roger Heyns
warned his faculty Monday not to
"misuse" its authority by granting
credit to individual study
programs that are "inappropriate
and activist-oriented."
Heyns told the Academic
Senate that such courses are
"destructive of the . . . foundation
of the institution."
His speech came in the wake of
a controversy that developed ove»
a course organized by the
Committee on Participant
Education, an experimental
college run by students.
A Criminology faculty member
had agreed to sponsor, for credit,
a class on "Repression and the
Movement." The department
head, however, objected at the
last minute to the content of the
course as outlined in the
committee's catalogue.
The catalogue, prepared by the
students, said two of the major
objectives of the class would be
staging "information rallies and
photographing and revealing
undercover pigs" on campus.
Heyns said that professors
should be "alert to some obvious
traps.
"There are students on the
campus and non-students who are
anxious to involve the university
in their programs of direct social
action, and they are willing to
make deliberately outrageous
claims about course content," he
said.
"When the instructor or the
chairman makes appropriate
changes or denies credit, we can
expect cries of infringement of
academic freedom or
administrative pressure. This, for
some, is part of the strategy, the
scenario they want followed,"
Heyns added.
The Chancellor noted that
unless "sound educational
standards" are maintained, the
university will not be able to
retain its freedoms and autonomy.
