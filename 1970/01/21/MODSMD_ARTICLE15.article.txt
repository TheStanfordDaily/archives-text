# Move On Physical Plant
## Teamsters Influence Labor Scene 
### ED KOHN Last of a series 
(Editor's note: This is the third
and last installment of a series
dealing with the Teamsters Union
on the Stanford campus. The first
two parts appeared in last
Thursday and Friday's issues.)
Many of the Physical Plant
employees are dissatisfied with
their jobs and benefits at
Stanford; and, as Art Davis said
recently, "some of the men are
ready to strike right now." Since
the Teamsters are the first major
unio to specifically attempt to
organize Plant employees, some of
the men are hesitant to deal with
the ad hoc group, and as a result,
the union is proceeding slowly,
making certain that it has the
workers' support all the time.
Meetings between Rudy Tham,
Davis, other union officials and
the Plant employees, which have
occured at two-week intervals,
provide much of the feedback
between the two groups. It is at
these meetings that the Teamsters
have won much of their
'constituency's* support; that is,
support from the Plant
employees.
The group generally meets
every other Thursday night at
Ricky's Hyatt House on El
Camino for about two hours.
Originally, Keith Stothers tried to
hold on-campus meetings, but he
found that he was having too
much trouble securing a meeting
room and that the other
employees were reluctant to meet
on the campus, fearing reprisals
from their supervisors, many of
whom, according to the men,
took steps to "warn" others about
attending the meetings.
Tham or the other speakers,
along with Stothers, usually spend
about two hours answering
questions ranging from the
legality of organizing on-campus
workers to an explanation of the
Teamsters' benefit programs. The
meetings, which are usually quiet
affairs, attract between 50 and 80
members, and usually break up
into informal discussion sessions
lasting until all questions
seemingly have been answered.
Belt-Tightening Frightens Workers
Almost all of the employees are

worried about the effects of their
preliminary, unbinding union
affiliations, particularly since the
men have no job security.
Stothers said that more of the
workers would join the
organization except that some of
the men are too worried about the
University's "belt-tightening" to
make a move toward the Ad Hoc
Teamsters. Most workers cite the
carpenters as a prime example of
this belt-tightening although the
carpenters' were never actually
fired—they just left on their own
volition after being told that their
jobs were being phased out.
However, Stothers feels that
almost all of the Plant employees
will sign the"letters of intent" or
show some definite signs of
sympathy for the ad hoc group
within a few weeks.
University Clarification
Davis told the Daily a week ago
that the meetings have been
suspended until Tham receives
what he considers to be a
sufficiently clear interpretation of
University policy regarding
recognition of outside unions on
campus or until the men in the
Physical Plant decide that the
University has no intention of
rendering such clarification.
The University's letter of
clarification was made available to
the Daily yesterday. The letter
was written by Robert M. Nelson,
who is now the University's
Director of Personnel and
Employee Relations. It reads, in
part:
"It is my belief that President
Pitzer's letter of Dec. 11, 1969 set
forth the University's position
quite clearly with regard to your
questions. Concerning the matter
of voluntary employee
organizations, the policy
statement was issued to make it
clear that no employee is to be
subject to any sort of
discrimination or intimidation
because of participation in a
group activity, and the statement
was directed primarily to
managers and supervisors. We have
considered the statement to be
limited to that particular subject,

and we do not feel that it has
broader implications.
Deal With Own Employees
"Concerning the matter of
Union recognition, I repeat our
earlier statement that it is
University policy to meet with
individual employees or groups of
employees to discuss such
questions by outside organizations
or representatives. We have no
reason at this time to believe that
this policy is not effective in
hearing and resolving any
questions employees may have."
Later, Nelson told the Daily,
"The University prefers to deal
with its own employees" and that
it doesn't accept outsiders to
represent its employees.
When asked about possible
University reaction to a strike by
Physical Plant employees, Nelson
said, "We would feel that a strike
would not be justified. We would
ask all people concerned to return
and find out what some of the
real problems are."
Lack of Communication
Nelson said that the last series
of meetings covering campus-wide
employees was held on Dec. 12,
the day after President Pitzer's
first letter of clarification. Since
then, he said, no other major
meetings have taken place.
He said that one of the major
problems developing is the "lack
of communications" between the
Teamsters and the University
officials. He said that the only
exchange that has taken place has
been the series of letters that
began in late November.
Nelson emphasized that the
University was not dealing with
any unions other than the four in
the Stanford University Press,
where no contracts have been
signed. He said that the University
cooperated with the unions there
because the Press is a
"semi-commercial" operation.
Speaking of the Fire Department,
which recently joined an
AFL-CIO affiliate, Nelson said
that a meeting has taken place but
that "we're not dealing with the
union (1-12); we're talking with
the men as individuals."
Next Move Teamsters
The next move is now up to the
Teamsters. Probably, a general
meeting of the Plant workers will
be held and a course of action will
be decided upon. However, no
definitive statement was available
from the Teamsters because Tham
is out of town on business.
One reason for the Teamsters
success on campus is their power.
All of the Physical Plant workers
know something of the strength
of the union, which claims
1,650,000 members and is the

largest independent union in the
country.
The Teamsters offer a program
that, in the eyes of the workers,
can best be described in terms of
"an ideal"—a contract, tenure,
better fringe benefits, and
nationwide support. And the men
are attracted to this ideal, which is
primarily equality with other
workers in the same fields on the
Peninsula, because they presently
feel that they are underpaid and
that their fringe benefits are
poorer than others offered to
industrial workers in this area.
Below Moderate Income
Nelson said that the University
offers a good retirement program
to its workers and that benefits
were consistent with other
businesses in the area. He said,
however, that some of the
benefits cost the employees
slightly more here than they do at
other businesses. He said that the
University's contribution in the
form of benefits to each worker is
about $40 per month.
The workers, nonetheless, cite
figures published by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics that indicate a
"moderate income" family in this
area spends an average of slightly
more than $910 per month. The
statistics also point out that
inflation in this area ranges
between seven and ten percent
annually.
The maximum salary paid an
employee, according to the
"Allocation of Classification to
Ranges," which was published in
Campus Report late last year, in
the Physical Plant is $875 per
month. And this salary is for a
"specialty" electrician. Most other
Plant employees, according to the
"Classification," are paid about

$75 per month less than the salary
paid a "specialty" electrician.
Most of the interested Physical
Plant employees feel that the
Teamsters are the ones to bring
their salaries and benefits into line
with other Peninsula businesses.
With the Teamsters' nationwide
power backing up their efforts
here, the Teamsters are sure to
have a major impact on Stanford's
campus labor affairs.
But for the Teamsters, the
Physical Plant workers are only a
beginning. They have expressed
interest in meeting with cafeteria
employees and other groups that
could easily be classified as
cohesive bargaining units. But
they "must wait and see what
happens in the coming weeks at
the Physical Plant, particularly
what happens during and after the
next general meeting, before they
can move to expand.

feel that they are underpaid and
that their fringe benefits are
poorer than others offered to
industrial workers in this area.
Below Moderate Income
Nelson said that the University
offers a good retirement program
to its workers and that benefits
were consistent with other
businesses in the area. He said,
however, that some of the
benefits cost the employees
slightly more here than they do at
other businesses. He said that the
University's contribution in the
form of benefits to each worker is
about $40 per month.
The workers, nonetheless, cite
figures published by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics that indicate a
"moderate income" family in this
area spends an average of slightly
more than $910 per month. The
statistics also point out that
inflation in this area ranges
between seven and ten percent
annually.
The maximum salary paid an
employee, according to the
"Allocation of Classification to
Ranges," which was published in
Campus Report late last year, in
the Physical Plant is $875 per
month. And this salary is for a
"specialty" electrician. Most other
Plant employees, according to the
"Classification," are paid about

$75 per month less than the salary
paid a "specialty" electrician.
Most of the interested Physical
Plant employees feel that the
Teamsters are the ones to bring
their salaries and benefits into line
with other Peninsula businesses.
With the Teamsters' nationwide
power backing up their efforts
here, the Teamsters are sure to
have a major impact on Stanford's
campus labor affairs.
But for the Teamsters, the
Physical Plant workers are only a
beginning. They have expressed
interest in meeting with cafeteria
employees and other groups that
could easily be classified as
cohesive bargaining units. But
they "must wait and see what
happens in the coming weeks at
the Physical Plant, particularly
what happens during and after the
next general meeting, before they
can move to expand.
(Editor's note: This is the third
and last installment of a series
dealing with the Teamsters Union
on the Stanford campus. The first
two parts appeared in last
Thursday and Friday's issues.)
Many of the Physical Plant
employees are dissatisfied with
their jobs and benefits at
Stanford; and, as Art Davis said
recently, "some of the men are
ready to strike right now." Since
the Teamsters are the first major
unio to specifically attempt to
organize Plant employees, some of
the men are hesitant to deal with
the ad hoc group, and as a result,
the union is proceeding slowly,
making certain that it has the
workers' support all the time.
Meetings between Rudy Tham,
Davis, other union officials and
the Plant employees, which have
occured at two-week intervals,
provide much of the feedback
between the two groups. It is at
these meetings that the Teamsters
have won much of their
'constituency's* support; that is,
support from the Plant
employees.
The group generally meets
every other Thursday night at
Ricky's Hyatt House on El
Camino for about two hours.
Originally, Keith Stothers tried to
hold on-campus meetings, but he
found that he was having too
much trouble securing a meeting
room and that the other
employees were reluctant to meet
on the campus, fearing reprisals
from their supervisors, many of
whom, according to the men,
took steps to "warn" others about
attending the meetings.
Tham or the other speakers,
along with Stothers, usually spend
about two hours answering
questions ranging from the
legality of organizing on-campus
workers to an explanation of the
Teamsters' benefit programs. The
meetings, which are usually quiet
affairs, attract between 50 and 80
members, and usually break up
into informal discussion sessions
lasting until all questions
seemingly have been answered.
Belt-Tightening Frightens Workers
Almost all of the employees are

worried about the effects of their
preliminary, unbinding union
affiliations, particularly since the
men have no job security.
Stothers said that more of the
workers would join the
organization except that some of
the men are too worried about the
University's "belt-tightening" to
make a move toward the Ad Hoc
Teamsters. Most workers cite the
carpenters as a prime example of
this belt-tightening although the
carpenters' were never actually
fired—they just left on their own
volition after being told that their
jobs were being phased out.
However, Stothers feels that
almost all of the Plant employees
will sign the"letters of intent" or
show some definite signs of
sympathy for the ad hoc group
within a few weeks.
University Clarification
Davis told the Daily a week ago
that the meetings have been
suspended until Tham receives
what he considers to be a
sufficiently clear interpretation of
University policy regarding
recognition of outside unions on
campus or until the men in the
Physical Plant decide that the
University has no intention of
rendering such clarification.
The University's letter of
clarification was made available to
the Daily yesterday. The letter
was written by Robert M. Nelson,
who is now the University's
Director of Personnel and
Employee Relations. It reads, in
part:
"It is my belief that President
Pitzer's letter of Dec. 11, 1969 set
forth the University's position
quite clearly with regard to your
questions. Concerning the matter
of voluntary employee
organizations, the policy
statement was issued to make it
clear that no employee is to be
subject to any sort of
discrimination or intimidation
because of participation in a
group activity, and the statement
was directed primarily to
managers and supervisors. We have
considered the statement to be
limited to that particular subject,

and we do not feel that it has
broader implications.
Deal With Own Employees
"Concerning the matter of
Union recognition, I repeat our
earlier statement that it is
University policy to meet with
individual employees or groups of
employees to discuss such
questions by outside organizations
or representatives. We have no
reason at this time to believe that
this policy is not effective in
hearing and resolving any
questions employees may have."
Later, Nelson told the Daily,
"The University prefers to deal
with its own employees" and that
it doesn't accept outsiders to
represent its employees.
When asked about possible
University reaction to a strike by
Physical Plant employees, Nelson
said, "We would feel that a strike
would not be justified. We would
ask all people concerned to return
and find out what some of the
real problems are."
Lack of Communication
Nelson said that the last series
of meetings covering campus-wide
employees was held on Dec. 12,
the day after President Pitzer's
first letter of clarification. Since
then, he said, no other major
meetings have taken place.
He said that one of the major
problems developing is the "lack
of communications" between the
Teamsters and the University
officials. He said that the only
exchange that has taken place has
been the series of letters that
began in late November.
Nelson emphasized that the
University was not dealing with
any unions other than the four in
the Stanford University Press,
where no contracts have been
signed. He said that the University
cooperated with the unions there
because the Press is a
"semi-commercial" operation.
Speaking of the Fire Department,
which recently joined an
AFL-CIO affiliate, Nelson said
that a meeting has taken place but
that "we're not dealing with the
union (1-12); we're talking with
the men as individuals."
Next Move Teamsters
The next move is now up to the
Teamsters. Probably, a general
meeting of the Plant workers will
be held and a course of action will
be decided upon. However, no
definitive statement was available
from the Teamsters because Tham
is out of town on business.
One reason for the Teamsters
success on campus is their power.
All of the Physical Plant workers
know something of the strength
of the union, which claims
1,650,000 members and is the

largest independent union in the
country.
The Teamsters offer a program
that, in the eyes of the workers,
can best be described in terms of
"an ideal"—a contract, tenure,
better fringe benefits, and
nationwide support. And the men
are attracted to this ideal, which is
primarily equality with other
workers in the same fields on the
Peninsula, because they presently
feel that they are underpaid and
that their fringe benefits are
poorer than others offered to
industrial workers in this area.
Below Moderate Income
Nelson said that the University
offers a good retirement program
to its workers and that benefits
were consistent with other
businesses in the area. He said,
however, that some of the

of meetings covering campus-wide
employees was held on Dec. 12,
the day after President Pitzer's
first letter of clarification. Since
then, he said, no other major
meetings have taken place.
He said that one of the major
problems developing is the "lack
of communications" between the
Teamsters and the University
officials. He said that the only
exchange that has taken place has
been the series of letters that
began in late November.
Nelson emphasized that the
University was not dealing with
any unions other than the four in
the Stanford University Press,
where no contracts have been
signed. He said that the University
cooperated with the unions there
because the Press is a
"semi-commercial" operation.
Speaking of the Fire Department,
which recently joined an
AFL-CIO affiliate, Nelson said
that a meeting has taken place but
that "we're not dealing with the
union (1-12); we're talking with
the men as individuals."
Next Move Teamsters
The next move is now up to the
Teamsters. Probably, a general
meeting of the Plant workers will
be held and a course of action will
be decided upon. However, no
definitive statement was available
from the Teamsters because Tham
is out of town on business.
One reason for the Teamsters
success on campus is their power.
All of the Physical Plant workers
know something of the strength
of the union, which claims
1,650,000 members and is the

largest independent union in the
country.
The Teamsters offer a program
that, in the eyes of the workers,
can best be described in terms of
"an ideal"—a contract, tenure,
better fringe benefits, and
nationwide support. And the men
are attracted to this ideal, which is
primarily equality with other
workers in the same fields on the
Peninsula, because they presently
feel that they are underpaid and
that their fringe benefits are
poorer than others offered to
industrial workers in this area.
Below Moderate Income
Nelson said that the University
offers a good retirement program
to its workers and that benefits
were consistent with other
businesses in the area. He said,
however, that some of the
benefits cost the employees
slightly more here than they do at
other businesses. He said that the
University's contribution in the
form of benefits to each worker is
about $40 per month.
The workers, nonetheless, cite
figures published by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics that indicate a
"moderate income" family in this
area spends an average of slightly
more than $910 per month. The
statistics also point out that
inflation in this area ranges
between seven and ten percent
annually.
The maximum salary paid an
employee, according to the
"Allocation of Classification to
Ranges," which was published in
Campus Report late last year, in
the Physical Plant is $875 per
month. And this salary is for a
"specialty" electrician. Most other
Plant employees, according to the
"Classification," are paid about

$75 per month less than the salary
paid a "specialty" electrician.
Most of the interested Physical
Plant employees feel that the
Teamsters are the ones to bring
their salaries and benefits into line
with other Peninsula businesses.
With the Teamsters' nationwide
power backing up their efforts
here, the Teamsters are sure to
have a major impact on Stanford's
campus labor affairs.
But for the Teamsters, the
Physical Plant workers are only a
beginning. They have expressed
interest in meeting with cafeteria
employees and other groups that
could easily be classified as
cohesive bargaining units. But
they "must wait and see what
happens in the coming weeks at
the Physical Plant, particularly
what happens during and after the
next general meeting, before they
can move to expand.
(Editor's note: This is the third
and last installment of a series
dealing with the Teamsters Union
on the Stanford campus. The first
two parts appeared in last
Thursday and Friday's issues.)
Many of the Physical Plant
employees are dissatisfied with
their jobs and benefits at
Stanford; and, as Art Davis said
recently, "some of the men are
ready to strike right now." Since
the Teamsters are the first major
unio to specifically attempt to
organize Plant employees, some of
the men are hesitant to deal with
the ad hoc group, and as a result,
the union is proceeding slowly,
making certain that it has the
workers' support all the time.
Meetings between Rudy Tham,
Davis, other union officials and
the Plant employees, which have
occured at two-week intervals,
provide much of the feedback
between the two groups. It is at
these meetings that the Teamsters
have won much of their
'constituency's* support; that is,
support from the Plant
employees.
The group generally meets
every other Thursday night at
Ricky's Hyatt House on El
Camino for about two hours.
Originally, Keith Stothers tried to
hold on-campus meetings, but he
found that he was having too
much trouble securing a meeting
room and that the other
employees were reluctant to meet
on the campus, fearing reprisals
from their supervisors, many of
whom, according to the men,
took steps to "warn" others about
attending the meetings.
Tham or the other speakers,
along with Stothers, usually spend
about two hours answering
questions ranging from the
legality of organizing on-campus
workers to an explanation of the
Teamsters' benefit programs. The
meetings, which are usually quiet
affairs, attract between 50 and 80
members, and usually break up
into informal discussion sessions
lasting until all questions
seemingly have been answered.
Belt-Tightening Frightens Workers
Almost all of the employees are

worried about the effects of their
preliminary, unbinding union
affiliations, particularly since the
men have no job security.
Stothers said that more of the
workers would join the
organization except that some of
the men are too worried about the
University's "belt-tightening" to
make a move toward the Ad Hoc
Teamsters. Most workers cite the
carpenters as a prime example of
this belt-tightening although the
carpenters' were never actually
fired—they just left on their own
volition after being told that their
jobs were being phased out.
However, Stothers feels that
almost all of the Plant employees
will sign the"letters of intent" or
show some definite signs of
sympathy for the ad hoc group
within a few weeks.
University Clarification
Davis told the Daily a week ago
that the meetings have been
suspended until Tham receives
what he considers to be a
sufficiently clear interpretation of
University policy regarding
recognition of outside unions on
campus or until the men in the
Physical Plant decide that the
University has no intention of
rendering such clarification.
The University's letter of
clarification was made available to
the Daily yesterday. The letter
was written by Robert M. Nelson,
who is now the University's
Director of Personnel and
Employee Relations. It reads, in
part:
"It is my belief that President
Pitzer's letter of Dec. 11, 1969 set
forth the University's position
quite clearly with regard to your
questions. Concerning the matter
of voluntary employee
organizations, the policy
statement was issued to make it
clear that no employee is to be
subject to any sort of
discrimination or intimidation
because of participation in a
group activity, and the statement
was directed primarily to
managers and supervisors. We have
considered the statement to be
limited to that particular subject,

and we do not feel that it has
broader implications.
Deal With Own Employees
"Concerning the matter of
Union recognition, I repeat our
earlier statement that it is
University policy to meet with
individual employees or groups of
employees to discuss such
questions by outside organizations
or representatives. We have no
reason at this time to believe that
this policy is not effective in
hearing and resolving any
questions employees may have."
Later, Nelson told the Daily,
"The University prefers to deal
with its own employees" and that
it doesn't accept outsiders to
represent its employees.
When asked about possible
University reaction to a strike by
Physical Plant employees, Nelson
said, "We would feel that a strike
would not be justified. We would
ask all people concerned to return
and find out what some of the
real problems are."

Nelson said that the last series

what he considers to be a
sufficiently clear interpretation of
University policy regarding
recognition of outside unions on
campus or until the men in the
Physical Plant decide that the
University has no intention of
rendering such clarification.
The University's letter of
clarification was made available to
the Daily yesterday. The letter
was written by Robert M. Nelson,
who is now the University's
Director of Personnel and
Employee Relations. It reads, in
part:
"It is my belief that President
Pitzer's letter of Dec. 11, 1969 set
forth the University's position
quite clearly with regard to your
questions. Concerning the matter
of voluntary employee
organizations, the policy
statement was issued to make it
clear that no employee is to be
subject to any sort of
discrimination or intimidation
because of participation in a
group activity, and the statement
was directed primarily to
managers and supervisors. We have
considered the statement to be
limited to that particular subject,

and we do not feel that it has
broader implications.
Deal With Own Employees
"Concerning the matter of
Union recognition, I repeat our
earlier statement that it is
University policy to meet with
individual employees or groups of
employees to discuss such
questions by outside organizations
or representatives. We have no
reason at this time to believe that
this policy is not effective in
hearing and resolving any
questions employees may have."
Later, Nelson told the Daily,
"The University prefers to deal
with its own employees" and that
it doesn't accept outsiders to
represent its employees.
When asked about possible
University reaction to a strike by
Physical Plant employees, Nelson
said, "We would feel that a strike
would not be justified. We would
ask all people concerned to return
and find out what some of the
real problems are."
Lack of Communication
Nelson said that the last series
of meetings covering campus-wide
employees was held on Dec. 12,
the day after President Pitzer's
first letter of clarification. Since
then, he said, no other major
meetings have taken place.
He said that one of the major
problems developing is the "lack
of communications" between the
Teamsters and the University
officials. He said that the only
exchange that has taken place has
been the series of letters that
began in late November.
Nelson emphasized that the
University was not dealing with
any unions other than the four in
the Stanford University Press,
where no contracts have been
signed. He said that the University
cooperated with the unions there
because the Press is a
"semi-commercial" operation.
Speaking of the Fire Department,
which recently joined an
AFL-CIO affiliate, Nelson said
that a meeting has taken place but
that "we're not dealing with the
union (1-12); we're talking with
the men as individuals."
Next Move Teamsters
The next move is now up to the
Teamsters. Probably, a general
meeting of the Plant workers will
be held and a course of action will
be decided upon. However, no
definitive statement was available
from the Teamsters because Tham
is out of town on business.
One reason for the Teamsters
success on campus is their power.
All of the Physical Plant workers
know something of the strength
of the union, which claims
1,650,000 members and is the

largest independent union in the
country.
The Teamsters offer a program
that, in the eyes of the workers,
can best be described in terms of
"an ideal"—a contract, tenure,
better fringe benefits, and
nationwide support. And the men
are attracted to this ideal, which is
primarily equality with other
workers in the same fields on the
Peninsula, because they presently
feel that they are underpaid and
that their fringe benefits are
poorer than others offered to
industrial workers in this area.
Below Moderate Income
Nelson said that the University
offers a good retirement program
to its workers and that benefits
were consistent with other
businesses in the area. He said,
however, that some of the
benefits cost the employees
slightly more here than they do at
other businesses. He said that the
University's contribution in the
form of benefits to each worker is
about $40 per month.
The workers, nonetheless, cite
figures published by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics that indicate a
"moderate income" family in this
area spends an average of slightly
more than $910 per month. The
statistics also point out that
inflation in this area ranges
between seven and ten percent
annually.
The maximum salary paid an
employee, according to the
"Allocation of Classification to
Ranges," which was published in
Campus Report late last year, in
the Physical Plant is $875 per
month. And this salary is for a
"specialty" electrician. Most other
Plant employees, according to the
"Classification," are paid about

$75 per month less than the salary
paid a "specialty" electrician.
Most of the interested Physical
Plant employees feel that the
Teamsters are the ones to bring
their salaries and benefits into line
with other Peninsula businesses.
With the Teamsters' nationwide
power backing up their efforts
here, the Teamsters are sure to
have a major impact on Stanford's
campus labor affairs.
But for the Teamsters, the
Physical Plant workers are only a
beginning. They have expressed
interest in meeting with cafeteria
employees and other groups that
could easily be classified as
cohesive bargaining units. But
they "must wait and see what
happens in the coming weeks at
the Physical Plant, particularly
what happens during and after the
next general meeting, before they
can move to expand.
(Editor's note: This is the third
and last installment of a series
dealing with the Teamsters Union
on the Stanford campus. The first
two parts appeared in last
Thursday and Friday's issues.)
Many of the Physical Plant
employees are dissatisfied with
their jobs and benefits at
Stanford; and, as Art Davis said
recently, "some of the men are
ready to strike right now." Since
the Teamsters are the first major
unio to specifically attempt to
organize Plant employees, some of
the men are hesitant to deal with
the ad hoc group, and as a result,
the union is proceeding slowly,
making certain that it has the
workers' support all the time.
Meetings between Rudy Tham,
Davis, other union officials and
the Plant employees, which have
occured at two-week intervals,
provide much of the feedback
between the two groups. It is at
these meetings that the Teamsters
have won much of their
'constituency's* support; that is,
support from the Plant
employees.
The group generally meets
every other Thursday night at
Ricky's Hyatt House on El
Camino for about two hours.
Originally, Keith Stothers tried to
hold on-campus meetings, but he
found that he was having too
much trouble securing a meeting
room and that the other
employees were reluctant to meet
on the campus, fearing reprisals
from their supervisors, many of
whom, according to the men,
took steps to "warn" others about
attending the meetings.
Tham or the other speakers,
along with Stothers, usually spend
about two hours answering
questions ranging from the
legality of organizing on-campus
workers to an explanation of the
Teamsters' benefit programs. The
meetings, which are usually quiet
affairs, attract between 50 and 80
members, and usually break up
into informal discussion sessions
lasting until all questions
seemingly have been answered.
Belt-Tightening Frightens Workers
Almost all of the employees are

worried about the effects of their
preliminary, unbinding union
affiliations, particularly since the
men have no job security.
Stothers said that more of the
workers would join the
organization except that some of
the men are too worried about the
University's "belt-tightening" to
make a move toward the Ad Hoc
Teamsters. Most workers cite the
carpenters as a prime example of
this belt-tightening although the
carpenters' were never actually
fired—they just left on their own
volition after being told that their
jobs were being phased out.
However, Stothers feels that
almost all of the Plant employees
will sign the"letters of intent" or
show some definite signs of
sympathy for the ad hoc group
within a few weeks.
University Clarification
Davis told the Daily a week ago
that the meetings have been
suspended until Tham receives
what he considers to be a
sufficiently clear interpretation of
University policy regarding
recognition of outside unions on
campus or until the men in the
Physical Plant decide that the
University has no intention of
rendering such clarification.
