# Group Attacks War In SF Court Suit
## 
### 
Stanford Professor Pierre
Noyes, SLAC, along with
approximately 400 members of
the "Committee for a Direct
Attack on the Legality of the
Vietnam War" yesterday filed suit
against President Nixon and other
federal officials.
The suit, filed in the U.S.
District Court in San Francisco,
calls on the Federal Court to
declare the Vietnam War unlawful
and unconstitutional.
The suit, which is a Complaint
for Declaratory and Other Relief
against President Richard Nixon,
also names as defendants
Secretary of State Melvin Laird;
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers; the chiefs of staff of the
Army, Navy, Air Force, and
Marine Corps; General Creighton
C. Abrams, Commander of U.S.
forces in Vietnam; Directors of
the Internal Revenue Service; and
the Secretaries of the Army,
Navy, and Air Force. The suit was
filed by San Jose Attorney John
E. Thome, a graduate of the
Stanford Law School.
The suit asks the Court to settle
the question as a matter of law
and fact as to whether (1) the war
in Vietnam is an aggressive war in
violation of international law and
U.S. treaties; (2) U.S. armed

forces are committing war crimes;
(3) the war is unconstitutional
because there has been no
Congressional declaration of war;
and (4) spending tax monies
collected from the plaintiff is
illegal.
The Court will be asked to issue
a declaratory judgement that the
defendants and their predecessors
have acted unlawfully and
unconstitutionally; and that an
order be issued requiring all illegal
military actions in Vietnam to be
discontinued by the defendents,
unless they obtain a Congressional
declaration of war.
Monday, the Supreme Court
rejected a similar suit filed by a
University of Kansas professor by
a vote of 7 to 1, with Justice
William O. Douglas dissenting.
Professor Noyes received his
B.A. from Harvard in 1943 and
his Ph.D. from the University of
California in 1950. He was head
of the general research group in
theoretical physics at the
Livermore site of Lawrence
Radiation Laboratory from 1955
to 1962. He became head of the
theoretical physics section at
SLAC in 1962. Co-complaintants
with Prof. Noyes include over 300
individuals from throughout the
nation.
