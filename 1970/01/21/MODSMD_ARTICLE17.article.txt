# Shopping Center Plan Halted
## 
### 
The Cupertino City Council
stopped plans Monday night for a
proposed 150-acre shopping
center by reaffirming its belief
that the controversial Westridge
foothills site should have a
low-density residential
development.
Plans called for the
construction of four major
department stores and 150 smaller
shops on the site near theJunipero
Serra Freeway and Foothill
Boulevard.
The cities of Los Altos and Los
Altos Hills opposed the Westridge
plan. Los Altos merchants had
started a campaign to fight the
development, as did
conservationists and other area
residents.

The plan, announced last fall,
claimed that Macy's California
and J.C. Penny were both
interested in being major retailers
in the center.
The Cupertino council's action
was unanimous in going on record
"to affirm its position of
supporting the master plan"
which showed the area, at present
unincorporated, to be zoned for
residential use when it enters the
city.
