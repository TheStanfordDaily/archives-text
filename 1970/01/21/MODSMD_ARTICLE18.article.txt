# WLF Plans Action
## 
### 
The Stanford Women's
Liberation Front held its first
meeting of the quarter Monday,
focusing on two issues.
Discussion centered first on
plans for participation in the
International Women's Day,
scheduled for March 8 in San
Francisco. Other Bay Area
women's groups, such as Los Siete
de la Raza, the Panthers and
Welfare Rights, will also be
involved.
Plans were also made to pass
petitions in dorms to support the
establishment of a child-care
center on campus. The group
claims free day care for children
of Stanford students and
employees is badly needed and
that the Stanford elementary
school, soon to be vacated, is a
good location for the project.
One member charged the group
with "farsightedness," saying it is
attempting to free other women
when it cannot stop
descrimination within the
university.
The consensus of the meeting
was that the objectives of the
Front were to work at Stanford as
well as on a community and
national level.
