# Supervisors Ask Probe Of SRI Role
## 
### 
Members of the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors asked
Monday for an assessment of the
services provided to the city by
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI).
Supervisors Dorothy von
Beroldingen and Peter Tamaras,
who made the request, said they
want to study SRl's activities for
the city before considering a
request that it be kept on the
payroll as San Francisco's agent in
Washington, D.C.
An agreement with SRI was
made last year over the strong
objections of Mrs. von
Beroldingen and several other
supervisors who wanted to retain
the present lobbyist.
As a non-profit institution, SRI
cannot lobby for the city, but it
was hired to keep San Francisco
informed of possible Federal
funds for various projects.
It is paid by the city for its
work, up to a limit of $28,000 a
year.
