# Edwards Offers Pitzer Braunstein Trade-Off
## 
### 
In an attempt at compromise,
ASSU Senate Chairman Dave
Edwards has sent an open letter to
President Kenneth Pitzer which
would in effect reject Yale
Braunstein's nomination in
exchange for an agreement giving
students complete control over
student nominations except where
a judicial decision is involved.
Says Edwards, "We don't think
that anyone besides the students
should decide what students
should do; not Pitzer, the Board
of Trustees, the Dean of Students,
or any other administrator."
"This is not a compromise; it's
an alternative," he says."I haven't
been in any negotiations with any
administrators, I've talked to
students to see what they feel,
and it's just what I think should
be done."
In addition to Edward's letter,
it is reported that ASSU President
Patrick Shea will submit a

resolution rescinding Braunstein's
nomination, fcj.t supporting the
other student nominees.
According to Senator Jim
Schnieder '"'ln all probability, one
way or another the resolution
rescind'ng the nominations will be
nullified."
Schnieder says, "There are four
basic ideas floating around what
to do, and we will just have to
wait to see which one will
emerge."
Several senators have also
reported that Shea has been
personally lobbying for a
compromise on the Braunstein
nomination. According to senator
John Delaney there has been
lobbying, and he says,"I consider
it the President's job to do such
things. Shea was simply bringing
up the fact that it is absurd to
attack Pitzer since he is on our
side. In this case, the Board would
probably just as soon not have

students on the committees at
all."
Other senators, however, deny
the lobbying charge. "I don't
know of any lobbying yet,"
reports Senator Patrick C. Shea.
"He's been talking to senators,
but I think he's just interested in
finding out the mood of the
Senate."
Schnieder also disagrees with
the term lobbying. "Shea arftl I
have spoken, and our ideas are not
too far apart. Those of us* who
would like to see the students
reinstated on the committees are
all after the same end," he says.
Edward's Letter
OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT
KENNETH S. PITZER
Dear President Pitzer:
As Chairman of the ASSU
Senate, and in accord with the
sense of that body, I would like to
make the following request: that
you transmit to us your formal
assurance that no student
appointment to any committee of
the university that presently
requires approval of an officer of
the university will be rejected by
that officer for any reason except
binding judicial decisions of
legitimately operating judicial
bodies.
I further would like your
formal assurance that you will
support changes in presently
established procedures which
require two-step approval
processes for student
appointments to university
committees.
Sincerely,
David C. Edwards, Chairman
ASSU Senate
