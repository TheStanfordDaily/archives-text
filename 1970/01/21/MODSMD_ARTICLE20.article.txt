## 
### 
The sentencing of Marc Sapir
for misdemeanor violations in
connection with last year's SRI
demonstrations has been
postponed until Feb. 4 at 1:30
p.m.
Judge William Ingram of
Municipal Court delayed the
sentencing, originally scheduled
for last Wednesday, when Sapir
failed to show up for a meeting
with probation officers.
The 28-year old Medical School
student was convicted of unlawful
assembly and blocking a public
street during the May 16
demonstration by Judge Ingram
on Jan. 5.
Ingram told Sapir in court
Wednesday to report to the
probation department for an
interview. Maximum penalty for
each conviction is six months in
iail and a $500 fine.
