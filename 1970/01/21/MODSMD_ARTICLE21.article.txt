# 'Hill' Suit Continues
## 
### 
The Committee for Green
Foothills law suit against Stanford
and Palo Alto concerning Coyote
Hill focused on two issues
Friday—whether Stanford and
Palo Alto incorrectly subdivided
the area for industrial use, and
whether two city councilmen
violated "conflict of interest
provisions."
The "conflict of interest"
charge stems from the voting of
councilmen Frank Gallagher and
Jack Wheatly. Since Gallagher is a
Stanford employee and Wheatly a
potential contractor in the area,
Green Foothills attorney James
Danaher claims that according to
common law, there was a definite
conflict of interest.
City Attorney James
Hildebrand, however, cited a state
statute's definition of "conflict of
interest," claiming that since the
subdivision was a non-contractual
matter, and since both
councilmen stated their financial
interest in the matter before
voting, there was no violation of
the law.
Judge James B. Scott of Santa
Clara Superior Court took the
case under submission, after
granting the Green Foothills
group 10 days to respond to
demurrers filed by Palo Alto and
Stanford.
The question of possible
improper subdivision concerns
land surrounding Coyote Hill
above Foothill Expressway and
Hillview Avenue in Palo Alto. The
area, after long work, was recently
approved as an area for industrial
development.
The Green Foothills suit is
designed to halt development of
the area.
No indication was made as to
when the final ruling on the case
would be issued.
