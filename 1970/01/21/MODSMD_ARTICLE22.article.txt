# Co-ed Exercises
## 
### 
Harvard President Nathan
Pusey has announced that seniors
of Radcliffe College will join
Harvard College seniors as degree
candidates in the annual
Commencement exercises this
June.
Radcliffe graduates have
received a Harvard degree since
1963, but until this year they
have continued to hold separate
Commencement exercises. The
two schools have recently
initiated plans for closer ties
between the sexually segregated
schools.
