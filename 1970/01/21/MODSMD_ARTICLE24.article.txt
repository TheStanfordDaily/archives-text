# 'Shadow of Heroes' Slated
## 
### 
"Shadow of Heroes," Robert
Ardrey's dramatic account of the
events that led up to the
Hungarian uprising in 1956, will
open a three-week run Feb. 4 in
Memorial Hall.
The Stanford Repertory
Theater production is scheduled
for 14 performances—at 8 p.m.
Feb. 4-7, 11-14, and 18-21, and at
2 p.m. Feb. 7 and 14.
Ardrey, best-known as the
author of "African Genesis" and
"The Territorial Imperative," left
his research into man's beginnings
to document this true story of the
Hungarian people.

Traveling to Vienna, he
interviewed hundreds of refugees
who had fled the Hungarian
capital. Gradually he pieced
together the drama that was to
become "Shadow of Heroes." He
said:
"Many of force and
circumstance and personality had
contributed its share to the
revolutions's explosive mosaic.
But standing above all was the
figure of a woman, Julia Rajk, my
St. Joan of the Iron Curtain."
The play focuses upon the lives
of Julia, her husband, Laszlo
Rajk, a communist underground

leader during World War 11, and
Janos Kadar, a one-time friend of
the Rajks' and currently Premier
of Hungary. The drama begins in
Nazi-occupied Budapest in 1944
and climaxes 12 years later with
the Soviet invasion of the city in
the fall of 1956.
Stephen Jay Book, a third-year
master of fine arts student, is the
director of "Shadow of Heroes."
"Shadow of Heroes" tells an
exciting, contemporary story of
truly epic proportions," says
Book. "It illuminates a situation
with which we should all be
concerned, a country's efforts to
break away from Soviet
domination. The drama's parallel
to the recent situation in
Czechoslovakia is no mere
coincidence."
The role of Laszlo Rajk will be
played by SRT guest artist
Kurtwood Smith, an instructor in
drama at Canada College. Smith,
who received his MFA from
Stanford last year.
Mary Staton Geldard, a lecturer
in the Department of Speech and
Drama at Stanford, will portray
Julia Rajk. Richard Redow, an
SRT acting fellow, will play the
part of Janos Kadar.

"Many of force and
circumstance and personality had
contributed its share to the
revolutions's explosive mosaic.
But standing above all was the
figure of a woman, Julia Rajk, my
St. Joan of the Iron Curtain."
The play focuses upon the lives
of Julia, her husband, Laszlo
Rajk, a communist underground

leader during World War 11, and
Janos Kadar, a one-time friend of
the Rajks' and currently Premier
of Hungary. The drama begins in
Nazi-occupied Budapest in 1944
and climaxes 12 years later with
the Soviet invasion of the city in
the fall of 1956.
Stephen Jay Book, a third-year
master of fine arts student, is the
director of "Shadow of Heroes."
"Shadow of Heroes" tells an
exciting, contemporary story of
truly epic proportions," says
Book. "It illuminates a situation
with which we should all be
concerned, a country's efforts to
break away from Soviet
domination. The drama's parallel
to the recent situation in
Czechoslovakia is no mere
coincidence."
The role of Laszlo Rajk will be
played by SRT guest artist
Kurtwood Smith, an instructor in
drama at Canada College. Smith,
who received his MFA from
Stanford last year.
Mary Staton Geldard, a lecturer
in the Department of Speech and
Drama at Stanford, will portray
Julia Rajk. Richard Redow, an
SRT acting fellow, will play the
part of Janos Kadar.
