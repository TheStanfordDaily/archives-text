## Staving Off Starving 
### CATHY COOPER 
Do you have to think about
cooking, much less to cook? Does
the sight of an expectant pork
chop reduce you to a state
resembling warm jello? Whether
you cook because its your turn,

because its cheaper than eating
real food in a restaurant, because
your husband insists or just to
stave off berri berri, take heart.
I don't promise that after
reading this you'll rival Julia Child
or even like to cook but cooking

just may become less disastrous
and more interesting. Any way,
it's a change from the hamburgers
that you've had for the last three
weeks. (Mom doesn't know that
its acute starvation that brings
you home regularly.)
While it rains, you can dream of
sunshine and eat
OVEN BARBECUED CHICKEN
chicken, as much as you like
1/2 cup (c.) salad oil
2 tablespoons (T.) lemon juice
1/8 t. (teaspoon) Tabasco
1 T. brown sugar
1 t. salt
pepper to taste
1 clove garlic
2 t. mustard
Combine everything and leave
in refrigerator overnight (or all
day or as long as it suits you).
Broil skin side down basting with
sauce for about 10 minutes, turn
and repeat for other side.
Here's what to eat until your
allowance comes, or "How to
serve 3 with 1/2 pound of
hamburger."
STUFFED GREEN PEPPERS
3 large green peppers
1/2 lb. ground beef
18 oz. can tomato sauce
1/2 c. rice, oatmeal, or bread
crumbs
1 t. salt
1/t t. pepper
1 T. chopped onion (instant's
easiest)
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Cut
tops from peppers, remove seeds,
and cook 5 minutes in 1 cup
boiling water and 1 t. salt. Drain.
Mix the rest, stuff peppers and
bake covered 45 minutes, 15
minutes uncovered.
With only slightly more effort
you can serve with Carrot-Raisin
Salad Mix 1 c. grated carrots, 2 t.
raisins and enough mayonaise to
hold it together.
How about a recipe for the
night you're faced with 50 pages
of raw notes for a paper due the
next morning at 8 and dinner to
fix
