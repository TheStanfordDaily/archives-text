## Aquinas at Heart of Medieval Thought 
### CYNTHIA ADAMS 
(Aquinas—A collection oi
Critical Lssays, edited by
Anthony Kenny; Douhleday,
$1.95)
There is much to be gained
from a study of thirteenth
century philosophy, art, and
history, for the period was one of
the most radical turning points for
mankind.
Influenced by the re-discovery
of classical writers, especially
Aristotle, a whole new corps of
thinkers arose who developed
revolutionary concepts of the
universe still valuable today.
Thomas Aquinas was probably
the most influential thinker of the
thirteenth century. His thought is
almost as large and as exhilarating
as life itself, and it is through him
that we can come to a better
understanding of the roots of the
modern era.
To underscore this point, David
Knowles, a contributor to
Anthony Kenny's AQUINAS,
states that "for Aquinas the
universe is something radiating
from and centered upon God,
who is the infinite richness of
being compared to whom all other
beings are shadows." This is the
core of Thomistic thought, and
must be revealed in all its poetic
complexity to the student
embarking on a study of Aquinas.

Anthony Kenny's AQUINAS-A
COLLECTION OF CRITICAL
ESSAYS is a new book and is an
excellent elucidation of Thomistic
thought. The essays range from
historical background to
thorough, though brief, analyses
of many of Aquinas' chief issues
with their modern applications.
Anthony Kenny, the editor,
provides some of the most
absorbing passages in his
outstanding introduction, and in
editorial comments interspersed
throughout. In two fine
essays—"Divine Foreknowledge
and Human Freedom", and
"Intellect and Imagination in
Aquinas", he succeeds in offering
the layman an illuminating,
unprejudiced introduction to
Aquinas and the philosophical
climate of his time.
A second book which I highly
recommend to anyone interested
in the Middle Ages is Henry
Adams' MONT-SAINT MICHEL
ANL) CHARTRES. Although this
book was written in the late
nineteenth century, the author's
devotion for his subject draws the
reader deep into the heart of his
material. The reader is left at the
end with a feeling of delight and
richness that he has had the
privilege to look at the world
through eyes as sensitive as Henry
Adams'.
