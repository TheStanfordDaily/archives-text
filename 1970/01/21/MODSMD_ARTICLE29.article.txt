# 'Inflation' Hits Tickets

### FRED LEESON 
Students who may customarily
watch home swimming meets for
50 cents will have to pay $3 if
they wish to see the Yale-Stanford
confrontation Feb. 7 in Encina
pool.
In fact, everybody has to pay
$3 and all year sport cards will not
be honored.
"The reason for the price
increase is due to a contractual
obligation with Yale," said Ted
Cilarrow, Stanford ticket manager.
"The only way we could get them
out here was to guarantee some
expenses."
Since both teams are among the
strongest in the country, it figures
to be one of the best collegiate
dual meets of the year.
"Normally we don't schedule
that far away," said Athletic
Director Chuck Taylor. "It was
agreed with them that they would
try to help with the gate when we
went back there last year. We
hope to make up part of the
difference."
Yale also charged $3 for the
meet last season when the
home-and-home arrangement was
made.
"I think it is attractive enough
for the public that it would be

worth that amount of money,"
Taylor said.
When it was mentioned that
prices don't change when eastern
basketball teams come to
Stanford, Glarrow said, "the only
difference being that basketball
generates enough income so that
its deficit is not too large."
The athletic office has 1500
tickets for sale, and the remaining
200 of the pool's 1700 capacity
are reserved for Yale.

When asked if students can
expect prices to jump whenever a
top attraction occurs in a "minor"
sport, Glarrow said he couldn't
speak for all occasions but that it
generally didn't happen.
"This is probably a one time
shot," Glarrow concluded. If the
shot is too stiff for some students,
there's a chance they can wait and
read about the meet in Sports
Illustrated, instead.

BELLY FLOP?â€”Not really. Stanford's Ted Miyamoto, a freshman gymnast from Hawaii, has just left the spring board
in vaulting competition last weekend. He did, in fact, land on lus feet, and Stanford gymnasts won their first meet of
the season, downing Sacramento State.
