## China-US Meet In Warsaw 
### 
WARSAW (AP) - With images of
Mao Tse-tung staring down from
two walls, U.S. and Rod Chinese
diplomats resumed formal contact
Tuesday for the first time in two
years in a one-hour talk with
Americans described as "useful."
U.S. Ambassador Walter J.
Stoessel Jr. told newsmen the two
sides had "discussed a number of
matters of mutual interest" as he
emerged from the Red Chinese
Embassy after conferring with
Charge d'Affaires Lei Yang.
But, Stoessel added, in accord
with the ground rules, "our
discussion and the topics we
covered are held in confidence."
The American diplomat said
the exchange was held in a
"business-like atmosphere."
"We are pleased that these talks
have been renewed today," he
said, "and I believe today's
meeting was useful."
The exchanges began in Geneva
in 1955 to discuss release of
Americans held in China. They
moved to Warsaw in 1958 and the
last meeting was held Jan. 8,
1968. The current meeting was

postponed twice by the Chinese,
the last time 11 months ago after
a Chinese diplomat defected in
the Netherlands.
Observers suggested that at the
Tuesday meeting, Stoessel
proposed to Lei that the United
States and China strive for
agreements on telecommunica
tions, trade and exchanges of
scholars and journalists.
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers said over the weekend he
hoped the China talks could lead
to agreements on these subjects
and contribute to easing tension.
Calley
j
FT. BENNING, Ga. (AP) -
Defense attorneys charged
Tuesday that no Army court
could give Lt. William L. Calley
Jr., a fair trial because the
commander-in-chief, President
Nixon, made the decision to
charge him with mass murder at
My Lai.
The decision came down
through the chain of high
command and ultimately was

carried out at Ft. Benning,
attorney George Latimer asserted
at a pretrial hearing on defense
motion. He sought dismissal of
the charges.
The trial judge-Lt. Col. Reid W.
Kennedy-did not act on the
motion itself. He adjourned the
hearing until Feb. 9 when he will
take more evidence on the
"command control" issue.
Kennedy said it would be up to
the prosecution to answer the
defense point that command
control was exercised in charging
Calley in the alleged massacre
which occurred March 16, 1968.
Earlier there had been a
discussion at the start of the
hearing on whether the trial
would be open to the news media.
The judge said Calley had a "right
to a fair and open trial, and the
public and press will not be
excluded unless the defense
requests such."
Kennedy said the hearings
would be open, except if classified
information is to be discussed. No
date has been set for the trial.
Calley was accused of 109
killings at My Lai. But the court,
acting on a defense motion and
with prosecution assent, dropped
two specifications in the charge
reducing the number of 102.
Pollution
MONTEREY (AP) - Raw Sewage
is fouling waters and sands of the
Monterey seacoast to a point
where the county health director
says "shots are a good idea" for

protection against typhoid,
hepatitis and other disease germs.
Dr. Richard S. Fraser,
Monterey County health director,
said that in his nine years on the
job no one has contracted typhoid
at any of the beaches.
But he closed many of the
beaches from south of Carmel
north to Ft. Ord last September
because of raw sewage pollution
and the possibility of disease. He
said Monday he saw no chance of
lifting the quarantine in the near
future.
Viewing the pollution with
more alarm was Lloyd Austin,
University of California marine
biologist, who said there is
"extreme danger" in just playing
in the coastal sands.
"It's a shame that kids making
sand castles on the beach might
get typhoid," said Austin. "It's
terrible to think about, but it's a
possibility now."
Austin is diving control officer
for UC marine biology students
who are required to get typhoid
and hepatitis innoculations before
exploring the bottom of Monterey
Bay.
That bay bottom once was
covered with giant sea urchins,
Austin noted, but pollution has
driven all of them away.
Rep. John V. Tunney of
Riverside, Calif., seeking the
Democratic nomination for U.S.
Senate, said here last weekend the
federal government should lead
the way to ending the Monterey
Bay pollution by cleaning up one
major source of it • the Army's Ft.
Ord.

says "shots are a good idea" for

protection against typhoid,
hepatitis and other disease germs.
Dr. Richard S. Fraser,
Monterey County health director,
said that in his nine years on the
job no one has contracted typhoid
at any of the beaches.
But he closed many of the
beaches from south of Carmel
north to Ft. Ord last September
because of raw sewage pollution
and the possibility of disease. He
said Monday he saw no chance of
lifting the quarantine in the near
future.
Viewing the pollution with
more alarm was Lloyd Austin,
University of California marine
biologist, who said there is
"extreme danger" in just playing
in the coastal sands.
"It's a shame that kids making
sand castles on the beach might
get typhoid," said Austin. "It's
terrible to think about, but it's a
possibility now."
Austin is diving control officer
for UC marine biology students
who are required to get typhoid
and hepatitis innoculations before
exploring the bottom of Monterey
Bay.
That bay bottom once was
covered with giant sea urchins,
Austin noted, but pollution has
driven all of them away.
Rep. John V. Tunney of
Riverside, Calif., seeking the
Democratic nomination for U.S.
Senate, said here last weekend the
federal government should lead
the way to ending the Monterey
Bay pollution by cleaning up one
major source of it • the Army's Ft.
Ord.
WARSAW (AP) - With images of
Mao Tse-tung staring down from
two walls, U.S. and Rod Chinese
diplomats resumed formal contact
Tuesday for the first time in two
years in a one-hour talk with
Americans described as "useful."
U.S. Ambassador Walter J.
Stoessel Jr. told newsmen the two
sides had "discussed a number of
matters of mutual interest" as he
emerged from the Red Chinese
Embassy after conferring with
Charge d'Affaires Lei Yang.
But, Stoessel added, in accord
with the ground rules, "our
discussion and the topics we
covered are held in confidence."
The American diplomat said
the exchange was held in a
"business-like atmosphere."
"We are pleased that these talks
have been renewed today," he
said, "and I believe today's
meeting was useful."
The exchanges began in Geneva
in 1955 to discuss release of
Americans held in China. They
moved to Warsaw in 1958 and the
last meeting was held Jan. 8,
1968. The current meeting was

postponed twice by the Chinese,
the last time 11 months ago after
a Chinese diplomat defected in
the Netherlands.
Observers suggested that at the
Tuesday meeting, Stoessel
proposed to Lei that the United
States and China strive for
agreements on telecommunica
tions, trade and exchanges of
scholars and journalists.
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers said over the weekend he
hoped the China talks could lead
to agreements on these subjects
and contribute to easing tension.
Calley

FT. BENNING, Ga. (AP) -
Defense attorneys charged
Tuesday that no Army court
could give Lt. William L. Calley
Jr., a fair trial because the
commander-in-chief, President
Nixon, made the decision to
charge him with mass murder at
My Lai.
The decision came down
through the chain of high
command and ultimately was

carried out at Ft. Benning,
attorney George Latimer asserted
at a pretrial hearing on defense
motion. He sought dismissal of
the charges.
The trial judge-Lt. Col. Reid W.
Kennedy-did not act on the
motion itself. He adjourned the
hearing until Feb. 9 when he will
take more evidence on the
"command control" issue.
Kennedy said it would be up to
the prosecution to answer the
defense point that command
control was exercised in charging
Calley in the alleged massacre
which occurred March 16, 1968.
Earlier there had been a
discussion at the start of the
hearing on whether the trial
would be open to the news media.
The judge said Calley had a "right
to a fair and open trial, and the
public and press will not be
excluded unless the defense
requests such."
Kennedy said the hearings
would be open, except if classified
information is to be discussed. No
date has been set for the trial.
Calley was accused of 109
killings at My Lai. But the court,
acting on a defense motion and
with prosecution assent, dropped
two specifications in the charge
reducing the number of 102.

command and ultimately was

carried out at Ft. Benning,
attorney George Latimer asserted
at a pretrial hearing on defense
motion. He sought dismissal of
the charges.
The trial judge-Lt. Col. Reid W.
Kennedy-did not act on the
motion itself. He adjourned the
hearing until Feb. 9 when he will
take more evidence on the
"command control" issue.
Kennedy said it would be up to
the prosecution to answer the
defense point that command
control was exercised in charging
Calley in the alleged massacre
which occurred March 16, 1968.
Earlier there had been a
discussion at the start of the
hearing on whether the trial
would be open to the news media.
The judge said Calley had a "right
to a fair and open trial, and the
public and press will not be
excluded unless the defense
requests such."
Kennedy said the hearings
would be open, except if classified
information is to be discussed. No
date has been set for the trial.
Calley was accused of 109
killings at My Lai. But the court,
acting on a defense motion and
with prosecution assent, dropped
two specifications in the charge
reducing the number of 102.
Pollution
MONTEREY (AP) - Raw Sewage
is fouling waters and sands of the
Monterey seacoast to a point
where the county health director
says "shots are a good idea" for

protection against typhoid,
hepatitis and other disease germs.
Dr. Richard S. Fraser,
Monterey County health director,
said that in his nine years on the
job no one has contracted typhoid
at any of the beaches.
But he closed many of the
beaches from south of Carmel
north to Ft. Ord last September
because of raw sewage pollution
and the possibility of disease. He
said Monday he saw no chance of
lifting the quarantine in the near
future.
Viewing the pollution with
more alarm was Lloyd Austin,
University of California marine
biologist, who said there is
"extreme danger" in just playing
in the coastal sands.
"It's a shame that kids making
sand castles on the beach might
get typhoid," said Austin. "It's
terrible to think about, but it's a
possibility now."
Austin is diving control officer
for UC marine biology students
who are required to get typhoid
and hepatitis innoculations before
exploring the bottom of Monterey
Bay.
That bay bottom once was
covered with giant sea urchins,
Austin noted, but pollution has
driven all of them away.
Rep. John V. Tunney of
Riverside, Calif., seeking the
Democratic nomination for U.S.
Senate, said here last weekend the
federal government should lead
the way to ending the Monterey
Bay pollution by cleaning up one
major source of it • the Army's Ft.
Ord.
