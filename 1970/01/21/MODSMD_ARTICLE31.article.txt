# Matmen Celebrate Best Start In Years
## 
### 
Stanford's wrestling team ran
its record to 5-0 Saturday night
with a pair of victories over Cal
State Hayward and the University
of Nevada. The matmen had little
difficulty downing CSH 25-11 and
Nevada 33-9.
Leading the way for the Indians
was co-captain Terry Crenshaw
who picked up his fifth straight
victory, three of which have been
on pins. Dave Kipolow (118),
Dave Thomas (142) and Ray
Williams (190) also kept their
records unblemished.
Sophomore heavyweight Lee
Fair from Long Beach also looked
impressive as he picked up two
wins this weekend. Fair won his
match against CSH by a fall and
he decisioned a tough Nevada
heavyweight in his second match
The Indians are off to their best
start in many years, and they will
try to extend their winning streak
this Saturday night against

University of California at Santa
Barbara. The meet will start at
7:30 in the rejuvenated Old
Pavilion.
