## The 						Yale Case-1 
### John Arthur 
Acting with characteristic misdirection, the
National Collegiate Athletic Association last week
discharged all barrels of its amassed punitive
weaponry at Yale University. Yale, you'll
remember, has dared defy those Lord High Priests
of collegiate sportdom by using a player who
participated in an event not sanctioned by the
NCAA.
For incurring the wrath of governing body of
college athletics, Yale was dealt the extraordinary
penalty of a two-year probation in all sports. This
means that no Eli teams or athletes may
participate in NCAA championships or any other
postseason play for that period. In addition, Yale
teams were banned from all appearances on
national television programs or series administered
by the NCAA. Furthermore, the NCAA Council
said that Yale's athletic policies and practices
would be reviewed by its committee on infractions
before the probation expires, thus implying that
the Elis would be penalized again if they
continued to use the player in question.
What is responsible for this drastic punishment?
Complex Case
The case is complex, but can best be understood
when viewed from three perspectives. The first
concerns the incident itself. Yale gave a player
permission to participate in an extra-season event
not sanctioned by the NCAA. The second relates
to Yale's subsequent action, as well as earlier
disputes between the Ivy League and the NCAA.
Yale has openly flaunted the authority of the
NCAA by continuing to use the player. The third
viewpoint takes in the long, bitter civil war in
American amateur athletics between the NCAA
and the Amateur Athletic Union. The event in
question was apparently not sanctioned by the
NCAA simply because it was run by the AAU.
The case, and the harsh NCAA penalty, also
raise some important questions about amateur
sport in the U.S. For instance, are the goals of
amateur athletics being best served by the
elaborate operating procedures of the NCAA? If
they're not, what are the advantages and
disadvantages of NCAA membership? Why is Yale
in such hot water as a result of its actions? And
how do athletic administrators and coaches at
Stanford feel about the situation?
Situation Reviewed
For those who came in late, here's a brief review
of the incident: Nearly a year ago, in March, Jack
Langer, a 6'B" reserve center on Yale's basketball
team, was invited to try out for the United States
Maccabiah Games team. He did so and in July was
informed that he'd made the team. But before
going to Tel Aviv, Israel, for the games, Langer
received formal permission to participate from
Yale's athletic director DeLaney Kiphuth. In
giving permission Kiphuth made it clear that
should there be any repercussions of Langer's
playing, Yale would take all responsibility.
Kiphuth, in fact, knew that there would be
repercussions, perhaps serious ones. More on that
later.
In any event, Langer, a Jew, went to the games

and was the only collegian to play on the U.S.
team, which lost in the final to Israel. But when he
returned to school in September, Langer learned
that the Eastern College Athletic Association, of
which ale is a member, had declared him
ineligible. Nevertheless, after getting full support
from all Yale team captains and managers as well
as the administration, Langer again went out for
basketball, made the team, and is playing for Yale
right now.
What is the ECAC and why did it declare Langer
ineligible?
Like the Pacific-8, the Big Ten and a host of
other conferences, the ECAC is an Allied member
of the NCAA. It is an association of 172 schools,
most of which are also NCAA members. In effect,
it's a regional arm of the NCAA. Both the NCAA
and the ECAC regularly prohibit off-season play
for all basketball players, under a rule enacted
after 1960 when a point-shaving scandal revealed
that most contacts between athletes and gamblers
occurred at summer resorts, where many collegians
played in special basketball leagues.
Exceptions Made
Yet exceptions to this rule have been made
regularly, under an article in the NCAA bylaws set
up specifically for that purpose. Typical
exceptions are the Olympic Games and the Pan
American games. But in 1967, when the AAU
gained control of U.S. participation in the
Maccabiah Games, the NCAA changed its tune,
deciding that exceptions would only be made for
the Olympics. The ECAC, which follows the
association's orders on sanctions, consequently felt
justified in ruling Langer ineligible.
Yale has taken several positions: It has asserted
that the matter is one of religious freedom. It has
attacked the NCAA for using athletes as pawns in
the power struggle with the AAU. And it has
remained firm in its decision to continue to play
Langer. Tomorrow: The reasoning behind the
NCAA s harsh penalty and the reaction at
Stanford.

justified in ruling Langer ineligible.
Yale has taken several positions: It has asserted
that the matter is one of religious freedom. It has
attacked the NCAA for using athletes as pawns in
the power struggle with the AAU. And it has
remained firm in its decision to continue to play
Langer. Tomorrow: The reasoning behind the
NCAA s harsh penalty and the reaction at
Stanford.
Acting with characteristic misdirection, the
National Collegiate Athletic Association last week
discharged all barrels of its amassed punitive
weaponry at Yale University. Yale, you'll
remember, has dared defy those Lord High Priests
of collegiate sportdom by using a player who
participated in an event not sanctioned by the
NCAA.
For incurring the wrath of governing body of
college athletics, Yale was dealt the extraordinary
penalty of a two-year probation in all sports. This
means that no Eli teams or athletes may
participate in NCAA championships or any other
postseason play for that period. In addition, Yale
teams were banned from all appearances on
national television programs or series administered
by the NCAA. Furthermore, the NCAA Council
said that Yale's athletic policies and practices
would be reviewed by its committee on infractions
before the probation expires, thus implying that
the Elis would be penalized again if they
continued to use the player in question.
What is responsible for this drastic punishment?
Complex Case
The case is complex, but can best be understood
when viewed from three perspectives. The first
concerns the incident itself. Yale gave a player
permission to participate in an extra-season event
not sanctioned by the NCAA. The second relates
to Yale's subsequent action, as well as earlier
disputes between the Ivy League and the NCAA.
Yale has openly flaunted the authority of the
NCAA by continuing to use the player. The third
viewpoint takes in the long, bitter civil war in
American amateur athletics between the NCAA
and the Amateur Athletic Union. The event in
question was apparently not sanctioned by the
NCAA simply because it was run by the AAU.
The case, and the harsh NCAA penalty, also
raise some important questions about amateur
sport in the U.S. For instance, are the goals of
amateur athletics being best served by the
elaborate operating procedures of the NCAA? If
they're not, what are the advantages and
disadvantages of NCAA membership? Why is Yale
in such hot water as a result of its actions? And
how do athletic administrators and coaches at
Stanford feel about the situation?
Situation Reviewed
For those who came in late, here's a brief review
of the incident: Nearly a year ago, in March, Jack
Langer, a 6'B" reserve center on Yale's basketball
team, was invited to try out for the United States
Maccabiah Games team. He did so and in July was
informed that he'd made the team. But before
going to Tel Aviv, Israel, for the games, Langer
received formal permission to participate from
Yale's athletic director DeLaney Kiphuth. In
giving permission Kiphuth made it clear that
should there be any repercussions of Langer's
playing, Yale would take all responsibility.
Kiphuth, in fact, knew that there would be
repercussions, perhaps serious ones. More on that
later.
In any event, Langer, a Jew, went to the games

and was the only collegian to play on the U.S.
team, which lost in the final to Israel. But when he
returned to school in September, Langer learned
that the Eastern College Athletic Association, of
which ale is a member, had declared him
ineligible. Nevertheless, after getting full support
from all Yale team captains and managers as well
as the administration, Langer again went out for
basketball, made the team, and is playing for Yale
right now.
What is the ECAC and why did it declare Langer
ineligible?
Like the Pacific-8, the Big Ten and a host of
other conferences, the ECAC is an Allied member
of the NCAA. It is an association of 172 schools,
most of which are also NCAA members. In effect,
it's a regional arm of the NCAA. Both the NCAA
and the ECAC regularly prohibit off-season play
for all basketball players, under a rule enacted
after 1960 when a point-shaving scandal revealed
that most contacts between athletes and gamblers
occurred at summer resorts, where many collegians
played in special basketball leagues.
Exceptions Made
Yet exceptions to this rule have been made
regularly, under an article in the NCAA bylaws set
up specifically for that purpose. Typical
exceptions are the Olympic Games and the Pan
American games. But in 1967, when the AAU
gained control of U.S. participation in the
Maccabiah Games, the NCAA changed its tune,
deciding that exceptions would only be made for
the Olympics. The ECAC, which follows the
association's orders on sanctions, consequently felt
justified in ruling Langer ineligible.

up specifically for that purpose. Typical
exceptions are the Olympic Games and the Pan
American games. But in 1967, when the AAU
gained control of U.S. participation in the
Maccabiah Games, the NCAA changed its tune,
deciding that exceptions would only be made for
the Olympics. The ECAC, which follows the
association's orders on sanctions, consequently felt
justified in ruling Langer ineligible.
Yale has taken several positions: It has asserted
that the matter is one of religious freedom. It has
attacked the NCAA for using athletes as pawns in
the power struggle with the AAU. And it has
remained firm in its decision to continue to play
Langer. Tomorrow: The reasoning behind the
NCAA s harsh penalty and the reaction at
Stanford.
