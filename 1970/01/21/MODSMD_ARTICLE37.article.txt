### 
A two-day conference on
the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) report,
involving students, faculty and
administrators, will be held this
weekend.
Discussions among the more
than 60 persons invited will
"touch on the history of SES
and its reports to date and,
equally if not more
importantly, what should and
can be done with its
recommendations now and in
the immediate future."
Walter P. Metzger, Professor
of History at Columbia
University, will address the
conference Saturday morning.
He will discuss the
philosophical and practical
aspects of educational reform,
comparing Stanford's
experiences with those of other
universities.
The event will be held at the
Asilomar conference grounds
in Pacific Grove.
Among those invited to the
session, sponsored by the
ASSU and to be held from
Friday evening through
Saturday afternoon, are
President Kenneth Pitzer, Dean
of Students Peter Bulkeley and
SES chairman Herbert Packer.
The attendence list includes
student, faculty, and staff
leaders.
