# Dissatisfaction Brewing Over ROTC Proposal
## 
### 
The faculty Senate is moving
toward a vote tomorrow
afternoon on President Kenneth
Pitzer's request that ROTC
courses continue to be eligible for
academic credit under a modified
system.
Some strong dissenting
opinions were voiced, however, in
a Daily survey of faculty and
student reactions. Several faculty
asserted that the Senate was being
asked to act too quickly, and
others complained that Pitzer was
pressing for a reversal of decisions
last year by the Senate and
Academic Council to bar credit
for military courses starting this
September.
An "emergency" meeting was
called for tonight by three
political groups to discuss the
ROTC issue (see box).
Pitzer's request, which endorses
the January 12 majority report of
his Advisory Committee on ROTC
affairs, would replace ROTC
departments with a "Center for
Military Studies," whose staff
would have full faculty privileges
except for voting rights on the
Academic Council. Instead of
blanket authorization for course
credit, each military course would
have to gain approval from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
No Change For Navy?
Navy ROTC indicated Monday
that it expects to get as many
units of credit for its program
under Pitzer's new plan as at
present.

"I strongly urge favorable
Senate consideration," Pitzer
wrote to the Senate steering
committee in a letter distributed
to Senate members two days ago.
One Senate member, computer
science professor Jerome
Feldman, commented that "I am
not in favor of the proposal. We
should not be asked to act on it
on such short notice."
"The Senate should adjourn
Thursday without voting on the
issue," said Prof. Martin Carnoy, a
leader of the Stanford Vietnam
Moratorium committee. "It has to
be discussed by the University
community."
t
Clebsch Denies 'Pressure'
Senate chairman Prof. William
Clebsch denied that the Senate
was being pressured into a quick
decision. "Those who would
impute adamacy to President
Pitzer completely misread his
statements," Clebsch told the
Daily. Clebsch said that "I am
personally a life-long pascifist, and
I think the government would be
better off out of the ROTC
business," but he said he wanted
to hear the Senate debate
tomorrow before giving an
opinion on Pitzer's request.
Senate steering committee
member Prof. Merrill Carlsmith
disputed the contention that the
Senate was being asked to reverse
an earlier stand. "It's a question
of interpretation," he said. "I'm
pleased that President Pitzer has
stated his position and I don't
think it's an undue kind of
pressure."
Already Decided?
Harold Kahn, associate
professor of history, commented,
"I deplore that the Senate is being
asked once more to decide an
issue that it decided firmly and
after careful study last year. If
Pitzer wins, those who feel that
the administration is interposing
itself between curriculum and
faculty will have no recourse but
to get 50 signatures on a petition
and appeal to the entire Academic
Council."
In his letter, Pitzer argued that
"It is a matter of considerable
University interest that a
reasonable compromise between
the military services and the
academic community be reached.
There are substantial numbers in
the faculty and in the student
body who wish to see ROTC
continued in some form, with
some degree of academic credit, in

ways that do not do violence to
academic standards."
Six of the eight members of the
ROTC advisory committee
support the plan. A vigorous
dissent came from Prof. Alan S.
Manne, the committee chairman,
and Prof. Lyman P. Van Slyke.
Manne and Van Slyke noted
that the faculty Senate voted last
February 13 to phase out any
academic credit for military
training. "This faculty action
permitted the retention of ROTC
as a non-credit extracurricular
activity available to our students.
The Department of Defense has
shown no willingness to negotiate
a non-credit program
here . . .Stanford is being asked to
adopt the DOD's position, and
thereby to reverse last spring's
faculty decision. This makes the
issue no longer one of ROTC
alone, but also one of university
governance," they wrote Pitzer.
"It looks at first glance like an
attempt on the part of the
University to yield to pressure
exerted by reactionary
Congressmen who threatened to
cut off funds to universities that
don't abide by their conception of
ROTC. But I want to have a
chance to look at it more
carefully," said Senate member
Feldman.
A Student Comment
An angry student opinion came
from John Shoch, deputy
chairman of the ASSU Senate.
"It's just like the SRI decision.
The University is pushing through
executive decisions without
meaningful consultation of the
Stanford community. There has
been no realistic measure of
student opinion at all.
"There was one student
referendum a year ago," said
Shoch, "but it attracted little
student attention and was worded
in a manner that made the results
meaningless. It's clear that the
ASSU Senate and other groups
must have an opportunity to give
their views on Pitzer's proposal."

Pitzer's request, which endorses
the January 12 majority report of
his Advisory Committee on ROTC
affairs, would replace ROTC
departments with a "Center for
Military Studies," whose staff
would have full faculty privileges
except for voting rights on the
Academic Council. Instead of
blanket authorization for course
credit, each military course would
have to gain approval from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
No Change For Navy?
Navy ROTC indicated Monday
that it expects to get as many
units of credit for its program
under Pitzer's new plan as at
present.

"I strongly urge favorable
Senate consideration," Pitzer
wrote to the Senate steering
committee in a letter distributed
to Senate members two days ago.
One Senate member, computer
science professor Jerome
Feldman, commented that "I am
not in favor of the proposal. We
should not be asked to act on it
on such short notice."
"The Senate should adjourn
Thursday without voting on the
issue," said Prof. Martin Carnoy, a
leader of the Stanford Vietnam
Moratorium committee. "It has to
be discussed by the University
community."
t
Clebsch Denies 'Pressure'
Senate chairman Prof. William
Clebsch denied that the Senate
was being pressured into a quick
decision. "Those who would
impute adamacy to President
Pitzer completely misread his
statements," Clebsch told the
Daily. Clebsch said that "I am
personally a life-long pascifist, and
I think the government would be
better off out of the ROTC
business," but he said he wanted
to hear the Senate debate
tomorrow before giving an
opinion on Pitzer's request.
Senate steering committee
member Prof. Merrill Carlsmith
disputed the contention that the
Senate was being asked to reverse
an earlier stand. "It's a question
of interpretation," he said. "I'm
pleased that President Pitzer has
stated his position and I don't
think it's an undue kind of
pressure."
Already Decided?
Harold Kahn, associate
professor of history, commented,
"I deplore that the Senate is being
asked once more to decide an
issue that it decided firmly and
after careful study last year. If
Pitzer wins, those who feel that
the administration is interposing
itself between curriculum and
faculty will have no recourse but
to get 50 signatures on a petition
and appeal to the entire Academic
Council."
In his letter, Pitzer argued that
"It is a matter of considerable
University interest that a
reasonable compromise between
the military services and the
academic community be reached.
There are substantial numbers in
the faculty and in the student
body who wish to see ROTC
continued in some form, with
some degree of academic credit, in

ways that do not do violence to
academic standards."
Six of the eight members of the
ROTC advisory committee
support the plan. A vigorous
dissent came from Prof. Alan S.
Manne, the committee chairman,
and Prof. Lyman P. Van Slyke.
Manne and Van Slyke noted
that the faculty Senate voted last
February 13 to phase out any
academic credit for military
training. "This faculty action
permitted the retention of ROTC
as a non-credit extracurricular
activity available to our students.
The Department of Defense has
shown no willingness to negotiate
a non-credit program
here . . .Stanford is being asked to
adopt the DOD's position, and
thereby to reverse last spring's
faculty decision. This makes the
issue no longer one of ROTC
alone, but also one of university
governance," they wrote Pitzer.
"It looks at first glance like an
attempt on the part of the
University to yield to pressure
exerted by reactionary
Congressmen who threatened to
cut off funds to universities that
don't abide by their conception of
ROTC. But I want to have a
chance to look at it more
carefully," said Senate member
Feldman.
A Student Comment
An angry student opinion came
from John Shoch, deputy
chairman of the ASSU Senate.
"It's just like the SRI decision.
The University is pushing through
executive decisions without
meaningful consultation of the
Stanford community. There has
been no realistic measure of
student opinion at all.
"There was one student
referendum a year ago," said
Shoch, "but it attracted little
student attention and was worded
in a manner that made the results
meaningless. It's clear that the
ASSU Senate and other groups
must have an opportunity to give
their views on Pitzer's proposal."
The faculty Senate is moving
toward a vote tomorrow
afternoon on President Kenneth
Pitzer's request that ROTC
courses continue to be eligible for
academic credit under a modified
system.
Some strong dissenting
opinions were voiced, however, in
a Daily survey of faculty and
student reactions. Several faculty
asserted that the Senate was being
asked to act too quickly, and
others complained that Pitzer was
pressing for a reversal of decisions
last year by the Senate and
Academic Council to bar credit
for military courses starting this
September.
An "emergency" meeting was
called for tonight by three

wrote to the Senate steering
committee in a letter distributed
to Senate members two days ago.
One Senate member, computer
science professor Jerome
Feldman, commented that "I am
not in favor of the proposal. We
should not be asked to act on it
on such short notice."
"The Senate should adjourn
Thursday without voting on the
issue," said Prof. Martin Carnoy, a
leader of the Stanford Vietnam
Moratorium committee. "It has to
be discussed by the University
community."

Clebsch Denies 'Pressure'
Senate chairman Prof. William
Clebsch denied that the Senate
was being pressured into a quick
decision. "Those who would
impute adamacy to President
Pitzer completely misread his
statements," Clebsch told the
Daily. Clebsch said that "I am
personally a life-long pascifist, and
I think the government would be
better off out of the ROTC
business," but he said he wanted
to hear the Senate debate
tomorrow before giving an
opinion on Pitzer's request.
Senate steering committee
member Prof. Merrill Carlsmith
disputed the contention that the
Senate was being asked to reverse
an earlier stand. "It's a question
of interpretation," he said. "I'm
pleased that President Pitzer has
stated his position and I don't
think it's an undue kind of
pressure."
Already Decided?
Harold Kahn, associate
professor of history, commented,
"I deplore that the Senate is being
asked once more to decide an
issue that it decided firmly and
after careful study last year. If
Pitzer wins, those who feel that
the administration is interposing
itself between curriculum and
faculty will have no recourse but
to get 50 signatures on a petition
and appeal to the entire Academic
Council."
In his letter, Pitzer argued that
"It is a matter of considerable
University interest that a
reasonable compromise between
the military services and the
academic community be reached.
There are substantial numbers in
the faculty and in the student
body who wish to see ROTC
continued in some form, with
some degree of academic credit, in

ways that do not do violence to
academic standards."
Six of the eight members of the
ROTC advisory committee
support the plan. A vigorous
dissent came from Prof. Alan S.
Manne, the committee chairman,
and Prof. Lyman P. Van Slyke.
Manne and Van Slyke noted
that the faculty Senate voted last
February 13 to phase out any
academic credit for military
training. "This faculty action
permitted the retention of ROTC
as a non-credit extracurricular
activity available to our students.
The Department of Defense has
shown no willingness to negotiate
a non-credit program
here . . .Stanford is being asked to
adopt the DOD's position, and
thereby to reverse last spring's
faculty decision. This makes the
issue no longer one of ROTC
alone, but also one of university
governance," they wrote Pitzer.
"It looks at first glance like an
attempt on the part of the
University to yield to pressure
exerted by reactionary
Congressmen who threatened to
cut off funds to universities that
don't abide by their conception of
ROTC. But I want to have a
chance to look at it more
carefully," said Senate member
Feldman.
A Student Comment
An angry student opinion came
from John Shoch, deputy
chairman of the ASSU Senate.
"It's just like the SRI decision.
The University is pushing through
executive decisions without
meaningful consultation of the
Stanford community. There has
been no realistic measure of
student opinion at all.
"There was one student
referendum a year ago," said
Shoch, "but it attracted little
student attention and was worded
in a manner that made the results
meaningless. It's clear that the
ASSU Senate and other groups
must have an opportunity to give
their views on Pitzer's proposal."
The faculty Senate is moving
toward a vote tomorrow
afternoon on President Kenneth
Pitzer's request that ROTC
courses continue to be eligible for
academic credit under a modified
system.
Some strong dissenting
opinions were voiced, however, in
a Daily survey of faculty and
student reactions. Several faculty
asserted that the Senate was being
asked to act too quickly, and
others complained that Pitzer was
pressing for a reversal of decisions
last year by the Senate and
Academic Council to bar credit
for military courses starting this
September.
An "emergency" meeting was
called for tonight by three
political groups to discuss the
ROTC issue (see box).
Pitzer's request, which endorses
the January 12 majority report of
his Advisory Committee on ROTC
affairs, would replace ROTC
departments with a "Center for
Military Studies," whose staff
would have full faculty privileges
except for voting rights on the
Academic Council. Instead of
blanket authorization for course
credit, each military course would
have to gain approval from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
No Change For Navy?
Navy ROTC indicated Monday
that it expects to get as many
units of credit for its program
under Pitzer's new plan as at
present.

Senate consideration," Pitzer
wrote to the Senate steering
committee in a letter distributed
