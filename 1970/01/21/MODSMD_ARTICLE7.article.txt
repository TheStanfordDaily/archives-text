# Sex Role Panelist Compares Women To Black Minority
## 
### JANE CORRIGAN 
Kicking off a series of four discussions on
careers for women, a panel debated women's right
to equal opportunity last night.
In a brief presentation, Dr. Carl Degler, a
member of the panel and a professor of history,
compared the current position of women in
society with that of the black minority. He said
both groups lack power. Other points of similarity
mentioned were that both minorities are
immediately identifiable, that both have been
discriminated against educationally, politically and
economically. Traditionally both groups have been
beloved in their place, he added.
"We ought to start on the assumption that
women are human beings first and women second.
We ought to provide equal opportunities for
women to lead the kind of lives they want,"
Degler said.
Another panel member, Marg Lozoff, Research
Associate with the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems, spoke first of the need for
women to get together and discuss their problems.
She cited the psychological difficulties
encountered bv women as they move into higher

and higher positions in "a man's world,"
difficulties which are the result of a conflict
between woman's traditional role and her actual
competencies and ambitions. Mrs. Losoff
suggested several ways in which this conflict can
be eliminated—such as the help of new
developments in birth control.
Mrs. Lozoff added that women should also
develop confidence and the belief that it is all right
for them to utilize fully their brains and abilities.
Lastly, women must work to reconcile and bring
into balance both their dependency needs and
their desire to have a career outside the home.
Ruth Schneider, the last speaker, presented a
practical side of the picture, dealing with
placement opportunities. She stressed the need for
the individual woman to plan ahead for a career,
starting early in investigating the education
requirements and job openings in her particular
field of interest.
The panel was moderated by Sandy Richards, a
resident assistant at Hoskins House.
Three more panels will be lifld, dealing with
career', for women in community service, the
professional world iid business.
