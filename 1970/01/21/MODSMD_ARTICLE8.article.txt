# From A 'Left Wing Extremist'
## 'Liberal' Americans: There Is The Rub 
### Marc Sapir 
A pall of doom lies heavy over
Stanford. What political
animation there is, betrays a
mood of snobish defeatism and
political hopelessness and there is
a growing and continuing
anti-working class and
anti-communist sentiment.
The role of the Stanford Daily
in helping to confuse people
about reality, consistent with the
role of mass media in general in
the U.S., only adds to the
problem. The Daily, like the
general press, has sometimes
amusingly portrayed political
conflict as a struggle between the
left and right-wing extremists.
Perhaps it behooves me to point
out that only the left and right
wings have understood that the
Daily is an aspect of American
liberalism.
Both historically and at the
present time, throughout the
country, the area, or Stanford,
liberalism represents the political
ideology of the most pragmatic
wing of the ruling class in a
decaying class society. It does not
represent the forces of progress or
moral concern.
Ken Pit/.er: "Liberal"
No one can coubt, for example,
that Ken Pitzer is indeed a liberal.
But how Pitzer functions as an
important national leader in the
go vern men t-academic-industrial
network or how he helps
coordinate Third World
development and counter
insurgency programs for
government and business is the
political question which clarifies
the basic opportunism underlying
the liberal ideology of reform.
The unqualified support that the
Daily has given Stanford's and
Pitzer's stand on BYU
demonstrates how easily the
media creates a reality which
doesn't exist, i.e. that liberalism is
based upon a moral concern
leading to corrective remedies.
Quite likely, the black colony
in America will not be confused
by media headlines declaring that
Stanford is now on the side of
racial, cultural, and class equality.
Certainly Stanford workers, black
or otherwise, who are prevented
from unionizing for reasonable
wages and working conditions by
university intimidation will not
think of Stanford as beneficent.
Recent layoffs for "lack of
finances" and firings of politically
active workers only highlight the
picture. Perhaps Pitzer should
reduce his salary to that of other
Stanford workers with only one
year of experience and rehire
some of the people at the press or
the physical plant.
But the point to be made is not
that Pitzer is an enemy of
humanity, but that the Daily as
most aspects of Stanford also
represents that phoney moralistic
opportunism which provides a
rationale for continued
exploitation of human beings
under U.S. capitalism and its
foreign conquests. Not unlike
ruthless elements of the ruling
class represented by Alioto,
Reagan, Agnew or Nixon, the
Daily can one day support and
rationalize the behavior of the
April 3rd Movement as morally
good because that movement is
widespread and powerful, yet
some other day condemn the
"violence" of "leftists". This is as
if to say that the fundamental
political conflict today is between
the forces of violence and
non-violence rather than between
the majority classes and the small
class of rulers and owners of
American corporate monopoly in
the U.S. and Third World. This is
nothing new. Historically, liberal
aspects of every crumbling
political structure have put up
such bogus issues to confuse the
people.
Daily Distortion
Let me take a concrete example

of the Daily's unconscious liberal
distortion of reality. Last quarter
the Daily produced an article
about the People's Medical Center
which a group of us are setting up.
The Daily's version was that a
group of altruistic young Stanford
Drs. dedicated to the youth of the
peninsula was setting up a free
clinic upen to all. This flew in the
face of fact, since the clinic is not
Stanford based publicly dedicated
to serving: 1) working class
people—black, chicano, white 2)
young people—drop outs, political
organizers, communal folk 3)
middle class families who have

had enough of the bullshit
professionalism and exploitation
of American medicine. The clinic
will include primarily
comprehensive family care,
supplemented by educational
programs dedicated to attacks on
existing medical practice and
institutions, political organizing,
and health education and
preventive health. The clinic will
be free for some people but not
for most Stanford students, or
faculty who could afford to pay
and whose money will help keep
us open. The clinic will be a
full-time operation.

A follow up letter to the Daily
criticizing their coverage was
submitted but refused, not, I am
sure, because the Daily was
malicious but because it was
unwilling to elevate the clinic
beyond the level of a vague, one
dimensional, liberal reform
program. If the clinic becomes
powerful, the Dail> will be there
like the rest of the media to again
distort, exploit and digest the
PMC from some new perspective.
The point, my friends is this:
look deeply, analyze the real
world not on paper but on the
basis of experience in the real

world. Since Stanford College is
not the real world this presents a
problem. Nevertheless, everyone
must face the value judgements
that stand before them in this
country and this world. Or as one
brother once said, "you've got to
decide whether you're part of the
problem or part of the solution."
To black Americans and most of
the brothers in the Third World, a
non-violent middle-class liberal
with vested interest undoubtedly
looks like part of the problem.

and whose money will help keep
us open. The clinic will be a
full-time operation.

A follow up letter to the Daily
criticizing their coverage was
submitted but refused, not, I am
sure, because the Daily was
malicious but because it was
unwilling to elevate the clinic
beyond the level of a vague, one
dimensional, liberal reform
program. If the clinic becomes
powerful, the Dail> will be there
like the rest of the media to again
distort, exploit and digest the
PMC from some new perspective.
The point, my friends is this:
look deeply, analyze the real
world not on paper but on the
basis of experience in the real

world. Since Stanford College is
not the real world this presents a
problem. Nevertheless, everyone
must face the value judgements
that stand before them in this
country and this world. Or as one
brother once said, "you've got to
decide whether you're part of the
problem or part of the solution."
To black Americans and most of
the brothers in the Third World, a
non-violent middle-class liberal
with vested interest undoubtedly
looks like part of the problem.
(Marc Sapir is a sth year
medical student at Stanford.)
A pall of doom lies heavy over
Stanford. What political
animation there is, betrays a
mood of snobish defeatism and
political hopelessness and there is
a growing and continuing
anti-working class and
anti-communist sentiment.
The role of the Stanford Daily
in helping to confuse people
about reality, consistent with the
role of mass media in general in
the U.S., only adds to the
problem. The Daily, like the
general press, has sometimes
amusingly portrayed political
conflict as a struggle between the
left and right-wing extremists.
Perhaps it behooves me to point
out that only the left and right
wings have understood that the
Daily is an aspect of American
liberalism.
Both historically and at the
present time, throughout the
country, the area, or Stanford,
liberalism represents the political
ideology of the most pragmatic
wing of the ruling class in a
decaying class society. It does not
represent the forces of progress or
moral concern.
Ken Pit/.er: "Liberal"
No one can coubt, for example,
that Ken Pitzer is indeed a liberal.
But how Pitzer functions as an
important national leader in the
go vern men t-academic-industrial
network or how he helps
coordinate Third World
development and counter
insurgency programs for
government and business is the
political question which clarifies
the basic opportunism underlying
the liberal ideology of reform.
The unqualified support that the
Daily has given Stanford's and
Pitzer's stand on BYU
demonstrates how easily the
media creates a reality which
doesn't exist, i.e. that liberalism is
based upon a moral concern
leading to corrective remedies.
Quite likely, the black colony
in America will not be confused
by media headlines declaring that
Stanford is now on the side of
racial, cultural, and class equality.
Certainly Stanford workers, black
or otherwise, who are prevented
from unionizing for reasonable
wages and working conditions by
university intimidation will not
think of Stanford as beneficent.
Recent layoffs for "lack of
finances" and firings of politically
active workers only highlight the
picture. Perhaps Pitzer should
reduce his salary to that of other
Stanford workers with only one
year of experience and rehire
some of the people at the press or
the physical plant.
But the point to be made is not
that Pitzer is an enemy of
humanity, but that the Daily as
most aspects of Stanford also
represents that phoney moralistic
opportunism which provides a
rationale for continued
exploitation of human beings
under U.S. capitalism and its
foreign conquests. Not unlike
ruthless elements of the ruling
class represented by Alioto,
Reagan, Agnew or Nixon, the
Daily can one day support and
rationalize the behavior of the
April 3rd Movement as morally
good because that movement is
widespread and powerful, yet
some other day condemn the
"violence" of "leftists". This is as
if to say that the fundamental
political conflict today is between
the forces of violence and
non-violence rather than between
the majority classes and the small
class of rulers and owners of
American corporate monopoly in
the U.S. and Third World. This is
nothing new. Historically, liberal
aspects of every crumbling
political structure have put up
such bogus issues to confuse the
people.
Daily Distortion
Let me take a concrete example

of the Daily's unconscious liberal
distortion of reality. Last quarter
the Daily produced an article
about the People's Medical Center
which a group of us are setting up.
The Daily's version was that a
group of altruistic young Stanford
Drs. dedicated to the youth of the
peninsula was setting up a free
clinic upen to all. This flew in the
face of fact, since the clinic is not
Stanford based publicly dedicated
to serving: 1) working class
people—black, chicano, white 2)
young people—drop outs, political
organizers, communal folk 3)
middle class families who have

had enough of the bullshit
professionalism and exploitation
of American medicine. The clinic
will include primarily
comprehensive family care,
supplemented by educational
programs dedicated to attacks on
existing medical practice and
institutions, political organizing,
and health education and
preventive health. The clinic will
be free for some people but not
for most Stanford students, or
faculty who could afford to pay
and whose money will help keep
us open. The clinic will be a
full-time operation.

aspects of every crumbling
political structure have put up
such bogus issues to confuse the
people.
Daily Distortion
Let me take a concrete example

of the Daily's unconscious liberal
distortion of reality. Last quarter
the Daily produced an article
about the People's Medical Center
which a group of us are setting up.
The Daily's version was that a
group of altruistic young Stanford
Drs. dedicated to the youth of the
peninsula was setting up a free
clinic upen to all. This flew in the
face of fact, since the clinic is not
Stanford based publicly dedicated
to serving: 1) working class
people—black, chicano, white 2)
young people—drop outs, political
organizers, communal folk 3)
middle class families who have

had enough of the bullshit
professionalism and exploitation
of American medicine. The clinic
will include primarily
comprehensive family care,
supplemented by educational
programs dedicated to attacks on
existing medical practice and
institutions, political organizing,
and health education and
preventive health. The clinic will
be free for some people but not
for most Stanford students, or
faculty who could afford to pay
and whose money will help keep
us open. The clinic will be a
full-time operation.

A follow up letter to the Daily
criticizing their coverage was
submitted but refused, not, I am
sure, because the Daily was
malicious but because it was
unwilling to elevate the clinic
beyond the level of a vague, one
dimensional, liberal reform
program. If the clinic becomes
powerful, the Dail> will be there
like the rest of the media to again
distort, exploit and digest the
PMC from some new perspective.
The point, my friends is this:
look deeply, analyze the real
world not on paper but on the
basis of experience in the real

world. Since Stanford College is
not the real world this presents a
problem. Nevertheless, everyone
must face the value judgements
that stand before them in this
country and this world. Or as one
brother once said, "you've got to
decide whether you're part of the
problem or part of the solution."
To black Americans and most of
the brothers in the Third World, a
non-violent middle-class liberal
with vested interest undoubtedly
looks like part of the problem.
(Marc Sapir is a sth year
medical student at Stanford.)
A pall of doom lies heavy over
Stanford. What political
animation there is, betrays a
mood of snobish defeatism and
political hopelessness and there is
a growing and continuing
anti-working class and
anti-communist sentiment.
The role of the Stanford Daily
in helping to confuse people
about reality, consistent with the
role of mass media in general in
the U.S., only adds to the
problem. The Daily, like the
general press, has sometimes
amusingly portrayed political
conflict as a struggle between the
left and right-wing extremists.
Perhaps it behooves me to point
out that only the left and right
wings have understood that the
Daily is an aspect of American
liberalism.
Both historically and at the
present time, throughout the
country, the area, or Stanford,
liberalism represents the political
ideology of the most pragmatic
wing of the ruling class in a
decaying class society. It does not
represent the forces of progress or
moral concern.
Ken Pit/.er: "Liberal"
No one can coubt, for example,
that Ken Pitzer is indeed a liberal.
But how Pitzer functions as an
important national leader in the
go vern men t-academic-industrial
network or how he helps
coordinate Third World
development and counter
insurgency programs for
government and business is the
political question which clarifies
the basic opportunism underlying
the liberal ideology of reform.
The unqualified support that the
Daily has given Stanford's and
Pitzer's stand on BYU
demonstrates how easily the
media creates a reality which
doesn't exist, i.e. that liberalism is
based upon a moral concern
leading to corrective remedies.
Quite likely, the black colony
in America will not be confused
by media headlines declaring that
Stanford is now on the side of
racial, cultural, and class equality.
Certainly Stanford workers, black
or otherwise, who are prevented
from unionizing for reasonable
wages and working conditions by
university intimidation will not
think of Stanford as beneficent.
Recent layoffs for "lack of
finances" and firings of politically
active workers only highlight the
picture. Perhaps Pitzer should
reduce his salary to that of other
Stanford workers with only one
year of experience and rehire
some of the people at the press or
the physical plant.
But the point to be made is not
that Pitzer is an enemy of
humanity, but that the Daily as
most aspects of Stanford also
represents that phoney moralistic
opportunism which provides a
rationale for continued
exploitation of human beings
under U.S. capitalism and its
foreign conquests. Not unlike
ruthless elements of the ruling
class represented by Alioto,
Reagan, Agnew or Nixon, the
Daily can one day support and
rationalize the behavior of the
April 3rd Movement as morally
good because that movement is
widespread and powerful, yet
some other day condemn the
"violence" of "leftists". This is as
if to say that the fundamental
political conflict today is between
the forces of violence and
non-violence rather than between
the majority classes and the small
class of rulers and owners of
American corporate monopoly in
the U.S. and Third World. This is
nothing new. Historically, liberal
aspects of every crumbling
political structure have put up
