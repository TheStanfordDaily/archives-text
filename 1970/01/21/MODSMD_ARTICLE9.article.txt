# Disenchanted With Stanford
## 'Exploitation' & Racism' 
### Ken Garner 
In Aug of 1968 I came to work
as a bookbinder at Stanford Press.
After a long two years in the
Army I assumed that the liberal
educational environment that the
campus offered was just what I
needed to restore my faith in the
dignity of man and the good old
USA.
The media had reported how
Stanford was working to solve our
internal problems like the cities,
pollution and the race relations. I
had no visions of being able to
contribute much but I looked
forward to being in the area where
the problems were being solved.
My disenchantment was slow
but sure. Beginning with
Stanford's position on war related

research it culminated when I was
fired.
Prior to my dismissal I had
been elected the area vice
president of the bookbinders
union. I had run on the platform
of turning Stanford's company
union, controlled by management
with union officers being
supervisory personnel and
foremen, into a good union
protecting the rights of the
workers. Although we were in a
union it was the same situation of
other workers on campus and we
were receiving less pay than other
bookbinders off campus.
Foreman Backed
When I raised a past overtime

grievance with the foreman, ten
minutes later I was laid off for
"lack of work". With the
chairman of the United Stanford
Employee Grievance Committee I
talked with Leon Seltzer Director
of the Press. He backed his
foreman and said it was only
coincidental that I was laid off
after raising the grievance.
He said that if I wasn't satisfied
with his explanation I could file a
grievance. So I did. Stanford
violated nine of their own policies
when I was fired, but when the
grievance got to Brandon and
Scroggs, it was rejected on the
grounds that Press members were
"an exception" and that I should
file a grievance through the
bookbinders union.
The bookbinders Union, at that
time were investigating the 3rd
loss of funds in the past ten years.
Since I threatened the security of
old men in power they chose to
ignore my grievance saying they
knew nothing of Stanford's policy
and won't help.
Black & White
Meanwhile, Tony Norman, a
black man who was my roomate
was fired for "lack of experience"
after being hired with no
experience and given a 25c raise
after one month because of the
good work he was doing. He
hadn't been required to join the
union as called for in the union
contract that the Press claimed to
follow. The last white man to
hold the job had been a union
member and is still called into
vote on contracts when the
company and union officials need
to ramrod something down the
workers' throats. The present
warehouseman, who took Tony's
place started at the union scale for
warehouseman. It just happens
that he is white.
Since the original reason given
for my lay-off is lack of work I
have been visiting libraries all over
campus and they have the work
but either send it to outside scab
shops for the same price or higher
or send it to the Press and then
wait for two or three months to
get it done. Books have waited for
days to be picked up because
management seems to be unable
to get the messages to the truck
driver. Then the libraries wait for
weeks to be billed because of poor
administration.
Scroggs and Brandin say we are
"an exception" when it might
cost them a little money but then
tell us how many benefits we have
as staff members when it comes
time to negotiate. Well athletic
tickets and library cards don't put
groceries on the shelf. When
Brandin and Scroggs are examples
of Stanford graduates, I'll be
damned if I'll ever use the tuition
benefits for my children at
Stanford.
A Certain In tegrity
Reading the Press clippings in
Encina on Stanford Press I found

a statement adopted by the
Senate of Academic Council on
Oct 2, 1969 it states:
"A book has a certain integrity
that makes it a book and not just
a collection of paragraphs or
papers and this integrity must be
respected."
At Stanford a worker is just a
collection of arms and legs and
skills and there is no reason to
respect his integrity or rights.
Exploit them for the benefit of
Stanford. If they demand a living
wage and recognition that they
are more than Robots for the
glory of Stanford, fire them. Keep
the leaders from leading, divide
the blacks from the whites, and
the men from the women, coerce
those remaining with threats to
close the shop.
Bring in machines that are more
efficient, lay off the workers, let
the unemployed workers fight
inflation. The bosses make all
decisions in their plush offices
dictating feast or famine. Why
should they care? Why should the
professors who write the books,
the students who read the books
and the bosses who keep the
books care about the men and
women who print and bind the
books.
Do You Care?
Well if you care about human
rights and the dignity of man,
look at your own campus. The
exploitation, racism, and
oppression are right in your own
back yard. Students and workers
unite. Power to the Students.
Power to the Workers.

rights and the dignity of man,
look at your own campus. The
exploitation, racism, and
oppression are right in your own
back yard. Students and workers
unite. Power to the Students.
Power to the Workers.
(Ken Garner is a former
book binder at Stanford
University.)
In Aug of 1968 I came to work
as a bookbinder at Stanford Press.
After a long two years in the
Army I assumed that the liberal
educational environment that the
campus offered was just what I
needed to restore my faith in the
dignity of man and the good old
USA.
The media had reported how
Stanford was working to solve our
internal problems like the cities,
pollution and the race relations. I
had no visions of being able to
contribute much but I looked
forward to being in the area where
the problems were being solved.
My disenchantment was slow
but sure. Beginning with
Stanford's position on war related

research it culminated when I was
fired.
Prior to my dismissal I had
been elected the area vice
president of the bookbinders
union. I had run on the platform
of turning Stanford's company
union, controlled by management
with union officers being
supervisory personnel and
foremen, into a good union
protecting the rights of the
workers. Although we were in a
union it was the same situation of
other workers on campus and we
were receiving less pay than other
bookbinders off campus.
Foreman Backed
When I raised a past overtime

grievance with the foreman, ten
minutes later I was laid off for
"lack of work". With the
chairman of the United Stanford
Employee Grievance Committee I
talked with Leon Seltzer Director
of the Press. He backed his
foreman and said it was only
coincidental that I was laid off
after raising the grievance.
He said that if I wasn't satisfied
with his explanation I could file a
grievance. So I did. Stanford
violated nine of their own policies
when I was fired, but when the
grievance got to Brandon and
Scroggs, it was rejected on the
grounds that Press members were
"an exception" and that I should
file a grievance through the
bookbinders union.
The bookbinders Union, at that
time were investigating the 3rd
loss of funds in the past ten years.
Since I threatened the security of
old men in power they chose to
ignore my grievance saying they
knew nothing of Stanford's policy
and won't help.
Black & White
Meanwhile, Tony Norman, a
black man who was my roomate
was fired for "lack of experience"
after being hired with no
experience and given a 25c raise
after one month because of the
good work he was doing. He
hadn't been required to join the
union as called for in the union
contract that the Press claimed to
follow. The last white man to
hold the job had been a union
member and is still called into
vote on contracts when the
company and union officials need
to ramrod something down the
workers' throats. The present
warehouseman, who took Tony's
place started at the union scale for
warehouseman. It just happens
that he is white.
Since the original reason given
for my lay-off is lack of work I
have been visiting libraries all over
campus and they have the work
but either send it to outside scab
shops for the same price or higher
or send it to the Press and then
wait for two or three months to
get it done. Books have waited for
days to be picked up because
management seems to be unable
to get the messages to the truck
driver. Then the libraries wait for
weeks to be billed because of poor
administration.
Scroggs and Brandin say we are
"an exception" when it might
cost them a little money but then
tell us how many benefits we have
as staff members when it comes
time to negotiate. Well athletic
tickets and library cards don't put
groceries on the shelf. When
Brandin and Scroggs are examples
of Stanford graduates, I'll be
damned if I'll ever use the tuition
benefits for my children at
Stanford.
A Certain In tegrity
Reading the Press clippings in
Encina on Stanford Press I found

a statement adopted by the
Senate of Academic Council on
Oct 2, 1969 it states:
"A book has a certain integrity
that makes it a book and not just
a collection of paragraphs or
papers and this integrity must be
respected."
At Stanford a worker is just a
collection of arms and legs and
skills and there is no reason to
respect his integrity or rights.
Exploit them for the benefit of
Stanford. If they demand a living
wage and recognition that they
are more than Robots for the
glory of Stanford, fire them. Keep
the leaders from leading, divide
the blacks from the whites, and
the men from the women, coerce
those remaining with threats to
close the shop.
Bring in machines that are more
efficient, lay off the workers, let
the unemployed workers fight
inflation. The bosses make all
decisions in their plush offices
dictating feast or famine. Why
should they care? Why should the
professors who write the books,
the students who read the books
and the bosses who keep the
books care about the men and
women who print and bind the
books.

Well if you care about human
rights and the dignity of man,
look at your own campus. The
exploitation, racism, and
oppression are right in your own

should they care? Why should the
professors who write the books,
the students who read the books
and the bosses who keep the
books care about the men and
women who print and bind the
books.
Do You Care?
Well if you care about human
rights and the dignity of man,
look at your own campus. The
exploitation, racism, and
oppression are right in your own
back yard. Students and workers
unite. Power to the Students.
Power to the Workers.
(Ken Garner is a former
book binder at Stanford
University.)
In Aug of 1968 I came to work
as a bookbinder at Stanford Press.
After a long two years in the
Army I assumed that the liberal
educational environment that the
campus offered was just what I
needed to restore my faith in the
dignity of man and the good old
USA.
The media had reported how
Stanford was working to solve our
internal problems like the cities,
pollution and the race relations. I
had no visions of being able to
contribute much but I looked
forward to being in the area where
the problems were being solved.
My disenchantment was slow
but sure. Beginning with
Stanford's position on war related

research it culminated when I was
fired.
Prior to my dismissal I had
been elected the area vice
president of the bookbinders
union. I had run on the platform
of turning Stanford's company
union, controlled by management
with union officers being
supervisory personnel and
foremen, into a good union
protecting the rights of the
workers. Although we were in a
union it was the same situation of
other workers on campus and we
were receiving less pay than other
bookbinders off campus.
Foreman Backed
When I raised a past overtime

grievance with the foreman, ten
minutes later I was laid off for
"lack of work". With the
chairman of the United Stanford
Employee Grievance Committee I
talked with Leon Seltzer Director
of the Press. He backed his
foreman and said it was only
coincidental that I was laid off
after raising the grievance.
He said that if I wasn't satisfied
with his explanation I could file a
grievance. So I did. Stanford
violated nine of their own policies
when I was fired, but when the
grievance got to Brandon and
Scroggs, it was rejected on the
grounds that Press members were
"an exception" and that I should
file a grievance through the
bookbinders union.
The bookbinders Union, at that
time were investigating the 3rd
loss of funds in the past ten years.
Since I threatened the security of
old men in power they chose to
ignore my grievance saying they
knew nothing of Stanford's policy
and won't help.
Black & White
Meanwhile, Tony Norman, a
black man who was my roomate
was fired for "lack of experience"
after being hired with no
experience and given a 25c raise
after one month because of the
good work he was doing. He
hadn't been required to join the
union as called for in the union
contract that the Press claimed to
follow. The last white man to
hold the job had been a union
member and is still called into
vote on contracts when the
company and union officials need
to ramrod something down the
workers' throats. The present
warehouseman, who took Tony's
place started at the union scale for
warehouseman. It just happens
that he is white.
Since the original reason given
for my lay-off is lack of work I
have been visiting libraries all over
campus and they have the work
but either send it to outside scab
shops for the same price or higher
or send it to the Press and then
wait for two or three months to
get it done. Books have waited for
days to be picked up because
management seems to be unable
to get the messages to the truck
driver. Then the libraries wait for
weeks to be billed because of poor
administration.
Scroggs and Brandin say we are
"an exception" when it might
cost them a little money but then
tell us how many benefits we have
as staff members when it comes
time to negotiate. Well athletic
tickets and library cards don't put
groceries on the shelf. When
Brandin and Scroggs are examples
of Stanford graduates, I'll be
damned if I'll ever use the tuition
benefits for my children at
Stanford.
A Certain In tegrity
Reading the Press clippings in
Encina on Stanford Press I found

a statement adopted by the
Senate of Academic Council on
Oct 2, 1969 it states:
"A book has a certain integrity
that makes it a book and not just
a collection of paragraphs or
papers and this integrity must be
respected."
At Stanford a worker is just a
collection of arms and legs and
skills and there is no reason to
respect his integrity or rights.
Exploit them for the benefit of
Stanford. If they demand a living
wage and recognition that they
are more than Robots for the
glory of Stanford, fire them. Keep
the leaders from leading, divide
the blacks from the whites, and
the men from the women, coerce
those remaining with threats to
close the shop.
Bring in machines that are more
efficient, lay off the workers, let
the unemployed workers fight
inflation. The bosses make all
decisions in their plush offices
dictating feast or famine. Why
should they care? Why should the
professors who write the books,
the students who read the books
and the bosses who keep the
books care about the men and
women who print and bind the
books.
