# Hope For Environment?
## 'Garbage' Professor Optimistic 
### MARGIE WOLF Second in a Series 
Despite gloomy predictions of
ecological collapse, civil
engineering professor Rolf
Eliassen is a "prophet of hope."
Seated in his booklined office
amid clanking radiator and pipe
smoke, Eliassen might be
mistakenly judged isolated and
naive. But the easy-going ecologist
has advised Presidents Kennedy,
Johnson and Nixon. Businessmen,
anxious to "do something" about
pollution, constantly tie up his
phone.
Eliassen knows there are plenty
of problems to solve. His
catalogue of dilemmas contains a
broad selection, but each
pessimistic entry is paired with an
optimistic solution.

Solid and liquid waste
management are at the top of his
list.
Against Waste Management
"I'm prejudiced toward waste
management," Eliassen admitted.
"It's my field." It's also a major
topic in his three unit course,
"Man and His Environment,"
nicknamed "Garbage" by students
who know his bias.
If we burned paper and garbage
in efficient incinerators, he
explained, we could generate ten
percent of the nation's electric
power. Waste control could also
provide heat, as in Paris. There a
huge incinerator provides central
steam heating for the city through
a maze of subterranean tunnels.
Waste Water
Eliassen also consider waste
water a top priority item. "We can
use once-used water again instead

of throwing it away," he noted.
Los Angeles might purify and
recycle its sewage water, he
suggested, for sewage is 35 times
purer than sea water. Power
plants are another major
concern. The problem is
exemplified in Los Angeles, where
no more fossil fuel generators may
be built for fear of further
pollution.
To meet need for an eightfold
increase in power plants by the
end of the century, Eliassen
proposes nuclear fuel.
When placed carefully, he
stated, nuclear plants would not
unwisely change the ecological
balance through extra heat.
Thermal Pollution Not l?i»
"Thermal pollution on the
ocean around Los Angeles is a
drop in the bucket," he shrugged.
Extra heat flow may even improve
the area's ecology, as when heat
from a reactor induced lobsters
back to Maine shores.
"There's still a lot more to be
done, but engineers have already
done a lot. The engineer has
control methods, but they haven't
been used enough," Eliassen
reflected in another see-saw
judgment.

Ultimately, new recruits to
environmental concern Eliassen's
scales with an optimistic outlook.
Ecological Planners
Counting industry and labor in
the ranks of ecological planners,
Eliassen cited an offer from the
Independent Petroleum
Association, George Meany and
Walter Reuther to contribute $10
million to fight pollution.
He thinks Nixon has finally
"taken the ball and run with it."
"Until now, people just weren't
behind it," Eliassen suggested.
"But we're getting somewhere
now because people and the
communications media are behind
it."
He looks to continuing
education to solve ecological
problems. "We must keep pressure
on people so they'll keep pressure
on Congress. We have to sell this
to people."
"Public health is purchasable at
a price," Eliassen remarked,
quoting the New York State
Public Health motto.
(The Daily series on Stanford
ecologists will continue with
interviews of professors Joshua
Lederberg, William Baxter, and
Paul Hurd.)
