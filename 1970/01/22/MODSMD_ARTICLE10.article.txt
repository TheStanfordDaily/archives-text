# Notes From Bolivia
## Here Comes the Parable Man! 
### Hugh J. McCracken 
It is an old custom here in
Bolivia that on the third weekend
after Washington's birthday, Los
Hombre Parable (the Parable Man)
visits the homes of all Bolivian
children, leaving pleasant fairy
stories at the doorsteps of the
good little boys and girls and
obscene smoking-car stories at the
doorsteps of the nasty little boys
and girls. The Parable Man always
travels in a strange mist, especially
if the subway is too crowded, and
keeps everyone amused for hours
with his carefree imitations of
Bennett Cerf. Well, this year the
Parable Man made his rounds a
little earlier than usual, hoping to
make it to Florida in time for
spring training, and, as a matter of
fact, darkened our door just a day
or two ago.

It was late afternoon and I was
out in the back yard showing
Junior, my wife, some
A I 1 â–  American football
pass-patterns including the
down-and-out, the buck-and-wing,
and the go-home-and-sleep-it-off.
All of a sudden, the Parable Man
raced into the yard, tripped over a
lawn chair, and fell into a deep
coma which we use for a
swimming pool in the
summertime. The incident
disturbed my wife greatly, and, at
my urging, she ran away to Los
Angeles, where she was arrested
almost immediately for saying
"Lome Greene" in public. "Well,
I guess it takes all kinds to make
this land of ours," said the Parable
Man later, when asked about tax
evasion; and he placed the
following items in my hot, yet
dainty, hands:
This Year's Parables
1. You be the judge!
Two girls have taken up
residence on the New Jersey
Turnpike. Longingly they watch
the cars whiz by but no one will
stop and say hello to them.
Finally, a Chevy convertible pulls
up and the driver, an escaped
Englishman, offers to take one of
the girls (Nanette) out for a spin.
After several exits have gone by,
the Englishman realizes how
impressed Nanette is and asks if
she would like to get out and
change the tires. "But they are
not flat!" protests Nanette. "And
neither is Elizabeth Taylor!"
retorts the wily driver. This last

remark elicits great response from
the sizable crowd which has
gathered in the back seat. Years
later, Nanette has entirely
forgotten the incident.
2. The Plumber's friend.
Queen Elizabeth and Prince
Philip are visiting the United
States and have finally reached
lowa by boat. As they wander
about the capitol city, Des
Moines, the Queen spies a group
of Americans standing in line at a
gum machine. "Oh look," she
cries, "see how democratic they
are!" Naturally, the Prince is
furious at this and cancels the rest
of the trip. Back in England, he
refuses to pay for any more of the
Queen's trombone lessons.
3. The Frisbee Menace.
Dennis rushes into a room full
of friends and family to announce
that he has just invented the
typewriter. This news is greeted
with great hoots and jeers from
everyone except pretty, shy
Maria. She stands silently in one
corner of the room and will not
move unless something is thrown
at her. Dennis approaches her.
"And what do they call you, my
pretty one?" he asks gently.
"They call me plenty," she
replies, "and you can bet that
dan-fancy line of yours ain't
gonna work around here." Dennis
wonders aloud whether pegged
pants will ever come back. No-one
thinks so.
