## Pitzer's ROTC Caper 
### Michael Sweeney 
This is a short history of Ken
Pitzer's ROTC caper. The last
chapter of the caper can't yet be
written; it depends on whether
the Stanford community will
silently allow the restoration of
military training as an academic
program.
Until Tuesday morning, most
of us at Stanford believed that
ROTC was dead. But then our
eyes were opened by the
front-page Daily story that
revealed that President Pitzer was
exertiiig strong, unprecedented
pressure on the Academic Senate
to approve a U.S. Army plan for
continued ROTC. Pitzer wants a
favorable vote at the Senate
meeting this afternoon, and it
looks like he is determined to get
what he wants.
Our history begins in February,
1969. College campuses were torn
by anti-ROTC demonstrations;
only three months later, Harvard
would explode over this issue
Senate Votes Ban
Sensitive to these concerns, the
Stanford Academic Senate voted
25-8 on February 13 that "there
should be no academic credit
received for participation in
programs of military training and
education."
The bitter anti-war sentiment
of the faculty was behind the
resolution, as conservative critics
would later charge. The senate
was strict and explicit in laying
down restrictions on ROTC. "No
Stanford faculty member or
administrator, acting as
spokesman for the University,
shall encourage students to
participate in military training and
education," said the resolution.
The faculty said that the contracts
between the military and its
cadets should be revised to
eliminate the punitive clause that
threatened a student with
immediate induction if he
dropped out of ROTC.
ROTC could remain as a
non-credit, voluntary activity, but
it was doubtful that the Defense
Department would accept those

terms. (As we shall see, it didn't.)
The Senate asked Pitzer to
form a faculty-student committee
to "assist in effecting the
transition."
A Crisis For Pitzer
The swiftness and force of the
Senate action took the University
administration by surprise. Soon
it became clear that the faculty
had created a crisis in Stanford's
relationship to the Defense
Department (DOD), the Congress,
and its own corporate Board of
Trustees.
Vice Provost Howard Brooks,
laid out the University's dilemma
in the lead article of Campus
Report on March 19.
"Brooks notes," said the
Report, "that the DOD is facing
the reality of the 'domino theory.'
He states that although ROTC
programs at Stanford and Ivy
League schools are expensive,
they represent prestige value.
'Already there are stirrings of
opposition to ROTC at state
institutions,' Brooks explains,
'and if the prestige schools drop
the programs, other schools well
could follow suit."
Packard Gives Opinion
Earlier, Stanford had heard the
government's position directly
from David Packard, who had
recently left his position as the
most influential member of the
Board of Trustees to become
Nixon's Deputy Secretary of
Defense. Stanford should "keep
ROTC on campus and upgrade it
to meet academic standards,"
Packard told the Daily just one
week after the Academic Senate
had voted to rule out academic
credit.
Not surprisingly, the Board of
Trustees endorsed Packard's
stance at its March 11 meeting.
Pitzer was caught in a bind. On
one hand, he was faced with an
unequivocal decision from the
faculty, which has always insisted
on complete control over
academic credit. But the
counter-pressure from the
Pentagon and the Board of
Trustees grew stronger every day.

A chance to reverse the
Senate's decision came when 50
professors signed a petition
appealing the decision to the
entire Academic Council of all
faculty. Intense lobbying was
done by the administration's
allies, but prominent and highly
respected faculty came out
publicly in support of the Senate.
In April, the Council voted 403 to
356 to support the ban on ROTC
credit.
Choosing ihr Advisory Committer
But Pitzer still hoped to
accomodate the Defense
Department. The Senate's
resolution had empowered him to
appoint a committee to
implement its decision. He did
this on June 6. It was a strange
committee to be asked to work
out the details involved in taking
credit away from ROTC. Of the
three students, two were ROTC
cadets. 01 the five faculty, one
(Jean Mayer) had vigorously
campaigned for reversal of the
Senate decision. Vice Provost
Brooks and Army Col. Ramey
attended all committee meetings.
The committee was stacked.
Over the summer, the
government put the heat on the
universities that were endangering
ROTC. An amendment was
proposed in Congress that would
deny Defense Department
research funds to any University
that would not sponsor ROTC.
The universities successfully
stopped this measure, however.
DOD Is Adamant
Pitzer hoped that the Defense
Department would compromise
by agreeing to some kind of
non-credit, voluntary program.
But his hopes were dashed.
Stanford's ROTC Head, Colonel
S.M. Ramey, told Pitzer on
October 22 that the Army
thought academic credit was vital.
He also said that the Army was
inflexible on keeping the
departmental punitive clause in
student contracts.
Pitzer apparently felt he had no
choice but to reverse the Senate's
decision. His carefully-picked

advisory committee was
cooperative, and voted 6-2 to
accept an Army proposal for
continuation of ROTC.
The two dissenting members,
including the committee's
chairman, Alan Manne, bitterly
issued a dissenting report that said
they signed the committee's
memorandum only "with
considerable reluctance." They
said "Stanford is being asked to
adopt the DOD's position, and
thereby to reverse last spring's
faculty decision."
Pitzer's committee advanced a
plan that would allow ROTC to
continue with virtually no
changes, but made it sound like a
completely reformed program. It
advocated:
1. Changing the name of ROTC
to "Center for Military Studies."
2. Retaining all faculty
privileges for military instructors,
but changing their title from
"professor" to "director" and
denying them a vote on the
Academic Council.
3. Instead of blanket academic
credit for all ROTC courses, each
course would have to obtain
separate certification from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which also approves the
undergraduate special program of
non-departmental courses.
4. The punitive clause in
student contracts would remain,
as the Pentagon insisted.
Time Running Ont
Time was running out for
Pitzer, since the Senate wanted
credit removed starting in fall,
1970, while the Army wanted its
plan approved so it could start
enrolling scholarship students.
With the cooperation of William
Clebsch, chairman of the
Academic Senate, Pitzer decided
to push the plan through the
Academic Senate with maximum
speed.
On January 9, Clebsch gave a
brief description of the Army
proposal at a meeting of the
Academic Council.
The text of the proposal was
not given to Senate members until

last Monday, January 19, only
four days before the Senate
meeting. It was accompanied by a
three-page letter from Pitzer. The
letter tries to argue that the Army
proposal for continuation of
ROTC is consistent with the
Senate's 1969 resolution that
"there should be no academic
credit received for participation in
programs of military training and
education."
No IJilicrenl From Religion
He tells the faculty that
training officers for the U.S.
Army is really no different from
allowing religion on campus. "A
group analogous to the military
officers assigned to ROTC duty at
Stanford might well be the
members of the Stanford United
Ministry. . .who from time to time
give undergraduate special courses
for credit."
(Pitzer didn't tell the faculty
that Navy ROTC intends to secure
as many units of credit under the
new plan as at present. But this
fact was reported in the Daily on
Tuesday.)
To show his determination,
Pitzer repeats that "It appears to
me that this proposal is a
reasonable one."
I telephoned a Senate member
on Tuesday, curious as to how the
Senate would respond to this
seemingly shameless attempt to
force approval of the plan before
the students and faculty even
understood what was happening.
He told me he thought that Pitzer
would win, unless there was a
sudden upsurge of protest from
the community.
Well, I think I'll walk over to
the Graduate School of Business
today (Room 75 at 3:15 p.m.),
and let the Senate know what I
think about the U.S. Army. . . and
if you feel the way I do, why
don't you come with me.
Its like Arlo Guthrie says, if
three people sing in harmony they
think it's an organization, and if
fifty people walk in, it's a
Movement.
This is a short history of Ken
Pitzer's ROTC caper. The last

deny Defense Department
research funds to any University
that would not sponsor ROTC.
The universities successfully
stopped this measure, however.
DOD Is Adamant
Pitzer hoped that the Defense
Department would compromise
by agreeing to some kind of
non-credit, voluntary program.
But his hopes were dashed.
Stanford's ROTC Head, Colonel
S.M. Ramey, told Pitzer on
October 22 that the Army
thought academic credit was vital.
He also said that the Army was
inflexible on keeping the
departmental punitive clause in
student contracts.
Pitzer apparently felt he had no
choice but to reverse the Senate's
decision. His carefully-picked

advisory committee was
cooperative, and voted 6-2 to
accept an Army proposal for
continuation of ROTC.
The two dissenting members,
including the committee's
chairman, Alan Manne, bitterly
issued a dissenting report that said
they signed the committee's
memorandum only "with
considerable reluctance." They
said "Stanford is being asked to
adopt the DOD's position, and
thereby to reverse last spring's
faculty decision."
Pitzer's committee advanced a
plan that would allow ROTC to
continue with virtually no
changes, but made it sound like a
completely reformed program. It
advocated:
1. Changing the name of ROTC
to "Center for Military Studies."
2. Retaining all faculty
privileges for military instructors,
but changing their title from
"professor" to "director" and
denying them a vote on the
Academic Council.
3. Instead of blanket academic
credit for all ROTC courses, each
course would have to obtain
separate certification from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which also approves the
undergraduate special program of
non-departmental courses.
4. The punitive clause in
student contracts would remain,
as the Pentagon insisted.
Time Running Ont
Time was running out for
Pitzer, since the Senate wanted
credit removed starting in fall,
1970, while the Army wanted its
plan approved so it could start
enrolling scholarship students.
With the cooperation of William
Clebsch, chairman of the
Academic Senate, Pitzer decided
to push the plan through the
Academic Senate with maximum
speed.
On January 9, Clebsch gave a
brief description of the Army
proposal at a meeting of the
Academic Council.
The text of the proposal was
not given to Senate members until

last Monday, January 19, only
four days before the Senate
meeting. It was accompanied by a
three-page letter from Pitzer. The
letter tries to argue that the Army
proposal for continuation of
ROTC is consistent with the
Senate's 1969 resolution that
"there should be no academic
credit received for participation in
programs of military training and
education."
No IJilicrenl From Religion
He tells the faculty that
training officers for the U.S.
Army is really no different from
allowing religion on campus. "A
group analogous to the military
officers assigned to ROTC duty at
Stanford might well be the
members of the Stanford United
Ministry. . .who from time to time
give undergraduate special courses
for credit."
(Pitzer didn't tell the faculty
that Navy ROTC intends to secure
as many units of credit under the
new plan as at present. But this
fact was reported in the Daily on
Tuesday.)
To show his determination,
Pitzer repeats that "It appears to
me that this proposal is a
reasonable one."
I telephoned a Senate member
on Tuesday, curious as to how the
Senate would respond to this
seemingly shameless attempt to
force approval of the plan before
the students and faculty even
understood what was happening.
He told me he thought that Pitzer
would win, unless there was a
sudden upsurge of protest from
the community.
Well, I think I'll walk over to
the Graduate School of Business
today (Room 75 at 3:15 p.m.),
and let the Senate know what I
think about the U.S. Army. . . and
if you feel the way I do, why
don't you come with me.
Its like Arlo Guthrie says, if
three people sing in harmony they
think it's an organization, and if
fifty people walk in, it's a
Movement.
This is a short history of Ken
Pitzer's ROTC caper. The last
chapter of the caper can't yet be
written; it depends on whether
the Stanford community will
silently allow the restoration of
military training as an academic
program.
Until Tuesday morning, most
of us at Stanford believed that
ROTC was dead. But then our
eyes were opened by the
front-page Daily story that
revealed that President Pitzer was
exertiiig strong, unprecedented
pressure on the Academic Senate
to approve a U.S. Army plan for
continued ROTC. Pitzer wants a
favorable vote at the Senate
meeting this afternoon, and it
looks like he is determined to get
what he wants.
Our history begins in February,
1969. College campuses were torn
by anti-ROTC demonstrations;
only three months later, Harvard
would explode over this issue
Senate Votes Ban
Sensitive to these concerns, the
Stanford Academic Senate voted
25-8 on February 13 that "there
should be no academic credit
received for participation in
programs of military training and
education."
The bitter anti-war sentiment
of the faculty was behind the
resolution, as conservative critics
would later charge. The senate
was strict and explicit in laying
down restrictions on ROTC. "No
Stanford faculty member or
administrator, acting as
spokesman for the University,
shall encourage students to
participate in military training and
education," said the resolution.
The faculty said that the contracts
between the military and its
cadets should be revised to
eliminate the punitive clause that
threatened a student with
immediate induction if he
dropped out of ROTC.
ROTC could remain as a
non-credit, voluntary activity, but
it was doubtful that the Defense
Department would accept those

terms. (As we shall see, it didn't.)
The Senate asked Pitzer to
form a faculty-student committee
to "assist in effecting the
transition."
A Crisis For Pitzer
The swiftness and force of the
Senate action took the University
administration by surprise. Soon
it became clear that the faculty
had created a crisis in Stanford's
relationship to the Defense
Department (DOD), the Congress,
and its own corporate Board of
Trustees.
Vice Provost Howard Brooks,
laid out the University's dilemma
in the lead article of Campus
Report on March 19.
"Brooks notes," said the
Report, "that the DOD is facing
the reality of the 'domino theory.'
He states that although ROTC
programs at Stanford and Ivy
League schools are expensive,
they represent prestige value.
'Already there are stirrings of
opposition to ROTC at state
institutions,' Brooks explains,
'and if the prestige schools drop
the programs, other schools well
could follow suit."
Packard Gives Opinion
Earlier, Stanford had heard the
government's position directly
from David Packard, who had
recently left his position as the
most influential member of the
Board of Trustees to become
Nixon's Deputy Secretary of
Defense. Stanford should "keep
ROTC on campus and upgrade it
to meet academic standards,"
Packard told the Daily just one
week after the Academic Senate
had voted to rule out academic
credit.
Not surprisingly, the Board of
Trustees endorsed Packard's
stance at its March 11 meeting.
Pitzer was caught in a bind. On
one hand, he was faced with an
unequivocal decision from the
faculty, which has always insisted
on complete control over
academic credit. But the
counter-pressure from the
Pentagon and the Board of
Trustees grew stronger every day.

A chance to reverse the
Senate's decision came when 50
professors signed a petition
appealing the decision to the
entire Academic Council of all
faculty. Intense lobbying was
done by the administration's
allies, but prominent and highly
respected faculty came out
publicly in support of the Senate.
In April, the Council voted 403 to
356 to support the ban on ROTC
credit.
Choosing ihr Advisory Committer
But Pitzer still hoped to
accomodate the Defense
Department. The Senate's
resolution had empowered him to
appoint a committee to
implement its decision. He did
this on June 6. It was a strange
committee to be asked to work
out the details involved in taking
credit away from ROTC. Of the
three students, two were ROTC
cadets. 01 the five faculty, one
(Jean Mayer) had vigorously
campaigned for reversal of the
Senate decision. Vice Provost
Brooks and Army Col. Ramey
attended all committee meetings.
The committee was stacked.
Over the summer, the
government put the heat on the
universities that were endangering
ROTC. An amendment was
proposed in Congress that would
deny Defense Department
research funds to any University
that would not sponsor ROTC.
The universities successfully
stopped this measure, however.

revealed that President Pitzer was
exertiiig strong, unprecedented
pressure on the Academic Senate
to approve a U.S. Army plan for
continued ROTC. Pitzer wants a
favorable vote at the Senate
meeting this afternoon, and it
looks like he is determined to get
what he wants.
Our history begins in February,
1969. College campuses were torn
by anti-ROTC demonstrations;
only three months later, Harvard
would explode over this issue
Senate Votes Ban
Sensitive to these concerns, the
Stanford Academic Senate voted
25-8 on February 13 that "there
should be no academic credit
received for participation in
programs of military training and
education."
The bitter anti-war sentiment
of the faculty was behind the
resolution, as conservative critics
would later charge. The senate
was strict and explicit in laying
down restrictions on ROTC. "No
Stanford faculty member or
administrator, acting as
spokesman for the University,
shall encourage students to
participate in military training and
education," said the resolution.
The faculty said that the contracts
between the military and its
cadets should be revised to
eliminate the punitive clause that
threatened a student with
immediate induction if he
dropped out of ROTC.
ROTC could remain as a
non-credit, voluntary activity, but
it was doubtful that the Defense
Department would accept those

terms. (As we shall see, it didn't.)
The Senate asked Pitzer to
form a faculty-student committee
to "assist in effecting the
transition."
A Crisis For Pitzer
The swiftness and force of the
Senate action took the University
administration by surprise. Soon
it became clear that the faculty
had created a crisis in Stanford's
relationship to the Defense
Department (DOD), the Congress,
and its own corporate Board of
Trustees.
Vice Provost Howard Brooks,
laid out the University's dilemma
in the lead article of Campus
Report on March 19.
"Brooks notes," said the
Report, "that the DOD is facing
the reality of the 'domino theory.'
He states that although ROTC
programs at Stanford and Ivy
League schools are expensive,
they represent prestige value.
'Already there are stirrings of
opposition to ROTC at state
institutions,' Brooks explains,
'and if the prestige schools drop
the programs, other schools well
could follow suit."
Packard Gives Opinion
Earlier, Stanford had heard the
government's position directly
from David Packard, who had
recently left his position as the
most influential member of the
Board of Trustees to become
Nixon's Deputy Secretary of
Defense. Stanford should "keep
ROTC on campus and upgrade it
to meet academic standards,"
Packard told the Daily just one
week after the Academic Senate
had voted to rule out academic
credit.
Not surprisingly, the Board of
Trustees endorsed Packard's
stance at its March 11 meeting.
Pitzer was caught in a bind. On
one hand, he was faced with an
unequivocal decision from the
faculty, which has always insisted
on complete control over
academic credit. But the
counter-pressure from the
Pentagon and the Board of
Trustees grew stronger every day.

A chance to reverse the
Senate's decision came when 50
professors signed a petition
appealing the decision to the
entire Academic Council of all
faculty. Intense lobbying was
done by the administration's
allies, but prominent and highly
respected faculty came out
publicly in support of the Senate.
In April, the Council voted 403 to
356 to support the ban on ROTC
credit.
Choosing ihr Advisory Committer
But Pitzer still hoped to
accomodate the Defense
Department. The Senate's
resolution had empowered him to
appoint a committee to
implement its decision. He did
this on June 6. It was a strange
committee to be asked to work
out the details involved in taking
credit away from ROTC. Of the
three students, two were ROTC
cadets. 01 the five faculty, one
(Jean Mayer) had vigorously
campaigned for reversal of the
Senate decision. Vice Provost
Brooks and Army Col. Ramey
attended all committee meetings.
The committee was stacked.
Over the summer, the
government put the heat on the
universities that were endangering
ROTC. An amendment was
proposed in Congress that would
deny Defense Department
research funds to any University
that would not sponsor ROTC.
The universities successfully
stopped this measure, however.
DOD Is Adamant
Pitzer hoped that the Defense
Department would compromise
by agreeing to some kind of
non-credit, voluntary program.
But his hopes were dashed.
Stanford's ROTC Head, Colonel
S.M. Ramey, told Pitzer on
October 22 that the Army
thought academic credit was vital.
He also said that the Army was
inflexible on keeping the
departmental punitive clause in
student contracts.
Pitzer apparently felt he had no
choice but to reverse the Senate's
decision. His carefully-picked

advisory committee was
cooperative, and voted 6-2 to
accept an Army proposal for
continuation of ROTC.
The two dissenting members,
including the committee's
chairman, Alan Manne, bitterly
issued a dissenting report that said
they signed the committee's
memorandum only "with
considerable reluctance." They
said "Stanford is being asked to
adopt the DOD's position, and
thereby to reverse last spring's
faculty decision."
Pitzer's committee advanced a
plan that would allow ROTC to
continue with virtually no
changes, but made it sound like a
completely reformed program. It
advocated:
1. Changing the name of ROTC
to "Center for Military Studies."
2. Retaining all faculty
privileges for military instructors,
but changing their title from
"professor" to "director" and
denying them a vote on the
Academic Council.
3. Instead of blanket academic
credit for all ROTC courses, each
course would have to obtain
separate certification from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which also approves the
undergraduate special program of
non-departmental courses.
4. The punitive clause in
student contracts would remain,
as the Pentagon insisted.
Time Running Ont
Time was running out for
Pitzer, since the Senate wanted
credit removed starting in fall,
1970, while the Army wanted its
plan approved so it could start
enrolling scholarship students.
With the cooperation of William
Clebsch, chairman of the
Academic Senate, Pitzer decided
to push the plan through the
Academic Senate with maximum
speed.
On January 9, Clebsch gave a
brief description of the Army
proposal at a meeting of the
Academic Council.
The text of the proposal was
not given to Senate members until

last Monday, January 19, only
four days before the Senate
meeting. It was accompanied by a
three-page letter from Pitzer. The
letter tries to argue that the Army
proposal for continuation of
ROTC is consistent with the
Senate's 1969 resolution that
"there should be no academic
credit received for participation in
programs of military training and
education."
No IJilicrenl From Religion
He tells the faculty that
training officers for the U.S.
Army is really no different from
allowing religion on campus. "A
group analogous to the military
officers assigned to ROTC duty at
Stanford might well be the
members of the Stanford United
Ministry. . .who from time to time
give undergraduate special courses
for credit."
(Pitzer didn't tell the faculty
that Navy ROTC intends to secure
as many units of credit under the
new plan as at present. But this
fact was reported in the Daily on
Tuesday.)
To show his determination,
Pitzer repeats that "It appears to
me that this proposal is a
reasonable one."
I telephoned a Senate member
on Tuesday, curious as to how the
Senate would respond to this
seemingly shameless attempt to
force approval of the plan before
the students and faculty even
understood what was happening.
He told me he thought that Pitzer
would win, unless there was a
sudden upsurge of protest from
the community.
Well, I think I'll walk over to
the Graduate School of Business
today (Room 75 at 3:15 p.m.),
and let the Senate know what I
think about the U.S. Army. . . and
if you feel the way I do, why
don't you come with me.
Its like Arlo Guthrie says, if
three people sing in harmony they
think it's an organization, and if
fifty people walk in, it's a
Movement.
This is a short history of Ken
Pitzer's ROTC caper. The last
chapter of the caper can't yet be
written; it depends on whether
the Stanford community will
silently allow the restoration of
military training as an academic
program.
Until Tuesday morning, most
of us at Stanford believed that
ROTC was dead. But then our
eyes were opened by the
front-page Daily story that
revealed that President Pitzer was

thought academic credit was vital.
He also said that the Army was
inflexible on keeping the
departmental punitive clause in
student contracts.
Pitzer apparently felt he had no
choice but to reverse the Senate's
decision. His carefully-picked

advisory committee was
cooperative, and voted 6-2 to
accept an Army proposal for
continuation of ROTC.
The two dissenting members,
including the committee's
chairman, Alan Manne, bitterly
issued a dissenting report that said
they signed the committee's
memorandum only "with
considerable reluctance." They
said "Stanford is being asked to
adopt the DOD's position, and
thereby to reverse last spring's
faculty decision."
Pitzer's committee advanced a
plan that would allow ROTC to
continue with virtually no
changes, but made it sound like a
completely reformed program. It
advocated:
1. Changing the name of ROTC
to "Center for Military Studies."
2. Retaining all faculty
privileges for military instructors,
but changing their title from
"professor" to "director" and
denying them a vote on the
Academic Council.
3. Instead of blanket academic
credit for all ROTC courses, each
course would have to obtain
separate certification from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which also approves the
undergraduate special program of
non-departmental courses.
4. The punitive clause in
student contracts would remain,
as the Pentagon insisted.
Time Running Ont
Time was running out for
Pitzer, since the Senate wanted
credit removed starting in fall,
1970, while the Army wanted its
plan approved so it could start
enrolling scholarship students.
With the cooperation of William
Clebsch, chairman of the
Academic Senate, Pitzer decided
to push the plan through the
Academic Senate with maximum
speed.
On January 9, Clebsch gave a
brief description of the Army
proposal at a meeting of the
Academic Council.
The text of the proposal was
not given to Senate members until

last Monday, January 19, only
four days before the Senate
meeting. It was accompanied by a
three-page letter from Pitzer. The
letter tries to argue that the Army
proposal for continuation of
ROTC is consistent with the
Senate's 1969 resolution that
"there should be no academic
credit received for participation in
programs of military training and
education."
No IJilicrenl From Religion
He tells the faculty that
training officers for the U.S.
Army is really no different from
allowing religion on campus. "A
group analogous to the military
officers assigned to ROTC duty at
Stanford might well be the
members of the Stanford United
Ministry. . .who from time to time
give undergraduate special courses
for credit."
(Pitzer didn't tell the faculty
that Navy ROTC intends to secure
as many units of credit under the
new plan as at present. But this
fact was reported in the Daily on
Tuesday.)
To show his determination,
Pitzer repeats that "It appears to
me that this proposal is a
reasonable one."
I telephoned a Senate member
on Tuesday, curious as to how the
Senate would respond to this
seemingly shameless attempt to
force approval of the plan before
the students and faculty even
understood what was happening.
He told me he thought that Pitzer
would win, unless there was a
sudden upsurge of protest from
the community.
Well, I think I'll walk over to
the Graduate School of Business
today (Room 75 at 3:15 p.m.),
and let the Senate know what I
think about the U.S. Army. . . and
if you feel the way I do, why
don't you come with me.
Its like Arlo Guthrie says, if
three people sing in harmony they
think it's an organization, and if
fifty people walk in, it's a
Movement.
This is a short history of Ken
Pitzer's ROTC caper. The last
chapter of the caper can't yet be
written; it depends on whether
the Stanford community will
silently allow the restoration of
military training as an academic
program.
Until Tuesday morning, most
of us at Stanford believed that
ROTC was dead. But then our
eyes were opened by the
front-page Daily story that
revealed that President Pitzer was
exertiiig strong, unprecedented
pressure on the Academic Senate
to approve a U.S. Army plan for
continued ROTC. Pitzer wants a
favorable vote at the Senate
meeting this afternoon, and it
looks like he is determined to get
what he wants.
Our history begins in February,
1969. College campuses were torn
by anti-ROTC demonstrations;
only three months later, Harvard
would explode over this issue
Senate Votes Ban
Sensitive to these concerns, the
Stanford Academic Senate voted
25-8 on February 13 that "there
should be no academic credit
received for participation in
programs of military training and
education."
The bitter anti-war sentiment
of the faculty was behind the
resolution, as conservative critics
would later charge. The senate
was strict and explicit in laying
down restrictions on ROTC. "No
Stanford faculty member or
administrator, acting as
spokesman for the University,
shall encourage students to
participate in military training and
education," said the resolution.
The faculty said that the contracts
between the military and its
cadets should be revised to
eliminate the punitive clause that
threatened a student with
immediate induction if he
dropped out of ROTC.
ROTC could remain as a
non-credit, voluntary activity, but
it was doubtful that the Defense
Department would accept those

terms. (As we shall see, it didn't.)
The Senate asked Pitzer to
form a faculty-student committee
to "assist in effecting the
transition."
A Crisis For Pitzer
The swiftness and force of the
Senate action took the University
administration by surprise. Soon
it became clear that the faculty
had created a crisis in Stanford's
relationship to the Defense
Department (DOD), the Congress,
and its own corporate Board of
Trustees.
Vice Provost Howard Brooks,
laid out the University's dilemma
in the lead article of Campus
Report on March 19.
"Brooks notes," said the
Report, "that the DOD is facing
the reality of the 'domino theory.'
He states that although ROTC
programs at Stanford and Ivy
League schools are expensive,
they represent prestige value.
'Already there are stirrings of
opposition to ROTC at state
institutions,' Brooks explains,
'and if the prestige schools drop
the programs, other schools well
could follow suit."
Packard Gives Opinion
Earlier, Stanford had heard the
government's position directly
from David Packard, who had
recently left his position as the
most influential member of the
Board of Trustees to become
Nixon's Deputy Secretary of
Defense. Stanford should "keep
ROTC on campus and upgrade it
to meet academic standards,"
Packard told the Daily just one
week after the Academic Senate
had voted to rule out academic
credit.
Not surprisingly, the Board of
Trustees endorsed Packard's
stance at its March 11 meeting.
Pitzer was caught in a bind. On
one hand, he was faced with an
unequivocal decision from the
faculty, which has always insisted
on complete control over
academic credit. But the
counter-pressure from the
Pentagon and the Board of
Trustees grew stronger every day.

A chance to reverse the
Senate's decision came when 50
professors signed a petition
appealing the decision to the
entire Academic Council of all
faculty. Intense lobbying was
done by the administration's
allies, but prominent and highly
respected faculty came out
publicly in support of the Senate.
In April, the Council voted 403 to
356 to support the ban on ROTC
credit.
Choosing ihr Advisory Committer
But Pitzer still hoped to
accomodate the Defense
Department. The Senate's
resolution had empowered him to
appoint a committee to
implement its decision. He did
this on June 6. It was a strange
committee to be asked to work
out the details involved in taking
credit away from ROTC. Of the
three students, two were ROTC
cadets. 01 the five faculty, one
(Jean Mayer) had vigorously
campaigned for reversal of the
Senate decision. Vice Provost
Brooks and Army Col. Ramey
attended all committee meetings.
The committee was stacked.
Over the summer, the
government put the heat on the
universities that were endangering
ROTC. An amendment was
proposed in Congress that would
deny Defense Department
research funds to any University
that would not sponsor ROTC.
The universities successfully
stopped this measure, however.
DOD Is Adamant
Pitzer hoped that the Defense
Department would compromise
by agreeing to some kind of
non-credit, voluntary program.
But his hopes were dashed.
Stanford's ROTC Head, Colonel
S.M. Ramey, told Pitzer on
October 22 that the Army
thought academic credit was vital.
He also said that the Army was
inflexible on keeping the
departmental punitive clause in
student contracts.
