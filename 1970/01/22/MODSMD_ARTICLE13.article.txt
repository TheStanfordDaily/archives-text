# Number 60 Tops
## Draft Ceiling for February Set 
### 
The National Selective Service
System headquarters in
Washington, D.C., has set the limit
of draft calls for the month of
February at number 60.
While the report from
Washington to the state and local
boards is officially "advisory", it
has the force of a near-order to
the lower offices.
Most of the state draft directors
contacted in conjunction with this
report said that they would
probably have to induct all
eligible men up to the number 60
to fill their quotas. If a board is
unable to fill its quota from the
men under its jurisdiction, the
state draft director must shift the
remainder of the quota to those
boards having an excess of men
with numbers that are eligible for
induction.
The decision to set the
February limit at 60 was reached
by White House aids and Pentagon
manpower experts in joint
consultation, according to a
Selective Service spokesman.
The February limit was termed
an "interim measure" by the
Selective Service. The purpose of
the limit is to ensure that all draft
boards are inducting men with

approximately the same draft
numbers.
Annual Quotas
The "interim measure" is
hoped to be the first stage of a
plan to put the states on annual
instead of monthly quotas. This
would enable the state directors
to divide the quota more
equitably among local boards,
taking into consideration their
available pool of manpower for
any one set of dates.
The proposed new system
would alleviate the possible
problem of local boards which are
forced to draft men with higher
numbers in order to meet the
statewide demands. During the
month of January, for example,
some boards to date have called
men with numbers only in the
teens, while others have called
number 30 already.
Defense Department experts
still contend, however, that the
calls for 1970 will not take in men
with numbers above the mid-200s.
Defense Secretary Laird's most
recent estimate of needs for this
year is 225.000 men.
The February draft call was up
from that of the first month of
the year. January's quota was

12,500 men, that for February is
19,000.
Other Areas
Reports from other areas on
the Selective Service
announcement included the city
of New York, whose draft
director said that the city's boards
would "definitely" reach the limit
number for the month in
inducting men.
The director of the draft in
Alabama expressed doubt that
there are enough eligible men in
the state to fill the quota.

In a related development,
campus draft counselor Alan
Strain predicted that the draft
reforms proposed by the Nixon
Administration, including the
cessation of student deferments,
would accelerate the student
dropout rate here.
Strain said that some students
with high ("safe") numbers would
be tempted to quit school,
knowing that they would not be
called. Other students might find
it easier to study without the
Army breathing down their necks.

forced to draft men with higher
numbers in order to meet the
statewide demands. During the
month of January, for example,
some boards to date have called
men with numbers only in the
teens, while others have called
number 30 already.
Defense Department experts
still contend, however, that the
calls for 1970 will not take in men
with numbers above the mid-200s.
Defense Secretary Laird's most
recent estimate of needs for this
year is 225.000 men.
The February draft call was up
from that of the first month of
the year. January's quota was

12,500 men, that for February is
19,000.
Other Areas
Reports from other areas on
the Selective Service
announcement included the city
of New York, whose draft
director said that the city's boards
would "definitely" reach the limit
number for the month in
inducting men.
The director of the draft in
Alabama expressed doubt that
there are enough eligible men in
the state to fill the quota.

In a related development,
campus draft counselor Alan
Strain predicted that the draft
reforms proposed by the Nixon
Administration, including the
cessation of student deferments,
would accelerate the student
dropout rate here.
Strain said that some students
with high ("safe") numbers would
be tempted to quit school,
knowing that they would not be
called. Other students might find
it easier to study without the
Army breathing down their necks.
The National Selective Service
System headquarters in
Washington, D.C., has set the limit
of draft calls for the month of
February at number 60.
While the report from
Washington to the state and local
boards is officially "advisory", it
has the force of a near-order to
the lower offices.
Most of the state draft directors
contacted in conjunction with this
report said that they would
probably have to induct all
eligible men up to the number 60
to fill their quotas. If a board is
unable to fill its quota from the
men under its jurisdiction, the
state draft director must shift the
remainder of the quota to those
boards having an excess of men
with numbers that are eligible for
induction.
The decision to set the
February limit at 60 was reached
by White House aids and Pentagon
manpower experts in joint
consultation, according to a
Selective Service spokesman.
The February limit was termed
an "interim measure" by the
Selective Service. The purpose of
the limit is to ensure that all draft
boards are inducting men with

approximately the same draft
numbers.
Annual Quotas
The "interim measure" is
hoped to be the first stage of a
plan to put the states on annual
instead of monthly quotas. This
would enable the state directors
to divide the quota more
equitably among local boards,
taking into consideration their
available pool of manpower for
any one set of dates.
The proposed new system
would alleviate the possible
problem of local boards which are
forced to draft men with higher
numbers in order to meet the
statewide demands. During the
month of January, for example,
some boards to date have called
men with numbers only in the
teens, while others have called
number 30 already.
