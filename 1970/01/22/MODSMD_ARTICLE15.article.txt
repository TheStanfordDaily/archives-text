## U.S. Asian Policy Assailed 
### DAVE BRENNER 
United States Asian policy is made by faceless
bureaucrats on the basis of their own survival in
Washington D.C., associate professor of history
Mark ?4ancall told 30 members of the Concerned
Asian Scholars Monday afternoon. "It is not an
evil policy, and it's certainly not good; it is
bureaucratic. That's what is so grotesque," he said.
Mancall attacked the apparent lack of direction
in US policy in the Far East, focusing his attention
on relations with Communist China. He said that
foreigh policy is formed through diplomacy within
groups in the capitol like the Departments of State
and Defense, the CIA, the Treasury Dept., and the
White House.
Each of these has a vested interest, not in the
world situation, as much as in their own position
in the government hierarchy. He noted "any given
policy in the US is the lowest common
denominator ol all different groups."
Between the Lines
Most decisions are based on assumptions made
about the balance of power that developed in the
mid-50's. He explained a dichotomy of State
Department thinking where we see our allies and
the Soviets as rational, and our enemies as
irrational. We can accept official statements from
friends at face value and expect these nations to
act in a reasonable manner. Communist China is
regarded as irrational and can never be expected to

say just what she means. The true message is
always sought by reading between the lines. This
task is performed by CIA and State Department
analyst. He emphasized the dangerous power that
these analysts can have in shaping foreign policy.
Mancall pointed out that we have already given
China de facto recognition. US agencies of all
kinds are centered in Hong Kong, so as to be near
China while only the ambassador resides in
Warsaw. The State Department chooses to ignore
this situation in formulating Asian policy.
The possibility of an independent Taiwan and
the admittance of Communist China to the UN
were dismissed as highly unlikely, first because of
Washington's desire to maintain the status quo;
and secondly because if China is recognized and
admitted, Taiwan would become a major
difficulty.
In tci national Priority
Surprisingly, Mancall gave Taiwan and Japan
higher priority in the international situation than
Vietnam. He noted that the war is primarily a U.S.
concern; one which holds little fascination for
either China or Russia.
Mancall stated that the Defense Department
covets Taiwan since the present Pacific base,
Okinawa, will be returned to the Japanese. Japan's
situation is more complex in that the Soviets and
Japanese are becoming linked economically in the
development of Siberia.
