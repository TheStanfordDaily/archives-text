# 'I Want To Be Like Him'
## Lee Evans Lured By Jordan 
### FRED MANN 
Olympic track star Lee Evans,
formerly a leader in the San Jose
State black boycott of the 1968
games, has once again singled out
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan for comment.
And the unpredictable Evans
made the remark an interesting
one. He admires the coach.
Following his graduation from
San Jose State this week, Evans,
the winner of the Olympic 400
meters, plans to enroll in
Stanford's graduate school of
Education. But the main reason
he is coming to Stanford is
Jordan.
Evans, who is continuing his
brilliant track career at least for

another season told the Los
Angeles Times, "I chose
Stanford because I wanted to
work with Payton Jordan."
The Times story by staff writer
Shav Glick quotes Evans as saying
of the coach, "You can learn a lot
just watching him. If I become a
coach I know I need to learn
techniques in events like the pole
vault and shot put. Payton was a
runner like I am, but he learned
about all the events. I would like
to be like him."
The hard-striding star and
winner of four AAU
championships, carries a 3.2 grade
average in his major of education
at SJS, and has maintained a 4.0
in sociology, his latest interest.

Evans hopes to teach sociology
at the college or university level
as well as coach track after
graduate school.
Coach Jordan, the head coach
of the 1968 Olympic team which
won more medals and broke more
records than any other in history,
was the victim of several verbal
attacks by black leaders during
the boycott controversy.
Evans was one of the leaders of
the proposed boycott along with
his San Jose teammates Tommie
Smith and John Carlos.
It was Carlos and Smith who
caused the most controversy al
the Olympics themselves wit a
gloved fist salute during the
American National Anthem.
They were thrown out of the
games by the International
Olympic Committee.
Evans went along with his
friends' sentiments, but did not
show any signs of protest on the
victory stand after his win.
As track team captain last year,
Evans led San Jose State to their
first NCAA Championship. The
school has since been placed on
probation by the NCAA for rule
violations and is ineligible for any
championship meets this year.

(For an in depth study of the
XCAA and its rules, see John
Arthur's column.)
As a graduate student, Evans
will not be a participant on the
Stanford track team, but hopes to
continue serious training for the
invitational meets under the
supervision of Jordan.
He further plans to study
coaching techniques at Stanford
as well as receiving his teaching
credentials.
