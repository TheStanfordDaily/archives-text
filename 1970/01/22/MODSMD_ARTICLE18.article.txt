## The
						Yale Case – II 
### John Arthur 
The current run-in between the National Collegiate Athletic
Association and Yale University is neither the first example of
administrative blundering on the part of the association nor the first
occasion that the Elis have been unwilling to knuckle under to its
hare-brained schemes. The fact that the often misguided attempts of
the NCAA to run college athletics have frequently involved large
degrees of stupidity and small portions of reason has rarely been
overlooked by Yale and its fellow Ivy Leaguers, with the direct result
that those schools have had few reservations about telling the NCAA
just where it can get off.
To be sure, the NCAA's professed goals coincide with what most
observers feel are the best interests of collegiate athletics. Yet when
Yale or the Ivy League feel that their aims differ from those of other
schools with more extensive athletic programs, they go their own way.
Yale has never been reluctant to take whatever moral stance with
the NCAA it considers justified. It knew from the start it was violating
NCAA policy in permitting senior Jack Langer to play in Israel's
Maccabiah games last summer, but it has continued to play him.
Athletic Director Delaney Kiphuth argues that the NCAA rules are
not serving the athletes, just the organizations.
Association Ired
For its part, the NCAA is apparently angered over Yale's deliberate
flaunting of its rules and the association's Council appears to have
based its harsh penalty against the Elis on a sentence in its
enforcement regulations which permits the Council to take "any
punitive or corrective action which it deems advisable or warranted in
any case. In case of serious violations . . . the conference and the
NCAA . . . should take corrective and punitive action . . ."
Despite the fact that the Langer case and the Yale probation are
receiving wide attention in the sports press and in athletic circles
across the country, high-ranking athletic administrators and coaches at
Stanford have been reluctant to take sides in the dispute. There are
reasons to believe that the University's recent political troubles with
Brigham Young University have accentuated this hesitancy, although
faculty athletic representative John W. Harbaugh points out that the
issue is not one on which Stanford is in any way obliged to make its
views known.
Harbaugh Favors Status Quo
Along with Athletic Director Chuck Taylor, Harbaugh attended the
recent NCAA meetings in Washington. No vote was taken on the Yale
probation among the NCAA membership, but Harbaugh did vote to
table a measure introduced by the eight Ivy League schools which
would have given the NCAA Council the authority to approve the
Maccabiah games. Had the measure passed, observers feel, and had the
Council approved the Jewish games, the penalty leveled against Yale
could have been much less severe than it eventually was.
Harbaugh, chairman of the Geology Department, told the Daily
that the vote to table the measure was not close. He also stressed that
the tabling indicates the issue remains unsettled and will most likely
come up again next year. And, emphasizing that his position in no
way reflected the University's stance, Harbaugh commented that his
own feeling was "not to broaden the scope of these games," meaning
the international, State Dept.-approved games in which NCAA
athletes are permitted to participate.
Like the Olympics and the Pan American games, the Maccabiah
games, sometimes called the "Jewish Olympics," have been approved
by the State Dept. for American participation. And the NCAA has
until recently approved participation in Israel for all its athletes. But
now, since the AAU controls the basketball end of the operation,
the NCAA has ruled the games off-limits to basketball players while
raising no objection to participation by other athletes.
Gaughran Speaks Out
At Stanford's athletic departmeet, most coaches contacted refused
comment on the case on the basis that they didn't have enough
information pertaining to the NCAA's strict penalty against Yale. But
swimming coach Jim Gaughran made no bones about how he felt.
"We think it's as bad a decision as could have been made," he said.
"Both the swimming team and I have been behind Yale all the way.
It's quite a penalty to be assessed for an infraction such as theirs. The
NCAA shouldn't have used the Maccabiah games as the focal point of
their dispute with the AAU. By singling out basketball, then
penalizing all Yale athletes, they've compounded the injustice."
Gaughran admitted that Yale could have handled the matter "a
little more diplomatically," but said he tends to side with Kiphuth on
the issue.
And now, of course, any Stanford victories in the NCAA swimming
Championships in March will be cheapened by the absence of Yale's
fine team.
Tomorrow: The Feud, a review, and a selection of eases in which the
NCAA's judgement has been questioned.
