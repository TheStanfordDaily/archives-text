Intramural basketball took on
a new look last week as Maples
Pavilion became the new
permanent home of the so-called
non-contact, gentleman's game.
The game conditions confused
many at first, for playing three
basketball games on one court
at the same time is something new
at Stanford. But out of the
confusion of 48 games, some great
teams showed promise.
In the top game of the week,
the Kappa Sigs barely nudged out
the Phi Kapps 46-44 after being
down by two at half. The Kappa
Sigs used the shooting of Warren
Greene (18 points) and Gary
Lassen (13) to overcome the
well-balanced Phi Kapp attack.
The Phi Kapps were paced by Jim
Pfingstel (13) and Tony Lettunich
(11) and the strong rebounding of
ex-varsity center, Jerry Sprout.
Another top team is the Delts
who happen to be in the same
league as the Phi Kapps and
Kappa Sigs. Loaded with ex-frosh
basketball players they crushed
the Sigma Chi's, 67-39. They were
paced in the win by the fine
shooting of Bob Lindley (15) and
Brian Hewitt (12), both of whom
played frosh ball last year.
The Panthers, last year's
University champions, showed
that they still have lots of class as
they beat the Village Stompers,
66-40. Pacing the Panthers in

scoring was strong center Ev
Hughes with 17 points. He was
backed up by Rick Turner (16)
and Jackie Brown (14).
Last year's runnerup the KA's,
also showed a scoring punch as
they destroyed the Delta Chi's,
77-39. ' Stu Boyd poured in 22
points for the victors showing that
he has not lost his shooting touch,
and Greg Bruce, the team's steady
center, demonstrated that he
could score also, as he got 17.
Being up by only a 27-24
margin at half, the Theta Delts
poured it on in the second half to
defeat the Phi Sigs, 54-30. All
T-Dumps scored at least three
points as Doug Peart and slick
sticky Dick Anderson led the
scorers with 1 1 points apiece.
The Langdon five shot the eye
out of the bucket last Thursday
night as they creamed AUSA,
90-29. Pacing their scoring was
Guy Smythe with 21 points and
Reggie Benn with 19. Branner also
showed a well-balanced scoring
attack and strong rebounding as
they beat Muir, 62-17.
Putting down a second half
rally, the SAE's barely defeated
the Zetes, 41-38, as Bob Bond
paced the winners with 1 1 points.
Bill Cobb and Bill Hudson
scored 22 and 15 points
respectively, as they led Cro Mem
to a convincing victory over Med
IV, 7 8-32. The Alpha Sigs
demolished the ATO's, 75-27 as

John Haxo led all scorers with 18
points. The Chi Psi's also used
well-balanced scoring and a
tenacious defense to stop the
Betas, 56-16, as Ted Bleymaier
scored 11 of the Betas' 16 points.
The dark horse of this year's
league play seems to be the Pie
Eaters. In their first game it was
rumored that they purposely held
down the score at the request of a
friend of Dizzy Dean's so they
wouldn't show off their potent
offense.
The FBI did look into the case
and found that they did lose,
37-9.

they beat the Village Stompers,
66-40. Pacing the Panthers in

scoring was strong center Ev
Hughes with 17 points. He was
backed up by Rick Turner (16)
and Jackie Brown (14).
Last year's runnerup the KA's,
also showed a scoring punch as
they destroyed the Delta Chi's,
77-39. ' Stu Boyd poured in 22
points for the victors showing that
he has not lost his shooting touch,
and Greg Bruce, the team's steady
center, demonstrated that he
could score also, as he got 17.
Being up by only a 27-24
margin at half, the Theta Delts
poured it on in the second half to
defeat the Phi Sigs, 54-30. All
T-Dumps scored at least three
points as Doug Peart and slick
sticky Dick Anderson led the
scorers with 1 1 points apiece.
The Langdon five shot the eye
out of the bucket last Thursday
night as they creamed AUSA,
90-29. Pacing their scoring was
Guy Smythe with 21 points and
Reggie Benn with 19. Branner also
showed a well-balanced scoring
attack and strong rebounding as
they beat Muir, 62-17.
Putting down a second half
rally, the SAE's barely defeated
the Zetes, 41-38, as Bob Bond
paced the winners with 1 1 points.
Bill Cobb and Bill Hudson
scored 22 and 15 points
respectively, as they led Cro Mem
to a convincing victory over Med
IV, 7 8-32. The Alpha Sigs
demolished the ATO's, 75-27 as

John Haxo led all scorers with 18
points. The Chi Psi's also used
well-balanced scoring and a
tenacious defense to stop the
Betas, 56-16, as Ted Bleymaier
scored 11 of the Betas' 16 points.
The dark horse of this year's
league play seems to be the Pie
Eaters. In their first game it was
rumored that they purposely held
down the score at the request of a
friend of Dizzy Dean's so they
wouldn't show off their potent
offense.
The FBI did look into the case
and found that they did lose,
37-9.
Intramural basketball took on
a new look last week as Maples
Pavilion became the new
permanent home of the so-called
non-contact, gentleman's game.
The game conditions confused
many at first, for playing three
basketball games on one court
at the same time is something new
at Stanford. But out of the
confusion of 48 games, some great
teams showed promise.
In the top game of the week,
the Kappa Sigs barely nudged out
the Phi Kapps 46-44 after being
down by two at half. The Kappa
Sigs used the shooting of Warren
Greene (18 points) and Gary
Lassen (13) to overcome the
well-balanced Phi Kapp attack.
The Phi Kapps were paced by Jim
Pfingstel (13) and Tony Lettunich
(11) and the strong rebounding of
ex-varsity center, Jerry Sprout.
Another top team is the Delts
who happen to be in the same
league as the Phi Kapps and
Kappa Sigs. Loaded with ex-frosh
basketball players they crushed
the Sigma Chi's, 67-39. They were
paced in the win by the fine
shooting of Bob Lindley (15) and
Brian Hewitt (12), both of whom
played frosh ball last year.
The Panthers, last year's
University champions, showed
that they still have lots of class as
