## Panthers: 'Justifiable Homicide' 
### DEBORAH RANKIN 
Associated Press Writer
CHICAGO (AP)— An interracial
coroner's jury returned a verdict
of justifiable homicide Wednesday
in the deaths of two Black
Panther leaders who were fatally
shot in a police raid Dec. 4.
The jury of prominent
Chicagoans said the 14 Chicago
policemen detailed to the state's
attorney's office who participated
in the raid were "reasonable" in
using firearms against the Panthers
because they believed the
weapons "were necessary to
prevent death or bodily harm to
themselves."
Fred Hampton, 21, Illinois
Panther leader, and Mark Clark,
22, Peoria Panther leader, were
killed in the raid on Hampton's
West Side apartment-
Police said they seized 19
weapons in the flat.
After the verdict of justifiable
homicide was read by Dr. Andrew
J. Toman, Cook County Chicago
coroner, Clark's mother rose and
said, "It was not."
Officers' Account
The raiding officers said they
were met by gunfire when they
attempted to serve a search
warrant for a cache of weapons in
Hampton's apartment. Panthers
contended that police fired
without provocation and killed
Hampton as he slept.
During the 12-day inquest
conducted by Martin S. Gerber, a
lawyer serving as special deputy
coroner, the jury heard testimony
from nearly two dozen witnesses.
Coroner Toman stepped aside
after black community groups
demanded the inquest be headed
by someone not connected with
the county government.
The witnesses included the five
black and nine white police
officers who participated in the
raid. Among other witnesses were
two police crime laboratory
technicians, who examined
evidence from the apartment and
a pathologist and his assistant who
performed autopsies on Hampton
and Clark.
Chemist's Testimony
The chief chemist with the
coroner's office testified
Wednesday that he found no
evidence of alcohol or barbituates

in Hampton's blood. Panthers
maintained Hampton was heavily
drugged at the time he was shot.
None of the seven Panthers
who survived the raid testified at
the inquest. Five appeared and
gave only their names, and in
some cases ages and addresses.
Two Panther survivors did not
attend.
All seven have been charged
with attempted murder and other
crimes in connection with the
raid. Four Panther members and
two policemen were injured in the
fray.
Attorneys representing the
Panthers indicated their clients

would testify at their upcoming
trial on the criminal charges.
Yabio usk\' Murder
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Wednesday charged three
Cleveland, Ohio, men in
connection with the murders of
United Mine Workers official
Joseph A. Yablonski and his wife
and daughter.
In making the announcement in
behalf of Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell, the FBI said the three
men are Paul Eugene Gilly,

Aubran Wayne Martin and Claude
Edward Vealey, all of Cleveland.
The bodies of Yablonski, his
wife Margaret, and their
25-year-old daughter Charlotte
Joanne, were discovered Jan. 5 in
bedrooms of their Clarksville, Pa.,
home 35 miles south of
Pittsburgh.
Yablonski had been shot five
times, the wife and daughter twice
each.
The F'BI did not say whether
the three men charged were
members of the mine workers
union, whose election last month
was one of the bitterest in the
history of the labor movement in
the United States. But union
spokesmen in Washington said in a
statement they were "most happy
to learn that they apparently have
no connection with the UMW."

the county government.
The witnesses included the five
black and nine white police
officers who participated in the
raid. Among other witnesses were
two police crime laboratory
technicians, who examined

a pathologist and his assistant who
performed autopsies on Hampton
and Clark.
Chemist's Testimony
The chief chemist with the
coroner's office testified
Wednesday that he found no
evidence of alcohol or barbituates

in Hampton's blood. Panthers
maintained Hampton was heavily
drugged at the time he was shot.
None of the seven Panthers
who survived the raid testified at
the inquest. Five appeared and
gave only their names, and in
some cases ages and addresses.
Two Panther survivors did not
attend.
All seven have been charged
with attempted murder and other
crimes in connection with the
raid. Four Panther members and
two policemen were injured in the
fray.
Attorneys representing the
Panthers indicated their clients

would testify at their upcoming
trial on the criminal charges.

WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Wednesday charged three
Cleveland, Ohio, men in
connection with the murders of
United Mine Workers official
Joseph A. Yablonski and his wife
and daughter.
In making the announcement in
behalf of Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell, the FBI said the three
men are Paul Eugene Gilly,

Aubran Wayne Martin and Claude
Edward Vealey, all of Cleveland.
The bodies of Yablonski, his
wife Margaret, and their
25-year-old daughter Charlotte
Joanne, were discovered Jan. 5 in
bedrooms of their Clarksville, Pa.,
home 35 miles south of
Pittsburgh.
Yablonski had been shot five
times, the wife and daughter twice
each.
The F'BI did not say whether
the three men charged were
members of the mine workers
union, whose election last month
was one of the bitterest in the
history of the labor movement in
the United States. But union
spokesmen in Washington said in a
statement they were "most happy
to learn that they apparently have
no connection with the UMW."

CHICAGO (AP)— An interracial
coroner's jury returned a verdict
of justifiable homicide Wednesday
in the deaths of two Black
Panther leaders who were fatally
shot in a police raid Dec. 4.
The jury of prominent
Chicagoans said the 14 Chicago
policemen detailed to the state's
attorney's office who participated
in the raid were "reasonable" in
using firearms against the Panthers
because they believed the
weapons "were necessary to
prevent death or bodily harm to
themselves."
Fred Hampton, 21, Illinois
Panther leader, and Mark Clark,
22, Peoria Panther leader, were
killed in the raid on Hampton's
West Side apartment-
Police said they seized 19
weapons in the flat.
After the verdict of justifiable
homicide was read by Dr. Andrew
J. Toman, Cook County Chicago
coroner, Clark's mother rose and
said, "It was not."
Officers' Account
The raiding officers said they
were met by gunfire when they
attempted to serve a search
warrant for a cache of weapons in
Hampton's apartment. Panthers
contended that police fired
without provocation and killed
Hampton as he slept.
During the 12-day inquest
conducted by Martin S. Gerber, a
lawyer serving as special deputy
coroner, the jury heard testimony
from nearly two dozen witnesses.
Coroner Toman stepped aside
after black community groups
demanded the inquest be headed
by someone not connected with
the county government.
The witnesses included the five
black and nine white police
officers who participated in the
raid. Among other witnesses were
two police crime laboratory
technicians, who examined
evidence from the apartment and
a pathologist and his assistant who
performed autopsies on Hampton
and Clark.
