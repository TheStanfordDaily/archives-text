The fund-raising efforts of
Stanford's contingent of the
Vencerimos Brigade get under
way with a showing of four Cuban
newsreel films scheduled for 7:30
a.m. this Thursday in the Branner
dining hall. This films include
speeches by Che and
documentaries on the sugar cane
cutters and the battle against
illiteracy. Admission is one dollar.
The Vencerimos Brigade is a
group of some 600 American
volunteers who are working in the
Cuban sugar cane harvest to help
the Cubans in their drive for the
"ten million tons" which will
provide the credits to mechanize
the sugar industry and eliminate
the back-breaking
man-and-machete labor. The first
half of the Brigade left in early
December and will be back at the
end of this month and they have

sent back enthusiastic reports
about their experiences.
The second half of the Brigade
will be leaving soon, and the
150-odd volunteers from the Bay
Area are busy with a long list of
fund-raising activities. The group
is trying to raise as much money
as possible to pay the plane fares
of all blacks and Chicanos on the
Brigade and to help anyone who
cannot afford the 150-dollar
round-trip fare. Stanford students
and Brigade members will be
selling Venceremos posters and
buttons in White Pla/a in addition
to the film showing.

In its first broadcast of the
quarter from the Poppycock in
Downtown Palo Alto, KZSU will
be presenting the nluegrass sounds

the sugar industry and eliminate
the back-breaking
man-and-machete labor. The first
half of the Brigade left in early
December and will be back at the
end of this month and they have

sent back enthusiastic reports
about their experiences.
