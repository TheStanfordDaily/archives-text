# New Draft Proposals
## Deferment And CO Status To Change 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
Controversial new developments in Congress and the
courts may change the complexion of the draft
significantly and widen the basis on which conscientious
objector status may be granted.
Most far-reaching of the new developments is a bill
sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy and others on the
Hill which would eliminate occupational and 'father'
deferments and phase out college deferments (by not
granting any more deferments to incoming freshmen).
With hearings scheduled to begin next month, the bill's
provisions for elimination of most deferments has drawn
strong endorsement from the Nixon Administration,
which has apparently shelved its campaign pledge of a
volunteer army.
Another provision of the Kennedy bill—extending
conscientious objection to those who oppose war on other
than religious grounds (namely, moral and
philosophical)—has not been commented on by the
Administration.
The scheduled draft hearings come one year prior to
the 1971 expiration of the Selective Service law. They
have caused deep concern among advocates of an outright
repeal of the draft.
Strain Comments
One such advocate, Special Services Counselor Alan
Strain, explains, "If hearings result in even minor changes
in the law this year, there is little chance of outright
repeal when the draft comes up for reenactment next
year. We have several months at best to block a slightly
'reformed' draft law which won't be seriously considered
again for five years."
Strain regards the bill's chance of passage as
"significant" and foresees several possible ramifications of
the phasing out of student deferments. For incoming
freshmen, who will no longer be exempt, there will In
considerably more uncertainty. Some may want to

postpone their college education, at least until they leain
what number they hold in the draft lottery.
Lottery numbers will also be increasingly important for
transfer and graduate students, whose chances of being
granted admission or financial aid may depend heavily on
the likelihood of their education being interrupted by the
draft.
However, if most deferments are eliminated the pool of
draftable men will be increased considerably, and the
lottery numbers through which the draft boards must go
to meet their yearly quotas will be substantially lower.
Presently, there are some 2 million men with student
deferments alone.
Court Changes
While Congress considers further changes in the nature
of the draft, the courts are instituting some changes of
their own. However, some observers claim that selective
service boards ignore the decisions of federal courts until
the Selective Service Director orders the boards to change
their policy.
In a December decision, federal judge Stanley Weigel,
whose district encompasses the Bay Area, ruled that a
draft resister may not be prosecuted because he opposes,
by religious training, only the Vietnam war.
I t>j 11 si Wars
In essence, the Weigel decision held that Leslie Charles
Bowen, who claims his Roman Catholic faith allows him
to distinguish between "just" and "unjust" wars and
opposes the Vietnam war as unjust, should have been
classified as a conscientious objector.
Though the Weigel decision allows for selective
objection (objection to the present war, but not
necessarily to all wars) on religious grounds, it makes no
mention of whether such objection can be made on moral
grounds alone.
Thus, legally, the question still remains—is a man who is

morally opposed to the war in Vietnam, but not to all
war, entitled to conscientious objector status?
It is this question which the Supreme Court will answer
in a few months when it hands down its decision in the
case of the United States vs John Heffron Sisson, Jr. At
issue is the right of selective objection, on political and
moral grounds.
Supreme Court to Rule
The Court is being asked to rule on the
constitutionality of Section 6 (J) of the Military Service
Act of 1967, which limits conscientious objector status to
one who "by religious training and belief is
conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any
form."
If Section 6 (J) is declared unconstitutional and
selective objection on moral grounds is allowed, it will
change the situation for men now applying for CO status
and might even be applied retroactively. Men who refused
induction after being denied CO status on grounds similar
to Sisson's might conceivably have their convictions and
sentences reversed.
The Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that
selective service boards cannot speed up induction to
punish registrants for violating draft law regulations.
Delinquent Penalties
In the case of David Earl Gutknecht the Court held that
any action against delinquent registrants must take the
form of criminal prosecution, rather than using the
procedures of the draft board in a punitive way. It is the
practice of draft boards to reclassify delinquents IA, in
first, order of call, above volunteers and lottery draftees.
In the majority opinion, Justice William O. Douglas
strongly denied that there was anything in the 1967 draft
law giving selective service boards "freewheeling
authority to ride herd on the registrants, using immediate
induction as a disciplinary or vindictive measure "

constitutionality of Section 6 (J) of the Military Service
Act of 1967, which limits conscientious objector status to
one who "by religious training and belief is
conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any
form."
If Section 6 (J) is declared unconstitutional and
selective objection on moral grounds is allowed, it will
change the situation for men now applying for CO status
and might even be applied retroactively. Men who refused
induction after being denied CO status on grounds similar
to Sisson's might conceivably have their convictions and
sentences reversed.
The Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that
selective service boards cannot speed up induction to
punish registrants for violating draft law regulations.
Delinquent Penalties
In the case of David Earl Gutknecht the Court held that
any action against delinquent registrants must take the
form of criminal prosecution, rather than using the
procedures of the draft board in a punitive way. It is the
practice of draft boards to reclassify delinquents IA, in
first, order of call, above volunteers and lottery draftees.
In the majority opinion, Justice William O. Douglas
strongly denied that there was anything in the 1967 draft
law giving selective service boards "freewheeling
authority to ride herd on the registrants, using immediate
induction as a disciplinary or vindictive measure "
Controversial new developments in Congress and the
courts may change the complexion of the draft
significantly and widen the basis on which conscientious
objector status may be granted.
Most far-reaching of the new developments is a bill
sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy and others on the
Hill which would eliminate occupational and 'father'
deferments and phase out college deferments (by not
granting any more deferments to incoming freshmen).
With hearings scheduled to begin next month, the bill's
provisions for elimination of most deferments has drawn
strong endorsement from the Nixon Administration,
which has apparently shelved its campaign pledge of a
volunteer army.
Another provision of the Kennedy bill—extending
conscientious objection to those who oppose war on other
than religious grounds (namely, moral and
philosophical)—has not been commented on by the
Administration.
The scheduled draft hearings come one year prior to
the 1971 expiration of the Selective Service law. They
have caused deep concern among advocates of an outright
repeal of the draft.
Strain Comments
One such advocate, Special Services Counselor Alan
Strain, explains, "If hearings result in even minor changes
in the law this year, there is little chance of outright
repeal when the draft comes up for reenactment next
year. We have several months at best to block a slightly
'reformed' draft law which won't be seriously considered
again for five years."
Strain regards the bill's chance of passage as
"significant" and foresees several possible ramifications of
the phasing out of student deferments. For incoming
freshmen, who will no longer be exempt, there will In
considerably more uncertainty. Some may want to

postpone their college education, at least until they leain
what number they hold in the draft lottery.
Lottery numbers will also be increasingly important for
transfer and graduate students, whose chances of being
granted admission or financial aid may depend heavily on
the likelihood of their education being interrupted by the
draft.
However, if most deferments are eliminated the pool of
draftable men will be increased considerably, and the
lottery numbers through which the draft boards must go
to meet their yearly quotas will be substantially lower.
Presently, there are some 2 million men with student
deferments alone.
Court Changes
While Congress considers further changes in the nature
of the draft, the courts are instituting some changes of
their own. However, some observers claim that selective
service boards ignore the decisions of federal courts until
the Selective Service Director orders the boards to change
their policy.
In a December decision, federal judge Stanley Weigel,
whose district encompasses the Bay Area, ruled that a
draft resister may not be prosecuted because he opposes,
by religious training, only the Vietnam war.
I t>j 11 si Wars
In essence, the Weigel decision held that Leslie Charles
Bowen, who claims his Roman Catholic faith allows him
to distinguish between "just" and "unjust" wars and
opposes the Vietnam war as unjust, should have been
classified as a conscientious objector.
Though the Weigel decision allows for selective
objection (objection to the present war, but not
necessarily to all wars) on religious grounds, it makes no
mention of whether such objection can be made on moral
grounds alone.
Thus, legally, the question still remains—is a man who is

morally opposed to the war in Vietnam, but not to all
war, entitled to conscientious objector status?
It is this question which the Supreme Court will answer
in a few months when it hands down its decision in the
case of the United States vs John Heffron Sisson, Jr. At
issue is the right of selective objection, on political and
moral grounds.

the Selective Service Director orders the boards to change
their policy.
In a December decision, federal judge Stanley Weigel,
whose district encompasses the Bay Area, ruled that a
draft resister may not be prosecuted because he opposes,
by religious training, only the Vietnam war.
I t>j 11 si Wars
In essence, the Weigel decision held that Leslie Charles
Bowen, who claims his Roman Catholic faith allows him
to distinguish between "just" and "unjust" wars and
opposes the Vietnam war as unjust, should have been
classified as a conscientious objector.
Though the Weigel decision allows for selective
objection (objection to the present war, but not
necessarily to all wars) on religious grounds, it makes no
mention of whether such objection can be made on moral
grounds alone.
Thus, legally, the question still remains—is a man who is

morally opposed to the war in Vietnam, but not to all
war, entitled to conscientious objector status?
It is this question which the Supreme Court will answer
in a few months when it hands down its decision in the
case of the United States vs John Heffron Sisson, Jr. At
issue is the right of selective objection, on political and
moral grounds.
Supreme Court to Rule
The Court is being asked to rule on the
constitutionality of Section 6 (J) of the Military Service
Act of 1967, which limits conscientious objector status to
one who "by religious training and belief is
conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any
form."
If Section 6 (J) is declared unconstitutional and
selective objection on moral grounds is allowed, it will
change the situation for men now applying for CO status
and might even be applied retroactively. Men who refused
induction after being denied CO status on grounds similar
to Sisson's might conceivably have their convictions and
sentences reversed.
The Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that
selective service boards cannot speed up induction to
punish registrants for violating draft law regulations.
Delinquent Penalties
In the case of David Earl Gutknecht the Court held that
any action against delinquent registrants must take the
form of criminal prosecution, rather than using the
procedures of the draft board in a punitive way. It is the
practice of draft boards to reclassify delinquents IA, in
first, order of call, above volunteers and lottery draftees.
In the majority opinion, Justice William O. Douglas
strongly denied that there was anything in the 1967 draft
law giving selective service boards "freewheeling
authority to ride herd on the registrants, using immediate
induction as a disciplinary or vindictive measure "
