# AFT Pickets To Back TA Grievances Today
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
The American Federation of
Teachers (AFT) will picket
President Kenneth Pitzer's office
this afternoon to publicize their
demands for re-adjusted salaries.
Members of Local 1816 will
picket from 12:45-2:00 to
dramatize Stanford's Teaching
Assistant's discontent on two
major issues: the decreased net
salary in the wake of new income
tax rulings and the lack of a
formal method of stating
discontent to the University.
Picketing, which will include
T-A's and sympathizers from
almost every University

department, was felt necessary to
publicize the demand for a
grievance procedure so that
negotiations can take place on the
re-adjustment of salary levels.
Elimination by a court ruling of
the tax-exempt status of T-A's
reduced their take-home pay
$300-$350 below salary levels
established last spring.
The T-A's are protesting that
new minimum salary guidelines
should be instituted that take into
account their new subjection to
Income Tax on their
University-paid salary.
Income Tax would decrease the
T-A's take-home pay between

$300 and $350, according to
Mark Moscowitz, Executive
Committee Chairman of Local
1816, depending on his position
as a Course Assistant, a Teaching
Assistant, or a Teaching Fellow.
Guidelines Kslablislied
Currently, a C-A is paid $800
per quarter, a T-A $900, and a
T-F $1,000. These guidelines were
established by a University
committee headed by Professor
John Baldeschweiler and were
never negotiated by the AFT. The
AFT is not recognized by the
University as a bargaining agent.
Moscowitz explained that the
T-A's are asking the University to
re-adjust the salary scales by
increasing each T-A's salary for
this year by the amount he would
be paying as. Income Tax. Thus,
the T-A would be taking home the
amount of salary he originally
accepted by signing the contract
with Stanford for this academic
year.
Sympathetic, But Unwilling
"In informal discussion the
University is sympathetic," he
said, "but very unwilling to give
us any money. They will help a
T-A out only in 'hardship cases'."
Moscowitz was unable to estimate
just how much money the AFT
proposition would cost the
University overall. Some
departments, it was noted, may be
able to pay the "tax increase"
individually to their T-A's, but
this is in very few cases.
Moscowitz did estimate the cost
to the English department alone
to be nearly $1 0,000.
The University has not taken
any position on the AFT
demands, according to Fred
Glover, executive assistant to
Pitzer. The only University
position on the tax ruling as yet is
that outlined in a letter sent to
every T-A December 11.
The letter, from Kenneth
Creighton, controller, and Lincoln
Moses, associate provost, noted,
"We have been advised by counsel
that several new court decisions
have interpreted the law very
stringently and have changed the
guidelines for determining
whether the stipends paid T-A's
are tax exempt.
"The University's counsel have
therefore advised the University
that under these court decisions
Stanford must follow the practice
of other universities and withhold
from stipends paid all T-A's.
"It is possible that a T-A's
stipend may be tax exempt if
certain stringent requirements
apply to his individual situation,
and therefore those few T-A's at
Stanford who can show that their
stipends are pure fellowships may
be able successfully to claim
refund of the taxes withheld."
Court Hilling
The entire situation has evolved
as a result of two December, 1969
court decisions changing the T-A
exempt status of the Teaching
Assistant and Jlesearch Assistant.
Under the new rulings both are
now subject to Income Tax on the
money paid them by the
University for research or for
teach ing.
In the late spring, when salary
levels for T-A's were established,
it was understood that the T-A's
were not going to be paying
Income Tax because their salary
was considered by the IRS as
fellowship stipends, which is tax
exempt under IRS Regulations
Section 117.

Picketing, which will include
T-A's and sympathizers from
almost every University

department, was felt necessary to
publicize the demand for a
grievance procedure so that
negotiations can take place on the
re-adjustment of salary levels.
Elimination by a court ruling of
the tax-exempt status of T-A's
reduced their take-home pay
$300-$350 below salary levels
established last spring.
The T-A's are protesting that
new minimum salary guidelines
should be instituted that take into
account their new subjection to
Income Tax on their
University-paid salary.
Income Tax would decrease the
T-A's take-home pay between

$300 and $350, according to
Mark Moscowitz, Executive
Committee Chairman of Local
1816, depending on his position
as a Course Assistant, a Teaching
Assistant, or a Teaching Fellow.
Guidelines Kslablislied
Currently, a C-A is paid $800
per quarter, a T-A $900, and a
T-F $1,000. These guidelines were
established by a University
committee headed by Professor
John Baldeschweiler and were
never negotiated by the AFT. The
AFT is not recognized by the
University as a bargaining agent.
Moscowitz explained that the
T-A's are asking the University to
re-adjust the salary scales by
increasing each T-A's salary for
this year by the amount he would
be paying as. Income Tax. Thus,
the T-A would be taking home the
amount of salary he originally
accepted by signing the contract
with Stanford for this academic
year.
Sympathetic, But Unwilling
"In informal discussion the
University is sympathetic," he
said, "but very unwilling to give
us any money. They will help a
T-A out only in 'hardship cases'."
Moscowitz was unable to estimate
just how much money the AFT
proposition would cost the
University overall. Some
departments, it was noted, may be
able to pay the "tax increase"
individually to their T-A's, but
this is in very few cases.
Moscowitz did estimate the cost
to the English department alone
to be nearly $1 0,000.
The University has not taken
any position on the AFT
demands, according to Fred
Glover, executive assistant to
Pitzer. The only University
position on the tax ruling as yet is
that outlined in a letter sent to
every T-A December 11.
The letter, from Kenneth
Creighton, controller, and Lincoln
Moses, associate provost, noted,
"We have been advised by counsel
that several new court decisions
have interpreted the law very
stringently and have changed the
guidelines for determining
whether the stipends paid T-A's
are tax exempt.
"The University's counsel have
therefore advised the University
that under these court decisions
Stanford must follow the practice
of other universities and withhold
from stipends paid all T-A's.
"It is possible that a T-A's
stipend may be tax exempt if
certain stringent requirements
apply to his individual situation,
and therefore those few T-A's at
Stanford who can show that their
stipends are pure fellowships may
be able successfully to claim
refund of the taxes withheld."
Court Hilling
The entire situation has evolved
as a result of two December, 1969
court decisions changing the T-A
exempt status of the Teaching
Assistant and Jlesearch Assistant.
Under the new rulings both are
now subject to Income Tax on the
money paid them by the
University for research or for
teach ing.
In the late spring, when salary
levels for T-A's were established,
it was understood that the T-A's
were not going to be paying
Income Tax because their salary
was considered by the IRS as
fellowship stipends, which is tax
exempt under IRS Regulations
Section 117.
The American Federation of
Teachers (AFT) will picket
President Kenneth Pitzer's office
this afternoon to publicize their
demands for re-adjusted salaries.
Members of Local 1816 will
picket from 12:45-2:00 to
dramatize Stanford's Teaching
Assistant's discontent on two
major issues: the decreased net
salary in the wake of new income
tax rulings and the lack of a
formal method of stating
discontent to the University.
