# Radical Coalition Threatens Faculty Senate Disruption
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Today's faculty senate meeting
to consider President Pitzer's
proposal to allow credit for ROTC
courses has been threatened with
disruption by a coalition of
radicals calling themselves the new
Stanford Moratorium.
In a meeting last night
sponsored by the SDS, the New
University Conference (NUC) and
the Moratorium, a group of 150
decided to stage a march and rally
and to attend the senate meeting.
Beginning with a support rally
for the AFT picket line in front of
Pitzer's office at 12:45 the group
will march to the meeting of the
Faculty Senate at 3:15 in room
75 of the Graduate School of
Business.
Last week, in a letter to the
Senate, Pitzer asked that an Army
proposal allowing ROTC courses
to be individually approved for
credit be passed. He wrote, "I
personally find the Army proposal
reasonable and acceptable, and
very close indeed to the
recommendations adopted by the

Senate. . .1 strongly urge favorable
Senate consideration."
Professor Hal Kahn of the NUC
led the discussion which debated
several topics including whether
or not even to become involved in
the ROTC controversy.
Background Speech
After a brief speech by Michael
Sweeney giving background on
the issue, several speakers
expressed the opinion that ROTC
is an insignificant issue.
Professor Bruce Franklin then
made a proposal to broaden the
issue to include blocking any
Stanford participation in the war
in Southeast Asia. After
acceptance of this premise, the
group began to discuss the ROTC
issue in detail. Although
discussion ranged over several
related issues, basically the center
point was what to do about the
faculty senate's meeting today.
Said one speaker, "We are here
to discuss the politics of voting to
oppose ROTC, whether it be to sit
in, to lie down, to throw rocks
and bottles, to work through the

academic senate using due
process, or what."
According to Franklin, Pitzer's
decision was precipitated by an
economic crisis which the
University has been forced into by
the War in Vietnam.
Moratorium Name Taken
He suggested taking up the
name Stanford Moratorium and
continuing the fight against
Stanford participation in the US
involvement in SE Asia by "using
tactics of the original moratorium;
that is to shut down the
University until ROTC is kicked
off."
During the discussion of the use
of the name Stanford Moratorium
one speaker declared, "There is
the possibility that we could be
called opportunistic and a lot of
other bullshit things after ripping
this name off a bunch of liberal
pigs."
Another speaker suggested that
the reason Pitzer brought up his
recommendation at this time is
that he feels "safer" now that
anti-war sentiment has died down.
"It is important for us not to
allow him to do that," he said.
The meeting then centered
around a discussion of tactics. The
need for time became a major
point of debate. "It. would be a
mistake for 50 people to go into
the senate and bust it up," said
one speaker." We need time to get
student involvment in this issue."
3 IsMICs
John Schock, deputy chairman
of the Student Senate, divided the
discussion into 3 parts. First there
is the University power structure
issue; then the ROTC credit, no
credit issue; and finally the
problem of Stanford's
involvement in Southeast Asia.
The following program was
passed at last night's meeting:
The Stanford Moratorium demands
an immediate end to Stanford's
participation in the war against the
peoples of Southeast Asia, starting
with the removal of ROTC military
training programs.
We call for Moratorium supporters
1. Join the picket line of the
American Federation of Teachers on
Inner Quad starting at 12:45;
2. Rally at the picket line at 2:30
and march to the meeting of the
Academic Senate at 3:1 5 on the ROTC
question in Graduate School of
Business room 75;
3. Join us in an open Moratorium
meeting outside the Senate meeting
room to plan action to further our
demand.
At our meeting Wednesday night, we
agreed that the Stanford moratorium
was originally organized as a
mass-based anti-war movement. It is in
danger of being taken over by
individuals who are using the
movement to further their own
electoral ambitions.
In light of this, we have
reconstituted ourselves as the Stanford
Moratorium, a mass organization for .ill
those who want to work for the
demand of immediate withdrawl of all
U.S. troops from Southeast Asia.
