# The Wealthy Place
## The Oak Creek Apartments
### Lee Herzenberg 
Have you had a chance yet to
drive by and see the Oak Creek
Apartments on Stanford land?
What do you think it is that
makes it worth while paying
$240/ month for a one bedroom
apartment? Is it the trees, the 5
swimming pools, the 4 tennis
courts, the putting green, the
services available (e.g. maids at a
small extra cost, internal TV
station), or is it the general
poshness of the construction, the
prestige of the address, the
security of knowing that the
neighbors can all afford to live in
a place like this and aren't
ashamed to say so?
Maybe it's the desire to live
close to Stanford or the Welsh
Road office area, so that driving
to work will be easy. Take your
pick. The reasons don't really
matter. The fact is that one good
look at Oak Creek and anyone
knows, as Tevya in "Fiddler on
the Roof" put it, that "here lives
a wealthy man."
Well, all right. Wealthy is a
relative adjective. Let's look at the
figures. The F'HA, most banks and
the Stanford Business office for
that matter, when it is negotiating
with faculty over construction in
the faculty housing area, state
that a maximum of 25 percent of
real income should be budgeted
for housing. This means that a
single person, or a couple (perhaps
with one small child) renting a
one bedroom apartment at Oak
Creek should be earning a
minimum of $11,520 a year alter
taxes, or somewhere upwards of
$16,500/ year gross income.
About 5 percent of Stanford
employees are in that salary range,
and most of them are faculty.

who probably need more than one
bedroom anyway.
Boyd Smith's Inaccuracies
All this not withstanding, Boyd
Smith, Stanford Real Estate
Manager, in an article in Monday's
Daily castigating "Grass Roots"
for "inaccurate and misleading
statements" tells us that Oak
Creek Apartments "rents reflect
moderate cost housing without
subsidy at today's prices." With a
series of figures sufficiently
incomplete so as to make
checking them impossible, he
claims to show that because of
interest rates and subsidies, a
$240 rent for an Oak Creek one
bedroom apartment should be
equated with the $125 rent for an
Escondido Village apartment of
the same size. If that's the case,
Escondido residents ought to
organize immediately to demand
their swimming pools, tennis
courts and built in dishwashers
before someone gets away with
the money!
But this isn't a joking matter.
Boyd Smith is playing fast and
loose with the Stanford
Community on an issue which is
crucially important to the lives of
people in this community—lives of
people who have a hard enough
time buying food and clothing
with what's left after they pay
inflated rents for roofs that leak,
rooms that are too small in
apartments that are far enough
away that when the car breaks
down it's a major
catastrophe —and lives of people
who may not be struggling
themselves, but who care enough
about what's happening to their
brothers to try to inform
themselves so they can pressure

for a just and equitable solution
to the housing problem. How can
a housing committee, for
example, function in an
atmosphere where the Business
office of the University feels free
to make such absurd public
statements?
Boyd Smith's Credibility
If the Oak Creek Apartment
story raises serious doubts as to
Boyd Smith's credibility, the rest
of his article does nothing to allay
our fears. His discussion of
Coyote Hill politely fails to tell us
that a group of permanent local
citizens have filed suit against
Stanford of dodging the
subdivision law and against
selected members of the Palo Alto
City government, including
Stanford Married Student Housing
Director Frank Gallagher (who is
also a Palo Alto City
Councilman), naming Gallagher
for conflict of interest.
Presumably this oversight is due
to the fact that Stanford is
contesting the suit.
The discussion of the
Dillingham project fars no better.
Smith erroneously states that "the
City Council of Palo Alto
thoroughly examined traffic
surveys and projections.
In fact, the Dillingham project
was approved without
consideration of the traffic
contribution of the Coyote Hill
project (not to mention the
Syntex project currently going
up), even though all three projects
feed onto the same major artery:
Page Mill Road. And the list could
go on.
Smith's Redeeming Features
No doubt Smith's article has
redeeming features, and perhaps

some of his criticisms should be
taken to heart by Grass Roots.
But -his irresponsible juggling of
"facts" cannot be ignored. By
putting out a smokescreen of
calculated invective and
misleading financial information,
Boyd Smith and the Business
office for whom he speaks are
guilty of making a mockery of
even the inadequate
decision-making procedures
operant i" the community today,

and those people involved in such
procedures should be put on their
guard.
Then again, perhaps compared
with what has already been done
to the mid-peninsula by the
Business office, Fred Terman and
the Stanford Trustees, Smith's
heavy-handed manipulations don't
really matter very much, anyway.
