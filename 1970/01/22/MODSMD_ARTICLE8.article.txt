Dogs STINK'
There are, lately, too many
dogs in too many classes. Because
of the rain, they stink. They smell
one another, wander about, smell
us. On their part, it may be said,
they seldom bark and they
provide affectionate students with
something to pat.
In general, though, dogs in the
classroom are an unnecessary
distraction, disgusting and, for me
at times, conducive to sneezing.
I would ask my fellow students,
esp. those dollies who seem most
dependent on having dogs
accompany them, to leave the
beasts outside, if not at home.

(The following is a copy of a
letter sent to President Pitzer.)
Dear President Pitzer:
In today's Daily article
concerning ROTC, you are quoted
as comparing the role of the
ROTC staff to that of the
members of the Campus Ministry.
We find this comparison odious. It
forces us to dissociate ourselves

publicly from any implications of
agreement with your proposal.
Insofar as some of us have
taught courses for credit, it has
been under the sponsorship of
regular academic departments,
and has dealt with appropriate
subject matter. We feel that this is
not true of ROTC. It is rather a
functional training, more
analagous to apprenticeship.
Wherever its subject matter is
truly academic (e.g. military
history) it could be taught in the
appropriate department (history).
We take note of the Trustees'
allegation that ROTC is "vital to
the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military
service." It is our considered
opinion that this is not a
sufficient good to justify its
persistence in the university,
inasmuch as the total concept of
war and military might is
obsolete.
As a major humanizing force in
the world, the university should
record its rejection of war as a
viable solution to human conflict
It) discountenancing the whole

military frankenstein. Behind the
clean-cut facade of bands and
flags and patriotism, its true face
is the face of death.

An Apology
Editor, THE DAILY:
We are sending copies of this
letter to the Stanford Daily, the
Stanford University Alumni
Association, and the Stanford
University Athletic Department as
well as copies to the Daily
C a Ii 112 orn i a n , the Alumni
Association of the University of
California, and the Athletic
Department of the University of
California.
On January 16, 1970 at Roscoe
Maples Pavilion, Stanford
University, we executed and took
part in a display of poor taste and
an insult to the students, faculty,
alumni, and members of the
Stanford University Community
as well as the California Alumni
and friends of the University of
California.
It was in the form of a sign

utilizing profane language and
poor taste on our part. It was
intended as a device to rouse spirit
in the California Rooting Section
due to the intense rivalry between
the two universities.
The reason this degrading
display of poor taste occurred was
primarily due to the relative
inexperience of the undersigned in
yell leading ability.
For the above reasons, with a
full realization of the
repercussions resulting from this
violation of the Code of Conduct
for spectators in intercollegiate
athletic activities, we sincerely
apologize to the above mentioned
groups and organizations and any
persons who may have been
insulted or offended by our
action.
It is our hope that from this
unfortunate incident, the
traditional sense of spectator
sportsmanship will be achieved in
future athletic events between the
two universities.
