# The 						Fourth Virtue
## Decisions: How? Who? 
### Felicity Barringer 
Somewhere, within offices and
small cubbyholes around Stanford
University, decisions are made.
How? '
There's a lot of interesting
speculation that could be done
and is being done on that point.
There are a number of individuals
in the University who combine
creative minds with activist
inclinations, and by this
combination produce tangible
and needed innovation and reform
in the University. They know each
other, and gravitate towards each
other when working on the
multifarious plans and projects
which spring up.
The innovators in the
University are drawn from all
ranks—faculty, students, and
administration. Lumped together,
they form a very visible 'elite.'
The students who qualify for
membership in this vague,,
amoeba-like and omnipresent
structure have in the past come
from the ASSU, the Daily, and
other campus organizations, or
have gravitated toward it naturally
by getting to know the right
people.

Less transient than the
students, the faculty and
administration heavies cluster in
key administrative posts, and are
outspoken on key University
committees. It's these faculty and
administrators who are consulted
by those students aspiring to
innovative activism.
Vacuum Consultation
It's a pity that, very often,
much of the consultation and
the creative planning, both of
which affect the entire Stanford
community, is done in a vacuum.
To a disinterested observer, it
might easily seem that creative
planning for Stanford's future
eventually ceases to be the aim of
activism, and all that remains is a
small group of people
pirhouetting on an empty stage all
the while convinced that they are
making a meaningful contribution
to innovation and reform.
The conference scheduled this
weekend reviewing the successes
and failures of the Study of
Education at Stanford is
symptomatic of this elitist
syndrome. Sixty people, faculty,
students, and administrators, will
retreat to the peaceful, vacation
setting of the Asilomar conference
grounds near Monterey, to discuss
past and future directions of
Stanford University.
Asilomar was the brainchild of
a small ad hoc group of faculty
and students. It is sponsored by
the ASSU, and it is in no way a
decision-making body.
Except that most of the people
who will eventually make the
decisions are attending.
Potential—But Whose?
Asilomar has great potential for
a substantive discussion of
possible directions the University
may take in the future.
And it is closed—l/250th of the
Stanford community will attend.
If there is any direction that
Stanford should commit itself to

in the future, it is that of open
discussion and decision-making.
Strange that a conference on
Stanford's future should be
exclusive. I strongly doubt that
any productive discussion would
have been squelched or stymied,
had the conference been opened
to all who wanted to attend.
Accessibility
Attendance might have been
made easier, too, if the conference
were more accessible to the
Stanford community. There is a
good reason for getting away from
the campus—to do any thorough,
directed and constructive thinking
is difficult if your office and its
everyday hassles are only a short
walk away —but why go so far
away? Is it incumbent on thinkers
to travel the 90 miles to Monterey
to clear their heads? There are
equally attractive and secluded
places much nearer to campus.
It would be too easy, though,
to attack the structure of the
Asilomar conference, and ignore
the situation which produced it.
Discussion and innovation, if
there is to be any meaning to
them at all, can't be contained
within a self-designated elite. No
group at Stanford has a monopoly
on creative ideas, or on the will to
carry through with them.
This is a community of
thinkers. Is it then so hard to
recognize that any and all of them
may have thoughts?
