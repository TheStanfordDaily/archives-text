# Over Income Tax Deductions
## TA’s Picket Pitzer’s Office 
### 
Stanford teaching assistants,
members of the American
Federation of Teachers and their
supporters picketed the
Presidents's Office yesterday
afternoon protesting a University
decision to withhold Federal
income tax from the salaries of
teaching assistants and teaching
fellows.
A total of 280 TA's were
affected by the new rulings
following recent court decisions;
70 TA's were already subject to
withholding taxes.
The protest began at 12:45
when fifteen placard-carrying
TA's marched across the
inner-quad from the English
Office. Two of the signs read,
"Unite for a fair wage" and "No
Broken Contracts—we signed in
good faith."
Within a half-hour the number
of people circling in front of the
President's Office had grown to
about forty. Many of the
demonstrators were members of
the New Stanford Moratorium, a
radical anti-war group which had
held its first meeting the night
before. The radicals also
participated in a demonstration
against ROTC at the Business
School later that afternoon.
Some thirty people gathered in
the quad to watch the protest.
Diane Cox, an English TA said
that most of the original
protestors were from the English
Department. "Other departments,
such as Political Science were able
to make good the tax loss," she
commented. "The English
Department couldn't afford to."
She added that approximately

sixty English TA's were affected
by the University action which
was prompted by recent court
Help from AFT Local
Several members of AFT LOcal
1816 took part in the
demonstration though they
themselves had not suffered
financial loss.
Jacques Delacriox, s sociology
TA, commented, "I don't believe
I'm personally affected by this,
but I believe the University action
constitutes an effective breach of
contract."
Frank Cady, a member of the
Executive Committee of Local
1816, stated that the possibility
of a strike by teaching assistants
did exist, but that a work
stoppage probably would not
occur for another month. He did
not know whether the TA would
accept a settlement for less than
the total amount of money that
each had lost to taxes.
TA's Adamant
Other demonstrators were
more adamant. Merle Raybine, a
freshman English TA, stated, "I
don't think we'll settle for less. In
talks last year the University
conceded that $3000 is the
minimum yearly salary that a
person could live on in the Bay
Area. With this I.R.S. ruling the
Administration decided someone
was going to get screwed—and it
turned out to be us."
in a Dec. 24 memorandum to
all Deans and Department
Chairmen, Dean of Graduate
Studies Lincoln E. Moses wrote,
"No policy of 'reimbursing'
teaching assistants for their
Federal income taxes is
contemplated." Moses argued that

the actual income loss to
individual TA's will not be known
until the employees file their tax
returns.
He cited the example of a
married TA whose actual tax
liability on his income ($2400)
for the year 1970/71 would be
only $10.50 (under the new law),
although he wuld have $195
deducted from his pay in nine
instalments. A married TA with a
child would have no tax liability.
Reimbursement Not Fair
Moses argues that this would
make it difficult and abiguous to
establish any ''fair"
reimbursement policy. He
reaffirmed today in a letter to The
Daily that no reimbursement is
contemplated [see page 6].
He also disputed the charge
that the teaching assistants do not
receive a living wage. "Granted,
it's not a luxurious income," he

told a Daily reporter, "but even
after taxes it still exceeds the
stipends received by hundreds of
graduate students now at Stanford
on University Fellowships, NSF,
NIH, NDEA Fellowships and
Traineeships. Not one student has
come into this office claiming that
he has suffered a disaster in his
pocketbook.
"Additional monies for student
assistance —an all too scarce
resource —should not be used to
better the position of those
already more highly paid, but for
others with no fellowship, or
tuition only, or to those with
inadequate support," he
explained.
The picketing ended on
schedule at 2 p.m. with an
announcement of a meeting of
English TA's in the English Office
Monday at 12:15. The speaker
called for other TA's to organize
within their own departments.


PlCKETS—Members of the AFT and their supporters picketed President
Pitzer's office yesterday, hoping to win a pay raise to counterbalance taxes
which a court ruled must Ik* withheld from their salaries.
