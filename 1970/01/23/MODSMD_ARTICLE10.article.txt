# A 						Senator's View
## Perspective On Braunstein 
### Doug McHenry 
Just what does the ASSU
Senate propose to do concerning
student nominations for trustee
committees? To gain an insight as
to what the probably answer to
this question will be, or perhaps
to put it more accurately, as to
what solutions the Senate is
considering and why, it is
necessary to clearly isolate the
issue under deliberation.
Perhaps the clearest fact in the
whole affair is that Yale
Braunstein is not at issue, but
rather the procedures by which he
was declared ineligible to serve.
This fact perhaps is made clearest
by President Pitzer's reason for
rejecting Braunstein's name in
nomination for the trustee finance
committee.
The President's position is
quite simple. He feels not to go
along with the decision of the
SJC, that Braunstein be not
eligible to serve on any university
committee, would be not a accept
the will of the students and more
importantly unnecessarily
intervene into their affairs. He
further points out that the SJC
was created by the overwhelming
majority of the students by
election and therefore its decision
should be respected by students,
faculty, and even members of the
administration.
Senate Position
The ASSU Senate on the other
hand, argues that through the
constitution which was also voted
upon and passed by the students
as the judicial charter, gives them
the power to establish who is
eligible and who is not. And it is
their interpretation that any
member of the association is
eligible for position on
student-trustee committees.
Thus what is seemingly at issue
is President Pitzer's interpretation
of the SJC charter and the

Senate's interpretation of the
ASSU constitution and which of
the two should take precedence.
However, beneath the legal
argument which has ensued is
something very basic. The raw
question is who shall have the
ultimate power concerning
students seats on the trustee
committees, President Pitzer,
ASSU Senate, or the Board of
Trustees themselves? It is clear
from the response of the Senate to
Pitzer's refusal to accept
Braunstein's nomination: they
want that power.
What Senate is Considering
There appear to be two sets of
influences shaping the decision
the Senate will reach. The first
falls into the category of political
realities, what the senators feel
their consitiuency wants them to
do. The most predominate
influence within this set appears
to be intimately connected with
the forth coming spring elections.
Most senators are very worried
about the relationship between
the Senate and the student body.
Above all they want to avoid any
move that will cast a shadow upon
the credibility or reponsiveness of
the Senate. This attitude is
especially apparent since ultra
right wing groups plan to
introduce measures to abolish the
student association in the coming
election by cutting off their
funds.
Another influence, although
not a great, is the element of time.
Many senators appear to be sick
of discussing the trustee issue.
They feel it is tragic that they
have gone two weeks into the new
year without an approved budget
and until the trustee affair is out
of the way who knows when they
will complete it.
The second set of influences
which are working upon them is

related to their goals concerning
the issue. There are mainly three
points which many senators feel
their decision must insure.
Students on Trustee Committees
One, that students almost
regardless of circumstances serve
on trustee committees. For once,
Stanford was a leader in
something, student participation
on a higher level, and did not wait
for Harvard and Yale. This is a
good step forward and students
should have the opportunity to
take full advantage of it.
Two, the Senate should desist
from making President Fitzer into
an authority figure. Many senators
feel that it is about time the
Senate realized President Pitzer is
a liason between the students and
the Board of Trustees, and not a
perpetual enemy of students. The
decision must foster dialogue with
the President and trustees and not
political misinterpretation or
maneuvering bv any party.
And, lastly, that somehow the
decision must open a channel
by which to clarify the dispute
concerning the constitution and
the SJC charter. Who does have
the power to make the final
decision on student nominations?
These appear to be the
unifying segments of the opinions
held by most senators and from
here they differ greatly. In
Monday's Daily I shall show the
major alternatives or proposals
which the senate is considering.
