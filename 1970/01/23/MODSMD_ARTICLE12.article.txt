# Review of Plans
## Land Advisor May Be Hired 
### 
Stanford may soon hire an
outside consultant to aid in
"a review and up-dating of plans
for the use of non-academic
lands."
The hiring proposal was
approved in principle by the
Board of Trustees at their Jan. 13
meeting. The *ioard asked
President Kenneth Pitzer to
propose guidelines for the study
and to present names of
consultants qualii'kd for the
position.
Board action comes after
recent controversy over future use
of Stanford lands outside the
5,200 acres presently sot aside for
academic purposes.
Pitzer has directed the newly
reconstituted Committee on Land
and Building Development to take
a "fresh look" at long-range plans
and proposals. Reporting to the
Academic Council Jnn. 9, Pitzer
said that he is "sure that the
Committee will have in mind the
needs of the total community,
and ecological and environmental
matters, as well as Stanford's
critical need for additional
financial support for education."
Reviews, to be made by the
Committee and or the land
consultant, will not include
on-going projects such as the Page
Mill financial center and
development around Coyote Hill.
Freer Access
The reconstituted Land and i

Building Development Committee
is composed of six faculty
members, three students and two
University staff members. Seven
of the 1 1 are new members.
Pitzer reported he also directed
the Committee to consider ways
the campus community can be
given freer access to unused
campus lands, particularly the
academic reserve on Coyote Hill.
He noted that important
questions about University
liability, policing, maintenance
and the protection of grazing
animals are involved in this
consideration.
In related actions, the
proposed Medical School Animal
Research Center on the Hill has
been reduced in scope because of
construction bids far in excess of
the budget and the subsequent
withdrawal of the Syntex Corp.
from the project. The Medical
School now is evaluating wpys to
build the most critical portions of
the facility.

Prer.ififf.il Pitzer also told the
Acade;,)',f Council that Livinyr.ton

& Blryr.ey, an independent city
and regional planning firm from
San Francisco, has endorsed
Stanford's activities around
Coyote Hill, including a golf
couixc and the industrial park
extension. The firm is making a
two-year foothills environmental
design study for Palo Alto, and
considered ecological, visual, and
recreational factors as well as
technical and economic questions
in its second report to the city.
Stanford may soon hire an
outside consultant to aid in
"a review and up-dating of plans
for the use of non-academic
lands."
The hiring proposal was
approved in principle by the
Board of Trustees at their Jan. 13
meeting. The *ioard asked
President Kenneth Pitzer to
propose guidelines for the study
and to present names of
consultants qualii'kd for the
position.
Board action comes after
recent controversy over future use
of Stanford lands outside the
5,200 acres presently sot aside for
academic purposes.
Pitzer has directed the newly
reconstituted Committee on Land
and Building Development to take
a "fresh look" at long-range plans
and proposals. Reporting to the
Academic Council Jnn. 9, Pitzer
said that he is "sure that the
Committee will have in mind the
needs of the total community,
and ecological and environmental
matters, as well as Stanford's
critical need for additional
financial support for education."
Reviews, to be made by the
Committee and or the land
consultant, will not include
on-going projects such as the Page
Mill financial center and
development around Coyote Hill.
Freer Access
The reconstituted Land and i

Building Development Committee
is composed of six faculty
members, three students and two
University staff members. Seven
of the 1 1 are new members.
Pitzer reported he also directed
the Committee to consider ways
the campus community can be
given freer access to unused
campus lands, particularly the
academic reserve on Coyote Hill.
He noted that important
questions about University
liability, policing, maintenance
and the protection of grazing
animals are involved in this
consideration.
In related actions, the
proposed Medical School Animal
Research Center on the Hill has
been reduced in scope because of
construction bids far in excess of
the budget and the subsequent
withdrawal of the Syntex Corp.
from the project. The Medical
School now is evaluating wpys to
build the most critical portions of
the facility.
