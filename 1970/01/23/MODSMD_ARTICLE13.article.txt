The Stanford Committee to
Repeal the Draft is organizing as a
pilot project for the National
Commitee on Draft Repeal.
In a meeting held last
Wednesday Alan Strain, director
of Selective Service counseling,
stressed the necessity of
immediate action to influence
Senate hearings on draft law
re-enactment which begin
February 9.
Anti-draft organizations hope
to put sufficient pressure on
Congress, particularly the Armed
Services commitee, to defeat
re-enactment of the Selective
Service Act.

One immediate goal of the
national organization expressed at
the meeting is to create sufficient
pressure to persuade the
Committee to hear testimony by
draft-eligible young men.
The Stanford organization
hopes to form an organizational
model for transplant to other
college campuses and to prepare
material to be used against the
draft.
The first problem at Stanford,
according to Strain, is to raise the
issue on campus since abolition of
the draft has not been considered
as a serious alternative in recent
years by many campus residents.
