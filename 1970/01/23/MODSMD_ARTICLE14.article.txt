# Unity Celebration Planned
## 
### 
A diverse celebration of unity
will shake Memorial Church
Sunday morning.
Representa tiaves of nine
different Protestant and Catholic
denominations will lead their
respective segments of the 11 a.m.
congregation in reading aloud
statements of creed chosen to
emphasize the differences in each
faith.
This will be followed by the
unison reading of prayers of
confession and forgiveness and an
affirmation of hope from Dr.
Martin Luther King's speech, "I
Have A Dream."
The service will climax the
annual "Week of Prayer for
Christian Unity" now being
observed throughout the world.
At Stanford, communications
among various denominations has
grown much stronger and more
open in the past several years,
according to leaders of Sunday's

happening-to-be. The event is in
celebration of this growth.
"What we used to call the
'ecumenical movement' is sort of
tired nowadays," Father John
Duryea reports. "Christians of
good will have stopped discussing
reunion an; started just doing."
The Stanford community and
others like it have actually moved
further than have the
decision-making bodies of the
various churches, according to
Diane Kenney, Asst. to the Dean
of the Chapel.
The service also commemorates
to the day the opening of
Memorial Church on Sunday,
January 25, 1903. It was then
dedicated by Mrs. Jane Stanford
and others as a nondenomina
tional church with a spirit of
nnity among those participating.
One of the students present on
that day, Dr. Hugh Moran of Los

Altos, now 86 years old, will be
recognized at this Sunday's
service.
A sermon on the meaning of
Christian unity will be given by
Rev. Charles S. McCoy, professor
of religious and higher education
at the Pacific School of Religion
in Berkeley.
The congregation will read
aloud in unison a future-oriented
paraphrasing of the Nicene creed
written by McCoy.
"I think it will turn out to be
quite a celebration," affirms Dr.
Wayne Rood, Acting Dean of the
Chapel. Rood and McCoy have
shaped the service as a joyful
expression of unity.
The statements of faith read by
the various denominations wiil
include a statement from Vatican
11, words to a hymn by Martin
Luther, Biblical passages, and
parts of creeds.
