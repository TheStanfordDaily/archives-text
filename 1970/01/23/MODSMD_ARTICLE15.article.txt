The Bidding:
North East South West

1H Pass INT Pass
3NT Pass Pass Pass
As you may have noticed by
now, this column is generally
dedicated to the plethora of errors
the average bridge player is heir to
at the card table. Today's thriller
is no exception. Here, a bidding
blunder by North is more than
compensated for by the
opposition.
The bidding began normally.
South's one no-trump rebid was in
the Kaplan-Sheinwold style,
showing 15 to 17 points, the
equivalent of a strong no-trump
opening. North, however, hadn't
played this system before and
screwed things up by raising to
game. With his motley nine
points, he should have merely
raised to 2NT, which South,
holding a minimum, would have
passed.
South sobbed quietly when
dummy came down, expecting to
see at least another queen on
board. East took the opening lead
with his ace, and shot back his last
club, West winning with the ten as
South followed low both times.
West now began the defense's
downfall by pumping out a third
club, right into declarer's tenace,
East pitching a spade. Never one
to look a gift horse in the mouth,
South quickly led his low spade.
West balked, fumbled, and finally
played the king—another goof.
Finding nothing better to do, he
returned his singleton diamond,
East's ten forcing the king.
Still a long way from home,
declarer cashed his good club and
spade—East throwing a heart on

the club—and led a diamond to
dummy, not really expecting the
suit to break, but praying
anyhow. When West threw a
spade, South just shrugged his
shoulders and put up the queen.
He cashed his good spade queen,
and then took a long look at the
result.

It was a slim chance requiring
a little more cooperation from his
opponents —but declarer saw a
way home, and took it. He led a
small heart off dummy, and when
East (unfortunately for him)
played low, it was all over. South
grabbed his ace, shot back another
heart, and East was forced to win
with his king. He now had to lead
away from his guarded diamond
jack, and give declarer his ninth
and game-going trick.
"Nice bid," South told his
partner, "but don't do it again.
