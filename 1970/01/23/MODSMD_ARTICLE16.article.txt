# The 						Dead Letter
## Return of the Dolly 
### 
Dear Mom and Dad,
It's about that time again—time
to surprise you by actually writing
a letter instead of calling. And I'm
not even asking for money. I'll use
the phone for that purpose.
I have no particular reason for
writing. Just thought it would be
a nice gesture. Things are
proceeding as usual. Like school is
school. Actually I have some good
courses, but with the tremendous
selection I had to choose from, I
should have good courses.
With the exception of school,
letter writing has been taking up
the major portion of my time.
Maybe it's because my column
involves writing letters, and I feel
I should keep in practice. It's
funny how people reacted to my
articles. I'll sign my name for
something, and a person will say,
"Oh, you're Neil Arnet. I read
your article today."
Women
Or I'll receive comments such
as "I like your first letter better.
It sounded more like you." One
girl who's a good friend of mine
said that I'd written about the
draft which interested men, and
about transfers which interested
that group, but nothing solely for
Stanford women. She suggested I
write about them as a group.
Wow! Like that's asking for
trouble. Let me explain why. You
see, last quarter an article

appeared in the Daily commenting
upon Stanford dollies and calling
them plastic. In succeeding issues
of the paper a rather interesting
dispute arose as to whether or not
there was any such thing as a
stereotyped plastic dolly.
Essentially, I'm not sure
whether I'm willing to risk life
and limb to venture my opinion
on this topic. Especially with my
thoughts it could be dangerous.
Three Classes
I'm trying to think of a way to
classify Stanford women to make
this easier. I guess that basically
there exist three general classes:
first, the true dollies; second, the
non-dollies (girls who either
couldn't make it as dollies or
didn't want to), and third, the
anti-dollies (girls who have
rejected the idea of the
unassuming feminine role, i.e., hip
girls and love generation types).
Obviously I think that dollies
do exist. The true dolly concept is
of an attractive girl, a rah-rah high
school cheerleader type who acts
"nice" when it benefits her, and
who later slaughters the guys in
the classroom. She seems to have
decided to continue enjoying in
Stanford the fun aspects of high
school while rejecting many or all
of the more broadening
possibilities of this university.
An important feature of the
dolly is that she's a bitch. Of

course, depending on the dolly,
this may result from the fact that
men outnumber women 5 to 2
giving the dolly a selection she'll
never have again once she leaves
Stanford.
Denials
One thing to remember is that
the word "dolly" depends on a
male definition. I've never met a
dolly who admitted to being one.
Usually she vehemently denies it
or laughs off the accusation. Yet I
could introduce one of these girls
to a group of guys and ten out of
ten would call her a dolly.
Then there's a "Me? No, I'm
not a dolly," dolly who
transferred here this fall and has a
boyfriend at her old school, a boy
here whom she claims is "just a
friend" and who dates anyone else
she has time for as long as she
doesn't try to kiss her. Like that
kind of shit is ridiculous. Sex, and
at the very least kissing, is fun t
desireable, and, most of all,
natural. Maybe I'll have to do a
review of Dr. Ellis' book Sex
Without Guilt to lend credence to
my point. Anyway, such remains
the nature of the dolly.
Male Counterparts
Before I close this topic let me
state that certainly I don't feel
that the dollies cause this
situation alone. Undoubtedly
there coexists a similar set of
classifications for the men,
something on the order of studs,
non-studs, and anti-studs. In
general, a widening polarization
exists between the studs and
dollies on the one hand and the
anti-studs and anti-dollies on the
other.
The anti-groups know where
they're at on this problem and
seemingly have solved it. But, for
the dollies, and for the studs, the
games go on. And the poor
monkeys in the middle, many of
whom seek for honest, workable
alternatives, slowly become a
silent minority.
Well, that's about it. I'll write
again soon. Right now I think I'll
call that redhead and see if she
wants to go live with me in a
commune.
Love.
Ncit
P.S. Just talked to an ex-non-dolly
(now married) who said she used
to hate ex-dollies because they
could just turn down all the
ex-studs who then felt so paranoid
that they didn't have the nerve to
call the ex-non-dollies for dates.
Result—a lot of ex-studs and
ex-non-dollies stayed home.
Amazing . . .

a letter instead of calling. And I'm
not even asking for money. I'll use
the phone for that purpose.
I have no particular reason for
writing. Just thought it would be
a nice gesture. Things are
proceeding as usual. Like school is
school. Actually I have some good
courses, but with the tremendous
selection I had to choose from, I
should have good courses.
With the exception of school,
letter writing has been taking up
the major portion of my time.
Maybe it's because my column
involves writing letters, and I feel
I should keep in practice. It's
funny how people reacted to my
articles. I'll sign my name for
something, and a person will say,
"Oh, you're Neil Arnet. I read
your article today."
Women
Or I'll receive comments such
as "I like your first letter better.
It sounded more like you." One
girl who's a good friend of mine
said that I'd written about the
draft which interested men, and
about transfers which interested
that group, but nothing solely for
Stanford women. She suggested I
write about them as a group.
Wow! Like that's asking for
trouble. Let me explain why. You
see, last quarter an article

appeared in the Daily commenting
upon Stanford dollies and calling
them plastic. In succeeding issues
of the paper a rather interesting
dispute arose as to whether or not
there was any such thing as a
stereotyped plastic dolly.
Essentially, I'm not sure
whether I'm willing to risk life
and limb to venture my opinion
on this topic. Especially with my
thoughts it could be dangerous.
Three Classes
I'm trying to think of a way to
classify Stanford women to make
this easier. I guess that basically
there exist three general classes:
first, the true dollies; second, the
non-dollies (girls who either
couldn't make it as dollies or
didn't want to), and third, the
anti-dollies (girls who have
rejected the idea of the
unassuming feminine role, i.e., hip
girls and love generation types).
Obviously I think that dollies
do exist. The true dolly concept is
of an attractive girl, a rah-rah high
school cheerleader type who acts
"nice" when it benefits her, and
who later slaughters the guys in
the classroom. She seems to have
decided to continue enjoying in
Stanford the fun aspects of high
school while rejecting many or all
of the more broadening
possibilities of this university.
An important feature of the
dolly is that she's a bitch. Of

course, depending on the dolly,
this may result from the fact that
men outnumber women 5 to 2
giving the dolly a selection she'll
never have again once she leaves
Stanford.
Denials
One thing to remember is that
the word "dolly" depends on a
male definition. I've never met a
dolly who admitted to being one.
Usually she vehemently denies it
or laughs off the accusation. Yet I
could introduce one of these girls
to a group of guys and ten out of
ten would call her a dolly.
Then there's a "Me? No, I'm
not a dolly," dolly who
transferred here this fall and has a
boyfriend at her old school, a boy
here whom she claims is "just a
friend" and who dates anyone else
she has time for as long as she
doesn't try to kiss her. Like that
kind of shit is ridiculous. Sex, and
at the very least kissing, is fun t
desireable, and, most of all,
natural. Maybe I'll have to do a
review of Dr. Ellis' book Sex
Without Guilt to lend credence to
my point. Anyway, such remains
the nature of the dolly.
Male Counterparts
Before I close this topic let me
state that certainly I don't feel
that the dollies cause this
situation alone. Undoubtedly
there coexists a similar set of
classifications for the men,
something on the order of studs,
non-studs, and anti-studs. In
general, a widening polarization
exists between the studs and
dollies on the one hand and the
anti-studs and anti-dollies on the
other.
The anti-groups know where
they're at on this problem and
seemingly have solved it. But, for
the dollies, and for the studs, the
games go on. And the poor
monkeys in the middle, many of
whom seek for honest, workable
alternatives, slowly become a
silent minority.
Well, that's about it. I'll write
again soon. Right now I think I'll
call that redhead and see if she
wants to go live with me in a
commune.
Love.
Ncit
P.S. Just talked to an ex-non-dolly
(now married) who said she used
to hate ex-dollies because they
could just turn down all the
ex-studs who then felt so paranoid
that they didn't have the nerve to
call the ex-non-dollies for dates.
Result—a lot of ex-studs and
ex-non-dollies stayed home.
Amazing . . .

I have no particular reason for
writing. Just thought it would be
a nice gesture. Things are
proceeding as usual. Like school is
school. Actually I have some good
courses, but with the tremendous
selection I had to choose from, I
should have good courses.
With the exception of school,
letter writing has been taking up
the major portion of my time.
Maybe it's because my column
involves writing letters, and I feel
I should keep in practice. It's
funny how people reacted to my
articles. I'll sign my name for
something, and a person will say,
"Oh, you're Neil Arnet. I read
your article today."
Women
Or I'll receive comments such
as "I like your first letter better.
It sounded more like you." One
girl who's a good friend of mine
said that I'd written about the
draft which interested men, and
about transfers which interested
that group, but nothing solely for
Stanford women. She suggested I
write about them as a group.
Wow! Like that's asking for
trouble. Let me explain why. You
see, last quarter an article

appeared in the Daily commenting
upon Stanford dollies and calling
them plastic. In succeeding issues
of the paper a rather interesting
dispute arose as to whether or not
there was any such thing as a
stereotyped plastic dolly.
Essentially, I'm not sure
whether I'm willing to risk life
and limb to venture my opinion
on this topic. Especially with my
thoughts it could be dangerous.
Three Classes
I'm trying to think of a way to
classify Stanford women to make
this easier. I guess that basically
there exist three general classes:
first, the true dollies; second, the
non-dollies (girls who either
couldn't make it as dollies or
didn't want to), and third, the
anti-dollies (girls who have
rejected the idea of the
unassuming feminine role, i.e., hip
girls and love generation types).
Obviously I think that dollies
do exist. The true dolly concept is
of an attractive girl, a rah-rah high
school cheerleader type who acts
"nice" when it benefits her, and
who later slaughters the guys in
the classroom. She seems to have
decided to continue enjoying in
Stanford the fun aspects of high
school while rejecting many or all
of the more broadening
possibilities of this university.
An important feature of the
dolly is that she's a bitch. Of

course, depending on the dolly,
this may result from the fact that
men outnumber women 5 to 2
giving the dolly a selection she'll
never have again once she leaves
Stanford.
Denials
One thing to remember is that
the word "dolly" depends on a
male definition. I've never met a
dolly who admitted to being one.
Usually she vehemently denies it
or laughs off the accusation. Yet I
could introduce one of these girls
to a group of guys and ten out of
ten would call her a dolly.
Then there's a "Me? No, I'm
not a dolly," dolly who
transferred here this fall and has a
boyfriend at her old school, a boy
here whom she claims is "just a
friend" and who dates anyone else
she has time for as long as she
doesn't try to kiss her. Like that
kind of shit is ridiculous. Sex, and
at the very least kissing, is fun t
desireable, and, most of all,
natural. Maybe I'll have to do a
review of Dr. Ellis' book Sex
Without Guilt to lend credence to
my point. Anyway, such remains
the nature of the dolly.
Male Counterparts
Before I close this topic let me
state that certainly I don't feel
that the dollies cause this
situation alone. Undoubtedly
there coexists a similar set of
classifications for the men,
something on the order of studs,
non-studs, and anti-studs. In
general, a widening polarization
exists between the studs and
dollies on the one hand and the
anti-studs and anti-dollies on the
other.
The anti-groups know where
they're at on this problem and
seemingly have solved it. But, for
the dollies, and for the studs, the
games go on. And the poor
monkeys in the middle, many of
whom seek for honest, workable
alternatives, slowly become a
silent minority.
Well, that's about it. I'll write
again soon. Right now I think I'll
call that redhead and see if she
wants to go live with me in a
commune.
Love.
Ncit
P.S. Just talked to an ex-non-dolly
(now married) who said she used
to hate ex-dollies because they
could just turn down all the
ex-studs who then felt so paranoid
that they didn't have the nerve to
call the ex-non-dollies for dates.
Result—a lot of ex-studs and
ex-non-dollies stayed home.
Amazing . . .
Dear Mom and Dad,
It's about that time again—time
to surprise you by actually writing
a letter instead of calling. And I'm
not even asking for money. I'll use
the phone for that purpose.

a nice gesture. Things are
