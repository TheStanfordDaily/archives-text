# Production Of 'Chalk Circle’ Works Despite Time, Money
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
Every so often I see a play that
is a pleasure to review. "The
Caucasian Chalk Circle," offered
by The Company this week, is one
of those plays.
This is not to say that their
production of the Bertolt Brecht
extravaganza is perfect. To be
frank, there is so much that is
wrong with it that I could fill up
the page with a not too detailed
critique.
I am sure that any of the
several Brecht experts who inhabit
these woods would be only too
happy to criticize my critique,
and add a few pages of their own.
No, there's no doubt about it:
The Company production
definitely has serious problems.
But it also has something else.
I can't tell you just what that
something else is; I can only tell
you how I know that they've got
it. The Company has done
something in this production
that has happened very few times
anywhere in the last several
decades: Director John Davis has
mounted a very difficult play
using amateur actors and
technicians in a cavernous,
partially demolished basketball
pavillion, on a paper clip budget,
and he has staged the play
without cuts so that the running
time is a solid four hours (that's
240 minutes, my friends, longer
than Gone With The Wind,
Ben-Hur, etc.).

With all this, the amateurs, the
pavillion, the running time, he has
made it work. He has kept an
audience alert and interested for
four hours, even though said
audience was sprawled out on the
pavillion floor, which, let me
assure you, is very hard.
That's it. Really, there's
nothing else which could mean as
much. Here is a four hour play
which is good enough that you
will enjoy it even though you
are kept in perpetual physical
discomfort. What more could you
ask?
Okay. I know what more you
could ask. Here's a rundown for
the traditionalists:
I mentioned above that there
was much wrong with the
production. Well, there is, and I
guess I should give you a hint as
to some of the more distressing
points. Certainly the weakest link
in this four hour chain is the
acting, which with rare
exceptions, is mediocre or less.
With a cast of perhaps 45,1 won't
attempt to go into detail, but I
will single out some of the rarer
exceptions.
Matthew Schneiderman, Nan
Bray and Bill Mahone were
consistently good, and
occasionally brilliant. Miss Bray
had to play almost all of her
scenes with a seventeen-month-old
baby and she managed to hold her
own in spite of the fact. If she had
been only a little more coarse, a
little less pretty, she would have

been perfect. (The baby, by the
way, was Miss Andrea U'Ren, who
played the infant prince Michael
Abashwili in drag. Another
brilliant performance.)
From a technical standpoint,
the show looked very rough.
Poverty cried out from all sides.
This is a show which should cost
several thousands of dollars to be
done right. The Company, I am
sure* did not have that kind of
money.
The Company has never been
known for cowardice. Last year
they produced Marat/Sade and
The Devils. Now The Caucasian
Chalk Circle. Next quarter —God
help us all—it will be King Lear!
Now, that should be interesting!
