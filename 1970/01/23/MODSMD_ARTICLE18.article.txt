Marilyn Home, the great American mezzo-soprano, will appear in
her debut recital in the Bay Area, on Saturday evening, January 24, at
8:30, at the Masonic Auditorium. Her scheduled program includes
two arias from Purcell's opera, "The Indian Queen," two arias from
Handel's "Semele," and songs of Schubert, Rossini, Debussy, and
Richard Strauss.
Miss Home, who is married to conductor Henry Lewis, has won her
greatest triumps in opera, particularly in the "bel canto" repertoire of
such composers as Ponchielli, Donizetti, Bellini and Rossini.
A native Californian, Miss Home has appeared in opera houses
around the world, including the famous "La Scala" in Milan. She
made her debut at the latter house at the same time as the New York
City Opera's diva, Beverly Sills.
The opera was Rossini's "The Siege of Corinth" and it includes a
twenty minute aria for the mezzo-soprano. Marilyn Home's
stupendous performance of this aria nearly stole the show from the
brilliant Miss Sills.
Miss Home's accomplishments in the recital field are less well
known, but her beautiful voice and excellent musicianship promise a
rewarding evening. The concert is one of the features of the San
Francisco Music Series of John Kornfeld Associates. Student tickets
may be obtained by calling 781-7833, in San Francisco.

A new all-black cast has brought a flush of vitality to the
Fantasticks at the Ghiradelli Theater. The Fantasticks is a
light-hearted musical fantasy of teenage love overcoming parental
discouragement. The action is a mixture of outright buffoonery and
warm yet not cloying romanticism. The new cast gives the script the
zany life it thrives on, and which it was beginning to lose from the
long-running all-white cast.
The black cast is booked for a short time only. This weekend may
well be their last stand. Call Tresidder Box Office for ticket
information.
