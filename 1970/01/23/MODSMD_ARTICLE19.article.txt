# Times A-Changin'
## Activist Trends Hit Palo Alto High 
### JANE CORRIGAN 
Slow change is coming to Paly
High. Students continue to take
unofficial days off, but it's more
likely that they'll be leafletting
for the Moratorium than heading
to the city with friends.
After-school activities include not
only athletic pursuits but lectures
by speakers ranging from Dr. Paul
Ehrlich to Lenny Siegel or even
the only black member of the Ku
Klux Klan. The traditional school
paper is now supplemented by
"The Radical Rag," an
underground publication.
Palo Alto Senior High School is
definitely caught up in trend of
increasing concern with political
and social issues on the high
school campus. Although this
concern is most obvious in the
activist element of the student
body, it seems to be present to
some degree in nearly all students.
George Millar, the principal of
Palo Alto High, feels strongly that
the current interest in politics is
not limited only to radical
students. He cites the recent
School Board decision to allow
political organizations on campus
as an example.
"Meaningful pressure was not
from the radical student groups. It
was representatives of the
legitimate student government
who were responsible for writing
the policy. I don't think the
Board would have responded to
the radicals."
Students Conservative
"The majority of students are
conservative in terms of political
outlook. I think they tend to
reject radical groups, to resent the
actions of this small group."
Millar estimated that about 1%
of the student body belonged to
the Radical Student Union, which
he felt was handicapped by little
unity of thought among its
members.
"Kids come into the
organization for all kinds of
reasons and support different
causes —Grass Roots, the
Moratorium, Conservation,
student rights. Some are
revolutionary in their thinking,
some children demanding
attention. Some are very serious
students who are looking for
legitimate social change."
School Discipline
Millar faces the same difficulty
as most administrators in
determining the role of authority
within the school. The problem is
that we just don't know where to
draw the line. Different elements
in the community draw different
lines concerning student rights,
and this presents a friction which
will continue for years."
"But communication is
generally perceived to be
reasonably open. Both sides try
pretty hard to develop an
atmosphere of mutual trust.
Incidents do occur which make it
hard to maintain. There have been
times when they see the
administration acting in an
arbitrary and capricious way,
when they have done things we :
see as being breaches of faith."
Relations with Stanford
Millar is happy with effects of
closeness to the Stanford campus.

"The university adds new
dimensions, opens up whole new
avenues to explore. The nearness
of the university is definitely a
very positive factor."
Joe Simititian, the Student
Body President and one of those
responsible for the new political
organization policy, feels that the
change will actually have few
direct effects.
"The R.S.U. is now an
on-campus, rather than
off-campus group, and during
election years there'll probably be
Teen Republicans and Teen
Democrats. In general, the kids
are fairly moderate in their views.
Last year after the S.R.I,
demonstrations, a survey was
taken of the student body here.
About 45% didn't care about
what S.R.I, was doing and
disapproved of the
demonstrations, 50% disapproved
of both S.R.I, and the
demonstrations, and only 5%
disapproved of S.R.I, and
supported the actions of the
demonstrators."
Fair Deal
Simitian feels that the current
administration has the right
attitude towards the students.
"Millar will give anyone a straight
deal—even the radicals. Some of
them have real changes in mind,
some are just looking for trouble,
and that faction has a real
problem, because the
administration is usually fair and
quite liberal."
Howard Besser, one of the
heads of the R.S.U. has a different
view of the situation. "This is a
liberal administration—they try
and make things as bearable as
possible. Mr. Millar as an
individual is pretty liberal, but
there are only certain things he
can do. He's forced by the School
Board and Concerned Citizens for

Education to act the role of an
administrator to enforce laws
which are repressive to high
school students."
One such law is the California
state law which prohibits the
distribution of any partisan
political leaflets on high school
campuses. Part of the R.S.U.'s
program includes the demand for
the-right to print and distribute
material without regard to its
political or moral content.
Radical Activity
According to Besser, the
R.S.U. is operating on two levels.
''To be an on-campus
organization, you have to sacrifice
some things we don't want to
sacrifice. So were functioning in
two parts.

"As an official, organized,
on-campus group, we're
presenting political and social
issues to the students, getting
them involved in the Moratorium,
Grass Roots. As an off-campus,
theoretically unorganized group,
we will continue to print the
paper ("The Radical Rag") and
leaflet."
"We're not affiliated with any
other organization, but some
members of R.S.U. are friendly
with Stanford S.D.S. people we
have good connections. But most
high school students are resentful
of college students who come in
and organize."
Besser feels that the low
attendance at R.S.U. activities is
not the fault of the organization
itself. "Activities are not well
attended no matter who sponsors
them. People tend to come to
school and then get out as fast as
possible."
Draft Counselling
Kurt Johnson is an English
teacher at Paly as well as the head
of the newly formed draft
counselling service. "Students
initiated the program. A group
came to Mr. Millar with the
proposal and he felt there was a
need. Students have a right to
know about the draft, since it is
one of the most important
decisions they will make. If there
is counselling on jobs and colleges,
why not the draft?"
Johnson took a three month
course in draft counselling offered
by Allan Strain, draft counselor at
Stanford, and hopes to get the
program going second semester of
this year. He sees his main role in
presenting information to the
student who has already made up
his mind.
"My job is not to say 'These
are the alternatives to get out of
the draft' but 'Can you live with
yourself in jail or Canada? Can
you live with yourself in the
Armed Forces?' If they decide
they can't. I can give them

information, talk about things I
know, make them aware of the
alternatives."
Political Concern
Johnson had very positive
views on the nature of the
students he teaches at Paly. "This
growing political awareness shows
up in their classes. They're more
concerned with their work, more
insistent that it relate. There's no
toleration for an assignment just
because it is an assignment—they
want to know how what they are
writing will relate to them
personally. They will get deeply
involved in things which are
relevant, do nearly anything with
enthusiasm."
"The most positive thing about
these kids is that regardless of
whether they are politically
aware, radical or conservative,
they feel that they must learn to
communicate with other people.
Despite the differing points of
view, there's little conflict in the
classroom. They're all willing to
listen to each other. This is one
virtue which is found more in the
high schools than the
colleges—there's little of the
polarity which prevents
communication."

"The Radical Rag," an
underground publication.
Palo Alto Senior High School is
definitely caught up in trend of
increasing concern with political
and social issues on the high
school campus. Although this
concern is most obvious in the
activist element of the student
body, it seems to be present to
some degree in nearly all students.
George Millar, the principal of
Palo Alto High, feels strongly that
the current interest in politics is
not limited only to radical
students. He cites the recent
School Board decision to allow
political organizations on campus
as an example.
"Meaningful pressure was not
from the radical student groups. It
was representatives of the
legitimate student government
who were responsible for writing
the policy. I don't think the
Board would have responded to
the radicals."
Students Conservative
"The majority of students are
conservative in terms of political
outlook. I think they tend to
reject radical groups, to resent the
actions of this small group."
Millar estimated that about 1%
of the student body belonged to
the Radical Student Union, which
he felt was handicapped by little
unity of thought among its
members.
"Kids come into the
organization for all kinds of
reasons and support different
causes —Grass Roots, the
Moratorium, Conservation,
student rights. Some are
revolutionary in their thinking,
some children demanding
attention. Some are very serious
students who are looking for
legitimate social change."
School Discipline
Millar faces the same difficulty
as most administrators in
determining the role of authority
within the school. The problem is
that we just don't know where to
draw the line. Different elements
in the community draw different
lines concerning student rights,
and this presents a friction which
will continue for years."
"But communication is
generally perceived to be
reasonably open. Both sides try
pretty hard to develop an
atmosphere of mutual trust.
Incidents do occur which make it
hard to maintain. There have been
times when they see the
administration acting in an
arbitrary and capricious way,
when they have done things we :
see as being breaches of faith."
Relations with Stanford
Millar is happy with effects of
closeness to the Stanford campus.

"The university adds new
dimensions, opens up whole new
avenues to explore. The nearness
of the university is definitely a
very positive factor."
Joe Simititian, the Student
Body President and one of those
responsible for the new political
organization policy, feels that the
change will actually have few
direct effects.
"The R.S.U. is now an
on-campus, rather than
off-campus group, and during
election years there'll probably be
Teen Republicans and Teen
Democrats. In general, the kids
are fairly moderate in their views.
Last year after the S.R.I,
demonstrations, a survey was
taken of the student body here.
About 45% didn't care about
what S.R.I, was doing and
disapproved of the
demonstrations, 50% disapproved
of both S.R.I, and the
demonstrations, and only 5%
disapproved of S.R.I, and
supported the actions of the
demonstrators."
Fair Deal
Simitian feels that the current
administration has the right
attitude towards the students.
"Millar will give anyone a straight
deal—even the radicals. Some of
them have real changes in mind,
some are just looking for trouble,
and that faction has a real
problem, because the
administration is usually fair and
quite liberal."
Howard Besser, one of the
heads of the R.S.U. has a different
view of the situation. "This is a
liberal administration—they try
and make things as bearable as
possible. Mr. Millar as an
individual is pretty liberal, but
there are only certain things he
can do. He's forced by the School
Board and Concerned Citizens for

Education to act the role of an
administrator to enforce laws
which are repressive to high
school students."
One such law is the California
state law which prohibits the
distribution of any partisan
political leaflets on high school
campuses. Part of the R.S.U.'s
program includes the demand for
the-right to print and distribute
material without regard to its
political or moral content.
Radical Activity
According to Besser, the
R.S.U. is operating on two levels.
''To be an on-campus
organization, you have to sacrifice
some things we don't want to
sacrifice. So were functioning in
two parts.

"As an official, organized,
on-campus group, we're
presenting political and social
issues to the students, getting
them involved in the Moratorium,
Grass Roots. As an off-campus,
theoretically unorganized group,
we will continue to print the
paper ("The Radical Rag") and
leaflet."
"We're not affiliated with any
other organization, but some
members of R.S.U. are friendly
with Stanford S.D.S. people we
have good connections. But most
high school students are resentful
of college students who come in
and organize."
Besser feels that the low
attendance at R.S.U. activities is
not the fault of the organization
itself. "Activities are not well
attended no matter who sponsors
them. People tend to come to
school and then get out as fast as
possible."
Draft Counselling
Kurt Johnson is an English
teacher at Paly as well as the head
of the newly formed draft
counselling service. "Students
initiated the program. A group
came to Mr. Millar with the
proposal and he felt there was a
need. Students have a right to
know about the draft, since it is
one of the most important
decisions they will make. If there
is counselling on jobs and colleges,
why not the draft?"
Johnson took a three month
course in draft counselling offered
by Allan Strain, draft counselor at
Stanford, and hopes to get the
program going second semester of
this year. He sees his main role in
presenting information to the
student who has already made up
his mind.
"My job is not to say 'These
are the alternatives to get out of
the draft' but 'Can you live with
yourself in jail or Canada? Can
you live with yourself in the
Armed Forces?' If they decide
they can't. I can give them

information, talk about things I
know, make them aware of the
alternatives."
Political Concern
Johnson had very positive
views on the nature of the
students he teaches at Paly. "This
growing political awareness shows
up in their classes. They're more
concerned with their work, more
insistent that it relate. There's no
toleration for an assignment just
because it is an assignment—they
want to know how what they are
writing will relate to them
personally. They will get deeply
involved in things which are
relevant, do nearly anything with
enthusiasm."
"The most positive thing about
these kids is that regardless of
whether they are politically
aware, radical or conservative,
they feel that they must learn to
communicate with other people.
Despite the differing points of
view, there's little conflict in the
classroom. They're all willing to
listen to each other. This is one
virtue which is found more in the
high schools than the
colleges—there's little of the
polarity which prevents
communication."

School Board decision to allow
political organizations on campus
as an example.
"Meaningful pressure was not
from the radical student groups. It
was representatives of the
legitimate student government
who were responsible for writing
the policy. I don't think the
Board would have responded to
the radicals."
Students Conservative
"The majority of students are
conservative in terms of political
outlook. I think they tend to
reject radical groups, to resent the
actions of this small group."
Millar estimated that about 1%
of the student body belonged to
the Radical Student Union, which
he felt was handicapped by little
unity of thought among its
members.
"Kids come into the
organization for all kinds of
reasons and support different
causes —Grass Roots, the
Moratorium, Conservation,
student rights. Some are
revolutionary in their thinking,
some children demanding
attention. Some are very serious
students who are looking for
legitimate social change."
School Discipline
Millar faces the same difficulty
as most administrators in
determining the role of authority
within the school. The problem is
that we just don't know where to
draw the line. Different elements
in the community draw different
lines concerning student rights,
and this presents a friction which
will continue for years."
"But communication is
generally perceived to be
reasonably open. Both sides try
pretty hard to develop an
atmosphere of mutual trust.
Incidents do occur which make it
hard to maintain. There have been
times when they see the
administration acting in an
arbitrary and capricious way,
when they have done things we :
see as being breaches of faith."
Relations with Stanford
Millar is happy with effects of
closeness to the Stanford campus.

"The university adds new
dimensions, opens up whole new
avenues to explore. The nearness
of the university is definitely a
very positive factor."
Joe Simititian, the Student
Body President and one of those
responsible for the new political
organization policy, feels that the
change will actually have few
direct effects.
"The R.S.U. is now an
on-campus, rather than
off-campus group, and during
election years there'll probably be
Teen Republicans and Teen
Democrats. In general, the kids
are fairly moderate in their views.
Last year after the S.R.I,
demonstrations, a survey was
taken of the student body here.
About 45% didn't care about
what S.R.I, was doing and
disapproved of the
demonstrations, 50% disapproved
of both S.R.I, and the
demonstrations, and only 5%
disapproved of S.R.I, and
supported the actions of the
demonstrators."
Fair Deal
Simitian feels that the current
administration has the right
attitude towards the students.
"Millar will give anyone a straight
deal—even the radicals. Some of
them have real changes in mind,
some are just looking for trouble,
and that faction has a real
problem, because the
administration is usually fair and
quite liberal."
Howard Besser, one of the
heads of the R.S.U. has a different
view of the situation. "This is a
liberal administration—they try
and make things as bearable as
possible. Mr. Millar as an
individual is pretty liberal, but
there are only certain things he
can do. He's forced by the School
Board and Concerned Citizens for

Education to act the role of an
administrator to enforce laws
which are repressive to high
school students."
One such law is the California
state law which prohibits the
distribution of any partisan
political leaflets on high school
campuses. Part of the R.S.U.'s
program includes the demand for
the-right to print and distribute
material without regard to its
political or moral content.
Radical Activity
According to Besser, the
R.S.U. is operating on two levels.
''To be an on-campus
organization, you have to sacrifice
some things we don't want to
sacrifice. So were functioning in
two parts.

"As an official, organized,
on-campus group, we're
presenting political and social
issues to the students, getting
them involved in the Moratorium,
Grass Roots. As an off-campus,
theoretically unorganized group,
we will continue to print the
paper ("The Radical Rag") and
leaflet."
"We're not affiliated with any
other organization, but some
members of R.S.U. are friendly
with Stanford S.D.S. people we
have good connections. But most
high school students are resentful
of college students who come in
and organize."
Besser feels that the low
attendance at R.S.U. activities is
not the fault of the organization
itself. "Activities are not well
attended no matter who sponsors
them. People tend to come to
school and then get out as fast as
possible."
Draft Counselling
Kurt Johnson is an English
teacher at Paly as well as the head
of the newly formed draft
counselling service. "Students
initiated the program. A group
came to Mr. Millar with the
proposal and he felt there was a
need. Students have a right to
know about the draft, since it is
one of the most important
decisions they will make. If there
is counselling on jobs and colleges,
why not the draft?"
Johnson took a three month
course in draft counselling offered
by Allan Strain, draft counselor at
Stanford, and hopes to get the
program going second semester of
this year. He sees his main role in
presenting information to the
student who has already made up
his mind.
"My job is not to say 'These
are the alternatives to get out of
the draft' but 'Can you live with
yourself in jail or Canada? Can
you live with yourself in the
Armed Forces?' If they decide
they can't. I can give them

information, talk about things I
know, make them aware of the
alternatives."
Political Concern
Johnson had very positive
views on the nature of the
students he teaches at Paly. "This
growing political awareness shows
up in their classes. They're more
concerned with their work, more
insistent that it relate. There's no
toleration for an assignment just
because it is an assignment—they
want to know how what they are
writing will relate to them
personally. They will get deeply
involved in things which are
relevant, do nearly anything with
enthusiasm."
"The most positive thing about
these kids is that regardless of
whether they are politically
aware, radical or conservative,
they feel that they must learn to
communicate with other people.
Despite the differing points of
view, there's little conflict in the
classroom. They're all willing to
listen to each other. This is one
virtue which is found more in the
high schools than the
colleges—there's little of the
polarity which prevents
communication."


TESTING WEEK draws students outdoors at Paly High
Slow change is coming to Paly
High. Students continue to take
unofficial days off, but it's more
likely that they'll be leafletting
for the Moratorium than heading
to the city with friends.
After-school activities include not
only athletic pursuits but lectures
by speakers ranging from Dr. Paul
Ehrlich to Lenny Siegel or even
the only black member of the Ku
Klux Klan. The traditional school
paper is now supplemented by
"The Radical Rag," an
underground publication.
Palo Alto Senior High School is
definitely caught up in trend of
increasing concern with political
and social issues on the high
school campus. Although this
concern is most obvious in the
activist element of the student
body, it seems to be present to
some degree in nearly all students.

of the student body belonged to
the Radical Student Union, which
he felt was handicapped by little
unity of thought among its
members.
"Kids come into the
organization for all kinds of
reasons and support different
causes —Grass Roots, the
Moratorium, Conservation,
student rights. Some are
revolutionary in their thinking,
some children demanding
attention. Some are very serious
students who are looking for
legitimate social change."
School Discipline
Millar faces the same difficulty
as most administrators in
determining the role of authority
within the school. The problem is
that we just don't know where to
draw the line. Different elements
in the community draw different
lines concerning student rights,
and this presents a friction which
will continue for years."
"But communication is
generally perceived to be
reasonably open. Both sides try
pretty hard to develop an
atmosphere of mutual trust.
Incidents do occur which make it
hard to maintain. There have been
times when they see the
administration acting in an
arbitrary and capricious way,
when they have done things we :
see as being breaches of faith."
Relations with Stanford
Millar is happy with effects of
closeness to the Stanford campus.

"The university adds new
dimensions, opens up whole new
avenues to explore. The nearness
of the university is definitely a
very positive factor."
Joe Simititian, the Student
Body President and one of those
responsible for the new political
organization policy, feels that the
change will actually have few
direct effects.
"The R.S.U. is now an
on-campus, rather than
off-campus group, and during
election years there'll probably be
Teen Republicans and Teen
Democrats. In general, the kids
are fairly moderate in their views.
Last year after the S.R.I,
demonstrations, a survey was
taken of the student body here.
About 45% didn't care about
what S.R.I, was doing and
disapproved of the
demonstrations, 50% disapproved
of both S.R.I, and the
demonstrations, and only 5%
disapproved of S.R.I, and
supported the actions of the
demonstrators."
Fair Deal
Simitian feels that the current
administration has the right
attitude towards the students.
"Millar will give anyone a straight
deal—even the radicals. Some of
them have real changes in mind,
some are just looking for trouble,
and that faction has a real
problem, because the
administration is usually fair and
quite liberal."
Howard Besser, one of the
heads of the R.S.U. has a different
view of the situation. "This is a
liberal administration—they try
and make things as bearable as
possible. Mr. Millar as an
individual is pretty liberal, but
there are only certain things he
can do. He's forced by the School
Board and Concerned Citizens for

Education to act the role of an
administrator to enforce laws
which are repressive to high
school students."
One such law is the California
state law which prohibits the
distribution of any partisan
political leaflets on high school
campuses. Part of the R.S.U.'s
program includes the demand for
the-right to print and distribute
material without regard to its
political or moral content.
Radical Activity
According to Besser, the
R.S.U. is operating on two levels.
''To be an on-campus
organization, you have to sacrifice
some things we don't want to
sacrifice. So were functioning in
two parts.

"As an official, organized,
on-campus group, we're
presenting political and social
issues to the students, getting
them involved in the Moratorium,
Grass Roots. As an off-campus,
theoretically unorganized group,
we will continue to print the
paper ("The Radical Rag") and
leaflet."
"We're not affiliated with any
other organization, but some
members of R.S.U. are friendly
with Stanford S.D.S. people we
have good connections. But most
high school students are resentful
of college students who come in
and organize."
Besser feels that the low
attendance at R.S.U. activities is
not the fault of the organization
itself. "Activities are not well
attended no matter who sponsors
them. People tend to come to
school and then get out as fast as
possible."
Draft Counselling
Kurt Johnson is an English
teacher at Paly as well as the head
of the newly formed draft
counselling service. "Students
initiated the program. A group
came to Mr. Millar with the
proposal and he felt there was a
need. Students have a right to
know about the draft, since it is
one of the most important
decisions they will make. If there
is counselling on jobs and colleges,
why not the draft?"
Johnson took a three month
course in draft counselling offered
by Allan Strain, draft counselor at
Stanford, and hopes to get the
program going second semester of
this year. He sees his main role in
presenting information to the
student who has already made up
his mind.
"My job is not to say 'These
are the alternatives to get out of
the draft' but 'Can you live with
yourself in jail or Canada? Can
you live with yourself in the
Armed Forces?' If they decide
they can't. I can give them

information, talk about things I
know, make them aware of the
alternatives."
Political Concern
Johnson had very positive
views on the nature of the
students he teaches at Paly. "This
growing political awareness shows
up in their classes. They're more
concerned with their work, more
insistent that it relate. There's no
toleration for an assignment just
because it is an assignment—they
want to know how what they are
writing will relate to them
personally. They will get deeply
involved in things which are
relevant, do nearly anything with
enthusiasm."
"The most positive thing about
these kids is that regardless of
whether they are politically
aware, radical or conservative,
they feel that they must learn to
communicate with other people.
Despite the differing points of
view, there's little conflict in the
classroom. They're all willing to
listen to each other. This is one
virtue which is found more in the
high schools than the
colleges—there's little of the
polarity which prevents
communication."


TESTING WEEK draws students outdoors at Paly High
Slow change is coming to Paly
High. Students continue to take
unofficial days off, but it's more
likely that they'll be leafletting
for the Moratorium than heading
to the city with friends.
After-school activities include not
only athletic pursuits but lectures
by speakers ranging from Dr. Paul
Ehrlich to Lenny Siegel or even
the only black member of the Ku
Klux Klan. The traditional school
paper is now supplemented by
"The Radical Rag," an
underground publication.
Palo Alto Senior High School is
definitely caught up in trend of
increasing concern with political
and social issues on the high
school campus. Although this
concern is most obvious in the
activist element of the student
body, it seems to be present to
some degree in nearly all students.
George Millar, the principal of
Palo Alto High, feels strongly that
the current interest in politics is
not limited only to radical
students. He cites the recent
School Board decision to allow
political organizations on campus
as an example.
"Meaningful pressure was not
from the radical student groups. It
was representatives of the
legitimate student government
who were responsible for writing
the policy. I don't think the
Board would have responded to
the radicals."
Students Conservative
"The majority of students are
conservative in terms of political
outlook. I think they tend to
reject radical groups, to resent the
actions of this small group."
Millar estimated that about 1%
of the student body belonged to
the Radical Student Union, which
he felt was handicapped by little
unity of thought among its
members.
"Kids come into the
organization for all kinds of
reasons and support different
causes —Grass Roots, the
