# ASSU Drops Braunstein, Attacks Hasty ROTC Decision
## 
### PHIL REVZIN TINA COOPER 
The ASSU Student Senate last
night overwhelmingly passed a
resolution which in effect
withdrew Senate support for Yale
Braunstein's nomination to the
Finance Committee. The heavily
attended meeting also endorsed an
emphatic objection to the manner
in which President Pitzer pushed
the ROTC issue through the
Faculty Senate.
The resolution, introduced by
ASSU President Pat Shea,
reaffirmed Senate support "for
those students duly nominated for
Trustees' Committees." It went
on to list all students
nominated—except those names
for the Finance Committee.
Shea's resolution objected to
the President's power to deny a
nominated student a position on
any committee; however, it asked
the Nominations Committee to
submit two more nominees to the
Finance Committee for the
Senate's approval.
Shea defined his view of the
choice for the Senate by saying,
"We have a basic choice here
between change later and a
symbolic stance.
"It is important," he went on,
"that the Senate get off its
haunches and get moving."
Stop Using Mouth
Senator Ann Kimball added a
plea that "the Senate start using
its mind and stop using its
mouth," and requested that the
resolution be passed.
Seantor Bob Cory, however,
charged that the resolution
"begged the issue of Yale
Braunstein."

He added, "More important, it
violates the principle which we
affirmed last week—that the
students have the right to place
the representatives they nominate
on committees."
When questioned after the
meeting, Braunstein said, "I am
considering reapplying for the
position."
The Senate last night also took
a stand on ROTC, endorsing
several serious objections to the
method in which it was approved
by the Faculty Senate.
Owen Blank, who had gone to
the Faculty Senate meeting for
Chairman Dave Edwards, reported
that Pitzer's proposal on ROTC
was accepted 23-13. He added
that moves to delay the vote for a
week and to have a roll-call vote
were both defeated.
He went on to give three
objections to the Faculty Senate's
action.
Objects To Voting Procedure
"I object to the lack of a
roll-call vote. Also, the action was
taken hastily and without due
consideration."
"Most seriously," he charged,
"relevant reports and documents
were not distributed to the
University community. People
were very poorly informed."
Senator John Schoch moved
that the report, "emphatically
including the objections made by
Owen Blank," be accepted and
endorsed by the Senate. His
motion passed enthusiastically.
In another matter, the Senate
expressed doubt that conservative
student Roger Reed had the right

to sign contracts for Political
Union speakers in the name of the
Associated Students.
Reed signed contracts for
about $3500 last quarter for
speakers, without the prior
approval of the Student Financial
Manager, whose signature is
required for such matters.
Following lengthy debate, the
Senate sent to committee the
question of the Senate's liability
for the contracts signed by Reed,
president of the campus Young
Republicans.
Swift Investigation
The Senate passed a resolution
calling for Student Financial
Manager David Swift to
investigate the matter and
investigate proceedings before the
Stanford Judicial Council if he
feels it necessary.
The legislature also passed a
measure calling for the University

to investigate whether court
proceedings should be brought
against Reed.
The Political Union currently
has a debt of $3497.00, with a
possibility of more outstanding
bills, according to Swift. This
figure includes a $1500 contract
for Harrison Salisbury, and a
$2120 contract for Barry
Goldwater, but does not include
money for William F. Buckley.
Cory, a member of the Political
Union board, told the Senate that
it was his understanding that
Buckley's appearance was to be
financed by private donations.
Seen One Contract
Swift pointed out that he had
only seen one contract, for
Goldwater, and that he had seen
this contract for the first time
yesterday.
Swift added that the ASSU
by-laws state that all contracts for
which the ASSU may be held
liable must be signed by the
student financial manager. As it
stands now, he continued, the
contracts are between Roger
Reed, an adult, and the
respective agencies. Swift said that
a legal opinion he had received
indicated that Reed, not the
ASSU was liable for the contracts.
Cory said that as a member of
the Political Union board, he
realized that it was necessary to
book speakers well in advance.
These contracts were signed by
Reed last summer, he said. Cory
added, however, that Swift was
present during the summer, and
Reed could have gone to him with
the matters.

investigate the matter and
investigate proceedings before the
Stanford Judicial Council if he
feels it necessary.
The legislature also passed a
measure calling for the University

to investigate whether court
proceedings should be brought
against Reed.
The Political Union currently
has a debt of $3497.00, with a
possibility of more outstanding
bills, according to Swift. This
figure includes a $1500 contract
for Harrison Salisbury, and a
$2120 contract for Barry
Goldwater, but does not include
money for William F. Buckley.
Cory, a member of the Political
Union board, told the Senate that
it was his understanding that
Buckley's appearance was to be
financed by private donations.
Seen One Contract
Swift pointed out that he had
only seen one contract, for
Goldwater, and that he had seen
this contract for the first time
yesterday.
Swift added that the ASSU
by-laws state that all contracts for
which the ASSU may be held
liable must be signed by the
student financial manager. As it
stands now, he continued, the
contracts are between Roger
Reed, an adult, and the
respective agencies. Swift said that
a legal opinion he had received
indicated that Reed, not the
ASSU was liable for the contracts.
Cory said that as a member of
the Political Union board, he
realized that it was necessary to
book speakers well in advance.
These contracts were signed by
Reed last summer, he said. Cory
added, however, that Swift was
present during the summer, and
Reed could have gone to him with
the matters.
The ASSU Student Senate last
night overwhelmingly passed a
resolution which in effect
withdrew Senate support for Yale
Braunstein's nomination to the
Finance Committee. The heavily
attended meeting also endorsed an
emphatic objection to the manner
in which President Pitzer pushed
the ROTC issue through the
Faculty Senate.
The resolution, introduced by
ASSU President Pat Shea,
reaffirmed Senate support "for
those students duly nominated for
Trustees' Committees." It went
on to list all students
nominated—except those names
for the Finance Committee.
Shea's resolution objected to
the President's power to deny a
nominated student a position on
any committee; however, it asked
the Nominations Committee to
submit two more nominees to the
Finance Committee for the
Senate's approval.
Shea defined his view of the
choice for the Senate by saying,
"We have a basic choice here
between change later and a
symbolic stance.
"It is important," he went on,
"that the Senate get off its
haunches and get moving."
Stop Using Mouth
Senator Ann Kimball added a
plea that "the Senate start using
its mind and stop using its
mouth," and requested that the
resolution be passed.
Seantor Bob Cory, however,
charged that the resolution
"begged the issue of Yale
Braunstein."

He added, "More important, it
violates the principle which we
affirmed last week—that the
students have the right to place
the representatives they nominate
on committees."
When questioned after the
meeting, Braunstein said, "I am
considering reapplying for the
position."
The Senate last night also took
a stand on ROTC, endorsing
several serious objections to the
method in which it was approved
by the Faculty Senate.
Owen Blank, who had gone to
the Faculty Senate meeting for
Chairman Dave Edwards, reported
that Pitzer's proposal on ROTC
was accepted 23-13. He added
that moves to delay the vote for a
week and to have a roll-call vote
were both defeated.
He went on to give three
objections to the Faculty Senate's
action.
Objects To Voting Procedure
"I object to the lack of a
roll-call vote. Also, the action was
taken hastily and without due
consideration."
"Most seriously," he charged,
"relevant reports and documents
were not distributed to the
University community. People
were very poorly informed."
Senator John Schoch moved
that the report, "emphatically
including the objections made by
Owen Blank," be accepted and
endorsed by the Senate. His
motion passed enthusiastically.
In another matter, the Senate
expressed doubt that conservative
student Roger Reed had the right

to sign contracts for Political
Union speakers in the name of the
Associated Students.
Reed signed contracts for
about $3500 last quarter for
speakers, without the prior
approval of the Student Financial
Manager, whose signature is
required for such matters.
Following lengthy debate, the
Senate sent to committee the
question of the Senate's liability
for the contracts signed by Reed,
president of the campus Young
Republicans.

several serious objections to the
method in which it was approved
by the Faculty Senate.
Owen Blank, who had gone to
the Faculty Senate meeting for
Chairman Dave Edwards, reported
that Pitzer's proposal on ROTC
was accepted 23-13. He added
that moves to delay the vote for a
week and to have a roll-call vote
were both defeated.
He went on to give three
objections to the Faculty Senate's
action.
Objects To Voting Procedure
"I object to the lack of a
roll-call vote. Also, the action was
taken hastily and without due
consideration."
"Most seriously," he charged,
"relevant reports and documents
were not distributed to the
University community. People
were very poorly informed."
Senator John Schoch moved
that the report, "emphatically
including the objections made by
Owen Blank," be accepted and
endorsed by the Senate. His
motion passed enthusiastically.
In another matter, the Senate
expressed doubt that conservative
student Roger Reed had the right

to sign contracts for Political
Union speakers in the name of the
Associated Students.
Reed signed contracts for
about $3500 last quarter for
speakers, without the prior
approval of the Student Financial
Manager, whose signature is
required for such matters.
Following lengthy debate, the
Senate sent to committee the
question of the Senate's liability
for the contracts signed by Reed,
president of the campus Young
Republicans.
Swift Investigation
The Senate passed a resolution
calling for Student Financial
Manager David Swift to
investigate the matter and
investigate proceedings before the
Stanford Judicial Council if he
feels it necessary.
The legislature also passed a
measure calling for the University

to investigate whether court
proceedings should be brought
against Reed.
The Political Union currently
has a debt of $3497.00, with a
possibility of more outstanding
bills, according to Swift. This
figure includes a $1500 contract
for Harrison Salisbury, and a
$2120 contract for Barry
Goldwater, but does not include
money for William F. Buckley.
Cory, a member of the Political
Union board, told the Senate that
it was his understanding that
Buckley's appearance was to be
financed by private donations.
Seen One Contract
Swift pointed out that he had
only seen one contract, for
Goldwater, and that he had seen
this contract for the first time
yesterday.
Swift added that the ASSU
by-laws state that all contracts for
which the ASSU may be held
liable must be signed by the
student financial manager. As it
stands now, he continued, the
contracts are between Roger
Reed, an adult, and the
respective agencies. Swift said that
a legal opinion he had received
indicated that Reed, not the
ASSU was liable for the contracts.
Cory said that as a member of
the Political Union board, he
realized that it was necessary to
book speakers well in advance.
These contracts were signed by
Reed last summer, he said. Cory
added, however, that Swift was
present during the summer, and
Reed could have gone to him with
the matters.
