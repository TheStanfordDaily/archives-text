# Cultures Vultures
## A 						Libertarian Right? 
### ANNE EGGEBROTEN 
Should a political conservative
tlepolore or applaud the current
pop culture?
In a closely self-analytical
meeting Wednesday night,
members of the Free Campus
Movement probed the nature of
their Libertarian brand of
conservatism and its relationship
to contemporary counter-culture.
Harvey H. Hukari, Jr.,
president of the group, advocated
Liberatarian acceptance of the
culture and use of its art form lor
political ends.
"Doing your own thing" is
really a form of individualism,
which is the foundation of the
conservative ideology, he asserted.
Reading his review of "Easy
Rider" published in the New
Guard, a Young Americans for
Freedom publication (October
issue), Hukari emphasized that the
film shows disaffected young
Americans seeking freedom from
restraint and attempting to find
themselves.
Libertarian Ideas
He claimed these themes were
in line with the two basic aims of
the Libertarian movement,
striking out against authority and
against the legislation of morals.
Thus, the thrust of

counter-culture is not necessarily
away from conservative values.
"Popular culture is perhaps the
most important political tool
available, influencing the most
people," he noted. "The left and
liberals seize on the political
potential of films, rock groups,
folk songs. .
"They have Joan Baez—we
have Everett Dirksen reading
poetry," he pointed out.
Hukari lamented the
conservatives' traditional
indifference to the arts, and
"even abhorrence" to new forms
of arts.
"For too long, conservative
have been patrons of art, not
creators of art," he stated. "But
when we try to break away from
the old forms, traditionalists
interpret our music and art as acts
of rebellion and disloyalty."
Nature of Conservative
Discussion focused on the basic
nature of the conservative as the
question was asked, "Why aren't
more conservatives bohemians and
artists?"
"One of the basic casts of mind
that produces art is that of
alientated people who are full of
hatred," asserted Leon Eymil, one
of the FCM members present.
"We aren't alienated sickies,"
another commented.

"It's against my principles to
be a musician when I'd have to
perform a certain kind of song to
a certain kind of audience," said
another.
After discussion, several
aspects of the conservative
personality were isolated as
possible reasons for less
involvement in the arts and the
hippie movement:
1) conservatives tend to seek
stable fields of occupation in
which the risk is less great,
2) they are "more tied to the
manners and morals of their
family,"
3) they are "more inhibited
when it comes to self-expression."
Market Risks
Hukari posited that an artist is
more Libertarian because he takes
greater risks in the open market of
competition than does, for
example, the conservative factory
worker. This was attacked by
other speakers.
They agreed, however, with
Hukari's statement that,
"Libertarians could be hippies and
it wouldn't be inconsistent—as
long as they didn't sponge off the
government."
Some time was spent discussing
whether Hitler was a "socialist or
a right-winger," and whether
Wallace is a liberal. This was
resolved by establishing a grill of x
andy axes—left and right on one
axis and authoritarianism
vs.Libertarianismism on the right
axis, while the FCM group put
themselves also on the right but
on the libertarian end of the other
axis.

whether Hitler was a "socialist or
a right-winger," and whether
Wallace is a liberal. This was
resolved by establishing a grill of x
andy axes—left and right on one
axis and authoritarianism
vs.Libertarianismism on the right
axis, while the FCM group put
themselves also on the right but
on the libertarian end of the other
axis.
Should a political conservative
tlepolore or applaud the current
pop culture?
In a closely self-analytical
meeting Wednesday night,
members of the Free Campus
Movement probed the nature of
their Libertarian brand of
conservatism and its relationship
to contemporary counter-culture.
Harvey H. Hukari, Jr.,
president of the group, advocated
Liberatarian acceptance of the
culture and use of its art form lor
political ends.
"Doing your own thing" is
really a form of individualism,
which is the foundation of the
conservative ideology, he asserted.
Reading his review of "Easy
Rider" published in the New
Guard, a Young Americans for
Freedom publication (October
issue), Hukari emphasized that the
film shows disaffected young
Americans seeking freedom from
restraint and attempting to find
themselves.
Libertarian Ideas
He claimed these themes were
in line with the two basic aims of
the Libertarian movement,
striking out against authority and
against the legislation of morals.
Thus, the thrust of

counter-culture is not necessarily
away from conservative values.
"Popular culture is perhaps the
most important political tool
available, influencing the most
people," he noted. "The left and
liberals seize on the political
potential of films, rock groups,
folk songs. .
"They have Joan Baez—we
have Everett Dirksen reading
poetry," he pointed out.
Hukari lamented the
conservatives' traditional
indifference to the arts, and
"even abhorrence" to new forms
of arts.
"For too long, conservative
have been patrons of art, not
creators of art," he stated. "But
when we try to break away from
the old forms, traditionalists
interpret our music and art as acts
of rebellion and disloyalty."
Nature of Conservative
Discussion focused on the basic
nature of the conservative as the
question was asked, "Why aren't
more conservatives bohemians and
artists?"
"One of the basic casts of mind
that produces art is that of
alientated people who are full of
hatred," asserted Leon Eymil, one
of the FCM members present.
"We aren't alienated sickies,"
another commented.

"It's against my principles to
be a musician when I'd have to
perform a certain kind of song to
a certain kind of audience," said
another.
After discussion, several
aspects of the conservative
personality were isolated as
possible reasons for less
involvement in the arts and the
hippie movement:
1) conservatives tend to seek
stable fields of occupation in
which the risk is less great,
2) they are "more tied to the
manners and morals of their
family,"
3) they are "more inhibited
when it comes to self-expression."
Market Risks
Hukari posited that an artist is
more Libertarian because he takes
greater risks in the open market of
competition than does, for
example, the conservative factory
worker. This was attacked by
other speakers.
They agreed, however, with
Hukari's statement that,
"Libertarians could be hippies and
it wouldn't be inconsistent—as
long as they didn't sponge off the
government."
Some time was spent discussing
whether Hitler was a "socialist or
a right-winger," and whether
Wallace is a liberal. This was
resolved by establishing a grill of x
andy axes—left and right on one
axis and authoritarianism
