# Radicals In USSR Increase Militancy
## 
### LAURIE PRICE 
During the past five years the
radical movement in the Soviet
Union has undergone a distinct
metamorphosis according to
Georges Haupt, French scholar
and writer who spoke here on
Wednesday.
"The small, but active civil
rights movement has lost the
illusion that a Stalinist revival is
impossible and, so, gained
militancy," said the Sorbonne
professor.
"The repression which has
been increasing since 1966 against
Moscow no n-conformists,
protestors, and radicals, as well as
the series of trials, were attempts
to prevent the emergence and the
reinforcement of an anti-Stalinist
opposition."
Instead of relying on strictly
legal arguments for protest, as at
the beginning of police repression
in 1966, the dissenters have now
moved toward "open and direct
confrontation with the K.G.B.
(secret police)," claimed Haupt.
Chechoslovakian Reaction
He then cited the reaction to
the invasion of Czechoslovakia as
the divide between dissent within
the system and actual protest
against the Party, and the
government. "Led by Pavel
Litvinov and Larissa Daniel, the
handful who demonstrated against
the Czech occupation showed
determination to engage in a
calculated political act," said
Haupt.
The change in focus from
opposition to laws to opposition
to the system itself is reflected in
the content on the underground
press output. Professor Haupt

explained that underground
leaflets and magazines, which have
been, since their beginnings,
important to the Russian civil
rights movement, "now have a
political and theoretical
orientation, rather than artistic."
"Crime of Silence"
"The crime of silence due to
lack of civic courage" was labelled
one of the biggest problems which
the radical movement faces "in
Russia as elsewhere in the world."
About seven distinct groups
combined to form the radical
alliance, running the gamut from
Old Bosheviks (Leninists) to
spiritual socialists. "However,"
points out Haupt, "categorization
is useless for, if the diverse
components of this group do not
agree on their interpretations of
socialism, they do exhibit
solidarity in anti-Stalinism,
respect for human dignity, and
their desire to live in a society
ruled by law."
The Soviet rebels come from a
broad range of backgrounds.
Haupt explained that "almost
every generation is represented,
and many occupations. We find
not only writers, but technicians,
social scientists and teachers, as
well."
Ex-Party Workers
''Neither subversive
conspirators, nor members of a
clandestine organization, a good
percentage were once Party
workers. Many of them were
victims of Stalinism or the
children of victims," he added.
The status of those involved
may be one reason that the
government has delayed a total
purge of the relatively powerless
movement, he told the audience.
In summation, Professor Haupt
turned to the question of the
immediate and future importance
of the radical movement in
Russia. "The range of the
movement must not be
overestimated," he cautioned.
"It is small, and isolated,
without a certain morrow. Many
of the protestors are in jail or
exiled, yet new support is still
being won among dissatisfied
citizens."

Center for Russian and East
European Studies.

conspirators, nor members of a
clandestine organization, a good
percentage were once Party
workers. Many of them were
victims of Stalinism or the
children of victims," he added.
The status of those involved
may be one reason that the
government has delayed a total
purge of the relatively powerless
movement, he told the audience.
In summation, Professor Haupt
turned to the question of the
immediate and future importance
of the radical movement in
Russia. "The range of the
movement must not be
overestimated," he cautioned.
"It is small, and isolated,
without a certain morrow. Many
of the protestors are in jail or
exiled, yet new support is still
being won among dissatisfied
citizens."
The talk was sponsored by the
Center for Russian and East
European Studies.
During the past five years the
radical movement in the Soviet
Union has undergone a distinct
metamorphosis according to
Georges Haupt, French scholar
and writer who spoke here on
Wednesday.
"The small, but active civil
rights movement has lost the
illusion that a Stalinist revival is
impossible and, so, gained
militancy," said the Sorbonne
professor.
"The repression which has
been increasing since 1966 against
Moscow no n-conformists,
protestors, and radicals, as well as
the series of trials, were attempts
to prevent the emergence and the
reinforcement of an anti-Stalinist
opposition."
Instead of relying on strictly
legal arguments for protest, as at
the beginning of police repression
in 1966, the dissenters have now
moved toward "open and direct
confrontation with the K.G.B.
(secret police)," claimed Haupt.
Chechoslovakian Reaction
He then cited the reaction to
the invasion of Czechoslovakia as
the divide between dissent within
the system and actual protest
against the Party, and the
government. "Led by Pavel
Litvinov and Larissa Daniel, the
handful who demonstrated against
the Czech occupation showed
determination to engage in a
calculated political act," said
Haupt.
The change in focus from
opposition to laws to opposition
to the system itself is reflected in
the content on the underground
press output. Professor Haupt

explained that underground
leaflets and magazines, which have
been, since their beginnings,
important to the Russian civil
rights movement, "now have a
political and theoretical
orientation, rather than artistic."
"Crime of Silence"
"The crime of silence due to
lack of civic courage" was labelled
one of the biggest problems which
the radical movement faces "in
Russia as elsewhere in the world."
About seven distinct groups
combined to form the radical
alliance, running the gamut from
Old Bosheviks (Leninists) to
spiritual socialists. "However,"
points out Haupt, "categorization
is useless for, if the diverse
components of this group do not
agree on their interpretations of
socialism, they do exhibit
solidarity in anti-Stalinism,
respect for human dignity, and
their desire to live in a society
ruled by law."
The Soviet rebels come from a
broad range of backgrounds.
Haupt explained that "almost
every generation is represented,
and many occupations. We find
not only writers, but technicians,
social scientists and teachers, as
well."
Ex-Party Workers
''Neither subversive
conspirators, nor members of a
clandestine organization, a good
percentage were once Party
workers. Many of them were
victims of Stalinism or the
children of victims," he added.
