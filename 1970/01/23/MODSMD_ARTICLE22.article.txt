# Japan Struggle Seen
## 
### JUDY BIRK 
Japan will be in revolution
next fall. According to Hatano, a
leader of the Zenkyato militant
left-wing student organization,
Japanese students and workers
will stage a large scale, violent
struggle to destroy the imperialist,
fascist, bourgeoise elements of
Japanese society in October,
1970.
In a campus address
Wednesday night, Hatano said
that the Japanese student forces
are using university campuses as
bases for liberation of the people
because the universities presently
support and perpetuate
bourgeoise society.
The University of Tokyo,
where Hatano is a student, has
been the scene of student activism
for two years. The struggle began
with demands for reform of the
medical education system and a
strike by medical students. In
June, 1968 the struggle became
campus-wide. Hatano called this
the "first stage reform struggle" in
which the students demanded
reform of the medical school, the
right of doctors to form unions,
and student control of the
campus.
In the summer of 1968 the
new president of the University
wanted to talk to the students and
suggested that there be a change
from the Japanese to the
American educational system.
This suggestion was rejected by
the students for according to
Hatano, "the American system is
a better way to oppress the people
than the Japanese system "
The struggle which had
previously been non-violent
erupted into a violent
confrontation between the police
and the students a year ago.
Students barricaded the
University and held out against
tear gas and high pressure water

attacks for thirty-five hours.
Hatano showed a student
produced film of the students
battling 8,000 "pigs" with flame
throwers and molotov cocktails.
Since autumn of 1968 students
have occupied and disrupted 130
universities and 30 high schools in
Japan.
The Japanese students stand
against the U.S.-Japan security
agreement made by Prime
Minister Sato and President Nixon
this November. U.S. bases will
remain in Japan, and Okinawa,
the site of 117 American bases
with 45,000 troops, will remain a
nuclear weapons site after it is
returned to Japanese control in
1972.

Hatano fears that the working
class is not aware of the need for a
revolution on political grounds.
He believes that a militant struggle
by the students is the best way to
show the poeple what a
proletariat revolution is.
Presently, the most militant
sect of the Zenkyato student
organization, the Red Army, is
organizing training programs in
the use of guns and bombs for the
revolution.
There is not much time to
educate, radicalize, and militarize
the workers for the revolution
next fall, according to Hatano. He
says that the revolution must start
in the national press.

over the land." Even if the residents of Man/.anita Park aren't Biblical scholars,
all of them have been knee deep in goo lately.
