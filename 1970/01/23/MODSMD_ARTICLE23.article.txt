Editor, THE DAILY:
The University was forced by recent court decisions to
begin withholding Federal income taxes from about 280
TA's. (The other 70 were already subject to withholding
under the earlier legal situation.) This enforced and
sudden change in take-home pay may cause harship to
some students.
On that account I wrote to deans and department
chairmen on 24 December 1969, "The University stands
ready to aid financial distress arising out of this abrupt
transition. Students should first consult their
departments. Cases which cannot be adequately helped
out at the departmental level amy be referred by the
department to The Graduate Division where loan funds
will be available—or if justified, grant-in-aid funds." So
far no hardship requests have come to my attention.
But no policy of "reimbursing" TA's for their taxes is
contemplated. The maximally taxed (one exemption)
lowest paid TA (Course Assistant) still receives more for
his academic year stipend than do hundreds of graduate
students now at Stanford on University Fellowships,
NSF, NIM, NDEA, Fellowships and traineeships.
Additional monies for student assistance—an all to scarce
resource —should not be used to better the position of
those already more highly paid but for others, with no
fellowship, or tuition only, or to those with inadequate
support.
So far actual tax liabilities aren't even clear. For
example, although a married course assistant would have
$195 deducted from his pay (in nine instalments) his tax
liability on that income ($2400) for the year 1970-71
would be only $10.50 (under the new law). What
"reimbursement" is appropriate? What if he were
single—with larger taxes—more reimbursement? If he had
a child he would have no tax liability —and would need
the money worse. What about the 20% of TA's already
paying taxes?
Neither logic nor equity can justify spending scarce
student aid funds for "reimbursement." Nor will the
University shrink from helping out with those whose
ability to pursue graduate study is imperiled by this
abrupt, and regrettable tax bite.
