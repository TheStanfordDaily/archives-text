# Protest Mixed Over Faculty Booze
## 
### JOHN SLOAN 
Smooth sailing doesn't seem to
be the order of the day in the
attempts by the Faculty Club to
obtain an on the campus liquor
license. Already the Alcoholic
Beverages Control (ABC) in San
Jose has received "many protests,
mainly by individuals" over the
proposed licence, according to
Paul Donaldson, licensing
supervisor of the ABC.

Donaldson cited some of the
groups who have protested as a
Palo Alto Church of Mazarene,
the Women's Society of Christian
Service, the Methodist Mens'
Club, the Woman's Club of Palo
Alto, and he said that there were
probably others who sent their
protests direct to Sacramento.
As a result of these objections
there will be a public hearing held
in order to let both sides present

their cases from which a proposed
recomendation will be sent to the
ABC director in Sacramento. The
open hearing will take place in
front of a State Hearing Officer
once an investigation into the
matter is completed. The hearing
will probably be held within a
month.
In a Palo Alto Times story,
Mrs. Henry Broderson, a member
of the Woman's Club of Palo Alto,

one of the groups against the
licence, stated her reasons for
opposing liquor on campus. "Are
you willing to break the covenant
Mrs. Stanford made with Stanford
and break the long-standing policy
against liquor on campus?" she
asked. How soon will the students
be demanding a bar in the
Stanford union?"
But according to Ralph Hansen
of the University Archives there is
no indication that the present
anti-liquor laws come from Mrs.
Stanford. The restrictions against
liquor only came into effect after
the death of Mrs. Stanford.
Around the turn of the century
students began frequenting
saloons in Mayfield, but official
action was only taken after a
student was shot to death when
drunkenly he stepped into the
wrong house.
The Trustees asked the
President of the University and
the faculty to take the necessary
steps to eliminate liquor from the
campus. After this, a Stanford
Alumnus was able to have a State
law put into effect that prohibited
the sale of liquor within one and a
half miles from any campus.

Mrs, Broderson also mentioned
State law no. 172 in their fight to
keep Stanford dry. However,
according to Donaldson of the
ABC, although this statute states
that no alcoholic beverage, except
beer and other drinks with less
than 3.2% alcohol may be sold
within one and a half miles of a
campus, there are "many
ammendments and exceptions."
The one's that would apply to the
Faculty Club are that a licence
may be issued within the one and
a half mile limit if the licence is a
bonified eating place or an
organized Club which has been in
existance for at least thirty-five
years, has a minimum of 150
members and serves daily meals to
its members.
Although it may seem at a
glance that the Faculty Club has
the law on their side it is obvious
that the groups who don't want to
see a liquor outlet on campus are
not going to give up without a
good fight. So until such time as
the ABC is able to decide one way
or the other, the demon booze
will continue to be banned from
the campus, and, officially at
least, this will still be a dry ship.

action was only taken after a
student was shot to death when
drunkenly he stepped into the
wrong house.
The Trustees asked the
President of the University and
the faculty to take the necessary
steps to eliminate liquor from the
campus. After this, a Stanford
Alumnus was able to have a State
law put into effect that prohibited
the sale of liquor within one and a
half miles from any campus.

Mrs, Broderson also mentioned
State law no. 172 in their fight to
keep Stanford dry. However,
according to Donaldson of the
ABC, although this statute states
that no alcoholic beverage, except
beer and other drinks with less
than 3.2% alcohol may be sold
within one and a half miles of a
campus, there are "many
ammendments and exceptions."
The one's that would apply to the
Faculty Club are that a licence
may be issued within the one and
a half mile limit if the licence is a
bonified eating place or an
organized Club which has been in
existance for at least thirty-five
years, has a minimum of 150
members and serves daily meals to
its members.
Although it may seem at a
glance that the Faculty Club has
the law on their side it is obvious
that the groups who don't want to
see a liquor outlet on campus are
not going to give up without a
good fight. So until such time as
the ABC is able to decide one way
or the other, the demon booze
will continue to be banned from
the campus, and, officially at
least, this will still be a dry ship.
Smooth sailing doesn't seem to
be the order of the day in the
attempts by the Faculty Club to
obtain an on the campus liquor
license. Already the Alcoholic
Beverages Control (ABC) in San
Jose has received "many protests,
mainly by individuals" over the
proposed licence, according to
Paul Donaldson, licensing
supervisor of the ABC.

Donaldson cited some of the
groups who have protested as a
Palo Alto Church of Mazarene,
the Women's Society of Christian
Service, the Methodist Mens'
Club, the Woman's Club of Palo
Alto, and he said that there were
probably others who sent their
protests direct to Sacramento.
As a result of these objections
there will be a public hearing held
in order to let both sides present

their cases from which a proposed
recomendation will be sent to the
ABC director in Sacramento. The
open hearing will take place in
front of a State Hearing Officer
once an investigation into the
matter is completed. The hearing
will probably be held within a
month.
In a Palo Alto Times story,
Mrs. Henry Broderson, a member
of the Woman's Club of Palo Alto,

one of the groups against the
licence, stated her reasons for
opposing liquor on campus. "Are
you willing to break the covenant
Mrs. Stanford made with Stanford
and break the long-standing policy
against liquor on campus?" she
asked. How soon will the students
be demanding a bar in the
Stanford union?"
But according to Ralph Hansen
of the University Archives there is
no indication that the present
anti-liquor laws come from Mrs.
Stanford. The restrictions against
liquor only came into effect after
the death of Mrs. Stanford.
Around the turn of the century
students began frequenting
saloons in Mayfield, but official
action was only taken after a
student was shot to death when
drunkenly he stepped into the
wrong house.
