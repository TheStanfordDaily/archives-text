The Black Community at
Stanford is deeply concerned with
the problems of the community
of East Palo Alto, according to
James E. Simmons, Assistant
Provost for Intergroup Relations.
The black administrator told the
Stanford Mothers Club
Wednesday that "the plight of our
brothers and sisters across the
freewav was the focal point of
activity for the blacks at Stanford
during the fall quarter."
Simmons said that black
students are urged to devote their
time to working in a community
which will remain here long after

the students themselves have left
Stanford. Such projects included
allowing students attending
Stanford on federal work-study
programs to be employed by
community affiliated
organizations such as Nairobi
College and day schools. Other
students participated in a
teacher's aide program at
Ravenswood High School and
community programs run by
black graduate students in law,
business and medicine.
Stanford University is also
being asked to involve itself in
"Nairobi," as East Palo Alto
residents refer to their
community.

Stanford Jobs
"Few people realize that
Stanford is a second largest
employer on the Peninsula,"
explained Simmons. "The
tremendous amount of money
paid out by Stanford in salaries
benefits communities like Los
Altos, Mountain View, and Menlo
Park. Very rarely does any of it
ever reach East Palo Alto.
"This trend must cease. An
institution the size of Stanford
cannot ignore unemployment in
East Palo Alto."
For this reason the University,
at the urging of the Black
Community, has started a
minority employment program.
Simmons' remarks served as an
introduction to talks by Odia
Chiles, a freshman, senior and
four year Stanford student Dave
Edwards and John "Jake" Carter,
a junior transfer from the City
College of San Francisco. They
spoke on the experiences of black
undergraduates at Stanford.
Black Adjustments
Chiles, a Ravenswood High
School graduate, said the most
difficult problem facing a black
Stanford freshman from a ghetto
school is social, not academic. "It
worries me," Chiles told the
audience. "How in the hell am I
going to deal with whites later on
if I can't even talk to them now?"
Edwards spoke of the changes
Stanford had undergone in the
four years since he had entered
the University, one of only
twenty-four blacks on a campus
of 10,000 students.
The fears of a black transfer
student when confronted for the
first time by the strangeness of a
large University were discussed by
Carter.
