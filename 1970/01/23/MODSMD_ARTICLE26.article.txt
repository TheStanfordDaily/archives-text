Women are as threatened today by the media and the money
economy as they once were by male chauvinists, said Professor David
Potter of the History Department. Speaking on the subject of "The
Situation of American Women - Old Solutions and New Dilemmas,"
Potter concluded that the status of women is now depressed because
of their role as consumers instead of wage earners.
Consumers are to be bullied and manipulated by advertisers, not
consulted and respected. The discrimination is all the more invidious
because of its subtlely and its basis in values that women accept;
formerly the values that decreed women's subordination were the
values of men, imposed on women.
Examining the role of the frontier in America, Potter noted the
social generalization about American character and the frontier's
influence on it are in fact generalizations about American male
character.
"Opportunity for women actually began where the frontier left off
- in the city. The basis of female subordination was weakened when
the city offered jobs that required dexterity and adaptability rather
than brute strength. The typewriter played a vital part in realizing the
American promise for American women."
Early feminists felt that the 19th Amendment granting women the
right to vote was the solution to the subordination of women. The
new dilemma, Potter pointed out, is that women no longer are
processors of the goods produced in partnership with their husbands
but are now merely consumers of other's products. In a society that
measures people by their earnings, the women whose work in the
home is unpaid finds her role increasingly devalued.
While declining to propose goals or tactics for the women's
movement, Potter asserted that women should not strive to occupy
roles as much like those of men merely for the sake proving that they
can fill such roles. "Female chauvinists often insist that women place
indication of their rights above their individual satisfaction. A woman
should be free to reject or accept domestic values on an individual
basis."
