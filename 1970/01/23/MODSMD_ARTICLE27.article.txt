# Indians Recruited
## 
### 
The four American Indian
students at Stanford are working
with University officers to expand
total enrollment of native
Americans to 25 bv next fall.
Submitting their plans to
Provost Richard W. Lyman, the
student-staff group noted that
"the American Indian lives under
conditions more abject than those
of any other minority." But they
added, "whatever the educational
handicaps of young American
Indian men and women, the
opportunity for some to attend
Stanford can be genuine.
"Those admitted must be
chosen within a context that
reflects sensitivity to the unique
qualities of American Indian
youth and an awareness of this
University as an Indian sees it."
On Monday, Raymond Cross, a
senior pre-law student from
Fremont and member of the
Man dan tribe, will start a
one-week tour of the Southwest
with Doug Davis, a special
assistant to the provost. They will
visit Bureau of Indian Affairs
schools and talk with tribal
associations.
Davis emphasized that the
University hopes that Indians will
be able to organize their own
orientation for new students and

"run their own community,"
much as black and brown students
now do at Stanford.
Russell Red Elk, a freshman
from Wolf Point, Montana and
member of the Sioux tribe, came
to Stanford after attending
Choate through the ABC program
(A Better Chance).
Later this year, he plans to
help recruit native Americans
from the Northern Plains region
with Sally Mahoney, assistant
provost, and John Hanson,
associate dean of students.
"We're looking for the best
Indian students we can find,"
Chris McNeil, a senior political
science major and native Alaskan,
said. "But that won't be a
reflection of white America."
McNeil and Ella Anagick, a
freshman also from Alaska, will
work with Bob Freelen, associate
dean of students, in covering
California, the Pacific Northwest,
and Alaska. Native Americans in
the East will be contacted by
mail.
Like other students from
disadvantaged minorities, native
Americans selected for Stanford
will receive financial aid sufficient
to cover their needs during their
first year at the University. After
this, a combination of grants,
work, and loans will be provided.
