# Swimming:
## Two On Tap For Tribe 
### DOUG WILSON 
As of January 12, freshman Rick Colella of the
University of Washington had the top 200-yd.
breaststroke time in the nation—2:ll.3. As of
January 17, freshman Brian Job of Stanford
University had the top 200-yd. breaststroke time
in the nation—2:o9.s.
If you come to Encina pool this afternoon at 3
you'll see which freshman has the top breaststroke
time this week. While you're at it, you're also
likely to see one of the best dual swim meets in
the nation this year, and certainly one of the
toughest for Stanford.
The Washington Huskies, under new coach Earl
Ellis, boast one of their finest swimming teams
ever, one of the best in the Pacific-8, and,
according to Stanford coach Jim Gaughran,
"possibly one of the top eight teams in the NCAA
this year." A surprisingly strong showing—mostly
be freshman —in the top times of the still young
collegiate season puts 19 Washington times among
the top dozen in nine of eleven swimming events.
Compiled before the beginning of Stanford's
season last Saturday, the list nevertheless reflects
the power and depth of an undefeated Washington
squad which has thus far defeated BYU, 65-49,
and Washington State, 81-32.
Tribe Stronger
Stanford, which defeated Washington State last
weekend, 86-27, will undoubtedly put foreward a
much stronger, more compact lineup than was
seen against the unfortunate Cougars —possibly
including a medley relay of Fred Haywood, John
Ferris, Brian Job, and Steve Carey, the team which
leads the nation in the event with the time of
3:32.4. Washington ranks fourth with 3:37.5
Against Washington State, freshman distance
ace Tim Broderick swam the 1000-yd. freestyle in
10:12.6. This week, his time should come
down —his competitors will include Washington's
Jeff Schufreider (9:51.4. The second fastest time
in the nation so far); and Steve Power
(10:03.2—fourth-fastest); and possibly Colella,
who, besides turning in what was formerly the
fastest time in the nation for breaststroke, ranks

sth in the 1000, fourth in the individual medley,
and fifth in the 500-yd. freestyle.
The Stanford middle- and long-distance squad
which consists of Olympian Brent Berk, Bert
Mason, Mark Shelley, and Jack Wells, as well as
Broderick, faces a Washington lineup of
Schufreider, Steve Power, Jon Baker, and Colella,
who hold four of the top five time-positions in the
NCAA thus far.
Schufreider Again
Stanford's freshman sprint stars Steve Carey
and Bob Warren, juniors John Glaser and Bob
Jamison, AU-American Rick Eagelston, and
sophomores Bill Huck and Bob Bebb will face
Washington sophomores Greg Galles and Alan Bell,
and possibly Schufreider, who seems to pup up at
every turn (so to speak) in freestyle.
His brother, Ernie ranks third in the
times-ratings in the 200-yd. backstroke with a time
of 1:59.4, which is what Stanford's NCAA
champion Fred Haywood hit last week as he
handily beat the WSU competitors. The Indians'
other NCAA champ, butterflier John Ferris, will
face Ken Reisch, Huskie sophomore whose time of
1:57.6 in the 200-yd. event (top so far in the
nation) Ferris bettered at a training meet in
Hawaii.
Huskie diving coach Bill Burgess brings
freshman Ralph Bjier and returning lettermen
Larry Hata and Don Hoy to meet a fine Indian
diving unit under Coach Clyde Devine, led by Bill
Main, 1968 NCAA finalist in 1-meter and 3-meter
competition. Ted Nichols and Fred Bachman,
returning from last year, and Ed Lederman and
freshman Steve Riffenburgh complete the diving
lineup.
And, of course, there's that race between Job,
Colella, and sophomore Dave Schilling of Stanford
in the breaststroke.
It should be an interesting afternoon. And if
you like what you see, you might want to come
tomorrow, too, when Stanford hosts the top AAU
club in the country, Santa Clara, in a three-way
meet which also includes Foothill College. The
meet starts at 2 p.m. at Encina pool.

tomorrow, too, when Stanford hosts the top AAU
club in the country, Santa Clara, in a three-way
meet which also includes Foothill College. The
meet starts at 2 p.m. at Encina pool.

BACKING DOWN It might not look like it here, but Stanford swimmers will
definitely be up for their meet this afternoon with the powerful Washington
Huskies. The dog paddle has been eliminated from today's events.
As of January 12, freshman Rick Colella of the
University of Washington had the top 200-yd.
breaststroke time in the nation—2:ll.3. As of
January 17, freshman Brian Job of Stanford
University had the top 200-yd. breaststroke time
in the nation—2:o9.s.
If you come to Encina pool this afternoon at 3
you'll see which freshman has the top breaststroke
time this week. While you're at it, you're also
likely to see one of the best dual swim meets in
the nation this year, and certainly one of the
toughest for Stanford.
The Washington Huskies, under new coach Earl
Ellis, boast one of their finest swimming teams
ever, one of the best in the Pacific-8, and,
according to Stanford coach Jim Gaughran,
"possibly one of the top eight teams in the NCAA
this year." A surprisingly strong showing—mostly
be freshman —in the top times of the still young
collegiate season puts 19 Washington times among
the top dozen in nine of eleven swimming events.
Compiled before the beginning of Stanford's
season last Saturday, the list nevertheless reflects
the power and depth of an undefeated Washington
squad which has thus far defeated BYU, 65-49,
and Washington State, 81-32.
Tribe Stronger
Stanford, which defeated Washington State last
weekend, 86-27, will undoubtedly put foreward a
much stronger, more compact lineup than was
seen against the unfortunate Cougars —possibly
including a medley relay of Fred Haywood, John
Ferris, Brian Job, and Steve Carey, the team which
leads the nation in the event with the time of
3:32.4. Washington ranks fourth with 3:37.5
Against Washington State, freshman distance
ace Tim Broderick swam the 1000-yd. freestyle in
10:12.6. This week, his time should come
down —his competitors will include Washington's
Jeff Schufreider (9:51.4. The second fastest time
in the nation so far); and Steve Power
(10:03.2—fourth-fastest); and possibly Colella,
who, besides turning in what was formerly the
fastest time in the nation for breaststroke, ranks

sth in the 1000, fourth in the individual medley,
and fifth in the 500-yd. freestyle.
The Stanford middle- and long-distance squad
which consists of Olympian Brent Berk, Bert
Mason, Mark Shelley, and Jack Wells, as well as
Broderick, faces a Washington lineup of
Schufreider, Steve Power, Jon Baker, and Colella,
who hold four of the top five time-positions in the
NCAA thus far.
Schufreider Again
Stanford's freshman sprint stars Steve Carey
and Bob Warren, juniors John Glaser and Bob
Jamison, AU-American Rick Eagelston, and
sophomores Bill Huck and Bob Bebb will face
Washington sophomores Greg Galles and Alan Bell,
and possibly Schufreider, who seems to pup up at
every turn (so to speak) in freestyle.
His brother, Ernie ranks third in the
times-ratings in the 200-yd. backstroke with a time
of 1:59.4, which is what Stanford's NCAA
champion Fred Haywood hit last week as he
handily beat the WSU competitors. The Indians'
other NCAA champ, butterflier John Ferris, will
face Ken Reisch, Huskie sophomore whose time of
1:57.6 in the 200-yd. event (top so far in the
nation) Ferris bettered at a training meet in
Hawaii.
Huskie diving coach Bill Burgess brings
freshman Ralph Bjier and returning lettermen
Larry Hata and Don Hoy to meet a fine Indian
diving unit under Coach Clyde Devine, led by Bill
Main, 1968 NCAA finalist in 1-meter and 3-meter
competition. Ted Nichols and Fred Bachman,
returning from last year, and Ed Lederman and
freshman Steve Riffenburgh complete the diving
lineup.
And, of course, there's that race between Job,
Colella, and sophomore Dave Schilling of Stanford
in the breaststroke.
It should be an interesting afternoon. And if
you like what you see, you might want to come
tomorrow, too, when Stanford hosts the top AAU
club in the country, Santa Clara, in a three-way
meet which also includes Foothill College. The
meet starts at 2 p.m. at Encina pool.

freshman Steve Riffenburgh complete the diving
lineup.
And, of course, there's that race between Job,
Colella, and sophomore Dave Schilling of Stanford
in the breaststroke.
It should be an interesting afternoon. And if
you like what you see, you might want to come
tomorrow, too, when Stanford hosts the top AAU
club in the country, Santa Clara, in a three-way
meet which also includes Foothill College. The
meet starts at 2 p.m. at Encina pool.

BACKING DOWN It might not look like it here, but Stanford swimmers will
definitely be up for their meet this afternoon with the powerful Washington
Huskies. The dog paddle has been eliminated from today's events.
