# Old West Scenario: Cowboys vs. Indians
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball team
takes a weekend off from Pac-8
action as they host Wyoming and
Air Force tonight and tomorrow
night at Maples Pavilion. The
Indians, 3-9 on the year, will try
to extend their one game winning
streak against a tough Wyoming
team, ranked 18th in the nation in
this week's UPI poll.
The Cowboys are 11-2 on the
season, having lost only to Baylor
and Texas-El Paso. Leading the
way for the Cowboys this season
has been two time all-WAC
performer, Carl Ashley. The 6-6
center has been averaging 20.7
points per game to pace the
Cowboys. The other big guns for
Wyoming have been forwards Stan
Dodds (6-4) and Steve Popovich
(6-6). Dodds was ninth in the
nation in field goal percentage last
season and he is averaging 18.2
points so far this year. Popovich is
third in scoring with a 12.2
average. Wyoming will be favored
to beat the Cards, but Saturday
night they are playing UCLA, and
though the team will deny it, the
Cowboys might be caught looking
ahead to their date with the
number one ranked Bruins.
Some Competition
The Air Force Academy will
bring a 7-3 record into Saturday
night's game, but with victories
over Doane College, Southern
Colorado State, and Western State
College, this record may be
misleading. The Falcons* are led by
center Ron Weilert (6-6) who is at
the top of the list in both scoring
(16.2) and rebounding (10.2).
Guard Gregg Popovich (6-3)
follows Weilert with a 14.2
scoring average.
The Falcons are a small team
who must rely on discipline and
smart basketball to win. The
Indians are bigger than the
Falcons, but they will have to
avoid the mistakes which led to a
65-64 loss to Air Force last
season.
Stanford Coach Howie Dallmar
has indicated he will go with the
same starting five that engineered

last weekend's upset over
California. The only problem for
(he Tribe will be forward Chuck
Moore who has continued to be
bothered by a strained instep.
Joining Moore in the front line
will be Fred Green (10.2) and
center Bill Palmer (9.6). The
Backcourt spots will again be
manned by Claude Terry (18.3)
and Dennis O'Neill (15.8).
Frosh String
In preliminaries to this
weekend's games, the Stanford
frosh will take on Moffett Field
and the Cal-Davis frosh. The little
Indians have won four in a row
after an opening loss to the San
Jose State frosh.
One of the starting forwards,
Bob Buell restrained his knee
against Cal and he will be out of
action for both games. Coach Bob
Bowling has indicated that guard
Pat Rusco (6-3) will take over
Rusco's guard spot.
Both freshmen games will start
at 6:00 with the varsity game
following at 8:00 P.M.

NO. 6â€”Sophomore heavy weight
Lee Fair (above) and the rest of
Stanford's wrestlers go after their sixth
win tomorrow night at 7:30 in Encina
Pavilion against UC-Santa Barbara.
The visiting Gauchos have a
well-balanced team which is
particularly strong in the first three
divisions but Indian Coach Dave Reed,
despite some minor Tribe injuries,
figures his team will still come out on
top. "It will be a good dual meet," lie
says.
Otarlie Harris (134) and Dave
Thomas (142) have had elbow anil arm
problems hut both are probably
starters.
