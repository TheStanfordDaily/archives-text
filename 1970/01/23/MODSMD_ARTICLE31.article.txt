# Play Tuesday
## Icemen Lose Again 
### 
Stanford's ice hockey team,
which dropped a wide-open game
to San Francisco Monday night,
now faces the prospect of meeting
the league-leading Berkeley Bruins
in an 8 p.m. game at Belmont
Iceland this Tuesday.
In what Coach Fuller Torrey
described as the "fastest game of
the season," the Indians bowed to
San Francisco by a 13-9 margin.
Both teams were able to mount
strong offensive drives but failed
repeatedly on defense.
Sharply hurt by the absence of
two of their top three
defensemen, the Tribe had
frequent difficulty clearing the
puck from their own zone.
But on offense, freshman Paul

Tittman and law student Ed
Leonard picked up three-goal hat
tricks, and Tom Love, a
sharp-skating surgeon from the
Medical Center scored two more.
Grad student Skip Ross added a
final tally.
Stanford's front line showed
more power than it has all year,
but Coach Torrey feels that "We'll
have to fill the defensive holes
before we will be able to
consistently beat teams like San
Francisco.
The loss put Stanford at 2-9 on
the season. All of the team's
remaining games will be at
Belmont, with the exception of
the Feb. 21 contest at Oakland
against Cal.
