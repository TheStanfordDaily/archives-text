# Senior Found Dead
## 
### 
The body of Stanford senior
Robert Dean Crow was found on
Dunes Beach at Half Moon Bay
last Friday. Crow disappeared ten
days earlier after reportedly
expressing fear he would be
drafted to fight in Vietnam.
He was identified Wednesday
by relatives.
Crow died of drowning,
probably shortly after he

disappeared, said San Mateo
County Coroner Paul Jensen. His
nude body was found lying in the
sand by a Livermore fisherman.
His car had been found by the
California Highway Patrol on
January 10.
A native of Missouri, Crow had
been a Roble resident but was
apparently living off campus. He
was an anthropology major.
