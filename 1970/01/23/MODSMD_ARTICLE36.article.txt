# H-P Building Addition
## 
### 
The Stanford Industrial Park,
currently faced with development
both on Coyote Hill and along El
Camino, is getting yet another
building.
Hewlett-Packard Corp. is
adding a sixth building to its
headquarters complex on Page
Mill Road.
The contract for the $1.7
million structure has been let to a
South San Francisco company,
Aberthaw Construction Co.
The 93,000 square foot
building will provide additional
room for the microwave and
manufacturing divisions of the
company.
According to John Young,
vice-president and general

manager of the electronics
products group, the expansion
will not increase congestion in the
Industrial Park.
"We're pretty crowded right
now, so I'm not sure that it will
have much effect on our overall
employment," noted Young.
The University has recently
come under fire from community
groups for its planned expansion
of the park. The Hewlett-Packard
lots are in the developed section
of the park. With the new
building, its complex will rise to
700,000 square feet of floor
space.
The project will commence
soon, and company officials
indicate it will be completed this
year.
