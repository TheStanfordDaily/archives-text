# Faculty Senate Approves Limited ROTC Credit Plan
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The faculty Senate approved
possible limited academic credit
for Army ROTC on a one-year
trial basis last night.
After a lengthy three and a
ha If-hour debate the Senate
ratified 23-13 the Army proposal
to grant unit credit to courses
approved by the Committee on
Undergraduate Education (CUS)
as undergraduate specials. Each
course will be evaluated "on its
own academic merits."
The new contract will be on a
"one-year trial basis with
appropriate review at the end of
that time. . The resolution
emphasizes that the courses will
be reviewed strictly on a normal
basis. To remove any outside

pressure on the CUS for approval
of credit the resolution says there
will be no presumption that credit
should be given to the Army
courses in order to keep ROTC on
campus.
About 125 students seeking an
end to ROTC on campus gathered
outside the Graduate School of
Business building before the
Senate met, but did not obstruct
entry to the meeting. About 25
conservative students opposed to
disruptions also were present led
by Harvey Hukari.
Group To Meet
The anti-ROTC group
announced that it will hold an
open discussion today at 3 p.m. in
Cubberly Auditorium to
determine what response should

be made to yesterday's Senate
action.
The Senate also urged "the
President to do everything
possible to press for elimination
of the punitive provisions in
individual ROTC contracts."
These provisions threaten an
ROTC student with active duty as
an enlisted man if he drops out of
the program during the last two
years of the four-year program, or
last year of other programs.
In his opening statements on
the ROTC issue, President Pitzer
told the Senate, "To flatly refuse
consideration of credit would be
seen by many as undue
discrimination against military
science when we have a
reasonably flexible system for
credit."
Eliminates Departments
The Army proposal will
eliminate departmental status for
ROTC and remove its instructors
from the Academic Council.
Colonel Stanley Ramey of Army
ROTC has indicated that he will
seek to have six to nine units
approved for credit.
Many people thought Senate
action would be postponed to
allow further discussion. Instead,
several faculty members anticipate
that the Senate's decision will be
reviewed by the full Academic
Council, allowing for more
debate. If 50 faculty members
petition, the decision will be
brought before the entire faculty.
Last April, the faculty voted
403-356 that "after a transitional
period, there should be no
academic credit received for
participation in programs of
military training and education,"
sustaining an earlier 28-8 Senate
vote.
Dornbusch Opposes
In opposing credit for ROTC,
Sociology Professor Stanford
Dornbusch, said ". . .to affirm
today's report is essentially a
partial reversal (of last year's
decision) without taking a firm
stand. CUS i* not the appropriate
body to make decisions on credit

in the kind of political
atmosphere which necessarily
would be involved in deciding
credit for ROTC."
After the meeting, the sponsor
of the motion, Law Prof. Kenneth
Scott, said, "It seemed to me that
the process we were involved in
was reformulating ROTC to make
it more acceptable to the
University. . .and it is only
attainable in stages. In all
likelihood it was all we could get
in stage one."
Prof. Scott expressed his
opinion that the punitive clauses
in ROTC contracts with students
''continues to be rather
unsatisfactory." He said an
amendment offered and then
withdrawn by Statistics Prof.
Herbert Solomon demanded that
the Army withdraw their punitive
clause within a limited time
period. According to Scott,
although many Senate members
supported the elimination of this
clause, most felt that it would be
impractical to put an ultimatum
before the Army regarding it.
Pitzer Not Approached
Members of the radical group
outside the meeting were urged to
talk to faculty members as they
made their way inside. However,
most Senate members including
President Pitzer, were not
approached as they entered.
After the meeting started more
than 100 persons moved into
Bishop Auditorium and listened
to a broadcast of the senate
discussion Most of those listening
left after about an hour, long
before the Senate's decision.
The radical coalitionhas called
itself the New Stanford
Moratorium, but is not related to
the Vietnam Moratorium
Committee.
Lyman Defends ROTC
Provost Richard Lyman
defended the ROTC proposal
during the meeting. "No one must
take ROTC. The faculty is in
about as full control of course
content as it ever is. And
significant advantages accure to

many students in the form of
scholarship support not
forthcoming from other sources."
Prof. Alan S. Manne,
economics, who headed the
advisory committee but disagreed
with its report, argued, the
referendum reviewing the Senate's
actions, a majority of the faculty
favored retention of the ROTC
units on campus as an
extracurricular activity but
without academic credit. "In my
view this faculty decision was a
sound one and long overdue
overdue by decades.
"To ask CUS to administer
courses of this type is to ask for
continual headaches, and to
politicize the tasks of that
committee," he added. Dornbusch
also argued that the CUS will be
put in an unfair situation. The
threat that Army ROTC might
leave if no credit were actually
given might force the CUS to
approve courses they might
otherwise not.
Only Affects Army
Although the proposal dealt
only with the Army, Pitzer had
indicated before the meeting that
the Navy and Air Force would
probably be willing to accept
similar proposals. Lt. Col. Leon
Heinle of Air Force ROTC said
after the decision had been
reached, "Using this a model,
we're going to have to sit down
and work out our own proposal."
The resolution adopted by the
faculty Senate read in full as
follows:
"Resolved that the Senate approves
acceptance of the Army proposal
referred to in the Jan. 16, 1970
memorandum of President Pitzer,
subject to the understanding that
acceptance shall be on a one-year trial
basis with appropriate review at the
end of that time; and that the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
will consider each Army course
proposal for academic credit on its
academic merits, with no presumption
that any such proposal will be
accepted; and further resolved that the
Senate urge President Pitzer to do
everything possible to press for the
elimination of the punitive provisions
in individual ROTC contracts."

committee," he added. Dornbusch
also argued that the CUS will be
put in an unfair situation. The
threat that Army ROTC might
leave if no credit were actually
given might force the CUS to
approve courses they might
otherwise not.
Only Affects Army
Although the proposal dealt
only with the Army, Pitzer had
indicated before the meeting that
the Navy and Air Force would
probably be willing to accept
similar proposals. Lt. Col. Leon
Heinle of Air Force ROTC said
after the decision had been
reached, "Using this a model,
we're going to have to sit down
and work out our own proposal."
The resolution adopted by the
faculty Senate read in full as
follows:
"Resolved that the Senate approves
acceptance of the Army proposal
referred to in the Jan. 16, 1970
memorandum of President Pitzer,
subject to the understanding that
acceptance shall be on a one-year trial
basis with appropriate review at the
end of that time; and that the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
will consider each Army course
proposal for academic credit on its
academic merits, with no presumption
that any such proposal will be
accepted; and further resolved that the
Senate urge President Pitzer to do
everything possible to press for the
elimination of the punitive provisions
in individual ROTC contracts."
The faculty Senate approved
possible limited academic credit
for Army ROTC on a one-year
trial basis last night.
After a lengthy three and a
ha If-hour debate the Senate
ratified 23-13 the Army proposal
to grant unit credit to courses
approved by the Committee on
Undergraduate Education (CUS)
as undergraduate specials. Each
course will be evaluated "on its
own academic merits."
The new contract will be on a
"one-year trial basis with
appropriate review at the end of
that time. . The resolution
emphasizes that the courses will
be reviewed strictly on a normal
basis. To remove any outside

pressure on the CUS for approval
of credit the resolution says there
will be no presumption that credit
should be given to the Army
courses in order to keep ROTC on
campus.
About 125 students seeking an
end to ROTC on campus gathered
outside the Graduate School of
Business building before the
Senate met, but did not obstruct
entry to the meeting. About 25
conservative students opposed to
disruptions also were present led
by Harvey Hukari.
Group To Meet
The anti-ROTC group
announced that it will hold an
open discussion today at 3 p.m. in
Cubberly Auditorium to
determine what response should

be made to yesterday's Senate
action.
The Senate also urged "the
President to do everything
possible to press for elimination
of the punitive provisions in
individual ROTC contracts."
These provisions threaten an
ROTC student with active duty as
an enlisted man if he drops out of
the program during the last two
years of the four-year program, or
last year of other programs.
In his opening statements on
the ROTC issue, President Pitzer
told the Senate, "To flatly refuse
consideration of credit would be
seen by many as undue
discrimination against military
science when we have a
reasonably flexible system for
credit."
Eliminates Departments
The Army proposal will
eliminate departmental status for
ROTC and remove its instructors
from the Academic Council.
Colonel Stanley Ramey of Army
ROTC has indicated that he will
seek to have six to nine units
approved for credit.
Many people thought Senate
action would be postponed to
allow further discussion. Instead,
several faculty members anticipate
that the Senate's decision will be
reviewed by the full Academic
Council, allowing for more
debate. If 50 faculty members
petition, the decision will be
brought before the entire faculty.
Last April, the faculty voted
403-356 that "after a transitional
period, there should be no
academic credit received for
participation in programs of
military training and education,"
sustaining an earlier 28-8 Senate
vote.
Dornbusch Opposes
In opposing credit for ROTC,
Sociology Professor Stanford
Dornbusch, said ". . .to affirm
today's report is essentially a
partial reversal (of last year's
decision) without taking a firm
stand. CUS i* not the appropriate
body to make decisions on credit

in the kind of political
atmosphere which necessarily
would be involved in deciding
credit for ROTC."
After the meeting, the sponsor
of the motion, Law Prof. Kenneth
Scott, said, "It seemed to me that
the process we were involved in
was reformulating ROTC to make
it more acceptable to the
University. . .and it is only
attainable in stages. In all
likelihood it was all we could get
in stage one."
Prof. Scott expressed his
opinion that the punitive clauses
in ROTC contracts with students
''continues to be rather
unsatisfactory." He said an
amendment offered and then
withdrawn by Statistics Prof.
Herbert Solomon demanded that
the Army withdraw their punitive
clause within a limited time
period. According to Scott,
although many Senate members
supported the elimination of this
clause, most felt that it would be
impractical to put an ultimatum
before the Army regarding it.
Pitzer Not Approached
Members of the radical group
outside the meeting were urged to
talk to faculty members as they
made their way inside. However,
most Senate members including
President Pitzer, were not
approached as they entered.
After the meeting started more
than 100 persons moved into
Bishop Auditorium and listened
to a broadcast of the senate
discussion Most of those listening
left after about an hour, long
before the Senate's decision.
The radical coalitionhas called
itself the New Stanford
Moratorium, but is not related to
the Vietnam Moratorium
Committee.
Lyman Defends ROTC
Provost Richard Lyman
defended the ROTC proposal
during the meeting. "No one must
take ROTC. The faculty is in
about as full control of course
content as it ever is. And
significant advantages accure to

many students in the form of
scholarship support not
forthcoming from other sources."
Prof. Alan S. Manne,
economics, who headed the
advisory committee but disagreed
with its report, argued, the
referendum reviewing the Senate's
actions, a majority of the faculty
favored retention of the ROTC
units on campus as an
extracurricular activity but
without academic credit. "In my
view this faculty decision was a
sound one and long overdue
overdue by decades.
"To ask CUS to administer
courses of this type is to ask for
continual headaches, and to
politicize the tasks of that
committee," he added. Dornbusch
also argued that the CUS will be
put in an unfair situation. The
threat that Army ROTC might
leave if no credit were actually

most Senate members including
President Pitzer, were not
approached as they entered.
After the meeting started more
than 100 persons moved into
Bishop Auditorium and listened
to a broadcast of the senate
discussion Most of those listening
left after about an hour, long
before the Senate's decision.
The radical coalitionhas called
itself the New Stanford
Moratorium, but is not related to
the Vietnam Moratorium
Committee.
Lyman Defends ROTC
Provost Richard Lyman
defended the ROTC proposal
during the meeting. "No one must
take ROTC. The faculty is in
about as full control of course
content as it ever is. And
significant advantages accure to

many students in the form of
scholarship support not
forthcoming from other sources."
Prof. Alan S. Manne,
economics, who headed the
advisory committee but disagreed
with its report, argued, the
referendum reviewing the Senate's
actions, a majority of the faculty
favored retention of the ROTC
units on campus as an
extracurricular activity but
without academic credit. "In my
view this faculty decision was a
sound one and long overdue
overdue by decades.
"To ask CUS to administer
courses of this type is to ask for
continual headaches, and to
politicize the tasks of that
committee," he added. Dornbusch
also argued that the CUS will be
put in an unfair situation. The
threat that Army ROTC might
leave if no credit were actually
given might force the CUS to
approve courses they might
otherwise not.
Only Affects Army
Although the proposal dealt
only with the Army, Pitzer had
indicated before the meeting that
the Navy and Air Force would
probably be willing to accept
similar proposals. Lt. Col. Leon
Heinle of Air Force ROTC said
after the decision had been
reached, "Using this a model,
we're going to have to sit down
and work out our own proposal."
The resolution adopted by the
faculty Senate read in full as
follows:
"Resolved that the Senate approves
acceptance of the Army proposal
referred to in the Jan. 16, 1970
memorandum of President Pitzer,
subject to the understanding that
acceptance shall be on a one-year trial
basis with appropriate review at the
end of that time; and that the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
will consider each Army course
proposal for academic credit on its
academic merits, with no presumption
that any such proposal will be
accepted; and further resolved that the
Senate urge President Pitzer to do
everything possible to press for the
elimination of the punitive provisions
in individual ROTC contracts."
The faculty Senate approved
possible limited academic credit
for Army ROTC on a one-year
trial basis last night.
After a lengthy three and a
ha If-hour debate the Senate
ratified 23-13 the Army proposal
to grant unit credit to courses
approved by the Committee on
Undergraduate Education (CUS)
as undergraduate specials. Each
course will be evaluated "on its
own academic merits."
The new contract will be on a
"one-year trial basis with
appropriate review at the end of
that time. . The resolution
emphasizes that the courses will
be reviewed strictly on a normal
basis. To remove any outside

pressure on the CUS for approval
of credit the resolution says there
will be no presumption that credit
should be given to the Army
courses in order to keep ROTC on
campus.
About 125 students seeking an
end to ROTC on campus gathered
outside the Graduate School of
Business building before the
Senate met, but did not obstruct
entry to the meeting. About 25
conservative students opposed to
disruptions also were present led
by Harvey Hukari.
Group To Meet
The anti-ROTC group
announced that it will hold an
open discussion today at 3 p.m. in
Cubberly Auditorium to
determine what response should

be made to yesterday's Senate
action.
The Senate also urged "the
President to do everything
possible to press for elimination
of the punitive provisions in
individual ROTC contracts."
These provisions threaten an
ROTC student with active duty as
an enlisted man if he drops out of
the program during the last two
years of the four-year program, or
last year of other programs.
In his opening statements on
the ROTC issue, President Pitzer
told the Senate, "To flatly refuse
consideration of credit would be
seen by many as undue
discrimination against military
science when we have a
reasonably flexible system for
credit."
Eliminates Departments
The Army proposal will
eliminate departmental status for
ROTC and remove its instructors
from the Academic Council.
Colonel Stanley Ramey of Army
ROTC has indicated that he will
seek to have six to nine units
approved for credit.
Many people thought Senate
action would be postponed to
allow further discussion. Instead,
several faculty members anticipate
that the Senate's decision will be
reviewed by the full Academic
Council, allowing for more
debate. If 50 faculty members
petition, the decision will be
brought before the entire faculty.
Last April, the faculty voted
403-356 that "after a transitional
period, there should be no
academic credit received for
participation in programs of
military training and education,"
sustaining an earlier 28-8 Senate
vote.
Dornbusch Opposes
In opposing credit for ROTC,
Sociology Professor Stanford
Dornbusch, said ". . .to affirm
today's report is essentially a
partial reversal (of last year's
decision) without taking a firm
stand. CUS i* not the appropriate
body to make decisions on credit

in the kind of political
atmosphere which necessarily
would be involved in deciding
credit for ROTC."
After the meeting, the sponsor
of the motion, Law Prof. Kenneth
Scott, said, "It seemed to me that
the process we were involved in
was reformulating ROTC to make
it more acceptable to the
University. . .and it is only
attainable in stages. In all
likelihood it was all we could get
in stage one."
Prof. Scott expressed his
opinion that the punitive clauses
in ROTC contracts with students
''continues to be rather
unsatisfactory." He said an
amendment offered and then
withdrawn by Statistics Prof.
Herbert Solomon demanded that
the Army withdraw their punitive
clause within a limited time
period. According to Scott,
although many Senate members
supported the elimination of this
clause, most felt that it would be
impractical to put an ultimatum
before the Army regarding it.
