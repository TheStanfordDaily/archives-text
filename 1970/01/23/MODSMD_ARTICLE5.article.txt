## Nixon Says Peace Closer 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Here, at a
glance, is President Nixon's State
of the Union message Thursday:
Vietnam-peace - Peace must
always be America's priority,
progress toward this goal is being
made with prospects far greater
today than they were a year ago.
Military commitments
Policies are now obsolete which
came into being 25 years ago

which made it necessary and right
for America to assume the major
burden for the defense of freedom
in the world. The United States
shall reduce its involvement and
presence in other nations but shall
be faithful to its treaty
commitments.
Relations with other nations -
European allies-based on mutual
consultation and responsibility;

Latin America-deal with them as a
partner rather than a patron;
Asia-the new partnership concept
has been welcomed;
Russia-moving from era of
confrontation to an era of
negotiation.
Federal-state relations- "It is
time for a New Federalism, in
which after 190 years of power
flowing from the people and local
and state governments to
Washington, it will begin to flow
from Washington back to the
states and to the people."
Economy-Congress and the
administration must halt the rise
in the cost of living. The federal
budget must be balanced so
"American families will have a
better chance to balance their
family budgets." It will mean
rejecting spending programs which
would benefit some but result in
price increases for all.
Crime - This is the only area
where instead of a budget cut he
wants an increase to "declare and
win the war against the criminal
elements."
Pollution - He will propose the
most comprehensive and costly
program ever in the nation's
history, including a $10-billion
clean-waters program. He will
propose new financing methods to
purchase open space and park
lands before they are lost.
Research will be intensified and
strict standards and enforcement
produres will seek to control auto
pollution of the air.
Cities-Urban areas-Growth
must be redirected to reverse the
move from farms to cities. This
includes future decisions as to
where to build highways, locate
airports, acquire land or sell land
with "a clear objective of aiding a
balanced growth." Rural America
needs a "new kind of assistance"
as part of an over-all growth
policy for all America.
Yet Another
TEL A VIA (AP) - Israeli
paratroopers descended on an
Egyptian-held coral island in the
Red Sea Thursday, sank two
torpedo boats and killed 19
defenders in a mission to knock
out radar stations.
The Israelis claim that the
Egyptian radar system is now in
total disarray and Israeli planes
can roam at will over the Suez
Canal.
A military spokesman said the
raiders invaded the island of
Shadwan by helicopter with air

and naval support and captured
the radar station.
The Israelis said they also
captured 41 Egyptians and flew
them from the island, 12 square
miles of coral 30 miles southwest
of strategic Sharm el Skeikh on
Tiran Strait at the mouth of the
Gulf of Aqaba.
Israeli spokesmen reported
three Israeli soldiers were killed
and six wounded in the operation
which began at 9 a.m. and
brought the island under Israeli
control by 3 p.m.
There was no official word
whether the Israeli raiders had
withdrawn from the island-at the
southern entrance to the Gulf of
Suez 20 miles east of the African
coast.
Shadwan, eight miles long and
less than two miles wide, is one of
a string of coral islands used by
the Egyptians as radar bases to
check the movements of planes
and other Israeli forces operating
out of the Sinai Desert.
In Tel Aviv, the operation was
viewed as another major strike
against Soviet-made radar stations.
One was lifted intact out of Egypt
by Israeli commandos Dec. 26.
The Israelis say their warplanes
even have found little resistance
during recent bombing raids in
Cairo's outskirts.
Thursday's raid on the island
came in the wake of a ground
sortie Wednesday into Jordan by a
tank column which, according to
the Israelis, smashed Arab
guerrilla bases south of the Dead
Sea. Five guerrillas were listed as
killed in that operation.
Yablonski
CLEVELAND Ohio (AP) —
United Mine Workers union
insurgent Joseph Yablonski was
killed as he was about to testify
before a federal grand jury
probing UMW activities, official's
disclosed Thursday as murder
charges were filed against three
men.
The murder charges were filed
in Washington County, Pa., where
Yablonski, 59, his wife, Margaret,
57, and their daughter, Charlotte
Joanne, 25, were found shot to
death .lan. 5. They were filed
before Magistrate Louis I. Quail.
The three men were charged on
three separate counts of
first-degree murder. However,
Dist. Atty. Jesse Costa had said
earlier the men would be
prosecuted only on Joseph
Yablonski's killing.

The three men were arrested in
Cleveland, Ohio, by the FBI
Wednesday night and were
charged Thursday with conspiring
to kill Yablonski, obstructing
justice and conspiring to interfere
with Yablonski's rights as a union
member.
Lennon Haircut
AALBORG, Denmark
(AP)—Beatle John Lennon had his
long hair cut and his beard
trimmed in his north Jutland
retreat west of here and emerged
"a new personality," Danish
friends said Wednesday.
Lennon shed his Beatle image
in a session with a woman
hairdresser in the barn of the
former farm where he has been
staying for several weeks. He was
joined in the haircutting
ceremony by his wife, Yoko Ono,
her 5-year-old daughter Kyoko
and several friends.
Aage Rosendahl Nielsen, head
of the new experimental college
Lennon has joined, said Lennon
told him he sent for the
hairdresser "because I just felt like
shedding all that hair —and
because a new haircut might
enable me to move about
anonymously."
Lennon himself was not
reachable, nor was Miss Aase
Haukrogh, the Aalborg hairdresser
who traveled to the farmhouse on
Monday with scissors and combs.
Abortion. Bingo
SACRAMENTO (AP)-The
secretary of state's office
authorized distribution of
initiative petitions to allow local
option bingo and unrestricted
abortions. The abortion initiative
needs 325,173 signatures to
qualify for the November
election. The bingo proposal, a
constitutional amendment, needs
520,276.
The abortion proposal would
authorize a doctor to perform an
abortion whenever requested to
do so by a pregnant woman. The
sponsors of the petition drive
were identified as Charles Moench
Jensen and Sally Yoakum, both of
Santa Clara.
The bingo initiative, proposed
by Wayne T. Moore of San Diego,
would authorize cities and
counties to allow bingo games by
certain charitable and tax-exempt
organizations.
