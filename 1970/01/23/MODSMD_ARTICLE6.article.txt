## Then And Now 
### 
One year ago, the faculty Senate voted
25-8 that "there should not be academic
credit received for participation in
programs of military training and
education."
Yesterday, the Seante said Army ROTC
should receive credit "in accordance with
normal University procedures and granted
appropriate academic credit for those
courses which meet established University
standards."
We condemn this spineless reversal. We
condemn President Pitzer and the faculty
Seante for their undue haste in deciding an
issue of this magnitude. We condemn
whatever politics lay aback of the decision.
And if there is any merit to the
speculation that the decision was reached
with an eye to placating those who held
government purse strings, we doubly
condemn it.
We must emphasize that the Seante's
action must be viewed within the overall
perspective of national and world politics.
It is our conception of the world and not
our view of the university that dictates our
opposition to ROTC.

Unlike most of those in the Senate who
voted against President Pitzer's proposal,
we do not oppose the officer's training
programs because we think the University
should be neutral, apolitical. The
community of scholars must throw away
its antiseptic. So, on this point, we agree
with those who maintain that ROTC
should remain: the University has a real
role in this world.
Our fundamental disagreement derives
from a different conception of the
community that the university serves. We
vigorously deny its obligation to the nation
and affirm its duties to all of the 3.5 billion
people on this planet.
The bast resources of energy and talent
contained within a university cannot be
held at the beck and call of the leaders in
Washington when so much needs to be
done to improve the conditions of the vast
majority of people.
The interests of people are not tied to
the interests of nations, and the people
must be held above them.
