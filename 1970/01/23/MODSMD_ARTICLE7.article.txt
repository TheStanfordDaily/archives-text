llappv Birthday, Palty Eitel.
Editor, THE DAILY:
As one of the student members
on the President's Advisory
Committee on ROTC, I must
reply to some of the charges in
Mike Sweeney's "ROTC Caper"
column.
The proposed revisions in the
credit status of ROTC represent
considerably more than "virtually
no change." Not only would
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies review each proposed
course; it would be empowered to
(and expected to) reject credit for
any course failing to meet
Stanford's academic standards. I
think the C.U.S. would rightfully
resent Mr. Sweeney's implication
that it will automatically approve
any proposed military course
offering. Significantly, The Daily
advertisement of April 15, 1969,
in which "prominent and highly
respected faculty came out
publicly in support" of the
Academic Senate resolution on

ROTC specifically stated that
submission of military courses to
the C.U.S. for review and possible
accreditation was acceptable
under the terms of the resolution.
The "punitive clause in student
contracts" was not a major issue
with the Committee simply
because it is a matter of public
law, not ROTC policy. I might
recommend writing the chairman
of the House and Senate Armed
Services Committees with
suggestions for changes in this
unfortunate statute.
Most importantly, it is totally
untrue that the Advisory
Committee on ROTC was either
"hand-picked" or "stacked." The
three student members were
nominated by the ASSU Council
of Presidents, and the faculty
members nominated by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Council. All these
nominations were accepted by
President Pitzer. The faculty
members included one of the

drafters of the Senate resolution
(Dr: Van Slyke) and one of its
vigorous supporters in the Senate
(Dr. Manne). Furthermore, Vice
Provost Brooks and Colonel
Ramey attended the ROTC
Committee meetings strictly to
provide information for
committee members upon
request. Frankly, I find personally
offensive Mr. Sweeney's
implication that I was merely part
of a group "carefully picked" by
Dr. Pitzer to provide justification
for some nefarious scheme.
I could continue listing
misconceptions and distortions in
the column at some length, but
it's time for the Academic Senate
meeting. I look forward to seeing
Mr. Sweeney there, but he
probably won't recognize meâ€”l
seem to have left my storm
tropper boots at home this
morning.
