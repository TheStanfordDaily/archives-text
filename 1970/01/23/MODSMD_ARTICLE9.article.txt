# Helpless Population
## The 						Involuntary Risks Of Lead 
### Joshua Lederberg 
■ The shameful and preventable
tragedy of lead poisoning of
young children living in
dilapidated housing has been well
advertised in recent years. The
immediate cause is ancient,
crumbling paint and putty from
another era, lead having been
banned from these products for
interior use. Lead is still used in
some poster paints, however, and
I was shocked to hear a Palo Alto
paint salesman shrug off the
warning label on a product that he
claimed was widely distributed in
local schools.
We are also exposed very
widely to lead emitted from
automobile exhausts at the rate of
400 million pounds per year in
the U.S. as a byproduct of the use
of "lead alkyls" to improve the
octane rating of gasoline. We have
little evidence of population
damage from this source of lead,
though there is little doubt that it
is a principal source of the
accumulation of lead in the
bloodstream and bones of
city-dwellers. It is mathematically
certain that this general elebation
of environmental lead increases
the chance that a child who eats
lead paint will be pushed over the
brink of acute lead poisoning.
Animal Tumors
In animal studies, however, the
feeding of lead salts has been
confirmed to cause tomors of the
kidney, one of the many forms of
cancer which has been increasing
in civilized countries. Workers in
lead-handling industries have not
exhibited an unusual rare of
kidney cancer, so that this
particular suspicion is still
inconclusive. Tetraethyl lead itself
is well recognized as an acute
poison—for example a case was
recently reported of brain injury
and psychosis from sniffing leaded
gasoline. It also induced
lymphatic leukemia in mice,
according to experiments by Drs.
S.S. Epstein and N. Mantel of the
Children's Cancer Research
Foundation of Boston and the
National Cancer Institute. Lead
salts, again at high doses, have
produced chromosome breaks and
also congenital malformations in
experimental animals. This effect
was exaggerated by the
simultaneous administration of
cadmium, another air-pollutant
metal.
Ilclple ss Population
We cannot reliably translate
these experimental results into
measures of damage to man at the
levels we experience from day to
day. To say the least, they can be
no basis for assurance or
complacency. The basic thrust of
this research is not so new as the
revolution in public attitudes and
social policy, that a helpless
population should not be made to
bear the involuntary risk of our
uncertainties.
A new wrinkle has been
summarized in testimony before
California Assemblyman John F.
Foran's committee on air
pollution. Mr. Donald A. Jensen,
representing the Automobile
Manufacutrers ''Association,

pointed out that lead additives
complicate the general problem of
smog control, quite apart form
their own potential health hazard.
He quoted studies by Ford Motor
Co. engineers that "exhaust
hydrocarbon emission increased
with mileage considerably more
on gasoline with lead compared to
unleaded gasoline." Similar but
smaller effects were observed with
clean engines as well.
Lead Poisons
The presence of lead also
frustrates the development of
other approaches to controlling
emissions from exhausts—by

"poisoning" catalysts, and
clogging and eroding after-burners
and exhaust recirculators.
What more must we know
before concluding that the
community could do very well
without the use of lead in
gasoline!
Taking it out may most
something—perhaps to a level of a
tenth of the taxes now collected
on gasoline—for a while, until the
undoubted ingenuity of the
petrochemical industry has
surfaced with more economical
alternatives. In these
circumstances, it is an unfair

burden on the conscience and
reputation of individual oil
companies to wait for any
voluntary action on their part that
would expose them to
competition within the industry.
We might even find it profitable in
the long run to provide tax
incentives to the makers of lead
additives to divert their
production, by the same logic as
the incentives offered to other
polluters of the environment.
