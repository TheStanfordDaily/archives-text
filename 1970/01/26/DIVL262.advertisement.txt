MEMORIAL UNION
January 20, 1970
Not many people know it, but Tresidder Memorial Union is run by
students. Or at least part of it is. Nine students have a free hand to pro
duce films, concerts, exhibits, dances, lectures, or whatever under Tresid
der's sponsorship. As the duly constituted Tresidder Memorial Union
Board, the can advise the Director on the day-to-day running of the
Union, but recent boards have taken little interest in formulating policy.
Their energies have been spent almost exclusively on programming.
Except for two members appointed by the ASSU President, the Board
is independent of campus politics. It is self-perpetuating and its re
sources are available to all who want to use them. It is the purpose of
this letter to publicize these resources and to recruit more students to
make use of them.
The traditional programs in the Film, Lecture, Cultural Arts and Social
Divisions are now being arranged. There-will be films, exhibits, lectures
and perhaps a Sunday afternoon concert in Frost. But the campus com
munity would like to choose from a wider range of events. Students
would like to choose from a wider range of events. Students would at
tend concerts by Buddy Guy, The Band, etc., or a Spring Fair if it were
produced; but these events just arent's scheduled. And the reason is that
there aren't enough students willing to take the time to schedule them.
The resources necessary to produce them are available through Union
Board.
Anyone who is interested in producing a new type of program on
campus or would like to take part in maintaining the traditional fare is
invited to come to Tresidder, Room 268, at 4:15 on Wednesday, January
28, or to leave your name at the TMU Information Desk.
Sincerely Yours,
Ted Loring, Jr.
Union Board Chairman
