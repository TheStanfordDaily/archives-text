# Reed Affair
## ASSU May Go To Judiciary 
### 
The Associated Students of
Stanford University may institute
judicial action against student
Roger Reed, head of the Political
Union, to determine responsibility
for paying over $3500 in speaker's
fees.
Reed, in an article in the Arena
last week charged that the ASSU
was being irresponsible by not
paying the debts. ASSU students
financial manager David Swift
claimed that the debts belong to
Reed, not the ASSU, since Reed
never presented the contracts for
Swift's signature.
The controversy centers
around contracts for speeches
delivered last fall by New York
Times editor Harrison Salisbury,
Senator Barry Goldwater, and
author William F. Bukcley. Reed
contracted for the speeches last
summer.
In a statement to the Daily last
night Reed said —
This year the Political Union Board
has brought to campus several
outstanding speakers of wide interest
to the Stanford community. Senator
Goldwater and William F. Buckley
both packed Memorial Auditorium,
which has a capacity of around 1700
people. Harrison Salisbury almost
packed Dinkelsplel Auditorium, which
has a capacity of around 700. Mayor
Alioto spoke to around 800 people.
In presenting the Symposium
"America on the Threshold of the
Seventies," the Political Union Board
did not exceed its projected budget,
which was based on past
appropriations and the
recommendations of last year's
Finance Committee.
Since we could not count on the
ASSU Senate to appropriate money for
William F. Buckley's appearance, it was
agreed to raise funds from private
sources.
As President of the Political Union,
l signed the contracts for Harrison
Salisbury and Senator Goldwater last
Spring. At that time, I was unaware of
any By-Law that required a
counter-signature by the .Student
Financial Manager."

According to Swift, there is no
question that Reed, as an adult, is
legally responsible for the
contracts. "He had no power to
put ASSU's name on the
contracts," said Swift. "Only I
have that power."
Only One Contract
The only contract which Swift
has been given is the contract with
Harry Walker, Inc. for
Goldwater's speech; he received it
Jan. 10. Goldwater spoke Nov.
12.
"The money for Goldwater
was due Nov. 13, so the bill was
two months overdue when I got
it. Those two months could have
been used to recognize, and then
work out the problem," Swift
added.
Swift sees the issue centering
around the question of who has to
pay, what happens to Roger Reed
as an individual, and what can be
done to prevent repetition of this
problem.
Swift said he would wait for
the report of the Senate
committee investigating the
matter before he looked into
possible Stanford Judicial Council
action.
Establishing Precedent
Any SJC action would be
aimed at establishing a precedent
in matters such as this. "I don't
want to screw Roger's life up, yet
I don't want to leave it open
ended so someone can step into
his footsteps," said Swift.
In a peripheral issue, a question
has arisen over whether Reed is
legally a member of the Political
Union Board. Several ASSU
senators have pointed out that the
Political Union By—laws call for
legislative ratification of Political
Union Board members, and that
this step was never taken.

Senate members were further
incensed by the fact that even if
they approved the requested
$4944 appropriation for the year,
nearly all of the money will
already have been spent on first
quarter activities. The senate last
Thursday postponed action on
Political Union appropriations
until its committee reports.


AGAINST ROTC REINSTATEMENT - About 150
students demonstrated without incident outside
the faculty club last Thursday to protest President
Pitzer's recommendation to review ROTC courses

for credit on an individual basis. Inside the club,
the Senate approved the plan, but disgruntled
faculty today are circulating a petition that would
call upon the entire Academic Council to review
the Senate motion.
