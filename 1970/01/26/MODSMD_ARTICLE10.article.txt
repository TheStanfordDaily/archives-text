# USE To Negotiate In Firing Dispute
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
Though still in the process of
drafting and adopting a
Constitution, the United Stanford
Employees, USE, met last
Thursday to elect a slate of
officers, and to discuss problems
involving their relationship to the
University community.
While the ballots were being
tallied, Jim Berk, of the Grievance
Committee, presented a proposal
dealing with a situation that has
arisen at the Stanford University
Press.
According to Berk, Ken Garner
was laid off his job for obscure
reasons two weeks after having
been elected on a reform platform
as an officer in the local
Bookbinders Union.
Shortly after his election,
Garner raised an overtime
grievance with the foreman, and
suddenly there was a "lack of
work" and Garner was laid off.
In December, Tony Norman, a
Black warehouseman at the Press
was fired in his third month after
having been given a raise in his
second month. Berk believes that
the real reason behind the firing
was not a "lack of experience" as
the management put it, but the
fact that Norman was Garner's
roommate.
Berk's proposal, adopted
unanimously by the members of
USE, reads as follows:
"1. The Stanford grievance
procedure (Guide Memo 22.10)
either must apply to all Stanford

employees or alternate procedures
must be negotiated by those
employees;
"2. That a three member
Special Committee be elected to
negotiate with President Pitzer, or
his delegate, to resolve this
injustice immediately;
"3. That this committee
contact other employee
organizations so as to negotiate
together with President Pitzer;
"4. That this committee
contact the Black Students Union
because of the special situation of
Black employees at the Press and
the case of Tony Norman so as to
negotiate together with President
Pitzer;
"5. That since further firings
appear possible, due to association
with Ken Garner and his attempts
to defend himself and his fellow
Press workers, USE caution
Stanford Press management to
refrain from hasty action in this
troubled period. If management
continues to fire people for
questionable reasons, we
employees will have to find more
rapid, active, and effective means
to protect our rights and
ourselves."
After some debate as to the
validity of several ballots, the
results of the election were
announced with Roland Finston,
Fran Domby, Dick Chapton, Ritz
Kuhn, Jack Bernstein, and Rich
Kirschner, filling the newly
formed organizational offices.

Though still in the process of
drafting and adopting a
Constitution, the United Stanford
Employees, USE, met last
Thursday to elect a slate of
officers, and to discuss problems
involving their relationship to the
University community.
While the ballots were being
tallied, Jim Berk, of the Grievance
Committee, presented a proposal
dealing with a situation that has
arisen at the Stanford University
Press.
According to Berk, Ken Garner
was laid off his job for obscure
reasons two weeks after having
been elected on a reform platform
as an officer in the local
Bookbinders Union.
Shortly after his election,
Garner raised an overtime
grievance with the foreman, and
suddenly there was a "lack of
work" and Garner was laid off.
In December, Tony Norman, a
Black warehouseman at the Press
was fired in his third month after
having been given a raise in his
second month. Berk believes that
the real reason behind the firing
was not a "lack of experience" as
the management put it, but the
fact that Norman was Garner's
roommate.
Berk's proposal, adopted
unanimously by the members of
USE, reads as follows:
"1. The Stanford grievance
procedure (Guide Memo 22.10)
either must apply to all Stanford

employees or alternate procedures
must be negotiated by those
employees;
"2. That a three member
Special Committee be elected to
negotiate with President Pitzer, or
his delegate, to resolve this
injustice immediately;
"3. That this committee
contact other employee
organizations so as to negotiate
together with President Pitzer;
"4. That this committee
contact the Black Students Union
because of the special situation of
Black employees at the Press and
the case of Tony Norman so as to
negotiate together with President
Pitzer;
"5. That since further firings
appear possible, due to association
with Ken Garner and his attempts
to defend himself and his fellow
Press workers, USE caution
Stanford Press management to
refrain from hasty action in this
troubled period. If management
continues to fire people for
questionable reasons, we
employees will have to find more
rapid, active, and effective means
to protect our rights and
ourselves."
After some debate as to the
validity of several ballots, the
results of the election were
announced with Roland Finston,
Fran Domby, Dick Chapton, Ritz
Kuhn, Jack Bernstein, and Rich
Kirschner, filling the newly
formed organizational offices.
