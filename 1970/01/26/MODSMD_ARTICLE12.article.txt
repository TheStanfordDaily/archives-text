# Free U Opens Coffee House
## 
### 
After a two year struggle to
find a home, the Free University
community this week announced
that it will open its
restaur ant-coffeehouse-commu
nity center at the gateway to Palo
Alto, on the corner of University
Avenue and The Circle, opposite
the Paris theatre, in a building
occupied by the now defunct
Tangent restaurant. Renovation of
the premises, to make it more
compatible with community
needs, will start officially on Feb.
Ist. Opening is scheduled for
sometime in mid-February.
"A restaurant and coffee house
that serves good food at people's
prices is long overdue in Palo
Alto," Mark Jensen, nominal
owner of the business said
yesterday, speaking for the ad hoc
negotiation committee. "This will
be a community operation," he
said. "We 11 build it ourselves and
govern it ourselves. We hope that
many different types of people
and different age groups will take
part. That's the only way to make
it responsive to the needs of the
people who use it."
A non-profit cooperative will
ultimately own the restaurant
which has tentatively been
renamed "The Free Tangent."
Membership "shares" will be sold
at nominal prices, ($5 and up),
with all members voting equally.
A governing board will be elected
by the membership and will take
responsibility for carrying on the
policy decisions of the
membership.

The Free University has been
trying to lease a building in
downtown Palo Alto since the
spring of 1968, but there has been
considerable pressure to keep it
out. Two close tries ended in
failure, once when Warren Thoits,
owner of a building at High and
Hamilton streets failed to
complete leasing arrangements
after a verbal understanding had
been reached and once when
building code restrictions made
costs of renovating the building
adjacent to the Tangent
prohibitive.
Now in possession of a place of
their own, the Free University

community declares its intention
to operate a coffee house and
restaurant that will serve all
segments of the Stanford and
mid-peninsula community. "We
hope this will become a meeting
place where people of all points of
view—street people and straights,
students and faculty, dropouts,
workers and business men —will
feel comfortable," Tim Coburn,
Stanford graduate student on the
original community stated.
A meeting to discuss
renovation and operation plans
has been set for Sunday, Feb. 1, 6
p.m., on the premises. All
interested persons are welcome.
