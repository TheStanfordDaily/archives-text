# 'King Of Hearts' Returns
## This Week's Films 'Among Best' 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Showing on campus screens
this week are among the best films
of Josef Von Sternberg, Georges
Franju, Philippe de Broca, Jean
Vigo, Elia Kazan and Akira
Kurosawa.
The Grapes of Wrath has
always been regarded as a
Hollywood classic and though
John Steinbeck's literary
reputation has paled, John Ford's
film remains engrossing if a bit
sentimental. This 1940 Academy
Award winner was photographed
by Gregg Toland (Citizen Kane)
and features Henry Fonda, Jane
Darwell, John Carradine and, in a
small part, Charles Middleton
(Flash Gordon's 'Ming'). At
Bishop Auditorium on Monday at
7:30, sponsored by the Literature
and Revolution course.
On Tuesday in Geology 320,
Clive Miller will show one of the
thirties' most fabulous films,
Shanghai Express. Josef Von
Sternberg's direction is
outrageously good, as his camera
moves from character to
mysterious character and setting
to exotic setting.
Marlene Dietrich has never
been better, her sexual ambiguity
being mystified even further by
hypnotic lighting and an
ever-present cloud of cigarette
smoke. This sublime
entertainment will show at 8:30,
preceded at 8 by Laurel and
Hardy in The Music Box. Showing
at 10 is Hands Across the Table, a
delightful comedy starring Carole
Lombard, Fred Mac Murray and
Ralph Bellamy, directed by
Mitchell Leisen.

Georges Franju has been one of
the most prominent and
individualistic figures in modern
French cinema and was
co-founder of the Cinematheque
Francaise, yet his films have not
been widely seen in this country.
Judex isn't really typical of the
bulk of the director's work but
this 1963 condensation of Louis
Feuillade's twelve episode
"Judex" crime serial of 1916 is
constantly entertaining and
sometimes striking. This
International Association film will
be shown on Thursday at 7:45 in
Cubberley.

Despite the Academy Awards
lavished upon it in 1949, Robert
Rolen's All the King's Men
remains an ineffective screen
adaptation of Robert Penn
Warren's superb novel. Broderick
Crawford is intriguing as Willie
Stark/Huey Long, but far too
much time is devoted to the
personal problems of the young
journalist for the picture to even
be potent politically. In Bishop
Auditorium on Thursday at 7 and
9.
I feel that Mickey One was
undeservedly neglected by most

critics, though Arthur Penn's
strained allegorical touches
ultimately rendered the film
affectedly Europeanized. Warren
Beatty's Method is inspired as
often as it is mannered and Penn's
camera often produces stark and
lyrical results. An uneven but, I
think, curious and commendable
experiment. At Tresidder on
Friday at 7, 8 and 9.
Favorite Returns
It seems to me that King of
Hearts was received here last
spring as warmly as any other film
was all year. As Philippe de Broca
is one of my favorite directors and
King of Hearts one of my ten
favorite films of the sixties, I
recommend this unique anti-war
comedy in the strongest terms.
With Alan Bates and Genevieve
Bujold. At 7 and 9:30 in
Cubberley on Friday.
Though Elia K.azan s un mc
Waterfront appears overly
melodramatic and theatrical
today, it is an undeniable
American classic and a sober look
at the kind of labor problems
which still plague us today (i.e.,
the Yablonski murders). Giving
strong support to Marlon Brando's
brilliant performance are Eva
Marie Saint, Karl Maiden, Lee J.
Cobb, Rod Steiger and composer
Leonard Bernstein. In Rinconada
Dining Hall on Friday at 11.
Must See
Jean Vigo's Zero for Conduct
is an absolute must-see, for the
comic invention and inspired
anarchy of this 45-minute film are
amazing. Made in 1932, the
picture depicts a revolt at a
French boys' school and can claim
Truffaut's The 400 Blows and
Anderson's 1f.... as direct
descendants.
The pillow fight scene is one of
the most effective slow motion
sequences to have been used up to

that time and has rarely been
surpassed even since. Also
showing in the underground film
series on Friday at 11 in Geology
320 are Ed Emshwiller's
"Relativity," Fernand Leger's
''Ballet Mecanique" and
"Poontang Trilogy."
Yojimbo is one of the most
exciting (and funny) action films
I've ever seen. Toshiro Mifune is
marvellous as a wise-guy samurai
who sides with warring factions
according to who is willing to pay
more at a given moment. Akira
Kurosawa demonstrates his visual
mastery in this film, which later
served as the basis for the Italian
western, A Fistful of Dollars. At
Cubberley on Saturday at 7:30
and 10.
Controversial 'Caretaker'
Clive Donner's controversial
The Caretaker (The Cuest) will be
shown on Saturday at Tresidder at
7, 8 and 9. With a screenplay by
Harold Pinter, the film offers
brilliant performances from its
stellar trio of Alan Bates, Donald
Pleasence and Robert Shaw.
The second new film in the
New Line Cinema series being
presented by ASSU is The Virgin
President. This American political
satire stars Severn Darden as the
hopelessly inept Fillard Millmore
and features many of the nation's
talented young improvisational
comics. At Dinkelspiel on
Saturday with the shorts "Shadow
of an Apple" and "Action Speaks
Louder Than Platforms."
The First Time is a pretty frail
comedy about three teenage boys
trying to lose their virginity. That
one of these brats should actually
be allowed to make it with the
magnificent Jacqueline Bisset is
one of the most disgusting
violations (of taste and of woman)
in recent memory. At the Sunday
Flicks.


MYSTERIOSOâ€”MarIene Dietrich and Clive Brook star in Josef von Sternberg's
fabulous Shanghai Express, showing Tuesday night in Geology 320.
