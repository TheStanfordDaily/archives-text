# Oakland Is Only Second Rate, But Programs Are Modern
## 
### DALE PARKER 
There is something wonderful
about being second-rate. It is
more than just trying harder;
maybe it is the willingness to lose
once in a while.
Although not the equal of its
San Francisco counterpart, the
Oakland Symphony makes up for
its technical shortcomings and
lack of class in other ways, most
importantly through its
adventurous programs, which
seem to be the single-handed
effort of Maestro Gerhard Samuel.
In spite of extreme pressure
from conservative patrons, he has
constantly attempted to keep the
symphony concert a living event
of this century, rather than a
quaint antique, by playing strange
and visionary pieces designed to
stretch our ears to the limit.
The program last week was a
model of clarity and form. The
first half of the program
contained works from the classic
period (Rossini's overture to "The
Barber of Seville"), the
neoclassicism of Stravinsky ("Jeu
de Cartes," which uses a theme
from the Rossini overture), and a
piece from the "good-grief-this-is

-music?" school —the world
premiere of "Confrontations," by
David Sheinfeld.
Mirroring the musical evolution
of the first half of the program
was Richard Strauss' tone poem,
"Also Sprach Zarathustra," which
is supposed to depict the
evolution of man through various
philosophical and religious chases,
up to Nietzche's "superman."
After a brisk performance of
the overture, full of life and crisp
strings, "Heu de Cartes" never got
started. Stravinsky's "ballet in
three deals" is a playful piece, and
if any solemnity intrudes it can
fall flat. In this performance the
Coplandish theme representing
the shuffling of the cards was
heavy enough to have been the
Last Judgment, and Samuel's
tempos were so slow it seemed he
visualized it being danced by
pregnant ballerinas.
Going to a concert is a lot like
going to church. There is the same
sense of ritual, the formal
clothing, and the worship of
sacred objects, in this case the
"masterpieces of music." From
this traditional perspective,
"Confrontations" was a failure.

It was probably quite shocking
to much of the audience, for they
expected music, and this was
more than that. This piece was an
environment, which demanded
the involvement and participation
of the audience. On these terms it
was a success.
There were titters throughout
the crowd, some ham acting by
the orchestra, a spontaneous bit
of applause from the balcony
during the performance, and some
truly hilarious frowns on the faces
of people around me. It was never
boring.
"Confrontations," as the name
implies, is a frenzied collage, in
the manner of Ives, but with none
of Ives restraint and sense of
form. It was the musical
equivalent of "Laugh-In."
There was something for
everyone: a little jazz-sax, some
brass band hymns, a dash of
Liberace cocktail piano, some
Benny Goodman nostalgia, and
the übiquitous great clots of
dissonant noise. The piece
employed three conductors, plus
electric violin and an electric
guitar (which was totally wasted;
Sheinfeld obviously has no
interest in the rock medium).
Then came "Zarathustra." The
inspired "Dawn" prologue,
certainly one of the most exciting
moments in all of music, has been
enhanced even more by its use in
2001. It is sad that the rest of the
piece never lives up to the brilliant
promise of the opening. Strauss'
vision of the "Superman" as some
sort of Viennese dandy waltzing
around at a society ball is a
prattling burlesque.
This inappropriate smaltz at
the supreme moment in man's
evolution was made even more
comic by the solo violinist, who
appeared to be ready to spit on
his instrument at any moment.
The fault, however, lies with
Strauss, and not with the
orchestra, for they performed
heroically throughout,

Samuel's last year, and after he is

imagination as this will be rare,

"Confrontations," as the name
implies, is a frenzied collage, in
the manner of Ives, but with none
of Ives restraint and sense of
form. It was the musical
equivalent of "Laugh-In."
There was something for
everyone: a little jazz-sax, some
brass band hymns, a dash of
Liberace cocktail piano, some
Benny Goodman nostalgia, and
the übiquitous great clots of
dissonant noise. The piece
employed three conductors, plus
electric violin and an electric
guitar (which was totally wasted;
Sheinfeld obviously has no
interest in the rock medium).
Then came "Zarathustra." The
inspired "Dawn" prologue,
certainly one of the most exciting
moments in all of music, has been
enhanced even more by its use in
2001. It is sad that the rest of the
piece never lives up to the brilliant
promise of the opening. Strauss'
vision of the "Superman" as some
sort of Viennese dandy waltzing
around at a society ball is a
prattling burlesque.
This inappropriate smaltz at
the supreme moment in man's
evolution was made even more
comic by the solo violinist, who
appeared to be ready to spit on
his instrument at any moment.
The fault, however, lies with
Strauss, and not with the
orchestra, for they performed
heroically throughout,
Go to see the Oakland
Symphony. This is Maestro
Samuel's last year, and after he is
gone programs with as much
imagination as this will be rare,

There is something wonderful
about being second-rate. It is
more than just trying harder;
maybe it is the willingness to lose
once in a while.
Although not the equal of its
San Francisco counterpart, the
Oakland Symphony makes up for
its technical shortcomings and
lack of class in other ways, most
importantly through its
adventurous programs, which
seem to be the single-handed
effort of Maestro Gerhard Samuel.
In spite of extreme pressure
from conservative patrons, he has
constantly attempted to keep the
symphony concert a living event
of this century, rather than a
quaint antique, by playing strange
and visionary pieces designed to
stretch our ears to the limit.
The program last week was a
model of clarity and form. The
first half of the program
contained works from the classic
period (Rossini's overture to "The
Barber of Seville"), the
neoclassicism of Stravinsky ("Jeu
de Cartes," which uses a theme
from the Rossini overture), and a
piece from the "good-grief-this-is

-music?" school —the world
premiere of "Confrontations," by
David Sheinfeld.
Mirroring the musical evolution
of the first half of the program
was Richard Strauss' tone poem,
"Also Sprach Zarathustra," which
is supposed to depict the
evolution of man through various
philosophical and religious chases,
up to Nietzche's "superman."
After a brisk performance of
the overture, full of life and crisp
strings, "Heu de Cartes" never got
started. Stravinsky's "ballet in
three deals" is a playful piece, and
if any solemnity intrudes it can
fall flat. In this performance the
Coplandish theme representing
the shuffling of the cards was
heavy enough to have been the
Last Judgment, and Samuel's
tempos were so slow it seemed he
visualized it being danced by
pregnant ballerinas.
Going to a concert is a lot like
going to church. There is the same
sense of ritual, the formal
clothing, and the worship of
sacred objects, in this case the
"masterpieces of music." From
this traditional perspective,
"Confrontations" was a failure.

It was probably quite shocking
to much of the audience, for they
expected music, and this was
more than that. This piece was an
environment, which demanded
the involvement and participation
of the audience. On these terms it
was a success.
There were titters throughout
the crowd, some ham acting by
the orchestra, a spontaneous bit
of applause from the balcony
during the performance, and some
truly hilarious frowns on the faces
of people around me. It was never
boring.
