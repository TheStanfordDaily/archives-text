# Injured Wrestlers Win Sixth Straight
## 
### 
Down three team points with
three matches left, Stanford
rallied to win all three as they
defeated UC Santa Barbara 22-14.
This was a big win for the
wrestlers in many ways. UCSB
with a 10-3 mark coming into the
match was considered to be the
strongest team that the Indians
have faced thus far. Additionally,
they kept record perfect with a 6-0
mark.
Once again there were many
good performances. Dave
Kopolow, who just recovered
from an illness, beat a tough
wrestler in Dons Amstutz of
UCSB. Len Smith got his first fall
of the season and Williams picked
up his second. Crenshaw and Fair
both decisioned their men by
large margins and Thomas
continued his winning string with
a 5-2 decision.
Co-captain Bill Ross is running
into his share of tough opponents
as he was decisioned 3-2.

With the season one-third over,
the Indians have some strong
teams to face. San Francisco State
will be the strongest team the
young wrestlers will face yet. If all
the unbeaten wrestlers can
continue to win, then the chances
for a strong finish will be
strengthened.
The wrestling team will host
SF State this Wednesday at 7:30
p.m. at the renovated Old
Pavillion.
