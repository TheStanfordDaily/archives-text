# A 						Different Seminar
## The 						Asilomar Adventure 
### H. Renton Rolph 
This weekend's Asilomar
seminar, quite successful in the
face of severe political limitations
and somewhat more interesting
than successful, concluded on a
note of inauspicious discordance.
And ending in the lurch as it did,
with the precipitate exodus of
many of the University's highest
officers (including the President)
was clearly unnecessary.
Because of the mini-walkout in
the face of Patrick Shea's
suggestion that the group adopt a
resolution for the establishment
of a tripartite "Politboro," some
important words were not
exchanged which, I felt, left the
meeting hanging. As a member of
the ASSU I want to thank all
those men and women—profes
sors, University officers, and
students—who attended the
seminar. I would hope that
everyone, including the sometimes
overly defensive members of the
Administration, felt the
experience constructive and
worthwhile, notwithstanding the
unfortunately high-handed
character of its denouement.
Furthermore, it is hoped that this
somewhat ugly finale will not
increase the apprehensiveness with
which University officers
approach an event of this nature
and without whom possible future
seminars, or, if you will,
conferences, would lose much of
their importance.
What happened at Asilomar,
although billed as a conference,
seemed to me to be much more
like a seminar which moved in the
direction of an encounter group,
though never really approaching
that level except perhaps at the
midnight meetings. But
significantly and thankfully, the
formality of a conference
situation was avoided.
Now the purpose of a seminar
is frank, open exchange, not at all
the construction and elucidation
of a one-ness of mind in the form
of a resolution agreed upon by all
those present. Conferences,
though, do produce resolutions
and, in that the meeting was
nominally a conference, perhaps
the host was nominally justified in
attempting to bring the group to
consensus and thereby resolution.
However, this move, in my
opinion, represented a regretable
misreading of the nature of the
meeting as well as an
overestimation of its possibilities.
Good Points
Enough on the minor failings
of form in an event otherwise
superbly well organized. I found
Walter Metzger, the historian from
Columbia who spoke on Saturday
morning, a delight. Bubbling with

ideas, expansive in his thinking
and warmly gentle in his delivery
(which one imagines is most
successful before small groups),
Professor Metzger affirmed a
current of thought which went
surprisingly unopposed by the
students in the room, at least, en
haute voix.
He characterized the
teacher-student relationship as
one of paternal asymetry wherein
the professor is never equal to the
student but remains in the
paternal role, which is distinct
from the paternalistic. This is a
highly useful distinction.
According to Dr. Metzger, the
professor is paternal because he
seeks to teach the student for the
student's own interest and
welfare. The paternalistic
relationship, however, rests on the
exploitation (commercial or
otherwise) of the receiving party,
and an example, though
ety mologically ironic, is the
relationship on which the oldest
profession, prostitution, thrives.
I find this distinction pleasing
and have always resisted the
self-adulatory notion that
students represent a group
exploited by their professors. The
question of meaningful, political
representation for students in the

University at large, though, is
another matter for which, I feel,
the Asilomar seminar furnished an
exciting proposal which I relate
below
With regard to teaching
Professor Metzger is likewise no
apologist for the lecture hall. He
decries the reduction of
intellectually rambunctious
students to the enforced passivity
of the lecture audience. Instead he
proposes team-teaching and the
abolition of the fifty minute
lecture. The first half of the
quarter, in his plan, would involve
free-wheeling sessions with
professors whenever the group felt
the desire to meet. In exchange,
the students would agree to work
on a paper or project during the
last half of the quarter without
the professor. If there are
interested professors and students
this format of the intense seminar
experience, followed by
independent reflection and
enterprise, could be adopted at
Stanford this spring. Perhaps Dr.
Philip Zimbardo's Social
Psychology could be the
experimental forum.
One other proposal for reform
which emerged (and persistently
so) at Asilomar is the unicameral,
community legislature. Professor

Metzger recounted that Columbia
now operates with this system,
having combined the faculty and
student Senates in the wake of the
1967 events. While there is the
danger of over-centralized power
in this system, as Professor
Metzger somewhat wistfully
observed, its advantages beg
consideration by the two Stanford
legislatures and the community at
large (as I observed).
Themes on Change
On this question, two recurrent
themes at Asilomar were first the
moral right of the faculty to
determine University policy in
academic as well as other matters
which affect the faculty, for
instance the current ROTC
question. The second theme was
that the moral right of the faculty
is often smothered by inertia. On
the other hand, the Student
Senate, with a far less persuasive
claim to influence, is
characterized by the exactly
complimentary qualities of
rambunctiousness, energy and
perhaps idealism. The unification
of these two bodies with suitable
regard to a not strictly numerical
proportionality, could be
symbiotic.
