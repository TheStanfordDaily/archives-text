# Jordan's Ideals Similar For Sports, Politics
## 
### FRED MANN 
Pay ton Jordan is an honest man. He is a brash,
aggressive man. He, more than most, knows where
he stands - in fact, where he has stood for the past
30 years. He appears to some self assured, to
others close minded.
He posseses all the qualities required of a
victorious general, or a championship coach, or a
successful California politician.
The first career he never attempted, the second
he accomplished, and the third may be right
around the corner.
Jordan is that curious creature, a natural born
politician, who, at the age of 54, has yet to take
electoral advantage of his talents of persuasion.
His powerful appearance, firm, convincing
voice, and definitive beliefs have made Jordan the
master of successful track teams at Stanford for 13
years, and patriarch of the entire school coaching
staff. His coaching philosophy is keyed by ideals
of discipline, order, and duty.
This theory of running a team has caused much
controversy in the past, and some individual
hardship, yet has proved "successful" in terms of
achieving the ultimate athletic goal—victory.
New Listeners
Now Jordan is thinking of giving it up and
entering California politics as a conservative
Republican candidate for Secretary of State. If he
makes the race, he will have an audience of more
than merely runners and jumpers to convince of
the value of his philosophy.
And Jordan's political values seem analogous to
his coaching theory. The ideas of discipline, order,
and individual duty override all political issues in
his eyes.
"I must be a positive force in whatever I do,"
he said. "I have not yet determined to run, but my
decision will be based on whether or not I know I
can do the job."
The Secretary of State is concerned mainly
with regulating voting procedures and corporation
practices.
Forceful Speaker
"I am convinced there is a place in government
for the ordinary citizen." The words came pouring
out and his eyes flashed with seeming conviction.
Jordan enjoyed talking forcefully and airing his
deep-rooted opinions.
"I've said what I believe all my
life, and people jump on me," he remarked. "I'm
used to the criticism. Today to be popular you

have to talk out of both sides of your mouth. I
make people nervous. I look them in the eye and
speak my ideals. I'm the antithesis of the love
children and they don't like me. That's okay with
me."
Although Jordan has gained the respect of
numerous athletes, he has also incurred the rath of
Harry Edwards and other blacks during the
Olympic boycott.
"It could have happened to anyone," Jordan
said. "I just happened to be the head Olympic
coach and great white father figure. They've called
me a racist because I'm not afraid to criticize any
man of not doing his job—no matter what color
he is."
Continuing Philosophy
If and when Jordan seeks office, Californians
can expect to hear the same philosophy on politics
that the coach has always been using for track.
Civilization is made up of law and order. And
law and order is based on discipline. Just as the
member of a team must discipline himself to
follow all the rules, all citizens must have an inner
discipline to guide them in judging right from
wrong.
"If you're old enough and have learned from
experience, your self discipline is going to be good
and correct; but if your inner discipline is wrong,
the right kind of discipline must be enforced on
you."
Jordan blames parents and educators for
causing the problems of today. "They have all
copped out," he said. "They are afraid to lay
down some basic rules to young people.
"I am a great believer in experience. I want my
athletes to question me, but in some cases
experience guides me—there is no time to discuss
everything. Those with experience and self
discipline must assert themselves."
The Hair Problem
Several years ago, Jordan was the center of a
feud involving sprinter Pat Morrison. The runner
would not cut his hair and the coach dismissed
him from the team. His reasoning in this case again
was a matter of discipline and order.
"As a team member, cutting your hair is a part
of self discipline and giving of yourself. It shows
you have the discipline to be successful in a big
iituation—the race itself.
"Also it means you give of yourself for the
good of everyone. You cut your hair for the team
image and morale."

In the field of education and students on
campuses, Jordan also demands order. He feels
demonstrations like those at Stanford last spring
only restrict academic freedom. "They (the
demonstrations) were ill-conceived and gained far
too much publicity. Only those 10 per cent that
interrupt classes get the headlines," he said. "The
90 per cent that have their heads screwed on right
and are interested in school spirit and go to the
football game never get mentioned."
Jordan felt the "silent majority of students" are
trying to get an education, and want to be directed
by educators. "They want your leadership and
your respect," he remarked.
"Young and immature people tend to be rash in
their decisions. They lack experience. This is
understandable. But if the rash acts become
anti-social, adults must step in. It is just like the
coach and his team—the individuals must adhere to
the rules of the group, and the coach is the boss of
those rules."
Administrators Cop Out
Jordan said he "supported the dilemma"
President Kenneth Pitzer was in during the sit-ins,
but was careful not to support Pitzer's response to
the disturbances. "All university staffs should get a
grip on themselves and run schools without stops
or intrusions by a loud 10 per cent. Administrators
must stop copping out."
Education is not the only field of Jordan's
concern. The coach called for improvements in the
tax structure, law enforcement, and pollution
control.
"Our society is the greatest one in the world,"
he said, "and it is worth saving. It is a simple world
which we are making too damn complicated.
"We are making many of the same mistakes
Rome did when their civilization fell. There is too
much socialism in America today. The give-away
programs are sapping the strength of the American
people."
Jordan called the current tax system too hard
and too direct, and resented the fact that the
people don't know where their tax money is going.
"There is too much federal control over everything
in our lives," he commented.
"In Rome, the slaves got all the money and the
workers became the slaves. The society collapsed. I
can see the same thing happening here with our
own federal government."
He declined to comment on the grape strike or
budget cuts in the state university system, claiming
