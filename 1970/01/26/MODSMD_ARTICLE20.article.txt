# A 						Senator's View
## Students On Trustee Committees 
### Douglas McHenry 
(The following is the second
part of an article on the Student
Senate's consideration of student
re presentation on trustee
committees, written by Douglas
McHenry, a freshman member of
the ASSU Senate.)
With regard to the major
alternatives which the Senate is
considering on the question of
students on trustee committees,
the first alternative is one
sponsored by the chairmen of the
senate, David Edwards. It was
published in its text by the Daily,
January 21, 1970. This proposal is
simply a deal which says to
President Pitzer if you promise
that the senate will have the final
power in deciding who is going to
sit on committees and who is not,
then the senate will do the
following. The senate will
officially endorse all the original

student nominations with the
exception of Yale Braunstein, and
furthermore will declare all those
who have broken the laws of the
university ineligible for such post
in the future.
There are many reactions to
this proposal-some favorable,some
unfavorable. But the most
universal is one of dislike. Many
senators feel that this proposal
seeks a political solution rather
than one that truly clears up the
issue. Another factor is that it in
no way fosters communication
with the President or the Board of
Trustees. It is much closer to a
labor negociating maneuver
between enemies or contestants,
rather than an agreement reached
between comrades.
Shea Proposal
The second major alternative
which has presented itself is

sponsored by a member of the
council of Presidents, Pat Shea. It
essentially condemns President
Pitzer in the first statement,
because he rejected Senator
Braunstein's nomination. And in
the second supports the
President's positions by accepting
all the nominations he confirmed
except Braunstein's, which he
rejected. Pat Shea's proposal,
although many senators feel it is a
crude compromise which
overlooks the issue completely,
nevertheless is gathering support.
One reason is that element
mentioned earlier of time. One
thing which Shea's proposal does
do which all senators agree upon,
it shoves the problem out of the
way. And the proposal also
insures one thing the senators
want very much, students on the
trustee committee's as soon as
possible.

The last alternative which has
been considered by many
senators, essentially involves
creating an opportunity to
consider the issue in more depth.
It calls for a meeting with the
Board of Trustees, President
Pitzer, and the Associated
Students to discuss and formulate
together the answer to the
question.
Direct Communication
Many senators feel this is just
too important an issue to shove
through or politically choke to
death. It would offer a chance for
the senate to communicate
directly with the Board and the
President, rather than through
impersonal means which often
lead to more misinterpretation.
Some of the more radical
members of the senate have
pointed out that such a proposal

would be merely voted down by
the Board or Pitzer or they would
appoint some representative,
rather than communicate openly
with the senate. Other senators
feel that such a measure would
only prolong the process of
selecting students for the
committee post.
Senate Decision
The Stanford community will
know soon which one of these
alternatives the senate has chosen.
In a sense, one could say they are
choosing between only two
alternatives. The first two are
seeking solutions which appear to
be more political in nature. The
latter, to the mind of many
senators, is a more ODen approach,
simply to talk. If the senate
chooses from among the outlined
alternatives, it should be
interesting to see whether or not
it will give the board of trustees a
chance.
