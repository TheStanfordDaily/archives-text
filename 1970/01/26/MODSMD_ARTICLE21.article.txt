# ROTC Punitive Clauses
## 'Vestige Of A Bygone Era' A 						Letter From Provost Lyman 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I wish to make a personal
statement concerning the so-called
"punitive clauses" in the
individual contracts signed by
students in ROTC. These
have —rightly in my view—been an
important issue in the debates
over the continuance of ROTC at
Stanford. There is widespread
mistrust of the authority which
these clauses vest In the armed
services to induct an ROTC cadet
immediately for from two to four

years' service as an enlisted man in
the event of the cadet's refusal to
complete the later stages of his
training and accept a commission.
With considerable justice it is
argued that a young man finishing
high school may sign a contract
the full significance of which he is
not in a good position to judge,
and that he may come to regret
this at a later date, only to
discover that his choice is
completion of the contract or
immediate induction. It is further

argued that protection for cadets
who become outspoken critics of
ROTC is at best uncertain under
these present circumstances.
In the Academic Senate on
January 22nd, a number of
members (including many who
voted for acceptance of the Army
proposal) expressed misgivings,
and a strong desire to see the
question of eliminating the
punitive clauses pressed in
Washington. Some wished the
Senate to say immediatelv that

ROTC would be ended at
Stanford within a short period if
the clauses were not simply
eliminated. The resolution as
passed stopped short of
attempting to bind future Senates
in that fashion, but called for
continued effort on the part of
the University to resolve this
issue, and for a full review of the
working of Army ROTC,
including the punitive clauses, in
one year's time. It would be a
serious mistake for anyone to

imagine that this portion of the
Senate's action last Thursday is a
pious platitude and can be
forgotten in due course.
I wish to stress my personal
commitment to the effort called
for by the Senate, and my
conviction that there are other
ways in which the armed services
could avoid whatever risk there
may be of their being defrauded
by extending a four-year
scholarship to a student who has
no serious intention of completing
his side of the contract.
Conversion of ROTC scholarships
to loans, repayment of which
would be forgiven upon
completion of training and service
as a commissioned officer, is one
obvious possibility. As things
stand now, an ROTC scholarship
is the only form of financial aid in
which the student recipient is
penalized for changing his mind.
I further believe that
substantial and demonstrable
progress towards resolving this
problem is essential to the
continuation of ROTC at
Stanford past next year. The
punitive clauses are a vestige of a
bygone era, and they serve neither
the nation's nor the University's
welfare.

I wish to make a personal
statement concerning the so-called
"punitive clauses" in the
individual contracts signed by
students in ROTC. These
have —rightly in my view—been an
important issue in the debates
over the continuance of ROTC at
Stanford. There is widespread
mistrust of the authority which
these clauses vest In the armed
services to induct an ROTC cadet
immediately for from two to four

years' service as an enlisted man in
the event of the cadet's refusal to
complete the later stages of his
training and accept a commission.
With considerable justice it is
argued that a young man finishing
high school may sign a contract
the full significance of which he is
not in a good position to judge,
and that he may come to regret
this at a later date, only to
discover that his choice is
completion of the contract or
immediate induction. It is further

argued that protection for cadets
who become outspoken critics of
ROTC is at best uncertain under
these present circumstances.
In the Academic Senate on
January 22nd, a number of
members (including many who
voted for acceptance of the Army
proposal) expressed misgivings,
and a strong desire to see the
question of eliminating the
punitive clauses pressed in
Washington. Some wished the
Senate to say immediatelv that

ROTC would be ended at
Stanford within a short period if
the clauses were not simply
eliminated. The resolution as
passed stopped short of
attempting to bind future Senates
in that fashion, but called for
continued effort on the part of
the University to resolve this
issue, and for a full review of the
working of Army ROTC,
including the punitive clauses, in
one year's time. It would be a
serious mistake for anyone to

imagine that this portion of the
Senate's action last Thursday is a
pious platitude and can be
forgotten in due course.
I wish to stress my personal
commitment to the effort called
for by the Senate, and my
conviction that there are other
ways in which the armed services
could avoid whatever risk there
may be of their being defrauded
by extending a four-year
scholarship to a student who has
no serious intention of completing
his side of the contract.
Conversion of ROTC scholarships
to loans, repayment of which
would be forgiven upon
completion of training and service
as a commissioned officer, is one
obvious possibility. As things
stand now, an ROTC scholarship
is the only form of financial aid in
which the student recipient is
penalized for changing his mind.
I further believe that
substantial and demonstrable
progress towards resolving this
problem is essential to the
continuation of ROTC at
Stanford past next year. The
punitive clauses are a vestige of a
bygone era, and they serve neither
the nation's nor the University's
welfare.
