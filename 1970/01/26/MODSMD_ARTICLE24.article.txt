# 'Daily Has New Editor
## 
### 
Margie Wolf, a junior
majoring in Political Science
and Communications, has been
elected editor of the Daily for
Volume 157. The new volume
begins a week from today.
In elections held in the
paper's offices Friday, Miss
Wolf defeated James Perloff,
another junior, for the post.
A resident of Kirkwood,
Mo., Miss Wolf is the first
female to be elected since
1965. She plans no major
reorganization of the paper.

Miss Wolf said that she would
hold discussions with the staff
throughout the week and that
she would appoint a Managing
Editor before the start of the
new volume.
Miss Wolf said that the
paper will continue to be run
through the committee system,
which was started during the
present volume. Policy decision
will be made in staff meetings
or open meetings of a
managing board where all staff
members will be allowed to
vote.
