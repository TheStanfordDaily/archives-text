# Stanford Needs Gift Increase
## 
### PHYLLIS PETERSEN 
Should the University conduct
a major fund-raising campaign
and, if so, what type should it be?
Procedures to determine the
answers to these questions were
set in motion by the Board of
Trustees at their January meeting
last week.
An indication that an increase
in gift income would be necessary
was' given by President Pitzer
January 9 in a speech to the
Academic Council. Theis followed
statements from various sources in
the Administration last fall that
the University was in for some
belt-tightening.
The Board directed its
President, W. Palmer Fuller 111, to
appoint an ad hoc committee to
work with the Stanford Cabinet
"to develop a strategy for
dramatically increasing Stanford's
gift receipts during the next five
years."
The Stanford Cabinet is
composed of five trustees, a
non-alumnus parent, and top
officers of both the Alumni
Association and of the Stanford
Associates, an experienced
volunteer fund-raising
organization which has been
active on Stanford's behalf since

the mid-1930'5. A professional
fund-raising consultant will be
retained.
The ad hoc committee and the
Cabinet were requested to
maintain liaison with a Universtiy
committee of faculty, students,
and staff to be appointed by
President Pitzer to consider gift
procurement procedures.
In reference to the committee
to be appointed by President
Pitzer, the Board statement said it
''clearly recognized that the Board
itself must provide the strong
leadership necessary, but also
concluded that success will not be
possible unless all constituencies
of the University join together in
a truly cooperative effort."
Committee Suggestions
It was suggested that the
committee and the Cabinet make
recommendations on the
following at an "early date":
1 . Whet her or not a
high-intensity university-wide
campaign, a series of smaller
campaigns built around particular
projects or schools, or an
intensification of efforts over a
ten-year period is most likely to
meet the necessary objectives.
2. If the recommendations
should be that a high-intensity

campaign should be undertaken,
what would be a) the optimum
timing of such an effort in view of
the anticipated state of the
economy and prospect and
volunteer attitudes, b) the length
of such an effort, c) the dollar
garget of such a campaign, d) its
organization e) its theme and
name."
The decisions came following a
report and discussion on a
long-range financial forecast. The
Board said it recognizes that
"only by a massive increase in
private gift support" can the
University continue its
"dedication to the goal of front
rank excellence among the
universities of the world."
This kind of effort was
recognized as especially valuable
since the University itself can
initiate it.
