# ROTC Decision Questioned, Petition Asks Faculty Review
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Petitions will be circulated
today in an attempt to bring
Thursday's Senate ROTC decision
under review by the entire
faculty.
Harold Kahn, associate
professor of history, indicated
yesterday that several faculty
members, "angry, distraught, and
disturbed by the Senate's
decision," would circulate a
petition asking the entire
' Academic Council to reconsider
the decision allowing limited
credit for Army ROTC courses.
If the petition receives 50
signatures of members of the
Academic Council—faculty
members of assistant professor
rank or highei —a special meeting
of the Council will be called
within four weeks of the time the
petition is submitted to the
secretary of the Academic
Council. The Council could then
change, modify, or uphold the
Senate decision.
In a related development, Prof.
Alan S. Manne, economics and
operations research, resigned as
chairman of the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC
Affairs. In a letter to President
Pitzer Prof. Manne said, "In view
of yesterday's regrettable Senate
action, it is anappropriate for me
to remain on this committee."
Although chairman of the
committee which recommended
adoption of the Army proposal,
Prof. Manne dissented along with
Prof. Lyman Van Slyke, history,
and strongly disagreed with the

recommendations in the Senate
debate Thursday.
Prof. Manne is out of town and
could not be reached for
comment. Vice-president and
Provost Richard Lyman termed
his resignation "unfortunate" and
said he feared it would be
misinterpreted. Lyman said that
although Prof. Manne did not
agree with the committee's report
or the Senate action, he should
not feel that he is being identified
with either.
Last Thursday, the faculty
Senate voted to allow Army
ROTC to submit its courses to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) for credit approval.
The move is on a one-year basis.
The CUS regularly reviews courses that
are not normally taught within a
Department. It can grant credit to
courses it feels worthy.
The Senate approved with
minor changes an Army proposal
for revised contracts between
itself and Stanford in light of the
Senate's decision last February to
deny ROTC credit after a gradual
phase-out. The proposal adopted
Thursday also replaces the
Department of Military Studies
with a Center for Military Studies
and takes away the faculty status
of Army instructors. The
instructors will have the normal
privileges of faculty members
without tenure, except
membership on the Academic
Council.

Disagreement over the
interpretation of the Senate's
action arose over the weekend.
Prof. William Clebsch, religion and
humanities and chairman of the
faculty Senate, said "ROTC was
placed by the Senate in a more
precarious situation with respect
to short range considerations than
was the case last February. But
the long range possibility of
irregular course credit for ROTC
was extended. . . .The periodic
phase-out of credit was canceled."
The decision of the Senate last
February declared, "After a
transitional period, there should
be no academic credit received for
participation in programs of
military training and education.
Students already enrolled in
ROTC programs, and those
enrolling prior to the fall term
1 970, shall continue as
present . . .Beginning with the fall
term 1970, no entering freshman
shall be granted academic credit
for ROTC activities." Also, the
rank of instructors was to be
gradually changed.
However, Prof. Clebsch said,
"Last Thursday the Senate placed
the Army contract on an entirely
new basis with respect to credit
and departmental-faculty basis."
In other words, for the trial
period beginning September,
1970, the Senate removed the
ROTC departmental status and
faculty status of the instructors. It
also removed blanket credit for all
classes—including those of
students already enrolled in the
program.

Next September, all Army
ROTC courses will have to be
submitted for review before the
CUS in order to be given
credit—freshmen through senior
years. This changes the gradual
phase-out of credit that had been
planned. The CUS could den>
credit to courses of upperclassmen
t hat would have been granted credit
under the old Senate plan.
Furthermore, at the end of the
trial period, the Senate could vote
to deny all credit to ROTC
classes, two years before the
phase-out had been planned to
end. Prof. Clebsch said, "There is
disagreement as to whether the
Senate's recent action might result
in a termination of all credit for
ROTC in 1971 if the trial year
were not renewed."
Colonel Stanley Ramey,
commanding officer of Army
ROTC, disagreed with Clebsch's
interpretation. He feels that the
Senate decided that "for incoming
classes, anything (Army ROTC
has) will come before the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. Those that are already
enrolled will get credit for
courses."
Law Professor Thomas Ehrlich
and author of the resolution the
Senate approved, agreed with
Clebsch's interpretation. He said
the decision called for a
"completely new contract
(between Stanford and the Army)
under which each course would be
submitted to the CUS" for
approval.

petition asking the entire
' Academic Council to reconsider
the decision allowing limited
credit for Army ROTC courses.
If the petition receives 50
signatures of members of the
Academic Council—faculty
members of assistant professor
rank or highei —a special meeting
of the Council will be called
within four weeks of the time the
petition is submitted to the
secretary of the Academic
Council. The Council could then
change, modify, or uphold the
Senate decision.
In a related development, Prof.
Alan S. Manne, economics and
operations research, resigned as
chairman of the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC
Affairs. In a letter to President
Pitzer Prof. Manne said, "In view
of yesterday's regrettable Senate
action, it is anappropriate for me
to remain on this committee."
Although chairman of the
committee which recommended
adoption of the Army proposal,
Prof. Manne dissented along with
Prof. Lyman Van Slyke, history,
and strongly disagreed with the

recommendations in the Senate
debate Thursday.
Prof. Manne is out of town and
could not be reached for
comment. Vice-president and
Provost Richard Lyman termed
his resignation "unfortunate" and
said he feared it would be
misinterpreted. Lyman said that
although Prof. Manne did not
agree with the committee's report
or the Senate action, he should
not feel that he is being identified
with either.
Last Thursday, the faculty
Senate voted to allow Army
ROTC to submit its courses to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) for credit approval.
The move is on a one-year basis.
The CUS regularly reviews courses that
are not normally taught within a
Department. It can grant credit to
courses it feels worthy.
The Senate approved with
minor changes an Army proposal
for revised contracts between
itself and Stanford in light of the
Senate's decision last February to
deny ROTC credit after a gradual
phase-out. The proposal adopted
Thursday also replaces the
Department of Military Studies
with a Center for Military Studies
and takes away the faculty status
of Army instructors. The
instructors will have the normal
privileges of faculty members
without tenure, except
membership on the Academic
Council.

Disagreement over the
interpretation of the Senate's
action arose over the weekend.
Prof. William Clebsch, religion and
humanities and chairman of the
faculty Senate, said "ROTC was
placed by the Senate in a more
precarious situation with respect
to short range considerations than
was the case last February. But
the long range possibility of
irregular course credit for ROTC
was extended. . . .The periodic
phase-out of credit was canceled."
The decision of the Senate last
February declared, "After a
transitional period, there should
be no academic credit received for
participation in programs of
military training and education.
Students already enrolled in
ROTC programs, and those
enrolling prior to the fall term
1 970, shall continue as
present . . .Beginning with the fall
term 1970, no entering freshman
shall be granted academic credit
for ROTC activities." Also, the
rank of instructors was to be
gradually changed.
However, Prof. Clebsch said,
"Last Thursday the Senate placed
the Army contract on an entirely
new basis with respect to credit
and departmental-faculty basis."
In other words, for the trial
period beginning September,
1970, the Senate removed the
ROTC departmental status and
faculty status of the instructors. It
also removed blanket credit for all
classes—including those of
students already enrolled in the
program.

Next September, all Army
ROTC courses will have to be
submitted for review before the
CUS in order to be given
credit—freshmen through senior
years. This changes the gradual
phase-out of credit that had been
planned. The CUS could den>
credit to courses of upperclassmen
t hat would have been granted credit
under the old Senate plan.
Furthermore, at the end of the
trial period, the Senate could vote
to deny all credit to ROTC
classes, two years before the
phase-out had been planned to
end. Prof. Clebsch said, "There is
disagreement as to whether the
Senate's recent action might result
in a termination of all credit for
ROTC in 1971 if the trial year
were not renewed."
Colonel Stanley Ramey,
commanding officer of Army
ROTC, disagreed with Clebsch's
interpretation. He feels that the
Senate decided that "for incoming
classes, anything (Army ROTC
has) will come before the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. Those that are already
enrolled will get credit for
courses."
Law Professor Thomas Ehrlich
and author of the resolution the
Senate approved, agreed with
Clebsch's interpretation. He said
the decision called for a
"completely new contract
(between Stanford and the Army)
under which each course would be
submitted to the CUS" for
approval.
Petitions will be circulated
today in an attempt to bring
Thursday's Senate ROTC decision
under review by the entire
faculty.

professor of history, indicated

secretary of the Academic
Council. The Council could then
change, modify, or uphold the
Senate decision.
In a related development, Prof.
Alan S. Manne, economics and
operations research, resigned as
chairman of the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC
Affairs. In a letter to President
Pitzer Prof. Manne said, "In view
of yesterday's regrettable Senate
action, it is anappropriate for me
to remain on this committee."
Although chairman of the
committee which recommended
adoption of the Army proposal,
Prof. Manne dissented along with
Prof. Lyman Van Slyke, history,
and strongly disagreed with the

recommendations in the Senate
debate Thursday.
Prof. Manne is out of town and
could not be reached for
comment. Vice-president and
Provost Richard Lyman termed
his resignation "unfortunate" and
said he feared it would be
misinterpreted. Lyman said that
although Prof. Manne did not
agree with the committee's report
or the Senate action, he should
not feel that he is being identified
with either.
Last Thursday, the faculty
Senate voted to allow Army
ROTC to submit its courses to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) for credit approval.
The move is on a one-year basis.
The CUS regularly reviews courses that
are not normally taught within a
Department. It can grant credit to
courses it feels worthy.
The Senate approved with
minor changes an Army proposal
for revised contracts between
itself and Stanford in light of the
Senate's decision last February to
deny ROTC credit after a gradual
phase-out. The proposal adopted
Thursday also replaces the
Department of Military Studies
with a Center for Military Studies
and takes away the faculty status
of Army instructors. The
instructors will have the normal
privileges of faculty members
without tenure, except
membership on the Academic
Council.

Disagreement over the
interpretation of the Senate's
action arose over the weekend.
Prof. William Clebsch, religion and
humanities and chairman of the
faculty Senate, said "ROTC was
placed by the Senate in a more
precarious situation with respect
to short range considerations than
was the case last February. But
the long range possibility of
irregular course credit for ROTC
was extended. . . .The periodic
phase-out of credit was canceled."
The decision of the Senate last
February declared, "After a
transitional period, there should
be no academic credit received for
participation in programs of
military training and education.
Students already enrolled in
ROTC programs, and those
enrolling prior to the fall term
1 970, shall continue as
present . . .Beginning with the fall
term 1970, no entering freshman
shall be granted academic credit
for ROTC activities." Also, the
rank of instructors was to be
gradually changed.
However, Prof. Clebsch said,
"Last Thursday the Senate placed
the Army contract on an entirely
new basis with respect to credit
and departmental-faculty basis."
In other words, for the trial
period beginning September,
1970, the Senate removed the
ROTC departmental status and
faculty status of the instructors. It
also removed blanket credit for all
classes—including those of
students already enrolled in the
program.

Next September, all Army
ROTC courses will have to be
submitted for review before the
CUS in order to be given
credit—freshmen through senior
years. This changes the gradual
phase-out of credit that had been
planned. The CUS could den>
credit to courses of upperclassmen
t hat would have been granted credit
under the old Senate plan.
Furthermore, at the end of the
trial period, the Senate could vote
to deny all credit to ROTC
classes, two years before the
phase-out had been planned to
end. Prof. Clebsch said, "There is
disagreement as to whether the
Senate's recent action might result
in a termination of all credit for
ROTC in 1971 if the trial year
were not renewed."
Colonel Stanley Ramey,
commanding officer of Army
ROTC, disagreed with Clebsch's
interpretation. He feels that the
Senate decided that "for incoming
classes, anything (Army ROTC
has) will come before the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. Those that are already
enrolled will get credit for
courses."
Law Professor Thomas Ehrlich
and author of the resolution the
Senate approved, agreed with
Clebsch's interpretation. He said
the decision called for a
"completely new contract
(between Stanford and the Army)
under which each course would be
submitted to the CUS" for
approval.
Petitions will be circulated
today in an attempt to bring
Thursday's Senate ROTC decision
under review by the entire
faculty.
Harold Kahn, associate
professor of history, indicated
yesterday that several faculty
members, "angry, distraught, and
disturbed by the Senate's
decision," would circulate a
petition asking the entire
' Academic Council to reconsider
the decision allowing limited
credit for Army ROTC courses.
If the petition receives 50
signatures of members of the
Academic Council—faculty
members of assistant professor
rank or highei —a special meeting
of the Council will be called
within four weeks of the time the
petition is submitted to the
secretary of the Academic
Council. The Council could then
change, modify, or uphold the
Senate decision.
