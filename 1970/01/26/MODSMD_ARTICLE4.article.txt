# Few Decisions-Dwindling Numbers Blamed
## Anti-ROTC Group Adopts Press Ban 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
In its second meeting, held
Friday afternoon, a radical
coalition calling itself the new
Stanford Moratorium adopted
several broad proposals for its
campaign to remove ROTC from
the Stanford campus.
However, the new Moratorium
was able to decide on only one
action proposal; it will sponsor a
campus-wide petition calling for
the immediate removal of ROTC.
The group also moved to bar
photographers and radio station
crews from all future meetings, a
decision drawing angry retorts
from campus news media.
The Moratorium will meet
again Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in
Branner's dining hall.
Tactics were discussed at
length during Friday's two-hour
session. After a short speech by
English Professor Bruce Franklin,
the group voted to bar any
photographs or tape recordings of
any meetings. Daily photographer

Jim Stimmel offered to surrender
the roll of film he had started to
use, and the group accepted his
offer. KZSU's recording lines were
also disconnected
Franklin argued that if any of
the decisions' at the meetings
resulted in actions that were even
"mildly illegal," pictures and tape
recordings could be used to
convict those who attended the
meeting on conspiracy charges.
Position Adopted
The group was initially about
150 strong but dwindled to about
75 supporters before adjourning.
It incorporated into its official
policy a statement written by Jim
Shoch charging that objections to
the "academic" nature of ROTC
are only "peripheral to the central
issue - ROTC is an oppressive
instition designed to facilitate the
U.S. war effort against the peoples
of Southeast Asia."
The statement condemns
ROTC for producing officers "of
upper and middle class origins"

who will order" thousands of
young working class Americans to
their deaths" and who will "order
the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of Vietnamese,
Laottians, Thais, and other
Southeast Asian peoples."
The main point in the Shoch
paper is that Stanford workers are
having to shoulder an unfair
portion of the economic burden
caused by the war. Shoch reasons
that Stanford's fiscal crisis is
largely a result of cut-backs in
federal aid to education to finance
the war. And, "in order to make
more funds available to finance
further expansion, the University
is increasing the exploitation of its
workers."
Decision Blasted
Daily editor Mark Weinberger
reacted angrily to Friday's
incident involving the partial
media ban. "I and the rest of the
staff greatly resent attempts to
deny us full access to public
meetings on campus. No matter
our personal politics, we assert
our right as journalists to freely

report and photograph events of
interest to the community.
"Unfortunately, it will be the
policy of this paper to deny news
coverage to any organization that
hampers efforts by Daily staff
members to attend and report
their proceedings," he added.
In an editorial aired Saturday
night, KZSU blasted the leaders of
the new group for their severing
the transmission lines. It said, in
part:
"The barring of KZSU's tape
crew by a professor of English and
a former LASSU speaker is
regrettable. . .We challenge the
leadership of the new Stanford
Moratorium to answer our
questions: are their future
meetings to be open as they are
billed, or are they to be ciosed to
all but those who will nod their
heads in agreement to a yell from
the balcony that effectively cuts
freedom of the press?
.We challenge the
leadership of the new Stanford

not enough knowledge of the situations at this
time.
Praise For Reagan
Jordan praised Governor Ronald Reagan as "a
fine administrator, sincerely interested in the
welfare of the state." He called the current
administration "the best California has had in my
lifetime."
Another important part of Jordan's philosophy
concerns duty. Both the athlete and the private
citizen must "pay the price" and commit
themselves to improving their team and their
society.
"Once a man is elected, it is the duty of good
citizen to follow that leader." He further
emphasized the duty of following the law. "It's
legal to eat grapes, so I want the freedom of choice
to eat them or not. But if I smoke pot, I'm
breaking the law and I deserve the punishment."
Jordan has made more than 50 speeches around
the state, often receiving standing ovations. His
talents as an orator and firm conservative
convictions make him a prime candidate for the
Reagan backers. Just as success on the field is a
coach leading his team to victory, success for
Jordan in politics would be a more rational society
with him helping in the crusade.
"I believe in this republic and this flag, and this
country." The eyes flashed and the words
rebounded off the walls of the small,
trophy-covered office.
"You may not agree with my ideas, but I'll tell
them to you anyway. At least people can say of
me, 'He's his own man'."

Moratorium to either open up
their meetings to all who have a
stake in them or to refrain from
calling them community
meetings for decision making
through participatory
democracy. In light of (Friday's)
actions to our reporters, that
phrase rings disgracefully false."
Overall Strategy
The overall strategy of the
anti-ROTC group is embodied in
the following demands, which are
a part of Shoch's position paper:
"Stanford University must
publicly denounce the War and
the inflation it has caused and
must stop making its workers pay
for the University's attempt to
accomodate itself to the
overheated war economy."
The University, the paper
continues, must "disengage itself
from any participation in the war
against the peoples of Southeast
Asia. ROTC must be immediately
eliminated. All war research must
be discontinued. On-campus
recruiting for defense companies
must end. No more war
contracters can be permitted to
build on Stanford land."
Many proposals to implement
Shoch's demands were offered,
but dwindling attendance forced
an adjournment of the meeting
before action could be taken on
most. Those present decided to
circulate a petition, starting
today, to "demand an end to
ROTC military training of any
kind that uses the land, buildings,
academic credit or sponsorship of
Stanford University."
Franklin's Proposal
A proposal by Franklin tc
resurrect the old Moratorium
strategy of an escalating series of
protests each month (four days in
January, five days in February, six
days in March), as well as a
proposal to "audit and disrupt"
all ROTC classes were left for
consideration at future meetings.
Later in the meeting, Franklin
told those present that their
eventual goal would be "action to
shut down the University in order
to effect its will." But, he
cautioned, "We've come to realize
that certain kinds of activities in
regards to buildings should not be
engaged in any way that anybody
could get caught."
Many present at the meeting
expressed concern over using
violent tactics at the present time.
"Too few of us are prepared,"
said one veteran of the April
Third Movement. "Half of us still
have to go to court for last year."
The following is the text of the
petition being circulated by
members of the new Stanford
Moratorium starting today:
"We believe that the Vietnam War
and U.S. domination of workers and
nations throughout the world will not
end until the people of the United
States stop all Instruments of
exploitation from functioning.
"Military training at colleges is one
of those Instruments; It provides more
than half of the new officers for the
U.S. Army each year.
"We are members of the Stanford
community - students, workers and
faculty. Wo demand an end to ROTC
rrllltary training of any kind that uses
the land, buildings, academic credit or
sponsorship of Stanford University."
