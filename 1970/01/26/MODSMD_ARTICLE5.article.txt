# Double Victory
## Mermen Romp Again 
### DOUG WILSON 
By now, Stanford swimming
fans must be anxiously awaiting
the Yale meet. Because so far,
things have been rather dull
around Encina pool.
Stanford swimmers just keep
on killing every opponent in sight.
The lastest victims were
highly-touted Washington, which
lost to the Indians 84-29 last
Friday, and Santa Clara Swim
Club, the strongest AAU squbd in
the nation, which Stanford
defeated 88-25 the next day.
Washington might just as well
have been Washington State
(which lost to Stanford the week
before, 86-27) as far as the meet
results are concerned, but the
crowd of 450 spectators was
treated to somewhat more than
rainy weather. Like the 200-yd.
breaststroke race between Brain
Job, Dave Shilling, and
Washington's Rick Colella. Job's
first place finish gave him the
nation's best time in the event,
2:08.7—a150 new freshman,
varsity, and pool records. Shilling,
last year's NCAA runner-up,
torned in a 2:10.7 time, now the
country's second fastest, and
Colella posted what is now the
third-best time, 2:11.0.
Distance Dominance
Colella, Jeff Schufrieder, and
Ken Reisch posted Washington's
only wins of the day.
Approximately equalling his
fourth-ranked national time in the
1000-yd. freestyle, Colella beat
Stanford's Mark Shelley in the
distance event with a 10:04.3. In
one of the afternoon's more
exciting finishes, Bert Mason
edged the Huskies' Scott Pye to
take third place, and break
Washington's dominance of the
distance freestyle.
Mason's fine performance was
undoubtedly a psychological lift
for the Stanford squad, which had
been anticipating a difficult
afternoon in the middle- and
long-distance freestyle events

from highly-touted Washington
tankers.
Instead, Stanford ended up
sweeping the 200 free and taking
second and third in the 500.
Freshman Tim Broderick turned
in a new-fresh man-record time of
1:45.4 in the 200, followed by
Brent Bertk and Washington's
Shufreider. The Husky swimmer
won the 500 free on the judges'
decision, as he and Broderick
swam identical times of 4:48.0.
Washington butterflier Ken
Reisch posted a 1:58.8 in the
200-yd butterfly, leading a
Washington sweep of the event.
John Ferris spent the
afternoon swimming the butterfly
leg of Stanford's winning 400-yd.
medley relay, (which also
included Fred Haywood, Brian
Job, and Bob Jamison and
winning the 200-yd. individual
medley in a new national-best
time of 1:57.4, beating
second-place teammate Dave
Shilling by a little over two
seconds.
Stanford's sweep of the sprint
events included a 1-2-3 finish by
Steve Carey (:21.9), Bob Bebb
(:22.3), and Rick Eagleston
(:22.6) in the 50-yd. freestyle,
and similar finish by Carey,
Jamison and Bob Warren in the
100, with a judges' decision and
one-tenth of a second separating
Carey (:48.0) from Jamison.
Stanford's most pleasing
victory must have been the
400-yd. freestyle relay team of
John Glaser, Bill Huck, freshman
Bob Wilson, and Ray Collins,
which defeated the "loaded"

Washington quartet of Reisch,
Shufreider, Greg Galles, and Jerry
Corman. The Tribe relay churned
to a win in 3:21.3.
Completing the rash of wins
were Fred Haywood's 1:58.0
performance in the 200-yd.
backstroke (which ranks him
second in the nation behind
Indiana's Gary Hall), and the
continuation of outstanding
performances by divers Bill Main
and Ted Nichols, Main winning
the 1-meter diving with 283.2
points.
Then, Coach Jim Gaughran and
Assistant Coach Jimmy Snrth had
the satisfaction of watching their
proteges beat Santa Clara, 88-25,
Saturday afternoon. Stanford won
all but one event, with
performances which included:
—A new national-best time for
Ferris in his Stanford butter-fly
debut—l.s4.3.
—A 2:08.5 time by Job,
bettering his previous day's
record-breaking breaststroke time
by two-tenths of a second.
— A crowd-pleasing,
come-from-behind finish by
Broderick to edge Santa Clara's
Mitchell in the 200-free, giving the
Stanford freshman an unofficial
6th-place national ranking (behind
Berk) in the event, and
—A winning performance by
Stanford's ad hoc JV team in the
400-free relay to defeat Foothill
Acquatic Club, 62-50.
George Haines, Santa Clara's
nationally recognized coach, said
later that he looks for Stanford to
defeat both Yale and USC in what
should be two of the best dual
meets in the nation. "Stanford
will have the advantage of being in
the home pool," the Olympic
mentor commented, "and if
Stanford can get a real downpour
here, Yale certainly won't be used
to that!"
Next week Stanford travels to
Berkeley for what might be called
"big meet." Big deal —they're
waiting for Yale.
