## The 						Yale Case-III 
### John Arthur 
The National Collegiate Athletic Association
has not always been the villain of amateur athletics
in the U.S. In fact, a decade ago, when the NCAA
began to move in and challenge the venerable
Amateur Athletic Union for partial control of
the amateur scene, the NCAA was hailed by
athletes and coaches alike as the knight in shining
armour who would rectify all the inequities and
bumbling practices perpetuated by the AAU.
This was the situation late in 1961: A group of
track coaches and athletes, long-suffering subjects
of AAU misrule, began to talk of forming their
own organization to run meets and sponsor
international competition. Their list of grievances
against the AAU, and its aging paid secretary Dan
Ferris, was long. It included complaints about the
meager expense accounts given travelling American
athletes, ridiculous scheduling of events and
transportation to them, unjust selections of
coaches for foreign trips and generally, third-rate
management of amateur athletics.
During the summer the editor of a track
magazine hostile to the AAU polled track and field
competitors across the country and came up with
an impressive list of athletes who favored a new
track federation. On the list were such well-known
personalities as distance runners Jim Beatty and
Dyrol Burleson, decathalon champion Rafer
Johnson, shotputters Dallas Long and Parry
O'Brien and hammer thrower Hal Connolly. As
vocal dissatisfaction with the AAU grew, the
NCAA made it known that it would stand behind
the formation of any new track group, and it was
learned that the NCAA's articles of alliance with
the AAU had long since been cancelled.
Revolution
The revolt against the AAU gained impetus
during a meeting of the National Collegiate Track
Coaches in New York in September, 1961. Despite
the plaintive claims of secretary Ferris that the
AAU was the only body able to represent the U.S.
abroad, the track coaches voted to pull out of the
AAU and form the U.S. Track and Field
Federation. The AAU's dominance in American
amateur athletics was over and the feud was on in
earnest.
Subsequent years were marked by a whole
series of clashes between the two groups, repeated
efforts to mediate their dispute, and an increasing
bitterness among the organizations' hierarchies.

Ferris was replaced by younger leadership, but the
differences with the NCAA, led by executive
director Walter Byers, remained. Each group
wanted monopoly control of the athletes and
neither was able to gain it.
By the end of 1962 a tenuous agreement
between the two groups had been announced, but
in January, 1963, it collapsed. The failure was due
to the AAU refusal to go along with a section of
the agreement specifying that after the 1964
Olympics a NCAA-AAU coalition, and not the
AAU alone, would have the right to apply for
representation in the International Amateur
Athletic Federation, the governing body for world
track and field. The AAU was agreeable to a truce
which would permit the U.S. to field an Olympic
team, but couldn't swallow the bitter pill of
relinquishing amateur dominance for American
athletes abroad.
Peace Efforts Fail
As the years went by a succession of prestigious
negotiators, including Attorney General Robert F.
Kennedy, Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur and Theodore
Kheel worked to bring about a peace as public
indignation about the dispute rose to new heights.
Eventually an accord was worked out for the
Olympics. By these rules, which were used in 1964
and 1968, three major groups hold eliminations to
provide athletes for the Olympic tryouts. They are
the National Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics, the NCAA and the AAU. In addition,
the armed forces can supply competitors. The
NCAA and the AAU generally provide six
candidates for each event, the NAIA two, and the
military one, all of whom end up in the Olympic
trials.
Unfortunately for American athletes, events
other than the Olympics usually fail to generate
sufficient enthusiasm to get all these governing
bodies together. What results is conflict and a
series of inane rules. One such rule is the NCAA
provision prohibiting its basketball players
from participation in the Maccabiah Games, held
every four years in Israel. When a NCAA member
violates this rule, and sends one of its players to
the games anyway, like Yale has just done, the
association is quick to lower its boom.
Next: A series of cases which have been
mishandled by the NCAA and how Yale can
appeal its two-year probation.
