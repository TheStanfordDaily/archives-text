# Tribe Clobbers AF, Loses To Cowboys
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Chuck Moore and Dennis
O'Neill couldn't quite beat
Wyoming Friday night. Saturday
everybody helped out and the
Indians blasted Air Force to
salvage a weekend non-conference
basketball split at Maples.
While leading the Falcons from
tip to buzzer, Stanford cranked
up a rapid-fire fast break, shot a
blistering 64 percent from the
field and had all five starters, led
by Claude Terry and 26 points, in
double figures. The Indians won
easily, 90-69.
The night before was a
different story.
O'Neill scored almost half of
Stanford's points (35 of 74) and
Moore wrestled down almost half
of Stanford's rebounds (20 of 44)
while also tossing in 16, but
Wyoming, aided by Indian fouls,
overcame a first half deficit of 10
and then held on for the win,
84-74.
Terry and Bill Palmer, held to
eight and two points by the 18th
ranked Cowboys, came back for
26 and 17 respectively against Air
Force and were helped by Moore
with 15, O'Neill with 13 and Fred
Green with 11.
Stanford is now 4-10 for the
season and 3-4 on its home court.
Against the Falcons the Tribe
leaped to an 8-1 lead, upped it to
25-7 as Air Force went over three
minutes without a bucket, and
never led by less than 13 in the
second half.
Bert Spear, a 5-10 guard led
Falcon scorers with 18. mostly on

long jump shots over Stanford's
zone defense.
It was the same zone that
nearly scuttled Wyoming the night
before. After five minutes and a
9-9 score, Stanford dropped its
man-for-man defense of the
Cowboys and took a 31-21
lead. Only the long shooting of
flat-topped forward Stan Dodds
who perched in the corner and
fired over the defense kept
Wyoming in the game. He finished
with 36 points.
Palmer and Green got into first
half foul trouble, and the
Cowboys narrowed the Stanford
lead to 41-37 at the half; they
pressed ahead with 15 minutes
left and then held off two Indian
charges—at 59-57 and 74-70—to
protect their victory.
With Moore in front and
Palmer behind, Stanford stymied
Cowboy Carl Ashley, who came in
with a 20.7 average, for much of
the game. He finished with 16,
most coming while Palmer was on
the bench. But Dodds was
something else.
The Stanford frosh easily won
both their games, blitzing the
Moffet Field Flyers 98-85, and
downing the UC-Davis freshmen,
86-56.
Pat Rusco led Stanford against
Moffet with 25 points, followed
by Pat Stevens with 19, and John
Stratton, 15. Stevens grabbed 18
rebounds and Rusco 11. Against
UCD, Stevens paced Tribe scoring
with 13, Rusco added 11 and
Mark Hanson contributed ten.

Indian Coach Howie Dallmar was scouting these kids as they played during

bothered: the Tribe went on to run the Falcons off the court, 90-69.

FUTURE PHENOMS—You can't see him here, but reliable reports indicate that
Indian Coach Howie Dallmar was scouting these kids as they played during
half-time of Saturday night's Stanford-Air Force game. But he needn't have
bothered: the Tribe went on to run the Falcons off the court, 90-69.
Chuck Moore and Dennis
O'Neill couldn't quite beat
Wyoming Friday night. Saturday
everybody helped out and the
Indians blasted Air Force to
salvage a weekend non-conference
basketball split at Maples.
While leading the Falcons from
tip to buzzer, Stanford cranked
up a rapid-fire fast break, shot a
blistering 64 percent from the
field and had all five starters, led
by Claude Terry and 26 points, in
double figures. The Indians won
easily, 90-69.
The night before was a
different story.
O'Neill scored almost half of
Stanford's points (35 of 74) and
Moore wrestled down almost half
of Stanford's rebounds (20 of 44)
while also tossing in 16, but
Wyoming, aided by Indian fouls,
overcame a first half deficit of 10
and then held on for the win,
84-74.
Terry and Bill Palmer, held to
eight and two points by the 18th
ranked Cowboys, came back for
26 and 17 respectively against Air
Force and were helped by Moore
with 15, O'Neill with 13 and Fred
Green with 11.
Stanford is now 4-10 for the
season and 3-4 on its home court.
Against the Falcons the Tribe
leaped to an 8-1 lead, upped it to
25-7 as Air Force went over three
minutes without a bucket, and
never led by less than 13 in the
second half.
Bert Spear, a 5-10 guard led
Falcon scorers with 18. mostly on

long jump shots over Stanford's
zone defense.
It was the same zone that
nearly scuttled Wyoming the night
before. After five minutes and a
9-9 score, Stanford dropped its
man-for-man defense of the
Cowboys and took a 31-21
lead. Only the long shooting of
flat-topped forward Stan Dodds
who perched in the corner and
fired over the defense kept
Wyoming in the game. He finished
with 36 points.
Palmer and Green got into first
half foul trouble, and the
Cowboys narrowed the Stanford
lead to 41-37 at the half; they
pressed ahead with 15 minutes
left and then held off two Indian
charges—at 59-57 and 74-70—to
protect their victory.
With Moore in front and
Palmer behind, Stanford stymied
Cowboy Carl Ashley, who came in
with a 20.7 average, for much of
the game. He finished with 16,
most coming while Palmer was on
the bench. But Dodds was
something else.
The Stanford frosh easily won
both their games, blitzing the
Moffet Field Flyers 98-85, and
downing the UC-Davis freshmen,
86-56.
Pat Rusco led Stanford against
Moffet with 25 points, followed
by Pat Stevens with 19, and John
Stratton, 15. Stevens grabbed 18
rebounds and Rusco 11. Against
UCD, Stevens paced Tribe scoring
with 13, Rusco added 11 and
Mark Hanson contributed ten.
