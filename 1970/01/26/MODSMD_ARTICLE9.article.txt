# Massive California Campaign
## Lawsuits To Challange Voting Age 
### SUSAN KRIEGER 
Something is finally being done
about lowering the voting age.
"Eighteen is generally the age
when the burdens are imposed.
Twenty-one is the age when the
privileges are extended," says
attorney John Cosgrove, who is
challenging the twenty-one year
old voting law in the California
courts.
Cosgrove and the Citizens for
Lowering the Voting Age, chaired
by Dennis Kinh, are planning a
massive campaign to change the
voting age to eighteen through
California's college newspapers
and through two lawsuits which
they are conducting.

"What we're trying to do," said
King, "is to bring the rights of
citizenship down from 21 to 18,
specifically the right to vote.
We're gearing towards California
because there are over a million
young people between 18 and 21
in California. Also, the way things
are going politically, California
can lead the rest of the country,
particularly Congress itself
towards action."
"We're asking people to sign
petitions which would get this
issue on the ballot, excluding
action by legislature, but 18-20
year olds can't circulate petitions.
You have to be a registered voter

to sign or even circulate a petition
and that's the big problem," King
S3'''
"Another channel is legislation.
We're working very hard to make
legislators aware that the voting
age should be lowered, and
making it a high priority."
"The only other channel
available is the executive branch,
and I for one don't see any action
on that. I've been haunting
Reagan for months and haven't
gotten any response. President
Nixon has made statements like
every President for the past 15
years that he is in favor of
lowering the voting age, period.
He has not suggested any action."
Cosgrove sees the 18 to 20 year
olds as a group with certain
special burdens, the draft, in
addition to regular burdens of
citizenship. "Even if we weren't in
Viet Nam now they would still be
the ones called upon to fight any
war of this nature, and they are
entitled to participate in the
election of those who decide
whether or not to fight a war."
The same arguments are being
used against lowering the voting
age as those against women

suffrage, that the new voters
would merely vote like their
parents. But "how they vote
doesn't affect the right to vote,
and they wouldn't vote with their
parents if the law would hurt
them," he said.
Lawsuit
In order to secure voting rights
for this age-group, Cosgrove and
King are concentrating on two
main avenues for reform. The first
is the lawsuits, one challenging the
law which states that voting rights
may be denied if the state has a
"compelling interest." This phrase
has not been clearly defined. The
other attempts to allow 18 to 20
year olds to circulate petitions.
Both are considered denials of the
equal protection laws.
In addition, they are initiating
a massive campaign through the
student newspapers of every
college, junior college and
university in California, of which
there are nearly 300. They will
circulate copies of their
correspondence with assembly
men and senators in the district of
each college.
"We feel," Cosgrove said, "that
we can put tremendous pressure
on these assembly men and
senators by letting them know

that people from 18 to 20 are
watching, because they might not
be voting in 1970, but they're all
going to be voting in '72.
Previously, Cosgrove and King
had been able to get 50% of the
senate and assembly to agree to
lower the voting age, but not the
two thirds necessary to change the
constitution. Now they hope to
get 50% to give 18 to 20 year olds
the right to circulate petitions.
Two-thirds is not needed because
this is not a constitutional issue.
"It might even be better to do it
through circulation because this
would help build an organization
that would go on to furthering the
election," said Cosgrove.
"We need help," said King, "as
far as research goes, as far as the
overall campaign goes. We need
people who will assume certain
responsibilities to get some jobs
done. Since we're dealing with
over 20 million individuals, it's
going to be a major campaign, so
the individual can carve out as
much action as he can."
King asks that anyone
interested in helping contact
Citizens for Lowering the Voting
Age at their work office in Palo
Alto, by calling 328-1887, or
going to 131 University Avenue.

on these assembly men and
senators by letting them know

that people from 18 to 20 are
watching, because they might not
be voting in 1970, but they're all
going to be voting in '72.
Previously, Cosgrove and King
had been able to get 50% of the
senate and assembly to agree to
lower the voting age, but not the
two thirds necessary to change the
constitution. Now they hope to
get 50% to give 18 to 20 year olds
the right to circulate petitions.
Two-thirds is not needed because
this is not a constitutional issue.
"It might even be better to do it
through circulation because this
would help build an organization
that would go on to furthering the
election," said Cosgrove.
"We need help," said King, "as
far as research goes, as far as the
overall campaign goes. We need
people who will assume certain
responsibilities to get some jobs
done. Since we're dealing with
over 20 million individuals, it's
going to be a major campaign, so
the individual can carve out as
much action as he can."
King asks that anyone
interested in helping contact
Citizens for Lowering the Voting
Age at their work office in Palo
Alto, by calling 328-1887, or
going to 131 University Avenue.
Something is finally being done
about lowering the voting age.
"Eighteen is generally the age
when the burdens are imposed.
Twenty-one is the age when the
privileges are extended," says
attorney John Cosgrove, who is
challenging the twenty-one year
old voting law in the California
courts.
Cosgrove and the Citizens for
Lowering the Voting Age, chaired
by Dennis Kinh, are planning a
massive campaign to change the
voting age to eighteen through
California's college newspapers
and through two lawsuits which
they are conducting.

"What we're trying to do," said
King, "is to bring the rights of
citizenship down from 21 to 18,
specifically the right to vote.
We're gearing towards California
because there are over a million
young people between 18 and 21
in California. Also, the way things
are going politically, California
can lead the rest of the country,
particularly Congress itself
towards action."
"We're asking people to sign
petitions which would get this
issue on the ballot, excluding
action by legislature, but 18-20
year olds can't circulate petitions.
You have to be a registered voter

to sign or even circulate a petition
and that's the big problem," King
S3'''
"Another channel is legislation.
We're working very hard to make
legislators aware that the voting
age should be lowered, and
making it a high priority."
"The only other channel
available is the executive branch,
and I for one don't see any action
on that. I've been haunting
Reagan for months and haven't
gotten any response. President
Nixon has made statements like
every President for the past 15
years that he is in favor of
lowering the voting age, period.
He has not suggested any action."
Cosgrove sees the 18 to 20 year
olds as a group with certain
special burdens, the draft, in
addition to regular burdens of
citizenship. "Even if we weren't in
Viet Nam now they would still be
the ones called upon to fight any
war of this nature, and they are
entitled to participate in the
election of those who decide
whether or not to fight a war."
The same arguments are being
used against lowering the voting
age as those against women

suffrage, that the new voters
would merely vote like their
parents. But "how they vote
doesn't affect the right to vote,
and they wouldn't vote with their
parents if the law would hurt
them," he said.
Lawsuit
In order to secure voting rights
for this age-group, Cosgrove and
King are concentrating on two
main avenues for reform. The first
is the lawsuits, one challenging the
law which states that voting rights
may be denied if the state has a
"compelling interest." This phrase
has not been clearly defined. The
other attempts to allow 18 to 20
year olds to circulate petitions.
Both are considered denials of the
equal protection laws.
In addition, they are initiating
a massive campaign through the
student newspapers of every
college, junior college and
university in California, of which
there are nearly 300. They will
circulate copies of their
correspondence with assembly
men and senators in the district of
each college.

Viet Nam now they would still be
the ones called upon to fight any
war of this nature, and they are
entitled to participate in the
election of those who decide
whether or not to fight a war."
The same arguments are being
used against lowering the voting
age as those against women

suffrage, that the new voters
would merely vote like their
parents. But "how they vote
doesn't affect the right to vote,
and they wouldn't vote with their
parents if the law would hurt
them," he said.
Lawsuit
In order to secure voting rights
for this age-group, Cosgrove and
King are concentrating on two
main avenues for reform. The first
is the lawsuits, one challenging the
law which states that voting rights
may be denied if the state has a
"compelling interest." This phrase
has not been clearly defined. The
other attempts to allow 18 to 20
year olds to circulate petitions.
Both are considered denials of the
equal protection laws.
In addition, they are initiating
a massive campaign through the
student newspapers of every
college, junior college and
university in California, of which
there are nearly 300. They will
circulate copies of their
correspondence with assembly
men and senators in the district of
each college.
"We feel," Cosgrove said, "that
we can put tremendous pressure
on these assembly men and
senators by letting them know

that people from 18 to 20 are
watching, because they might not
be voting in 1970, but they're all
going to be voting in '72.
Previously, Cosgrove and King
had been able to get 50% of the
senate and assembly to agree to
lower the voting age, but not the
two thirds necessary to change the
constitution. Now they hope to
get 50% to give 18 to 20 year olds
the right to circulate petitions.
Two-thirds is not needed because
this is not a constitutional issue.
"It might even be better to do it
through circulation because this
would help build an organization
that would go on to furthering the
election," said Cosgrove.
"We need help," said King, "as
far as research goes, as far as the
overall campaign goes. We need
people who will assume certain
responsibilities to get some jobs
done. Since we're dealing with
over 20 million individuals, it's
going to be a major campaign, so
the individual can carve out as
much action as he can."
King asks that anyone
interested in helping contact
Citizens for Lowering the Voting
Age at their work office in Palo
Alto, by calling 328-1887, or
going to 131 University Avenue.
