TO CAMPUS
TUESDAY, FEB. 10
See your Placement Director today to ar
range an appointment with the Xerox
representative.
Discover what Xerox is doing in color
xerography, 3-D imaging, laser applica
tions, and systems that mate xerography
and computers. Learn, too, of the contin
uous refinements being developed for
and incorporated in our line of office cop
iers and duplicators.
During the question and answer ses
sion, you'll also get a better idea for some
of the reasons behind our growth. From
approximately 3,000 people in 1960 to
over 30,000 currently.
Ask him, too, about the Xerox philoso
phy. How we've always operated on the
premise that you can make meaningful
contributions to society that contribute
quite gainfully to yourself. And us.
This investment of your time could be
the start of a rewarding future at our sub
urban Rochester, New York facilities in
research, engineering, manufacturing,
programming, finance, statistics or mar
keting/sales.
