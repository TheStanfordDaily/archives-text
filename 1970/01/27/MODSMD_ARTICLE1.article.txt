# Nairobi College: Blacks Go It Alone
## 
### RICHARD EMBRY 
"I think of it as a kind of
dialectical encounter we're going
to have—you learn something
from me, I'll learn something
from you, and we'll both come up
together."
Five attentive students listened
to Prof. Cedrick Clark's
concluding remarks at the first
meeting of the introductory
psychology course. The scene
might have been taken right off of
a page in The Undergraduate At
Stanford—"Numerous small
seminars, campus favorites,
facilitate warm student-faculty
relationships"—except that the
instructor and four of the five
students in the stark room were
black.
Introductory psychology is one
of 31 courses offered this quarter
at Nairobi College, the East Palo
Alto school primarily for "peoples
of color" which made news last
fall with its textbook drive. Described
by its founders as an "alternative
to an educational system which
serves all people badly and people
of color not at all," the College
opened last September as the
third step in the development of a

complete educational system for
the community. Dissatisfaction
with Palo Alto elementary schools
led to the establishment of the
Nairobi Day School in 1966,
followed by the organization of
Nairobi High School in April,
1968.
Student Clamor
Later in 1968, a number of
conflicts involving blacks occurred
at the College of San Mateo. On
Dec. 13, Robert Hoover, director
of the highly successful College
Readiness Program at CSM for
minority students, was fired along
with several other black
instructors. Enraged black
students at CSM clamored for a
new college.
"All they wanted was a chance
to really go to school, without
having to hassle with teachers,
administrators, and other
students—a chance to go just to
school," relates Hoover.
Foreign Values
"In trying to develop black
students into leaders, we were
teaching them a foreign value
system. We were telling kids to be
aggressive, to be verbal, to be

critical, and not to just analyze a
problem, but to remove the cause
of the problem as well. The white
officials just couldn't handle
that,'' reflects Hoover,
interpreting the CSM affair. "CSM
had one of the best programs in
the country, but the
administration and board of
trustees didn't know anyone,
didn't trust anyone, and they
destroyed it."
Nairobi College operates by
"utilizing the resources of the
community." Classes meet in
homes, garages, and churches
throughout East Palo Alto. The
College offices are housed in a
small white frame building at 805
Runnymede in East Paly. The
unpaved driveway, soaked with
winter rains, is greasy and
splotched with deep puddles.
Organized by adult leaders,
Nairobi College is run largely on
student power. Manning desks,
busy with typewriters and
telephones, student staff members
keep the Nairobi offices open into
the night, even on Fridays.
Nairobi students have equal
representation of the Advisory
Board and planning committees.
Applicants for faculty positions
must be approved by an
all-student committee.
Student Run
When asked if Nairobi students
had formed any sort of
organization among themselves,
Hoover, now acting president of
the College, was amused. "These
students don't need any kind of
structure; they run the school.
When they have a meeting, they're
talking about real honest-to-God
policies, and not playing games."
Of the 150 students, there are
about ten chicanos and four
whites; the rest are blacks. The
large majority of them are from
East Palo Alto and neighboring
communities, but five blacks from
New Jersey and four from
Chicago, former and part-time
CSM students, are now enrolled at
Nariobi.
Stanford senior Johnie Scott,
Thelton Henderson, Assistant

Dean of the Stanford School of
Law, the Asst. Dean of Students
at Santa Clara, and other
instructors from Stanford, San
Jose, and Canada College are
listed as faculty members by the
College.
A retired marketing advisor for
the State Department is teaching
marketing principles this quarter.
Other courses offered are
sociology, psychology,
photography, rhetoric, black
literature, journalism,
mathematics, physics, ancient
black history, black legal
problems, political science,
Swahili, and a course contrasting
English with the "street" language
of blacks.
Local Service
When more complete
organization of the College is
achieved, all Nairobi students will
be expected to work for a
minimum of four hours per day in
local service organizations such as
health centers, schools, and
welfare, probation, legal aid and
information centers as a part of
their regular curricula.
Despite the capabilities of the
faculty, Hoover emphasizes that
there are special problems
involved in teaching black
students who have been told all
their lives that they can"„ learn.
"The staff is just now in the
process of learning to really teach.
When a black kid is put into a
chemistry or physics class, he
probably hasn't had any math,
and he's scared to death. The
teacher must understand that he
has more to do than simply write
formulas on the blackboard."
At this point, Hoover believes,
it is essential that pyschology be
applied. "The teacher has to be
absolutely sure that the student
knows what he is talking about.
The student must be given the
confidence that he can do what
the teacher can do."
To insure that each Nairobi
student receives as much
individual attention as he requires,
Hoover will expect every staff
member, including those in

administrative positions, to
assume counseling responsibilities.
President Hoover admits that
both himself and the students
were "a little shaky" when
Nairobi opened, but he is amazed
at the growing enthusiasm. In a
community such as East Palo
Alto, enthusiasm is probably the
best index of success that Nairobi
has. At a press conference last
week, Hoover claimed that
Nairobi College had succeeded in
"turning on the turned-off."
A student from Chicago agrees.
"When I was at CSM, I was really
down, turned off to everything.
Now it's completely different.
Bob's (Hoover) got a good thing
going."
Hoover seems convinced that
enthusiasm at Nairobi will not
wane as the school devlops.
Leaning forward in a padded chair
in his small office, he gleamed
excitedly as he predicted, "This
will be the most exciting place in
the world to teach!"
At last week's press conference
architectural plans were unveiled
for the remodeling of the Nairobi
office building and the house next
door, currently in use as a
schoolhouse for the elementary
school. An estimated $400,000 is
needed for building in the more
distant future.
The College has been
recommended for a $200,000
Federal grant, but the
recommendation still must go
through Washington processes. A
request to the Federal Office of
Economic Opportunity for
$500,000 will be submitted in
February. A fund raising goal of
$160,000 has been set for the
69-70 school year, of which
$61,000 has been amassed.
An evaluation is being drawn
up to obtain accreditation for the
College, but Hoover neither
expects Nairobi to accredited, nor
does he see accreditation to be
important except to the extent
that it acquaints students with the
"social games" that the white
American power structure expects
them to play.

Accreditation or not, Hoover
doesn't foresee much trouble
getting Nairobi students into to
other schools. Written agreement
to accept transfer credits has
already been obtained from
Central Michigan, Antioch,
Goddard, and Scripps. The
University of Santa Clara has
extended verbal agreement of
transfer credit acceptance, and a
meeting is scheduled soon with
Stanford officials to work out a
policy. Stanford has offered the
use of the Undergraduate Library
to Nairobi students, and several
Nairobi students are enrolled in
Stanford classes.
Afraid of Failure
A British woman once told
Robert Hoover that one of the
reasons Americans never did
anything creative was that they
were afraid of failure. Despite the
fact that he and other organizers
and the students of Nairobi
College have already created a
community college for their

people which shows every sign of
success, Hoover admits that he is
fearful of failure.
Although Hoover recognizes
white support as vital, he thinks
that the problems of black
Americans can be solved only
with black owned and operated
institutions like Nairobi College
which provide a means by which
blacks can raise themselves. "If
we're going to solve the problem,
we must let blacks solve the
problem, first through leadership
along our own guidelines. But we
must be realistic —the black
community is bankrupt. We must
have white support."
Robert Hoover believes that
able leadership from the adult
population on the Peninsula has
resulted in blacks in the area
having more influence and control
over their lives than any other
blacks in the country.
Consequently, black people here
have built rather than destroyed.
Nairobi College is his best
example.

must be approved by an
all-student committee.
Student Run
When asked if Nairobi students
had formed any sort of
organization among themselves,
Hoover, now acting president of
the College, was amused. "These
students don't need any kind of
structure; they run the school.
When they have a meeting, they're
talking about real honest-to-God
policies, and not playing games."
Of the 150 students, there are
about ten chicanos and four
whites; the rest are blacks. The
large majority of them are from
East Palo Alto and neighboring
communities, but five blacks from
New Jersey and four from
Chicago, former and part-time
CSM students, are now enrolled at
Nariobi.
Stanford senior Johnie Scott,
Thelton Henderson, Assistant

Dean of the Stanford School of
Law, the Asst. Dean of Students
at Santa Clara, and other
instructors from Stanford, San
Jose, and Canada College are
listed as faculty members by the
College.
A retired marketing advisor for
the State Department is teaching
marketing principles this quarter.
Other courses offered are
sociology, psychology,
photography, rhetoric, black
literature, journalism,
mathematics, physics, ancient
black history, black legal
problems, political science,
Swahili, and a course contrasting
English with the "street" language
of blacks.
Local Service
When more complete
organization of the College is
achieved, all Nairobi students will
be expected to work for a
minimum of four hours per day in
local service organizations such as
health centers, schools, and
welfare, probation, legal aid and
information centers as a part of
their regular curricula.
Despite the capabilities of the
faculty, Hoover emphasizes that
there are special problems
involved in teaching black
students who have been told all
their lives that they can"„ learn.
"The staff is just now in the
process of learning to really teach.
When a black kid is put into a
chemistry or physics class, he
probably hasn't had any math,
and he's scared to death. The
teacher must understand that he
has more to do than simply write
formulas on the blackboard."
At this point, Hoover believes,
it is essential that pyschology be
applied. "The teacher has to be
absolutely sure that the student
knows what he is talking about.
The student must be given the
confidence that he can do what
the teacher can do."
To insure that each Nairobi
student receives as much
individual attention as he requires,
Hoover will expect every staff
member, including those in

administrative positions, to
assume counseling responsibilities.
President Hoover admits that
both himself and the students
were "a little shaky" when
Nairobi opened, but he is amazed
at the growing enthusiasm. In a
community such as East Palo
Alto, enthusiasm is probably the
best index of success that Nairobi
has. At a press conference last
week, Hoover claimed that
Nairobi College had succeeded in
"turning on the turned-off."
A student from Chicago agrees.
"When I was at CSM, I was really
down, turned off to everything.
Now it's completely different.
Bob's (Hoover) got a good thing
going."
Hoover seems convinced that
enthusiasm at Nairobi will not
wane as the school devlops.
Leaning forward in a padded chair
in his small office, he gleamed
excitedly as he predicted, "This
will be the most exciting place in
the world to teach!"
At last week's press conference
architectural plans were unveiled
for the remodeling of the Nairobi
office building and the house next
door, currently in use as a
schoolhouse for the elementary
school. An estimated $400,000 is
needed for building in the more
distant future.
The College has been
recommended for a $200,000
Federal grant, but the
recommendation still must go
through Washington processes. A
request to the Federal Office of
Economic Opportunity for
$500,000 will be submitted in
February. A fund raising goal of
$160,000 has been set for the
69-70 school year, of which
$61,000 has been amassed.
An evaluation is being drawn
up to obtain accreditation for the
College, but Hoover neither
expects Nairobi to accredited, nor
does he see accreditation to be
important except to the extent
that it acquaints students with the
"social games" that the white
American power structure expects
them to play.

Accreditation or not, Hoover
doesn't foresee much trouble
getting Nairobi students into to
other schools. Written agreement
to accept transfer credits has
already been obtained from
Central Michigan, Antioch,
Goddard, and Scripps. The
University of Santa Clara has
extended verbal agreement of
transfer credit acceptance, and a
meeting is scheduled soon with
Stanford officials to work out a
policy. Stanford has offered the
use of the Undergraduate Library
to Nairobi students, and several
Nairobi students are enrolled in
Stanford classes.
Afraid of Failure
A British woman once told
Robert Hoover that one of the
reasons Americans never did
anything creative was that they
were afraid of failure. Despite the
fact that he and other organizers
and the students of Nairobi
College have already created a
community college for their

people which shows every sign of
success, Hoover admits that he is
fearful of failure.
Although Hoover recognizes
white support as vital, he thinks
that the problems of black
Americans can be solved only
with black owned and operated
institutions like Nairobi College
which provide a means by which
blacks can raise themselves. "If
we're going to solve the problem,
we must let blacks solve the
problem, first through leadership
along our own guidelines. But we
must be realistic —the black
community is bankrupt. We must
have white support."
Robert Hoover believes that
able leadership from the adult
population on the Peninsula has
resulted in blacks in the area
having more influence and control
over their lives than any other
blacks in the country.
Consequently, black people here
have built rather than destroyed.
Nairobi College is his best
example.


NAIROBI HEADQUARTERS— A small frame house is all thai Nairobi College
has for its main office. Classes meet in homes, garages, and churches in East Palo
Alto, and there are tentative plans for a new building if federal funds are
approved.


NAIROBI DIRECTOR—Robert Hoover, president of Nairobi College, talks with
a secretary in bis small office. Despite scarce funds and little formal recognition,
Hoover claims, "Tbis will be tbe most exciting place in the world to teach!"
"I think of it as a kind of
dialectical encounter we're going
to have—you learn something
from me, I'll learn something
from you, and we'll both come up
together."
Five attentive students listened
to Prof. Cedrick Clark's
concluding remarks at the first
meeting of the introductory
psychology course. The scene
might have been taken right off of
a page in The Undergraduate At
Stanford—"Numerous small
seminars, campus favorites,
facilitate warm student-faculty
relationships"—except that the
instructor and four of the five
students in the stark room were
black.
Introductory psychology is one
of 31 courses offered this quarter
at Nairobi College, the East Palo
Alto school primarily for "peoples
of color" which made news last
fall with its textbook drive. Described
by its founders as an "alternative
to an educational system which
serves all people badly and people
of color not at all," the College
opened last September as the
third step in the development of a

complete educational system for
the community. Dissatisfaction
with Palo Alto elementary schools
led to the establishment of the
Nairobi Day School in 1966,
followed by the organization of
Nairobi High School in April,
1968.
Student Clamor
Later in 1968, a number of
conflicts involving blacks occurred
at the College of San Mateo. On
Dec. 13, Robert Hoover, director
of the highly successful College
Readiness Program at CSM for
minority students, was fired along
with several other black
instructors. Enraged black
students at CSM clamored for a
new college.
"All they wanted was a chance
to really go to school, without
having to hassle with teachers,
administrators, and other
students—a chance to go just to
school," relates Hoover.
Foreign Values
"In trying to develop black
students into leaders, we were
teaching them a foreign value
system. We were telling kids to be
aggressive, to be verbal, to be

critical, and not to just analyze a
problem, but to remove the cause
of the problem as well. The white
officials just couldn't handle
that,'' reflects Hoover,
interpreting the CSM affair. "CSM
had one of the best programs in
the country, but the
administration and board of
trustees didn't know anyone,
didn't trust anyone, and they
destroyed it."
Nairobi College operates by
"utilizing the resources of the
community." Classes meet in
homes, garages, and churches
throughout East Palo Alto. The
College offices are housed in a
small white frame building at 805
Runnymede in East Paly. The
unpaved driveway, soaked with
winter rains, is greasy and
splotched with deep puddles.
Organized by adult leaders,
Nairobi College is run largely on
student power. Manning desks,
busy with typewriters and
telephones, student staff members
keep the Nairobi offices open into
the night, even on Fridays.
Nairobi students have equal
representation of the Advisory
Board and planning committees.
Applicants for faculty positions

Now it's completely different.
Bob's (Hoover) got a good thing
going."
Hoover seems convinced that
enthusiasm at Nairobi will not
wane as the school devlops.
Leaning forward in a padded chair
in his small office, he gleamed
excitedly as he predicted, "This
will be the most exciting place in
the world to teach!"
At last week's press conference
architectural plans were unveiled
for the remodeling of the Nairobi
office building and the house next
door, currently in use as a
schoolhouse for the elementary
school. An estimated $400,000 is
needed for building in the more
distant future.
The College has been
recommended for a $200,000
Federal grant, but the
recommendation still must go
through Washington processes. A
request to the Federal Office of
Economic Opportunity for
$500,000 will be submitted in
February. A fund raising goal of
$160,000 has been set for the
69-70 school year, of which
$61,000 has been amassed.
An evaluation is being drawn
up to obtain accreditation for the
College, but Hoover neither
expects Nairobi to accredited, nor
does he see accreditation to be
important except to the extent
that it acquaints students with the
"social games" that the white
American power structure expects
them to play.

Accreditation or not, Hoover
doesn't foresee much trouble
getting Nairobi students into to
other schools. Written agreement
to accept transfer credits has
already been obtained from
Central Michigan, Antioch,
Goddard, and Scripps. The
University of Santa Clara has
extended verbal agreement of
transfer credit acceptance, and a
meeting is scheduled soon with
Stanford officials to work out a
policy. Stanford has offered the
use of the Undergraduate Library
to Nairobi students, and several
Nairobi students are enrolled in
Stanford classes.
Afraid of Failure
A British woman once told
Robert Hoover that one of the
reasons Americans never did
anything creative was that they
were afraid of failure. Despite the
fact that he and other organizers
and the students of Nairobi
College have already created a
community college for their

people which shows every sign of
success, Hoover admits that he is
fearful of failure.
Although Hoover recognizes
white support as vital, he thinks
that the problems of black
Americans can be solved only
with black owned and operated
institutions like Nairobi College
which provide a means by which
blacks can raise themselves. "If
we're going to solve the problem,
we must let blacks solve the
problem, first through leadership
along our own guidelines. But we
must be realistic —the black
community is bankrupt. We must
have white support."
Robert Hoover believes that
able leadership from the adult
population on the Peninsula has
resulted in blacks in the area
having more influence and control
over their lives than any other
blacks in the country.
Consequently, black people here
have built rather than destroyed.
Nairobi College is his best
example.


NAIROBI HEADQUARTERS— A small frame house is all thai Nairobi College
has for its main office. Classes meet in homes, garages, and churches in East Palo
Alto, and there are tentative plans for a new building if federal funds are
approved.


NAIROBI DIRECTOR—Robert Hoover, president of Nairobi College, talks with
a secretary in bis small office. Despite scarce funds and little formal recognition,
Hoover claims, "Tbis will be tbe most exciting place in the world to teach!"
"I think of it as a kind of
dialectical encounter we're going
to have—you learn something
from me, I'll learn something
from you, and we'll both come up
together."
Five attentive students listened
to Prof. Cedrick Clark's
concluding remarks at the first
meeting of the introductory
psychology course. The scene
might have been taken right off of
a page in The Undergraduate At
Stanford—"Numerous small
seminars, campus favorites,
facilitate warm student-faculty
relationships"—except that the
instructor and four of the five
students in the stark room were
black.
Introductory psychology is one
of 31 courses offered this quarter
at Nairobi College, the East Palo
Alto school primarily for "peoples
of color" which made news last
fall with its textbook drive. Described
by its founders as an "alternative
to an educational system which
serves all people badly and people
of color not at all," the College
opened last September as the
third step in the development of a

complete educational system for
the community. Dissatisfaction
with Palo Alto elementary schools
led to the establishment of the
Nairobi Day School in 1966,
followed by the organization of
Nairobi High School in April,
1968.
Student Clamor
Later in 1968, a number of
conflicts involving blacks occurred
at the College of San Mateo. On
Dec. 13, Robert Hoover, director
of the highly successful College
Readiness Program at CSM for
minority students, was fired along
with several other black
instructors. Enraged black
students at CSM clamored for a
new college.
"All they wanted was a chance
to really go to school, without
having to hassle with teachers,
administrators, and other
students—a chance to go just to
school," relates Hoover.
Foreign Values
"In trying to develop black
students into leaders, we were
teaching them a foreign value
system. We were telling kids to be
aggressive, to be verbal, to be

critical, and not to just analyze a
problem, but to remove the cause
of the problem as well. The white
officials just couldn't handle
that,'' reflects Hoover,
interpreting the CSM affair. "CSM
had one of the best programs in
the country, but the
administration and board of
trustees didn't know anyone,
didn't trust anyone, and they
destroyed it."
Nairobi College operates by
"utilizing the resources of the
community." Classes meet in
homes, garages, and churches
throughout East Palo Alto. The
College offices are housed in a
small white frame building at 805
Runnymede in East Paly. The
unpaved driveway, soaked with
winter rains, is greasy and
splotched with deep puddles.
Organized by adult leaders,
Nairobi College is run largely on
student power. Manning desks,
busy with typewriters and
telephones, student staff members
keep the Nairobi offices open into
the night, even on Fridays.
Nairobi students have equal
representation of the Advisory
Board and planning committees.
Applicants for faculty positions
must be approved by an
all-student committee.
Student Run
When asked if Nairobi students
had formed any sort of
organization among themselves,
Hoover, now acting president of
the College, was amused. "These
students don't need any kind of
structure; they run the school.
When they have a meeting, they're
talking about real honest-to-God
policies, and not playing games."
Of the 150 students, there are
about ten chicanos and four
whites; the rest are blacks. The
large majority of them are from
East Palo Alto and neighboring
communities, but five blacks from
New Jersey and four from
Chicago, former and part-time
CSM students, are now enrolled at
Nariobi.
Stanford senior Johnie Scott,
Thelton Henderson, Assistant

Dean of the Stanford School of
Law, the Asst. Dean of Students
at Santa Clara, and other
instructors from Stanford, San
Jose, and Canada College are
listed as faculty members by the
College.
A retired marketing advisor for
the State Department is teaching
marketing principles this quarter.
Other courses offered are
sociology, psychology,
photography, rhetoric, black
literature, journalism,
mathematics, physics, ancient
black history, black legal
problems, political science,
Swahili, and a course contrasting
English with the "street" language
of blacks.
Local Service
When more complete
organization of the College is
achieved, all Nairobi students will
be expected to work for a
minimum of four hours per day in
local service organizations such as
health centers, schools, and
welfare, probation, legal aid and
information centers as a part of
their regular curricula.
Despite the capabilities of the
faculty, Hoover emphasizes that
there are special problems
involved in teaching black
students who have been told all
their lives that they can"„ learn.
"The staff is just now in the
process of learning to really teach.
When a black kid is put into a
chemistry or physics class, he
probably hasn't had any math,
and he's scared to death. The
teacher must understand that he
has more to do than simply write
formulas on the blackboard."
At this point, Hoover believes,
it is essential that pyschology be
applied. "The teacher has to be
absolutely sure that the student
knows what he is talking about.
The student must be given the
confidence that he can do what
the teacher can do."
To insure that each Nairobi
student receives as much
individual attention as he requires,
Hoover will expect every staff
member, including those in

administrative positions, to
assume counseling responsibilities.
President Hoover admits that
both himself and the students
were "a little shaky" when
Nairobi opened, but he is amazed
at the growing enthusiasm. In a
community such as East Palo
Alto, enthusiasm is probably the
best index of success that Nairobi
has. At a press conference last
week, Hoover claimed that
Nairobi College had succeeded in
"turning on the turned-off."
A student from Chicago agrees.
"When I was at CSM, I was really
down, turned off to everything.
Now it's completely different.
Bob's (Hoover) got a good thing
going."

NAIROBI HEADQUARTERS— A small frame house is all thai Nairobi College
has for its main office. Classes meet in homes, garages, and churches in East Palo
Alto, and there are tentative plans for a new building if federal funds are
approved.


NAIROBI DIRECTOR—Robert Hoover, president of Nairobi College, talks with
a secretary in bis small office. Despite scarce funds and little formal recognition,
Hoover claims, "Tbis will be tbe most exciting place in the world to teach!"
"I think of it as a kind of
dialectical encounter we're going
to have—you learn something
from me, I'll learn something
from you, and we'll both come up
together."
Five attentive students listened
to Prof. Cedrick Clark's
concluding remarks at the first
meeting of the introductory
psychology course. The scene
might have been taken right off of
a page in The Undergraduate At
Stanford—"Numerous small
seminars, campus favorites,
facilitate warm student-faculty
relationships"—except that the
instructor and four of the five
students in the stark room were
black.
Introductory psychology is one
of 31 courses offered this quarter
at Nairobi College, the East Palo
Alto school primarily for "peoples
of color" which made news last
fall with its textbook drive. Described
by its founders as an "alternative
to an educational system which
serves all people badly and people
of color not at all," the College
opened last September as the
third step in the development of a

complete educational system for
the community. Dissatisfaction
with Palo Alto elementary schools
led to the establishment of the
Nairobi Day School in 1966,
followed by the organization of
Nairobi High School in April,
1968.
Student Clamor
Later in 1968, a number of
conflicts involving blacks occurred
at the College of San Mateo. On
Dec. 13, Robert Hoover, director
of the highly successful College
Readiness Program at CSM for
minority students, was fired along
with several other black
instructors. Enraged black
students at CSM clamored for a
new college.
"All they wanted was a chance
to really go to school, without
having to hassle with teachers,
administrators, and other
students—a chance to go just to
school," relates Hoover.
Foreign Values
"In trying to develop black
students into leaders, we were
teaching them a foreign value
system. We were telling kids to be
aggressive, to be verbal, to be

critical, and not to just analyze a
problem, but to remove the cause
of the problem as well. The white
officials just couldn't handle
that,'' reflects Hoover,
interpreting the CSM affair. "CSM
had one of the best programs in
the country, but the
administration and board of
trustees didn't know anyone,
didn't trust anyone, and they
destroyed it."
Nairobi College operates by
"utilizing the resources of the
community." Classes meet in
homes, garages, and churches
throughout East Palo Alto. The
College offices are housed in a
small white frame building at 805
Runnymede in East Paly. The
unpaved driveway, soaked with
winter rains, is greasy and
splotched with deep puddles.
Organized by adult leaders,
Nairobi College is run largely on
student power. Manning desks,
busy with typewriters and
telephones, student staff members
keep the Nairobi offices open into
the night, even on Fridays.
Nairobi students have equal
representation of the Advisory
Board and planning committees.
Applicants for faculty positions
must be approved by an
all-student committee.
Student Run
When asked if Nairobi students
had formed any sort of
organization among themselves,
Hoover, now acting president of
the College, was amused. "These
students don't need any kind of
structure; they run the school.
When they have a meeting, they're
talking about real honest-to-God
policies, and not playing games."
Of the 150 students, there are
about ten chicanos and four
whites; the rest are blacks. The
large majority of them are from
East Palo Alto and neighboring
communities, but five blacks from
New Jersey and four from
Chicago, former and part-time
CSM students, are now enrolled at
Nariobi.
Stanford senior Johnie Scott,
Thelton Henderson, Assistant

Dean of the Stanford School of
Law, the Asst. Dean of Students
at Santa Clara, and other
instructors from Stanford, San
Jose, and Canada College are
listed as faculty members by the
College.
A retired marketing advisor for
the State Department is teaching
marketing principles this quarter.
Other courses offered are
sociology, psychology,
photography, rhetoric, black
literature, journalism,
mathematics, physics, ancient
black history, black legal
problems, political science,
Swahili, and a course contrasting
English with the "street" language
of blacks.
Local Service
When more complete
organization of the College is
achieved, all Nairobi students will
be expected to work for a
minimum of four hours per day in
local service organizations such as
health centers, schools, and
welfare, probation, legal aid and
information centers as a part of
their regular curricula.
Despite the capabilities of the
faculty, Hoover emphasizes that
there are special problems
involved in teaching black
students who have been told all
their lives that they can"„ learn.
"The staff is just now in the
process of learning to really teach.
When a black kid is put into a
chemistry or physics class, he
probably hasn't had any math,
and he's scared to death. The
teacher must understand that he
has more to do than simply write
formulas on the blackboard."
At this point, Hoover believes,
it is essential that pyschology be
applied. "The teacher has to be
absolutely sure that the student
knows what he is talking about.
The student must be given the
confidence that he can do what
the teacher can do."
To insure that each Nairobi
student receives as much
individual attention as he requires,
Hoover will expect every staff
member, including those in

administrative positions, to
assume counseling responsibilities.
President Hoover admits that
both himself and the students
were "a little shaky" when
Nairobi opened, but he is amazed
at the growing enthusiasm. In a
community such as East Palo
Alto, enthusiasm is probably the
best index of success that Nairobi
has. At a press conference last
week, Hoover claimed that
Nairobi College had succeeded in
"turning on the turned-off."
A student from Chicago agrees.
"When I was at CSM, I was really
down, turned off to everything.
Now it's completely different.
Bob's (Hoover) got a good thing
going."
Hoover seems convinced that
enthusiasm at Nairobi will not
wane as the school devlops.
Leaning forward in a padded chair
in his small office, he gleamed
excitedly as he predicted, "This
will be the most exciting place in
the world to teach!"
At last week's press conference
architectural plans were unveiled
for the remodeling of the Nairobi
office building and the house next
door, currently in use as a
schoolhouse for the elementary
school. An estimated $400,000 is
needed for building in the more
distant future.
The College has been
recommended for a $200,000
Federal grant, but the
recommendation still must go
through Washington processes. A
request to the Federal Office of
Economic Opportunity for
$500,000 will be submitted in
February. A fund raising goal of
$160,000 has been set for the
69-70 school year, of which
$61,000 has been amassed.
An evaluation is being drawn
up to obtain accreditation for the
College, but Hoover neither
expects Nairobi to accredited, nor
does he see accreditation to be
important except to the extent
that it acquaints students with the
"social games" that the white
American power structure expects
them to play.

Accreditation or not, Hoover
doesn't foresee much trouble
getting Nairobi students into to
other schools. Written agreement
to accept transfer credits has
already been obtained from
Central Michigan, Antioch,
Goddard, and Scripps. The
University of Santa Clara has
extended verbal agreement of
transfer credit acceptance, and a
meeting is scheduled soon with
Stanford officials to work out a
policy. Stanford has offered the
use of the Undergraduate Library
to Nairobi students, and several
Nairobi students are enrolled in
Stanford classes.
Afraid of Failure
A British woman once told
Robert Hoover that one of the
reasons Americans never did
anything creative was that they
were afraid of failure. Despite the
fact that he and other organizers
and the students of Nairobi
College have already created a
community college for their

people which shows every sign of
success, Hoover admits that he is
fearful of failure.
Although Hoover recognizes
white support as vital, he thinks
that the problems of black
Americans can be solved only
with black owned and operated
institutions like Nairobi College
which provide a means by which
blacks can raise themselves. "If
we're going to solve the problem,
we must let blacks solve the
problem, first through leadership
along our own guidelines. But we
must be realistic —the black
community is bankrupt. We must
have white support."
Robert Hoover believes that
able leadership from the adult
population on the Peninsula has
resulted in blacks in the area
having more influence and control
over their lives than any other
blacks in the country.
Consequently, black people here
have built rather than destroyed.
Nairobi College is his best
example.

unpaved driveway, soaked with
winter rains, is greasy and
splotched with deep puddles.
Organized by adult leaders,
Nairobi College is run largely on
student power. Manning desks,
busy with typewriters and
telephones, student staff members
keep the Nairobi offices open into
the night, even on Fridays.
Nairobi students have equal
representation of the Advisory
Board and planning committees.
Applicants for faculty positions
must be approved by an
all-student committee.
Student Run
When asked if Nairobi students
had formed any sort of
organization among themselves,
Hoover, now acting president of
the College, was amused. "These
students don't need any kind of
structure; they run the school.
When they have a meeting, they're
talking about real honest-to-God
policies, and not playing games."
Of the 150 students, there are
about ten chicanos and four
whites; the rest are blacks. The
large majority of them are from
East Palo Alto and neighboring
communities, but five blacks from
New Jersey and four from
Chicago, former and part-time
CSM students, are now enrolled at
Nariobi.
Stanford senior Johnie Scott,
Thelton Henderson, Assistant

Dean of the Stanford School of
Law, the Asst. Dean of Students
at Santa Clara, and other
instructors from Stanford, San
Jose, and Canada College are
listed as faculty members by the
College.
A retired marketing advisor for
the State Department is teaching
marketing principles this quarter.
Other courses offered are
sociology, psychology,
photography, rhetoric, black
literature, journalism,
mathematics, physics, ancient
black history, black legal
problems, political science,
Swahili, and a course contrasting
English with the "street" language
of blacks.
Local Service
When more complete
organization of the College is
achieved, all Nairobi students will
be expected to work for a
minimum of four hours per day in
local service organizations such as
health centers, schools, and
welfare, probation, legal aid and
information centers as a part of
their regular curricula.
Despite the capabilities of the
faculty, Hoover emphasizes that
there are special problems
involved in teaching black
students who have been told all
their lives that they can"„ learn.
"The staff is just now in the
process of learning to really teach.
When a black kid is put into a
chemistry or physics class, he
probably hasn't had any math,
and he's scared to death. The
teacher must understand that he
has more to do than simply write
formulas on the blackboard."
At this point, Hoover believes,
it is essential that pyschology be
applied. "The teacher has to be
absolutely sure that the student
knows what he is talking about.
The student must be given the
confidence that he can do what
the teacher can do."
To insure that each Nairobi
student receives as much
individual attention as he requires,
Hoover will expect every staff
member, including those in

administrative positions, to
assume counseling responsibilities.
President Hoover admits that
both himself and the students
were "a little shaky" when
Nairobi opened, but he is amazed
at the growing enthusiasm. In a
community such as East Palo
Alto, enthusiasm is probably the
best index of success that Nairobi
has. At a press conference last
week, Hoover claimed that
Nairobi College had succeeded in
"turning on the turned-off."
A student from Chicago agrees.
"When I was at CSM, I was really
down, turned off to everything.
Now it's completely different.
Bob's (Hoover) got a good thing
going."
Hoover seems convinced that
enthusiasm at Nairobi will not
wane as the school devlops.
Leaning forward in a padded chair
in his small office, he gleamed
excitedly as he predicted, "This
will be the most exciting place in
the world to teach!"
At last week's press conference
architectural plans were unveiled
for the remodeling of the Nairobi
office building and the house next
door, currently in use as a
schoolhouse for the elementary
school. An estimated $400,000 is
needed for building in the more
distant future.
The College has been
recommended for a $200,000
Federal grant, but the
recommendation still must go
through Washington processes. A
request to the Federal Office of
Economic Opportunity for
$500,000 will be submitted in
February. A fund raising goal of
$160,000 has been set for the
69-70 school year, of which
$61,000 has been amassed.
An evaluation is being drawn
up to obtain accreditation for the
College, but Hoover neither
expects Nairobi to accredited, nor
does he see accreditation to be
important except to the extent
that it acquaints students with the
"social games" that the white
American power structure expects
them to play.

Accreditation or not, Hoover
doesn't foresee much trouble
getting Nairobi students into to
other schools. Written agreement
to accept transfer credits has
already been obtained from
Central Michigan, Antioch,
Goddard, and Scripps. The
University of Santa Clara has
extended verbal agreement of
transfer credit acceptance, and a
meeting is scheduled soon with
Stanford officials to work out a
policy. Stanford has offered the
use of the Undergraduate Library
to Nairobi students, and several
Nairobi students are enrolled in
Stanford classes.
Afraid of Failure
A British woman once told
Robert Hoover that one of the
reasons Americans never did
anything creative was that they
were afraid of failure. Despite the
fact that he and other organizers
and the students of Nairobi
College have already created a
community college for their

people which shows every sign of
success, Hoover admits that he is
fearful of failure.
Although Hoover recognizes
white support as vital, he thinks
that the problems of black
Americans can be solved only
with black owned and operated
institutions like Nairobi College
which provide a means by which
blacks can raise themselves. "If
we're going to solve the problem,
we must let blacks solve the
problem, first through leadership
along our own guidelines. But we
must be realistic —the black
community is bankrupt. We must
have white support."
Robert Hoover believes that
able leadership from the adult
population on the Peninsula has
resulted in blacks in the area
having more influence and control
over their lives than any other
blacks in the country.
Consequently, black people here
have built rather than destroyed.
Nairobi College is his best
example.


NAIROBI HEADQUARTERS— A small frame house is all thai Nairobi College
has for its main office. Classes meet in homes, garages, and churches in East Palo
Alto, and there are tentative plans for a new building if federal funds are
approved.


NAIROBI DIRECTOR—Robert Hoover, president of Nairobi College, talks with
