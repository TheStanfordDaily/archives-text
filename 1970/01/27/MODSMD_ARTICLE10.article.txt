## Whose Children? 
### Sara Wolfe 
When I sat at the "child care
table" on registration day, I got
many interesting responses from
students hurrying into the
Pavillion. Many passers-by
stopped to rap about their
situation and their kids. They
understood from personal
experience the need for child care
programs at Stanford. They signed
up to help organize such
programs. Another student, who
carried his kid on his back,
stopped to look at the leaflet that
told about the existing child care
program on campus. "That's cool,
he said, "where is this place?"
Another student on the run
grabbed a leaflet. Assuming all his
problems were solved, he called
back over his shoulder, "Oh,
good, this is just what my wife
needs—a place for the kids."
The Stanford Community
Children's Center is presently
caring for some 35 children on a
partial or full-day basis. The
program is happening in large part
because temporary space has been
donated for the school year,
because parents and
student-volunteers help staff the
Center keeping operating expenses
to a minimum, and because the
program is sponsored by a
Stanford professor. The center
will not have a building in June,
and there will be many details to
contend with in order to insure
permanent day care centers on
campus. The parents—a group of
Escondido people and SLAC
employees—began the program on
their own because they needed
child care badly, and they
believed a pilot project could cail
forth community attention and
efforts. Together with student
volunteers and one full-time
teacher, these parents have
created a program that
temporarily meets their needs.
They are anxious to work with
other interested people in the
Stanford community to organize
permanent child care facilities and
programs, (see Daily, Wed., 21st,

article by Glenda Jones) A
meeting Monday night, January
26th at Tresidder Union will
consider the many aspects of child
care at Stanford.
Unacceptable Alternatives
Another response I got while
sitting.at the table on reg day was,
"Whose children? Doesn't the
Bing Nursery school take care of
pre- schoolers? And most
Escondido mothers take turns
babysitting." The adequacy of
Bing Nursery is not the
issue—nursery school is not day
care service. At most, a
pre-schooler attends Bing Nursery
three V2 days per week. 1) This
program cannot meet the needs of
women graduate students who
must have more comprehensive
care for their children so they can
maintain their standing as
full-time students. 2) A three day
per week program does not serve
Stanford employees who work a
40 hour week. Employees cannot
take time off to transport children
from one place to another during
the day; they are forced to live
the* furthest from campus; and
their salaries do not permit
expensive private nursery/school
programs. 3) Wives of graduate
students often need fuller care for
their children than nursery
schools provide. Many desire
part-time wofk to support their
husbands, but have a difficult
time getting child care. The few
federally supported centers have
waiting lists and iry to admit the
most urgent cases.
Babysitters
All these mothers in the
Stanford community are forced to
resort to babysitters. A
babysitter-no matter how good—
cannot give a child the
educational and emotional
experiences which he receives in a
group situation. A well-planned,
on-going child care program
provides an environment where
children can learn from one
another and from other adults.
Secondly, babysitters are not

always dependable. They may
move from the area or get sick—in
such case the mother must stay
home from her job or classes until
she can get sitter service again.
The expense of a private sitter is a
burden which prohibits
student-parents from spending all
the time they might need to at the
library, etc. In the case of many
Stanford employees where both
husband and wife work, a large
percent of their income is paid to
sitters. "This is very discouraging
when the wife originally sought
employment to add to the family
income.
How Many Kids?
How many parents in the
Stanford community would use
campus centers? At present there
is no comprehensive data to
answer that question. It is
impossible to predict how many
women might use the centers so
they could continue their
education or take on jobs.
Full-day service on a year-round
basis at low costs would be
attractive to Stanford employees
who spent large amounts of their
salaries for babysitters. These are
important factors to keep in
mind.
To return to my inquisitor's
question "whote children?", I can
only say there are many women
students and employees whose
children need child care ... I have
no exact count. Perhpas if all the
employees, students, and faculty
at Stanford who depend on sitters
and private child care were to
bring their children to campus for
one day, the university
community might know "whose
children", and might hear the
parent's plea for child care.
