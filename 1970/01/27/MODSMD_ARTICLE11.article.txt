## The 						Yale Case-IV 
### John Arthur 
The absurd struggle between the National
Collegiate Athletic Association and the Amateur
Athletic Union over control of amateur athletics in
the U.S. has had several repercussions. It has made
the two organizations look like immature, selfish
governing bodies more concerned with their own
power than with the rights of the athletes they
purport to be protecting from professionalism.
And it has in more than one instance caused the
associations to rule counter to the interests ol the
athletes.
The recent two-year probation of Yale by the
NCAA is a case in point. Irritated that the rival
AAU had gained control of the U.S. end of Israel's
Maccabiah games, and jealous of its control over
college basketball players, the NCAA has refused
to sanction those games. When Yale University,
recognizing the idiocy of the non-sanction, went
ahead and told one of its players, reserve center
Jack Langer, that he could play, and then defied a
NCAA ban by continuing to play him during the
regular season, the NCAA hit the Elis with a stiff
two year probation from championship
competition in all sports and a ban on collecting
fees from the NCAA's television contract with
ABC-TV. (This latter penalty, by the way, could
cost Yale up to $1 50,000 in TV money.)
The Freeman Case
Outrageous as this incident may seem, it is not
the first time the NCAA has overreacted, to the
disadvantage of an athlete. In 1965 two trackmen,
Gerry Lindgren of Washington State and Tom
Farrell of St. John's were threatened with NCAA
punishment for competing against Russia for the
U.S. on an AAU team. The threat of congressional
investigation convinced the NCAA to back down.
Last fall an Oregon State senior was suspended by
the NCAA for participating in a seniors vs. alumni
basketball game at his high school in Idaho. Only
after vehement response on the part of Oregon
newspapers and citizens did the association rescind
its decision and permit 6'9" forward Gary
Freeman to play.
The Freeman case is interesting because it
appears to parallel the Yale-Langer case. In both
instances the NCAA made an unpopular decision
after a basketball player competed in out-of-season
competition not sanctioned by the association. In
the Freeman case, the NCAA changed its mind.
What are the chances of this happening with Yale?
Harry M. Cross is a law professor at the
University of Washington and President of the
NCAA. He is also Chairman and an ex-officio
member of the NCAA Council, the body which
enacted the Yale probation. In a recent telephone
interview with the Daily Cross pointed out how
the Yale case and the Freeman case differ.
"Freeman had played in an out of season game
and the ruling was that his playing had made him
ineligible," Cross said. "Oregon State declared him
ineligible, then made its appeal. In rulings of this
sort there is no time limit placed on the period of
ineligibility. Since OSU made a good case (by
stressing that the infraction had been
unintentional -ed.) and since the Council felt that
a sufficient period of time had elapsed, the
Council was willing to shorten his ineligibility."
(Freeman was put back on the team after missing
four games.)
Cross cited two important differences in the
cases. For one, the infraction by Freeman was
unintentional. Yale's was deliberate. Secondly,
OSU took the step of declaring Freeman ineligible
while Yale has not only kept Langer on the team
but has said that it will play him this year and
next.
Yale's chances for appeal hinge on any new
development in the case. Cross pointed out that
NCAA enforcement procedure holds that there is
no appeal "in the normal sense." As an example,
Cross hypothesized that the Eastern College
Athletic Association, in its upcoming annual

meeting, were to tell Yale to declare Langer
ineligible or face expulsion from the ECAC, and
Yale then yielded, this action would constitute
"new evidence" and Yale might be able to appeal
its probation.
Based on Yale's recent statements, there
appears to be about as much chance of the Elis
backing down as there is of the NCAA and the
AAU making up all their differences and issuing a
joint announcement that they will work together
forever to insure the best conditions for their
athletes.
Like none.
Their action in these and other cases has not
made for a history of sweetness and light for the
NCAA and its executive director, Walter Byers.
The association has been accused of anti-Semitism
in the wake of the Langer case, forcing Byers to
deny those charges in an editorial in the monthly
NCAA News. In the same January issue, Byers
reiterates his stand on militant black athletes, a
position which caused an uproar when it appeared
late last year. At that time, Byers had written that
a conspiracy of black athletes was out to wreck
the structure of college sports nationwide.
Legal Action
In addition, the NCAA now faces possible legal
action on several fronts in the wake of recent
rulings. The Yale probation has prompted Illinois
Representative Robert H. Michel to say that he
will ask for a congressional investigation of the
association to "find out what makes this
organization tick." Michel has two sons at Yale,
one of whom is a starter on the basketball team.
Yale, meanwhile, has threatened to go to court
against the ECAC, an affiliate of the NCAA,
should the ECAC punish them. And if the ECAC
decides to expel Yale, chances are that the rest of
the Ivy League schools would leave, too.
Finally, the recent NCAA suspension of San
Jose State's national champion track team has
drawn the threat of a suit from SJS acting
president Hobart W. Burns. Burns is incensed
because the one-year suspension appears to have
been leveled solely against the Spartans, who were
not alone in participating in a meet the NCAA
later decided was "uncertified." Burns says the
particulars of the case, and the NCAA News article
on black athletes, has led him to believe that the
association is still incensed about John Carlos'
raised-fist gesture at the 1968 Olympics and is
using the track technicality to further punish the
Spartans.

NCAA. He is also Chairman and an ex-officio
member of the NCAA Council, the body which
enacted the Yale probation. In a recent telephone
interview with the Daily Cross pointed out how
the Yale case and the Freeman case differ.
"Freeman had played in an out of season game
and the ruling was that his playing had made him
ineligible," Cross said. "Oregon State declared him
ineligible, then made its appeal. In rulings of this
sort there is no time limit placed on the period of
ineligibility. Since OSU made a good case (by
stressing that the infraction had been
unintentional -ed.) and since the Council felt that
a sufficient period of time had elapsed, the
Council was willing to shorten his ineligibility."
(Freeman was put back on the team after missing
four games.)
Cross cited two important differences in the
cases. For one, the infraction by Freeman was
unintentional. Yale's was deliberate. Secondly,
OSU took the step of declaring Freeman ineligible
while Yale has not only kept Langer on the team
but has said that it will play him this year and
next.
Yale's chances for appeal hinge on any new
development in the case. Cross pointed out that
NCAA enforcement procedure holds that there is
no appeal "in the normal sense." As an example,
Cross hypothesized that the Eastern College
Athletic Association, in its upcoming annual

meeting, were to tell Yale to declare Langer
ineligible or face expulsion from the ECAC, and
Yale then yielded, this action would constitute
"new evidence" and Yale might be able to appeal
its probation.
Based on Yale's recent statements, there
appears to be about as much chance of the Elis
backing down as there is of the NCAA and the
AAU making up all their differences and issuing a
joint announcement that they will work together
forever to insure the best conditions for their
athletes.
Like none.
Their action in these and other cases has not
made for a history of sweetness and light for the
NCAA and its executive director, Walter Byers.
The association has been accused of anti-Semitism
in the wake of the Langer case, forcing Byers to
deny those charges in an editorial in the monthly
NCAA News. In the same January issue, Byers
reiterates his stand on militant black athletes, a
position which caused an uproar when it appeared
late last year. At that time, Byers had written that
a conspiracy of black athletes was out to wreck
the structure of college sports nationwide.
Legal Action
In addition, the NCAA now faces possible legal
action on several fronts in the wake of recent
rulings. The Yale probation has prompted Illinois
Representative Robert H. Michel to say that he
will ask for a congressional investigation of the
association to "find out what makes this
organization tick." Michel has two sons at Yale,
one of whom is a starter on the basketball team.
Yale, meanwhile, has threatened to go to court
against the ECAC, an affiliate of the NCAA,
should the ECAC punish them. And if the ECAC
decides to expel Yale, chances are that the rest of
the Ivy League schools would leave, too.
Finally, the recent NCAA suspension of San
Jose State's national champion track team has
drawn the threat of a suit from SJS acting
president Hobart W. Burns. Burns is incensed
because the one-year suspension appears to have
been leveled solely against the Spartans, who were
not alone in participating in a meet the NCAA
later decided was "uncertified." Burns says the
particulars of the case, and the NCAA News article
on black athletes, has led him to believe that the
association is still incensed about John Carlos'
raised-fist gesture at the 1968 Olympics and is
using the track technicality to further punish the
Spartans.
(Next: the lessons of the Yale case and some
conclusions about the NCAA)
The absurd struggle between the National
Collegiate Athletic Association and the Amateur
Athletic Union over control of amateur athletics in
the U.S. has had several repercussions. It has made
the two organizations look like immature, selfish
governing bodies more concerned with their own
power than with the rights of the athletes they
purport to be protecting from professionalism.
And it has in more than one instance caused the
associations to rule counter to the interests ol the
athletes.
The recent two-year probation of Yale by the
NCAA is a case in point. Irritated that the rival
AAU had gained control of the U.S. end of Israel's
Maccabiah games, and jealous of its control over
college basketball players, the NCAA has refused
to sanction those games. When Yale University,
recognizing the idiocy of the non-sanction, went
ahead and told one of its players, reserve center
Jack Langer, that he could play, and then defied a
NCAA ban by continuing to play him during the
regular season, the NCAA hit the Elis with a stiff
two year probation from championship
competition in all sports and a ban on collecting
fees from the NCAA's television contract with
ABC-TV. (This latter penalty, by the way, could
cost Yale up to $1 50,000 in TV money.)
The Freeman Case
Outrageous as this incident may seem, it is not
the first time the NCAA has overreacted, to the
disadvantage of an athlete. In 1965 two trackmen,
Gerry Lindgren of Washington State and Tom
Farrell of St. John's were threatened with NCAA
punishment for competing against Russia for the
U.S. on an AAU team. The threat of congressional
investigation convinced the NCAA to back down.
Last fall an Oregon State senior was suspended by
the NCAA for participating in a seniors vs. alumni
basketball game at his high school in Idaho. Only
after vehement response on the part of Oregon
newspapers and citizens did the association rescind
its decision and permit 6'9" forward Gary
Freeman to play.
The Freeman case is interesting because it
appears to parallel the Yale-Langer case. In both
instances the NCAA made an unpopular decision
after a basketball player competed in out-of-season
competition not sanctioned by the association. In
the Freeman case, the NCAA changed its mind.

In addition, the NCAA now faces possible legal
action on several fronts in the wake of recent
rulings. The Yale probation has prompted Illinois
Representative Robert H. Michel to say that he
will ask for a congressional investigation of the
association to "find out what makes this
organization tick." Michel has two sons at Yale,
one of whom is a starter on the basketball team.
Yale, meanwhile, has threatened to go to court
against the ECAC, an affiliate of the NCAA,
should the ECAC punish them. And if the ECAC
decides to expel Yale, chances are that the rest of
the Ivy League schools would leave, too.
Finally, the recent NCAA suspension of San
Jose State's national champion track team has
drawn the threat of a suit from SJS acting
president Hobart W. Burns. Burns is incensed
because the one-year suspension appears to have
been leveled solely against the Spartans, who were
not alone in participating in a meet the NCAA
later decided was "uncertified." Burns says the
particulars of the case, and the NCAA News article
on black athletes, has led him to believe that the
association is still incensed about John Carlos'
raised-fist gesture at the 1968 Olympics and is
using the track technicality to further punish the
Spartans.
(Next: the lessons of the Yale case and some
conclusions about the NCAA)
The absurd struggle between the National
Collegiate Athletic Association and the Amateur
Athletic Union over control of amateur athletics in
the U.S. has had several repercussions. It has made
the two organizations look like immature, selfish
governing bodies more concerned with their own
power than with the rights of the athletes they
purport to be protecting from professionalism.
And it has in more than one instance caused the
associations to rule counter to the interests ol the
athletes.
The recent two-year probation of Yale by the
NCAA is a case in point. Irritated that the rival
AAU had gained control of the U.S. end of Israel's
Maccabiah games, and jealous of its control over
college basketball players, the NCAA has refused
to sanction those games. When Yale University,
recognizing the idiocy of the non-sanction, went
ahead and told one of its players, reserve center
Jack Langer, that he could play, and then defied a
NCAA ban by continuing to play him during the
regular season, the NCAA hit the Elis with a stiff
two year probation from championship
competition in all sports and a ban on collecting
fees from the NCAA's television contract with
ABC-TV. (This latter penalty, by the way, could
cost Yale up to $1 50,000 in TV money.)
The Freeman Case
Outrageous as this incident may seem, it is not
the first time the NCAA has overreacted, to the
disadvantage of an athlete. In 1965 two trackmen,
Gerry Lindgren of Washington State and Tom
Farrell of St. John's were threatened with NCAA
punishment for competing against Russia for the
U.S. on an AAU team. The threat of congressional
investigation convinced the NCAA to back down.
Last fall an Oregon State senior was suspended by
the NCAA for participating in a seniors vs. alumni
basketball game at his high school in Idaho. Only
after vehement response on the part of Oregon
newspapers and citizens did the association rescind
its decision and permit 6'9" forward Gary
Freeman to play.
The Freeman case is interesting because it
appears to parallel the Yale-Langer case. In both
instances the NCAA made an unpopular decision
after a basketball player competed in out-of-season
competition not sanctioned by the association. In
the Freeman case, the NCAA changed its mind.
What are the chances of this happening with Yale?
Harry M. Cross is a law professor at the
University of Washington and President of the
NCAA. He is also Chairman and an ex-officio
member of the NCAA Council, the body which
enacted the Yale probation. In a recent telephone
interview with the Daily Cross pointed out how
the Yale case and the Freeman case differ.
"Freeman had played in an out of season game
and the ruling was that his playing had made him
ineligible," Cross said. "Oregon State declared him
ineligible, then made its appeal. In rulings of this
sort there is no time limit placed on the period of
ineligibility. Since OSU made a good case (by
stressing that the infraction had been
unintentional -ed.) and since the Council felt that
a sufficient period of time had elapsed, the
Council was willing to shorten his ineligibility."
(Freeman was put back on the team after missing
four games.)
Cross cited two important differences in the
cases. For one, the infraction by Freeman was
unintentional. Yale's was deliberate. Secondly,
OSU took the step of declaring Freeman ineligible
while Yale has not only kept Langer on the team
but has said that it will play him this year and
next.
Yale's chances for appeal hinge on any new
development in the case. Cross pointed out that
NCAA enforcement procedure holds that there is
no appeal "in the normal sense." As an example,
Cross hypothesized that the Eastern College
Athletic Association, in its upcoming annual

meeting, were to tell Yale to declare Langer
ineligible or face expulsion from the ECAC, and
Yale then yielded, this action would constitute
"new evidence" and Yale might be able to appeal
its probation.
Based on Yale's recent statements, there
appears to be about as much chance of the Elis
backing down as there is of the NCAA and the
AAU making up all their differences and issuing a
joint announcement that they will work together
forever to insure the best conditions for their
athletes.
Like none.
Their action in these and other cases has not
made for a history of sweetness and light for the
NCAA and its executive director, Walter Byers.
The association has been accused of anti-Semitism
in the wake of the Langer case, forcing Byers to
deny those charges in an editorial in the monthly
NCAA News. In the same January issue, Byers
reiterates his stand on militant black athletes, a
position which caused an uproar when it appeared
late last year. At that time, Byers had written that
a conspiracy of black athletes was out to wreck
the structure of college sports nationwide.
