# Gymnasts Beaten
## 
### 
Stanford gymnasts were beset
with two "bad breaks" late last
week, the first being a knee
dislocation to Murray Kephart
and the second a 1 12.30-134.70
loss to UC-Santa Barbara Saturday
night.
Kephart did not compete but
should be ready for Stanford's
next encounter, a home meet Feb.
14 with Washington and San Jose
State.
Coach Dan Millman was
surprised by the loss but, he said,
he hadn't ruled out the possibility
of a win, either.
"Adrenalin is a big part of

gymnastics," he said at practice
Monday, "and it's normal to be a
little down for an away meet with
an 'away' crowd. With more work
we'll get better performances even
when we're down."
Rich Jerome highlighted the
Stanford effort by winning the
all-around competition with a
46.80 score for all six events. His
best score was an 8.95 on the long
horse, followed by an 8.45 on the
parallel bars and an 8.3 on the
rings.
Steve Rochell won the rings
competition with an 8.7 and tied
for first with Jerome on the
parallel bars at 8.45.

ONE MORE TIME â€” Here it is fans, the picture you didn't see on this page yesterday morning. Those kids were
entertaining the customers during half-time of Saturday night's Stanford-Air Eorce game.
