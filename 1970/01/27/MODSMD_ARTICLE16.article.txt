# New Human Biology Program To Begin
## 
### FRED SHARKEY 
With the problems of
population, pollution, and
conservation of vital resources
looming before us, Stanford has
now developed a program in
human biology to help meet the
need for trained personnel in this
area.
This new undergraduate
program, which is both
interschool and interdepartmen
tal, has been designed to help man
in relation to his environment by
means of both the biological and
behavioral sciences.
The program as it is now set up
will offer an A.B. in human
biology with the fundamental
program consisting of nine
required one quarter courses.
These courses will provide both a
knowledge of biology, especially
of man, and the knowledge of
behavioral sciences.
The effort will be "to reinfuse
the other human sciences,
psychology, sociology,
anthropology, politics, history,
and economics, with some of the
biological components of human
nature."
At the present time there is no
graduate program in human
biology. However, students who
major in human biology will be
able to take advanced training in
biology, behavioral science, or
medicine depending on the
courses taken after completion of
the fundamental program.
The Bachelor of Arts degree
will require about 65 units, 35 of
which will come from the
fundamental program. The

fundamental program will cover
the University area requirements
in the social and the natural
sciences.
Some of the various courses
now included in the fundamental
program are "Man and Nature,"
concerned with broad outlines of
the origin and history of life;
"Behavior as Adaptation," a look
at man's survival requirements as a
biological organism; and"The
Transformation of Human
Society," exploring the effects of
present environmental changes.
The curriculum of advanced
courses has not yet been
completed. However, it is
expected that at least six
advanced courses will be taken in
the fields related to the biological,
social, or physical aspects of
human biology.
More information on the
program and its courses may be
obtained in room 5228 of the
Medical School.
