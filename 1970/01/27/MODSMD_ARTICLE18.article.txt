# Big Brother, Mussel white, Here Friday
## 
### 
Big Brother and the Holding
Company will perform Friday
night in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Appearing with them will be the
Charlie Musselwhite Blues Band.
Tickets, $2.25 for students and
$3.25 for others, are on sale at the
Tressidder Box Office, Discount
Records, and at the door.
Big Brother, sans Janis Joplin,
will also appear at the Poppycock
twice this month.
Charlie Musselwhite, not as
well known as the Big Brother
group, is a strong proponent of
the "good old Memphis Blues."
Growing up in Mississippi, he was
exposed early to the
country-western and
"rockability" styles.
With guitar and harmonica,
Musselwhite listened and learned
from the veterans like Furry
Lewis and Will Shade, Gus
Cannon, and Milton "Red" Robie
of Memphis Jug Band Fame.
In 1962, he hit Chicago, and
soon developed a wide reputation
and became known to virtually
every blues musician as an honest
singer who put his songs, not
himself, first.
O
Though Charlie started his
blues career with a guitar, he has
slowly evolved into a harmonica
man. He has recorded three
albums, all on the Vanguard label.
