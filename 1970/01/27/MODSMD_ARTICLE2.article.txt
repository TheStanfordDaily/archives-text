# Protesters To Keep Draft Deferments
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court ruled 6 to 2
yesterday that draft boards
cannot take a college student's
deferment away because he
turned in iiis draft card to protest
the Vietnam war.
Justice Hugo L. Black said
neither the President nor local
boards can set conditions for
student deferments that are not in
the 1967 draft law.
Black, speaking for the
majority, said Congress intended
to spare students from induction
as long as they remained students.
There is no indication in the law,
he said, that the deferment can be
taken away because the registrant
failed to keep his draft card.
Last week the court ruled 5 to
3 that draft boards cannot
accelerate the induction of war
protesters already in 1A as
punishment for giving up their
draft cards.
Monday's decision prohibits the
reclassification of 1A students
or any other men Congress
intended to protect from military
service.
Together, the rulings mean
protesters cannot be called up
solely in the judgment of their
boards that they are
"delinquents." Both rulings went
against the Justice Department
and the Selective Service system
Dru<* Control
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Republican leaders in the Senate
moved swiftly Monday to cut the
ground from under senators trying
to scuttle part of a drug-control
bill allowing police to stage
no-warning narcotics raids.
Assistant Republican Leader
Robert P. Griffin, of Michigan
acted to save the section following
a day of sometimes stormy debate
in which senators argued such
raids would be unconstitutional
and destructive of basic American
liberties.
He offered an amendment to
make federal warrants authorizing
no-warning raids more difficult to
get by requiring agents to provide
proof that evidence they seek is
likely to be destroyed unless a
raid is conducted suddenly and
without warning.
The Griffin amendment is
expected to relieve the doubts
many senators said they had of
the provision's constitutionality.
His move delayed until Tuesday a
vote on any amendment.
Oil Protest
SANTA BARBARA (AP) - A
Declaration of Environmental
Rights will be read tomorrow at
an antipollution conference here
on the first anniversary of the
undersea oil well blowup that
blackened the city's white
beaches.
The declaration says, "All men
have the right to an environment
capable of sustaining life and
promoting happiness." It proposes
"a revolution in conduct toward
an environment which is rising in
revolt against us."
It was Jan. 28, 1969, that an
offshore drilling platform sprang a
leak that coated 800 square miles
of ocean, blackened 40 miles of
beach and killed hundreds of sea
birds before it was checked.

Several barrels of oil still
surface daily at the platform.
During the past year, residents
of this scenic resort city have
campaigned unsuccessfully for a
halt to offshore drilling and
pumping.
Biafra
LAGOS' Nigeria (AP) â€” A special
emissary of U.N. Secretary-Gen
eral U Thant reported Monday
that bloodshed and violence soon
will end in fallen Biafra but
malnutrition, poverty and death
will remain a cause for alarm
Said Udden Khan, a retired
brigadier from Pakistan, called for
a major effort by volunteer and
government agencies.
Khan's report said, a large
number of refugees are
"completely destitute. They are
undernourished and without
money or even seedlings to plant
their crops," Khan said. "A major
effort of relief and rehabilitation
will be required."
Black Panthers
ATLANTA Ga. (AP) - Mayor
Sam Yorty of Los Angeles
yesterday described news coverage
of the recent raid on a Black
Panther headquarters in his city as
"totally distorted and unfair."
Yorty told a Southeastern
Poultry and Egg Association
conference that recent Supreme
Court rulings tipped the "scale to
the side of the criminals."
Yorty charged the Panther raid
uncovered a marxist-Lenin library
and piles of Chinese Communist
literature and asked, "Why didn't
the news media include this in
their accounts?"
Americans ought to stop
berating themselves, Yorty said.
"Some 96 million people in
this country didn't commit
criminal acts, five million students
didn't riot on campus, 200 million
didn't take illegal drugs and 1,700
baby doctors didn't condemn the
draft process," he said.
