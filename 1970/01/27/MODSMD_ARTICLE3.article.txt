# Student 'Unbeliefs'
## 
### 
An intense search for personal
belief often lies behind student
demands for political equality on
campus, declared Prof. Walter P.
Metzger of Columbia to an
informal conference of sixty
student's, faculty, and
administrator s Saturday.
"Above the clamor for
equality, I hear the cry 'help me,
I'm tired of my unbeliefs,
Metzger said.
"American coiioges could be
considered 2,000 purring
escalators, escalating individuals
and groups upward in society," he
noted. "Black students aT saying
'how about making that machine
work for us. Don't accuse us of
twisting universities out of
shape.
Academic institutions innovate
most easily through addition, he
added. "It's impossible to tell
what knowledge is not necessary."
But if the current financial
squeeze on colleges tightens, "we
may have to go to innovation by
substitution â€”then comes the
crunch."
Commenting on student
demands for political power and

classroom equality on campus,
Metzger emphasized that
universities primarily are
institutions of learning, not
governance. "We'll not regain the
essence of what we've lost
through Senates," he declared.
The senior member of the
American Association of
University Professors committee
on tenure, he noted that "where
tenure is not secure, you get petty
administrative tyranny. When you
fire a professor you may get an
equally good but more docde
man."
Internally, "tenure reduces the
stake you have in disagreements"
with fellow faculty members and
others in the community,
providing a little cohesiveness
even in times of deep controversy.
Externally, it provides protection
for unconventional and unpopular
ideas.
On another point he urged his
audience to "innovate for its own
sake, even with lousy ideas. Don't
aim for the perpetuation (of every
innovation); just insert into
routinized lives the psychic lift
you get from innovation."
