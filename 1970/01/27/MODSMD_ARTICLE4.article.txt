# Nixon Vetoes Education Bill As 'Inflationary'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon made history last night
when he vetoed a $19.7-billion
education and health
appropriation bill before
nationwide television audience,
assuring a major collision with the
Democratic-controlled Congress.
Nixon said he vetoed the
measure because "it is the wrong

amount for the wrong prupose
and at the wrong time."
But it was obvious that his
arguments had little impact on
Democratic congressional leaders
or on educators who are swarming
into the capital in an effort to
convince Congress it should
override the veto.
Rep. Carl D. Perkins, Kentucky

Democrat and a chief architect of
the vetoed bill, said Nixon's
argument that the veto fights
inflation is unsound and
discredited an argument sure to be
echoed in the forthcoming floor
fight, along with claims that
educational needs deserve
priority.
Republican leaders predictably
hailed the veto action as they
intensified efforts to hold their
party lines and sustain the
President's action.
Stanford Comments
Prof. George Bach, professor of
economics said "On the inflation
issue he is right. Increased federal
spending does fuel inflation. The
issue is whether or not these
expenditures (HEW) should be cut
first. If I was doing it, I'd cut
some other areas first."
Kenneth Cuthbertson,
Vice-President for Finance
commented, "I'm disappointed
that he vetoed it in light of other
actions that he has recommended
in the past that are just as
inflationary.
"I'm concerned about the
health measures that will be lost
by this veto.
''I think frankly it's
unfortunate that the inflation
argument had to be leveled when
health and education was at
stake."
First Veto
It was Nixon's first presidential
veto, and the way he did it was
unprecedented.
After an 11-minute broadcast
report to the nation, he picked up
his pen and signed the veto
message before the television
cameras.
The bill carries $6.26 billion
more than Nixon's budget
recommendations, most of it for
education aid and for health
research.
"Spend Ourselves Poor"
With the test coming up, Nixon
went on live radio and television
to warn that "we can spend
ourselves poor."
"That is why," he said in a
prepared text, "no matter how
popular a spending program is, if I
determine that its enactment will
have the effect of raising your
prices or your taxes-I will not
approve that program."
The President' contended his
action would be in the long-range
interest of better health and
education programs.
"Above all," he said, "it is in
the vital interest of all Americans
in stopping the rise in the cost of
living."
Earlier in the day presidential
press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
told newsmen the White House is
confident, on the basis of its
soundings, that the House will not
vote to override the veto which is
to be sent to it Tuesday.
