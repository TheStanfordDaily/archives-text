# Director Criticized
## Overseas Campus Controversy 
### BARRY ASKINAS 
(Editor's note: The following is
the first of several articles which
will explore in depth the
development and future of the
Stanford Overseas Campuses
program. Barry Askinas, graduate
student in sociology and Council
of Presidents member, is leading
the Daily task force that is
examining the controversial
program.)
No academic program outside
of Freshman English affects more
Stanford undergraduates than the
Overseas Campuses. For a decade,
no program has generated more
controversy, more petitions, and
more student-faculty protests.
Much time and energy have often

been expended to achieve rather
meager changes.
No one aspect of the program
draws more fire than Dr. Robert
Walker, Director of Overseas
Campuses. For a decade, no
program has generated more
controversy, more petitions, and
more student-faculty protests.
Much time and energy have often
been expended to achieve rather
meager changes.
No one aspect of the program
draws more fire than Dr. Robert
Walker, Director of Overseas
Campuses. He is both revered and
damned, with all responsibility for
the program's shortcomings
heaped on his shoulders.
Almost everyone is unanimous
in lauding his administrative
abilities (although one professor
referred to his so-called abilities as
a "myth") and he still receives
praise for setting up the model
campus in Germany in 1958.
One member of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
committee that looked at the
foreign studies operation in depth
called Walker's input in the
beginning "fantastic! He can't be
given enough credit for the role he
played at the start."
Yet there is growing sentiment
in the University that as long as
Walker remains in his present
position as Director, he stands in
the way of implementing both the
central ideas of the SES Report
on Foreign Studies and the policy
recommendations of the new
faculty Senate Committee on
Foreign Studies, chaired by
Sociology Prof. Morris Zelditch,
Jr.
Remove individual
One Dean, in commenting on
the situation, claimed there is no
reason to assume administrators
have tenure. "If an individual is all
that stands in the way of
implementing an entire SES
report, then you don't have to
change the entire administrative
structure. You simply remove the
individual."

As one student put it, "Dr.
Walker is not noted for his
flexibility."
Despite much unrest about the
program's administrator,
Stanford's foreign studies program
is regarded as the best American
university overseas operation. The
program began in 1958 with a
single location in a rural setting
near Stuttgart, Germany.
Speci.il Centers Planned
Since that time, campuses have
been established in Italy (1960),
France (1960), Austria (1965),
and England (1966). Three special
programs for language majors also
draw Stanford students to
Europe, with plans for other such
special study centers in various
stages of development.
The sites in both Austria and
England have been moved
recently from relatively rural to
more urban settings. The English
campus is now just outside
London and Austria's is in the
heart of downtown Vienna.
Almost 60 percent of Stanford's
undergraduates now participate.
The key recommendation of
the SES Report was to
decentralize and individualize the
five campus programs.
"Standardization was the thing,"
according to one member of the
SES committee "that was
educationally objectionable.
Robert Walker's conception of the
program then and now is in
opposition to that view.
Countries Interchangeable
"The Overseas Campus Office
regards each country as more or
less the same and students and
faculty as interchangeable. If you
don't get to go to Germany,
which you applied for, maybe
you'll get to go to France."
At Stanford, the program
served as a model for the
development of coeducational
housing. Many students look back
on their six months abroad as the
most meaningful or educational
part of their Stanford years.

But as one recent returnee said,
"Rather than setting the pace, the
program has fallen behind the rest
of the university in change and
innovation. Some courses are dull
or simple-minded, rules are
enforced overseas which are
inoperative at the home campus,
and judicial procedures for the
violator are archaic and sometimes
arbitrarily used by the
administration."
Tied To General Studies
The program as it developed
was closely tied to the notion of
General Studies. Last year the
Academic Senate in principle
abolished the General Studies
Program, which Dr. Walker also
headed. The two unresolved
questions which SES implicitly
raised but did not explicitly
answer are (1) whether all or only
some students should go abroad
and (2) whether each campus
should largely revolve around
general education courses or be a
center in which to pursue one or
more areas of study intensively.
For example, recommenda
tions have been put forth that the
Florence campus might become a
center to study Art or
Renaissance History. The British
campus might focus on English
Studies or on Drama.
SES did not imply that all
campuses should be specialized or
that a campus could not be used
simultaneously both as a center
for intensive study of some topic,
and as a center where courses of
general interest are taught.
As Associate Provost
Rosenzweig observed, "We should
take advantage of the fact that we
now have five overseas campuses
with 10 separate groups of
students each year ..to
accumulate experience in a variety
of approaches so that 10 years
from now we are not still arguing
the wisdom of sending
sophomores rather than juniors,
of independent study rather than
course work, and of specialization
rather than general education."

the SES Report was to
decentralize and individualize the
five campus programs.
"Standardization was the thing,"
according to one member of the
SES committee "that was
educationally objectionable.
Robert Walker's conception of the
program then and now is in
opposition to that view.
Countries Interchangeable
"The Overseas Campus Office
regards each country as more or
less the same and students and
faculty as interchangeable. If you
don't get to go to Germany,
which you applied for, maybe
you'll get to go to France."
At Stanford, the program
served as a model for the
development of coeducational
housing. Many students look back
on their six months abroad as the
most meaningful or educational
part of their Stanford years.

But as one recent returnee said,
"Rather than setting the pace, the
program has fallen behind the rest
of the university in change and
innovation. Some courses are dull
or simple-minded, rules are
enforced overseas which are
inoperative at the home campus,
and judicial procedures for the
violator are archaic and sometimes
arbitrarily used by the
administration."
Tied To General Studies
The program as it developed
was closely tied to the notion of
General Studies. Last year the
Academic Senate in principle
abolished the General Studies
Program, which Dr. Walker also
headed. The two unresolved
questions which SES implicitly
raised but did not explicitly
answer are (1) whether all or only
some students should go abroad
and (2) whether each campus
should largely revolve around
general education courses or be a
center in which to pursue one or
more areas of study intensively.
For example, recommenda
tions have been put forth that the
Florence campus might become a
center to study Art or
Renaissance History. The British
campus might focus on English
Studies or on Drama.
SES did not imply that all
campuses should be specialized or
that a campus could not be used
simultaneously both as a center
for intensive study of some topic,
and as a center where courses of
general interest are taught.
As Associate Provost
Rosenzweig observed, "We should
take advantage of the fact that we
now have five overseas campuses
with 10 separate groups of
students each year ..to
accumulate experience in a variety
of approaches so that 10 years
from now we are not still arguing
the wisdom of sending
sophomores rather than juniors,
of independent study rather than
course work, and of specialization
rather than general education."

development and future of the
Stanford Overseas Campuses
program. Barry Askinas, graduate

program.)
No academic program outside
of Freshman English affects more
Stanford undergraduates than the
Overseas Campuses. For a decade,
no program has generated more
controversy, more petitions, and
more student-faculty protests.
Much time and energy have often

been expended to achieve rather
meager changes.
No one aspect of the program

Walker, Director of Overseas
Campuses. For a decade, no

No one aspect of the program
draws more fire than Dr. Robert
Walker, Director of Overseas
Campuses. He is both revered and
damned, with all responsibility for
the program's shortcomings
heaped on his shoulders.
Almost everyone is unanimous
in lauding his administrative
abilities (although one professor
referred to his so-called abilities as
a "myth") and he still receives
praise for setting up the model
campus in Germany in 1958.
One member of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
committee that looked at the
foreign studies operation in depth
called Walker's input in the
beginning "fantastic! He can't be
given enough credit for the role he
played at the start."
Yet there is growing sentiment
in the University that as long as
Walker remains in his present
position as Director, he stands in
the way of implementing both the
central ideas of the SES Report
on Foreign Studies and the policy
recommendations of the new
faculty Senate Committee on
Foreign Studies, chaired by
Sociology Prof. Morris Zelditch,
Jr.
Remove individual
One Dean, in commenting on
the situation, claimed there is no
reason to assume administrators
have tenure. "If an individual is all
that stands in the way of
implementing an entire SES
report, then you don't have to
change the entire administrative
structure. You simply remove the
individual."

As one student put it, "Dr.
Walker is not noted for his
flexibility."
Despite much unrest about the
program's administrator,
Stanford's foreign studies program
is regarded as the best American
university overseas operation. The
program began in 1958 with a
single location in a rural setting
near Stuttgart, Germany.
Speci.il Centers Planned
Since that time, campuses have
been established in Italy (1960),
France (1960), Austria (1965),
and England (1966). Three special
programs for language majors also
draw Stanford students to
Europe, with plans for other such
special study centers in various
stages of development.
The sites in both Austria and
England have been moved
recently from relatively rural to
more urban settings. The English
campus is now just outside
London and Austria's is in the
heart of downtown Vienna.
Almost 60 percent of Stanford's
undergraduates now participate.

been expended to achieve rather
meager changes.
No one aspect of the program
draws more fire than Dr. Robert
Walker, Director of Overseas
Campuses. He is both revered and
damned, with all responsibility for
the program's shortcomings
heaped on his shoulders.
Almost everyone is unanimous
in lauding his administrative
abilities (although one professor
referred to his so-called abilities as
a "myth") and he still receives
praise for setting up the model
campus in Germany in 1958.
One member of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
committee that looked at the
foreign studies operation in depth
called Walker's input in the
beginning "fantastic! He can't be
given enough credit for the role he
played at the start."
Yet there is growing sentiment
in the University that as long as
Walker remains in his present
position as Director, he stands in
the way of implementing both the
central ideas of the SES Report
on Foreign Studies and the policy
recommendations of the new
faculty Senate Committee on
Foreign Studies, chaired by
Sociology Prof. Morris Zelditch,
Jr.
Remove individual
One Dean, in commenting on
the situation, claimed there is no
reason to assume administrators
have tenure. "If an individual is all
that stands in the way of
implementing an entire SES
report, then you don't have to
change the entire administrative
structure. You simply remove the
individual."

As one student put it, "Dr.
Walker is not noted for his
flexibility."
Despite much unrest about the
program's administrator,
Stanford's foreign studies program
is regarded as the best American
university overseas operation. The
program began in 1958 with a
single location in a rural setting
near Stuttgart, Germany.
Speci.il Centers Planned
Since that time, campuses have
been established in Italy (1960),
France (1960), Austria (1965),
and England (1966). Three special
programs for language majors also
draw Stanford students to
Europe, with plans for other such
special study centers in various
stages of development.
The sites in both Austria and
England have been moved
recently from relatively rural to
more urban settings. The English
campus is now just outside
London and Austria's is in the
heart of downtown Vienna.
Almost 60 percent of Stanford's
undergraduates now participate.
The key recommendation of
the SES Report was to
decentralize and individualize the
five campus programs.
"Standardization was the thing,"
according to one member of the
SES committee "that was
educationally objectionable.
Robert Walker's conception of the
program then and now is in
opposition to that view.
Countries Interchangeable
"The Overseas Campus Office
regards each country as more or
less the same and students and
faculty as interchangeable. If you
don't get to go to Germany,
which you applied for, maybe
you'll get to go to France."
At Stanford, the program
served as a model for the
development of coeducational
housing. Many students look back
on their six months abroad as the
most meaningful or educational
part of their Stanford years.

But as one recent returnee said,
"Rather than setting the pace, the
program has fallen behind the rest
of the university in change and
innovation. Some courses are dull
or simple-minded, rules are
enforced overseas which are
inoperative at the home campus,
and judicial procedures for the
violator are archaic and sometimes
arbitrarily used by the
administration."
Tied To General Studies
The program as it developed
was closely tied to the notion of
General Studies. Last year the
Academic Senate in principle
abolished the General Studies
Program, which Dr. Walker also
headed. The two unresolved
questions which SES implicitly
raised but did not explicitly
answer are (1) whether all or only
some students should go abroad
and (2) whether each campus
should largely revolve around
general education courses or be a
center in which to pursue one or
more areas of study intensively.
For example, recommenda
tions have been put forth that the
Florence campus might become a
center to study Art or
Renaissance History. The British
campus might focus on English
Studies or on Drama.
SES did not imply that all
campuses should be specialized or
that a campus could not be used
simultaneously both as a center
for intensive study of some topic,
and as a center where courses of
general interest are taught.
As Associate Provost
Rosenzweig observed, "We should
take advantage of the fact that we
now have five overseas campuses
with 10 separate groups of
students each year ..to
accumulate experience in a variety
of approaches so that 10 years
from now we are not still arguing
the wisdom of sending
sophomores rather than juniors,
of independent study rather than
course work, and of specialization
rather than general education."

the first of several articles which
will explore in depth the
development and future of the

program. Barry Askinas, graduate
student in sociology and Council
of Presidents member, is leading

examining the controversial
program.)
No academic program outside
of Freshman English affects more
