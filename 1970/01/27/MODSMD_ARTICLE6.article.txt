# 21st Century Education
## Parents Adoption 
### Vishist K. Vaid-Raizada 
The inadequacy of the
on-campus housing facilities has
long been felt. Not only is it
impressed that the housing
facilities are usually short of
demand but also that the type of
facilities available is not
satisfactory to the growing change
in the education process.
There are two great changes
expected in the 21st century
on-campus housing- the enormous
increase in the number of housing
units and a fundamental change in
the nature of residence houses.
The immense increase in the
housing units would give the
university a new look. At present
the most imposing structures on a
university campus are the
department buildings and the
libraries. They also consume most
of the land. The living units in
comparison are less evident or
obscure. The enormous increase in
the housing units would give the
21st century university the look
of a city or a town, the living
units forming the most numerous
and conspicious structures.
Seclusionist Dormitories
There would also be a great
change in the nature of the
housing facilities. The dormitory
system, which owes its origin to
the monastery, is perhaps ideal to
lead ascetic life. In the coming
century it would be a thing of the
past, even today it is considered
very old fashioned. The present
trend of mixing the sexes in the
dormitories is in fact an urge to
break the seclusionist atmosphere,
for which the dormitories were
primarily designed.
Most of the on-campus living
units in the next century would
be for families or married couples.
For the single students there
would be a new arrangement, the
parents adoption. Single students,
in small groups, would find it
convenient to adopt middle aged
or older couples and live in a
family type set up. The principal
reason for the establishment and
success of such an arrangement
would be the increased
consciousness and awareness,
which the young people mostly
spearhead. Universities would not
be the only places where such an
arrangement would exist. In fact
one would come across this family
organization of people of
different age groups, not related
by blood, living together, even
outside the universities, but at a
much smaller scale. The
universities would most probably
lead this trend and perhaps be the
show-pieces of this new awareness
and tolerance.
Parents Adoption Arrangement
The parents adoption
arrangement would be convenient
from many viewpoints. Most of
the adopted parents on campus
would be faculty members. Thus
it would be a good set up to mix
the students and teachers in an
informal family atmosphere. This
would have an effect of reducing
the generation gap which is so
miserable felt these days. This

would help the "established" and
the non-established to understand
each other and to appreciate each
others difficulties in a much
deeper and realistic manner.
Since the adopted parents
would be chosen freely (with no
obligations) and not forced by
nature, there seems a very high
likelihood that mutual relations
among this articifical family
would be firendly, cordial and
compassionate. Most often the
enforced relationship- enforced by
nature or man or both-brings in
the element of obligations, leading
to dis-harmony.
Communal Living
Alienation is a common
complaint these days, among the
young and the old alike. A part of
this alienation is self imposed,
because of lack of communal
living. It is becoming increasingly
difficult for people to have a joint
or communal living based on
blood relationship. One solution
to this problem of alienation is
the new concept of a family
whose members stick to each
other because of common likes.
The adopted parents arrangement
would provide a perfect solution
to the alienation among the single
university students.
The atmosphere in the adopted
parents residencial units would
without doubt be extremely
scholarly. With the growing trend
towards self-teaching and
individual curicullum, these small
residential units would provide
the nucleus for such a change. It
would be in these scholarly
residential units that self initiated
small seminars and discussion
sessious would take place.
Changing Coals
The existance of these small
scholarly residential units would
also be in line with the changing
goals of the university. A

university is no longer viewed as a
place which imparts knowledge,
enlightens and wisens but rather a
set up whose scholarly
atmosphere motivates towards self
learning and creativeness
(University of California, Santa
Cruz campus follows this
philosophy very rigidly). The
scholarly atmosphere in the small
parents adopted residences would
help breed the self-taught
intellects of highest order, with
Socratic wisdom, vision and
knowledge.
The change from the
centralized dormitory living of the
present to the small scattered
adopted parents residential units
would bring a great sense of relief
to the young scholars. One can
not help feeling that dormitory
living is more like a pigeon-hole
living. It certainly does not
provide a very graceful way for a
young scholar to live.

Most of the on-campus living
units in the next century would
be for families or married couples.
For the single students there
would be a new arrangement, the
parents adoption. Single students,
in small groups, would find it
convenient to adopt middle aged
or older couples and live in a
family type set up. The principal
reason for the establishment and
success of such an arrangement
would be the increased
consciousness and awareness,
which the young people mostly
spearhead. Universities would not
be the only places where such an
arrangement would exist. In fact
one would come across this family
organization of people of
different age groups, not related
by blood, living together, even
outside the universities, but at a
much smaller scale. The
universities would most probably
lead this trend and perhaps be the
show-pieces of this new awareness
and tolerance.
Parents Adoption Arrangement
The parents adoption
arrangement would be convenient
from many viewpoints. Most of
the adopted parents on campus
would be faculty members. Thus
it would be a good set up to mix
the students and teachers in an
informal family atmosphere. This
would have an effect of reducing
the generation gap which is so
miserable felt these days. This

would help the "established" and
the non-established to understand
each other and to appreciate each
others difficulties in a much
deeper and realistic manner.
Since the adopted parents
would be chosen freely (with no
obligations) and not forced by
nature, there seems a very high
likelihood that mutual relations
among this articifical family
would be firendly, cordial and
compassionate. Most often the
enforced relationship- enforced by
nature or man or both-brings in
the element of obligations, leading
to dis-harmony.
Communal Living
Alienation is a common
complaint these days, among the
young and the old alike. A part of
this alienation is self imposed,
because of lack of communal
living. It is becoming increasingly
difficult for people to have a joint
or communal living based on
blood relationship. One solution
to this problem of alienation is
the new concept of a family
whose members stick to each
other because of common likes.
The adopted parents arrangement
would provide a perfect solution
to the alienation among the single
university students.
The atmosphere in the adopted
parents residencial units would
without doubt be extremely
scholarly. With the growing trend
towards self-teaching and
individual curicullum, these small
residential units would provide
the nucleus for such a change. It
would be in these scholarly
residential units that self initiated
small seminars and discussion
sessious would take place.
Changing Coals
The existance of these small
scholarly residential units would
also be in line with the changing
goals of the university. A

university is no longer viewed as a
place which imparts knowledge,
enlightens and wisens but rather a
set up whose scholarly
atmosphere motivates towards self
learning and creativeness
(University of California, Santa
Cruz campus follows this
philosophy very rigidly). The
scholarly atmosphere in the small
parents adopted residences would
help breed the self-taught
intellects of highest order, with
Socratic wisdom, vision and
knowledge.
The change from the
centralized dormitory living of the
present to the small scattered
adopted parents residential units
would bring a great sense of relief
to the young scholars. One can
not help feeling that dormitory
living is more like a pigeon-hole
living. It certainly does not
provide a very graceful way for a
young scholar to live.

The inadequacy of the
on-campus housing facilities has
long been felt. Not only is it
impressed that the housing
facilities are usually short of
demand but also that the type of
facilities available is not
satisfactory to the growing change
in the education process.
There are two great changes
expected in the 21st century
on-campus housing- the enormous
increase in the number of housing
units and a fundamental change in
the nature of residence houses.
The immense increase in the
housing units would give the
university a new look. At present
the most imposing structures on a
university campus are the
department buildings and the
libraries. They also consume most
of the land. The living units in
comparison are less evident or
obscure. The enormous increase in
the housing units would give the
21st century university the look
of a city or a town, the living
units forming the most numerous
and conspicious structures.
Seclusionist Dormitories
There would also be a great
change in the nature of the
housing facilities. The dormitory
system, which owes its origin to
the monastery, is perhaps ideal to
lead ascetic life. In the coming
century it would be a thing of the
past, even today it is considered
very old fashioned. The present
trend of mixing the sexes in the
dormitories is in fact an urge to
break the seclusionist atmosphere,
for which the dormitories were
primarily designed.

nature, there seems a very high
likelihood that mutual relations
among this articifical family
would be firendly, cordial and
compassionate. Most often the
enforced relationship- enforced by
nature or man or both-brings in
the element of obligations, leading
to dis-harmony.
Communal Living
Alienation is a common
complaint these days, among the
young and the old alike. A part of
this alienation is self imposed,
because of lack of communal
living. It is becoming increasingly
difficult for people to have a joint
or communal living based on
blood relationship. One solution
to this problem of alienation is
the new concept of a family
whose members stick to each
other because of common likes.
The adopted parents arrangement
would provide a perfect solution
to the alienation among the single
university students.
The atmosphere in the adopted
parents residencial units would
without doubt be extremely
scholarly. With the growing trend
towards self-teaching and
individual curicullum, these small
residential units would provide
the nucleus for such a change. It
would be in these scholarly
residential units that self initiated
small seminars and discussion
sessious would take place.
Changing Coals
The existance of these small
scholarly residential units would
also be in line with the changing
goals of the university. A

university is no longer viewed as a
place which imparts knowledge,
enlightens and wisens but rather a
set up whose scholarly
atmosphere motivates towards self
learning and creativeness
(University of California, Santa
Cruz campus follows this
philosophy very rigidly). The
scholarly atmosphere in the small
parents adopted residences would
help breed the self-taught
intellects of highest order, with
Socratic wisdom, vision and
knowledge.
The change from the
centralized dormitory living of the
present to the small scattered
adopted parents residential units
would bring a great sense of relief
to the young scholars. One can
not help feeling that dormitory
living is more like a pigeon-hole
living. It certainly does not
provide a very graceful way for a
young scholar to live.

The inadequacy of the
on-campus housing facilities has
long been felt. Not only is it
impressed that the housing
facilities are usually short of
demand but also that the type of
facilities available is not
satisfactory to the growing change
in the education process.
There are two great changes
expected in the 21st century
on-campus housing- the enormous
increase in the number of housing
units and a fundamental change in
the nature of residence houses.
The immense increase in the
housing units would give the
university a new look. At present
the most imposing structures on a
university campus are the
department buildings and the
libraries. They also consume most
of the land. The living units in
comparison are less evident or
obscure. The enormous increase in
the housing units would give the
21st century university the look
of a city or a town, the living
units forming the most numerous
and conspicious structures.
Seclusionist Dormitories
There would also be a great
change in the nature of the
housing facilities. The dormitory
system, which owes its origin to
the monastery, is perhaps ideal to
lead ascetic life. In the coming
century it would be a thing of the
past, even today it is considered
very old fashioned. The present
trend of mixing the sexes in the
dormitories is in fact an urge to
break the seclusionist atmosphere,
for which the dormitories were
primarily designed.
Most of the on-campus living
units in the next century would
be for families or married couples.
For the single students there
would be a new arrangement, the
parents adoption. Single students,
in small groups, would find it
convenient to adopt middle aged
or older couples and live in a
family type set up. The principal
reason for the establishment and
success of such an arrangement
would be the increased
consciousness and awareness,
which the young people mostly
spearhead. Universities would not
be the only places where such an
arrangement would exist. In fact
one would come across this family
organization of people of
different age groups, not related
by blood, living together, even
outside the universities, but at a
much smaller scale. The
universities would most probably
lead this trend and perhaps be the
show-pieces of this new awareness
and tolerance.
Parents Adoption Arrangement
The parents adoption
arrangement would be convenient
from many viewpoints. Most of
the adopted parents on campus
would be faculty members. Thus
it would be a good set up to mix
the students and teachers in an
informal family atmosphere. This
would have an effect of reducing
the generation gap which is so
miserable felt these days. This

would help the "established" and
the non-established to understand
each other and to appreciate each
others difficulties in a much
deeper and realistic manner.
Since the adopted parents
would be chosen freely (with no
obligations) and not forced by
nature, there seems a very high
likelihood that mutual relations
among this articifical family
would be firendly, cordial and
compassionate. Most often the
enforced relationship- enforced by
nature or man or both-brings in
the element of obligations, leading
to dis-harmony.
