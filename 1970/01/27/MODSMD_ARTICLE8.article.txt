In the Daily of January 22, the
letter of J. Allergic displays a
basic naivete about the value
system of this university. What is

in question is not the comfort of
those annoyed either mentally or
physiologically by the wanderings
of man's best friend about the
classroom, but rather the
expression of individuality by
certain members of the Stanford

community. Like her
hyperfollicular male counterpart,
Le Chick Liberale seeks to display
where her head is at with certain
accoutrements, i.e. three-year-old
Levis, breasts bobbing sans
brassiere, and most essentially, a
fluffy unobedient puppy. So you
see, what is to some a vector of
allergens and annoyance is to
others a vital part of their
identity. And, heavens to 8.5. U.,
one must never tamper with
another's identity down on the
Farm.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I wish to remind all who
oppose the recent commendable
stand taken by Stanford
University against Brigham
Young University, that we are
now in the year 1970, and that in
the "land of the free, with liberty
and justice for all," there should
be no need for further
controversy when it comes to the
discussion of RACE.
As a Black woman, a former
legal resident of Salt Lake City,
and an avid researcher into
Mormonism, I know where of I
speak when I say that there is
most assuredly discrimination
within the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints and its
"affiliating organizations",
including the entire theocratic
state of Utah.
The written tenet and actual
practice of discriminating against
human beings becuase of race is
thought to have begun between
1838-39 when the church was in
Missouri. Since that time, the
policy has been justified by the
practicioners as discrimination by
God and not by the church. That
indeed God sent a "revelation" to
Joseph Smith (founder) declaring
that HE had cursed Cain and his
descendants and had doomed
them to everlasting servitude.
(References taken from Mormon,
Pearls of Great Price and other
literature.) Modern Mormons
interpret this to mean that a Black

is welcomed to join their church,
but cannot hold the Priesthood,
which is their very foundation of
religious growth, and essentially
that a Black can go to Heaven, but
only as a servant of a believer. To
blame God for such atrocity is
despicable!
Recently many alumni and
"friends" of Stanford have felt a
need to voice dubious opinions
and to place pressures on
President Pitzer and the Trustees
in defence of Mormonism. May I
remind these and acquaint others
of the "revelation" made in 1964,
at the occasion of the dedication
of the L.D.S. Temple in Oakland,
California, by the President of the
church (David O. McKay, age 90)
"who has power," to quote the
Mormon Doctrines anil
Covenants, "invested by God, and
who is accepted by the people as a
prophet, seer, revelator, the same
as Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah of the
Old Testament times and Peter,
James, John, Paul, etc., etc., of
the New Testament Period." On
that occasion, McKay was quoted
as saying that all may rest assured
that there would be no
"revelation" on the Negro during
his time. (New York Times, 1964)
Since doctrines in the L.D.S.
Church are not changed by a
"popular vote" of its members,
and since, therefore, the
President, prophet, and seer tells
God that he'll have no revelation,
the only logical conclusion to be
drawn is that the L.D.S. Church
(and its affiliates) discriminates
now and will doubtless continue
to do so for many years to come.
This latter point can be born out
in the fact that few, if any, of the
present members of the governing
body, The Council of Twelve
Apostles, are under 70 years of
age. As is a matter of public
record, physical health alone

deters most of the "Apostles"
from active service to the church,
and only one has voiced an
opinion on the "Negro issue."
It is indeed refreshing, in the
midst of the "Silent Majority"
mania, to see Caucasions and a
basically Caucasion institution,
take a none too popular, albeit
just, stand for social reform It is
encouraging to see Stanford take
direct steps to counter blatant
racism, instead of sitting back
asking the perpetual question,
"What can I do?" Perhaps there is
hope for our society!

This item, of vital interest to

attention.
Hoover Tower, perennial
phallic symbol of Stanford
University students, yesterday
ejaculated to the amazed surprise
of thousands of drenched
students. There was also an
element of tragedy as two F
Ill's, believed enroute to Viet
Nam, were squirted down as they
flew overhead. Both pilots
parachuted to safety and are now
in the University hospital, in good
condition, as the result of shock
and near drowning. Also, Cowell
Heal th Center is reportedly
treating 250 coeds suffering from
multiple pregnancies. Bystanders
claimed to have observed two
long-haired radicals rhytmically
riding the elevator up and down
before the tragic eruption.
President Pitzer, in a hurried news
conference, noted that further
details and free contraceptives
would be forthcoming.

This latter point can be born out
in the fact that few, if any, of the

age. As is a matter of public

deters most of the "Apostles"
from active service to the church,

opinion on the "Negro issue."
It is indeed refreshing, in the

in question is not the comfort of

certain members of the Stanford

I wish to remind all who
oppose the recent commendable
stand taken by Stanford
University against Brigham
Young University, that we are
now in the year 1970, and that in
the "land of the free, with liberty
and justice for all," there should
be no need for further
controversy when it comes to the
discussion of RACE.
As a Black woman, a former
legal resident of Salt Lake City,
and an avid researcher into
Mormonism, I know where of I
speak when I say that there is
most assuredly discrimination
within the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints and its
"affiliating organizations",
including the entire theocratic
state of Utah.
The written tenet and actual
practice of discriminating against
human beings becuase of race is
thought to have begun between
1838-39 when the church was in
Missouri. Since that time, the
policy has been justified by the
practicioners as discrimination by
God and not by the church. That
indeed God sent a "revelation" to
Joseph Smith (founder) declaring
that HE had cursed Cain and his
descendants and had doomed
them to everlasting servitude.
(References taken from Mormon,
Pearls of Great Price and other
literature.) Modern Mormons
interpret this to mean that a Black

is welcomed to join their church,
but cannot hold the Priesthood,
which is their very foundation of
religious growth, and essentially
that a Black can go to Heaven, but
only as a servant of a believer. To
blame God for such atrocity is
despicable!
Recently many alumni and
"friends" of Stanford have felt a
need to voice dubious opinions
and to place pressures on
President Pitzer and the Trustees
in defence of Mormonism. May I
remind these and acquaint others
of the "revelation" made in 1964,
at the occasion of the dedication
of the L.D.S. Temple in Oakland,

In the Daily of January 22, the
letter of J. Allergic displays a
basic naivete about the value
system of this university. What is

in question is not the comfort of
those annoyed either mentally or
physiologically by the wanderings
of man's best friend about the
classroom, but rather the
expression of individuality by
certain members of the Stanford

community. Like her
hyperfollicular male counterpart,
Le Chick Liberale seeks to display
where her head is at with certain
accoutrements, i.e. three-year-old
Levis, breasts bobbing sans
brassiere, and most essentially, a
fluffy unobedient puppy. So you
see, what is to some a vector of
allergens and annoyance is to
others a vital part of their
identity. And, heavens to 8.5. U.,
one must never tamper with
another's identity down on the
Farm.

I wish to remind all who
oppose the recent commendable
stand taken by Stanford
University against Brigham
Young University, that we are
now in the year 1970, and that in
the "land of the free, with liberty
and justice for all," there should
be no need for further
controversy when it comes to the
discussion of RACE.
As a Black woman, a former
legal resident of Salt Lake City,
and an avid researcher into
Mormonism, I know where of I
speak when I say that there is
most assuredly discrimination
within the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints and its
"affiliating organizations",
including the entire theocratic
state of Utah.
The written tenet and actual
practice of discriminating against
human beings becuase of race is
thought to have begun between
1838-39 when the church was in
Missouri. Since that time, the
policy has been justified by the
practicioners as discrimination by
God and not by the church. That
indeed God sent a "revelation" to
Joseph Smith (founder) declaring
that HE had cursed Cain and his
descendants and had doomed
them to everlasting servitude.
(References taken from Mormon,
Pearls of Great Price and other
literature.) Modern Mormons
interpret this to mean that a Black

is welcomed to join their church,
but cannot hold the Priesthood,
which is their very foundation of
religious growth, and essentially
that a Black can go to Heaven, but
only as a servant of a believer. To
blame God for such atrocity is
despicable!
Recently many alumni and
"friends" of Stanford have felt a
need to voice dubious opinions
and to place pressures on
President Pitzer and the Trustees
in defence of Mormonism. May I
remind these and acquaint others
of the "revelation" made in 1964,
at the occasion of the dedication
of the L.D.S. Temple in Oakland,
California, by the President of the
church (David O. McKay, age 90)
"who has power," to quote the
Mormon Doctrines anil
Covenants, "invested by God, and
who is accepted by the people as a
prophet, seer, revelator, the same
as Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah of the
Old Testament times and Peter,
James, John, Paul, etc., etc., of
the New Testament Period." On
that occasion, McKay was quoted
as saying that all may rest assured
that there would be no
"revelation" on the Negro during
his time. (New York Times, 1964)
Since doctrines in the L.D.S.
Church are not changed by a
"popular vote" of its members,
and since, therefore, the
President, prophet, and seer tells
God that he'll have no revelation,
the only logical conclusion to be
drawn is that the L.D.S. Church
(and its affiliates) discriminates
now and will doubtless continue
to do so for many years to come.
This latter point can be born out
in the fact that few, if any, of the
present members of the governing
body, The Council of Twelve
Apostles, are under 70 years of
age. As is a matter of public
record, physical health alone

deters most of the "Apostles"
from active service to the church,
and only one has voiced an
opinion on the "Negro issue."
It is indeed refreshing, in the
midst of the "Silent Majority"
mania, to see Caucasions and a
basically Caucasion institution,
take a none too popular, albeit
just, stand for social reform It is
encouraging to see Stanford take
direct steps to counter blatant
racism, instead of sitting back
asking the perpetual question,
"What can I do?" Perhaps there is
hope for our society!

This item, of vital interest to
all students, has come to my
attention.
Hoover Tower, perennial
phallic symbol of Stanford
University students, yesterday
ejaculated to the amazed surprise
of thousands of drenched
students. There was also an
element of tragedy as two F
Ill's, believed enroute to Viet
Nam, were squirted down as they
flew overhead. Both pilots
parachuted to safety and are now
in the University hospital, in good
condition, as the result of shock
and near drowning. Also, Cowell
Heal th Center is reportedly
treating 250 coeds suffering from
multiple pregnancies. Bystanders
claimed to have observed two
long-haired radicals rhytmically
riding the elevator up and down
before the tragic eruption.
President Pitzer, in a hurried news
conference, noted that further
details and free contraceptives
would be forthcoming.
