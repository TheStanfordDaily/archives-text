# Skillful Teachers
## Message to Moses 
### Mark Moskowitz 
Friday's letter to The Daily
from Dean Moses is indicative of
the Administration's long standing
error regarding the position of
Teaching Assistants on this
campus. TA's are not humble
petitioners for University
handouts, but skilled workers,
who have a right to a level of pay
commensurate with their abilities
and training. Ironically, it was the
Internal Revenue Service's
recognition of this fact which
caused the present crisis. The
I.R.S. criteria for taxation (which,
according to the University legal
staff, are applicable to TA's) are
based on the University's need for
the services performed by

teaching graduate students. TA's,
that is, must be taxed if their
absence would necessitate heavier
loads for present faculty or the
hiring of additional faculty.
Graduate students are being
employed as faculty members,
while the Administration claims
that their salaries are mere
"financial aid."
The present salary levels -
reached during the negotiations of
September, 1968 - were based on
the assumption that TA salaries
were not subject to taxation. On
the basis of these agreements TA's
in the affected departments
understood that their acceptance
of contracts for the present

academic year depended upon the
absence of a tax liability. With the
introduction of monthly
withholding, it is obvious that
new salary ranges must be
negotiated, based on this sudden
change in status and, of course,
not affecting the already planned
cost of living increase. Until this
can be done, it is the
responsibility of the
Administration to uphold the
spirit of its agreements by
maintaining, for the remainder of
this year, the level of pay which it
promised its employees.
Dean Moses' claim that others
are paid less is neither accurate in
the majority of the cases he
mentions (where additional or
summer stipends are usually
available) nor relevant, since it
compares employees, who give
half of their time to teaching and,
in the process, considerably
extend the length of their degree
program, with full time students
(who, incidentally, receive full
instead of half tuition from the
University and thus avoid the
infamous third year tuition
requirement for the Ph.D., a
liability which so often falls on
those whose main support was
through a TA).
