# Moratorium Continues Ban On Photos, Tape
## 
### 
In its third meeting last night,
the new Moratorium did not
rescind its previous decision to
ban photographs and tape
recordings of its meetings.
Members argued that "the
Daily can report what goes on
here just as fully without taking
pictures," and that material
evidence such as pictures and tape
recordings had been crucial in
convicting students after the April
Third Movement demonstrations
last year.
Sources have indicated that
serious reconsideration of the ban
may take place at Thursday's
meeting.
Both the Daily and KZSU had
expressed opposition to the
partial media ban, charging that
the meetings were not "open
community meetings" as long as
such a ban was in effect.
(A reporter and photographer
from the Daily will attend next

Thursday's new Moratorium
meeting.)
Most of the meeting was
devoted to consideration of future
activities and tactics. The
anti-ROTC group decided to learn
first-hand the nature of the
organization they are seeking to
eliminate from the Stanford
campus. They will attend an
advanced military science course,
"Principles of War and Military
Tactics", today at 3:15 in PE 47.
The auditing of the class will be
a "non-violent, non-disruptive,
and educational" experience for the
New Moratorium members, with
action consisting of "just sitting
and watching and laughing a
little."
The activist group decided also
to arrange in the near future a
tour of the military science
department at Stanford to be
preceded by a rally. The tour
would be part of what the group

hopes will be a massive education
campaign to inform the students
of the nature of ROTC.
Michael Sweeney, editor of the
Chaparral and one of the leaders
of the new group, noted, "We have
to make the campus aware of
ROTC every day.
"We have to show the students
that these classes are teaching
candidates how to conduct
counter-insurgency, how to use
chemical and biological warfare."
In a related development,
petitions are presently being
circulated among the faculty to
force the reconsideration of
Faculty Senate ROTC decision by
the full Academic Council.
Though only 50 signatures are
needed for the Academic Council
to reconsider the decision,
professors Hal Kahn and Martin
Carnoy are hoping that the
signatures will run in the
hundreds.
