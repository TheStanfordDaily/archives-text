# Carbonmonoxide et al
## Out Of Oxygen: The Nuclear Age? 
### A. Wayne Karp 
"Welcome, sulphur dioxide,
Hello, carbon monoxide." Thus a
tribal-love-rock musical states the
obvious: the air just isn't what it
used to be. Air pollution has
reached the point where chronic
pulmonary disorders are inevitable
in adulthood for children raised in
areas of high pollution. The
carbon dioxide content of the
atmosphere has risen about ten
percent over the past few decades.
Although this is not directly
toxic, it is an ecological horror of
first order.
The people are developing an
increased awareness of the
deterioration of the environment,
and an understandable paranoia is
resulting. But paranoia does not
always lead to workable solutions,
and is now primarily resulting in
emotional bursts at small parts of
a complex system which its
victims do not fully understand.
Americans complain of
increasingly common electrical
power failures, and at the same
time are beginning to oppose, at
least in rhetoric, smog producing
coal and oil burning power plants.
Fear of radiation, and of thermal
pollution of our rivers, has led to
vehement opposition to nuclear
generating stations, which are the
only other available source of

electrical power (there aren't
many large untapped rivers left
for hydroelectric power
production, and let's not dam the
Grand Canyon). Thus people are
now opposing all forms of
increased electrical power
production.
At the same time, people are
demanding more and more power.
Consumption of electrical power
in the U.S.A. has tripled in the
past ten years. If, as expected,
electrical consumption quadruples
in the next twenty years, it will
take the power output of 670
Hoover Dams or 1125 nuclear
plants like those at Hanford,
Washington, to supply this
additional power. Or, or course,
the number of conventional, smog
producing plants could be
increased to the point where
fashion conscious people in cities
like L.A. will become concerned
with the color and style of their
personal gas masks.
Treating Symplons
We must stop attacking only
symptoms of this problem, as has
become popular lately. A typical
instance of attacking only a
symptom is that of local people
who were "successful" in
preventing the construction of a
nuclear plant at Shoreham, on

Long Island, in New York State.
They did not in any sense
eliminate an environmental
hazard. They merely traded it off
for a previously unplanned plant,
now under construction, which
will burn oil, and emit smog, and
(to a somewhat lesser degree than
the nuclear plant) thermal
pollution.
This new plant is being built in
a nearby community on Long
Islandâ€”some success.
To tackle the root of the
problem is to look inward at
ourselves. Scapegoats, such as the
Vietnam War, the military
complex, and the wasteful "o,ther
guy," are only part of the cause.
Its you and me and every one of
us who must drastically change
our habits, and even our values, if
we are to prevent
ecological-environmental-life
-quality disaster.
The casual waste of aluminum
foil is also the waste of a lot of
electricity that it took to remove
that aluminum from its natural
ore. When you persuade your
folks to have an air conditioner
installed in your room back home,
remember that air conditioning
uses more electricity than any
other item in a modern home,
except perhaps electric heating.

Greater demand for electric
power must result in greater
production of that power. In
other words, to aspire to the
luxuries of the products of
electricity is to "aspire" to smog
and air pollution or nuclear
power.
Polluters List
Increased use of electricity is
only one of many interrelated
causes of the erosion of our
environment. Automobiles join
with electric power production as
the two worst polluters of the air.
Also, all disposable products
ultimately find their way to
garbage incinerators, or sewage
systems which dump into our
rivers and bays, or other
detrimental disposal systems.
Technical advances are being
made in lessening the pollution
created by various products.
However, when the amount of
products increases more quickly
than the decrease in pollution per
unit product, the total pollution
rate must continue to rise.
Steward Udall has proposed
that the Gross National Product
no longer be considered a measure
of our national well being. I
propose that we continue to use it
as one among many indicators,
but that our interpretation of the
GNP be drastically altered. A GNP
rising at a rate no greater than the
approximate rate of progress in
developing pollution control
systems, should be the goal of
economic planning.
Drain of Resources
We must exert efforts to
prevent the GNP from increasing
more rapidly than this. We must
realize that a too rapidly
expanding economy drains us of
our resources and our
environment. Of course the GNP
could remain fairly constant in
total and still confortably sustain
internal changes in what it is
composed of, and how it is
distributed among the population.
Many middle class Americans
have been upset that inflation has
wiped out their economic progress
this past year. But the expectancy
and demand for an ever increasing
material standard of living is not
an inherent human attitude, but
rather is a result of our recent
history.
Only a Slowup
It is obvious that no matter
how immediate and how
coordinated the effort, nothing

will instantly bring a permanent
halt to the production-consump
tion expansion in our system The
projected quadrupled output of
twenty years hence can, however,
be avoided. People become aware
of the total problem, and not
merely- of its most conspicuous
symptoms.
Also, if most of the portion of
the increase which is unavoidable
is powered with nuclear fuel, the
effect will be much more tolerable
than the alternatives. The vision
of 1125 potential nuclear plants
all pouring heat into our rivers is
not acceptable.
However, a smaller number of
plants, with a smaller heat output,
would be a very livable situation.
A corresponding increase in fossil
fuel plants, on top of the already
exhorbitant amount of smog
polluters, would seriously detract
from the quality of the
environment and life itself.
This author is convinced, by
scientific evidence, that although
potential radiation hazards exist,
they are so small as to be very
much preferable to increased
conventional air pollution.
Hazards Distorted
Unfortunately, the hazards of
nuclear power have been greatly
distorted by those who fear it and
wish to convince others to also
fear it. For instance, a study made
at John Jopkins is sometimes
cited. This study showed that a
radiation dose of 1 to 2 "rems"
delivered to a girl baby while she
is developing in utero will result in
the death of 50 percent of her
conceptions of female sex when
she reaches child bearing age.
It is generally not explained to
the audience that the normal unit
of radiation dosage is the one
thousandth of a rem (mrem). It is
further not explained that even if
a woman resided on the boundary
of a typical plant, emitting about
the same amount of radiation as
the plant at Indian Point in New
York, she would have to remain
pregnant for over seventy years
for the child to receive the 1 to 2
rem exposure!
The combination of an
accurately informed public and a
value-revolution must be the
foundation of the future, for the
future is the place where we're all
going to have to live.
