# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

### 
Poached Eggs?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning, January the
27th day of the decade: I fall out
of my cocoon, stagger in the cold
darkness to the closet, throw on
God knows what, and make my
way down to my poached egg. I
stare at the thing; it stares back,
daring me. (Alas little hen, gentle
with white feathers, somebody's
gone and salt and peppered your
sun.)
Maybe, I say to myself, to the
particular myself that happens to
be awake at all, just maybe, if I
pick up that DAILY sitting there
all crisp and brisk and alert, I can
eat my egg without noticing it,
and at the same time, keep the old
eyes open! What an idea! A true
piece of crystal.
And then comes crystal idea
two: why don't I read "Letters to
the Editor" first, thereby being
stimulated by all those crisp and
brisk and alert people who are
reported to be loose in the
vicinity? Fine. That's what I did.
Consequently, I want Tom
Booth to know I appreciated his
sixth grade (mature sixth grade,
I'll grant) letter concerning a huge
penis, (excuse, Hoover Tower),

which ejaculated, soaking
"thousands" of "amazed"
students with semen. I was
particularly impressed with his
description of the "250" multiple
pregnancies and with his cute
account of how "two long- haired
radicals" managed to excite the
"erruption".

The alarm clock is a sadistic
manifestation of a masochistic
society, and for morning survival,
it is good to grasp at all possible
particles of asthetisism.
And to be slapped with the
WIT of Tom Booth, well, there
was just no way to get my egg
accomplished. I want him to
know that too. May he refrain
from further publishing.

Member "Discusses Issues"
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a member of the new
Stanford Moratorium, I must
strongly protest the Daily's
coverage of our meetings. First, it
is less than candid on the part of
both the Daily and KZSU to
charge that reporters have been
barred. We have only refused to
allow photographs or tape
recordings of the meetings.
The reason for this decision,
which you did not see fit to
report, is that people have gone to
jail because of Daily photographs.
The Daily didn't want to send
people to jail: the pictures were

subpoenaed. Recent court
decisions in California and
elsewhere have shown that the
pigs are ready to use felony
conspiracy laws against campus
radical movements, and pictures
and tapes of fully legal meetings
are very important in building
such cases.
KZSU's charge that a refusal to
allow photographs and tape
recordings means that a meeting is
not a community meeting and
does not employ participatory
democracy is arrogant and, in
KZSU's own works, "disgracefully
false." The meetings are not
"closed to all but those who will
nod their heads in agreement."
They are closed only to cameras
and tape recorders, not people.
Daily and KZSU reporters, as well
as all members of the community,
are welcome. (As a matter of fact,
the Daily photographer's film was
returned to him, intact.)
Second, there has been a
consistent effort by the Daily to
imply that the now Moratorium is
being manipulated by Bruce
Franklin. His is the only name
ever mentioned in reports; his
remarks on every issue are
diligentlv reported, though others

prominent in the discussion. This
is a clear attempt to identify a
"leadership" of the new
Moratorium, and to discredit the
new Moratorium's decisions â€”
decisions reached at large
meetings, by vote, after extensive
discussion on both sides.
The Daily's threat to deny news
coverage to an important campus
movement is irresponsible
journalism, and so is reporting
which implies that the discussion
of the press was the main or most
important discussion that has
gone on at those meetings. Let's
get down to discussing the issues,
please.
