# History Of Booze At Stanford
## Early Students Drank A Lot 
### DICK BUXTON

history of alcohol at Stanlord
down through the Faculty's
Club's attempt to get a license)
Stanford's Founding Grant did
not prohibit alcohol at Stanford
in fact it gave for Stanford use
Vina Ranch, one of the world's
largest vineyards. Though Sen.
and Mrs. Stanford did not outlaw
liquor at their university they
wished to keep its use controlled
and Mr Stanford persuaded the
seller of farm land for the town of
Palo Alto to include a provision in
the deeds of sale prohibiting the
sale of liquor in the town.
Students were not confined,
however because the "wet" towns
of Menlo Park to the north and
May field to the south were
common drinking places for

students who knew the "Mayfield
Road", "Mayfield habit."
Anti-alcohol sentiment existed
among students during Stanford's
early, non-restricted drinking days
and one freshman writing in his
home-town newspaper in 1891
said, "There seems to be but one
thing which may prove a
drawback to student life here and
that is the proximity of Menlo
Park and Mayfield where the
saloon and billiard halls figure
prominently. It may be, however,
that these can be abolished thru
the influence of proper
authorities." This eventually
happened although billiard tables
can still be found in Tresidder and
some back rooms of residences.
Professor Arthur Clark of
Stanford became mayor of
Mayfield in 1903 and shortly
thereafter closed the saloons by

special ordinance. Though Menlo
Park was farther from the
University than Mayfield the
students soon knew "Menlo
Road" as well as they had known
Mayfield.
Vicious Drinkers
Two years later a faculty
committee on student affairs
headed by Clark tried to check
the student conviviality and near
scandals due to drunkenness in
Menlo Park.
A clergyman said that Menlo
was a meeting place for "idle and
vicious drinkers of PA, Mayfield
and Stanford University, much to
the danger and menace of women,
girls, and children."
Clark's committee passed an
order prohibiting students vrom
visiting saloons. Vigorous
opposition had preceeded the
decision and after its approval

students staged a "small dramatic
rebellion" with no result.
Students (the "booze
element") with no other
alternatives brought drinking to
campus. One Stanford historian
says"The beer wagon procession,
nightly orgies, drunken parades,
noisy outbreaks of vulgarity and
worse presently proclaimed a
'wide open' Stanford."
Citizen Concern
A citizen's Civic Federation
chaired by a then praticing doctor
of Palo Alto, Ray Lyman Wilbur
suggested that the university take
measures to control increased
drunkenness and obscenity. They
said, "Unless the drinking
problem is grappled with
promptly and firmly, it is a
generally expressed fear that the
university will suffer very much.
The issue was being debated at
Stanford when an accident
involving drunkenness occurred. A
student returning home from
Menlo Park in the early morning
was drunk and entered the wrong
house in Palo Alto, was mistaken
for a burglar and was shot to
death. Two days later the Trustees
adopted without consultation a
resolution that drunkenness be
considered grounds for suspension
from the University. Students
objected that the "right to drink
on the campus, and the right of
the individual to regulate his own
conduct" were two articles of
Stanford policy which were
destroyed by the decision.
A new student affairs
committee was formed, and was
headed by Clark. Clark's
committee reviewed the cases of
three students who had been
scheduled to appear before a
previous committee for violations
of the drinking policy. The new
committee suspended them and
Stanford students feeling the
decision unjust reacted.
"Pee-Rade"
Students demonstrated in a
"pee-rade" on March 12, 1907.
They marched to Clark's house in
College Terrace and finding him
not at home marched back to
campus, through the library and
disbursed in memorial court after
burning a copy of the Clark
Committee policy before the
statue of Mr. Stanford.

The parade resulted in 12
suspensions for students who were
caught, and a mass petition
expressing common guilt was
submitted to the committee
demanding equal penalty for its
247 signers.
An ASSU public apology and a
participant apology did not
mollify the committee which
went ahead with judging all 259
of the students. Their decision
was given two weeks after the
demonstration and divided the
demonstrators in three catagories
of which the 56 students in the
first group had their cases
dismissed with action. 36 students
had increased graduation unit
requirements, and those in the
remaining group had various unit
requirement increases including
the suspension of 41 seniors for
the remainder of the year.
Slate Law
Stanford pressure in the state
legislature soon brought a
protective law to the books in
1909 which made it a
misdemeanor to sell vinous or
alcoholic liquors within one and
one half miles of a University
grounds or campus of University
having more than 1,000 registered
students or 500 residents.
This law forced the closing of
bars in Menlo Park and Stanford
and its environs became dry."
The above law has been
amended several times and
presently provides that the law
"Shall not apply to nor prohibit
the sale, gift, or exposing, or
offering for sale of beer, lager
beer, ale, porter wine, similar
fermented malt, or vinous liquor
or fruit juice containing one-half
of 1 percent or more of alcohol
by volume and not more than
3.2% of alcohol by weight." In
addition bona fide restaurants
within the IV2 mile limit can sell
hard liquor.
The law stipulated no selling of
alcoholic beverages but the
Trustees had gone even further by
prohibiting transport or
possession of alcohol by any
student no matter what his age.
This policy remained for about
sixty years.Tomorrow's article will
discuss various student reactions
to the policy and its eventual
change.

happened although billiard tables
can still be found in Tresidder and

Professor Arthur Clark of
Stanford became mayor of
Mayfield in 1903 and shortly
thereafter closed the saloons by

special ordinance. Though Menlo
Park was farther from the
University than Mayfield the
students soon knew "Menlo
Road" as well as they had known
Mayfield.
Vicious Drinkers
Two years later a faculty
committee on student affairs
headed by Clark tried to check
the student conviviality and near
scandals due to drunkenness in
Menlo Park.
A clergyman said that Menlo
was a meeting place for "idle and
vicious drinkers of PA, Mayfield
and Stanford University, much to
the danger and menace of women,
girls, and children."
Clark's committee passed an
order prohibiting students vrom
visiting saloons. Vigorous
opposition had preceeded the
decision and after its approval

students staged a "small dramatic
rebellion" with no result.
Students (the "booze
element") with no other
alternatives brought drinking to
campus. One Stanford historian
says"The beer wagon procession,
nightly orgies, drunken parades,
noisy outbreaks of vulgarity and
worse presently proclaimed a
'wide open' Stanford."
Citizen Concern
A citizen's Civic Federation
chaired by a then praticing doctor
of Palo Alto, Ray Lyman Wilbur
suggested that the university take
measures to control increased
drunkenness and obscenity. They
said, "Unless the drinking
problem is grappled with
promptly and firmly, it is a
generally expressed fear that the
university will suffer very much.
The issue was being debated at
Stanford when an accident
involving drunkenness occurred. A
student returning home from
Menlo Park in the early morning
was drunk and entered the wrong
house in Palo Alto, was mistaken
for a burglar and was shot to
death. Two days later the Trustees
adopted without consultation a
resolution that drunkenness be
considered grounds for suspension
from the University. Students
objected that the "right to drink
on the campus, and the right of
the individual to regulate his own
conduct" were two articles of
Stanford policy which were
destroyed by the decision.
A new student affairs
committee was formed, and was
headed by Clark. Clark's
committee reviewed the cases of
three students who had been
scheduled to appear before a
previous committee for violations
of the drinking policy. The new
committee suspended them and
Stanford students feeling the
decision unjust reacted.
"Pee-Rade"
Students demonstrated in a
"pee-rade" on March 12, 1907.
They marched to Clark's house in
College Terrace and finding him
not at home marched back to
campus, through the library and
disbursed in memorial court after
burning a copy of the Clark
Committee policy before the
statue of Mr. Stanford.

The parade resulted in 12
suspensions for students who were
caught, and a mass petition
expressing common guilt was
submitted to the committee
demanding equal penalty for its
247 signers.
An ASSU public apology and a
participant apology did not
mollify the committee which
went ahead with judging all 259
of the students. Their decision
was given two weeks after the
demonstration and divided the
demonstrators in three catagories
of which the 56 students in the
first group had their cases
dismissed with action. 36 students
had increased graduation unit
requirements, and those in the
remaining group had various unit
requirement increases including
the suspension of 41 seniors for
the remainder of the year.
Slate Law
Stanford pressure in the state
legislature soon brought a
protective law to the books in
1909 which made it a
misdemeanor to sell vinous or
alcoholic liquors within one and
one half miles of a University
grounds or campus of University
having more than 1,000 registered
students or 500 residents.
This law forced the closing of
bars in Menlo Park and Stanford
and its environs became dry."
The above law has been
amended several times and
presently provides that the law
"Shall not apply to nor prohibit
the sale, gift, or exposing, or
offering for sale of beer, lager
beer, ale, porter wine, similar
fermented malt, or vinous liquor
or fruit juice containing one-half
of 1 percent or more of alcohol
by volume and not more than
3.2% of alcohol by weight." In
addition bona fide restaurants
within the IV2 mile limit can sell
hard liquor.
The law stipulated no selling of
alcoholic beverages but the
Trustees had gone even further by
prohibiting transport or
possession of alcohol by any
student no matter what his age.
This policy remained for about
sixty years.Tomorrow's article will
discuss various student reactions
to the policy and its eventual
change.

Citizen Concern
A citizen's Civic Federation
chaired by a then praticing doctor
of Palo Alto, Ray Lyman Wilbur
suggested that the university take
measures to control increased
drunkenness and obscenity. They
said, "Unless the drinking
problem is grappled with
promptly and firmly, it is a
generally expressed fear that the
university will suffer very much.
The issue was being debated at
Stanford when an accident
involving drunkenness occurred. A
student returning home from
Menlo Park in the early morning
was drunk and entered the wrong
house in Palo Alto, was mistaken
for a burglar and was shot to
death. Two days later the Trustees
adopted without consultation a
resolution that drunkenness be
considered grounds for suspension
from the University. Students
objected that the "right to drink
on the campus, and the right of
the individual to regulate his own
conduct" were two articles of
Stanford policy which were
destroyed by the decision.
A new student affairs
committee was formed, and was
headed by Clark. Clark's
committee reviewed the cases of
three students who had been
scheduled to appear before a
previous committee for violations
of the drinking policy. The new
committee suspended them and
Stanford students feeling the
decision unjust reacted.
"Pee-Rade"
Students demonstrated in a
"pee-rade" on March 12, 1907.
They marched to Clark's house in
College Terrace and finding him
not at home marched back to
campus, through the library and
disbursed in memorial court after
burning a copy of the Clark
Committee policy before the
statue of Mr. Stanford.

The parade resulted in 12
suspensions for students who were
caught, and a mass petition
expressing common guilt was
submitted to the committee
demanding equal penalty for its
247 signers.
An ASSU public apology and a
participant apology did not
mollify the committee which
went ahead with judging all 259
of the students. Their decision
was given two weeks after the
demonstration and divided the
demonstrators in three catagories
of which the 56 students in the
first group had their cases
dismissed with action. 36 students
had increased graduation unit
requirements, and those in the
remaining group had various unit
requirement increases including
the suspension of 41 seniors for
the remainder of the year.
Slate Law
Stanford pressure in the state
legislature soon brought a
protective law to the books in
1909 which made it a
misdemeanor to sell vinous or
alcoholic liquors within one and
one half miles of a University
grounds or campus of University
having more than 1,000 registered
students or 500 residents.
This law forced the closing of
bars in Menlo Park and Stanford
and its environs became dry."
The above law has been
amended several times and
presently provides that the law
"Shall not apply to nor prohibit
the sale, gift, or exposing, or
offering for sale of beer, lager
beer, ale, porter wine, similar
fermented malt, or vinous liquor
or fruit juice containing one-half
of 1 percent or more of alcohol
by volume and not more than
3.2% of alcohol by weight." In
addition bona fide restaurants
within the IV2 mile limit can sell
hard liquor.
The law stipulated no selling of
alcoholic beverages but the
Trustees had gone even further by
prohibiting transport or
possession of alcohol by any
student no matter what his age.
This policy remained for about
sixty years.Tomorrow's article will
discuss various student reactions
to the policy and its eventual
change.
(Editor's note: This is the lirst
of a three part series 011 the
history of alcohol at Stanlord
down through the Faculty's
Club's attempt to get a license)
Stanford's Founding Grant did
not prohibit alcohol at Stanford
in fact it gave for Stanford use
Vina Ranch, one of the world's
largest vineyards. Though Sen.
and Mrs. Stanford did not outlaw
liquor at their university they
wished to keep its use controlled
and Mr Stanford persuaded the
seller of farm land for the town of
Palo Alto to include a provision in
the deeds of sale prohibiting the
sale of liquor in the town.
Students were not confined,
however because the "wet" towns
of Menlo Park to the north and
May field to the south were
common drinking places for

students who knew the "Mayfield
Road", "Mayfield habit."
Anti-alcohol sentiment existed
among students during Stanford's
early, non-restricted drinking days
and one freshman writing in his
home-town newspaper in 1891
said, "There seems to be but one
thing which may prove a
drawback to student life here and
that is the proximity of Menlo
Park and Mayfield where the
saloon and billiard halls figure
prominently. It may be, however,
that these can be abolished thru
the influence of proper
authorities." This eventually
happened although billiard tables
can still be found in Tresidder and
some back rooms of residences.
Professor Arthur Clark of
Stanford became mayor of
Mayfield in 1903 and shortly
thereafter closed the saloons by

special ordinance. Though Menlo
Park was farther from the
University than Mayfield the
students soon knew "Menlo
Road" as well as they had known
Mayfield.
Vicious Drinkers
Two years later a faculty
committee on student affairs
headed by Clark tried to check
the student conviviality and near
scandals due to drunkenness in
Menlo Park.
A clergyman said that Menlo
was a meeting place for "idle and
vicious drinkers of PA, Mayfield
and Stanford University, much to
the danger and menace of women,
girls, and children."
Clark's committee passed an
order prohibiting students vrom
visiting saloons. Vigorous
opposition had preceeded the
decision and after its approval

students staged a "small dramatic
rebellion" with no result.
Students (the "booze
element") with no other
alternatives brought drinking to
campus. One Stanford historian
says"The beer wagon procession,
nightly orgies, drunken parades,
noisy outbreaks of vulgarity and
worse presently proclaimed a
'wide open' Stanford."
