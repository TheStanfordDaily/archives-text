# Keller: Jobs Scarce For June Graduates
## 
### 
June graduates with advanced
degrees —at Stanford and other
U.S. universities— are facing a
"job market depression," Director
of Placement Ralph Keller
believes.
But Keller is optimistic. He
feels that the current situation
may indicate only a temporary
bottoming out of an upward curve
of employment. It results in part
from the clear trend away from
defense-oriented economy to a
more "civilian" type.
Reports from the University of
California's Placement Service
indicate the situation is worse
now than in previous recessions of
1962, 1957-58 and 1948-49.
Placement Service records show
that 58 major companies and
seven government agencies have
already canceled their Stanford
recruiting dates for January,
February, and March, normally
the peak period for visits by
campus recruiting teams.
"This includes firms in the
'bluebook of American industry'
that have never canceled before,"
Keller reported. In the past
cancellations have never
amounted to more than a dozen,
mainly from lack of student
interest. More than 450

companies annually contact
Stanford for recruits.
The job market slump is true
for the whole spectrum—govern
ment, business, industry and
education, Keller said. However,
the less defense-oriented the firm,
the less it is suffering.
Fewer Technologists
"Apparently the current
demand is for fewer
technnologists —the theorists, and
for more technicians—the
how-to-do-it people," he said in a
campus interview.
Stanford students receiving
undergraduate degrees may
weather the storm better, he feels,
"because 80 percent go on to
graduate study anyway."
However, even advanced degree
candidates may not find the
recession as difficult as those from
other universities. "We turn out
fewer advanced degree holders,
but they are the cream of the
crop," Keller said.
In 1968, a Western College
Placement Service survey ranked
Stanford first nationally among
private institutions and third
among all universities in having
graduates "who best meet
employers' specifications" as
outlined in their published

requests to the Placement Service.
Keller said:
"This speaks especially well for
our Graduate School of Business
and our School of Engineering."
Stanford also ranks high in such
factors as cooperation with
recruiters and job information
available to students.
Humanities and Sciences
graduates with A.B. degrees or
higher don't fare as well in the job
market, but this is a traditional
situation as well as a current
problem, he indicated.
Many Co Into Teaching
"Many go into high school or
college-level teaching," he said,
"but industry, business and
government haven't shut their
doors against a graduate with a
good liberal education and
potential ability. There are always
jobs for highly qualified people."
Keller feels that the new focus
on clearing up the environmental
problems of the country and
general ecological efforts will take
up the slack "once these get
properly financed and under
way."
"The attack on air, water and
soil pollution problems and plans
to curb the population explosion
will require engineers, scientists,
educators, and virtually the whole
professional spectrum," he
predicted.
Engineers who also hold
masters' degrees in business
administration will be especially
fortunate, the placement director
believes, because they have a
broader focus and a more flexible
range of abilities than those
trained strictly for specialized
engineering fields.
Also, there is a big demand for
good educational administrators
—"with emphasis on 'good'
"—because there are never enough
to go round.
But the demand for Ph.D.'s in
English, history and other liberal
arts fields will continue slack,
Keller believes, because "we have
reached and passed the oversupply
point already, regardless of the
state of the economy."
Part of this stems from the
increasing trend toward flexible,
non-major undergraduate
curriculums here and at other
universities. Another factor is the
government's continuing retreat
from its past high level of research
funding.
