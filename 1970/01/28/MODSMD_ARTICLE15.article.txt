# CSB Joins Drive To Recruit Minorities
## 
### 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business has joined eight of the
nation's leading graduate business
schools in a concerted drive to
bring more minority group
members into management
careers.
Formed as the Council for
Opportunity in Graduate
Management Education
(COGME), the group of nine West
Coast and Eastern schools is
intent on "substantially
increasing" minority interest and
enrollment in management study
at the graduate level.
The Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation announced it has
awarded COGME an initial grant
of $1 million to be used for
student financial aid and to
support and strengthen present
programs for minorities at the
participating schools.
The Foundation said the grant
was intended to "sustain the
Council through its first year
while it seeks substantially larger
funds from other sources for
support of students and other
pru poses."
Other Mem hers
Members of COGME, in
addition to Stanford, are the
graduate schools of management
of UC-Berkeley; Carnegie-Mellon
University; Columbia University;
Cornell University; Cartmouth
College; Harvard University;
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology ; and the University of
Pennsylvania.
The COGME goal is to
substantially increase minority
enrollment in graduate
management programs over the
next five years. By 1975, it is
expected that each of the
participating schools will be able
to continue activities of this kind
without a joint effort of
COGME's magnitude.
The Sloan Foundation said its
grant "is the first major
commitment under a special
program of the Foundation to

improve the access of minority
group members to the professions
of management and medicine." It
said it anticipated that other
grants will follow.
A survey of 15 graduate
management schools disclosed, for
example, that of nearly 8,000
students enrolled, only 180, or
less than 2Vi percent, were black.
Other minorities are even more
poorly represented.
Widening Opportunity
"Enrollment in graduate
programs is a particularly
important way of widening
opportunity for management
careers," said Arthur L. Singer Jr.,
vice president of the Sloan
Foundation. "The minority
community does not have its
supply of young men and women
who receive their training
informally, by means of business
experience beginning immediately
upon graduation from college. To
the minority student, the
accreditation represented by the
master of business administration
degree may be the essential
starting point of a managerial
career."
The Council expects that the
anticipated expansion of minority
representation will require
adjustments by the schools
themselves. They may need to
review recruiting procedures,
expand special preparatory
programs, provide added
counseling to students, strengthen
placement services for graduates,
and adapt their curricula to fit the
special interests and career goals
of their increased number of
minority students. The Council
will serve as a new resource to
help the schools make needed
changes.
Stanford Business School has
more than tripled its minority
enrollment since last year,
increasing the number of students
from minority groups from four
in September 1968 to 14 in
September 1969, following a
nation-wide recruiting drive.
The chairman of the Council is
Dr. John W. Hennessey Jr., dean
of the Amos Tuck School of
Business Administration of
Dartmouth College. A chief
operating executive will be
appointed shortly. The Council
will be based at Columbia
University.
