# Chaparral Changes
## 
### 
The Stanford Chaparral will
produce a number of special
magazine issues and other
publications for the rest of the
year.
The first project will be a
cooperative effort with Grass
Roots to produce a booklet on
land use in the Mid-Peninsula.
Tentatively titled "Plowshares
Into Swords," the publication will
be offered for sale within two
weeks.
Future issues of Chaparral may
focus on the University's impact
on the environment, or on the
University's contributions to the
American Empire, according to
Michael Sweeney, head of the
Hammer & Coffin Society, the
organization which owns and
publishes the magazine.
Sweeney says that Chaparral
needs a business manager to help
find the financing for future
publications. The range of future
topics for Chaparral is not limited,
says Sweeney, but he admits that
his personal interest is "getting
down to the bone marrow of this
place."
