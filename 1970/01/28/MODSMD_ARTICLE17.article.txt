# Ecology Concern May Close Generation Gap
## 
### 
Adults can help close the
"generation gap" by joining with
youth in the campaign to improve
our environment, President
Kenneth Pitzer told the comstock
club in Sacramento Monday.
''Preservation of the
environment is an issue that
appeals enormously to young
people today," he said in
luncheon address. "It may well
replace the Vietnam was as a
unifying cause. We should join
with the young in a productive
partnership that shows that we
also care.
"The president of our country
and the governor of our state are
both clearly on record as favoring
programs to improve the conserve

our natural heritage. If those
programs falter when the costs are
tabulated, the reaction among
young people will be strong.
"Above all, we must be willing
to change where change is truly
justified. What is true on the
campus should hold for society at
large: reforms should be instituted
not because they are demanded,
but because they are justified."
He also noted that there exists
today "a distressing public and
governmental disenchantment
with higher education. It is vital
to the well-being of the entire
country that broad faith in higher
education be re-established, for
neither colleges nor society at
large can do well without the
other."
