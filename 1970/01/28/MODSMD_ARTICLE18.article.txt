# Kitchen Serves As Halfway House
## 
### MARK STARR 
28 men, all ex-residents of a
Veteran's Hospital psychiatric
ward, work in the Stanford
kitchens. Most of them live in a
small dormitory on the south side
of campus.
The hospital ethic, so large a
part of these men's past,
permeates the dormitory. It is
exceedingly quiet. The corridors
are conspicuously clean.
The corridor ashtrays are filled
with cigarettes, but there are no
butts or ashes on the floor around
it. The rooms are all singles, and
each is equally neat. A rumpled
bed or a full ashtray is something
to apologize for.
THE ROOMS are comfortable.
The veterans clearly feel this is
their home, yet the walls in their
rooms are usually bare. No
posters, paintings, or Playboy
nudes decorate them.
Most of the doors along the
corridor are shut. Camaraderie
exists, but privacy is a precious
commodity for men who have
lived in hospital wards.
The majority of the veterans
have little social life. Some
manage to get up to San Francisco
on their two days off. Most just
lounge in their rooms. They watch
television, play rUmmy, or just
talk quietly. A cup of coffee at
the Round Table is a big
excursion.
Their routine is pretty fixed.
Kitchen work is exhausting. Ben
Franklin's "early to bed" maxim
is the only way to survive.
The men are exceptionally
friendly, but few of them want to
talk to a reporter. Their privacies

have been rare, and they are not
anxious to bare their past
weaknesses or their future
aspirations.
Their sensitivity and
vulnerability manifests itself in
defensiveness. Only a promise of
anonymity gets them to talk
about what getting out of the
hospital and working at Stanford
means to them.
"NO MATTER HOW young
you are, living in hospital
psychiatric ward, it always seems
to be getting late in life," said
Ron.
Ron is not yet 30. He has
flunked cut of college, lost several

jobs, and been in serious trouble
in the army.
"The hospital isn't a bad
place," said Ron, "but it's tough
to look to the future when
everyone sits around obsessed
with their own problems."
"It's extremely easy to resign
yourself to staying in the hospital
forever," he added. "Sure, you've

always got your problem," Ron
admitted, "but you're protected
from life. A hospital provides a
tremendous amount of
institutional security."
"You lie there in the hospital,
collecting disability," said Frank,
"and you know you're a burden."
Frank is nearing fifty. He spent
over three years in the hospital.
"Washing pots and pans ain't
great," he said, "but I'm earning
money again. Hell, I'm even saving
some money."
"A JOB MEANS dignity," said
Ron. "I feel like I'm contributing
again."
"At my age with my history of

problems," said Frank, "not many
people are going to give me a job.
At least I'm getting a chance to
prove myself to myself again."
"I might be able to get a job in
San Francisco for minimum
wage," said Ron. "With no
money, I could afford a room on
skid row. How do you start life
over living among people already
beaten by life?"
Jim began to speak. He has
trouble collecting his thoughts. He
has been in and out of hospitals
for over 20 years, ever since a
piece of shrapnel punctured his
skull during World War 11.
"Stanford is a wonderful
place," he said proudly. Jim
leaned back in his chair. His t-shirt
climbed up his stomach, exposing
a gut bayonet wound. "I have a
nice room, nice friends, good
food," said Jim. "I guess I'll just
work here till I die."
Most of the older veterans seem
to feel that way. It's tough to
start over for them. Hospital years
are long years, and they can make
a man feel older than he is. The
younger veterans talk of other
places and jobs than Stanford.
"I HOPE to use Stanford as a
stepping stone," said Ron. "I
want to go back to school and
give the outside world one more
crack," he said.
"But if I can't make it," said
Ron, "I know I'll never have to go
back to the hospital. I'll just come
back to Stanford."

Stanford is unquestionably
giving these veterans a chance
they might never have had
otherwise. But Stanford's
magnanimity has limitations.
Until two months ago, the
veterans only received $1.27 per
hour plus room and board. They
now get $2.35 per hour while

paying reasonable sums for their
room and board.
The veterans provide Stanford
with a source of competent
low-wage labor. They are unlikely
to complain about their job. The
desire to do a good job coupled
with the fear of going back to the
hospital is too strong. Their

personal problems dominate their
existence. Collective concerns
such as unions are effectively kept
out of the Stanford kitchens.
Even in this most inflationary
of years, wages and labor unions
are trivial concerns to someone
who is getting the chance to start
life over again.

Until two months ago, the
veterans only received $1.27 per

now get $2.35 per hour while

paying reasonable sums for their

The veterans provide Stanford
with a source of competent
low-wage labor. They are unlikely
to complain about their job. The
desire to do a good job coupled
with the fear of going back to the
hospital is too strong. Their

personal problems dominate their
existence. Collective concerns

"The hospital isn't a bad place, but it's tough to look to the future when everyone sits around obsessed
with their own problems. "
28 men, all ex-residents of a
Veteran's Hospital psychiatric
ward, work in the Stanford
kitchens. Most of them live in a
small dormitory on the south side
of campus.
The hospital ethic, so large a
part of these men's past,
permeates the dormitory. It is
exceedingly quiet. The corridors
are conspicuously clean.
The corridor ashtrays are filled
with cigarettes, but there are no
butts or ashes on the floor around
it. The rooms are all singles, and
each is equally neat. A rumpled
bed or a full ashtray is something
to apologize for.
THE ROOMS are comfortable.
The veterans clearly feel this is
their home, yet the walls in their
rooms are usually bare. No
posters, paintings, or Playboy
nudes decorate them.
Most of the doors along the
corridor are shut. Camaraderie
exists, but privacy is a precious
commodity for men who have
lived in hospital wards.
The majority of the veterans
have little social life. Some
manage to get up to San Francisco
on their two days off. Most just
lounge in their rooms. They watch
television, play rUmmy, or just
talk quietly. A cup of coffee at
the Round Table is a big
excursion.
Their routine is pretty fixed.
Kitchen work is exhausting. Ben
Franklin's "early to bed" maxim
is the only way to survive.
The men are exceptionally
friendly, but few of them want to
talk to a reporter. Their privacies

have been rare, and they are not
anxious to bare their past
weaknesses or their future
aspirations.
Their sensitivity and
vulnerability manifests itself in
defensiveness. Only a promise of
anonymity gets them to talk
about what getting out of the
hospital and working at Stanford
means to them.
"NO MATTER HOW young
you are, living in hospital
psychiatric ward, it always seems
to be getting late in life," said
Ron.
Ron is not yet 30. He has
flunked cut of college, lost several

jobs, and been in serious trouble
in the army.
"The hospital isn't a bad
place," said Ron, "but it's tough
to look to the future when
everyone sits around obsessed
with their own problems."
"It's extremely easy to resign
yourself to staying in the hospital
forever," he added. "Sure, you've

always got your problem," Ron
admitted, "but you're protected
from life. A hospital provides a
tremendous amount of
institutional security."
"You lie there in the hospital,
collecting disability," said Frank,
"and you know you're a burden."
Frank is nearing fifty. He spent
over three years in the hospital.
"Washing pots and pans ain't
great," he said, "but I'm earning
money again. Hell, I'm even saving
some money."
"A JOB MEANS dignity," said
Ron. "I feel like I'm contributing
again."
"At my age with my history of

problems," said Frank, "not many
people are going to give me a job.
At least I'm getting a chance to
prove myself to myself again."
"I might be able to get a job in
San Francisco for minimum
wage," said Ron. "With no
money, I could afford a room on
skid row. How do you start life
over living among people already
beaten by life?"
Jim began to speak. He has
trouble collecting his thoughts. He
has been in and out of hospitals
for over 20 years, ever since a
piece of shrapnel punctured his
skull during World War 11.
"Stanford is a wonderful
place," he said proudly. Jim
leaned back in his chair. His t-shirt
climbed up his stomach, exposing
a gut bayonet wound. "I have a
nice room, nice friends, good
food," said Jim. "I guess I'll just
work here till I die."
Most of the older veterans seem
to feel that way. It's tough to
start over for them. Hospital years
are long years, and they can make
a man feel older than he is. The
younger veterans talk of other
places and jobs than Stanford.
"I HOPE to use Stanford as a
stepping stone," said Ron. "I
want to go back to school and
give the outside world one more
crack," he said.
"But if I can't make it," said
Ron, "I know I'll never have to go
back to the hospital. I'll just come
back to Stanford."

climbed up his stomach, exposing
a gut bayonet wound. "I have a
nice room, nice friends, good
food," said Jim. "I guess I'll just
work here till I die."
Most of the older veterans seem
to feel that way. It's tough to
start over for them. Hospital years
are long years, and they can make
a man feel older than he is. The
younger veterans talk of other
places and jobs than Stanford.
"I HOPE to use Stanford as a
stepping stone," said Ron. "I
want to go back to school and
give the outside world one more
crack," he said.
"But if I can't make it," said
Ron, "I know I'll never have to go
back to the hospital. I'll just come
back to Stanford."

Stanford is unquestionably
giving these veterans a chance
they might never have had
otherwise. But Stanford's
magnanimity has limitations.
Until two months ago, the
veterans only received $1.27 per
hour plus room and board. They
now get $2.35 per hour while

paying reasonable sums for their
room and board.
The veterans provide Stanford
with a source of competent
low-wage labor. They are unlikely
to complain about their job. The
desire to do a good job coupled
with the fear of going back to the
hospital is too strong. Their

personal problems dominate their
existence. Collective concerns
such as unions are effectively kept
out of the Stanford kitchens.
Even in this most inflationary
of years, wages and labor unions
are trivial concerns to someone
who is getting the chance to start
life over again.


"The hospital isn't a bad place, but it's tough to look to the future when everyone sits around obsessed
with their own problems. "
28 men, all ex-residents of a
Veteran's Hospital psychiatric
ward, work in the Stanford
kitchens. Most of them live in a
small dormitory on the south side
of campus.
The hospital ethic, so large a
part of these men's past,
permeates the dormitory. It is
exceedingly quiet. The corridors
are conspicuously clean.
The corridor ashtrays are filled
with cigarettes, but there are no
butts or ashes on the floor around
it. The rooms are all singles, and
each is equally neat. A rumpled
bed or a full ashtray is something
to apologize for.
THE ROOMS are comfortable.
The veterans clearly feel this is
their home, yet the walls in their
rooms are usually bare. No
posters, paintings, or Playboy
nudes decorate them.
Most of the doors along the
corridor are shut. Camaraderie
exists, but privacy is a precious
commodity for men who have
lived in hospital wards.
The majority of the veterans
have little social life. Some
manage to get up to San Francisco
on their two days off. Most just
lounge in their rooms. They watch
television, play rUmmy, or just
talk quietly. A cup of coffee at
the Round Table is a big
excursion.
Their routine is pretty fixed.
Kitchen work is exhausting. Ben
Franklin's "early to bed" maxim
is the only way to survive.
The men are exceptionally
friendly, but few of them want to
talk to a reporter. Their privacies

have been rare, and they are not
anxious to bare their past
weaknesses or their future
aspirations.
Their sensitivity and
vulnerability manifests itself in
defensiveness. Only a promise of
anonymity gets them to talk
about what getting out of the
hospital and working at Stanford
means to them.
"NO MATTER HOW young
you are, living in hospital
psychiatric ward, it always seems
to be getting late in life," said
Ron.
Ron is not yet 30. He has
flunked cut of college, lost several

jobs, and been in serious trouble
in the army.
"The hospital isn't a bad
place," said Ron, "but it's tough
to look to the future when
everyone sits around obsessed
with their own problems."
"It's extremely easy to resign
yourself to staying in the hospital
forever," he added. "Sure, you've

always got your problem," Ron
admitted, "but you're protected
from life. A hospital provides a
tremendous amount of
institutional security."
"You lie there in the hospital,
collecting disability," said Frank,
"and you know you're a burden."
Frank is nearing fifty. He spent
over three years in the hospital.
"Washing pots and pans ain't
great," he said, "but I'm earning
money again. Hell, I'm even saving
some money."
"A JOB MEANS dignity," said
Ron. "I feel like I'm contributing
again."
"At my age with my history of

problems," said Frank, "not many
people are going to give me a job.
At least I'm getting a chance to
prove myself to myself again."
"I might be able to get a job in
San Francisco for minimum
wage," said Ron. "With no
money, I could afford a room on
skid row. How do you start life
over living among people already
beaten by life?"
Jim began to speak. He has
trouble collecting his thoughts. He
has been in and out of hospitals
for over 20 years, ever since a
piece of shrapnel punctured his
skull during World War 11.
"Stanford is a wonderful
place," he said proudly. Jim
leaned back in his chair. His t-shirt
climbed up his stomach, exposing
a gut bayonet wound. "I have a
nice room, nice friends, good
food," said Jim. "I guess I'll just
work here till I die."
