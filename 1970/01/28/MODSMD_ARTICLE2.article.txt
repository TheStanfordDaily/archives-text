## Senate Passes 'No-Knock' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
The Senate, after three days of
stormy debate, rejected Tuesday a
bid to delete authority for
"no-knock" narcotics raids from a
pending drug control bill.
It then into a thicket
of amendments which the bill's
supporters said would change its
emphasis from law enforcement
to the social, scientific and
medical aspects of drug abuse.
The new debate was over a
series of five amendments offered
by Sen. Harold E. Hughes,
D-lowa, whose subcommittee on
alcoholism and narcotics has been
studying the issue.
The Hughes proposals would
lower substantially the maximum
penalties for use of marijuana and,
he said, "prevent duplication by
the Department of Justice of
educational, scientific and medical
research programs already under

way in the Department of Health
Education and Welfare."
Debate on the Hughes
amendments started after a flurry
of votes in which an attempt by
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., to
eliminate authority for no-knock
search warrants from the bill was
parried and defeated by a nearly
united front of Republicans.
On a 44-40 vote, the Senate
rejected Ervin's bid to table-and
thus kill-a substitute "no-knock"
amendment offered by the
assistant Republican leader, Sen.
Robert P. Griffin of Michigan.
The Griffin amendment
stiffened the conditions under
which courts could grant warrants
for raids without any warning,
such as a knock on the door, and
eased the doubts many senators
expressed as to whether the new
federal law enforcement tool
would violate the Constitution.

The Senate rejected, 50 to 35,
an Ervin bid to substitute his own
more stringent no-knock raid
clause and then, all other
parliamentary obstacles being
cleared, adopted the Griffin
amendment by a 70-15
vote.
Nixon Veto
WASHINGTON (AP) -
President Nixon formally sent to
Congress Tuesday his veto of the
$19.7 billion welfare-labor
appropriations bill and Democrats
countered with an accusation that
he is making the nation's children
bear the burden of inflation.
Democratic leaders of the
House and Senate moved swiftly
to the attack after Nixon's veto
message reached Capitol Hill.
They will try to override the
veto in the House Wednesday,
with the outcome in doubt.
Nixon, elaborating in
his message on the reasons he gave
when he vetoed the bill before
television cameras on Monday
night, said the $1.26 billion added
the bill by Congress, mostly for
education programs, is too much
in a period of serious inflation.
But in an apparent attempt to
make it easier for Republicans
who supported the increase to
uphold Nixon's veto, the White
House said the President would
accept a doubling of funds for the
impacted areas program of which
he has been sharply critical.
Jus tie e Hearing
C 1
WASHINGTON (AP) - Supreme
Court nominee G. Harold
Carswell told the Senate Judiciary
Committee Tuesday he is not a
racist.
"I have no notions, secretive,
open or otherwise, of racial
superiority," swore the
50-year-old appeals court judge.
Fighting to win confirmation,
Carswell also flatly denied that he
was an officer of director and of
all-white country club in
Tallahassee, Fla., in 1955.
However, under questioning by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., the nominee retreated
from an assertion that he was not
an "incorporator" of the club.
This opening day of hearings on
his nomination centered almost
instantly on Carswell's racial
views.
Press reports have detailed a

speech the Georgia native gave in
1948 in a losing race for the state
legislature in which he affirmed a
belief in white supremacy.
And, as the hearings opened,
the Washington Post carried a
report that Carswell helped switch
Tallahassee's golf club to private
hands in 1955 to avoid
integration.
Leaning forward in the witness
chair, Carswell told Sen. Roman
L. Hruska, R-Neb., a friendly
interrogator, that the words and
philosophy he expounded in 1948
"are abhorrent to me."
"I am not a racist," Carswell
added evenly.
As for the club, Carswell said:
"I was never an officer or a
director of any country club
anywhere.

eliminate authority for no-knock
search warrants from the bill was
parried and defeated by a nearly
united front of Republicans.
On a 44-40 vote, the Senate
rejected Ervin's bid to table-and
thus kill-a substitute "no-knock"
amendment offered by the
assistant Republican leader, Sen.
Robert P. Griffin of Michigan.
The Griffin amendment
stiffened the conditions under
which courts could grant warrants
for raids without any warning,
such as a knock on the door, and
eased the doubts many senators
expressed as to whether the new
federal law enforcement tool
would violate the Constitution.

The Senate rejected, 50 to 35,
an Ervin bid to substitute his own
more stringent no-knock raid
clause and then, all other
parliamentary obstacles being
cleared, adopted the Griffin
amendment by a 70-15
vote.
Nixon Veto
WASHINGTON (AP) -
President Nixon formally sent to
Congress Tuesday his veto of the
$19.7 billion welfare-labor
appropriations bill and Democrats
countered with an accusation that
he is making the nation's children
bear the burden of inflation.
Democratic leaders of the
House and Senate moved swiftly
to the attack after Nixon's veto
message reached Capitol Hill.
They will try to override the
veto in the House Wednesday,
with the outcome in doubt.
Nixon, elaborating in
his message on the reasons he gave
when he vetoed the bill before
television cameras on Monday
night, said the $1.26 billion added
the bill by Congress, mostly for
education programs, is too much
in a period of serious inflation.
But in an apparent attempt to
make it easier for Republicans
who supported the increase to
uphold Nixon's veto, the White
House said the President would
accept a doubling of funds for the
impacted areas program of which
he has been sharply critical.
Jus tie e Hearing
C 1
WASHINGTON (AP) - Supreme
Court nominee G. Harold
Carswell told the Senate Judiciary
Committee Tuesday he is not a
racist.
"I have no notions, secretive,
open or otherwise, of racial
superiority," swore the
50-year-old appeals court judge.
Fighting to win confirmation,
Carswell also flatly denied that he
was an officer of director and of
all-white country club in
Tallahassee, Fla., in 1955.
However, under questioning by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., the nominee retreated
from an assertion that he was not
an "incorporator" of the club.
This opening day of hearings on
his nomination centered almost
instantly on Carswell's racial
views.
Press reports have detailed a

speech the Georgia native gave in
1948 in a losing race for the state
legislature in which he affirmed a
belief in white supremacy.
And, as the hearings opened,
the Washington Post carried a
report that Carswell helped switch
Tallahassee's golf club to private
hands in 1955 to avoid
integration.
Leaning forward in the witness
chair, Carswell told Sen. Roman
L. Hruska, R-Neb., a friendly
interrogator, that the words and
philosophy he expounded in 1948
"are abhorrent to me."
"I am not a racist," Carswell
added evenly.
As for the club, Carswell said:
"I was never an officer or a
director of any country club
anywhere.
WASHINGTON (AP) -
The Senate, after three days of
stormy debate, rejected Tuesday a
bid to delete authority for
"no-knock" narcotics raids from a
pending drug control bill.
It then into a thicket
of amendments which the bill's
supporters said would change its
emphasis from law enforcement
to the social, scientific and
medical aspects of drug abuse.
The new debate was over a
series of five amendments offered
by Sen. Harold E. Hughes,
D-lowa, whose subcommittee on
alcoholism and narcotics has been
studying the issue.
The Hughes proposals would
lower substantially the maximum
penalties for use of marijuana and,
he said, "prevent duplication by
the Department of Justice of
educational, scientific and medical
research programs already under

way in the Department of Health
Education and Welfare."
Debate on the Hughes
amendments started after a flurry
of votes in which an attempt by
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., to
