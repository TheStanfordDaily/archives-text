## Cards Pick Parish In Draft 
### FRED MANN 
The barons of professional
football are in the midst of a two
day marathon hunt for college
talent, commonly known as the
Pro Football Draft. And through
yesterday's 182 selections, only
one Stanford player had been
tabbed.

All-American linebacker Don
Parish of Paso Robles was picked
by the St. Louis Cardinals on the
fourth round.
The 26 professional teams in
the revamped National Football
League completed seven rounds
yesterday, and will start selection
on round eight at 6:00 a.m.
today. In all, 17 rounds, (442
players) will be picked and invited
to try out for their team this
summer.
The selection of Parish was an
obvious one. Aside from
numerous collegiate honors, he
was named fifth among all
linebackers in the draft by Pro
Football Weekly which is
perennially accurate in predicting
coaches' choices.
Other Stanford players
rumored to be draft candidates in
today's session include offensive
guard Bob Reinhard, halfback
Bubba Brown (most likely to be
chosen as a defensive back),
offensive tackle Pete Seymour,
and defensive backs Dick Oliver
and Rich Keller.
Terry Bradshaw of Louisiana
Tech was the first selection, being
picked up by the Pittsburgh
Steelers. It was the first time in
six years the number one draftee
has come from the college
division.
Green Bay named Notre
Dame's Mike McCoy as their top
choice, and Purdue's fine
quarterback Mike Phipps was the
third man chosen, by the
Cleveland Browns.
Heisman Trophy winner Steve
Owens of Oklahoma was picked
19th, by the Detroit Lions.
Boston selected Phil Olsen of
Utah State (Merlin's little
brother), and the Buffalo Bills
reunited O.J. Simpson with his
college roommate by selecting
USC's A 1 Cowlings fifth.
