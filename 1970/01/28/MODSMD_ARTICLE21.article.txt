# SFS Matmen Here Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford's Terry Crenshaw,
who has suffered only one defeat
in two years of wrestling, will get
a chance to avenge it tonight
when the Tribe hosts San
Francisco State at 7:30 p.m. in
Encina Pavilion.
The Gators whipped the
Indians last December, and
Stanford has been undefeated
(6-0) since. The loss of Dave
Kopolow (118) for three weeks
due to flu will hurt the Indians,
but Coach Dave Reed still says his
team will be in top shape for the
conference meet March 6-7.
