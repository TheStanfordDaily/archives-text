# Compassion on the Job
## 
### CHRIS SHERMAN 
"I feel like we helped send
them there, and we owe it to
them to bring them back ... I
guess it's because I'm a mother,
but then I've always been that
way."
Its obvious that this Food
Service Manager did not need a
degree in psychology, social work,
or sensitivity training to feel
kindly and responsible toward the
employees from the Veterans'
Hospital.
But her compassion was not
without sophistication, "Just look
out into my kitchen, you can't
tell the men from the Veteran's
Hospital by the way they are
treated."
She was right. Everyone who
worked with them accepted them
as co-workers whose handicaps
could be alleviated with a little
consideration. The strain of
concern and patience runs from
the hashers and dishroom
employees to the secretary of the
Food Service administration.
SEVERAL YEARS AGO, one
veteran was almost fired, because
no one knew he was illiterate and
could not read the instructions on
the dishwashing machine. His
immediate supervisor made a
calendar, and drew in pictures of
dishes and equipment needed for
his particular assignment that day.
The only exceptions in their
treatment, according to the
supervisors, is that they will often
offer a second chance to men
from the Veteran's Hospital and
that care is taken not to push
them beyond their speed. There is
no special course or orientation
for the co-workers. They know a
man is from the VA when they
see Jim (Mr. Quisenberry) come in
with them."
Otherwise, the veterans are

normal employees: they received
the December raise to a minimum
of $2.31, a hike of 90c for some
(though their room and board is
now deducted, averaging $20 raise
a week). They have no restrictions
in their off-hours. They are
required to be cleanshaven. They
are free to discuss or join a union
though they are docked if they
attend meetings during their
working hours. They are paid at
the same time as other workers
and can cash their checks on
campus until they establish
banking outside. Some of them
save religiously, and may buy into
the Credit Union.
Mrs. Lois Trovillion noted that
most are very benevolent toward
their families. "They feel they
have not been able to do anything
for them so they share their
paychecks with them."
SHE ELABORATED on her
observations: ''They watch out
for each other, and tell me if they
think one of the others is off his
medication . . . the student
hashers are very warm and
sympathetic . . . the only times
the men from the VA leave us is
when they can't work anymore.
Sometimes the freedom goes to
their head."
LIBERALISM AND
TOLERANCE need only be
mouthed by higher officials. They
certainly do not have to practice
it. This is not normally a
high-minded business (are any?).
It has traditionally been a
non-union, grey collar work force
like hospital workers or
maintenance men. Low wages and
odd hours have been standard. It
has been the main center of
underemployment for blacks and
chicanos, the elderly and the
uneducated.
The jobs at Stanford at which

the veterans work, vegetable
room, porters, dishwashing and
potwashing, were filled before and
are filled elsewhere by transients,
illiterates and alcoholics; those
society has passed by. Mrs.
Karolyn G. Baskins said that
previously Stanford hired off the
street. The men usually had a
6th-Bth grade education. They
had a high rate of absenteeism and
turnover, lasting two or three
paychecks before drifting away.
WHY DO THEY like their
work? Mrs. Gaskins thinks that
the regularity of their jobs is the
most attractive feature. It often
takes longer to train them, and
they are reluctant to train for new
jobs.
"Many of them will stay with
us because they don't think they
could make it in the business
world. The people who move on, I
don't know. We may get them
past their phobias. But many have
been living with their fears all
their lives, and they hang on to
them."
Mrs. Trovillion described the
job's attraction as "an
opportunity to feel like human
beings. They've never been
accepted before."
Mrs. Gaskins admits that it
took time to learn how to work
with the veterans. "For years
people had the wierd idea that
anyone who had a mental
breakdown was dangerous. We did
have a couple of incidents eight
years ago. But now with Jim (Mr.
Quisenberry) there when they
want him, most people have
learned these men don't have a
dangerous bone in their bodies.
They may even be paranoid,
afraid of other people. Our
attitudes have changed, finding
out that they are not that
different."


"A job means dignity. I feel like I'm contributing again.'
