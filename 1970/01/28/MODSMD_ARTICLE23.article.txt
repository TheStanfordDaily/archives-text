The guard at the Veterans'
Administration Hospital entrance
nods as you drive through the
gate. The buildings are painted
with regulation military paint.
The green lawns are mowed to the
proper length. All is quiet and
regulated.
A small building, Ward 102,
houses the headquarters of the
most hopeful part of the recovery
program, the final step for many
patients. The Self-help Unit,
directed by James Quisenberry,
M.S.W., eases patients from the
hospital environment back to the
world in which they used to live.
Through the Self-help Unit,
veterans work in two sheltered
workshops on hospital grounds,
three gas stations, a restaurant,
and several schools.

on-the-job counselling and assume
responsibility for the performance
of the men.
Campus food directors now call
Quisenberry when they have job
openings. He then asks for
volunteers for the job from the
Self-help Unit. If Quisenberry
feels a volunteer is qualified and
ready to move out of the ward, he
goes with the veteran to Stanford
for the interview, shows him
around campus, and helps him get
settled.
ON THE UNDERSTANDING
that Quisenberry does not
recommend men with problems of
alcoholism, drug addiction, or
sexual deviation, the food service
does not look into the new
employee's privileged medical
history. Before starting work,
each man has a complete physical
examination to ensure that he has
no infectious diseases that could be
transmitted through food
handling.
Many of the men are recovered
psychotics and remain on
maintenance dosages of
tranquilizers. Psychosis is a
condition rooted in childhood and
adolescence. An active psychotic
state can be triggered by
disturbing experiences—an
unhappy marriage, the
confinement of barracks life, war
hazards. With proper treatment,
many psychotics can recover to
lead normal lives.
QUISENBERRY NOTES that
other food service workers,
particularly students, "have
learned to be helpful." They are
quite ready to help veterans learn
their jobs, and fill in for them if
they need help. Many of the
p os t - ps y c ho t i c veterans
"blossom" after some time with

friendly co-workers, according to
Quisen berry.
Food directors have learned to
type out detailed schedules for
each veteran, so that he is not
forced to ask for embarrassing
assistance. They also have learned
to notice troublesome signs in a
man's behavior, that may indicate
a need for medical attention. If
the notice such signs,
Quisenberry is always available for
immediate consultation.
QUISENBERRY DESCRIBES
his role as that of "an
employment bureau with clinical
considerations, with follow-up
and careful therapeutic work."
Stanford provides a structured
living and work situation where he
can observe the development of
good work habits in the men.
When a veteran desires to move to
a job off-campus and has
discussed it with Quisenberry, he
can look for a job on his days off
from the food service, which are
usually weekdays.
18 of the 28 men now at
Stanford, most of them older
veterans, are permanent Food
Service employees. The other 10
would like to take college courses
or move to other jobs, after
testing themselves at Stanford.
SOME MEN HAVE difficulty
adjusting to life outside the
hospital, where they may have
spent several years. A veteran with
this difficulty may need
temporary treatment, or he may
need to return to the hospital for
a longer period.
The attraction of moving on .to
new jobs and studies is strongest
for the young veterans, less
scarred by a long period of hospital
life.

each veteran, so that he is not
forced to ask for embarrassing
assistance. They also have learned
to notice troublesome signs in a
man's behavior, that may indicate
a need for medical attention. If
the notice such signs,
Quisenberry is always available for
immediate consultation.
QUISENBERRY DESCRIBES
his role as that of "an
employment bureau with clinical
considerations, with follow-up
and careful therapeutic work."
Stanford provides a structured
living and work situation where he
can observe the development of
good work habits in the men.
When a veteran desires to move to
a job off-campus and has
discussed it with Quisenberry, he
can look for a job on his days off
from the food service, which are
usually weekdays.
18 of the 28 men now at
Stanford, most of them older
veterans, are permanent Food
Service employees. The other 10
would like to take college courses
or move to other jobs, after
testing themselves at Stanford.
SOME MEN HAVE difficulty
adjusting to life outside the
hospital, where they may have
spent several years. A veteran with
this difficulty may need
temporary treatment, or he may
need to return to the hospital for
a longer period.
The attraction of moving on .to
new jobs and studies is strongest
for the young veterans, less
scarred by a long period of hospital
life.

A small building, Ward 102,

most hopeful part of the recovery

directed by James Quisenberry,
M.S.W., eases patients from the
hospital environment back to the
world in which they used to live.
Through the Self-help Unit,
veterans work in two sheltered
workshops on hospital grounds,
three gas stations, a restaurant,
and several schools.

on-the-job counselling and assume
responsibility for the performance
of the men.
Campus food directors now call
Quisenberry when they have job
openings. He then asks for
volunteers for the job from the
Self-help Unit. If Quisenberry
feels a volunteer is qualified and
ready to move out of the ward, he
goes with the veteran to Stanford
for the interview, shows him
around campus, and helps him get
settled.
ON THE UNDERSTANDING
that Quisenberry does not
recommend men with problems of
alcoholism, drug addiction, or
sexual deviation, the food service
does not look into the new
employee's privileged medical
history. Before starting work,
each man has a complete physical
examination to ensure that he has
no infectious diseases that could be
transmitted through food
handling.
Many of the men are recovered
psychotics and remain on
maintenance dosages of
tranquilizers. Psychosis is a
condition rooted in childhood and
adolescence. An active psychotic
state can be triggered by
disturbing experiences—an
unhappy marriage, the
confinement of barracks life, war
hazards. With proper treatment,
many psychotics can recover to
lead normal lives.
QUISENBERRY NOTES that
other food service workers,
particularly students, "have
learned to be helpful." They are
quite ready to help veterans learn
their jobs, and fill in for them if
they need help. Many of the
p os t - ps y c ho t i c veterans
"blossom" after some time with

friendly co-workers, according to
Quisen berry.
