# Goal Of The New Party
## Toward A War Free Zone 
### 
A new political party is forming
in the Stanford community with
the hopes of "serving as a vehicle
for criticizing and challenging the
basic values and institutions that
inhibit the freedoms and growth
of most people in our society."
The New Party, which now has
a "hard core" membership of
about 20, is being organized by
Martin Carnoy, professor of
education.
With its focus mainly on local
politics, the New Party plans to
emphasize three principles:
The right and responsibility of
each individual to be a self
determining being.
The guarantee of sufficience in
satisfying all people's basic
economic and physical needs,
equality of opportunity for all

men, women, and children, and
the freedom for each individual to
fulfill his human potential as he
preceives it.
The development of a rational
relationship between people and
their natural environment.
Total Restructuring
The ultimate goal of the New
Party, according to its statement
of philosophy, is "the total
restructuring of social and
political life throughout our
society, beginning in the local
community." New Party members
hope to decentralize political
power and involve poeple in the
decision-making processes that
governs their lives. Voting in
elections, the New Party feels, is
not enough.
Tactics will be varied. Party

members hope to bring neighbors
together in community groups,
where they could share problems
and ideas and discuss political
action. The party will also
attempt a "political re-education"
in local communities, showing
community members how social
change can be affected by the
individual.
The New Party also plans to
take an active role in local
elections. "Although it is not
solely electoral, it will not hesitate
to run or support local candidates
with whom its philosophies and
positions on issues coincide."
Not Vote-Getting
Though electoral politics is
considered important by the
party, Carnoy emphasizes,
"Getting votes is not the game
we're playing. It isn't mass voting
games. What is the sense of
sending people to office when
there is a structure that is
screwing people.
"Our major purpose is to make
people figure out how they can
get out of channels. You've got to
get them politicized on a day to
day basis, stop thinking about
political action in traditional
forms, figure out that most
politics is done between elections.

And once that is done they will be
able to figure out their lives. The
style is the object: it is very
important and in many ways
achieves the objectives."
Though the party has only 20
sure members at present, the
leaders are optimistic. "Let me
tell you what 20 people can do,"
says Carnoy. "Twenty people
took over the peace movement in
the Democratic Party."
The small numbers fit in with
the party's goal of being "as
unhierarchial as we can." The
chairmanship will rotate in order
to distribute power as equally as
possible.
For the immediate future, the
New Party is emphasizing two
activities, convassing
neighborhoods to "get a feeling"
of what the people are thinking,
and working toward establishing
the community— and the
University —as a war free zone.
Carnoy emphasizes, however
that the party will not become a
left wing of the Democratic Party.
"Our first meeting blew our
minds," he said, "because a lot of
Democrats showed up ready to
make us their left wing. We're not
going to do that."
