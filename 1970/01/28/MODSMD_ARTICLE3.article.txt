# Salary Issue
## TA's Want Talks 
### 
In a letter to Graduate Dean Lincoln Moses, two graduate student
leaders have demanded that the University negotiate about teaching
assistants' salaries.
American Federation of Teachers (AFT) representative Mark
Moskowitz and English Review Club President Jeffrey Youdelman
threatened "direct and immediate action" if their demands are not
met. They said they spoke "on behalf of all English teaching
assistants."
The letter, dated Jan. 27, damands that the University "enter into
negotiations with us on the principle that the level of take home pay
will be maintained for this year and that higher levels for future years
must be established.
It also asks that "the terms for all future contracts will be arrived at
through negotiations with our elected representatives."
The letter finally states that if these demands are not met by
Friday, "we will have no choice but to take direct and immediate
action."
The present controversy over TA salary developed after a recent
court ruling removing the tax exempt status of certain TA's. Thus, the
University has begun withholding salary. The TA's feel the University
is obligated to make up the pay loss, since when they signed contracts
with the University, they assumed that they would not have to pay
taxes.
The University position, as stated in a January 23 letter from
Moses, is that TA's are in less financial need than some students, and
tax liabilities for each TA are not exactly clear. Moses added that in
cases of hardship TA's could get financial assistance from the
University.
Youdelman is not sure what action will be taken if the demands of
the letter are not met. He says, "Work stoppage is a possibility."
A meeting of all English TA's has been called for Thursday to
discuss further plans if the demands are not met. The controversy has
centered on the English Department since this was the department
most largely effected by the tax.
Moses, having not yet received the letter last night, declined
comment.
