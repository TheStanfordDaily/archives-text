# Pitzer Acknowledges Pressure On Universities From Outside
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
President Kenneth Pitzer
acknowledged yesterday that his
support of academic credit for
ROTC represented a compromise
with disgruntled alumni, trustees,
and other outside friends.
"This is one area in which all
sorts of friends of the University
are concerned," the President told
a group of area reporters. "So, I
thought that if it was possible to
compromise with these groups it
was best to do so."
Answering questions in the
plush Board of Trustees
conference room adjacent to his
office, Pitzer reviewed some of
the major problems that face him
as he proceeds into his second
year here.
In his brief opening remarks he
said: "One of the major problems,
clearly, that the University faces is
a sort of lack of confidence of the
outside community.
Restore Confidence
"I think we need to restore this
confidence so that the University
can have the financial and general
support to carry on the duties it
should in the coming years."
Reporters focused on the
aftermath of Pitzer's Brigham
Young University athletics ban,
prospects for low cost housing,
handling of the Overseas
Campus office, and the choice of
student representatives for Trustee
committees.
Most attention, however,
centered around the ROTC
decision. The president was intent
on emphasizing the importance of
the university maintaining close
ties with the outside community.
Pitzer noted that
negotiations with the Defense
department over new ROTC
status based on last years
Academic Senate guidelines
proved fruitless because the
government thought officer's
training would fail under the new
rules.
No Special Pressure
"Considering this," the
President added, "I decided that
we should not break off these
relations." Pitzer was emphatic in
saying that no special Defense
Department or governmental
pressure affected his decision.
Reflecting on the propriety of
compromising with forces outside

the community, he said, "A
university is not a self-supporting
institution.
"It can thrive only through
support of the outside
community's gifts and tuition. It
serves a public function. But this
does not mean there should be
compromise when clear academic
principles are involved."
In another line of questioning,
Pitzer agreed that University
administrators tend to become
entrenched in their positions after
a number of years on the job.
Administrators sometimes
"become less open to changing
their programs after they've been
in the same position for some
time," Pitzer commented.
Review of Overseas Program
In particular, Pitzer said he
recognized student discontent
about the operation of the
Overseas Campus program, and
added that the administration of
the program will be closely
reviewed by himself, Provost

Richard , Lyman, and the
soon-to-be appointed Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
Pitzer praised Director of
Overseas Campuses Robert
Walker, saying he has done "a
magnificent job." Dr. Walker has a
tremendous amount of
background knowledge on the
operation of the campuses."
Pitzer emphasized that Walker's
"knowledge and expertise are
needed, no matter how the
program might be reorganized."
On three other controversial
issues, athletic contests with BYU,
low-cost housing, and student
nominations to the Trustee
committees, Pitzer reaffirmed
previous petitions.
"I didn't expect it (the BYU
decision) to receive as much
attention as it did," he said.
Advance Notification
"In the future I think it would
be good to notify some of our
friends in the University about
these types of things and not

make them read it in the
newspapers. We should talk to
trustees, alumni, and others."
Turning to student nominations
for Trustee committees he
explained that the present
nomination procedure was partly
based on a need to maintain good
relations with the Trustees.
"I am more concerned about
getting a reasonable number of
the Board to agree to certain
measures than I am about passing
things on slim majorities. We need
the Board with us in spirit as well
as name."
On the subject of low-cost
housing Pitzer said, "I think the
University should make a real
effort to meet this need with
housing either on or just off
campus."
But he emphasized that plans
for construction should await
decisions by the Wright
Committee and the Trustee
Committee on Land
Development."

compromise when clear academic
principles are involved."
In another line of questioning,
Pitzer agreed that University
administrators tend to become
entrenched in their positions after
a number of years on the job.
Administrators sometimes
"become less open to changing
their programs after they've been
in the same position for some
time," Pitzer commented.
Review of Overseas Program
In particular, Pitzer said he
recognized student discontent
about the operation of the
Overseas Campus program, and
added that the administration of
the program will be closely
reviewed by himself, Provost

Richard , Lyman, and the
soon-to-be appointed Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
Pitzer praised Director of
Overseas Campuses Robert
Walker, saying he has done "a
magnificent job." Dr. Walker has a
tremendous amount of
background knowledge on the
operation of the campuses."
Pitzer emphasized that Walker's
"knowledge and expertise are
needed, no matter how the
program might be reorganized."
On three other controversial
issues, athletic contests with BYU,
low-cost housing, and student
nominations to the Trustee
committees, Pitzer reaffirmed
previous petitions.
"I didn't expect it (the BYU
decision) to receive as much
attention as it did," he said.
Advance Notification
"In the future I think it would
be good to notify some of our
friends in the University about
these types of things and not

make them read it in the
newspapers. We should talk to
trustees, alumni, and others."
Turning to student nominations
for Trustee committees he
explained that the present
nomination procedure was partly
based on a need to maintain good
relations with the Trustees.
"I am more concerned about
getting a reasonable number of
the Board to agree to certain
measures than I am about passing
things on slim majorities. We need
the Board with us in spirit as well
as name."
On the subject of low-cost
housing Pitzer said, "I think the
University should make a real
effort to meet this need with
housing either on or just off
campus."
But he emphasized that plans
for construction should await
decisions by the Wright
Committee and the Trustee
Committee on Land
Development."
President Kenneth Pitzer
acknowledged yesterday that his
support of academic credit for
ROTC represented a compromise
with disgruntled alumni, trustees,
and other outside friends.
"This is one area in which all
sorts of friends of the University
are concerned," the President told
a group of area reporters. "So, I
thought that if it was possible to
compromise with these groups it
was best to do so."
Answering questions in the
plush Board of Trustees
conference room adjacent to his
office, Pitzer reviewed some of
the major problems that face him
as he proceeds into his second
year here.
In his brief opening remarks he
said: "One of the major problems,
clearly, that the University faces is
a sort of lack of confidence of the
outside community.
Restore Confidence
"I think we need to restore this
confidence so that the University
can have the financial and general
support to carry on the duties it
should in the coming years."
Reporters focused on the
aftermath of Pitzer's Brigham
Young University athletics ban,
prospects for low cost housing,
handling of the Overseas
Campus office, and the choice of
student representatives for Trustee
committees.
Most attention, however,
centered around the ROTC
decision. The president was intent
on emphasizing the importance of
the university maintaining close
ties with the outside community.
Pitzer noted that
negotiations with the Defense
department over new ROTC
status based on last years
Academic Senate guidelines
proved fruitless because the
government thought officer's
training would fail under the new
rules.
No Special Pressure
"Considering this," the
President added, "I decided that
we should not break off these
relations." Pitzer was emphatic in
saying that no special Defense
Department or governmental
pressure affected his decision.
Reflecting on the propriety of
compromising with forces outside

the community, he said, "A
university is not a self-supporting
institution.
"It can thrive only through
support of the outside
community's gifts and tuition. It
serves a public function. But this
does not mean there should be
compromise when clear academic
principles are involved."
