# President Meets The Press
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
I almost tripped over the deep
piled rugs as I walked into
Building 10. I stood in the
reception area with my
motorcycle helmet in hand
waiting for someone to notice me.
Finally I stopped a secretary
slurrying by with a handful of
papers.
"Excuse me," I began, "I'm
from the Daily, could you tell me
where President Pitzer's press
conference is going to be held?"
She looked at my blue jeans
and helmet, then asked,"What
press conference?"
"The one at 3, in fifteen
minutes. I'm sure its today," I
said, beginning to wonder if I'd
blown it.
The secretary asked around the
office. No one knew anything
about it—press conference? here?
in fifteen minutes?
I called the Daily . The editor
assured me it was today and to
stick with it. "Call me back if you
have any trouble," he said and
hung up.
The secretary came up and said
yes, I was right and showed me to
the Board of Trustees meeting
room. She went out and returned
with a tall ceramic coffee pot.
Real Board Room
I looked around the room;
pictures of presidents and board
members hang on a wall, maps of
Stanford land fill another. The
room is dominated, however, by a
large rectangular table surrounded
with high-backed chars—a real
board room.
Pete Carey from the San Jose
Mercury came in next with a
photographer.
"What's this all about today?"
he asked. "I'm subbing for
someone else."
Just then James McNabb from
the Palo Alto Times walked in
wearing a bright purple tie and
carrying a green spiral. Carey and
McNabb started talking.
"Campus reporting is pretty
interesting," remarked McNabb.
"Always something different."
McNabb regularly covers
campus events for the Times and
has been ejected from several SDS
meetings by radicals who object

to his stories. The Times
photographer was Gene Tupper
who was assulted last spring while
trying to take picutres of
protestors at an SRI
demonstration in the Industrial
Park.
Bob Beyers of the University
News Service entered and told us
that Pitzer didn't have any
announcements but would answer
questions. Someone muttered,
"that's what we were afraid of."
"Maybe we can do this by
topics, start off with BYU,"
suggested Carey. McNabb agreed.
The rest of the Daily
contingent arrived: outgoing
editor Mark Weinberger,
editor-elect Margie Wolf and news
director Bill Freivogel.
"I've got piles of questions,"
said Mark.
Enter Pitzer
Pitzer walked in moments later
followed by Beyers and sat down
at the end of the long table.
"Say that's quite a necktie, Jim
(McNabb)" he said, before making
a short statement on the public's
lack of confidence in the
university community.
The cameras began clicking at
the other end of the room as he
referred to a few sheets of paper
in front of him.
Carey led off the questioning
with the BYU decision.
Weinberger followed up. "Would
you have done it differently,
looking back now?" he asked.
Pitzer leaned back in his chair,
a slight smile crept across his face,
"Well, I'd have Lyle Nelson
(Director of University Relations)
here instead of in India. . ~" he
remarked.
Carey continued on the subject,
questioning the support he
received. All the reporters pens
were busy except Weinbergers'.
Pitzer picked up a paper clip and
began toying with it. Carey
continued on; "I don't want to
drive the subject into the ground,
but. . ."he continued.
ROTC
The Daily editor changed the
subject to the ROTC decision.
Pitzer leaned back in his chair
again, with the paper clip. He
replied in a friendly manner

characteristic of the entire
conference, "It's like this Mark. .
he began.
Weinberger probed further into
ROTC, Pitzer elaborated using
lots of hand gestures to emphasize
his points. One of the cameras was
still clicking, the other
photographer was leaning back in
his chair, his camera on the table.
McNabb continued with ROTC,
all the pens were going, Pitzer had
taken his glasses off and held
them in his hand. Beyers had a
little tape recorder sitting on the
table aimed at the President.
Freivogel switched the subject,
asking a tough question on the
decision making process. Pitzer
stopped for a moment, thinking.
He didn't have an answer ready
and replied in general terms until
he formulated what he wanted to
say.
Tenure Not Simple
Carey asked hirn about his
tenure as Stanford's president.
Pitzer smiled, then laughed. "It
hasn't been simple," he said.
Carey asked him to elaborate. "I
won't speculate any further,"
responded the President smiling.
Weinberger began to ask about
low-cost housing, Pitzer
interrupted.
"There's no such thing as
low-cost housing," he said.
"Subsidized rental housing
maybe."
"Well, OK, subsidized rental
housing then," said the Daily
editor beginning again with
Pitzer's phrase. The President
threw back his head and laughed.
The questioning continued.
Beyers left to look up a figure, the
photographers wanted to leave
but Carey motioned his to stay.
Weinberger prompted a few
questions out of his news director
on topics that had been left out.
The press conference ended an
hour and ten minutes after it
began. Weinberger left, Carey got
up. McNabb had a few more
questions on BYU. Freivogel tried
one more on ROTC.
"I'm afraid I got lost in your
question" said Pitzer.
After a few final photos Pitzer
picked up his papers and glasses
and left.
