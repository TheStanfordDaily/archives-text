# Committee Reviews Political Union Debt
## 
### 
Roger Reed's joust with the
Student Senate over the
responsibility for debts incurred
by the Political Union continued
last night. It is currently under
review by a special committeof
the Senate, which will meet in
closed session Thursday to make a
final recommendation.
Last spring, contracts in the
name of the ASSU bringing Barry
Goldwater and Harrison Salisbury
to campus were signed by Reed
and Charles Morris, then
temporary presidents of the
Political Union. Student Financial
Manager David Swift was not
consulted, and did not sign any of
the contracts.
According to the ASSU by-laws
for the Political Union, only the
Student Financial Manager is
empowered to sign contracts
which will require spending ASSU
funds. The accumulated debt of
the Political Union is over $4700.
Statement Signed
This fall after Reed was
confirmed as a member of the
Political Union board by a duly
authorized committee of the
ASSU Senate, Reed was required
to sign a statement last October
13 saying that he had read and
was familiar with the ASSU
by-laws.

Reed subsequently contracted
to have William Burkley speak on
campus for a fee of $2000.
"What is at stake is the ability
of the ASSU to honor its debts,"
asserted Pat Shea, ASSU
President, at a meeting of the
Senate's special committee last
night.
"What do you plan to do?" he
asked Reed.
Reed said he hoped ASSU
funds could be used.
Long Term Effects
Shea emphasized that there are
many groups on campus with
"more important long-term
effects" than the Political Union,
and the ASSU should budget its
funds giving these groups higher
priority.
William Buckley's $2000 fee, is
being raised by the Political Union
Board from private contributions.
"I assure you that I acted in
good faith, (signing the
contracts)" Reed asserted. "I
think it should be brought out
that I didn't know about the
by-laws. But when you view this
thing in perspective, I think the
speaker program is something to
be proud of."
The Political Union Board now
has no money, as the Student
Senate has not yet passed this
year's budget.
