# The 						Academic Senate
## Fate of SES Report on Study Abroad 
### Barry Askinas 
The Study of Education at
Stanford recommended that the
Academic Senate create five
seperate Overseas Campuses
Committees, one for each
European campus, plus an over-all
co- ordinating committee. Each
separate committee would
formulate policy and select the
faculty for its own campus. This
arrangement would have insured
that each campus would develop
on its own, reversing the current
tendency for the five programs to
be standardized under the central
control of the Overseas Campuses
Office.
This committee structure
would have also effectively ended
a patronage system of faculty
selection for the campuses. Much
of Dr. Walker's administrative
power had depended upon his
control of the election process.
Over the years, a number of
professors have become indebted
to the director for providing what
some faculty have converted into
a six-month paid vacation in
Europe.
In a tension-filled meeting this
fall quarter, the Academic Senate
rejected this particular committee
structure. With Dr. Walker and
Economics Professor Lorie
Tarshis, one of his staunchest

faculty Â«nDporters, sitting in the
guest seats on one side of the
room, and members of the SES
Topic Committee that had
investigated the Overseas
Campuses Program sitting on the
other, the senate adopted a
committee charge which
established a strong central
Overseas Campuses Committee
with a relatively weak
subcommittee for each European
campus. The strong central
committee inhibits the SES
recommendations, as development
of a particular campus along
individual lines is subject to the
veto of the central committee.
Also, the method of
appointment for membership on
subcommittees avoids the
selection and screening process
used by both the Academic
Senate's Committee on
Committees and the ASSU
Student Senate Committee on
nominations for choosing faculty
and student members on regular
Academic Senate Committees.
Some students have expressed the
fear that students highly critical
of Dr. Walker's policies would be
kept off the campus
subcommittees.
The Committee on Committees
had originally presented two

separate charges to the Academic
Senate as alternatives for the
Overseas Campuses committee
structure; A majority report
authored by Vice-Provost Howard
Brooks who has worked closely
with Dr. Walker in negotiating
many of the overseas contracts,
and a minority report authored by
law professor Tom Ehrlich who
was chairman of the SES topic
committee that studied the
foreign studies program in depth.
Not surprisingly, the Brooks
charge to the Senate reflected Dr.
JValker's need for a strong central
committee in order to maintain
his central bureaucratic authority,
and the Ehrlich charge was a
virtual repetition of the SES

recommendations. Open warfare
on the floor of the Academic
Senate was avoided with the
submission of the compromise
resolution which consisted of the
Brooks charge with some minor
changes in wording.
Long term, the administration
has indicated that policy direction
of the Overseas Campuses will lie
under the authority of the new
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
with an assistant or associate Dean
of UGS working with the
Academic Senate committees.
There is also some hope that the
Overseas campuses each of which
have administrative and academic
directors present at the European
location will of themselves achieve

greater operating freedom from
the Overseas Campuses Office
here.
Unfortunately the university
administration would then be
placed in the difficult situation of
trying to find a new slot for Dr.
Walker, although there is some
question as to whether or not
administrators have tenure.
The alternative solution would
be for Dr. Walker to return to the
Political Science department
where he was a professor.
However it is not clear
whether he or the department
would welcome his return to
teaching.
