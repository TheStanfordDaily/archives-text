# The
						Draft
## Old Proposals 
### Jim Scarff 
Last week's article on "New
Draft Proposals" gave a
completely false picture of the
status of draft reform legislation.
From the top: ". . . of the new
developments is a bill sponsored
by Senator Kennedy and
others ..."
Senator Kennedy introduced
his bill in 1968. He re-introduced
it with a few changes in 1969, and
presumably has re-introduced it
again this year. In 1968, the
identical bill was sponsored in the
House by Frank Thompson, Jr.,
(D-N.J.). He sponsored the bill
last year (with 40 co-sponsors).
I spent last summer working for
Thompson trying to get his draft
law passed. I was coordinator for
a group of thirteen people (interns
& staff) whose sole work was to
lobby for this bill. Kennedy (with
30 staff people) did not have one
full-time employee working on
the draft. His office was unable to
provide us with any help because
they didn't have anybody who
knew anything about the draft.
No Extension
"Another provision of the
Kennedy b i 11-e x t ending
conscientious objection to those
who oppose war on other than
religious grounds (namely, moral
and philosophical)—has not been
commented on by the
Administration."
The "Kennedy bill" does not
extend the definition of a CO. Sec
315(a) of the bill reads:
". . . who, by reason of
religious training and belief, is
conscientiously opposed to
participation in war in any
form." As used in thus section,
the term 'religious training and
belief' does not include
essentially political,
sociological, or philosophical
views, or a merely personal
moral code, hut it does include
a sincere and meaningful belief,
which occupies a place in the
life of its possessor parallel to
that filled by an orthodox
belief in God.
The Kennedy bill would merely
:tdd on the underlined section to
the existing clause.
The language comes from the

Supreme Court decision in U.S. vs
Seeger (1965). That decision is
still in effect despite changes in
the draft law in 1967. Kennedy's
bill would not change the fact of
the law one bit.
The reason this change was
made is due to the fact that most
draft board members have never
heard of U.S. vs Seeger. Neither
General Hershey nor most of the
state directors of the Selective
Service System ever informed the
draft board members of the
decision. The Director of the
California SSS«nnounced that the
1967 law invalidated the Supreme
Court decision (wrong).
Sorry, No Chance
There are no chances that a
wider definition of a CO will
come out of Congress. Congress
was very upset with the Seeger
decision. In 1967 they changed
the CO clause by adding the
clause which tells what "religious
training and belief" is not. The
Joint Committee report made it
perfectly clear that they thought
and hoped that this new provision
would drastically reduce the
number of CO's. It is my guess the
Mendel Rivers and his lackeys will
do every tiling possible to further
restrict the CO clause.
If Congress decided to abolish
student deferments, it would
almost certainly phase them out
as was done with graduate school
deferments. No one now at
Stanford would be affected. The
phasing out of college and
occupational deferments would
not increase the draft pool as
much as most people think. I
disagree with Mr. Strain, for I do
not think the passage of a "draft
reform" bill would have any
appreciable effect on the chances
for a voluntary army.
I also think that the chances for
passage of a draft bill that would
be an improvement are negligible
(excuse the euphemism). And,
finally, for those of you v/ho
didn't want to be drafted into the
army, the SSS has thought of
something for you—you can now
be drafted into the Marines!
