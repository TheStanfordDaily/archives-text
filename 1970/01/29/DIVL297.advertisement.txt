Should a College Graduate
Consider SALES?
We think so!
There are hundreds of exciting careers. Marketing is one, a dynamic one, and
probably the major stepping stone to civic and business leadership.
At Xerox, our people are more than sellers of graphic communications equip
ment. They have knowledge of marketing strategy and insight as to how Xerox
copiers, copier/duplicators and related equipment can meet the needs of
modern business. They have a healthy regard for the importance of document
flow and its implementation in every size and type company. They are able to
advise businessmen at all levels on their present needs and to reasonably fore
cast future developments. Their thinking is business systems oriented, for this
is the wave of the future. That's why we require a college degree.
We have openings at various locations throughout the Western United States.
After comprehensive product and sales training, you'll become part of the
dynamic picture at Xerox, where operating revenues have increased from $40
million in 1960 to over $895 million in 1968, and employment has grown from
approximately 3,000 people in 1960 to over 30,000 currently.
Excellent salary and incentive compensation in addition to comprehensive
benefits including profit sharing.
