"Almost all men, in all ages and countries,
have at times made use of prayer. Thence
I reasoned, that, if all things were ordained,
prayer must among the rest be ordained.
But, as prayer can procure tin change in
things ordained, praying must be useless,
and an absudity God would therefore, not
ordain praying, if everything else was or
dained. But praying exists, therefore all
things are not ordained &c." Benjamin
Franklin.
