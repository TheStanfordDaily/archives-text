# Afro-American Studies
## Black Courses Stress Intellect 
### FRED MANN 
(Editor's note: The following is
the first of u three part series
detailing the current status of the
Stanford African and
Af to American Studies Program
started last year.)
Student demands for black
studies programs sparked much of
the campus violence on
universities across the country last
year. In response, many
administrators acquiesced and
programs were born.
The program at Stanford, like
many others, is now in its second
year of operation, but the
similarities end there. The
Stanford set-up is unlike most: it
was not formed under pressure,
the classes are taken mainly by
white students, and the program
refuses to be called "Black
Studies."
The program is entitled
"African and Af to-American
Studies," and it differs in many
ways from those at nearby state
colleges, and all around the
nation.. The emphasis here is on
academics.

"We are not a black studies
program," said the organization's
administrative assistant Gerald
Casimere. "In most cases, a black
studies department is community
oriented, and dedicated to
political action or neighborhood
help.
"We are rather interested in the
intellectual side. We are a study
group with standards vested in a
social science program," he
remarked.
Not Representative
The Stanford program is not
representative of the community
around it, and has not organized
for any action. There are 221
black undergraduates compared to
an even 6,000 whites in the
university. Most of the blacks are
from middle class families.
The African and Afro-American
Studies program was founded last
year on the recommendation of a
112 ac u 11 y - student committee
established by the university.
Although Stanford has had its
share of student demonstrations
in the recent past, the question of
education about the black people

has never been the cause of
trouble. But incidents elsewhere
have affected Stanford.
"I'm sure black studies became
a live issue here because it was
important at other schools," said
associate provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig. "The committee's
decision to form our program was
undoubtedly influenced by
actions at different universities."
Separate Courses
The program is
inter-departmental with courses
being offered in numerous
disciplines. Each academic
department may form a course
with the center of study
concerning blacks whether it be in
history, literature, or something
else. These courses make up the
African and Afro-American
Studies program, and students
wishing to major in the program
receive degrees from a particular
academic department stating
"special emphasis on African and
Afro-American Studies."
Thus one student becomes a
history major "with emphasis"

while another specializes in
philosophy "with emphasis."
Currently, only one or two
classes are being offered by most
departments, and the program is a
small one. "We are not very happy
with some departments,"
commented Casimere. "The art
and English people could be doing
a lot more for our project."
Head of the program is St. Clair
Drake, professor of anthropology
and sociology and author of Black
Metropolis, the sutdy of ghetto
conditions in Chicago. Drake,
formerly head of the Department
of Sociology at the University of
Ghana, has directed the operation
since its inception last September.
Satisfy Requirements
It is difficult to determine the
actual size of the program since
many students take the
program-approved classes without
intending to major in the black
studies field. Some take the
course merely to satisfy the
requirements of the department
offering it, and not for a program
degree.
Last year, 15 students declared
African and Afro-Am e r i c a n
Studies majors. There are now
some 10 courses offered in
African Studies and 12 on the
Afro-American side. The unequal
emphasis favoring the African area
of study is due to faculty
competency in this direction.

"We started out with African
experts in our program," stated
Casimere, "and that part of our
set up flourished, but there were
no authorities in Afro American
studies witli educational
credentials. We have recently tried
to emphasize this most important
side of our program."
Since the hiring of professors is
done by the individual
departments at Stanford, there are
very few teachers adequately
versed in black subjects. An
instructor is a sociology expert
first, and a black sociology
specialist second.
The program itself has a budget
for hiring teaching assistants and
secretarial staff only. There are
limited funds for course
development due to a one-year
grant from the Ford Foundation.
All professors in the program
must be provided by the separate
academic departments, and this is
the cause of a major problem in
the system.
Often departments do not have
the money to pay instructors for
teaching the additional black
studies classes. Teachers have been
reluctant to form classes and the
Afro- American studies offering
remains small.
(Part two will deal with the
classes offered in the program,
and student reaction to them.)
