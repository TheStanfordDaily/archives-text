# 'Crucifixion'
## The 						Lynching of Roger Reed 
### Mike Wolf 
At this moment certain
members of the ASSU
establishment are engaged in a
vicious campaign of political
persecution against Political
Union Chairman Roger Reed. A
group of Senate radicals led by
John Shoch and Yale Braunstein
(other members: Paul Witt, Rick
Atkins, Doug McHenry) and
supported by ASSU President Pat
Shea is using Reed's innocent
violation of a technical regulation
as an excuse for subjecting him to
intense political harrassment. The
radicals are ostensibly trying to
get Reed punished as severely as
possible for failing to secure the
routine approval of the Financial
Manager on some contracts he
signed last spring. The real reason
the group is pushing for Reed's
punishment, however, is that they
hate his guts on account of his
political views and they're
determined to get him into as
much trouble as they can. In the
name of the students of Stanford
University this gang is trying to
pervert the legal process into a
neat little personal crucifixion.
Reed has done nothing
dishonorable and is guilty of
absolutely no deliberate
wrongdoing. He has, on the other
hand, excited the fury of Shoch &
Co. with a series of outspoken
denunciations of their activities in
the Senate. The real substance of
the "Reed Affair" is only the
shitty personal revenge of these
"senators."
The contracts in question were
signed by Reed last spring for
speeches during last quarter's
Political Union Symposium by
Harrison Salisbury and Barry
Goldwater. Reed failed to comply
with an ASSU regulation requiring
him to obtain the Financial
Manager's approval of the
contracts. A contract with William
F. Buckley was made in a similar
fashion in the fall, but since it did
not involve ASSU funding, it is
not relevant to the present
dispute.
Unaware of Rule
Reed was not aware of the
regulation requiring the Financial
Manager's approval. He had
previously negotiated contracts
for spring quarter '69
engagements with Carl Rowan and
Henry Steele Commager without
obtaining the Financial Manager's
approval, and believed that he had
only to follow the same procedure
with the Goldwater and Salisbury
contracts. The Rowan and
Commager contracts, however,
were made on the basis of funds
available in the Political Union
account; it was therefore not
essential that they be approved.
But the Goldwater and Salisbury

contracts were made on the basis
of the anticipated Political Union
appropriation for this year. They
therefore required approval.
Reed had no way of knowing
about the regulation. It was
explained in a handbook
distributed to the various ASSU
organizations only this fall. At the
time that he signed the Goldwater
and Salisbury contracts last
spring, Reed believed sincerely
and reasonably that he was
following the proper and
customary procedure.
Good Failli
Reed acted in complete good
faith. He had every reason to
expect that the projected Political
Union appropriation of
$4,500-$5,000 would be
forthcoming in the fall. It was
urgent that Reed negotiate the
contracts in the spring in order to
obtain Goldwater and Salisbury
for fall quarter's Symposium.
Unfortunately, the Senate lias
been extremely tardy in passing
the budget for this year (it has yet
to finish the job). The whole
controversy has been precipitated
by the coming due of the bills for
Goldwater and Salisbury before
the Senate has appropriated the
necessary funds to the Political
Union.
Preposterous Talk
At first there was preposterous
talk of holding Reed personally
responsible for the debt, then of
suing him, then of prosecuting
him before the Judicial Council.
Shoch and Braunstein were beside
themselves with glee. But what
had Reed done?
He had unknowingly violated a
procedural rule.
He had committed the ASSU

to a $3,500 debt for which it had
not yet allocated funds, although
the figure was easily within the
budget projected for the Political
Union by the Finance Committee,
and though Reed could
reasonably anticipate that the
funds would be appropriated in
time to meet the contracts.
Most Successful Program
He had led the Political Union
in the design and presentation of
the most successful speaker
program the campus has seen in
recent years, bringing Mayor
Alioto, Lt. Gov. Reinecke, Dr.
Russell Kirk, and Congressman
Tunney, as well as Senator
Goldwater and Mr. Salisbury, to
Stanford for last quarter's
Symposium.
He had worked like a dog for
days on end arranging to bring
other distinguished speakers from
all points of the political spectrum
to Stanford.
But he had also written a
number of articles in The Arena
lambasting the ASSU and the
Senate for their radical politics,
and he had publicly charged the
leadership of the Senate with
irresponsible behavior, and he was
an extremely well known and
staunch conservative, and he was
personally, as well as politically,
objectionable to John Shoch, Yale
Braunstein, Paul Witt, Rick
Atkins, and Doug McHenry â€”to
mention just a few of the enemies
he had made.
Self-righteous Cries
So when it was discovered that
Reed had broken a rule, this
high-principled group leapt upon
him with self-righteous cries about
bureaucratic necessities and
ethical precedents. It is smugly

insistend that if Reed is not
punished for his oversight, then
the precedent will have been
established that anyone may
spend all he pleases and charge it
to the ASSU. That is utter
nonsense and everyone knows it.
Since when does an accidental
violation of a regulation
constitute its repeal? And what
precedent for legal formality has
ever been set by Stanford student
government?
There is no way in the world
that anyone can honestly contend
that Reed is guilty of any breach
of trust or intentional
malfeasance. He has served
admirably, indeed exceptionally,
on the Political Union Board. The
trumped-up case against him is
motivated essentially by political
prejudice and personal
vindictiveness.
Shoch's 'leering troupe'
The Senate and the Financial
Manager, to be sure, have
legitimate cause to be concerned
about Reed's errors and the
Political Union's contracts. There
is nothing untoward about their
investigating the matter.
Moreover, the members of the
Senate certainly have reason to
resent some of Reed's statements
about them. But to allow personal
pique to mask fundamental
standards of equity and humanity,
to allow Shoch's leering troupe to
fuck Roger Reed because they've
decided he's got it coming would
be something far more disgusting
than anything we've seen around
here in a good while.

Atkins, and Doug McHenry â€”to
mention just a few of the enemies
he had made.
Self-righteous Cries
So when it was discovered that
Reed had broken a rule, this
high-principled group leapt upon
him with self-righteous cries about
bureaucratic necessities and
ethical precedents. It is smugly

insistend that if Reed is not
punished for his oversight, then
the precedent will have been
established that anyone may
spend all he pleases and charge it
to the ASSU. That is utter
nonsense and everyone knows it.
Since when does an accidental
violation of a regulation
constitute its repeal? And what
precedent for legal formality has
ever been set by Stanford student
government?
There is no way in the world
that anyone can honestly contend
that Reed is guilty of any breach
of trust or intentional
malfeasance. He has served
admirably, indeed exceptionally,
on the Political Union Board. The
trumped-up case against him is
motivated essentially by political
prejudice and personal
vindictiveness.
Shoch's 'leering troupe'
The Senate and the Financial
Manager, to be sure, have
legitimate cause to be concerned
about Reed's errors and the
Political Union's contracts. There
is nothing untoward about their
investigating the matter.
Moreover, the members of the
Senate certainly have reason to
resent some of Reed's statements
about them. But to allow personal
pique to mask fundamental
standards of equity and humanity,
to allow Shoch's leering troupe to
fuck Roger Reed because they've
decided he's got it coming would
be something far more disgusting
than anything we've seen around
here in a good while.
(Mike Wolf is a senior in
Political Science and former
President of the Stanford chapter
of the Young Republicans.)
At this moment certain
members of the ASSU
establishment are engaged in a
vicious campaign of political
persecution against Political
Union Chairman Roger Reed. A
group of Senate radicals led by
John Shoch and Yale Braunstein
(other members: Paul Witt, Rick
Atkins, Doug McHenry) and
supported by ASSU President Pat
Shea is using Reed's innocent
violation of a technical regulation
as an excuse for subjecting him to
intense political harrassment. The
radicals are ostensibly trying to
get Reed punished as severely as
possible for failing to secure the
routine approval of the Financial
Manager on some contracts he
signed last spring. The real reason
the group is pushing for Reed's
punishment, however, is that they
hate his guts on account of his
political views and they're
determined to get him into as
much trouble as they can. In the
name of the students of Stanford
University this gang is trying to
pervert the legal process into a
neat little personal crucifixion.
Reed has done nothing
dishonorable and is guilty of
absolutely no deliberate
wrongdoing. He has, on the other
hand, excited the fury of Shoch &
Co. with a series of outspoken
denunciations of their activities in
the Senate. The real substance of
the "Reed Affair" is only the
shitty personal revenge of these
"senators."
The contracts in question were
signed by Reed last spring for
speeches during last quarter's
Political Union Symposium by
Harrison Salisbury and Barry
Goldwater. Reed failed to comply
with an ASSU regulation requiring
him to obtain the Financial
Manager's approval of the
contracts. A contract with William
F. Buckley was made in a similar
fashion in the fall, but since it did
not involve ASSU funding, it is
not relevant to the present
dispute.
Unaware of Rule
Reed was not aware of the
regulation requiring the Financial
Manager's approval. He had
previously negotiated contracts
for spring quarter '69
engagements with Carl Rowan and
Henry Steele Commager without
obtaining the Financial Manager's
approval, and believed that he had
only to follow the same procedure
with the Goldwater and Salisbury
contracts. The Rowan and
Commager contracts, however,
were made on the basis of funds
available in the Political Union
account; it was therefore not
essential that they be approved.
But the Goldwater and Salisbury

contracts were made on the basis
of the anticipated Political Union
appropriation for this year. They
therefore required approval.
Reed had no way of knowing
about the regulation. It was
explained in a handbook
distributed to the various ASSU
organizations only this fall. At the
time that he signed the Goldwater
and Salisbury contracts last
spring, Reed believed sincerely
and reasonably that he was
following the proper and
customary procedure.
Good Failli
Reed acted in complete good
faith. He had every reason to
expect that the projected Political
Union appropriation of
$4,500-$5,000 would be
forthcoming in the fall. It was
urgent that Reed negotiate the
contracts in the spring in order to
obtain Goldwater and Salisbury
for fall quarter's Symposium.
Unfortunately, the Senate lias
been extremely tardy in passing
the budget for this year (it has yet
to finish the job). The whole
controversy has been precipitated
by the coming due of the bills for
Goldwater and Salisbury before
the Senate has appropriated the
necessary funds to the Political
Union.
Preposterous Talk
At first there was preposterous
talk of holding Reed personally
responsible for the debt, then of
suing him, then of prosecuting
him before the Judicial Council.
Shoch and Braunstein were beside
themselves with glee. But what
had Reed done?
He had unknowingly violated a
procedural rule.
He had committed the ASSU

to a $3,500 debt for which it had
not yet allocated funds, although
the figure was easily within the
budget projected for the Political
Union by the Finance Committee,
and though Reed could
reasonably anticipate that the
funds would be appropriated in
time to meet the contracts.
Most Successful Program
He had led the Political Union
in the design and presentation of
the most successful speaker
program the campus has seen in
recent years, bringing Mayor
Alioto, Lt. Gov. Reinecke, Dr.
Russell Kirk, and Congressman
Tunney, as well as Senator
Goldwater and Mr. Salisbury, to
Stanford for last quarter's
Symposium.
He had worked like a dog for
days on end arranging to bring
other distinguished speakers from
all points of the political spectrum
to Stanford.
But he had also written a
number of articles in The Arena
lambasting the ASSU and the
Senate for their radical politics,
and he had publicly charged the
leadership of the Senate with
irresponsible behavior, and he was
an extremely well known and
staunch conservative, and he was
personally, as well as politically,
objectionable to John Shoch, Yale
Braunstein, Paul Witt, Rick
Atkins, and Doug McHenry â€”to
mention just a few of the enemies
he had made.

the budget for this year (it has yet
to finish the job). The whole
controversy has been precipitated
by the coming due of the bills for
Goldwater and Salisbury before
the Senate has appropriated the
necessary funds to the Political
Union.
Preposterous Talk
At first there was preposterous
talk of holding Reed personally
responsible for the debt, then of
suing him, then of prosecuting
him before the Judicial Council.
Shoch and Braunstein were beside
themselves with glee. But what
had Reed done?
He had unknowingly violated a
procedural rule.
He had committed the ASSU

to a $3,500 debt for which it had
not yet allocated funds, although
the figure was easily within the
budget projected for the Political
Union by the Finance Committee,
and though Reed could
reasonably anticipate that the
funds would be appropriated in
time to meet the contracts.
Most Successful Program
He had led the Political Union
in the design and presentation of
the most successful speaker
program the campus has seen in
recent years, bringing Mayor
Alioto, Lt. Gov. Reinecke, Dr.
Russell Kirk, and Congressman
Tunney, as well as Senator
Goldwater and Mr. Salisbury, to
Stanford for last quarter's
Symposium.
He had worked like a dog for
days on end arranging to bring
other distinguished speakers from
all points of the political spectrum
to Stanford.
But he had also written a
number of articles in The Arena
lambasting the ASSU and the
Senate for their radical politics,
and he had publicly charged the
leadership of the Senate with
irresponsible behavior, and he was
an extremely well known and
staunch conservative, and he was
personally, as well as politically,
objectionable to John Shoch, Yale
Braunstein, Paul Witt, Rick
Atkins, and Doug McHenry â€”to
mention just a few of the enemies
he had made.
Self-righteous Cries
So when it was discovered that
Reed had broken a rule, this
high-principled group leapt upon
him with self-righteous cries about
bureaucratic necessities and
ethical precedents. It is smugly

insistend that if Reed is not
punished for his oversight, then
the precedent will have been
established that anyone may
spend all he pleases and charge it
to the ASSU. That is utter
nonsense and everyone knows it.
Since when does an accidental
violation of a regulation
constitute its repeal? And what
precedent for legal formality has
ever been set by Stanford student
government?
There is no way in the world
that anyone can honestly contend
that Reed is guilty of any breach
of trust or intentional
malfeasance. He has served
admirably, indeed exceptionally,
on the Political Union Board. The
trumped-up case against him is
motivated essentially by political
prejudice and personal
vindictiveness.
Shoch's 'leering troupe'
The Senate and the Financial
Manager, to be sure, have
legitimate cause to be concerned
about Reed's errors and the
Political Union's contracts. There
is nothing untoward about their
investigating the matter.
Moreover, the members of the
Senate certainly have reason to
resent some of Reed's statements
about them. But to allow personal
pique to mask fundamental
standards of equity and humanity,
to allow Shoch's leering troupe to
fuck Roger Reed because they've
decided he's got it coming would
be something far more disgusting
than anything we've seen around
here in a good while.
(Mike Wolf is a senior in
Political Science and former
President of the Stanford chapter
of the Young Republicans.)
At this moment certain
members of the ASSU
establishment are engaged in a
vicious campaign of political
persecution against Political
Union Chairman Roger Reed. A
group of Senate radicals led by
John Shoch and Yale Braunstein
(other members: Paul Witt, Rick
Atkins, Doug McHenry) and
supported by ASSU President Pat
Shea is using Reed's innocent
violation of a technical regulation
as an excuse for subjecting him to
intense political harrassment. The
radicals are ostensibly trying to
get Reed punished as severely as
possible for failing to secure the
routine approval of the Financial
Manager on some contracts he
signed last spring. The real reason
the group is pushing for Reed's
punishment, however, is that they
hate his guts on account of his
political views and they're
determined to get him into as
much trouble as they can. In the
name of the students of Stanford
University this gang is trying to
pervert the legal process into a
neat little personal crucifixion.
Reed has done nothing
dishonorable and is guilty of
absolutely no deliberate
wrongdoing. He has, on the other
hand, excited the fury of Shoch &
Co. with a series of outspoken
denunciations of their activities in
the Senate. The real substance of
the "Reed Affair" is only the
shitty personal revenge of these
"senators."
The contracts in question were
signed by Reed last spring for
speeches during last quarter's
Political Union Symposium by
Harrison Salisbury and Barry
Goldwater. Reed failed to comply
with an ASSU regulation requiring
him to obtain the Financial
Manager's approval of the
contracts. A contract with William
F. Buckley was made in a similar
fashion in the fall, but since it did
not involve ASSU funding, it is
not relevant to the present
dispute.
Unaware of Rule
Reed was not aware of the
regulation requiring the Financial
Manager's approval. He had
previously negotiated contracts
for spring quarter '69
engagements with Carl Rowan and
Henry Steele Commager without
obtaining the Financial Manager's
approval, and believed that he had
only to follow the same procedure
with the Goldwater and Salisbury
contracts. The Rowan and
Commager contracts, however,
were made on the basis of funds
available in the Political Union
account; it was therefore not
essential that they be approved.
But the Goldwater and Salisbury

contracts were made on the basis
of the anticipated Political Union
appropriation for this year. They
therefore required approval.
Reed had no way of knowing
about the regulation. It was
explained in a handbook
distributed to the various ASSU
organizations only this fall. At the
time that he signed the Goldwater
and Salisbury contracts last
spring, Reed believed sincerely
and reasonably that he was
following the proper and
customary procedure.
Good Failli
Reed acted in complete good
faith. He had every reason to
expect that the projected Political
Union appropriation of
$4,500-$5,000 would be
forthcoming in the fall. It was
urgent that Reed negotiate the
contracts in the spring in order to
obtain Goldwater and Salisbury
for fall quarter's Symposium.
Unfortunately, the Senate lias
been extremely tardy in passing
the budget for this year (it has yet
to finish the job). The whole
