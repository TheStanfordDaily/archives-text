## Rape of the Trees 
### Doug Graham

Number I—What's a tree to
you? Something to loaf under in
the summer, take under in the
fall? A cipher in the uninteresting
greenery passing swiftly by your
car window as you drive a
mountain highway? A poem
embodied? A natural resource, an
economic unit to be utilized to
make paper and lumber? Or do
you see a tree as a vital element in
the overall ecological balance of
our nation—even of our Spaceship
Earth?
However you see a tree, or
even if you're the type that never
sees one, you would be bound to
suffer many unpleasant
consequences if the trees were not
there for you to enjoy or ignore.
Why? Because healthy forests are
essentiaJ]ftto our economic life, to
our outdoor recreation habits, to
the existence of our water
supplies and therefore our
agriculture, probably even to the
weather and the very climate in
which we exist.
'Outstanding Job'
We Americans have done an
outstanding job of using up our
forest resources ever since the
Pilgrims landed. Today, in spite of
the best efforts of conservationists
over the past 80 years, the
relentless despoilation of our
forest resources continues in
many areas. We have subjected
our forests to poor logging
techniques—«nd over-logging? to
fire and to overgrazing? and now
we are beginning to choke them
to death.
From Los Angeles (the City of
the Future) comes a grimly
prophetic news item, of the type
that usually gets buried on page
52 because it doesn't really seem
so important; it is a story of 3,000
Ponderosa Pine and White Fir
trees that are being killed by
smog.
Kvcn ill 6,000 Feel
These trees are not in
downtown L.A. They are in the
San Bernardino Mountains, over
80 miles east of the civic center,
at an average elevation of about
6,000 feet. They are part of the
pitiful remnants of coniferous
forest that still cling to a few of
the more fortunately located
peaks in the Southern California
Mountains —almost "fossil forests"
if vou like: in the sense that they

are direct descendants of the more
lush and widely spread Californian
forests of the last Ice Age. They
have maintained their precarious
existence above the 3,000 foot
level in the San Bernardino
Mountains, where the annual
rainfall is adequate. During this
century the onslaught of fire and
logging has taken a severe toll.
Now the scattered remains of this
once-proud stand, still of vital
importance for its watershed and
recreational value to the
8,000,000 inhabitants of the Los
Angeles basin, are succumbing to
the same villain that is doing in
some 25,000 Angelenos every
year;air pollution.
You and Me
Here is a short course on L.A.
smog for those of you fortunate
enough never to have lived in that
benighted metropolis. The classic
L.A. smog, now that the refineries
have been muzzled, is produced
primarily by automotive exhaust.
Mostly not from Greyhounds and
P.I.E. trucks—mostly it's from
you and me. The unburnt
portions of hydrocarbon
molecules that escape your car's
carburetor, when trapped in
L.A.'s famous inversion layer and
acted upon by the equally famous
sunshine, provide all the
ingredients necessary for the
catalytic manufacture of ozone.
Ozone is the principal irritating
element in L.A. smog. A molecule
composed of three, rather than
the normal two atoms of Oxygen,
it plays reactive havoc with all
forms of life. An unkn own
concentration apparently kills
pine trees.
The disease, earlier known as
"crestline crud" or "X-disease"
(before the cause was identified),
causes a yellow mottling of the
needles. The needle life-span then
drops from a normal 4-5 years to
only one or two years. A general
and progressive weakening of the

tree's vigor occurs until it finally
succumbs.
Irreversible Trend
The trend is irreversible, at
least under the present smog
conditions. All that can be done is
to harvest the trees and at least
realize their economic value
before rot sets in. The forest
service is attempting to replace
the trees with other species
known to be more highly
smog-resistant. However, in light
of the fact that these particular
trees and their forebears have
spent the last 10,000 years since
the ice age adapting to their
particular ecological niche, and
the replacement species proposed
(Giant Sequoia and Sugar Pines)
have not, the probability of
success of the experiment is open
to question.
Meanwhile, folks, when the
rains come, the mountains tumble
down. And the people travel
farther every year in an
increasingly frantic search for a
little greenery under which to
spend their allotted two weeks of
living. And the lumber companies
continue selling timber to the
Japanese faster than they are
growing it. And our demand for
toilet-paper, newsprint and other
forest products grows
exponentially. And our demand
for water (provided mostly from
our forested watersheds) rises
geometrically as the population
expands arithmetically. And,
damn it, the skies get grayer every
year.
When will we ever learn?

tree's vigor occurs until it finally
succumbs.
Irreversible Trend
The trend is irreversible, at
least under the present smog
conditions. All that can be done is
to harvest the trees and at least
realize their economic value
before rot sets in. The forest
service is attempting to replace
the trees with other species
known to be more highly
smog-resistant. However, in light
of the fact that these particular
trees and their forebears have
spent the last 10,000 years since
the ice age adapting to their
particular ecological niche, and
the replacement species proposed
(Giant Sequoia and Sugar Pines)
have not, the probability of
success of the experiment is open
to question.
Meanwhile, folks, when the
rains come, the mountains tumble
down. And the people travel
farther every year in an
increasingly frantic search for a
little greenery under which to
spend their allotted two weeks of
living. And the lumber companies
continue selling timber to the
Japanese faster than they are
growing it. And our demand for
toilet-paper, newsprint and other
forest products grows
exponentially. And our demand
for water (provided mostly from
our forested watersheds) rises
geometrically as the population
expands arithmetically. And,
damn it, the skies get grayer every
year.

Number I—What's a tree to
you? Something to loaf under in
the summer, take under in the
fall? A cipher in the uninteresting
greenery passing swiftly by your
car window as you drive a
mountain highway? A poem
embodied? A natural resource, an
economic unit to be utilized to
make paper and lumber? Or do
you see a tree as a vital element in
the overall ecological balance of
our nation—even of our Spaceship
Earth?
However you see a tree, or
even if you're the type that never

suffer many unpleasant
consequences if the trees were not

'Outstanding Job'
We Americans have done an
outstanding job of using up our
forest resources ever since the
Pilgrims landed. Today, in spite of
the best efforts of conservationists
over the past 80 years, the
relentless despoilation of our
forest resources continues in
many areas. We have subjected
our forests to poor logging
techniques—«nd over-logging? to
fire and to overgrazing? and now
we are beginning to choke them
to death.
From Los Angeles (the City of
the Future) comes a grimly
prophetic news item, of the type
that usually gets buried on page

so important; it is a story of 3,000
Ponderosa Pine and White Fir
trees that are being killed by
smog.
Kvcn ill 6,000 Feel
These trees are not in
downtown L.A. They are in the
San Bernardino Mountains, over
80 miles east of the civic center,
at an average elevation of about
6,000 feet. They are part of the
pitiful remnants of coniferous
forest that still cling to a few of
the more fortunately located
peaks in the Southern California
Mountains —almost "fossil forests"
if vou like: in the sense that they

are direct descendants of the more
lush and widely spread Californian
forests of the last Ice Age. They
have maintained their precarious
existence above the 3,000 foot
level in the San Bernardino
Mountains, where the annual
rainfall is adequate. During this
century the onslaught of fire and
logging has taken a severe toll.
Now the scattered remains of this
once-proud stand, still of vital
importance for its watershed and
recreational value to the
8,000,000 inhabitants of the Los
Angeles basin, are succumbing to
the same villain that is doing in
some 25,000 Angelenos every

You and Me
Here is a short course on L.A.
smog for those of you fortunate
enough never to have lived in that
benighted metropolis. The classic
L.A. smog, now that the refineries
have been muzzled, is produced
primarily by automotive exhaust.
Mostly not from Greyhounds and
P.I.E. trucks—mostly it's from
you and me. The unburnt
portions of hydrocarbon
molecules that escape your car's
carburetor, when trapped in
L.A.'s famous inversion layer and
acted upon by the equally famous
sunshine, provide all the
ingredients necessary for the
catalytic manufacture of ozone.
Ozone is the principal irritating
element in L.A. smog. A molecule
composed of three, rather than
the normal two atoms of Oxygen,
it plays reactive havoc with all
forms of life. An unkn own
concentration apparently kills
pine trees.
The disease, earlier known as
"crestline crud" or "X-disease"
(before the cause was identified),
causes a yellow mottling of the
needles. The needle life-span then
drops from a normal 4-5 years to
only one or two years. A general
and progressive weakening of the

tree's vigor occurs until it finally
succumbs.

the same villain that is doing in
some 25,000 Angelenos every
year;air pollution.
You and Me
Here is a short course on L.A.
smog for those of you fortunate
enough never to have lived in that
benighted metropolis. The classic
L.A. smog, now that the refineries
have been muzzled, is produced
primarily by automotive exhaust.
Mostly not from Greyhounds and
P.I.E. trucks—mostly it's from
you and me. The unburnt
portions of hydrocarbon
molecules that escape your car's
carburetor, when trapped in
L.A.'s famous inversion layer and
acted upon by the equally famous
sunshine, provide all the
ingredients necessary for the
catalytic manufacture of ozone.
Ozone is the principal irritating
element in L.A. smog. A molecule
composed of three, rather than
the normal two atoms of Oxygen,
it plays reactive havoc with all
forms of life. An unkn own
concentration apparently kills
pine trees.
The disease, earlier known as
"crestline crud" or "X-disease"
(before the cause was identified),
causes a yellow mottling of the
needles. The needle life-span then
drops from a normal 4-5 years to
only one or two years. A general
and progressive weakening of the

tree's vigor occurs until it finally
succumbs.
Irreversible Trend
The trend is irreversible, at
least under the present smog
conditions. All that can be done is
to harvest the trees and at least
realize their economic value
before rot sets in. The forest
service is attempting to replace
the trees with other species
known to be more highly
smog-resistant. However, in light
of the fact that these particular
trees and their forebears have
spent the last 10,000 years since
the ice age adapting to their
particular ecological niche, and
the replacement species proposed
(Giant Sequoia and Sugar Pines)
have not, the probability of
success of the experiment is open
to question.
Meanwhile, folks, when the
rains come, the mountains tumble
down. And the people travel
farther every year in an
increasingly frantic search for a
little greenery under which to
spend their allotted two weeks of
living. And the lumber companies
continue selling timber to the
Japanese faster than they are
growing it. And our demand for
toilet-paper, newsprint and other
forest products grows
exponentially. And our demand
for water (provided mostly from
our forested watersheds) rises
geometrically as the population
expands arithmetically. And,
damn it, the skies get grayer every
year.
When will we ever learn?

Number I—What's a tree to
you? Something to loaf under in
the summer, take under in the
fall? A cipher in the uninteresting
greenery passing swiftly by your
car window as you drive a
mountain highway? A poem
embodied? A natural resource, an
economic unit to be utilized to
make paper and lumber? Or do
you see a tree as a vital element in
the overall ecological balance of
our nation—even of our Spaceship
Earth?
However you see a tree, or
even if you're the type that never
sees one, you would be bound to
suffer many unpleasant
consequences if the trees were not
there for you to enjoy or ignore.
Why? Because healthy forests are
essentiaJ]ftto our economic life, to
our outdoor recreation habits, to
the existence of our water
supplies and therefore our
agriculture, probably even to the
weather and the very climate in
which we exist.
'Outstanding Job'
We Americans have done an
outstanding job of using up our
forest resources ever since the
Pilgrims landed. Today, in spite of
the best efforts of conservationists
over the past 80 years, the
relentless despoilation of our
forest resources continues in
many areas. We have subjected
our forests to poor logging
techniques—«nd over-logging? to
fire and to overgrazing? and now
we are beginning to choke them
to death.
From Los Angeles (the City of
the Future) comes a grimly
prophetic news item, of the type
that usually gets buried on page
52 because it doesn't really seem
so important; it is a story of 3,000
Ponderosa Pine and White Fir
trees that are being killed by
smog.
Kvcn ill 6,000 Feel
These trees are not in
downtown L.A. They are in the
San Bernardino Mountains, over
80 miles east of the civic center,
at an average elevation of about
6,000 feet. They are part of the
pitiful remnants of coniferous
forest that still cling to a few of
the more fortunately located
peaks in the Southern California
Mountains —almost "fossil forests"
if vou like: in the sense that they

are direct descendants of the more
lush and widely spread Californian
forests of the last Ice Age. They
have maintained their precarious
existence above the 3,000 foot
level in the San Bernardino
Mountains, where the annual
rainfall is adequate. During this
century the onslaught of fire and
logging has taken a severe toll.
Now the scattered remains of this
once-proud stand, still of vital
importance for its watershed and
recreational value to the
8,000,000 inhabitants of the Los
Angeles basin, are succumbing to
the same villain that is doing in
some 25,000 Angelenos every
