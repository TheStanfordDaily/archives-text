# Alcohol Today: Long Dry Spell
## 
### DICK BUXTON 
(Editor's note: This is the lasl
part of a series on the history of
alcohol at Stanford.)
Prohibition came to Stanford
in 1909 and theoretically stayed
until 1966. In the early 1900's a
few years before the great furor
over liquor and its final banning
from Stanford a proposal was
made by two alumni of the first
graduating class of Stanford to
build an establishment entirely for
students.
These men envisioned an inn
located near the edge of the
campus which would have a grill
reserved for students without a
bar for hard liquor and no
toleration of excessive drinking.
Opposition developed from the
University and citizens of Palo
Alto and the idea was given up.
The project, notes Stanford
biographer Elliott, in 1937, was
"not entirely dismissed from the
student mind but canvassed anew
from time to time without
result-"

Indeed the idea was not
dismissed. For example in 1948 a
Daily editorial suggested serving
3.2 beer on campus since the
amended state law did not
prohibit such sale. The Stanford
Executive Committee urged in
1951 that pressure be put on the
legislature for an 18 year old legal
age for beer and wine.
Possession of alcohol in any
form remained prohibited at
Stanford, and in 1960 an ad hoc
committee on the drinkirtg
problem recommended, "that the
practice on campus be made
consistent with the state law to
the extent that those over 21
years of age be allowed to have
liquor in their quarters." The
recommendation was not
accepted. And even a student
referendum in 1962 seeking a
consistency of Stanford policy
with state law was over-turned by
Trustees.
Rathskellar
A student Rathskellar serving
beer was contained as part of the

original Tresidder Union
expansion proposal drawn up by
the Tresidder's first director
Charles Berry in 1965.
In 1966 the Committee on
Student Affairs and Services was
asked to explore the drinking

problem at Stanlord and make
some suggestions. Sixty years of
inconsistency and confusion
finally had a chance to be
straightened out.
In proposals submitted to
President Sterling the committee
proposed that University policy
become consistent with state law.
The committee mentioned the
Rathskellar with some reservation
but said that, "advantages merit
serious consideration by
university authorities." It is
assumed that the Rathskellar was
never mentioned in Sterling's
proposals to the Board of Trustees
but negative sentiment must have
reached the Board anyway about
such an idea because although
they brought university drinking
policy in line with state law they
also stipulated that "Alcoholic
beverages shall not be sold on the
Stanford Campus."
The remainder of the Trustee
policy permits use of alcohol only
in the interior of campus
residences and eating clubs and
provides that where alcholic
beverages are served non-alcoholic
drinks must also be provided for
non-drinkers and minors.
These are the present policy
guidelines concerning alcohol at
Stanford.
Kul Mot Faculty
Prohibition at Stanford has
never included the faculty.
However, last fall the Alcoholic
Beverages Control (ABC) sealed
the liquor locker room of the
Faculty Club for being operated
without a license.
The Faculty Club has been
"drv" for over two months and is

in the legal process of seeking to
obtain a specific license for
operating a club on campus. The
legal procedure is basically as
follows: The club applies to the
ABC of Santa Clara County for a
club license and then posts notice
and publishes a legal statement of
intent in the newspaper. A period
of 30 days is allowed for protests
to be filed with the ABC in
opposition to the request for
license. Mr. Forrest Tregea,
manager of the Faculty Club, said
that this 30 day period has just
ended and that the ABC will now
ask each opponent of the license
to complete specific forms and
statements elaborating reasons for
opposing the license. Sound basis
for opposition must be presented
not just subjective opinion.
Bu reacracy
A Daily article last week noted
various church and civic
organizations of Palo Alto which
protested the license during the
30 day period. Upon completion
of filing of formal complaints
with the ABC the Control
Commission appoints a hearing
officer and sets a date for a public
hearing at which time the license
seeker and the license protestors
will present their cases and the
officers will judge whether the
license should be granted or not
and will make recommendations
to the director of the ABC in
Sacramento for final decision.
The hearing on the Faculty
Club should be within the next
month and in the meantime the
club room at the Faculty Club
remains locked awaiting the word.


UNIVERSITY COFFEE HOUSEâ€”If the Coflee House is a partial fulfillment of the dream of a common >tmlciil meeting
place proposed by alumni 60 years ago, then within 60 more years 15.2 beer may be sold here. By that lime, no present
reader will need to worry about presenting an identification to get a beer.
