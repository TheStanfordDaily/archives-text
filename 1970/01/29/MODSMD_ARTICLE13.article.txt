# States Having Difficulty Filling Current Draft Quotas
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Selective
Service officials in 15 states said
last Friday it unlikely they will
be able to fill their February draft
allocations because of Federal
orders that they go no higher than
lottery No. 60. Officials in
another 15 states and New York
City said they are unable to
predict the effect of the ceiling at
this time. Officials in 16 states
and the District of Columbia said
they think they can meet their
quotas.
Officials in four states could
not be reached for comment.
In January the Selective Service
system suggested local boards go
no higher than lottery No. 30 to
try and insure that the lottery
numbers are called relatively
uniformly throughout the nation.
In Washington, a spokesman for
Selective Service national
headquarters, which ordered the
February ceiling Tuesday, said
state and local boards would be

expected to go no higher than No.
60 even if that left them short.
Answer
The spokesman agreed in
answer to questions, that if this
meant Selective Service
nationwide would fail to meet the
total Pentagon call for 19,000
men in February, then the
Defense Department would have
to seek additional men in a later
call to make up the difference.
Asked whether this meant that
the point of the February ceiling
was to determine whether, in fact,
the call could be met under such a
restriction, the spokesman replied,
"You've got it exactly."
Without the ceiling, there might
be a wide difference in lottery
numbers of men called by local
boards. The variance could come
when one local board has a large
pool of men spread evenly over
the lottery while in another
board's pool the distribution of
birthdays is far from the national
norm.

An example of the latter
occurred in Muskogee County,
Oklahoma where the board called
a youth who is No. 306. When
notified of the action the state
director sent out instructions to
cancel calls to anybody above No.
60.

But preliminary reaction from
state Selective Service officials last
December was that men with the
high - or relatively safe - numbers
could not count on escaping
induction this year.
In the survey on the February
draft call, the states where officials
said it appeared they would not
be able to make their quota under
the ceiling were:
lowa, Louisiana, Mississippi,
South Carolina, Alabama,
Missouri, Georgia, Florida,
Oklahoma, Illinois, Washington,
New Hampshire, Maine, Michigan,
and New York State, except New

men in February, then the
Defense Department would have
to seek additional men in a later
call to make up the difference.
Asked whether this meant that
the point of the February ceiling
was to determine whether, in fact,
the call could be met under such a
restriction, the spokesman replied,
"You've got it exactly."
Without the ceiling, there might
be a wide difference in lottery
numbers of men called by local
boards. The variance could come
when one local board has a large
pool of men spread evenly over
the lottery while in another
board's pool the distribution of
birthdays is far from the national
norm.

An example of the latter
occurred in Muskogee County,
Oklahoma where the board called
a youth who is No. 306. When
notified of the action the state
director sent out instructions to
cancel calls to anybody above No.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Selective
Service officials in 15 states said
last Friday it unlikely they will
be able to fill their February draft
allocations because of Federal
orders that they go no higher than
lottery No. 60. Officials in
another 15 states and New York
City said they are unable to
predict the effect of the ceiling at
this time. Officials in 16 states
and the District of Columbia said
they think they can meet their
quotas.
Officials in four states could
not be reached for comment.
In January the Selective Service
system suggested local boards go
no higher than lottery No. 30 to
try and insure that the lottery
numbers are called relatively
uniformly throughout the nation.
In Washington, a spokesman for
Selective Service national
headquarters, which ordered the
February ceiling Tuesday, said
state and local boards would be

expected to go no higher than No.
60 even if that left them short.
Answer
The spokesman agreed in
answer to questions, that if this
meant Selective Service
nationwide would fail to meet the
total Pentagon call for 19,000
men in February, then the
Defense Department would have
to seek additional men in a later
call to make up the difference.
Asked whether this meant that
the point of the February ceiling
was to determine whether, in fact,
the call could be met under such a
restriction, the spokesman replied,
"You've got it exactly."
