# African Studies Group Debates New Direction

### JONATHAN DEDMON 
"It was necessary for the African Studies Association to be slapped
in the face." Thus spoke Leonard Jeffreys, professor of African
history at San Jose State, in a recent panel at Stanford on the 1969
African Studies Association (ASA) conference in Montreal.
The panel, organized by Mel Hendrix, a graduate student in African
history at Stanford, although dealing specifically with the Montreal
conference and its physical disruption by black members, considered
the whole question of the direction and control of African
scholarship, specifically in the ASA.
Hendrix sees the panel as the first of many meetings of concerned
African scholars. Eventually, Hendrix hopes to form a group of
persons, mainly students interested in the whole question of African
studies, although his plans in this area are not yet definite.
The panel itself, attended by about 50 people, had four speakers:
Wesley Johnson, professor of African history at Stanford; David
Abernethy, professor of political science at Stanford; Leonard
Jeffreys, professor of African history at San Jose State, and Martin
Klein, professor in Black Studies at Berkeley.
Dr. Johnson gave a brief history of the ASA. When the ASA was
founded in 1 962, said Johnson, "It was a essentially a club of scholars
interested in Africa." "In the eight years since the founding,
continued Johnson, there has been little change. The power still rests
in the hands of the well-meaning scholars who founded the
organization. . ."There has been almost no effort to recruit youths or
blacks, or form any policy vis-a-vis the black community."
Johnson feels, however, that the Black Caucus, black ASA members
who disrupted the Montreal conference, has now created a "new
climate in which to reexamine the policies of the ASA." According to
Dr. Johnson, the ASA had been formed at the end of the African
colonial period and hence had a definite perspective on Africa.
Johnson feels that whereas the position of Africa and blacks in the
world changed drastically, the ASA did not keep up with these
changes in its outlook. Thus, the disruptions at Montreal resulted

from the fact that "History finally caught up with '
the ASA."
Dr. Abernethy said his own reaction to the
conference was that there were many issues in
African history which were not specifically racially
oriented, and that perhaps the blacks were
attempting to view Africa as more of a "question
of the black experience in and outside of Africa"
rather than as a geographical area, which he felt it
was the prupose of the ASA to view it as.
Abernethy also called the Black Caucus demand of
50% representation on the board of directors of
ASA unfair, since it would be giving some member
2 votes.
In Reaction
Professor Jeffreys, to Abernethy, said that the
Black Caucus demands and actions at Montreal
were a "needed slap in the face to the ASA," an
organization which he called "an extreme form of
institutionalized racism." In his opinion it was
only natural that the study of African history be
eventually controlled by blacks. Thus it was
necessary to eliminate the "white mafia" which
controls the study of African history in the ASA.
Martin Klein also felt that the ASA as it
presently existed was a form of institutionalized
racism and that although he was against quota
systems, "perhaps the 50-50 split proposed by the
Black Caucus or some similar constitutional
change is necessary to eliminate institutionalized
racism from the ASA."
The final speaker, not on the program, was
black poet and teacher at Stanford, Sotere E!
Turregian, who said that the questions raised at
the Montreal conference were essentially ones of
Black destiny. In his words, "African scholarship
and destiny are one, and concern every black man
around the world. You cannot be objective about
the black man in South Africa."
Hendrix, who acted as moderator for the panel,
said he has no definite plans yet for future
meetings of those interested in the question of
African Studies.

of the black experience in and outside of Africa"
rather than as a geographical area, which he felt it
was the prupose of the ASA to view it as.
Abernethy also called the Black Caucus demand of
50% representation on the board of directors of
ASA unfair, since it would be giving some member
2 votes.
In Reaction
Professor Jeffreys, to Abernethy, said that the
Black Caucus demands and actions at Montreal
were a "needed slap in the face to the ASA," an
organization which he called "an extreme form of
institutionalized racism." In his opinion it was
only natural that the study of African history be
eventually controlled by blacks. Thus it was
necessary to eliminate the "white mafia" which
controls the study of African history in the ASA.
Martin Klein also felt that the ASA as it
presently existed was a form of institutionalized
racism and that although he was against quota
systems, "perhaps the 50-50 split proposed by the
Black Caucus or some similar constitutional
change is necessary to eliminate institutionalized
racism from the ASA."
The final speaker, not on the program, was
black poet and teacher at Stanford, Sotere E!
Turregian, who said that the questions raised at
the Montreal conference were essentially ones of
Black destiny. In his words, "African scholarship
and destiny are one, and concern every black man
around the world. You cannot be objective about
the black man in South Africa."
Hendrix, who acted as moderator for the panel,
said he has no definite plans yet for future
meetings of those interested in the question of
African Studies.
"It was necessary for the African Studies Association to be slapped
in the face." Thus spoke Leonard Jeffreys, professor of African
history at San Jose State, in a recent panel at Stanford on the 1969
African Studies Association (ASA) conference in Montreal.
The panel, organized by Mel Hendrix, a graduate student in African
history at Stanford, although dealing specifically with the Montreal
conference and its physical disruption by black members, considered
the whole question of the direction and control of African
scholarship, specifically in the ASA.
Hendrix sees the panel as the first of many meetings of concerned
African scholars. Eventually, Hendrix hopes to form a group of
persons, mainly students interested in the whole question of African
studies, although his plans in this area are not yet definite.
The panel itself, attended by about 50 people, had four speakers:
Wesley Johnson, professor of African history at Stanford; David
Abernethy, professor of political science at Stanford; Leonard
Jeffreys, professor of African history at San Jose State, and Martin
Klein, professor in Black Studies at Berkeley.
Dr. Johnson gave a brief history of the ASA. When the ASA was
founded in 1 962, said Johnson, "It was a essentially a club of scholars
interested in Africa." "In the eight years since the founding,
continued Johnson, there has been little change. The power still rests
in the hands of the well-meaning scholars who founded the
organization. . ."There has been almost no effort to recruit youths or
blacks, or form any policy vis-a-vis the black community."
Johnson feels, however, that the Black Caucus, black ASA members
who disrupted the Montreal conference, has now created a "new
climate in which to reexamine the policies of the ASA." According to
Dr. Johnson, the ASA had been formed at the end of the African
colonial period and hence had a definite perspective on Africa.
Johnson feels that whereas the position of Africa and blacks in the
world changed drastically, the ASA did not keep up with these
changes in its outlook. Thus, the disruptions at Montreal resulted

from the fact that "History finally caught up with '
the ASA."
Dr. Abernethy said his own reaction to the
conference was that there were many issues in
African history which were not specifically racially
oriented, and that perhaps the blacks were
attempting to view Africa as more of a "question
of the black experience in and outside of Africa"
rather than as a geographical area, which he felt it
was the prupose of the ASA to view it as.
Abernethy also called the Black Caucus demand of
