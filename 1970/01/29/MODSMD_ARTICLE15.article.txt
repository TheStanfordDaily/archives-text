# Malthus Revisited
## More Food. Fewer Babies

"If population control
measures are not initiated
immediately and effectively, all
the technology man can bring to
bear will not fend off the misery
to come." This is the somber
statement of two Stanford
scientists writing in the current
issue of Bioscience, a professional
journal.
Professor Paul Ehrlich,
population biologist, and John P.
Holdren of the Institute for
Plasma Research and Department
of Aeronautics and Astronautics,
cite a 3.5 billion world population
figure for 1 968 increasing
annually by 70 million. At least
half a billion people are
undernourished and slowly
starving, while another billion are
malnourished.
"World food production must
double in the period 1965-2000 to
stay even," they assert. "It must
triple if nutrition is to be brought
up to minimum requirements.
Man's present technology is
inadequate to the task of
maintaining the world's
burgeoning billions, even under
the most optimistic assumptions."
Increased Production
"This is not to assert that
present efforts to 'revolutionize'
tropical agriculture, increase

yields of fisheries, desalt water for
irrigation, exploit new power
sources, and implement related
projects are not worthwhile. They
may be."
However, the scientists warned
"They could also easily produce
the ultimate disaster for mankind
if they are not applied with
careful attention to their effects
on the ecological systems
necessary for survival.
"And even if such projects are
initiated with unprecedented
levels of staffing and
expenditures, without population
control they are doomed to fall
far short. No effort to expand the
carrying capacity of the Earth can
keep pace with unbridled
population growth," explained
the Stanford team.
Ehrlich and Holdren then
backed up their claims with
statistics to prove their point. If
India, for example, were to apply
fertilizers to increase yield on the
scale applied in the Netherlands, it
alone would take half the world's
present production of fertilizer.
Dangers of High Yields
Use of new high-yield grains
could lead to disaster if they turn
out to be more vulnerable to
insects and disease. Combatting

them with pesticides could ruin
the environment.
Hope for getting more food
from the sea is clouded by
problems of over-exploitation,
pollution, and economics.
Political as well as technological
problems would have to be solved.
And if algae and other marine
plant life could be harvested for
food, this might have an adverse
affect on the world's supply of
fish.
"Unfortunately," the scientists
continue, "the decision for
population control will be
opposed by grow t h-mi 11 ded
economists and businessmen, by
nationalistic statesmen, zealous
religious leaders, and by the
myopic and well-fed of every
description."
Ehrlich and Holdren conclude
their article by stressing that "It is
therefore incumbent on all who
sense the limitations of
technology and the fragility of the
environmental balance to make
themselves heard above the
hollow, optimistic chorus to
convince society and its leaders
that there is no alternative but the
cessation of our irresponsible,
all-demanding, and all-consuming
population growth."
