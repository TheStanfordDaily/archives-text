# Art Gallery To Show Recent Acquisitions
## 
### 
Important recent art acquisitions to the
permanent collection of the University— including
African art, Attic vases and European sculpture,
painting, drawings, and prints from the 16th
century to 1967—are on view at Art Gallery now
through March 1.
The paintings range from an oil by the Italian
painter and architect, Francesco Solimena
(1957-1747), to Richard Diebenkorn's "Window"
of 1967, which represented the U.S. in the 1968
Venice Biennale.
The group of early 20th century sculptures
includes the Duchamp-Villon "Torso of a Young
Man" of 1910 and pieces by Emil Nadelman and
Franz von Stuck.
Of particular interest, among the prints and
drawings, is an unfinished proof engraving with
additions drawn in pen and ink by Marcantonio
Raimondi, the most famous of the Italian
Renaissance print makers. Among the most
important 19th and '20th century drawings are two
watercolors by Auguste Rodin, pencil studies by
Gaston Lachaise, and Gustav Klimt.
Old master prints include a rare etching by
Federico Barocci, Thomas Rowlandson's most
famous print, "Vauxhall," and works by such
artists as Jean-Honore Fragonard, Eugene
Delacroix, and -J.-A.-D. Ingres.
A brilliant example of an early mezzotint is
"The Air Pump" by Valentine Green after Wright
of Derby. In this century there are prints by Lovis
Corinth and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, and
lithographs by Diebenkorn and Stanford Art Profs.
Nathan Oliveira and Frank Lobdell.
