# Tactile Truth and Beauty
## Blind Experience Art Exhibit 
### CHRIS COUZENS 
'Blind Art' is not a contradiction at San Francisco's deYoung
Museum.
The sense of touch is explored in depth by it's current special
exhibition of sculpture entitled "Dimension." It is sponsored by the
California Arts Commission and is designed for the blind and the
visually handicapped. Thirty sculptures spanning 3500 years of art
history and a variety of subjects and materials are on display to be
tactually as well as visually experienced.
The idea of a professionally arranged collection of art for the blind
was originated at the North Carolina Museum of Art. "Dimension"
was compiled after careful consultation with the sponsors of that
original program, artists, art historians, and with members of national
and local organizations such as Active Blind, Inc., and the Braille
Institute of America.
The collection will be in San Francisco until February 22 and will
then tour five locations in California.
The main purpose of this exhibit is to provide for the blind a
meaningful liason between theory, history, literature and the dynamic
reality of the plastic arts. Chronologically arranged, the sculptures are
displayed at a convenient level for handling. Braille and audio
information concerning their history and the background of the
exhibit itself is available.
Literary Subjects
Almost all of the works on display are three dimensional
illustrations of literary and historical figures. I found this to be one of
the most effective aspects of the collection. For both blind and
sighted people these sculptures are emotional, expressive units of
suddenly frozen kinetic and intellectual energy, that bring to life a
vast literary heritage.
Germaine Richier's bronze sculpture of Don Quixote at the
Windmill, for example, is an absurdly poignant characterization of an
absurdly idealistic hero. Don Quixote's awkward, gangling limbs and
the contrast between the sturdy blade of the mill, the clumsily aimed
sword, and the twisted, gaunt figure forcefully portray the futility and
yet the quiet honor of the moment.
Historical Insights
An Indian grey stone relief of a Seated Buddha provides another
kind of insight into history that may be experienced through the sense
of touch. The complex, symbolic carvings that surround the
meditating figure are all representative of some aspect of Buddha's
teachings or biography. Each detail is so finely crafted that it can be

detected by the fingers. Information about the symbols is available in
the Braille study center connected to the exhibit.
"Dimension" also covers a variety of sculpture materials including
limestone, jade, crystal, wood, bronze, marble, ivory and lava. Each of
the media is a tactual experience in itself. The various textures and the
applicability of techniques can be sensed through touching, as can the
temperature and emotional "feel" of the surface. Jade and ivory
represent coldness and serenity, while wood and the porous lava seem
warmer and more approachable.
Appropriate Media
In many of the works the type of material used seems uniquely
appropriate to the subject. A majestic, arrogant eagle is represented in
coldly simply, flowing yet severely contoured crystal.
Another impressive feature of "Dimension" is the wide range of
artist and periods included. Early Chinese, Indian, Greek, African and
Egyptian works are on display, as are examples of later schools such as
the Baroque, the Rococo, Neo-classicism, and representatives of
contemporary trends in sculpture.
Among the well-known artists whose work is included in this
exhibit are Francavilla, Marin, Rodin, Renoir, Remington, Moore,
Epstein, and O'Hanlon.
Time lor Touch
So far the exhibit has been successful in drawing both the blind
and the visually handicapped in class or group outings and on an
individual basis. The average time it takes to explore the works
through touch alone is two to three hours, while visual exploration is
sometimes completed in a matter of minutes.
1 became more aware than ever of the tendency of
non-handicapped people to neglect the less obvious aspects of sensory
observation and even to be careless with the most convenient sensory
channel, that of vision. In order to fully appreciate the impact of this
collection, I felt I had to try to think about it and react to it as if I
were blind.
Although the exhibit was designed for the blind, it has much to
offer to the sighted in terms of radically altering our understanding of
art and our knowledge of the senses.
Reactions
According to the guides at the museum, the reactions of the blind
to "Dimension" have been enthusiastic, informative and in some cases
surprising. They are especially sensitive to and appreciative of human
features and expressions. Symbols are found to be particularly
meaningful, such as a beard and downward-turned eyes portraying
age, wisdom, philosophical perception and sorrow.
Frequently the blind think they can "feel" a color through the
various tactile sensations and their individual experiences with
knowledge about color and its relationship to subject or emotion.

illustrations of literary and historical figures. I found this to be one of
the most effective aspects of the collection. For both blind and
sighted people these sculptures are emotional, expressive units of
suddenly frozen kinetic and intellectual energy, that bring to life a
vast literary heritage.
Germaine Richier's bronze sculpture of Don Quixote at the
Windmill, for example, is an absurdly poignant characterization of an
absurdly idealistic hero. Don Quixote's awkward, gangling limbs and
the contrast between the sturdy blade of the mill, the clumsily aimed
sword, and the twisted, gaunt figure forcefully portray the futility and
yet the quiet honor of the moment.
Historical Insights
An Indian grey stone relief of a Seated Buddha provides another
kind of insight into history that may be experienced through the sense
of touch. The complex, symbolic carvings that surround the
meditating figure are all representative of some aspect of Buddha's
teachings or biography. Each detail is so finely crafted that it can be

detected by the fingers. Information about the symbols is available in
the Braille study center connected to the exhibit.
"Dimension" also covers a variety of sculpture materials including
limestone, jade, crystal, wood, bronze, marble, ivory and lava. Each of
the media is a tactual experience in itself. The various textures and the
applicability of techniques can be sensed through touching, as can the
temperature and emotional "feel" of the surface. Jade and ivory
represent coldness and serenity, while wood and the porous lava seem
warmer and more approachable.
Appropriate Media
In many of the works the type of material used seems uniquely
appropriate to the subject. A majestic, arrogant eagle is represented in
coldly simply, flowing yet severely contoured crystal.
Another impressive feature of "Dimension" is the wide range of
artist and periods included. Early Chinese, Indian, Greek, African and
Egyptian works are on display, as are examples of later schools such as
the Baroque, the Rococo, Neo-classicism, and representatives of
contemporary trends in sculpture.
Among the well-known artists whose work is included in this
exhibit are Francavilla, Marin, Rodin, Renoir, Remington, Moore,
Epstein, and O'Hanlon.
Time lor Touch
So far the exhibit has been successful in drawing both the blind
and the visually handicapped in class or group outings and on an
individual basis. The average time it takes to explore the works
through touch alone is two to three hours, while visual exploration is
sometimes completed in a matter of minutes.
1 became more aware than ever of the tendency of
non-handicapped people to neglect the less obvious aspects of sensory
observation and even to be careless with the most convenient sensory
channel, that of vision. In order to fully appreciate the impact of this
collection, I felt I had to try to think about it and react to it as if I
were blind.
Although the exhibit was designed for the blind, it has much to
offer to the sighted in terms of radically altering our understanding of
art and our knowledge of the senses.
Reactions
According to the guides at the museum, the reactions of the blind
to "Dimension" have been enthusiastic, informative and in some cases
surprising. They are especially sensitive to and appreciative of human
features and expressions. Symbols are found to be particularly
meaningful, such as a beard and downward-turned eyes portraying
age, wisdom, philosophical perception and sorrow.
Frequently the blind think they can "feel" a color through the
various tactile sensations and their individual experiences with
knowledge about color and its relationship to subject or emotion.
'Blind Art' is not a contradiction at San Francisco's deYoung
Museum.
The sense of touch is explored in depth by it's current special
exhibition of sculpture entitled "Dimension." It is sponsored by the
California Arts Commission and is designed for the blind and the
visually handicapped. Thirty sculptures spanning 3500 years of art
history and a variety of subjects and materials are on display to be
tactually as well as visually experienced.
The idea of a professionally arranged collection of art for the blind
was originated at the North Carolina Museum of Art. "Dimension"
was compiled after careful consultation with the sponsors of that
original program, artists, art historians, and with members of national
and local organizations such as Active Blind, Inc., and the Braille
Institute of America.
The collection will be in San Francisco until February 22 and will
then tour five locations in California.
The main purpose of this exhibit is to provide for the blind a
meaningful liason between theory, history, literature and the dynamic
reality of the plastic arts. Chronologically arranged, the sculptures are
displayed at a convenient level for handling. Braille and audio
information concerning their history and the background of the
exhibit itself is available.
