DON QUIXOTK AT THE W INDMILL, by Germaine Richier (1904-1959)
San Francisco Museum of Art, gift of the Women's Board
Fart of the current exhibit for the blind at the deYoung Museum
Although the exhibit itself is small, its impact on the appreciation
of sculpture through history by both the blind and the sighted is
tremendous. It is well worth the drive to the city, particularly since
the deYoung Museum is located in Golden Gate Park and can be
reached without ecological anxiety by Interstate 280.
Museum hours are 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily. The permanent
collection includes an outstanding Oriental exhibit, a number of
paintings by the Flemish Masters, and a varied display of sculpture, as
well as many other works of art.
