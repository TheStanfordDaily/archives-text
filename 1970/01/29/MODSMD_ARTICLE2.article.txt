## Nixon HEW Veto Sustained 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon won his budget battle with
Congress Wednesday when House
Democrats failed to override his
veto off a $ 19.7-billion health and
education money bill.
The White House promptly let
it be known that it would be
willing to accept increases
totalings44B million over Nixon's
budget request in place of the
$1.2 billion added by Congress in
the vetoed bill.
The 226-191 vote in favor of
overriding the veto was 52 votes
short of the two-thirds majority
needed, far more than even
Republican leaders had forecast.
The result was final, with no
Senate action needed.
Nixon's position that the bill
was inflationary was supported by
156 Republicans and 35
Democrats. Only 27 Republicans
voted to override, along with 199

Democrats. Last month 86
Republicans voted for the
increased spending despite a
warning the bill would be vetoed.
The action left Congress with
the task of acting quickly on a
substitute bill to provide funds for
the Departments of Labor and of
Health, Education, and Welfare
for the current fiscal year which
has only five months to run.
Drug Itill
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate Wednesday
overwhelmingly approved a
comprehensive drug control bill
after defeating attempts to change
its dominant law-enforcement
character.
Final passage came on an 82 to
0 roll call vote moments after the
Senate rejected a bid to reduce
federal penalties for persons

convicted on a second or
subsequent charge or possessing
marijuana.
Earlier attempts to place more
stress on the scientific and
medical aspects of drug addiction
were beaten back by supporters of
the bill.
The Senate defeated, on a
58-24 roll call vote, an
amendment which would have cut
by half the severity of prison
sentences for the second and
subsequent convictions for
possission and distribution of
marijuana.
'Legal Scholar
WASHINGTON (AP) - Supreme
Court nominee G. Harrold
Carswell completed his Senate
testimony Wednesday hailed as a
"legal scholar" and apparently
assured of confirmation.
Disavowing again any racial

prejudice, the federal appeals
court judge glided through his
second and final day as a witness
before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
So smoothly did the session go,
one of his admirers, Sen. Marlow
W. Cook, R-Ky., inadvertently
addressed the nominee as "Justice
Garswell." Two persistent
committee liberals, Sens. Birch
Bayh, D-Ind., and Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., caused what
little difficulty Carswell
experienced. They kept asking
him why he had bought a share of
stock in an all-white country club
in Tallahassee in 1955.
Replying with only a trace of
heat, he said he did not have facial
segregation in mind when he
contributed $100.
