# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Horns Spoil SF Symphony 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
As I left the Opera House last
Wednesday, after the conclusion
of the program of the San
Francisco Symphony, I was
reminded of the line from
Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar,"
delivered by Antony: "The evil
that men do lives after them, /The
good is often buried with their
bones;/So let it be with Caesar."
In spite of a superb
presentation of Schuman's
Credendum, by the Orchestra, and
a powerful performance of the
Emperor Concerto by young
American pianist Mischa Dichter,
what I will remember was the
inept rendition of Beethoven's
superlative Symphony No. 7.
The full orchestra is certainly
not to blame; it is the bumbling,
incompetent French Horn section
which must bear the shame of
utterly destroying an otherwise
enjoyable concert.

The evening began pleasantly
enough with the Schuman work.
Credendum, written in 1955 for
UNESCO, is a three-movement
work expressing an internal
struggle in the orchestra, through
shifting moods, bits of humor,
and a continually developed
theme originally stated in the first
movement.
Especially good work by the
percussion section (by far the
most active) and strong solo
passages by Floyd Cooley, tuba,
should be noted. Mr. Schuman
wisely wrote a small part for the
horns.
Emperor Acclaimed
Mischa Dichter, 24 yV>ars old
and already internationally
acclaimed, was featured in
Beethoven's Piano Concerto No.
5, the very piece with which Mr.
Dichter made his concert debut
just five years ago. His smooth,
relaxed performance belied the
turmoil under which the piece was
composed—the siege of Vienna by
Napoleon.
This concerto, not as complex
as the Fourth, nevertheless
provides examples of Beethoven's
excellence in the art of the
development. Well-illustrated by
Mr. Dichter's sensitive

interpretation, the Rondo
demonstrated the weaving of
musical ideas and the evolution of
each theme as they reappear in
different forms, at which
Beethoven was the accomplished
master.
At this point, I was quite
pleased and was looking forward
to an expressive performance of
the Seventh Symphony. So much
the worse for me, for the horns
caught me unawares.
If I had come expecting
belches and total disregard for the
score, the experience might not
have been so painful. In the
Finale, the strings and horns are
to join in singing out a joyous,
triumphant theme, one of
Beethoven's most beautiful.
Horns Inept
But the horns played like high
schoolers with their first chance at
a solo; they let us all know they
were there, and we all wished they
weren't. This was the most
disgustingly incompetent
performance I have ever had the
displeasure to hear, and it was
nearly the first symphony I have
ever walked out on.
The horns for whom
Beethoven wrote were subtle,
muted instruments, meant to

harmonize with the strings and
woodwinds, not to blast through
them. Beethoven did not indicate
in the score that horn fortissimo
didn't really mean fortissimo since
he never thought we would ever
have horns who could blow as
loudly as trombones.
This calls for a bit of insight,
yea, even a bit of musicianship. I
fear the horns of San Francisco
lack both.
Auditions Recommended
Horns have always been the
nemesis of the San Francisco
Symphony, and have almost
single-handedly kept the
Symphony in the ranks of
second-rate orchestras. When we
attract such internationally
renowned conductors as Monteux,
Krips and Ozawa, principal
violinists of the stature of
Krachmalnik and Canin,
woodwinds of the quality of
Leßoux and Renzi, why are we
left with such a pitifully poor
horn section? Krips must cringe
every time a horn solo appears; I
know I do.
The first priority of the
Symphony for next season must
be to find some decent horn
players, and pay them enough to
play in San Francisco.
