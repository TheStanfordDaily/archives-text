South lucked out after making
a substandard opening bid when
his opponents fell into the trap of
the "rhythm double." This pitfall

occurs when one partner doubles
an opponent's bid, they run out
to another suit, and doubler's
partner, holding decent trumps,
decides to keep up the tempo by
doubling that bid with disastrous
results, as seen here.
South's opening is reasonable
were he not vulnerable. He has
two decent 5-card suits, but is
sorely lacking in high cards.
North, after partner opened,
immediately started wondering
what game to play in. But the
bidding got muddled along the
way.
If you're wondering about the
three club bid well, you find a
decent call with the North hand.
Three spades is too strong, two
spades too weak, two no-trump
poor with his club holding. But
with an opening opposite
partner's opening, he must force.
East, naturally enough, doubled,
and South quickly rebid his
diamonds.
West, in the rhythm, also
doubled, and North was quite
happy to pass.

West led the club ace, and
continued a club, South ruffing.
He now led the spade ten and let
it ride to East's king. East
returned another club, and South
trumped once more. He now
cashed two hearts and started
running spades, pitching hearts on
the third round.
East ruffed the fourth spade
with his seven, South put on the
eight, and West took the queen.
Declarer now had six tricks, the
defense taking three.
West was now trapped. A
diamond lead gives South two
trump tricks in hand plus one in
dummy by leading a heart for a
ruff. So West, out of major suit
cards, led another club. Declarer,
realizing the situation, ruffed in
hand with the jack, cashed the ace
of trumps, and led a heart towards
dummy's ten of trumps, West
couldn't prevent the ten from
winning now or later, and gave up,
the victim of a rhythm double.
"All move for the next round,"
the director called, and West tried
to avoid his partner's deadly stare.

an opponent's bid, they run out
to another suit, and doubler's
partner, holding decent trumps,
decides to keep up the tempo by
doubling that bid with disastrous
results, as seen here.
South's opening is reasonable
were he not vulnerable. He has
two decent 5-card suits, but is
sorely lacking in high cards.
North, after partner opened,
immediately started wondering
what game to play in. But the
bidding got muddled along the
way.
If you're wondering about the
three club bid well, you find a
decent call with the North hand.
Three spades is too strong, two
spades too weak, two no-trump
poor with his club holding. But
with an opening opposite
partner's opening, he must force.
East, naturally enough, doubled,
and South quickly rebid his
diamonds.
West, in the rhythm, also
doubled, and North was quite
happy to pass.

West led the club ace, and
continued a club, South ruffing.
He now led the spade ten and let
it ride to East's king. East
returned another club, and South
trumped once more. He now
cashed two hearts and started
running spades, pitching hearts on
the third round.
East ruffed the fourth spade
with his seven, South put on the
eight, and West took the queen.
Declarer now had six tricks, the
defense taking three.
West was now trapped. A
diamond lead gives South two
trump tricks in hand plus one in
dummy by leading a heart for a
ruff. So West, out of major suit
cards, led another club. Declarer,
realizing the situation, ruffed in
hand with the jack, cashed the ace
of trumps, and led a heart towards
dummy's ten of trumps, West
couldn't prevent the ten from
winning now or later, and gave up,
the victim of a rhythm double.
"All move for the next round,"
the director called, and West tried
to avoid his partner's deadly stare.
