## The 						Yale Case â€“ V 
### John Arthur 
"Men who devote their lives to
children's games are so infantile in
their approach to the world that
to take sides in their spats is like
offering to punch a neighbor in
the nose because his brat has beat
up our little Orvie. "
The above gem, penned by columnist Red
Smith for the New York Herald Tribune in 1962,
sums up the war between the National Collegiate
Athletic Association and the Amateur Athletic
Union about as well as any discovered here. This is
not to indict the coaches and faculty personnel
who run amateur athletics (as much as they are
able) the way it should be run in this country:
with the interests of the athletes involved as their
primary concern.
But it is directed at the administrative staffs of
those two organizations, the men who get their
jollies whenever they wrest control of an event
away from the boobs across the street. When that
kind of struggle occurs, as has happened so often in
recent years, there are two losers: first, the
athletes, second the sporting public.
A casual glance at the past and conversations
with men who have had to deal with both groups
quickly leads one to the conclusion that the feud
will not end while the leadership of either group
remains in power and it probably won't slack off
without a major overhaul of the rules governing
amateur sport in America.
Conflict Unnecessary
There shouldn't be any conflict of interest here,
of course. By definition, the NCAA should be
concerned with collegiate athletics alone, while it
doesn't seem too much to ask the AAU to limit its
jurisdiction to the non-collegiate scene.
But the AAU proponents charge that the
power-hungry NCAA wants to extend its influence
into all areas of sport. The association, it is
claimed, wants to tell university presidents how to
define ethics, registrars how to judge students,
financial managers how to allocate TV money and
athletic directors how to recruit. And worst of all,
taking the case under study here, the NCAA
demands the right to tell students where they can
go to play games.
Yet the college boys come back with a few
salvos of their own. The AAU, it is said, has a
worldwide reputation for shabbiness. Its athletes
are poorly transported, fed and housed, its
tournaments are inefficiently run, its aim is no less
than exploitation. Scant notice is paid to less than
honorable financial dealings with the jocks, and
when foreign teams are brought over here to play
they invariably leave not wholly satisfied.
The disgusting thing is that all these charges are
to some degree justified.
There is general agreement among coaches and
administrators alike that the NCAA badly
mishandled the Jack Langer-Yale case. There is no
reason whatsoever why Langer shouldn't have
been permitted to play in the Maccabiah games
last summer. Even Prof. Harry M. Cross of the
University of Washington and chairman of the
NCAA Council, admits that the "Maccabiah
Games are . . . well run."
But despite the fact that when it announced the
two-year probation for Yale, the Council said the
move was intended to persuade the AAU to give
up its fight to control international basketball,

Cross dismissed the feud as a factor in Yale's
punishment: "The NCAA is an awkward and
amorphous organization. . . . Undoubtedly the
total structure could be better than it is.
Sometimes happenstance seems to determine
which events are sanctioned and which aren't."
"Happenstance" in this instance has resulted in
a nationwide furor and further indictment of the
NCAA and the AAU.
The bitterness of the case has been aggravated
by the stubborn stance taken by Yale and the Ivy
League, not only now but in the past. Yet what is
so wful about a school letting one of its athletes
play a few amateur games abroad?
One wonders what Stanford would do in a
similar situation. In one respect the University has
already made its position known. By not
condemming the NCAA's action, and by going
along with a decision made by fellow Pac-8 team
UCLA, Stanford has in effect acquiesced. Last
summer a UCLA basketball player, Andy Hill, was
preparing to go to Israel with the American
Maccabiah game quintet when Bruin Athletic
Director J.D. Morgan called up and told him he
couldn't go. Hill had made the team in March and
like other athletes, had helped raise money for the
trip, then had planned his entire summer around
the games. It took the NCAA until July, however,
to gather its collective wit and decide to announce
that the games were off limits.
Because players like Hill couldn't go, and
because Yale had the courage to stand up to the
NCAA, Langer, who hadn't made the team at first,
went to the Tel Aviv.
NCAA's Worth
At this point, you might well ask why an outfit
like Stanford, or Yale, should even bother with the
NCAA and all its restrictions. But this is nonsense.
A governing body for collegiate sports is a must
for such basics as a common set of rules which
offer both equal competition and a recognized set
of standards, post-season tournaments, and
recruiting regulations. NCAA proponents point
out with justification that college athletics would
be even more professional than they are today
without the association.
But then again, why must the universities and
colleges continue to grant the NCAA a wider
sphere of authority under the guise of beneficial
regulation for student-athletes and amateurism? A
new NCAA rule, for instance, permits most
schools to cancel institutional aid if the recipient
"engages in serious misconduct," which can include
a whole series of offenses such as "manifest
disobedience through violation of institutional
regulations or established athletic department
policies and rules applicable to all student-athletes."
Rules like this don't point to the conclusion
that the NCAA is what it says it is. The entire
concept of the NCAA is to insure that athletes are
students and are treated the same as any other
students. But this rule clearly defines special
policy for student-athletes. And it gives the coach
power to terminate a student's financial aid if he
doesn't conform to "established athletic
department policies," whatever that means.
There is a distince difference between advancing
the interests of amateur athletes and protecting
them from unsavory outside influences. The
amateur athletic organizations in this country
either can't recognize that difference, or else they
just don't want to. It's too bad.
