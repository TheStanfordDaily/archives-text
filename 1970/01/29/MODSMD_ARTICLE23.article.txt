# Kappa Sigs, Branner Win
## Balance In IM Cage Scores 
### SCOTT BURNS 
The second week IM basketball
scores showed that there are many
well-balanced teams competing
this year. Most of the games were
close.
In the toughest league in IM's
this year, it looks like the Delts
will be battling it out with the
Kappa Sigs. The sure-shooting
Greene twins, Warren and Warner,
combined for 32 points as the
Kappa Sigs slipped by the Sigma
Chi's 51-47, for their second win.
In the same league, the DU's also
showed strength as they
overpowered the strong Phi
Kapps, 36-29.

Led by a front line of giants,
Branner seems to be a sure
contender for the IM
Championship this year. As they
crushed Serra 102-23 for the
highest score of the year, they had
six players in double figures. Chris
Martin led all scorers with 21
points.
Loro and Cardenal both lead
the freshman league with 2-0
records. Bill Wiley poured in 15
points as he led Loro to a 54-39
victory over winless Rinconada,
and the hot shooting of John
Simmons (24 points) helped
Cardenal take Arroyo, 49-41.
Led by freshman Bill Reed who

scored 39 points, El Cuadro
demolished Los Arcos, 83-20, for
their second win, and it looks like
they might be challenging El Toro
for the "L" championship this
year. El Toro, who is also 2-0,
beat Junipero, 53-30.
The Theta Delts used balanced
scoring to barely slip by the
SAE's, 47-43. They put the
defensive clamp on SAE's star
center, Bob Bond, in the second
half to pave the way to their win.
Still, Bond led all scorers with 13
points.
In another big game, the KA's
defeated the Phi Delts, 53-44, for
their second win. The KA's were
led by super-shooters Stu Boyd
and Doug Warner, both with 11
points, but the game high went to
Todd Peterson of the Phi Delts
who got 15.
Keith Mayo sunk 17 points as
the Alpha Sigs won their second
game, 41-31, against the Chi Psi's.
The Pie Eaters produced a
brilliant effort, or should I say

amazing effort, as they broke into
double figures in the scoring
column for the first time.
But, they lost anyway as the
Leland Stanford Junior Varsity
Marching Band rolled over them,
38-21.
How the Eaters scored 21
points, no one knows. LSJUMB
did do a defensive job on John
Manoogian, the Pete Maravich of
the Eaters, and reduced his
scoring average to V2 point
per-game for the season. John was
quite mad after the game for this
may have eliminated him from
getting the IM scoring title this
year.
(Editor's note: Starting next
week, the Daily, in conjunction
with Intramural referees and
professional soothsayers will
present the first of a weekly series
of "IM Top Ten Teams." The
official Daily rankings will carry
no weight and have no relevance
to anything. It will he
controversial and utter rot.)

demolished Los Arcos, 83-20, for
their second win, and it looks like
they might be challenging El Toro
for the "L" championship this
year. El Toro, who is also 2-0,
beat Junipero, 53-30.
The Theta Delts used balanced
scoring to barely slip by the
SAE's, 47-43. They put the
defensive clamp on SAE's star
center, Bob Bond, in the second
half to pave the way to their win.
Still, Bond led all scorers with 13
points.
In another big game, the KA's
defeated the Phi Delts, 53-44, for
their second win. The KA's were
led by super-shooters Stu Boyd
and Doug Warner, both with 11
points, but the game high went to
Todd Peterson of the Phi Delts
who got 15.
Keith Mayo sunk 17 points as
the Alpha Sigs won their second
game, 41-31, against the Chi Psi's.
The Pie Eaters produced a
brilliant effort, or should I say

amazing effort, as they broke into
double figures in the scoring
column for the first time.
But, they lost anyway as the
Leland Stanford Junior Varsity
Marching Band rolled over them,
38-21.
How the Eaters scored 21
points, no one knows. LSJUMB
did do a defensive job on John
Manoogian, the Pete Maravich of
the Eaters, and reduced his
scoring average to V2 point
per-game for the season. John was
quite mad after the game for this
may have eliminated him from
getting the IM scoring title this
year.
(Editor's note: Starting next
week, the Daily, in conjunction
with Intramural referees and
professional soothsayers will
present the first of a weekly series
of "IM Top Ten Teams." The
official Daily rankings will carry
no weight and have no relevance
to anything. It will he
controversial and utter rot.)
The second week IM basketball
scores showed that there are many
well-balanced teams competing
this year. Most of the games were
close.
In the toughest league in IM's
this year, it looks like the Delts
will be battling it out with the
Kappa Sigs. The sure-shooting
Greene twins, Warren and Warner,
combined for 32 points as the
Kappa Sigs slipped by the Sigma
Chi's 51-47, for their second win.
In the same league, the DU's also
showed strength as they
overpowered the strong Phi
Kapps, 36-29.

Led by a front line of giants,
Branner seems to be a sure
contender for the IM
Championship this year. As they
crushed Serra 102-23 for the
highest score of the year, they had
six players in double figures. Chris
Martin led all scorers with 21
points.
Loro and Cardenal both lead
the freshman league with 2-0
records. Bill Wiley poured in 15
points as he led Loro to a 54-39
victory over winless Rinconada,
and the hot shooting of John
Simmons (24 points) helped
Cardenal take Arroyo, 49-41.
Led by freshman Bill Reed who

scored 39 points, El Cuadro
demolished Los Arcos, 83-20, for
their second win, and it looks like
they might be challenging El Toro
for the "L" championship this
year. El Toro, who is also 2-0,
beat Junipero, 53-30.
