### HALL DAILY 
Freshman Roscoe Tanner
reached the quarter-finals of the
Salt Lake Invitation Tennis
Tournament last weekend, but
lost, 1-6, 6-4, 7-5 to Zan Guerry,
currently number one at Rice and
ranked twelfth in U.S. Men's
Singles.
Tanner was one of five
Stanford players at the tourney.
Also attending were sophomores
Chris Chapin and Rick Evans, and
frosh Gerry Groslimond and Rick
Fisher.
Fisher was decisioned by the
nationally thirteenth-ranked Mike
Estep of Rice by a score of 7-5,
4-6, 7-5. Groslimond was beaten
by Jim Osborne, ranked ninth in
the nation, in straight sets 6-1, 6-2
and Chaplin was dropped by top
Utah racketman F. D. Robbins,
6-4, 6-1. Utah's number two man,
Dan Bleckinger, was victorious
over Evans, 6-1, 7-5.
In doubles action, Evans and
Chapin fell before Estep and Tico
Carrero, also of Rice, in three sets,

6-3, 3-6, 6-4, after leading in the
fourth set, 4-2. Stanford's other
entry, Fisher and Groslimond,
battled their way to the
semi-finals by over-whelming
Osborne number two U.S. doubles
player) and Mike Martinez, 6-3,
6-4, and then outlasting Foothill's
Felix Ponte and Steve Stefanski,
5-7, 6-2, 6-3.
The semi-finals pitted Fisher
and Groslimond against the team
of Tom Edlefson, ranked seventh
in national singles, and Gene
Cantin, Northern Cal's number
two player. In a tough battle, the
older and more experienced
Edlefson-Cantin pair triumphed
14-12, 7-5.
Over-all, Coach Dick Gould
expressed relative contentment
with his squad's early indication
of strength. "Roscoe Tanner did
very well, especially considering
that he had mononucleosis over
Christmas and has had only one or
two week's work." In a word,
Gould was "pleased" with last
weekend's team performance.
