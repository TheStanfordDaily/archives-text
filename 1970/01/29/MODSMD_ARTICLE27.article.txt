# Stanford Ruggers To Battle BATS
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
Stanford's undefeated Rugby
team puts its perfect record on
the line when BATS Rugby Club
comes to Stanford for a big match
this Saturday afternoon.
"BATS is one of the best club
teams in the nation," commented
Coach Pete Kmetovic. "I just
hope that they're slowing up and
won't be able to catch our backs
this Saturday."
No one has managed to thus
far. Stanford's offensive attack

has been nothing short of
explosive, rolling up 48 points
against Piedmont and another 34
this past Saturday against the San
Francisco Rugby Club.
In that match, Jack Schultz
broke loose for three tries and
Jack Lasater touched the ball
across the goal line for six points
of his own. Chuck Williams and
Jim Kauffman each tallied a try in
the winning effort. Leon
Hartvickson had a great
afternoon, booming a penalty
kick and four conversions through
the goal posts for thirteen points.
Stanford's second team romped
past the San Francisco seconds,
21-8, and the third team also
chalked up a victory by a 14-3
margin. The only Stanford team
to leave Golden Gate Park losers
was the inexperienced fourth
squad who dropped one 18-8.
Stanford has moved the ball
extremely well in each outing, and
the forwards have controlled the
scrum situations.
