# No Mormon Doctrine Change
## 
### 
SALT LAKE CITY - (AP) - The
top three leaders of the Mormon
church said last Saturday there
would be no changes in doctrine
to meet changing social
conditions.
While church programs are ever
changing to keep pace with
society, the three said, doctrine
must remain steadfast as the
revealed word of God.
President Joseph Fielding
Smith and his two chief
counselors, Harold B. Lae and N.
Eldon Tanner, met with newsmen
a day after Smith was named to
preside over the church.
The selection of Smith, 93, as
10th president of the Church of
Latter-day Saints came one day
after the burial of David O.
McKay, for nineteen years the
prophet of Mormonism.
One of the several questions
submitted in writing in advance of
the news conference noted that
liberal church members have long
regarded Smith as Mormonism's
most conservative theologian.
Asked if his views have changed

in recent years, Smith replied: "I
don't think my position has ever
been altered."
Replying to another question
on the church's role in society,
Tanner said: "The church tries to
keep in step and apply its
programs to the changing world."
But, he added, "the gospel is
unchanging."

No questions were permitted
regarding a church policy barring
Negroes from the priesthood,
which most white male members
/â€ž are expected to attain. It is this
policy which prompted Stanford
to cancel any future athletic
competitions with Brigham Young
University, a Mormon-supported
institution.
