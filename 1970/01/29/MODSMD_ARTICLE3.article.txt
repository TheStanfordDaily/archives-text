# ROTC Program Revamped To Meet Changing Needs
## 
### LEO NICHOLAS (First of two parts) 
Amid the on again-off again
controversy over ROTC at
Stanford and its right to academic
credit and/or existence, significant
changes instituted this year in the
Army's program have remolded
the scope and content of military
science instruction.
In response to general campus
criticism, Army officers here
have:
—Eliminated the weekly
on-campus march-drill,
substituting monthly classroom
instruction and field exercises
stressing more varied material.
—Beefed up the proportion of
non-military source materials used
in classroom work.
— Formulated plans for
transferring the teaching of
certain non-military subjects to
University departments.
ROTC Alters Program
— Faced with declining
enrollment, a hostile political
climate on campus, and
administrative criticism arising
from anti-ROTC sentiment,
officers continue to alter the
program to suit University
requests. Colonel Stanley Ramey,
Professor of Military Science,
insists that he and higher Army
officials are "trying our best to
work out acceptable changes
within the University system.
Naturally, we want to continually
recruit our officers from the best
colleges possible."
Ramey has developed all
changes in the program on his
own initiative without specific
approval from higher
headquarters. He indicated that he
will continue to be relatively free
to implement necessary changes.
Some 91 Stanford students are
participating in the Army's
program this year. Figures for the
last three years show a slow, then
rapid decline in enrollment—2l 5
in 1966, 205 in 1967, and 160 in
1968. About 20 percent of
currently enrolled students are on
two- or four-year scholarships.
Lottery Results Mixed
President Nixon's draft lottery
brings mixed blessings—some
cadets not under contract drew
high numbers and quit, others not
in the program may join because
of low numbers. Ramey believes
that those of the latter category
will counterbalance defectors by
joining the two-year program. So
far, though, shifts in either
direction have been minimal.
The most significant
curriculum changes have affected

the i'irst two years of instruction.
Freshmen now study military
history from two civilian books,
instead of the military texts
employed last year. Monthly
training emphasizes marching,
rifle marksmanship and
maintenance, and small-unit
tactics.
Likewise, sophomores use no
military texts to study
international politics and
military-civil relations. Army
manuals are consulted, though, in
later sections on CBW, guerrilla,
and thermonuclear warfare.
Seminars and oral reports
constitute the bulk of classwork.
Last year, all-military sources
covered land navigation,
patrolling, and battle drill in the
graded class. Such material is now
contained in the monthly
exercises and does not affect the
academic grade.
Ad\a net* d Work
Advanced course (junior and
senior) instruction emphasizes
techniques of communication and
management. Confrontation with
simulated "problems" of
management take place within
seminar environment. Individual
performances are reviewed by
instructor and students. Monthly
training prepares junior cadets for
a six-week summer camp. Seniors
direct and co-ordinate field
exercises as a practical extension
of classroom management work.
Of the five Army officers
instructing military science
classes, two men have bachelor's
degrees and are working on
master's degrees here, two more
hold their master's degrees, and
one has a Ph.D. Colonel Ramey
holds a Master of Business
Administration degree from
Stan ford.
Penalty clauses in scholarship
and advanced course contracts
which can order a student to
active duty for "willful violation"
of contract terms, have brought
recent criticism from University
officials. Provost Richard Lyman
termed them "archaic."
Penalty Clause "Necessary"
Colonel Ramey defends the
clauses as "necessary" and a
"matter of law." He noted the
word "may" in the text a*
evidence of intended flexibility.
Figures for the past three years
show that some 42 cases of willful
violation have been investigated
among 50,000 contract students
nation-wide. Twenty-six have
been ordered to active duty, none
in Army ROTC at Stanford
(although one each from the

Naval and Air Force programs
here have been prosecuted).
Cadets on four-year
scholarships have until the
the sophomore year to leave the
program without penalty or
obligation, Ramey said. Two-vear
scholarship students have one year
until the end of their junior year.
For a conscientious objector to
break his contract and leave the
program, final approval must be
obtained from the Pentagon. The
Professor of Military Science must
make a recommendation to higher
officials based on a student's
interviews with legal personnel, a
clergyman, and Army officers.
Three Stanford students have
requested conscientious objector
status this year.
