# Girl Dies Before Transplant
## 
### 
Becky Howland, a 9-year-old
girl from Hermiston, Ore., died
last Wednesday, after waiting two
years for Stanford University
doctors to locate a heart small
enough to transplant.
A suitable heart donor was
never found. Becky spent a week
under observation at the Stanford
Medical Center last November,
and was scheduled to return this
February. She died en route to a
hospital in Hermiston, whose
residents had raised $30,000 and
kept a plane on standby for an
emergency trip to the Stanford

Medical Center, if a heart became
available.
Becky first came to Stanford
two years ago, when doctors
discovered that her heart had a
growth that would be fatal within
three years. Surgeons decided to
delay a transplant as they felt
early techniques needed
perfection.
Although unable to attend
school, Becky kept ahead of her
class with special tutoring. Her
bags were kept packed at home,
ready for a call from Stanford.
