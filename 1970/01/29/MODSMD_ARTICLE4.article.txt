# Moratorium Members Attend ROTC Class
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Captain Thomas Casey usually
begins his Army ROTC class
making dry administrative
announcements. Yesterday, faced
with an invasion of radical
students, he began by announcing
university regulations concerning
student disruptions and by asking
those not enrolled in his class to
leave the front row.
By the time the students agreed
to vacate their seats, the room was
full and they were told they
would have to leave. When several
students remained standing, Casey
said that their presence
constituted disruption and calmly
asked public safety director
DanielDeYoung to force them out.

De Young told the students
that they were violating a superior
court injunction obtained by the
University last spring during the
Encina Hall sit-in which he would
enforce if they did not leave. The
students left.
The student observers were
taking part in a campaign of the
new Stanford Moratorium to
publicize the role of ROTC on
campus. The next meeting of the
group is planned for early next
week.
Except for the initial
disruptions, Captain Casey seemed
pleased with interest in his class.
He referred to the new students as
guests and explained what the

class was doing as it proceeded.
Although they were told not to
interrupt or ask questions during
class, the observers were allowed
about 15 minutes at the end to
ask questions about the class or
ROTC in general.
Pre-Professional Training
Casey admits that his class is
basically pre-professional training.
Regarding the class's right to
academic credit, Casey said, "I
would find it difficult to defend."
Casey says that there are many
misconceptions about ROTC on
campus, and he is glad students
are interested enough to find out
first hand what is really going on.
He seemed flattered that so many
students would want to observe
his class.
Decked in his olive green Army
uniform, Casey began by
explaining, "for the benefit of our
guests today," that the class
would consist of presentations by
two of the cadets on military
tactics and situation ethics. The
other students would critique
their speaking style, the
presentation being just as
important as the subject matter.
The first presentation by cadet
Robert Davis was called
''Estimates Troop Leading
Procedures." Comparing troop
leadership with playing chess,
Davis seemed not to notice the
radicals as he discussed methods
of approaching the enemy. He
stressed governing factors such as
visibility, terrain features, cover
and concealment in deciding
which avenue of approach to take
when assaulting enemy positions.
At this point, Michael Sweeney
interrupted to ask if these tactics
were used at Pinkville, the 1968
massacre of hundreds of
Vietnamese civilians. Casey told
him he was disrupting the class,
and read him the university
regulations on student
disruptions. Sweeney left.
