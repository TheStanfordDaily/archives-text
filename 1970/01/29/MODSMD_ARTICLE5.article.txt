# Factions Split SDS Meeting In Vicious Shouting Match
## 
### RICHARD EMBRY 
Last night's SDS meeting
erupted into a vicious,
ninety - mi nu te-long shouting
match between eight members of
the Worker - Student Alliance
Caucus (WSA) and about 25
members of the "old" Stanford
SDS, who were allied with eight
Revolutionary Union (RU)
members.
The meeting opened with a
proposal from H. Bruce Franklin
that all WSA members be forced
to leave, since the WSA had been
voted out of the Stanford SDS
during a summer meeting of the
chapter. The WSA faction held its
ground.
SDS members heatedly charged
the WSA caucus with trying to
"wreck" the radical movement,
specifically citing WSA's criticisms
of the NLF, Black Panther Party,

labor unions, and Ho Chi Minh.
While insisting the issue at hand
was their reght to remain at the
meeting, WSA members
responded by saying that they
supported the same
anti-imperialist groups as the SDS,
but felt that their criticisms had
been valid and justified.
Despite threats of violence,
which almost materialized, WSA
members were undaunted by the
attacks leveled at them, and they
remained until tempers cooled
and people broke into smaller
groups. Two hours after the
meeting had begun, they walked
out, and the remaining SDSers
started the meeting up again.
The Worker-Student Alliance
was a caucus within the SDS until
the SDS National Convention this
summer, where the National SDS
split into two groups, the

Weatherman and the Progressive
Labor Party (PLP).
The Stanford chapter, although
formally aligning itself with
neither Weatherman nor PLP,
voted to exclude any WSA
members from its ranks this
summer. The Weatherman, on
walking out of the National
Convention, had denounced the
WSA caucus. Another faction,
calling itself the Boston SDS, is
currently allied with WSA.
The basic ideology of WSA
and SDS are the same, with both
groups striving to destroy what
they term all racist, imperialist,
internationalist, and
anti-communist elements.
Basic strategies of the two
groups are to build a
worker-student alliance and a
pro-working class student
movement.
