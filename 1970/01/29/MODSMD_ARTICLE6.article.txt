# Checkers Beware
## Meal Tickets Causing Hassles 
### TOM GIVEN 
"I'm pissed," fumed a checker at one dorm.
"If that's all some people have to do with their time,
why have them around," commented another in a nearby
dorm.
"I guess the honor code doesn't fit into what you can
steal," argued the head of the food service.
They're all talking about the same thing—cheating the
food service and attempts to stop it.
A war of wits that has seen the introduction of new
meal tickets with pictures and stickers, and the hiring of
bouncers to patrol dining rooms has entered a new phase
with the hiring of undercover men to try to crack food
lines.
Armed with meal tickets lacking pictures and stickers,
they crash lines around campus, trying to fool the
checker. Often they succeed.

"The auditors' office came in last quarter and asked
how our new system was working," relates William
Myers, head of the University Food Service. "They
wanted to test the system, so they asked for a couple of
blank tickets. They went to all the dining rooms on
campus, and were served in every one."
Students Nabbed
"So, this quarter we hired a couple of students to do
the same thing. . .now they're getting nabbed all the time.
The checkers are really making an effort."
How much of an effort is open to doubt. Some
checkers claim they now recognize the service's agents,
and turn them away with regularity.
Others claim to check everyone more closely. But all
checkers are resenting the extra strain put on an already
delicate position.
"It just makes us hassle everyone unnecessarily," noted
a Lagunita checker.
"The kids hate us enough without this too; now we
treat them worse and they hate us more," explained a
Roble checker.
Behind it all is a recurrent problem - just how can you
keep the non-paying guest out of the dining room.
Lost Honesty
"The meal ticket system was designed for simplicity,
and based on something lost here at Stanford - honesty",
mused Myers.
"The only solution is 'the support of the students and
the resident faculty, but the faculty don't think it's their
job to be policemen, and the students don't, care because
they think it's not their problem."
Myers takes great pains in emphasizing that it is indeed
their problem. "I'd estimate the amount of subsidization
of non-residents at $20.000-$30,000." He claims that
these "non- resident parasites" are part of the reason for
the service's record deficit - which is approaching
$3000. There are other reasons to be sure, not the least
of which is the small dining room that is inherently
inefficient. Myers nontheless contends that cheating
means huge losses.

"I think most students are honest. . .but there's this
active, dishonest minority."
How to Determine
He admits that there is no reliable way to determine
extent of the cheating. His estimates are drawn from
numbers of "lost" meal tickets, which consistently
disappear after registration.
"Last year, we had over 200 meal tickets 'lost' within
the first ten days of the quarter." This fall quarter, we
only had fifty, and a lot of those were due to wallet
thefts— there was a rash of petty thievery in the dorms."
Analogies to the arms race are not inappropriate as
Myers & Co. try to stay one step ahead of the enemy -
whoever he may be.
The old impersonal punch cards were replaced this year
with the new picture-and-tag combination. "Monitors"
were hired to patrol dining rooms and keep the "Parasites,"
out. Faced with apathy and hostility in the dining rooms,
many monitors quit, and others had their effectiveness
impared.
R••placement Considered
Now being considered is quarterly replacement of the
cards, "we had 100 tickets lost between the end of fall
quarter and the beginning of winter quarter", notes Myers.
"We find ourselves in the position of changing the tickets
because of massive cheating."
And so it goes, in an ever continuing spiral of
escalation. With the end far from sight, nerves are already
beginning to fray.
"1 wish they'd get those bouncers off our backs," said
one Wilbur resident. "The way they stare at you you can
hardly eat."
Philosophized another Wilburite, "The Food Service has
discovered the ultimate in rampant bureaucratese. It's all
part of the Business office repression that often passes as
policy at this university."
A Roble checker mused, "It reminds me of the
Germans with the Hitler Youth or something.

CHECKERS' BEST FRIEND—TTiis, folks, is a real, live mealticket.
Not a lake or forgery, even. Its owner, "El Hound," unfortunately
forgot to buy a sticker this term. Otherwise, it's more legal than lots
of other tickets In'ing circulated right now. as numerous checkers
have suddenly learned.
