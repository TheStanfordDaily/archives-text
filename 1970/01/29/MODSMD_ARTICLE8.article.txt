Editor, THE DAILY:
Much thanks for the Ultimate
Agnew.
What relief it brings to the
thousands at Stanford who wired
or wrote the Veep their
congratulations, now that they
know that his "engraved
response" in their mail does not
mark them as part of the ultimate
enemy of the movement.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to take this
opportunity to commend the
DAILY for printing so many
blissful poems, especially those
recently by Thomas Rockslide
,McClaren. I would like to say that
-they bring blissful joy into my
heart and have been highly
commended by the distinguished
poet, Junniper Jeepers Jarvis, for
their merit. Keep up the good
work.

Hate the USA ? DEA TU
Editor, THE DAILY:
Professor Bruce Franklin really
HATES R.0.T.C., doesn't he? I
think he must hate the USA
also—otherwise, who does he
think would defend our shores
against any predator who might
take a notion to "order thousands
of young working class Americans
to their deaths" via invasion or
attack?
Granted, we shouldn't be in
Vietnam—but we would be most
unwise not to be vigilant here at
home.
Many of the statements I have
read were made by Mr. Franklin
border on treason; which (if I
remember correctly) can be
penalized by death. It's amazing
that Stanford continues to allow
him to teach on the campus.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I noticed that in his interview
with Payton Jordan, Fred Mann
made repeated references to
Jordan's "flashing eyes."
Optometrists warn that flashing of
the eyes is often a symptom of
extreme short-sightedness and
may even affect vital brain
functions, resulting in the
patient's inability to see any but
the most simple images. Jordan's
fascinating explanation of the fall
of Rome shows that excessive
reading is clearly not the cause of
his condition. Whatever its causes,
it can be solved by daily
performing these simple exercises:
1) Look Backward 2) Look
Forward (continue until
differences become distinct).
Helpfully yours,

Editor, THE DAILY:
I enjoyed Fred Mann's Article
on Stanford Track Coach Payton
Jordan's possible Republican
candidacy for the office of
Secretary of State. I find it
intriguing that Jordan aspires to
an office to which only two men
(both Republicans) have been

elected since 1910—Frank C.
Jordan (1910-1 940) and Frank M.
Jordan (1943-1970), a father and
son team.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Gerry Hargraves
January 7th letter concerning
problems of rainfall in un used
land areas, I think that the point
raised was a good one, but
inconclusive in its
liberally-oriented breadkown of
the main considerations. First of
all, Ger didn't even take into
account the water-to-land field
mud accumulation ratio worked
up last year by leading physisists.
Also, the weather conditions and
afforementioned abundancy of
water would all but destroy the
so-called "retaining distractors."

Aside from these two points I
think the proposal is a sound one
worthy of consideration by many
in all of our presipicopius
surroundings.

Pseudo-Pinko Implications
Editor, THE DAILY:
On Wednesday, January 21,
the Coalition for an Academic
Community ran an advertisement
in the Daily which listed the
names of the members of the
Student Senate. No explanation
was given. The implication of the
ad was that all these senators were
either members of or lent their
support to the CAC. This is a false
implication, for many of the listed
senators strongly oppose the
policies of the CAC.
