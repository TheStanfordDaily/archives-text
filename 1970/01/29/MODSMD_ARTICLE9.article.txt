# Employment Problems
## Fair Procedure?

graduate student in Computer
Science, on grievance procedure
for student employees.)
Some of the problems caused
by the University's decision to
withhold income tax from TA
salaries might not have occurred if
student employees were covered
by a grievance procedure. As it is,
any employment problems must
be worked out on an ad hoc basis
with the student's supervisor or
department head if he is willing to
talk about it. The supervisor is
under no obligation to listen to
the grievances of student
employees.
Last June the Stanford AFT
submitted a proposal for a
grievance procedure which would
cover all employed graduate
students to the dean of the
graduate division, Lincoln Moses.
During the summer intensive
discussions took place between
representatives of the AFT, the
GSA, the dean of the graduate
division, and the dean of students.
The result was a grievance
procedure similar to the original
AFT proposal. It has three stages
of arbitration going from the
departmental level to the
university level. The first stage is
an informal discussion of the
grievance with the employee's
department head. The department
head must put his decision in
writing. If the employee is not
satisfied, he may appeal the
decision to the appropriate dean
or administrative officer. If he is
not satisfied with the result of his
appeal to the second stage, the
grievance goes to arbitration at
the university level. The
procedures for this stage were the
hardest to agree upon. Since the
third stage receives the cases

which cannot be resolved by the
first two, it is crucial that it work
well.
Grievance Panel
The final result of our
discussions was that the third
stage hearings should be held by
an arbitrator chosen at random
from a group of three who were
selected for the grievance from a
larger panel established each year.
Nominations to the panel were to
be made by any organization of
employees covered by thy
procedure at the beginning of the
year or by the grievant himself
within five days of his appeal of
the decision of stage two. The
nominations were to be given to
the president, who could accept
or reject them. The purpose of
this mechanism is to give the
employer and the employee
roughly equal weight in selecting
the panel of arbitrators.
At this point the people
involved felt that we had reached
an agreement, Dean Moses said
that he would write up a final
draft, discuss it with the
university counsel, and then call
another meeting to discuss the
final result. When that meeting
was called, substantial changes
had been made in stage three. The
grievant could no longer make
nominations to the panel of
arbitrators, but he did have the
right to name those three
members of the panel from whom
the arbitrator for his case would
be chosen by lot. In addition,
however, nominations to the

panel of arbitrators could be made
not only by employee
organizations, but also by the
employer in the form of the
academic senate. The president
would be free to accept only the
nominations of the academic
senate. We deliberately call the
academic senate the employer
because the majority of the
people covered by this grievance
procedure are teaching and
research assistants, virtually all of
whom work for a faculty member.
He controls their hiring and firing,
their workload, and in some cases
the amount of pay they get.
Disagreements with this same
faculty member will form the
substance of most of the
grievances arbitrated under the
procedure.
Student Employee Organization
The reason given for the
change was to protect the
grievance procedure in case no
employee organization submitted
"reasonable" nominations to the
president. Dean Moses told us that
he did not consider students
responsible enough to have
control of this part of the
grievance procedure. Since we all
agreed that any number of
employed students could
constitute themselves as an
"employee organization," the
administration is in effect saying
that it must plan for the
contingency that there will be no
employed students on this campus
responsible enough to nominate
"reasonable" arbitrators for their
own grievance procedure.

Student Employee Organization
The reason given for the
change was to protect the
grievance procedure in case no
employee organization submitted
"reasonable" nominations to the
president. Dean Moses told us that
he did not consider students
responsible enough to have
control of this part of the
grievance procedure. Since we all
agreed that any number of
employed students could
constitute themselves as an
"employee organization," the
administration is in effect saying
that it must plan for the
contingency that there will be no
employed students on this campus
responsible enough to nominate
"reasonable" arbitrators for their
own grievance procedure.
(This is the first half of an
article by Ed Nelson, a 4th year
graduate student in Computer
Science, on grievance procedure
for student employees.)
Some of the problems caused
by the University's decision to
withhold income tax from TA
salaries might not have occurred if
student employees were covered
by a grievance procedure. As it is,
any employment problems must
be worked out on an ad hoc basis
with the student's supervisor or
department head if he is willing to
talk about it. The supervisor is
under no obligation to listen to
the grievances of student
employees.
Last June the Stanford AFT
submitted a proposal for a
grievance procedure which would
cover all employed graduate
students to the dean of the
graduate division, Lincoln Moses.
During the summer intensive
discussions took place between
representatives of the AFT, the
GSA, the dean of the graduate
division, and the dean of students.
The result was a grievance
procedure similar to the original
AFT proposal. It has three stages
of arbitration going from the
departmental level to the
university level. The first stage is
an informal discussion of the
grievance with the employee's
department head. The department
head must put his decision in
writing. If the employee is not
satisfied, he may appeal the
decision to the appropriate dean
or administrative officer. If he is
not satisfied with the result of his
appeal to the second stage, the
grievance goes to arbitration at
the university level. The
procedures for this stage were the
hardest to agree upon. Since the
third stage receives the cases

which cannot be resolved by the
first two, it is crucial that it work
well.
Grievance Panel
The final result of our
discussions was that the third
stage hearings should be held by
an arbitrator chosen at random
from a group of three who were
selected for the grievance from a
larger panel established each year.
Nominations to the panel were to
be made by any organization of
employees covered by thy
procedure at the beginning of the
year or by the grievant himself
within five days of his appeal of
the decision of stage two. The
nominations were to be given to
the president, who could accept
or reject them. The purpose of
this mechanism is to give the
employer and the employee
roughly equal weight in selecting
the panel of arbitrators.
At this point the people
involved felt that we had reached
an agreement, Dean Moses said
that he would write up a final
draft, discuss it with the
university counsel, and then call
another meeting to discuss the
final result. When that meeting
was called, substantial changes
had been made in stage three. The
grievant could no longer make
nominations to the panel of
arbitrators, but he did have the
right to name those three
members of the panel from whom
the arbitrator for his case would
be chosen by lot. In addition,
however, nominations to the

panel of arbitrators could be made
not only by employee
organizations, but also by the
employer in the form of the
academic senate. The president
would be free to accept only the
nominations of the academic
senate. We deliberately call the
academic senate the employer
because the majority of the
people covered by this grievance
procedure are teaching and
research assistants, virtually all of
whom work for a faculty member.
He controls their hiring and firing,
their workload, and in some cases
the amount of pay they get.
Disagreements with this same
