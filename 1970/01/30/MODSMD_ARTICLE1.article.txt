# Bombers Hit North Again

SAIGON (AP) â€” U.S. warplanes
blasted an enemy missile base
Wednesday in the first outbreak
of aerial warfare over North
Vietnam since Lyndon B. Johnson
halted the bombing 15 months
ago in the last days of his
presidency.
The base was hit in the midst of
action that cost the United States
a fighter-bomber and a helicopter,
the U.S. Command reported. The
copter was downed by a North
Vietnamese MIG; the
fighter-bomber was hit by an
antiaircraft shell.
In Paris, the North Vietnamese
delegation to the peace talks
accused the United States of "a
brazen prevocation ... by the
Nixon administration."
The downed fighter-bomber
was one of several accompanying
an unarmed ROTC reconnaissance
plane that came under fire from
SAM surface to air missiles and
other antiaircraft guns northeast
of the pass.
The excort then opened fire on
the missile site, and it was during
this attack that the
fighterbomber, an FlO5, was hit
by a regular antiaircraft shell and
crashed. U.S. sources said one of
the two-man crew was seen to bail
out.
A big HHS3 helicopter was sent
to look for the crew and was
attacked by a MIG firing a missile
and was downed near the North
Vietnamese and Laotian border. It
was unlikely the six helicopter
crewmen survived, sources said,
but they and the two
fighter-bomber pilots were listed
as missing.
As a U.S. source explained it:
"If the missile was accurate and
effective, it would just blow the
helicopter up."
Despite the menace of hostile
guns and planes, a search for the
men is under way, U.S. sources
reported.
This was the first air battle
reported since the bombing of
North Vietnam was halted 15
months ago.
