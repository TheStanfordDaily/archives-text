# A
						Positive Alternative
## Teach Liberation, Not ROTC 
### Michael Sweeney 
Stanford University, in its
better moments, strives to
promote the health and happiness
of mankind. A goodly portion of
the research done here will
actually be used in beneficial
ways, and much of the training
will help students serve the
people, and not enslave them.
Those of us who sincerely want
to increase the good done by
Stanford and lessen the harm had
special reason to be upset by
President Pitzer's actions last
week. He accepted a U.S. Army
plan to restore academic credit to
officer training programs and
replace the three ROTC
departments with a Center for
Military Studies.
A Center for Military Studies
appears to be a superfluous
addition to the University, which
is already associated with
militarism in many other ways.
Fully 12 percent of Stanford's
operating budget comes directly
from the Department of Defense,
and thousands of students depend
on scholarships from the military
establishment. Every male student

must carry in his pocket, under
penalty of the law, a registration
card that reminds him of his
obligation to serve Uncle Sam.
And thanks to the boost to
industrial development from the
Stanford Research Institute and
other University services, no less
than one-third of the
Mid-Peninsula's manufacturing
output goes directly to the Army,
Navy and Air Force.
Since Stanford is already doing
so much for militarism, it seemed
rather pushy last week for the
DOD to insist that we continue as
well to train officers in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, aerial bombing
and other skills. Some of us were
so distraught, in fact, that our
heads were clouded with thoughts
that were a mirror-image of
militarism itself: bombings, arson,
and general mayhem. This was
truly the military's deepest
intrusion on the University—it had
filled our minds with hate.
A More Popular Solution
If we are to criticize the new
Center for Military Studies,

however, it behooves us to
propose an alternative. Is there
some program of instruction that
would be more popular among
students? What pressing social
need could the University help
fill? The answers are not hard to
find. The greatest personal need,
political need and economic need
are all the same: Liberation.
Stanford should establish a Center
for Liberation Studies.
Luckily, the resources to set up
a Center for Liberation Studies
are all close at hand. If we set
aside the plan for a Center for
Military Studies, and instead give
the offices, classrooms, money
and academic credit to the Center
for Liberation Studies, it could be
functioning r n a matter of hours.
For the study and practice of
personal liberation, Stanford
could draw on a wealth of
experience from the
Mid-peninsula Free University.
Where cadets once drilled in rigid
lines, male and female students
could work out their repressions
in marathon encounter. The
liberating conflict of psychodrama

could replace the rote
memorization of the military code
of conduct. Instead of learning to
shine their boots and clean their
guns, students could practice the
useful arts of candlemaking and
motorcycle repair.
Understand the Proletariat
Liberation for a white, wealthy
Stanford student must also
challenge his bourgeois
consciousness. Very few people in
this world shop at Saks, yet it is
often difficult for students
(myself included) to grasp this
fact. The study of liberation must
include an understanding of the
struggles of working people.
Rapping with workers, discovering
labor history and joining the GE
picket line are all activities that
could come from the Center.
Students would not always have
to journey from campus to learn
from workers, of course. Even the
briefest contact with the 6,000
Stanford employees would reveal
t-bat hundreds must support
families on salaries of less than
$500 a month, while the
University systematically blocks

any attempt by workers to form a
union.
The Center for Liberation
Studies would become a valuable
sanctuary for some of the most
courageous fighters for liberation,
the Black Panthers. Instead of
appointing Army officers to the
faculty, Stanford could hire black
militants to share their
experiences with students. They
have invaluable first-hand
knowledge of the techniques of
American fascists. Such
knowledge could soon be vital to
us all. Only last Monday we read
in the Chronicle that a network of
1,000 U.S. Army intelligence
agents is feeding information on
anti-war dissidents to a huge
computer at Fort Holabird,
Maryland. s.
Traditional programs of
academic scholarship would not
be neglected at the Center.
Practically no research and
teaching are now underway at
Stanford on the vital subjects of
imperialism and national
liberation. (The only economics
professor who will talk about
Marx is John Gurley, and he's
going abroad in spring quarter, so
we have to act fast.) There are
huge blank spots in our
knowledge of the world. Our
image of Cuba comes from the
State Department; our news about
the Vietcong comes from the
Associated Press; and our theories
about economic development
come from the perspective of
international oil companies. As
for politics, we were always
taught that democracy had
something to do with the
Democratic and Republican
parties. This concept has proved
somewhat lacking, yet we have
made little progress in discovering
what democracy should be in a
post-industrial leviathan. Clearly
the Center for Liberation Studies
must provide Stanford with a
crash program in the economics
and politics reality.
Proposed Before!!
The Center for Liberation
Studies is not a new idea. An
institute very close to what I am
proposing existed at Stanford in
1966-67. It was called the
Experiment. Housed in a vacant
building on White Plaza, the
Experiment sponsored exciting
programs in encounter, politics
and art. The Stanford
administration decided to kick the
Experiment out of its quarters
after one year, however, and
refused to give it new facilities.
Today, the Placement Service
occupies the old Experiment site.
Students go there for job
interviews with General Electric,
Union Oil, the CIA, State
Department and other prominent
firms.
Those who share a sense of
urgency over the need for a
Center for Liberation Studies can
help the cause by signing a
petition that's around campus.
The petition says, "We demand an
end to ROTC military training
that uses the land, buildings,
academic credit or sponsorship of
Stanford University." It's not just
that ROTC is bad—we need those
facilities for liberation.
