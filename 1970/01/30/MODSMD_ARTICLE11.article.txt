# Staff Coalition Committee Speaks
## Why Can't Staff Solve Staff Problems? 
### Virginia Bacon Joe Hardegree 
Who is the university staff?
The bulletin on the
organization of the university
describes the staff primarily in
professional terms, beginning with
the president and including
faculty members, researchers,
professional librarians, etc., as
well as ''other University
employees as shall be designated
from time to time by the Senate
of the Academic Council." (p. 17,
Stanford University Bulletin
Series 20 no. 1)
A more inclusive definition of
staff is given in The Staff
Handbook. All full-time workers
receive this booklet from the
Personnel Office in Encina Hall
when they begin their
employment by the university.
The booklet describes policy and
benefits for all staff. President
Pitzer's introduction reads: "More
than five thousand staff persons
assist Stanford in meeting its
educational goals by providing the
skills that are necessary to operate
the University. As the range and
complexity of the University's
activities grow, the staff is called
upon to play an increasingly vital
role. Your competence and
resourcefulness in filling this role
are a significant contribution to
the strength of the Stanford each
of us serves."
A third view of the staff of the
university is seen when one
inspects the composition of
presidential and advisory
committees of the university.
These committees include staff
members almost exclusively from
the ranks of administrative
personnel. These individuals are
selected to participate in policy
formulation and decision making
from those of upper management
levels alone.
Wright Committee Questioned
For example, the president's
"Housing Advisory Committee,"
the so-called ''Wright
Committee," includes the
following staff: Raymond
Caldera, listed in the director as a
Minority Employment
Representative of the Personnel
Office; Henry Organ, Assistant
General Secretary in the General
Secretary's Office; Robert
Rosenzweig, Associate Provost;
Edward Scoles, Assistant Business
Manager for University Housing;
and Joel Primack, a theoretical
physicist at SLAC. We are not
questioning the right of these
people to be on the committee.
But we are concerned that the
"staff" on the committee only
represent the higher echelons, the
"administration" level of staff.
Many of us who are interested
in our roles as staff members
within the university are getting
together to discuss this issue. We

are not full-time students, faculty
members or administrators and we
have almost no opportunity for
participation in decision-making
within our community. Policies
which affect us, are formulated
without our help or consultation.
At the ASSU Senate meeting
on November 22, 1969, Provost
Richard Lyman announced the
formation of a Long Range
Financial Planning Committee to
review university budget cuts. At
the present time only faculty
members (5) and students (2)
have been appointed to this
committee even though staff
members with no voice on the
committee will be affected by

these budget cuts just as much as,
if not more than the
constituencies already
represented.
Administrators Only
Another example is the
newly- cr ea ted Presidential
Committee on the Education and
Employment of Women at
Stanford. Three faculty members,
three students, and three
presidential appointees are to
compose this committee. Dr.
Pitzer's appointees are: a chief
librarian, a Dean of the Graduate
School, and an assistant director
of the Office of Public Events. All
of these are administrators in their
respective fields

In the areas of both education
and employment the
non-administrative staff person
offers a unique view and is an
obviously neglected source of
talent within the university. With
regard to choices of opportunities
for women, this is a pertinent
issue since women who have been
denied (or not encouraged to
seek) opportunities for
advancement often fall into the
class of non-administrative
personnel who know the problems
involved in a painfully immediate
way. This is also often the case
with blacks and chicanos and
other minority groups.
With the goal of providing a
broadly-based representation of

staff members on university
committees, the Staff Coalition
Committee has been formed. We
have issued the following
provisional statement of our
purposes but we hope to expand
our goals to include other matters
of common interest to staff
members.
"We the following groups,
hereby acknowledge and affirm
our affiliation with each other for
the purpose of electing staff
representatives to any University
committees established in part to
deal with matters of interest to
staff members. As the Staff
Coalition Committee, we will seek
and accept nominations for

individuals to fill staff positions,
interview candidates and select
qualified individuals to serve as
staff representatives."
Meeting to be Held
If any staff member, either as
an individual or as a group
representative, is interested in
joining us in these considerations,
we invite you to attend the next
meeting of the Staff Coalition
Committee scheduled for Monday
evening, February 2. For further
details, please contact Virginia
Bacon, x 5289.

from those of upper management
levels alone.
Wright Committee Questioned
For example, the president's
"Housing Advisory Committee,"
the so-called ''Wright
Committee," includes the
following staff: Raymond
Caldera, listed in the director as a
Minority Employment
Representative of the Personnel
Office; Henry Organ, Assistant
General Secretary in the General
Secretary's Office; Robert
Rosenzweig, Associate Provost;
Edward Scoles, Assistant Business
Manager for University Housing;
and Joel Primack, a theoretical
physicist at SLAC. We are not
questioning the right of these
people to be on the committee.
But we are concerned that the
"staff" on the committee only
represent the higher echelons, the
"administration" level of staff.
Many of us who are interested
in our roles as staff members
within the university are getting
together to discuss this issue. We

are not full-time students, faculty
members or administrators and we
have almost no opportunity for
participation in decision-making
within our community. Policies
which affect us, are formulated
without our help or consultation.
At the ASSU Senate meeting
on November 22, 1969, Provost
Richard Lyman announced the
formation of a Long Range
Financial Planning Committee to
review university budget cuts. At
the present time only faculty
members (5) and students (2)
have been appointed to this
committee even though staff
members with no voice on the
committee will be affected by

these budget cuts just as much as,
if not more than the
constituencies already
represented.
Administrators Only
Another example is the
newly- cr ea ted Presidential
Committee on the Education and
Employment of Women at
Stanford. Three faculty members,
three students, and three
presidential appointees are to
compose this committee. Dr.
Pitzer's appointees are: a chief
librarian, a Dean of the Graduate
School, and an assistant director
of the Office of Public Events. All
of these are administrators in their
respective fields

In the areas of both education
and employment the
non-administrative staff person
offers a unique view and is an
obviously neglected source of
talent within the university. With
regard to choices of opportunities
for women, this is a pertinent
issue since women who have been
denied (or not encouraged to
seek) opportunities for
advancement often fall into the
class of non-administrative
personnel who know the problems
involved in a painfully immediate
way. This is also often the case
with blacks and chicanos and
other minority groups.
With the goal of providing a
broadly-based representation of

staff members on university
committees, the Staff Coalition
Committee has been formed. We
have issued the following
provisional statement of our
purposes but we hope to expand
our goals to include other matters
of common interest to staff
members.
"We the following groups,
hereby acknowledge and affirm
our affiliation with each other for
the purpose of electing staff
representatives to any University
committees established in part to
deal with matters of interest to
staff members. As the Staff
Coalition Committee, we will seek
and accept nominations for

individuals to fill staff positions,
interview candidates and select
qualified individuals to serve as
staff representatives."
Meeting to be Held
If any staff member, either as
an individual or as a group
representative, is interested in
joining us in these considerations,
we invite you to attend the next
meeting of the Staff Coalition
Committee scheduled for Monday
evening, February 2. For further
details, please contact Virginia
Bacon, x 5289.

Research Assistant in the
Department of Genetics. Joe
Hardegree is a member of the
United Campus Ministry.)
Who is the university staff?
The bulletin on the
organization of the university
describes the staff primarily in
professional terms, beginning with
the president and including
faculty members, researchers,
professional librarians, etc., as
well as ''other University
employees as shall be designated
from time to time by the Senate
of the Academic Council." (p. 17,
Stanford University Bulletin
Series 20 no. 1)
A more inclusive definition of
staff is given in The Staff
Handbook. All full-time workers
receive this booklet from the
Personnel Office in Encina Hall
when they begin their
employment by the university.
The booklet describes policy and
benefits for all staff. President
Pitzer's introduction reads: "More
than five thousand staff persons
assist Stanford in meeting its
educational goals by providing the
skills that are necessary to operate
the University. As the range and
complexity of the University's
activities grow, the staff is called
upon to play an increasingly vital
role. Your competence and
resourcefulness in filling this role
are a significant contribution to
the strength of the Stanford each
of us serves."
A third view of the staff of the
university is seen when one
inspects the composition of
presidential and advisory
committees of the university.
These committees include staff
members almost exclusively from
the ranks of administrative
personnel. These individuals are
selected to participate in policy
formulation and decision making
from those of upper management
levels alone.

these budget cuts just as much as,
if not more than the
constituencies already
represented.
Administrators Only
Another example is the
newly- cr ea ted Presidential
Committee on the Education and
Employment of Women at
Stanford. Three faculty members,
three students, and three
presidential appointees are to
compose this committee. Dr.
Pitzer's appointees are: a chief
librarian, a Dean of the Graduate
School, and an assistant director
of the Office of Public Events. All
of these are administrators in their
respective fields

In the areas of both education
and employment the
non-administrative staff person
offers a unique view and is an
obviously neglected source of
talent within the university. With
regard to choices of opportunities
for women, this is a pertinent
issue since women who have been
denied (or not encouraged to
seek) opportunities for
advancement often fall into the
class of non-administrative
personnel who know the problems
involved in a painfully immediate
way. This is also often the case
with blacks and chicanos and
other minority groups.
With the goal of providing a
broadly-based representation of

staff members on university
committees, the Staff Coalition
Committee has been formed. We
have issued the following
provisional statement of our
purposes but we hope to expand
our goals to include other matters
of common interest to staff
members.
"We the following groups,
hereby acknowledge and affirm
our affiliation with each other for
the purpose of electing staff
representatives to any University
committees established in part to
deal with matters of interest to
staff members. As the Staff
Coalition Committee, we will seek
and accept nominations for

individuals to fill staff positions,
interview candidates and select
qualified individuals to serve as
staff representatives."
Meeting to be Held
If any staff member, either as
an individual or as a group
representative, is interested in
joining us in these considerations,
we invite you to attend the next
meeting of the Staff Coalition
Committee scheduled for Monday
evening, February 2. For further
details, please contact Virginia
Bacon, x 5289.

Who is the university staff?
The bulletin on the
organization of the university
describes the staff primarily in
professional terms, beginning with
the president and including
faculty members, researchers,
professional librarians, etc., as
well as ''other University
employees as shall be designated
from time to time by the Senate
of the Academic Council." (p. 17,
Stanford University Bulletin
Series 20 no. 1)
A more inclusive definition of
staff is given in The Staff
Handbook. All full-time workers
receive this booklet from the
Personnel Office in Encina Hall
when they begin their
employment by the university.
The booklet describes policy and
benefits for all staff. President
Pitzer's introduction reads: "More
than five thousand staff persons
assist Stanford in meeting its
educational goals by providing the
skills that are necessary to operate
the University. As the range and
complexity of the University's
activities grow, the staff is called
upon to play an increasingly vital
role. Your competence and
resourcefulness in filling this role
are a significant contribution to
the strength of the Stanford each
of us serves."
A third view of the staff of the
university is seen when one
inspects the composition of
presidential and advisory
committees of the university.
These committees include staff
members almost exclusively from
the ranks of administrative
personnel. These individuals are
selected to participate in policy
formulation and decision making
from those of upper management
levels alone.
Wright Committee Questioned
For example, the president's
"Housing Advisory Committee,"
the so-called ''Wright
Committee," includes the
following staff: Raymond
Caldera, listed in the director as a
Minority Employment
Representative of the Personnel
Office; Henry Organ, Assistant
General Secretary in the General
Secretary's Office; Robert
Rosenzweig, Associate Provost;
Edward Scoles, Assistant Business
Manager for University Housing;
and Joel Primack, a theoretical
physicist at SLAC. We are not
questioning the right of these
people to be on the committee.
But we are concerned that the
"staff" on the committee only
represent the higher echelons, the
"administration" level of staff.
Many of us who are interested
in our roles as staff members
within the university are getting
together to discuss this issue. We

are not full-time students, faculty
members or administrators and we
have almost no opportunity for
participation in decision-making
within our community. Policies
which affect us, are formulated
without our help or consultation.
At the ASSU Senate meeting
on November 22, 1969, Provost
Richard Lyman announced the
formation of a Long Range
Financial Planning Committee to
review university budget cuts. At
the present time only faculty
members (5) and students (2)
have been appointed to this
committee even though staff
members with no voice on the
committee will be affected by

these budget cuts just as much as,
if not more than the
constituencies already
represented.
