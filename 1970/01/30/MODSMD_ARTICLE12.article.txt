Food Deficit
Editor, THE DAILY:
In reference to the "Meal
Ticket Hassles" article in the
DAILY dated January 29, 1970, I
would like to correct an error and
to add a few additional points.
The Food Service Department's
anticipated operating deficit,
incorrectly stated as $3,000, will
surpass $300,000 for the 1969-70
academic year. A major portion of
this deficit can be attributed to
the long overdue and well
deserved salary increase for the
Food Service employees, and to
the fact that residents are now
provided with unlimited servings
fo food at all meals and choice of
entrees at most meals.
But a sizeable loss is attributed
to non-residents' and
non-students' use of the dining
room facilities without paying for
their food. Also, we find that
many residents who have
purchased the no-breakfast plan
and others who have been granted
meal exemptions in order to work
or for medical reasons continue to
eat from the dining room buffet
tables or share trays of food with
board paying residents. This
"sneal-in" trade constitutes a real
financial burden problem.
Who bears this burden? I have
the impression that far too many
students think that "the
University" foots the bill. Wrong.
The people who pay for the
altered meal tickets, the shared
trays, the free-loading at buffet

tables, or for any other abuse are
the board-paying students. When
is that group going to wake up to
the fact that they are suffering
from the abuses by non-residents
and fellow students?
Surprising as it may seem—the
Food Service Department is
supported solely by income
derived from board contracts and
residents. There are absolutely no
financial or food subsidies to
support the Food Service
Program. At the present time the
cost of services far exceeds the
board income. Needless to say,
board rates will have to be
appreciably increased annually to
offset these anticipated operating
deficits. Therefore, is it too
unreasonable to try and reduce or
eliminate unauthorized use of the
dining rooms?

Editor, THE DAILY:
Many thanks to Michael
Sweeney for his revealing article
on the ROTC drama at Stanford
(Stanford DAILY, Jan. 22). It is
not surprising that ROTC has
been the issue of campus crisis. To
myself, the mere presence of
ROTC on campus symbolizes the
greater omnipresence and
intervention of the military in our
communities and in our lives. It is
a bit disturbing however, to see
that little if anything has been

learned or gained from conflict
past. I doubt if I am the first to
observe that what is happening at
Stanford is a carbon copy of what
happened at Harvard nearly a year
ago. And I shall be the least
surprised if Stanford erupts as
Harvard did.
Regardless of the outcome of
the Stanford ROTC battle, its
features thus far only serve to
accentuate the need to irradicate
ROTC wholly and
unconditionally from the campus
community. The Department of
Defense has demonstrated that it
will not compromise and provide
an ROTC program that is
acceptable to the academic
community. ROTC will be on its
terms or not at all. Such a
strong-arm approach is hardly
unexpected from an organization
of such power and totalitarian
authority as the Department of
Defense. That a university
president has knuckled-under to
this authority only serves to verify
the sobering extent to which this
governmental agency has control
over our lives. To those of us who
are concerned with the extent of
this control, the question of
ROTC on campus has become an

easy one. It is no longer confused
by idealistic issues of academic
credit, or "opportunity" for
students who might wish to
choose ROTC study, or even of
controlling the military by
infiltrating it with officers of
college calibre. It is simply a
question of the balance of power;
to the people or to the military.
Are we going to tell the
Department of Defense how
ROTC will be allowed to co-exist
on our campuses or will the
Department of Defense tell us? I
have become sufficiently
convinced of the uncompromising
position of the enemy. Now he
must leave.

Olympic Club Controversy
Editor, THE DAILY:
In November of last year the
Olympic Club sponsored a
distance race in Golden Gate Park.
To the first 75 finishers were

awarded t-shirts with the words
"The Olympic Club" on the front.
Subsequent to my acceptance of
one of these I have learned that
the Olympic Club practices
policies of racial discrimination.
For this reason the long distance
runners of that club have recently
resigned en masse. I commend
them for so doing.
I have talked the matter over
with other members of my own
club and with a black student of
my acquaintance and have come
to the conclusion that I don't care
to be seen with "The Olympic
Club" emblazoned across my
chest. It would be in direct
contradiction to the spirit of
amateur athletics. For this reason
I have returned the shirt with a
letter explaining my feelings to
the Olympic Club.
I would hope that in the future
some other organization can be
found to sponsor the regular
A.A.U. events, unless by some
unlikely chance the Olympic Club
changes its policy with regard to
membership and race. (Note that
Stanford discontinued water polo
matches with the club due to their
policy some years ago).

by idealistic issues of academic
credit, or "opportunity" for
students who might wish to
choose ROTC study, or even of
controlling the military by
infiltrating it with officers of
college calibre. It is simply a
question of the balance of power;
to the people or to the military.
Are we going to tell the
Department of Defense how
ROTC will be allowed to co-exist
on our campuses or will the
Department of Defense tell us? I
have become sufficiently
convinced of the uncompromising
position of the enemy. Now he

Olympic Club Controversy
Editor, THE DAILY:
In November of last year the
Olympic Club sponsored a
distance race in Golden Gate Park.
To the first 75 finishers were

awarded t-shirts with the words
"The Olympic Club" on the front.
Subsequent to my acceptance of
one of these I have learned that
the Olympic Club practices
policies of racial discrimination.
For this reason the long distance
runners of that club have recently
resigned en masse. I commend
them for so doing.
I have talked the matter over
with other members of my own
club and with a black student of
my acquaintance and have come
to the conclusion that I don't care
to be seen with "The Olympic
Club" emblazoned across my
chest. It would be in direct
contradiction to the spirit of
amateur athletics. For this reason
I have returned the shirt with a
letter explaining my feelings to
the Olympic Club.
I would hope that in the future
some other organization can be
found to sponsor the regular
A.A.U. events, unless by some
unlikely chance the Olympic Club
changes its policy with regard to
membership and race. (Note that
Stanford discontinued water polo
matches with the club due to their
policy some years ago).

In reference to the "Meal
Ticket Hassles" article in the
DAILY dated January 29, 1970, I
would like to correct an error and
to add a few additional points.
The Food Service Department's
anticipated operating deficit,
incorrectly stated as $3,000, will
surpass $300,000 for the 1969-70
academic year. A major portion of
this deficit can be attributed to
the long overdue and well
deserved salary increase for the
Food Service employees, and to
the fact that residents are now
provided with unlimited servings
fo food at all meals and choice of
entrees at most meals.
But a sizeable loss is attributed
to non-residents' and
non-students' use of the dining
room facilities without paying for
their food. Also, we find that
many residents who have
purchased the no-breakfast plan
and others who have been granted
meal exemptions in order to work
or for medical reasons continue to
eat from the dining room buffet
tables or share trays of food with
board paying residents. This
"sneal-in" trade constitutes a real
financial burden problem.
Who bears this burden? I have
the impression that far too many
students think that "the
University" foots the bill. Wrong.
The people who pay for the
altered meal tickets, the shared
trays, the free-loading at buffet

tables, or for any other abuse are
the board-paying students. When
is that group going to wake up to
the fact that they are suffering
from the abuses by non-residents
and fellow students?
Surprising as it may seem—the
Food Service Department is
supported solely by income
derived from board contracts and
residents. There are absolutely no
financial or food subsidies to
support the Food Service
Program. At the present time the
cost of services far exceeds the
board income. Needless to say,
board rates will have to be
appreciably increased annually to
offset these anticipated operating
deficits. Therefore, is it too
unreasonable to try and reduce or
eliminate unauthorized use of the
dining rooms?

Editor, THE DAILY:
Many thanks to Michael
Sweeney for his revealing article
on the ROTC drama at Stanford
(Stanford DAILY, Jan. 22). It is
not surprising that ROTC has
been the issue of campus crisis. To
myself, the mere presence of
ROTC on campus symbolizes the
greater omnipresence and
intervention of the military in our
communities and in our lives. It is
a bit disturbing however, to see
that little if anything has been

learned or gained from conflict
past. I doubt if I am the first to
observe that what is happening at
Stanford is a carbon copy of what
happened at Harvard nearly a year
ago. And I shall be the least
surprised if Stanford erupts as
Harvard did.
Regardless of the outcome of
the Stanford ROTC battle, its
features thus far only serve to
accentuate the need to irradicate
ROTC wholly and
unconditionally from the campus
community. The Department of
Defense has demonstrated that it
will not compromise and provide
an ROTC program that is
acceptable to the academic
community. ROTC will be on its
terms or not at all. Such a
strong-arm approach is hardly
unexpected from an organization
of such power and totalitarian
authority as the Department of
Defense. That a university
president has knuckled-under to
this authority only serves to verify
the sobering extent to which this
governmental agency has control
over our lives. To those of us who
are concerned with the extent of
this control, the question of
ROTC on campus has become an

easy one. It is no longer confused

Program. At the present time the
cost of services far exceeds the
board income. Needless to say,
board rates will have to be
appreciably increased annually to
offset these anticipated operating
deficits. Therefore, is it too
unreasonable to try and reduce or
eliminate unauthorized use of the
dining rooms?

Editor, THE DAILY:
Many thanks to Michael
Sweeney for his revealing article
on the ROTC drama at Stanford
(Stanford DAILY, Jan. 22). It is
not surprising that ROTC has
been the issue of campus crisis. To
myself, the mere presence of
ROTC on campus symbolizes the
greater omnipresence and
intervention of the military in our
communities and in our lives. It is
a bit disturbing however, to see
that little if anything has been

learned or gained from conflict
past. I doubt if I am the first to
observe that what is happening at
Stanford is a carbon copy of what
happened at Harvard nearly a year
ago. And I shall be the least
surprised if Stanford erupts as
Harvard did.
Regardless of the outcome of
the Stanford ROTC battle, its
features thus far only serve to
accentuate the need to irradicate
ROTC wholly and
unconditionally from the campus
community. The Department of
Defense has demonstrated that it
will not compromise and provide
an ROTC program that is
acceptable to the academic
community. ROTC will be on its
terms or not at all. Such a
strong-arm approach is hardly
unexpected from an organization
of such power and totalitarian
authority as the Department of
Defense. That a university
president has knuckled-under to
this authority only serves to verify
the sobering extent to which this
governmental agency has control
over our lives. To those of us who
are concerned with the extent of
this control, the question of
ROTC on campus has become an

easy one. It is no longer confused
by idealistic issues of academic
credit, or "opportunity" for
students who might wish to
choose ROTC study, or even of
controlling the military by
infiltrating it with officers of
college calibre. It is simply a
question of the balance of power;
to the people or to the military.
Are we going to tell the
Department of Defense how
ROTC will be allowed to co-exist
on our campuses or will the
Department of Defense tell us? I
have become sufficiently
convinced of the uncompromising
position of the enemy. Now he
must leave.

Olympic Club Controversy
Editor, THE DAILY:
In November of last year the
Olympic Club sponsored a
distance race in Golden Gate Park.
To the first 75 finishers were

awarded t-shirts with the words
"The Olympic Club" on the front.
Subsequent to my acceptance of
one of these I have learned that
the Olympic Club practices
policies of racial discrimination.
For this reason the long distance
runners of that club have recently
resigned en masse. I commend
them for so doing.
I have talked the matter over
with other members of my own
club and with a black student of
my acquaintance and have come
to the conclusion that I don't care
to be seen with "The Olympic
Club" emblazoned across my
chest. It would be in direct
contradiction to the spirit of
amateur athletics. For this reason
I have returned the shirt with a
letter explaining my feelings to
the Olympic Club.
I would hope that in the future
some other organization can be
found to sponsor the regular
A.A.U. events, unless by some
unlikely chance the Olympic Club
changes its policy with regard to
membership and race. (Note that
Stanford discontinued water polo
matches with the club due to their
policy some years ago).

Food Deficit
Editor, THE DAILY:
In reference to the "Meal
Ticket Hassles" article in the
DAILY dated January 29, 1970, I
would like to correct an error and
to add a few additional points.
The Food Service Department's
anticipated operating deficit,
incorrectly stated as $3,000, will
surpass $300,000 for the 1969-70
academic year. A major portion of
this deficit can be attributed to
the long overdue and well
deserved salary increase for the
Food Service employees, and to
the fact that residents are now
provided with unlimited servings
fo food at all meals and choice of
entrees at most meals.
But a sizeable loss is attributed
to non-residents' and
non-students' use of the dining
room facilities without paying for
their food. Also, we find that
many residents who have
purchased the no-breakfast plan
and others who have been granted
meal exemptions in order to work
or for medical reasons continue to
eat from the dining room buffet
tables or share trays of food with
board paying residents. This
"sneal-in" trade constitutes a real
financial burden problem.
Who bears this burden? I have
the impression that far too many
students think that "the
University" foots the bill. Wrong.
The people who pay for the
altered meal tickets, the shared
trays, the free-loading at buffet

tables, or for any other abuse are
the board-paying students. When
is that group going to wake up to
the fact that they are suffering
from the abuses by non-residents
and fellow students?
Surprising as it may seem—the
Food Service Department is
supported solely by income
derived from board contracts and
residents. There are absolutely no
financial or food subsidies to
support the Food Service
Program. At the present time the
cost of services far exceeds the
board income. Needless to say,
board rates will have to be
appreciably increased annually to
offset these anticipated operating
deficits. Therefore, is it too
unreasonable to try and reduce or
