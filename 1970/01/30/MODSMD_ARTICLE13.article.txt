# Grievances Aired
## Problems Abound In Europe 
### BARRY ASKINAS DENNIS PERLUSS 
One topic of conversation
guaranteed to spark animated
conversation among a majority of
Stanford undergraduates is the
Overseas Campus program.
Almost 60 percent of Stanford
undergraduates have attended one
of the five foreign campuses. Most
of these students would agree
with the senior history major who
declared, "The time I spent
overseas was the most important
educational experience of my
undergraduate years."
The vast majority of students
who have returned from a foreign
campus have an almost unlimited
collection of short anecdotes and
rambling tales of hitchhiking and
native customs and foreign food.
Inevitably, however, if the
conversation continues for any
length of time the focus will turn
to the many problems and
shortcomings that mar what was
once considered an almost perfect
program.
Change Slow
Despite often expressed
criticisms, change in the program
has been slow and halting.
Jim Scheimer, Trancos
sponsor, declared:"Students who
have gone overseas whether
recently or long ago all seem to
have the same complaints; but
nothing has been done about
them. While you're there you are
too far away from the home
campus to affect change, and
when you come back, you get
involved in other things and
rapidly loose interest in pushing
through necessary reforms."
Part of the reason that students
fail to follow-up on complaints is
that each student's individual
criticisms often seem insignificant
when compared with the
tremendous benefits of the
program.
When drawn together,
however, the criticisms mount to
a cacophonous crescendo:
mismanagement and inflexibility
in the home office together with
complaints of inadequate food,
bad courses, and poor relations
between the foreign campuses and
the Stanford administrative
headquarters.
It is a good program fraught
with many critical problems.
Fiscal Success
Mark Edwards, graduate
student in history and a member
of the Study Education at
Stanford (SES) Overseas Campus
committee, explained that fiscal
arrangements account for much of

the program's popularity with the
Stanford administration.
"The program made money for
the university. Dr. Walker always
came in with a perfect budget.
The average student program costs
less overseas than here. In fact,
the program put money, into
general funds."
Russ Worley of the Controller's
Office confirmed that the
program puts money into general
funds. He cautioned, however,
that because of the complicated
accounting procedures used by
the Overseas Campuses Office, it
would be wrong to assume that a
profit is made.
"Tuition and room and board
charges to students are in excess
of the direct cost of the
program," he declared. Examples
given of indirect costs were
Controller's Fees, Business Office
fees for negotiating contracts and
library fees.
Opportunities Lost
"Dr. Walker, Vice-Provost
Howard Brooks, and Business
Manager Dwight Adams negotiate
the contracts in Europe with local
agencies," explained Edwards.
"The trustees refused to allow
land purchases over there and this
forced Stanford into rentals and
leases.
"Neither Brooks nor Walker is
familiar enough with local
conditions to drive hard bargains
and they miss out on a number of
opportunities to save money," he
continued.
Walker's Junkets
One instance of waste
frequently criticized by faculty
members is Walker's frequent trips
to Europe and his penchant for
flying first class. One of the
faculty members of the SES
Overseas Committee flatly stated,
"The travel budget is too large."
A former resident assistant at
one of the campuses added,
"There is no justification for all
those people from the home
office coming over so often. And
it's not clear what concrete things
they do when they come over.
"Whenever Mrs. Allen or Dr.
Walker come over, there's just one
party after another."
One of the recently returned
resident assistants commented
that the "whole question of the
relation between the overseas
campuses and the home office
needs to be investigated.
Time Wasted
"The secretaries seem to spend
a lot of time doing useless things
when so much that is substantive
needs to be done, for example

revising the handbooks—ltaly
hasn't been done in five
years —and improving the
orientation programs.
"We got a telegraph at the
foreign campus notifying us that
the telephone extension for the
home campus office had been
changed.
"The next week, a long
mimeographed memo arrived
telling about the change and
explaining that if we had
mistakenly tried to call the old
extension, it would have
automatically gone to the new
extension.
"How much did that waste in
telegram fees and secretarial
time?"
"Then there is the whole area
of 'administrative memoranda.'
This stuff is absolute garbage.
"This is material which Dr.
Paul Han ley (the Associate
Director) generates and we never
use it during the year. They are
about basic things which are so
basic that they are absolutely
useless.
One faculty member who has
been overseas and is now
influential in the program
explained, "Walker defines the
overseas operation as how to
maintain his position.
"Here is a guy whose big bag is
efficient business operation and
then he loses $48,000 on the
Harlaxton-Cliveden move. How
much are the official opening
ceremonies at Cliveden going to
cost,"he queried.
Food Hit
Frequently linked with
examples of Walker's personal
extravagence are complaints
about the poor quality of food
the students eat overseas.
David Mannheimer, senior in
philosophy, who visited the
French campus this summer
commented that, "Walker stays at
the Hotel Metropole in Tours and
eats in the best French restaurants
while the students eat what the
French students eat which is crap.
"Since Stanford students pay
Stanford board rates while
overseas they are paying about

a dollar or more for a meal that
costs a French student about 35
cents."
Investigation by students at the
Vienna campus revealed that the
Overseas Campuses Office had
negotiated a contract with Caritas
(the building owners) which
allowed the chef to allocate only
32 cents per student per day for
food.
Inflcx ibility
Administrative inflexibility and
unwillingness to try new ideas has
frequently been the focal point of
criticism.
James Viney, senior in
Psychology, who spent six months
at the Austrian campus called
Walker "pompous and unwilling
to listen to students."
"We tried to talk to him after
we returned home about
liberalizing residence rules. At
that time all Walker would do was
come out with pious platitudes
that students wouldn't be
responsible enough without a
rule."
Edwards added to the
inflexibility theme: "They are
limited to their searches for
facilities by their fixed conception
that a program must consist of 80
students and two faculty
members.
"A building that might be very
attractive in terms of cost and
location just might not be that
exact size."
Any list of complaints about
the overseas campuses is bound to
be incomplete since nearly every
returnee has his own special
grievance to air.
Moreover, those students and
faculty members who discuss
these problems will readily admit
that many of the criticisms are
not earth-shaking and that no
program will ever be perfect.
What will not be admitted,
however, is that change for the
better is impossible.
Extravagance and waste can be
lessened. Inflexibility can be
replaced by an active seeking for
innovation. A good program, with
the proper leadership, can once
again become a great program.

bad courses, and poor relations
between the foreign campuses and
the Stanford administrative
headquarters.
It is a good program fraught
with many critical problems.
Fiscal Success
Mark Edwards, graduate
student in history and a member
of the Study Education at
Stanford (SES) Overseas Campus
committee, explained that fiscal
arrangements account for much of

the program's popularity with the
Stanford administration.
"The program made money for
the university. Dr. Walker always
came in with a perfect budget.
The average student program costs
less overseas than here. In fact,
the program put money, into
general funds."
Russ Worley of the Controller's
Office confirmed that the
program puts money into general
funds. He cautioned, however,
that because of the complicated
accounting procedures used by
the Overseas Campuses Office, it
would be wrong to assume that a
profit is made.
"Tuition and room and board
charges to students are in excess
of the direct cost of the
program," he declared. Examples
given of indirect costs were
Controller's Fees, Business Office
fees for negotiating contracts and
library fees.
Opportunities Lost
"Dr. Walker, Vice-Provost
Howard Brooks, and Business
Manager Dwight Adams negotiate
the contracts in Europe with local
agencies," explained Edwards.
"The trustees refused to allow
land purchases over there and this
forced Stanford into rentals and
leases.
"Neither Brooks nor Walker is
familiar enough with local
conditions to drive hard bargains
and they miss out on a number of
opportunities to save money," he
continued.
Walker's Junkets
One instance of waste
frequently criticized by faculty
members is Walker's frequent trips
to Europe and his penchant for
flying first class. One of the
faculty members of the SES
Overseas Committee flatly stated,
"The travel budget is too large."
A former resident assistant at
one of the campuses added,
"There is no justification for all
those people from the home
office coming over so often. And
it's not clear what concrete things
they do when they come over.
"Whenever Mrs. Allen or Dr.
Walker come over, there's just one
party after another."
One of the recently returned
resident assistants commented
that the "whole question of the
relation between the overseas
campuses and the home office
needs to be investigated.
Time Wasted
"The secretaries seem to spend
a lot of time doing useless things
when so much that is substantive
needs to be done, for example

revising the handbooks—ltaly
hasn't been done in five
years —and improving the
orientation programs.
"We got a telegraph at the
foreign campus notifying us that
the telephone extension for the
home campus office had been
changed.
"The next week, a long
mimeographed memo arrived
telling about the change and
explaining that if we had
mistakenly tried to call the old
extension, it would have
automatically gone to the new
extension.
"How much did that waste in
telegram fees and secretarial
time?"
"Then there is the whole area
of 'administrative memoranda.'
This stuff is absolute garbage.
"This is material which Dr.
Paul Han ley (the Associate
Director) generates and we never
use it during the year. They are
about basic things which are so
basic that they are absolutely
useless.
One faculty member who has
been overseas and is now
influential in the program
explained, "Walker defines the
overseas operation as how to
maintain his position.
"Here is a guy whose big bag is
efficient business operation and
then he loses $48,000 on the
Harlaxton-Cliveden move. How
much are the official opening
ceremonies at Cliveden going to
cost,"he queried.
Food Hit
Frequently linked with
examples of Walker's personal
extravagence are complaints
about the poor quality of food
the students eat overseas.
David Mannheimer, senior in
philosophy, who visited the
French campus this summer
commented that, "Walker stays at
the Hotel Metropole in Tours and
eats in the best French restaurants
while the students eat what the
French students eat which is crap.
"Since Stanford students pay
Stanford board rates while
overseas they are paying about

a dollar or more for a meal that
costs a French student about 35
cents."
Investigation by students at the
Vienna campus revealed that the
Overseas Campuses Office had
negotiated a contract with Caritas
(the building owners) which
allowed the chef to allocate only
32 cents per student per day for
food.
Inflcx ibility
Administrative inflexibility and
unwillingness to try new ideas has
frequently been the focal point of
criticism.
James Viney, senior in
Psychology, who spent six months
at the Austrian campus called
Walker "pompous and unwilling
to listen to students."
"We tried to talk to him after
we returned home about
liberalizing residence rules. At
that time all Walker would do was
come out with pious platitudes
that students wouldn't be
responsible enough without a
rule."
Edwards added to the
inflexibility theme: "They are
limited to their searches for
facilities by their fixed conception
that a program must consist of 80
students and two faculty
members.
"A building that might be very
attractive in terms of cost and
location just might not be that
exact size."
Any list of complaints about
the overseas campuses is bound to
be incomplete since nearly every
returnee has his own special
grievance to air.
Moreover, those students and
faculty members who discuss
these problems will readily admit
that many of the criticisms are
not earth-shaking and that no
program will ever be perfect.
What will not be admitted,
however, is that change for the
better is impossible.
Extravagance and waste can be
lessened. Inflexibility can be
replaced by an active seeking for
innovation. A good program, with
the proper leadership, can once
again become a great program.
One topic of conversation
guaranteed to spark animated
conversation among a majority of
Stanford undergraduates is the
Overseas Campus program.
Almost 60 percent of Stanford
undergraduates have attended one
of the five foreign campuses. Most
of these students would agree
with the senior history major who
declared, "The time I spent
overseas was the most important
educational experience of my
undergraduate years."
The vast majority of students
who have returned from a foreign
campus have an almost unlimited
collection of short anecdotes and
rambling tales of hitchhiking and
native customs and foreign food.
Inevitably, however, if the
conversation continues for any
length of time the focus will turn
to the many problems and
shortcomings that mar what was
once considered an almost perfect
program.
Change Slow
Despite often expressed
criticisms, change in the program
has been slow and halting.
Jim Scheimer, Trancos
sponsor, declared:"Students who
have gone overseas whether
recently or long ago all seem to
have the same complaints; but
nothing has been done about
them. While you're there you are
too far away from the home
campus to affect change, and
when you come back, you get
involved in other things and
rapidly loose interest in pushing
through necessary reforms."
Part of the reason that students
fail to follow-up on complaints is
that each student's individual
criticisms often seem insignificant
when compared with the
tremendous benefits of the
program.
When drawn together,
however, the criticisms mount to
a cacophonous crescendo:
mismanagement and inflexibility
in the home office together with
complaints of inadequate food,
bad courses, and poor relations
between the foreign campuses and
the Stanford administrative
headquarters.

to Europe and his penchant for
flying first class. One of the
faculty members of the SES
Overseas Committee flatly stated,
"The travel budget is too large."
A former resident assistant at
one of the campuses added,
"There is no justification for all
those people from the home
office coming over so often. And
it's not clear what concrete things
they do when they come over.
"Whenever Mrs. Allen or Dr.
Walker come over, there's just one
party after another."
One of the recently returned
resident assistants commented
that the "whole question of the
relation between the overseas
campuses and the home office
needs to be investigated.
Time Wasted
"The secretaries seem to spend
a lot of time doing useless things
when so much that is substantive
needs to be done, for example

revising the handbooks—ltaly
hasn't been done in five
years —and improving the
orientation programs.
"We got a telegraph at the
foreign campus notifying us that
the telephone extension for the
home campus office had been
changed.
"The next week, a long
mimeographed memo arrived
telling about the change and
explaining that if we had
mistakenly tried to call the old
extension, it would have
automatically gone to the new
extension.
"How much did that waste in
telegram fees and secretarial
time?"
"Then there is the whole area
of 'administrative memoranda.'
This stuff is absolute garbage.
"This is material which Dr.
Paul Han ley (the Associate
Director) generates and we never
use it during the year. They are
about basic things which are so
basic that they are absolutely
useless.
One faculty member who has
been overseas and is now
influential in the program
explained, "Walker defines the
overseas operation as how to
maintain his position.
"Here is a guy whose big bag is
efficient business operation and
then he loses $48,000 on the
Harlaxton-Cliveden move. How
much are the official opening
ceremonies at Cliveden going to
cost,"he queried.
Food Hit
Frequently linked with
examples of Walker's personal
extravagence are complaints
about the poor quality of food
the students eat overseas.
David Mannheimer, senior in
philosophy, who visited the
French campus this summer
commented that, "Walker stays at
the Hotel Metropole in Tours and
eats in the best French restaurants
while the students eat what the
French students eat which is crap.
"Since Stanford students pay
Stanford board rates while
overseas they are paying about

a dollar or more for a meal that
costs a French student about 35
cents."
Investigation by students at the
Vienna campus revealed that the
Overseas Campuses Office had
negotiated a contract with Caritas
(the building owners) which
allowed the chef to allocate only
32 cents per student per day for
food.
Inflcx ibility
Administrative inflexibility and
unwillingness to try new ideas has
frequently been the focal point of
criticism.
James Viney, senior in
Psychology, who spent six months
at the Austrian campus called
Walker "pompous and unwilling
to listen to students."
"We tried to talk to him after
we returned home about
liberalizing residence rules. At
that time all Walker would do was
come out with pious platitudes
that students wouldn't be
responsible enough without a
rule."
Edwards added to the
inflexibility theme: "They are
limited to their searches for
facilities by their fixed conception
that a program must consist of 80
students and two faculty
members.
"A building that might be very
attractive in terms of cost and
location just might not be that
exact size."
Any list of complaints about
the overseas campuses is bound to
be incomplete since nearly every
returnee has his own special
grievance to air.
Moreover, those students and
faculty members who discuss
these problems will readily admit
that many of the criticisms are
not earth-shaking and that no
program will ever be perfect.
What will not be admitted,
however, is that change for the
better is impossible.
Extravagance and waste can be
lessened. Inflexibility can be
replaced by an active seeking for
innovation. A good program, with
the proper leadership, can once
again become a great program.
One topic of conversation
guaranteed to spark animated
conversation among a majority of
Stanford undergraduates is the
Overseas Campus program.
Almost 60 percent of Stanford
undergraduates have attended one
of the five foreign campuses. Most
of these students would agree
with the senior history major who
declared, "The time I spent
overseas was the most important
educational experience of my
undergraduate years."
The vast majority of students
who have returned from a foreign
campus have an almost unlimited
collection of short anecdotes and
rambling tales of hitchhiking and
native customs and foreign food.
Inevitably, however, if the
conversation continues for any
length of time the focus will turn
to the many problems and
shortcomings that mar what was
once considered an almost perfect
program.
Change Slow
Despite often expressed
criticisms, change in the program
has been slow and halting.
Jim Scheimer, Trancos
sponsor, declared:"Students who
have gone overseas whether
recently or long ago all seem to
have the same complaints; but
nothing has been done about
them. While you're there you are
too far away from the home
campus to affect change, and
when you come back, you get
involved in other things and
rapidly loose interest in pushing
through necessary reforms."
Part of the reason that students
fail to follow-up on complaints is
that each student's individual
criticisms often seem insignificant
when compared with the
tremendous benefits of the
program.
When drawn together,
however, the criticisms mount to
a cacophonous crescendo:
mismanagement and inflexibility
in the home office together with
complaints of inadequate food,
bad courses, and poor relations
between the foreign campuses and
the Stanford administrative
headquarters.
It is a good program fraught
with many critical problems.
Fiscal Success
Mark Edwards, graduate
student in history and a member
of the Study Education at
Stanford (SES) Overseas Campus
committee, explained that fiscal
arrangements account for much of

the program's popularity with the
Stanford administration.
"The program made money for
the university. Dr. Walker always
came in with a perfect budget.
The average student program costs
less overseas than here. In fact,
the program put money, into
general funds."
Russ Worley of the Controller's
Office confirmed that the
program puts money into general
funds. He cautioned, however,
that because of the complicated
accounting procedures used by
the Overseas Campuses Office, it
would be wrong to assume that a
profit is made.
"Tuition and room and board
charges to students are in excess
of the direct cost of the
program," he declared. Examples
given of indirect costs were
Controller's Fees, Business Office
fees for negotiating contracts and
library fees.
Opportunities Lost
"Dr. Walker, Vice-Provost
Howard Brooks, and Business
Manager Dwight Adams negotiate
the contracts in Europe with local
agencies," explained Edwards.
"The trustees refused to allow
land purchases over there and this
forced Stanford into rentals and
leases.
"Neither Brooks nor Walker is
familiar enough with local
conditions to drive hard bargains
and they miss out on a number of
opportunities to save money," he
continued.

One faculty member who has
been overseas and is now
influential in the program
explained, "Walker defines the
overseas operation as how to
maintain his position.
"Here is a guy whose big bag is
efficient business operation and
then he loses $48,000 on the
Harlaxton-Cliveden move. How
much are the official opening
ceremonies at Cliveden going to
cost,"he queried.
Food Hit
Frequently linked with
examples of Walker's personal
extravagence are complaints
about the poor quality of food
the students eat overseas.
David Mannheimer, senior in
philosophy, who visited the
French campus this summer
commented that, "Walker stays at
the Hotel Metropole in Tours and
eats in the best French restaurants
while the students eat what the
French students eat which is crap.
"Since Stanford students pay
Stanford board rates while
overseas they are paying about

a dollar or more for a meal that
costs a French student about 35
cents."
Investigation by students at the
Vienna campus revealed that the
Overseas Campuses Office had
negotiated a contract with Caritas
(the building owners) which
allowed the chef to allocate only
32 cents per student per day for
food.
Inflcx ibility
Administrative inflexibility and
unwillingness to try new ideas has
frequently been the focal point of
criticism.
James Viney, senior in
Psychology, who spent six months
at the Austrian campus called
Walker "pompous and unwilling
to listen to students."
"We tried to talk to him after
we returned home about
liberalizing residence rules. At
that time all Walker would do was
come out with pious platitudes
that students wouldn't be
responsible enough without a
rule."
Edwards added to the
inflexibility theme: "They are
limited to their searches for
facilities by their fixed conception
that a program must consist of 80
students and two faculty
members.
"A building that might be very
attractive in terms of cost and
location just might not be that
exact size."
Any list of complaints about
the overseas campuses is bound to
be incomplete since nearly every
returnee has his own special
grievance to air.
Moreover, those students and
faculty members who discuss
these problems will readily admit
that many of the criticisms are
not earth-shaking and that no
program will ever be perfect.
What will not be admitted,
however, is that change for the
better is impossible.
Extravagance and waste can be
lessened. Inflexibility can be
replaced by an active seeking for
innovation. A good program, with
the proper leadership, can once
again become a great program.
One topic of conversation
guaranteed to spark animated
conversation among a majority of
Stanford undergraduates is the
Overseas Campus program.
Almost 60 percent of Stanford
undergraduates have attended one
of the five foreign campuses. Most
of these students would agree
with the senior history major who
declared, "The time I spent
overseas was the most important
educational experience of my
undergraduate years."
The vast majority of students
who have returned from a foreign
campus have an almost unlimited
collection of short anecdotes and
rambling tales of hitchhiking and
native customs and foreign food.
Inevitably, however, if the
conversation continues for any
length of time the focus will turn
to the many problems and
shortcomings that mar what was
once considered an almost perfect
program.
Change Slow
Despite often expressed
criticisms, change in the program
has been slow and halting.
Jim Scheimer, Trancos
sponsor, declared:"Students who
have gone overseas whether
recently or long ago all seem to
have the same complaints; but
nothing has been done about
them. While you're there you are
too far away from the home
campus to affect change, and
when you come back, you get
involved in other things and
rapidly loose interest in pushing
through necessary reforms."
Part of the reason that students
fail to follow-up on complaints is
that each student's individual
criticisms often seem insignificant
when compared with the
tremendous benefits of the
program.
When drawn together,
however, the criticisms mount to
a cacophonous crescendo:
mismanagement and inflexibility
in the home office together with
complaints of inadequate food,
bad courses, and poor relations
between the foreign campuses and
the Stanford administrative
headquarters.
It is a good program fraught
with many critical problems.
Fiscal Success
Mark Edwards, graduate
student in history and a member
of the Study Education at
Stanford (SES) Overseas Campus
committee, explained that fiscal
arrangements account for much of

the program's popularity with the
Stanford administration.
"The program made money for
the university. Dr. Walker always
came in with a perfect budget.
The average student program costs
less overseas than here. In fact,
the program put money, into
general funds."
Russ Worley of the Controller's
Office confirmed that the
program puts money into general
funds. He cautioned, however,
that because of the complicated
accounting procedures used by
the Overseas Campuses Office, it
would be wrong to assume that a
profit is made.
"Tuition and room and board
charges to students are in excess
of the direct cost of the
program," he declared. Examples
given of indirect costs were
Controller's Fees, Business Office
fees for negotiating contracts and
library fees.
Opportunities Lost
"Dr. Walker, Vice-Provost
Howard Brooks, and Business
Manager Dwight Adams negotiate
the contracts in Europe with local
agencies," explained Edwards.
"The trustees refused to allow
land purchases over there and this
forced Stanford into rentals and
leases.
"Neither Brooks nor Walker is
familiar enough with local
conditions to drive hard bargains
and they miss out on a number of
opportunities to save money," he
continued.
Walker's Junkets
One instance of waste
frequently criticized by faculty
members is Walker's frequent trips
to Europe and his penchant for
flying first class. One of the
faculty members of the SES
Overseas Committee flatly stated,
"The travel budget is too large."
A former resident assistant at
one of the campuses added,
"There is no justification for all
those people from the home
office coming over so often. And
it's not clear what concrete things
they do when they come over.
"Whenever Mrs. Allen or Dr.
Walker come over, there's just one
party after another."
One of the recently returned
resident assistants commented
that the "whole question of the
relation between the overseas
campuses and the home office
needs to be investigated.
Time Wasted
"The secretaries seem to spend
a lot of time doing useless things
when so much that is substantive
needs to be done, for example

revising the handbooks—ltaly
hasn't been done in five
years —and improving the
orientation programs.
"We got a telegraph at the
foreign campus notifying us that
the telephone extension for the
home campus office had been
changed.
"The next week, a long
mimeographed memo arrived
telling about the change and
explaining that if we had
mistakenly tried to call the old
extension, it would have
automatically gone to the new
extension.
"How much did that waste in
telegram fees and secretarial
time?"
"Then there is the whole area
of 'administrative memoranda.'
This stuff is absolute garbage.
"This is material which Dr.
Paul Han ley (the Associate
Director) generates and we never
use it during the year. They are
about basic things which are so
basic that they are absolutely
useless.
One faculty member who has
been overseas and is now
influential in the program
explained, "Walker defines the
overseas operation as how to
maintain his position.
"Here is a guy whose big bag is
efficient business operation and
then he loses $48,000 on the
Harlaxton-Cliveden move. How
much are the official opening
