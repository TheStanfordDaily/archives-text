# Meeting Neighbors Problem In Britain
## 
### EMMA PRICE 
The problems of the students
and administrators of Stanford in
Britain are in many ways typical
of those at the other four
campuses. Students don't face the
language barrier but they do face
problems equally as formidable.
The chief problem the students
face is in meeting the English. It
shouldn't be. The English are an
extremely friendly people, at least
to strangers. But Stanford in
Britain makes it hard for its
students to meet the British.
Cliveden House seems to be a
large part of the problem. It is one
of the most famous aristocratic
houses in a nation known for its
estates. The site of the Profumo
scandal, it was for decades known
as a meeting of the Royal Family
and their cousins.
The reaction of the average
Englishman to the situation is
peculiar: he is frightened by the
house yet tremendously curious
about its magnificence and the
rich Americans who lease it. He
has been taught to be deferrential
toward the occupants of the
house.
Isolated Campus
To overcome these feelings the
townspeople must be introduced
to the students and shown that
they are "regular blokes." The
Englishmen's curiosity will take
over. Yet almost no steps have
been taken to bring the
Englishmen to the students, to

help the students who have in
many cases gone halfway.
The administration has not
helped by forbidding the local
employees of Stanford to eat with
the students or to drink in their
pub, an unusual situation since
pubs are supposed to be open to
all members of the public.
Students are bound to lose in
this situation, for it is too easy for
them to forget England and live in
Cliveden with its swimming pool,
tennis court, and huge lawns.
A positive suggestion has been
made by Mr. Robert Thome,
tutor at the campus, to overcome
the problems posed by Cliveden's
splendid isolation.
He suggests a series of
week-end workshops held at the
campus to which local residents
would be welcomed.
ISach week-end could be
organized around a particular area
of interest related either to past or
present England.
Press Problems
Even if these weekends were to
be successful, relations might not
improve much. Stanford in Britain
has serious problems with press.
The reason is simple: the English
popular press is extremely
competitive and extremely
sensationalist.
While the campus has largely
received fair treatment, most of
the reporters made a point of
trying to get pictures of the
students playing baseball or

chewing gum, allegedly typically
American activities.
Staff Problem*
Stanford in Britain is plagued
by a problem well known at the
home campus: poor staff relations
compounded by an expensive
employment situation.
Stanford pays poor wages to its
staff employees while trying to
compensate bv providing housing.

ThÂ«' policy didn't work in at
least one case: Stanford would
only provide housing for a
married man, not his family. He is
forced to commute 120 miles
every weekend to see his wife.
Stanford neglected to try to
provide housing for his family.
