# British Drug Case
## Walker Defies Judicial Regs 
### JAY SPEAS 
At a time when student rights
in judicial procedures are being
widely recognized on the Stanford
campus, the arbitrary action of
discipline by administrative fiat at
overseas campuses seems
increasingly anacronistic.
Only Robert Walker, Director
of Overseas Campuses, can
determine whether or not
students accused or various rule
infractions shall have access to
due process.
This situation became apparent
during a Daily investigation of a
recent case involving a Stanford
coed overseas, arrented in France
for possession of drugs during
three week break.
Dr. Walker decided that she
could not return to Stanford in
Britain, and made this decision
while the student was being held
in jail awaiting trial.

The case raises significant
questions:
Should one man, Robert
Walker, ever be allowed to serve as
judge, jury, and court of last
appeal over a student in an
important disciplinary case?
Should the Director of Overseas
Campuses be allowed to ignore at
will standing disciplinary
procedures?
Does a student overseas have a
right to be notified that the
Director is considering his removal
from the program?
The answer to these questions
are important to any student who
is either enrolled in an Overseas
Campus or considering
enrollment. The answers are also
important to anyone who believes
that due process must be followed
in a student disciplinary case.
"Jane"
The case in question arose
when a Stanford coed, whom
we'll call "Jane," was arrested by
French police for possession of
one pound of hashish. She had
left the hasish at a campground,
wrapped as a package. She was
arrested when she went to the
police to pick up the package
which the campground owner had
turned in.
Mr. J. S. Rumbold, academic
director of Britain, first learned of
Jane's arrest when the girl who
had been traveling with Jane was
released after three days in jail.
Lang Atwood, a student in the
group and a Daily reporter,
interviewed Rumbold in
December on Jane's case and
made notes at that time.
According to Atwood,
Rumbold immediately contacted
the home campus when he learned
that Jane was being held and
began to investigate the matter.
He also contacted the American
Embassy in London, and they
informed him that the girl would
probably not be allowed by
immigration officials to return to
England.
Rumbold believed, that the
trial would be "long delayed."
Atwood reports, "It seemed
pretty clear that Rumbold had
done all he could for the girl."
Probably Unable
According to Rumbold, he and
Dr. Walker discussed Jane's case at
about the time the fall quarter
opened and after he had found
out Jane probably would be
unable to return to England for
most of the quarter. It was
decided Jane could not return to
Stanford in Britain.
Jane had not, however,
technically been "suspended." A
suspension would have implied
the right to appeal the decision to
the Dean of Students but would
not have allowed Jane to receive a
refund on her room and board
payment.
Sometime after the decision
was made. Dr. Walker contacted
John Hanson, associate dean of
students in charge of counseling.
Hanson stated that Dr. Walker
explained to him why the decision
had been made, and Hanson
offered no objections.
Walker explained the reasons
for the decision in a letter dated
November 21, 1969, solicited by
Rumbold. Rumbold showed
students the letter to answer their
questions about the case, and gave
a copy of the letter to Amanda

Rutherford, a student in the
group and a friend of Jane's.
According to Rumbold's
statement to Atwood, this was the
first time he learned that Jane
technically had not been
suspended.
According to the explanation
Walker offered in his letter, there
were two elements to the
decision. The first was that Jane
would have had to appear on
campus by October 21 in order to
be considered a student. Walker
believed that Jane would be
unable to return to the campus
before Oct. 21.
Immediate Return
Amanda Rutherford, however,
reported that she had been in
contact with Jane and that Jane
was released from jail on the first
day of classes and could have
returned immediately to the
Cliveden.
According to Miss Rutherford,
"she (Jane) was released into the
custody of Swiss friends, during
the first two or three days of the
quarter, and could have returned
to Stanford in England if she had
been told that the reason for her
not being allowed to return was
her own inability to do so. She
was able to travel in Europe, for
the court had not forbidden it.
"But when (Jane) called Mr.
Rumbold on her arrival in
Switzerland, he told her that the
reason she could not return was
because her presence on the
campus might draw repercussions
from the community
"In fact, Jane did not learn that
any proceedings had been
intiiated until after the decision
had already been made."
The second reason stated by
Walker for her not being allowed
to return was that according to
Walker, Jane's presence at the
campus might have drawn serious
repercussions from the local
community.
Two passages from his letter
which seem most clearly to
express his view on the danger
from the community read:
What we are dealing with is an
overall University policy which holds
that the University will not, either at
home or overseas, provide a refuge
from the local laws for those who
choose to indulge in the use or
possession of drugs. . .permitting her to
return to the campus in England prior
to the trial could have been interpreted
by various civil authorities as providing
exactly the refuge which the University
refuses to do.
Many of us may not like the fact
that the public reaction to a case of
this sort, in the communities which
surround the University in England or
the other countries of Europe, is likely
to be more hostile and less indulgent
than it would be in the United States.
The fact remains, however, that the
sentiments exist, and that both the
laws and the enforcement practices of
the countries involved reflect this fact.
More than that, these public
sentiments have to be taken very
seriously by the University if indeed it
is to remain in good standing in
England
The most significant aspect of
the case as it concerns Walker, is
the difference between the stated
judicial procedures and the way
he actually handled the case.
Four statements in the memo
on overseas disciplinary
procedures are relevant to the
case. A copy of this memo is given
all students going overseas.
The first would seem to define
Jane's case as a "problem of
discipline:
Underlying the overall problem of
discipline at Overseas Centers is the
special setting in which the University

operates abroad. Breaches of good
taste or of conduct which would create
relatively little problem at home may
well affect the morale of the whole
group and thus the success of the
session if nothing is done about them.
Likewise ttiere may be considerations
involved, such as relations with the
host community or management of the
Center, of which the students are not
always aware."
The last three statements de
fine procedure in "disciplinary
matters."
Students will normally assume initial
responsibility for dealing with
disciplinary matters."
The two directors at the campus and
the resident faculty members from the
home campus will constitute a board
or review of disciplinary matters, if the
violation involved is a relatively serious
one, or if there is an appear." and,
The final responsibility for seeing
that appropriate action is taken is with
the Director (of the local campus)
designated in charge of student affairs."
Variation Explained
When asked why this procedure
was not followed in Jane's case,
Robert Hamrdla, Assistant
Director for Overseas Campuses,
replied, "she hadn't broken any
rule, and therefore it wasn't a
judicial matter; it was an
administrative one."
Walker, in his letter dated
November 21, 1969, offers a
different explanation for the
deviance from established
procedures in Jane's case:
On the broader question which you
raise-that is, the fact that we reserve
the right to suspend any student
without going through judicial
procedures - it is true, but it is true
only with respect to very serious
situations, which may affect our ability
to retain a campus or program in a
particular country.
On the subject of why the
Student Judicial Council was
bypassed, Dr. Walker offers three
different reasons:
If we expect to remain in England,
and at Cliveden, we must take every
possible precaution against a suspicion
arising among British authorities that
we are less than vigilant in this area.
This means, as I see it, that a judicial
council's recommendation to permit
(Jane) to return and remain at Cliveden
simply could not be accepted by the
University. This being the case, it
would be useless, and indeed unfair to
all parties, to submit such a question to
the judicial couneil on the pretense
that such a recommendation might be
accepted.
The very active public and police
concern in England over this issue,
including the possibility that (Jane)
would not in any case be permitted by
the immigration authorities to reenter
England while her case was pending,
put this decision rather clearly outside
normal judicial council concerns.. .
"In the case of (Jane), where the
evidence was already in the possession
of the police, and both her release
from jail and the date of her trial were
uncertain, it is not clear what kind of a
charge one would bring to a student
judicial council.
Jane's case is not an isolated
one. Within the last five months,
two other students have found
themselves in a similar situation.
A coed on the Stanford
Overseas Campuses charter plane
freaked out in the aisle. The pilot
ordered her deplaned in Paris. She
was turned over to the French
authorities and the Overseas
Campuses Office decided that she
could not continue in the
program
The second case involves a
student from the present Austria
group who is currently being held
in Britain on drug charges. Bail
has twice been denied him.
Hamrdla, assistant director for
the program, stated yesterday that
he did not know whether a
decision has been made on
whether the student can continue
in the program after his release.
At a time when student rights
in judicial procedures are being
widely recognized on the Stanford
campus, the arbitrary action of
discipline by administrative fiat at
overseas campuses seems

important disciplinary case?
Should the Director of Overseas
Campuses be allowed to ignore at
will standing disciplinary
procedures?
Does a student overseas have a
right to be notified that the
Director is considering his removal
from the program?
The answer to these questions
are important to any student who
is either enrolled in an Overseas
Campus or considering
enrollment. The answers are also
important to anyone who believes
that due process must be followed
in a student disciplinary case.
"Jane"
The case in question arose
when a Stanford coed, whom
we'll call "Jane," was arrested by
French police for possession of
one pound of hashish. She had
left the hasish at a campground,
wrapped as a package. She was
arrested when she went to the
police to pick up the package
which the campground owner had
turned in.
Mr. J. S. Rumbold, academic
director of Britain, first learned of
Jane's arrest when the girl who
had been traveling with Jane was
released after three days in jail.
Lang Atwood, a student in the
group and a Daily reporter,
interviewed Rumbold in
December on Jane's case and
made notes at that time.
According to Atwood,
Rumbold immediately contacted
the home campus when he learned
that Jane was being held and
began to investigate the matter.
He also contacted the American
Embassy in London, and they
informed him that the girl would
probably not be allowed by
immigration officials to return to
England.
Rumbold believed, that the
trial would be "long delayed."
Atwood reports, "It seemed
pretty clear that Rumbold had
done all he could for the girl."
Probably Unable
According to Rumbold, he and
Dr. Walker discussed Jane's case at
about the time the fall quarter
opened and after he had found
out Jane probably would be
unable to return to England for
most of the quarter. It was
decided Jane could not return to
Stanford in Britain.
Jane had not, however,
technically been "suspended." A
suspension would have implied
the right to appeal the decision to
the Dean of Students but would
not have allowed Jane to receive a
refund on her room and board
payment.
Sometime after the decision
was made. Dr. Walker contacted
John Hanson, associate dean of
students in charge of counseling.
Hanson stated that Dr. Walker
explained to him why the decision
had been made, and Hanson
offered no objections.
Walker explained the reasons
for the decision in a letter dated
November 21, 1969, solicited by
Rumbold. Rumbold showed
students the letter to answer their
questions about the case, and gave
a copy of the letter to Amanda

Rutherford, a student in the
group and a friend of Jane's.
According to Rumbold's
statement to Atwood, this was the
first time he learned that Jane
technically had not been
suspended.
According to the explanation
Walker offered in his letter, there
were two elements to the
decision. The first was that Jane
would have had to appear on
campus by October 21 in order to
be considered a student. Walker
believed that Jane would be
unable to return to the campus
before Oct. 21.
Immediate Return
Amanda Rutherford, however,
reported that she had been in
contact with Jane and that Jane
was released from jail on the first
day of classes and could have
returned immediately to the
Cliveden.
According to Miss Rutherford,
"she (Jane) was released into the
custody of Swiss friends, during
the first two or three days of the
quarter, and could have returned
to Stanford in England if she had
been told that the reason for her
not being allowed to return was
her own inability to do so. She
was able to travel in Europe, for
the court had not forbidden it.
"But when (Jane) called Mr.
Rumbold on her arrival in
Switzerland, he told her that the
reason she could not return was
because her presence on the
campus might draw repercussions
from the community
"In fact, Jane did not learn that
any proceedings had been
intiiated until after the decision
had already been made."
The second reason stated by
Walker for her not being allowed
to return was that according to
Walker, Jane's presence at the
campus might have drawn serious
repercussions from the local
community.
Two passages from his letter
which seem most clearly to
express his view on the danger
from the community read:
What we are dealing with is an
overall University policy which holds
that the University will not, either at
home or overseas, provide a refuge
from the local laws for those who
choose to indulge in the use or
possession of drugs. . .permitting her to
return to the campus in England prior
to the trial could have been interpreted
by various civil authorities as providing
exactly the refuge which the University
refuses to do.
Many of us may not like the fact
that the public reaction to a case of
this sort, in the communities which
surround the University in England or
the other countries of Europe, is likely
to be more hostile and less indulgent
than it would be in the United States.
The fact remains, however, that the
sentiments exist, and that both the
laws and the enforcement practices of
the countries involved reflect this fact.
More than that, these public
sentiments have to be taken very
seriously by the University if indeed it
is to remain in good standing in
England
The most significant aspect of
the case as it concerns Walker, is
the difference between the stated
judicial procedures and the way
he actually handled the case.
Four statements in the memo
on overseas disciplinary
procedures are relevant to the
case. A copy of this memo is given
all students going overseas.
The first would seem to define
Jane's case as a "problem of
discipline:
Underlying the overall problem of
discipline at Overseas Centers is the
special setting in which the University

operates abroad. Breaches of good
taste or of conduct which would create
relatively little problem at home may
well affect the morale of the whole
group and thus the success of the
session if nothing is done about them.
Likewise ttiere may be considerations
involved, such as relations with the
host community or management of the
Center, of which the students are not
always aware."
The last three statements de
fine procedure in "disciplinary
matters."
Students will normally assume initial
responsibility for dealing with
disciplinary matters."
The two directors at the campus and
the resident faculty members from the
home campus will constitute a board
or review of disciplinary matters, if the
violation involved is a relatively serious
one, or if there is an appear." and,
The final responsibility for seeing
that appropriate action is taken is with
the Director (of the local campus)
designated in charge of student affairs."
Variation Explained
When asked why this procedure
was not followed in Jane's case,
Robert Hamrdla, Assistant
Director for Overseas Campuses,
replied, "she hadn't broken any
rule, and therefore it wasn't a
judicial matter; it was an
administrative one."
Walker, in his letter dated
November 21, 1969, offers a
different explanation for the
deviance from established
procedures in Jane's case:
On the broader question which you
raise-that is, the fact that we reserve
the right to suspend any student
without going through judicial
procedures - it is true, but it is true
only with respect to very serious
situations, which may affect our ability
to retain a campus or program in a
particular country.
On the subject of why the
Student Judicial Council was
bypassed, Dr. Walker offers three
different reasons:
If we expect to remain in England,
and at Cliveden, we must take every
possible precaution against a suspicion
arising among British authorities that
we are less than vigilant in this area.
This means, as I see it, that a judicial
council's recommendation to permit
(Jane) to return and remain at Cliveden
simply could not be accepted by the
University. This being the case, it
would be useless, and indeed unfair to
all parties, to submit such a question to
the judicial couneil on the pretense
that such a recommendation might be
accepted.
The very active public and police
concern in England over this issue,
including the possibility that (Jane)
would not in any case be permitted by
the immigration authorities to reenter
England while her case was pending,
put this decision rather clearly outside
normal judicial council concerns.. .
"In the case of (Jane), where the
evidence was already in the possession
of the police, and both her release
from jail and the date of her trial were
uncertain, it is not clear what kind of a
charge one would bring to a student
judicial council.
Jane's case is not an isolated
one. Within the last five months,
two other students have found
themselves in a similar situation.
A coed on the Stanford
Overseas Campuses charter plane
freaked out in the aisle. The pilot
ordered her deplaned in Paris. She
was turned over to the French
authorities and the Overseas
Campuses Office decided that she
could not continue in the
program
The second case involves a
student from the present Austria
group who is currently being held
in Britain on drug charges. Bail
has twice been denied him.
Hamrdla, assistant director for
the program, stated yesterday that
he did not know whether a
decision has been made on
whether the student can continue
in the program after his release.
At a time when student rights
in judicial procedures are being
widely recognized on the Stanford
campus, the arbitrary action of
discipline by administrative fiat at
overseas campuses seems
increasingly anacronistic.
Only Robert Walker, Director
of Overseas Campuses, can
determine whether or not
students accused or various rule
infractions shall have access to
due process.
This situation became apparent
during a Daily investigation of a
recent case involving a Stanford
coed overseas, arrented in France
for possession of drugs during
three week break.
Dr. Walker decided that she
could not return to Stanford in
Britain, and made this decision
while the student was being held
in jail awaiting trial.

The case raises significant
questions:
Should one man, Robert
Walker, ever be allowed to serve as
judge, jury, and court of last
appeal over a student in an
important disciplinary case?
Should the Director of Overseas
Campuses be allowed to ignore at
will standing disciplinary
procedures?
Does a student overseas have a
right to be notified that the
Director is considering his removal
from the program?

Mr. J. S. Rumbold, academic
director of Britain, first learned of
Jane's arrest when the girl who
had been traveling with Jane was
released after three days in jail.
Lang Atwood, a student in the
group and a Daily reporter,
interviewed Rumbold in
December on Jane's case and
made notes at that time.
According to Atwood,
Rumbold immediately contacted
the home campus when he learned
that Jane was being held and
began to investigate the matter.
He also contacted the American
Embassy in London, and they
informed him that the girl would
probably not be allowed by
immigration officials to return to
England.
Rumbold believed, that the
trial would be "long delayed."
Atwood reports, "It seemed
pretty clear that Rumbold had
done all he could for the girl."
Probably Unable
According to Rumbold, he and
Dr. Walker discussed Jane's case at
about the time the fall quarter
opened and after he had found
out Jane probably would be
unable to return to England for
most of the quarter. It was
decided Jane could not return to
Stanford in Britain.
Jane had not, however,
technically been "suspended." A
suspension would have implied
the right to appeal the decision to
the Dean of Students but would
not have allowed Jane to receive a
refund on her room and board
payment.
Sometime after the decision
was made. Dr. Walker contacted
John Hanson, associate dean of
students in charge of counseling.
Hanson stated that Dr. Walker
explained to him why the decision
had been made, and Hanson
offered no objections.
Walker explained the reasons
for the decision in a letter dated
November 21, 1969, solicited by
Rumbold. Rumbold showed
students the letter to answer their
questions about the case, and gave
a copy of the letter to Amanda

Rutherford, a student in the
group and a friend of Jane's.
According to Rumbold's
statement to Atwood, this was the
first time he learned that Jane
technically had not been
suspended.
According to the explanation
Walker offered in his letter, there
were two elements to the
decision. The first was that Jane
would have had to appear on
campus by October 21 in order to
be considered a student. Walker
believed that Jane would be
unable to return to the campus
before Oct. 21.
Immediate Return
Amanda Rutherford, however,
reported that she had been in
contact with Jane and that Jane
was released from jail on the first
day of classes and could have
returned immediately to the
Cliveden.
According to Miss Rutherford,
"she (Jane) was released into the
custody of Swiss friends, during
the first two or three days of the
quarter, and could have returned
to Stanford in England if she had
been told that the reason for her
not being allowed to return was
her own inability to do so. She
was able to travel in Europe, for
the court had not forbidden it.
"But when (Jane) called Mr.
Rumbold on her arrival in
Switzerland, he told her that the
reason she could not return was
because her presence on the
campus might draw repercussions
from the community
"In fact, Jane did not learn that
any proceedings had been
intiiated until after the decision
had already been made."
The second reason stated by
Walker for her not being allowed
to return was that according to
Walker, Jane's presence at the
campus might have drawn serious
repercussions from the local
community.
Two passages from his letter
which seem most clearly to
express his view on the danger
from the community read:
What we are dealing with is an
overall University policy which holds
that the University will not, either at
home or overseas, provide a refuge
from the local laws for those who
choose to indulge in the use or
possession of drugs. . .permitting her to
return to the campus in England prior
to the trial could have been interpreted
by various civil authorities as providing
exactly the refuge which the University
refuses to do.
Many of us may not like the fact
that the public reaction to a case of
this sort, in the communities which
surround the University in England or
the other countries of Europe, is likely
to be more hostile and less indulgent
than it would be in the United States.
The fact remains, however, that the
sentiments exist, and that both the
laws and the enforcement practices of
the countries involved reflect this fact.
More than that, these public
sentiments have to be taken very
seriously by the University if indeed it
is to remain in good standing in
England
The most significant aspect of
the case as it concerns Walker, is
the difference between the stated
judicial procedures and the way
he actually handled the case.
Four statements in the memo
on overseas disciplinary
procedures are relevant to the
case. A copy of this memo is given
all students going overseas.
The first would seem to define
Jane's case as a "problem of
discipline:
Underlying the overall problem of
discipline at Overseas Centers is the
special setting in which the University

operates abroad. Breaches of good
taste or of conduct which would create
relatively little problem at home may
well affect the morale of the whole
group and thus the success of the
session if nothing is done about them.
Likewise ttiere may be considerations
involved, such as relations with the
host community or management of the
Center, of which the students are not
always aware."
The last three statements de
fine procedure in "disciplinary
matters."
Students will normally assume initial
responsibility for dealing with
disciplinary matters."
The two directors at the campus and
the resident faculty members from the
home campus will constitute a board
or review of disciplinary matters, if the
violation involved is a relatively serious
one, or if there is an appear." and,
The final responsibility for seeing
that appropriate action is taken is with
the Director (of the local campus)
designated in charge of student affairs."
Variation Explained
When asked why this procedure
was not followed in Jane's case,
Robert Hamrdla, Assistant
Director for Overseas Campuses,
replied, "she hadn't broken any
rule, and therefore it wasn't a
judicial matter; it was an
administrative one."
Walker, in his letter dated
November 21, 1969, offers a
different explanation for the
deviance from established
procedures in Jane's case:
On the broader question which you
raise-that is, the fact that we reserve
the right to suspend any student
without going through judicial
procedures - it is true, but it is true
only with respect to very serious
situations, which may affect our ability
to retain a campus or program in a
particular country.
On the subject of why the
Student Judicial Council was
bypassed, Dr. Walker offers three
different reasons:
If we expect to remain in England,
and at Cliveden, we must take every
possible precaution against a suspicion
arising among British authorities that
we are less than vigilant in this area.
This means, as I see it, that a judicial
council's recommendation to permit
(Jane) to return and remain at Cliveden
simply could not be accepted by the
University. This being the case, it
would be useless, and indeed unfair to
all parties, to submit such a question to
the judicial couneil on the pretense
that such a recommendation might be
accepted.
The very active public and police
concern in England over this issue,
including the possibility that (Jane)
would not in any case be permitted by
the immigration authorities to reenter
England while her case was pending,
put this decision rather clearly outside
normal judicial council concerns.. .
"In the case of (Jane), where the
evidence was already in the possession
of the police, and both her release
from jail and the date of her trial were
uncertain, it is not clear what kind of a
charge one would bring to a student
judicial council.
Jane's case is not an isolated
one. Within the last five months,
two other students have found
themselves in a similar situation.
A coed on the Stanford
Overseas Campuses charter plane
freaked out in the aisle. The pilot
ordered her deplaned in Paris. She
was turned over to the French
authorities and the Overseas
Campuses Office decided that she
could not continue in the
program
The second case involves a
student from the present Austria
group who is currently being held
in Britain on drug charges. Bail
has twice been denied him.
Hamrdla, assistant director for
the program, stated yesterday that
he did not know whether a
decision has been made on
whether the student can continue
in the program after his release.
At a time when student rights
in judicial procedures are being
widely recognized on the Stanford
campus, the arbitrary action of
discipline by administrative fiat at
overseas campuses seems
increasingly anacronistic.
Only Robert Walker, Director
of Overseas Campuses, can
determine whether or not
students accused or various rule
infractions shall have access to
due process.
This situation became apparent
during a Daily investigation of a
recent case involving a Stanford
coed overseas, arrented in France
for possession of drugs during
three week break.
Dr. Walker decided that she
could not return to Stanford in
Britain, and made this decision
while the student was being held
in jail awaiting trial.

The case raises significant
questions:
Should one man, Robert
Walker, ever be allowed to serve as
judge, jury, and court of last
appeal over a student in an
important disciplinary case?
Should the Director of Overseas
Campuses be allowed to ignore at
will standing disciplinary
procedures?
Does a student overseas have a
right to be notified that the
Director is considering his removal
from the program?
The answer to these questions
are important to any student who
is either enrolled in an Overseas
Campus or considering
enrollment. The answers are also
important to anyone who believes
that due process must be followed
in a student disciplinary case.
"Jane"
The case in question arose
when a Stanford coed, whom
we'll call "Jane," was arrested by
French police for possession of
one pound of hashish. She had
left the hasish at a campground,
wrapped as a package. She was
arrested when she went to the
police to pick up the package
which the campground owner had
turned in.
Mr. J. S. Rumbold, academic
director of Britain, first learned of
Jane's arrest when the girl who

Dr. Walker discussed Jane's case at
about the time the fall quarter
opened and after he had found
out Jane probably would be
unable to return to England for
most of the quarter. It was
decided Jane could not return to
Stanford in Britain.
Jane had not, however,
technically been "suspended." A
suspension would have implied
the right to appeal the decision to
the Dean of Students but would
not have allowed Jane to receive a
refund on her room and board
payment.
Sometime after the decision
was made. Dr. Walker contacted
John Hanson, associate dean of
students in charge of counseling.
Hanson stated that Dr. Walker
explained to him why the decision
had been made, and Hanson
offered no objections.
Walker explained the reasons
for the decision in a letter dated
November 21, 1969, solicited by
Rumbold. Rumbold showed
students the letter to answer their
questions about the case, and gave
a copy of the letter to Amanda

Rutherford, a student in the
group and a friend of Jane's.
According to Rumbold's
statement to Atwood, this was the
first time he learned that Jane
technically had not been
suspended.
According to the explanation
Walker offered in his letter, there
were two elements to the
decision. The first was that Jane
would have had to appear on
campus by October 21 in order to
be considered a student. Walker
believed that Jane would be
unable to return to the campus
before Oct. 21.
Immediate Return
Amanda Rutherford, however,
reported that she had been in
contact with Jane and that Jane
was released from jail on the first
day of classes and could have
returned immediately to the
Cliveden.
According to Miss Rutherford,
"she (Jane) was released into the
custody of Swiss friends, during
the first two or three days of the
quarter, and could have returned
to Stanford in England if she had
been told that the reason for her
not being allowed to return was
her own inability to do so. She
was able to travel in Europe, for
the court had not forbidden it.
"But when (Jane) called Mr.
Rumbold on her arrival in
Switzerland, he told her that the
reason she could not return was
because her presence on the
campus might draw repercussions
from the community
"In fact, Jane did not learn that
any proceedings had been
intiiated until after the decision
had already been made."
The second reason stated by
Walker for her not being allowed
to return was that according to
Walker, Jane's presence at the
campus might have drawn serious
repercussions from the local
community.
Two passages from his letter
which seem most clearly to
express his view on the danger
from the community read:
What we are dealing with is an
overall University policy which holds
that the University will not, either at
home or overseas, provide a refuge
from the local laws for those who
choose to indulge in the use or
possession of drugs. . .permitting her to
return to the campus in England prior
to the trial could have been interpreted
by various civil authorities as providing
exactly the refuge which the University
refuses to do.
Many of us may not like the fact
that the public reaction to a case of
this sort, in the communities which
surround the University in England or
the other countries of Europe, is likely
to be more hostile and less indulgent
than it would be in the United States.
The fact remains, however, that the
sentiments exist, and that both the
laws and the enforcement practices of
the countries involved reflect this fact.
More than that, these public
sentiments have to be taken very
seriously by the University if indeed it
is to remain in good standing in
England
The most significant aspect of
the case as it concerns Walker, is
the difference between the stated
judicial procedures and the way
he actually handled the case.
Four statements in the memo
on overseas disciplinary
procedures are relevant to the
case. A copy of this memo is given
all students going overseas.
The first would seem to define
Jane's case as a "problem of
discipline:
Underlying the overall problem of
discipline at Overseas Centers is the
special setting in which the University

operates abroad. Breaches of good
taste or of conduct which would create
relatively little problem at home may
well affect the morale of the whole
group and thus the success of the
session if nothing is done about them.
Likewise ttiere may be considerations
involved, such as relations with the
host community or management of the
Center, of which the students are not
always aware."
The last three statements de
fine procedure in "disciplinary
matters."
Students will normally assume initial
responsibility for dealing with
disciplinary matters."
The two directors at the campus and
the resident faculty members from the
home campus will constitute a board
or review of disciplinary matters, if the
violation involved is a relatively serious
one, or if there is an appear." and,
The final responsibility for seeing
that appropriate action is taken is with
the Director (of the local campus)
designated in charge of student affairs."
Variation Explained
When asked why this procedure
was not followed in Jane's case,
Robert Hamrdla, Assistant
Director for Overseas Campuses,
replied, "she hadn't broken any
rule, and therefore it wasn't a
judicial matter; it was an
administrative one."
Walker, in his letter dated
November 21, 1969, offers a
different explanation for the
deviance from established
procedures in Jane's case:
On the broader question which you
raise-that is, the fact that we reserve
the right to suspend any student
without going through judicial
procedures - it is true, but it is true
only with respect to very serious
situations, which may affect our ability
to retain a campus or program in a
particular country.
On the subject of why the
Student Judicial Council was
bypassed, Dr. Walker offers three
different reasons:
If we expect to remain in England,
and at Cliveden, we must take every
possible precaution against a suspicion
arising among British authorities that
we are less than vigilant in this area.
This means, as I see it, that a judicial
council's recommendation to permit
(Jane) to return and remain at Cliveden
simply could not be accepted by the
University. This being the case, it
would be useless, and indeed unfair to
all parties, to submit such a question to
the judicial couneil on the pretense
that such a recommendation might be
accepted.
The very active public and police
concern in England over this issue,
including the possibility that (Jane)
would not in any case be permitted by
the immigration authorities to reenter
England while her case was pending,
put this decision rather clearly outside
normal judicial council concerns.. .
"In the case of (Jane), where the
evidence was already in the possession
of the police, and both her release
from jail and the date of her trial were
uncertain, it is not clear what kind of a
charge one would bring to a student
judicial council.
Jane's case is not an isolated
one. Within the last five months,
two other students have found
themselves in a similar situation.
A coed on the Stanford
Overseas Campuses charter plane
freaked out in the aisle. The pilot
ordered her deplaned in Paris. She
was turned over to the French
authorities and the Overseas
Campuses Office decided that she
could not continue in the
program
The second case involves a
student from the present Austria
group who is currently being held
in Britain on drug charges. Bail
has twice been denied him.
Hamrdla, assistant director for
the program, stated yesterday that
he did not know whether a
decision has been made on
whether the student can continue
in the program after his release.
At a time when student rights
in judicial procedures are being
widely recognized on the Stanford
campus, the arbitrary action of
discipline by administrative fiat at
overseas campuses seems
increasingly anacronistic.
Only Robert Walker, Director
of Overseas Campuses, can
determine whether or not
students accused or various rule
infractions shall have access to
due process.
This situation became apparent
during a Daily investigation of a
recent case involving a Stanford
coed overseas, arrented in France
for possession of drugs during
three week break.
Dr. Walker decided that she
could not return to Stanford in
Britain, and made this decision
while the student was being held
in jail awaiting trial.

The case raises significant
questions:
Should one man, Robert
Walker, ever be allowed to serve as
judge, jury, and court of last
appeal over a student in an
important disciplinary case?
Should the Director of Overseas
Campuses be allowed to ignore at
will standing disciplinary
procedures?
Does a student overseas have a
right to be notified that the
Director is considering his removal
from the program?
The answer to these questions
are important to any student who
is either enrolled in an Overseas
Campus or considering
enrollment. The answers are also
important to anyone who believes
that due process must be followed
in a student disciplinary case.
"Jane"
The case in question arose
when a Stanford coed, whom
we'll call "Jane," was arrested by
French police for possession of
one pound of hashish. She had
left the hasish at a campground,
wrapped as a package. She was
arrested when she went to the
police to pick up the package
which the campground owner had
turned in.
Mr. J. S. Rumbold, academic
director of Britain, first learned of
Jane's arrest when the girl who
had been traveling with Jane was
released after three days in jail.
Lang Atwood, a student in the
group and a Daily reporter,
interviewed Rumbold in
December on Jane's case and
made notes at that time.
According to Atwood,
Rumbold immediately contacted
the home campus when he learned
that Jane was being held and
began to investigate the matter.
He also contacted the American
Embassy in London, and they
informed him that the girl would
probably not be allowed by
immigration officials to return to
England.
Rumbold believed, that the
trial would be "long delayed."
Atwood reports, "It seemed
pretty clear that Rumbold had
done all he could for the girl."

Dr. Walker discussed Jane's case at
about the time the fall quarter

students the letter to answer their
questions about the case, and gave
a copy of the letter to Amanda

Rutherford, a student in the
group and a friend of Jane's.
According to Rumbold's
statement to Atwood, this was the
first time he learned that Jane
technically had not been
suspended.
According to the explanation
Walker offered in his letter, there
were two elements to the
decision. The first was that Jane
would have had to appear on
campus by October 21 in order to
be considered a student. Walker
believed that Jane would be
unable to return to the campus
before Oct. 21.
Immediate Return
Amanda Rutherford, however,
reported that she had been in
contact with Jane and that Jane
was released from jail on the first
day of classes and could have
returned immediately to the
Cliveden.
According to Miss Rutherford,
"she (Jane) was released into the
custody of Swiss friends, during
the first two or three days of the
quarter, and could have returned
to Stanford in England if she had
been told that the reason for her
not being allowed to return was
her own inability to do so. She
was able to travel in Europe, for
the court had not forbidden it.
"But when (Jane) called Mr.
Rumbold on her arrival in
Switzerland, he told her that the
reason she could not return was
because her presence on the
campus might draw repercussions
from the community
"In fact, Jane did not learn that
any proceedings had been
intiiated until after the decision
had already been made."
The second reason stated by
Walker for her not being allowed
to return was that according to
Walker, Jane's presence at the
campus might have drawn serious
repercussions from the local
community.
Two passages from his letter
which seem most clearly to
express his view on the danger
from the community read:
What we are dealing with is an
overall University policy which holds
that the University will not, either at
home or overseas, provide a refuge
from the local laws for those who
choose to indulge in the use or
possession of drugs. . .permitting her to
return to the campus in England prior
to the trial could have been interpreted
by various civil authorities as providing
exactly the refuge which the University
refuses to do.
Many of us may not like the fact
that the public reaction to a case of
this sort, in the communities which
surround the University in England or
the other countries of Europe, is likely
to be more hostile and less indulgent
than it would be in the United States.
The fact remains, however, that the
sentiments exist, and that both the
laws and the enforcement practices of
the countries involved reflect this fact.
More than that, these public
sentiments have to be taken very
seriously by the University if indeed it
is to remain in good standing in
England
The most significant aspect of
the case as it concerns Walker, is
the difference between the stated
judicial procedures and the way
he actually handled the case.
Four statements in the memo
on overseas disciplinary
procedures are relevant to the
case. A copy of this memo is given
all students going overseas.
The first would seem to define
Jane's case as a "problem of
discipline:
Underlying the overall problem of
discipline at Overseas Centers is the
special setting in which the University

operates abroad. Breaches of good
taste or of conduct which would create
relatively little problem at home may
well affect the morale of the whole
group and thus the success of the
session if nothing is done about them.
Likewise ttiere may be considerations
involved, such as relations with the
host community or management of the
Center, of which the students are not
always aware."
The last three statements de
fine procedure in "disciplinary
matters."
Students will normally assume initial
responsibility for dealing with
disciplinary matters."
The two directors at the campus and
the resident faculty members from the
home campus will constitute a board
or review of disciplinary matters, if the
violation involved is a relatively serious
one, or if there is an appear." and,
The final responsibility for seeing
that appropriate action is taken is with
the Director (of the local campus)
designated in charge of student affairs."
Variation Explained
When asked why this procedure
was not followed in Jane's case,
Robert Hamrdla, Assistant
Director for Overseas Campuses,
replied, "she hadn't broken any
rule, and therefore it wasn't a
judicial matter; it was an
administrative one."
Walker, in his letter dated
November 21, 1969, offers a
different explanation for the
deviance from established
procedures in Jane's case:
On the broader question which you
raise-that is, the fact that we reserve
the right to suspend any student
without going through judicial
procedures - it is true, but it is true
only with respect to very serious
situations, which may affect our ability
to retain a campus or program in a
particular country.
On the subject of why the
Student Judicial Council was
bypassed, Dr. Walker offers three
different reasons:
If we expect to remain in England,
and at Cliveden, we must take every
possible precaution against a suspicion
arising among British authorities that
we are less than vigilant in this area.
This means, as I see it, that a judicial
council's recommendation to permit
(Jane) to return and remain at Cliveden
simply could not be accepted by the
University. This being the case, it
would be useless, and indeed unfair to
all parties, to submit such a question to
the judicial couneil on the pretense
that such a recommendation might be
accepted.
The very active public and police
concern in England over this issue,
including the possibility that (Jane)
would not in any case be permitted by
the immigration authorities to reenter
England while her case was pending,
put this decision rather clearly outside
normal judicial council concerns.. .
"In the case of (Jane), where the
evidence was already in the possession
of the police, and both her release
from jail and the date of her trial were
uncertain, it is not clear what kind of a
charge one would bring to a student
judicial council.
Jane's case is not an isolated
one. Within the last five months,
two other students have found
themselves in a similar situation.
A coed on the Stanford
Overseas Campuses charter plane
freaked out in the aisle. The pilot
ordered her deplaned in Paris. She
was turned over to the French
authorities and the Overseas
Campuses Office decided that she
could not continue in the
program
The second case involves a
student from the present Austria
group who is currently being held
in Britain on drug charges. Bail
has twice been denied him.
Hamrdla, assistant director for
the program, stated yesterday that
he did not know whether a
decision has been made on
whether the student can continue
in the program after his release.
At a time when student rights
in judicial procedures are being
widely recognized on the Stanford
campus, the arbitrary action of
discipline by administrative fiat at
overseas campuses seems
increasingly anacronistic.
Only Robert Walker, Director
of Overseas Campuses, can
determine whether or not
students accused or various rule
infractions shall have access to
due process.
This situation became apparent
during a Daily investigation of a
recent case involving a Stanford
coed overseas, arrented in France
for possession of drugs during
three week break.
Dr. Walker decided that she
could not return to Stanford in
Britain, and made this decision
while the student was being held
in jail awaiting trial.

The case raises significant
questions:
Should one man, Robert
Walker, ever be allowed to serve as
judge, jury, and court of last
appeal over a student in an
important disciplinary case?
Should the Director of Overseas
Campuses be allowed to ignore at
will standing disciplinary
procedures?
Does a student overseas have a
right to be notified that the
Director is considering his removal
from the program?
The answer to these questions
are important to any student who
is either enrolled in an Overseas
Campus or considering
enrollment. The answers are also
important to anyone who believes
that due process must be followed
in a student disciplinary case.
"Jane"
The case in question arose
when a Stanford coed, whom
we'll call "Jane," was arrested by
French police for possession of
one pound of hashish. She had
left the hasish at a campground,
wrapped as a package. She was
arrested when she went to the
police to pick up the package
which the campground owner had
turned in.
Mr. J. S. Rumbold, academic
director of Britain, first learned of
Jane's arrest when the girl who
had been traveling with Jane was
released after three days in jail.
Lang Atwood, a student in the
group and a Daily reporter,
interviewed Rumbold in
December on Jane's case and
made notes at that time.
According to Atwood,
Rumbold immediately contacted
the home campus when he learned
that Jane was being held and
began to investigate the matter.
He also contacted the American
Embassy in London, and they
informed him that the girl would
probably not be allowed by
immigration officials to return to
England.
Rumbold believed, that the
trial would be "long delayed."
Atwood reports, "It seemed
pretty clear that Rumbold had
done all he could for the girl."
Probably Unable
According to Rumbold, he and
Dr. Walker discussed Jane's case at
about the time the fall quarter
opened and after he had found
out Jane probably would be
unable to return to England for
most of the quarter. It was
decided Jane could not return to
Stanford in Britain.
Jane had not, however,
technically been "suspended." A
suspension would have implied
the right to appeal the decision to
the Dean of Students but would
not have allowed Jane to receive a
refund on her room and board
payment.
Sometime after the decision
was made. Dr. Walker contacted
John Hanson, associate dean of
students in charge of counseling.
Hanson stated that Dr. Walker
explained to him why the decision
had been made, and Hanson
offered no objections.
Walker explained the reasons
for the decision in a letter dated
November 21, 1969, solicited by
Rumbold. Rumbold showed
students the letter to answer their
questions about the case, and gave
a copy of the letter to Amanda

Rutherford, a student in the
group and a friend of Jane's.
