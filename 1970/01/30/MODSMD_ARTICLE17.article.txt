# Coming Home To Roost
## Ad Hoc Tenure 
### Mark Weinberger 
One comes to a job with fresh ideas,
enthusiasm, motivation, and an eye for the
creative. That person builds up a new and creative
program, complete with efficient management,
imagination, and flexibility. The program soon
basks in the sweet sunshine of success: it is
popular and soon emulated throughout the
country. Over the years, the newness and the shine
of the program wear off; cracks and deficiencies
appear, only to be pasted over by the same
solutions that earlier brought nothing but
admiration. After ten years, power inevitably
becomes personalized; the line between program
and personality becomes blurred almost beyond
recognition.
Of all the encrusted and unresponsive fiefdoms
that sprinkle this campus, Dr. Robert Walker and
his Overseas Campus program stands out as the
best example of the scenario for administrative
decay outlined above.
Few would fail to acknowledge Dr. Walker's
skill in constructing from scratch a top-rank
foreign study program for Stanford on a
less-than-lavish budget. During the late fifties when
the program was being built, the Robert Hutchins
notion of the liberal arts general education was at
the peak of its popularity; it seemed only natural
that the overseas campuses serve as centers for the
broad study of the humanities, fulfilling the
Stanford dream of a General Studies education for
all undergraduates. Also at this time, in loco
parentis remained the philosophic cornerstone of
non-academic life. Robert Walker perfectly filled
the bill as a firm, but benevolent dictator.
No Longer Benevolent
Walker's dictatorship is no longer benevolent in
1970. He remains director of a program that
several years ago surpassed his ability to change.
The Study of Education at Stanford report on
foreign study best reflects how far Robert Walker
is out of step with the times. The report demanded
campus autonomy, specialization, and flexibility
where bureaucratic centralism and standardization
have so long ruled the program. Were it not for the
sway that Walker holds over large numbers of
faculty (due to his absolute control over faculty
appointments to the foreign centers), that SES
program would probably be well on its way to
reality. As it is, the program continues to langor,
with Dr. Walker riding herd over his personal
prerogatives.

The overseas campus program should not fade
due to the intransigence of one man, giving 1950
answers to 1970 questions. Rather than becoming
the last spot for innovation, the campuses should
once again become the first. The opportunities are
endless for the truly motivated student:
independent study; field research; close contact
between students, faculty, and graduate students;
and specialized study projects for each campus. Is
the general education ideal still viable, or should
they become study centers for advanced
undergraduates? Why are graduate students barred
from attendance? Why should all students live on
the campus? These and other questions should be
fully considered, but haven't been.
Experimentation the Key
Undergraduates who have spent six months in
Europe with the overseas program almost
invariably admit it was the most valuable
experience while at Stanford. At the same time,
almost every returnee can spout a lengthy list of
personal horror stories that might have been
regretable at one time but are clearly unacceptable
today. The example of the girl in Britain
summarily expelled from the campus is the most
blatant but hardly the exclusive example of
authoritarian disregard for established judicial
procedures. In all other areas of student life the
campuses lag badly behind the home campus. The
time for a change in management is overdue.
Experimentation is the key to undergraduate
education. The overseas campuses are rapidly
losing their capacity to experiment, as they slowly
drown in red tape emanating from a man grasping
for the vestiges of power that such a wide-flung
program can provide.
The new committee structure which affords
increased autonomy to individual campuses has a
good chance for success. But it is doomed to
failure unless those who are administering the
program are working for the unqualified success of
that program. Ad hoc administrative tenure must
end; it is time for the Stanford administration to
recognize that no single man is more important
than the success of an important educational
experiment.

procedures. In all other areas of student life the
campuses lag badly behind the home campus. The
time for a change in management is overdue.
Experimentation is the key to undergraduate
education. The overseas campuses are rapidly
losing their capacity to experiment, as they slowly
drown in red tape emanating from a man grasping
for the vestiges of power that such a wide-flung
program can provide.
The new committee structure which affords
increased autonomy to individual campuses has a
good chance for success. But it is doomed to
failure unless those who are administering the
program are working for the unqualified success of
that program. Ad hoc administrative tenure must
end; it is time for the Stanford administration to
recognize that no single man is more important
than the success of an important educational
experiment.

overseas campuses.)
One comes to a job with fresh ideas,
enthusiasm, motivation, and an eye for the
creative. That person builds up a new and creative
program, complete with efficient management,
imagination, and flexibility. The program soon
basks in the sweet sunshine of success: it is
popular and soon emulated throughout the
country. Over the years, the newness and the shine
of the program wear off; cracks and deficiencies
appear, only to be pasted over by the same
solutions that earlier brought nothing but
admiration. After ten years, power inevitably
becomes personalized; the line between program
and personality becomes blurred almost beyond
recognition.
Of all the encrusted and unresponsive fiefdoms
that sprinkle this campus, Dr. Robert Walker and
his Overseas Campus program stands out as the
best example of the scenario for administrative
decay outlined above.
Few would fail to acknowledge Dr. Walker's
skill in constructing from scratch a top-rank
foreign study program for Stanford on a
less-than-lavish budget. During the late fifties when
the program was being built, the Robert Hutchins
notion of the liberal arts general education was at
the peak of its popularity; it seemed only natural
that the overseas campuses serve as centers for the
broad study of the humanities, fulfilling the
Stanford dream of a General Studies education for
all undergraduates. Also at this time, in loco
parentis remained the philosophic cornerstone of
non-academic life. Robert Walker perfectly filled
the bill as a firm, but benevolent dictator.
No Longer Benevolent
Walker's dictatorship is no longer benevolent in
1970. He remains director of a program that
several years ago surpassed his ability to change.
The Study of Education at Stanford report on
foreign study best reflects how far Robert Walker
is out of step with the times. The report demanded
campus autonomy, specialization, and flexibility
where bureaucratic centralism and standardization
have so long ruled the program. Were it not for the
sway that Walker holds over large numbers of
faculty (due to his absolute control over faculty
appointments to the foreign centers), that SES
program would probably be well on its way to
reality. As it is, the program continues to langor,
with Dr. Walker riding herd over his personal
prerogatives.

The overseas campus program should not fade
due to the intransigence of one man, giving 1950
answers to 1970 questions. Rather than becoming
the last spot for innovation, the campuses should
once again become the first. The opportunities are
endless for the truly motivated student:
independent study; field research; close contact
between students, faculty, and graduate students;
and specialized study projects for each campus. Is
the general education ideal still viable, or should
they become study centers for advanced
undergraduates? Why are graduate students barred
from attendance? Why should all students live on
the campus? These and other questions should be
fully considered, but haven't been.
Experimentation the Key
Undergraduates who have spent six months in
Europe with the overseas program almost
invariably admit it was the most valuable
experience while at Stanford. At the same time,
almost every returnee can spout a lengthy list of
personal horror stories that might have been
regretable at one time but are clearly unacceptable
today. The example of the girl in Britain
summarily expelled from the campus is the most
blatant but hardly the exclusive example of
authoritarian disregard for established judicial
procedures. In all other areas of student life the
campuses lag badly behind the home campus. The
time for a change in management is overdue.
