# Media Ban Discussed In FCM Caucus
## 
### 
"The news media, regardless of
political differences, should assert
its right to photograph any events
of a public and newsworthy
nature,'' commented Harvey
Hukari last Wednesday evening at
an informal meeting of the Free
Campus Movement.
The FCM is concerned over the
no-photos, no-tapes ban placed on
news coverage of community
meetings of the Stanford
Moratorium, an anti-ROTC
campus group.
Last December, an FCM
photographer for the
organization's newspaper, the
Arena, engaged in a running battle
with GE pickets between the
Placement Center and Tresidder
Union over a controversial roll ul
film.
After rejecting proposals to
hire FCM people out as a
protection service for
photographers, and scrapping the
idea to sell Arena photographs to
the Daily, Hukari suggested that
perhaps the Arena could combine
with other campus media to
resolve the problem jointly.
Lacking a quorum, the FCM
declined to come out with an
official stand regarding the ROTC
issue with the intent of waiting to
see what develops in the current
controversy before acting
themselves.
Hukari did state that he
personally felt that "ROTC
should be treated as is any other
federally funded activity, and that
if ROTC is abolished, then the
faculty should reconsider also the
$37 million dollars accepted in
the form of government grants for
research."
"Ideally, a private University
should be free from any ties with
the government," said Hukari.
