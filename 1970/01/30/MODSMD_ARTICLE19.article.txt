# Paly Round-up
## Open Spaces Valued 
### 
Open space around the city is
highly valuable to Palo Alto
residents, according to a recent
survey of attitudes on treatment
of surrounding foothills. Not only
do people want to live near
undeveloped land, but they are
willing to pay for the privilege.
Mow much would they pay? Of
the 835 responses, 152 checked
"more than $40"; 102 checked
$4 0; 97 checked $30; 172
checked $20; 108 checked $10;
and 128 checked "$5" or
"nothing."
Neighborhoods across the full
expanse of Palo Alto were
checked.
Park or other open space were
favored bv about two thirds of

those sampled. Other choices were
for low, medium, or high density
housing or industrial
development.
To the question of whether
Palo Alto should be larger in
population a huge majority
answered "no." There was a
similar negative response to the
question of industrial growth.

Traffic on Stanford Avenue
will be greatly slowed down by
the installation of stop signs. This
attempt to control the use of the
street was approved by the Santa
Clara County Board of
Supervisors Tuesday as an
alternative to closing it altogether.
Concerned about speeding and
excessive traffic on Stanford

Avenue, residents of the area had
asked the supervisors to alleviate
the problem.
Stanford officials suggested
that the Avenue be relinquished
to them by the county to be
subsequently closed at Foothill
Boulevard. This idea was refused
as it would eliminate the only full
length alternate to Page Mill, and
possibly result in uncontrollable
congestion of the Expressway.
The supervisors agreed to put
stop signs at the intersection of
Peter Coutts Road and Stanford
Avenue, and of Raimundo Way
and Stanford Avenue. A fatal
accident took place at Raimundo
and Stanford last year.
Of the complaints received by
the Board, one charged that
although the speed limit on
Stanford Avenue is 35, cars
actually go as fast as 65 or 70.

San Mateo County will be the
location of a comprehensive drug
abuse program, the first ot its
kind in California.
Included will be an acute
psychiatric inpatient clinit for
young people allowing for the
problems of drug detoxification.
Assistance drop-in centers and day
hospital programs in various parts
of the county have also been
proposed.
Eventually, group homes for
adolescent drug users are planned.
A coordinator would direct these
and community efforts to prevent
drug abuse as well.
The beginning inpatient unit
will be headed by a psychiatrist,
and will have access to all medical,
surgical, diagnostic, and
psychiatric services of County
General Hospital.
The staff will respond to calls
for assistance from police,
parents, teachers, or others who
know of sufferers of overdose or
other dangerous drug reaction.
