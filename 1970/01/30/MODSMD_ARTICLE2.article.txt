# Senate Censures Reed But Will Cover Debts
## 
### TINA COOPER 
In a stormy session, the student
Senate last night censured
Political Union Chairman Roger
Reed for signing contracts worth
over $5,000 for speeches by Sen.
Barry Goldwater and William
Buckley without ASSU approval.
However, spurred by the
probability of lawsuits from the
unpaid speakers, the Senate
agreed to pay those debts.
The meeting was opened with
the report of a special Senate
committee, which was formed last
week to look into the Reed
situation.
Pat Shea, member of the
Council of Presidents, speaking
for the committee, recommended
a general four-point program:
First, that Roger Reed pay the

fee for William Buckley's
appearnace or arrange for their
payment;
Second, that the Senate pay the
rest of the debt, amounting to
$5118.85.
Third, that rules be drawn up
to prevent any recurrence of one
student spending unauthorized
ASSU funds;
And fourth, that the matter be
referred to the Stanford Judicial
Council to look into the
possibility of legal action against
Roger Reed.
Liberal Walkout
At this point, a group of several
liberal Senators walked out of the
meeting, to sabotage action on the
issue for lack of a quorum.
Senator Doug McHenery, when
asked the reason for his action,
replied, "There aren't enough
points of view represented here.
This will be just a run-through
issue. We want to delay action
until everyone has a chance to
vote." The Senators remaining at
the meeting were mostly
conservative.
This maneuver was 'forestalled
by Chairman Dave Edwards, by
his calling a special meeting
immediately and persuading the
delinquent Senators to return.
Recommendations Defended
Senator Frank Philpot, a
member of the special committee,
then spoke defending the
committee's recommendations.
"Roger Reed may be stupid,"
he said, "but that isn't a crime.
There are no rules against it."
He recommended payment of
the debts in the belief that Reed
had acted out of ignornace of
ASSU authorization requirements,
and not for any individual gain.
Program Rushed Through
He was heatedly contradicted
by Chairman Dave Edwards, who
said it was his belief "that Reed's
intentions were to bring some
conservative speakers on
campus—and he rushed his
program through, spending all the
money he could lay his hands
on."
Several Senators then shot
questions at Reed, demanding
that he explain his actions.

"We had to rush this program
through last spring to get any
speakers at all," explained Reed.
"At the time, none of us on PU
knew of any rule requiring ASSU
approval of expenditures."
Will Not Pay
"Over 5,000 people benefited
from our program," he continued.
''It was an educational
experience."
When asked if he would accept
a $3,000 loan from the ASSU to
pay these debts, to be repaid later
by Reed, he said, "More people
than me enjoyed our program. I
have no obligation to pay for it.
I'm not paying for it." Reed was
reportedly given authorization by
the General Secretary's office
through the Dean of Students to
raise Buckley's honorarium
through limited use of the
university's fund raising list.
Leo Bazile then made a
scorching attack on Reed, asking
him what his motives had been in
attacking the Student Senate in
the Arena. "What was your
purpose," he demanded; "to show
off your journalistic ability?"
He went on to doubt the
selflessness of Reed's motives in
bringing such conservative
speakers to the campus.
Censure Passed
Shea then broke in to propose a
fifth point in the committee's
recommendations. He added:
"The ASSU Senate censures
Roger Reed, and prohibits him
from serving on any future ASSU
committee."
After some discussion, the
Senate passed the five-point
recommendation by a large
margin.
The Senate then went on to the
rest of the budget; allotting $2940
to the Special Events Board,
$1020 to the Speech Association,
$28,500 to the Stanford Daily,
and $650 to the Stanford Area
Tutorial Association.
There will be a special meeting
of the Senate at 9:00 Saturday
morning to enable the Senate to
consider its own budget. The
Stanford ROTC program will also
be discussed.

off your journalistic ability?"
He went on to doubt the
selflessness of Reed's motives in
bringing such conservative
speakers to the campus.
Censure Passed
Shea then broke in to propose a
fifth point in the committee's
recommendations. He added:
"The ASSU Senate censures
Roger Reed, and prohibits him
from serving on any future ASSU
committee."
After some discussion, the
Senate passed the five-point
recommendation by a large
margin.
The Senate then went on to the
rest of the budget; allotting $2940
to the Special Events Board,
$1020 to the Speech Association,
$28,500 to the Stanford Daily,
and $650 to the Stanford Area
Tutorial Association.
There will be a special meeting
of the Senate at 9:00 Saturday
morning to enable the Senate to
consider its own budget. The
Stanford ROTC program will also
be discussed.

STUDENT SENATORS (from left) Boh Corey, Jon Sylvester, and Mike Iluliington listen glumly to lengthy debate Ihat
ultimately absolved Roger Reed for expenses incurred in bringing conservative speakers to campus fall quarter. However,
the prestigious Senators voted to censure Reed for bis intemperance.


In a stormy session, the student
Senate last night censured
Political Union Chairman Roger
Reed for signing contracts worth
over $5,000 for speeches by Sen.
Barry Goldwater and William
Buckley without ASSU approval.
However, spurred by the
probability of lawsuits from the
unpaid speakers, the Senate
agreed to pay those debts.
The meeting was opened with
the report of a special Senate
committee, which was formed last
week to look into the Reed
situation.
Pat Shea, member of the
Council of Presidents, speaking
for the committee, recommended
a general four-point program:
First, that Roger Reed pay the

fee for William Buckley's
appearnace or arrange for their
payment;
Second, that the Senate pay the
rest of the debt, amounting to
$5118.85.
Third, that rules be drawn up
to prevent any recurrence of one
student spending unauthorized
ASSU funds;
And fourth, that the matter be
referred to the Stanford Judicial
Council to look into the
possibility of legal action against
Roger Reed.
Liberal Walkout
At this point, a group of several
liberal Senators walked out of the
meeting, to sabotage action on the
issue for lack of a quorum.
Senator Doug McHenery, when
asked the reason for his action,
replied, "There aren't enough
points of view represented here.
This will be just a run-through
issue. We want to delay action
until everyone has a chance to
vote." The Senators remaining at
the meeting were mostly
conservative.
This maneuver was 'forestalled
by Chairman Dave Edwards, by
his calling a special meeting
immediately and persuading the
delinquent Senators to return.
Recommendations Defended
Senator Frank Philpot, a
member of the special committee,
then spoke defending the
committee's recommendations.
"Roger Reed may be stupid,"
he said, "but that isn't a crime.
There are no rules against it."
He recommended payment of
the debts in the belief that Reed
had acted out of ignornace of
ASSU authorization requirements,
and not for any individual gain.
Program Rushed Through
He was heatedly contradicted
by Chairman Dave Edwards, who
said it was his belief "that Reed's
intentions were to bring some
conservative speakers on
campus—and he rushed his
program through, spending all the
money he could lay his hands
on."
Several Senators then shot
questions at Reed, demanding
that he explain his actions.

"We had to rush this program
through last spring to get any
speakers at all," explained Reed.
"At the time, none of us on PU
knew of any rule requiring ASSU
approval of expenditures."
Will Not Pay
"Over 5,000 people benefited
from our program," he continued.
''It was an educational
experience."
When asked if he would accept
a $3,000 loan from the ASSU to
pay these debts, to be repaid later
by Reed, he said, "More people
than me enjoyed our program. I
have no obligation to pay for it.
I'm not paying for it." Reed was
reportedly given authorization by
the General Secretary's office
through the Dean of Students to
raise Buckley's honorarium
through limited use of the
university's fund raising list.
Leo Bazile then made a
scorching attack on Reed, asking
him what his motives had been in
attacking the Student Senate in
the Arena. "What was your
purpose," he demanded; "to show
off your journalistic ability?"
He went on to doubt the

conservative speakers on
campus—and he rushed his
program through, spending all the
money he could lay his hands
on."
Several Senators then shot
questions at Reed, demanding
that he explain his actions.

"We had to rush this program
through last spring to get any
speakers at all," explained Reed.
"At the time, none of us on PU
knew of any rule requiring ASSU
approval of expenditures."
Will Not Pay
"Over 5,000 people benefited
from our program," he continued.
''It was an educational
experience."
When asked if he would accept
a $3,000 loan from the ASSU to
pay these debts, to be repaid later
by Reed, he said, "More people
than me enjoyed our program. I
have no obligation to pay for it.
I'm not paying for it." Reed was
reportedly given authorization by
the General Secretary's office
through the Dean of Students to
raise Buckley's honorarium
through limited use of the
university's fund raising list.
Leo Bazile then made a
scorching attack on Reed, asking
him what his motives had been in
attacking the Student Senate in
the Arena. "What was your
purpose," he demanded; "to show
off your journalistic ability?"
He went on to doubt the
selflessness of Reed's motives in
bringing such conservative
speakers to the campus.
Censure Passed
Shea then broke in to propose a
fifth point in the committee's
recommendations. He added:
"The ASSU Senate censures
Roger Reed, and prohibits him
from serving on any future ASSU
committee."
After some discussion, the
Senate passed the five-point
recommendation by a large
margin.
The Senate then went on to the
rest of the budget; allotting $2940
to the Special Events Board,
$1020 to the Speech Association,
$28,500 to the Stanford Daily,
and $650 to the Stanford Area
Tutorial Association.
There will be a special meeting
of the Senate at 9:00 Saturday
morning to enable the Senate to
consider its own budget. The
Stanford ROTC program will also
be discussed.
