### MICHAEL KUHL 
An environmental conference
on the "Issues of the 70's." will

politicians and pollution control
experts next Friday, Feb. 6 at the
College of San Mateo.
Organizers expect a crowd of
around 10,000 for the keynote
address at 11 a.m. by Democratic
gubernatorial hopeful Jess Unruh

"Wo are attempting to organize
on a very mass scale a discussion
of what we—as individuals, as
government, as industry—can do

now to combat pollution," said
Ralph Fenton, chairman of the
organizing Student Ecology
Committee.
Unruh's speech is expected to
bo a major explanation of his
environmental program. Governor
Ronald Reagan was invited to
take part in the/ afternoon panel
discussion, but ho has a previous
engagement in southern
California.
Over ten high schools and all
the Bay Area colleges have been
invited to take part.
The original idea for the

conference grew out of a Iree
expression English class three
months ago. At that time,
according to Fenton, "we decided
what we wanted to do, and we
have been working on it every day
since."
The core group of 16 students
are planning a Teach-in on April
22 of the same mass scale. They
have already started meeting with
organizers of Stanford's effort.
"Things like this will bring us
together," Fenton notes. "Right
now there are just too many
environmental groups who aren't
working together all around the
country."
The committee plans to
publish a small pamphlet at the
end of the conference explaining
how a successful teach-in is
organized.
