# Wolfe Evaluates USSR's Policies
## 
### JOHN BOWEN 
Attacking the term "peaceful
coexistence" as "poisonous
semantics," historian Bertram
Wolfe, in a Wednesday address,
discussed his past personal
contacts with the Communist
party and his present-day
evaluation of Soviet intent.
"Genuine coexistence means
tolerance of other regimes," said
the Hoover Institution Research
Fellow, "something that the
USSR docs not practice." Wolfe
quoted Lenin as considering peace
to be only a "breathing spell when
you're unable to finish off the
enemy," and admonished that the

United States must "keep its
guard up."
Wolfe was a member of the
Mexi c a n an d Ameri can
Communist parties during the
1920's and a delegate to the
Soviet-sponsored Comminterns in
1924 and 1928. He later rejected
these "early years of my life" and
became an ant i-Com munist
historian, author, and advisor to
the State Department during the
1950'5. His major work, I'llr«»e
Who Made a Kevolution, has been
translated into 18 foreign
editions, some of which are
presently on display in the lobby
of Meyer Library.
Inevitable Tyrann\
While recounting his personal
experiences in the Party, Wolfe
made continual reference to the
"basic nature" and "distinguishing
features" of socialism (although
his examples were exclusively of
Russian-based socialism).
He referred to the
phenomenon of the "queve in front
of every store" in Moscow as such
a feature, and discounted
suggestions that had Trotsky
prevailed over Stalin in the Soviet
Union, that country might have
been spared the "cruelty and
ruthlessness" which marked the
latter's reign.
Describing the American
Communist Party, of which he
was a self-accredited founder,
Wolfe likened it to the Brooklyn
Bridge, in that "they are both
suspended by cables." He was
referring to the Russian direction
of the affairs of United States
Communists.
Mexican Delegate
While studying in Mexico in
the early 1920'5, Wolfe found
himself caught up in the activities
of the Mexican Communist Party,
and was sent as a delegate to the
1924 International Communist
Congress in Moscow. An
"innocent abroad," he was
overpowered by the "impassioned
rhetoric" in the Congress, and
began actively to work in the
American Communist Party, first
as the Educational Director, and
then as a delegate to the 1928
Congress of the Comintern.
It was at this point that Wolfe
began a feud with Joseph Stalin
that eventually led to his
discredidation and rejection of the
Party. Like Arthur Koestler's
"God that Failed," Wolfe saw his
formerly idolized "country of
peace" turn to terrorism and
perjury, and turned away from
Russian study altogether to
become an expert in Latin
American culture and history.
In 1939, however, when Stalin
and Hitler concluded their
"friendship pact," Wolfe decided
that he had an "obligation to use
my inside knowledge of the
Party" to work against what he
saw as a potentially
world-destroying combination.
He then contracted to write
"Three Who Made a Revolution,"
a study of the instigators of the
Russian revolution, and began a
career which led him to his
present position in the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution,
and Peace.
