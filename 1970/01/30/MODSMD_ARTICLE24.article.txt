# "Out Of It" Isn't
## Subtle Flick Probes High School Days 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
At first glance Out of It appears
to be a dated film with a
hackneyed plot; an intellectually
advanced, socially retarded
"brain" concerned because he's
not beautiful and not part of the
rah-rah scene in high school.
But there hasn't been a picture
as subtly sensitive and aware of a
world that's all too concerned
with appearances and impressions,
whether it be high school, college,
or the real world.
The films success lies in the fact
that it is a personally nostalgic,
autobiographical exploration of
director Williams' days of high
school in 1959. Set in 1964 and
filmed in 1967, the story is as
relevent today as it was eleven
years ago.
Saves Picture
Barry Gordon, who appeared in
"A Thousand Clowns," gives a
truly convincing performance as
Paul, the intelligent one. He
doesn't play Paul; he is Paul and
succeeds in saving the picture
from becoming a cliche. We're
given a very poignant view from
the eyes of a guy who knows what
it feels like to be out of it.
Of course there's the
antagonist; dumb superstud Russ,
played by Jon Voight. Fact: this
is not a "Jon Voight" film, but
rather a "Barry Gordon" film.
Hopefully Voight's name will
attract people who might
otherwise have missed the picture.
Gretchen Corbett is
outstanding as Barbara, the girl
who worries that her friends will
find out she dated Paul. Lada
Edmund Jr. rounds out the high
school stereotype as Russ'
girlfirend, but possesses a form
and face more apt to be seen on
Broadway (S.F.) than cheering at
a football game.
First Effort
Out of It is an impressive first
effort by the team of twenty-five
year old producer Edward

Pressman and twenty-four year
old director Paul Williams.
Independently financed by
Pressman, a 1965 graduate of
Stanford, the film was finished in
1 968 and bought upon its
completion by United Artists,
several months before Voight was
signed for "Midnight Cowboy."
Considering the inevitable
success of "Midnight Cowboy,"
release of "Out of It" was
postponed until this month.
Unfortunately, in the meantime,
the youth in conflict syndrome
was explored in "Last
Summ«r,""Slcrile Cuckoo,"
"First Time," ad infinitum,
lessening the effect "Out of It"
might have had prior to the flood
of films with similar themes.
Pressman and Williams have just
completed their second film with
Voight, "The Revolutionary," a
psychological study of a middle
class boy attracted to radicalism.
Now that's a relevent story.
Being shown on Monday night,
February 2, at 7, 9 and 11 is a
selection of the best short films
made recently by Stanford film
makers. Several of the films have
had national recognition and the
program offers an abundance of
films with unusual subjects (and
generally good execution) as
opposed to the technology
oriented special effects films of a
year or so ago.
Taking place in Cubberley, the
program includes "The Ring," a
flowing romantic mood piece,
"It's a Camp," a provocative
documentary about a homosexual
transvestite, "Campus Christi," a
very funny and timely religious
take-off on campus life which was
a prizewinner at the Foothill Film
Festival and is part of the new
Genesis Two collection of
experimental films, and "Some of
My Best Friends Are Bottomless
Dancers," a documentary about a
man who choreographs belly
dancers.

Such showings of locally made
films are amusing not only
because of the films' qualities but
because many familiar faces often
appear on the screen, perhaps
even your own.

Though it's not exactly in the
province of films, I feel compelled
to recommend the television
broadcast of The Front Page on
Saturday night. This is the great
comedy written by Ben Hecht and
Charles Mac Arthur back in the
twenties and the play has recently
enjoyed a spectacularly successful
return engagement on Broadway.
The cast is superb—Robert Ryan,
George Grizzard, Vivian
Vance—and upon viewing the

revival, Mac Arthur's widow
promounced it better than the
original production forty years
earlier.
It's a superb story set in a
Chicago newspaper office and is
full of colorful characters and
beautiful wise-cracking dialogue.
As produced on Broadway, the
show was about the most
enjoyable evening I'd spent in the
theatre in a couple of years, so I
hope they do it justice on the
tube. At 9:30 on channel 2.

Good double bills this
weekend: in San Francisco—Don't
Look Back and Monterey Pop at
the Times, Sanclio the Bailiff and

Ikiru at the Palace, IMarat/Sade
and That Man From Rio at the
Cento Cedar, Rebecca and
Wuthering Heights at the Surf
Interplayers.
At the Surf today and
Saturday—Pagnol's The Baker's
Wile and Carrie's Port ot Shadows.
Starting Sunday are Clair's A
Nous la Liberte and Ophuls' La
Ronde, which I'll report on next
week. And at the Berkeley
Telegraph Repertory, Samuel
Fuller's cult classic, Shock
Corridor , along with Peter
Bogdano-vich's Targets, a
tragically under-rated film which
was one of the best of last year.
