# Wine Camouflages Cover Catastrophes

### CATHY COOPER 
Among "Lessons from the
Past" I include this invaluable
tidbit gleaned from a Johann
Strauss Jr. song "The Art of
Cooking": "For when I made a
slight mistake, I just add a bit
more wine for flavor's sake!"
You'll find me humming this
frequently as I fumble my way
through the kitchen.
Besides its camoflage value,
wine also adds instant snob
appeal. Beef stew becomes Boef
Bourguignonne, baked chicken
becomes Chicken Sauterne, ad
nauseam. In my impecunious state
the marvelous thing about
cooking with wine is that even the
cheapest stuff produces great
results.
Besides drowning your faux pas
in wine you can add wine to the
liquid in any dish that is
simmered, or try
BURGANDY MEATBALLS
IV2 lb ground beef
1 egg
IV2 t. salt
dash pepper
V4 c. milk
2T. instant onion
IV2 T. flour
'A t. garlic powder
1 c. condensed bouillon

2T tomato paste
V* c. raisins
V4 c. Burgundy
Mix the first six ingredients and
1 T. onion. Shape and brown in
butter in a skillet. Remove, blend
flour and garlic powder in
drippings. Add onion, next three
ingredients and meat balls. Cover
and simmer 10 minutes. Stir in
Burgundy and serve 4-6 people.
When you need a way to
dispose of that white wine, try
this; it's easy and posh enough for
entertaining.
SIMPLE SOLE MARGUREY
1 lb. fillet of sole 1 can cream of
shrimp soup V2 c. sherry V* c.
butter 2 T. lemon juice 1 t.
Worcestershire grated cheese 1
finely chopped onion 2 t. parsley
1 T. lemon juice
Mix sherry, soup, lemon juice
and Worcestershire. Melt butter in
shallow baking dish, add fish,
sprinkle with onion parsley and 1
T. lemon juice. Pour soup mixture
over fish, top with grated cheese
and bake 30 - 45 min. at 375
degrees.
The taste of both of these
dishes is improved if you drink a
glass of wine before serving.
