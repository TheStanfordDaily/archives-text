# Horne Debut
## Vocal Artistry Delights All 
### GREG PHILLIPS 
It has been said that it is far
easier to write a scathingly critical
review than to write a laudatory
one. In the former the reviewer
often has occasion to display what
he believes is his biting wit,
whereas in the latter adjectives of
praise piled one on top of the
other tend to sound like cliches
and to bore the reader.
For these reasons I hoped that
Marilyn Home, making her San
Francisco recital debut last
Saturday at the Masonic
Auditorium, would make at least
one glaring mistake on which I
could pounce. My hope went
unrealized, to the delight of all
concerned.
First, the general quality of
Miss Home's voice should be
noted. It has a very wide range:
from high soprano to the lowest
contralto. Nowhere in that range
is there an apparent flaw. Perhaps
most astonishing is Miss Home's
low range; there are no deep notes
that are barely audible or
bellowed, everyone is sung
Artist
But Miss Home is not merely a
good singer, she is a very great
artist with her voice.Every item
on an extremely varied program
of arias and classical song was
handled as an individual work of
art, demanding different responses
from the singer. Thus, Schubert's
song "The Young Nun,"
describing the inner tranquility of
a nun amidst a storm that is
crashing around her, w;iÂ« sung
with convincing fervor. On the

other hand, a light funny song by
Richard Strauss, "For Fifteen
Pennies," was given a humorous
treatment, which had the
audience laughing with Miss
Home.
The list of wonderful effects
could continue forever. But
mention should be made of the
charming personal quality of the
artist. She is definitely not in the
prima donna tradition of haughty
temperament.
Down to Earth
Marilyn Home is a big, jovial
woman. She rewarded the
extremely appreciative audience
with three encores, explaining

each with a touch of humor
before she began. Her last encore
was a Spanish carol whose words,
according to Miss Home, mean
"St. Joseph was a carpenter, O!
The Virgin Mary was a
washerwoman, O! One day the
baby Jesus came down from
heaven," and then with a knowing
grin from Miss Home, "St. Joseph
was a carpenter, O!"
At the conclusion of the song,
Miss Home, who had previously
joked about ner need for exercize,
kicked up her heels, graciously
acknowledged the standing
ovation which she richly deserved,
and left the stage - a fine
conclusion to a superb concert.
