# For What It's Worth
## Big Brother Returns To Dink 
### CRAIG OKINO 
Of the original San Francisco
rock bands, only two have
remained intact, Jefferson
Airplane and the Grateful Dead,
and even they have gone through
personnel changes. The original
groups were free of the
pretentious bullshit so prevalent
in most second and third wave
bands, but internal hassles
eventually led to the
disintegration of some of the best
rock groups the culture has
produced—Country Joe and the
Fish, Moby Grape, Quicksilver
Messenger Service, and Big
Brother and the Holding
Company.
There has lately been a
"revival" of these bands, though
not with the original members.
Country Joe and Barry Melton
have found three new Fish,
ex-Grapes Jerry Miller and Don
Stevenson are now in the Rhythm
Dukes, and all the members of
Quicksilver have re-formed

(including rhythm guitarist Gary
Duncan, who left a year ago),
adding Nicky Hopkins and Dino
Valenti to the Messenger Service.
Big Brother Rises
But perhaps the most
interesting rebirth is that of Big
Brother and the Holding
Company. Critics shat on them
constantly as being inadequate,
even lame back-up for the vocal
talents of the now-infamous Janis,
and this verbal diarrhea
contributed to Janis' departure.
She then proceeded to form a
back-up band which was
inadequate and lame (and has
since dissolved).

Jan is' Kosmic Blues album
blatantly reveals the absence of
Big Brother. Janis is no Aretha
Franklin, just a gutsy rock'n'roll
singer, and Big Brother and the
Holding Company was a gutsy,
raunchy rock'n'roll band. Andrew
and Albin were solid musicians
with good vocal ability, and James

Gurley played some amazing
freak-rock lead guitar. But they
were soon forgotten when the
supposed superstar left.
No Surrender
The boys didn't give up,
though, and were out to prove
themselves without Janis. They
played the Family Dog benefit
last month under the name
Humble, Mumble, Fumble and
Jumble with Steve Miller at
Fillmore West. Since then they
have added Nick Gravenites as
vocalist. Nick has been in music as
long as any—he wrote songs for
the first two Butterfield albums,
was lead singer for the Electric
Flag, and has been working with
Mike Bloomfield and Quicksilver.
G;avenites' roots are in Chicago
blues, though, and Big Brother's
roots are anything but that;
whether the two can smoothly
combine is a question which can
be answered tonight in Dinkelspiel
(you were wondering when I was
going to sneak in this plug,
weren't you?).
On Campus
The Poppycock and KZSU are
co-sponsoring the Big Brother
concert, one of the few
on-campus rock shows this year
(or any other year, for that
matter). Tickets are $3.25 ($2.25
for students) for either the 8:00
or 10:30 shows, available at the
door, at Tresidder, or at Discount
Records
Charlie Musselwhite's band is
also appearing. Musselwhite, a
Chicago bluesman all the way,
plays fine harp and has a
bad-assed steel guitar player
named Freddie, and he can play!
The overall band sound is
reminiscent of early Butterfield.
Don't pass up a rare opportunity
to catch some fine music right in
your own backyard. And try
tuning in to KZSU after 12 —those
weird dudes who have that time
slot might be able to arrange iive
interviews with members of both
groups.

The overall band sound is
reminiscent of early Butterfield.
Don't pass up a rare opportunity
to catch some fine music right in
your own backyard. And try
tuning in to KZSU after 12 —those
weird dudes who have that time
slot might be able to arrange iive
interviews with members of both
groups.

Of the original San Francisco
rock bands, only two have
remained intact, Jefferson
Airplane and the Grateful Dead,
and even they have gone through
personnel changes. The original
groups were free of the
pretentious bullshit so prevalent
in most second and third wave
bands, but internal hassles
eventually led to the
disintegration of some of the best
rock groups the culture has
produced—Country Joe and the
Fish, Moby Grape, Quicksilver
Messenger Service, and Big
Brother and the Holding
Company.
There has lately been a
"revival" of these bands, though
not with the original members.
Country Joe and Barry Melton
have found three new Fish,
ex-Grapes Jerry Miller and Don
Stevenson are now in the Rhythm
Dukes, and all the members of
Quicksilver have re-formed

(including rhythm guitarist Gary
Duncan, who left a year ago),
adding Nicky Hopkins and Dino
Valenti to the Messenger Service.
Big Brother Rises
But perhaps the most
interesting rebirth is that of Big
Brother and the Holding
Company. Critics shat on them
constantly as being inadequate,
even lame back-up for the vocal
talents of the now-infamous Janis,
and this verbal diarrhea
contributed to Janis' departure.
She then proceeded to form a
back-up band which was
inadequate and lame (and has
since dissolved).

Jan is' Kosmic Blues album
blatantly reveals the absence of
Big Brother. Janis is no Aretha
Franklin, just a gutsy rock'n'roll
singer, and Big Brother and the
Holding Company was a gutsy,
raunchy rock'n'roll band. Andrew
and Albin were solid musicians
with good vocal ability, and James

Gurley played some amazing
freak-rock lead guitar. But they
were soon forgotten when the
supposed superstar left.
No Surrender
The boys didn't give up,
though, and were out to prove
themselves without Janis. They
played the Family Dog benefit
last month under the name
Humble, Mumble, Fumble and
Jumble with Steve Miller at
Fillmore West. Since then they
have added Nick Gravenites as
vocalist. Nick has been in music as
long as any—he wrote songs for
the first two Butterfield albums,
was lead singer for the Electric
Flag, and has been working with
Mike Bloomfield and Quicksilver.
G;avenites' roots are in Chicago
blues, though, and Big Brother's
roots are anything but that;
whether the two can smoothly
combine is a question which can
be answered tonight in Dinkelspiel
(you were wondering when I was
going to sneak in this plug,
weren't you?).
On Campus
The Poppycock and KZSU are
co-sponsoring the Big Brother
concert, one of the few
on-campus rock shows this year
(or any other year, for that
matter). Tickets are $3.25 ($2.25
for students) for either the 8:00
or 10:30 shows, available at the
door, at Tresidder, or at Discount
Records
Charlie Musselwhite's band is
also appearing. Musselwhite, a
Chicago bluesman all the way,
plays fine harp and has a
bad-assed steel guitar player
named Freddie, and he can play!

reminiscent of early Butterfield.
