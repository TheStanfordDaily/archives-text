Saturday, February 7, has
been designated by the
Committee for Art at Stanford
as a special day of pick up
service for treasure market 70.
The proceeds from this annual
event will go toward
acquisitions for Stanford's
permanent art collection.
Those who wish to make
donations may call 328-7149,
Tower House, or 948-2903,
Mrs. David Mason, to arrange
for having contributions picked
up on Saturday, February 7.
You may also bring your
donations to Tower House at

campus
A crew of volunteer drivers
will be on call throughout the
day to pick up donations and
take them to the Treasure
Market Warehouse. For over
six months Committee for Art
members have been collecting
china, silver, crystal, furs,
antiques, brass copper, books,
garden accessories, jewelry,
rugs, paintings and sculpture
for the March sale.
All donations are totally tax
deductible. The sale will take
place at the old Basketball
Pavilion on the Stanford
campus March 19, 20, and 21.
