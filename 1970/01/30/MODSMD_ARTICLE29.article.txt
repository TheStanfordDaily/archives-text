## 
### 
ALEA 11, Stanford's ensemble
for new music, will present its
first free winter concert at 8 P.M.
Sunday, Feb. 1, in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. The program will
include various contemporary
music such as Electronic, Graphic,
Improvisation, as well as
combinations of electronic and
instrumental music, graphic music
and movement improvisation,
instrumental music and slide
projection.
The ensemble was founded by
Theodore Antoniou, composer in
residence from Athens who is
teaching at Stanford this quarter.
Sunday's program will open
with "Concert for Eight" by the
Spanish composer Roberto
Gerhar. This piece is in the spirit
of the commedia dell'arte. The
Belgian avant-grade composer
Henri Pollissar. "Events III",
Antoniou's latest work will have
its American premiere.

Actual and musical events are
integrated in a kind of
mixed-media work for orchestra,
tapes, and projections.
"Reverberations" is an electronic
piece by Ivan Tcherepnin, who is
teaching this year at Stanford.
Julie Steinbert will play the
"Klavierstucke No. IX" by
Stockhausen, an outstanding
figure in the contemporary music
scene. The ensemble will perform
"Five Pieces for Orchestra" Op.
10 by Anton Webern. Webern was
responsible for numerous radical
changes in musical styles and his
techniques include the beginnings
of serialism.
The program ends with an
improvisation on a graphic score
by Anestis Logothetis. The piece
bears the title "Odessy" and the
score is represented in a very
complicated "Path." A movement
group will improvise according to
the music and the "path" will be
projected.
