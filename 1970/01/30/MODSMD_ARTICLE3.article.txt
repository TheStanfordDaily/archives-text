## Seale Denies Conspiracy 
### 
CHICAGO (AP)— Bobby G. Seale,
once a defendant in a riot
conspiracy trial stemming from
the Democratic National
Convention, testified Thursday
that he had not known the seven
other defendants before the
convention.
Seale, 33-year-old chairman of
the Black Panther party, was
severed from the trial after
repeated outbursts during which
he demanded permission to
defend himself in the absence of
his chosen attorney.
He has since been in custody in
California on other charges and is
scheduled to stand trial later on
the charges stemming from the
1968 convention.
The defendants are charged
with conspiring to incite rioting
the week of thy convention.
Under questioning by defense
attorney William M. Kunstler,
Seale testified that he did not
know any of the defendants prior
to coming to Chicago Aug. 27,
1968.

Earlier testimony brought out
that Seale spoke in Lincoln Park
the evening he arrived in town and
that he had urged "barbequing
some of that pork." The
prosecution had construed the
reference to barbequing pork to
mean killing policemen, since
Black Panthers and some others
refer to the police as pigs.
Kunstler played a tape
recording of that speech and
asked Seale his definition of
"pig."
"A person or policeman who is
generally found violating the
constitutional rights and human
rights of the people," Seale
answered.
Strike Over?
NEW YORK (AP)—A tentative
agreement on a new contract
which would end the 95-day
strike of General Electric
production workers was
announced late Thursday night.
The terms of the settlement

were not disclosed, pending union
ratification.
Presidential mediator J. Curtis
Counts who announced the
conclusion of the marathon
bargaining predicted it would be a
week to 10 days before all of the
130,000 striking employees are
back to work.
While he refrained from
discussing terms, the tentative
agreement was said to include an
hourly wage boost of more than
80 cents over a 40-month period.
He said the accord was reached
with top officials of the AFL-CIO
International Union of Electrical
Workers, and the Independent
United Electrical Workers, which
accounts for the bulk of the
striking workers.
"It is my expectation that what
comes out of these negotiations
will be a pattern" for the other 10
GE unions, Counts said.
The prolonged work stoppage
had cost workers more than $200
million in lost wages and the
company suffered untold losses.
During the strike, GE became the
focus of a nationwide AFL-CIO
boycott.
Council Named
WASHINGTON (AP)-Secretary
of Defense Melvin R. Laird,
sounding dubious about prospects
for an all-volunteer military force,
apparently has come around to
former President Johnson's
thinking.
Reflecting nearly a year-long
search for ways to end reliance on
the draft, Laird said Thursday "I
personally believe that you have
to get down to a level for an all
volunteer service . . . near the 2
million man mark."
This recalled Johnson's March
6, 1967, message to Congress,
reporting that ''research
has . . . disclosed that volunteers
alone could be expected to man a
force of little more than two
million."
An armed force of that size
would be the smallest since just
before the Korean War when there
were only 1.46 million Americans
in uniform. To get down that far,
the Pentagon would have to trim
nearly 1.3 million men from
current levels.
The Nixon administration has
been reducing the over-all size of
the armed forces as the Vietnam
war unwinds, but Laird never
spoke before in terms of a
post-Vietnam force much below
2.6 million men.

The Nixon administration has
pledged to move toward an
all-volunteer force. But it may be
finding it unfeasible to generate
enough volunteers to reach a 2.5
million-man level after Vietnam
without the prod of the draft
and-or vastly increasing spending
to attract enough men into
long-term military careers.
After three major studies, the
Johnson administration—which
also wanted to shuck the
draft—concluded it couldn't be
done.
UCSB Protest
SANTA BARBARA
(AP)—University of California at
Santa Barbara officials closed the
administration building Thursday
as 2,000 students rallied in front
to protest the dismissal at the end
of this semester an assistant
professor.
Student leaders said some
would remain camped in front of
the building throughout the night
and resume the demonstration
Friday.
The rally was to protest the
school's refusal to rehire William
Allen in the anthropology
department. Allen has been
teaching under a probationary
contract at UC Santa Barbara
since thd fall of 1968. A school
spokesman said Allen did not
meet the department's needs.
The university library also was
closed during the morning after a
bomb scare. A window was
smashed in the administration
building and campus police
detained one unidentified student.
During the afternoon university
officials spoke to the protestors.
Price l|>
WASHINGTON (AP)-President
Nixon named his Council on
Environmental Quality Thursday.
The appointments were warmly
received in conservationist circles
although there was some misgiving
about whether the new group will
receive adequate funding.
Nixon's choice of Russell E.
Train, 49-year-old undersecretary
of the interior as the council's
chairman, had been widely
expected. But some
conservationists were pleasantly
surprised at the nominations of
Robert Cahn and Gordon J.F.
Mac Donald as the Council's other
two members.
