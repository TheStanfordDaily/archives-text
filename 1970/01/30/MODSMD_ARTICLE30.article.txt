# Undefeated Wrestlers Edge Gators
## 
### 
Three straight triumphs by Stanford's upper weight
wrestlers powered the Indians to a close 19-14 upset win
over San Francisco State at the Old Pavillion Wednesday
night. The undefeated grapplers are now 7-0 on the
season.
For the second match in a row the Tribes heavier
wrestlers carried the team to victory. After Bill Ross
gained an exciting 0-0 draw, the grapplers needed at least
two victories and a draw for a team victory.
Terry Crenshaw and Ray Williams set the stage by
decisioning their men, as Crenshaw avenged the only
defeat in his last two years of varsity competition. It was
then up to heavyweight Lee Fair to gain at least a draw,
and he responded with a 12-5 decision to insure an Indian
win. . ,
150 pounder Len Smith lost his first match of the year

in a contest that could have gone either way. The
refereeing was questionable in two situations and had a
different decision been made he would have walked olf
the mat a winner.
Stanford's Bruce Bell, Jerry Beaudoin and Steve Goss
all lost to tough men, but Dave Thomas won over his man
by the hairy margin of 7-6 after hurting his arm early in
the second period. Using his weight he was able to
effectively hold on for the victory.
The Gators sorely missed the presence of their best
man, 1 26-1 b. Art Chavez. Last year Chavez was a member
of the U.S. World Greco-Roman wrestling team. His
absence Wednesday cost SFS a probable ten points.
The Indians Dave Kopolow was again unable to
wrestle. As reported earlier, he will be lost to the team for
two or three weeks with a blood disorder.

Tomorrow the Cards will participate in the S.F. State
Invitational Tournament, one of the best such events on
the coast. Teams from Cal Poly, San Diego State,
University of Nevada and elsewhere will be represented.
Starting at 10 a.m., the tourney will last all day, as
Stanford looks to improve on its third place finish of last
