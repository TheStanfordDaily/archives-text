## Tribe Warms Up For Yale 
### STEVEN LACHOWICZ DOUG WILSON 
The awesome Stanford
swimmers, who have not given up
more than 29 points in dual meet
competition yet this season, will
take on a weak Cal squad
tomorrow at Berkeley. Victory
would seem to be a hopeless task
for the Bears as the Indians have
men in the national rankings in
every event.
Rather than worrying about
the Bears, the Tribe will be
warming up for their meet next
week with Yale. Cal has won only
one meet so far this season,
defeating OSU, the last place
conference team, 62-50. Last
week they lost to Washington
74-39 after Stanford had beaten
Washington 84-29.
However, the Indians will be
juggling their line up, trying to set
up the strongest possible team for
the following week. As a result,
the best races will be between
Stanford swimmers trying for a
place on the team that will go
against the Ivy-League
powerhouse.
In the 1000 yd. freestyle,
freshman Tim Broderick will swim
against sophomore Mark Shelley
and junior Brent Berk. Berk has
the fastest time on the team so
far, but any one of them could
win it.
The 500 free will be another
good one with Ferris, Haywood,
and Shelley battling it out for top
spot. Ferris has been down with
the flu this week, but he holds the
varsity record in the event.
The Bears do have some strong
performers left from last year's
squad as well as a good crop of
junior college transfers and frosh.
In the distance events, Joel
Wilson will team up with
freshman Mike Asch. Sprintwise
the Bears will go with J.C. transfer
Jim Wiltens, frosh Paul Nolan,
sophomore Gerry Keeler, and
senior Wes Ashford.
Sophomore Tim Musch isCal's
best swimmer and can handle any
event. But he is most likely to be
in the breast-stroke and individual
medley. In the backstroke, Mike
Selna returns and will be joined
by Lance Dilloway and frosh Guy
Molina, a 1969 high school
Ail-American.
Of course the Cal-Stan ford
rivalry always manages to draw
fine performances from the
participants, but it seems
impossible that the Bears could
even come close unless the Tribe
failed to show up.

Clyde Devine is Stanford's
head diving coach.
He is also a very happy man.
"Prospects for Stanford's
diving team have never been
brighter," Devine beamed at a
recent meet. He has just cause to
be proud. So far, divers Bill Main
and Ted Nichols have swept all
but one diving event (Santa
Clara's Julian Krug edged Nichols
for second place off the 1-meter
board), and Main, a junior from
Los Altos, is undefeated in
1-meter competition.
Two years ago, Main placed
6th in the NCAA diving finals.
Although he was out of
competition last year, Devine feels
that "Bill should be close to the
top this year in national
competition, especially in 1-meter
diving."
Sharing the diving spotlight
this year is Palo Alto junior Ted
Nichols,sporting a new moustasche
and old knee pains. Nichols was a
key to Stanford's narrow victory
over powerhouse USC last year,
edging a Trojan diver to take an
all-important second place in
diving. "If Nick's knee holds up,"
commented Devine, "we should
go one-two in dual meet
competition this year.
Of junior-college transfer Ed
Lederman—an All-American in
jaycee competition—Devine says
"Ed is a good third man,
constantly battling Fred Bachman
for position as back-up man" (to
the Main-Nichols Team).
Bachman, a sophomore from
Tallahassee, Fla., was the
mainstay of last year's freshman
diving team. His place is taken this
year by Steve Riffenburgh, a
Pasadena freshman who placed
last year in CIF competition.
Devine looks for a "rosy future"
with his promising underclassmen.

Devine pointed out that his
divers have been in training since
September 29, a length of time
which reflects both their attitude
and performance. "I'm pleased
with the great attitude of the
divers, and it's showing in the
score," he said, as the results of
the 3-meter diving were
announced: first place Ted
Nichols, second, Bill Main.
