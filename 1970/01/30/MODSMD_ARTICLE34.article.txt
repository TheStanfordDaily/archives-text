# Armed Guards Engulf Pavilion
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
The Pacific 8 conference has
always been noted for fine guards
and this weekend five of this
season's best will be in action at
Maples Pavilion as Stanford hosts
USC and UCLA. The Indian's
combination of Claude Terry and
Dennis O'Neill will be challenging
UCLA's John Vallely and Henry
Bibby and USC's Dennis Layton.
Vallely was an all-NCAA
tournament performer last year
for the Bruins and he is hitting at
a 17.6 clip through the Bruins
fourteen victories without a loss.
Bibby is a hot shooting
sophomore who is hitting on 54.2
percent of his shots while
averaging 15.6 points. The two
combine to give UCLA what most
experts consider the best
backcourt on the Coast.
But some Stanford fans
contend that the Indian guards are
second to none. Terry is averaging
18.1 points and O'Neill, after 35
points against Wyoming, is close
behind at 17.0 points. Yet when
guards are being mentioned, USC
fans point to Dennis Layton, a 6-0
junior who is leading the
surprising Trojans with a 19.0
scoring average.
Although there is no doubt
that Stanford is strong in the
backcourt, it is in the front line

where Cards have had trouble on
their way to a disappointing 4-10
record. But last weekend's
performance by 6-4 forward
Chuck Moore has greatly
bolstered the Indians up front.
Moore, after some troublesome
injuries, has upped his scoring
average to 9.5 while averaging a
fine 7.8 rebounds a game. Coach
Howie Dallmar says that this week
Moore has had the best practices
of his career. Against USC and
UCLA, Fred Green (6-4) and Bill
Palmer (6-7) will close out the
starting five.
USC comes into tonight's game
11-3 overall and 2-0 in league
play. Over the past few years the
Trojan athletic department,
disappointed that their basketball
team had never reached the
prominence their football, track
and swimming teams always
enjoy, dipped into their farm
leagues (otherwise known as
California and Arizona junior
colleges) and came up with
enough bonafide performers to
make them an immediate league
contender.
Layton, along with skirting
forward George Watson (6-8) and
reserve forward Leroy Cobb (6-6),
were picked up in one swoop at
Phoenix JC. The other starting
forward is Don Crenshaw (6-4) a

transfer from Chabot JC in
Hay ward. The Trojan starting five
is rounded out by center Ron
Riley (6-8) and guard Dana Pageet
(6-1). Riley and reserve guard Paul
Westphal follow Layton in the
scoring column with identical
10.6 averages.
The UCLA Bruins come onto
the Stanford campus for the
fourth year in a row as the
number one team in the nation.
Coach John Wooden's basketball
machine enters the Bay Area with
a perfect 14-0 record.
The Bruins have abandonded
their Lew Alcindor style and are
back to the old run and shoot
style of Gail Goodrich and Walt
Hazzard.
The UCLA front line of Sid
Wicks (6-8), Curtis Rowe (6-6V2)
and Steve Patterson (6-9) is one of
the best in college basketball.

Wicks, a junior from Los Angeles,
is leading the Bruins with a 17.9
average, but Rowe, another LA
junior, is close behind at 15.6
Patterson has the enviable job
of filling in for the departed
Alcindor, but has done well and is
averaging 11.1 points and 11.0
rebounds a game.
The Bruins front line alone is
enough to beat a lot of teams, but
when you add Vallely and Bibby,
the Bruins number one ranking is
hard to dispute.
In preliminary games this
weekend, the Stanford Frosh will
try to extend their six game
winning streak against San
Francisco State and Santa Clara.
The SF State game will be at 6:00
tonight, while the Santa Clara
game will be played following the
UCLA contest at 4:30 tomorrow.
