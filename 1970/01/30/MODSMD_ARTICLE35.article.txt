# Racial Tension
## Reverberations At Laramie

(Editor's note: Don Tollefson discussed consequences of racial
incidences at the University of Wyoming with Wyoming basketball
coach Bill Strannigan last week.)

For years the University of Wyoming has been the prototype
Western Athletic Conference school, with high pressure athletics and
low pressure academics. The athletic program has been big both in
success and financial expenditure.
In fact the Cowboys had won the WAC football championship
three years in a row. In a western state with a small population, U. of
Wyoming has been able to build winners with an extensive recruiting
and scholarship program. Black athletes from out of state have played
a major role in recent Wyoming athletic success.
But early last fall, the role of black athletes took on a new
dimension atWyoming as black athletes began to involve themselves in
political activism. On October 17, the day before a football game with
Brigham Young, 14 black members of the football team planned to
take part in a demonstration against Mormon racial policies.
Mormons Again
Prior to the demonstration, the blacks went to Coach Lloyd
Eaton's office in a group, wearing black armbands, to talk about some
form of protest to be shown during the game. But Eaton, incensed by
the armbands, claimed that the blacks were acting as a faction,
contrary to team rules, and he dropped them from the team on the
spot.
Within 18 hours after Eaton's action, the Wyoming trustees
announced that they were backing Eaton completely. At the same
time support for Eaton poured in from across the state. But students
at other WAC schools spoke out for the blacks and a movement was
started demanding that Wyoming be dropped from future schedules.
In the midst of all the controversy, the school's president Dr.
William Carlson dropped a bombshell by admitting unintentionally at
a press conference that at Wyoming football comes first and civil
rights second.
The blacks claimed that Eaton had dropped them without
listening to them and without giving them a reason. In an attempt to
gain reinstatement, the blacks secured the services of an NAACP
lawyer who unsuccessfully sought a federal court injunction against
the university. All subsequent civil suits up to now, have also been
unsuccessful.
Shock Survives
Three months later, the Laramie campus has not "eally recovered
from the shock of the incident,, and last week I discussed the problem
with Wyoming basketball coach Bill Strannigan.
Strannigan has already felt the effect of the problem on his own
team. One of his top guards, a black, quit the team before the season
started in sympathy with the football players' demands. Three blacks
remain on the team including two starters, Carl Ashley and Willie
Roberson. Ashley is a two time all-WAC performer and the team's
leading scorer.
But Strannigan points out that their decision to stay on the team

has not been easy on them. "Ashley's parents in Denver have been
threatened and intimidated, but both they and Carl are sticking it
out," according to Strannigan.
The coach was also certain that all three blacks have been pressured
to quit, but so far they have not given in to the pressure.
When questioned about the upcoming games against BYU,
Strannigan said, "I don't know what to expect. All three players
assured me earlier that they would play, but with the violence that
happened at Arizona, I just don't know."
One thing Strannigan made clear was that he wouldn't allow the
blacks to wear armbands during the BYU game as the Arizona players
did in a game a couple of weeks ago. "They'll either play as usual, or
they won't play at all."
Future Effects
Aside from the immediate problems of the BYU games, the coach
also discussed the long term effects of the entire situation. "I feel that
this whole incident has set back our athletic program at least five
years. Next year's football team will be greatly hurt by the loss of the
black players." Strannigan also sees definite problems in the recruiting
of blacks in the future. Already indicative of the problem is the fact
that Wyoming's freshman basketball team has no blacks on it.
Wyoming beat Stanford last weekend, but the athletic scene in
Laramie is not very bright. Recruiting is going to get even harder and
the move to drop Wyoming from the schedules of other schools has
not ended. Unless there is a major shakeup in the athletic department,
Wyoming may never regain the success it has enjoyed in the past.

blacks to wear armbands during the BYU game as the Arizona players
did in a game a couple of weeks ago. "They'll either play as usual, or
they won't play at all."
Future Effects
Aside from the immediate problems of the BYU games, the coach
also discussed the long term effects of the entire situation. "I feel that
this whole incident has set back our athletic program at least five
years. Next year's football team will be greatly hurt by the loss of the
black players." Strannigan also sees definite problems in the recruiting
of blacks in the future. Already indicative of the problem is the fact
that Wyoming's freshman basketball team has no blacks on it.
Wyoming beat Stanford last weekend, but the athletic scene in
Laramie is not very bright. Recruiting is going to get even harder and
the move to drop Wyoming from the schedules of other schools has
not ended. Unless there is a major shakeup in the athletic department,
Wyoming may never regain the success it has enjoyed in the past.

For years the University of Wyoming has been the prototype
Western Athletic Conference school, with high pressure athletics and
low pressure academics. The athletic program has been big both in
success and financial expenditure.
In fact the Cowboys had won the WAC football championship
three years in a row. In a western state with a small population, U. of
Wyoming has been able to build winners with an extensive recruiting
and scholarship program. Black athletes from out of state have played
a major role in recent Wyoming athletic success.
But early last fall, the role of black athletes took on a new
dimension atWyoming as black athletes began to involve themselves in
political activism. On October 17, the day before a football game with
Brigham Young, 14 black members of the football team planned to
take part in a demonstration against Mormon racial policies.
Mormons Again
Prior to the demonstration, the blacks went to Coach Lloyd
Eaton's office in a group, wearing black armbands, to talk about some
form of protest to be shown during the game. But Eaton, incensed by
the armbands, claimed that the blacks were acting as a faction,
contrary to team rules, and he dropped them from the team on the
spot.
Within 18 hours after Eaton's action, the Wyoming trustees
announced that they were backing Eaton completely. At the same
time support for Eaton poured in from across the state. But students
at other WAC schools spoke out for the blacks and a movement was
started demanding that Wyoming be dropped from future schedules.
In the midst of all the controversy, the school's president Dr.
William Carlson dropped a bombshell by admitting unintentionally at
a press conference that at Wyoming football comes first and civil
rights second.
The blacks claimed that Eaton had dropped them without
listening to them and without giving them a reason. In an attempt to
gain reinstatement, the blacks secured the services of an NAACP
lawyer who unsuccessfully sought a federal court injunction against
the university. All subsequent civil suits up to now, have also been
unsuccessful.
Shock Survives
Three months later, the Laramie campus has not "eally recovered
from the shock of the incident,, and last week I discussed the problem
with Wyoming basketball coach Bill Strannigan.
Strannigan has already felt the effect of the problem on his own
team. One of his top guards, a black, quit the team before the season
started in sympathy with the football players' demands. Three blacks
remain on the team including two starters, Carl Ashley and Willie
Roberson. Ashley is a two time all-WAC performer and the team's
leading scorer.
But Strannigan points out that their decision to stay on the team

has not been easy on them. "Ashley's parents in Denver have been
threatened and intimidated, but both they and Carl are sticking it
out," according to Strannigan.
The coach was also certain that all three blacks have been pressured
to quit, but so far they have not given in to the pressure.
When questioned about the upcoming games against BYU,
Strannigan said, "I don't know what to expect. All three players
assured me earlier that they would play, but with the violence that
