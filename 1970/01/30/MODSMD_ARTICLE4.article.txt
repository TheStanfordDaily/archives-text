# Latin American Studies
## Mexico Program Set 
### JOHN COONROD 
Starting next fall there will be a
Stanford-in-Mexico.
Unlike other Stanfords abroad,
the study program will combine
independent study and classes
taught in Mexican universities.
There will be no Stanford
"campus"; the program will
function from an office and
seminar room at one of the
universities in Mexico City.
The program will initially be
limited to fifteen undergraduates
who are at least sophomores and
have completed second-year
Spanish. Applicants will be chosen
also on their long- term interest in
Latin America.
Social Science Focus
Professor Paul Mandell, the
program's first director, said that
there would be a focus on the
social sciences. The program will
have a core seminar twice a week
which will use the social science
discipline to explore the roots of
Latin American development and
change.
It will integrate the students
independent work, and be the
central group activity. Mandell
said that since the course will be
held in Mexico would serve "as
the embodiement of aspects of
Latin America" in general.
Course work will probably be
carried out at La Excuela
Nacional de Antropologia e
Historia, La Universidad Nacional
de Mexico, and La Universidad
Iberoamicana."
Resources Praised
Mexico City was chosen
because it offers the best
academic resources in libraries,
Universities, and research
organizations.
"Other cities were considered,
but not for long," Mandall
explained, saying that most Latin
American nations do not have
education facilities with the range,
quality, and "neutral, academic,
attitude" the program wanted.
"There just isn't the market"
for professors in most Latin
American countries, he said,
because there is a very small
intellectual minority. Outside
Mexico, the Ph.D. professor is
often the exception.
"Mexico is a poor country, but
it has had the most successful
development over the past fifty
years." Mandell, of the Rood
Research Institute, is a
geograph is-econ om ist, whose
research has principally been in
Brazil, and the rest of Latin
America.
Mot ivation Stressed
He said the new program will
rely heavily on the strong

motivation of the students
involved, and that it would be
harder for students to adapt to
the course than to other overseas
campuses.
Stanford undergraduates will be
in no way isolated from the
people of Mexico; present plans
call for the use of two Mexican
boarding houses for housing.
Mandell said that the program
would offer a special opportunity
for students hoping to do
graduate study in Latin America.
They would gain the advantage of
learning the general customs of
working there: how to use
libraries, talk to people and work
with them, all in the customary
way of those nations.
He also hopes that the first
group to go wijl impress the
Mexicans that this is a serious
academic project. The United
States, he said, "has tried these

projects before, some of them
more or less serious."
Applications Available
The two quarter program is a
joint undertaking of the Center
for Latin American Studies and
the Office of Overseas Programs.
It is the first such Stanford
program in Latin America.
Information and application
forms will be available at Bolivar
House, the Overseas Campuses
Office, Building 1, Inner Quad,
and at the Department of Spanish
and Portuguese.
The application will include a
statement of what the applicant
would like to have as his
individual project, and his answer
to the question, "my GPA does
not properly represent my
achievement because. . ."
The deadline for applications is
March 16th.
