# English TA's Vote Not To Stop Work
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
English Teaching Assistant's
last night decided against holding
a work stoppage next week. A
proposal to stop work was tabled
until the T. A.'s had an
opportunity to examine proposals
made to them by the English
Department. Daily reporters were
barred from the closed meeting
which was held in an English
Department staff room
Mark Moscowitz, Executive
Committee Chairman of Local
1816, American Federation of
Teachers, stated after the meeting
that the T. A.'s were considering
proposals from lan Watt,
Chairman of the English
Department, concerning teaching
assistant salary policy. He would
not comment on the nature of
proposals. Watt could not be
reached for comment.
A University decision to
withhold federal income tax from
the salaries of teaching assistants
and teaching fellows started the
present controversy. The T.A.'s
and the American Federation of
Teachers claim the decision
constituted an effective breach of
contract by the Administration.
Lincoln Moses, Dean of
Graduate Studies, told the Daily
last night that the Administration
was studying federal income tax
laws in an effort to discover

possible ways of avoiding the tax
liabilities. These alternatives
included rearranging teaching
schedules and interrupting periods
of fellowships.
He explained that this would
entail having a graduate student
work for two quarters as a
teaching assistant or teaching
fellow and receive a fellowship for
one quarter of the academic year.
Since fellowships are not taxable,
such actions would have the effect
of reducing a T.A.'s taxable salary
without lowering his actual
income.
Last night's meeting was one of
a series of actions taken by the
English Department Teaching
Assistants, including the picketing
of President Pitzer's Office last
Thursday. Teaching assistants
from other departments, A.F.T.
members and members of the new
Stanford Moratorium also
participated in that
demonstration.
Merle Rabine, a Freshman
English teaching assistant,
explained that the T.A.'s barred
reporters from last night's meeting
for fear that open reporting of the
discussion would damage their
bargaining position with the
Administration.
The English Department
teaching assistants will meet with
Moses at noon todav.
