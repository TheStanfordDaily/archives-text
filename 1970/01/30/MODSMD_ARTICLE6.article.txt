# ROTC May Include Non-Military Credit
## 
### LEO NICHOLAS (Second of a Series) 
Army ROTC, already
substantially altered this year,
may be changing more under new
plans developed by the Military
Science Department.
Awaiting University approval
are proposals to assign cadets to
other departments for related
course work and obtain partial
academic credit for separate
leadership courses taught by
military instructors.
Military Science Professor
Colonel Stanley Ramey has
outlined tenative plans calling for:]
—18 accredited units of
non-military courses taught
through University departments.
Cadets would select classes from a
master list with the consent of his
academic and military advisor.
Probable courses include
international relations, the
economics of developing nations,
and group dynamics.
—The equivalent of 12 units in
leadership and management

instruction spread over four years
(i.e. one unit per quarter). These
would be taught by Army
officers. Ramey hopes to work
out a partial credit arrangement
with the University.
—Continued monthly field
training emphasizing practical
problems. More voluntary field
trips military installations are
planned to supplement training.
No credit is given now or sought
for this segment of the program.
Also being discussed are
possible changes in the "punitive"
clauses in scholarship and
advanced course contracts. These
allow defense department officials
to order a cadet to active duty for
"willful violation" of contract
terms.
Scholarships Converted to Loans
"Perhaps a cadet could have his
"scholarship" converted into a
repayable loan if he decides not to
complete the program and serve in
the Army." This would give
maximum choice and flexibility in
planning long-range decisions.
Figuring tuition increases, the
four-year bill for a scholarship
cadet runs over $13,000. Contract
students in the advanced course
receive about $1,000 during their
junior and senior years.
Reduced Teaching Load
With a much-reduced teaching
load, fewer Army instructors will
be needed, Ramey says. Five are
presently employed. As for an
increase/decrease in enrollment,
that's "extremely hard to say
right now."
Army ROTC, once a stable,
firmly-rooted institution at
Stanford, finds itself cast about
and remolded in shifting political
winds. But Ramey hopes that
after several years' wrangling some
acceptable compromise witn tne
University will be agreed upon "in
the very near future."
