# Graduation
## 
### 
All seniors: ihi.s is your last chance
to graduate this year.
The bureaucracy-that-be says
y<Â»n must present yourself at Room
130 of the Old Union today in
order to graduate in either April or
June. Once there, you must
complete some nefarious forms that
will prove that you've mastered all
that Stanford has to offer.
The authorities tell us that this
order to appear applies to both
A.B. and H.S. candidates.
