# Crimes
## Rape, Thefts Add Up To 'Normal Weekend' 
### 
A rape, a 'till-tap' at Tresidder
Drugstore, and a burglary at the
residence of Junipero's faculty
resident highlighted a weekend of
numerous crimes on the Stanford
campus.
However, one police officer last
night characterized the weekend
as "fairly normal and
routine—some are better and some
are worse." He indicated that, on
the whole, it was "mostly a quiet
and peaceful" period and said that
it was not a particularly abnormal
weekend in any respect.
The trouble started Friday
night when a coed was raped as
she walked up Palm Drive from
the railroad station. Police said
last night that no new leads had
developed in the case. (For a
related article, see page six.)
At about 5:15 p.m. yesterday,
five or six Negro juvenile males
entered the Tresidder Memorial
Union Drugstore, according to a
police spokesman. After milling
around the store for several
minutes, one of the youths asked
the cashier about the price of a
cigarette lighter. As the cashier
was attempting to determine the
price of the article, someone
reached over the counter and
removed some bills from the $10
compartment of the register.
Amount Unknown
The amount taken was not
immediately known, pending an
audit of the day's sales. Police last
night estimated the loss at
between $10-50. Santa Clara
County sheriffs obtained
descriptions of two of the
juveniles and a set of fingerprints
inside the store. They later issued
an all points bulletin for the five,
who were last seen headed on foot
across White Plaza.
Also over the weekend, the
apartment of Associate Professor
of English Albert Gelpi, in
Wilbur-Junipero, was burglarized.
Although an official report was
not available late last night, police
indicated that two or three white
"school-age" juveniles took a
television set and a women's
purse. No estimate of the loss was
available.
Police said that several students
had reported seeing the youths
taking the television set out of the
building. Police emphasized that
an official report had still not
been filed.
Lens Stolen
Santa Clara County sheriffs
were also investigating the
burglary of a camera lens from the
Stanford Daily's darkroom. The

theft was believed to have taken
place between midnight on Jan.
30 and 3:30 p.m. yesterday
afternoon, when it was first
discovered.
Other crimes reported during
the weekend included two auto
burglaries and a fistfight in front
of Stern Hall.

Amount Unknown
The amount taken was not
immediately known, pending an
audit of the day's sales. Police last
night estimated the loss at
between $10-50. Santa Clara
County sheriffs obtained
descriptions of two of the
juveniles and a set of fingerprints
inside the store. They later issued
an all points bulletin for the five,
who were last seen headed on foot
across White Plaza.
Also over the weekend, the
apartment of Associate Professor
of English Albert Gelpi, in
Wilbur-Junipero, was burglarized.
Although an official report was
not available late last night, police
indicated that two or three white
"school-age" juveniles took a
television set and a women's
purse. No estimate of the loss was
available.
Police said that several students
had reported seeing the youths
taking the television set out of the
building. Police emphasized that
an official report had still not
been filed.
Lens Stolen
Santa Clara County sheriffs
were also investigating the
burglary of a camera lens from the
Stanford Daily's darkroom. The

theft was believed to have taken
place between midnight on Jan.
30 and 3:30 p.m. yesterday
afternoon, when it was first
discovered.
Other crimes reported during
the weekend included two auto
burglaries and a fistfight in front
of Stern Hall.
A rape, a 'till-tap' at Tresidder
Drugstore, and a burglary at the
residence of Junipero's faculty
resident highlighted a weekend of
numerous crimes on the Stanford
campus.
However, one police officer last
night characterized the weekend
as "fairly normal and
routine—some are better and some
are worse." He indicated that, on
the whole, it was "mostly a quiet
and peaceful" period and said that
it was not a particularly abnormal
weekend in any respect.
The trouble started Friday
night when a coed was raped as
she walked up Palm Drive from
the railroad station. Police said
last night that no new leads had
developed in the case. (For a
related article, see page six.)
At about 5:15 p.m. yesterday,
five or six Negro juvenile males
entered the Tresidder Memorial
Union Drugstore, according to a
police spokesman. After milling
around the store for several
minutes, one of the youths asked
the cashier about the price of a
cigarette lighter. As the cashier
was attempting to determine the
price of the article, someone
reached over the counter and
removed some bills from the $10
compartment of the register.
