Blciek Studies
Editor, THE DAILY:
The first article in the Daily on
the "Black Studies" Program at
Stanford confuses our devotion to
academic excellence with lack of
commitment to what is now
widely recognized as "The Black
Revolution." No sensitive Black
person can repudiate what
Malcolm X and Martin Luther
King died for. It gives the
impression that we make a fetish
of sterile intellectualism or
"ebony tower" attitudes. This is
not our position. Mr. Casimere,
quite legitimately, was
emphasizing the uniqueness of the
Stanford program in his interview.
For my part, I should now like to
supplement his remarks by
putting what we are attempting to
do within the wider context.
The Undergraduate Program in
African and Afro-American
Studies here came into being in
response to the local thrust of the
nationwide "Black Revolution."
Black Studies are embedded in the
core of the programâ€”entire
courses or discussion sections that
view the world from"The Black
perspective; courses in Black
literature, drama and music (and,
we hope, art in the future); and
workshops planned that will relate
academic work to activities in
nearly Black communities. This
central focus is both necessary
and desirable. Black students face
a world where racism is by no
means dead and "ghettos" are not
likely to disappear in the near
future. "Relevance" is the key
word in any meaningful college
education for them. It includes
professional competence, but
other things, too.
However, all the courses in the
Program are not Black Studies
courses. Some reflect more
traditional approaches to
black-white relations. But as the
Program develops, these will
become ''collateral" and
"supplementary" courses for
those who are majoring in the
Program. The main value of the
Program lies, perhaps, in the
opportunity it gives to Black
students who are not majors to
have a choice of courses every
term that help them to
''define themselves for
themselves," "to get themselves
together," and to prepare them to
"take care of business" after they
leave Stanford.
A Student Participation Center
is operating in East Palo Alto

where those who wish to do so
may express their commitment to
serve their people. The African
and Afro-American Studies
Program is not an action program,
but it does not exist in isolation
from such programs. I stated my
view of the relationship, in an
address delivered last year, as
follows:
"It is my contention that
acceptance of the criterion of
"relevance" does not necessarily
dictate an anti-intellectual stance;
that there are intellectual tasks
associated with the Black
Revolution just as there are with
any revolution; and, that these
tasks are as important as the
"street tasks." They demand
trained cadres. Colleges and
universities are the institutions
that have the resources to supply
such training. Some committed
and dedicated individuals owe it
to the movement with which they
are associated to secure that type
of training. There are books to be
written, classes to be taught, and
seminars and discussion groups to
be led. There are position papers
on many issues to be prepared.
Black "think tanks" of the future
will require men and women who
know how to think clearly and
cogently, and even to computerize
some aspects of their operations.
The Black Revolution cannot
afford anti-intellectualism within
its ranks anymore than it can
operate with only intellectuals in
its ranks."

The Red Herring Mystery
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have followed with great
interest your coverage of the
Overseas Campus situation.
Speaking as former Chairman of
the Steering Committee of S.E.S.,
my view is that understandable
administrative reasons have so far
thwarted implementation of the
structural recommendations of
the S.E.S. Report on Study
Abroad, a report which in my
view was by far the most solidly
based report rendered by any of
the S.E.S. topic committees.
In my judgement, the
Academic Senate made a serious
mistake when it decided to adopt
what has been described as the
Brooks plan rather than the
original S.E.S. plan. It would have
been far better to organize a
separate committee for each
overseas campus and then to form
from the separate committees a
central co-ordinating committee.
Instead, the Senate chose to
organize the central committee
first and then to allow it to form
sub-committees, thereby
perpetuating the situation that
still prevails. The basic unit should
be the individual overseas campus.
Substance has in my judgment
given way to administration. The
administrative tail continues to
wag the dog of education abroad.
Perhaps the Brooks
compromise can result in the
necessary changes, although I have
my doubts. If it does not within
the current year, the Academic
Senate should re-examine the

matter and adopt the original
S.E.S. proposal.
The question of "administrative
tenure" is a red herring. "There
ain't no such animal." In my
judgment, if the present Director
of Overseas Campuses cannot
accomodate himself to changes in
needs and wants, he should be
encouraged to resign.

Jecpers, Dean Moses
Editor, THE DAILY:
To assuage my guilt at being
a teaching assistant, and there
fore living on a salary that
''still exceeds the stipends
received by hundreds of graduate
students now at Stanford on
University Fellowships, NSF,
NIH, NDEA Fellowships and
Traineeships," I hereby accept
one of these scholarships or its
equivalent. My reception of the
postulated grant will relieve me of
the necessity of worrying the busy
administration about the
embarrassingly trivial fact that
due to the "regrettable tax bite,"
I am now taking home $212.00
per month rather than the fat
$240.00 that fed and sheltered
my wife and I so well before the
fall.
I fear that you will argue that
in accepting the exchange I may
well increase my guilt: on one of
the scholarships you have cited I
would receive full tuition rather
than half (and would not have to
pay the University a thousand
dollars or so upon getting my
Ph.D.), and would be given less
money for doing nothing but
selfish work toward my own
degree.
You have me against the wall,
Dean, but I will do my best to
cope with my new, diminished
position, and will comfort myself
with the thought that by
retreating a step from the true
"business" of the University, I
will be enhancing my prestige.
My anger that not a single Dean
has come to my office to enquire
if I have suffered a disaster in my
pocketbook will be wiped away
by your gift. And my guilt will at
last be lifted.

Computer Complexities
Editor, THE DAILY:
You have probably noticed on
your final grade report that the
computer is programmed not to
make the differentiation between
minuses and pluses. This means
that the difference between a C
and a B+ is the same as one
between a C+ and B-, i.e., 2.0
versus 3.0 in both cases.
As a graduate student at
Berkeley, I can suggest a way of
correcting this deficience. It is the
way, in fact, that UC Berkeley
deals with the problem. Very
simply, someone reprograms the
computer so that it will attach the
following values to the following
grades: C- is 1.7; C is 2.0; C+ is
2.3; B- is 2.7; B is 3.0; B+ is 3.3;
A- is 3.7; A is 4.0.
At Stanford many seem to

recognize the problem, but do not
realize how serious it is, especially
for graduate study application.
For some, the present Stanford
system presents a serious
disadvantage; and for others, it
gives an unfair advantage. Since
you are competing with your
Stanford colleagues in applying to
graduate schools, you can all at
least require that the grading
system be more equitable than it
is.

Ali Baba, Roger!
Editor, THE DAILY;
Thank you for publishing Mike
Wolf's article "The Lynching of
Roger Reed." Mike has unmasked
and laid open for all to see some
of the disgusting work of the
extremists Shoch and Braunstein.
Good work, Mike.

The Seltzer Speaks!
Editor, THE DAILY:
The charges about the Press and
the Bay Area printing unions
made by Mr. Garner in the Daily
are untrue, as your use of single
quotes around the words
'exploitation' and 'racism'
suggests you suspected when you
published the article
