WASHINGTONâ€”"HeIIo, this is
the Black Tigers' headquarters.
Oh, hi there, Mrs. Vanderschmidt.
. .What's that? You're giving a
cocktail party at your Sutton
Place apartment and you'd like to
hire two Black Tigers. . .Yes,
ma'am. That can be arranged. .
.What kind did you have in mind?.
. .You want them militant. . . Of
course, Mrs. Vanderschmidt, all
our Black Tigers are militant. .
.Armed or not armed?. . .The
difference?. . .Well, if they're
armed, there's an extra
$2-an-hour charge. . .Yes, ma'am,
they'll be armed. . .Would you
like the same two we sent you last
week at your after-theater party
for Eldridge Cleaver?. . .They
didn't curse at your guests
enough. . .I'm surprised to hear
that. They are the two most
militant Black Tigers we have on
our list. . .
"I'll select the new Black
Tigers personally. The air will be
purple with language. . .Thank
you, Mrs. Vanderschmidt. . .On
the contrary, it's our pleasure to
do business with you."

headquarters. . .Hello there, Mr.

Grace, haven't heard from you in
a few months. . .Oh, you've been
to Acapulco and now you'd like
to get back in the swing of
things?. . .Well, we have a new
member who could really get your
party off the ground. . .Shot three
cops. . .and a truant officer in San
Francisco. . .That's right. He's out
on bail now, and if you want him,
you better speak up for him. No
telling when his trial will come up.
"Besides, I'm not supposed to
tell you this, but Mrs. Regina
Flanduffer has put in a bid for
him already. . .Since you do so
much business with us, I'd like to
give you preference. . .Don't
worry, Mr. Grace, he's mean. Have
I ever sent you anyone who
wasn't mean?. . .You'll take him?
Good. . .$5OO plus $150 for a
bodyguard of two Black Tigers. .
.Thank you, sir."

headquarters. . .Who's this?. .
.Tiger Pete . . .What are you
doing? You're supposed to be at
the Crotherhousers'
housewarming in Scarsdale. . .You
are there? What's up?. . .The
Crotherhausers don't want you to
stay? Why not? Because you're
wearing a shirt and a tie and a
suit?. . .What the hell are you
wearing a shirt, tie and suit for?. .
.Your Tiger clothes were stolen. .
.Well, if that isn't the living end. .
"Let me speak to Mrs.
C r o th e r h a use r . . .Mrs.
Crotherhauser, I'm terribly sorry
about Tiger Pete showing up that
way. . .Of course he's a real Black
Tiger. . . Mrs. Crotherhauser, stop
crying. All our Black Tigers are
legitimate. . .Your neighbors think
he's just someone you hired from
the area?. . .But didn't he show
you his Black Tiger tattoo?. .
.Don't worry, Mrs. Crotherhauser,
he'll tell off your guests. . .It's still
early in the evening. . .Look, if he
doesn't make everyone in the
room ashamed they're white, I
will personally refund your
money. . . Thank you. Let me
speak to Tiger Pete. . .Pete, get off
your butt and start telling it like it
is. . .And take off your shirt and
tie and for God's sakes eat with
your hands. . .

Charming, how are you?. . .You're
giving your granddaughter an 1 Bth
birthday coming-out party?. .

but we've never had any
debutante parties here at
headquarters. . .She has her heart
set on it?. . .1 don't know. .
.You'd like a Black Tiger to escort
each young lady as she is
presented?. . .1 don't know . .
.You'd like a Black Tiger to escort
each young lady as she is
presented?. . .1 suppose it could
be arranged, though it is rather
unusual. . .1 understand, money is
no object. . .All right, we'll book
the place for you. . .What's that?
Would we mind Lester Lanin's
orchestra playing here?. . .Of
course not. He plays for all our
