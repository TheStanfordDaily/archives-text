# Ecology Education Lacking' Says Prof
## 
### 
Ecology is a major concern today. How it is
taught is not. But with Paul Hurd things are
different.
Tucked away in the School of Education, the
soft-spoken professor concentrates on the when's
and how's of environmental education.
Hurd visualizes a web of interlocking
environmental problems, and fears that education is
too fragmented to untangle the mess.
"Any problem of pollution has ramfications in
many areas," he explained. "For example, to
preserve the beauty of the Bay we may have to clear
land. This dislocates people and involves social,
political and legal questions."
But the knowledge to attack these problems is
isolated in separate disciplines and taught without
demonstrating its relevance to man's existence,
Hurd maintained. A student's chances to become
involved in environmental improvement have been
limited "by an education that is too specialized."
Unsolved Dilemmas
Hurd points to several dilemmas which the
segmented approach to education has not yet been
able to solve. Among the most important, he feels,
are the pollutants—aesthetic, audio and chemical.
Hurd blames most problems on carelessness and
ignorance rampant during a "cultural mutation in
the Forty's. There was a great wave of progress in
atomic energy, medicine, communications. But
eddies of people were left behind because they
lacked education. Now we're caught short."
To meet these problems, Hurd recommends
government regulation to stave off crises, and
long-term education. He feels the climate is right to
develop sound ecological programs.
"Politicians are aware that its gone far enough,"
Hurd said, pointing to 31 bills introduced in
Congress. "And scientists have the basic knowledge
to solve these problems. This ability is becoming
combined with a new social awareness.
"I think we're over the hump. We've got an
awareness of the problem that we didn't have even
during the Dustbowl days."

Last week The Daily featured engineer „and
Presidential advisor Rolf Eliasen in the first of a
series on Stanford ecologists. Today geneticist
Joshue Lederberg and education professor Paul
Hurd explain to Daily reporter Margie Wolf their
hopes and concerns for the environment.

Hurd is encouraged by interdisciplinary
approaches to environmental control being
developed in more than 25 universities.
He praised the multi-disciplinary approach taken
by Stanford's new human biology curriculum,
which "no one would have done ten years ago."
Under a $1,936,000 Ford Foundatin grant, the
program will experimentally combine medical,
biological and behavioral sciences.
But secondary schools are also being reformed. A
high school and college biology teacher for 20 years,
Hyrd is developing new ecological curriculum for
secondary schools under a Shell Co. Foundation
grant.
Feed The Dog
"Basic feed the dog to keep him healthy"
principles can be taught in primary school, he
explained. But the middle school level—ages 12
through 14—is "psychologically a good time to fit
ecological principles in a social and political
context. This is the first time a child begins to take
much interest in other people and the world."
Hurd is now concentrating on high school study
programs designed for more advanced study of
complex environmental problems.
"We have to have both political and educational
action," Hurd concluded. "We have to develop a
supportive population which understands ecological
and social principles, We can never have enough
informed citizens."
The biologist-educator suggested he was really
only applying a 25,000 year old philosophy of
education developed when Cro-Magnon man trained
his children to throw spears at pictures of bison.
"We have to prepare the young to live successfully
in the world in which they find themselves."
