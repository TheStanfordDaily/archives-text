Geneticist Joshua Lederberg discusses
environmental problems methodically,
' thoughtfully. He considers the
psychological and political as well as the
i scientific side of ecology.
i Although encouraged by growing
( public awareness at environmental
) dangers, Lederberg is anxious to avoid
) panic.
( "There is much public arousal today,"
( the balding Nobel Laureate noted, "but
) much of it is now well informed. These
) are very subtle and complicated issues.
( Environmental hazards must be conveyed

in the context that life is full of hazards
which we attack one at a time."
One of the primary targets of
Lederberg's thorough scrutiny is food
additives, like cyclamate—crucial
"because they go directly into us."
Related classes of goods, like hairspray
and deodorant, share qualities of direct
entry when inhaled.
Questions of Control
Food additives present questions which
plague all environmental control—how
much advanced regulation of new
products should there be? Who should
bear the burden of proving their safety?
How much centralized regulation is
necessary?
Lederberg proposes strict controls
which do victimize industry.
"Any innovation that introduces new
material on a broad scale should carry the
burden of proof on the sponsor,"
Lederberg asserted. Products like food
additives,he added, should get the closest
scrutiny before they are marketed.
Some standardized tests may be
devised for new products, "but the
effects of individual differences and
interaction with different environments
make these things difficult to test," he
admitted. "We need to have a very dynamic
approach with information widely
available for all to work with."
Reasonable Regulations
"Industry will cooperate if reasonable
regulations are applied across the board
from the beginning," Lederberg
predicted. But one business will resist
being put at an economic disadvantage or
"changing the rules in the middle of the
game.
"We can't take a vindictive attitude,"
he warned. "We want industry on our
side. They shouldn't have to bear the
entire brunt of cleaning up."
For some cases "where we can't afford
not to make retrospective decisions,"
Lederberg proposes a simple cost sharing
plan.

The government would buy
condemned stocks, like dried fruit with
cyclamate added, or pay for cleaning up
pollution prone industries.
This would pass the true cost of
environmental quality to all citizens. "I
don't positively advocate this in all
circumstances," Lederberg continued,
"but I don't condemn it out of hand.
For the first time, he believes the
public understands the need for central
regulation in certain circumstances.
One likely candidate for such control is
gasoline. Each year 400 million pounds of
lead from fuel additives is spewed into
the air.
Lead Chronic Poison
Lead is a chronic poison, as
demonstrated by children's deaths caused
by eating lead-based paint from slum
walls. Coinciding with the rise in urban
air pollution, lead level in blood in urban
areas has risen to twice that in rural areas.
"Unlike smoking, which primarily
harms only yourself, using gasoline with
lead additives may harm ten million
people," he explained. "Yet you can't
buy gas without lead additives. Therefore,
the only way to solve the problem is
through central regulation. There is an
understanding about this point and we'll
accept these restrictions."
Lederberg also hopes to cure
environmental ills by training doctors. "I
expect an interdisciplinary program very
soon which will emphasize the
environmental side rather than the
patient side of ecological problems. I'd
like to see the School of Medicine
enlarged to train doctors for examining
and correcting the environment."
Ultimately, Lederberg suggests
environmental control might heal social
as well as ecological problems. "It's not a
class or partisan issue," he remarked.
"And it can become a symbolic issue for
developing social unity. As Heilbroner
says, we can perhaps restore social
cohesion."

much advanced regulation of new
products should there be? Who should

How much centralized regulation is
necessary?
Lederberg proposes strict controls
which do victimize industry.
"Any innovation that introduces new
material on a broad scale should carry the
burden of proof on the sponsor,"
Lederberg asserted. Products like food
additives,he added, should get the closest
scrutiny before they are marketed.
Some standardized tests may be
devised for new products, "but the
effects of individual differences and
interaction with different environments
make these things difficult to test," he
admitted. "We need to have a very dynamic
approach with information widely
available for all to work with."
Reasonable Regulations
"Industry will cooperate if reasonable
regulations are applied across the board
from the beginning," Lederberg
predicted. But one business will resist
being put at an economic disadvantage or
"changing the rules in the middle of the
game.
"We can't take a vindictive attitude,"
he warned. "We want industry on our
side. They shouldn't have to bear the
entire brunt of cleaning up."
For some cases "where we can't afford
not to make retrospective decisions,"
Lederberg proposes a simple cost sharing
plan.

The government would buy
condemned stocks, like dried fruit with
cyclamate added, or pay for cleaning up
pollution prone industries.
This would pass the true cost of
environmental quality to all citizens. "I
don't positively advocate this in all
circumstances," Lederberg continued,
"but I don't condemn it out of hand.
For the first time, he believes the
public understands the need for central
regulation in certain circumstances.
One likely candidate for such control is
gasoline. Each year 400 million pounds of
lead from fuel additives is spewed into
the air.
Lead Chronic Poison
Lead is a chronic poison, as
demonstrated by children's deaths caused
by eating lead-based paint from slum
walls. Coinciding with the rise in urban
air pollution, lead level in blood in urban
areas has risen to twice that in rural areas.
"Unlike smoking, which primarily
harms only yourself, using gasoline with
lead additives may harm ten million
people," he explained. "Yet you can't
buy gas without lead additives. Therefore,
the only way to solve the problem is
through central regulation. There is an
understanding about this point and we'll
accept these restrictions."
Lederberg also hopes to cure
environmental ills by training doctors. "I
expect an interdisciplinary program very
soon which will emphasize the
environmental side rather than the
patient side of ecological problems. I'd
like to see the School of Medicine
enlarged to train doctors for examining
and correcting the environment."
Ultimately, Lederberg suggests
environmental control might heal social
as well as ecological problems. "It's not a
class or partisan issue," he remarked.
"And it can become a symbolic issue for
developing social unity. As Heilbroner
says, we can perhaps restore social
cohesion."
