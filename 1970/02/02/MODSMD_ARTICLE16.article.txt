# This Week's Films
## Sternberg, Corman On Tap 
### TODD McCarthy 
Highlighting this week's film
schedule are two pictures by Josef
von Sternberg and distinguished
efforts by Georges Franju,
Vittorio DeSica, John Ford and
Stanford graduate Roger Corman.
Showing tonight in Cubberley
at 7t, 9 and 11 is a selection of the
best films made recently by
Stanford film makers. Several of
the shorts are quite good and the
program merits your attention.
All of us in Geology 320 last
Tuesday night were disappointed
when we learned that "Shanghai
Express" had not arrived but the
print is now in Clive Miller's
loving hands and I'm sure that
there's very little that could
prevent him from showing it this
Tuesday. Unless there's an
earthquake or a ban imposed on
movies by Spiro Agnew, Josef von
Sternberg's masterpiece will be
shown first, at 8 p.m. Following
will be "Theodore Goes Wild," a
19136 comedy with Irene Dunne
and Melvyn Douglas, and musical
excerpts from "Born to Dance,"
with Eleanor Powell and James
Stewart.
Von Sternberg's "The Scarlet
Empress" was made in 1934, two
years after "Shanghai Express."
While "Empress" is a bit more
ridiculous and a shade less sublime
than "Express," anyone who
enjoys Tuesday's film would do
well to see this Thursday's
International Association film,
with Marlene Dietrick as the
ultimate Catherine the Great. In
Cubberley at 7:45.
Film by Ex-Dailyite
During a discussion I had with
him last year, Roger Corman
revealed that he had served time
as film critic for the Stanford
Daily back in the late forties.
Whether I go on to make a series
of Edgar Alan Poe horror films
and 1980-style "Wild Angels" and

"The Trip" seems a dubious
proposition at best, but the least
that can be said of Corman is that
he knows what's happening, at
least commercially. "The Masque
of the Red Death" is generally
considered to be his most
significant artistic achievement,
for on his low budget, he does
rather spectacular things with
color and lighting. And it's fun.
Vincent Price, Jane Asher and
Patrick Magee prowl through
Tresidder's Friday film which will
be screened at 7, 8 and 9.
"The Bicycle Thief" (along
with Rossellini's "Open City")
was the most prominent film in
the entire Italian neo-realist
movement. In this string, stark
film dealing with the essential
problems of a common worker,
director Vittorio DeSica drew
remarkable performances from
largely non-professional actors.
This landmark picture will be
shown on Friday in Cubberley at
7 and 9:30.
Georges Franju's short, "The
Blood of the Beasts," is a very
shocking film but is so brilliantly
conceived that it immediately
gave the director an international
reputation back in 1949. This is
"The Wild Bunch" only the real
thing and may even encourage
you to vegetarianism, at least
temporarily. Other films showing
at the underground series on
Friday at 11 in Geology 320 are
Kenneth Anger's "Eaux d'Artifice
+ Invocation of My Demon
Brother," Hindle's "Billibong,"
Brakhage's "Desistfilm," Baillie's
''Tung,'' Erno Metzner's
"Ãœberi'all," and "On the Edge."
Character Actors Star
"The Last Hurrah" is a
touching story of an aging
politician running in his last

election. Director John Ford and
Spencer Tracy seem particularly
close to the project and the film's
slight over-length is more than
compensated for by one of the
most fabulous arrays of character
actors ever assembled in a single
picture. At Rinconada dining hall
on Friday at 11.
Despite an interesting premise
and occasionally compelling
execution, Joseph Losey's "King
and Country" ultimately becomes
depressingly dreary and remains
too consistently intense for its
own good. Dirk Bogarde, Tom
Courteney and Leo McKern do
what they can. At Tresiddder on
Saturday at 7, 8 and 9.
The third film in the New Line
Cinema series presented by ASSU
is "Vali, the Witch of Positano."
Vali is a mysterious woman,
allegedly the possessor of magical
powers, who lives in isolation in
Italy with her husband and lots of
animals. This documentary study
of her will be shown in
Dinkelspiel on Saturday with the
shorts "Brummers," "Image" and
"Flora."
"Kumonosujo" is director
Akira Kurosawa's unusual version
of Shakespear's "Macbeth." Filled
with brilliant camera work, the
film depicts a power-hungry war
lord in 16th century Japan. In
Cubberley on Saturday at 7:30
and 1 0.
''Even with the recent relaxed
cinematic sexual standards, they
couldn't do much with "Candy"
except make it into a rotten
movie. John Astin comes off far
better than anyone else in the
picture and the cameos range
from engaging (Richard Burton,
Walter Matthau) to dreadful
(Ringo Starr, Charles Aznavour).
