# 'They Sure Can Play'
## The 						Band Triumphs Again 
### DAVID WEIL 
I'll be down to get you in a
taxi honey
Better be ready by half past
eight
Now honey don't be late
I want to be there
When The Band starts playing.
Saturday night and The Band
was back. As they stode on stage
at the Berkeley Community
Theater the packed crowd gave
them a louder ovation than most
groups ever hear at the end of
their sets. Christ. . .The Band!
They were a success before ever
playing a note.
Garth Hudson, burly and
bearded, at the organ; dressed in
pink and purple, Richard Manuel
on Piano; Helm behind the
drums; Rich Danko up front on
bass; and Robbie Robertson,"
songwriter and lead guitarist,
looking about 35 in a light suit.
The Band.
Robertson taps his foot - two,
three, four - leads into a funky riff
and Danko wails: "If your
memory serves you well. .
Dylan's classic "This Wheel On
Fire" starts the show.

Note-for-note like their album,
The Band's music can only be
called perfect. Every sound each
member makes fits flawlessly
together to form the tightest
music around today.
The down home, country
melodies were just what the
audience was there to hear. Many
were rocking in their seats or
singing along. The applause after
each song thundered on into the
next number. People were yelling:
"Play all night." And they almost
did. After nearly two hours, The
Band had played several cuts from
their first LP, one new number
and virtually their entire second
album. For an encore they took
the Four Tops' hit "Loving You
Has Made My Life Sweeter Than
Ever" and made it sound like it
had been written for them. The
standing ovation that followed
lasted for a long time.
Rick Danko was the only one
moving around, putting on a
show, and he looked slightly
incongruous. Thev didn't need to
put on a showâ€”their music was
their show.

Part of The Band's brilliance is
their versatility: Robertson writes
almost all the songs for the others
to sing and plays an exceptional
lead guitar; Danko does much of
the singing, while fingering a live
bass; when Helm isn't pounding
out rhythmic beats and singing,
he's handling a guitar or a
mandolin; Manuel's eerie voice
and piano work barely outshine
his drumming ability; and
Hudson, who proved himself to be
a great rock organist with his ten
minute introduction to "Chest
Fever," also sings and plays piano,
accordian, sax, slide trumpet, and
clavinette.
Nothing can accurately
describe the music or the
atmosphere that prevails when
The Band gets going, but as one
young kid hollered out: "These
guys sure can play."
