# Three Minute Spell Fatal For Ruggers
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
It was only a stretch of three
minutes, but it was all that the
BATS rugby club needed to first
forge ahead and then apply the
clincher, handing Stanford its first
defeat in four outings, 17-11.
Stanford got off to a good start
as Leon Hartvickson put them on
the board with a penalty kick
from about 30 yards out.
BATS missed two scoring
chances as a pair of free kicks
were wide to the left and short,
but the red flag went up as the
ball sailed over the cross bar on
their third attept, tying the score
at 3-3.
Hartvickson camy right back
however, and gave the lead back
to the Indians on his second
penalty kick of the day.
Then, in one of the most
well-executed plays of the
afternoon, Stanford controlled a
lineout from the right sidelines
and Jim Squeri pitched a perfect
pass to Don Bunce. Bunce shook
off a tackier before passing off to
Jim Kauffman who replyed the
ball to Jack Schulz on the wing.
Schultz passed back to Kauffman
circling behind, who kicked it
across the goal line.
Wade Killefer won a footrace
to the ball and fell on it in a

crowd for Stanford's only try of
the match. Hartvickson converted
and Stanford had an 11-3 lead at
the half.
In the opening moments of the
second half an intercepted pass
nearly cost the Indians a try. That
play was broken up by Bunce and
fullback Steward Wilson, but
BATS wasted little time
anrrowing the gap to 11-6 by
controlling a five yard scrum and
carrying across for the try. The
conversion attempt bounced off
the upright.
Then disaster struck for the
Indians. Stanford was caught with
no one back, as Wilson had come
upfield to make a play. Before
any red jerseys could get to the
elusively bouncing ball, a BATS
player had gathered it in for the
go-ahead try. The conversion
made the score 14-11, still within
reach of Stanford.
But the ensuing series spelled
the end for the Tribe as Wilson
was trapped in his own end and
hit hard. Before he could get the
kick away an alert BATS man
scooped up the ball and dove
across the goal line for the capper.
The conversion attempt was
wide right, but that was of no
consequence.
