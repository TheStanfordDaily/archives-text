Absolutely no important
people will be on hand to throw
out the first ball as Stanford's
1970 baseball season get
underway tomorrow. Coach Ray
Young's squad hosts the
Philadelphia Philly Rookies
beginning at 2 p.m. in Sunken
Diamond.
The game is the first of 54
scheduled for the Indians, not
including playoffs at the end of
the Pac-8 season in May. League
competition begins April 11. The
freshmen also launch their
campaign Tuesday, with a 2 p.m.

game against Gavilan Junior
College here.
In an intersquad game
Saturday the "varsity" dropped a
4-2 decision to the "JV" in a
game characterized by weak
hitting. But on the mound, Jim
Coate and freshman Dan Shaw
looked impressive. The varsity
lineup went like this : Gary
Osterhout, 2b; Hank Snider,lf;
Don Schellenberg, c; Mike Ewing,
cf; Steve Dunning, 3b; Mike
Nelson, lb; Dick Borchers, ss;and
Jack Lynn, rf. Pitching for the
varsity besides Coate were Phil
Keller and Bob Marshall.
