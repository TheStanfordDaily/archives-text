# Angelenos Do Their Thing

### DON TOLLEFSON FRED LEESON 
Within 24 hours this weekend,
Stanford's basketball team played
the only two undefeated team in
the Pac-8, and when the games
were over it was easy to see why
they both are unbeaten in league
play. USC nipped the Indians
71-68 Friday night, while UCLA
romped to a 102-84 decision on
Saturday afternoon.
The game against USC was
close from the opening tipoff. The
lead changed hands seven times l.i
the first half alone, until USC
gained a 34-31 halftime
advantage. The game remained
close all through the second half,
but the Trojans maintained a
small lead until Dennis O'Neill hit
a one and one to make it 64-63
with 1:32 left.
A basket by Claude Terry with
1:06 left gave the Indians a 66-64
lead and when Stanford got the
ball back with less than a minute
left, the victory looked close. But
USC guard Paul Westphal stole the
ball and converted a three point
play for a 67-66 Trojan lead.
Chuck Moore put the Indians
back out ahead again at 68-67 on
a one and one with 32 seconds
left. But USC came down and
George Watson hit the winning
hoop on a rebound with 22
seconds left. The Indians couldn't
get off a good shot and Westphal
hit two free throws with one
second left for the 71-68 final
score.
So for the sixth time in 16
games Stanford had gone down to
defeat by five points or less.
Stanford's shooting percentage
of 37% (26 of 63), much below
their usual 47%, but the Indians
outrebounded the taller Trojans
56-47. O'Neill and Terry led the
Tribe with 22 and 18 points.
Moore turned in another fine
performance with 17 points and
11 rebounds. USC Coach Bob
Boyd said: "Moore has developed
into one of the better players on
the Coast." Boyd's team was led
by their guards Westphal and
Dennis Lay ton who picked up 18
and 16 points.
Saturday afternoon, in a
regionally televised game, the
number one ranked UCLA Bruins
came to town. Stanford shot well
and stayed close until the final
eight minutes of the first half.
Down by only two at 28-26, the
Indians finally got rattled by the
tough Bruin press and were
outscored 27-13 for the rest of
the half. Stanford played better in
the second half, but they never
could get closer than 12 points.
UCLA, using a fast-breaking
run and shoot offense, showed the
balanced scoring which has
characterized their play all year.
Forward Sid Wicks led the Bruins
with 27 points and 19 rebounds.
Henry Bibby and Curtis Rowe
added 23 and 21.

All Stanford starters were in
double figures led by O'Neill with
19. Center Bill Palmer added 15
points and eight rebounds to share
high rebounding honors with
forwards Fred Green and Chuck
Moore. UCLA's 102 point
performance set a new pavilion
scoring record.
The Stanford Frosh split a pair

of games this weekend to run
their record to 7-2. Friday night
the freshmen crushed a seven man
San Francisco State team 80-42.
Pat Stevens led the Tribe with 21
points and 16 rebounds while
John Stratton added 20. Saturday
afternoon the Indians lost a close
three point decision to a physical
Santa Clara Frosh team.

The steel dressing room door
killed the band racket outside,
and the silence inside was
undisturbed, save for Bill Palmer's
directionless mutter, "We
had 'em."
Down one point with 22
seconds left, the Indians somehow
had not gotten off a final shot,
and had lost to USC by that single
point, later upper to three when a
referee whistled a foul after the
buzzer.
Coach Howie Dallmar, coat off
and puffing steadily on a
cigarette, walked back and forth
in the silent room, slowly erased
the chalkboard decorated with
defenses, and paced a bit more.
Then he went to a large lounge
down the hall and answered
questions.
"I really thought we played a
good game. We have to rely on
perimeter shooting, and you have
to hit more perimeter shots
against a team like this. We
seldom run into an outfit with
such bench strength . . . USC's in
a real position to apply pressure
with that bench."
With 22 seconds and the ball,
Dennis O'Neill probed the
perimeter, couldn't find an
opening, and Claude Terry took
over with five seconds left.
He drove the baseline, ran into
traffic, and was forced out of
bounds with one second
remaining. Thus the Trojans,
ahead by eight at one point and
down by one a couple times in the
final minutes, escaped with their
perfect league record.
"O'Neill and Terry aren't going
to get pressured much tougher
than that," Dallmar noted,
referring to the defense of Dennis
Liiyton and Paul Westphal.
"This team's never stopped,"
he said, peering into his coffee.
"Losses, adverse conditions,
they've always come back."
"And in another 16 hours,
UCLA."
Stanford attained a ragged
respectibility against the Bruins,
not losing as badly as many teams
have; neither side was really sharp.
Coach John Wooden, who
looked like a quiet distant relative
at a wedding as he trundled off to
a television interview, has
apparently put together his sixth
national champion in seven years,
using his favorite formula of press
and run.
There seemed to be no sadness
in losing to the Bruins who are,
after all, number one. When
you're 4-12, it's the one that got
away that sticks in the memory.
