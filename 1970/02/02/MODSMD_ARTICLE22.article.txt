# Bears Swim Well, But Lose Upset Bid
## 
### STEVEN LACHOWICZ 
Tribe swimmers had a surprise
in store for them Saturday at
Berkeley. In a secluded woodsy
spot called Strawberry Canyon
Recreation Area, Cal put together
its finest performance of the
season and almost defeated
Stanford.
Led by freestylers Peter
Schnugg and Paul Nolan, the
Bears won both relays and two
other events to come within 12
points of the Indians, 62'/2-50 l / 2.
Mike Williams also helped out
Cal by winning one event, tying
one, and swimming on the
winning medley relay team.
In one of the more outstanding
events of the day, all four places
in the 200 freestyle were awarded
on judges decisions. First
Stanford's Bert Mason was
declared the winner but 20
minutes later the correction was
made and Williams was given a
share of the title. Ray Collins and
Cal's Schnugg tied for third. The
winning time was 1:50.8
All the times were slow as the
pool was a little choppy and it
was cold outside. The Stanford
team was also slowed by the fact
that they had worked solidly
through Friday.
Aside from the conditions,
Indian coach Jim Guaghran
complimented the Cal team for a
fine effort. "Many of their times
were season bests, and the whole
team swam very well."
The 1000 freestyle proved to
be quite a race also. Stanford's
Tim Broderick, Brent Berk and
Mark Shelley habbled for the top
spot. Berk grabbed the early lead
with Shelley right behind.
Freshman Broderick relaxed until
the 400 yd. mark. There he passed
Shelley. He went on to catch Berk
at the 700 yd. mark and hold on
to win in his best time of the
season, 1 0:05.1.

Unfortunately, Broderick and
the rest of the frosh will not be
able to swim next -veek against
Yale. It's a condition Yale insisted
on because they, unlike the Pac-8
teams, don't use their freshmen in
dual meet competition.
The rest of the afternoon went
pretty much a expected, except
for Nolan's upsetting Stanford's
Bob Jamison in the 50 free.
Jamison came back to avenge his
defeat by downing Nolan in the
100 with a time of 48.4. Cal also
swept the 200 butterfly as
Stanford's John Ferris did not
swim. The Bears' Williams swam a
2:01.2 to win it.
Divers Ted Nichols and Bill
Main took top honors in both the
one and three meter board events, j
Nichols winning the three meter
and Main the one meter.
In the 500 free, the Tribe's
Shelley seemed inclined to swim a
50 instead as he sprinted out in
the first lap. He did slow down
and beat Cal's Tim Musch with a
time of 4:57.6.
Rounding out the other
Stanford victories, Fred Haywood
swam a 2:01.8 in the 200
backstroke, and Dave Shilling
captured firsts in the 200
individual medley and the 200
breaststroke.
The junior-varsity competition
was tied 51-51 going into the last
relay. Stanford's Bob Warren, a
frosh, had a slight lead going into
his anchor leg, and he managed to
keep it to salvage a come from
behind victory.
Next week, of course, the Ivy
League visits Encina Pool. The
Yale team will be peaked and
shaved down, since this is the
biggest meet of the year for them.
Coach Gaughran says it could go
either way. The team will work
hard on Monday and Tuesday,
then ease off for the meet. The
Tribe is out to avenge last year's
defeat, but it will be an uphill
battle.

winning medley relay team.
In one of the more outstanding
events of the day, all four places
in the 200 freestyle were awarded
on judges decisions. First
Stanford's Bert Mason was
declared the winner but 20
minutes later the correction was
made and Williams was given a
share of the title. Ray Collins and
Cal's Schnugg tied for third. The
winning time was 1:50.8
All the times were slow as the
pool was a little choppy and it
was cold outside. The Stanford
team was also slowed by the fact
that they had worked solidly
through Friday.
Aside from the conditions,
Indian coach Jim Guaghran
complimented the Cal team for a
fine effort. "Many of their times
were season bests, and the whole
team swam very well."
The 1000 freestyle proved to
be quite a race also. Stanford's
Tim Broderick, Brent Berk and
Mark Shelley habbled for the top
spot. Berk grabbed the early lead
with Shelley right behind.
Freshman Broderick relaxed until
the 400 yd. mark. There he passed
Shelley. He went on to catch Berk
at the 700 yd. mark and hold on
to win in his best time of the
season, 1 0:05.1.

Unfortunately, Broderick and
the rest of the frosh will not be
able to swim next -veek against
Yale. It's a condition Yale insisted
on because they, unlike the Pac-8
teams, don't use their freshmen in
dual meet competition.
The rest of the afternoon went
pretty much a expected, except
for Nolan's upsetting Stanford's
Bob Jamison in the 50 free.
Jamison came back to avenge his
defeat by downing Nolan in the
100 with a time of 48.4. Cal also
swept the 200 butterfly as
Stanford's John Ferris did not
swim. The Bears' Williams swam a
2:01.2 to win it.
Divers Ted Nichols and Bill
Main took top honors in both the
one and three meter board events, j
Nichols winning the three meter
and Main the one meter.
In the 500 free, the Tribe's
Shelley seemed inclined to swim a
50 instead as he sprinted out in
the first lap. He did slow down
and beat Cal's Tim Musch with a
time of 4:57.6.
Rounding out the other
Stanford victories, Fred Haywood
swam a 2:01.8 in the 200
backstroke, and Dave Shilling
captured firsts in the 200
individual medley and the 200
breaststroke.
The junior-varsity competition
was tied 51-51 going into the last
relay. Stanford's Bob Warren, a
frosh, had a slight lead going into
his anchor leg, and he managed to
keep it to salvage a come from
behind victory.
Next week, of course, the Ivy
League visits Encina Pool. The
Yale team will be peaked and
shaved down, since this is the
biggest meet of the year for them.
Coach Gaughran says it could go
either way. The team will work
hard on Monday and Tuesday,
then ease off for the meet. The
Tribe is out to avenge last year's
defeat, but it will be an uphill
battle.
Tribe swimmers had a surprise
in store for them Saturday at
Berkeley. In a secluded woodsy
spot called Strawberry Canyon
Recreation Area, Cal put together
its finest performance of the
season and almost defeated
Stanford.
Led by freestylers Peter
Schnugg and Paul Nolan, the
Bears won both relays and two
other events to come within 12
points of the Indians, 62'/2-50 l / 2.
Mike Williams also helped out
Cal by winning one event, tying
one, and swimming on the
winning medley relay team.
