# Prominent Foes Clash
## Gun Control Debate Set 
### 
Ity DON TOLLEFSON
A debate on gun control
between nationally known key
figures in the gun-control
controversy will be held today at
4:15 in the large lounge of
Tresidder.
The debate will be held
between David J. Steinberg,
executive director of the National
Council for the Responsible
Firearms Policy, and Herbert C.
Kohlwes, chairman of the board
of the United Sportsmen of San
Mateo County. The Political
Union and the Stanford Law
Forum are sponsoring the
presentation.
Kohlwes is a San Francisco
attorney who fought the San
Francisco gun licensing ordinance
to the State Supreme Court. The
United Sportsmen of San Mateo
County is an affiliate of the
National Rifle Association, the

main anti-gun control lobby in the
nation. The NRA, along with its
affiliate lobbies, have been
successful in opposing effective
Congressional action on gun
control. The NRA has prevented
all legislation except the Gun
Control Act of 1968 which
regulated the interstate and mail
order sale of guns.
Steinberg is chief economist
and secretary to the Committee
for the National Trade Policy. He
has been a consultant to the
United Nations and many
government agencies and is the
author of many publications on
aspects of world trade and
international economics.
Steinberg holds degrees from the
University of Vermont and the
Harvard Graduate School.
The National Council for a
Responsible Firearms Policy
(NCRFP) was established in 1967.

Its expressed purpose is to help
focus attention of the "need for
firearms policies that efiectively
serve the total national interest."
License tiuns
The objectives of the NCRFP
consist mainly of the registration
and licensing of guns and the
dissemination of information on
the gun control issue. They have
proposed federal minimum
standards of licensing and
registration which would "limit
the legal possession of guns to
those who can meet basic
qualifications for responsible gun
ownership, and which would hold
each legitimate gun owner strictly
and legally responsible for every
gun in his possession." In an
effort to gain support for such
legislation the Council has
compiled existing information and
researched new information
concerning facts on firearms and
their use.
Among the members of the
Council's Board of Directors are
John Lindsay, Karl Menninger,
and Adlai Stevenson 111.
Among the programs of the
NCRFP is a student program
called Students for a Responsible
Firearms Policy. The National
Chairman of the group is Selig D.
Sacks, a Stanford law student and
1969 graduate of Northwestern
University. Although the
organization is young, Sacks
claims they have active chapters
on many college campuses
including Northwestern, Illinois,
and Brown. These college chapters
bring speakers and distribute
information on gun control.
Although Stanford does not

have an official chapter, Sacks
says there are about twenty
people on campus involved in the
student program. When asked
about future plans here at
Stanford, Sacks said, "Rather
than form an official chapter we
will probably work within existing
organizations such as the ASSU in
an effort to gain support for our
group."
While Steinberg is on campus,
he will make two other speeches.
Today at noon he will address the
Stanford Law School in Room
161-J. Tomorrow he is scheduled
to address the Stanford Graduate
School of Business in Bishop
Auditorium on "Free Trade in the
Year 2000. "
The debate this afternoon is
free and open to the public.

effort to gain support for such
legislation the Council has
compiled existing information and
researched new information
concerning facts on firearms and
their use.
Among the members of the
Council's Board of Directors are
John Lindsay, Karl Menninger,
and Adlai Stevenson 111.
Among the programs of the
NCRFP is a student program
called Students for a Responsible
Firearms Policy. The National
Chairman of the group is Selig D.
Sacks, a Stanford law student and
1969 graduate of Northwestern
University. Although the
organization is young, Sacks
claims they have active chapters
on many college campuses
including Northwestern, Illinois,
and Brown. These college chapters
bring speakers and distribute
information on gun control.
Although Stanford does not

have an official chapter, Sacks
says there are about twenty
people on campus involved in the
student program. When asked
about future plans here at
Stanford, Sacks said, "Rather
than form an official chapter we
will probably work within existing
organizations such as the ASSU in
an effort to gain support for our
group."
While Steinberg is on campus,
he will make two other speeches.
Today at noon he will address the
Stanford Law School in Room
161-J. Tomorrow he is scheduled
to address the Stanford Graduate
School of Business in Bishop
Auditorium on "Free Trade in the
Year 2000. "
The debate this afternoon is
free and open to the public.

David J. Steinberg, executive director
ol the National Council for a

debate gun-control legislation this
afternoon at 4:15 in the large lounge
of TMU.

A debate on gun control
between nationally known key
figures in the gun-control
controversy will be held today at
4:15 in the large lounge of
Tresidder.
The debate will be held
between David J. Steinberg,
executive director of the National
Council for the Responsible
Firearms Policy, and Herbert C.
Kohlwes, chairman of the board
of the United Sportsmen of San
Mateo County. The Political
Union and the Stanford Law
Forum are sponsoring the
presentation.
Kohlwes is a San Francisco
attorney who fought the San
Francisco gun licensing ordinance
to the State Supreme Court. The
United Sportsmen of San Mateo
County is an affiliate of the
National Rifle Association, the

main anti-gun control lobby in the
nation. The NRA, along with its
affiliate lobbies, have been
successful in opposing effective
Congressional action on gun
control. The NRA has prevented
all legislation except the Gun
Control Act of 1968 which
regulated the interstate and mail
order sale of guns.
Steinberg is chief economist
and secretary to the Committee
for the National Trade Policy. He
has been a consultant to the
United Nations and many
government agencies and is the
author of many publications on
aspects of world trade and
international economics.
Steinberg holds degrees from the
University of Vermont and the
Harvard Graduate School.
The National Council for a
Responsible Firearms Policy
(NCRFP) was established in 1967.

Its expressed purpose is to help
focus attention of the "need for
firearms policies that efiectively
serve the total national interest."
License tiuns
The objectives of the NCRFP
consist mainly of the registration
and licensing of guns and the
dissemination of information on
the gun control issue. They have
proposed federal minimum
standards of licensing and
registration which would "limit
the legal possession of guns to
those who can meet basic
qualifications for responsible gun
ownership, and which would hold
each legitimate gun owner strictly
and legally responsible for every
gun in his possession." In an
effort to gain support for such
legislation the Council has
compiled existing information and
researched new information
concerning facts on firearms and
their use.
