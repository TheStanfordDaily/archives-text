# Blasts ROTC, G.E.

Two resolutions were passed at

of the Stanford Student
Mobilization Committee. One
declared SMC's support of the
New Moratorium's efforts to force
ROTC off campus; the other, in
effect, declared SMC's support of
the GE strikers and demanded
that the university end its
complicity with General Electric.
The purpose of the meeting, as
stated by one of the group's
coordinators, was to "consider
several concrete proposals for
anti-war activities, choose our
focus of effort from among those
suggested, and then concentrate
on action."
Plans to build the SMC national

student anti-war conference,
scheduled for February 13
through 15 in Cleveland, Ohio,
were also discussed.

passed:
