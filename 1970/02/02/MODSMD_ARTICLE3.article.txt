## Pot Sentences Vary Sharply 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP)-California
judges vary sharply in toughness
when sentencing first-time
marijuana law offenders, a special
statewide survey showed Sunday.
The report revealed that the
severity of a sentence for
possessing marijuana is largely
determined by where you live.
The figures were prepared by
the State Bureau of Criminal
Statistics for Assemblyman Alan
Sieroty, D-Beverly Hills.
When the legislature starts its
second month on Monday,
Sieroty plans to introduce
legislation to cut the penalty for
possession of marijuana to a
misdemeanor with a maximum
sentence of 90 days in county jail.
At present, possessing
marijuana in California is a felony
which carries a sentence of from
one to 10 years in state
prison—although on first offences,
a judge has the power to levy a
misdemeanor penalty, which
carries a maximum of one year in
county jail.
Sieroty noted that his bill is
backed by the California
Parent-Teacher Association and
California Public Health League,
and is similar to an eased federal
law on marijuana backed by
President Nixon and recently
passed by the U.S. Senate.
He added that present
marijuana laws "are alienating
many young people and causing
them to have disrespect for the
law—much as prohibition laws did
a generation ago."

seriously considering it, largely
because of side effects.
Publicity generated by last
month's Senate subcommittee
hearings on passible hazards of the
pill was given as the prime reason
by about one-third of those who
had quit or were thinking about
it, the magazine said Sunday.
About one-fourth said they
were worried because of actual
side effects experienced by
themselves or friends.

A small number gave no
particular reason. The magazine
did not say how many had given
up the pill in order to have
children.
The poll was based on
telephone interviews of 895
women between 21 and 45.
About one-fourth of them said
they had used the pill within the
past three months, and they were
questioned further about whether
they had quit since.
