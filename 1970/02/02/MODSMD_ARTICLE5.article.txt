# Car Takes Unexpected Dip
## 
### 
Roderick Calkins, a senior at
Stanford, launched his sailboat in
Lake Lagunita Friday evening.
And his car. And his trailer.
According to Stanford Police,
Calkins was launching his craft
when his red Chevrolet, with
trailer attached, began to roll
down the hill next to the
boathouse toward the water.

By the time Calkins got inside
the car and set the emergency
brake, the car was floating in the
water. It floated several minutes
before sinking in about seven feet
of muddy water.
Crews from four wreckers
worked for about an hour to
retrieve the car. A driver from the
Wasmuth Garage wrecker took an

unplanned evening swim to attach
cables to the sunken vehicle.
The car glistening under the
spotlights, was full of water and
the crowd that had gathered
began to speculate as to whether
it would start or not. It didn't.
No damage estimate was
available and there were no
injuries.
