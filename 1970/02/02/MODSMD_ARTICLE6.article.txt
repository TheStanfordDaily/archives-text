# ASSU Spending Finally Approved
## 
### DAVE BRENNER 
After almost a year of
controversy and conflict, the
ASSU Senate approved the
1969-70 budget in a Saturday
morning meeting marked by
constant haggling over procedure
and budget cuts. The budget had
been under consideration since
last spring, when LASSU was
unable to finish it before the
quarter's end partly because
attendance dropped when
meetings called during dead week
and finals. This year's Senate got a
late start and has been plagued by
lengthy debate on many budget
requests.
The Senate had approved
budgets for all organizations
except itself when Saturday's
meeting began. The purpose was
to trim previous allotments to
outside groups by $7,050.35 in
order to balance the budget. The

total income for this year is
$1 45,600, while outlays are
expected to go over $1 50,000.
Some Senators, led by John
Shoch, proposed that the budgets
of individual organizations be
reevaluated so that cuts could be
made. The majority was opposed,
since previous allotments had
been made after discussion of the
uses each group had for the
money it requested Eventually,
$'2,050 was drawn from MECHA,
BSU, Professor's Commissio, the
Speech Association, and the
International Association and
$5,000 from reserves.
The meeting was significant
not only because it completed a
task begun last spring, but because
it marked the end of the Senate
coalition between the white
radicals and blacks.
Strange Bedfellows
The tone of the discussion was
set very early when vice-chairman
John Shoch said, "I don't have a
ticket for the railroad that is
trying to run through here." He
was referring to some rather
strange bedfellows, the blacks and
the conservatives, who voted
together on most major issues
Saturday.
According to the radicals, this
resulted from the Roger Reed
affair. They contend that the
blacks offered to absolve Reed of
the debt, as the conservatives
wished, in return for conservative
assistance in pushing the budget
through.
Paul Witt accused the blacks of
playing power politics and making
alliances with anyone who could
help them achieve their aims. Leo
Bazile, BSU chairman, replied,
"That's right."
Final Solution
After considerable discussion,
Bazile offered the final solution,
incorporating many of the
decisions reached earlier into one
complete motion. By taking
$5000 from the ASSU reserve and
varying amounts up to $500 from
individual organizations, the
budget could be balanced. Bazile's
motion carried by a vote of 22-2,
with 5 absentions, including those
of Shoch, Witt, and Yale
Braunstein.
When it became clear that
Bazile's motion on the budget
would pass with the necessary 2/3
majority, senators began to leave,

shouting and shaking hands as
they filed out. Unknown to those
who left, however, the vote which
they understood to be on the final
budget had been interpreted by
some-Shoch among them-to bo a
vote only on the changes
proposed by Bazile, and not on
the final budget.
The radicals contend that
ASSU still does not have a budget.
They intend to bring the matter
up for another vote in hopes of
cutting more from the alloted
budgets so that less money need
be drawn from ASSU reserves,
which stand to be depleted by
almost 1/3 this year if Bazile's
motion is accepted. (According to
student financial manager David
Swift, the reserves can be reduced
by this amount without
jeopardizing the ASSU's financial
position.)
t lory Speech
When presented with the
radicals' view of the budget,
Chairman Dave Edwards was
incensed. In a heated exchange he
wagered, "I'll bet you your life
against mine that this is the final
budget."
Chairman Dave Edwards shared
Bazile's anger over the inordinate
amount of time being spent
discussing procedure. In a fiery
speech he implored the group to
"get down to discussing the big
organizations that we know are
going to have to be cut. " Shortly
thereafter he proposed that $500
be cut from the BSU budget
leaving it with $11,000.
Shoch quickly moved that an
additional $2,000 be cut from the
BSU allocation, charging that
some money was being used to
pay off last year's debts and that
expenses for the Colonist had
been greatly overestimated. He
was well armed with specific facts
and in a later interview offered
that he had similar figures for a
half dozen groups.
Paul Witt also accused Bazile of
looking out for his own
self-interest and attacked his
attitude toward the capitalist
system by saying, "You are
playing the game instead of trying
to change the name of the game."
Bazile responded by stating
that he would like to change the
game, but that his first concern
was his own people who had to
struggle for day-to-day survival

uses each group had for the
money it requested Eventually,
$'2,050 was drawn from MECHA,
BSU, Professor's Commissio, the
Speech Association, and the
International Association and
$5,000 from reserves.
The meeting was significant
not only because it completed a
task begun last spring, but because
it marked the end of the Senate
coalition between the white
radicals and blacks.
Strange Bedfellows
The tone of the discussion was
set very early when vice-chairman
John Shoch said, "I don't have a
ticket for the railroad that is
trying to run through here." He
was referring to some rather
strange bedfellows, the blacks and
the conservatives, who voted
together on most major issues
Saturday.
According to the radicals, this
resulted from the Roger Reed
affair. They contend that the
blacks offered to absolve Reed of
the debt, as the conservatives
wished, in return for conservative
assistance in pushing the budget
through.
Paul Witt accused the blacks of
playing power politics and making
alliances with anyone who could
help them achieve their aims. Leo
Bazile, BSU chairman, replied,
"That's right."
Final Solution
After considerable discussion,
Bazile offered the final solution,
incorporating many of the
decisions reached earlier into one
complete motion. By taking
$5000 from the ASSU reserve and
varying amounts up to $500 from
individual organizations, the
budget could be balanced. Bazile's
motion carried by a vote of 22-2,
with 5 absentions, including those
of Shoch, Witt, and Yale
Braunstein.
When it became clear that
Bazile's motion on the budget
would pass with the necessary 2/3
majority, senators began to leave,

shouting and shaking hands as
they filed out. Unknown to those
who left, however, the vote which
they understood to be on the final
budget had been interpreted by
some-Shoch among them-to bo a
vote only on the changes
proposed by Bazile, and not on
the final budget.
The radicals contend that
ASSU still does not have a budget.
They intend to bring the matter
up for another vote in hopes of
cutting more from the alloted
budgets so that less money need
be drawn from ASSU reserves,
which stand to be depleted by
almost 1/3 this year if Bazile's
motion is accepted. (According to
student financial manager David
Swift, the reserves can be reduced
by this amount without
jeopardizing the ASSU's financial
position.)
t lory Speech
When presented with the
radicals' view of the budget,
Chairman Dave Edwards was
incensed. In a heated exchange he
wagered, "I'll bet you your life
against mine that this is the final
budget."
Chairman Dave Edwards shared
Bazile's anger over the inordinate
amount of time being spent
discussing procedure. In a fiery
speech he implored the group to
"get down to discussing the big
organizations that we know are
going to have to be cut. " Shortly
thereafter he proposed that $500
be cut from the BSU budget
leaving it with $11,000.
Shoch quickly moved that an
additional $2,000 be cut from the
BSU allocation, charging that
some money was being used to
pay off last year's debts and that
expenses for the Colonist had
been greatly overestimated. He
was well armed with specific facts
and in a later interview offered
that he had similar figures for a
half dozen groups.
Paul Witt also accused Bazile of
looking out for his own
self-interest and attacked his
attitude toward the capitalist
system by saying, "You are
playing the game instead of trying
to change the name of the game."
Bazile responded by stating
that he would like to change the
game, but that his first concern
was his own people who had to
struggle for day-to-day survival
After almost a year of
controversy and conflict, the
ASSU Senate approved the
1969-70 budget in a Saturday
morning meeting marked by
constant haggling over procedure
and budget cuts. The budget had
been under consideration since
last spring, when LASSU was
unable to finish it before the
quarter's end partly because
attendance dropped when
meetings called during dead week
and finals. This year's Senate got a
late start and has been plagued by
lengthy debate on many budget
requests.
The Senate had approved
budgets for all organizations
except itself when Saturday's
meeting began. The purpose was
to trim previous allotments to
outside groups by $7,050.35 in
order to balance the budget. The

total income for this year is
$1 45,600, while outlays are
expected to go over $1 50,000.
Some Senators, led by John
Shoch, proposed that the budgets
of individual organizations be
reevaluated so that cuts could be
made. The majority was opposed,
since previous allotments had
been made after discussion of the
uses each group had for the

Bazile, BSU chairman, replied,
"That's right."
Final Solution
After considerable discussion,
Bazile offered the final solution,
incorporating many of the
decisions reached earlier into one
complete motion. By taking
$5000 from the ASSU reserve and
varying amounts up to $500 from
individual organizations, the
budget could be balanced. Bazile's
motion carried by a vote of 22-2,
with 5 absentions, including those
of Shoch, Witt, and Yale
Braunstein.
When it became clear that
Bazile's motion on the budget
would pass with the necessary 2/3
majority, senators began to leave,

shouting and shaking hands as
they filed out. Unknown to those
who left, however, the vote which
they understood to be on the final
budget had been interpreted by
some-Shoch among them-to bo a
vote only on the changes
proposed by Bazile, and not on
the final budget.
The radicals contend that
ASSU still does not have a budget.
They intend to bring the matter
up for another vote in hopes of
cutting more from the alloted
budgets so that less money need
be drawn from ASSU reserves,
which stand to be depleted by
almost 1/3 this year if Bazile's
motion is accepted. (According to
student financial manager David
Swift, the reserves can be reduced
by this amount without
jeopardizing the ASSU's financial
position.)
t lory Speech
When presented with the
radicals' view of the budget,
Chairman Dave Edwards was
incensed. In a heated exchange he
wagered, "I'll bet you your life
against mine that this is the final
budget."
Chairman Dave Edwards shared
Bazile's anger over the inordinate
amount of time being spent
discussing procedure. In a fiery
speech he implored the group to
"get down to discussing the big
organizations that we know are
going to have to be cut. " Shortly
thereafter he proposed that $500
be cut from the BSU budget
leaving it with $11,000.
Shoch quickly moved that an
additional $2,000 be cut from the
BSU allocation, charging that
some money was being used to
pay off last year's debts and that
expenses for the Colonist had
been greatly overestimated. He
was well armed with specific facts
and in a later interview offered
that he had similar figures for a
half dozen groups.
Paul Witt also accused Bazile of
looking out for his own
self-interest and attacked his
attitude toward the capitalist
system by saying, "You are
playing the game instead of trying
to change the name of the game."
Bazile responded by stating
that he would like to change the
game, but that his first concern
was his own people who had to
struggle for day-to-day survival
After almost a year of
controversy and conflict, the
ASSU Senate approved the
1969-70 budget in a Saturday
morning meeting marked by
constant haggling over procedure
and budget cuts. The budget had
been under consideration since
last spring, when LASSU was
unable to finish it before the
quarter's end partly because
attendance dropped when
meetings called during dead week
and finals. This year's Senate got a
late start and has been plagued by
lengthy debate on many budget
requests.
The Senate had approved
budgets for all organizations
except itself when Saturday's
meeting began. The purpose was
to trim previous allotments to
outside groups by $7,050.35 in
order to balance the budget. The

total income for this year is
$1 45,600, while outlays are
expected to go over $1 50,000.
Some Senators, led by John
Shoch, proposed that the budgets
of individual organizations be
reevaluated so that cuts could be
made. The majority was opposed,
since previous allotments had
been made after discussion of the
uses each group had for the
money it requested Eventually,
$'2,050 was drawn from MECHA,
BSU, Professor's Commissio, the
Speech Association, and the
International Association and
$5,000 from reserves.
The meeting was significant
not only because it completed a
task begun last spring, but because
it marked the end of the Senate
coalition between the white
radicals and blacks.
Strange Bedfellows
The tone of the discussion was
set very early when vice-chairman
John Shoch said, "I don't have a
ticket for the railroad that is
trying to run through here." He
was referring to some rather
strange bedfellows, the blacks and
the conservatives, who voted
together on most major issues
Saturday.
According to the radicals, this
resulted from the Roger Reed
affair. They contend that the
blacks offered to absolve Reed of
the debt, as the conservatives
wished, in return for conservative
assistance in pushing the budget
through.
Paul Witt accused the blacks of
playing power politics and making
alliances with anyone who could
help them achieve their aims. Leo
Bazile, BSU chairman, replied,
"That's right."
