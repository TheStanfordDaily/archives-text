# 88 Topless Women In Symbolic Scene
## Starr, Sellers Face Censorship In Latest Flick 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Bell-bottomed journalists from
the L.A. Free Press rubbed
shoulders with the bow-tied
gentry of the establishment press
in the Crystal Room of the
Beverly Hills Hotel.
All were waiting for Bungalow
no. 3 to disgorge its precious
contents, Peter Sellers and Ringo
Starr.
When the pair, co-stars of "The
Magic Christian," finally entered,
flanked by the film's director
Joseph McGrath and producer
Dennis O'Dell, animated applause
filled the room.
Ringo sported a cut waistcoat
and neckscarf. Sellers' appearance

indicated that his prolonged
contact with the well-dressed
Starr had influenced his own
dress. Sitting down together, Starr
and Sellers were subjected to a
heavy barrage of strobe lights
from the cameras of attending
photographers. When the clicking
subsided they were unable to see
out into the hall.
The questioning began. Hands
flew up as if an entire class knew
an answer and was anxious to
relate it to the teacher. A reporter
from Foothill Junior College
started the questions by asking
Starr to compare his role as
Youngman Grand to his roles in
the two Beatle films.
"They don't differ at all, in

each film I am playing a part the
same way I would act in everyday
life." Starr replied, "Things are
the same (in each film) except for
the lines-and half of them are the
same."
No Coaching
Ringo continued about his
acting career. "I've had no coach,
nobody told me anything —as you
can see if you watch the movie.
When we (the Beatles) finish
making an album and we all sort
of do our own thing, the thing I
like to do is make films. So I'll
keep doing that because I like it
and it's easy."
A reporter asked Ringo what
his future plans were and he
quipped, "Well for about the next
ten minutes this, then I'll go and
have something to eat—no, I'm
finishing an album, Standards, and
it should be out in about two
weeks here. As for me and the
group-we'll get together again but
there are no more plans."
He added that the group had
not decided if it was to play at the
Rock Revival Festival in Toronto
as rumored.
Appie's Problems
Starr spoke about recording
and related why Apple had been
having problems. "We were giving
it all away. We had it like a
foundation and people came in
and said 'I want to do this, I want
to do that,' and we said okay. We
didn't look into it and we let
them go with all the bread. We
need people to have a more
definite approach to what they're
doing. Now we're not just handing
it out to anybody, they have to
have something going for them."
Apparently connecting the idea
of Apple with finance in general, a
newswoman fired a series of
questions to Starr.
Question: "Do you have any

idea what you are worth
financially?"
Answer: "About five dollars. .
.1 have no idea you know."
Question: "And was there
anything special you did when
you first came into real money?"
Answer: "Yep, I bought three
houses and about eight cars and a
hundred cameras."
Question: "Is there anything
you want now that you don't
have?"
Answer: "Yes, I'd like to sell all
those houses."
Censorship Problems
Raquel Welch has a cameo role
in the film; she plays a slave
priestess in the rowing galley of
the S.S. Magic Christian and
presides over 88 rowers who form
the "engine room" of the ship.
Starr spoke about the censorship
problems in the film. "As a matter
of fact, t hey cut out the two most
important frames of the film-88
topless girls representing the
engine room of the ship."
Mrs. Starr's reaction to him
playing opposite Raquel Welch? a
reporter snickered, "She didn't
mind Raquel; she was dressed. It
was the rest of them that wore
naked."
Like the engine room scene, the
entire film ridicules the customs,
institutions, and morals of
modern society. Could Ringo
offer any substitutes for the
things he and Sellers knocked
down? "No, that's the point, I
couldn't change it. 1 could change
it my way but then another crowd
of people says that's not the way
either."
Seller's Role
Sellers focused more
extensively on the content and
message of the film and related his
role in writing it. "1 lent them my
typewriter, lie (Terry Southern)

was up at the Dorcester one day
and we had a couple of ideas so
we wrote them down.That's how I
was involved in the writing."
Since a film is basically a
money-making proposition the
question arose as to whether
Sellers had done the film for the
salary or because he believed in
the film's message. Sellers didn't
appear affronted at this mild hint
of hypocrisy and answered
immediately, "I'll tell you right
away, we took no money to do
the film at all. We did it because
we believed in it. We just got
expenses. So far as we are
concerned, if the film flops we
don't get any money. The great
thing about the film is that it
illustrates generally to the public
the true nature of power and
money and corruption.
"I think Terry Southern's idea
in writing this novel is to illustrate
humorously Sir Guy Grand's (the
principal character) message to
the world-that is, that anyone can
be bought There is nobody in the
world that can't be bought for
money."
Comparing Films
Sellers compared his roles in
"Doctor Strangelove" and"The
Magic Christian," seemingly
reluctant to make any direct
comparison between the films
except that each treats a serious
subject in a humorous fashion. In
"The Magic Christian," it is
money and power and corruption,
while in "Dr. Strangelove," "the
subject was the hydrogen bomb
and Stanley Kubrick treated it
humorously and satirically and
the public was able to take it in
and enjoy it and understand it."
Regarding the roles he played
in the two films Sellers noted, "I
think that it wits probably easier
to play Sir Guy Grand because I

was playing an Englishman. I used
the voice of an English eccentric
and modeled the make-up after a
young Albert Schweitzer."
It is doubtful a young Albert
Schweitzer would do some of the
things that Sir Guy Grand did
with his money to prove people
would do anything for case.
Swimming For Money
Sellers retold an episode at the
end of the film where Grand has a
tremendous vat filled with
materials imported from the
stockyards and tosses a million
dollars into it."The thing about it
is that people will swim through
shit for money. I mean it's a fact
isn't it? I mean that if you put a
million dollars in a bowl of shit,

they'd dive in. They would,
there's no doubt about it. When
this comes on a lot of people get
up and walk out; I've seen this
happen in London. It's hardly
worth saying but nevertheless, I
think people will knife you in the
back for money so they most
certainly will jump into shit.
"An interesting anecdote
regarding this was when we filmed
the scene. The extras refused to
go in until they got an extra ten
quid apiece-it looked so real."
Many feel that they see enough
people in everyday life who
"swim through shit for money,"
as Peter Sellers says. Still, it might
be funnier to see them do it in
"The Magic Christian."
