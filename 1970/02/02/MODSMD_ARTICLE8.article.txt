## 'Mormons' vs. Latter Day Saints 
### 
The continuing controversy
uver Stanford's relations with
BYU ecessitates that we clarify
a point: the anti-Negro policy of
the "Mormon" church is NOT a
legacy from Joseph Smith Jr., the
founder of the original Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
* The Church's books of faith
(Bible, Book of Mormon, and
Book of Doctrine and Covenants)
Dsed during Smith's lifetime teach
that Christ call all men unto Him
and that God is "no respecter of
persons" (i.e., He doesn't
discriminate). There was nothing
contained in them that denies
priesthood to the Negro race. In
fact, our records show that at
k'ast two Negroes, Elijah Abel and
a man named Lewis, were
ordained to the priesthood during
Joseph Smith Jr.'s lifetime.
Following the assassination of
Joseph Smith Jr. in 1844 there
was' a disagreement among those
who remained over who should
assume leadership, and Brigham
"Young led a fraction of the

Church's membership to Utah.
Other groups also survived the
breakup: the Reorganized
CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST of
Latter Day Saints, to which we
belong, was among them.
It is unfortunate that we are
not widely recognized as distince
from the "Mormons" because our
records of what Joseph Smith said
and did disagree radicallv For
example, Judge L.S. Sherman of
the Court of Common Pleas, Lake
County, Ohio, February, 1880,
decided ". . .the Reorganized
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints is a Religious Sociegy
founded and organized upon the
same doctrines and tenets and
having the same Church
organization as the original
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints organized in 1830 by
Joseph Smith. . . the Church in
Utah. . . has materially and largely
departed from the faith, doctrines
laws ordinances and usages of the
original Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter day Saints. ..."

A recent statement by W.W.
Smith, President of the
Reorganized Church and grandson
of Joseph Smith Jr., said "It
would be difficult to compile
statistics indicating either the
actual number of members or the
number of members of the
priesthood of any particular
ethnic grouping as our method or
recording does not discriminate in
this regard."
While we attended our
Church-sponsored Graceland
College, George Seda, a Negro
from Kenya, Africa, was referred
to Graceland because of our lack
of discrimination. George was
converted to the Church, joined,
and was later called and ordained
to the priesthood.
We are sorry that Graceland is
but a small college because we are
sure it would be pleased to be on
your athletic schedule.
