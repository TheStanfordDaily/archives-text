I read with disgust and
disbelief the 1 >ail > "examination"
of the Stanford Overseas
Campuses program. Generally, 1
feel the ideas expressed represent
those of the typically egotistical,
narrow-minded l> a iI > coterie
which insists on "examining" only
those points which reveal its
personal grievances. At no point
was the established student
organization, the Overseas
Campuses Board, consulted, or
even notified; moreover, the
article by Barry Askinas and
Dennis Perluss contains several
grossly unfair indictments.
The essential argument is that
the criticisms overshadowed by
the program's "tremendous
benefits build to a "cacophonour
crescendo", but are met with
antiquated inflexibility by the
home office "dictator," Dr.
Walker.
SKS Proposal
In the first place, the newly
created Academic Senate
Committee on Foreign Study
Programs represents a realization
of the SES proposal that overseas

campuses governed by five
1 acu lty-student subcommittees;
Dr. Walker is a non voting, ex
officio member.
Secondly, this year we of the
Overseas Campuses Board have
been given the sole responsibility
lor providing and maintaining the
handbooks and organizing all
non-administrative orientation
activities. Mr. Perluss himself is a
member of the Board, and
therefore has had easy access to
the means of instituting the
changes he quoted the recently
returning Italy resident assistant
as indicating.

The investigation in Vienna
used to argue that the
administration ignores the
complaints of poor food took
place two and one-half years ago
in the first group in Vienna. Since
that time, the cook has been
dismissed and conditions have
considerably improved.
I do not wish to imply,
however, that the program is
faultless; there is much room for
improvement, but such
improvement must be viewed in
the context of reality. The new
governing committee, the move
from Harlaxton to Cliveden (Miss
Price's article represents the
opinion of an unquestionable
minority), the move from the
Semmering into Vienna, and the
new residence policy are evidence
that beneficial change has and will
continue to take place.
Come on Down, Fellas
I would rather like to suggest
that those who indict the system
so vehemently might put their
pens down, descend from their
pedestals, and come to work
honestly and realistically within
the structure to affect the
necessary changes. I, for one,
would be most interested in
helping to bring about such
action.

even notified; moreover, the
article by Barry Askinas and
Dennis Perluss contains several
grossly unfair indictments.
The essential argument is that
the criticisms overshadowed by
the program's "tremendous
benefits build to a "cacophonour
crescendo", but are met with
antiquated inflexibility by the
home office "dictator," Dr.
Walker.
SKS Proposal
In the first place, the newly
created Academic Senate
Committee on Foreign Study
Programs represents a realization
of the SES proposal that overseas

campuses governed by five
1 acu lty-student subcommittees;
Dr. Walker is a non voting, ex
officio member.
Secondly, this year we of the
Overseas Campuses Board have
been given the sole responsibility
lor providing and maintaining the
handbooks and organizing all
non-administrative orientation
activities. Mr. Perluss himself is a
member of the Board, and
therefore has had easy access to
the means of instituting the
changes he quoted the recently
returning Italy resident assistant
as indicating.
Vionese Cuisine
The investigation in Vienna
used to argue that the
administration ignores the
complaints of poor food took
place two and one-half years ago
in the first group in Vienna. Since
that time, the cook has been
dismissed and conditions have
considerably improved.
I do not wish to imply,
however, that the program is
faultless; there is much room for
improvement, but such
improvement must be viewed in
the context of reality. The new
governing committee, the move
from Harlaxton to Cliveden (Miss
Price's article represents the
opinion of an unquestionable
minority), the move from the
Semmering into Vienna, and the
new residence policy are evidence
that beneficial change has and will
continue to take place.
Come on Down, Fellas
I would rather like to suggest
that those who indict the system
so vehemently might put their
pens down, descend from their
pedestals, and come to work
honestly and realistically within
the structure to affect the
necessary changes. I, for one,
would be most interested in
helping to bring about such
action.

I read with disgust and
disbelief the 1 >ail > "examination"
of the Stanford Overseas
Campuses program. Generally, 1
feel the ideas expressed represent
those of the typically egotistical,
narrow-minded l> a iI > coterie
which insists on "examining" only
those points which reveal its
personal grievances. At no point
was the established student
organization, the Overseas
Campuses Board, consulted, or
even notified; moreover, the
article by Barry Askinas and
Dennis Perluss contains several
grossly unfair indictments.
