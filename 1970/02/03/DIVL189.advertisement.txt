Today
A mere 50 years ago, the Daily Palo Alto (our illustrious
predecessor) reported on February 3 that President Wilbur
predicted the demise of the sorority house system. He
objected to the proximity of sororities on the Row to
certain fraternities. We seem to have come a long way to
President Pitzer's pill decision.
If you hear President Pitzer say anything earthshaking
please call our editorial offices x4632.
If you're the holder of any defunct sorority house lease
which you'd like to sell, call our business office at
327-4150.
