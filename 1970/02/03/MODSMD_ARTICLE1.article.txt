# ASSU To Compile Course Evaluation
## 
### JOHN ECK HOUSE 
A new student course review is
coming to Stanford.
ASSU Council of Presidents
member John Grube is presently
compiling what he hopes will be
an exhaustive course review to be
released later this quarter.
At the same time, Statistics
professor Bradley Effron,
chairman of the Provost's
Committee for Student
Evaluation of teaching hopes to
develop methods of evaluation
which will ultimately improve the
quality of teaching at Stanford.
"There is a great need existing
for course descriptions," says
Grube. "Nine times out of ten,
advisors don't know what a course
is all about—they don't have the
time to investigate in order to
properly advise students."
By providing advisors and
advisees with a detailed analysis of
each course to be offered the
following quarter, Grube hopes
that advisors might become
"educational advocates" able "to
advise on a much higher
educational level."
The forms, that will be
completed by instructors in
departments (excluding only the
School of Engineering ,)should be
particularly helpful for new
students who enter Stanford with
no previous knowledge of the
classes offered.
The evaluation will also serve
to publicize obscure courses
normally overlooked by most
students.
Questionnaire Purpose
Effron, chairman of the
Provost's committee, defined his
purpose as "developing a
questionnaire so that students can
accurately grade teacher
performance. The reason I took
the job is that I don't think
teaching is rewarded, because it
cannot be rewarded if it is not
measured."
He explained that his catalog
will not resemble student-run
"scratch-sheets" of the past.
Learning from the success of
legitimately conducted
teacher-evaluation programs at
Princeton, Michigan, and the
University of Washington, the
Provost's committee will present
quantitative results "as far as
possible."
Grube is particularly anxious
to help teachers and students, via
the student-run evaluation, avoid
the beginning-of-quarter chaos
when people sit in on eight or
nine courses for the first two
weeks, attempting to find out the
content of the course titles listed
in the Time Schedule. Grube feels
this problem can be avoided if
students will use the teacher's
course description to better
evaluate their courses during
pre-registration.
Professors are being asked to

describe the nature and treatment
of the subject matter they will
present, tell about the formal of
the course, the books to by
employed, and requirements of
the students.
Fear has been expressed that
some students will use the course
description booklet simply to find
courses with the fewest academic
requirements. Dismissing this
possibility as minor, Grube
acknowledged "until we make a
change in the educational
environment, there are always
going to be students who seek the
easy course."
Completion
The project is scheduled for
completion prior to Spring
Quarter pre-registration which
begins February 25th.
Enthusiastic about the success
of the effort, Grube noted that
''response has been
excellent —over 90% in our pilot
program conducted last quarter in
four departments."
Professor Effron is also
enthusiastic, about the potential
success of the teacher evaluation
program currently being tried by
his committee.
Testing of his questionnaire
will begin this quarter in two
selected departments, one a Social
Science and one from Humanities.
Although the program will not be
voluntary, a professor can decline
to participate.
"Excellent Cooperation"
Effron reports he has received
"excellent cooperation from
department heads, and many
individual faculty members. Our
greatest fear is not faculty (lack of
cooperation ,) but that students
won't do a good job filling the
questionnaires out."
"I think they can be very
useful if taken seriously," Effron
said. His personal goal, he said, is
to stimulate better teaching by
providing instructors with
feedback on their performance
and by rewarding good teaching
ability. Evaluation of teaching will
probably "radically change the
basis for financial promotion,"
according to Effron. "No one will
lose their job because they are a
brilliant researcher."
The present plan is to run the
evaluation process on a long-term
basis from the Provost's Office.
Although SES recommended that
student evaluation of teaching be
student-run, Effron feels "If it is
not student-run, it will be taken
more seriously: just like someone
collecting grades."
Grube hopes that the two
committees will, as time passes,
directly complement each other.
Eventually he envisions a
quarterly catalog of classes that
will include the instructor's
description of his course, followed
immediately by the most recent
student evaluation of the
instructor.

ability. Evaluation of teaching will
probably "radically change the
basis for financial promotion,"
according to Effron. "No one will
lose their job because they are a
brilliant researcher."
The present plan is to run the
evaluation process on a long-term
basis from the Provost's Office.
Although SES recommended that
student evaluation of teaching be
student-run, Effron feels "If it is
not student-run, it will be taken
more seriously: just like someone
collecting grades."
Grube hopes that the two
committees will, as time passes,
directly complement each other.
Eventually he envisions a
quarterly catalog of classes that
will include the instructor's
description of his course, followed
immediately by the most recent
student evaluation of the
instructor.
A new student course review is
coming to Stanford.
ASSU Council of Presidents
member John Grube is presently
compiling what he hopes will be
an exhaustive course review to be
released later this quarter.
At the same time, Statistics
professor Bradley Effron,
chairman of the Provost's
Committee for Student
Evaluation of teaching hopes to
develop methods of evaluation
which will ultimately improve the
quality of teaching at Stanford.
"There is a great need existing
for course descriptions," says
Grube. "Nine times out of ten,
advisors don't know what a course
is all about—they don't have the
time to investigate in order to
properly advise students."
By providing advisors and
advisees with a detailed analysis of
each course to be offered the
following quarter, Grube hopes
that advisors might become
"educational advocates" able "to
advise on a much higher
educational level."
The forms, that will be
completed by instructors in
departments (excluding only the
School of Engineering ,)should be
particularly helpful for new
students who enter Stanford with
no previous knowledge of the
classes offered.
The evaluation will also serve
to publicize obscure courses
normally overlooked by most
students.
Questionnaire Purpose
Effron, chairman of the
Provost's committee, defined his
purpose as "developing a
questionnaire so that students can
accurately grade teacher
performance. The reason I took
the job is that I don't think
teaching is rewarded, because it
cannot be rewarded if it is not
measured."
He explained that his catalog
will not resemble student-run
"scratch-sheets" of the past.
Learning from the success of
legitimately conducted
teacher-evaluation programs at
Princeton, Michigan, and the
University of Washington, the
Provost's committee will present
quantitative results "as far as
possible."
Grube is particularly anxious
to help teachers and students, via
the student-run evaluation, avoid
the beginning-of-quarter chaos
when people sit in on eight or
nine courses for the first two
weeks, attempting to find out the
content of the course titles listed
in the Time Schedule. Grube feels
this problem can be avoided if
students will use the teacher's
course description to better
evaluate their courses during
pre-registration.
Professors are being asked to

describe the nature and treatment
of the subject matter they will
present, tell about the formal of
the course, the books to by
employed, and requirements of
the students.
Fear has been expressed that
some students will use the course
description booklet simply to find
courses with the fewest academic
requirements. Dismissing this
possibility as minor, Grube
acknowledged "until we make a
change in the educational
environment, there are always
going to be students who seek the
easy course."
Completion
The project is scheduled for
completion prior to Spring
Quarter pre-registration which
begins February 25th.
Enthusiastic about the success
of the effort, Grube noted that
''response has been
excellent —over 90% in our pilot
program conducted last quarter in
four departments."
Professor Effron is also
enthusiastic, about the potential
success of the teacher evaluation
program currently being tried by
his committee.
Testing of his questionnaire
will begin this quarter in two
selected departments, one a Social
Science and one from Humanities.
Although the program will not be
voluntary, a professor can decline
to participate.
"Excellent Cooperation"
Effron reports he has received
"excellent cooperation from
department heads, and many
individual faculty members. Our
greatest fear is not faculty (lack of
cooperation ,) but that students
won't do a good job filling the
questionnaires out."
"I think they can be very
useful if taken seriously," Effron
said. His personal goal, he said, is
to stimulate better teaching by
providing instructors with
feedback on their performance
and by rewarding good teaching
ability. Evaluation of teaching will
probably "radically change the
basis for financial promotion,"
according to Effron. "No one will

success of the teacher evaluation
program currently being tried by
his committee.
Testing of his questionnaire
will begin this quarter in two
selected departments, one a Social
Science and one from Humanities.
Although the program will not be
voluntary, a professor can decline
to participate.
"Excellent Cooperation"
Effron reports he has received
"excellent cooperation from
department heads, and many
individual faculty members. Our
greatest fear is not faculty (lack of
cooperation ,) but that students
won't do a good job filling the
questionnaires out."
"I think they can be very
useful if taken seriously," Effron
said. His personal goal, he said, is
to stimulate better teaching by
providing instructors with
feedback on their performance
and by rewarding good teaching
ability. Evaluation of teaching will
probably "radically change the
basis for financial promotion,"
according to Effron. "No one will
lose their job because they are a
brilliant researcher."
The present plan is to run the
evaluation process on a long-term
basis from the Provost's Office.
Although SES recommended that
student evaluation of teaching be
student-run, Effron feels "If it is
not student-run, it will be taken
more seriously: just like someone
collecting grades."
Grube hopes that the two
committees will, as time passes,
directly complement each other.
Eventually he envisions a
quarterly catalog of classes that
will include the instructor's
description of his course, followed
immediately by the most recent
student evaluation of the
instructor.
