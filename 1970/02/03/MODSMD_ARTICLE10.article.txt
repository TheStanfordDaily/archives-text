New I)oohies?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Since the beginning of the
quarter I have been scanning the
Daily for information about the
newest hallucinogen making the
rounds, DB, or dushbak. Since
such information has not been
forthcoming, I feel that it is my
duty to enlighten the Stanford
community about this dangerous
drug.
DB is cheaper than marijuana
and is much more dangerous. It
was originally developed in the
Middle East and has been grown
in large quantities by amateur
ngrnri.'ins in southern California.
From there, it has entered the
high schools, and in some cases
the junior high schools, causing
serious trouble wherever it is
prevalent. In the past six months
it has made its appearance in the
Palo Alto area and has raised

many difficulties at Cubberly and
Gunn. A small percentage of
Stanford students use it and
prefer it to marijuana not only
because it is relatively inexpensive
but because its "high" is more
sustained. Little is known about
the side affects it produces,
except that several regular users
have become seriously ill. No
deaths are known; this does not
preclude this possibility, however.
Another attractive feature of the
drug is the ease with which it is
grown, a;id that almost all parts of
the plant can be smoked. Small
patches are now being cultivated
in the hills in this area.
This letter should serve as a
warning to those who may be
offered DB. Don't accept it. This
drug is dangerous. I hope that a
more complete handling of this
subject will be soon seen in the
Daily.
