## The 						Scholarly Civilization 
### Vishist K. Raizada 
Mankind has experienced
many civilizations, the
hunting-gathering, the agricultural
and in our time the industrial. The
next civilization would be a
student oriented or a scholarly
civilization. Not that every one
would be a student of some kind,
although very many would be, but
students being the dominant
group in the scholarly community
would be the trend setters of the
society.
From humble beginnings (once
haunted like the early christians in
the Roman empire) the scholars
have come a long way to be the
members of the established
universities ot today. They have
also acquired great self-confidence
during this process of uplift. In
the next century the scholarly
community of a university would
grow many folds to become a city
by itself. The university cities of
the future would most probably
have the same impact on the
general population as the city
states of the past. They would be
the inventors of the value systems,
the elites, the models, and the
Meccas.
Many of the university cities
would be self supporting. This
would be necessary to preserve
their independence of thought
and action. As at present but at a
much larger scale, the university
cities would have consulting
services to work on projects of
specialized nature for the
government or private agencies.
Some others perhaps would
specialize in manufacturing, by

having a large industrial sector
within their boundaries. This
arrangement would be similiar to
those of the newly established
universities in India who have
what is called the "Versity
Estates" (meaning University
Industrial Park) attached to them.
The Versity Estates provide
training facilities for young
engineers and business graduates,
as well some means of financial
support. Instead of the merciless
profit maximization, the aim
would be to maintain that profit
level which is compatible with the
maximization of the social welfare
and utility.
One World Government
Mankind has for a long time
cherished to establish one world
government. Century, decade
after decade, this vision of
oneness has mostly been fancied
by the more enlightened. Most of
the earth's populace has deemed
this idea unworkable. There seems
a common folly with most of us.
What we do not see around us, we
do not believe will ever work.
The university cities would be
the cradles for the generation of a
sincere and, hopefully, strong new
spirit for the establishment of one
world government. These
scholarly cities, formed of people
who differ in many ways, working
in great harmony and following
their individual academic persuits,
would be the replicas of the new
order. The university cities would
be the show pieces to the
unconvinced populace of the
desirability and workability of the

international system.
University Cities
The scholarly cities, being
multi-national, would also be the
great cosmopolitan cultural
centers of the future. It would not
be uncommon for the outsiders to
visit the university cities for a
weekend or longer. In fact they
would be most welcomed by the
scholarly community to get them
to know the harmonious
functioning of the international
set-up.
Industrial Technology
The university cities would be
actively involved in solving the
problems associated with the
assimilation of the industrial
technology. Be they of the
physical or social environment.
After the second World War in
the West and decolonization in
the East, the young people,
especially students, all the world
over, have asserted their ideas in
almost every aspect of human
activity. However their impact has
not been as thorough and as
strong as it should have been.
Perhaps there is a reason for that.
New ideas are only accepted after
they have been firmly tested and
experimented. In the next century
the scholarly communities would
function as the experimental
grounds to test the abundance of
ideas that the young scholars
possess.
