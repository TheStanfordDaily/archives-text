# Fascisto Authoritarianism
## Peacetime Treason? 
### Jesse Cederbaum 
Contrary to Pat Cunningham's
expectations, I was not amused by
the little engraved response he
received to his memo to Vice
President Agnew ("The Ultimate
Agnew," The Daily Jan. 23).
This little incident and other
developments in Washington
cannot help but leave one with a
grim picture of the political and
"Democratic" future of this
country.
Any though I personally abhor
lables and name-calling as much as
anybody, I cannot, (with all due
apoligies to Harvey Hukari and
The ARENA for my limited
vocabulary) help but see those
holding the reigns of power
leading this country in any but a
Fascist, authoritarian direction.
The Immaculate Conception
It is indeed a sad state of affairs
when we can take the words of
our Vice President about as
seriously as those of Cassius Clay.
But how long shall it be before we
are all led to believe that the
cattle cars we are being herded
into comprise an express train to
the Promised land?
11 i tie ria n Future
Such a Hitlerian future may
well be not too far ahead of us.

And though we might be inclined
to dismiss such ominous
prognostications as products of
fanciful, yet nightmarish
pessimism, the fact remains that
as the infamous year 1984
approaches within less than a
decade and a half, the
groundwork for turning this
country into an Orwellian reverie
is fast being laid.
Take, for example, the bill
proposed by Senator James
Eastland (D-Miss.) during the last
session of the U.S. Senate. This
bill (S-12), if passed, would create
the crime of "Peacetime
Treason," which would make it a
felony to even suggest under your
breath that someone else could do
a better job of running the
country than the current
President was doing.
S.S. Policc Force
In order to enforce this statute,
the bill provides authorization for
the forming of an SS-style secret
police force, and would give the
President the power to arbitrarily
incarcerate any person or group of
people he felt constituted a threat
to the security of the United
States. Shades of Dr. Manette!
An equally intense, though

opposite type of fanaticism also
exists on the left end of the
political spectrum. The New Left,
in seeking to revolutionize the
Establishment, is as guilty as the
Right is of underming the goals it
professes to. Witness the frequent
eviction of members of the
Fourth Estate from meetings of
the Students for a "Democratic
Society." There is also an
abundant willingness of "liberals"
and "radicals" to jump onto
whatever d a r k hose-drawn
bandwagon should happen along.
So they play a mindless, suicidal
game of Follow-The-Leader,
advocating the violent overthrow
of the society which, though it is
depreciating rapidly, gave them
the freedom to profess said
revolution, though they have no
practical alternative in mind.
Self-styled Demagogue
The best policy for us today is
to keep as well informed as is
possible, drawing our information
from a multiplicity of sources.
Though the new media may color
the news, as Mr. Agnew contends,
there are enough different
shadings and angles provided to
the American public that a
rational, free-thinking individual
can piece together a
3-dimensional, full- color portrait
of what is going on in the world
around him.
Medusa's Avengers
The redeeming element in our
society, then is not our ability to
legislate against the undesirable
elements, nor is it our freedom to
choose to which political
movement we shall belong.
Rather, it is the freedom of the
individual to choose the best
course of action available to him;
it is the responsibility of the
individual to sift through the
information coming to him from
all sides in order to determine that
which is really the truth.

Contrary to Pat Cunningham's
expectations, I was not amused by
the little engraved response he
received to his memo to Vice
President Agnew ("The Ultimate
Agnew," The Daily Jan. 23).
This little incident and other
developments in Washington
cannot help but leave one with a
grim picture of the political and
"Democratic" future of this
country.
Any though I personally abhor
lables and name-calling as much as
anybody, I cannot, (with all due
apoligies to Harvey Hukari and
The ARENA for my limited
vocabulary) help but see those
holding the reigns of power
leading this country in any but a
Fascist, authoritarian direction.
The Immaculate Conception
It is indeed a sad state of affairs
when we can take the words of
our Vice President about as
seriously as those of Cassius Clay.
But how long shall it be before we
are all led to believe that the
cattle cars we are being herded
into comprise an express train to
the Promised land?
11 i tie ria n Future
Such a Hitlerian future may
well be not too far ahead of us.

And though we might be inclined
to dismiss such ominous
prognostications as products of
fanciful, yet nightmarish
pessimism, the fact remains that
as the infamous year 1984
approaches within less than a
decade and a half, the
groundwork for turning this
country into an Orwellian reverie
is fast being laid.
Take, for example, the bill
proposed by Senator James
Eastland (D-Miss.) during the last
session of the U.S. Senate. This
bill (S-12), if passed, would create
the crime of "Peacetime
Treason," which would make it a
felony to even suggest under your
breath that someone else could do
a better job of running the
country than the current
President was doing.
S.S. Policc Force
In order to enforce this statute,
the bill provides authorization for
the forming of an SS-style secret
police force, and would give the
President the power to arbitrarily
incarcerate any person or group of
people he felt constituted a threat
to the security of the United
States. Shades of Dr. Manette!
An equally intense, though

opposite type of fanaticism also
exists on the left end of the
political spectrum. The New Left,
in seeking to revolutionize the
Establishment, is as guilty as the
Right is of underming the goals it
professes to. Witness the frequent
eviction of members of the
Fourth Estate from meetings of
the Students for a "Democratic
Society." There is also an
abundant willingness of "liberals"
and "radicals" to jump onto
whatever d a r k hose-drawn
bandwagon should happen along.
So they play a mindless, suicidal
game of Follow-The-Leader,
advocating the violent overthrow
of the society which, though it is
depreciating rapidly, gave them
the freedom to profess said
revolution, though they have no
practical alternative in mind.
Self-styled Demagogue
The best policy for us today is
to keep as well informed as is
possible, drawing our information
from a multiplicity of sources.
Though the new media may color
the news, as Mr. Agnew contends,
there are enough different
shadings and angles provided to
the American public that a
rational, free-thinking individual
can piece together a
3-dimensional, full- color portrait
of what is going on in the world
around him.
Medusa's Avengers
The redeeming element in our
society, then is not our ability to
legislate against the undesirable
elements, nor is it our freedom to
choose to which political
movement we shall belong.
Rather, it is the freedom of the
individual to choose the best
course of action available to him;
it is the responsibility of the
individual to sift through the
information coming to him from
all sides in order to determine that
which is really the truth.
