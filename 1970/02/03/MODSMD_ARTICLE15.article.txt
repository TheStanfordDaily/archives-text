Manzanita Park and Hoskins House sponsor their second in a series
of panels on career opportunities for women today at 4:15 in
Tresidder Large Lounge.
Participants in today's panel discussion, "The World of Community
Service," include Edna Brown, of the Far West Regional Lab for
Educational Research and Development; Dorothy Chandler, head of
Lab Services at the Berkeley School of Public Health; Mary
Humphrey, and artist and founder of Ecology Action; and Pat Miller,
Executive Director of Planned Parenthood for Santa Clara County.
Miss Brown is presently working to develop a library of educational
toys for children whose parents make incomes just above the
Headstart-poverty level.
Two black organizers from Detroit will speak tonight at 7 p.m. in
Tresidder room 270 in a meeting sponsored by the New University
Conference, SDS and the New Moratorium.
Chuck Wooton of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers will
discuss the maverick labor organizing effort that started in auto plants
in Detroit and has spread across the nation. The League has bypassed
the bureaucracy-ridden United Auto Workers to resist racism and the
general exploitation of minority workers on the "speedup" assembly
lines.
Carl Williams, active in organizing at ghetto high schools, will also
speak. Both Wooton and Williams attended the radical conference on
labor at Berkeley last weekend, co-sponsored by the Pacific Studies
Center of Palo Alto.
The discussion will be followed at 8:30 p.m. by a general meeting
of the New Stanford Moratorium, which is opposing military training
programs on campus.
