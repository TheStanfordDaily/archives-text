# Study Shows MBA Salaries Doubling

### 
Earnings of Stanford Business
School graduates almost doubled
five years after graduation, a
study at the Business School
shows.
Those graduates in small
business (firms with less than
1,000 employees) generally
earned higher salaries than those
in big business (1,000 or more)
five years after leaving the School,
the report shows.
These data are taken from
"Earnings of MBA's Five Years
after Graduation," a study of
Stanford Business School's master
of business administration (MBA)
graduates of 1961, 1962, 1963,
and 1964, by Thomas W. Harrell,
professor of applied psychology,
reported in the current issue of
the School's Bulletin.
The study shows the combined
classes had a median (middlemost)
salary gain of 95 percent after five
years, the gains ranging from 75
percent for 1961 graduates in
large business to 148 percent for
1964 graduates in small business.
With the exception of the class
of 1961, those in small business
had higher incomes than (hose in
a big business five years after
graduation. Median increase of the
four classes in small business was
112 percent, as compared with 84
percent in big business. In fact, 50
percent of Ihe '63 and '64
graduates earned as much or more
than the top 25 percent of those
in big business.
Following is a profile of the
median monthly starting salaries,
compared with median monthly
salaries five years later, together
with percentage increases for each
class in big and small business.
Class of 1961 :
Big Business—from $648 to
$1,162, a 75% gain.

Small Business—from $525 to
$1,100, a 98% sain.
Class of 1962:
Big Business—from $643 to
$1,160, an 82% gain.
Small Business—from $650 to
$1,250, a 92% gain.
Class of 1963:
Big Business—from $700 to
$1,300, an 86% gain.
Small Business—from $675 to
$1,600, a 1 26% gain.
Class of 1964:
Big Business—from $750 to
$1,500, a 106% gain.
Small Business —from $750 to
$1,750, a 148% gain.
There was a difference of $452
a month in average current
earnings between the classes of
1961 and 1964 but Prof. Harrell
conjectures the difference was due
largely to inflation.
He said he received a 90
percent return to his
questionnaire. Only American
born males in business were
counted because earnings would
be less comparable with
nationality and sex differences
and in non-profit institutions. He
also excluded responses from
those in family-owned business in
order to eliminate the question of
nepotism, and from those with
more than one year military or
Peace Corps service since
graduation. "Spending more than
a year with the military or Peace
Corps might have reduced one's
chances to get ahead in business
during the five years after
graduation," said Prof. Harrell.
Median rather than average
earnings were used since after five
years, the average include a
few unusually high earners, and
therefore distort the picture, Prof.
Harrell said.
