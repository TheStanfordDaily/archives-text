# Are Women Equal?
## Views Differ on Female Role 
### 
"A woman's place is in bed
when she's not cooking!
Fireworks may well erupt
when Dianne Feeley, Marxist and
Women's Liberationist, confronts
this attitude in the coming
three-speaker forum on "Women
in the Seventies." Miss Feeley\s
radical stance will follow a
presentation of the traditional
view, that a woman's place is in
th eh o m e , by St a n 112 o rd
psychology professor Phillip
Zimbardo. "Gender: Relevant and
Irrelevant" is the subject of the
third speaker. Dr. Herant
K a t c h a d o u r i a n, A .â€¢> so c i a t e
Professor of Psychiatry at the
Stanford Medical School.
The actives of Cap and Gown,
Stanford's honor society for
women, are sponsoring this probe
into the woman's role in the
dramatically changing society of
the Seventies on Sunday,
February Bth, at 7:.'io p.m. in the
Stanford Business School's Bishop
Auditorium. The event, planned
I>\ the undergraduate members of
the society, is open to the public.
Profs. Z i in b a r d o a n d
Katchadourian are popular on
campus for their humor and
freewheeling, innovative lectures,
while Dianne Feeley's provocative
protest has raised much interest.
Drawing 600 students to a class
normally attracting only 200,
Zimbardo jokes and experiments
with his audiences in his
entertaining and exciting lectures.

In the coining forum, he will be
role-playing "the man off the
street."
"Human sexuality" is Dr.
Katchadourian's specialty and also
the title of his lecture class which
regul a r I y tu r lis a way more
studenlst h a n c a n be
accommodated. His frank,
no-nonsense approach promises to
face squarely the changing sexual
role of woman.
Dianne Feeley, in her campaign
as the Socialist Workers Party's
candidate for the lI.S. Senate seat
vacated by George Murphy,
champions the slogan "Write
Women Back into History!" Miss
Feeley believes that many
conservative people may actually
find her radical ideas quite
reasonable. She asserts that
women homemakers should be
paid wages for their labor, while
working mothers should have
available to them 24-hour day
care centers for their children.
"It's society's obligation to
help raise our children," argues
Miss Feeley. "We confuse
biological functions with social
functions."
After the talks, Stanford
students will meet in homes of
Stanford alumnae to discuss the
issues raised. Students planning to
attend are urged to send a post
card with their name, address, and
phone number to Cap and Gown,
Box 118 1, Stanford, California.

In addition to speaker
programs and service projects
sponsored by its undergraduates,
the alumnae of Cap and Gown
raise money through calendar
sales for a yearly, full-tuition
scholarship for a Stanford girl.
Begun in 1905, Cap and Gown
has grown from a membership of
five or six senior girls to its
present size of one hundred.
In the past, prospective new
members have been approached
Spring Quarter of their junior year
at Stanford with selection based
on scholastic ability and
leadership. Social activities
include a Fall Tea and Spring
Luncheon.
