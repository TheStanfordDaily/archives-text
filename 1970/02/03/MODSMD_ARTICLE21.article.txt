# Moratorium Fast a Success
## 
### 
The University Food Service
released figures yesterday for the
University-wide "fast" held on
Friday and Saturday, January 16
and 17. Over 2500 meals were
missed and a total of $1947 was
collected.
The money will be given to the
American Friends Service
Committee to "be earmarked for a
factory in South Vietnam which
makes artificial limbs for injured
refugees. Marshall Palley, College

Program Director for the San
Francisco office of the AFS
Committee, remarked that the
donation would greatly aid the
Friends' program in Vietnam.
The money represented savings
in food costs from meals missed,
with the figures based on the
difference from the normal
pattern of attendence. Stern Hall
led the rest of the University with
over 840 meals missed.
Substantial support was also

present in Lagunita, Wilbur, Roble
and the Row.
Josh Cooperman, the initiator
of the program at Stanford, felt
that the effort was a success,
while members of the Student
Hobilization Committee, who
helped organize the boycott,
emphasized that this was only one
of the diverse ways to bring the
war down to a personal level.
A similar one-day effort last
year netted over $1200 for Biafra.
