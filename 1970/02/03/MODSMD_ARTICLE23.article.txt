# Paly High Suspends Four Students
## 
### 
Palo Alto High School has
suspended four students pending
parent conferences for
distributing copies of the
underground publication Radical
Rag, Principal George Millar said
yesterday.
Copies of the off-campus
publication were confiscated
when its third edition appeared on
campus last week. Yesterday's
suspensions were only of those
students caught "actively
distributing the paper."
"We don't know who is
responsible for individual
aritcles," Millar explained.

Articles in the Radical Rag are all
signed by pseudonyms.
The fact that the tabloid was
not an official publication of any
active on-campus club was "in
itself reason enough to halt
distribution," Millar said.
However, he added, this particular
issue contained obscenities and its
"general tone" was deemed "not
appropriate for distribution on a
high school campus."
The publication was released
under the name of the Radical
Student Union (RSU), which
ceased to be an official campus
organization when its faculty
sponsor withdrew.
