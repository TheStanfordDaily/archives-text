# Residents Petition
## Dillingham Challenge 
### 
Separate petitions opposing the
proposed Dillingham Financial
Center are being circulated by
residents of South Park, wouth
of the proposed project site and
by members of Grass Roots.
The Barron Park petition
originated after discussion at a
community meeting last Thursday
in which representatives of
Stanford University, the
Dillingham Corporation and Grass
Roots spoke to an audience of 73

people. The meeting was
sponsored by the Barron Park
Neighborhood Group and the
Peninsula Vietnam Moratorium
Committee,.
The petition argues that the
proposed project will worsen local
problems of housing, traffic and
pollution and urges that Stanford
University and the City of Palo
Alto reject the present proposal.
Another petition, being
circulated by Grass Roots, voices

opposition to both the Dillingham
project and the Coyote Hill
project. It asks for community
planning and control of land use
in the area. The petition
emphasizes housing development.
It states, in part: "We endorse
the spirit of the housing proposals
which the United Stanford
Employees (U.S.E.) and the East
Palo Alto Information Center
presented to Stanford's Wright
Committee: that is, that Stanford
build several thousand units with
at least 1,500 low-income units
and enough extra units to remove
its students from the tight housing
market; that it develop the
necessary services for such a
project; and that community
persons who will ultimately live in
the project control its
development."
Peter Ober, a Barron Park
resident and Stanford Professor
said that Barron Park's petition is
independent of Grass Roots'
activities. He said that the
audience at the Barron Park
general meeting seemed fairly set
against Dillingham. He felt that
University representative Boyd
Smith, who spoke at the meeting,
was talking about Stanford
University land policies but was
not really considering community
needs.
Barron Park petitions will be
circulated in the unincorporated
community this week. There are
over 1300 households in the area.
Besides the two petitions, a
"community meeting," sponsored
by Grass Roots to discuss
Mid-Peninsula development, will
take place Thursday, Feb. 12, at
the First Presbyterian Church in
Palo Alto.
