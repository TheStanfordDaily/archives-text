## Douglas Blasts 'Establishment' 
### 
In a new book soon to be
released, Supreme Court Justice
William 0. Douglas is lending
credence to todays youthful
protesters and dissenters.
In his new book. Points of
Rebellion, to be released Feb. 19,
Douglas warns that revolution
may prove to be the only
honorable alternative to
oppression by the American
Establishment. He compares the
relationship between youth and
the Establishment today to that
of the Founding Fathers and King
George 111 of England.
"We must realize that today's
Establishment is the new George
111. Whether it will continue to
adhere to his tactics, we do not
know. If it does, the redress,
honored in tradition, is also
revolution."
Though he acknowledges that
violence is not sanctioned in the
Constitutional tradition, he
nevertheless acknowledges that
"where grievances pile high and
most of the elected spokesmen
represent the Establishment,
violence may be the only effective
response."
Among the targets attacked by
Douglas in his arguments for a
radical "restructuring of the
government, are the FBI and CIA
the Pentagon and former
Presidents Johnson and Truman.
He laments modern
law-enforcement techniques,
including police tactics and
methods of electronic
surveillance. "Every phone in
every federal or state agency is
suspect (to bugging). Every
conference room is assumed to be

bugged. Every embassy phone is
an open transmitter.
"Certain hotels in Washington"
he continues, "have allotments of
rooms that are wired for sound
and even contain two-way mirrors
so that occupants can be taped or
filmed."
Writing on American foreign
policy, the justice asks, "Where is
the force that will restrain the
Pentagon?
"At the international level we
have become virtually paranoid,
he contends. "Indeed a black
silence of fear possesses the
Nation and is causing us to
jettison some of our libertarian
traditions."
The modern day dissenters and
protesters are functioning as the
loyal opposition functions in
England, Douglas states. And yet,
"Powers that be faintly echo
Adolph Hitler, who said (during
his rise to power in 1932) 'The
streets of our country are in
turmoil. The universities are filled
with students rebelling and rioting
. . . We need law and order."
Douglas has dire fears, however,
about the revolution he sanctions
and forsees. The violence and
destruction to be caused depends
on how wise the establishment
will be. His prediction: "If, with
its stockpile of arms it resolves to
supress the dissenters, America
will face, I fear, an awful ordeal."
Middle East
TEL AVIV (AP) - The Middle
East war flared on two fronts
Monday as Israeli and Syrian

tanks, planes and artillery traded
punches along the occupied Golan
Heights and Israel and Egypt
exchanged air strikes.
It was the heaviest outbreak of
fighting between Israel and Syria
since the 1967 war and marked
the second straight day of ground
fighting between the two
countries.
The Israeli's said that one of
their planes was shot down over
Syrian territory.
The Syrians, however, claimed
the Israelis lost four planes, three
tanks and fortified gun
emplacements, and estimated
Israeli casualties at 25 killed and
wounded. The Syrian military
communique said Syrian losses
were one tank, one other vehicle
destroyed and four wounded. By
Israeli account five Syrian tanks
were destroyed in two days.
Israeli jets roared deep into
Egypt meanwhile, at targets deep
in the Nile Valley.
Egyptian aircraft retaliated
with hit-and-run attacks across the
Suez Canal, north of El Qantara,
the Israelis said, adding there were
no Israeli casualties or damage in
the Egyptian air strikes.
It was Egypt's second air
incursion across the waterway in
as many days.
