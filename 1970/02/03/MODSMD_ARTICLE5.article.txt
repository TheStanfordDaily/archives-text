# People's Park Police Indicted
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-Ten
sheriff's deputies and two
former deputies were charged
Monday in federal indictments
with violating the civil rights of
participants in the "People's
Park" riots in Berkeley last
May.
The indictments referred
specifically to shotgun blasts
fired at demonstrators and
bystanders and to the
treatment of the hundreds of
persons arrested.
One man was killed, one
blinded and several others were
wounded by shotgun fire and
more than 100 others were
injured in more than two
weeks of violence that started
when Berkeley militants seized
a vacant lot belonging to the
University of California and
turned it into what they called
"People's Park."
The occupants of the park,
both nonstudents and students,
were ousted by police but with
their supporters stormed the
lot May 1 5 in a wild battle.
Rioting broke out when
police blocked several
thousand persons marching
from the university campus to
People's Park, which the school
had fenced earlier that day.
Daily Clashes
Almost daily clashes with
the National Guard, deputies
and police were climaxed May
22 with the mass arrest of 482
persons.
Many of those arrested
contended they were
mistreated by deputies at the
county's Santa Rita Prison
Farm. All were eventually
released on grounds that
booking officers could not
testify as arresting officers.
Monday's indictments
charged 10 officers with
conspiracy and imposing
summary punishment in
violation of civil rights acts
which retiring U.S. Attorney
Cecil Poole said are nearly a
century old.
Deputies Accused
Eight deputies were accused
of shooting demonstrators and
bystanders with shotguns May
15.
The shootings were
described as done "with the
intent of imposing summary
punishment" and violating the
victims' right not to be
deprived to liberty without due
process of law."
U.S. District Court Judge
William T. Sweigert issued
summonses for the indicted
men, returnable Feb. 16.
1 0 Years
Conviction for conspiracy
carries a maximum penalty of
10 years in prison and a $5,000
fine, and summary punishment
one year and a $1,000 fine.
Before the indictments were
returned, Alameda County
Sheriff Frank Madigan said,
"It's not fair for the federal
government to zero in" on the
sheriff's department.
"We were dealing with group
whose avowed intent is to
destroy the government," he
added.
Past Demonstrations
In the history of radical
disorders in Berkeley over the
past several years, the sheriff

said, "The civil rights of a lot
of people were violated
without any federal
investigation.
"Troop trains were stopped,
demonstrations were staged at
the Oakland Induction Center
and Army Base, and people
were prevented from going to
class."
Prosecutor Poole, who left
office Monday after handing
up the indictments, said
investigators had talked to
about 300 persons He declined
to say if any further
indictments were expected, but
said his successor, James
Browning .Jr., would handle the
prosecutions.
Protection Against Police
"A citizen never needs
protection as much as he does
when in the face of those who
have power to take him into
custody, to jail, or to execute
him," Poole told a news
conference.
Announcement of the
indictments was made over the
name of U.S. Attorney General
John Mitchell.
Poole said only that the
Department of Justice in
Washington had been very
cooperative in the inquiry.
He said the indictments were
not under new civil rights
legislation, but under old laws
dating well back into the 19th
century and used from time to
time in cases involving peace
officers.
One of the main stimulants
to the grand jury probe, Poole
said, was a Berkeley City
Council resolution last May 2-1
asking such an investigation.
