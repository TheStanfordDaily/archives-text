# Reed Payment Battle Revived
## 
### 
After a five day hiatus the
skirmish over paying the Political
Union's $4700 debt has been
renewed.
A petition being circulated
today demands a student body
referendum on the student Senate
decision to cover two unpaid
guest speakers' fees with ASSU
funds. Five percent, or about 600
signatures are needed for the issue
to be placed on the ballot.
The controversy centers around
Political Union chairman Roger
Reed, who signed contracts with
Barry Goldwater and Harrison
Salisbury without authorization
from Student Financial Manager
David Swift.
Senate deputy chairman John
Shoch commented last night,
"Hopefully, the Senate will be
able to recover the money illegally
spent by the Political Union, or
any other organization which acts
in a similarly irresponsible
manner.
The petition reads in part: He it
enacted that the Associated
Students of Stanford University
will not assume responsibility or
liability for any debts incurred by
or contracts signed by individuals
without the prior approval of the
Student Financial Manager.
