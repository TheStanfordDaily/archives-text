# First Public Showdown
## NRA Debates Gun Control 
### 
In a debate held yesterday afternoon in
Tresidder, two nationally known figures in the
gun-control controversy defended their views in
what could be considered a stand-off. The
debate marked the first time that the National
Rifle Association (NRA) has ever consented to
an open debate.
Sponsored by the Political Union and the
Stanford Law Forum, the debate paired David
J. Steinberg, executive director of the National
Council for the Responsible Firearms Policy,
and Herbert C. Kohlwes, chairman of the board
of the United Sportsmen of San Mateo County.
Steinbert, in his opening statement, called
guns "the most destructive of personal
weapons."
He cited statistics showing that murder and
other crimes using guns have risen rapidly over
the past six years. Steinberg noted that pro-gun
elements have frequently used the Second
Amendment to bolster their arguments.
No Right To Hear Arms
"I see nothing in the Constitution or in the
interpretation of the Constitution by court
decisions that indicates to me convincingly that
there is a right to bear arms.
Steinbert advocates gun control on a
state-level basis. Each state would be
responsible for working out its own code. This
"sort of Ten Commandments" would be
worked out by state police, other authorities
and sporting clubs working towards a common
goal. The purpose of the code would be to

inform the individual gun owner that, because
of the gun's potential danger, the society in
which he lives demands certain standards of
him.
The second point in Sternberg's gun control
program called for licensing of gun owners and
registration of their guns. The third point of his
proposal would hold the individual gun-owner
responsible for each gun registered in his name.
Strangulation
Kohlwes, reading a prepared statement,
outlined his position in the opening sentence:
"1 believe that he (Sternberg) advocates
strangulation by regulation and more
governmental bureuacracy, which is a burden
on all of us and circumscribes our individual
rights."
He upheld the value of the Second
Amendment as the individual's right to keep
and bear arms. He also noted the effect of an
armed population on the political scene.
Throe Point Program
"Licensing and registration are the first
steps toward confiscation," he maintained.
Nevertheless, Kohlwes did agree that certain
elements of the population should not be given
access to guns and rifles. To impliment his
plans, he presented a three-point program
consisting of legislation imposing mandatory
penalties for any crime committed with a gun,
prevention of minors, alcoholics and similar
persons from owning guns, and stricter
enforcement of current firearms laws.

on all of us and circumscribes our individual
rights."
He upheld the value of the Second
Amendment as the individual's right to keep
and bear arms. He also noted the effect of an
armed population on the political scene.
Throe Point Program
"Licensing and registration are the first
steps toward confiscation," he maintained.
Nevertheless, Kohlwes did agree that certain
elements of the population should not be given
access to guns and rifles. To impliment his
plans, he presented a three-point program
consisting of legislation imposing mandatory
penalties for any crime committed with a gun,
prevention of minors, alcoholics and similar
persons from owning guns, and stricter
enforcement of current firearms laws.
In a debate held yesterday afternoon in
Tresidder, two nationally known figures in the
gun-control controversy defended their views in
what could be considered a stand-off. The
debate marked the first time that the National
Rifle Association (NRA) has ever consented to
an open debate.
Sponsored by the Political Union and the
Stanford Law Forum, the debate paired David
J. Steinberg, executive director of the National
Council for the Responsible Firearms Policy,
and Herbert C. Kohlwes, chairman of the board
of the United Sportsmen of San Mateo County.
Steinbert, in his opening statement, called
guns "the most destructive of personal
weapons."
He cited statistics showing that murder and
other crimes using guns have risen rapidly over
the past six years. Steinberg noted that pro-gun
elements have frequently used the Second
Amendment to bolster their arguments.
No Right To Hear Arms
"I see nothing in the Constitution or in the
interpretation of the Constitution by court
decisions that indicates to me convincingly that
there is a right to bear arms.
Steinbert advocates gun control on a
state-level basis. Each state would be
responsible for working out its own code. This
"sort of Ten Commandments" would be
worked out by state police, other authorities
and sporting clubs working towards a common
goal. The purpose of the code would be to

inform the individual gun owner that, because
of the gun's potential danger, the society in
which he lives demands certain standards of
him.
The second point in Sternberg's gun control
program called for licensing of gun owners and
registration of their guns. The third point of his
proposal would hold the individual gun-owner
responsible for each gun registered in his name.
Strangulation
Kohlwes, reading a prepared statement,
outlined his position in the opening sentence:
"1 believe that he (Sternberg) advocates
strangulation by regulation and more
governmental bureuacracy, which is a burden
on all of us and circumscribes our individual
rights."
He upheld the value of the Second
Amendment as the individual's right to keep
and bear arms. He also noted the effect of an
armed population on the political scene.
