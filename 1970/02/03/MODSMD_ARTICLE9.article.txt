# Family of Man
## Panthers: Street School 
### Jim Berk 
Police attacks on the Panthers
have finally sparked a rage of
reaction from wide sections of the
Black community and angry
protest from some 'elements' of
the rest of us. There has also been
a wave of sentimental support as a
result of the medias' underdog,
bad guys/ good guys attempt to
stay on top of news management.
One other result is a
shoot-em-up scenario that leaves
the TV addicts gasping as the lead
whips into the sand-bagged HQ,
the anti-tank gun is unlimbered
and the CS gas leaks into the
living room.
But the Panthers have other
lessons we can learn. In October,
'66 Huey Newton and Bobby
Seale wrote a 10-point program
for the liberation of the Black
people. They wanted self
determination, full employment,
no exploitation, decent housing,
relevant education, exemption
from military service, an end to
police brutality, freedom from all
Black prisoners, trial by a jury of
their peers, in sum: land, bread,
housing, education, clothing,
justice and peace.
The Results?
Hard to beat for a program but
talk is cheap. What did they do?
What were the results? As the
intellectuals would say, "How did
they implement it?"
Well, they have fed tens of
thousands of hungry kids before
school in thirty-odd cities across
the U.S.A. in the last year.
Collecting the food supplies from
the local merchants and
mobilizing Panthers and
volunteers in the community to
do the work, the Panthers have
fieshed-out the slogan POWER TO
THE PEOPLE!
Liberation Schools
They have also organized many
Liberation Schools where their
struggling youth can learn the
necessary lessons for survival.
Here kids are encouraged to be
"changers" in a genocidal
environment.
In many large cities free health

centers have been established
where the sick and weak can be
helped. Special emphasis is placed
on the nutrition of expectant
mothers to give the children the
best start possible.
Control of Pigs
Petition drives for the ballot
and political work focus on the
issue of community control of
police. These propose a local,
elected board to determine policy
and control the police. They
would also require the cops to live
in the area whose people they
serve.
The Panthers have given strong
support to Black Gls forced to
fight their natural allies, the
Vietnamese, in a racist, genocidal
war. Encouraged to die for the
'rights' of the Vietnamese which
back in the States they are not
privileged to enjoy, Black soldiers
are challenged to rise to the
defense of their own people.
Panther Paper
Their paper, The Black Panther,
Black Community News Service,
is one of the few papers serving
Black people. A press run of
100,000 is distributed around the
country informing and mobilizing.
The Panthers know they are
engaged in a war of liberation that
will spare neither man, woman
nor child. Therefore there are no
"Pantherettes". It is everyones'
fight and the sisters have also
'picked up the gun'in large
numbers.
U.N. Plea
For over a year the Panthers
have worked towards a U.N.
supervised plebiscite for Black
people in the U.S.A. to determine
the will of Black people as to their
national destiny. As the violent
repression mounts the Panthers
have searched for allies in a
United Front Against Fascism.
Interested only in a functional,
principaled coalition they have
fearlessly exposed the U.S.A.
brand of Fascism. The reaction
they have drawn has further
sustained their charges.
Finally, they have raised the

level of their struggle and
high-lighted ours by their proposal
for an exchange of prisoners of
war. They have already entered
into negotiations for the exchange
of GI prisoners of the North
Vietnamese for political prisoners
in U.S.A. jails. They have
advanced their struggle from one
of minority rights or racial
survival to one of national
liberation. They have highlighted
ours because they are doing
something for our people we have
failed to do ourselves.
And that is the piercing lesson
of the Panthers: study the needs
and condition of your people and
move to meet them. They have
filled with meaning the sloganss
SERVE THE PEOPLE and THE
PARTY IS AN OX FOR THE
PEOPLE TO RIDE. They have
begun to form a base from which
the Black people can sustain their
survival.
Family of Man
Will our people survive? Can we
begin to meet the needs of our
people? Can we successfully
undertake one small task of
resistance?
On Mon., Feb. 16, the
STANFORD COMMUNITY
AGAINST WAR AND FASCISM
will sponsor a Huey Newton
Birthday Rally for Political
Prisoners in Mem Aud at eight.
Rally 'round the family of man
and join us in our resistance to
Fascism.

They have also organized many
Liberation Schools where their
struggling youth can learn the
necessary lessons for survival.
Here kids are encouraged to be
"changers" in a genocidal
environment.
In many large cities free health

centers have been established
where the sick and weak can be
helped. Special emphasis is placed
on the nutrition of expectant
mothers to give the children the
best start possible.
Control of Pigs
Petition drives for the ballot
and political work focus on the
issue of community control of
police. These propose a local,
elected board to determine policy
and control the police. They
would also require the cops to live
in the area whose people they
serve.
The Panthers have given strong
support to Black Gls forced to
fight their natural allies, the
Vietnamese, in a racist, genocidal
war. Encouraged to die for the
'rights' of the Vietnamese which
back in the States they are not
privileged to enjoy, Black soldiers
are challenged to rise to the
defense of their own people.
Panther Paper
Their paper, The Black Panther,
Black Community News Service,
is one of the few papers serving
Black people. A press run of
100,000 is distributed around the
country informing and mobilizing.
The Panthers know they are
engaged in a war of liberation that
will spare neither man, woman
nor child. Therefore there are no
"Pantherettes". It is everyones'
fight and the sisters have also
'picked up the gun'in large
numbers.
U.N. Plea
For over a year the Panthers
have worked towards a U.N.
supervised plebiscite for Black
people in the U.S.A. to determine
the will of Black people as to their
national destiny. As the violent
repression mounts the Panthers
have searched for allies in a
United Front Against Fascism.
Interested only in a functional,
principaled coalition they have
fearlessly exposed the U.S.A.
brand of Fascism. The reaction
they have drawn has further
sustained their charges.
Finally, they have raised the

level of their struggle and
high-lighted ours by their proposal
for an exchange of prisoners of
war. They have already entered
into negotiations for the exchange
of GI prisoners of the North
Vietnamese for political prisoners
in U.S.A. jails. They have
advanced their struggle from one
of minority rights or racial
survival to one of national
liberation. They have highlighted
ours because they are doing
something for our people we have
failed to do ourselves.
And that is the piercing lesson
of the Panthers: study the needs
and condition of your people and
move to meet them. They have
filled with meaning the sloganss
SERVE THE PEOPLE and THE
PARTY IS AN OX FOR THE
PEOPLE TO RIDE. They have
begun to form a base from which
the Black people can sustain their
survival.
Family of Man
Will our people survive? Can we
begin to meet the needs of our
people? Can we successfully
undertake one small task of
resistance?
On Mon., Feb. 16, the
STANFORD COMMUNITY
AGAINST WAR AND FASCISM
will sponsor a Huey Newton
Birthday Rally for Political
Prisoners in Mem Aud at eight.
Rally 'round the family of man
and join us in our resistance to
Fascism.
(Jim Berk is an engineer at the
Stanford Liuear Accelerator
Center and is a member of the
Stanford Community against War
and Fascism.)
Police attacks on the Panthers
have finally sparked a rage of
reaction from wide sections of the
Black community and angry
protest from some 'elements' of
the rest of us. There has also been
a wave of sentimental support as a
result of the medias' underdog,
bad guys/ good guys attempt to
stay on top of news management.
One other result is a
shoot-em-up scenario that leaves
the TV addicts gasping as the lead
whips into the sand-bagged HQ,
the anti-tank gun is unlimbered
and the CS gas leaks into the
living room.
But the Panthers have other
lessons we can learn. In October,
'66 Huey Newton and Bobby
Seale wrote a 10-point program
for the liberation of the Black
people. They wanted self
determination, full employment,
no exploitation, decent housing,
relevant education, exemption
from military service, an end to
police brutality, freedom from all
Black prisoners, trial by a jury of
their peers, in sum: land, bread,
housing, education, clothing,
justice and peace.
The Results?
Hard to beat for a program but
talk is cheap. What did they do?
What were the results? As the
intellectuals would say, "How did
they implement it?"
Well, they have fed tens of
thousands of hungry kids before
school in thirty-odd cities across
the U.S.A. in the last year.
Collecting the food supplies from
the local merchants and
mobilizing Panthers and
volunteers in the community to
do the work, the Panthers have
fieshed-out the slogan POWER TO
THE PEOPLE!

the will of Black people as to their
national destiny. As the violent
repression mounts the Panthers
have searched for allies in a
United Front Against Fascism.
Interested only in a functional,
principaled coalition they have
fearlessly exposed the U.S.A.
brand of Fascism. The reaction
they have drawn has further
sustained their charges.
Finally, they have raised the

level of their struggle and
high-lighted ours by their proposal
for an exchange of prisoners of
war. They have already entered
into negotiations for the exchange
of GI prisoners of the North
Vietnamese for political prisoners
in U.S.A. jails. They have
advanced their struggle from one
of minority rights or racial
survival to one of national
liberation. They have highlighted
ours because they are doing
something for our people we have
failed to do ourselves.
And that is the piercing lesson
of the Panthers: study the needs
and condition of your people and
move to meet them. They have
filled with meaning the sloganss
SERVE THE PEOPLE and THE
PARTY IS AN OX FOR THE
PEOPLE TO RIDE. They have
begun to form a base from which
the Black people can sustain their
survival.
Family of Man
Will our people survive? Can we
begin to meet the needs of our
people? Can we successfully
undertake one small task of
resistance?
On Mon., Feb. 16, the
STANFORD COMMUNITY
AGAINST WAR AND FASCISM
will sponsor a Huey Newton
Birthday Rally for Political
Prisoners in Mem Aud at eight.
Rally 'round the family of man
and join us in our resistance to
Fascism.

Police attacks on the Panthers
have finally sparked a rage of
reaction from wide sections of the
Black community and angry
protest from some 'elements' of
the rest of us. There has also been
a wave of sentimental support as a
result of the medias' underdog,
bad guys/ good guys attempt to
stay on top of news management.
One other result is a
shoot-em-up scenario that leaves
the TV addicts gasping as the lead
whips into the sand-bagged HQ,
the anti-tank gun is unlimbered
and the CS gas leaks into the
living room.
But the Panthers have other
lessons we can learn. In October,
'66 Huey Newton and Bobby
Seale wrote a 10-point program
for the liberation of the Black
people. They wanted self
determination, full employment,
no exploitation, decent housing,
relevant education, exemption
from military service, an end to
police brutality, freedom from all
Black prisoners, trial by a jury of
their peers, in sum: land, bread,
housing, education, clothing,
justice and peace.
The Results?
Hard to beat for a program but
talk is cheap. What did they do?
What were the results? As the
intellectuals would say, "How did
they implement it?"
Well, they have fed tens of
thousands of hungry kids before
school in thirty-odd cities across
the U.S.A. in the last year.
Collecting the food supplies from
the local merchants and
mobilizing Panthers and
volunteers in the community to
do the work, the Panthers have
fieshed-out the slogan POWER TO
THE PEOPLE!
Liberation Schools
They have also organized many
Liberation Schools where their
struggling youth can learn the
necessary lessons for survival.
Here kids are encouraged to be
"changers" in a genocidal
environment.
In many large cities free health

centers have been established
where the sick and weak can be
helped. Special emphasis is placed
on the nutrition of expectant
mothers to give the children the
best start possible.
Control of Pigs
Petition drives for the ballot
and political work focus on the
issue of community control of
police. These propose a local,
elected board to determine policy
and control the police. They
would also require the cops to live
in the area whose people they
serve.
The Panthers have given strong
support to Black Gls forced to
fight their natural allies, the
Vietnamese, in a racist, genocidal
war. Encouraged to die for the
'rights' of the Vietnamese which
back in the States they are not
privileged to enjoy, Black soldiers
are challenged to rise to the
defense of their own people.
Panther Paper
Their paper, The Black Panther,
Black Community News Service,
is one of the few papers serving
Black people. A press run of
100,000 is distributed around the
country informing and mobilizing.
The Panthers know they are
engaged in a war of liberation that
will spare neither man, woman
nor child. Therefore there are no
"Pantherettes". It is everyones'
fight and the sisters have also
'picked up the gun'in large
numbers.
U.N. Plea
For over a year the Panthers
have worked towards a U.N.
supervised plebiscite for Black
people in the U.S.A. to determine
the will of Black people as to their
national destiny. As the violent
repression mounts the Panthers
have searched for allies in a
United Front Against Fascism.
Interested only in a functional,
principaled coalition they have
