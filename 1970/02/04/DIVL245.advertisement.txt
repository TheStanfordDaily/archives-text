Lose 10 lbs. in
10 days on
Grapefruit
Diet
—This is the revolutionary grapefruit
diet that everyone is suddenly talking
about. Thousands of copies have been
passed from hand to hand in factories,
plants and offices throughout the U.S.
Because this diet really works.
We have testimonials reporting on its
success If you follow it exactly, you
should lose 10 pounds in 10 days.
No weight loss in the first four days
but you will suddenly drop 5 pounds
on the sth day. Thereafter lose one
pound a day until the I oth day. Then
you will lose 1 '/ 2 pounds every two
days until you get down to your proper
weight. Best of all, there will be no
) hunger pangs. Revised and enlarged,
this diet lets you stuff yourself with
formerly "forbidden" foods, such as
steaks trimmed with fat, roast or fried
chicken, gravies, mayonnaise, lobster
swimming in butter, bacon fats,
sausages and scrambled eggs and still
lose weight. The secret behind this
"quick weight loss" diet is simple. Fat
does not form fat. And the grapefruit
juice in this diet acts as a catalyst
(the "trigger"), to start the fat burning
process. You stuff yourself on the per
mitted food listed in the diet plan, and
still lose unsightly fat and excess body
fluids. A copy of this startling success
ful diet can be obtained by sending
$2 to
QUICK CO.

Money-back guarantee. If after try
ing the diet you have not lost 7 pounds
in the first seven days, another 6
pounds in the next 7 days, and 1 '/,
pounds every two days thereafter,
simply return the diet plan and your
$2 will be refunded promptly and
without argument. Tear out this mes
sage as a reminder. Decide now to
regain the trim attractive figure of your
youth.
