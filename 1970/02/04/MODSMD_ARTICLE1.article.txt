# Profs Challenge ROTC Decision
## 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
More than 100 signatures have
already been collected on faculty
oetitions requesting a special
meeting of the Academic Council
to consider the Academic Senate's
January 22 decision on ROTC.
A poll last night of faculty
members circulating the petitions
revealed that they have collected
substantially more than the 50
signatures needed for a special
meeting.
Coordinator of the circulation
Associate Professor of History
Harold Kahn, has said that he will
not file the petitions until every
faculty member has had a chance
to sign one. Rules require the
Academic Secretary to convene a
.special meeting of the Academic
Council within four weeks of the
filing of the petitions.
When the Academic Council is
convened, it can vote immediately
to uphold or reverse the Senate
decision to restore credit to
ROTC, or it can choose to
conduct the vote by mail. In the
past, crucial votes have been
conducted by mail, in order to
give all faculty members an
opportunity to cast a gallot.
Earlier Senate Votes
Signers of the petitions are
requesting the meeting with the
hopes of restoring the 1969
decisions of the Academic Senate
and Council. In February of that
year the Academic Senate voted
25 to 8 to deny credit to ROTC
courses. When the issue was
appealed to the Academic
Council, it upheld the Senate's
decision by a vote of 403 to 356.
This year, however, the Senate
reversed itself and adopted
President Pitzer's
recommendations, which would
restore credit to individual ROTC
classes with the approval of the
v Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
Prof. Kahn emphasizes that the
petitions represent a strong
commitment on the part of the
faculty members signing them to
the denial of credit for ROTC. It
is for this reason that a massive
number of signatures are being
sought, rather than simply the
minimum of 50.
Moratorium Plans
As faculty members seek to
deny credit to ROTC, the New
Moratorium is planning its own
strategy aimed at forcing ROTC
off campus. In a meeting last
night, the group voted to establish
the week of February 16 as
"Liberation Week," with a
number of activities directed at
bringing the ROTC issue to a lead.
High point of the week will be
"Insurgency Day," Wednesday,
Feb. 18.

Though no definite activities
have yet been decided upon, a
number of suggestions will be
considered. At last night's
meeting, D. McGuire, editor of
the Plain Rapper, suggested that
there be groups "roaming the
campus doing educational work"
in such areas as guerilla methods,
with "perhaps some skirmishes
with oppressive forces on
campus."
Michael Sweeney, editor of the
Chaparral (which will devote its
next edition to the issue of
ROTC), emphasized that
"Liberation Week" will be a
crucial period for the New
Moratorium. He feels that the real
issue is not whether there should
be academic credit for ROTC on
campus, but whether there should
be ROTC on campus at all.
Anti-ROTC Efforts
Sweeney suggested such
activities as auditing of ROTC
classes, attendance at on-campus
military drills, Gl's talks on
campus on "the oppression of the
Army," and any other events
which will "make it extremely
difficult for ROTC to function
that week."
The New Moratorium is now
concentrating on action outside
the governmental processes at
Stanford, as they plainly have
little faith that the Academic
Council will vote to eliminate
ROTC from the campus. Says
McGuire, "We know goddamn
well they aren't going to do things
unless they're up against a wall,
and when they're off the wall
they will undo them."

The full text of the Academic
Council petition is as follows:
Whereas the decision of the
Academic Senate of January 22, 1970
with respect to the continued presence
of ROTC at Stanford contravenes the
letter and spirit of the decisions
respectively of the Academic Senate in
its meeting of February 13, 1969 and
the Academic Council through its
referendum, the results of which were
announced May 2-3 1969; and
Whereas the retention, in any form,
of a military program of the United
States government which directly and
adversely affects the lives of large
numbers of innocent people is
repugnant to many members of the
community, and retention, with
academic credit, of ROTC training is
repugnant to a majority of the
Stanford faculty (as expressed in the
decisions of February and May 1969
referred to above); and
Whereas the initiative to reverse the
earlier, 1969, decisions of the
Academic Senate and the Academic
Council came not from within the
University but from the United States
6th Army Command:
We, the undersigned, do hereby
petition the Academic Secretary to call
a special meeting of the Academic
Council to consider the decision of the
Academic Senate of January 22 and at
a very minimum restore the prior
decisions of the Academic Council and
Senate, announced in 1969, with
respect to ROTC at Stanford.
