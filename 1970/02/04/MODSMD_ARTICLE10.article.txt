When fourteen Indian college students invaded Alcatraz on a cold,
foggy morning in the first part of November—claiming ownership "by
right of discovery," and citing an 1868 treaty allowing the Sioux
possession of unused federal lands—they seemed in a light-hearted
mood.
After establishing their beachhead, they told the press that they
had come there because Alcatraz already had all the necessary features
of a reservation: dangerously uninhabitable buildings; no fresh water;
inadequate sanitation; and the certainty of total unemployment.
They said they were planning to make the five full-time caretakers
wards of a Bureau of Caucasian Affairs, and offered to take this
troublesome real estate off the white man's hands for $24, payment
to be made in glass beads. The newspapers played it up big, calling the
Indians a "raiding party." When, after a 19-hour stay, the Indians
were persuaded to leave the island, everyone agreed that it had been a
good publicity stunt.
Bitter Irony
If the Indians had ever been joking about Alcatraz, however, it was
with the bitter irony that fills colonial subjects' discourse with the
mother-country. When they returned to the mainland, they didn't fall
back into the cigar-store stoicism that is supposedly the red man's
prime virtue. In fact, their first invasion ignited a series of meetings
and strategy-sessions; two weeks later they returned to the rock, this
time with a force of nearly 100 persons, a supply network, and the
clear intention of staying.
What had begun as a way of drawing attention to the position of
the contemporary Indian, developed into a plan for doing something
about it. And when the government, acting through the General
Services Administration, gave them a deadline for leaving, the Indians
replied with demands of their own: Alcatraz was theirs, they said, and
it would take U.S. Marshals to remove them and their families; they
planned to turn the island into a major cultural center and research
facility; they would negotiate only the mechanics of deeding over the
land, and that only with Interior Secretary Walter Hickel during a face
to face meeting. The Secretary never showed up, but the government's
deadlines were withdrawn.
"On this island, I saw not whether the people
had personal property, for it seemed to me
that whatever one had, they all took share of,
especially of eatable things."
Christopher Columbus

Alcatraz is Indian territory: The old warning to "Keep Off U.S.
Property" now reads "Keep Off Indian Property;" security guards
with red armbands stand near the docks to make sure it is obeyed.
Women tend fires beneath huge iron cauldrons filled with food, while
their kids play frisbee in what was once a convicts' exercise yard.
Some of the men work on the prison's wiring system or try to get
more cellblocks cleared out for the Indian people who are arriving
daily from all over the country; others sit fishing on the wharf with
hand-lines, watching quietly as the rip-tides churn in the Bay.
During the day, rock music plays over portable radios and a series
of soap operas flit across a TV; at night, the prison is filled with the
soft sounds of ceremonial drums and eerie songs in Sioux, Kiowa and
Navajo.

In the few weeks of its occupation, Alcatraz has become a mecca, a
sort of red man's Selma. Indian people come, stay a few days, and
then leave, taking with them a sense of wonderment that it has
happened. Middle-aged "establishment" Indians are there. They mix
with younger insurgents like Lehman Brightman (the militant Sioux
who heads a red power organization called the United Native
Americans), Mad-Bear Anderson (the Iroquois traditionalist from
upstate New York who fought to get the United Nations to stop the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' flooding of precious Seneca Indian
lands), Sid Mills (the young Yakima who demanded a discharge from
the Army after returning from Vietnam so that he could fight his real
war— against the state of Washington's denial of his people's fishing
rights), and A 1 Bridges (one of the leaders of the first Washington
fish-ins in 1964, who now faces a possible ten-year prison sentence for
defying the state Fish and Game Commission).
The composition of the ad hoc Indian community changes
constantly, but the purpose remains the same: to make Alcatraz a
powerful symbol of liberation springing out of the long American
imprisonment.
The people enjoy themselves, spending a lot of time sitting around
the campfire talking and gossiping. But there is a sense of urgency
beneath the apparent lassitude. Richard Oakes, a 27-year-old Mohawk
who worked in high steel construction before coming West to go to
college, is one of the elected spokesmen.
Sitting at a desk in the old Warden's Office, he talks about the hope
of beginning a new organization, the Confederacy of American Indian
Nations, to weld Indian groups all over the country into one body
capable of taking power away from the white bureaucracy. He
acknowledges that the pan-Indian movements which have sprung up
before have always been crushed.
"But time is running out for us," he says. "We have everything at
stake. And if we don't make it now, then we'll get trapped at the
bottom of that white world out there, and wind up as some kind of
Jack Jones with a social security number and that's all. Not just on
Alcatraz, but every place else, the Indian is in his last stand for
cultural survival."
The people on Alcatraz have entered a struggle on a large scale that
parallels the smaller, individual struggles for survival that many of
them have known themselves; it is the will to exist as individuals that
brought them together in determination to exist as a people.
"He is dispossessed in life, and unforgiving. He
doesn't believe in us and our civilization, and
so lie is our mystic enemy, for we push him
off the face of the earth. "
