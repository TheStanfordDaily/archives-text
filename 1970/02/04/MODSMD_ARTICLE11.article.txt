# Venceremos Brigade
## Group Aids Cuban Harvest 
### JOHN SLOAN 
Venceremos. . . . We Will Win!
For every organization their motto, or
slogan is a definite part of their philosophy,
and Veneceremos is no exception. The
Venceremos Brigade is an amorphous group of
radicals from the U.S. and other countries
who have gone or are going to Cuba to help
harvest the largest sugar cane crop ever
produced.
There are presently 216 Americans in Cuba
working in the Brigade. Of that number, 43
are from the Bay Area. In the second group
there will be about 600 Americans, with 150
from the Bay Area.
Half of the 150 going in this latter group
are Third World people and Blacks. There will
also be five Stanford students along with three
others from the surrounding region.
The Brigade is made up from and
represents, a very broad cross-section of the
population. Not only is it racially mixed
including Chicanos, Blacks, and Asians as well
as Whites, but it also includes people from
many occupations. There are a large number
of high school, junior college and college
students, as well as middle aged men and
working women and some ex-G.l.'s.
The first part of the Brigade left in
November and is due back around the middle
of February. They travelled through Mexico
City and were not interfered with by
American authorities. According to Nancy

Stien at the People's Office in Berkeley, "it
went beautifully. No attempts were made to
stop them; probably because the government
decided it was impossible."
The second group is due to leave at the end
of February, but in order to prevent
intervention the method that they will use to
get to Cuba is not being released. In the
meantime they are organizing into affinity
groups or cadres to get to know other
members and to go through an orientation.
According to one of those going, "We are
really beginning to work together, it's a great
experience."
Presently the organization is trying to raise
money to help cover the costs of those who
want to, but can't afford to go. The Cuban
government is helping out somewhat, but to
obtain the rest fund-raising projects such as
movies, dances and shows are being held in
the area.
According to Nancy Stien there has been
some communication with the group in Cuba
now, and the reports have been very
favorable. The American Brigade has been
awarded the title of a "Millionaire Brigade
which means that they have already picked a
million arrobas (25 pounds) of sugar cane, a
feat that supposedly few Cubans thought the
Americans would achieve.
While in Cuba the US Brigade has met with
five Brigade members from North Vietnam
and five from South Vietnam Many ot them

saw this as an important step in the
international concept of the fight against
American imperialism. "We now see the
machete the same as the gun- it's the same
battle," said Stein.
On Christmas Day, Fidel Castro, leader of
the Cuban revolution, came out can cut cane
with the American Brigade. Castro is said to
be personally spending a lot of his time
helping gather his record 10-million-ton
harvest. Castro hopes that with the economic
surplus he expects he can mechanize the sugar
industry and other parts of the economy.
After they had spent a full day in the fields,
Castro and the American workers went back
to the tents where the Brigade is staying, and
for the rest of the night there was an informal
question and answer period. Once their six
week work period is over, the workers will
have a two-week stretch in which they can
tour Cuba. But organizers stress that the
whole point of the trip was to work.
Plans are already being discussed for future
groups to go to Cuba not only to work in the
sugar fields but also to harvest other Cuban
products such as fruit and coffee. Those who
are working both in the United States and in
the Cuban fields see this as an effective
method of breaking down the American
restrictions against Cuba, but more
importantly as a means by which they can
combat american imperialsim and economic
control.
