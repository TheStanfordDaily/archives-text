# Indian 'Dreamers' Deserve Land, Says Anthropologist Spindler
## 
### LAURIE PRICE 
George Spindler's office is anything but the quiet retreat this kind,
fantastically busy anthropologist needs, and perhaps secretly covets.
The phone rings insistently. After returning the receiver to its cradle
the fourth time, Professor Spindler resumes without hesitation the
sentence interrupted minutes before.
"Any Indian claim for unused Federal land should be supported, as
partial redress for the continuing alienation of Indians from their own
land." This official-sounding statement is an elaboration of Spindler's
endorsement of a December petition favoring the transfer of Alcatraz
to the Indians for development as a cultural center.
In pursuit of knowledge rather than leisure, the Professor and his
similarly titled wife have spent over ten summers among the
"savages". Spindler says that while doing research he has
"encountered far less personal hostility from Indians than from
members of our own communities. Indians, unlide white people,
subscribe to very few generalizations about ethnic groups."
"Dreamers Without Power" he calls them. This is the name of the
book Spindler has just written about the Menomini of Northern
Wisconsin. This tribe, though very small, has troubles similar to those
of the mighty tribes whose names once struck terror in the heart of
the cavalry.
The Menomini are about to lose much of their cherished
timberland. The sacrifice must be made to appease the wild animal
"taxes." This beast is not indigenous to North America, say the
Indians, who claim that it was imported by white men, along with
disease and firewater.
Professor Spindler defines the Indians as "a submerged people
striving for fuller participation in the white-dominant system.
"Although there has been little direct maltreatment of Indians in
recent years, a lack of communication and understanding have
contributed greatly to the distressing conditions present in most tribal
settlements."
The statistics are telling: unemployment among Indians is ten times
the U.S. average; the drop-out rate is 50 to 80 percent; average age of
death on reservations is about twenty years less than the national
mean.
Confrontation with the white man tested Indian ingenuity to the
utmost. Warfare is, of course, the effort most often associated with
their resistence, but there were others.
The Peyote Cult was an attempt to promote unity among tribes
through revival of the ancient Indian custom of mystical group
experience. Tribes also gathered in the late 19th century for the ritual

Ghost Dance. It had two aims: to drive the white man into the sea,
and to bring the buffalo back, in that order of importance.
Instead, the Indians themselves have been driven to the sea, or at
least to the last refuge of Alcatraz Island. Inter-tribal unity is there, at
least, still strong. According to Spindler, there is more interest shown
in tribal rites, handcrafts, dance, and costume by Indians in the Bay
Area than by those on many reservations.
The distinctive identity that has always been attributed to Indian
culture is responsible for major differences between the "red power"
and "black power" drives, Spindler asserts. The black minority must
start by building a sense of itself, of its own unity; Indians are already
able to speak and work together.
"Indians have ethnic identity, but there is little tolerance for it in
our society. You can be a white man(we say to them) if you get a
haircut, shape up, find a job. But, you mustn't eat snake meat, your
dog, or have more than one wife. You must wholeheartedly attempt
to be like us to get any reward."
The aesthetic sensibilities of most Indians are offended by cities, it
seems. Spindler comments that "they would rather stay where they
have families and friends. Close human ties are more valuable to them
than economic betterment." Reservations, barren and poor though
they often are, appear pleasant and congenial relative to the towering
metropolis where jobs wait.
Anthropologist Spindler, tries to analyze the source of strength of
the beleagured Indian culture. "The unity they cherish is the sum of
their religion, their social system, and their natural surroundings. It is
not at all comparable to the isolated unities commanding the faith of
members of Christian communities."
Although constantly wary (and perhaps weary) of generalizations,
Professor Spindler offers this wide observation of the Indian behavior
ethic. "The difference between white men and Indians is that Indians
walk through the forests instead of cutting them down."
Isn't it ironic that Alcatraz, the new symbol of Indian unity, has
already been cemented in the white man's history?
