# New Coffee House Replaces Tangent
## 
### DICK BUXTON 
Culminating two years of
anticipation, a new community
coffee house and restaurant, Full
Circle, will open in Palo Alto
March first.
Members of the Mid-peninsula
Free University, who had the
original idea for the coffee house,
do not intend to limit the
membership or participation in
the coffee house to Free
University members. Rather, a
spokesman for the coffee house
stated, they wish to "Create an
atmosphere and an organization
which will attract into our
community new people of diverse
ages and interests.
Over 80 persons attended an
organizational meeting last
Sunday and established the Full
Circle as a cooperative
corporation with an 11-member
board of directors including high
school students, Stanford
students, a professor and local
citizens working in the area.
Occupying the building of the
now defunct Tangent, 117
University Ave. the new Full
Circle hopes to provide a meeting
place for old and new friends on
formal and informal occasions.
A main goal of the coffee house
restaurant will be to serve quality
food at fair prices. Besides serving
pizza and sandwiches the Full
Circle hopes to introduce a larger
menu offering daily casseroles for
both meat eaters and vegetarians,
full meals and some macrobiotic
and health foods.
Redecorating and remodeling
will take place during February.
Committee chairman Lee
Herzenberg urged Stanford
students and area residents who
are interested in finding out about
the Free Circle or interested in
working in remodeling to stop in
to talk and help.
Tools and material will be
needed to help in the remodeling
as well, she said.
A major problem now facing
the cooperative is funding.
Approximately $10,500 has been
raised through long term loans
and pledges of money by efforts
of Mark Jensen, Sherri Black, Tim
Coburn, Len Herzenberg and
others, but estimates of operating

expenses during the first three
months are over $15,000.
Members hope to obtain more
funds through loans and the sale
of cooperative membership shares.
A finance and cooperative
committee is presently working
on organization of pricing and
selling of shares.
The 11-man interim-board of
the Full Circle, elected Sunday,
will be responsible for all
decisions of the cooperative
during the next two weeks at
which time another general
meeting will take place to discuss
progress of the cooperative and
decide to maintain or change the
present board. All board and
committee meetings of Free Circle
are open to the public to attend
and to discuss decisions. Meetings
are posted 24 hours in advance on
the Free Circle bulletin board in
the building.
Free U. lawyers, Charlie
Constantinitis, Andy Cohen and
Jim Wolpman have given legal
advice on establishing a
cooperative and how it can be
structured to best serve the
community.
The 11 member board of
directors will consist of:
Mark Jensen, an ex-engineer
who will also be interim manager
during the first six months of
operation; John Aron, a
Menlo-Atherton High School
Student; Tim Coburn, a grad
student in genetics at Stanford;
Robb Crist, former Free U.
coordinator recently returned
from India; Leonard Herzenberg,
professor of genetics at Stanford;
Vic Lovell, a psychologist
interested in uses of psychodrama;
Nick Peyton, Free U. member;
Bruce Pollock, active member in
Grass Roots; Debbie Straham, a
Palo Alto High School student;
Larry Tessler, computer
programmer with the artificial
intelligence project at Stanford;
and Phil Williams, a
carpenter-contractor and property
manager.
The name Full Circle was
suggested by Jon Buckley who
stressed the importance of a name
which would be attractive and
symbolic of what the new coffee
house meant.

The Stanford Men's Glee Club,
under the direction of Robert
MacKinnon, will present
Cherubini's "Requiem in D
minor" as the featured work of
their winter concert at 3 p.m.
Sunday, Feb. 8, in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Tickets are available
at Tresidder box office and
Ticketron agencies. The
"Requiem," originally written for
men's voices, will be sung in
Latin. The work is divided into
seven sections: Introitus et. Kyrie,
Graduate, Dies Irae, Offertorium,
Sanclus, Pie .Jesu and Agnus DÂ«'i.
Accompanists will be Samuel

Swartz, organ; Edmund Correia
and Susan Pavick, piano; and John
Felder, timpani.
The 40-member group will also
perform two 16th century
madrigals: "April is in my
Mistress' Face" by Thomas
Morley and "Come Again, Sweet
Love doth now Invite" by John
Dowland. Other program
selections include "Invcni David,"
a motet by Anton Bruckner; the
folksong "Aura Lee ..; and "The
Testament," a 19th century
drinking song by Heinrich
Marschne.
