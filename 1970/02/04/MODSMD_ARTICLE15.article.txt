## Ophuls' 'La Ronde;' Lovely Revival 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Max Ophuls' "La Ronde," being revived
now through Saturday at San Francisco's
Surf Theatre, winks an eye at nearly all of
the rosey illusions and delusions the
cimema has had about romantic love since
the legendary "Kiss" appeared to mass
audiences just after the turn of the
century. Throughout his carreer as a
romantic expressionist, Ophuls achieved
considerable emotional mileage from his
lush presentations of passionate but
eventually hopeless and unlasting love.
Here, the director's romantic vignettes
are no less heated than before, but they are
set off by a near-Brechtian distancing
device which not only accentuates Ophuls'
theme of the mortality of love but which
very clearly reveals the director's personal

feelings toward both the subject matter
and the film itself.
The original cynical sketches by
Schnitzler, on which the film is based,
linked a series of lovers together through
no less an unsavory device as syphilis.
Ophuls, working in 1950, had to dispense
with the unmentionable disease but devised
Anton VValbrook's part as a sort of master
of ceremonies/emmisary traveling through
time. Walbrook operates, literally and
figuratively, the merry-go-round of life and
love which must keep spinning no matter
what the fortunes of its passengers.
When the characters pause to ask, "What
time is it?" their moment has already
passed and they have forfeited the blissful
position they once maintained, even if it
was only for a brief instant. Thus, the
lovers must inevitably lose, but not before

they have obtained the materials for
memory and the ideals for their illusions.
Within this framework, Ophuls is able to
make light of the standards for traditional
screen romances and the conditions under
which they are made, even if he himself is
in the process of creating an exquisite love
story. Ophuls carefully adheres to the
formula of blacking out just as a couple
descend upon a bed, but he then cuts to
the elegant Walbrook examining a ribbon
of film and cutting it with scissors while
adding sly commentary.
Or when a young man finally induces
the object of his affections into his
bedroom, he tells her of the many
normally capable soldiers he has known
whom, upon being given a chance with the
women of their dreams, are unable to
perform. Ophuls informs us that the young
man encounters the very same problem
with his current bedmate in having the
hand crank on Walbrook's carousel break
temporarily. Walbrook passes almost
magically from a realistic world of tell-tale
spot lights, backdrops and electrical wires
into the evocative world of studio sets
which achieve their substance and
illusionary nature through the use of the
very same lights and backdrops.
To effectively act out the romantic
interludes, Ophuls has obtained a dream
cast. Aside from the magnificent Walbrook,
Simone Signoret is stunning as the
prostitute who begins the circle of love
and, on the feminine side, Simone Simon
and Danielle Darrieux are particularly
inticing in their respective scenes. A
brilliant bed-time revelation session
between Miss Darrieux and her husband
takes some of the luster away from the
celebrated bedroom scene between Dyan
Cannon and Elliot Gould in "Bob & Carol
& Ted & Alice."
Among the males, Serge Reggiani,
Jean-Louis Barrault and Gerard Philipe
stand out as men moving too quickly
through time to even relish what they have
at present. To this end, Walbrook remarks.

"I adore the past—it is so much more
restful than the present and so much more
reassuring than the future."
Indeed, it is the swiftly moving, never
stopping nature of the passing of
time —expressed by the tentative natures of
the romances, by the metaphor of the
carousel and most expressively by Ophuls'
incessantly moving camera—which is most
distinctively displayed in "La Ronde." In a
way, it's a good thing that movies like this
aren't made anymore, but the memory of
the movie past invested in us by Ophuls'
masterpiece makes us wish, at least
temporarily, that they were.

cast. Aside from the magnificent Walbrook,
Simone Signoret is stunning as the
prostitute who begins the circle of love
and, on the feminine side, Simone Simon

inticing in their respective scenes. A
brilliant bed-time revelation session
between Miss Darrieux and her husband
takes some of the luster away from the
celebrated bedroom scene between Dyan
Cannon and Elliot Gould in "Bob & Carol

restful than the present and so much more
reassuring than the future."
Indeed, it is the swiftly moving, never
stopping nature of the passing of
time —expressed by the tentative natures of
the romances, by the metaphor of the
carousel and most expressively by Ophuls'
incessantly moving camera—which is most
distinctively displayed in "La Ronde." In a

the movie past invested in us by Ophuls'
masterpiece makes us wish, at least
temporarily, that they were.


CIRCLE OF LOVE-Simone Signoret and Gerard Pliili |>«* are among the many stars in Max
Ophuls' masterpiece LA RONUE, now Ix-ing revived at (lie Surl Theatre.
Max Ophuls' "La Ronde," being revived
now through Saturday at San Francisco's
Surf Theatre, winks an eye at nearly all of
the rosey illusions and delusions the
cimema has had about romantic love since
the legendary "Kiss" appeared to mass
audiences just after the turn of the
century. Throughout his carreer as a
romantic expressionist, Ophuls achieved
considerable emotional mileage from his
lush presentations of passionate but
eventually hopeless and unlasting love.
Here, the director's romantic vignettes
are no less heated than before, but they are
set off by a near-Brechtian distancing
device which not only accentuates Ophuls'
theme of the mortality of love but which
very clearly reveals the director's personal

feelings toward both the subject matter
and the film itself.
The original cynical sketches by
Schnitzler, on which the film is based,
linked a series of lovers together through
no less an unsavory device as syphilis.
Ophuls, working in 1950, had to dispense
with the unmentionable disease but devised
Anton VValbrook's part as a sort of master
of ceremonies/emmisary traveling through
time. Walbrook operates, literally and
figuratively, the merry-go-round of life and
love which must keep spinning no matter
what the fortunes of its passengers.
When the characters pause to ask, "What
time is it?" their moment has already
passed and they have forfeited the blissful
position they once maintained, even if it
was only for a brief instant. Thus, the
lovers must inevitably lose, but not before

they have obtained the materials for
memory and the ideals for their illusions.
Within this framework, Ophuls is able to
make light of the standards for traditional
screen romances and the conditions under
which they are made, even if he himself is
in the process of creating an exquisite love
story. Ophuls carefully adheres to the
formula of blacking out just as a couple
descend upon a bed, but he then cuts to
the elegant Walbrook examining a ribbon
of film and cutting it with scissors while
adding sly commentary.
Or when a young man finally induces
the object of his affections into his
bedroom, he tells her of the many
normally capable soldiers he has known
whom, upon being given a chance with the
women of their dreams, are unable to
perform. Ophuls informs us that the young
man encounters the very same problem
with his current bedmate in having the
hand crank on Walbrook's carousel break
temporarily. Walbrook passes almost
magically from a realistic world of tell-tale
spot lights, backdrops and electrical wires
into the evocative world of studio sets
which achieve their substance and
illusionary nature through the use of the
very same lights and backdrops.
