# Reader vs Rustin

Editor, THE DAILY:
It is fine in this day of free expression to
let Critic Supreme Terry Rustin 'blow his
horn.' Certainly no acknowledged critic
will ever write an entirely positive article
about any musical performance. But why
lambast the horns so mercilessly? Does not
Mr. Rustin realize that Maestro Krips
directs, with note for note precision, the
entire interpretation of the symphony?
Once the critic is told where any blame for
such "belches and total disregard for the
score" should be placed, let me try to give
the writer an appreciation for new and
innovative renderings of an original work.
The Seventh was written for Beethoven's
times, now let it be played for ours'. A
lively brass section, truly a product of the
twentieth century, is a component too
often muffled by other sections.
If Mr. Rustin desires a piece to be played
identically each time, maybe we should
give him one record and allow him to play
it until it wears out. He might even
frequent the Music Lab, a place he has all
too often avoided for his biology lab.
