## Hearst's Rare Attic Vases On View 
### BONNIE KOEHLER 
The Stanford Art Museum is now showing a rare
collection of Greek Attic Vases from the Randolph
A. Hearst Collection in Hillsborough.
The exhibit is located in the second floor gallery
of the Museum at the top of the center stairs. The
twenty-seven vases, ranging in size from a few inches
to almost three feet were selected from over 450 in
the William Randolph Hearst Collection. They are
on loan by Mr. and Mrs. Randolph A. Hearst. The
Stanford showing commemorates the 90th annual
meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America
held in San Francisco in December.
Dr. Isabelle K. Raubitschek, lecturer in Art
History at Stanford, wrote the fully illustrated
exhibition catalogue.
A broad spectrum of examples is represented in
the concise selection of pieces. The 27 vases
represent almost the entire history of Greek Attic
Vase painting in the 6th and sth centuries B.C.
The vases are important in themselves as being
beautiful, as well historically significant. A little
background will be helpful to the viewer.
The term "Attic", refers to the province of
ancient Greece surrounding Athens, Attica, where
the pottery was produced. Work from this district
was the most highly prized of its time, successfully
rivaling other districts, especially Corinth,
artistically and commercially.
The vases were made to be practical, useful, and
beautiful. They were proudly signed by the
individual artists, some of whose signatures are
preserved. The various shaped containers were used
for drinking cups, for water pitchers which the
Greek women carried on their heads, craters for
mixing wine, amphorae as large containers for grain,
and lekythi for storing perfumed oil.
The pottery was made from the clay found in the
ground arough Athens. The artists of Greece were
technically able to produce many colors, but chose
to use earth colors, red and black, for simplicity of
design, economy and durability. The colors are
produced through a three step firing process, that is
so clever and simple it has only recently been
successfully analyzed and reconstructed.
The clay pots are thrown on a wheel and then the
designs are painted in a diluted peptized clay slip of
the same color as the pot. In the second step of the
firing process, at a different temperature, the
thinner peptized clay slip of the designs turns and
stays dark shiny black and contrasts sharply with
the reddish background, the result of the third
reoxidizing phase. The surface is then burnished to
shine.
The end product is a heavy ceramic container
that is either "red figure"; red exposed clay design
on a black background, or "black figure"; shiny

black subjects on a light background.
Historically Important
The Greek Attic Vases are historically important
because they are the only graphic art surviving from
the 6th and sth centuries B.C. Greek murals and
easel paintings done on wood have not lasted. The
vases are really the only substantial examples of
Greek painting available today.
The humans and gods pictured on the vases also
illustrate Greek myths, and reveal information
about daily life. Some of the recognizable figures
are Athena, Iris, Hermes, Eros, Pegasos, and the
Minotaur.
The vases illustrate a study of drawing as it
developed from expressing just two, to three
dimensions. All the figures on the pots are shown in
profile. As the work moves into the sth century
B.C. there are evidences that the Greek artists were
becoming aware of such concepts as basic distance
relationships within a scene, and foreshortening.
These drawings testify to the fact that the Greeks
almost discovered the vanishing point in perspective,
a concept that wasn't actually developed until the
Renaissance.
The rarest piece in the Hearst Collection is the
Sicilian Red Figured Skyphoid Pyxis (no. 24). It is
unique because it is illustrated with a scene which
may have originated in a large mural.
All the other vases are illustrated with designs
worked out specifically for the curved surface of the
pot. The three diminsional surfaces pose specific
problems of design for the decorator. The Greek
artist solved these admirably by using disciplined
color, simple silohuetted shapes and border designs.
The illustrations follow the narrative of myths and
everyday scenes around the surface of the vase.
Their graphic skill would challenge any
contemporary designer.
Nouveau Borders
The intricate borders are fascinating. They
outline the illustrations, and decorate the handles,
shoulders and edges of the pots. The traditional
interlocking Greek "key" design is often used along
with similar patterns which rely on repitition for
visual rythm. There are patterns of stylized curved
waves, dots, lines, squares, and loops. The neatly
curved and intangled lines of the vine designs look
like turn of the century Art Nouveau, and indeed
students of that school studying in Paris were
inspired by many just such ancient Greek vases in
the Louvre.
The vases are displayed in the Museum in glass
cases so that they can be seen from all sides, even
from beneath if you sit on the floor. The Stanford
Museums located on Museum Way, off Palm Drive,
behind the biology buildings. It is open Tuesday
through Friday, 10 to 5, and Saturday and Sunday
1 to 5.

The end product is a heavy ceramic container
that is either "red figure"; red exposed clay design
on a black background, or "black figure"; shiny

black subjects on a light background.
Historically Important
The Greek Attic Vases are historically important
because they are the only graphic art surviving from
the 6th and sth centuries B.C. Greek murals and
easel paintings done on wood have not lasted. The
vases are really the only substantial examples of
Greek painting available today.
The humans and gods pictured on the vases also
illustrate Greek myths, and reveal information
about daily life. Some of the recognizable figures
are Athena, Iris, Hermes, Eros, Pegasos, and the
Minotaur.
The vases illustrate a study of drawing as it
developed from expressing just two, to three
dimensions. All the figures on the pots are shown in
profile. As the work moves into the sth century
B.C. there are evidences that the Greek artists were
becoming aware of such concepts as basic distance
relationships within a scene, and foreshortening.
These drawings testify to the fact that the Greeks
almost discovered the vanishing point in perspective,
a concept that wasn't actually developed until the
Renaissance.
The rarest piece in the Hearst Collection is the
Sicilian Red Figured Skyphoid Pyxis (no. 24). It is
unique because it is illustrated with a scene which
may have originated in a large mural.
All the other vases are illustrated with designs
worked out specifically for the curved surface of the
pot. The three diminsional surfaces pose specific
problems of design for the decorator. The Greek
artist solved these admirably by using disciplined
color, simple silohuetted shapes and border designs.
The illustrations follow the narrative of myths and
everyday scenes around the surface of the vase.
Their graphic skill would challenge any
contemporary designer.
Nouveau Borders
The intricate borders are fascinating. They
outline the illustrations, and decorate the handles,
shoulders and edges of the pots. The traditional
interlocking Greek "key" design is often used along
with similar patterns which rely on repitition for
visual rythm. There are patterns of stylized curved
waves, dots, lines, squares, and loops. The neatly
curved and intangled lines of the vine designs look
like turn of the century Art Nouveau, and indeed
students of that school studying in Paris were
inspired by many just such ancient Greek vases in
the Louvre.
The vases are displayed in the Museum in glass
cases so that they can be seen from all sides, even
from beneath if you sit on the floor. The Stanford
Museums located on Museum Way, off Palm Drive,
behind the biology buildings. It is open Tuesday
through Friday, 10 to 5, and Saturday and Sunday
1 to 5.
The Stanford Art Museum is now showing a rare
collection of Greek Attic Vases from the Randolph
A. Hearst Collection in Hillsborough.
The exhibit is located in the second floor gallery
of the Museum at the top of the center stairs. The
twenty-seven vases, ranging in size from a few inches
to almost three feet were selected from over 450 in
the William Randolph Hearst Collection. They are
on loan by Mr. and Mrs. Randolph A. Hearst. The
Stanford showing commemorates the 90th annual
meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America
held in San Francisco in December.
Dr. Isabelle K. Raubitschek, lecturer in Art
History at Stanford, wrote the fully illustrated
exhibition catalogue.
A broad spectrum of examples is represented in
the concise selection of pieces. The 27 vases
represent almost the entire history of Greek Attic
Vase painting in the 6th and sth centuries B.C.
The vases are important in themselves as being
beautiful, as well historically significant. A little
background will be helpful to the viewer.
The term "Attic", refers to the province of
ancient Greece surrounding Athens, Attica, where
the pottery was produced. Work from this district
was the most highly prized of its time, successfully
rivaling other districts, especially Corinth,
artistically and commercially.
The vases were made to be practical, useful, and
beautiful. They were proudly signed by the
individual artists, some of whose signatures are
preserved. The various shaped containers were used
for drinking cups, for water pitchers which the
Greek women carried on their heads, craters for
mixing wine, amphorae as large containers for grain,
and lekythi for storing perfumed oil.
The pottery was made from the clay found in the
ground arough Athens. The artists of Greece were
technically able to produce many colors, but chose
to use earth colors, red and black, for simplicity of
design, economy and durability. The colors are
produced through a three step firing process, that is
so clever and simple it has only recently been
successfully analyzed and reconstructed.
The clay pots are thrown on a wheel and then the
designs are painted in a diluted peptized clay slip of
the same color as the pot. In the second step of the
firing process, at a different temperature, the
thinner peptized clay slip of the designs turns and
stays dark shiny black and contrasts sharply with
the reddish background, the result of the third
reoxidizing phase. The surface is then burnished to
shine.

The Stanford Art Museum is now showing a rare
collection of Greek Attic Vases from the Randolph
A. Hearst Collection in Hillsborough.
The exhibit is located in the second floor gallery
of the Museum at the top of the center stairs. The
twenty-seven vases, ranging in size from a few inches
to almost three feet were selected from over 450 in
the William Randolph Hearst Collection. They are
on loan by Mr. and Mrs. Randolph A. Hearst. The
Stanford showing commemorates the 90th annual
meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America
held in San Francisco in December.
Dr. Isabelle K. Raubitschek, lecturer in Art
History at Stanford, wrote the fully illustrated
exhibition catalogue.
A broad spectrum of examples is represented in
the concise selection of pieces. The 27 vases
represent almost the entire history of Greek Attic
Vase painting in the 6th and sth centuries B.C.
The vases are important in themselves as being
beautiful, as well historically significant. A little
background will be helpful to the viewer.
The term "Attic", refers to the province of
ancient Greece surrounding Athens, Attica, where
the pottery was produced. Work from this district
was the most highly prized of its time, successfully
rivaling other districts, especially Corinth,
artistically and commercially.
The vases were made to be practical, useful, and
beautiful. They were proudly signed by the
individual artists, some of whose signatures are
preserved. The various shaped containers were used
for drinking cups, for water pitchers which the
Greek women carried on their heads, craters for
mixing wine, amphorae as large containers for grain,
and lekythi for storing perfumed oil.
The pottery was made from the clay found in the
ground arough Athens. The artists of Greece were
technically able to produce many colors, but chose
to use earth colors, red and black, for simplicity of
design, economy and durability. The colors are
produced through a three step firing process, that is
so clever and simple it has only recently been
successfully analyzed and reconstructed.
The clay pots are thrown on a wheel and then the
designs are painted in a diluted peptized clay slip of
the same color as the pot. In the second step of the
firing process, at a different temperature, the
thinner peptized clay slip of the designs turns and
stays dark shiny black and contrasts sharply with
the reddish background, the result of the third
reoxidizing phase. The surface is then burnished to
shine.
The end product is a heavy ceramic container
that is either "red figure"; red exposed clay design
on a black background, or "black figure"; shiny

black subjects on a light background.
Historically Important
The Greek Attic Vases are historically important
because they are the only graphic art surviving from
the 6th and sth centuries B.C. Greek murals and
easel paintings done on wood have not lasted. The
vases are really the only substantial examples of
Greek painting available today.
The humans and gods pictured on the vases also
illustrate Greek myths, and reveal information
about daily life. Some of the recognizable figures
are Athena, Iris, Hermes, Eros, Pegasos, and the
Minotaur.
The vases illustrate a study of drawing as it
developed from expressing just two, to three
dimensions. All the figures on the pots are shown in
profile. As the work moves into the sth century
B.C. there are evidences that the Greek artists were
becoming aware of such concepts as basic distance
relationships within a scene, and foreshortening.
These drawings testify to the fact that the Greeks
almost discovered the vanishing point in perspective,
a concept that wasn't actually developed until the
Renaissance.
The rarest piece in the Hearst Collection is the
Sicilian Red Figured Skyphoid Pyxis (no. 24). It is
unique because it is illustrated with a scene which
may have originated in a large mural.
All the other vases are illustrated with designs
worked out specifically for the curved surface of the
pot. The three diminsional surfaces pose specific
problems of design for the decorator. The Greek
artist solved these admirably by using disciplined
color, simple silohuetted shapes and border designs.
The illustrations follow the narrative of myths and
everyday scenes around the surface of the vase.
Their graphic skill would challenge any
contemporary designer.
Nouveau Borders
The intricate borders are fascinating. They
outline the illustrations, and decorate the handles,
shoulders and edges of the pots. The traditional
interlocking Greek "key" design is often used along
with similar patterns which rely on repitition for
visual rythm. There are patterns of stylized curved
waves, dots, lines, squares, and loops. The neatly
curved and intangled lines of the vine designs look
like turn of the century Art Nouveau, and indeed
students of that school studying in Paris were
inspired by many just such ancient Greek vases in
the Louvre.
The vases are displayed in the Museum in glass
cases so that they can be seen from all sides, even
from beneath if you sit on the floor. The Stanford
Museums located on Museum Way, off Palm Drive,
behind the biology buildings. It is open Tuesday
through Friday, 10 to 5, and Saturday and Sunday
1 to 5.
