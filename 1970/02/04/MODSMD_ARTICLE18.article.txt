# Mural Hoop Week Dotted With Upsets
## 
### SCOTT BURNS 
There were many upsets last
week in IM basketball
competition, but the biggest was
when the Delta Chi's beat the Phi
Delts, 56-46, Bob Appleby got 19
points as he led his hustling
teammates to a victory over the
well-balanced and much taller Phi
Delts.
Another upset came when Ted
Bleymaier got 10 of his 16 points
in the overtime period to help the
Betas defeat the Alpha Sigs 52-51.
The Beta victory overshadowed a
fine 21 point show put on by
Tom Watson of the Alpha Sigs.
The DU's almost upset the
Delts and were within 1 point of
their opponents until the last two
minutes when the Delts pulled
away to win 42-34. The DU's had
kept the Delts under control by
outrebounding them throughout
the game, but in the last two
minutes, two key DU players
fouled out, and the Delts went
wild. Brian Hewitt led the way as
he got most of his 18 points
during that period.
Loro Loses
Cardenal barely defeated Loro
in the big battle of the best
freshman teams 53-52. Bob Pete
and Jesse Freitas were the big
guns for Cardenal with 16 and 15
points apiece, while Bill Wiley hit
13 for the losers.
Another strong frosh team,
Branner, continued to roll as they

crushed Donner 76-36. They were
again paced by their three big
gunnersâ€”Jay Holf (15), Chris
Martin (16), and Steve Hernandez
(15).
Tomorrow the championship of
the "L" should be decided when
El Toro meets Cuadro. Both are
undefeated with 3-0 marks, and
the game should turn out to be a
real scoring duel, for Cuadro is led
by freshman Bill Reed who is the
leading IM scorer, averaging a
phenomenal 26 points per game.
Toro has lots of weapons to rely
on for they have six men
averaging over nine points a game.
The Ambulance Chasers are
mending their wounds after being
killed in their debut by the
Marauders, 91-22. Brad Taylor
poured in 26 big ones for the
victors, and it looks like his team
might give the Panthers some
competition to win their league
title.
Horowitz Hot
Rodney's Rods, another
off-campus team, was led by the
invinceable Steve Horowitz, who
pumped in 17 points, as they won
their second game of the season
62-33 over the Cosmics.
Durand won two tough games
last weeks over Larkin (56-52)
and Lassen (53-50) as they
showed a powerful, well-balanced
offense which has four players
scoring in double figures.
