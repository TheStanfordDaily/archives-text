# Now Crenshaw
## Injuries Strike Again 
### 
Two more ailing bodies were
added to the list of injured
Stanford wrestlers last weekend
when (he Indians came away from
the San Francisco State
invitational on Saturday.
Already decimated with a
number of small hurts, Stanford
now pits its perfect 7-0 record
against a powerful UC-Berkeley
team Friday night at 7:30 in
Encina Pavilion without the
services of Terry Crenshaw (177),
one of the best grapplers on the
coast.
Crenshaw, who had suffered
only one loss in his collegiate
career, severely pulled a groin
muscle in the city and figures to
be out of action until the Pac-8
championships March 6-7.
Dave Thomas (134) also was hit
with muscle trouble, straining
both his arms and having to
forfeit his match for third place.
Thomas, however, should be
ready to go again against the
Bears, and Coach Dave Reed hints
that Dave Kopolow (118) might
be back a week sooner than
expected after his blood disorder.
But even if Kopolow comes
back at near full strength, Indian
chances of beating Cal without
Crenshaw are considerably
weakened. Stanford and
Berkeley—if both are at full
strength—figure to have a strong
battle for second place in the
conference behind Oregon State.

Len Smith (150) was Stanford's
highest finisher in the invitational
meet, taking second place behind
Humboldt State's Doug Fern who
defeated him 4-0 in the finals.
In addition to Crenshaw,
Kopolow and Thomas, Bill Ross
(167) has back trouble; Ray
Williams (190) has knee problems
which might keep him out of the
Cal encounter; Lee Fair
(heavyweight) also has a sore
back; and freshman Jerry Ross
(150) currently has a strained
elbow.

But Reed says his team will be
as ready as possible for the Bears,
although his starting line-up will
be changed considerably.
Reed's main concern now,
although he'd like to protect
Stanford's undefeated record if
possible, is to have all his men in
top shape for the Pac-8 meet. "In
the last five years Stanford has
never been in the top four," he
says, "but this year I see third or
even second, if everybody is
healthy."

battle for second place in the
conference behind Oregon State.

Len Smith (150) was Stanford's
highest finisher in the invitational
meet, taking second place behind
Humboldt State's Doug Fern who
defeated him 4-0 in the finals.
In addition to Crenshaw,
Kopolow and Thomas, Bill Ross
(167) has back trouble; Ray
Williams (190) has knee problems
which might keep him out of the
Cal encounter; Lee Fair
(heavyweight) also has a sore
back; and freshman Jerry Ross
(150) currently has a strained
elbow.

But Reed says his team will be
as ready as possible for the Bears,
although his starting line-up will
be changed considerably.
Reed's main concern now,
although he'd like to protect
Stanford's undefeated record if
possible, is to have all his men in
top shape for the Pac-8 meet. "In
the last five years Stanford has
never been in the top four," he
says, "but this year I see third or
even second, if everybody is
healthy."
