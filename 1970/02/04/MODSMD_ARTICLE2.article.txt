## Agnew, Critics Argue Vietnamization 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
critics of President Nixon's
Vietnam policy accused the
administration yesterday of
creating a national euphoria about
the war, but Vice President Spiro
T. Agnew said they were just
"casting about aimlessly" for an
issue.
The setting for a new assault on
U.S. war policy was a familiar
one, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, which opened three
days of public heaJngs on a series
of resolutions proposing new U.S.
approaches.
Sen. Harold E. Highes, D-lowa,
said he was concerned "not only
about the national euphoria, but
s about the way it was created."
"First you pistol whip the news
media, and then you commandeer
it for political purposes," Hughes
said.
Agnew's retort: "I think that
some of the opposition party
people who have dropped all their
eggs in one basket of attempting
to discredit the United States
objectives in Vietnam have found
such a little bit of public support
that now they're casting about
aimlessly for some way to try to
turn the gun back on the
administration."
Sen. J. W. Fulbright, D-Ark.,
said he was puzzled by statements
that the war is no longer a
political issue. Fulbright, the
committee chairman, said he
hoped the hearings would help
determine whether the Nixon
policy of turning combat over to

Vietnamese troops is "more
promising than a renewed effort
to negotiate a compromise
settlement in the Paris talks."
"The people are with the
President on this," Agnew told
newsmen after briefing
Republican senators on his Asian
tour. "And no amount of self
serving statements by opposition
senators are going to change
that."
Agnew said "it's going to take a
while" for South Vietnam to
ready its forces to take over all
ground combat duties.
"I think we're on the right
course and if the people stick with
the President we'll be out of
there."
The hearings are the first since
the administration's counter
attack in the wake of last fall's
antiwar protests brought it high
ratings in public opinion polls.
Panther Fijjht
NEW YORK (AP) - A bomb-plot
hearing involving 13 Black
Panthers was disrupted yesterday
for the second straight day, as a
courtroom melee spread into a
corridor amid shouting, kicking
and fisticuffs.
Two court attendants and a
detective suffered minor injuries.
A defense attorney claimed one of
the Panthers was beaten with a
blackjack. A former defendant, in
court as a spectator, was arrested
after police said he kicked the
detective in the chest.

As he had on Monday, State
Supreme Court Justice John M.
Murtagh recessed the pretrial
hearing for a cooling-off period,
while spectators shook their fists
and screamed insults at him.
After the scuffling had subsided
and the courtroom was cleared,
Murtagh returned to the bench to
hear a defense lawyer press
concern over the physical safety
of the Panther defendants.
Several outbursts from
defendants marked an afternoon
session, of the hearing. It got
underway after two of the
defendants, Richard Moore, 24, a
self-employed painter, and Joan
Bird, 20, a nursing student,
complained they were beaten by
court officers during the earlier
disorders.
Murtagh, noting injuries to the
two court officers and the
detective, replied:
"We know what started it. The
court professes profound
consideration for those
maintaining order, and the
officers do it at the risk of their
personal safety. I also observed
how counsels' behavior brought
about the disorder."

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP)-
As 200 policemen looked on, an
estimated 1,500 students
continued yesterday to protest
peacefully the dismissal of a
professor at the University of
California at Santa Barbara.
No clashes or confrontations
were reported. The students
wandered from point to point on
the campus, staging impromptu
rallies with the aid of a portable
public address system.
The demonstrations began last
week when the administration
announced it would not renew the
contract of Dr. William Allen, 33,
a popular assistant professor of
anthropology, alter the current
term.

Allen told a noontime rally that
negotiations with the
administration concerning his
contract had been fruitless.
Law enforcement officers -
city, county and state state -
maintained the vigil they began
early Monday morning. They kept
open corridors leading to the
administration building and
groups of officers followed the
demonstrators around campus.
Sheriff James Webster had said
the officers would remain on
campus until "peace and order are
restored," and there was no
indication Tuesday when they
would be withdrawn.
School Boycott
(AP) — White pupils quit classes in
two Mississippi systems, leaving an
all-black enrollment, and dozens
of white teachers in Georgia
boycotted classes yesterday as
several Southern school districts
struggled with court-ordered
integration plans.
More than 300,000 pupils were
out of class in Florida, as schools
in four counties remained closed
while officials tried to resolve a
dilemma centering around forced
busing of pupils.
There was additional confusion
in Louisiana and Alabama.
Gov. Claude Kirk of Florida
planned to go on statewide
television to talk about the issue
of forced busing' to achieve
desegregation.
In Mississippi, two school
districts-Tunica County and
India nolo became completely
black as some 1,000 white pupils
stayed home or enrolled in white
private schools.
In Indianola, 39 of 41 white
teachers resigned and began
teaching in a private school.
In Louisiana, six school
districts remain closed. They are
the parishes of DeSots, Madison,
Concordia, Ascension, East
Feliciana and West Feliciana. Most

were expected to be operating
later in the week.
A black boycott remained
effective in some portions of
Iberville Parish.
There was improvement in
attendance in Jefferson County,
Ala.-Birmingham schools.
But Mobile, Bessemer and
Fairfield, Ala., systems have not
tried to put new plans into effect
yet.
Celibacy
VATICAN CITY (AP) - Pope
Paul VI ordered the Netherlands'
eight Roman Catholic bishops
yesterday to withdraw their
support of a proposed change in
the church's celibacy laws that
would permit priests to marry.
In a letter to the Vatican
secretary of state, Jean Cardinal
Villot, Pope Paul said it was
"indispensable" that the Dutch
bishops revise their thinking and
accept the church's ban on
married priests.
Refusal by the eight bishops
would be tantamount to
disobedience of the Pope and
could constitute a schism from
Rome, in the view of some here.
They referred to the Pope's
statement that he was willing to
consider requests that married
men of a "mature age" or an
"advanced age" as the Italian
translation of the French text put
it- be ordained in areas suffering
"an extreme shortage of priests."
The Dutch experts said this
signalled the first crack in Pope
Paul's firm stand to uphold the
celibacy laws, but it would not
offer a short-term solution to the
problem of a shortage of priests.
Pope Paul's order did not give
much hope, however, that even
the concession to consider
ordaining aged, married men
would be full acceptable. "We
cannot hide the fact that such an
eventuality would raise grave
reserve on our part."

Panther Fijjht
NEW YORK (AP) - A bomb-plot
hearing involving 13 Black
Panthers was disrupted yesterday
for the second straight day, as a
courtroom melee spread into a
corridor amid shouting, kicking
and fisticuffs.
Two court attendants and a
detective suffered minor injuries.
A defense attorney claimed one of
the Panthers was beaten with a
blackjack. A former defendant, in
court as a spectator, was arrested
after police said he kicked the
detective in the chest.

As he had on Monday, State
Supreme Court Justice John M.
Murtagh recessed the pretrial
hearing for a cooling-off period,
while spectators shook their fists
and screamed insults at him.
After the scuffling had subsided
and the courtroom was cleared,
Murtagh returned to the bench to
hear a defense lawyer press
concern over the physical safety
of the Panther defendants.
Several outbursts from
defendants marked an afternoon
session, of the hearing. It got
underway after two of the
defendants, Richard Moore, 24, a
self-employed painter, and Joan
Bird, 20, a nursing student,
complained they were beaten by
court officers during the earlier
disorders.
Murtagh, noting injuries to the
two court officers and the
detective, replied:
"We know what started it. The
court professes profound
consideration for those
maintaining order, and the
officers do it at the risk of their
personal safety. I also observed
how counsels' behavior brought
about the disorder."

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP)-
As 200 policemen looked on, an
estimated 1,500 students
continued yesterday to protest
peacefully the dismissal of a
professor at the University of
California at Santa Barbara.
No clashes or confrontations
were reported. The students
wandered from point to point on
the campus, staging impromptu
rallies with the aid of a portable
public address system.
The demonstrations began last
week when the administration
announced it would not renew the
contract of Dr. William Allen, 33,
a popular assistant professor of
anthropology, alter the current
term.

Allen told a noontime rally that
negotiations with the
administration concerning his
contract had been fruitless.
Law enforcement officers -
city, county and state state -
maintained the vigil they began
early Monday morning. They kept
open corridors leading to the
administration building and
groups of officers followed the
demonstrators around campus.
Sheriff James Webster had said
the officers would remain on
campus until "peace and order are
restored," and there was no
indication Tuesday when they
would be withdrawn.
School Boycott
(AP) — White pupils quit classes in
two Mississippi systems, leaving an
all-black enrollment, and dozens
of white teachers in Georgia
boycotted classes yesterday as
several Southern school districts
struggled with court-ordered
integration plans.
More than 300,000 pupils were
out of class in Florida, as schools
in four counties remained closed
while officials tried to resolve a
dilemma centering around forced
busing of pupils.
There was additional confusion
in Louisiana and Alabama.
Gov. Claude Kirk of Florida
planned to go on statewide
television to talk about the issue
of forced busing' to achieve
desegregation.
In Mississippi, two school
districts-Tunica County and
India nolo became completely
black as some 1,000 white pupils
stayed home or enrolled in white
private schools.
In Indianola, 39 of 41 white
teachers resigned and began
teaching in a private school.
In Louisiana, six school
districts remain closed. They are
the parishes of DeSots, Madison,
Concordia, Ascension, East
Feliciana and West Feliciana. Most

were expected to be operating
later in the week.
A black boycott remained
effective in some portions of
Iberville Parish.
There was improvement in
attendance in Jefferson County,
Ala.-Birmingham schools.
But Mobile, Bessemer and
Fairfield, Ala., systems have not
tried to put new plans into effect
yet.
Celibacy
VATICAN CITY (AP) - Pope
Paul VI ordered the Netherlands'
eight Roman Catholic bishops
yesterday to withdraw their
support of a proposed change in
the church's celibacy laws that
would permit priests to marry.
In a letter to the Vatican
secretary of state, Jean Cardinal
Villot, Pope Paul said it was
"indispensable" that the Dutch
bishops revise their thinking and
accept the church's ban on
married priests.
Refusal by the eight bishops
would be tantamount to
disobedience of the Pope and
could constitute a schism from
Rome, in the view of some here.
They referred to the Pope's
statement that he was willing to
consider requests that married
men of a "mature age" or an
"advanced age" as the Italian
translation of the French text put
it- be ordained in areas suffering
"an extreme shortage of priests."
The Dutch experts said this
signalled the first crack in Pope
Paul's firm stand to uphold the
celibacy laws, but it would not
offer a short-term solution to the
problem of a shortage of priests.
Pope Paul's order did not give
much hope, however, that even
the concession to consider
ordaining aged, married men
would be full acceptable. "We
cannot hide the fact that such an
eventuality would raise grave
reserve on our part."
WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
critics of President Nixon's
Vietnam policy accused the
administration yesterday of
creating a national euphoria about
the war, but Vice President Spiro
T. Agnew said they were just
"casting about aimlessly" for an
issue.
The setting for a new assault on
U.S. war policy was a familiar
one, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, which opened three
days of public heaJngs on a series
of resolutions proposing new U.S.
approaches.
Sen. Harold E. Highes, D-lowa,
said he was concerned "not only
about the national euphoria, but
s about the way it was created."
"First you pistol whip the news
media, and then you commandeer
it for political purposes," Hughes
said.
Agnew's retort: "I think that
some of the opposition party
people who have dropped all their
eggs in one basket of attempting
to discredit the United States
objectives in Vietnam have found
such a little bit of public support
that now they're casting about
aimlessly for some way to try to
turn the gun back on the
administration."
Sen. J. W. Fulbright, D-Ark.,
said he was puzzled by statements
that the war is no longer a
political issue. Fulbright, the
committee chairman, said he
hoped the hearings would help
determine whether the Nixon
policy of turning combat over to

Vietnamese troops is "more
promising than a renewed effort
to negotiate a compromise
settlement in the Paris talks."
"The people are with the
President on this," Agnew told
newsmen after briefing
Republican senators on his Asian
tour. "And no amount of self
serving statements by opposition
senators are going to change
that."
Agnew said "it's going to take a
while" for South Vietnam to
ready its forces to take over all
ground combat duties.

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP)-
As 200 policemen looked on, an
estimated 1,500 students
continued yesterday to protest
peacefully the dismissal of a
professor at the University of
California at Santa Barbara.
No clashes or confrontations
were reported. The students
wandered from point to point on
the campus, staging impromptu
rallies with the aid of a portable
public address system.
The demonstrations began last
week when the administration
announced it would not renew the
contract of Dr. William Allen, 33,
a popular assistant professor of
anthropology, alter the current
term.

Allen told a noontime rally that
negotiations with the
administration concerning his
contract had been fruitless.
Law enforcement officers -
city, county and state state -
maintained the vigil they began
early Monday morning. They kept
open corridors leading to the
administration building and
groups of officers followed the
demonstrators around campus.
Sheriff James Webster had said
the officers would remain on
campus until "peace and order are
restored," and there was no
indication Tuesday when they
would be withdrawn.
School Boycott
(AP) — White pupils quit classes in
two Mississippi systems, leaving an
all-black enrollment, and dozens
of white teachers in Georgia
boycotted classes yesterday as
several Southern school districts
struggled with court-ordered
integration plans.
More than 300,000 pupils were
out of class in Florida, as schools
in four counties remained closed
while officials tried to resolve a
dilemma centering around forced
busing of pupils.
There was additional confusion
in Louisiana and Alabama.
Gov. Claude Kirk of Florida
planned to go on statewide
television to talk about the issue
of forced busing' to achieve
desegregation.
In Mississippi, two school
districts-Tunica County and
India nolo became completely
black as some 1,000 white pupils
stayed home or enrolled in white
private schools.
In Indianola, 39 of 41 white
teachers resigned and began
teaching in a private school.
In Louisiana, six school
districts remain closed. They are
the parishes of DeSots, Madison,
Concordia, Ascension, East
Feliciana and West Feliciana. Most

were expected to be operating
later in the week.
A black boycott remained
effective in some portions of
Iberville Parish.
There was improvement in
attendance in Jefferson County,
Ala.-Birmingham schools.
But Mobile, Bessemer and
Fairfield, Ala., systems have not
tried to put new plans into effect
yet.
Celibacy
VATICAN CITY (AP) - Pope
Paul VI ordered the Netherlands'
eight Roman Catholic bishops
yesterday to withdraw their
support of a proposed change in
the church's celibacy laws that
would permit priests to marry.
In a letter to the Vatican
secretary of state, Jean Cardinal
Villot, Pope Paul said it was
"indispensable" that the Dutch
bishops revise their thinking and
accept the church's ban on
married priests.
Refusal by the eight bishops
would be tantamount to
disobedience of the Pope and
could constitute a schism from
Rome, in the view of some here.
They referred to the Pope's
statement that he was willing to
consider requests that married
men of a "mature age" or an
"advanced age" as the Italian
translation of the French text put
it- be ordained in areas suffering
"an extreme shortage of priests."
The Dutch experts said this
signalled the first crack in Pope
Paul's firm stand to uphold the
celibacy laws, but it would not
offer a short-term solution to the
problem of a shortage of priests.
Pope Paul's order did not give
much hope, however, that even
the concession to consider
ordaining aged, married men
would be full acceptable. "We
cannot hide the fact that such an
eventuality would raise grave
reserve on our part."
WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
critics of President Nixon's
Vietnam policy accused the
administration yesterday of
creating a national euphoria about
the war, but Vice President Spiro
T. Agnew said they were just
"casting about aimlessly" for an
issue.
The setting for a new assault on
U.S. war policy was a familiar
one, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, which opened three
days of public heaJngs on a series
of resolutions proposing new U.S.
approaches.
Sen. Harold E. Highes, D-lowa,
said he was concerned "not only
about the national euphoria, but
s about the way it was created."
"First you pistol whip the news
media, and then you commandeer
it for political purposes," Hughes
said.
Agnew's retort: "I think that
some of the opposition party
people who have dropped all their
eggs in one basket of attempting
to discredit the United States
objectives in Vietnam have found
such a little bit of public support
that now they're casting about
aimlessly for some way to try to
turn the gun back on the
administration."
Sen. J. W. Fulbright, D-Ark.,
said he was puzzled by statements
that the war is no longer a
political issue. Fulbright, the
committee chairman, said he
hoped the hearings would help
determine whether the Nixon
policy of turning combat over to

Vietnamese troops is "more
promising than a renewed effort
to negotiate a compromise
settlement in the Paris talks."
"The people are with the
President on this," Agnew told
newsmen after briefing
Republican senators on his Asian
tour. "And no amount of self
serving statements by opposition
senators are going to change
that."
Agnew said "it's going to take a
while" for South Vietnam to
ready its forces to take over all
ground combat duties.
"I think we're on the right
course and if the people stick with
the President we'll be out of
there."
The hearings are the first since
the administration's counter
attack in the wake of last fall's
antiwar protests brought it high
ratings in public opinion polls.
Panther Fijjht
NEW YORK (AP) - A bomb-plot
hearing involving 13 Black
Panthers was disrupted yesterday
for the second straight day, as a
courtroom melee spread into a
corridor amid shouting, kicking
and fisticuffs.
Two court attendants and a
detective suffered minor injuries.
A defense attorney claimed one of
the Panthers was beaten with a
blackjack. A former defendant, in
court as a spectator, was arrested
after police said he kicked the
detective in the chest.

As he had on Monday, State
Supreme Court Justice John M.
Murtagh recessed the pretrial
hearing for a cooling-off period,
while spectators shook their fists
and screamed insults at him.
After the scuffling had subsided
and the courtroom was cleared,
Murtagh returned to the bench to
hear a defense lawyer press
concern over the physical safety
of the Panther defendants.
Several outbursts from
defendants marked an afternoon
session, of the hearing. It got
underway after two of the
defendants, Richard Moore, 24, a
self-employed painter, and Joan
Bird, 20, a nursing student,
complained they were beaten by
court officers during the earlier
disorders.
Murtagh, noting injuries to the
two court officers and the
detective, replied:
"We know what started it. The
court professes profound
consideration for those
maintaining order, and the
officers do it at the risk of their
personal safety. I also observed

Celibacy
VATICAN CITY (AP) - Pope
Paul VI ordered the Netherlands'
eight Roman Catholic bishops
yesterday to withdraw their
support of a proposed change in
the church's celibacy laws that
would permit priests to marry.
In a letter to the Vatican
secretary of state, Jean Cardinal
Villot, Pope Paul said it was
"indispensable" that the Dutch
bishops revise their thinking and
accept the church's ban on
married priests.
Refusal by the eight bishops
would be tantamount to
disobedience of the Pope and
could constitute a schism from
Rome, in the view of some here.
They referred to the Pope's
statement that he was willing to
consider requests that married
men of a "mature age" or an
"advanced age" as the Italian
translation of the French text put
it- be ordained in areas suffering
"an extreme shortage of priests."
The Dutch experts said this
signalled the first crack in Pope
Paul's firm stand to uphold the
celibacy laws, but it would not
offer a short-term solution to the
problem of a shortage of priests.
Pope Paul's order did not give
much hope, however, that even
the concession to consider
ordaining aged, married men
would be full acceptable. "We
cannot hide the fact that such an
eventuality would raise grave
reserve on our part."
WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
critics of President Nixon's
Vietnam policy accused the
administration yesterday of
creating a national euphoria about
the war, but Vice President Spiro
T. Agnew said they were just
"casting about aimlessly" for an
issue.
The setting for a new assault on
U.S. war policy was a familiar
one, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, which opened three
days of public heaJngs on a series
of resolutions proposing new U.S.
approaches.
Sen. Harold E. Highes, D-lowa,
said he was concerned "not only
about the national euphoria, but
s about the way it was created."
"First you pistol whip the news
media, and then you commandeer
it for political purposes," Hughes
said.
Agnew's retort: "I think that
some of the opposition party
people who have dropped all their
eggs in one basket of attempting
to discredit the United States
objectives in Vietnam have found
such a little bit of public support
that now they're casting about
aimlessly for some way to try to
turn the gun back on the
administration."
Sen. J. W. Fulbright, D-Ark.,
said he was puzzled by statements
that the war is no longer a
political issue. Fulbright, the
committee chairman, said he
hoped the hearings would help
determine whether the Nixon
policy of turning combat over to

Vietnamese troops is "more
promising than a renewed effort
to negotiate a compromise
settlement in the Paris talks."
"The people are with the
President on this," Agnew told
newsmen after briefing
Republican senators on his Asian
tour. "And no amount of self
serving statements by opposition
senators are going to change
that."
Agnew said "it's going to take a
while" for South Vietnam to
ready its forces to take over all
ground combat duties.
"I think we're on the right
course and if the people stick with
the President we'll be out of
there."
The hearings are the first since
the administration's counter
attack in the wake of last fall's
antiwar protests brought it high
ratings in public opinion polls.
Panther Fijjht
NEW YORK (AP) - A bomb-plot
hearing involving 13 Black
Panthers was disrupted yesterday
for the second straight day, as a
courtroom melee spread into a
corridor amid shouting, kicking
and fisticuffs.
Two court attendants and a
detective suffered minor injuries.
A defense attorney claimed one of
the Panthers was beaten with a
blackjack. A former defendant, in
court as a spectator, was arrested
after police said he kicked the
detective in the chest.

As he had on Monday, State
Supreme Court Justice John M.
Murtagh recessed the pretrial
hearing for a cooling-off period,
while spectators shook their fists
and screamed insults at him.
After the scuffling had subsided
and the courtroom was cleared,
Murtagh returned to the bench to
hear a defense lawyer press
concern over the physical safety
of the Panther defendants.
Several outbursts from
defendants marked an afternoon
session, of the hearing. It got
underway after two of the
defendants, Richard Moore, 24, a
self-employed painter, and Joan
Bird, 20, a nursing student,
complained they were beaten by
court officers during the earlier
disorders.
Murtagh, noting injuries to the
two court officers and the
detective, replied:
"We know what started it. The
court professes profound
consideration for those
maintaining order, and the
officers do it at the risk of their
personal safety. I also observed
how counsels' behavior brought
about the disorder."
UCSB Quiet
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP)-
As 200 policemen looked on, an
estimated 1,500 students
continued yesterday to protest
peacefully the dismissal of a
professor at the University of
California at Santa Barbara.
No clashes or confrontations
were reported. The students
wandered from point to point on
the campus, staging impromptu
rallies with the aid of a portable
public address system.
The demonstrations began last
week when the administration
announced it would not renew the
contract of Dr. William Allen, 33,
a popular assistant professor of
anthropology, alter the current
term.

Allen told a noontime rally that
negotiations with the
administration concerning his
contract had been fruitless.
Law enforcement officers -
city, county and state state -
maintained the vigil they began
early Monday morning. They kept
open corridors leading to the
administration building and
groups of officers followed the
demonstrators around campus.
Sheriff James Webster had said
the officers would remain on
campus until "peace and order are
restored," and there was no
indication Tuesday when they
would be withdrawn.
School Boycott
(AP) — White pupils quit classes in
two Mississippi systems, leaving an
all-black enrollment, and dozens
of white teachers in Georgia
boycotted classes yesterday as
several Southern school districts
struggled with court-ordered
integration plans.
More than 300,000 pupils were
out of class in Florida, as schools
in four counties remained closed
while officials tried to resolve a
dilemma centering around forced
busing of pupils.
There was additional confusion
in Louisiana and Alabama.
Gov. Claude Kirk of Florida
planned to go on statewide
television to talk about the issue
of forced busing' to achieve
desegregation.

districts-Tunica County and
India nolo became completely
