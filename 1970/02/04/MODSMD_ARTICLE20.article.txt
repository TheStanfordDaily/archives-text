# Tribe Nine Accepts Gifts, Triumphs 3-2
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
Unable to produce enough runs
to win by themselves, Stanford
resorted to accepting gifts
yesterday afternoon at Sunken
Diamond.
Tied 2-2 with the Philadelphia
Philly Rookies going into the
bottom of the ninth, the Indians
converted a Philly error and three
walks into the winning run. With
two out, first baseman Mike
Nelson was walked, forcing home
Hank Snider who had reached
first on a throwing error by
shortstop Albert Strane.
All in all, the ninth inning
provided some interest to what
otherwise hadn't been a
terrifically exciting opener. In the
top half of the frame the Phillies
had also threatened, but pitcher
Steve Dunning put out the fire
and subsequently got the win.
The Indians didn't exactly tear
the cover off the ball at the plate,
but did have enough sense to
bunch three of their four hits in
one inning, the second.
Nelson led off by rifling a single
to right, moved up on an infield
hit by Dunning (who started at
third), and scored on a shot to
right by sophomore second
baseman Phil Kelber. Dunning was
eliminated at the plate when
Borchers hit back to the box, but
Kelber scored when the catcher
lost the ball.
The runs were a good thing,
too, because Philly pitcher Cliff
Ballou retired the next 12 men he
faced. Southpaw Jim Coate hurled
the middle three innings for the
Tribe, giving up one run. The

game was played before a relaxed
gathering of about 100 fans,
including a small army of
professional scouts.
Stanford faces USF here Friday
at 2.
