# Good Defense Paces Icemen
## 
### 
Humilated earlier 9-3 and 7-0
by the Berkeley Juniors,
Stanford's hockey club came back
last week in its finest performance
of the year to tie the same club,
4-4.
The hard-skating Indians played
their best defense of the season,
allowing fewer goals than in any
previous game, and also rallied
from a deficit for the first time.
Paul Tittman blasted in a pair
of goals, one in the first period
and one in the third. Ed Leonard
and Doug Adams also tallied for
Stanford and Tom Love and Pat
Baldwin each notched two assists.
Goalie Gary Aitken played his
usual excellent game, kicking out
47 Berkeley shots, 20 of which
came in the frantic final period as
the Juniors battled to try and pull
out a victory.
The Indians continue to
improve for the first hockey "big
game" with the University of
California which will be a
preliminary game before the
Oakland Seals of the NHL take on
the Pittsburg Penguins at the
Oakland Arena, Feb. 21.
