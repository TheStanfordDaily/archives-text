# University Chooses Personnel Director
## 
### 
It was announced yesterday
that the position of Personnel Di
rector for Stanford's 5,344 em
ployees, has been filled by Robert
Nelson, former personnel admin
istrator for the Linear Accelerator
Center.
Nelson will have control of the
management of the entire
non-academic staff, ranging from
the Physical Plant and Food
Service workers to the employees
of SLAC and the School of
Medicine.
After receiving his M.A. in
Political Science at the University
of Chicago, Nelson worked for 5
years in the Dept. of Navy. He
then joined the administrative
staff at Lawrence Radiation Lab
at the University of California,
remaining for 11 years until
taking the job at SLAC.
Since assuming his new position
Jan. 1, Nelson has perceived two
distince changes from his former
job. The number of employees is

four times greater than the total
staff at SLAC, with a wider
classification of employees. There
is also more involvement in
employee relations, particularly
with employee groups such as the
Stanford Employee Association
and USE (United Stanford
Employees).
What is the new director's role?
Nelson sees it as helping "to
create a positive employment
climate here at the University."
Communication is his major
emphasis â€” two-way
communication between the
Personnel Office and all Stanford
employees.
Other areas of activity include
continuing minority employment,
and in-depth study into the
possibility of child-care facilities
although Nelson stresses that at
present there is little information
on funding, operation, and the
role of the University in such a
project.
