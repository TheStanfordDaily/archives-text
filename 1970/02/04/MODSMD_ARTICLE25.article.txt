# Ex-MFA Students Head SRT Cast
## 
### 
Good actors are hard to find
and when they are found, it's not
easy to let them go.
The Stanford Repertory
Theater was in a quandary last
June when some of the finest
master of fine arts students to
appear at Stanford graduated.
How to bring them back?
With a masterful combination
of job offerings - SRT acting
fellow, lecturer in the drama
department, SRT guest artist - the
theater managed to persuade some
of the best talent of the MFA
class of 1969 to return.
Mary Staton Geldard, Gene
Parseghian, Richard Rekow, and
Kurtwood Smith, back together
for the first time since last season,
take leading roles in "Shadow of
Heroes," opening tonight at 8 for
a three-week run in Memorial
Hall.
Mrs. Geldard portrays Julia
Rajk, the courageous woman
credited with triggering the 1956
Hungarian Revolution in Robert
Ardrey's documentary drama.
Smith plays her husband, Laszlo
Rajk, a communist underground
leader during World War II who
rose to Hungary's top government
post before he was tricked into a
false confession of treason and
executed.
Rekow plays the role of Janos
Kadar, a one-time friend of the
Rajks' and currently Premier of
Hungary. Parseghian portrays the
Author of narrator of the moving
drama.
After graduating last June, Mrs.
Geldard, Rekow, and Smith
appeared in leading roles at the
California Shakespeare Festival in
Los Gatos. Parseghian traveled to
Greeley, Colo, where he appeared
at the Little Theater of the
Rockies.
This year Mrs. Geldard is a
lecturer in Stanford's Drama
Department where she taught
advanced acting to undergraduates
and MFA students. Rekow, and
SRT acting fellow, teaches acting
to freshmen and sophomores.
Parseghian, also an acting
fellow, works with the community
relations department of SRT as
head of the "Out-Rep" program.
"Out-Rep" takes one-act plays to
dorms, schools, and service clubs.
Smith teaches in the drama

department at Canada College in
Woodside. He is appearing in
"Shadow of Heroes" as an SRT
guest artist.
The four worked together in
many Stanford productions
during the two years they were
MFA students. Rekow describes
the special kind of acting that has
resulted.
"In 'Shadow of Heroes' I've
finally come to realize what
emsemble playing really means.
The test of it is in the validity of
our scenes together. We've
developed a trust and confidence
in each other as well as a respect
for each other's work that wasn i
possible before."
The cast list of SRT's current
offering might look to some like
an alumni roster. It is.
