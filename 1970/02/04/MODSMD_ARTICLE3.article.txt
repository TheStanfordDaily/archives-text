## Ombudsman: Troubleshooter 
### SUSAN MAAS 
"I'm here to see anybody with
a complaint," says Professor of
Psychiatry Herant Katchadourian,
describing his new position as
Ombudsman.
"The task is two-fold,"
Katchadourian continues, "first, •
to help redress grievances of
anyone in the Stanford
community; second, to act as a
facilitator, when students have a
plan but don't know how to
proceed.
"The position is specifically
made vague. We want it to be
flexible, so it won't just become
one more bureaucratic station on
top of other bureaucratic
stations," he explains.
The new position has already
been instituted at many colleges,
such as Cornell and Berkeley, and
was recommended last year by a
sub-committee of the Committee
of 15.
Committee Members
The committee consisted of
Prof. Sidney D. Drell, deputy
director of SLAC; Anne S. Miner
of the General Secretary's Office;
Patrick Shea, member of the
Coucil of Presidents; and
Associate Provost Robert S.
Rosenzweig.
The Ombudsman's duties as an
all-University trouble shooter
were outlined by the Committee

of 15 in these terms: He will work
to "protect the rights of the
Stanford community from
injustice, abuses and gross
inefficiency, from unnecessary
delay and complications in the
administration of the rules and
regulations, and from

inconsistency, unfairness,
unresponsiveness, and prejudice in
the individual's experience with
University activities ..."
Katchadourian, who takes
office today, will be available
three days of the week—Wednes
day, Thursday, and Friday—to
hear grievances, either by
appointment or walk-in.
Choice of Alternatives
After hearing a complaint, he
may refer the person to a more
appropriate agency, undertake
investigation of the problem
himself, decide that the problem
is either unimportant or cannot be
solved at the time.
To begin, Katchadourian plans
a review of existing grievance
procedures, in order to determine
whether they are uniform
throughout all the schools or not,
and to see how effective they are.
Then he will work on the problem
of how to "maximally advertise
existing systems."
Besides working on the
complaints of others, the
Ombudsman may also initiate his
own. Not being a part of the
administration, he does not have
power to actually make changes,
but is able to take grievances to
the right people and work for
change.
University Problems
"I feel the position could be

very useful," Katchadourian
comments. "I accepted the
appointment because I want to be
exposed to the problems of the
University, particularly of the
students."
Since this is only a part-time
position, Katchadourian will
continue teaching in the
Psychiatry Department, offering
among other things a spring
course called "Human Sexuality."
His experience for the position
also includes administrative work
as coordinator of the resident
training program.
Katchadourian's new office will
be in the administrative annex
building located between
Memorial Church and Engineering
Corner. His campus telephone
extensions are 3628 and 3629.
