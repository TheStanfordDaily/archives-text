# SRT Program Ends Due To Budget Cuts
## 
### 
The Stanford Repertory
Theater will come to an end at the
close of the current season in
May, it was announced today by
Michael Barry, chairman of the
Department of Speech and
Drama.
The present acute financial
crisis of the University makes it
impossible for the University to
carry the deficit of a large-scale
production organisation.
"Stanford's Drama Department
will continue to produce plays as
part of its training program,"
Barry said, "although production
will be on a reduced scale and
must be self-supporting. As in the
present well attended season,
plays will be directed, designed,
and performed by students and
faculty in the Drama Department.
"The master of fine arts
program, which gives professional
training to actors, directors,

designers, and technicians, will
continue. The University is
endeavoring to maintain the
present fellowship support."
The current season will
continue as planned. (See story on
page 6.) The budget cuts have
eliminated all administrative staff
positions. There will be no acting
fellows and the technical staff will
be reduced.
Stanford Repertory Theater
began in 1965 with a three-year
grant from the Rockefeller
Foundation of $300,000 to
support a professional company
of 10 actors and two acting
fellows. Box office receipts were
intended to cover technical and
administrative salaries as well as
costs of production. As with the
Summer Festivals, and like most
other non-profit performing arts
organizations, a deficit was a
continuing part of the op
eration.
Lack of a good theater building
contributed to SRT's problems.
The large theater, Memorial Hall,
which seats 1700, is prohibitively
expensive in which to produce,
while the Little Theater, which
seats only 197, cannot produce
enough income to support itself.
At the end of SRT's second
season in 1967, an attempt was
made to reduce this deficit and
stretch remaining funds by
reducing the professional
company to three senior actors
and three acting fellows. In the
1968-69 season, SRT became a
non- pr o fessional company
employing as guest artists one
professional actress, Maidie
Norman, to perform and teach,
and one professional director,
Michael Barry, former head of the
Drama Department of BBC
television. Barry became chairman
of the Speech and Drama
Department in mid-season
1968-69. Special grants from the
trustees and from the School of
Humanities and Sciences
supported the operating deficit.
These funds are no longer
available.
