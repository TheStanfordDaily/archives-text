# More Women To Be Admitted--Gradually
## 
### ANNE EGGEBROTEN 
The Ratio, a seemingly
immutable fact of life at Stanford,
shows signs of diminishing
strength in the next decade,
starting with a small increase in
the number of women next year,
according to Dean of Students
Peter Bulkeley.
However, all changes will be
incremental, due to the problems
which would be created in
housing and distribution of majors
by a sudden shift in the student
population.
There is "some likelihood" of
50 to 100 additional women being
admitted in next year's freshman
class, Bulkeley states. Careful
assessments of the total
enrollment and projections of
income now point toward
admission of a frosh class of 1400,
as opposed to the normal 1300
with 850 men and 450 women.
The worth of increasing the
proportion of undergraduate
women is agreed upon by the
members of the admissions
objectives committee who have
the problem under consideration.
Male-Female Balance
"Very nearly 50-50" is the
undergraduate ratio Bulkeley
would select under ideal
conditions (without the problems
of housing and distribution of
majors) while Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon would put it
"short of equal numbers."
Hargadon cites concern over
the fate of the many highly
qualified women who are turned
away as the primary impetus
toward changing the admissions
ratio.
"You begin to wonder where
all the qualified girls are going,"
he exclaims. "Maybe we are
stultifying the women."
Equity of Women
The increased concern for the
equity of women as well as other
minority groups is also responsible
for the trend toward admitting
more women, according to
Provost Richard Lyman. He adds
the third factor that a natural
ratio would be socially more
healthy.
Despite general agreement on
the value of increasing the number
of women on campus, practical
considerations prohibit any
sudden changes and complicate
the outlook for the future.
A large increase in women and
decrease of men would flood
some departments such as French
and Art, while leaving engineering
departments with unused faculty
and facilities. Gradual changes
over a long period of time would
allow the departments to adjust
Effect On Mousing
The other major area of

pragmatic difficulty is in housing.
The University has a commitment
to provide student housing. A
largt: increase in freshmen (who
are required to live on campus)
would necessitate either evicting
present residents or building new
dorms, according to Bulkeley.
Overbuilding and having
vacancies in the future is also a
danger, he states. This would
cause either raising room bills or
requiring more students to live on
campus.
Hargadon cites the present
popularity of living on campus
with the new coed dorms, as
compared to several years ago
when many students wanted to
live off.
Long Range Changes
"A rash of schools are
responding too quickly to
superficial changes in the
atmosphere," he states, urging
that the University make only
long range changes and aim for
flexibility.
Underscoring the questions of
housing and distribution of majors
is the general financial strain now
present in university planning.
Behind practical considerations
lie philosophical questions which
must also be answered. Hargadon
sees the major questions as:
If the only way to increase the
number of women is to increase
the total size of the undergraduate
student body, is it worth it?
If the only way to increase the
number of women is to decrease
the number of undergraduate
men, is it worth it?
Conflicting Values
"One can be very sympathetic
with the desire for increasing
women enrollment, but ultimately
you face values of equal weight
which simply conflict," he
explains.
Asks Lyman, "How big do you
want Stanford University to get?'
The overall campus ratio is
meaningless, according to
Bulkeley, since the graduate
school is overwhelmingly male.
Only the undergraduate school is
an equal ratio even a possibility.
Until 1933 the number of
women at Stanford was limited to
500. Mrs. Leland Stanford made
this stipulation in 1899 when the
number of women had reached
463 (out of 1,153 students) and
was climbing. She feared that the
institution would develop into a
women's college.
The limit of 500 was changed
in 1933 when the number of men
had climbed to 2,800. The
trustees elected to follow the
same proportion between men
and women as existed in 1899
with 40% women.
