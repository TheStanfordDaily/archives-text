# False Prophet
## Ecologists In Name Only 
### Ned Groth 
In its mad rush to jump onto
the "Ecology" bandwagon, the
Daily apparently never bothered
to find out what ecology is all
about. When people like Rolf
Eliassen and William Baxter are
called "ecologists," the word has
lost all meaning.
The way the term has been
thrown around, even Richard
Nixon and Ronald Reagan could
be called "ecologists." This is
utter bullshit, and extremely
dangerous.
There is more at stake than a
semantic nicety. To lump men
like Eliassen, Baxter, Ehrlich,
Lederberg, and Gaylord Nelson
together in the bag labeled
"Ecologists" is to obscure
tremendous fundamental
differences in the training,
knowledge, world-view, approach
to problems, and priorities for
solutions that each of these men
might advocate.
An ecologist is (1) a biologist
by training, and (2) one who
specializes in the study of
interrelationships among the
multitude of living organisms and
their living and non-living
environment. He is, if you will, a
student of the "balance of
nature," and seeks to understand
the way that balance is
maintained by natural processes,
or disrupted by external forces.
In the process of deciding how
to bring the human species back
into balance with its environment,
one would expect the knowledge
and advice of ecologists to play a
central role in any policy
decisions. Unfortunately, it
doesn't work that way.
Politicians, businessmen, and
technocrats—most of them lacking
even the most elementary
understanding of the natural
world—sit in the driver's seat.
Sudden Perception
It has suddenly been perceived
by the mass media that the
decisions of the powerful elite in
this country have been altering
the quality of our environment
for the worse. Because of this
perception, many leading figures
who have been concerned with
pollution for some time have
rallied under the banner of
"Ecology," or have been lumped
together this way by the media.
So the Daily calls Rolf Eliassen an
"ecologist," (a title he himself
disavows), and sets him up as a
"Prophet of Hope."
Rolf Eliassen is no ecologist. He
is a technocrat of the first order, a
representative of the strongest
anti-ecology force in the world
today: The corporate-techno
cratic-government complex that
defines the goals and priorities of
American society. The hope he
prophesies is utterly false.
Eliassen is a Professor of
Environmental Engineering, a
trade as far removed from
Ecologist as Nome is from Tierra
del Fuego. As an engineer, he has
been trained to seek a
technological solution for every
problem. As an environmental
engineer, his task is to manipulate
the environment to serve human
needs, a total antithesis of
studying the requirements and
restrictions of the ecologically
feasible.
The technocratic approach flies
in the face of the obvious truth
that technological "solutions" to
oilier problems have caused the
environmental crisis we now face.

But technology alone did not
cause oil spills, pesticide
poisoning, or smog. The use of
technology has been guided by
the goals and priorities of the
people who control it—the
corporations and the government,
for the most part. The direction
of those priorities has been clear;
rape the earth, for a profit.
Efficient Rape
Eliassen's suggestions for
"solutions" are designed primarily
to make the rape more efficient.
Our present pollution problems
are seen as the result of
mismanagement or insufficient
technological expertise in the
past. Eliassen's message is that we
can solve any of these problems if
we have the will—and the money.
This analysis is utterly false. We
can see how wrong Eliassen is by
examining the ecological
consequences of the "solutions"
he advocates. First, he suggests
that solid wastes can be burned,
and the heat used to generate
electrical energy. Not only do we
do away with piles of garbage, but
we get something back in the
bargain. It sounds like a good
idea, until you realize that it
would just convert garbage into
air pollution.
At the same time, by offering a
disposal outlet for solid wastes, it
would support, if not accelerate,
the increasing use of throw-away
items. Think how many trees it
takes to make all those cardboard
boxes, disposable diapers, and
Sunday newspapers . . . and then
consider that, by increasing the
demand for such burnables,
Eliassen's plan would speed the
destruction of what forests we
have left.
On the question of nuclear
power plants, I quote verbatim
from Margie Wolf's interview with
Eliassen, in the Daily of Jan. 22:
' "To meet need for an eightfold
increase in power plants by the
end of the. century, Eliassen
proposes nuclear fuel.
"When placed carefully, he
stated, nuclear plants would not
unwisely change the ecological
balance through extra heat."
This categorical denial of
adverse effects of thermal
pollution of the magnitude
envisioned must rest on naive
faith or profound ignorance; no
biologist would be willing to make
such a statement. All the evidence
to date is weighted heavily toward
the harmful impact of heated
water upon living systems; the

consequences of eight times the
present amount of heat pollution
in the L.A. area will experience in
the next 30 years. What sort of
changes would create that
"need?" Will the population of
the L.A. basin be eight times as
large (60 million) by the year
2000? Or will economic and
industrial growth account for the
vast increases in electricity
consumption?
Population increase means
more land covered with tract
houses, more cars on more
freeways spewing out more smog.
The industrial growth that would
provide these people's jobs would
involve the processing of materials
ripped from the earth at eight
times the present rate to produce
products that are useless or
lethal. All of this economic
activity would cause tremendous
increases in the pollution of the
area. Where would the raw
materials come from? Southeast
Asia? Latin America?
Eliassen's line on nuclear power
plants ignores the problems of
nuclear wastes and other
radioactive pollutants. The whole
picture he paints (at least, as
relayed by the media) is virtually
identical io the phony propaganda
put out by the nuclear power
in dustry—corporations like
Westinghouse, GE, General
Dynamics, Lockheed, DuPont,
and Gulf Oil, among others. Even
the vignettes about warm water
being good for marine life appear
in the promotional literature of
these companies.
Solutions & Demands
The "solutions" envisioned by
Eliassen have nothing to do with
the demands of the environment
for a restoration of ecological
balance. In fact, they work
directly against real ecological
needs, profit, growth and the
expanded and more efficient
exploitation of natural resources
are the guidelines of modern
state-capitalism.
It appears that Eliassen agrees
with and supports the goals, even
though they are patently
anti-survival.
As a member of the President's
Scientific Advisory Council, the
message that comes from Eliassen,
and from others who share his
outlook, is just what the men at
the top want to hear: We can
solve all our environmental
problems, make profits in the
process, and keep the economy
growing at a fantastic rate, if we

just do it wisely.
Roll' Eliassen is a false prophet
when he says that technology,
guided by the priorities of those
now in power, can solve the
ecological crisis. What's more, he
is only one of hundreds of such
"experts" who are coming to be
viewed as the saviors who will
ward off environmental disaster.
We are at a critical juncture in
time: within the next five years,
the framework within which we
will try to solve our
environmental problems will be
set. At this point, the corporate
technocrats are in power and will
be calling the shots, based on the
economic needs of their
companies, rather than on any
real understanding of what
survival requires.
