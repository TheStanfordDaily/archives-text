A Change for the Better
Edttor, THE DAILY:
Teaching twice at Stanford in
France, first in 1962 and then in
1969, has allowed me to observe
the evolution of one overseas
campus. My conclusions are
almost totally opposed to those of
Messrs. Askinas and Perluss.
Instead of "bad courses," I found
an impressive array of new courses
taught superbly by such people as
M. Borius, M. Girod, and Mme.
Perdoux. Instead of finding
change "impossible," I saw a great
improvement in the relaxation of
rules governing student conduct.
Instead of "poor relations"
between Tours and Stanford
administrators, I found the
French directors devoted to Mr.

Walker, depressed at the notion
that he might not continue.
(Incidentally, that administrative
team of Mile. Bordenave, Mme.
Durand, and M. LeMoal is the
most distinguished I have ever
seen running an educational
institution.)
I have no illusions that the
overseas campuses are perfect, or
almost perfect, any more than I
think that Stanford in California
approaches perfection. Nor do I
believe that Mr. Walker, or any of
the rest of us, is indispensable.
But it seems to me grotesquely
unfair to deny that the overseas
campuses are constantly changing,
and changing for the better.
