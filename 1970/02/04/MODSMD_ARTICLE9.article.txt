## Problems--And One Solution 
### Stanford's Black Community 
It is not often that the white student body of
Stanford University can look back at being
addressed by the Black Community at Stanford in
any friendly terms. We have been at odds and total
harmony between us and the many factions on this
campus is a long way off. But, there comes a time
when campus issues become very worthless, petty
and most unimportant. The real issues of this world
are talked about on campus, but their application
can only be found in real settings.
Stanford is not a real setting. It is very easy for
the young and learning to embrace good theories,
eloquent rhetoric, and grand ideals, but in many
cases there is not substance to these. This is why the
Black Community here at Stanford has placed this
article in this newspaper.
There is an issue—a real issue—that students must
be made aware of. There exists a problem that
makes it necessary for us to set aside a lot of the
educational fantasy; set aside your other activities
and tend to some very important business.
We are all probably aware that Nixon has vetoed
a bill that would aid poor people because,
supposedly, it would upset our economic stability.
People very close to this campus (less than three
miles away) are on, and have always been on the
short end of decisions such as these. Nairobi (East
Palo Alto) is in danger of losing it's Information
Center because of government cutbacks. In fact, the
E.O.C. commission in this area has lost $86,000 in
budget funds. The Information Center (commonly
known as the Info Center) in East Palo Alto is a
very important agency within the community. It is
the only agency that reaches the mass of people.
Yes, the great majority of these people are Black,
and the Info Center strives to meet many of their
needs.
Info Center Explained
To get a good idea of what this agency really is,
one should know that:
—It is a community based and operated agency
that serves to meet a wide spectrum of needs in
Nairobi. The Info Center is a multipurpose agency
which helps residents of a low income.
—The Info Center is the only full-time organizing
agency in East Palo Alto. East Palo Alto is in the
forefront of innovation with Nairobi Day School,
High School, and Nairobi College. These schools are
making Third World Education a reality, but the
task of organizing homeowners, welfare recipients,
the aged, and other community residents belongs to
the Info Center.
—The Info Center has many contacts with local
business and industries. It provides a job referral
service for those seeking full or part time
employment.
—The Info Center provides services by personal
involvement and understanding with each person's
situation. The Info Centers staff finds the resources
that are available and makes sure that the person or
persons are taken care of. It is one of a very few
agencies in the community that projects a human
feeling in dealing with people.

-Besides providing general information and
advice, the Info Center helps low income people as
they strive to make ends meet. Payment of rent,
utilities, and food bills is a service rendered by the
Info Center to the community.
—The Information Center in East Palo Alto is
fighting for the people (without any preference)
who find themselves caught up in white America's
pursuit of happiness.
—The people who come to the Info Center for
help know very little about the laws of America or
of their legal rights. All they know is that everyday
presents a new struggle for survival, a new problem
that has to be resolved. Take away the Info Center
and there is no place for the residents of the
community to go for information, services, advice
or anything.
Do you Care?
The Black Community in Nairobi and here at
Stanford are asking you to set aside your university
activities for a moment—just long enough to care. A
people who you've overlooked and stepped over are
very much in need of something that really belongs
to them; a fair shake, a chance to make it. Just
because a family is on welfare doesn't mean that
their children should not be properly educated or
fed. Are we so cool, hip, and politically aware that
we overlook such situations. Without the Info
Center a large segment of an entire community will
remain unaware of issues and situations that can
only cause more problems.
The Info Center's problem is this; six thousand
dollars are needed to keep the present staff
employed. A staff dedicated to the residents of the
community and who are working to make the
community East of Bayshore excellent in every
way. The Info Center is already understaffed and
many Black students from Stanford are volunteering
many hours a week to help.
Not Enough
It takes a very yielding and sensitive nature to
place other's needs before oneself. We who attend
this University, regardless of race, creed, or color,
need to become more than intellectually involved.
We need to understand the needs of people who
have no alternatives for inflation. The people of
East Palo Alto cannot alter the fact that they are
people trying to survive in a world that is not aimed
to help. It's not their fault; and to make other
people suffer because you are educated and
successful means that you cannot be really serious
about any of the demonstrations of love and
humanitarism.
The Black Community at Stanford has
committed itself to seeing that the Info Center
continues to operate effectively. We are starting a
massive fund raising drive to make sure that the Info
Center stays open and continues to provide services.
We feel that this fund raising drive is very important
because it is centered around an issue which involves
people other than ourselves.
The question is often posed, "But what can I do
to help?" Now is your chance. It's the Info Centers
and the Community's last chance. Will you help?
