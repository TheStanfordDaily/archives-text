Today
Sen. Huey Long outlined his "Share the Wealth" program
to the Senate 37 years ago today.
Needless to say, his program was never accepted.
And a mere twelve years later, the Yalta Conference
began with FDR, Churchill and Stalin trying to thrash out
all of the world's problems between then}.
Nothing was accomplished there, either. If at first you
don V succeed. . .
