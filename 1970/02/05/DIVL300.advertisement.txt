We dorit think stand-by passengers
should spend more time waiting
than flying.
Four pizzaburgers, two malts, and three candy bars later, you're still sitting
in the terminal.
Flying as a stand-by passenger gives you a chance to save some money.
But on most airlines, it's also a chance to wait and wait and wait.
We can help. Since we fly more jets to more cities, more times a day
than anyone, chances are pretty good you won't have to camp at the
terminal waiting for a seat. If your trip takes you to a city we don't
serve (and we serve over 116 of them), your 12-21 Club Card will
be accepted for reduced fare by 18 other major airlines.
Get a United 12-21 Club Card. Your United Air Lines
campus rep can accept your three dollar membership fee
and issue your card right away. Then with our 12-21 Card, G ftVjl
you'll be able to get 40% off regular Coach fare. ttlC
