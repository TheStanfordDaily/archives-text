## Black Perspective 
### FRED MANN (Second in a three-part series) 
(Editor's note: The series of articles on lilach
Studies at Stanford was originally written for a
national publication in December, and has since
been revised.
(Objections to the first article in this series were
raised by concerned black students. Consultation
concerning the remainder of the series caused
delay in the printing of this article. In accordance
with DAILY policy, the articles were discussed,
but not subject to approval by the group.)
The Black Studies Program at Stanford is
substantially different from those at other schools.
Here, it is not the sole center of black activity.
According to program chairman St. Clair Drake, it
is part of a tripartite structure of black
participation. The Black* House on campus and a
highly active student participation center in East
Palo Alto, run by the Black Students Union, make
up the other parts of the black experience at
Stanford. Later articles in the Daily will explore
these centers in depth.
"The African and Afro-American Studies
Program is not an action program," said Drake,
"but it does not exist in isolation from such
programs."
This year, more classes in the Afro-American
segment of the program are being given a "black
studies focus." Black studies are "studies from the
black perspective," said Drake, and he called them
"a component part of the whole program." A new
"Workshop in Community Development" will be
added next quarter to the black studies offering
under the leadership of the program's
administrative assistant Gerald Casimere.
Students have made suggestions for the
formation of new classes in some areas, while
black instructors in the Afro-American program
have also been active in structuring new classes.
Drake noted that although many classes deal
with the traditional approaches to black-white
relations, the center or core of the program is
based on black studies as it is known at most
schoolsâ€”"Courses that view the world from the
black perspective."
White students make up the majority of the
program's enrollment, but in the black studies
"core" classes, there is a predominance of black
students. In "Racism and Prejudice," seminar
sections include Blacks, Whites, Chicanos,
Orientals, and Indians, but the black studies
component of the course is made up of four
all-black sections.
Educators, national columnists, and critics of
the idea of a "black studies program" have
expressed the fear of separatism between blacks
and whites being increased by the hundreds of
programs set up on campuses across the country.
Casimere feels the non-controversial nature of

most ol the courses in the program at staniora
allows both blacks and whites to study together
without stirring emotions and tensions which
might hinder the learning process. He added that
the wide range of classes available to the
undergraduate at Stanford helps to further
alleviate the critics' fears.
"At all major schools, the majority of classes a
student takes are in subjects not related to black
studies," he said. "There are just too many
required classes that have to be completed.
"Under this circumstances, racial separatism can
not be fathered by the educational institution.
There is no racial emphasis. Separatism will only
come from nationalism within the black
community itself."
Drake differed in his evaluation of the so-called
"fear of separatism." He believes the black studies
program has in fact drawn like peoples together.
"That began last year with the separate black
sections for 'Racism and Prejudice," he said.
"Black students wanted them. Nobody was injured
by it. It simply reflects the 'separatism' all blacks
have to live with all the time in the off-campus
world, a 'separatism' they didn't choose but that
racist American society imposed.
"Why shouldn't the university prepare them for
a real world in which they live partly separate and
partly 'integrated' instead of the fantasy of an
integrated world that isn't there or 'in the cards'
for the future."
The Afro-American studies portion of the
program has offered classes aside from the black
studies core courses through many different
departments.
Fall quarter, the program offered "Black
Community and Leadership from 1739 to 1881,"
as well as "African Civilizations" through the
History Department. Other courses included: "The
Portrayal of the Negro in American Literature"
(English), "Contemporary African Politics"
(Political Science), and "Ideology and Thought in
the Twentieth Century Black Community"
(Sociology).
Associate provost Robert M. Rosenzweig noted,
"You can not fully understand the problems of
the Blacks in America without knowing their
problems and backgrounds in Africa and elsewhere
in the New World."'
Student reaction to the Afro-American program
seems to be on the whole complimentary. A small
sampling of students, both black and white,
expressed satisfaction with the courses, but all
hoped the range of courses would continue to be
widened. Some complaints cited an African
teaching assistant for sticking too closely to the
textbook and failing to inject his own viewpoints
into the discussion in a class last spring. Overall
however, students found course content
interesting and instructors informative.
