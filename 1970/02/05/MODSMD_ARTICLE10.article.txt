# New Role for Science?
## Idealism Constrictive? 
### Joshua Lederberg 
Each deadline poses a new
opportunity and a new challenge.
I scan over my recent
productions, only to see a string
of lamentations. I hope to offer
some novelty of scientific fact or
critical point of view; some I
know may be mainly bad temper
masquerading as righteous
indignation.
Could one not expose some
more positive program to build,
some new vision of human
achievement illuminated by
science? Or if not, some cheery
amusements? But even such a
titillation as the new chemical
aphrodisiacs, when one things
again, will turn into another of
the ironic self-deceptions that
foolish mortals are prone to play.
Good news is just hard to find,
and then we must be wary of it.
This is the age when sweet is
bitter, when even the blessings of
new births are ambiguous (viewed
as statistics). Among younger
people the frustrations of
potential nuclear war, population
unlimited, and pollution
everywhere are especially
poignant, and are sometimes
internalized into self-hatred and
alientation. How hard to extol the
dignity of man, when there are so
many of us!
Positive Side
Perhaps then there is a positive
side to concerted criticism, that to
react to obvious wrongs is to help
build the only kind of community
that can enlist our energies and
dissipate our loneliness.
Karl Popper's book "The Open
Society and its Enemies" is the
manifesto for piecemeal social
engineering, which he opposed to
the ideals of Utopian planning ol
the pre-Stalinist era. He wrote 30
years ago that "a systematic fight
against suffering and injustice and
war is more likely to be supported
by the agreement and approval of
a great number of people than the
fight for the establishment of
some ideal. The existence of social
evils can be comparatively well
established. Those who suffer can
judge for themselves, and the
others can hardly deny that they
would not like to change places. It
is infinitely more complicated to
reason about an ideal society.
Social life is so complicated that
few men, or none at all could
judge a blueprint for social
engineering on the grand
scale . . . accordingly, adopt the
method of searching for, and
fighting against, the greatest and
most urgent evils of society,
rather than searching for, and
fighting for, its greatest ultimate
good."
Life On Earth An Ideai
As the better way to unify a
liberal society, Popper's argument
is faultless. Today we have just
one reason to voice an exception:
the survival of the human
community on earth may already
be a Utopian ideal. For its

realization we have little
experience, tools, training, or
organization. We lack even the
will to proceed with the
long-range global planning needed
to meet the realities of today's
poverty and tomorrow's
revolutions of hunger and
unfulfilled epectations.
In the face of the Pearson
Commission's reasoned analysis of
world development needs, the
Congress last year slashed foreign
aid appropriations to the lowest
levels in recent years. This was
harsh and ungenerous, but was it
totally irrational? For we are too
divided against ourselves to think
out the plans to reveal how a
billion dollars more or less would
matter for the long run odds of a
viable world. Back to piecemeal
planning, until we can rebuild our
institutions to where they can
take on such tasks.
Allocation of Priorities
The same overview may help
short-circuit a lot of argument
about technological assessment,
how to allocate priorities for one
kind of science compared to
another, and so on. The fact is, no
one is wise enough for such
judgements on a grand scale. Who

would have known enough to
fund Gutenberg? And who knows
enough now to say whether the
Manhattan project will have led to
the end, or to a new beginning, of
world history? Just what scientific
knowledge already in hand would
be better unknown, and if so how
would we keep it so? Do we
imagine overpowering nature to
annihilate a fact?
More important than particular
scientific products are the
institutions which are built as the
all-important side-effects of the
technological budget and which
can generate the balance we need.
Large defense contracts help build
missile systems, and also a
military-industrial complex.
Supporting "big science" assures a
ready reserve of physicists and
engineers; "little science" and the
humanities at the universities will
promote skeptical teachers and
critics. If we replace the
universities with vocational
schools, we can also bolster the
status quo, but at the expense of
our adaptability to change and the
chance of ever taking on the big
jobs ahead.

one is wise enough for such
judgements on a grand scale. Who

would have known enough to
fund Gutenberg? And who knows
enough now to say whether the
Manhattan project will have led to
the end, or to a new beginning, of
world history? Just what scientific
knowledge already in hand would
be better unknown, and if so how
would we keep it so? Do we
imagine overpowering nature to
annihilate a fact?
More important than particular
scientific products are the
institutions which are built as the
all-important side-effects of the
technological budget and which
can generate the balance we need.
Large defense contracts help build
missile systems, and also a
military-industrial complex.
Supporting "big science" assures a
ready reserve of physicists and
engineers; "little science" and the
humanities at the universities will
promote skeptical teachers and
critics. If we replace the
universities with vocational
schools, we can also bolster the
status quo, but at the expense of
our adaptability to change and the
chance of ever taking on the big
jobs ahead.

Each deadline poses a new
opportunity and a new challenge.
I scan over my recent
productions, only to see a string
of lamentations. I hope to offer
some novelty of scientific fact or
critical point of view; some I
know may be mainly bad temper
masquerading as righteous
indignation.
Could one not expose some
more positive program to build,
some new vision of human
achievement illuminated by
science? Or if not, some cheery
amusements? But even such a
titillation as the new chemical
aphrodisiacs, when one things
again, will turn into another of
the ironic self-deceptions that
foolish mortals are prone to play.
Good news is just hard to find,
and then we must be wary of it.
This is the age when sweet is
bitter, when even the blessings of
new births are ambiguous (viewed
as statistics). Among younger
people the frustrations of
potential nuclear war, population
unlimited, and pollution
everywhere are especially
poignant, and are sometimes
internalized into self-hatred and
alientation. How hard to extol the
dignity of man, when there are so
many of us!
Positive Side
Perhaps then there is a positive
side to concerted criticism, that to
react to obvious wrongs is to help
build the only kind of community
that can enlist our energies and
dissipate our loneliness.
Karl Popper's book "The Open
Society and its Enemies" is the
manifesto for piecemeal social
engineering, which he opposed to
the ideals of Utopian planning ol
the pre-Stalinist era. He wrote 30
years ago that "a systematic fight
against suffering and injustice and
war is more likely to be supported
by the agreement and approval of
a great number of people than the
fight for the establishment of
some ideal. The existence of social
evils can be comparatively well
established. Those who suffer can
judge for themselves, and the
others can hardly deny that they
would not like to change places. It
is infinitely more complicated to
reason about an ideal society.
Social life is so complicated that
few men, or none at all could
judge a blueprint for social
engineering on the grand
scale . . . accordingly, adopt the
method of searching for, and
fighting against, the greatest and
most urgent evils of society,
rather than searching for, and
fighting for, its greatest ultimate
good."
Life On Earth An Ideai
As the better way to unify a
liberal society, Popper's argument
is faultless. Today we have just
one reason to voice an exception:
the survival of the human
community on earth may already
be a Utopian ideal. For its

realization we have little
experience, tools, training, or
organization. We lack even the
will to proceed with the
long-range global planning needed
to meet the realities of today's
poverty and tomorrow's
revolutions of hunger and
unfulfilled epectations.
In the face of the Pearson
Commission's reasoned analysis of
world development needs, the
Congress last year slashed foreign
aid appropriations to the lowest
levels in recent years. This was
harsh and ungenerous, but was it
totally irrational? For we are too
divided against ourselves to think
out the plans to reveal how a
billion dollars more or less would
matter for the long run odds of a
viable world. Back to piecemeal
planning, until we can rebuild our
institutions to where they can
take on such tasks.
Allocation of Priorities
The same overview may help
short-circuit a lot of argument
about technological assessment,
how to allocate priorities for one
kind of science compared to
another, and so on. The fact is, no
one is wise enough for such
judgements on a grand scale. Who

would have known enough to
fund Gutenberg? And who knows
enough now to say whether the

community on earth may already
be a Utopian ideal. For its

realization we have little
experience, tools, training, or
organization. We lack even the
will to proceed with the
long-range global planning needed
to meet the realities of today's
poverty and tomorrow's
revolutions of hunger and
unfulfilled epectations.
In the face of the Pearson
Commission's reasoned analysis of
world development needs, the
Congress last year slashed foreign
aid appropriations to the lowest
levels in recent years. This was
harsh and ungenerous, but was it
totally irrational? For we are too
divided against ourselves to think
out the plans to reveal how a
billion dollars more or less would
matter for the long run odds of a
viable world. Back to piecemeal
planning, until we can rebuild our
institutions to where they can
take on such tasks.
Allocation of Priorities
The same overview may help
short-circuit a lot of argument
about technological assessment,
how to allocate priorities for one
kind of science compared to
another, and so on. The fact is, no
one is wise enough for such
judgements on a grand scale. Who

would have known enough to
fund Gutenberg? And who knows
enough now to say whether the
Manhattan project will have led to
the end, or to a new beginning, of
world history? Just what scientific
knowledge already in hand would
be better unknown, and if so how
would we keep it so? Do we
imagine overpowering nature to
annihilate a fact?
More important than particular
scientific products are the
institutions which are built as the
all-important side-effects of the
technological budget and which
can generate the balance we need.
Large defense contracts help build
missile systems, and also a
military-industrial complex.
Supporting "big science" assures a
ready reserve of physicists and
engineers; "little science" and the
humanities at the universities will
promote skeptical teachers and
critics. If we replace the
universities with vocational
schools, we can also bolster the
status quo, but at the expense of
our adaptability to change and the
chance of ever taking on the big
jobs ahead.
