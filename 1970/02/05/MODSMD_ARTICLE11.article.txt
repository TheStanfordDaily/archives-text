## Grappling with Garbage 
### Doug Graham 
Behold, citizens, the era of
garbage is upon us. Garbage is
finally coming into its own as an
economic commodity. It used to
be, a few years back, that we just
dumped garbage in a city dump
and let the rats take care of it.
Occasionally, small boys would
set it alight to the general
amusement of all except those
who lived downwind. That
phenomenon, friends, is now a
thing of the past for a significant
proportion of our cities.
About two decades ago,
America began experiencing a
minor technological revolution
that was little noticed at the time.
The packaging revolution. Meats
used to come unwrapped; now
they are enclosed in paper and
plastic. Vegetables and fruits were
offered for sale in their natural
state; new they often come in
plastic. Most other groceries were
purchased in relatively large
amounts with low
package-to-net-weight ratios. Now
they are marketed in sophisticated
and bulky packages that often
approach equality in weight with
the food contained. The same
thing in general has happened to
manufactured products. The
growing size of national markets,
demand for increased quality in
all consumer products, increased
complexity of the collection,
concentration, distribution and
delivery systems for all manners
of goods has led to a greater need
for longer shelf lives, improved
"transportability" and protection
from deterioration. The result?
The packaging revolution.
Packaging Problem
Now comes the crucial
question. What does one do with
the package when one is done
with the product? For twenty
years of unequalled prosperity our
answer has been throw it away.
The national anti-litterbug
campaign of the Fifties and early
Sixties has resulted in the average
American being a little more
selective in where he throws it
away, but the central fact remains
that he still has to throw it away
somewhere.
That somewhere is filling up
fast and some cities are up against
the wall. Like San Francisco, for
example. A number of years ago,
the Bay City persuaded the town
of Brisbane to accept its refuse for
land fill at Sierra Point. Now the
problem has returned, as the
Sierra Point site will be chuck-full
before the end of 1970. Last year,
the Board of Supervisors spent
months haggling with Lassen
County over a plan to dump the
garbage out there in the desert
near the Nevada State Line. The
Lassen plan fell through becuase
of high railroad transportation
costs and San Francisco is still
seeking a "permanent" solution to
the problem. Meanwhile, the
garbage will go to Mountain View.
Mountain View View
Yes, pollution fans, your
friendly metropolis of the South
Bayshore, Mountain View, has
come to the rescue. Mountain
View needs a regional park, to be
developed on the mud flats by the
bay. It needs cheap fill. San
Francisco has the garbage. Voila!
A solution? Yes, but only
temporarily. Estimates are that it

will only take a couple of years to
fill the Mountain View Site.
Lest you think this is solely a
local problem, consider
Washington, D.C. Our Nation's
Capitol last week was negotiating
with the Southern Railway to
haul our Nation's Capitol's Trash
to a remote (and unnamed) site
100 miles away in Virginia. The
railway was to build a plant in
Washington to shred and compact
dry refuse into four-foot,
800-pound cubes. This plan was
preferred to an alternative
proposal for an incinerator. Not
only would the incinerator be
costly, but it would contribute to
air pollution and still leave the
problem of residue (ash) removal.
Short-Sigh tcdn ess
It seems to us that both of
these plans are extremely
short-sighted. We laud the
politicians involved for their
earnest labors in attempting to
find solutions to the problem
before the good citizens are knee
deep in rubbish; but really they
are, to an extent, merely
transferring the problem
geographically. (How do you like
the idea, Bayshore Freeway fans,
of following one of San
Francisco's 'scavenger" trucks
down 32 miles of freeway to the
dump site? Does 1500 tons per
day sound like it might generate a
lot of slow-moving traffic?).
The basic problem here is a
result of the packaging revolution.
Some of the extra material that
goes into packaging today is
necessary. A lot of it isn't; it is
strictly a convenience to the
customer or is related solely to
advertising or promotion
campaigns. We suggest that it is
time to reverse the trend of this
century and begin to return to

simpler packaging while we can
still see over the garbage piles. We
are not advocating an immediate
return to the grocery store cracker
barrel; but something needs to be
done.
Bio-Degradables
The recent trend in industry
toward research into various
bio-degradable container materials
is promising, albeit long overdue.
A bio-degradable container is one
that is vulnerable to attack by
micro-organisms and subsequent
degradation into its basic chemical
components, which would serve
the function of returning this
much-needed material to the soil.
The ultimate in this sort of thing
might be an enzymic garbage pail
in which you stuff the beer
"cans" for a few hours before
pouring the resultant solution
down the toilet (or on the
garden?)
Meanwhile, our kitchen
middens keep growing.
Archaelogically speaking, our
civilization may well be
remembered as the "Great Refuse
Age". That is one long-range value
of our city dumps — they are
priceless repositories for the
archaelogists of the future. All
that stuff ought to last a long time
in the dry climate of Lassen
County.
Installment Credit
The whole thing reminds us of
another aspect of our age;
installment credit. This is what
we've been doing to the
environment; exercising our credit
and piling up ecological debts that
our children and grand-children
will have to pay. "Buy Now—Pay
Later." That's us all right. When
will we ever learn?

complexity of the collection,
concentration, distribution and
delivery systems for all manners
of goods has led to a greater need
for longer shelf lives, improved
"transportability" and protection
from deterioration. The result?
The packaging revolution.
Packaging Problem
Now comes the crucial
question. What does one do with
the package when one is done
with the product? For twenty
years of unequalled prosperity our
answer has been throw it away.
The national anti-litterbug
campaign of the Fifties and early
Sixties has resulted in the average
American being a little more
selective in where he throws it
away, but the central fact remains
that he still has to throw it away
somewhere.
That somewhere is filling up
fast and some cities are up against
the wall. Like San Francisco, for
example. A number of years ago,
the Bay City persuaded the town
of Brisbane to accept its refuse for
land fill at Sierra Point. Now the
problem has returned, as the
Sierra Point site will be chuck-full
before the end of 1970. Last year,
the Board of Supervisors spent
months haggling with Lassen
County over a plan to dump the
garbage out there in the desert
near the Nevada State Line. The
Lassen plan fell through becuase
of high railroad transportation
costs and San Francisco is still
seeking a "permanent" solution to
the problem. Meanwhile, the
garbage will go to Mountain View.
Mountain View View
Yes, pollution fans, your
friendly metropolis of the South
Bayshore, Mountain View, has
come to the rescue. Mountain
View needs a regional park, to be
developed on the mud flats by the
bay. It needs cheap fill. San
Francisco has the garbage. Voila!
A solution? Yes, but only
temporarily. Estimates are that it

will only take a couple of years to
fill the Mountain View Site.
Lest you think this is solely a
local problem, consider
Washington, D.C. Our Nation's
Capitol last week was negotiating
with the Southern Railway to
haul our Nation's Capitol's Trash
to a remote (and unnamed) site
100 miles away in Virginia. The
railway was to build a plant in
Washington to shred and compact
dry refuse into four-foot,
800-pound cubes. This plan was
preferred to an alternative
proposal for an incinerator. Not
only would the incinerator be
costly, but it would contribute to
air pollution and still leave the
problem of residue (ash) removal.
Short-Sigh tcdn ess
It seems to us that both of
these plans are extremely
short-sighted. We laud the
politicians involved for their
earnest labors in attempting to
find solutions to the problem
before the good citizens are knee
deep in rubbish; but really they
are, to an extent, merely
transferring the problem
geographically. (How do you like
the idea, Bayshore Freeway fans,
of following one of San
Francisco's 'scavenger" trucks
down 32 miles of freeway to the
dump site? Does 1500 tons per
day sound like it might generate a
lot of slow-moving traffic?).
The basic problem here is a
result of the packaging revolution.
Some of the extra material that
goes into packaging today is
necessary. A lot of it isn't; it is
strictly a convenience to the
customer or is related solely to
advertising or promotion
campaigns. We suggest that it is
time to reverse the trend of this
century and begin to return to

simpler packaging while we can
still see over the garbage piles. We
are not advocating an immediate
return to the grocery store cracker
barrel; but something needs to be
done.
Bio-Degradables
The recent trend in industry
toward research into various
bio-degradable container materials
is promising, albeit long overdue.
A bio-degradable container is one
that is vulnerable to attack by
micro-organisms and subsequent
degradation into its basic chemical
components, which would serve
the function of returning this
much-needed material to the soil.
The ultimate in this sort of thing
might be an enzymic garbage pail
in which you stuff the beer
"cans" for a few hours before
pouring the resultant solution
down the toilet (or on the
garden?)
Meanwhile, our kitchen
middens keep growing.
Archaelogically speaking, our
civilization may well be
remembered as the "Great Refuse
Age". That is one long-range value
of our city dumps — they are
priceless repositories for the
archaelogists of the future. All
that stuff ought to last a long time
in the dry climate of Lassen
County.
Installment Credit
The whole thing reminds us of
another aspect of our age;
installment credit. This is what
we've been doing to the
environment; exercising our credit
and piling up ecological debts that
our children and grand-children
will have to pay. "Buy Now—Pay
Later." That's us all right. When
will we ever learn?
(Doug Graham is a weekly
Columnist for the Daily).
Behold, citizens, the era of
garbage is upon us. Garbage is
finally coming into its own as an
economic commodity. It used to
be, a few years back, that we just
dumped garbage in a city dump
and let the rats take care of it.
Occasionally, small boys would
set it alight to the general
amusement of all except those
who lived downwind. That
phenomenon, friends, is now a
thing of the past for a significant
proportion of our cities.
About two decades ago,
America began experiencing a
minor technological revolution
that was little noticed at the time.
The packaging revolution. Meats
used to come unwrapped; now
they are enclosed in paper and
plastic. Vegetables and fruits were
offered for sale in their natural
state; new they often come in
plastic. Most other groceries were
purchased in relatively large
amounts with low
package-to-net-weight ratios. Now
they are marketed in sophisticated
and bulky packages that often
approach equality in weight with
the food contained. The same
thing in general has happened to
manufactured products. The
growing size of national markets,
demand for increased quality in
all consumer products, increased
complexity of the collection,
concentration, distribution and
delivery systems for all manners
of goods has led to a greater need
for longer shelf lives, improved

near the Nevada State Line. The
Lassen plan fell through becuase
of high railroad transportation
costs and San Francisco is still
seeking a "permanent" solution to
the problem. Meanwhile, the
garbage will go to Mountain View.
Mountain View View
Yes, pollution fans, your
friendly metropolis of the South
Bayshore, Mountain View, has
come to the rescue. Mountain
View needs a regional park, to be
developed on the mud flats by the
bay. It needs cheap fill. San
Francisco has the garbage. Voila!
A solution? Yes, but only
temporarily. Estimates are that it

will only take a couple of years to
fill the Mountain View Site.
Lest you think this is solely a
local problem, consider
Washington, D.C. Our Nation's
Capitol last week was negotiating
with the Southern Railway to
haul our Nation's Capitol's Trash
to a remote (and unnamed) site
100 miles away in Virginia. The
railway was to build a plant in
Washington to shred and compact
dry refuse into four-foot,
800-pound cubes. This plan was
preferred to an alternative
proposal for an incinerator. Not
only would the incinerator be
costly, but it would contribute to
air pollution and still leave the
problem of residue (ash) removal.
Short-Sigh tcdn ess
It seems to us that both of
these plans are extremely
short-sighted. We laud the
politicians involved for their
earnest labors in attempting to
find solutions to the problem
before the good citizens are knee
deep in rubbish; but really they
are, to an extent, merely
transferring the problem
geographically. (How do you like
the idea, Bayshore Freeway fans,
of following one of San
Francisco's 'scavenger" trucks
down 32 miles of freeway to the
dump site? Does 1500 tons per
day sound like it might generate a
lot of slow-moving traffic?).
The basic problem here is a
result of the packaging revolution.
Some of the extra material that
goes into packaging today is
necessary. A lot of it isn't; it is
strictly a convenience to the
customer or is related solely to
advertising or promotion
campaigns. We suggest that it is
time to reverse the trend of this
century and begin to return to

simpler packaging while we can
still see over the garbage piles. We
are not advocating an immediate
return to the grocery store cracker
barrel; but something needs to be
done.
Bio-Degradables
The recent trend in industry
toward research into various
bio-degradable container materials
is promising, albeit long overdue.
A bio-degradable container is one
that is vulnerable to attack by
micro-organisms and subsequent
degradation into its basic chemical
components, which would serve
the function of returning this
much-needed material to the soil.
The ultimate in this sort of thing
might be an enzymic garbage pail
in which you stuff the beer
"cans" for a few hours before
pouring the resultant solution
down the toilet (or on the
garden?)
Meanwhile, our kitchen
middens keep growing.
Archaelogically speaking, our
civilization may well be
remembered as the "Great Refuse
Age". That is one long-range value
of our city dumps — they are
priceless repositories for the
archaelogists of the future. All
that stuff ought to last a long time
in the dry climate of Lassen
County.
Installment Credit
The whole thing reminds us of
another aspect of our age;
installment credit. This is what
we've been doing to the
environment; exercising our credit
and piling up ecological debts that
our children and grand-children
will have to pay. "Buy Now—Pay
Later." That's us all right. When
will we ever learn?
(Doug Graham is a weekly
Columnist for the Daily).
Behold, citizens, the era of
garbage is upon us. Garbage is
finally coming into its own as an
economic commodity. It used to
be, a few years back, that we just
dumped garbage in a city dump
and let the rats take care of it.
Occasionally, small boys would
set it alight to the general
amusement of all except those
who lived downwind. That
phenomenon, friends, is now a
thing of the past for a significant
proportion of our cities.
About two decades ago,
America began experiencing a
minor technological revolution
that was little noticed at the time.
The packaging revolution. Meats
used to come unwrapped; now
they are enclosed in paper and
plastic. Vegetables and fruits were
offered for sale in their natural
state; new they often come in
plastic. Most other groceries were
purchased in relatively large
amounts with low
package-to-net-weight ratios. Now
they are marketed in sophisticated
and bulky packages that often
approach equality in weight with
the food contained. The same
thing in general has happened to
manufactured products. The
growing size of national markets,
demand for increased quality in
all consumer products, increased
complexity of the collection,
concentration, distribution and
delivery systems for all manners
of goods has led to a greater need
for longer shelf lives, improved
"transportability" and protection
from deterioration. The result?
The packaging revolution.
Packaging Problem
Now comes the crucial
question. What does one do with
the package when one is done
with the product? For twenty
years of unequalled prosperity our
answer has been throw it away.
The national anti-litterbug
campaign of the Fifties and early
Sixties has resulted in the average
American being a little more
selective in where he throws it
away, but the central fact remains
that he still has to throw it away
somewhere.
That somewhere is filling up
fast and some cities are up against
the wall. Like San Francisco, for
example. A number of years ago,
the Bay City persuaded the town
of Brisbane to accept its refuse for
land fill at Sierra Point. Now the
problem has returned, as the
Sierra Point site will be chuck-full
before the end of 1970. Last year,
the Board of Supervisors spent
months haggling with Lassen
County over a plan to dump the
garbage out there in the desert
near the Nevada State Line. The
Lassen plan fell through becuase
of high railroad transportation
costs and San Francisco is still
seeking a "permanent" solution to
