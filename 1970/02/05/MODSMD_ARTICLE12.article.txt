# Orientation Program
## Overseas Proposal 
### Jim Scheimer 
In an effort to provide students
going overseas with some
background and orientation, the
overseas campus office has
instituted a new program. Before
anyone can hope to attend one of
Stanford's five overseas campuses,
they must now fulfill one of three
requirements: 1) completion of
one course from an approved list,
2) completion of a required
reading list and a satisfactory
grade on a test on these readings,
or 3) undertaking an independent
reading of study program
Under the auspices of a
member of the faculty the
overseas campus office prefers
that students use the first of these
alternatives to fulfill the
requirement. The approved
courses include such courses as
Econ. 1, Music 1, and Artl; the
remaining courses are even more
specialized.
Unfortunately for those
students who undertake this
alternative the courses available
do not meet the administrative
requirement of, "familiariazation
with the culture to which you will
be exposed."

This results in the somewhat
strange situation of a science
major taking a high numbered art
course, not because he is
interested in it, but merely
because it will fulfill his
requirement and he doesn't have
the extra time to spend on reading
the BOOKS required for the
second alternative.
Opinions vary among students
as to the usefulness of these
courses.
For most students who have
not yet gone overseas, they seem
to be a nuisance of no great
tangible value. For those who
have already gone overseas, the
courses appear to be useful and
enjoyable to most but too specific
in scope.
The situation for those who
elect to undertake the second
alternative can be even more
frustrating. The required reading
list runs to 6 or 8 books
depending on the campus. These
tomes range from government fact
books put out by the local
equivalent of the chamber of
commerce to heavy economic
texts to travel books. The average
student finds the economics
books fairly poor after he has
determined the unit of currency
for the particular country to
which he is going. The travel
books are generally somewhat
more interesting but are of little
value unless you take them with
you as guide books. The only
books which seem to answer the
questions on the test are the fact
books printed by the various
governments.
The really frustrating part ot
this is that the student finds he
has waded through hundreds of
pages of information; having been
given no idea what it is he is
expected to know, only to find
that the book that told him the
most and answered most of the
questions was that little
paperback pamphlet he read first
because it was the shortest. So we
are left only with the third
alternative, which has possibly the
most potential, unfortunately it is
difficult to rate the actual
effectiveness of this since no one
as yet seems to have been inclined
to undertake it.
The need for an orientation
program has been apparent for
some time. Most students who
have gone overseas have come
back with the same story, they
were insufficiently prepared for
their campus unless they had
already been to Europe. It appears
that the overseas campus office
has finally become cognizant of
this. However, few students find
the new orientation requirements
have fullfilled their own desires or
the goals set forth by the overseas
campus director.
