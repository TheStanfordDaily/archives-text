ROTC Courses
Editor, THE DAILY:
President Pitzer's proposal
permit limited academic credit for
ROTC courses seems to have
revived the old controversy over
the meaning of the ROTC
resolution approved in a student
referendum last Spring. The
resolution stated that ROTC "has
a legitimate place on campus" and
favored academic credit for ROTC
programs "of genuine academic
interest."
In what the Daily describes as
"an angry student reaction" John
Shoch of the ASSU Senate
declared that the passage of this
resolution by over 60% of the
3300 students voting (more than
voted for this year's student
Senate) was "meaningless." As the
author and a sponsor of the
original resolution I am biased,
but I wish to reply.
The intention of the resolution
was not to endorse unlimited
ROTC credit. Obviously,
marching drill is no more an
academic subject than
introductory tennis and neither
deserves academic credit. On the
other hand American Military
History is a course of potential

academic interest. If such a course
meets University standards a
student taking it should not be
denied credit.
I do not believe that any
Stanford student who voted for
the resolution could possibly have
interpreted it as oppossing credit
lor a course of academic merit in
the ROTC department. I would
indeed be interested to hear from
anyone who did.
I believe that President Pitzer's
proposals will provide a legitimate
means of judging ROTC courses
academic merit and are in the
spirit of last Spring's resolution. I
hope that the faculty will see fit
to adopt them.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I cannot claim originality for
the letter that appeared in the
January 27 issue of the Stanford
Daily. The article, in the form of a
UPI press release, first appeared
on the walls of Junipero, a Wilbur
house. Acquiring a copy, I posted
it on my door. The subsequent
appearance of the letter in the
Daily was intended as no more
than a joke.

I deeply regret any
embarrassment or indignation that
was wrought upon members of
the Stanford community. I realize
now that the letter had no place
in a widely circulated student
publication.
That, however, is not now my
primary concern. The response to
the letter is the issue.
My parents, active alumni of
Stanford, have received numerous
letters, clippings and telephone
calls from "concerned friends."
One such note read:
"We at Stanford are certain
that parents are vitally interested
in the manner in which their
children are performing at the
University.
"Therefore, you undoubtedly
will be pleased to learn of new
honors accorded your sonâ€”honors
that will reflect on members of
the Boothe family which
throughout the years has
exhibited unashamed pride in the
Boothe name and alumni
position."
While I respect this individual's
indignation at my letter, I cannot
understand his bitter, vindictive
attack upon my family.
From adults who decry student
radicalism, senseless destruction

and character attacks came cries
of outrage and indignation. Cries
that became manifest in slander of
my parents and myself. Alumni
mistily remember Pajamarino and
panty raids. Isn't it strange that a
letter could not be tolerated as a
mindless prank.
Similarly, some students
expressed distaste for such a letter
appearing in a student
publication. Students are fast to
condemn adults for never looking
beyond the obvious, for preferring
convenience to understanding, in
facing an issue. Paradoxically,
some of these same students
behaved no better.
Valid expressions of opinion
concerning any printed material
are vital in a democracy. But
when this expression appears as a
personal attack or as a vehicle for
self-gratification, the reply
becomes worse than the original
question.
Thus, in regard to my letter of
January 27; I was wrong to
submit it and I apologize to the
students, faculty and alumni of
Stanford for whatever grief I may
have caused.
Most sincerely,
Tom IJoothe
