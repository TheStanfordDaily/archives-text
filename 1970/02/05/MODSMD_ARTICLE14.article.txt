# Dean Of Chapel Rood
## Humanized Teaching 
### CATHY COOPER 
"Religious education is
concerned with humanizing man,"
asserts Dr. Wayne Rood, Acting
Dean of the Chapel. "There is a
danger that secular education may
become dehumanizing. The role
of theology is to help people see
things as Cod sees them, to help
them govern their own lives."
As Acting Dean of the Chapel,
Rood says he is here "to fill Davie
Napier's space but not to take his
place." Longstanding friends,
Napier persuaded Dr. Rood to
take a leave of absence from his
position as Professor of Religious
Education at Pacific school of
Religion in Berkeley where he has
taught for 1H years. During his six
month appointment, Rood says
he will strive to maintain the
scope and continuity of the
Memorial Church activities.
"The declining appeal of
institutional religion is a positive
thing," states Rood. The
popularity and prosperity of the
church led in great measure to its
institutionalization. Now we are
re-examining who we are.''
He forsees religious experience
becoming essentially a small group
a 1 lair with much larger potential
lor communication and nurturing

fellowship. Christianity will
become much more oriented
towards doing. Ministers in the
future may will earn their living
pursuing their undergraduate
majors; their religious function
will lie in their contribution to the
group they find themselves in,"
Enthusiastic
Dr. Rood talks enthusiastically
about the large educational
component in the total program
of the church.
"It is possible for the
theologians of education to be
more radical than the
philosophers of education."
Currently he is engaged in using
radically different methods to
teach religion.
His undergraduate special
"Drama as a Mode of Old
Testament Interpretation" is
conducted on the hypothesis that
dramatic experience is the link
between man today and the Old
Testament. "Drama is a
laboratory for understanding the
Bible," claims Rood. "We learn by
reading the Scriptures as a script
and improvising on Biblical
themes.
Preaching to large Sunday
morning congregations against the
backdrop of such a n

"architectural piece" as Memorial
Church isn't familiar ground for
Dr. Rood. Nevertheless he seems
to relish his role as preacher.
Commenting on Dr. Napier's
charisma, Rood characterized
Napier as occupying the pulpit as
a prophet while he himself feels it
as a teacher. "But," he adds, "I do
have my prophetic impulses."
Commenting on the sense of
community he feels at Stanford,
Rood pointed to the students as
the ones who "keep the
com m unity from going
intellectualh stale."

fellowship. Christianity will
become much more oriented
towards doing. Ministers in the
future may will earn their living
pursuing their undergraduate
majors; their religious function
will lie in their contribution to the
group they find themselves in,"

Dr. Rood talks enthusiastically
about the large educational
component in the total program
of the church.
"It is possible for the
theologians of education to be
more radical than the
philosophers of education."
Currently he is engaged in using
radically different methods to
teach religion.
His undergraduate special
"Drama as a Mode of Old
Testament Interpretation" is
conducted on the hypothesis that
dramatic experience is the link
between man today and the Old
Testament. "Drama is a
laboratory for understanding the
Bible," claims Rood. "We learn by
reading the Scriptures as a script
and improvising on Biblical
themes.
Preaching to large Sunday
morning congregations against the
backdrop of such a n

"architectural piece" as Memorial
Church isn't familiar ground for
Dr. Rood. Nevertheless he seems
to relish his role as preacher.
Commenting on Dr. Napier's
charisma, Rood characterized
Napier as occupying the pulpit as
a prophet while he himself feels it
as a teacher. "But," he adds, "I do
have my prophetic impulses."
Commenting on the sense of
community he feels at Stanford,
Rood pointed to the students as
the ones who "keep the
com m unity from going
intellectualh stale."
"Religious education is
concerned with humanizing man,"
asserts Dr. Wayne Rood, Acting
Dean of the Chapel. "There is a
danger that secular education may
become dehumanizing. The role
of theology is to help people see
things as Cod sees them, to help
them govern their own lives."
As Acting Dean of the Chapel,
Rood says he is here "to fill Davie
Napier's space but not to take his
place." Longstanding friends,
Napier persuaded Dr. Rood to
take a leave of absence from his
position as Professor of Religious
Education at Pacific school of
Religion in Berkeley where he has
taught for 1H years. During his six
month appointment, Rood says
he will strive to maintain the
scope and continuity of the
Memorial Church activities.
"The declining appeal of
institutional religion is a positive
thing," states Rood. The
popularity and prosperity of the
church led in great measure to its
institutionalization. Now we are
re-examining who we are.''
He forsees religious experience
becoming essentially a small group
a 1 lair with much larger potential
lor communication and nurturing

fellowship. Christianity will
become much more oriented
