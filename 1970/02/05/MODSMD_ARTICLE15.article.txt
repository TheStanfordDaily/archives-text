President Nixon's recent veto
of the Labor and Health
K d u cation, and We If a re
appropriations bill has created a
major crisis in student loans.
Many universities, anticipating the
$229 million in educational
appropriations authorized by
Congress, have suddenly found
themselves overcommitted in
loans. This is due to the fact that
Nixon's veto has reduced the
available Federal funds for
student loans from the anticipated
$229-million to $155 million for
this fiscal year. The result has
been that many students may not
have the financial means to
continue school next semester.
Edward Sanders, vice-president
of the College Entrance
Examination Board estimates that
there will be "tens of thousands
who will bo! be able lo return to
t he classroom for a second
semester," due to the cutback in
I'Vderal student loan funds
The I'Vderal Student loan plan
is a program in which the
government allocates a certain
amount of money to various
universities, which money the
universities then loan to deserving

students. Once the students have
left school, they pay back the
loan over a ten year period at a 3
percent interest rate.
Robert Huff, director of
student finances at Stanford, feels
that students here will not be
seriously affected by the veto of
appropriations. Although Huff is
not yet sure how much Federal
money will be allocated to
Stanford this year, he does not see
any serious financial problems
concerning loans. "Based upon
Nixon's statements this year
concerning Federal spending, we
were very pessimistic in our
estimates as to how much money
Stanford might receive from the
Federal government."
Huff also points out that there
are other means lor students to
obtain money than through
National Defense Loans, which
the vi to mainly affected. Thus,
says Hull', "No student I know of
will be forced to discontinue
school because of the vetoed bill."
However, had the bill not been
vetoed adds Hull', "It would have
meant in th< area of $200,000 in
additional loan funds for Stanford
students."
