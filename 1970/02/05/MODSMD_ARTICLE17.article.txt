# Engineer Cites Problems In State Water Project
## 
### JOHN BOWEN 
Indicating the inactivity of
Federal and State agencies, the
former chairman of the California
State Water Resources Board
called for a program of "planned
management" to prevent the
further destruction of the
Bay-Delta region.
Harvey Banks, presently a
consulting civil engineer in the
Bay Area Tuesday night, discussed
the history and future of the Bay
and the implications of the State
Water Project for the ecology of
the entire state in front of a
gathering of the joint medical
schools of the Bay Area.
"Unfortunately, the State Water
Project has become an end in and
of itself; the needs of the Delta
have been forgotten."
Because he is presently
consulting for both proponents
and opponents of the Project,
Banks stressed the need to
maintain "intellectual objectivity
in trying to ascertain the facts of
the situation." Nevertheless, he
lambasted both Federal and State
officials for their failure to come
up with "any plans for solving the
problems of the Delta."

Banks emphasized th e
differences between the problems
of Bay pollution, primarily caused
by "urban runoff, filling, and
sewage discharges," and the
d e s t r u c t i on of the
Sacramento San Joaquin Delta
area, which stems from a
"complex array" of sources, most
notably the simple "lack of water
in the Delta." The effect of the
Project will be "minimal" in the
Bay, but ma> be "cause for
justified apprehension" with
respect to the Delta
Discussing the history of the
Delta area. Banks outlined the
essentially "man made nature of

the Delta as it stands today." The
effect of "reclaiming" land, a
process begun in the late 19th
century, has been th e
"withdrawing of water from the
peat soils of the Delta, causing
oxidation, flooding, and, simply,
the destruction of the region."
Banks emphasized that "if the
Delta is to be saved, a definite,
planned management is needed,
not simply a moratorium on
development." In other words,
the question of the State Water
Project is "not the crucial
question facing us with respect to
the Delta."
'I'lio Project's Effects
The effect of the Project would
be to give the Federal authorities
control over the amount of water
flowing into the Delta for much
of the year, as part of the larger
purpose of transporting water
from Northern California to the
thirsty and growing Los Angeles
area. Banks fears such power,
citing his "mistrust of the
intentions of (both) the Federal
and State officials â€”we need
legislative directives to guarantee"
the proper supply of water to the
Delta.
Banks pointed out, however,
that "a properly manager program
of fresh water inflow could
enhance the resources of the
Delta, by "reducing the extremes
in variation of the water level." In
fact, he originally introduced the
Project, recognizing that "sooner
or later we're going to have to
bring down some water from the
North "
Ha> Problem
The San Francisco Bay
pollution has not been a result of
water diversions, as has been the
case with the Delta, according to
Banks. "The problem in the Bay
lies in runoff from the Stanford
campus, from the people and

industries around the Bay,
because of the continued growth
of the area. This is the same
problem faced by major
metropolitan areas throughout the
country."
In answers to questions
concerning possible solutions to
the problem in the Delta, Banks
noted the "considerable
drawbacks to use of nuclear
power, either for power itself or
for desalinization." Specifically,
he described the "deleterious
effects on marine life" and the
lack of suitable sites for nuclear
plants.
The problems of pollution and
development of water resources
will have to be solved largely by
the states, concluded Banks; "for
the next twenty years, the Federal
government will not be involved
in water development."
