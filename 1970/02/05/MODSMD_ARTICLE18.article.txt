Senatorial hopeful George E.
Brown, Jr. (D Los Angeles) will be
quizzed by a panel of six student
journalists Thursday at 4:15 p.m.
in Tresidder Large Lounge.
The students, representing six
campus publications of widely
divergent viewpoint, will simulate
a Meet the Press panel to
interview the controversial
Democratic Congressman.
Panelists will include
representatives of the Stanford
I>aiI> , the Black Student Union
Publication, The Colonist, the
Chicano student publication,
Cliicanismo, the conservative
Arena, the Stanford Republican
and Cross Currents, a journalistic
proponent of Eugene McCarthy's
New Politics.
Brown, a longtime anti-war
spokesman, is expected to
announce his candidacy for the
U.S. Senate next week.
Panel moderator David Jones
describes the format as an effort
to increase student in-put in the
electoral process and test
candidates on issues of concern to
students of widely divergent
viewpoints.
Thursday's forum is sponsored
by the Committee for New Politics
and the Stanford Young
Democrats AH are invited.
• • •
W hen the issues of
"Technology & Society" arise, it's
hard to state the problems, much
less to get involved in any sort of
solution.
On the premise that personal
dialogue on common concerns is
missing, a series of small monthly
discussion/dinner groups is being
formed. The hope is for greater
communications part icu la rl y
between the campus and
no n-campus communities, the
students and faculty, where wide
barriers now exist.
The take off point for each of
these will be a panel-symposium,
the first of which is planned for
Sunday, Feb. 8, in Bishop And.
(Business School) at 4 p.m. The
focus will be on Socially
Constructive Technical Careers.
Students, especially in science and
engineering, considering the
alternatives and availabilities of
"clean", responsible employment
in industry or university would be
most interested.
Please make early reservations
for the dinner groups through
Che r i, ext. 2331, in 150
McCullough.
