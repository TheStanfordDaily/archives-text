# Teamsters To Petition Board; Seeking Plant Representation
## 
### ED KOHN 
Local 856 of the Teamsters
Union, which is seeking to
represent Stanford's Physical
Plant employees, decided Tuesday
to file a petition with the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in
San Francisco in its effort to gain
recognition on the campus.
Announcement of the move
followed a meeting of the local in
San Francisco. Rudy Tham,
Secretary-Treasurer of the group,
told reporters yesterday that the
petition would be filed with the
NLRB "early next week," but
Keith Stothers, a steamfitter at
the Plant who coordinates most of
the Teamsters' efforts on the
campus, told the Daily last night
that the suit could be filed later
this week, perhaps Friday.
The petition marks the second
time that a union has gone before
the NLRB in an effort to force
the University to allow a
non-company local to represent
University employees. The last
attempt, in 1964-65, failed when
the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, which had

tried to organize a local at SLAC,
backed down when they learned
that they would have to appeal
the original ruling.
In the University's last official
correspondence on the subject,
Robert M. Nelson, Director of
Personnel and Employee
Relations, told Tham that the
University would not recognize an
outside group in collective
bargaining sessions. He said that,
while the University would not
prohibit the existance of a local, it
would refuse to meet with its
leaders except as individuals.
When reached last night at his
home, Nelson said, "We're a bit in
the dark as to what is going on."
Ho stated that all of his
information about the petition
came from reading newspaper
reports published Wednesday. He
said that other University officials
were similarly "in the dark."
He declined further comment,
saying that it would be
inappropriate for him to comment
further until he knew the exact
nature of the petition's grounds.
Under normal procedures, the

University will learn the grounds
of the petition directly from the
NLRB office in San Francisco.
After the Tuesday meeting,
Stothers said that the San
Francisco-based local was behind
the employee group "100
percent." He added that the
Teamsters hold statements from
"over three-fourths" of the 200
men at the Plant that the
Teamsters seek to represent at
bargaining talks.
Tham could not be reached last
night for comment.
