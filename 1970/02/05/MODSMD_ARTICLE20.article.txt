# Overseas Proposal Log Control Laws

### 
A head-on collision between
logging interests and nearby
residents of redwood-timbered
urban areas in San Mateo and
Marin Counties is shaping up
because of gaps in the legal
controls over lumbering, a
student-faculty group has
concluded after a three-month
study of the situation.
New legislation for zoning and
tax controls are the principal
recommendations of the group. A
summary of their report will be
presented by Prof. Allan Cox this
morning at a special hearing
before the San Mateo County
Board of Supervisors and Planning
Commission who are currently
considering a county moratorium
on logging.
Cox and graduate student
Davison Soper headed a group of
11 undergraduates who carried
out the study during the fall
quarter. It was one of 10 new
st uden t - inst i t u t ed Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social
Issues, for which the participants

received three units of academic
credit.
A key problem is the State
Forest Practice Act giving the
logging industry authority to
regulate itself. The report
indicates county supervisors
should press for a revision of this
act through their state legislators.
Such a bill has already been
drafted by Assemblyman William
Bagley of Marin County, which
would give urban counties some
logging controls.
County planning commissions
should define new zones of
''permanent i onsorva tio 11,
recreation, and managed forest,"
th e rep or I continues.
Kstablislnnent of such zones
would be subject to public
hearings before official passage by
the supervisors.
"Zoning offers a powerful tool
to achieve permanent open space,
yet it should not be used in an
arbitrary way that deprives the
landowner of all gainful ust« of his
land," says lhe report.
