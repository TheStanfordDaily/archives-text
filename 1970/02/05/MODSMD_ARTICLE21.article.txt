As you know by now, this
column emphasizes goofs, not
brilliancies. This chapter is
dedicated to some sloppy defense,
plus a cunning coup pulled off by
the declarer once his opponents
gave him the chance.
North-South were playing weak
one no-trump, 12 to 14 high card
points, which explains South's
opening. North felt cagey, and
decided to mislead the defense by
not trying to find a 4-4 spade fit
(which, luckily for him, wasn't
there) and bid game directly
(theoreticians assert that 12
points opposite 12 should
produce 3 NT, since

transportation between the two
hands is optimal).
North's deception worked, for
West did lead a spade, believing
North to be weak in the majors.
Declarer took East's queen with
his ace, and finessed a spade,
losing to the ten.
East went into a huddle. When
he came out, he had the wrong
answer. He returned the jack of
clubs, which South let win. East
thought again, and again found
the wrong card: the club deuce.
Declarer went up with his king,
dropping the queen. The club
position was now clear: South's
problem was to throw East in
somehow and force him to lead
into dummy's club tenace.
Declarer now finessed spades
again, winning with the nine on
board. The diamond jack was led,
losing to the king. West now
began meditating, and he too
made the wrong return: his last
spade.
The king won in dummy. South
pitching a heart. East had thrown
his two small diamonds on the last
two rounds of spades, leaving him
with two clubs and king-fourth of
hearts. Two rounds of diamonds
forced him to pitch two hearts,
and the stage was set.
South led a heart to dummy's

ace, and East missed his last
opportunity to save the defense
by throwing away his king. He
didn't, and when the last heart
was led off board, it was all over.
East had only his king left, and
was force to win the trick and give
dummy the last two clubs.
If East had pitched his king
under the ace. West's queen-ten
would have been the winning
hearts, and declarer would have
had to cash his club ace for down
one. But if he had there'd have
been no storv.

As you know by now, this
column emphasizes goofs, not
brilliancies. This chapter is
dedicated to some sloppy defense,
plus a cunning coup pulled off by
the declarer once his opponents
gave him the chance.
North-South were playing weak
one no-trump, 12 to 14 high card
points, which explains South's
opening. North felt cagey, and
decided to mislead the defense by
not trying to find a 4-4 spade fit
(which, luckily for him, wasn't
there) and bid game directly
(theoreticians assert that 12
points opposite 12 should
produce 3 NT, since

transportation between the two
hands is optimal).
North's deception worked, for
West did lead a spade, believing
North to be weak in the majors.
Declarer took East's queen with
his ace, and finessed a spade,
losing to the ten.
East went into a huddle. When
he came out, he had the wrong
answer. He returned the jack of
clubs, which South let win. East
thought again, and again found
the wrong card: the club deuce.
Declarer went up with his king,
dropping the queen. The club
position was now clear: South's
problem was to throw East in
somehow and force him to lead
into dummy's club tenace.
Declarer now finessed spades
again, winning with the nine on
board. The diamond jack was led,
losing to the king. West now
began meditating, and he too
made the wrong return: his last
spade.
The king won in dummy. South
pitching a heart. East had thrown
his two small diamonds on the last
two rounds of spades, leaving him
with two clubs and king-fourth of
hearts. Two rounds of diamonds
forced him to pitch two hearts,
and the stage was set.
South led a heart to dummy's

ace, and East missed his last
opportunity to save the defense
by throwing away his king. He
didn't, and when the last heart
was led off board, it was all over.
East had only his king left, and
was force to win the trick and give
dummy the last two clubs.
If East had pitched his king
under the ace. West's queen-ten
would have been the winning
hearts, and declarer would have
had to cash his club ace for down
one. But if he had there'd have
been no storv.
