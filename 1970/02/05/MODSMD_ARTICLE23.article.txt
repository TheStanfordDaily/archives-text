# Juilliard Ouartet Unmatched
## 
### DANA GIOIA CHARIE MASSION 
Perhaps the greatest danger of
today's large-scale accessibility to
recorded music is that the record
might replace the live
performance. A record can
reproduce the perfect
performance with perfect sonics
for nearly an infinite number of
times and costs about half as
much as a pair of concert tickets.
However, after seeing two
performances of the Juilliard
String Quartet, one must agree
with Stravinsky that "music must
be seen as well as heard."
Watching the intricate physical
mechanics of these four
extraordinary musicians adds a
dimension that simply is not
possible even with the finest
stereo components. Each nuance
of Beethoven's composition can
be transformed from an
insignificant marK on a lined page
to magnificent sound only
through human skill.
Alter seeing the Monday and
Wednesday programs of the
Juilliard, a concertgoer may
realize, perhaps for the first time,
what is sacrificed for the
expediency of a record. Music,
divorced from musicians, is
incomplete.
The members of the Juilliard
Quartet, Robert Mann, violin; Earl
Carlyss, violin; Samual Rhodes,
viola; and Claus Adam, cello; have
played together since 1946.
Concert halls from Taiwan to the
USSR to Europe have hosted the
Juilliard. Their repertoire ranges
from the classics—Haydn, Mozart,
and Beethoven —to the moderns of
Europe —Bartok, and Schoenberg,
andof America—Copeland, Sessions
and Piston.
Beethoven Cycle
One of the most difficult
projects attempted by the four
was the performance of a
complete cycle of the Beethoven
Quartets, which has been realized

in Sun Francisco, Cambridge, New
York, and now partially in the
Beethoven t ycle being performed
at Stanford. The final concert
tonight, Thursday, Feb. 5, will
conclude the series of eight
quartets and will include the
"Grosse Fugue," which is often
considered the seventeenth
quartet.
The first two concerts provided
a cross-section of Beethoven's
output in the media of the string
quartet. Both the Monday and
Wednesday programs began with
an early work from Beethoven's
first venture into the string
quartet form.
These two early works, the
Quartet in C Minor, Opus 18, No.
4; and the Quartet in A Major,
Opus 18, No. 5; both composed in
1800 show the still youthful
Beethoven following the style of
the older Viennese composers,
especially his own music teacher,
Joseph Haydn.
The Julliard performed both of
these works with the calculated
grace and precision that the
stylized music of 1800 Vienna
requires. Everything was
controlled. Even the scherzo
sections ("scherzo" is Italian for
joke) were the type of jokes
which could be told in polite
company.
Middle Quarters Included
Both concerts continued with
pieces from Beethoven's middle
period: the Quartet in E Flat
Major, Opus 74; and the Quartet
in F Minor, Opus 95. The first
quartet receives its nickname,
"The Harp," from the pizzacato
accompaniment in the first
movement.
These quartets show Beethoven
more secure in the string quartet
technique. He no longer sounds
like Haydn or Mozart, but has
forged his own definitive style.
The Julliard capitalized on the
wider emotional gamut of these
works, revealing possibilities

undreamt of in earlier
compositions.
The final years of a great artist
often show decline or
continuation, but rarely
culmination of his growth.
However, Beethoven's final works
demonstrate overwhelmingly that
this pattern can be shattered.
Late Quartet Expressive
The last selections, on both
Monday (the Quartet in F Major,
Opus 135) and Wednesday (tin
Quartet in E Flat Major, Opus
127) date from Beethoven's last
years. These quartets, composed
when Beethoven was already
entirely deaf, contain every good
connotation of the word
"romantic."
They were personal, grandiose,
and most importantly, beautiful.
The music possesses an immense
emotional range, over which the
Juilliard exercised complete
control.
Undoubtedly the best moment
in both concerts occurred in the
slow movement of the F Majo
Quartet when Robert Mann, the
first violinist, played an
unmatched musical statement of
emotion. One would gladly sil
through ten bad concerts for one
moment of his.
During this year, which marks
the two hundredth anniversary of
Beethoven's birth, audiences
around the world are being
subjected to pianists, orchestras,
quartets and singers frantically
racing each other and time to
honor the great composer.
Many concertgoers will
probably never want to hear mo."'
of it again.
Yet occasional moments of
genuine inspiration, such as the
Juilliard String Quartet
performances, make the excess
worthwhile.
The final performance at
Stanford of the Juilliard Quarte
will be tonight at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
