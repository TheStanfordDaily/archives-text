# End-Quarter Quickies
## 
### CATHY COOPER 
I hereby admit that there are
times when I'd rather go hungry
than cook—these occasions tend
to occur more frequently towards
the end of the quarter. (I've felt
this way for the past week and a
half.) By finals week we're living
on coffee and cookies.
Before that period of utter
desperation, I tend to rely on
several insanely simple recipes
that happen (luckily) to taste
good.
FOILED POT ROAST
1 pot roast
1 package dehydrated onion soup
mix
V2 c. red wine
Mix soup and wine. Place roast
on large piece of aluminum foil,
pour soup mixture over it and
wrap foil around meat to form an
airtight package. Cook at 325
degrees for one hour for each
pound of roast.
This is great because, unless
you cook for an army, there are

left overs and you don't have to
cook tomorrow!
EPICUREAN BEEF
1 lb stewing beef
V4 c. red wine
1 can condensed consomme
1 t. salt
1/8 t. pepper
1 sliced onion
Vic. dry break crumbs
l A c. flour
Mix flour and crumbs and stir
into everything else. Cover and
bake 3 hours at 300 degrees.
Serves 3 or so.
This recipe is a result of my
inability to make Swedish meat
balls, so instead we have
SWEDISH SLUSH
1 lb. hamburger
1 egg
2/3 c. bread crumbs
1 '/2 c. milk
1 chopped onion
2 t. salt
V\ t. pepper
V6 c. sherry
Mix everything and brown in
skillet. Serve over rice.
