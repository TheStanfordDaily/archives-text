# Streaking Elis In Saturday
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
"Yale's swimming team," reads the Yale
prospectus, "perennially strong and riding a
52 meet winning streak should be as good as ever."
The streak is now up to 57; should the Elis
defeat Columbis this afternoon, they will have
won 58 meets since their last dual meet loss in the
late 'GO's ("to Army or North Carolina, I don't
remember which," said Stanford's Jim Gaughran.)
To get their fifty-ninth victory, however, the Yale
tankers are going to have to live up to the glowing
reports of the Yale Sports Information
Deportment Meet No. 59 is this Saturday at Encina
Pool, and the third-ranked Indians are out to
avenge last year's loss to a Yale squad as loaded as
Stanford with top performers.
All times listed in this article are Yale bests for
the '68-'69 season. Thus far into 1970, the Eli's
times have not been very impressive, indicative
both of poor opposition back East and of
top-performance goals to be aimed lor, and
hopefully achieved, this Saturday. Yale has so far
demolished such super non-powers as Southern
Connecticut, Cornell, Army, Colgate, and Navy.
Stanford has done the same, beating Washington
State, Washington, Santa Clara, and Cal.
Yale is led by the senior trio of John Nelson,
Phil Long, and captain Ed Bettendorf. Nelson, a
medal winner in two Olympic Games, is one of the
nation's most formidable distance swimmers. In
last year's NCAA Championships, Nelson placed
fourth in the 200 free, fourth in the 500, and
seventh in the 1650.
Last year, against Stanford, Nelson swam the
1000-yd. freestyle in 9:49.8 to give him the Yale
record. I iis record time for the 500 free is 4:39.8,
swum two years ago at Hanover, N.H.
Phil Long, holder of the Yale record for both
the 100 and 200-yd. breaststroke, placed seventh
in the 200-meter event at Mexico City. During the
'68-'69 season, Long went 2: 10.6 for the 200, and
placed seventh in the event at the NCAA's,
finishing behind (among others) Stanford's Dave
Shilling.
Ed Bettendorf and Fred Haywood are both
backstrokers and both captains of their respective
teams. Bettendorf holds the Yale record for the
100-yd. backstroke ( 52.7, against Stanford,, and

swam on the 400-yd. medley relay team which
boat Stanford last year with a 3:38.6 clocking. He
lost the 200 race in the NCAA's last year.
Haywood won.
The Yale record-holder for the 200-yd.
backstroke is senior Chuck Goettsche 1:56.3
which he performed as a sophomore. The
three-time Illinois backstroke champion has since
been plagued with physical problems, and is
seeking to regain his earlier form.
Paul Katz last year captured the 200-yd.
butterfly in the Stanford meet, with a Yale-record
time of 1:54.2. He was a member of the same
Maccabiah squad as ill-fated basketball player Jack
Langer, and lost to Stanford's John Ferris at
Indiana last year. He is joined by sophomore
butterflier Rich Guelff has gone 2:01.4 for the
200, six seconds off Ferris' season best time.
The spring freestylers are led by junior Mike
Cadden, and sophomores Jim Denvir, Bill
Goerlich, and Bob Kasting. Cadden has swum
1:43.7 for the 200-yd. freestyle, and placed sixth
in last year's NCAA's. Denvir has gone 1:45.4 for
the 200, and:22.7 for 50 yards.
Goerlich has posted :48.1 for the 100 free;
Kasting and sophomore Rich May are a tenth of a
second slower. May and teammate Dean Kackley,
a key sprinter for the Elis, have gone :22.1 for the
50.
Other top prospects for the Yale squad, come
Saturday afternoon, will be backstroker Ben Clark
(2:05.3 for the 200); breaststroker Pete Lawler
(2:19.9 for 200 yards); and all-around performers
Brad McKean and Allan Zimmer (2:02.1 ;mcl
2:07.4, respectively, for the 200-yd. individual
medley.)
Sophomore Rick Kineade will carry the diving
burden against Stanford's undefeated diving squad
of Bill Main and Ted Nichols.
In evaluating the 1970 Yale squad, Coach
Gaughran said that overall, the team is not as
strong as last year. "Most of their top swimmers
are back," he admits, "but they won't have as
much depth as they did last year. Eli Coach Phil
Moriarty will be pressed for adequate depth in the
breaststroke, butterfly, and diving events.
A complete rundown of Stanford prospects and
expectations for Saturday's meet will be featured
in tomorrow's Daily.


LEADERS OF THE PACKâ€”YaIe and Stanford will square off Saturday
afternoon in Encina pool, and one of the prime match ups will be between the
teams' captains in the backstroke. Ed Bettendorf (right) will face Stanford's
Fred Haywood (below) in a rematch of the 200 meter NCAA race last year.
Haywood won.
