# The 						President As Analyst

### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Life Magazine's disclosure that
President Nixon relishes the
sportscasting limelight almost as
much as the presidency lias
sparked considerable speculation
regarding what it would be like to
have Mr. Nixon broadcasting
major sporting events. Historical
precedent dictates that Nixon
would leave office in January of
either 1973 or 1977. After a
couple of months of relaxation,
which would probably include
getting Pat settled with David and
Julie, Nixon would be just in time
to inaugurate (he'd use that word)
a new major league baseball
season.
"Good afternoon, baseball fans.
This is Curt Gowdy along with
Dick Nixon (It-Calif.) bringing
you the game between the
Washington Senators and the New
York Yankees. Dick is down on
the field for a pre-game interview,
so I'll turn the mike over to him."
"Thank you, Mr. Gowdy, and
good afternoon my fellow
Americans. Standing next to me is
Frank Howard, the man who gives
The Washington Senators
first-strike capibility. What sort of
season do you expect, Frank?"
"Well, Dick, I'm really excited
about this season. We finally think
we have a well-balanced ball club.
Personally, I hope to have another
great year. As you know, last year
I was selected the Most Valuable
Plaver."
"Yes, I know that, Frank. Uh,
last year I was the President."
"Yes, sir."
"Do you have any more
questions, Frank?"
"No, sir."
"Well, Mr. Gowdy, that about
wraps up the pre-game briefing.
I'll turn it back over to you and
join you after I shave."
"Thanks, Dick.
"Back again, fans. The game is
just about to start, and for those
of you who just tuned in, I'm
Curt Gowdy calling the
play-by-play, along with Dick
Nixon who'll be providing the
color."
"Let me say this: I'll do all I
can to provide the color. I realize
some have criticized the way I've
provided for the colored in the
past, but this is a new ball game."
"Is there anything else you'd
like to say before the game
begins?"
"Yes. There are those who
would accuse me of biased
broadcasting in today's game. Let
me make one thing perfectly
clear: The fact that I used to be a
Washington Senator won't effect
the way I call the game. After all,
we're all Yankees • - - ha ha. . ."

Washington Senators and the New
York Yankees. Dick is down on
the field for a pre-game interview,
so I'll turn the mike over to him."
"Thank you, Mr. Gowdy, and
good afternoon my fellow
Americans. Standing next to me is
Frank Howard, the man who gives
The Washington Senators
first-strike capibility. What sort of
season do you expect, Frank?"
"Well, Dick, I'm really excited
about this season. We finally think
we have a well-balanced ball club.
Personally, I hope to have another
great year. As you know, last year
I was selected the Most Valuable
Plaver."
"Yes, I know that, Frank. Uh,
last year I was the President."
"Yes, sir."
"Do you have any more
questions, Frank?"
"No, sir."
"Well, Mr. Gowdy, that about
wraps up the pre-game briefing.
I'll turn it back over to you and
join you after I shave."
"Thanks, Dick.
"Back again, fans. The game is
just about to start, and for those
of you who just tuned in, I'm
Curt Gowdy calling the
play-by-play, along with Dick
Nixon who'll be providing the
color."
"Let me say this: I'll do all I
can to provide the color. I realize
some have criticized the way I've
provided for the colored in the
past, but this is a new ball game."
"Is there anything else you'd
like to say before the game
begins?"
"Yes. There are those who
would accuse me of biased
broadcasting in today's game. Let
me make one thing perfectly
clear: The fact that I used to be a
Washington Senator won't effect
the way I call the game. After all,
we're all Yankees • - - ha ha. . ."
Life Magazine's disclosure that
President Nixon relishes the
sportscasting limelight almost as
much as the presidency lias
sparked considerable speculation
regarding what it would be like to
have Mr. Nixon broadcasting
major sporting events. Historical
precedent dictates that Nixon
would leave office in January of
either 1973 or 1977. After a
couple of months of relaxation,
which would probably include
getting Pat settled with David and
Julie, Nixon would be just in time
to inaugurate (he'd use that word)
a new major league baseball
season.
"Good afternoon, baseball fans.
This is Curt Gowdy along with
Dick Nixon (It-Calif.) bringing
you the game between the
Washington Senators and the New
York Yankees. Dick is down on
the field for a pre-game interview,
so I'll turn the mike over to him."
