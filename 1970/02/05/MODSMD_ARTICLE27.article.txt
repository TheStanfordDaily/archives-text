# Palmer Leads League
## 
### 
Although Stanford's varsity basketball squad is currently mired in
the Pacific-8 cellar with California, league statistics show they may be
better than their record indicates.
The biggest surprise is in the rebound category. With the smallest
front line in the conference, Stanford ranks third in team rebounding,
averaging 46.4 per game. In fact, center Bill Palmer, 6-7, is tied for
first individually with USC's Ron Riley, averaging 11 a game.
Dennis O'Neill (17.4) is fifth in scoring, and his backcourt partner
Claude Terry (16.0) is ninth. Unbeaten UCLA is paced by league
leading Curtis Rowe (18.8), John Vallely (fourth, 18.3), and Henry
Bibby (tenth, 15.8).
Stanford's O'Neill placed second in free throw percentage in the
new statistics with a .868 average.
The Indian troubles come on defense. They rank last in the league
in team defense, allowing 78.4 points per contest. The Tribe averages
72 per game on offense, fourth in the Pac-8.
Only OSU shoots better from the free throw line. Stanford hits
71.9 per cent to the Beavers' 77.3.
