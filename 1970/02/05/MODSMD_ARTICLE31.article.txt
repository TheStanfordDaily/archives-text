# CBW Forum To Be Held Here
## 
### 
A "Chemical and Biological
Warfare Forum," a two-day series
of discussions sponsored by the
Life Science Caucus, will be held
on campus this weekend.
The purpose of the forum will
be to "keep public discussion
going on the issue," according to
Dale Hattis, a graduate student in
genetics and a leader of the
Caucus.
The question of CBW, Hattis
stressed, is "not over" because of
President Nixon's recent decisions
on limiting U.S. activity in the
area.
Four informal discussions will
be held Friday in the Small
Lounge of Tressider. Hattis said
the program will be "good general
discussions" among people with
knowledge in the field of CBW.

Talk will center on possible
structures to control the use of
chemical and biological agents.
On Saturday, three panel
discussions will be held in
Memorial Church. The discussions
will seek to get "frank exchanges
of views" between panel
members. Hattis stressed that this
would be achieved through "a
thorough exposition of different
points of view."
Members on a 9:30 a.m.
discussion of "Police Policies on
Chemical Agents" will be Capt.
Edward Cummins, SF Police
Dept.; Dr. Sumner Kalman,
Stanford Pharmacology Dept.; Mr.
Steve Ilia, Pacific Studies
Technology and Society Dept.
and Dr. Joe Nielands, Stanford
Biochemistry Dept.

Participating in "Herbicides in
Vietnam," slated for 1 p.m.. are:
Dr. Gordon Orians, Univ. of
Washington Zoology Dept.; Dr.
A.S. Crafts, U.C. Davis Botany
Dept. and Dr. L.A. Herzenberg,
Stanford Genetics Dept.
The highlight of the Forum will
be the final panel discussion, "The
President's C.B.W. Directives", to
be held at 3 p.m. It will deal with
the new policies; what has been
done so far and what remains to
be done.
Members of the panel are: Dr.
Joshua Lederberg, Stanford
Genetics Dept.; Dr. Victor Sidel,
Division of Biological Medicine,
Montefiore Hospital and Medical
Center, New York and Dr.
Herbert Boyer, UC Medical
School, San Francisco
Microbiology Dept.
