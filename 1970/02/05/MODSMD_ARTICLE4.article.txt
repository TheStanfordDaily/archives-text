# Chicanos Decry Demerit System
## School Protest 
### TOM GIVEN 
"Los Chicanos en masse," a
sign read.
"La raza against the demerit
system," said another.
The small group of pickets
looked out of place on the quiet
suburban street. Parading in front
of a house, they drew curious
looks from Anglo motorists and
neighborhood kids.
As members of either
MECHA—the Stanford Chicano
organization—or the Concerned
Mexican American Community,
they were picketing the homes of
board members of Mountain View
Elementary School District.
Their demands for abolition of
the demerit system, hiring of
more Mexican American teachers
and administrators, institution of
relevant Mexican American
studies, and establishment of a
Mexican American Citizens
Advisory Committee, are part of
an effort to end what they feel is
an 'out-of-place' status in the
Mountain View school.
Demerit System
The demerit system, initiated
by the school system this year is
the most pressing bone of
contention. Designed to help
teachers discipline students, it
permits demerits to be allotted for
any number of offenses.
According to the Teacher's
Code for Graham Junior High
School, "Minor violations" such

as loitering in the bicycle area or
not having equipment (pencil,
paper, books, etc.) can bring one
demerit, while more serious
offenses such as smoking, cutting
class, or possession of radios can
merit up to five demerits.

The issue broke into the open
this week when the district
suspended Ruben Michel, a junior
high school student, for
accumulating too many demerits.
Ted Martinez, a member of
M EC II A, called the demerit
system a handy excuse for
discrimination in schools. A
former tutor at Mountain View
High School, he felt that some
teachers, "not only resent
Chicanos in their classes, but are
openly racist."
The demerit system is in many
ways symptomatic of frictions
between the Chicano and Anglo
communities. While possession of
school supplies may be relatively
simple for the average
suburbanite, many Mexican
students have trouble paying for
supplies, gym equipment, and the
other paraphernalia needed for
school. Chicano leaders point this
out as the most obvious flaw with
the demerit system.
Overpass Project
In addition, Chicanos object to
the Bailey Street overpass project,

which has dislocated about a
hundred Mexican families. Most
have found other housing, though
some have had to change jobs or
quit them altogether in light of
transportation difficulties.
This past weekend concerned
Chicanos have focused on the
school situation. The afternoon's
picketing was followed with
further informational picketing at
the Board meeting last night.
The group presented a list of
thirteen demands including
immediate reinstatement of
Michel, removal of the current
school psychologist, inviting of
relevant Mexican American
speakers to classes, establishment
of a relevant Chicano curriculum,
and implementation of an
in-service training on Chicanos for
all teachers.
Other demands were
establishment of a Chicano parent
screening committee for new
Chicano farulty and staff, and
hiring of a Mexican-American
Counselor.
