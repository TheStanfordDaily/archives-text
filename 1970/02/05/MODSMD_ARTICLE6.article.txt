# Sub-councils Proposed
## SJC Decentralized 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
In its first legislative action of
the year, the Student Conduct
Legislative Council has submitted
a proposal for the establishment
of sub-ordinate judicial councils in
the various schools within the
University.
The measure, enacted by the
legislative arm of the SJC, is
designed primarily to relieve the
Judicial Council of most cases
involving the Honor Code. It

further allows the individual
graduate schools to try cases
within their own jurisdiction of
professional ethics.
Under the new proposal, the
schools of Business, Education,
Law and Medicine would draw up
plans for the subordinate judicial
bodies and, upon approval by the
SCLC, assume jurisdiction over
Honor Code violations by
students of that school.

More importantly, each council
will act on violations of
professional ethics "where a
written code or statement of such
ethics has been independently
adopted by a formal vote of both
the student body and faculty of
that school and approved by the
SCLC, and is annually published
and distributed to the students in
the school."
SJC Relay
If there are no objections from
the University community
regarding the SCLC resolution by
' February 27, the door will be
open for the individual schools to
submit their proposals.
If the new 3-7 member
faculty-student judicial bodies are
indeed instituted, the SJC will still
field complaints initially, and then
relay them to the appropriate
sub-council for action. If,
however, the subordinate council
fails to act on a complaint within
a reasonable amount of time, the
SJC may re-assert jurisdiction over
the case.
Any student tried and found
guilty by a subordinate committee
maintains his right of appeal to
the SJC. Grounds of appeal
include lack of jurisdiction, denial
of procedural rights, and findings
of fact manifestly contrary to the
evidence. Errors in interpretations
of the rules governing student
conduct or a penalty "grossly
inappropriate to the offense" also
provide a basis for appeal.
The judicial sanctions available
to the subordinate council will be
identical to those available to the
SJC.
Draft Submitted
A draft of the proposed
resolution has been sent to
President Pitzer, the Academic
Council and the student Senate.
The SCLC is waiting out the 21
day period provided for in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968 to allow time for
community response to the
proposal.
Comments and suggested
revisions of the resolution should
be submitted in writing to
£ Professor Hubert Marshall,
* Chairman SCLC, c/o Department
y of Political Science, on or before
February 27.

112 Presidents, at the ASSU office

In its first legislative action of
the year, the Student Conduct
Legislative Council has submitted
a proposal for the establishment
of sub-ordinate judicial councils in
the various schools within the
University.
The measure, enacted by the
legislative arm of the SJC, is
designed primarily to relieve the
Judicial Council of most cases
involving the Honor Code. It

further allows the individual
graduate schools to try cases
within their own jurisdiction of
professional ethics.
Under the new proposal, the
schools of Business, Education,
Law and Medicine would draw up
plans for the subordinate judicial
bodies and, upon approval by the
SCLC, assume jurisdiction over
Honor Code violations by
students of that school.

More importantly, each council
will act on violations of
professional ethics "where a
written code or statement of such
ethics has been independently
adopted by a formal vote of both
the student body and faculty of
that school and approved by the
SCLC, and is annually published
and distributed to the students in
the school."
SJC Relay
If there are no objections from
the University community
regarding the SCLC resolution by
' February 27, the door will be
open for the individual schools to
submit their proposals.
If the new 3-7 member
faculty-student judicial bodies are
indeed instituted, the SJC will still
field complaints initially, and then
relay them to the appropriate
sub-council for action. If,
however, the subordinate council
fails to act on a complaint within
a reasonable amount of time, the
SJC may re-assert jurisdiction over
the case.
Any student tried and found
guilty by a subordinate committee
maintains his right of appeal to
the SJC. Grounds of appeal
include lack of jurisdiction, denial
of procedural rights, and findings
of fact manifestly contrary to the
evidence. Errors in interpretations
of the rules governing student
conduct or a penalty "grossly
inappropriate to the offense" also
provide a basis for appeal.
The judicial sanctions available
to the subordinate council will be
identical to those available to the
SJC.
Draft Submitted
A draft of the proposed
resolution has been sent to
President Pitzer, the Academic
Council and the student Senate.
The SCLC is waiting out the 21
day period provided for in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968 to allow time for
community response to the
proposal.
Comments and suggested
revisions of the resolution should
be submitted in writing to
£ Professor Hubert Marshall,
* Chairman SCLC, c/o Department
y of Political Science, on or before
February 27.
