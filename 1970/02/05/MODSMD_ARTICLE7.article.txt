## G.E. Workers Accept Contract 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Some
100,000 General Electric Co.
workers on strike for 101 days
prepared to start returning to
work Thursday after voting by a
margin of nearly 3-1 to accept a
new contract.
Voting had not been reported
from the remaining 30,000
strikers.
"They'll start going back
tomorrow, depending on local
operations," said a spokesman for
the AFL-CIO International Union
of Electrical Workers, largest of
the 13 unions with 78,000
members in the nationwide strike.
The independent United
Electrical Workers respresenting
some 16,000 workers also
approved the contract and was
expected to send its members
back on the job. The American
Flint Glass Workers accepted
similar contract terms for its small
unit in GE's Logan, Ohio, plant,
and an 80-member unit of

Firemen and Oilers in Louisville,
Ky., also voted approval.
AFL-CIO sheet Metal Workers
approved the settlement with
GE's Hotpoint division in
Chicago.
But the AFL-CIO International
Association of Machinists said it
would recommend its 14,000
members in 34 GE plants reject
the contract. There was no
immediate report from the rest of
the unions invovled.
The contract would provide an
estimated 61 to 82 cents an hour
in pay raises over 40 months for
most of the workers, depending
on whether sing living costs
triggered the full amount of
cost-of-living pay in the
agreement. Some workers,
receiving up to 25 cents an hour
more in special skills pay, would
get more.
Polluting Halt
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon said Wednesday he is giving
federal agencies three years and
$359 million to stop polluting the
air and water.
It already has been federal
policy to conform with existing
air and water quality standards,
but Nixon said previous orders
were "ambiguously worded,
poorly enforced, and generally
ineffective."
Nixon issued an executive order
requiring all federal
facilities-including "buildings,
installations, structures, public
works, equipment, aircraft,
vessels, and other vehicles and
property "-to complete or at least
begin necessary pollution

abatement actions by Dec. 31,
1972, at the latest.
Agency heads were ordered to
send their plans for meeting that
deadline to the Budget Bureau by
next June 30. Funds appropriated
to clean up federal pollution may
not be used for any other
prupose, Nixon ordered.
Censorship ?
WASHINGTON (AP)
Government licensing of reporters
was suggested Wednesday by a
member of the national violence
commission. He said such
certification would increase public
confidence in the news media
while weeding out "individuals
who are totally inept."
"This in no way assures
complete perfection of the
profession," said Dr. W. Walter
Menninger, a psychiatrist and at
38 the youngest of the 13
members on the National
Commission on the Causes and
Prevention of Violence.
It would serve, however, as
licensing of doctors, lawyers and
teachers serves, "to assure the
public that the practitioners of
the art are qualified
practitioners," Menninger said.

His suggestion drew this
reaction from Filbert P. Smith,
managing editor of the Utica,
N.Y., Observer-Dispatch and
president of the Associated Press
Managing Editors Association:
"A license never made a doctor
good or competent. Certification
never has made a good teacher."
Smith said the doctor's
statement "is to say the least,
unworthy of him."
Menninger, a staff psychiatrist
at the Topeka, Kan., mental
health foundation that bears his
family name, said some segments
of American society feel their
only channel to the news media is
through violent action.

Polluting Halt
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon said Wednesday he is giving
federal agencies three years and
$359 million to stop polluting the
air and water.
It already has been federal
policy to conform with existing
air and water quality standards,
but Nixon said previous orders
were "ambiguously worded,
poorly enforced, and generally
ineffective."
Nixon issued an executive order
requiring all federal
facilities-including "buildings,
installations, structures, public
works, equipment, aircraft,
vessels, and other vehicles and
property "-to complete or at least
begin necessary pollution

abatement actions by Dec. 31,
1972, at the latest.
Agency heads were ordered to
send their plans for meeting that
deadline to the Budget Bureau by
next June 30. Funds appropriated
to clean up federal pollution may
not be used for any other
prupose, Nixon ordered.
Censorship ?
WASHINGTON (AP)
Government licensing of reporters
was suggested Wednesday by a
member of the national violence
commission. He said such
certification would increase public
confidence in the news media
while weeding out "individuals
who are totally inept."
"This in no way assures
complete perfection of the
profession," said Dr. W. Walter
Menninger, a psychiatrist and at
38 the youngest of the 13
members on the National
Commission on the Causes and
Prevention of Violence.
It would serve, however, as
licensing of doctors, lawyers and
teachers serves, "to assure the
public that the practitioners of
the art are qualified
practitioners," Menninger said.

His suggestion drew this
reaction from Filbert P. Smith,
managing editor of the Utica,
N.Y., Observer-Dispatch and
president of the Associated Press
Managing Editors Association:
"A license never made a doctor
good or competent. Certification
never has made a good teacher."
Smith said the doctor's
statement "is to say the least,
unworthy of him."
Menninger, a staff psychiatrist
at the Topeka, Kan., mental
health foundation that bears his
family name, said some segments
of American society feel their
only channel to the news media is
through violent action.
Lunar Truer
SAIGON (AP)—A 96-hour lunar

across South Vietnam.
No major new outbreaks of
fighting were reported in the last
hours before the beginning of the
lunar new year Tet period,
officers said.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Some
100,000 General Electric Co.
workers on strike for 101 days
prepared to start returning to
work Thursday after voting by a
margin of nearly 3-1 to accept a
new contract.
Voting had not been reported
from the remaining 30,000
strikers.
"They'll start going back
tomorrow, depending on local
operations," said a spokesman for
the AFL-CIO International Union
of Electrical Workers, largest of
the 13 unions with 78,000
members in the nationwide strike.
The independent United
Electrical Workers respresenting
some 16,000 workers also
approved the contract and was
expected to send its members
back on the job. The American
Flint Glass Workers accepted
similar contract terms for its small
unit in GE's Logan, Ohio, plant,
and an 80-member unit of

Firemen and Oilers in Louisville,
Ky., also voted approval.
AFL-CIO sheet Metal Workers
approved the settlement with
GE's Hotpoint division in
Chicago.
But the AFL-CIO International
Association of Machinists said it
would recommend its 14,000
members in 34 GE plants reject
the contract. There was no
immediate report from the rest of
the unions invovled.
The contract would provide an
estimated 61 to 82 cents an hour
in pay raises over 40 months for
most of the workers, depending
on whether sing living costs
triggered the full amount of
cost-of-living pay in the
agreement. Some workers,
receiving up to 25 cents an hour
more in special skills pay, would
get more.
