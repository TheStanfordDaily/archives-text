"Almost all men, in all ages and countries, |
have at times made use of prayer. Thence
I reasoned, that, if all things were ordained, (
prayer must among the rest be ordained. [
l!ut, as prayer can procure no change in
things ordained, praying must be useless,
and an absudity. God would therefore, not !
ordain praying, if everything else was or- j
dained. But praying exists, therefore all i
things are not ordained Vic." Benjamin j
Franklin.
To triumph in love need not be less eomlex
than tn triumph in war.
To lose at love is certainly as devastating at
losing at war.

I reasoned, that, if all things were ordained, (
prayer must among the rest be ordained. [
l!ut, as prayer can procure no change in
things ordained, praying must be useless,
and an absudity. God would therefore, not !
ordain praying, if everything else was or- j
