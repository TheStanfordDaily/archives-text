# Student Senate Calls For Investigation Of 'Arena' By Publications Board
## 
### TINA COOPER 
In the wake of a blistering
attack on the Arena by Student
Financial Manager David Swift,
the Student Senate last night
angrily demanded that the
Publications Board review the
status of the newspaper.
If the Board decides that the
Arena is being published illegally,
it will not be allowed on campus.
The object of Swift's attack
was an article in yesterday's Arena
accusing him, and the ASSU in
general, of extremely irresponsible
financial practices.
As Harvey Hukari, of the
Arena, smiled disinterestedly,
Swift detailed the article's
accusations one by one and
countered each one with what he
called "the facts."

Hukari, when questioned after
the Senate meeting, disagreed
with Swift's explanations.
Swift also demanded that the
Arena print a front-page
retraction of its charges, on behalf
of the ASSU in general. "I want as
much attention given to this," he
said, "as to the original article."
Retraction Asked
He ended his speech by adding
that the Dean of Students also
intended to send a letter to the
Arena asking for a retraction.
As Swift sat down, the Senate
gave him an enthusiastic ovation.
Hukari later said that the Arena
would not print large-scale
retractions.
"We may be mistaken on some
small issues, and we will admit
that in the Arena," he said, "but

our figures are mainly correct and
we will stand by them."
"We just want to point out that
more people besides just Roger
Reed have been spending money
irresponsibly. If he's going to go
down, then some of the rest of
them should go too."
The Senate's action in
demanding that the Publications
Board review the status of the
Arena on campus was based on a
provision in the by-laws of the
Stanford constitution.
The Arena is not registered as a
student publication with the
Publications Board. This is
required by the by-laws if a
newspaper is to contain
advertising, which the Arena does.
Broken The Rules
On the other hand, if the Arena
is an official ASSU student
publication, Swift said that it has
broken almost every rule covering
publications in the by-laws. For
instance, it has not reported its
financial status.
After these points were brought
out by Swift, the Senate felt that
possible illegalities in the
publication of the Arena should
be subject to review by the
Publications Board. A motion
suggesting this, proposed by
Senator Peter Carpenter, was
enthusiastically passed by the
Senate.
Some Senators were for more
extreme measures. One, Senator
Frank Philpot, suggested the
possibility of a libel suit against
the Arena.
When asked if he will defend
the Arena to the Publications
Board, Hukari replied, "I'm going
to ask why they waited until
now."
"The Arena has been in
operation on this campus for two
years. No one has questioned the
legality of the paper before now.
Why now?"
Spending Practices
He went on to propose a
possible explanation.
"The Senate just got on us now
because we were exposing the
ASSU spending practices. They
wouldn't have said anything—they
wouldn't have attacked us—if we
hadn't attacked them"
One Senator, Doug McHenry,
expressed his opinion that the
Arena article was part of "a
planned conspiracy to attack the
ASSU."
"Each issue," he charged, "has
been aimed at one segment of the
ASSU — the Senate,
Financial Manager or whatever —to
reduce its credibility with the
students.
"I think the Arena did it just to
make a political point—and I
think it was time that Dave Swift
came forward to counter the
Arena."
Responding to McHenry's
accusation, Hukari later said, "If
this is a planned conspiracy by the
Arena to get at the ASSU, then he
and the other Senators should sign
a complicity statement. They have

done as much as anyone to
discredit the Senate."
Daily Budget
Hukari would only admit to
one mistake in the Arena article,
one concerning the budget of the
Daily. The article had stated that
the Daily had a $309.00 deficit
for the fall quarter.
Swift states that this was not
true—that the Daily now had
$5,200.00 credited to its account.
Hukari said he had realized his
mistake and would retract that
part of the article.
Much of the remainder of the
article still remains in question,
however.
The most controversial of the
accusations involves the Special
Events Board. The Arena charged
this organization with having
"dropped a bundle on last
Spring's Con Home concert with
Rav Charles. . ."
But Swift denies this. He notes
that there is still an account
receivable of $11,175.83 from a
debt owed Special Events by a
promoter of the concert, World
Wide Productions.
Collection on this debt is now
the responsibility of the
University counsel. But Swift
notes, "I don't know how there
can be a loss on an accounts
receivable. Until they (the
promoter) file for bankruptcy, if
they do, the debt is valid. I think
anyone with financial training
would agree to that."
Hukari responds, "I don't think
we are wrong on this. They are
saying that World Wide
Productions is going to take the
loss, but that is not clear. What we
have here is a problem of
interpretation."
Another area of disagreement
revolves around the checking
account of the Legal Defense
Committee, an organization
established expressly "to help in
providing legal assistance for
Stanford students."
Arena claims that the money in
this account is used to pay the
fees of A3M attorney James
Wolpman, though all of the
$6,000 of checks drawn on the
account have been made out to
Yale Braunstein.

But the core of the Arena
criticism of the committee is that:
"In violation of ASSU regulation,
the group does not have a
constitution on file with either
the ASSU or the Dean of
Students, nor does it have a
signature card on file with
Student Financial Manager's
office. . . Unlike other student
groups, the Legal Defense
Committee does not even have a
mail box in the ASSU office. . .It
is a matter of record that one of
the checks made out to him
(Wolpman) was authorized by the
signature of an individual who was
not even a registered student."
Swift answers that the new
ASSU Constitution does not
require a group have a
constitution on file; that the
signature card was there last year
and this year until it was stolen
three times in the last two weeks;
that Legal Defense does have a
mail box in the ASSU office,
though it is near the floor; and
that every authorization of funds
has been made by himself.
Still Hukari questions why the
Free Campus Movement was told
they needed a constitution on file
if this is not required now, and he
wonders about the mailbox since
he was told by an ASSU secretary
it not exist. In addition he still
maintains that he saw the
signature of non-student Leonard
Siegel listed on one of the checks.
Siegel was called a treasurer.
The only other major portion
of the story under question is a
passage reading, "It has been
charged by one former ASSU
employee that the Law
Association maintains an off
campus bank account which is
strictly prohibited by ASSU
regulations."
Swift cites Article V section 9
of the new Constitution as
contradicting this. That section
allows the Finance Manager to
make exceptions to the
organizations that that cannot
have private accounts. Swift says
this could have been done but
notes that it was not necessary in
this case since the Law
Association does not have such an
account. Hukari said he would
check into this.

IN THE ARENA—Student tinah-ial manager David Swift blasts the Arena in last
night's Student Senate meeting while Harvey llnkari and others listen and smile.
'Hie hi Mirations Board has been asked to review the status ot the paper.
In the wake of a blistering
attack on the Arena by Student
Financial Manager David Swift,
the Student Senate last night
angrily demanded that the
Publications Board review the
status of the newspaper.
If the Board decides that the
Arena is being published illegally,
it will not be allowed on campus.
The object of Swift's attack
was an article in yesterday's Arena
accusing him, and the ASSU in
general, of extremely irresponsible
financial practices.
As Harvey Hukari, of the
Arena, smiled disinterestedly,
Swift detailed the article's
accusations one by one and
countered each one with what he
called "the facts."

Hukari, when questioned after
the Senate meeting, disagreed
with Swift's explanations.
Swift also demanded that the
Arena print a front-page
retraction of its charges, on behalf
of the ASSU in general. "I want as
much attention given to this," he
said, "as to the original article."
Retraction Asked
He ended his speech by adding
that the Dean of Students also
intended to send a letter to the
Arena asking for a retraction.
As Swift sat down, the Senate
gave him an enthusiastic ovation.
Hukari later said that the Arena
would not print large-scale
retractions.
"We may be mistaken on some
small issues, and we will admit
that in the Arena," he said, "but

our figures are mainly correct and
we will stand by them."
"We just want to point out that
more people besides just Roger
Reed have been spending money
irresponsibly. If he's going to go
down, then some of the rest of
them should go too."
The Senate's action in
demanding that the Publications
Board review the status of the
Arena on campus was based on a
provision in the by-laws of the
Stanford constitution.
The Arena is not registered as a
student publication with the
Publications Board. This is
required by the by-laws if a
newspaper is to contain
advertising, which the Arena does.
Broken The Rules
On the other hand, if the Arena
is an official ASSU student
publication, Swift said that it has
broken almost every rule covering
publications in the by-laws. For
instance, it has not reported its
financial status.
After these points were brought
out by Swift, the Senate felt that
possible illegalities in the
publication of the Arena should
be subject to review by the
Publications Board. A motion
suggesting this, proposed by
Senator Peter Carpenter, was
enthusiastically passed by the
Senate.
Some Senators were for more
extreme measures. One, Senator
Frank Philpot, suggested the
possibility of a libel suit against
the Arena.
When asked if he will defend
the Arena to the Publications
Board, Hukari replied, "I'm going
to ask why they waited until
now."
"The Arena has been in
operation on this campus for two
years. No one has questioned the
legality of the paper before now.
Why now?"
Spending Practices
He went on to propose a
possible explanation.
"The Senate just got on us now
because we were exposing the
ASSU spending practices. They
wouldn't have said anything—they
wouldn't have attacked us—if we
hadn't attacked them"
One Senator, Doug McHenry,
expressed his opinion that the
Arena article was part of "a
planned conspiracy to attack the
ASSU."
"Each issue," he charged, "has
been aimed at one segment of the
ASSU — the Senate,
Financial Manager or whatever —to
reduce its credibility with the
students.
"I think the Arena did it just to
make a political point—and I
think it was time that Dave Swift
came forward to counter the
Arena."
Responding to McHenry's
accusation, Hukari later said, "If
this is a planned conspiracy by the
Arena to get at the ASSU, then he
and the other Senators should sign
a complicity statement. They have

done as much as anyone to
discredit the Senate."
Daily Budget
Hukari would only admit to
one mistake in the Arena article,
one concerning the budget of the
Daily. The article had stated that
the Daily had a $309.00 deficit
for the fall quarter.
Swift states that this was not
true—that the Daily now had
$5,200.00 credited to its account.
Hukari said he had realized his
mistake and would retract that
part of the article.
Much of the remainder of the
article still remains in question,
however.
The most controversial of the
accusations involves the Special
Events Board. The Arena charged
this organization with having
"dropped a bundle on last
Spring's Con Home concert with
Rav Charles. . ."
But Swift denies this. He notes
that there is still an account
receivable of $11,175.83 from a
debt owed Special Events by a
promoter of the concert, World
Wide Productions.
Collection on this debt is now
the responsibility of the
University counsel. But Swift
notes, "I don't know how there
can be a loss on an accounts
receivable. Until they (the
promoter) file for bankruptcy, if
they do, the debt is valid. I think
anyone with financial training
would agree to that."
Hukari responds, "I don't think
we are wrong on this. They are
saying that World Wide
Productions is going to take the
loss, but that is not clear. What we
have here is a problem of
interpretation."
Another area of disagreement
revolves around the checking
account of the Legal Defense
Committee, an organization
established expressly "to help in
providing legal assistance for
Stanford students."
Arena claims that the money in
this account is used to pay the
fees of A3M attorney James
Wolpman, though all of the
$6,000 of checks drawn on the
account have been made out to
Yale Braunstein.

But the core of the Arena
criticism of the committee is that:
"In violation of ASSU regulation,
the group does not have a
constitution on file with either
the ASSU or the Dean of
Students, nor does it have a
signature card on file with
Student Financial Manager's
office. . . Unlike other student
groups, the Legal Defense
Committee does not even have a
mail box in the ASSU office. . .It
is a matter of record that one of
the checks made out to him
(Wolpman) was authorized by the
signature of an individual who was
not even a registered student."
Swift answers that the new
ASSU Constitution does not
require a group have a
constitution on file; that the
signature card was there last year
and this year until it was stolen
three times in the last two weeks;
that Legal Defense does have a
mail box in the ASSU office,
though it is near the floor; and
that every authorization of funds
has been made by himself.
Still Hukari questions why the
Free Campus Movement was told
they needed a constitution on file
if this is not required now, and he
wonders about the mailbox since
he was told by an ASSU secretary
it not exist. In addition he still
maintains that he saw the
signature of non-student Leonard
Siegel listed on one of the checks.
Siegel was called a treasurer.
The only other major portion
of the story under question is a
passage reading, "It has been
charged by one former ASSU
employee that the Law
Association maintains an off
campus bank account which is
strictly prohibited by ASSU
regulations."
Swift cites Article V section 9

IN THE ARENA—Student tinah-ial manager David Swift blasts the Arena in last
night's Student Senate meeting while Harvey llnkari and others listen and smile.
'Hie hi Mirations Board has been asked to review the status ot the paper.
In the wake of a blistering
attack on the Arena by Student
Financial Manager David Swift,
the Student Senate last night
angrily demanded that the
Publications Board review the
status of the newspaper.
If the Board decides that the
Arena is being published illegally,
it will not be allowed on campus.
The object of Swift's attack
was an article in yesterday's Arena
accusing him, and the ASSU in
general, of extremely irresponsible
financial practices.
As Harvey Hukari, of the
Arena, smiled disinterestedly,
Swift detailed the article's
accusations one by one and
countered each one with what he
called "the facts."

Hukari, when questioned after
the Senate meeting, disagreed
with Swift's explanations.
Swift also demanded that the
Arena print a front-page
retraction of its charges, on behalf
of the ASSU in general. "I want as
much attention given to this," he
said, "as to the original article."
Retraction Asked
He ended his speech by adding
that the Dean of Students also
intended to send a letter to the
Arena asking for a retraction.
As Swift sat down, the Senate
gave him an enthusiastic ovation.
Hukari later said that the Arena
would not print large-scale
retractions.
"We may be mistaken on some
small issues, and we will admit
that in the Arena," he said, "but

our figures are mainly correct and
we will stand by them."
"We just want to point out that
more people besides just Roger
Reed have been spending money
irresponsibly. If he's going to go
down, then some of the rest of
them should go too."
The Senate's action in
demanding that the Publications
Board review the status of the
Arena on campus was based on a
provision in the by-laws of the
Stanford constitution.
The Arena is not registered as a
student publication with the
Publications Board. This is
required by the by-laws if a
newspaper is to contain
advertising, which the Arena does.
Broken The Rules
On the other hand, if the Arena
is an official ASSU student
publication, Swift said that it has
broken almost every rule covering
publications in the by-laws. For
instance, it has not reported its
financial status.
After these points were brought
out by Swift, the Senate felt that
possible illegalities in the
publication of the Arena should
be subject to review by the
Publications Board. A motion
suggesting this, proposed by
Senator Peter Carpenter, was
enthusiastically passed by the
Senate.
Some Senators were for more
extreme measures. One, Senator
Frank Philpot, suggested the
possibility of a libel suit against
the Arena.
When asked if he will defend
the Arena to the Publications
Board, Hukari replied, "I'm going
to ask why they waited until
now."
"The Arena has been in
operation on this campus for two
years. No one has questioned the
legality of the paper before now.
Why now?"
Spending Practices
He went on to propose a
possible explanation.
"The Senate just got on us now
because we were exposing the
ASSU spending practices. They
wouldn't have said anything—they
wouldn't have attacked us—if we
hadn't attacked them"
One Senator, Doug McHenry,
expressed his opinion that the
Arena article was part of "a
planned conspiracy to attack the
ASSU."
"Each issue," he charged, "has
been aimed at one segment of the
ASSU — the Senate,
Financial Manager or whatever —to
reduce its credibility with the
students.
"I think the Arena did it just to
make a political point—and I
think it was time that Dave Swift
came forward to counter the
Arena."
Responding to McHenry's
accusation, Hukari later said, "If
this is a planned conspiracy by the
Arena to get at the ASSU, then he
and the other Senators should sign
a complicity statement. They have

done as much as anyone to
discredit the Senate."
Daily Budget
Hukari would only admit to
one mistake in the Arena article,
one concerning the budget of the
Daily. The article had stated that
the Daily had a $309.00 deficit
for the fall quarter.
Swift states that this was not
true—that the Daily now had
$5,200.00 credited to its account.
Hukari said he had realized his
mistake and would retract that
part of the article.
Much of the remainder of the
article still remains in question,
however.
The most controversial of the
accusations involves the Special
Events Board. The Arena charged
this organization with having
"dropped a bundle on last
Spring's Con Home concert with
Rav Charles. . ."
But Swift denies this. He notes
that there is still an account
receivable of $11,175.83 from a
debt owed Special Events by a
promoter of the concert, World
Wide Productions.
Collection on this debt is now
the responsibility of the
University counsel. But Swift
notes, "I don't know how there
can be a loss on an accounts
receivable. Until they (the
promoter) file for bankruptcy, if
they do, the debt is valid. I think
anyone with financial training
would agree to that."
Hukari responds, "I don't think
we are wrong on this. They are
saying that World Wide
Productions is going to take the
loss, but that is not clear. What we
have here is a problem of
interpretation."
Another area of disagreement
revolves around the checking
account of the Legal Defense
Committee, an organization
established expressly "to help in
providing legal assistance for
Stanford students."
Arena claims that the money in
this account is used to pay the
fees of A3M attorney James
Wolpman, though all of the
$6,000 of checks drawn on the
account have been made out to
Yale Braunstein.

But the core of the Arena
criticism of the committee is that:
"In violation of ASSU regulation,
the group does not have a
constitution on file with either
the ASSU or the Dean of
Students, nor does it have a
signature card on file with
Student Financial Manager's
office. . . Unlike other student
groups, the Legal Defense
Committee does not even have a
mail box in the ASSU office. . .It
is a matter of record that one of
the checks made out to him
(Wolpman) was authorized by the
signature of an individual who was
not even a registered student."
Swift answers that the new
ASSU Constitution does not
require a group have a
constitution on file; that the
signature card was there last year
and this year until it was stolen
three times in the last two weeks;
that Legal Defense does have a
mail box in the ASSU office,
though it is near the floor; and
that every authorization of funds
has been made by himself.
Still Hukari questions why the
Free Campus Movement was told

criticism of the committee is that:
"In violation of ASSU regulation,
the group does not have a
constitution on file with either
the ASSU or the Dean of
Students, nor does it have a
signature card on file with
Student Financial Manager's
office. . . Unlike other student
groups, the Legal Defense
Committee does not even have a
mail box in the ASSU office. . .It
is a matter of record that one of
the checks made out to him
(Wolpman) was authorized by the
signature of an individual who was
not even a registered student."
Swift answers that the new
ASSU Constitution does not
require a group have a
constitution on file; that the
signature card was there last year
and this year until it was stolen
three times in the last two weeks;
that Legal Defense does have a
mail box in the ASSU office,
though it is near the floor; and
that every authorization of funds
has been made by himself.
Still Hukari questions why the
Free Campus Movement was told
they needed a constitution on file
if this is not required now, and he
wonders about the mailbox since
he was told by an ASSU secretary
it not exist. In addition he still
maintains that he saw the
signature of non-student Leonard
Siegel listed on one of the checks.
Siegel was called a treasurer.
The only other major portion
of the story under question is a
passage reading, "It has been
charged by one former ASSU
employee that the Law
Association maintains an off
campus bank account which is
strictly prohibited by ASSU
regulations."
Swift cites Article V section 9
of the new Constitution as
contradicting this. That section
allows the Finance Manager to
make exceptions to the
organizations that that cannot
have private accounts. Swift says
this could have been done but
notes that it was not necessary in
this case since the Law
Association does not have such an
account. Hukari said he would
check into this.


IN THE ARENA—Student tinah-ial manager David Swift blasts the Arena in last
night's Student Senate meeting while Harvey llnkari and others listen and smile.
'Hie hi Mirations Board has been asked to review the status ot the paper.
In the wake of a blistering
attack on the Arena by Student
Financial Manager David Swift,
the Student Senate last night
angrily demanded that the
Publications Board review the
status of the newspaper.
If the Board decides that the
Arena is being published illegally,
it will not be allowed on campus.
The object of Swift's attack
was an article in yesterday's Arena
accusing him, and the ASSU in
general, of extremely irresponsible
financial practices.
As Harvey Hukari, of the
Arena, smiled disinterestedly,
Swift detailed the article's
accusations one by one and
countered each one with what he
called "the facts."

Hukari, when questioned after
the Senate meeting, disagreed
with Swift's explanations.
Swift also demanded that the
Arena print a front-page
retraction of its charges, on behalf
of the ASSU in general. "I want as
much attention given to this," he
said, "as to the original article."
Retraction Asked
He ended his speech by adding
that the Dean of Students also
intended to send a letter to the
Arena asking for a retraction.
As Swift sat down, the Senate
gave him an enthusiastic ovation.
Hukari later said that the Arena
would not print large-scale
retractions.
"We may be mistaken on some
small issues, and we will admit
that in the Arena," he said, "but

our figures are mainly correct and
we will stand by them."
"We just want to point out that
more people besides just Roger
Reed have been spending money
irresponsibly. If he's going to go
down, then some of the rest of
them should go too."
The Senate's action in
demanding that the Publications
Board review the status of the
Arena on campus was based on a
provision in the by-laws of the
Stanford constitution.
The Arena is not registered as a
student publication with the
Publications Board. This is
required by the by-laws if a
newspaper is to contain
advertising, which the Arena does.
Broken The Rules
On the other hand, if the Arena
is an official ASSU student
publication, Swift said that it has
broken almost every rule covering
publications in the by-laws. For
instance, it has not reported its
financial status.
After these points were brought
out by Swift, the Senate felt that
possible illegalities in the
publication of the Arena should
be subject to review by the
Publications Board. A motion
suggesting this, proposed by
Senator Peter Carpenter, was
enthusiastically passed by the
Senate.
Some Senators were for more
extreme measures. One, Senator
Frank Philpot, suggested the
possibility of a libel suit against
the Arena.
When asked if he will defend
the Arena to the Publications
Board, Hukari replied, "I'm going
to ask why they waited until
now."
"The Arena has been in
operation on this campus for two
years. No one has questioned the
legality of the paper before now.
Why now?"
Spending Practices
He went on to propose a
possible explanation.
"The Senate just got on us now
because we were exposing the
ASSU spending practices. They
wouldn't have said anything—they
wouldn't have attacked us—if we
hadn't attacked them"
One Senator, Doug McHenry,
expressed his opinion that the
Arena article was part of "a
planned conspiracy to attack the
ASSU."
"Each issue," he charged, "has
been aimed at one segment of the
ASSU — the Senate,
Financial Manager or whatever —to
reduce its credibility with the
students.
"I think the Arena did it just to
make a political point—and I
think it was time that Dave Swift
came forward to counter the
Arena."
Responding to McHenry's
accusation, Hukari later said, "If
this is a planned conspiracy by the
Arena to get at the ASSU, then he
and the other Senators should sign
a complicity statement. They have

done as much as anyone to
discredit the Senate."
Daily Budget
Hukari would only admit to
one mistake in the Arena article,
one concerning the budget of the
Daily. The article had stated that
the Daily had a $309.00 deficit
for the fall quarter.
Swift states that this was not
true—that the Daily now had
$5,200.00 credited to its account.
Hukari said he had realized his
mistake and would retract that
part of the article.
Much of the remainder of the
article still remains in question,
however.
The most controversial of the
accusations involves the Special
Events Board. The Arena charged
this organization with having
"dropped a bundle on last
Spring's Con Home concert with
Rav Charles. . ."
But Swift denies this. He notes
that there is still an account
receivable of $11,175.83 from a
debt owed Special Events by a
promoter of the concert, World
Wide Productions.
Collection on this debt is now
the responsibility of the
University counsel. But Swift
notes, "I don't know how there
can be a loss on an accounts
receivable. Until they (the
promoter) file for bankruptcy, if
they do, the debt is valid. I think
anyone with financial training
would agree to that."
Hukari responds, "I don't think
we are wrong on this. They are
saying that World Wide
Productions is going to take the
loss, but that is not clear. What we
have here is a problem of
interpretation."
Another area of disagreement
revolves around the checking
account of the Legal Defense
Committee, an organization
established expressly "to help in
providing legal assistance for
Stanford students."
Arena claims that the money in
this account is used to pay the
fees of A3M attorney James
Wolpman, though all of the
$6,000 of checks drawn on the
account have been made out to
Yale Braunstein.

But the core of the Arena
criticism of the committee is that:
"In violation of ASSU regulation,
the group does not have a
constitution on file with either
the ASSU or the Dean of
Students, nor does it have a
signature card on file with
Student Financial Manager's
office. . . Unlike other student
