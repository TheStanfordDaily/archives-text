Association Issue)
A forum was held on the 20th
of January in the TMU to discuss
the events which occurred at the
African Studies Conference in
Montreal during the fall of 1969.
It was supposed to be an
informative meeting with a panel
of four representing different
viewpoints but unfortunately
there was no question and answer
period. This leads to speculation
as to what the speakers sometimes
meant.
A brief summary of the history
of the ASA will help throw some
light on the events at Montreal.
The African Studies Association
was founded at a meeting in New
York in March 1957 by a group of
Africanists, mostly white, "to
organize an Association in the
scholarly field to be devoted to

the study of Africa." The
Association was to facilitate
communication among' scholars
interested in the continent; to
collect and disseminate
information on Africa useful to its
members; and to stimulate
research.
The founding members were
exclusively from the academic
community and included well
known individuals, among them
Gray Cowan of Columbia,
Gwendolen Carter, then at Smith
College but now at Northwestern,
Kenneth Galbraith, W.O. Jones,
Joseph Greenberg and St. Claire
Drake of Stanford, the last then a
professor at Roosevelt University.
Membership was to be at three
levels: full membership with
voting rights to people who had
published on or were teaching
about Africa, Associated Fellows
and lastly student members, the
last two groups with no voting
rights but entitled to receive the

Association's publications. Annual
meetings were held at which
papers on research were read, and
the Association published,
beginning in 1958, a bulletin and
newsletter.
ASA Unaltered
The ASA remained unaltered
until 1968. At the annual meeting
in Los Angeles that year blacks
expressed dissatisfaction both with
the organizational setup and the
relevance of the papers being read
and the result was a formation of
two groups, the Black Caucus and
the African Heritage Studies
Association. They made known
their demands and Professor
Gibbs among others was
appointed to look into the issues.
At the 1969 annual meeting in
Montreal the two groups forced
confrontations by presenting
demands, and when these were
ignored, by disrupting speeches of
the invited guests and business
board meeting.
From what was said at the
forum discussion, differences with
the ASA are along two fronts -
institutional racism, in the sense
that though racism is not
explicitly incorporated in the
intentions of the organization and
it in fact disclaims being biased, it
is however racist in essence; and
secondly with regard to the issue
of relevance in research and
publications.
To overcome the institutional
racism the Black Caucus
demanded equal representation by
race on the policy board, with the
black members voting for the six
black representatives and also
having a say in the election of the
white members. They also
demanded a change in
membership rules to allow anyone
interested in Africa to join, with
voting rights. To make research
towards prescriptive work they
demanded a re-organization of
priorities with the centralization
of decision making, a clear stand
on pressing political problems
such as racism in the U.S. and
southern Africa, a switch from the
laissez faire method of decision
making that has been in effect.
A lIS A
The Black Caucus then was
formed as a body directly
concerned with the ASA. The
African Heritage Studies
Association, a distinct body
outside the ASA, is open to
scholars with an interest in the
study of Africa as it pertains to
American blacks of African
descent. The Association intends
to take over the orientation of
African students coming to the
U.S. and Afro-Americans going to

Africa; encourage blacks to study
African life; and publish its own
journal and newsletter.
The confrontation at Montreal
resulted in a committee of thirty
appointed to study the
restructuring of the ASA in view
of the demands. But the general
feeling seems to be that the
Association as a place where an
"exchange of ideas in a scholarly
fashion could occur" was finished.
Equal representation along racial
lines implies formally politicizing
the Association. One wonders
what alternative to that demand
is. The ASA has been a white
enclave, whether by design or by
circumstance, and as in every
other association or institute of
learning drastic measures have to
be taken to correct the imbalance.
Racial Clause
Incorporation of a racial clause
in the constitution seems
unpalatable, but much more so is
the tacit racism that has existed to
date. The demand is a recognition
of the times we are living in, an
awareness that individual exercise
of responsibility results in no
responsibility. Where racial bias is
a factor, a collective responsibility
is necessary if objectivity is to be
maintained.

From what was said at the
forum discussion, differences with
the ASA are along two fronts -
institutional racism, in the sense
that though racism is not
explicitly incorporated in the
intentions of the organization and
it in fact disclaims being biased, it
is however racist in essence; and
secondly with regard to the issue
of relevance in research and
publications.
To overcome the institutional
racism the Black Caucus
demanded equal representation by
race on the policy board, with the
black members voting for the six
black representatives and also
having a say in the election of the
white members. They also
demanded a change in
membership rules to allow anyone
interested in Africa to join, with
voting rights. To make research
towards prescriptive work they
demanded a re-organization of
priorities with the centralization
of decision making, a clear stand
on pressing political problems
such as racism in the U.S. and
southern Africa, a switch from the
laissez faire method of decision
making that has been in effect.

The Black Caucus then was
formed as a body directly
concerned with the ASA. The
African Heritage Studies
Association, a distinct body
outside the ASA, is open to
scholars with an interest in the
study of Africa as it pertains to
American blacks of African
descent. The Association intends
to take over the orientation of
African students coming to the
U.S. and Afro-Americans going to

Africa; encourage blacks to study
African life; and publish its own
journal and newsletter.
The confrontation at Montreal
resulted in a committee of thirty
appointed to study the
restructuring of the ASA in view
of the demands. But the general
feeling seems to be that the
Association as a place where an
"exchange of ideas in a scholarly
fashion could occur" was finished.
Equal representation along racial
lines implies formally politicizing
the Association. One wonders
what alternative to that demand
is. The ASA has been a white
enclave, whether by design or by
circumstance, and as in every
other association or institute of
learning drastic measures have to
be taken to correct the imbalance.
Racial Clause
Incorporation of a racial clause
in the constitution seems
unpalatable, but much more so is
the tacit racism that has existed to
date. The demand is a recognition
of the times we are living in, an
awareness that individual exercise
of responsibility results in no
responsibility. Where racial bias is
a factor, a collective responsibility
is necessary if objectivity is to be
maintained.

A forum was held on the 20th
of January in the TMU to discuss
the events which occurred at the
African Studies Conference in
Montreal during the fall of 1969.
It was supposed to be an
informative meeting with a panel
of four representing different
viewpoints but unfortunately
there was no question and answer
period. This leads to speculation
as to what the speakers sometimes
meant.
A brief summary of the history
of the ASA will help throw some
light on the events at Montreal.
The African Studies Association
was founded at a meeting in New
York in March 1957 by a group of
Africanists, mostly white, "to
organize an Association in the
scholarly field to be devoted to

the study of Africa." The
Association was to facilitate
communication among' scholars
interested in the continent; to
collect and disseminate
information on Africa useful to its
members; and to stimulate
research.
The founding members were
exclusively from the academic
community and included well
known individuals, among them
Gray Cowan of Columbia,
Gwendolen Carter, then at Smith
College but now at Northwestern,
Kenneth Galbraith, W.O. Jones,
Joseph Greenberg and St. Claire
Drake of Stanford, the last then a
professor at Roosevelt University.
Membership was to be at three
levels: full membership with
voting rights to people who had
published on or were teaching
about Africa, Associated Fellows
and lastly student members, the
last two groups with no voting
rights but entitled to receive the

Association's publications. Annual
meetings were held at which
papers on research were read, and
the Association published,
beginning in 1958, a bulletin and
newsletter.
ASA Unaltered
The ASA remained unaltered
until 1968. At the annual meeting
in Los Angeles that year blacks
expressed dissatisfaction both with
the organizational setup and the
relevance of the papers being read
and the result was a formation of
two groups, the Black Caucus and
the African Heritage Studies
Association. They made known
their demands and Professor
Gibbs among others was
appointed to look into the issues.
At the 1969 annual meeting in
Montreal the two groups forced
confrontations by presenting
demands, and when these were
ignored, by disrupting speeches of
the invited guests and business
board meeting.

Association Issue)
A forum was held on the 20th
of January in the TMU to discuss
the events which occurred at the
African Studies Conference in
Montreal during the fall of 1969.
It was supposed to be an
informative meeting with a panel
of four representing different
viewpoints but unfortunately
there was no question and answer
period. This leads to speculation
as to what the speakers sometimes
meant.
A brief summary of the history
of the ASA will help throw some
light on the events at Montreal.
The African Studies Association
was founded at a meeting in New
York in March 1957 by a group of
Africanists, mostly white, "to
organize an Association in the
scholarly field to be devoted to

the study of Africa." The
Association was to facilitate
communication among' scholars
interested in the continent; to
collect and disseminate
information on Africa useful to its
members; and to stimulate
research.
The founding members were
exclusively from the academic
community and included well
known individuals, among them
Gray Cowan of Columbia,
Gwendolen Carter, then at Smith
College but now at Northwestern,
Kenneth Galbraith, W.O. Jones,
Joseph Greenberg and St. Claire
Drake of Stanford, the last then a
professor at Roosevelt University.
Membership was to be at three
levels: full membership with
voting rights to people who had
published on or were teaching
about Africa, Associated Fellows
and lastly student members, the
last two groups with no voting
rights but entitled to receive the

Association's publications. Annual
meetings were held at which
papers on research were read, and
the Association published,
beginning in 1958, a bulletin and
newsletter.
ASA Unaltered
The ASA remained unaltered
until 1968. At the annual meeting
in Los Angeles that year blacks
expressed dissatisfaction both with
the organizational setup and the
relevance of the papers being read
and the result was a formation of
two groups, the Black Caucus and
the African Heritage Studies
Association. They made known
their demands and Professor
Gibbs among others was
appointed to look into the issues.
At the 1969 annual meeting in
Montreal the two groups forced
confrontations by presenting
demands, and when these were
ignored, by disrupting speeches of
the invited guests and business
board meeting.
From what was said at the
forum discussion, differences with
the ASA are along two fronts -
institutional racism, in the sense
that though racism is not
explicitly incorporated in the
intentions of the organization and
it in fact disclaims being biased, it
is however racist in essence; and
secondly with regard to the issue
of relevance in research and
publications.
To overcome the institutional
racism the Black Caucus
demanded equal representation by
race on the policy board, with the
black members voting for the six
black representatives and also
having a say in the election of the
white members. They also
demanded a change in
membership rules to allow anyone
interested in Africa to join, with
voting rights. To make research
towards prescriptive work they
demanded a re-organization of
priorities with the centralization
of decision making, a clear stand
on pressing political problems
such as racism in the U.S. and
southern Africa, a switch from the
laissez faire method of decision
making that has been in effect.
A lIS A
The Black Caucus then was
formed as a body directly
concerned with the ASA. The
African Heritage Studies
Association, a distinct body
outside the ASA, is open to
scholars with an interest in the
study of Africa as it pertains to
American blacks of African
descent. The Association intends
to take over the orientation of
African students coming to the
U.S. and Afro-Americans going to

Africa; encourage blacks to study
African life; and publish its own
journal and newsletter.
The confrontation at Montreal
resulted in a committee of thirty
appointed to study the
restructuring of the ASA in view
of the demands. But the general
feeling seems to be that the
Association as a place where an
"exchange of ideas in a scholarly
fashion could occur" was finished.
Equal representation along racial
lines implies formally politicizing
the Association. One wonders
what alternative to that demand
is. The ASA has been a white
enclave, whether by design or by
circumstance, and as in every
other association or institute of
learning drastic measures have to
be taken to correct the imbalance.
Racial Clause
Incorporation of a racial clause
in the constitution seems
unpalatable, but much more so is
the tacit racism that has existed to
date. The demand is a recognition
of the times we are living in, an
awareness that individual exercise
of responsibility results in no
responsibility. Where racial bias is
a factor, a collective responsibility
is necessary if objectivity is to be
maintained.
