Return of the DOLLY
Lditor, THE DAILY:
Friday night I, a recent junior
transfer student, went to the
all-school dance held at Lathrop
House. As usual, girls were
outnumbered, yet even more so
on this occasion—at least 4:1.
I empathize with those guys.
All they could do was drink beer
and talk with the other guys. Only
the "hustlers, studs, and "
get the girls, who, incidently, were
not left standing by 10:30 p.m.
So for 75c they had all the beer
they wanted, yet what they came
for-to meet someone-a dream girl,
i.e., a Raquel, never came about.
Why?
Why? Because the girls-foolish,
fearful, and stuck up-sat home
that night feeling sorry for
themselves, wondering why they
had not been asked out.
I write not in protest to those
boys-I empathize with them. I
write to protest those girls who
have no guts to leave their ivory
tower, pay (for once!)—7sc, and
go to a paity. What have they got
to lose? At least they have tried.
And if, in a room of over 100
undergraduate guys, there is none
who suits their "type," they don't
belong here at Stanford. And I'll
bet the boys wouldn't give a damn
about them if they came or not.
The following is a pensive
quotation once given to me:
"Every year / live I am more
convinced that the waste of
life lies in the love we have not
given, the powers we have not
used, the selfish prudence that
will risk nothing, and which,
shirking pain, misses
as well. No one yet was evei
the poorer in the long run for
having once in a lifetime "let
out all the length of all the
reins."
Course Evaluation
Editor, THE DAILY:
Here are some corrections to
your "course evaluation" article
which appeared in Tuesday's
paper, listed in descending order
of seriousness:
1. I think that evaluation of
teaching will probably "not
radically change the basis for
financial promotion" or any other
type of promotion.
2. The program is purely
voluntary.
3. Developing the questionnaire
is the committees purpose, not
mine personally, though, of
course, I am participating enthus
iastically.
4. Finally, my name is spelled
as undersigned.

Rebuttal to Scheimer
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Jim Scheimer's
article on orientation for students
going to an Overseas Campus, I
would like to correct several
inaccuracies.
1) The article was entitled
''Overseas Proposal," but
contained no proposal evident to
me.
2) It strikes me that Econ 1.
Music 1, or Art 1 can scarcely be
considered specialized courses.
3) The assertion that
"unfortunately the courses
available do not provide
'familiarization with the
culture . . .' remains unsupported.
First, I doubt that Mr. Scheimer
can make such a judgement since
he has not taken any of them.
Second, it is folly to claim that
one course can do so. Through
taking a course the student has an
opportunity to become familiar
with one aspect of a European

culture which we hope he will
follow up while overseas.
Becoming familiar with the
culture requires that the student
put forth a major effort on his
own—which we hope he will do.
4) The paradigm of a science
major's having to take a
high-numbered art course without
being interested in it simply does
not follow. Each student
preparing to go overseas has a
minimum choice of sixty-six
courses from ten departments
from which he need take only
one. If he takes a high-numbered
art course which he does not like,
the fault is his.
The two major inaccuracies are
Mr. Scheimer's drawing final
conclusions about a program
which has barely been operating
and his neglect to mention the
correct source of the new
program. He writes, "for most
students who have not yet gone
overseas, (the courses) seem to be
a nuisance of no great tangible
value. For those who have already
gone overseas, the courses appear
to be useful and enjoyable to
most but too specific in scope."
No student has yet departed for
an overseas campus since the new
program was fully into effect. Mr.
Scheimer himself is one of a grand
total of three students who have
done the optional readings and
taken an examination on them.
Thus I believe that making a
judgement now about the value of
a program this new is as decisive
as writing a critique on a
symphony after listening to the

first five minutes of it. After the
results have been evaluated (which
requires that some groups return
from overseas), I am perfectly
prepared to agree that the
program may not work—but
certainly not until then.
The Overseas Campuses Office
has been aware for years that an
orientation program of substance
was needed. That is why, in the
past five years, we have tried three
different methods of orientation.
The reason we advocated a new
one is because they did not work.
The present program was
conceived in almost an entire
quarter's deliberation by a
faculty-student committee, all
nine members of which (except

one faculty member) had been
overeas. Thus, while we support
the new program with all vigor,
the goals were set forth by a
considerably larger number of
informed and concerned people
than just the "overseas campuses
director." In conclusion I suggest
that by making an intelligent
choice of courses from the many
available, and by selecting a topic
which he would like to pursue at
the Overseas Campus, the student
going overseas can prepare himself
much more adequately for his
stay. As in all other academic
pursuits, initiative and interest on
the students' part are necessary.
