# 'Willie Boy' Honest But Facile
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
"Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here"
has been treated with a great deal
of respect and even caution by the
national press. The first reason for
this, it seems, is the mysterious
reputation of writer/director
Abraham Polonsky, long on
Hollywood's blacklist. The second
reason is the film's conspicuously
timely subject matter the
emasculation of the Indian race in
the American West as a result of
white racism-which is meant to
hold double significance for us
today as an allegory of this
country's treatment of the black
people.
Despite his noble intent,
Polonsky has not been entirely
successful in combining and
meaningfully relating his
interesting ideas to each other.
The natures of the minds of both
the white men and the Indians are
indicated but never really
explored, just as the inherent
folklore in both cultures is
presented but never integrated
into the story. Ultimately, the
film emerges as more complicated
than complex, more wind-up than
delivery.
Lacks Tension
On the most basic but
therefore most important level,
Willie Boy lacks narrative tension
and a sense of immediacy about
the fates and actions of the
characters. It is never clear what
the fugitive Indian Willie Boy
(Robert Blake) or the
posse-leading sheriff (Robert
Redford) really want, either for
themselves or from each other.
The two men actually meet only
twice and because of their
underdeveloped relationship, their
final confrontation is
non-dramatic almost to the point r
of being a non-occurance. «
Of course, it could be posited s
that the strength of this t
confrontation rests more with its <
cosmic implications, such as the <
conflict between good and evil, <
the fateful meeting of an ominous
oppressive force and a free spirit s
or the more relevant suggestion I
that there is a vast difference 1
between law and justice. <
Unfortunately, such intellectual 1
and abstract ideas cannot i
effectively serve as substantial i
dramatic devices. Therefore, the
film's ending seems somewhat

muted, since the philosophical
and/or symbolic content of a
situation cannot be rendered with
the utmost forcefulness unless the
dramatic potential of the situation
on which it depends is fully
exploited.
Not only does the film lack
sufficient surface excitement, but
the concept of racism is presented
with a rather familiar naivete,
even if Polonsky's attitudes are
highly commendable. The
director's approach to the subject
is compelling to the extent that
we can sense the oppression Willie
Bov feels as a man living now who

has had nothing to say about
history or the race into which he
was born and who cannot feel
responsible for the prejudices
which have developed over many
years.
Strained Credibility
Beyond this, however, racism is
suggested mainly through whites
spouting slanderous and degrading
one-liners which, in meaning, boil
dow to "Keep those goddamn
Indians on their goddamn
reservations." This, in addition to
lines such as, "You'll never catch
Willie—he's like a cloud," tends to

strain the entire picture's
credibility, as does an elaborate
but unresolved side plot
concerning the imminent arrival
of President Taft and the local
government's precautions to limit
the possibility of political
assassination.
However awkwardly these
representational concepts are
introduced, they are at least
presented within the context of
the story. Fortunately, Polonsky
never indulges in heavy-handed
speech making or moralistic
lecturing, practices which
inevitably sacrifice form, pace and
style for blatant content. Indeed,
the story is kept going at a
reasonably quick speed.
Polonsky is aided as well by an
unusually competent and
attractive cast. As in his other
recent pictures, no strenuous
histrionic demands are made of
Robert Redford and, as in his
other pictures, he is quietly
effective and always interesting to
watch. Katherine Ross is at the
mercy of Indian makeup and a
part which is underdeveloped to
begin with, but she has a natural
honesty as an actress and her
undeniable beauty which work to
her ultimate advantage, here as
elsewhere. And Susan Clark
maintains admirable control over
a part which could have become
obnoxious if not laughable in
lesser hands.
As evidenced in "In Cold
Blood," Robert Blake is an
extremely capable actor but he
brings a grimness to the already
downbeat character of Willie Boy
which is almost depressing.
Blake's strong but oppresively
serious portrayal epitomizes the
respectable but overly humorless
stance of the entire picture.
Director's Career
Abraham Polonsky can
actually be considered as having
launched upon a new career in
1969 and for a first picture, Willie
Boy is not at all bad. Actually,
Polonsky directed another film in
1948, "Force of Evil," which I
have not seen but which is
considered a minor American
classic in intellectual film circles.
He also scripted another of the
period's classic films, "Body and
Soul." However, Polonsky,
self-admittedly a "Democrat,
Anarchist, Radical and
Confused," was among the first
casualties of the anti-communist
hysteria of the fifties. Over the
years he remained minimally
employed writing under
pseudonyms and not until 1968
did he again see himself credited
for his own work (for the script of
Don Siegel's "Madigan").
Though his underground
reputation may be in excess of his
actual capabilities, Polonsky's
current film reveals an intelligence
and awareness superior to most of
the powers currently at large in
Hollywood. Hopefully, Polonsky
will be given the opportunity to
prove himself, one way or the
other.
"Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here"
is currently playing at the

which have developed over many
years.
Strained Credibility
Beyond this, however, racism is
suggested mainly through whites
spouting slanderous and degrading
one-liners which, in meaning, boil
dow to "Keep those goddamn
Indians on their goddamn
reservations." This, in addition to
lines such as, "You'll never catch
Willie—he's like a cloud," tends to

strain the entire picture's
credibility, as does an elaborate
but unresolved side plot
concerning the imminent arrival
of President Taft and the local
government's precautions to limit
the possibility of political
assassination.
However awkwardly these
representational concepts are
introduced, they are at least
presented within the context of
the story. Fortunately, Polonsky
never indulges in heavy-handed
speech making or moralistic
lecturing, practices which
inevitably sacrifice form, pace and
style for blatant content. Indeed,
the story is kept going at a
reasonably quick speed.
Polonsky is aided as well by an
unusually competent and
attractive cast. As in his other
recent pictures, no strenuous
histrionic demands are made of
Robert Redford and, as in his
other pictures, he is quietly
effective and always interesting to
watch. Katherine Ross is at the
mercy of Indian makeup and a
part which is underdeveloped to
begin with, but she has a natural
honesty as an actress and her
undeniable beauty which work to
her ultimate advantage, here as
elsewhere. And Susan Clark
maintains admirable control over
a part which could have become
obnoxious if not laughable in
lesser hands.
As evidenced in "In Cold
Blood," Robert Blake is an
extremely capable actor but he
brings a grimness to the already
downbeat character of Willie Boy
which is almost depressing.
Blake's strong but oppresively
serious portrayal epitomizes the
respectable but overly humorless
stance of the entire picture.
Director's Career
Abraham Polonsky can
actually be considered as having
launched upon a new career in
1969 and for a first picture, Willie
Boy is not at all bad. Actually,
Polonsky directed another film in
1948, "Force of Evil," which I
have not seen but which is
considered a minor American
classic in intellectual film circles.
He also scripted another of the
period's classic films, "Body and
Soul." However, Polonsky,
self-admittedly a "Democrat,
Anarchist, Radical and
Confused," was among the first
casualties of the anti-communist
hysteria of the fifties. Over the
years he remained minimally
employed writing under
pseudonyms and not until 1968
did he again see himself credited
for his own work (for the script of
Don Siegel's "Madigan").
Though his underground
reputation may be in excess of his
actual capabilities, Polonsky's
current film reveals an intelligence
and awareness superior to most of
the powers currently at large in
Hollywood. Hopefully, Polonsky
will be given the opportunity to
prove himself, one way or the
other.
"Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here"
is currently playing at the
Regency II in San Francisco.


ROBERT REDFORD AND SUSAN CLARK
"Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here"
has been treated with a great deal
of respect and even caution by the
national press. The first reason for
this, it seems, is the mysterious
reputation of writer/director
Abraham Polonsky, long on
Hollywood's blacklist. The second
reason is the film's conspicuously
timely subject matter the
emasculation of the Indian race in
the American West as a result of
white racism-which is meant to
hold double significance for us
today as an allegory of this
country's treatment of the black
people.
Despite his noble intent,
Polonsky has not been entirely
successful in combining and
meaningfully relating his
interesting ideas to each other.
The natures of the minds of both
the white men and the Indians are
indicated but never really
explored, just as the inherent
folklore in both cultures is
presented but never integrated
into the story. Ultimately, the
film emerges as more complicated
than complex, more wind-up than
delivery.
Lacks Tension
On the most basic but
therefore most important level,
Willie Boy lacks narrative tension
and a sense of immediacy about
the fates and actions of the
characters. It is never clear what
the fugitive Indian Willie Boy
(Robert Blake) or the
posse-leading sheriff (Robert
Redford) really want, either for
themselves or from each other.
The two men actually meet only
twice and because of their
underdeveloped relationship, their
final confrontation is
non-dramatic almost to the point r
of being a non-occurance. «
Of course, it could be posited s
that the strength of this t
confrontation rests more with its <
cosmic implications, such as the <
conflict between good and evil, <
the fateful meeting of an ominous
oppressive force and a free spirit s
or the more relevant suggestion I
that there is a vast difference 1
between law and justice. <
Unfortunately, such intellectual 1
and abstract ideas cannot i
effectively serve as substantial i
dramatic devices. Therefore, the
film's ending seems somewhat

muted, since the philosophical
and/or symbolic content of a
situation cannot be rendered with
the utmost forcefulness unless the
dramatic potential of the situation
on which it depends is fully
exploited.
Not only does the film lack
sufficient surface excitement, but
the concept of racism is presented
with a rather familiar naivete,
even if Polonsky's attitudes are
highly commendable. The
director's approach to the subject
is compelling to the extent that
we can sense the oppression Willie
Bov feels as a man living now who

has had nothing to say about
history or the race into which he
was born and who cannot feel
responsible for the prejudices
which have developed over many
years.

ROBERT REDFORD AND SUSAN CLARK
"Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here"
has been treated with a great deal
of respect and even caution by the
national press. The first reason for
this, it seems, is the mysterious
reputation of writer/director
Abraham Polonsky, long on
Hollywood's blacklist. The second
reason is the film's conspicuously
timely subject matter the
emasculation of the Indian race in
the American West as a result of
white racism-which is meant to
hold double significance for us
today as an allegory of this
country's treatment of the black
people.
Despite his noble intent,
Polonsky has not been entirely
successful in combining and
meaningfully relating his
interesting ideas to each other.
The natures of the minds of both
the white men and the Indians are
indicated but never really
explored, just as the inherent
folklore in both cultures is
presented but never integrated
into the story. Ultimately, the
film emerges as more complicated
than complex, more wind-up than
delivery.
Lacks Tension
On the most basic but
therefore most important level,
Willie Boy lacks narrative tension
and a sense of immediacy about
the fates and actions of the
characters. It is never clear what
the fugitive Indian Willie Boy
(Robert Blake) or the
posse-leading sheriff (Robert
Redford) really want, either for
themselves or from each other.
The two men actually meet only
twice and because of their
underdeveloped relationship, their
final confrontation is
non-dramatic almost to the point r
of being a non-occurance. «
Of course, it could be posited s
that the strength of this t
confrontation rests more with its <
cosmic implications, such as the <
conflict between good and evil, <
the fateful meeting of an ominous
oppressive force and a free spirit s
or the more relevant suggestion I
that there is a vast difference 1
between law and justice. <
Unfortunately, such intellectual 1
and abstract ideas cannot i
effectively serve as substantial i
dramatic devices. Therefore, the
film's ending seems somewhat

muted, since the philosophical
and/or symbolic content of a
situation cannot be rendered with
the utmost forcefulness unless the
dramatic potential of the situation
on which it depends is fully
exploited.
Not only does the film lack
sufficient surface excitement, but
the concept of racism is presented
with a rather familiar naivete,
even if Polonsky's attitudes are
highly commendable. The
director's approach to the subject
is compelling to the extent that
we can sense the oppression Willie
Bov feels as a man living now who

has had nothing to say about
history or the race into which he
was born and who cannot feel
responsible for the prejudices
which have developed over many
years.
Strained Credibility
Beyond this, however, racism is
suggested mainly through whites
spouting slanderous and degrading
one-liners which, in meaning, boil
dow to "Keep those goddamn
Indians on their goddamn
reservations." This, in addition to
lines such as, "You'll never catch
Willie—he's like a cloud," tends to

strain the entire picture's
credibility, as does an elaborate
but unresolved side plot
concerning the imminent arrival
of President Taft and the local
government's precautions to limit
the possibility of political
assassination.
However awkwardly these
representational concepts are
introduced, they are at least
presented within the context of
the story. Fortunately, Polonsky
never indulges in heavy-handed
speech making or moralistic
lecturing, practices which
inevitably sacrifice form, pace and
style for blatant content. Indeed,
the story is kept going at a
reasonably quick speed.
Polonsky is aided as well by an
unusually competent and
attractive cast. As in his other
recent pictures, no strenuous
histrionic demands are made of
Robert Redford and, as in his
other pictures, he is quietly
effective and always interesting to
watch. Katherine Ross is at the
mercy of Indian makeup and a
part which is underdeveloped to
begin with, but she has a natural
honesty as an actress and her
undeniable beauty which work to
her ultimate advantage, here as
elsewhere. And Susan Clark
maintains admirable control over
a part which could have become
obnoxious if not laughable in
lesser hands.
As evidenced in "In Cold
Blood," Robert Blake is an
extremely capable actor but he
brings a grimness to the already
downbeat character of Willie Boy
which is almost depressing.
Blake's strong but oppresively
serious portrayal epitomizes the
respectable but overly humorless
stance of the entire picture.
Director's Career
Abraham Polonsky can
actually be considered as having
launched upon a new career in
1969 and for a first picture, Willie
Boy is not at all bad. Actually,
Polonsky directed another film in
1948, "Force of Evil," which I
have not seen but which is
considered a minor American
classic in intellectual film circles.
He also scripted another of the
period's classic films, "Body and
Soul." However, Polonsky,
self-admittedly a "Democrat,
Anarchist, Radical and
Confused," was among the first
casualties of the anti-communist
hysteria of the fifties. Over the
years he remained minimally
employed writing under
pseudonyms and not until 1968
did he again see himself credited
for his own work (for the script of
Don Siegel's "Madigan").
Though his underground
reputation may be in excess of his
actual capabilities, Polonsky's
current film reveals an intelligence
and awareness superior to most of
the powers currently at large in
Hollywood. Hopefully, Polonsky
will be given the opportunity to
prove himself, one way or the
