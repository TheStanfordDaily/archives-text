# Hungarian Heroes
## 'Shadows': SRT Success 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
"Shadow of Heroes," a
documentary play of the
Hungarian Revolution (as the
program tells us) is one of the
more interesting dramas I have
seen lately. More important than
that, it is certainly the most
professional looking job I have
seen SRT do in several years.
Every December I go to New
York, see a few plays, and then
take three months or so to get
used to the shabby affairs that
pass for professional theater in the
Bay Area. Well, here I am, barely
six* weeks from Broadway, and I
can say with confidence that
"Shadow of Heroes" looks as
good as anything I saw in New
York.
In fact, the weakest element in
the production seemed to be the
script by Robert Ardrey, whose
book "African Genesis" I greatly
admire, but whose plays (if this
one is a fair example) are not as
good as one would hope.
Hungary's Story Told
Mr. Ardrey has given us the
story of post-war Hungary. The
script seems to focus about Janos
Kadar, the present Premier of
Hungary, and a man who was
intimately involved in the various
intrigues of the late Stalinist era.
But Kadar pops in and out of the
picture so much that I found it
hard to get involved with him as a
character, or with any of the
others, for that matter.
In a sense, the play really is
like a documentary. Aside from
the fact that the characters and
events are true (or pretty much
so—Mr. Ardrey is a gifted
propagandist, and who knows
what really goes on in a
dictatorship, anyway?), they have
a kind of a distant, neutral
appearance, as only the black and
white of a documentary can give
them.
While some of the scenes are
very moving (and the play runs
long enough for there to be plenty
of them), the overall effect is
strangely unemotional, with sort
of mini-catarses all alomg the way,
but nothing to satisfy a true
Aristotelian.
Direction Improves Script
Director Stephen Book has
taken this somewhat imperfect
vehicle and made it seem a lot
more than it really is. As I
mentioned above, this is certainly
one of the most professional
looking productions to grace a
Stanford stage in a long time, and
Mr. Book must take the credit for
that. His direction is clean and
sharp, and he has drawn som
very impressive performance:
from his actors.
Richard Rekow in particular is
an engrossing Janos Kadar,
presenting him as a complex man
who can betray his friend or his
country, and yet who still gives
the impression of simple
self-sacrifice and patriotism. Is he
a pawn, or a puppet-master? Is he
evil, or is he only misunderstood?
The betrayer, or the betrayed?
Very interesting.
Mary Geldard is superb as Julia
Rajk, the wife of the Hungarian
revolutionary whom Kadar sold
out. Kurtwood Smith plays Lazslo

Rajk with dignity and intelligence,
and Gene Parseghian plays Robert
Ardrey and narrates the whole
thing—a thankless task, but what
is a documentary without a
narrator?
William Frankfather and Wes
Finie are featured in the
supporting roles of Erno Gero and
Matyas Rakosi, the leading
Stalinists in the Hungarian
Communist Party. They approach
their parts with a confidence and
professionalism which helps to
give the show that extra polish

which distinguishes it from
previous productions.
I was particularly pleased by
Mr. F rankfather, whose
dispassionate, Machiavellian Gero
was one of the more chilling
characterizations I have seen.
"Shadow of Heroes" will play
through February 21, and I
recommend it to those who would
like to see what a really
professional show looks like. Even
though the script is not the best,
it's quite a change from what
you've been seeing.
