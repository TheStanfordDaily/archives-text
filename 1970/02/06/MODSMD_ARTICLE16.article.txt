# The 						Dead Letter
## Homosexuals Are Human 
### 
Dear Diary,
I haven't written to you in a long time, and it is
time you were brought up to date. Things have
been proceeding exceptionally well. I've been
doing whatever I want whenever I want. And then
there are so many good people that I've met.
People—yes, people are the keys to happiness.
Saturday night Alan and I went up to the city and
saw "Geese." And one of the stars, Peter Still, a
Stanford student who is a friend of ours makes
love with another young man on stage. Imagine,
soeone with whom I worked all summer and
throughout an entire orientation, someone of
whom 1 think a great deal, plays the role of a
homosexual. It was great. After the play Alan and
I went out with cast for some food, and, lo and
behold, all those wierd homosexual and lesbian
types are actually real people.
Appropriately in Drag
And, you know what, Diary, they weren't
dumb or misfits or psychologically disturbed or
anything. They didn't walk funny either except
when "in drag" and then, of course, their walks
were appropriate.
Perhaps the most astounding fact was that they
(shhhh—don't let anyone else know this), they
were intelligent. In fact, if I hadn't known that
they were . . . (well, you know what I mean,
those . . . those . . ~ well those . . .) then I
wouldn't have known that they were
those . . . Like Peter seemed just like he always has
before. (Shhhh . . . and he even looked the same.
Can you believe it?)
And then there was Charles Pierce who plays
The Mother in the second act. Oh yes, vou heard

me correctly, he plays The Mother. And, if I
hadn't looked in the program and seen that it was
indeed Charles Pierce playing The Mother, I might
just have felt that it was Naomi Goldman playing
the role.
Of course, I knew it wasn't Naomi because
Charles is such a superior actor. He lightens up the
extreme seriousness just enough to make the
audience understand the message without making
them die from guilt.
Love Universal
Ahh, the message—well, essentially it's that
homosexuals (whether male or female) are people
also. Moreover, they are people who fall in love
just like people do who fall in love. All they're
asking is that they be allowed to act as they do
without having to feel ashamed, or "crawl under
rocks until night comes." That is, they're asking to
bo treated as fellow human beings. And for some
strange, maybe naive, silly reason that doesn't
seem very much to ask.
Diary, I wish more people would see the play.
It may not be drama of the caliber of "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Wolfe," or have music coparable
to the quality of "My Fair Lady," or even "Hair,"
but it is a touching, sensitive, beautiful portrayal
of what it is like to be sexually different in our
society. In general, the acting is of a high level and
at the very least, seeing Carol Doda as a lesbian is
an experience.
Diary, I got carried away there in discussing
"Geese," but they were good people. I'll write
again soon.
As ever,
Neil

at the very least, seeing Carol Doda as a lesbian is
an experience.
Diary, I got carried away there in discussing
"Geese," but they were good people. I'll write
again soon.
As ever,

Dear Diary,
I haven't written to you in a long time, and it is
time you were brought up to date. Things have
been proceeding exceptionally well. I've been
doing whatever I want whenever I want. And then
there are so many good people that I've met.
People—yes, people are the keys to happiness.
Saturday night Alan and I went up to the city and
saw "Geese." And one of the stars, Peter Still, a
Stanford student who is a friend of ours makes
love with another young man on stage. Imagine,
soeone with whom I worked all summer and
throughout an entire orientation, someone of
whom 1 think a great deal, plays the role of a
homosexual. It was great. After the play Alan and
I went out with cast for some food, and, lo and
behold, all those wierd homosexual and lesbian
types are actually real people.
Appropriately in Drag
And, you know what, Diary, they weren't
dumb or misfits or psychologically disturbed or
anything. They didn't walk funny either except
when "in drag" and then, of course, their walks
were appropriate.
Perhaps the most astounding fact was that they
(shhhh—don't let anyone else know this), they
were intelligent. In fact, if I hadn't known that
they were . . . (well, you know what I mean,
those . . . those . . ~ well those . . .) then I
wouldn't have known that they were
those . . . Like Peter seemed just like he always has
before. (Shhhh . . . and he even looked the same.
Can you believe it?)
And then there was Charles Pierce who plays
The Mother in the second act. Oh yes, vou heard

me correctly, he plays The Mother. And, if I
hadn't looked in the program and seen that it was
indeed Charles Pierce playing The Mother, I might
just have felt that it was Naomi Goldman playing
the role.
Of course, I knew it wasn't Naomi because
Charles is such a superior actor. He lightens up the
extreme seriousness just enough to make the
audience understand the message without making
them die from guilt.
Love Universal
Ahh, the message—well, essentially it's that
homosexuals (whether male or female) are people
also. Moreover, they are people who fall in love
just like people do who fall in love. All they're
asking is that they be allowed to act as they do
without having to feel ashamed, or "crawl under
rocks until night comes." That is, they're asking to
bo treated as fellow human beings. And for some
strange, maybe naive, silly reason that doesn't
seem very much to ask.
Diary, I wish more people would see the play.
It may not be drama of the caliber of "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Wolfe," or have music coparable
to the quality of "My Fair Lady," or even "Hair,"
but it is a touching, sensitive, beautiful portrayal
of what it is like to be sexually different in our
society. In general, the acting is of a high level and
at the very least, seeing Carol Doda as a lesbian is
an experience.
