# Hip MD Delivers Shocking Advice
## 
### 
Dr. Eugene Schoenfield, who
ended his "Dr. Hippocrates"
advice column in the San
Francisco Chronicle this week
rather than face editorial
censorship, discussed some of his
unprinted material Wednesday
night before a crowd of local
Planned Parenthood advocates.
In an atmosphere more similar
to a night club routine then
traditional after-dinner
speechmaking, Schoenfield read
questions he "wasn't really able to
answer." Standing before a pastel
quilt emblazoned with flowers
and pastel letters forming
PLANNED PARENTHOOD, Dr.
Hip recalled:
The woman who enquired
about the existance of an
incurable strain of VD in
Vietnam, and wanted to know if
infected Gl's were shipped off to
a remote Pacific island and listed
as "killed in action. . ."
"Dear Dr. Hip: I've been living
with this girl for about four
months and have been feeling very
tired lately. I am six-foot-two- and
weight 130 pounds. Am I getting
too much?"
A hard-to-please young man
said that he approved of his girl's
contraceptive vaginal cream, but
complained that "it tastes bad."
(Dr. Hip: "I can only suggest that
you write the manufacturer and
request fruit flavors.")
Schoenfield says his letters are
overwhelmingly concerned with
sex and drugs, mostly the former.
In cases where simple written
replies won't suffice, he provides

references to competent medical
people.
Dr. Hip was solemn in warning
against the use of "any drugs"
during pregnancy — "and that
includes tobacco, alcohol, and
aspirin." Chances of harming the
developing fetus are "just too
great" to take any risks.
As for "dushbak" (DB), a new,
hallucinatory substance reputed
to be extremely dangerous to
users, Schoenfield says he hadn't
heard of the drug as yet, but plans
to check into the matter.
