# Black Studies End At UC Riverside
## 
### 
The chancellor of the
University of California at
Riverside announced yesterday
that he is disbanding the school's
Black Studies Department.
Ivan Hinderaker told an
emergency faculty convocation
held in Riverside, Calif, that the
department's chairman, Maurice
Friedman, had resigned his
position to return to the campus'
sociology department.
The chancellor said that the
Black Studies Department was
prematurely created, academically
inferior, and had become a
propaganda organ for the
140-member Black Students
Union on the campus.
"I retain my feeling that the

need for a Black Studies program
is extraordinary," he said. "I will
continue to work toward
developing a sound academic
program in this field."
The faculty members present
gave Hinderaker a standing
ovation when he told them why
he had rejected a BSU demand
that it be given authority to
recruit students and hire black
studies personnel.
"To surrender this authority,"
the chancellor said, "to any other
group would destroy the integrity
of this institution."
The Riverside campus has an
enrollment of 5,524. About 190
students on the campus are
blacks.
