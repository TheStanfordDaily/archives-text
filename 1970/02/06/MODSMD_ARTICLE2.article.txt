# Senate Candidate
## Brown Attacks 'Racism' 
### CHRIS COBEY 
"I think that every institution
of our society is racist."
Congressman George Brown, an
unofficial candidate for the
Democratic nomination for the
US Senate, added that laws and
government could not make the
changes necessary to change the
world. Only individuals could
alleviate the racism prevalent in
America."I doubt if most people
in our society feel that
responsibility very greatly."
Speaking before a Tresidder
Union audience of about seventy
people, Brown asserted that only
hrough first attaining economic

justice could the blacks of
America gain social equality.
Brown answered questions
from six representatives of local
publications, including the Daily,
Cross Currents, The Colonist,
Cliicanismo, The Arena, and the
Young Republican.
The candidate prefaced his
remarks by announcing that he
would formally announce his
candidacy next week. "I'll spread
the good news after having
campaigned for only eight
months."
Priorities
Brown criticized many public
officials for their method of
determining priorities in
accordance with results of opinion
polls. "My biggest goal is
achieving our potential for a great
society, a society with a
drastically reordered set of
priorities.
"We have reached the end of
the line as far as the concepts of
progress and the good life are
concerned."
He said that the nation is
moving into an era where the
main needs will be an increased
awareness of the expansion and
development of the human
conscience.
Third Parties
"I do not encourage the
formation of a third party,"
Brown said. The candidate
preferred the idea of restructuring
the Democratic party, and felt
that it could easily be done,
especially in California. The
problem is to reconstruct a new
Democratic coalition by
consolidating the liberals and
excluding the reactionaries.
In response to a query about
the relevance of the Democratic

party to blacks, Brown insisted
that the party had to be made
"more attractive a vehicle of
progress for black people." When
pressed as to what recourse blacks
had to the Democratic machine of
Mayor Daley of Chicago, the
Congressman replied that the
black people themselves could
gain control of the party in most
of Chicago.
Brown stated his opposition to
a proposed state bill outlawing
strikes of agricultural workers
during crucial harvest periods.
"The right of free collective
bargaining must be maintained,"
he said. The growers and workers
should be left to settle their own
disputes.
Too Liberal?
Harvey Hukari, Jr., of The
Arena said that Brown was
generally considered to be liberal
in political attitude, and asked
whether the Congressman would
attempt to moderate his views to
gain greater support from
moderates and conservatives.
"I do not feel it is necessary to
moderate my views for any
group," he replied. "I've even
alienated some liberals. I've got
some die-hard reactionaries in my
campaign, and they love me."
Brown questioned the value of
ideological labels and voting,
saying that "I will continue to
oppose such great liberals as John
McCormack for Speaker of the
House."
The candidate said that on the
issue of foreign aid, where most
"bleeding heart" liberals vote
large sums for other countries, he
does not. "Our foreign aid is now
a tool of a bankrupt foreign
policy." Brown responded to a
question from Michael Dawson of
The Colonist about the treatment

of the Black Panthers by claiming
that the police forces of the
nation, aided by the FBI, have
attempted to destroy the party,
and have unquestionably violated
the Panthers' civil liberties.
In view of Russian and French
arms aid to Arab countries, the
Congressmen felt that arms
shipments by the United States to
Israel were justified.
Brown also expressed general
support of Chicano aims to add
cultural programs, included
increased teaching of Spanish, to
state school cirricula.
Student Support
In reference to his campaign,
Brown said "I'm not trying to con
any student into working for me."
If students want a better world,
and think that an attempt on one
can be made through politics and
his policies, then they are
welcome to join his campaign.
"It's your responsibility, not
mine," he said.
Brown was reluctant to bring
out any possible points of
difference between his positions
and that of the only declared
Democratic candidate for the
Senate, Congressman John
Tunney of Riverside Brown said,
"Tunney's running against me,
I'm not running against him."
When pressed, he merely said
that Tunney had not opposed
appropriations for the Vietnam
war until last year, while Brown
had done so in 1965. In addition,
Tunney has refused to take a
definite stand on the grape
boycott, while Brown reiterated
his support of it. "Where we
differ," concluded Brown is that
"John has been with the
majority."
