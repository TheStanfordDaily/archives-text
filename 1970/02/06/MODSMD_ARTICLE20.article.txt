# Black Spokesmen Cite Efforts To Reach Workers, Students
## 
### 
Prior to Tuesday's general
meeting of the New Stanford
Moratorium, two black labor
organizers from Detroit spoke to a
group of about 50 persons.
Chuck Wooton and Carl
Williams, on the West Coast for
the radical conference on labor at
Berkeley last weekend, spoke on
organization in the labor unions
and high schools respectively.

Chuck Wooton, member of the
League of Revolutionary Black
Workers, explained the history of
the movement. It began in May of
1968 in the Chrysler plant in
Detroit. The black workers were
becoming more aware that the
greatest percentage of Negro
workers were in the most
difficult, dangerous jobs and also
those most likely to be hit by
"speedups" in assembly work.
The lack of black skilled
tradesmen, and presence of racist
foremen, compounded the
difficulties.

When the United Auto Workers
would not respond to the plight,
the organization known as the
Dodge Revolutionary Union
Movement (DRUM) issued
demands for ''equal
representation in the union and
improved safety standards." A
wildcat strike was held when the
demands were ignored until an
injunction against the strike was
obtained by the Chrysler
Corporation.
August, 1968, saw an opening
for an union trustee at the local
level. DRUM's candidate received
a majority of the vote, although
still short of the needed 50%, 28
candidates originally ran for the
post. Wooton claims that a joint
effort on the part of the union,
the industry, and the city to get
the old "primarily white middle
class retirees" to vote against the
black candidate in the run-off
election defeated the black
candidate.
The second speaker, Carl
Williams, spoke of the conditions
that existed in the 22 Detroit
public high schools, 18 of which
are almost totally comprised of
black students.
Racist administrators, bad
physical plant conditions and
especially poor lunch rooms
headed the list of visible
1 hardships. Williams, however,
' expressed even greater fear over
the things taught to the blacks,
such as "white is right" and
> "friend is enemy, and enemy is
1 friend."
Presently Williams is working to
5 organize within the schools. The
I" first step he wishes to see taken is
s the control of the schools shifted
to the community.
