# Paly's Illegal Paper
## School Suspends Rads 
### BILL EVERS 
The collision several days ago
of Palo Alto High School
administrative officials with
Radical Student Union (RSU)
members over the RSU's
newspaper has resulted in the
temporary suspension of students
and has the school still in turmoil.
The incident which sparked the
current affair began with the
distribution of the third issue of
the RSU's Radical Rag on the
high school campus Thursday at
noon.
That afternoon a faculty
member spotted a male senior
giving out copies of the newspaper

to students who asked for them.
The student was suspended. He
was reinstated the next day.
The RSU, which had to go to
court in order to pressure the
school to allow the RSU to be a
legal, on-campus organization, is
prohibited by a general ruling of
the Palo Alto school board from
distributing literature on campus
without the approval of the
director of student activities or
the principal.
The Radical Rag is edited and
printed off campus. It contains
news and opinion which reflect
the RSU's anarchist viewpoint.
Graphics and photographs tend
toward the Dada "flip-out."
On Friday, the RSU called a
noon rally. At the rally, Jim
Ernst, the high school's director
of student activities, confiscated
the copies of the Radical Rag
which RSU members had on hand
to distribute.
One student, Dave Jacobs,
refused to give up the papers in

his possession. He was asked to
come to Ernst's office. One
hundred students accompanied
Jacobs to Ernst's office.
In the office, one administrator
called the newspaper obscene.
Jacobs replied that if anything
was obscene it was a school
system whose history classes teach
about democracy and free speech,
but then denies these to students.
Reportedly the administrator
answered: "What, you think
democracy is where you vote. No,
we're the authorities; we make the
decisions." Jacobs was suspended,
and later Friday afternoon two
more students were also
suspended.
On Monday morning, RSU
members handed out an
informational leaflet to students
as they arrived. Later in the
morning, George Millar, the high
school principal, after meeting
with the students' parents,
decided to reinstate those thus far
suspended.
