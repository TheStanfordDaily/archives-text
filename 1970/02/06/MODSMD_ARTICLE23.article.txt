# Non-French Majors Invited To Apply For Tours Program
## 
### 
Next September for the first
time since the program started six
years ago, the group of Stanford
students studying at the
University of Orleans-Tours will
include undergraduates from
other departments as well as
French majors.

Formerly situated in the
Breton capital of Nantes, this
program of advanced studies is
now in its second year at Tours in
the heart of the chateau country
of the Loire valley. Under the
academic supervision of the
French and Italian department, it
is open to Juniors and Seniors in
good academic standing who have
the necessary proficiency in
French to enable them to enroll in
courses at a French university.
(This means doing all their work
in French - not only reading, but
papers, exams and oral
participation in classes.)
French majors are assured that
their studies in the program will
count toward the satisfaction of
the requirements for their major
at Stanford. Students in other
disciplines should seek assurance
from their own departmental
adviser that participation in the
program would be compatible
with their program of studies.
The program includes two
quarters spent abroad (Fall and
Winter), with room and board
provided in a "Cite Universitaire"
at Tours, as well as transportation
one-way from Stanford to the
Orleans-Tours Center.
Next year, students enrolled in
the program will work under the
supervision of Prof. Marc Bertrand
of the French and Italian
department, who will direct the
program, giving courses himself
and also assisting students in
choosing and working for the
courses at the University. He will
also lead guided field trips and
organize other group activities.
Enrollment in the program

normally carried Stanford credit
for fifteen units of course work
for each of the two quarters. Most
students will probably take most
of their courses in French
literature, but the Unitersity of
Tours offers a broad spectrum of
courses in many discrplines.
Students interested in the
program or seeking information
about it should get application
forms from the secretary of the
French and Italian department, in
Room 72E, Inner Quad and
should also consult with Professor
Bertrand, whose office is in Room
72D. The formal deadline for
application for next year's group
is March 15th, but prospective
applicants are urged strongly to
apply as soon as possible, because
of the limited number of places in
the program.

students will probably take most
of their courses in French
literature, but the Unitersity of
Tours offers a broad spectrum of
courses in many discrplines.
Students interested in the
program or seeking information
about it should get application
forms from the secretary of the
French and Italian department, in
Room 72E, Inner Quad and
should also consult with Professor
Bertrand, whose office is in Room
72D. The formal deadline for
application for next year's group
is March 15th, but prospective
applicants are urged strongly to
apply as soon as possible, because
of the limited number of places in
the program.
