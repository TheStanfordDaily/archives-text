# Michigan Prof Describes 'Man In Communist China'
## 
### JOHN SLOAN 
'The Concept of Man in
Communist China' was discussed
by Dr. Donald Munro, of the
University of Michigan, speaking
before a large audience here
Wednesday night.
This was the first of a four-part
series to be given by Professor
Munro in Bishop Auditorium. The
series is being sponsored by the
Evans-Wentz Series in Oriental
Religions.
In his opening statements
Professor Munro said that the
philosophical and psychological
assumptions that the Chinese
make about the concept of man
are not only embodied in official
policies, such as education, but
also serve to tell us something
about China today.
In Munro's view, the
Communist Chinese have
combined parts of the traditional
idea of man with Marxist
philosophy.
He described the Classic
Confucian view of man as a being
with an important social behavior
and nature and a less important
natural behavior, and one who
had common feelings with all men
and wanted to satisfy common
needs. This attitude is still found
in China today.
The Marxist view is divided into
two ideas; first, that the essence
of man is always changing, and
therefore there is no abstract
human nature, and secondly that
man has basic needs, drives, and
appetites.
The Chinese have combined
these two groups of thought to
come up with a double view of

man. Firstly, man has a natural
essence—food, sex, etc .. . and
secondly a social essence—feelings,
thoughts, etc., which are socially
determined.
The main break with the past is
that this social essence is no
longer innate, but rather ever
changing. Munro stated that the
importance of this difference
cannot be overemphasized.
The consequence of this
distinction between the natural
and social natures of man is a
downgrading of biological and
physical variabilities by the
Chinese Communists which is a
split with Western and Russian
thinking.
They see man's nature arising
out of social contact and find that
the other ideas might lead to
thoughts that the human
condition cannot be changed.
Instead they view human
nature as concrete reactions
coming from direct social action,
with no common sentiments
between different classes.

Therefore, Munro believes the
Communists are emphasising the
differences in men rather than
their similarities. This stress on
the social nature in man has led
some of the older, Western
educated professionals to warn
that by ignoring the nonsocial
aspects of man, the younger
Communists will eventually fall
into the same erroneous
progression as the Confucian
scholars.
The practical application in this
downgrading of the biological side
can be seen in the Communist
idea of the malleability of men.
They can focus 011 changing men's
thoughts through their theories of
educational and social control.
The changing of education
along these lines was seen in the
Cutlural Revolution, especially in
rural areas.
Professor Munro closed his talk
by stating that "this concept of
man may have very timely
implications" which he will deal
with next Wednesday night.

Chinese Communists which is a
split with Western and Russian
thinking.
They see man's nature arising
out of social contact and find that
the other ideas might lead to
thoughts that the human
condition cannot be changed.
Instead they view human
nature as concrete reactions
coming from direct social action,
with no common sentiments
between different classes.

Therefore, Munro believes the
Communists are emphasising the
differences in men rather than
their similarities. This stress on
the social nature in man has led
some of the older, Western
educated professionals to warn
that by ignoring the nonsocial
aspects of man, the younger
Communists will eventually fall
into the same erroneous
progression as the Confucian
scholars.
The practical application in this
downgrading of the biological side
can be seen in the Communist
idea of the malleability of men.
They can focus 011 changing men's
thoughts through their theories of
educational and social control.
The changing of education
along these lines was seen in the
Cutlural Revolution, especially in
rural areas.
Professor Munro closed his talk
by stating that "this concept of
man may have very timely
implications" which he will deal
with next Wednesday night.
'The Concept of Man in
Communist China' was discussed
by Dr. Donald Munro, of the
University of Michigan, speaking
before a large audience here
Wednesday night.
This was the first of a four-part
series to be given by Professor
Munro in Bishop Auditorium. The
series is being sponsored by the
Evans-Wentz Series in Oriental
Religions.
In his opening statements
Professor Munro said that the
philosophical and psychological
assumptions that the Chinese
make about the concept of man
are not only embodied in official
policies, such as education, but
also serve to tell us something
about China today.
In Munro's view, the
Communist Chinese have
combined parts of the traditional
idea of man with Marxist
philosophy.
He described the Classic
Confucian view of man as a being
with an important social behavior
and nature and a less important
natural behavior, and one who
had common feelings with all men
and wanted to satisfy common
needs. This attitude is still found
in China today.
The Marxist view is divided into
two ideas; first, that the essence
of man is always changing, and
therefore there is no abstract
human nature, and secondly that
man has basic needs, drives, and
appetites.
The Chinese have combined
these two groups of thought to
come up with a double view of

man. Firstly, man has a natural
essence—food, sex, etc .. . and
secondly a social essence—feelings,
thoughts, etc., which are socially
determined.
The main break with the past is
that this social essence is no
longer innate, but rather ever
changing. Munro stated that the
importance of this difference
cannot be overemphasized.
The consequence of this
distinction between the natural
and social natures of man is a
downgrading of biological and
physical variabilities by the
Chinese Communists which is a
split with Western and Russian
thinking.
They see man's nature arising
out of social contact and find that
