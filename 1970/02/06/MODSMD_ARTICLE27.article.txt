nucleus of two strong players.
Junior Tom Watson tied for fifth
in the U.S. Amateur
Championships last summer and
has subsequently been invited to
play in the Masters' Invitational
Tournament, one of the most
prestigious events in golf, later
this spring.
Watson will be Finger's number
one man and will be backed up by
sophomore Gary Canier, a transfer
from Menlo College. Sophomore
Steve Ross looks to be the
number three man. Other
potential standouts are sophs
James Dwulet and Tom Keelin.

rugby club, Stanford's ruggers will
face a University of California at
Santa Barbara squad tomorrow
afternoon at 1:30 here.
Described by Stanford coach
Pete Kmetovic as "a real strong,
scrambling team," UCSB has lost to
both Cal and UCLA thus far this
season. With an eye on next
week's encounter with UCLA in
Los Angeles, Kmetovic is hinting
that he might juggle his lineup
somewhat against the Gauchos.
Scrum half Jim Squeri is a
doubtful starter tomorrow and
there's a chance that Steward
Wilson, a former member of
England's national team will play
at the Ist 5/8 slot. The Indians
have had a week of good
workouts, according to Kmetovic.

with juniors Bruce Schoen and
Bob Marshall and sophs Tom

Ron Shotts (Minn.), Jack Hodges
(K.C.), Mike Schomaker, John

Williams.
Although the Indians collected
only four hits off Philly pitchers
Tuesday, Young wasn't
particularly disappointed. "We hit
several hard shots and didn't go
after many bad pitches," the
coach said, "and our players
hadn't seen too many curve balls
before the game. And defensively,
I thought we looked very good."
