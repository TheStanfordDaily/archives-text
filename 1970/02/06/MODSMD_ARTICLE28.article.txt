At a cursory glance, it's just
another weekend of Pac-8
basketball at Maples Pavilion;
Stanford versus Oregon tonight
and against Oregon State
tomorrow.
Though none of those three
teams seems to be going anywhere
in particular right now, this year
marks an interesting shift in
power between the Oregon
schools.
Specifically, OSU is in its worst
shape in a long time, and the
Ducks, subservient to the Beavers
for a decade, may be off and
winging.
The Indians will have their
hands full with both; Oregon is
9-6 and OSU 8-8 on the season.
Beaver Coach Paul Valenti, the
only man other than John
Wooden to win a Pac-8 basketball
title in the last seven years,
resigned last week because of fan
pressure. He will finish the season.
Meanwhile Oregon boss Steve
Belko, booed for years, is getting
results from his recent recruiting
drives (his starting line-up tonight
has four players from California
and one from Washington, D.C.)
and has unexpectedly won the Far
West Classic, a holiday
tournament that goes over big in
Portland, for two successive years.
Belko personally scouted
Stanford last week, and then went

off and left his report behind.
Publicity sheets indicate, however,
that he remembered the names
Claude Terry and Dennis O'Neill,
and that he expects a close game.
Stan Love (6-9) and Bill
Droziak (6-5) pace the Ducks with
averages of 17.9 and 14.4 points.
Oregon has played well at times
and not so well at others, and
Stanford will have a good chance
of knocking them off if the Ducks
come up with a mediocre
performance.
Oregon State, though, has
more height—namely 7-0 Vic
Bartolome who doesn't really take
advantage of it. Most of his shots
are from very close range; he leads
the nation in field goal percentage
at .695, and carries a 15.7 average.
But the key to the Beaver
attack is 6-9 forward Gary
Freeman who shoots inside,
outside, rebounds well, and
averages 15.8 per game.
Forward Vince Fritz is a fine
distance shooter when he's
hot —which isn't always—and
there's 5-8 Billy Nickleberry who
jumps incredibly well and who
would be an excellent fast-break
guard.
But the Beavers don't like to
run. In fact, Stanford's best
chance against the lumbering
Staters would be to force a quick
tempo if possible, and gang up on
Freeman.

basketball at Maples Pavilion;
Stanford versus Oregon tonight
and against Oregon State
tomorrow.
Though none of those three
teams seems to be going anywhere
in particular right now, this year
marks an interesting shift in
power between the Oregon
schools.
Specifically, OSU is in its worst
shape in a long time, and the
Ducks, subservient to the Beavers
for a decade, may be off and
winging.
The Indians will have their
hands full with both; Oregon is
9-6 and OSU 8-8 on the season.
Beaver Coach Paul Valenti, the
only man other than John
Wooden to win a Pac-8 basketball
title in the last seven years,
resigned last week because of fan
pressure. He will finish the season.
Meanwhile Oregon boss Steve
Belko, booed for years, is getting
results from his recent recruiting
drives (his starting line-up tonight
has four players from California
and one from Washington, D.C.)
and has unexpectedly won the Far
West Classic, a holiday
tournament that goes over big in
Portland, for two successive years.
Belko personally scouted
Stanford last week, and then went

off and left his report behind.
Publicity sheets indicate, however,
that he remembered the names
Claude Terry and Dennis O'Neill,
and that he expects a close game.
Stan Love (6-9) and Bill
Droziak (6-5) pace the Ducks with
averages of 17.9 and 14.4 points.
Oregon has played well at times
and not so well at others, and
Stanford will have a good chance
of knocking them off if the Ducks
come up with a mediocre
performance.
Oregon State, though, has
more height—namely 7-0 Vic
Bartolome who doesn't really take
advantage of it. Most of his shots
are from very close range; he leads
the nation in field goal percentage
at .695, and carries a 15.7 average.
But the key to the Beaver
attack is 6-9 forward Gary
Freeman who shoots inside,
outside, rebounds well, and
averages 15.8 per game.
Forward Vince Fritz is a fine
distance shooter when he's
hot —which isn't always—and
there's 5-8 Billy Nickleberry who
jumps incredibly well and who
would be an excellent fast-break
guard.
But the Beavers don't like to
run. In fact, Stanford's best
chance against the lumbering
Staters would be to force a quick
tempo if possible, and gang up on
Freeman.
At a cursory glance, it's just
another weekend of Pac-8
basketball at Maples Pavilion;
Stanford versus Oregon tonight
and against Oregon State
tomorrow.
