# East Meets West
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
It's Yale week at Stanford.
Sunday morning, Rev. William
Sloane Coffin speaks at Mem Chu,
and tomorrow afternoon the
Stanford Indians and the Yale Elis
go at it in Encina Pool at 2 p.m.,
before an expected sellout crowd
of 1700 biased swimming fans.
Stanford, the third-ranked
team in the nation, currently
sports a 38-4-1 dual meet record.
One of the four losses was to
Yale, when the two teams met for
the first time, last year in New
Haven.
This year, Yale is the visitor,
and the Stanford "barbarians" (as
they are fondly known to their Eli
competitors) are hoping for top
performances and cold
weather—Yale swims in an indoor
pool in New Haven, and is
concerned (among other things)
with the distance from Encina
pool to a nice, warm shower.
Assuming the delicate Elis manage
to keep warm, the meet between
fifth-ranked Yale, and Stanford,
should be one of the best in the
country this season.

Following is a capsule
summary of tomorrow's events,
and the personalities who will
figure prominently in them.
400-yd. Medley Relay: The
event which Coach Jim Gaughran
feels "may be a decider," finds
the Stanford team of Fred
Haywood, John Ferris, Brian Job
and Steve Carey second-ranked
nationally. Freshmen Job and
Carey (ineligible due to Ivy
League rules) will be watching
teammates Dave Shilling and one
of a trio of top Stanford
sprinters —Bob Jamison, Rick
Eagleston, or Bob Bebb in a
struggle of the titans; Yale's relay
team could include three of their
finest strokesmen- Ed Bettendorf,
Paul Katz, and Phil Long—as well
as any of their top sprinters,
possibly Jim Denvir, Bob Kasting,
or Rich May.
1000 yd. Freestyle: Stanford's
distance squad, minus freshman
ace Tim Broderick, will be led by
Olympian Brent Berk, and will
include sophomore Mark Shelley,
and juniors Bert Mason and Ray
Collins. Yale also boasts an
Olympic veteran—John Nelson,

one of thy nation's finest distance
swimmers. He will probably be
joined by Bob Macionis or
Kasting.
A good supporting
performance by Mason (10:51.1
against Washington) or Shelley
(10:13.5) could be a decisive
factor in the meet—last week
against Navy, Macionis took
second to Nelson with 10:31.8.
200-Free: Stanford must here
rely on two of the four distance
swimmers mentioned above; Yale
could go with Kasting or Mike
Cadden.
50 Free: Jamison, Eagleston,
and Bebb lead the Stanford
swimmers in the sprint events, and
two-tenths of a second may well
separate tomorrow's winner from
the third-place finisher; Yale's
Dean Kackley, May, and Denvir
all are top sprinters. Jamison went
:21.9 against Santa Clara, May hit
: 22.0 last week.
200 Individual Medley: John
Ferris, a basket-weaving major
from Sacramento, is a great
crowd-pleaser. This is probably

because he is a damn fast
swimmer. Stanford's leading
barbarian ranks third in the IM
nationally with 1:57.4. Teammate
Dave Shilling ranks eighth in the
same event, with a 1:59.7. The
two could well sweep this event
against Yale's Brad McKean
(4:03.0), Ben Clark, or Kasting.
Diving: The Indian diving
tandem of Bill Main and Ted
Nichols which is undefeated this
season, is not likely to be beaten
tomorrow. One-two finishes for
Stanford in both the 1-meter and
3-meter diving could be the
deciding factor in the meet.
Lacking depth, Yale will go with
sophomore Rick Kincade; even
Rev. Coffin has been working on a
double twist off the high board.
200 Butterfly: John Ferris'
only loss last year was at the
hands of Yale's Paul Katz. Ferris
currently leads the nation in this
event, with a 1:55.1; Katz took
second place last week to a Navy
swimmer, turning in 2:00.4.
Hopefully, Stanford's Mike
Masarie will make his butterfly
debut tomorrow, after sitting out
the first half of this season with a

broken collarbone. A race
between Ferris, Katz, Masarie, and
Rich Guelff, Yale's fine backup
man, would pit four fine
butterfliers in one of the
afternoon's highlights.
100 Freestyle: Jamison ranks
eighth nationally in this event,
with a :47.8 clocking; Eagleston
and Bebb have both gone
best-times of :47.6 or better. Bill
Goerlich, May, Cadden, Kasting,
and Denvir have all posted
clockings of :48.6 or better.
Another fun race for the judges to
pick.
20 0 It acksl r n k e : Fred
Haywood, Stanford captain, has
an amusing way of relieving
tension by taking false starts, a
rarity in backstroke competition.
He also amused Indiana's Charlie
Hickox last year by winning this
event in the NCAA's, and
currently ranks fourth nationally,
with 1 :58.0. Ed Bettendorf, who
beat Haywood last year at New
Haven, has a lifetime best of
1:57.5 (Haywood's is 1:56.8), last
week went 2:00.6 against Navy.

Stanford's second man, Rob
Wolley, will face either Chuck
Goetschhe, Ben Clark, or Kelly
Falloon.
50 0 Freestyle: See
1000-Freestyle. Berk ranks ninth
nationally with 4 :51.9; Nelson hit
4:54.4 against Navy, 14 seconds
slower than his lifetime best.
200-yd. Breaststroke: Dave
Shilling has been getting
second-place publicity to frosh
phenom Brian Job; this weekend,
he is likely to be the focus of a bit
more attention. Last year's NCAA
runner-up will meet Yale's
Olympian Phil Long. Jim Morris
could be another key figure—his
2:17.4 lifetime best is two
seconds faster than that of his
Yale counterpart Tim Fretthold,
who hit 2:25.5 against Navy.
40 0 yd. Free Relay:
Speculation is great that this race
will be the deciding event. Entries
for both teams will depend on the
individual performances in
proceding events. A possible
Stanford team of Jamison,
Haywood, Bebb and Eagelston; a
possible Yale rival squad of
Denvir, May, Cadden, and Kasting
or Kackley.
All apologies to Rev. Coffin,
but it should be a hell of a meet.


THE DIFFERENCE? Sophomore Ineaststroke ace Dave Shilling, second ranked
nationally in the 200-yd. event, tvill be an important factor in tomorrow's big
meet against Vale.


COACHKS: Stanford's Jim (<aughran
(above) and Yale's Phil Moriarty lead
their s(|iiads into tomorrow's meet at
Kngina Fools, (iaughran is in his ten(li
season as mentor here, with one
national championship, in I 967, to his
credit. Moriarty has coached the
Bulldogs to eight of Ihe past ten
Kastern Intercollegiate Swim League
titles. Tickets for the meet are still
available to anvone who can fork up
$3.

and the Stanford "barbarians" (as
they are fondly known to their Eli
competitors) are hoping for top
performances and cold
weather—Yale swims in an indoor
pool in New Haven, and is
concerned (among other things)
with the distance from Encina
pool to a nice, warm shower.
Assuming the delicate Elis manage
to keep warm, the meet between
fifth-ranked Yale, and Stanford,
should be one of the best in the
country this season.

Following is a capsule
summary of tomorrow's events,
and the personalities who will
figure prominently in them.
400-yd. Medley Relay: The
event which Coach Jim Gaughran
feels "may be a decider," finds
the Stanford team of Fred
Haywood, John Ferris, Brian Job
and Steve Carey second-ranked
nationally. Freshmen Job and
Carey (ineligible due to Ivy
League rules) will be watching
teammates Dave Shilling and one
of a trio of top Stanford
sprinters —Bob Jamison, Rick
Eagleston, or Bob Bebb in a
struggle of the titans; Yale's relay
team could include three of their
finest strokesmen- Ed Bettendorf,
Paul Katz, and Phil Long—as well
as any of their top sprinters,
possibly Jim Denvir, Bob Kasting,
or Rich May.
1000 yd. Freestyle: Stanford's
distance squad, minus freshman
ace Tim Broderick, will be led by
Olympian Brent Berk, and will
include sophomore Mark Shelley,
and juniors Bert Mason and Ray
Collins. Yale also boasts an
Olympic veteran—John Nelson,

one of thy nation's finest distance
swimmers. He will probably be
joined by Bob Macionis or
Kasting.
A good supporting
performance by Mason (10:51.1
against Washington) or Shelley
(10:13.5) could be a decisive
factor in the meet—last week
against Navy, Macionis took
second to Nelson with 10:31.8.
200-Free: Stanford must here
rely on two of the four distance
swimmers mentioned above; Yale
could go with Kasting or Mike
Cadden.
50 Free: Jamison, Eagleston,
and Bebb lead the Stanford
swimmers in the sprint events, and
two-tenths of a second may well
separate tomorrow's winner from
the third-place finisher; Yale's
Dean Kackley, May, and Denvir
all are top sprinters. Jamison went
:21.9 against Santa Clara, May hit
: 22.0 last week.
200 Individual Medley: John
Ferris, a basket-weaving major
from Sacramento, is a great
crowd-pleaser. This is probably

because he is a damn fast
swimmer. Stanford's leading
barbarian ranks third in the IM
nationally with 1:57.4. Teammate
Dave Shilling ranks eighth in the
same event, with a 1:59.7. The
two could well sweep this event
against Yale's Brad McKean
(4:03.0), Ben Clark, or Kasting.
Diving: The Indian diving
tandem of Bill Main and Ted
Nichols which is undefeated this
season, is not likely to be beaten
tomorrow. One-two finishes for
Stanford in both the 1-meter and
3-meter diving could be the
deciding factor in the meet.
Lacking depth, Yale will go with
sophomore Rick Kincade; even
Rev. Coffin has been working on a
double twist off the high board.
200 Butterfly: John Ferris'
only loss last year was at the
hands of Yale's Paul Katz. Ferris
currently leads the nation in this
event, with a 1:55.1; Katz took
second place last week to a Navy
swimmer, turning in 2:00.4.
Hopefully, Stanford's Mike
Masarie will make his butterfly
debut tomorrow, after sitting out
the first half of this season with a

broken collarbone. A race
between Ferris, Katz, Masarie, and
Rich Guelff, Yale's fine backup
man, would pit four fine
butterfliers in one of the
afternoon's highlights.
100 Freestyle: Jamison ranks
eighth nationally in this event,
with a :47.8 clocking; Eagleston
and Bebb have both gone
best-times of :47.6 or better. Bill
Goerlich, May, Cadden, Kasting,
and Denvir have all posted
clockings of :48.6 or better.
Another fun race for the judges to
pick.
20 0 It acksl r n k e : Fred
Haywood, Stanford captain, has
an amusing way of relieving
tension by taking false starts, a
rarity in backstroke competition.
He also amused Indiana's Charlie
Hickox last year by winning this
event in the NCAA's, and
currently ranks fourth nationally,
with 1 :58.0. Ed Bettendorf, who
beat Haywood last year at New
Haven, has a lifetime best of
1:57.5 (Haywood's is 1:56.8), last
week went 2:00.6 against Navy.

Stanford's second man, Rob
Wolley, will face either Chuck
Goetschhe, Ben Clark, or Kelly
Falloon.
50 0 Freestyle: See
1000-Freestyle. Berk ranks ninth
nationally with 4 :51.9; Nelson hit
4:54.4 against Navy, 14 seconds
slower than his lifetime best.
200-yd. Breaststroke: Dave
Shilling has been getting
second-place publicity to frosh
phenom Brian Job; this weekend,
he is likely to be the focus of a bit
more attention. Last year's NCAA
runner-up will meet Yale's
Olympian Phil Long. Jim Morris
could be another key figure—his
2:17.4 lifetime best is two
seconds faster than that of his
Yale counterpart Tim Fretthold,
who hit 2:25.5 against Navy.
40 0 yd. Free Relay:
Speculation is great that this race
will be the deciding event. Entries
for both teams will depend on the
individual performances in
proceding events. A possible
Stanford team of Jamison,
Haywood, Bebb and Eagelston; a
possible Yale rival squad of
Denvir, May, Cadden, and Kasting
or Kackley.
All apologies to Rev. Coffin,
but it should be a hell of a meet.


THE DIFFERENCE? Sophomore Ineaststroke ace Dave Shilling, second ranked
nationally in the 200-yd. event, tvill be an important factor in tomorrow's big
meet against Vale.


COACHKS: Stanford's Jim (<aughran
(above) and Yale's Phil Moriarty lead
their s(|iiads into tomorrow's meet at
Kngina Fools, (iaughran is in his ten(li
season as mentor here, with one
national championship, in I 967, to his
credit. Moriarty has coached the
Bulldogs to eight of Ihe past ten
Kastern Intercollegiate Swim League
titles. Tickets for the meet are still
available to anvone who can fork up
$3.

It's Yale week at Stanford.
Sunday morning, Rev. William
Sloane Coffin speaks at Mem Chu,
and tomorrow afternoon the
Stanford Indians and the Yale Elis
go at it in Encina Pool at 2 p.m.,
before an expected sellout crowd
of 1700 biased swimming fans.
Stanford, the third-ranked
team in the nation, currently
sports a 38-4-1 dual meet record.
One of the four losses was to
Yale, when the two teams met for
the first time, last year in New
Haven.

400-yd. Medley Relay: The
event which Coach Jim Gaughran
feels "may be a decider," finds
the Stanford team of Fred
Haywood, John Ferris, Brian Job
and Steve Carey second-ranked
nationally. Freshmen Job and
Carey (ineligible due to Ivy
League rules) will be watching
teammates Dave Shilling and one
of a trio of top Stanford
sprinters —Bob Jamison, Rick
Eagleston, or Bob Bebb in a
struggle of the titans; Yale's relay
team could include three of their
finest strokesmen- Ed Bettendorf,
Paul Katz, and Phil Long—as well
as any of their top sprinters,
possibly Jim Denvir, Bob Kasting,
or Rich May.
1000 yd. Freestyle: Stanford's
distance squad, minus freshman
ace Tim Broderick, will be led by
Olympian Brent Berk, and will
include sophomore Mark Shelley,
and juniors Bert Mason and Ray
Collins. Yale also boasts an
Olympic veteran—John Nelson,

one of thy nation's finest distance
swimmers. He will probably be
joined by Bob Macionis or
Kasting.
A good supporting
performance by Mason (10:51.1
against Washington) or Shelley
(10:13.5) could be a decisive
factor in the meet—last week
against Navy, Macionis took
second to Nelson with 10:31.8.
200-Free: Stanford must here
rely on two of the four distance
swimmers mentioned above; Yale
could go with Kasting or Mike
Cadden.
50 Free: Jamison, Eagleston,
and Bebb lead the Stanford
swimmers in the sprint events, and
two-tenths of a second may well
separate tomorrow's winner from
the third-place finisher; Yale's
Dean Kackley, May, and Denvir
all are top sprinters. Jamison went
:21.9 against Santa Clara, May hit
: 22.0 last week.
200 Individual Medley: John
Ferris, a basket-weaving major
from Sacramento, is a great
crowd-pleaser. This is probably

because he is a damn fast
swimmer. Stanford's leading
barbarian ranks third in the IM
nationally with 1:57.4. Teammate
Dave Shilling ranks eighth in the
same event, with a 1:59.7. The
two could well sweep this event
against Yale's Brad McKean
(4:03.0), Ben Clark, or Kasting.
Diving: The Indian diving
tandem of Bill Main and Ted
Nichols which is undefeated this
season, is not likely to be beaten
tomorrow. One-two finishes for
Stanford in both the 1-meter and
3-meter diving could be the
deciding factor in the meet.
Lacking depth, Yale will go with
sophomore Rick Kincade; even
Rev. Coffin has been working on a
double twist off the high board.
200 Butterfly: John Ferris'
only loss last year was at the
hands of Yale's Paul Katz. Ferris
currently leads the nation in this
event, with a 1:55.1; Katz took
second place last week to a Navy
swimmer, turning in 2:00.4.
Hopefully, Stanford's Mike
Masarie will make his butterfly
debut tomorrow, after sitting out
the first half of this season with a

broken collarbone. A race
between Ferris, Katz, Masarie, and
Rich Guelff, Yale's fine backup
man, would pit four fine
butterfliers in one of the
afternoon's highlights.
100 Freestyle: Jamison ranks
eighth nationally in this event,
with a :47.8 clocking; Eagleston
and Bebb have both gone
best-times of :47.6 or better. Bill
Goerlich, May, Cadden, Kasting,
and Denvir have all posted
clockings of :48.6 or better.
Another fun race for the judges to
pick.
20 0 It acksl r n k e : Fred
Haywood, Stanford captain, has
an amusing way of relieving
tension by taking false starts, a
rarity in backstroke competition.
He also amused Indiana's Charlie
Hickox last year by winning this
event in the NCAA's, and
currently ranks fourth nationally,
with 1 :58.0. Ed Bettendorf, who
beat Haywood last year at New
Haven, has a lifetime best of
1:57.5 (Haywood's is 1:56.8), last
week went 2:00.6 against Navy.

Stanford's second man, Rob
Wolley, will face either Chuck
Goetschhe, Ben Clark, or Kelly
Falloon.
50 0 Freestyle: See
1000-Freestyle. Berk ranks ninth
nationally with 4 :51.9; Nelson hit
4:54.4 against Navy, 14 seconds
slower than his lifetime best.
200-yd. Breaststroke: Dave
Shilling has been getting
second-place publicity to frosh
phenom Brian Job; this weekend,
he is likely to be the focus of a bit
more attention. Last year's NCAA
runner-up will meet Yale's
Olympian Phil Long. Jim Morris
could be another key figure—his
2:17.4 lifetime best is two
seconds faster than that of his
Yale counterpart Tim Fretthold,
who hit 2:25.5 against Navy.
40 0 yd. Free Relay:
Speculation is great that this race
will be the deciding event. Entries
for both teams will depend on the
individual performances in
proceding events. A possible
Stanford team of Jamison,
Haywood, Bebb and Eagelston; a
possible Yale rival squad of
Denvir, May, Cadden, and Kasting
or Kackley.
All apologies to Rev. Coffin,
but it should be a hell of a meet.


THE DIFFERENCE? Sophomore Ineaststroke ace Dave Shilling, second ranked
nationally in the 200-yd. event, tvill be an important factor in tomorrow's big
meet against Vale.


COACHKS: Stanford's Jim (<aughran
(above) and Yale's Phil Moriarty lead
their s(|iiads into tomorrow's meet at
Kngina Fools, (iaughran is in his ten(li
season as mentor here, with one
national championship, in I 967, to his
credit. Moriarty has coached the
Bulldogs to eight of Ihe past ten
Kastern Intercollegiate Swim League
titles. Tickets for the meet are still
available to anvone who can fork up
$3.

It's Yale week at Stanford.
Sunday morning, Rev. William
Sloane Coffin speaks at Mem Chu,
and tomorrow afternoon the
Stanford Indians and the Yale Elis
go at it in Encina Pool at 2 p.m.,
before an expected sellout crowd
of 1700 biased swimming fans.
Stanford, the third-ranked
team in the nation, currently
sports a 38-4-1 dual meet record.
One of the four losses was to
Yale, when the two teams met for
the first time, last year in New
Haven.
This year, Yale is the visitor,
and the Stanford "barbarians" (as
they are fondly known to their Eli
competitors) are hoping for top
performances and cold
weather—Yale swims in an indoor
pool in New Haven, and is
concerned (among other things)
with the distance from Encina
pool to a nice, warm shower.
Assuming the delicate Elis manage
to keep warm, the meet between
fifth-ranked Yale, and Stanford,
should be one of the best in the
country this season.

Following is a capsule
summary of tomorrow's events,
and the personalities who will

Paul Katz, and Phil Long—as well
as any of their top sprinters,
possibly Jim Denvir, Bob Kasting,
or Rich May.
1000 yd. Freestyle: Stanford's
distance squad, minus freshman
ace Tim Broderick, will be led by
Olympian Brent Berk, and will
include sophomore Mark Shelley,
and juniors Bert Mason and Ray
Collins. Yale also boasts an
Olympic veteran—John Nelson,

one of thy nation's finest distance
swimmers. He will probably be
joined by Bob Macionis or
Kasting.
A good supporting
performance by Mason (10:51.1
against Washington) or Shelley
(10:13.5) could be a decisive
factor in the meet—last week
against Navy, Macionis took
second to Nelson with 10:31.8.
200-Free: Stanford must here
rely on two of the four distance
swimmers mentioned above; Yale
could go with Kasting or Mike
Cadden.
50 Free: Jamison, Eagleston,
and Bebb lead the Stanford
swimmers in the sprint events, and
two-tenths of a second may well
separate tomorrow's winner from
the third-place finisher; Yale's
Dean Kackley, May, and Denvir
all are top sprinters. Jamison went
:21.9 against Santa Clara, May hit
: 22.0 last week.
200 Individual Medley: John
Ferris, a basket-weaving major
from Sacramento, is a great
crowd-pleaser. This is probably

because he is a damn fast
swimmer. Stanford's leading
barbarian ranks third in the IM
nationally with 1:57.4. Teammate
Dave Shilling ranks eighth in the
same event, with a 1:59.7. The
two could well sweep this event
against Yale's Brad McKean
(4:03.0), Ben Clark, or Kasting.
Diving: The Indian diving
tandem of Bill Main and Ted
Nichols which is undefeated this
season, is not likely to be beaten
tomorrow. One-two finishes for
Stanford in both the 1-meter and
3-meter diving could be the
deciding factor in the meet.
Lacking depth, Yale will go with
sophomore Rick Kincade; even
Rev. Coffin has been working on a
double twist off the high board.
200 Butterfly: John Ferris'
only loss last year was at the
hands of Yale's Paul Katz. Ferris
currently leads the nation in this
event, with a 1:55.1; Katz took
second place last week to a Navy
swimmer, turning in 2:00.4.
Hopefully, Stanford's Mike
Masarie will make his butterfly
debut tomorrow, after sitting out
the first half of this season with a

broken collarbone. A race
between Ferris, Katz, Masarie, and
Rich Guelff, Yale's fine backup
man, would pit four fine
butterfliers in one of the
afternoon's highlights.
100 Freestyle: Jamison ranks
eighth nationally in this event,
with a :47.8 clocking; Eagleston
and Bebb have both gone
best-times of :47.6 or better. Bill
Goerlich, May, Cadden, Kasting,
and Denvir have all posted
clockings of :48.6 or better.
Another fun race for the judges to
pick.
20 0 It acksl r n k e : Fred
Haywood, Stanford captain, has
an amusing way of relieving
tension by taking false starts, a
rarity in backstroke competition.
He also amused Indiana's Charlie
Hickox last year by winning this
event in the NCAA's, and
currently ranks fourth nationally,
with 1 :58.0. Ed Bettendorf, who
beat Haywood last year at New
Haven, has a lifetime best of
1:57.5 (Haywood's is 1:56.8), last
week went 2:00.6 against Navy.

Stanford's second man, Rob
Wolley, will face either Chuck
Goetschhe, Ben Clark, or Kelly
Falloon.
50 0 Freestyle: See
1000-Freestyle. Berk ranks ninth
nationally with 4 :51.9; Nelson hit
4:54.4 against Navy, 14 seconds
slower than his lifetime best.
200-yd. Breaststroke: Dave
Shilling has been getting
second-place publicity to frosh
phenom Brian Job; this weekend,
he is likely to be the focus of a bit
more attention. Last year's NCAA
runner-up will meet Yale's
Olympian Phil Long. Jim Morris
could be another key figure—his
2:17.4 lifetime best is two
seconds faster than that of his
Yale counterpart Tim Fretthold,
who hit 2:25.5 against Navy.
40 0 yd. Free Relay:
Speculation is great that this race
will be the deciding event. Entries
for both teams will depend on the
individual performances in
proceding events. A possible
Stanford team of Jamison,
Haywood, Bebb and Eagelston; a
possible Yale rival squad of
Denvir, May, Cadden, and Kasting
or Kackley.
All apologies to Rev. Coffin,
but it should be a hell of a meet.


THE DIFFERENCE? Sophomore Ineaststroke ace Dave Shilling, second ranked
nationally in the 200-yd. event, tvill be an important factor in tomorrow's big
meet against Vale.


COACHKS: Stanford's Jim (<aughran
(above) and Yale's Phil Moriarty lead
their s(|iiads into tomorrow's meet at
Kngina Fools, (iaughran is in his ten(li
season as mentor here, with one
national championship, in I 967, to his
credit. Moriarty has coached the
Bulldogs to eight of Ihe past ten
Kastern Intercollegiate Swim League
titles. Tickets for the meet are still
available to anvone who can fork up
$3.

It's Yale week at Stanford.
Sunday morning, Rev. William
Sloane Coffin speaks at Mem Chu,
and tomorrow afternoon the
Stanford Indians and the Yale Elis
go at it in Encina Pool at 2 p.m.,
before an expected sellout crowd
of 1700 biased swimming fans.
Stanford, the third-ranked
team in the nation, currently
sports a 38-4-1 dual meet record.
One of the four losses was to
Yale, when the two teams met for
the first time, last year in New
Haven.
This year, Yale is the visitor,
and the Stanford "barbarians" (as
they are fondly known to their Eli
competitors) are hoping for top
performances and cold
weather—Yale swims in an indoor
pool in New Haven, and is
concerned (among other things)
with the distance from Encina
pool to a nice, warm shower.
Assuming the delicate Elis manage
to keep warm, the meet between
fifth-ranked Yale, and Stanford,
should be one of the best in the
country this season.

Following is a capsule
summary of tomorrow's events,
and the personalities who will
figure prominently in them.
400-yd. Medley Relay: The
event which Coach Jim Gaughran
feels "may be a decider," finds
the Stanford team of Fred
Haywood, John Ferris, Brian Job
and Steve Carey second-ranked
nationally. Freshmen Job and
Carey (ineligible due to Ivy
League rules) will be watching
teammates Dave Shilling and one
of a trio of top Stanford
sprinters —Bob Jamison, Rick
Eagleston, or Bob Bebb in a
struggle of the titans; Yale's relay
team could include three of their
finest strokesmen- Ed Bettendorf,
Paul Katz, and Phil Long—as well
as any of their top sprinters,
possibly Jim Denvir, Bob Kasting,
or Rich May.
