# Pigs Catch Dogs
## 
### 
Santa Clara County Animal Control officers
rounded up about 15 stray dogs on campus
yesterday, and took them to the county Humane
Society pound in Santa Clara. Three of the dogs
had been reclaimed as of press time. The health
officers came on campus as a result of a
complaint by a Tresidder cafeteria employee,
according to county officials. The Dean of
Students office reportedly will help "bail out"
dogs if the owners request aid.
