# New Moratorium Argues Tactics
## 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
After four meetings and two weeks, Stanford's "New Moratorium"
has yet to clearly define its basic tactics and strategy. Even so, the
group has finally begun to plan specific activities that they hope will
accomplish their stated goal: eliminate ROTC in its entirety from
Stanford University.
Whether they will succeed in mobilizing the Stanford community in
as massive a way as they envision may depend on the tactics they
finally settle on. For the moment, the New Moratorium has set out to
"educate" the campus about ROTC and Stanford's general
involvement in the U.S. war machine. But how long the New
Moratorium will remain content with the tactics of persuasion is
highly questionable. The members many of whom led last year's April
Third Movement, seem generally agreed upon the eventual need for
mass action, possibly in the form of civil disobedience, if they are to
succeed in forcing ROTC off campus.
The meetings contain constant references , both vieled and open
to the tactics of last year's movement. Indeed, when one meeting
became dominated with inspired talk of strikes, shutdowns, and force,
one member was moved to comment ironically, "This sounds like the
sort of thing an army is wreak destruction."
Many have viewed the group's ban on radio and photographic
coverage as a manifestation of their intention to use illegal tactics.
Their justification for the limited press ban was that pictures and tape
recordings could be used to convict New Moratorium members of
conspiracy charges if the meetings resulted in any actions that were
even "mildly illegal"). But at one meeting A3M veteran Lenny Siegel
protested, "We ought to stop pretending to ourselves that we are
going to seize state power tomorrow."
Still, there is talk of coercive tactics. English professor
Bruce Franklin has said mor| than once that the group must "shut
down the University to affect its will." With shutting down the

University, many New Moratorium members envisage goals which
involve much more than ROTC. "Our goal is to stop Stanford
University from any complicity with U.S. militarism." said one
member at the second meeting. The implications of that goal involve a
myriad of issues which the New Moratorium will presumably embrace
in the coming months.
In addition to the immediate elimination of ROTC, their policy
statement demands, "All war research must be discontinued. On
campus recruiting by defense firms must stop. Faculty consulting for
defense companies must end. No more war contractors can be
permitted to build on Stanford land. Stanford University must
publicly denounce the War and the inflation it has caused and stop
making its workers pay for the University's attempt to accomodate
itself to the overheated war economy.

News Analysis

The above goals are not likely to be realized through the established
governmental processes of the University. The New Moratorium
knows this well.
To implement their goals, many have in mind a resurrection of the
old Moratorium strategy of an expanding series of days each month in
which there is no "business as usual." It is for this reason, and to give
itself an air of respectability and acceptance which it would not
otherwise have, that the group appropriated for itself the name of the
Moratorium.
As Bruce Franklin, .Janet Weiss, and a number of other members
would have it, the New Moratorium would pick up where the Vietnam
Moratorium left off, with a five day program in February, six days in
March, etc. The difference is that the New Moratorium conceives of
"no business as usual" as a forcible strike where the University is shut
down for the specified number days.
Many hope that the Stanford workers could be united with the
students and faculty in this effort. There are some who even feel that
the workers, and their "exploitation" should be the main focus of the
group's efforts. "We tend to forget," said Weiss last week, "that there
are 7,000 workers on this campus, and they are what keeps the
University going."
There were numerous proposals that the New Moratorium take an
active stand in the General Electric strike and make firm demands
regarding the wages, hiring, and firing of workers at Stanford.
However, the workers have quietly receded in the New
Moratorium's plans as the focus has more and more centered on
mobilizing the students. For the moment, the group has adopted the
logic of a member who recently complained, "I don't like the coercive
tone of some people here. Not concentrating 100 percent on workers
has become a negative test of your revolutionary ardor. We have to
realize that demands about hiring and firing of workers are not going
to mobilize students."

The crucial problem for the New Moratorium is to find the kinds of
activities that will mobilize students, that will, in Michael Sweeney's
words, enable people "to make the connection emotionally between
the war and ROTC."
Much attention is now being given to organizing the dorms. Films
on the Army and the war are being shown in various lounges and
discussions are being organized. A special issue of Chaparral is being
prepared which will, members hope, educate the Stanford community
about the true nature of ROTC. Petitions are being circulated with the
purpose of demonstrating how massive the sentiment is for an end to
ROTC at Stanford.
The major efforts at mobilizing the students will be concentrated in
"Liberation Week," which will begin Feb. 16. Various activities have
been suggested for that week, ranging from classes in guerilla methods
and tours of all ROTC facilities on campus (whether they can be
arranged legally or not) to "skirmishes with oppressive forces on
campus."
"Liberation Week" may well be the first tangible display of force
and coercion by the New Moratorium. Members agree that they
should "make it very difficult to function that week," and seem
determined to tour all ROTC facilities on campus regardless of
whether permission is granted.
Though no activities have been definitely planned yet, there
remains the possibility of eventual confrontation.
Said Siegel at the last meeting, "We are going to have to enforce our
own orders. This may be a long way off, but it is a possibility. Perhaps
even the threat of it will force them to deal with ROTC."
Perhaps. But perhaps also the Stanford community has had enough
confrontation politics for a few years. There is a serious question as to
whether there is anything the New Moratorium can do to mobilize the
Stanford community into supporting their postition actively. Many
student leaders sense a kind of battle fatigue amongst the general
student body, a "burned out" feeling resulting from the intense
movements of last year: the April Third Movement in the spring, the
Vietnam Moratorium in the fall.
Is this feeling of "battle fatigue" amongst the students real or
illuseory? Do students want ROTC off campus; do they even care one
way or the other? If they do want an end to ROTC, are they willing
to buy the tactics of confrontation and coercion?
In the answers to these questions lies the future of the New
Moratorium. If students are as unconcerned about the recent ROTC
decision as they seem then there is probably little that the New
Moratorium can do to mobilize them. But then again, history has
shown that they may not need to be mobilized for the New
Moratorium's purposes: confrontation and coercion do not require
large numbers.
There is no one who can definitively determine the mood on the
campus today. Only time will tell whether Kenneth Pitzer, the New
Moratorium or neither has judged the mood of students correctly.
