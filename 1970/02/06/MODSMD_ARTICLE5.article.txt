# No ROTC Contracts Until Council Votes
## 
### 
President Kenneth S. Pitzer
told the faculty Senate yesterday
that no new contract would be
signed with Army ROTC while a
potential review of the recent
ROTC decision is pending.
If the Senate action is upheld,
the new program will go into
effect next September, according
to Pitzer.
Wednesday the Daily reported
that over 100 signatures had
already been collected on a

faculty petition asking a review of
the Senate decision by the entire
Academic Council.
Academic Secretary, Professor
Donald Winbigler, said that no
petition has yet been filed
although he expects it later. "I do
not expect it to be filed until
shortly before the expiration of
the three week period," Winbigler
declared. The three week period
will expire in one week.
Several individual senators,
including those from both the
minority and majority on the
ROTC question, have indicated
that if a petition is filed by more
than 50 faculty members, they
will ask that the issue be
submitted to a mail ballot of the
entire faculty after the Council
meeting.
The purpose, according to
Professor G.L. Bach, economics, is
to avoid a lengthy procedural
debate at the Academic Council
meeting, focus discussion on the
key questions, and assure that all
faculty members have an
opportunity to vote on the central
issue.
