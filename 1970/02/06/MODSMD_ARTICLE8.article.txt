# Dear Mom
## Nixon, Underwear, And French 
### Cissi Bonini 
Dear Mom,
I am afflicted with P. K.
(Plump Knee) which fortunately
affects only one K. (Knee) My
bellbottoms are bell-middles And
my whole future is grim. Have
you a suggestion?
P. K.
Coffee House
Dear P. K.,
Every adversity can be turned
to an advantage. Richard Nixon is
living proof of this. (His
administration reflects the theory
that the nation's adversity can be
turned to personal advantage.)
Anyhow—you should aim for a
government career in diplomatic
circles. They have lots of teas and
you'll be able to balance things on
your knees, thus checking any
tendency to drop. After all,
checks and balances are the basis
of our government.
Diplomatically, Mom
Dear Mom,
My husband has become an
ardent Liberation advocate.
I don't mind his going without
underwear and carrying "A Man's
Place is in the Home" placards.
But economically, we're pinched
since he quit working. He says
he's been cast in a role as

wage-earner and that his real
creativity is being squelched. He
tats and watches "How the World
Turns". What shall I do?
Worried
Escondido Village
Dear Worried,
Real innovaters are never
appreciated. Hooray for your
husband! Men havebeen taken too
seriously for too long and it's a
burden for them. In graduate
school, for example, we are
inclined to believe men are there
to prepare for a career rather than
to meet interesting women.
(Which is of course the main
motive.) And —too often—we
listen to what they say rather than
admiring their dimples and
eyelashes. (Politicians excepted,
of course.)
The new hair styles and
clothing indicate that men are
waging a desperate battle to be
taken foolishly! It is our duty as
wives and mothers to treat them
with the condescension which is
their due!
For a starter, I suggest that you
laugh hysterically when your
husband discusses his career plans.
Little personal remarks such as,
"You're not really serious about
teaching?" or "With your

sex-appeal, law school is a
dead-end," are helpful. Or, "What
is a good-looking fellow like you
doing in medical school?" All of
these little loving touches boost
the ego. It's the least we can do
for our loved ones.
Patronizingly yours,
Mom
Dear Mom,
The French department
requires the translation of two
French documents to fulfill the
Ph.D. language requirement. I
brought in two Menus, and they
refused to accept them. (It was a
first-rate restaurant, too!)
Furieuse
Ph.D. candidate
Chere Furieuse,
The menus fulfill the B. A.
requirement (Bon Appetit), but
not the Ph.D. requirement.
Here are some French
expressions for you to practice:
S'il vous plait —not real silver
Pardonnez moi - the dog food is
on me.
Sang Froid - Song of Freud (an
epic poem—the national epic
poem of France)
Bon Voyage - a voyage to
Bonne, Germany.
Bonne Chance,

Dear Mom,
The French department
requires the translation of two
French documents to fulfill the
Ph.D. language requirement. I
brought in two Menus, and they
refused to accept them. (It was a
first-rate restaurant, too!)
Furieuse
Ph.D. candidate
Chere Furieuse,
The menus fulfill the B. A.
requirement (Bon Appetit), but
not the Ph.D. requirement.
Here are some French
expressions for you to practice:
S'il vous plait —not real silver
Pardonnez moi - the dog food is
on me.
Sang Froid - Song of Freud (an
epic poem—the national epic
poem of France)
Bon Voyage - a voyage to
Bonne, Germany.
Bonne Chance,
Mom
Dear Mom,
I am afflicted with P. K.
(Plump Knee) which fortunately
affects only one K. (Knee) My
bellbottoms are bell-middles And
my whole future is grim. Have
you a suggestion?
P. K.

Dear P. K.,
Every adversity can be turned
to an advantage. Richard Nixon is
living proof of this. (His
administration reflects the theory
that the nation's adversity can be
turned to personal advantage.)
Anyhow—you should aim for a
government career in diplomatic
circles. They have lots of teas and
you'll be able to balance things on
your knees, thus checking any
tendency to drop. After all,
checks and balances are the basis
of our government.
Diplomatically, Mom
Dear Mom,
My husband has become an
ardent Liberation advocate.
I don't mind his going without
underwear and carrying "A Man's
Place is in the Home" placards.
But economically, we're pinched
since he quit working. He says
he's been cast in a role as

wage-earner and that his real
creativity is being squelched. He
tats and watches "How the World
Turns". What shall I do?
Worried
Escondido Village
Dear Worried,
Real innovaters are never
appreciated. Hooray for your
husband! Men havebeen taken too
seriously for too long and it's a
burden for them. In graduate
school, for example, we are
inclined to believe men are there
to prepare for a career rather than
to meet interesting women.
(Which is of course the main
motive.) And —too often—we
listen to what they say rather than
admiring their dimples and
eyelashes. (Politicians excepted,
of course.)
The new hair styles and
clothing indicate that men are
waging a desperate battle to be
taken foolishly! It is our duty as
wives and mothers to treat them
with the condescension which is
their due!
For a starter, I suggest that you
laugh hysterically when your
husband discusses his career plans.
Little personal remarks such as,
"You're not really serious about
teaching?" or "With your

sex-appeal, law school is a
dead-end," are helpful. Or, "What
is a good-looking fellow like you
doing in medical school?" All of
these little loving touches boost
the ego. It's the least we can do
for our loved ones.
