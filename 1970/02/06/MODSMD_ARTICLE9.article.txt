# War And Fascism
## Beyond A Political 
### Tom Peterson 
It is extremely attractive being
a political "liberal." One leels that
he is rational, pragmatic and
progressive. The methods are also
very appealing in so far as one can
continue his education, believing
that education will ultimately
solve all the social problems. Alter
graduating, one can continue his
goal-oriented life without much
disruption. One might join a
business firm, vowing eventually
to be in a position to do
something about enforcing equal
hiring practices and seeing that his
company does not contribute
''substantially'' to the
environmental pollution. Or one
can become a teacher since
obviously education will solve
everything. Or one might become
a doctor vowing to spend a certain
amount of time working with the
poor etc.
At the outset, let me clarify
that these are admirable goals
which should be pursued and
which in time may make the
world more humane. The question
I want to explore, however, is
whether or not it is enough to be
a "liberal." To answer this
question I suggest that several
paradoxes be examined:
-—In 1954 the Supreme Court's
desegration rulings were thought
to be the panacea to stop white
racism and to help improve the

condition of the blacks in this
country; Today, white racism is
more powerful than ever and
blacks who are living in the
ghettoes and in the shacks in
Mississippi do not have a better
life.
—The U.S. government (with
Stanford's concurrence) maintains
that Army, Navy and Air Force
ROTC units are vital for the
"defense of freedom;" But it has
been disclosed that the Army
operates a secret police which
investigates such civilian groups as
the "liberal" (hardly "radical")
Clergy and Laymen Concerned
about Vietnam and even certain
university organizations.
Military •Industrial Complex
-—President Nixon claims that
he had to veto the Health,
Education and Welfare bill
because it is inflationary ; Yet, he
insists that we continue the highly
dubious ABM system which will
run to the billions. (Of course, it
is supported by the
Military-Industrial Complex, while
only the poor have anything to
gain from the HEW bill.)
-—There is a concensus that
Vietnam was a "mistake" and that
the pullout of American troops is
irreversable; Yet there is more
concern about saving "face" than
lives (American and Vietnamese).
This list could be enlarged

easily. Is it enough to be a
political "liberal?" Or is it
necessary to add to our long range
"liberal" goals a "radical" concern
in the present? Twenty eight
Panthers have been killed in the
last two years and their leadership
is mostly in prison. If we do
nothing now we are helping those
who are suppressing them. How
else can one interpret J. E.
Hoover's statement to Congress
that the FBI helps the local police
to . .take preventive measures
to forestall acts of violence" than
to mean that a "preventive war" is
being waged against the Panthers?
Assassination In lied
Pastor Martin Niemoller
believes that Nazism might have
been stopped if the Germans had
resisted the extermination of the
Communists instead of doing
nothing until their own groups
were threatened. Doesn't Fred
Hampton's assassination in bed
threaten all of us and all of our
liberal ideals? Will we allow the
police to continue to serve "as
investigators, judges, juries and
executioners" as Harvey Cox has
analyzed it? Shouldn't the
communities control the police?
Is this the real reason that the
police have such a dislike for the
Panthers?
There are many other
disturbing signs of growing
Fascism in the United States.
Wiretapping and bugging have
increased. The police can now
bust down doors to houses on the
mere "suspicion" that there are
drugs inside. Ask yourselves who
this is likely to be used against.

Look at the Supreme Court
appointees and ask yourselves
whether this institution will long
remain the bullwork against the
invasion of individual rights.
Examine the previous records of
the three top men in the justice
department — Mitchell,
Kleindienst, and Leonard.
William L. Shirer, author of
Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,
declares that America "may be
the first country to go fascist
democratically." What is
preventing us from speaking out
more forceably? Lack of
knowledge? Apathy? Fear? Maybe
our "liberal" hopes won't be
worth very much if we don't take
action now!

this is likely to be used against.

Look at the Supreme Court
appointees and ask yourselves
whether this institution will long
remain the bullwork against the
invasion of individual rights.
Examine the previous records of
the three top men in the justice
department — Mitchell,
Kleindienst, and Leonard.
William L. Shirer, author of
Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,
declares that America "may be
the first country to go fascist
democratically." What is
preventing us from speaking out
more forceably? Lack of
knowledge? Apathy? Fear? Maybe
our "liberal" hopes won't be
worth very much if we don't take
action now!
(Tom Peterson is a grad student
in religious studies and also a
member of The Stanford
Community Against War &
Fascism).
It is extremely attractive being
a political "liberal." One leels that
he is rational, pragmatic and
progressive. The methods are also
very appealing in so far as one can
continue his education, believing
that education will ultimately
solve all the social problems. Alter
graduating, one can continue his
goal-oriented life without much
disruption. One might join a
business firm, vowing eventually
to be in a position to do
something about enforcing equal
hiring practices and seeing that his
company does not contribute
''substantially'' to the
environmental pollution. Or one
can become a teacher since
obviously education will solve
everything. Or one might become
a doctor vowing to spend a certain
amount of time working with the
poor etc.
At the outset, let me clarify
that these are admirable goals
which should be pursued and
which in time may make the
world more humane. The question
I want to explore, however, is
whether or not it is enough to be
a "liberal." To answer this
question I suggest that several
paradoxes be examined:
-—In 1954 the Supreme Court's
desegration rulings were thought
to be the panacea to stop white
racism and to help improve the

condition of the blacks in this
country; Today, white racism is
more powerful than ever and
blacks who are living in the
ghettoes and in the shacks in
Mississippi do not have a better
life.
—The U.S. government (with
Stanford's concurrence) maintains
that Army, Navy and Air Force
ROTC units are vital for the
"defense of freedom;" But it has
been disclosed that the Army
operates a secret police which
investigates such civilian groups as
the "liberal" (hardly "radical")
Clergy and Laymen Concerned
about Vietnam and even certain
university organizations.
Military •Industrial Complex
-—President Nixon claims that
he had to veto the Health,
Education and Welfare bill
because it is inflationary ; Yet, he
insists that we continue the highly
dubious ABM system which will
run to the billions. (Of course, it
is supported by the
Military-Industrial Complex, while
only the poor have anything to
gain from the HEW bill.)
-—There is a concensus that
Vietnam was a "mistake" and that
the pullout of American troops is
irreversable; Yet there is more
concern about saving "face" than
lives (American and Vietnamese).
This list could be enlarged

easily. Is it enough to be a
political "liberal?" Or is it
necessary to add to our long range
"liberal" goals a "radical" concern
in the present? Twenty eight
Panthers have been killed in the
last two years and their leadership
is mostly in prison. If we do
nothing now we are helping those
who are suppressing them. How
else can one interpret J. E.
Hoover's statement to Congress
that the FBI helps the local police
to . .take preventive measures
to forestall acts of violence" than
to mean that a "preventive war" is
being waged against the Panthers?
Assassination In lied
Pastor Martin Niemoller
believes that Nazism might have
been stopped if the Germans had
resisted the extermination of the
Communists instead of doing
nothing until their own groups
were threatened. Doesn't Fred
Hampton's assassination in bed
threaten all of us and all of our
liberal ideals? Will we allow the
police to continue to serve "as
investigators, judges, juries and
executioners" as Harvey Cox has
analyzed it? Shouldn't the
communities control the police?
Is this the real reason that the
police have such a dislike for the
Panthers?
There are many other
disturbing signs of growing
Fascism in the United States.
Wiretapping and bugging have
increased. The police can now
bust down doors to houses on the
mere "suspicion" that there are
drugs inside. Ask yourselves who
this is likely to be used against.

believes that Nazism might have
been stopped if the Germans had
resisted the extermination of the
Communists instead of doing
nothing until their own groups
were threatened. Doesn't Fred
Hampton's assassination in bed
threaten all of us and all of our
liberal ideals? Will we allow the
police to continue to serve "as
investigators, judges, juries and
executioners" as Harvey Cox has
analyzed it? Shouldn't the
communities control the police?
Is this the real reason that the
police have such a dislike for the
Panthers?
There are many other
disturbing signs of growing
Fascism in the United States.
Wiretapping and bugging have
increased. The police can now
bust down doors to houses on the
mere "suspicion" that there are
drugs inside. Ask yourselves who
this is likely to be used against.

Look at the Supreme Court
appointees and ask yourselves
whether this institution will long
remain the bullwork against the
invasion of individual rights.
Examine the previous records of
the three top men in the justice
department — Mitchell,
Kleindienst, and Leonard.
William L. Shirer, author of
Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,
declares that America "may be
the first country to go fascist
democratically." What is
preventing us from speaking out
more forceably? Lack of
knowledge? Apathy? Fear? Maybe
our "liberal" hopes won't be
worth very much if we don't take
action now!
