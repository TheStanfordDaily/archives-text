Friends of the environment today are recalling the fact
that on February 9, 1870, President Ulysees S. Grant took
the first tentative step towards protecting the environment
by signing a bill establishing the meterological office.
So, if you want to report any unusual environmental

Roots or Dillingham) call the business office at 327-4150.
