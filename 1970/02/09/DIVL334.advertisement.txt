OH BOY!
"Get right in there and do it boys."—Knute j
Rockne or I.ady Chatterly.
"Almost all men, in all ages and countries,
have at times made use of prayer. Thence j
I reasoned, that, if all things were ordained, I
prayer must among the rest be ordained.
But, as prayer can procure no change in
things ordained, praying must be useless, 1
and an absudity. God would therefore, not j
ordain praying, if everything else was or '
daincd. But praying exists, therefore all
things are not ordained tic." Benjamin
Franklin.
To triumph in love need not be less comlex'
than to triumph in war.
To lose at love is certainly as devastating at |
Insing at war.
