# Chaplain Defends Dissent
## Coffin : â€˜Social Morality Dominant' 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
William Sloane Coffin, chaplain
at Yale who spoke in the Chapel
yesterday, is sure of himself and
his convictions. Yet in an
interview he emerges a warm man,
particularly interested in students,
an.d a man who both thinks and
ar.oi.
For instance he wasn't
surprised when he was indicted
along with Dr. Benjamin Spock
for conspiracy to stop the draft.
"I thought we were crowding the
government very hard. I had no
objection to the indictment; my
oL.ection was to the nature of the
indictment, that is, being charged
with conspiracy rather than direct
violations of the draft law.
"That would have allowed us to
challenge the constitutionality of
the draft law. I figured that there
was a possibility that we had the
C nstitution as well as our
consciences of our side. But we
never got a chance to argue the
constitutionality of the draft, or
the undeclared war, or the rules of
war," he said.
His bitterness lay not in his
mistrial, but in the government's
rf_. usal to allow constitutional
tests. "The terrible thing is that
it's so difficult to test laws in this
country. You can't test the

constitutionality of this
undeclared war or the draft
without risking five years in jail.
"You can only sue the
government for loss of property,
not loss of life," Coffin
concluded.
One Important Difference
He sees his role of chaplain as
similar to the one of 30 year's
past yet with one important
difference. He claims, "The real
difference is that social, as
opposed to private, issues have so
invaded the privacy of every
individual life that many campus
chaplains feel to ignore them is to
ignore a very important part of
one's humanity.
"It is often said that campus
chaplains are much more political
than they used to be, but I think
that that is just an inevitable
development of the times, when
social morality has become the
dominant issue over personal
morality.
"Most students today feel that
personal morality has been
confirmed at the expense of social
morality. How can one be
concerned with the question of
free love and so indifferent to the
question of free hate?"
The Prophetic Minority
Coffin doesn't think that social

morality is contained in the silent
majority. He states that "in
opposition to the belief of our
beloved leader, the prophetic
minority has more to say to a
nation than a silent majority."
He believes that both the
student and the campus chaplain
can be a part of this minority: "I
think that the college chaplain is
freer to go out on a limb on a
controversial issue than the guy in
the parish, who can't for fear of
leaving all his parishioners behind
him. And therefore those of us in
the campus ministry have a
peculiar obligation to go out on a
limb."
"Every Christian has to take
seriously the lesson of Jesus,
namely that he was executed at
age 33. And those of us who have

survived age 33 perhaps ought to
reexamine our positions," he says.
Controversial Christian
Coffin claims that most
students have little interest in
organized religion, not so much
for intellectual reasons as for
ethical reasons. "Students
properly discern that
'controversial Christian' is
redundant, and according to that
perception the average parish
church comes off badly.
"On the other hand they're a
deeply religious crowd in the
sense that they understand that
there are certain truths that
cannot be comprehended but have
to be apprehended at a deeper
level than the mind can
comprehend."

According to Coffin, there is a
broadening of minds abroad: "I'm
impressed by the quality of the
students, who are intellectually
curious. They tend to have strong
ethical impulse and are willing to
go beyond the scientific method.
Not Knocking Scientific Method
"I don't want to knock the
scientific method; I mean to
discount it, not discard it as a
serious route to human wisdom.
The number of students willing to
recognize it and go beyond it is
impressive."
Coffin had never really
intended to go into the campus
ministry: it was the first job that
came along after divinity school.
Originally, he was waiting to find
a parish.
Who goes into the campus

ministry nowadays? "The best
analogy is with the Middle Ages
when young firebrands were
siphoned off from the seats of
power into the orders: the
Franciscians, the Benedictine
order, the Jesuits, and so forth. I
suppose the equivalent of the
orders today would be the campus
ministry," he replies.
He sees a decline in the
denominational ministries to
college students, which he feels is
healthy. "I think basically the
decline reflects an understanding
that the purity of doctrine is not
as important as the integrity of
love. This country has been overly
concerned with doctrinal
differences at the expense of the
integrity of love. So it's basically a
rather healthy development."

difference is that social, as
opposed to private, issues have so
invaded the privacy of every
individual life that many campus
chaplains feel to ignore them is to
ignore a very important part of
one's humanity.
"It is often said that campus
chaplains are much more political
than they used to be, but I think
that that is just an inevitable
development of the times, when
social morality has become the
dominant issue over personal
morality.
"Most students today feel that
personal morality has been
confirmed at the expense of social
morality. How can one be
concerned with the question of
free love and so indifferent to the
question of free hate?"
The Prophetic Minority
Coffin doesn't think that social

morality is contained in the silent
majority. He states that "in
opposition to the belief of our
beloved leader, the prophetic
minority has more to say to a
nation than a silent majority."
He believes that both the
student and the campus chaplain
can be a part of this minority: "I
think that the college chaplain is
freer to go out on a limb on a
controversial issue than the guy in
the parish, who can't for fear of
leaving all his parishioners behind
him. And therefore those of us in
the campus ministry have a
peculiar obligation to go out on a
limb."
"Every Christian has to take
seriously the lesson of Jesus,
namely that he was executed at
age 33. And those of us who have

survived age 33 perhaps ought to
reexamine our positions," he says.
Controversial Christian
Coffin claims that most
students have little interest in
organized religion, not so much
for intellectual reasons as for
ethical reasons. "Students
properly discern that
'controversial Christian' is
redundant, and according to that
perception the average parish
church comes off badly.
"On the other hand they're a
deeply religious crowd in the
sense that they understand that
there are certain truths that
cannot be comprehended but have
to be apprehended at a deeper
level than the mind can
comprehend."

According to Coffin, there is a
broadening of minds abroad: "I'm
impressed by the quality of the
students, who are intellectually
curious. They tend to have strong
ethical impulse and are willing to
go beyond the scientific method.
Not Knocking Scientific Method
"I don't want to knock the
scientific method; I mean to
discount it, not discard it as a
serious route to human wisdom.
The number of students willing to
recognize it and go beyond it is
impressive."
Coffin had never really
intended to go into the campus
ministry: it was the first job that
came along after divinity school.
Originally, he was waiting to find
a parish.
Who goes into the campus

ministry nowadays? "The best
analogy is with the Middle Ages
when young firebrands were
siphoned off from the seats of
power into the orders: the
Franciscians, the Benedictine
order, the Jesuits, and so forth. I
suppose the equivalent of the
orders today would be the campus
ministry," he replies.
He sees a decline in the
denominational ministries to
college students, which he feels is
healthy. "I think basically the
decline reflects an understanding
that the purity of doctrine is not
as important as the integrity of
love. This country has been overly
concerned with doctrinal
differences at the expense of the
integrity of love. So it's basically a
rather healthy development."


WILLIAM SLOANE COFFIN
William Sloane Coffin, chaplain
at Yale who spoke in the Chapel
yesterday, is sure of himself and
his convictions. Yet in an
interview he emerges a warm man,
particularly interested in students,
an.d a man who both thinks and
ar.oi.
For instance he wasn't
surprised when he was indicted
along with Dr. Benjamin Spock
for conspiracy to stop the draft.
"I thought we were crowding the
government very hard. I had no
objection to the indictment; my
oL.ection was to the nature of the
indictment, that is, being charged
with conspiracy rather than direct
violations of the draft law.
"That would have allowed us to
challenge the constitutionality of
the draft law. I figured that there
was a possibility that we had the
C nstitution as well as our
consciences of our side. But we
never got a chance to argue the
constitutionality of the draft, or
the undeclared war, or the rules of
war," he said.
His bitterness lay not in his
mistrial, but in the government's
rf_. usal to allow constitutional
tests. "The terrible thing is that
it's so difficult to test laws in this
country. You can't test the

constitutionality of this
undeclared war or the draft
without risking five years in jail.
"You can only sue the
government for loss of property,
not loss of life," Coffin
concluded.

past yet with one important

for intellectual reasons as for
ethical reasons. "Students
properly discern that
'controversial Christian' is
redundant, and according to that
perception the average parish
church comes off badly.
"On the other hand they're a
deeply religious crowd in the
sense that they understand that
there are certain truths that
cannot be comprehended but have
to be apprehended at a deeper
level than the mind can
comprehend."

According to Coffin, there is a
broadening of minds abroad: "I'm
impressed by the quality of the
students, who are intellectually
curious. They tend to have strong
ethical impulse and are willing to
go beyond the scientific method.
Not Knocking Scientific Method
"I don't want to knock the
scientific method; I mean to
discount it, not discard it as a
serious route to human wisdom.
The number of students willing to
recognize it and go beyond it is
impressive."
Coffin had never really
intended to go into the campus
ministry: it was the first job that
came along after divinity school.
Originally, he was waiting to find
a parish.
Who goes into the campus

ministry nowadays? "The best
analogy is with the Middle Ages
when young firebrands were
siphoned off from the seats of
power into the orders: the
Franciscians, the Benedictine
order, the Jesuits, and so forth. I
suppose the equivalent of the
orders today would be the campus
ministry," he replies.
He sees a decline in the
denominational ministries to
college students, which he feels is
healthy. "I think basically the
decline reflects an understanding
that the purity of doctrine is not
as important as the integrity of
love. This country has been overly
concerned with doctrinal
differences at the expense of the
integrity of love. So it's basically a
rather healthy development."


WILLIAM SLOANE COFFIN
William Sloane Coffin, chaplain
at Yale who spoke in the Chapel
yesterday, is sure of himself and
his convictions. Yet in an
interview he emerges a warm man,
particularly interested in students,
an.d a man who both thinks and
ar.oi.
For instance he wasn't
surprised when he was indicted
along with Dr. Benjamin Spock
for conspiracy to stop the draft.
"I thought we were crowding the
government very hard. I had no
objection to the indictment; my
oL.ection was to the nature of the
indictment, that is, being charged
with conspiracy rather than direct
violations of the draft law.
"That would have allowed us to
challenge the constitutionality of
the draft law. I figured that there
was a possibility that we had the
C nstitution as well as our
consciences of our side. But we
never got a chance to argue the
constitutionality of the draft, or
the undeclared war, or the rules of
war," he said.
His bitterness lay not in his
mistrial, but in the government's
rf_. usal to allow constitutional
tests. "The terrible thing is that
it's so difficult to test laws in this
country. You can't test the

constitutionality of this
undeclared war or the draft
without risking five years in jail.
"You can only sue the
government for loss of property,
not loss of life," Coffin
concluded.
One Important Difference
He sees his role of chaplain as
similar to the one of 30 year's
past yet with one important
difference. He claims, "The real
difference is that social, as
opposed to private, issues have so
invaded the privacy of every
individual life that many campus
chaplains feel to ignore them is to
ignore a very important part of
one's humanity.
"It is often said that campus
chaplains are much more political
than they used to be, but I think
that that is just an inevitable
development of the times, when
social morality has become the
dominant issue over personal
morality.
"Most students today feel that
personal morality has been
confirmed at the expense of social
morality. How can one be
concerned with the question of
free love and so indifferent to the
question of free hate?"
The Prophetic Minority
Coffin doesn't think that social

morality is contained in the silent
majority. He states that "in
opposition to the belief of our
beloved leader, the prophetic
minority has more to say to a
nation than a silent majority."
He believes that both the
student and the campus chaplain
can be a part of this minority: "I
think that the college chaplain is
freer to go out on a limb on a
controversial issue than the guy in
the parish, who can't for fear of
leaving all his parishioners behind
him. And therefore those of us in
the campus ministry have a
peculiar obligation to go out on a
limb."
"Every Christian has to take
seriously the lesson of Jesus,
namely that he was executed at
age 33. And those of us who have

survived age 33 perhaps ought to
reexamine our positions," he says.
Controversial Christian
Coffin claims that most
students have little interest in
organized religion, not so much
for intellectual reasons as for
ethical reasons. "Students
properly discern that
'controversial Christian' is
redundant, and according to that
perception the average parish
church comes off badly.
"On the other hand they're a
deeply religious crowd in the
sense that they understand that
there are certain truths that
cannot be comprehended but have
to be apprehended at a deeper
level than the mind can
comprehend."
