## More On Overseas Campuses

Images Broken
Editor, THE DAILY:
I lived for some years close to
the English campus at Cliveden
and read with great interest Miss
Emma Price's letter about the
problems of students and
administrators in meeting the
English. Particular difficulties
exist in such a locality because
there is not one or even two
representative groups with whom
contact can be made. Local
society will still be more rigidly
structured than in much of
changing Britain today. The
adjacent towns of Maidenhead,
Cookham and Bourne End, still
half in the country, are
sufficiently near to London to
provide commuter homes for
many business and professional
people whose social life is
concentrated largely over
weekends, with younger members
of the families away from home
except for Christman and Easter
vacations. They are likely to
entertain themselves separately
from those whose livelihoods are
gained locally.
Visits to the campus
could attract the curiosity of
those who wish to see the house
and what the Americans are doing
there. I ask if more could not be
done, in the long term, by getting
out among the people. Time may
not permit this, but I can see the
ridiculous "baseball and
chewing-gum" image being broken
down by visits to give talks to
social and sports groups, chambers
of commerce, school, church,
hospital and drama clubs. Talks,
demonstrations, performances—
the whole environment and
thinking of California and the
Home Counties is so different that
I cannot but believe that curiosity
would be followed by a truly
interested friendship. Who knows?
Eton is close at hand. Perhaps we
have reached the age of reason
when, having obtained possession
of one historic institution,
Stanford might succeed in shaking
up another.

Minor Objections Indeed
Editor, THE DAILY:
In all fairness can one cite
another aspect of undergraduate
life at Stanford to which so high a
proportion of the student body
owes so much as it does to the
Overseas Campus program? We
doubt it. There can be even less
question but that with the
exception of Professor Strothman,
to whose vision Stanford owes the
inception of the program, it is to
Professor Walker that we are most
indebted for what the overseas
campuses have added to student
life at Stanford. As departmental
colleagues of Professor Walker we
have been close observers of the
program from its beginning. In
our judgment one must conclude
that without the Director's
enthusiasm, perseverence and
drive it would have come to enjoy
neither its success nor its size.
Thanks to the formidable task to
which Professor Walker has
devoted himself cheerfully and
faithfully from quarter to quarter
and year to year, thousands of
Stanford men and women have
benefited from a great experience
which earlier students would have
envied and future students hope
to share. Beside that signal
accomplishment we think of the
brickbats from some of your
columnists in those words from
Strafford, an early play of Robert
Browning's:
Oh, there's no charge, no
precise charge;
Only they sneer, make light of
— one may say,
Nibble at what you do.
For our part we take particular
exception to the unnecessaty and
unkind imputation that somehow
Professor Walker finds in the
faculty staffing for the overseas
campuses the means of stifling
faculty criticism As colleagues in
his own department, one of us
having been at an overseas campus
once in all this time and the other
never at all, we can attest to the
problem created for Professor
Walker and his office by the

necessity for persuading busy
faculty members to leave the
California scene for six months at
a time. With respect to the
criticisms themselves we think
that though there is room for
improvement in all Stanford (and
therefore human) institutions and
programs, the Overseas Campus
program being no exception,
when viewed in the larger
perspective such objections as
have been voiced seem minor indeed

Six Points of Commentary
Editor, THE DAILY:
The suspicions a member of the
Faculty arouses and the personal
attacks he invites if he writes
about the Overseas Campus
Program seem to be in direct
relation to the knowledge of the
Program he possesses. If he has
never taught at a foreign campus,
he cannot be accused of being
obligated to the Program's
Director - Dr. Walker; that he may
have no direct acquaintance with
the Program is apparently not at
all important — his judgment is
unimpaired. If he has attended
once, the suspicion that he has
become Walker's stooge evidently
reduces his value as a witness,
despite the obviously greater
knowledge of the Program his six
months' experience should
provide. And if he has been twice,
and even worse, if he is down to
go again — as I confess is my lot —
then presumably he should be
drummed to silence. His
testimony is obviously corrupted;
who in his right mind would listen
to a witness who willingly perjures
himself to a six months'
"holiday"!
Unfortunately, such an
atmosphere is bound to give those
who know the least an especially
prominent role in determining
how to improve the Program. Yet
however bad any program has
been, it is difficult to believe that
one turned over to those whose
most important qualification is a
lack of bias, is really likely to be
improved. And, incidentally, is
lack of bias a fact?
Confessing then to the
possibility that I have sold my
soul, let me set out propositions
which seem to be relevant:
First, it would be best to
discuss the Program without these
silly aspersions: — that X is
incompetent because he is a friend
of Y or beholden to Z or was
sitting next to W; as I was —
though I had never imagined that
where I sat would interest any of
the Daily's readers. (Incidentally,
I sat where Dr. Winbigler put me.
He is in charge of making
arrangements for visitors to the
Senate.)
Second, most of the issues are
really not so simple that they can
be adequately handled by slogans
and short articles in the Daily.
How many quarters of Italian
should a student who is to attend
the Florence campus be required
to take before departure is not
likely to be answered sensibly by
such mini-arguments as:
(a) "all power to . . . (you name
it)". Therefore, the answer is zero.
(b) "Walker thinks 2 is ideal."
Therefore, I believe the proper
answer is one; or maybe 3.
And yet that question is one of
the simpler ones.
Next: the allegations that the
Program has been frozen at all, or
that it has been frozen by the
Overseas Campus Office — the
Devil-Theory again — is so much
hot air. It has changed again and
again. Those who assert that it has
not altered, often mean that it has
not changed along the lines that
they have urged.
Fourth: It should be
emphasized that a large (I believe)
proportion of the faculty who
have been associated with the
Program, and certainly most of
the students who have been to
Florence with me regard the
Program as remarkably successful.
The statement that the six months
at a foreign campus were the best
and most important part of the
whole undergraduate program
seems to me to be quite common.

Next: The simplistic notion
that there is a single cause for all
the ills from which the Program
suffers — the Director is at the
moment the fashionable
Devil—ought not to carry much
conviction with a University
audience. Complex results
generally have a more complicated
causation-set. I am sure Walker's
decisions have sometimes been
wrong. (I have sometimes
disagreed with him — which goes
to prove my point). At other
times, a faculty member has made
a bad mistake; I admit that I have
contributed my bit to rendering
the Program less good than it
could have been. Sometimes the
fault lies with the Dean, or the
Overseas Director, or the selection
(of students or faculty) process;
or the weather, the "natives" or
even some of the students who
have been involved in the
Program.
If there is to be improvement,
attention has to be directed to all
these and still more "causes". But
the contribution of the local
Director, the staff of the Overseas
Campus Office, the students, the
faculty or the Program's Director
should be judged by reference to
the total picture — its failures and
also its successes. Otherwise, in
doing away with one of the causes
of its failures we may unwittingly
dispose of one of the reasons —
and perhaps a very important one
— for its successes.
Finally: It is ironic that at the
very time when it should have
become easier to make use of the
help of all members of the
community in improving the
Program, we find ourselves in an
atmosphere is innuendo and
suspicion — ingredients which
tend to reduce the benefits such
help can provide.
There are now five
subcommittees which have just
begun to operate, each charged
with at least a partial
responsibility for an Overseas
Campus. I am sure that any
subcommittee would welcome
criticism, whether constructive or
not, and suggestions for changes
in the Program. As Chairman of
the subcommittee concerned with
the Italian campus, I most heartily
invite communications,
discussions and what have you.
We begin next week with a
consideration of the language
prerequisite and have invited up
to 12 students who have returned
from Florence in the last two
years to appear so that we can see
just where we are at. As other
matters come up, we shall invite
help from all. I hope it will be
forthcoming.
