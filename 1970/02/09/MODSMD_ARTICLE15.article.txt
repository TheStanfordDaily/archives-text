# Med Society May Open To Students
## 
### 
Concerned about a "lack of
direct communication with
medical students," the Council
(governing board) of the Santa
Clara County Medical Society has
begun proceedings to open
membership in the Society to
students at Stanford University
School of Medicine.
Disclosure of the proposals to
involve students in Medical
Society affairs was made today by
Dr. R. Hewlett Lee of Palo Alto,
president of the Society and a
Stanford medical alumnus.
Approval will hinge on
ratification of a change in the
organization's by-laws by a
majority of the Society's
members. I
The Council also submitted
proposals that would allow
students to be appointed to
Society committees, to have a
student-elected representative as a
voting member of the Council,
and to publish their opinions in
the Society's newsletter.
So that better communications
can flow both ways, the
physicians, in turn, would increase
their teaching activities, hold
noon seminars, and include the

students on the newsletter mailing
list.
The proposals are the
outgrowth of dialogue which
began a year ago, Dr. Lee said. A
liaison committee composed of
members of both groups worked
out the details.
The liaison committee
chairman, Dr. Joseph Ignatius of
Los Altos, commented that an
active role on the Society's
committees "will allow students
to participate in a meaningful
way, not in a token way, because
it is the committees that
formulate and carry out policy."
Dr. Lee said the students can
offer new ideas and talent in the
areas "where the action is." He
noted that the scope of
committee activities includes
representing the local group at
state and national meetings,
studying health care for the poor,
recommending changes in the law,
enforcing professional medical
standards among the members,
planning a weekly educational TV
show for doctors in the county,
and conducting public health
studies such as a current one on
environmental planning.
