# Draft Hits Hard
## Physics Grad Students Quit 
### 
Graduate students in 11 of the
nation's top ranked physics
departments have been hit hard
by the draft, an informal survey
here discloses.
Among those accepted for
graduate work in the fall of 1968,
24 percent failed to enroll or have
left graduate study because of the
draft. Another 13 percent did not
show or dropped out for reasons
which may have been
draft-related. Many of those still
enrolled may be drafted at the
end of the current academic year.
If no special consideration is
given graduate students during the
current four-year transition to a
19-year-old lottery system, "the
effect on our graduate program
will be disastrous," says Prof.
Walter Meyerhof, graduate adviser
in physics at Stanford who
initiated the national survey.
To back this claim, Meyerhof
cites these Stanford statistics: In
the fall of 1968, about 400
students applied for graduate
study in physics. Of these, 29
accepted admission, indicating
they would enroll. More than 80
percent had National Science
Foundation or other fellowships
and Graduate Record
Examination scores within the top

tenth of all physics
undergraduates in the U.S.
Eleven of the 29 did not come
or have now left for draft-related
reasons, while one did not enroll
for other reasons. Of the
remaining 17 students, 13 are
draft vulnerable. Most will receive
1-A classifications this year and,
under the present lottery system,
at least half probably will be
drafted.
Thus, Meyerhof predicts, less
than one-half of the class accepted
for admission in 1968 —and
perhaps as few as one-third—will
be left by the fall of 1970. Similar
trends are apparent elsewhere.
Meyerhof surveyed 21 physics
departments ranked as
"distinguished" or "strong" in the
1966 survey of the American
Council of Education. Those
responding included Berkeley,
Harvard, Princeton, Illinois, Yale,
Michigan, Rochester, Maryland,
Johns Hopkins, and
Carnegie-Mellon.
In April 1968, Mrs. Betty
Vetter, executive director of the
Scientific Manpower Commission
in Washington, predicted that new
draft rules adopted then would
result in the elimination of half of
three consecutive classes of

entering graduate students, and
almost two-thirds in physics.
"It's now apparent tha this dire
prediction may be fulfilled,"
Meyerhof comments.
The recently-announced
postponement of induction of
graduate students until the end of
the current academic year "does
not affect these long-range
predictions," Meyerhoff adds.
Interviews with students who
have left graduate study in physics
for non-academic reasons show
that a "large percentage are
actually leaving the field as a
result of 1-A classification and
will not return at a later date," he
notes. Moreover, there has been
no equivalent flow of students

into the department from other
lields of graduate study.
"One-third of our graduate
students teach and more than 95
percent are involved in some
research project," he adds. "It is
obvious that the predicted large
decrease of graduate enrollment
caused by the draft will have a
very damaging effect on our
educational and research program.
"The blame for this unhappy
situation clearly lies with the
legislative and executive branches
of our government. Unless drastic
changes in the draft laws are
made, our government is guilty of
eroding the educational and
research programs of some of the
finest physics departments in the
country," Meyerhof commented.

notes. Moreover, there has been
no equivalent flow of students

into the department from other
lields of graduate study.
"One-third of our graduate
students teach and more than 95
percent are involved in some
research project," he adds. "It is
obvious that the predicted large
decrease of graduate enrollment
caused by the draft will have a
very damaging effect on our
educational and research program.
"The blame for this unhappy
situation clearly lies with the
legislative and executive branches
of our government. Unless drastic
changes in the draft laws are
made, our government is guilty of
eroding the educational and
research programs of some of the
finest physics departments in the
country," Meyerhof commented.
Graduate students in 11 of the
nation's top ranked physics
departments have been hit hard
by the draft, an informal survey
here discloses.
Among those accepted for
graduate work in the fall of 1968,
24 percent failed to enroll or have
left graduate study because of the
draft. Another 13 percent did not
show or dropped out for reasons
which may have been
draft-related. Many of those still
enrolled may be drafted at the
end of the current academic year.
If no special consideration is
given graduate students during the
current four-year transition to a
19-year-old lottery system, "the
effect on our graduate program
will be disastrous," says Prof.
Walter Meyerhof, graduate adviser
in physics at Stanford who
initiated the national survey.
To back this claim, Meyerhof
cites these Stanford statistics: In
the fall of 1968, about 400
students applied for graduate
study in physics. Of these, 29
accepted admission, indicating
they would enroll. More than 80
percent had National Science
Foundation or other fellowships
and Graduate Record
Examination scores within the top

tenth of all physics
undergraduates in the U.S.
Eleven of the 29 did not come
or have now left for draft-related
reasons, while one did not enroll
for other reasons. Of the
remaining 17 students, 13 are
draft vulnerable. Most will receive
1-A classifications this year and,
under the present lottery system,
at least half probably will be
drafted.
Thus, Meyerhof predicts, less
than one-half of the class accepted
for admission in 1968 —and
perhaps as few as one-third—will
be left by the fall of 1970. Similar
trends are apparent elsewhere.
Meyerhof surveyed 21 physics
departments ranked as
"distinguished" or "strong" in the
1966 survey of the American
Council of Education. Those
responding included Berkeley,
Harvard, Princeton, Illinois, Yale,
Michigan, Rochester, Maryland,
Johns Hopkins, and
Carnegie-Mellon.
In April 1968, Mrs. Betty
Vetter, executive director of the
Scientific Manpower Commission
in Washington, predicted that new
draft rules adopted then would
result in the elimination of half of
three consecutive classes of

entering graduate students, and
almost two-thirds in physics.
"It's now apparent tha this dire
prediction may be fulfilled,"
Meyerhof comments.
The recently-announced
postponement of induction of
graduate students until the end of
the current academic year "does
not affect these long-range
predictions," Meyerhoff adds.
Interviews with students who
have left graduate study in physics
for non-academic reasons show
that a "large percentage are
actually leaving the field as a
result of 1-A classification and
will not return at a later date," he
notes. Moreover, there has been
no equivalent flow of students

into the department from other
lields of graduate study.
