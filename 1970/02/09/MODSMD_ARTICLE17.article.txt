# Committee Would Alter Mt, View Demerit Plan
## 
### 
The demerit system at Mountain View's Graham School which has
come under heavy fire from Mexican-Americans within the past week
will be retained in a revamped and liberalized form, according to the
chairman of a study committee on the issue.
The disciplinary system was one complaint of Stanford Chicanos,
who picketed the homes of school board members last Wednesday.
W.F. Tetreault revealed the committee's recommendations last
Thursday. He said that only the "guidelines" for the demerit system
would undergo change, while the system itself would be retained.
The committee will recommend that a student get 15 demerits of a
minor nature or 10 demerits of a more serious nature before he was
suspended.
The controversy broke into the open last week when Ruben Michel,
a junior high school student, was suspended for accumulating too
many demerits.
Stanford's Assistant Dean of Students, Felix Guiterrez, who has
been working with MECHA for broader reforms in the Mountain View
school system said he was "disappointed with the recommendation.
"I don't think they went far enough. But of course they were only
considering the demerit system, and not our demands.
"Furthermore, numbers like that are arbitrary. Why not have 50
demerits before expelling a student as well as 5 or 15?"
MECHA plans to keep protesting school conditions. "This is not
the time to desert the school system," said Guiterrez.
