(Continued from page two.)
A student movement has no
long term chance of succeeding
unless it ailies itself with the
working class through lasting
friendships and close political ties
based on common goals. These
ties can be built best with campus
workers, because we have the
opportunity to get part time jobs
(only jobs which the
administration has set aside for
students) and work with these
people. These ties can form the
basis of a struggle over specific
injustices against campus workers,
in which the workers must take
the lead.
These struggles have been
successful at Yale (a black woman
cafeteria worker was rehired after
being fired for fighting back
against a racist supervisor), at

Harvard (a racist wage differential
between black and white painters
was eliminated), and at Radcliffe
(a wage differential between male
and female cafeteria workers was
eliminated), and many other
colleges and universities. In the
process of these struggles, student
elitism and anti-working class
attitudes are broken down, and
workers begin to trust students.
When issues such as these are won,
defeatism among students and
worker is destroyed.
(A meeting will be held
Tuesday, February 10, to form a
new chapter of Stanford SDS,
allied with PL-SDS, to build an
anti-imperialist, anti-racist,
pro-working class student
movement. Douglas R. Hogan is a
member of the Worker's Student
Alliance Caucus.)
