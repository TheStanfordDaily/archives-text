## Kazan,Zeffirelli Encores 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Notable among this week's
films are fine efforts by W,S.
Van Dyke, Elia Kazan, Philippe
de Broca, Stanley Donen and
Franco Zeffirelli.
Clive Miller's star-studded
Tuesday night double-bill is
quite marvelous indeed. After a
seven-minute March of Time,
"Problems of Working Girls,"
Clive will show what he claims is
one of the greatest comedies of
all time, "Libeled Lady," which
boasts the marvellous cast of
Jean Harlow, William Powell,
Myrna Loy and Spencer Tracy.
Following that is "San
Francisco," an exciting special
effects drama dealing with the
legendary earthquake. It stars
Clark Gable, Jeanette
Mac Donald and, again, Spencer
Tracy, and though largely
directed by W.S. Van Dyke,
several scenes were helmed by
D.W. Griffith. In Geology 320
starting at 8 p.m.
For those who missed it two
weeks ago, Elia Kazan's "On the
Waterfront" will be shown on
Thursday at 7 and 9 in Bishop
Auditorium. Though somewhat
theatrical in style, the film is an
undeniable American classic and
Brando's performance stands as
one of the all-time greats. With
Rod Steiger, Eva Marie Saint,
Karl Maiden and Lee J. Cobb.
"The Salt of the Earth" takes
a realistic but labored look at
the plight of Mexican-American
families in our Southwest,
focusing on a miner's strike in
1951-52. The writer, producer
and director were blacklisted
from Hollywood for the

communist propaganda
supposedly present in the
picture. This week's
International Association film
will be shown in Cubberley at
7:45 on Thursday.
Aside from "That Man From
Rio" and "King of Hearts," the
work of Philippe de Broca hasn't
been widely accessible to
American audiences. This Friday
provides an opportunity to see
the director's highly acclaimed
1961 comedy, "The Five-Day
Lover," which stars the
marvelous Jean-Pierre Cassel and
Jean Seberg. The film, with
music by the incomparable
Georges Delerue, will be shown
at 7, 8 and 9 in Tresidder.
"Accattone" was the first film
of Pier Paolo Pasolini ("The
Gospel According to St.
Matthew"). In this picture, the
Marxist director examines life in
the slum suburbs of Rome. In
Cubberley on Friday at 7 and
9:30.
"The List of Adrian
Messenger" is a rather unexciting
thriller and is especially
disappointing coming from the
hand of John Huston. George C.
Scott, Clive Brook and Dana
Wynter star in this muddled
mystery, though upon the film's
release, most of the attention
went to Tony Curtis, Kirk
Douglas, Burt Lancaster, Robert
Mitchum and Frank Sinatra,
who appear disguised in cameo
roles. In Rinconada Dining Hall
on Friday at 11.
Showing at the underground
film series on Friday at 11 in
Geology 320 are Broughton's
"Pleasure Garden," George

Kuchar's "Hold Me While I'm
Naked," Stan Brakhage's
"Reflections on Black," Maas'
"Geography of the Body," Betty
Boop in "May Party" and "God
is Dog Spelled Backwards."
Audrey Hepburn, Albert
Finney, director Stanley Donen
and photographer Chris Challis
are all in top form in "Two for
the Road," one of the most
intelligent entertainments of the
sixties. Screenwriter Frederick
Raphael's use of the fashionable
technique of a jumbled time
story structure is more effective
than in many a self-conscious
"art" film. With Jacqueline
Bisset in a bit part. At Tresidder
on Saturday at 7, 8 and 9.
Posterity's image of Marlon
Brando will probably be formed
more by "The Wild One" than
by any other of the actor's films.
Though the film is emphatically
sociological, it remains highly
entertaining as well. With Lee
Marvin. In Cubberley on
Saturday at 7:30, 9 and 10:30.
The final film in the New Line
Cinema series presented by
ASSU is Jan Nemec's "Martyrs
of Love." This Czechoslovakian
picture, which has won high
praise at several international
film festivals, will be shown on
Saturday night in Dinkelspiel
along with the shorts,
"Apprenticeship" and "Homo
Ludens."
Franco Zeffirelli effectively
brought Shakespeare back to the
masses with "Romeo and
Juliet." John McEnery as
Mercutio stands out in the
energetic young cast. At the
Sunday Flicks.

"Reflections on Black," Maas'
"Geography of the Body," Betty
Boop in "May Party" and "God
is Dog Spelled Backwards."
Audrey Hepburn, Albert
Finney, director Stanley Donen
and photographer Chris Challis
are all in top form in "Two for
the Road," one of the most
intelligent entertainments of the
sixties. Screenwriter Frederick
Raphael's use of the fashionable
technique of a jumbled time
story structure is more effective
than in many a self-conscious
"art" film. With Jacqueline
Bisset in a bit part. At Tresidder
on Saturday at 7, 8 and 9.
Posterity's image of Marlon
Brando will probably be formed
more by "The Wild One" than
by any other of the actor's films.
Though the film is emphatically
sociological, it remains highly
entertaining as well. With Lee
Marvin. In Cubberley on
Saturday at 7:30, 9 and 10:30.
The final film in the New Line
Cinema series presented by
ASSU is Jan Nemec's "Martyrs
of Love." This Czechoslovakian
picture, which has won high
praise at several international
film festivals, will be shown on
Saturday night in Dinkelspiel
along with the shorts,
"Apprenticeship" and "Homo
Ludens."
Franco Zeffirelli effectively
brought Shakespeare back to the
masses with "Romeo and
Juliet." John McEnery as
Mercutio stands out in the
energetic young cast. At the
Sunday Flicks.
Notable among this week's
films are fine efforts by W,S.
Van Dyke, Elia Kazan, Philippe
de Broca, Stanley Donen and
Franco Zeffirelli.
Clive Miller's star-studded
Tuesday night double-bill is
quite marvelous indeed. After a
seven-minute March of Time,
"Problems of Working Girls,"
Clive will show what he claims is
one of the greatest comedies of
all time, "Libeled Lady," which
boasts the marvellous cast of
Jean Harlow, William Powell,
Myrna Loy and Spencer Tracy.
Following that is "San
Francisco," an exciting special
effects drama dealing with the
legendary earthquake. It stars
Clark Gable, Jeanette
Mac Donald and, again, Spencer
Tracy, and though largely
directed by W.S. Van Dyke,
several scenes were helmed by
D.W. Griffith. In Geology 320
starting at 8 p.m.
For those who missed it two
weeks ago, Elia Kazan's "On the
Waterfront" will be shown on
Thursday at 7 and 9 in Bishop
Auditorium. Though somewhat
theatrical in style, the film is an
undeniable American classic and
Brando's performance stands as
one of the all-time greats. With
Rod Steiger, Eva Marie Saint,
Karl Maiden and Lee J. Cobb.
"The Salt of the Earth" takes
a realistic but labored look at
the plight of Mexican-American
families in our Southwest,
focusing on a miner's strike in
1951-52. The writer, producer
and director were blacklisted
from Hollywood for the

communist propaganda
supposedly present in the
picture. This week's
International Association film
will be shown in Cubberley at
7:45 on Thursday.
Aside from "That Man From
Rio" and "King of Hearts," the
work of Philippe de Broca hasn't
been widely accessible to
American audiences. This Friday
provides an opportunity to see
the director's highly acclaimed
1961 comedy, "The Five-Day
Lover," which stars the
marvelous Jean-Pierre Cassel and
Jean Seberg. The film, with
music by the incomparable
Georges Delerue, will be shown
at 7, 8 and 9 in Tresidder.
"Accattone" was the first film
of Pier Paolo Pasolini ("The
Gospel According to St.
Matthew"). In this picture, the
Marxist director examines life in
the slum suburbs of Rome. In
Cubberley on Friday at 7 and
9:30.
"The List of Adrian
Messenger" is a rather unexciting
thriller and is especially
disappointing coming from the
hand of John Huston. George C.
Scott, Clive Brook and Dana
Wynter star in this muddled
mystery, though upon the film's
release, most of the attention
went to Tony Curtis, Kirk
Douglas, Burt Lancaster, Robert
Mitchum and Frank Sinatra,
who appear disguised in cameo
roles. In Rinconada Dining Hall
on Friday at 11.
Showing at the underground
film series on Friday at 11 in
Geology 320 are Broughton's
"Pleasure Garden," George

Kuchar's "Hold Me While I'm

"Geography of the Body," Betty

7:45 on Thursday.
Aside from "That Man From
Rio" and "King of Hearts," the
work of Philippe de Broca hasn't
been widely accessible to
American audiences. This Friday
provides an opportunity to see
the director's highly acclaimed
1961 comedy, "The Five-Day
Lover," which stars the
marvelous Jean-Pierre Cassel and
Jean Seberg. The film, with
music by the incomparable
Georges Delerue, will be shown
at 7, 8 and 9 in Tresidder.
"Accattone" was the first film
of Pier Paolo Pasolini ("The
Gospel According to St.
Matthew"). In this picture, the
Marxist director examines life in
the slum suburbs of Rome. In
Cubberley on Friday at 7 and
9:30.
"The List of Adrian
Messenger" is a rather unexciting
thriller and is especially
disappointing coming from the
hand of John Huston. George C.
Scott, Clive Brook and Dana
Wynter star in this muddled
mystery, though upon the film's
release, most of the attention
went to Tony Curtis, Kirk
Douglas, Burt Lancaster, Robert
Mitchum and Frank Sinatra,
who appear disguised in cameo
roles. In Rinconada Dining Hall
on Friday at 11.
Showing at the underground
film series on Friday at 11 in
Geology 320 are Broughton's
"Pleasure Garden," George

Kuchar's "Hold Me While I'm
Naked," Stan Brakhage's
"Reflections on Black," Maas'
"Geography of the Body," Betty
Boop in "May Party" and "God
is Dog Spelled Backwards."
Audrey Hepburn, Albert
Finney, director Stanley Donen
and photographer Chris Challis
are all in top form in "Two for
the Road," one of the most
intelligent entertainments of the
sixties. Screenwriter Frederick
Raphael's use of the fashionable
technique of a jumbled time
story structure is more effective
than in many a self-conscious
"art" film. With Jacqueline
Bisset in a bit part. At Tresidder
on Saturday at 7, 8 and 9.
Posterity's image of Marlon
Brando will probably be formed
more by "The Wild One" than
by any other of the actor's films.
Though the film is emphatically
sociological, it remains highly
entertaining as well. With Lee
Marvin. In Cubberley on
Saturday at 7:30, 9 and 10:30.
The final film in the New Line
Cinema series presented by
ASSU is Jan Nemec's "Martyrs
of Love." This Czechoslovakian
picture, which has won high
praise at several international
film festivals, will be shown on
Saturday night in Dinkelspiel
along with the shorts,
"Apprenticeship" and "Homo
Ludens."
Franco Zeffirelli effectively
brought Shakespeare back to the
masses with "Romeo and
Juliet." John McEnery as
Mercutio stands out in the
energetic young cast. At the
Sunday Flicks.
