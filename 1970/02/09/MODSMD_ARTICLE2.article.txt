# Coffin Calls For Non-Violent Stance
## 
### 
Militant non-violence based on
a new kind of manhood is the
c "*ly effective weapon against the
"established disorder," Dr.
William Sloane Coffin, Jr., said
yesterday.
Recently tried with Dr.
Benjamin Spock for counseling
draft evasion, Coffin is University
Chaplain and Pastor of the Church
l Christ at Yale University.
Long-haired and black-robed, he
spoke before a congregation
nearly filling Memorial Church.
He defined non-violence as "the
determination not to violate the
integrity of any human being,
own self included," noting
that men individually and
collectively come out "pretty
violent."
"Militant non-violence is
refusing to acquiesce to the
other's power, but also refusing to
r\o him wrong," he stated.
If a man is opposed to the war
in Vietnam, he should of course
refuse induction, Coffin stated.
Non-violence also means accepting
the consequences of one's action,
the punishment and suffering.
"Until the adversary in power
Knows that non-violent men are
willing to suffer for their beliefs,
he will not be truly willing to
listen to them," he declared.
Jesus' Influence
Coffin denied the common
assumption that it is ineffective to
-uffer. He gave the example of
Jesus, who stood up against the
evil of his society, accepted
punishment given him, and had a
greater influence on history than
all the kings, armies and
parliaments.
"We must call violent all those
institutions of university,
business, or government that
condemn human beings to
hopelessness. . .that clip the wings
of the human spirit," he
maintained.
Following Ghandi's words that
exploitation is the essence of
violence, Coffin asserted that
violence in its cruelest form is
"organized, efficient, antiseptic,
and profitable."
"The violent ones are less the
mugging drug addicts than those
.n skyscrapers like the Ling
Tower, the house that weapons
built, who never see blood unless
their secretaries have a
nosebleed," he said.
American Control
Reducing the world's
population to a scale of 1,000 (of
which 60 would be Americans) he
stated that the 60 Americans
would control half the total
income and 15 times as much of
the material goods as the rest of
the people.
"Isn't that violent?" he asked,
also citing the violence of poverty
and pollution.
Coffin ascribed the whole
problem to the fundamental
values of the technological
society.
"We live in a land of idol
worshippers, we have the wrong
dreams," he said, describing the
blue collar worker who endlessly
seeks the material wealth which is
necessary to happiness.
Not In Consumer Goods
"Who has the courage to tell
them that the wonders of man do
not consist in consumer goods,
that their wretchedness is
interior?" he asked.
Coffin proposed a revolution of
the concept of manliness, not a
revolution of governments. He
would style this after that of
Jesus, who some consider a
nonrevolutionary because he
never sought power.

"Maybe to Jesus it didn't make
so much difference whether there
was a Jewish or Roman king, as
whether the fundamental values
of the society were reoriented,"
he said.
Coffin illustrated the popular
view of manliness by the Cuban
missle crisis in which, as then
Secretary of State Rusk said, "we
were eyeball to eyeball and the
other fellow blinked." Most
Americans thought this kind of
manliness impressive, Coffin said.
New Covenant Needed
"What we need is a new
covenant with God and with each
other for a new kind of manhood
patterned after the New
Testament kind of man, after
Jesus Christ," he declared. "It is
not we who must prevail but a
truth that is as true for our
adversaries as it is for us."
The aim of non-violence must
not be toward "being right" but
toward reconciliation and healing,
he continued.
"We must have evil because we
so love the good - not just become
damn good haters," he said.

was a Jewish or Roman king, as
whether the fundamental values
of the society were reoriented,"
he said.
Coffin illustrated the popular
view of manliness by the Cuban
missle crisis in which, as then
Secretary of State Rusk said, "we
were eyeball to eyeball and the
other fellow blinked." Most
Americans thought this kind of
manliness impressive, Coffin said.
New Covenant Needed
"What we need is a new
covenant with God and with each
other for a new kind of manhood
patterned after the New
Testament kind of man, after
Jesus Christ," he declared. "It is
not we who must prevail but a
truth that is as true for our
adversaries as it is for us."
The aim of non-violence must
not be toward "being right" but
toward reconciliation and healing,
he continued.
"We must have evil because we
so love the good - not just become
damn good haters," he said.
Militant non-violence based on
a new kind of manhood is the
c "*ly effective weapon against the
"established disorder," Dr.
William Sloane Coffin, Jr., said
yesterday.
Recently tried with Dr.
Benjamin Spock for counseling
draft evasion, Coffin is University
Chaplain and Pastor of the Church
l Christ at Yale University.
Long-haired and black-robed, he
spoke before a congregation
nearly filling Memorial Church.
He defined non-violence as "the
determination not to violate the
integrity of any human being,
own self included," noting
that men individually and
collectively come out "pretty
violent."
"Militant non-violence is
refusing to acquiesce to the
other's power, but also refusing to
r\o him wrong," he stated.
If a man is opposed to the war
in Vietnam, he should of course
refuse induction, Coffin stated.
Non-violence also means accepting
the consequences of one's action,
the punishment and suffering.
"Until the adversary in power
Knows that non-violent men are
willing to suffer for their beliefs,
he will not be truly willing to
listen to them," he declared.
Jesus' Influence
Coffin denied the common
assumption that it is ineffective to
-uffer. He gave the example of
Jesus, who stood up against the
evil of his society, accepted
punishment given him, and had a
greater influence on history than
all the kings, armies and
parliaments.
"We must call violent all those
institutions of university,
business, or government that
condemn human beings to
hopelessness. . .that clip the wings
of the human spirit," he
maintained.
Following Ghandi's words that
exploitation is the essence of
violence, Coffin asserted that
violence in its cruelest form is
"organized, efficient, antiseptic,
and profitable."
"The violent ones are less the
mugging drug addicts than those
.n skyscrapers like the Ling
Tower, the house that weapons
built, who never see blood unless
their secretaries have a
nosebleed," he said.
American Control
Reducing the world's
population to a scale of 1,000 (of
which 60 would be Americans) he
stated that the 60 Americans
would control half the total
income and 15 times as much of
the material goods as the rest of
the people.
"Isn't that violent?" he asked,
also citing the violence of poverty
and pollution.
Coffin ascribed the whole
problem to the fundamental
values of the technological
society.
"We live in a land of idol
worshippers, we have the wrong
dreams," he said, describing the
blue collar worker who endlessly
seeks the material wealth which is
necessary to happiness.
Not In Consumer Goods
"Who has the courage to tell
them that the wonders of man do
not consist in consumer goods,
that their wretchedness is
interior?" he asked.
Coffin proposed a revolution of
the concept of manliness, not a
revolution of governments. He
would style this after that of
Jesus, who some consider a
nonrevolutionary because he
never sought power.

"Maybe to Jesus it didn't make
so much difference whether there
was a Jewish or Roman king, as
whether the fundamental values
of the society were reoriented,"
he said.
Coffin illustrated the popular
