# Sympathetic Vibrations
## New Maestro, New Mood 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
How appropriate that Seiji
Ozawa's first meeting with the
San Francisco Symphony this
year should include Elgar's
"Enigma Variations," for the
entire concert must have been
puzzling to many in the orchestra
as well as in the audience.
The diminutive Maestro, who
will become the Symphony's
Conductor and Music Director
next season, bounced cheerily out
onto the stage, long hair shining
and looking more like a carved
doll than a conductor with an
international reputation.
Quickly dispelling any fears the
audience may have had, Maestro
Ozawa opened the program with
Beethoven's graceful "Symphony
No. 4," once described as "a
slender Greek maiden standing
between two giants," the heroic
"Third" and the triumphant
"Fifth."
The contrast with Maestro
Krips' direction was immediately
apparent; Ozawa's direction lacks
the Teutonic ponderosity of his
predecessor, as well as the
obeisance to tradition. Although
lacking somewhat in dynamic
gradations, the little-known
Beethoven work was a great
success.
Computer Joins Orchestra
Next on the program was the
first way-out piece of this season,
"Eonta" by lannis Xenakis.
Pianist Yuji Takahashi, four
trumpets and four trombones—the
sum total of the instrumenta

tion—were directed by Ozawa,
choir-style without baton.
, The piece is the joint
production of Xenakis and an
IBM 7090 computer. Xenakis
conceived the form and direction
of the piece, and then
programmed his Parisian grey box
to generate random notes for a
piano introduction.
The rest of the piece is
composer-generated, through a
process similar to that used by
traditional composers. Taking a
set of musical ideas, Xenakis
performed logical operations on
them, achieving a sequence of
music. Bach did the same thing,
only with a different set of rules.
Repulsion and Curiosity
To our ears, however, Bach
sounds like music, and Xenakis
doesn't. This is a result of our
training and of what we are used
to, and does not mean that
Xenakis' composition is
non-musical. I have no doubt that
this type of music will be
considered "classical" within a
hundred years; today it is known
as "avant-garde" and is regarded
with repulsion and curiosity.
There are quite a few Xenakis
creations on records, including the
piano and strings version of
"Eonta" on Vanguard. Other
works include recordings of
"Achorripsis," on an Angel disc
and a Capitol disc, and "Akrata"
on both Columbia and Nonesuch.
Understanding this complex music
will take effort and time. We
should think of ourselves as

Parisian audiences hearing
Stravinsky or Viennese audiences
presented with Mozart. It will be
an experience in understanding.
As I said, it was fitting that the
concert should conclude with
"Enigma Variations." Elgar loved
practical jokes, and his
"Variations on an Original
Theme" was no exception.
Practical Joke
At its first performance at the
turn of the century, Elgar let it be
known that there was a theme,
and a common one—but he
wouldn't say what it was. He told
three friends the secret, but Elgar
and his friends all died without
revealing it.
Themes from "Pop Goes the
Weasel" to Wagner have been
proposed, with varying
acceptability. The most likely
alternative, it now seems, is that

Elgar was playing a joke on
posterity, and actually had no
theme in mind.
Theme or no theme,
"Variations" is a superb piece,
one of Elgar's best. Shifting
moods between and within
sections, the composer explores
the total range of the orchestra,
and the Symphony was equal to
the task. Every section acquitted
itself admirably, including the
much-criticized horns. Ozawa did
an outstanding job of dynamic
and tonal integration, always
keeping a firm balance around the
orchestra.
The uncertainty many patrons
may have felt at first was dispelled
as the concert ended. Seiji Ozawa
is a conductor of the first rank,
and should find an enthusiastic,
appreciative audience in San
Francisco.
