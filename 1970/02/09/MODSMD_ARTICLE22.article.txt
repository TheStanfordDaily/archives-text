# Michel Bucket Clips Beavers
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford basketball coach
Howie Dallmar borrowed some
Oregon .State tactics Saturday
night, and his strategy led to a
71-69 Indian victory on a 20 foot
jump shot by Mike Michel with
one second left.
Stanford, who had trailed OSU
for the whole game, finally tied it
up at 69-69 on a rebound basket
by Bill Palmer with 1:57 left. The
Beavers then tried to work for one
shot but Dallmar decided to take
a foul to stop the Beaver stall.
Larry Webber missed his free
throw with 59 seconds left and
Stanford got the ball.
The Indians used some OSU
strategy as they worked down the
last 58 seconds on the clock
before Michel's heroic hoop. The
win broke a three game losing
streak and gave the Cards a split in
weekend games with the visiting
Oregon Schools.
Slow Start
Stanford had trouble getting
started against the Beavers and
OSU held a 1 2 point lead midway
through the first half. The Cards
steadily chopped away at the
visitors' lead until they closed it
to 41-37 on Fred Green's bucket
at the halftime buzzer.
OSU stayed out in front until
Claude Terry hit five buckets in
less than four minutes to close it
to 67-63 with 4:59 left. It was
Terry's hot shooting which set the
stage for Michel's last second shot.
Terry ended up with 28 points
as he hit on 11 of 14 field goals
and six of six free throws. Michel
added 13 and Dennis O'Neill
picked up ten. The Beavers were
paced by seven-foot Vic
Bartolome's 22 while Freddie
Boyd had 16 and Vince Fritz 15.
OSU shot 56 percent to
Stanford's 48 percent, but the
Indians got four more free throws
than the Beavers.
It was a different story Friday
night as Stanford trailed Oregon
for most of the way and the
Ducks coasted to an 87-73 win.
Oregon took the lead at 20-19
with 12:05 left in the half and
they outscored the Indians 27-11
for a 47-30 halftime lead. Leonard
Jackson hit on eight of 10 field
goals to pace the Ducks in the
first half.
Fast Finish
Stanford had shot only 26
percent in the first half, but they
came out hot in the second and
quickly cut into Oregon's lead.
The Indians trailed by only two at
56-54 with 11:48 left, but Oregon
ran off five straight points and
Stanford never got that close
again. Oregon was led in the
scoring column by center Stan
Love's 24 points, while Billy
Gaskins added 17 and Leonard

Jackson 16. Terry again led the
Indians with 16, while O'Neill and
LJnuck Moore came up with 14
and 15 points each.
In preliminary games, the
Stanford frosh ran their record to
9-2 with a pair of convincing wins.
The little Indians beat St. Mary's
Frosh 88-77 and demolished
Sacramento State's frosh 96-73.
Against St. Mary's, forward Pat
Rusco played an outstanding
game as he picked up 33 points.
Against Sacramento State
center Pat Stevens picked up 26
points and 19 rebounds while
John Stratton added 23 and
Rusco 22.
The split over the weekend
gives Stanford a 2-5 league record
and a 5-13 overall mark. Next
weekend the Cards travel to
Oregon to take on the same
Oregon teams in a rematch of this
weekend's games. Dallmar is
hopeful that 6-10 center Larry
Rosenzweig may be able to see
some action this coming weekend.

Jackson hit on eight of 10 field
goals to pace the Ducks in the
first half.
Fast Finish
Stanford had shot only 26
percent in the first half, but they
came out hot in the second and
quickly cut into Oregon's lead.
The Indians trailed by only two at
56-54 with 11:48 left, but Oregon
ran off five straight points and
Stanford never got that close
again. Oregon was led in the
scoring column by center Stan
Love's 24 points, while Billy
Gaskins added 17 and Leonard

Jackson 16. Terry again led the
Indians with 16, while O'Neill and
LJnuck Moore came up with 14
and 15 points each.
In preliminary games, the
Stanford frosh ran their record to
9-2 with a pair of convincing wins.
The little Indians beat St. Mary's
Frosh 88-77 and demolished
Sacramento State's frosh 96-73.
Against St. Mary's, forward Pat
Rusco played an outstanding
game as he picked up 33 points.
Against Sacramento State
center Pat Stevens picked up 26
points and 19 rebounds while
John Stratton added 23 and
Rusco 22.
The split over the weekend
gives Stanford a 2-5 league record
and a 5-13 overall mark. Next
weekend the Cards travel to
Oregon to take on the same
Oregon teams in a rematch of this
weekend's games. Dallmar is
hopeful that 6-10 center Larry
Rosenzweig may be able to see
some action this coming weekend.

THE NIGHT BEFORE: Stanford's Mike Michel shooting against Oregon on
Friday. A similar shot from the top of the key with one second remaining gave
the Indians a two point win over OSU Saturday.
Stanford basketball coach
Howie Dallmar borrowed some
Oregon .State tactics Saturday
night, and his strategy led to a
71-69 Indian victory on a 20 foot
jump shot by Mike Michel with
one second left.
Stanford, who had trailed OSU
for the whole game, finally tied it
up at 69-69 on a rebound basket
by Bill Palmer with 1:57 left. The
Beavers then tried to work for one
shot but Dallmar decided to take
a foul to stop the Beaver stall.
Larry Webber missed his free
throw with 59 seconds left and
Stanford got the ball.
The Indians used some OSU
strategy as they worked down the
last 58 seconds on the clock
before Michel's heroic hoop. The
win broke a three game losing
streak and gave the Cards a split in
weekend games with the visiting
Oregon Schools.
Slow Start
Stanford had trouble getting
started against the Beavers and
OSU held a 1 2 point lead midway
through the first half. The Cards
steadily chopped away at the
visitors' lead until they closed it
to 41-37 on Fred Green's bucket
at the halftime buzzer.
OSU stayed out in front until
Claude Terry hit five buckets in
less than four minutes to close it
to 67-63 with 4:59 left. It was
Terry's hot shooting which set the
stage for Michel's last second shot.
Terry ended up with 28 points
as he hit on 11 of 14 field goals
and six of six free throws. Michel
added 13 and Dennis O'Neill
picked up ten. The Beavers were
paced by seven-foot Vic
Bartolome's 22 while Freddie
Boyd had 16 and Vince Fritz 15.
OSU shot 56 percent to
Stanford's 48 percent, but the
Indians got four more free throws
than the Beavers.
It was a different story Friday
night as Stanford trailed Oregon
for most of the way and the
Ducks coasted to an 87-73 win.
Oregon took the lead at 20-19
with 12:05 left in the half and
they outscored the Indians 27-11
for a 47-30 halftime lead. Leonard

THE NIGHT BEFORE: Stanford's Mike Michel shooting against Oregon on
Friday. A similar shot from the top of the key with one second remaining gave
the Indians a two point win over OSU Saturday.
Stanford basketball coach
Howie Dallmar borrowed some
Oregon .State tactics Saturday
night, and his strategy led to a
71-69 Indian victory on a 20 foot
jump shot by Mike Michel with
one second left.
Stanford, who had trailed OSU
for the whole game, finally tied it
up at 69-69 on a rebound basket
by Bill Palmer with 1:57 left. The
Beavers then tried to work for one
shot but Dallmar decided to take
a foul to stop the Beaver stall.
Larry Webber missed his free
throw with 59 seconds left and
Stanford got the ball.
The Indians used some OSU
strategy as they worked down the
last 58 seconds on the clock
before Michel's heroic hoop. The
win broke a three game losing
streak and gave the Cards a split in
weekend games with the visiting
Oregon Schools.
Slow Start
Stanford had trouble getting
started against the Beavers and
OSU held a 1 2 point lead midway
through the first half. The Cards
steadily chopped away at the
visitors' lead until they closed it
to 41-37 on Fred Green's bucket
at the halftime buzzer.
OSU stayed out in front until
Claude Terry hit five buckets in
less than four minutes to close it
to 67-63 with 4:59 left. It was
Terry's hot shooting which set the
stage for Michel's last second shot.
Terry ended up with 28 points
as he hit on 11 of 14 field goals
and six of six free throws. Michel
added 13 and Dennis O'Neill
picked up ten. The Beavers were
paced by seven-foot Vic
Bartolome's 22 while Freddie
Boyd had 16 and Vince Fritz 15.
OSU shot 56 percent to
Stanford's 48 percent, but the
Indians got four more free throws
than the Beavers.
It was a different story Friday
night as Stanford trailed Oregon
for most of the way and the
Ducks coasted to an 87-73 win.
Oregon took the lead at 20-19
with 12:05 left in the half and
they outscored the Indians 27-11
for a 47-30 halftime lead. Leonard
Jackson hit on eight of 10 field
goals to pace the Ducks in the
first half.
Fast Finish
Stanford had shot only 26
percent in the first half, but they
came out hot in the second and
quickly cut into Oregon's lead.
The Indians trailed by only two at
56-54 with 11:48 left, but Oregon
ran off five straight points and
Stanford never got that close
again. Oregon was led in the
scoring column by center Stan
Love's 24 points, while Billy
Gaskins added 17 and Leonard

Jackson 16. Terry again led the
Indians with 16, while O'Neill and
LJnuck Moore came up with 14
and 15 points each.
In preliminary games, the
Stanford frosh ran their record to
9-2 with a pair of convincing wins.
The little Indians beat St. Mary's
Frosh 88-77 and demolished
Sacramento State's frosh 96-73.
Against St. Mary's, forward Pat
Rusco played an outstanding
game as he picked up 33 points.
Against Sacramento State
center Pat Stevens picked up 26
points and 19 rebounds while
John Stratton added 23 and
Rusco 22.
The split over the weekend
gives Stanford a 2-5 league record
and a 5-13 overall mark. Next
weekend the Cards travel to
Oregon to take on the same
Oregon teams in a rematch of this
weekend's games. Dallmar is
hopeful that 6-10 center Larry
Rosenzweig may be able to see
some action this coming weekend.
