# Kauffman's Scoring Sparks Rugby Win
## 
### 
A pair of spectacular runs
resulting in three-point tries by
Jim Kauffman highlighted
Stanford's 1 9-3 rugby victory over
the University of California (Santa
Barbara) here Saturday.
Tribe coach Pete Kmetovic

described Kauffman, a safety on
last fall's football team, as the
game's outstanding performer.
Breakaway Leon Hartvickson,
the leading scorer on both the
1968 and '69 teams, collected
four points on two conversions,
while other Indian tries were
scored by Don Bunce, Pat Preston
and Jack Lasater. Each of the
latter three has also played for
football coach John Ralston.
With next Saturday's Los
Angeles clash against tough UCLA
coming up, Kmetovic is worried
about an injury which might be
crucial: British star Steward
Wilson sustained a rib injury, the
extent of which isn't known at
this time. UCLA beat Cal 12-11
Saturday.
Kmetovic called the UCSB
contest "not one of our best
games," but said that his squad
looked exceptional at times.
In other games Saturday,
Stanford's second team outscored
the Monterey Rugby Club 17-14,
and the third team downed a
University of Santa Clara second
team 17-3. But the Cards' fourth
team lost to Cal State Hayward
10-8.
