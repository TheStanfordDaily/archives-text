### 
California's grapple Bears
intimidated Stanford's decimated
wrestling forces Friday night,
handing the Indians their first
dual meet loss of the season. The
score was 27-9.
With Indian aces Dave Kopolow
(118) and Terry Crenshaw (177)
watching from the sidelines with
injuries, the Bears won the first
three matches of the evening and
went on to register three pins in
their easy victory.
In trying to compensate for
injuries, Stanford Coach Dave
Reed had only three of his men
fighting at their customary
weights, and another three—Dave
Thomas, Bill Ross and Lee
Fair—were wrestling at less than
full strength because of assorted
ailments.
Thomas (142), Len Smith
(158) and Ray Williams (177)
provided Stanford's victories, all
three winning decisions. Thomas
and Smith coasted to 8-1 and 8-2
decisions, while Williams' match
was somewhat closer, 11-5.
Bill Ross (167), his style
hampered by a rule stating that
body contact must be maintained
at all times with a sightless
opponent, was pinned by
California's blind Bob Welch.
Jerry Ross (150) and Charlie
Harris (134) were also pinned.
Wednesday night Stanford
wrestlers travel to San Jose for a
7:30 p.m. match with the
Spartans who sport a number of
good men.
Then on Friday the Indians
host Southern Illinois University,
considered to be one of the best
small college teams in the nations,
at 1:30 p.m. in Encina Pavilion.
Kopolow will probably be back
in the line-up to face the Salukis
(saluki: "a very swift,
keen-sighted graceful breed of
hunting dog bred in Persia, Asia
and Egypt for hundreds of
years."—Webster) and there is a
chance that Crenshaw might be
available, too.
The Indians will get another
shot at the Bears Feb. 28, just
before the conference meet March
6-7. The summary:
Berkeley 27 Stanford 9
118: G. Yamamoto dec. Bell,
14-1; 126: T. Yamamoto dec.

dual meet loss of the season. The
score was 27-9.
With Indian aces Dave Kopolow
(118) and Terry Crenshaw (177)
watching from the sidelines with
injuries, the Bears won the first
three matches of the evening and
went on to register three pins in
their easy victory.
In trying to compensate for
injuries, Stanford Coach Dave
Reed had only three of his men
fighting at their customary
weights, and another three—Dave
Thomas, Bill Ross and Lee
Fair—were wrestling at less than
full strength because of assorted
ailments.
Thomas (142), Len Smith
(158) and Ray Williams (177)
provided Stanford's victories, all
three winning decisions. Thomas
and Smith coasted to 8-1 and 8-2
decisions, while Williams' match
was somewhat closer, 11-5.
Bill Ross (167), his style
hampered by a rule stating that
body contact must be maintained
at all times with a sightless
opponent, was pinned by
California's blind Bob Welch.
Jerry Ross (150) and Charlie
Harris (134) were also pinned.
Wednesday night Stanford
wrestlers travel to San Jose for a
7:30 p.m. match with the
Spartans who sport a number of
good men.
Then on Friday the Indians
host Southern Illinois University,
considered to be one of the best
small college teams in the nations,
at 1:30 p.m. in Encina Pavilion.
Kopolow will probably be back
in the line-up to face the Salukis
(saluki: "a very swift,
keen-sighted graceful breed of
hunting dog bred in Persia, Asia
and Egypt for hundreds of
years."—Webster) and there is a
chance that Crenshaw might be
available, too.
The Indians will get another
shot at the Bears Feb. 28, just
before the conference meet March
6-7. The summary:
Berkeley 27 Stanford 9
118: G. Yamamoto dec. Bell,
