# Yale-By An Arm And A Fraction
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
It meant the season to Yale,
and they took it here Saturday,
with the extended right arm of
Bob Kasting.
Before an overflow crowd of
close to 2000 spectators,
including such names as Don
Schollander and Debbie Meyer,
the Yale swimming team handed
Stanford its first loss of the year,
58-55. The score shows a
three-point victory; it does not
show the two-tenths of a second it
took for Bob Kasting, anchorman
on Yale's freestyle relay, to touch
before his counterpart, Stanford's
Bob Jamison. The relay victory
thus gave the meet to Yale, ending
what was a day of upsets and
battles, one of the finest athletic
contests to be seen here this year.
Yale won the first event of the
day, the 400-yd. medley relay,
immediately throwing a wrench
into Stanford's plans. The Indians,
who were counting on a victory
here for both point and
psychological edges, posted the
second-best time in the country,
3:30.6, with the team of Fred
Haywood, Dave Shilling, John
Ferris, and Bob Jamison. The
winning Yale quartet of Ed
Bettendorf, Phil Long, Paul Katz,
and Kasting now holds the
nation's fastest time 3:29.7.
Yale's fine Olympic distance
swimmer, John Nelson, breezed to
victory in the 1000-yd. freestyle
over Stanford's Bert Mason and
Mark Shelley. Nelson's 9:53.3 is
now the third-fastest time in the
country. Freshman Tim
Broderick, ineligible to swim in
this meet due to Ivy League rules,
watched as Mason, who has been
coming up with some excellent
performances lately, edged
Shelley for second place by a
second's tenth, 10:10.2.
Nelson also won the 500 free,
but victory here took a little more
effort. Pressed most of the way by
Shelley and Brent Berk, Nelson
managed to beat Berk on the last
of 20 laps, 4:46.7. Yale's Mike
Cadden came from behind to take
the third place.
Cadden won the 200-yd.
freestyle in the nation's third-best
time to date, 1:43.8. Second-place
teammate Jim Denvir beat Berk to
give the Elis a sweep of the event.
The sprint events were a
spectator's delight and a judge's
hell. As predicted, two-tenths of a
second separated the winner from
third place in the 50-yd. free.
Yale's Rich May posted a :21.5
victory over Rick Eagleston and
Bob Bebb of Stanford, who both
went :21.7. Judges gave the
second-place decision to Bebb. All
three times are fast enough to
rank among the top dozen in the
nation.
In a most pleasing victory for
Stanford, Bob Jamison beat
Kasting and Eagleston in the 100
free, a tenth off his eighth place
national ranking time of :47.8. It
was a clear win over Kasting, who
posted :48.2, and Eagleston, who
swam a :48.5.
Two outstanding performances
by Stanford's Dave Shilling gave
the sophomore ace the Tribe's
only double victory of the
afternoon. Shilling defeated
teammate John Ferris and Yale's
Brad McKean in the 200-yd.

individual medley in 2:00.2.
Ferris was well off his third place
national time of 1:55.1; the
Stanford Olympian, in
anticipation of his rematch with
Yale butterflier Paul Katz some
20 minutes later, took second in
the IM in 2:02.1.
Shilling also defeated Yale
Olympian Phil Long in the
200-yd. breaststroke, winning the
event in 2:11.1. Two tenths later,
Long established himself as the
nation's 112 o u r th - 112 a s t e st
breaststroker so far, behind
Stanford frosh Brian Job, Shilling,
and Washington's Rick Colella.
Yale's Pete Lawler took third with
2:18.5.
A highlight of the afternoon
was the 200-yd. butterfly, pitting
four of the finest performers from
Yale and Stanford. Unfortunately,
it was not a highlight for Ferris,
who was again upset by Katz; the
Yale tanker posted 1 :56.2 to beat
the popular Stanford butterflier
by four tenths. (Katz' time is
good enough to rank him second
in the country; the nation's fastest
time so far, 1:55.1, is still held by
Ferris.) Third-place Dick Guelff of
Yale posted a 2:00.7 to beat
Stanford's Mike Masarie by close
to four seconds.
Another highly-touted rematch
ended up a little more to
Stanford's liking. Tribe captain
Fred Haywood, who had given an
indication of things to come when
he edged Yale's Ed Bettendorf on
the backstroke leg of the medley
relay, beat his Eli counterpart
handily in the 200-yd. backstroke,
with a 1:57.9 clocking.
Bettendorf, who scraped his toe
badly in the medley relay, posted
a 1:59.1 to beat teammate Bob
Wilson by three seconds.
The enthusiastic spectators
thrilled to a terrific show of aerial
acrobatics by the still-undefeated
diving tandem of Bill Main and
Ted Nichols. The Stanford duo
swept to victory in both the one
and three-meter diving events,
handily beating Yale's Mike
Donahue and Rick Kincade. Main
won the 1-meter with 301.00
points, and took second place to
Nichols in the 3-meter event, as
Nichols garnered 307.15 points to
Main's 306 25.
Going into the 3-meter diving,
the score stood 47-50 in Yale's
favor. Had Stanford pulled out
two additional points in any of
nine preceding events, the diving
sweep would have been enough to
give the Indians the needed 57
points to win before the final
event, the 400-yd. freestyle relay.
That last event, however,
proved the decider, as a
tremendous last-ditch
performance by the Indian team
of Bebb, Haywood, Eagleston and
Jamison failed to beat the Yale
squad of Nelson, Cadden, Denvir
and Kasting. Bob Kasting's
outstretched arm bridged the gap
of two-tenths of a second
separating him from Jamison
(Yale's time: 3:09.0), giving the
race and the meet to the Elis.
It was a fine performance by a
Yale squad which is ineligible for
the NCAA Championships; it was
a heartbreaker for a great
Stanford squad, minus three top
freshmen performers, which has
USC, UCLA, and nationals still to
go.


SUPER-MAIN-Bill won the low board and Ted won the high board, as
Stanford's high-flying divers swept to victory in two events.

over Stanford's Bert Mason and
Mark Shelley. Nelson's 9:53.3 is
now the third-fastest time in the
country. Freshman Tim
Broderick, ineligible to swim in
this meet due to Ivy League rules,
watched as Mason, who has been
coming up with some excellent
performances lately, edged
Shelley for second place by a
second's tenth, 10:10.2.
Nelson also won the 500 free,
but victory here took a little more
effort. Pressed most of the way by
Shelley and Brent Berk, Nelson
managed to beat Berk on the last
of 20 laps, 4:46.7. Yale's Mike
Cadden came from behind to take
the third place.
Cadden won the 200-yd.
freestyle in the nation's third-best
time to date, 1:43.8. Second-place
teammate Jim Denvir beat Berk to
give the Elis a sweep of the event.
The sprint events were a
spectator's delight and a judge's
hell. As predicted, two-tenths of a
second separated the winner from
third place in the 50-yd. free.
Yale's Rich May posted a :21.5
victory over Rick Eagleston and
Bob Bebb of Stanford, who both
went :21.7. Judges gave the
second-place decision to Bebb. All
three times are fast enough to
rank among the top dozen in the
nation.
In a most pleasing victory for
Stanford, Bob Jamison beat
Kasting and Eagleston in the 100
free, a tenth off his eighth place
national ranking time of :47.8. It
was a clear win over Kasting, who
posted :48.2, and Eagleston, who
swam a :48.5.
Two outstanding performances
by Stanford's Dave Shilling gave
the sophomore ace the Tribe's
only double victory of the
afternoon. Shilling defeated
teammate John Ferris and Yale's
Brad McKean in the 200-yd.

individual medley in 2:00.2.
Ferris was well off his third place
national time of 1:55.1; the
Stanford Olympian, in
anticipation of his rematch with
Yale butterflier Paul Katz some
20 minutes later, took second in
the IM in 2:02.1.
Shilling also defeated Yale
Olympian Phil Long in the
200-yd. breaststroke, winning the
event in 2:11.1. Two tenths later,
Long established himself as the
nation's 112 o u r th - 112 a s t e st
breaststroker so far, behind
Stanford frosh Brian Job, Shilling,
and Washington's Rick Colella.
Yale's Pete Lawler took third with
2:18.5.
A highlight of the afternoon
was the 200-yd. butterfly, pitting
four of the finest performers from
Yale and Stanford. Unfortunately,
it was not a highlight for Ferris,
who was again upset by Katz; the
Yale tanker posted 1 :56.2 to beat
the popular Stanford butterflier
by four tenths. (Katz' time is
good enough to rank him second
in the country; the nation's fastest
time so far, 1:55.1, is still held by
Ferris.) Third-place Dick Guelff of
Yale posted a 2:00.7 to beat
Stanford's Mike Masarie by close
to four seconds.
Another highly-touted rematch
ended up a little more to
Stanford's liking. Tribe captain
Fred Haywood, who had given an
indication of things to come when
he edged Yale's Ed Bettendorf on
the backstroke leg of the medley
relay, beat his Eli counterpart
handily in the 200-yd. backstroke,
with a 1:57.9 clocking.
Bettendorf, who scraped his toe
badly in the medley relay, posted
a 1:59.1 to beat teammate Bob
Wilson by three seconds.
The enthusiastic spectators
thrilled to a terrific show of aerial
acrobatics by the still-undefeated
diving tandem of Bill Main and
Ted Nichols. The Stanford duo
swept to victory in both the one
and three-meter diving events,
handily beating Yale's Mike
Donahue and Rick Kincade. Main
won the 1-meter with 301.00
points, and took second place to
Nichols in the 3-meter event, as
Nichols garnered 307.15 points to
Main's 306 25.
Going into the 3-meter diving,
the score stood 47-50 in Yale's
favor. Had Stanford pulled out
two additional points in any of
nine preceding events, the diving
sweep would have been enough to
give the Indians the needed 57
points to win before the final
event, the 400-yd. freestyle relay.
That last event, however,
proved the decider, as a
tremendous last-ditch
performance by the Indian team
of Bebb, Haywood, Eagleston and
Jamison failed to beat the Yale
squad of Nelson, Cadden, Denvir
and Kasting. Bob Kasting's
outstretched arm bridged the gap
of two-tenths of a second
separating him from Jamison
(Yale's time: 3:09.0), giving the
race and the meet to the Elis.
It was a fine performance by a
Yale squad which is ineligible for
the NCAA Championships; it was
a heartbreaker for a great
Stanford squad, minus three top
freshmen performers, which has
USC, UCLA, and nationals still to
go.


SUPER-MAIN-Bill won the low board and Ted won the high board, as

It meant the season to Yale,
and they took it here Saturday,
with the extended right arm of
Bob Kasting.
Before an overflow crowd of
close to 2000 spectators,
including such names as Don
Schollander and Debbie Meyer,
the Yale swimming team handed
Stanford its first loss of the year,
58-55. The score shows a
three-point victory; it does not
show the two-tenths of a second it
took for Bob Kasting, anchorman
on Yale's freestyle relay, to touch
before his counterpart, Stanford's
Bob Jamison. The relay victory
thus gave the meet to Yale, ending
what was a day of upsets and
battles, one of the finest athletic
contests to be seen here this year.
Yale won the first event of the
day, the 400-yd. medley relay,
immediately throwing a wrench
into Stanford's plans. The Indians,
who were counting on a victory
here for both point and
psychological edges, posted the
second-best time in the country,
3:30.6, with the team of Fred
Haywood, Dave Shilling, John
Ferris, and Bob Jamison. The
winning Yale quartet of Ed
Bettendorf, Phil Long, Paul Katz,
and Kasting now holds the
nation's fastest time 3:29.7.

rank among the top dozen in the
nation.
In a most pleasing victory for
Stanford, Bob Jamison beat
Kasting and Eagleston in the 100
free, a tenth off his eighth place
national ranking time of :47.8. It
was a clear win over Kasting, who
posted :48.2, and Eagleston, who
swam a :48.5.
Two outstanding performances
by Stanford's Dave Shilling gave
the sophomore ace the Tribe's
only double victory of the
afternoon. Shilling defeated
teammate John Ferris and Yale's
Brad McKean in the 200-yd.

individual medley in 2:00.2.
Ferris was well off his third place
national time of 1:55.1; the
Stanford Olympian, in
anticipation of his rematch with
Yale butterflier Paul Katz some
20 minutes later, took second in
the IM in 2:02.1.
Shilling also defeated Yale
Olympian Phil Long in the
200-yd. breaststroke, winning the
event in 2:11.1. Two tenths later,
Long established himself as the
nation's 112 o u r th - 112 a s t e st
breaststroker so far, behind
Stanford frosh Brian Job, Shilling,
and Washington's Rick Colella.
Yale's Pete Lawler took third with
2:18.5.
A highlight of the afternoon
was the 200-yd. butterfly, pitting
four of the finest performers from
Yale and Stanford. Unfortunately,
it was not a highlight for Ferris,
who was again upset by Katz; the
Yale tanker posted 1 :56.2 to beat
the popular Stanford butterflier
by four tenths. (Katz' time is
good enough to rank him second
in the country; the nation's fastest
time so far, 1:55.1, is still held by
Ferris.) Third-place Dick Guelff of
Yale posted a 2:00.7 to beat
Stanford's Mike Masarie by close
to four seconds.
Another highly-touted rematch
ended up a little more to
Stanford's liking. Tribe captain
Fred Haywood, who had given an
indication of things to come when
he edged Yale's Ed Bettendorf on
the backstroke leg of the medley
relay, beat his Eli counterpart
handily in the 200-yd. backstroke,
with a 1:57.9 clocking.
Bettendorf, who scraped his toe
badly in the medley relay, posted
a 1:59.1 to beat teammate Bob
Wilson by three seconds.
The enthusiastic spectators
thrilled to a terrific show of aerial
acrobatics by the still-undefeated
diving tandem of Bill Main and
Ted Nichols. The Stanford duo
swept to victory in both the one
and three-meter diving events,
handily beating Yale's Mike
Donahue and Rick Kincade. Main
won the 1-meter with 301.00
points, and took second place to
Nichols in the 3-meter event, as
Nichols garnered 307.15 points to
Main's 306 25.
Going into the 3-meter diving,
the score stood 47-50 in Yale's
favor. Had Stanford pulled out
two additional points in any of
nine preceding events, the diving
sweep would have been enough to
give the Indians the needed 57
points to win before the final
event, the 400-yd. freestyle relay.
That last event, however,
proved the decider, as a
tremendous last-ditch
performance by the Indian team
of Bebb, Haywood, Eagleston and
Jamison failed to beat the Yale
squad of Nelson, Cadden, Denvir
and Kasting. Bob Kasting's
outstretched arm bridged the gap
of two-tenths of a second
separating him from Jamison
(Yale's time: 3:09.0), giving the
race and the meet to the Elis.
It was a fine performance by a
Yale squad which is ineligible for
the NCAA Championships; it was
a heartbreaker for a great
Stanford squad, minus three top
freshmen performers, which has
USC, UCLA, and nationals still to
go.


SUPER-MAIN-Bill won the low board and Ted won the high board, as
Stanford's high-flying divers swept to victory in two events.

It meant the season to Yale,
and they took it here Saturday,
with the extended right arm of
Bob Kasting.
Before an overflow crowd of
close to 2000 spectators,
including such names as Don
Schollander and Debbie Meyer,
the Yale swimming team handed
Stanford its first loss of the year,
58-55. The score shows a
three-point victory; it does not
show the two-tenths of a second it
took for Bob Kasting, anchorman
on Yale's freestyle relay, to touch
before his counterpart, Stanford's
Bob Jamison. The relay victory
thus gave the meet to Yale, ending
what was a day of upsets and
battles, one of the finest athletic
contests to be seen here this year.
Yale won the first event of the
day, the 400-yd. medley relay,
immediately throwing a wrench
into Stanford's plans. The Indians,
who were counting on a victory
here for both point and
psychological edges, posted the
second-best time in the country,
3:30.6, with the team of Fred
Haywood, Dave Shilling, John
Ferris, and Bob Jamison. The
winning Yale quartet of Ed
Bettendorf, Phil Long, Paul Katz,
and Kasting now holds the
nation's fastest time 3:29.7.
Yale's fine Olympic distance
swimmer, John Nelson, breezed to
victory in the 1000-yd. freestyle
over Stanford's Bert Mason and
Mark Shelley. Nelson's 9:53.3 is
now the third-fastest time in the
country. Freshman Tim
Broderick, ineligible to swim in
this meet due to Ivy League rules,
watched as Mason, who has been
coming up with some excellent
performances lately, edged
Shelley for second place by a
second's tenth, 10:10.2.
Nelson also won the 500 free,
but victory here took a little more
effort. Pressed most of the way by
Shelley and Brent Berk, Nelson
managed to beat Berk on the last
of 20 laps, 4:46.7. Yale's Mike
Cadden came from behind to take
the third place.
Cadden won the 200-yd.
freestyle in the nation's third-best
time to date, 1:43.8. Second-place
teammate Jim Denvir beat Berk to
give the Elis a sweep of the event.
The sprint events were a
spectator's delight and a judge's
hell. As predicted, two-tenths of a
second separated the winner from
third place in the 50-yd. free.
Yale's Rich May posted a :21.5
victory over Rick Eagleston and
Bob Bebb of Stanford, who both
went :21.7. Judges gave the
second-place decision to Bebb. All

was the 200-yd. butterfly, pitting
four of the finest performers from
Yale and Stanford. Unfortunately,
it was not a highlight for Ferris,
who was again upset by Katz; the
Yale tanker posted 1 :56.2 to beat
the popular Stanford butterflier
by four tenths. (Katz' time is
good enough to rank him second
in the country; the nation's fastest
time so far, 1:55.1, is still held by
Ferris.) Third-place Dick Guelff of
Yale posted a 2:00.7 to beat
Stanford's Mike Masarie by close
to four seconds.
Another highly-touted rematch
ended up a little more to
Stanford's liking. Tribe captain
Fred Haywood, who had given an
indication of things to come when
he edged Yale's Ed Bettendorf on
the backstroke leg of the medley
relay, beat his Eli counterpart
handily in the 200-yd. backstroke,
with a 1:57.9 clocking.
Bettendorf, who scraped his toe
badly in the medley relay, posted
a 1:59.1 to beat teammate Bob
Wilson by three seconds.
The enthusiastic spectators
thrilled to a terrific show of aerial
acrobatics by the still-undefeated
diving tandem of Bill Main and
Ted Nichols. The Stanford duo
swept to victory in both the one
and three-meter diving events,
handily beating Yale's Mike
Donahue and Rick Kincade. Main
won the 1-meter with 301.00
points, and took second place to
Nichols in the 3-meter event, as
Nichols garnered 307.15 points to
Main's 306 25.
Going into the 3-meter diving,
the score stood 47-50 in Yale's
favor. Had Stanford pulled out
two additional points in any of
nine preceding events, the diving
sweep would have been enough to
give the Indians the needed 57
points to win before the final
event, the 400-yd. freestyle relay.
That last event, however,
proved the decider, as a
tremendous last-ditch
performance by the Indian team
of Bebb, Haywood, Eagleston and
Jamison failed to beat the Yale
squad of Nelson, Cadden, Denvir
and Kasting. Bob Kasting's
outstretched arm bridged the gap
of two-tenths of a second
separating him from Jamison
(Yale's time: 3:09.0), giving the
race and the meet to the Elis.
It was a fine performance by a
Yale squad which is ineligible for
the NCAA Championships; it was
a heartbreaker for a great
Stanford squad, minus three top
freshmen performers, which has
USC, UCLA, and nationals still to
go.


SUPER-MAIN-Bill won the low board and Ted won the high board, as
Stanford's high-flying divers swept to victory in two events.

applauds.
It meant the season to Yale,
and they took it here Saturday,
with the extended right arm of
Bob Kasting.
Before an overflow crowd of
close to 2000 spectators,
including such names as Don
Schollander and Debbie Meyer,
the Yale swimming team handed
Stanford its first loss of the year,
58-55. The score shows a
three-point victory; it does not
show the two-tenths of a second it
took for Bob Kasting, anchorman
on Yale's freestyle relay, to touch
before his counterpart, Stanford's
Bob Jamison. The relay victory
thus gave the meet to Yale, ending
what was a day of upsets and
battles, one of the finest athletic
contests to be seen here this year.
Yale won the first event of the
day, the 400-yd. medley relay,
immediately throwing a wrench
into Stanford's plans. The Indians,
who were counting on a victory
here for both point and
psychological edges, posted the
second-best time in the country,
3:30.6, with the team of Fred
Haywood, Dave Shilling, John
Ferris, and Bob Jamison. The
winning Yale quartet of Ed
Bettendorf, Phil Long, Paul Katz,
and Kasting now holds the
nation's fastest time 3:29.7.
Yale's fine Olympic distance
swimmer, John Nelson, breezed to
victory in the 1000-yd. freestyle
over Stanford's Bert Mason and
Mark Shelley. Nelson's 9:53.3 is
now the third-fastest time in the
country. Freshman Tim
Broderick, ineligible to swim in
this meet due to Ivy League rules,
watched as Mason, who has been
coming up with some excellent
performances lately, edged
Shelley for second place by a
second's tenth, 10:10.2.
Nelson also won the 500 free,
but victory here took a little more
effort. Pressed most of the way by
Shelley and Brent Berk, Nelson
managed to beat Berk on the last
of 20 laps, 4:46.7. Yale's Mike
Cadden came from behind to take
the third place.
Cadden won the 200-yd.
freestyle in the nation's third-best
time to date, 1:43.8. Second-place
teammate Jim Denvir beat Berk to
give the Elis a sweep of the event.
The sprint events were a
spectator's delight and a judge's
hell. As predicted, two-tenths of a
second separated the winner from
third place in the 50-yd. free.
Yale's Rich May posted a :21.5
victory over Rick Eagleston and
Bob Bebb of Stanford, who both
went :21.7. Judges gave the
second-place decision to Bebb. All
three times are fast enough to
rank among the top dozen in the
nation.
In a most pleasing victory for
Stanford, Bob Jamison beat
Kasting and Eagleston in the 100
free, a tenth off his eighth place
national ranking time of :47.8. It
was a clear win over Kasting, who
posted :48.2, and Eagleston, who
swam a :48.5.
Two outstanding performances
by Stanford's Dave Shilling gave
the sophomore ace the Tribe's
only double victory of the
afternoon. Shilling defeated
teammate John Ferris and Yale's
Brad McKean in the 200-yd.

individual medley in 2:00.2.
Ferris was well off his third place
national time of 1:55.1; the
Stanford Olympian, in
anticipation of his rematch with
Yale butterflier Paul Katz some
20 minutes later, took second in
the IM in 2:02.1.
Shilling also defeated Yale
Olympian Phil Long in the
200-yd. breaststroke, winning the
event in 2:11.1. Two tenths later,
Long established himself as the
nation's 112 o u r th - 112 a s t e st
breaststroker so far, behind
Stanford frosh Brian Job, Shilling,
and Washington's Rick Colella.
Yale's Pete Lawler took third with
2:18.5.
