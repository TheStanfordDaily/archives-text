# Two Big Factors: Katz and the Relays
## 
### FRED MANN 
Jim Gaughran sat silently in the
small round swimming office, feet
from the Encina pool. Dark
glasses hid the lines of fatigue and
depression. The always smiling
and confident lawyer-turned
couch had lost the big one by
inches, and the boyish grin was,
for the time being, conspicuously
absent.
Fred Haywood, the team
captain, entered the room.
"Bummer, coach."
"Yeah, bummer Freddie."
Gaughran smiled a little and
slowly went through the ritual
torture of answering stupid
questions from equally stupid
sports writers.
"We just fell short," he said.
"Ferris was sick all week, and he
just couldn't make it back to help
us like we hoped he would. We
knew we would have to win one
of the relays. They peaked and
just barely beat us. We would have
won with our freshmen—there's
no doubt about that."
The phrases tumbled out. They
all were true. In fact, they were
the keys to understanding the
meet. But Gaughran's heart just
wasn't in it. His thoughts
wandered from race to race—the
tenths of seconds here, the poor
starts there. He made no excuses.
He just sat quietly.
Reporters left. Even the most
personable and quotable of the
Stanford coaches needs to be left
alone at times.
It was a disappointing finish to
a potentially great day for
Stanford fans. The stands were
packed with large numbers of
rooters for both sides. Every aisle
disappeared under the rears of
those who came too late to find
seats.
The rain and cold that the
Stanford swimming brass had
hoped for did not materialize.
Instead, the sun blazed down on
the full house, and the 250 Yale
partisans made their presence
known, loudly cheering their Elis
with constant "Bulldog, bulldog,
Bow-wow-wow's". One set of
Yale alums spent all afternoon
predicting every finish, reminiscing
about their days in the water of
Yale's Payne Witney Gym, and
generally reminding themselves of
the importance of an Ivy
education.
The Stanford band played, 75
people clung to nearby rooftops
to avoid the $3.00 ticket price,
and Jim Gaughran's brother got in
some good digs as P.A. announcer.
The battle began. Gaughran and
Yale's Phil Moriarty both spurred
their teams in their own ways.
The Yale mentor constantly paced
the sidelines in his olive suit. He
was a daper Easterner who
fathered his boys with constant
pep talks, slaps on the back, and
screams. During the race, Moriarty
is a vision of reserved panic. He is

energetic, excitable, and effective.
Gaughran uses a different style
of coaching. Appearing outwardly
active in his shirt sleeves and
Adidas, he wins his meets quietly.
Standing near the team bench, he
encourages individually. He stands
and studies. And wins.
Just as the coaching styles
differed, so did the reactions of
the crowd during the afternoon.
The thrilling win by Yale in the
opening medley relay had fans
screaming from the outset.
Moments later, in the long 1,000
the crowd shifted to mumbles and
silence.
With Stanford behind all day
(until the next to last event), the
majority of people remained
guarded in their yelling, and
cautious in their optimism.
Red hots from both sides
handicapped every event, and
doped out the final score before
the first race. Once a year
swimming fans were exposed in
the company of pool regulars.
(You can always tell the
dedication of a swim fan by the
number of buttons on his
stopwatch.)
As Bob Kasting touched the
side and won the final relay, the
afternoon was over for the 2,000
spectators. It was close, but not
enough for Stanford.
For the coaches, it was time to
check the script and see what
went wrong or, surprisingly, right.
"In our most pessimistic
speculation," said Moriarty, "we
gave Stanford the medley relay
(the first event). When we won
that, it was a great lift. Katz was
able to cope with Ferris. It was a
turning point."
Paul Katz had his own
confessions to make. "I went all
out in the first relay," commented
the Yale star, "and I figured I'd
give up in the butterfly against
Ferris. But when the race started,
I felt good, and decided to go for
the win. I did it."
For Gaughran, the reasons for
the loss were clear — a sick star
(Ferris), a crucial loss in the first
event, the ineligibility of his
freshmen stars (who figured to be
good for 13 points), and Yale's
peaking for the meet.
With no NCAA championships
to aim for, the Elis pointed for
the big intersectional meet here.
"But what about next week?"
came the question. The Gaughran
grin came back. Another big
challenge lay directly ahead— USC
and UCLA, back to back.
"Well, both teams will be
waiting for us," he said. "Just like
Yale. But we'll be ready for them
too."
The phone rang. Gaughran
answered. He listened, smiled, and
sighed. "Yes, 58-55. . .yeah, we
tried. . .we'll get USC next week."
It had been a disappointing
day, but the gloom was already
beginning to clear.
