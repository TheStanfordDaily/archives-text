# The 						Pain and the Glory

### 
(Editor's note: Doug Wilson, Daily swimming
writer, was an official judge at Saturday's meet,
and recounts here his impressions from that
van tage.)
Fred Haywood was lying on his back, by the
ladder next to the judges' bench on the south side
of Encina pool, breathing heavily after his leg of
the freestyle relay. He looked around almost
disinterestedly, oblivious to the noise of the
crowd, which was hard to be oblivious to.
The crowd was, to a man, on its feet; I
wondered how long Kasting and Jamison were to
match each other, stroke for stroke. As they came
in, I leaned over the ladder and Haywood, watched
Kasting's hand take it all away, and marked "2"
on my judge's place card for Stanford, turned in
the cards, and wondered how I could write
anything about this meet.
Then I looked around in front of me. Bob Bebb
was sprawled exhausted on the red-topped
equipment box, as was Rick Eagleston. Haywood
was still by the ladder. Coach Jim Gaughran knelt
by Lane 4 where Bob Jamison, unmindful of
Yale's John Nelson posed happily on a nearby
starting block flashing the victory sign, lingered in
the water.
Jamison's face was the most interesting; it was
drained of energy, and the eyes conveyed the
frustration of a swimmer and a team which having
given everything, had no more to give. I assume it
would have been the look in the eyes of Bob
Kasting if two tenths of a second had gone the
other way.
I imagine that the reporters from the Chronicle
and the Times, armed as they were with press
releases, left happily with a quote or two from
someone, and Sports Illustrated will revel in the
Eli's second straight victory over Stanford.

Somehow, a quote didn't seem like the right thing
to go for at the moment; I wonder if the rest of
the press would have had the same opinion
watching from the judges' bench.
I wonder if they could feel Jim Morris' hurt on
the last 50 of the 200-yd. breaststroke, the strain
you could see in his shoulders. Or Brent Berk's
disappointment mirrored in his grimace as he
finished second to Nelson in the 500; I wonder if
Berk knew what a fine performance that was, what
a fine comeback after being upset in the 200.
Or the glory. The pleasure of Haywood's
backstroke win. The smiles on the faces of the
timers and the judges and the followers for Dave
Shilling's win in the individual medley, and again
in the breaststroke. The tremendous performance
of the freestyler Bob Bebb. I sat next to a
fraternity brother of divers Bill Main and Ted
Nichols, and watched him carefully record each
diving score as Jim Gaughran's brother read them
off, and watched the beauty and grace and
precision of Nichols and Main translated into
higher and higher penciled numbers. And Clyde
Devine's obvious satisfaction. And the hands of
the divers clasped in congratulations as the crowd
roared.
And I wonder how many people knew about
John Ferris' bout with the flu the week before this
meet. And I wonder if Paul Katz knows that he
was outclassed even in victory.
And I wonder most of all if anybody else
besides the timers and judges and followers and
teammates felt the very special pride of Jamison's
victory in the 100.
Yale swam more than a good meet. But the
story isn't in the score by a long shot.
I just got the press credentials for the UCLA
meet. We're gonna kill 'em.
