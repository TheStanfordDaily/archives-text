# Golfers Crush Santa Clara
## 
### 
Coach Bud Finger's golfers
opened their 1970 campaign
Saturday with a convincing 44-10
win over the University of Santa
Clara.
The Indians won all but one of
the six matches and swept the
three best-ball categories en route
to the victory. Stanford's Tom
Watson turned in the best round
of the day with a 72 over the
rugged Stanford course.
Watson picked up six points by
defeating his SC opponent Tony
Wilmer by three strokes. The
Tribe's number one man did this
despite taking a double bogey on
18 after losing a ball to the right.
Number two man Bruce
Doering shot a 75 to edge his
opponent Paul Shimmin of SC,
who fired an 81. In what Finger
described as an extremely unusual

occurence, Watson, Doering and
Wilmer all picked up two-under
par eagles while playing together
on the seventh hole, a par-5 535
yarder.
In other matches, Gary Vanier's
76 gave him a two stroke edge
over SC's Ray Bryum, but the
Cards' Tom Gurnee skied to an 84
and lost to Santa Clara's Joe
Deßrivn by four strokes. The best
ball result went to the Indians,
6-0.
In the day's final rounds,
Stanford's Bob Burns (83) and
Clem Richardson (75) beat their
opponents, taking the best ball
competition, too.
In freshman matches, the
Indians beat Menlo College 31-23

on Friday, then overwhelmed a
team from San Francisco's George
Washington High School
Saturday, 53-1.
The varsity gets back into
action Friday against Cal State at
Hayward on the Sunol Golf
Course. Then, on Saturday and
Sunday its the San Francisco City
Championships at Harding Park.
