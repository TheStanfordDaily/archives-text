## Vandals Raid GE Offices

WASHINGTON (AP) - Vandals
raided General Electric Co. offices
in Washington over the weekend,
apparently part of a coordinated
protest against the Vietnam war.
Papers were strewn about the
floors of the General Electric
offices, but a company spokesman
said sensitive materials were
undisturbed and that nothing
appeared to have been stolen.
The vandalism was discovered
Sunday by policy and GE officials
after reporters received
anonymous tips.
"Today we have entered the
GE office in Washington and have
liberated and destroyed files of
the GE corporation," an
anonymous caller told The
Associated Press.
"We are the same group of
people who last night destroyed
draft files in Philadelphia, Pa. We
have taken this action to disrupt
functioning of the machine of
death and oppression - draft files
which conscript men to kill and
the files of GE, the nation's
second leading producer of
armament for the United States
government."
Police in Philadelphia said three
Selective Service offices were
vandalized Saturday and two
persons were arrested. Authorities
declined to speculate whether the
events in the two cities were
related. The vandals struck the
ninth and eleventh floors of the
GE offices where most of the
firm's Washington operations are
centered.
FBI agents also entered the
investigation.
Panther Raids
SEATTLE, Wash. (AP) - Mayor
Wes Uhlman says he turned down
a federal proposal for a raid on
Black Panther headquarters in
Seattle because he did not want to
popularize the Panthers' cause. He
also said such raids smack of
"Gestapo type" tactics.
Uhlman, 34, who has been in
office only two months, said a
federal law enforcement agency
asked for city participation in an
"information gathering" raid on
Panther headquarters a month
ago. The raid did not take place.
In a weekend interview,
Uhlman criticized the tactics of
some other cities in raids on
Panthers and said "a great many
people are having second thoughts
about midnight Gestapo type
raids."

Police raided Panther
headquarters in Chicago Dec. 4,
killing two Panther leaders. A
coroner's jury ruled the deaths
justifiable homicide. A Los
Angeles police raid on Panther
headquarters resulted in the
wounding of three policemen and
two Panthers. Police seized arms
and ammunition in both cities.
Uhlman's administration is
under considerable public pressure
because of 18 unsolved terrorist
bombings in Seattle in the past
seven months.
"The easy-answer thinkers say
we can eliminate the bombings by
eliminating the Panthers,"
Uhlman said. "We're been taking a
lot of pressure to act
precipitously, but we're going to
withstand the pressure and do it
the right way."
Police have not publicly
connected the Panthers in any
way with the bombings.

Alaska Blasts
VICTORIA, B.C. (AP) - A British
Columbia conservationist group
says it plans to charter a boat in
an effort to "blockade" any
future underground nuclear
explosions on Alaska's Amchitka
Island.
"Something must be done to
stop the Americans from their
insane ecological vandalism,"
declared James Bohlen,

educational officer of the Sierra
Club of British Columbia.
Bohlen announced Saturday
the vessel will be equipped with
radiation detection gear and will
go into the blast zone prior to the
next scheduled nuclear test. And
if the Americans want to go ahead
with the test, he said, "they'll
have to tow us out."
Bohlen said the blockade will
be part of a protest against the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's
recently announced intention to
conduct further underground tests
on the desolate Aleutian Island.
No date has been set, but the AEC
said the next test will be about
three times more powerful than
the explosion on the island last
October, which was equal to one
megaton or a million tons of TNT.

Alaska Blasts
VICTORIA, B.C. (AP) - A British
Columbia conservationist group
says it plans to charter a boat in
an effort to "blockade" any
future underground nuclear
explosions on Alaska's Amchitka
Island.
"Something must be done to
stop the Americans from their
insane ecological vandalism,"
declared James Bohlen,

educational officer of the Sierra
Club of British Columbia.
Bohlen announced Saturday
the vessel will be equipped with
radiation detection gear and will
go into the blast zone prior to the
next scheduled nuclear test. And
if the Americans want to go ahead
with the test, he said, "they'll
have to tow us out."
Bohlen said the blockade will
be part of a protest against the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's
recently announced intention to
conduct further underground tests
on the desolate Aleutian Island.
No date has been set, but the AEC
said the next test will be about
three times more powerful than
the explosion on the island last
October, which was equal to one
megaton or a million tons of TNT.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Vandals
raided General Electric Co. offices
in Washington over the weekend,
apparently part of a coordinated
protest against the Vietnam war.
Papers were strewn about the
floors of the General Electric
offices, but a company spokesman
said sensitive materials were
undisturbed and that nothing
appeared to have been stolen.
The vandalism was discovered
Sunday by policy and GE officials
after reporters received
anonymous tips.
"Today we have entered the
GE office in Washington and have
liberated and destroyed files of
the GE corporation," an
anonymous caller told The
Associated Press.
"We are the same group of
people who last night destroyed
draft files in Philadelphia, Pa. We
have taken this action to disrupt
functioning of the machine of
death and oppression - draft files
which conscript men to kill and
the files of GE, the nation's
second leading producer of
armament for the United States
government."
Police in Philadelphia said three
Selective Service offices were
vandalized Saturday and two
persons were arrested. Authorities
declined to speculate whether the
events in the two cities were
related. The vandals struck the
ninth and eleventh floors of the
GE offices where most of the
firm's Washington operations are
centered.
FBI agents also entered the
investigation.
Panther Raids
SEATTLE, Wash. (AP) - Mayor
Wes Uhlman says he turned down
a federal proposal for a raid on
Black Panther headquarters in
Seattle because he did not want to
popularize the Panthers' cause. He
also said such raids smack of
"Gestapo type" tactics.
Uhlman, 34, who has been in
office only two months, said a
federal law enforcement agency
asked for city participation in an
"information gathering" raid on
Panther headquarters a month
ago. The raid did not take place.
In a weekend interview,
Uhlman criticized the tactics of
some other cities in raids on
Panthers and said "a great many
people are having second thoughts
about midnight Gestapo type
raids."

Police raided Panther
headquarters in Chicago Dec. 4,
killing two Panther leaders. A
coroner's jury ruled the deaths
justifiable homicide. A Los
Angeles police raid on Panther
headquarters resulted in the
wounding of three policemen and
two Panthers. Police seized arms
and ammunition in both cities.
Uhlman's administration is
under considerable public pressure
because of 18 unsolved terrorist
bombings in Seattle in the past
seven months.
"The easy-answer thinkers say
we can eliminate the bombings by
eliminating the Panthers,"
Uhlman said. "We're been taking a
lot of pressure to act
precipitously, but we're going to
withstand the pressure and do it
the right way."
Police have not publicly
connected the Panthers in any
way with the bombings.

bombings in Seattle in the past
seven months.
"The easy-answer thinkers say
we can eliminate the bombings by
eliminating the Panthers,"
Uhlman said. "We're been taking a
lot of pressure to act
precipitously, but we're going to
withstand the pressure and do it
the right way."
Police have not publicly
connected the Panthers in any
way with the bombings.

Alaska Blasts
VICTORIA, B.C. (AP) - A British
Columbia conservationist group
says it plans to charter a boat in
an effort to "blockade" any
future underground nuclear
explosions on Alaska's Amchitka
Island.
"Something must be done to
stop the Americans from their
insane ecological vandalism,"
declared James Bohlen,

educational officer of the Sierra
Club of British Columbia.
Bohlen announced Saturday
the vessel will be equipped with
radiation detection gear and will
go into the blast zone prior to the
next scheduled nuclear test. And
if the Americans want to go ahead
with the test, he said, "they'll
have to tow us out."
Bohlen said the blockade will
be part of a protest against the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's
recently announced intention to
conduct further underground tests
on the desolate Aleutian Island.
No date has been set, but the AEC
said the next test will be about
three times more powerful than
the explosion on the island last
October, which was equal to one
megaton or a million tons of TNT.
