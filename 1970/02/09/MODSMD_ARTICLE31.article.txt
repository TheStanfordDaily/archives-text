# The 						Top 10

### 
(Editor's note: The following
poll includes the votes of 15 1M
referees and officials who, blind as
they may be, are non-partial and
have seen many of the teams to
get a fair evaluation. It compares
almost exactly with the polls
received from Madame La
Rouche, the Menlo Park psychic,
and George Zippo, the Golden
Gate Pari: Soothsayer. The pool
will become a regular feature
brought to you once a week by
your friendly Daily red-hots.)
