Apologies to those of the JUNIOR FACULTY
who came to Saturday night's party, only to find
that the band was too loud for talking: we had
expected to have two rooms. Next time, let's get
together at somebody's house. If people bring
things, the expense needn't be a problem. Friday
afternoon sherry in people's backyards? If you
have any ideas or simply wish to express an
interest, please call Mary Wakeman (Humanities)
x 3322.
