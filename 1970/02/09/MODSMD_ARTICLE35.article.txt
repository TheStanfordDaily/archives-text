# Fake Sex Survey
## 
### 
A telephone "sex survey"
which has "absolutely no
connection" with Stanford has
caused three complaints to the
University in the last few days,
according to Frederic O. Glover,
executive assistant to President
Pitzer.
The three women who called to
complain said the anonymous
male caller claimed to be working
for the "Palo Altoâ€”Stanford
Kensey survey" and asked them
personal questions, said Glover.
Prof. Richard C. Atkinson,
chairman of the Psychology

-
Department, said, "No reputable
psychologist or sex survey worker
handles such questions over the
phone." Glover agreed and said
the University is asking women
receiving any similar calls in the
future to report them to the
Stanford Police Department.
Stanford Research Institute
received similar complaints last
week and also denied any
connection with such a "survey."
Glover commented that similar
problems have occurred off and
on in the past but that this was
the first incident at Stanford this
year.
