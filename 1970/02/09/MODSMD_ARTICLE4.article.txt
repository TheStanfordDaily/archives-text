# Military Charged With Saturation Defoliation

### JOHN COONROD 
Military field commanders in
Vietnam request even more
defoliation of the landscape than
can now be done, a University of
Washington zoologist told a
Chemical and Biological Warfare
Forum at Stanford this weekend.
The zoologist, Prof. Gordon
Orians, who inspected the
defoliation program in the war,
said the United States defoliates
enemy rice crops, all the forest
along borders, roads, rivers, and
the DMZ, and other vast areas of
forest land.
He said approximately 1.6
million acres are defoliated each
year; this includes between 15 and
20 percent of the forests. In
particular, Mangrove forests are
killed with one dose, and Orians
sees no sign of regeneration in
them.
"Ecological damage includes
the loss of forests, animal shelters,
and soil erosion or poisoning," he
said. Regularly a defoliation plane
has trouble, he said, and it dumps
its 1000 gallon load of 245t, the
herbicide used, in 28 seconds.
The herbicide 245t is highly
dangerous and its producers have
concealed this fact, charged Prof.
L.A. Herzenberg of the genetics
department. He said 245t has
caused malformed fetuses, and
both Dow and Monsanto have led
to periodically stop production
because of skin eruptions it causes
in production employees.
"The army recognized that
24 5t was chemical warfare
because they sought presidential
permission to use it," Herzenberg
said.
He added that this information
would not necessarily have
become public if it hadn't been
discovered by Ralph Nader, the
consumer watchdog.
Four Week Expert
One panel member who served
in the Army Chemical Corps in
Vietnam was considered an expert
in the use of herbicides after a
four-week course. He said this
lack of expertise in the Army
forced it to take a simplistic view,
and ignore ecological
consequences.

The Forum, "an outgrowth of
an outgrowth" of the April Third
Movement, brought together
experts on both sides whose
discussions ranged from Vietnam
to domestic police actions. It was
sponsored by the Life Sciences
Caucus.
Attendance at the panel
discussions, and at four informal
discussions held Friday, varied
from 20 to 60. As far as turnout
was concerned, said Dale Hattis,
forum coordinator, "It was a total
debacle. I wanted to fill Mem
Chu." He said that President
Nixon's December statement
concerning CBW had successfully
"turned down people's hearing
aids" to dissent.
Lederberg's Views
Nixon's statement was the
topic of both a panel and informal
discussion. The panel, Prof.
Joshua Lederberg of the Stanford
Genetics department, and Dr.
Victor Sidel of New York's
Montefiore Hospital and Medical
Center, spoke of the necessity for
the "opening" of biological
research institutes, the protecting
of the Geneva Protocal, and
scientists' not permitting secret
life science study. In December,
Nixon disavowed bio-warfare
research and requested that the
Senate ratify the 1925 Geneva
Protocol forbidding the use of
CBW agents.
Lederberg added, though, that
Nixon explicitly stated that
herbicide defoliants and teargas,
chemical agents currently used by
the U.S. in Vietnam, would not be
included in this ban. Further, he
said, it is "understood" among the
contracting powers, that the
protocol prohibits first use of
CW, so that nations may still
have such weapons for retaliation.
Although the U.S. signed the
protocol, it never ratified it and
remains the only major power not
to.
Sidel stated that the U.N.
General Assembly passed a
proclamation declaring that the
Geneva agreement did include tear
gas and herbicides. Only Australia,
Portugal, and the U.S. voted
against the proposal, he said.

Lederberg discussed the
problems of restricting CBW
research. A blanket ban on
studying the amino acid sequence
of certain toxins, for example,
would hurt health research.
Producing toxins requires growing
microbes, which becomes
automatic biological warfare
research. He suggested that
instead of banning such research,
more of it should be done, but
openly and internationally. He
called it "fear reducing" research,
and the lack of secrecy would
keep it from being militarily
strategic. "It is easy to have
secrecy, but difficult to keep
secrecy secret."
Sidel siad that there is no way
to distinguish between offensive
and defensive biological research.
He felt that the Geneva Protocol
is an important document, and
that the Senate ought to be
pressured to ratify it without the
President's reservations. If they
retain them, he said, they will
effectively destroy the Geneva
Protocol.
Earlier Saturday the first panel,
"Police Policies on Chemical
Agents," heard Lt. James Curran,
head of the San Francisco Police
Tactical Squad, outline his group's
policies. Tear gas (CN or CS)
could only be authorized by a
Lieutenant or Captain, only
sergeants and up could carry
cannisters of Mace. "But in some
police departments, you see
everybody packing Mace," he
added. He said that the chemical
agents were the most humane way
of controlling mobs or indivduals.
Mace Promotes Cancer
Prof. Sumner Kalman, of the
Pharmacology department, said
that the police who carried Mace
were endangering themselves and
their victims, as the Mace^ active
ingredients, Chloroacetophenone
is allergenic, mutagenic, and in
1953 was shown to promote
cancer. There could be a
possibility of genetic damage.
Kalman added that the chemicals
had not replaced billyclubsâ€”if
anything, the clubs and their
wielders were more frequent.
Steve Ela, of the Pacific Study
Center, said the chemicals are
designed to produce fear in people
who don't have them. That mobs
don't have chemicals, he said,
doesn't mean they won't devise
their own. Prof. J.B. Neilands, of
Berkeley's Biochemistry
department described the use of
such weapons during the People's
Park struggle and said such uses
could escalate to more dangerous
agents.
Floor discussion turned quickly
to who controls the police, and
whether the police should
investigate the root causes of
crime or whether they only
represent force. One woman said
she did not believe she could call
on the police "to apprehend
criminals such as the International
Industrial Conference and the
Chronicle Publishing Co."
Dale Hattis, coordinator ana
contacts chairman for the forum,
sent invitations to many
government workers in CBW, but
none were given clearance to
attend. "The reply from Mel Laird
is something to read," he said.
The forum was taped and will
be broadcast by KZSU and KTAO
in the future.


CBW FORUM - Saturday's Life Sciences Caucus 011 Chemical and Biological
Warfare heard Prof. George Orians of the University of Wasliington charge that
U.S. field commanders in the Vietnam war are ordering more defoliants than
can be handled. Other participants included Stanford's Joshua Lederberg and
Dr. Victor Sidel of New York's Montefiore Hospital.
