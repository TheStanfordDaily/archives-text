# Pub Board To Meet Tuesday On â€˜Arena'
## 
### JOHN ECKHOUSE 
The continuing confrontation
between The Arena and
Stanford's student government
will more to new battle grounds
Tuesday afternoon before the
Publications Board.
In a resolution last Thursday,
the Student Senate demanded
that the Board investigate the
Arena to determine if the paper
was violating the by-laws of the
Associated Students. The Daily
learned yesterday that such action
had already been planned by Tom
Dawson, chairman of the
Publications Board, in response to
a request from Student Financial
Manager David Swift.
Swift had come under fire for
his handling of student funds in
an article appearing in last week's
Arena. Harvey Hukari, the editor,
denied that the article was
designed to attack Swift, whom
he called "probably the most
competent man around the ASSU
offices."
He viewed the story as an
attempt to put the Roger Reed
affair in its proper perspective.
Reed was earlier censured by the
Senate for spending ASSU funds
without the authorization of the
Student Financial Manager.
The Financial Manager
responded to the Arena's
allegations by informing the
Senate that the newspaper has
broken almost every rule in the
by-laws concerning publications.
In calling for an investigation,

Swift wants the Arena to either
declare itself an off-campus
organization and request approval
from the Board for on-campus
distribution of their product or to
register as a student organization
with the Dean of Students.
List Advertisers
If Hukari registers the paper as
an on-campus group, Dawson says
the by-laws compel it to list its
potential advertisers and its ad
salesmen. The Arena would not
have to declare the names of its
donors whose contributions
enable the paper to exist. Hukari
is quite reluctant to release these
names.
What will happen at Tuesday'
meeting is unclear. Dawson says
that "if they do fall under our
rules, as they certainly seem to,
we will ask them to register with
the Publications Board." He
added that he expected Hukari
would register as long as he does
not have to release the
information about his paper's
donors.
Hukari indicated that the
activity at the meeting might not
be so simple. He declined to say
what his organization would do,
since "we are still discussing the
matter among the staff of the
Arena."
Some surprises are in store,
however. Even Hukari mentioned
that he had heard "rumors of a
festival of liberation from the
anarchist fringe" of his staff.
"We don't want to place

ourselves under any regulation of
ASSU. We don't want to register
or to bank with the ASSU or to
halt our advertising."
Political Repression
Contending that this incident is
a further example of political
repression on the part of the
Senate, Hukari claims that "the
whole ASSU structure is moving
to the right." In addition, he
asserts that this action is
"politically motivated" because of
its timing. The Arena had
published for two years without
incident, though it had never
registered with the Publications
Board.
Both Dawson and Swift deny
Hukari's allegations. "We are not
the tools of SDS," says Dawson.
"We both have conservative
reputations." He related that
although "some people did
question it last year," he has been
chairman only since this fall.
"I'm not omniscient, I can't see
everything that is going on,"
stated Swift.

broken almost every rule in the
by-laws concerning publications.
In calling for an investigation,

Swift wants the Arena to either
declare itself an off-campus
organization and request approval
from the Board for on-campus
distribution of their product or to
register as a student organization
with the Dean of Students.
List Advertisers
If Hukari registers the paper as
an on-campus group, Dawson says
the by-laws compel it to list its
potential advertisers and its ad
salesmen. The Arena would not
have to declare the names of its
donors whose contributions
enable the paper to exist. Hukari
is quite reluctant to release these
names.
What will happen at Tuesday'
meeting is unclear. Dawson says
that "if they do fall under our
rules, as they certainly seem to,
we will ask them to register with
the Publications Board." He
added that he expected Hukari
would register as long as he does
not have to release the
information about his paper's
donors.
Hukari indicated that the
activity at the meeting might not
be so simple. He declined to say
what his organization would do,
since "we are still discussing the
matter among the staff of the
Arena."
Some surprises are in store,
however. Even Hukari mentioned
that he had heard "rumors of a
festival of liberation from the
anarchist fringe" of his staff.
"We don't want to place

ourselves under any regulation of
ASSU. We don't want to register
or to bank with the ASSU or to
halt our advertising."
Political Repression
Contending that this incident is
a further example of political
repression on the part of the
Senate, Hukari claims that "the
whole ASSU structure is moving
to the right." In addition, he
asserts that this action is
"politically motivated" because of
its timing. The Arena had
published for two years without
incident, though it had never
registered with the Publications
Board.
Both Dawson and Swift deny
Hukari's allegations. "We are not
the tools of SDS," says Dawson.
"We both have conservative
reputations." He related that
although "some people did
question it last year," he has been
chairman only since this fall.
"I'm not omniscient, I can't see
everything that is going on,"
stated Swift.
The continuing confrontation
between The Arena and
Stanford's student government
will more to new battle grounds
Tuesday afternoon before the
Publications Board.
In a resolution last Thursday,
the Student Senate demanded
that the Board investigate the
Arena to determine if the paper
was violating the by-laws of the
Associated Students. The Daily
learned yesterday that such action
had already been planned by Tom
Dawson, chairman of the
Publications Board, in response to
a request from Student Financial
Manager David Swift.
Swift had come under fire for
his handling of student funds in
an article appearing in last week's
Arena. Harvey Hukari, the editor,
denied that the article was
designed to attack Swift, whom
he called "probably the most
competent man around the ASSU
offices."
He viewed the story as an
attempt to put the Roger Reed
affair in its proper perspective.
Reed was earlier censured by the
Senate for spending ASSU funds
without the authorization of the
Student Financial Manager.
The Financial Manager
responded to the Arena's
allegations by informing the
Senate that the newspaper has
broken almost every rule in the
by-laws concerning publications.
