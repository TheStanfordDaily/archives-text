# In Search Of The 'Real S.D.S.'
## Favoring A Campus Worker-Student Alliance 
### Doug Hogan 
Last Wednesday night, a
meeting of Stanford Students for
a Democratic Society was called,
because the Worker-Student
Alliance Caucus and other
members of SDS felt that
Stanford SDS had no real
direction at that point, and that it
was not taking stands on issues
that USA felt could not be
overlooked, such as ecology and
ROTC. We also felt that an elitist
atmosphere had developed at SDS
meetings which prevented new
people from contributing.
Although we believe that new,
critical opinions are extremely
important for the development of
the organization, these opinions
were never allowed to be
expressed.
A split occurred when a faction
composed largely of the
"Revolutionary" Union
"expelled" the Worker-Student
Alliance Caucus. We were
"expelled" from Stanford SDS
mainly for charges which Bruce
Franklin of the "Revolutionary"
Union ("R"U) levelled against the
Progressive Labor Party (PLP). It
is true that many members of
WSA hold certain PLP positions,
but we do not feel that agreement
on these points is necessary for
unity within SDS. Even if people
hold different positions, we feel
they should still be able to work
within the framework of a mass
student organization, membership
of which is not determined by
what organizations you support or
do not support.
However, we were not even
given the chance to debate these
positions. Members of "R"U
declared that PLP and WSA had
been expelled from Stanford SDS
last summer (when a large part of
SDS was gone). The fact that they
did not even mention this until
last Wednesday reveals Franklin's
opportunismâ€”he would not
debate us on political grounds,

but resorted to organizational
tricks.
The split at Stanford is a
reflection of the split last June at
the SDS national convention in
Chicago, when the
"Revolutionary'' Youth
Movement (RYM) tried to expel
the Progressive Labor Party and
WSA. RYM's attempts failed in
June because the majority of SDS
members felt that PLP and WSA
had greatly helped SDS by
consistently fighting for
pro-working class politics. When
their move failed, RYM walked
out, representatives of "R"U and
Stanford SDS included. Since that
time, RYM has split into

Weathermen and RYM 2, and has
fallen apart nationally. The
impotence of Stanford SDS this
year reflects this decay.
National Not a Front
SDSers who are members of
WSA feel that there is only one
national organization that is
continuing the work of the old
SDS, and that is National SDS,
with its headquarters in Boston.
This organization is a
non-exclusionary, anti-imperialist,
anti-racist, pro-working class
student movement. National SDS
consists of the people who did not
walk out at the convention,
including members of PLP, WSA
the Sparticist League, and others.

It is not, as Bruce Franklin says, a
front for PLP, although PLP is
respected for the progressive
leadership which it has given SDS.
The need for this type of
national organization has been
demonstrated by the events of
this year. The Weathermen have
become an enemy of the people.
They denounce the American
working class as bought off and
reactionary, and say that it must
be destroyed with the rest of
imperialist America. The militant
GE strike has clearly shown that
this idea is invalid. The
Weathermen's analysis has led to
such "revolutionary" actions as
"jail-breaks," in which they

disrupt schools, and beat up
teachers and students who do not
follow their orders.
RYM 2 has fallen into the trap
of "counter institutions." They
raise such issues as community
control of police and student
control over curriculum (basically
a student power issue). The
problem with these demands is
that they are in reality unwinable,
and they raise the illusion that
people can share state power with
the ruling class. It has become
evident through the struggles in
Vietnam, Thailand, the
Dominican Republic, Watts,
Berkeley, and even here at
Stanford, that the rulers will not
give up anything without a fight,
let alone hand over control of the
police force, which is essential for
keeping oppressed people in line.
Proletariat Struggle
While Weathermen and RYM 2
have failed, SDS has grown
stronger, and has led struggles this
year at Harvard, Radcliffe, Yale,
Holy Cross, Merritt College,
UCLA, and others. All of these
struggles have been pro-working
class, taking the form of fighting
for the rights of campus workers
(fighting racist wage differentials
and racist firings) or of supporting
the GE strike.
The present Stanford chapter
of SDS is loosely affiliated with
RYM, and if their practice this
year is any indication of their
future, they will probably become
even more isolated from the rest
of the people, and will eventually
fall apart. The Worker-Student
Alliance Caucus believes that if we
want to build an on-going,
pro-working class student
movement, we must form a
Stanford chapter affiliated with
National SDS, centered in Boston.
Membership will be open to
anyone who seriously wants to
fight imperialism and racism by

building ties with the working
class.
Members of WSA feel that the
chief strategy for SDS should be
the campus worker-student
alliance, but we are not opposed
to other issues such as ROTC, as
long as they are fought on a
pro-working class basis. The
strategy of the CWSA is based on
the idea that a movement for any
meaningful social change depends
on the leadership of the workers,
who produce everything in this
society, who create all the wealth
in this society, and who should
share in the wealth they have
produced.
