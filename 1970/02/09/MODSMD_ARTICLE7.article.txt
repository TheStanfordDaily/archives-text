Editor, THE DAILY:
Progressive Labor Party (PL) and
Worker-Student Alliance (WSA) are now trying the
same scab tactics at Stanford that they've been
using nationally for some time. Their latest antic is
an attempted rip-off of the SDS name, and an
effort to set up a rival "SDS" chapter along PL's
counter-revolutionary lines.
We want to make clear that this group does not
represent SDS or have any right whatsoever to the
name SDS. PL-WSA was kicked out of SDS not
only nationally, but twice by the Stanford
chapter: unanimously last summer, and with only
members of PL-WSA and 1 or 2 others opposed in
January.
The reason for the expulsion is that PL-WSA is
objectively counter-revolutionary. They viciously
slander the Black Panther Party; call Ho Chi Minh
a "puppet" and a "traitor," and a part of "the
Hanoi-Washington-Moscow axis"; and refuse to
support North Vietnam, the NLF, or the PRG
(Provisional Revolutionary Government, the only
legitimate government in South Vietnam). This is
while claiming to follow Mao Tse-tung, who says
"In wars of national liberation patriotism
(nationalism) is applied internationalism."
In the Bay Area, PL-WSA turned on the San
Francisco State strike they had helped to build

and denounced it; they sabotaged the militant
anti-GE recruiter demonstration at San Jose State
by holding a counter-demonstration; at the
Pittsburgh-Des Moines steel strike instead of taking
part in the mass demonstration desired by strikers,
they called their own demonstration at another
time; and striking workers threw them off the GE
picket line in San Jose for trying to distribute
anti-union propaganda.
Locally, they are bad-mouthing the April Third
Movement (which practically none of them
happened to be around for), opposing an
anti-imperialist line in the anti-ROTC movement,
and refusing to participate in the New
Moratorium, even scheduling their meetings to
conflict with Moratorium meetings. When
Stanford SDS expelled them, they refused to leave
the meeting and hung around for two hours trying
to provoke a fight, by their noisy disruption
preventing any work from being done at that
meeting.
This is not a revolutionary, anti-imperialist or
even left group, and Stanford SDS utterly
repudiates it.
