# For Unity In The Struggle
## Dissertation On Violence & Unity 
### Marc Sapir 
With a flare for irony, the
Stanford Daily announced this
week its new criteria for
objectivity in reporting. On
Friday the Daily then produced a
masterpiece of "news analysis" on
the New Moratorium chuck full of
rhetoric about force and violence
and how Stanford students had
had enough of it. On page 4 the
Daily also printed a small AP type
blurb that I had been sentenced to
jail for participation in last years
SRI demonstration.
How are these two articles
related? The rather intense
preoccupation of so-called
objective sources on "violence
prone" radicals is an absolute
betrayal of their claim to
objectivity. Almost all actual
violence in this country and in the
entire world today is being
perpetrated by and perpetuated
by the U.S. ruling class and its paid
military armed forces. There is no
denying that leftists, using history
as their basis for understanding,
have concluded that oppression
and exploitation can not be ended
without revolutionary violence.
No one would care to dispute the
fact that the Vietnamese are an
armed people using maximum
revolutionary violence in their
efforts to ward off U.S.
aggression. Who among you would
dare to tell the Vietnamese people
to lay down their arms?
In the United States the
situation is quite similar. The
Black Panther Party for example
has determined to arm the black
people so that they might
adequately defend themselves
against the violence that racism
and capitalism have hung over
their heads. Because of their
beliefs and their successful
organizing of the black people
around important community
issues (including health care, child
care, education, drugs, and armed
self-defense) the Panthers have
had to suffer a wave of
persecution assassination, and
repression.

The same has been true of the
White left, although to a much
lesser degree. The little note about
my jail sentence is the
culmination of 6 years of active
organizing on the Stanford
campus. When we fought the IJB's
overruling of the Judicial Council
in 1967 the Daily seemed to
understand, as Stanford students
did, how the administration was
the representative of coercion and
force. Again in 1968 when the IJB
suspended 7 students, singled out
from an inocuous anti-CIA
demonstration, the Daily and a
large part of the community
understood which side was
inherently coercive.
Necessary Coercion
Most people could understand
the need for the 1968 Union sit-in
as a necessary coercive measure by
the people appropriately applied
against the self-interest of
Stanford's owners and rulers.
Indeed, last year when the issues
were really in terms of the death
and destruction that Stanford's
Trustees were willfully
perpetuating, the student body as
one arose and demanded that
Stanford "lay down its arms."
The arrogant refusal of the
trustees then, to even talk about
the legitimate demands of the
community towards ending the
war against S.E. Asia or Stanford's
role as a big business, big military
operation, was understood by
most people as continued violence
and coercion by the few with
power over the many.
W.P. Fuller's and Pitzer's recent
statements about the importance
of ROTC to the military and to
Stanford's relationship with the
Defense Department are clear
statements of their intention to
wield their raw power in the most
aggressive and militaristic fashion
that the "public" will put up
with. Throughout government and
the ruling class, from Nixon to
Pitzer, there are more and more
bellicose pronouncements that the
left, the anti-war movement, the
forces of progressive change in the
U.S. have been defeated by the

wave of political assasinations and
jailings. This is not true, but it
definitely is helping to frighten
so-called followers and isolate
leaders (i.e., the most persistant
radicals).
These facts relate rather
directly to my jail sentence.
Although a 6-month sentence,
suspended on condition of three
years probation plus 30 days in
jail is, in comparison to what is
happening elsewhere, a light
sentence, this is equivalent to the
maximum sentence for a single
misdemeanor. What is most
disconcerting is the
taken-for-granted attitude that the
Daily article represents and the
intimidated attitude that most
radical students have asserted. For
the benefit of the Daily and those
who no little about the case, I
would point out that I was
arrested 2 months after the
demonstration, charged with little
more than participation (a
"crime" that about 600 people
committed) and got a hung jury
when I pleaded my own case in
September.
Gave Him What They Wanted
ttaving already been through a
similar phoney arrest charge and
lengthy trial in May when I was
one of 8 acquitted from the
Lytton Plaza election night
demonstration, I just couldn't
afford more time off from
medical school to retry the case.
So I gave it to the judge to decide
and got what they have wanted to
give me for a long time â€”not on
the basis of crimes but on the
basis of beliefs.
Most importantly, I want to
answer the fears of those radicals
who "feel sorry for me" or for
themselves as a result of the SRI
trials in general. I think there is
good reason to fear repression,
but the activist who carries out his
personal fears to extreme
hoplessness and defeatism is one
who has faith neither in himself
nor in the people. Such radicals
are poor students of history; they
have been effectively brainwashed
by Max Rafferty and Mark
Mancall.

We must all remember that it
was but 99 years ago that the first
proletarian revolution took place
in Paris. And despite all the
setbacks of Imperialism's great
world wars; of genocide against
the Russians, Poles, and Jews; of
the betrayal of the Russian
people's revolution; of Spain,
Hiroshima, Indonesia, Guatemala,
the Bay of Pigs, Bolivia, Congo
and Vietnam; despite all these
setbacks and more the people
have withstood and progressed
and continued to fight even
harder against colonialism,
imperialism and international
control by the monopoly ruling
class.
Stanfordites Categorized
Many Stanfordites will laugh at
"simplistic and cliche' ridden"
statements by Mao Tse Tung.
Others demand the pat formula
for a socialist utopia. Such people
need not be answered, for anyone
who can not see with their own
eyes the strength, power and
success of existing revolution, like
the Chinese, waged over many
decades and under impossible
conditions will be of little danger
to the people. But those who are
more open minded must examine
the thoughts of Mao carefully.
When Mao says "to be attacked
by the enemy is not a bad thing
but a good thing," he is clarifying
the absurdity of student despair
and uncertainty. That the enemies
of the people dare to openly
assasinate Panthers, is no casual
unimportant fact. That the
government is trying desperately
to wipe out the most advanced
radical thinkers, ideologues, and
activists leaders around the
country is worth thinking about.

Internationally the system is in
a state of near chaos and near
collapse. I am not saying the
system will soon collapse, but a
second or third Vietnam, for
instance could topple the empire.
So too, continued lack of
confidence in the authority of the
ruling class makes a revolutionary
low, 20 or 30 years from now a
distinct possibility. Repression is
therefore not surprising. It
represents the capitalists' first
awareness of the growing
possibility if not inevitability of
socialist revolution. But each
attack allows the people to
consolidate and strengthen their
power if they sieze the
opportunities and do not despair.
Finally, there will always be
those who will desert their own
beliefs (and the truths they have
learned) in the face of
intimidation. Such people can not
be rescued from themselves. They
should not be attacked but pitied,
for they, like many leftists of the
20's and 30's will lose all faith in
the power of unity of purpose and
action. People who have never
experienced the "movement" will
not understand what I mean when
I speak of solidarity, unity, or
collective strength and spirit.
The current factionalism within
the left and the anti-leftist
attitudes being spread by so-called
"liberals and moderates" are born
out of the decadence of American
individualism and capitalist
anti-culture. We have the task of
developing our own socialist
culture and institutions that can
combat all such attitudes among
thy people as well as attack the
ruling class itself.
