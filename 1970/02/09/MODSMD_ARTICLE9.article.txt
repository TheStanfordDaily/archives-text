# Letter To The Editor
## Implication Discussed 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I hesitate to write this letter,
for I should hate to be branded by
Senator Doug McHenry as a
participant in the Arena's
"planned conspiracy to attack the
ASSU." However, the
implications of the Student
Senate's recent actions are serious,
and the Stanford community
should consider whether the
campus climate is conducive to
freedom of political expression
and the vital interchange of views
so necessary to the democratic
process.
Unfortunately, the ASSU
Senate has learned well from the
example set by Spiro Agnew; it,
too, now seeks to stifle the
expression of views which are
critical of its conduct. The Senate

motion to press for an
investigation of the Arena is
blantantly politically motivated.
We have come to expect this type
of action from our national
government, but nonetheless, it is
particularly disturbing to see a
political witchhunt taking place
on the Stanford campus.
Is there any doubt that Roger
Reed is being threatened with
prosecution for his conduct
largely because of his conservative
political ties? Is there any doubt
that the Arena will be
investigated, not because of its
poorly written, mostly distorted
presentation of the news, but
rather because of its conservative
bias and its frequent criticism of
the ASSU Senate?
Furthermore, in fairness to the

Arena, the Student Financial
Manager was entirely wrong when
he asserted before the Senate that
the Law Association does not
have an off-campus bank account.
The Law Association has
maintained, as a convenience to
its financial operations, an
off-campus petty cash fund.
However, the important thing is
not whether David Swift or the
Arena is right; the frightening
element of this recent episode is
the nature of the Student Senate's
response to the situation. It can
only be described as vengeful and
repressive. Are we about to
witness Chicago-style political
trials here on the Stanford
campus?
