# The 						Strange 'Isolation' Of Alcatraz
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
(Editor's note: Last Wednesday, DAILY
reporter Felicity Barringer and photographer Juan
Urrutia visited Alcatraz island, after the Indians'
Mainland Office granted permission to land. The
following is a report of what they saw and felt.)

ALCATRAZ ISLAND — Isolation. About fifty
Indians remain on Alcatraz island in San Francisco
Bay, existing between the strong currents in the
Bay, and the oppressive prison cells standing
empty on the heights of the island.
"There's nothing to do here but fish and
wander around the island,'' said one teen-age
islander, who had come from an Oklahoma
reservation before Christmas. "You can only keep
exploring so long. It can get boring."
The young man was sitting outside a tent
constructed from the trunks of small scrub trees
which grow sparsely on Alcatraz, and from a
tattered tarpulin he took from the landing dock.
He didn't look at either of us, but gazed out over
the water toward Sausalito as he answered a
question.
"No, I'm not going to leave. I'm staying. All
my life, wherever I went, there were always
thousands of whites around me. Every time I left
the reservation to go anywhere, there were always
whites. I didn't always want to look at their faces.
Here I don't have to."
Merv Griffin
The hillock on which he had pitched his tent
lay half-way between the heights of the building
which had housed the prisoners and the wide
courtyard below. In the middle of the courtyard, a
small group of cameramen who had come out to
the island to film a segment of the "Merv Griffin
Show" were wandering around snapping pictures.
In a large gray building to one side of the
courtyard —a building which had once housed the
prison guards and their families —two schools have
been started.
A small child was sleeping alone in one of the
two rooms where the pre-school is held. Four
flights up, one of the founders of the elementary
school was stringing beads behind a door labelled
"Arts and Crafts." "If not a student, please do not
enter without permission," read a notice on the
door to the school room across the hall.
"We have to teach the children the best of the
Indian culture but we have to include the best
parts of other cultures too," Maria Lavender, a
young woman of Polish-Indian ancestry from a
Northern California reservation. With her husband,

she started the pre-school.
"My mother was raised with her grandparents.
They were medicine people, so she is one of the
last medicine people living. There used to be a
practice among Indians, that when a child was
born, the umbilical cord would be tied to a cut in
a sapling tree. This tree then symbolized was the
life-span of that person.
"There's so much of Indian culture to teach. I
want to equip them with Indian culture and
whatever Caucasian culture has to offer. I want to
teach them to create, not destroy.
"They can feel why we're here," she added.
Enrollment at the pre-school has dropped
precipitously, from the fourteen students who
enrolled at the school's opening on January 26 to
a low of three.
"Some of the mothers say that it's not the
Indian way for a child to be inside when he can be
out in nature. But then how is he going to learn?"
she asked.
New Permissiveness
The most regulated feature of the island is its
new schools. Doug Remington, one of the
founders of the elementary school, operates that
establishment with an emphasis on permissiveness,
in contrast to Maria Lavender's philosophy of
education.
"The sun doesn't shine that much this time of
year. When it does, the kids should get a chance to
see it, and to be out in it."
The program of the elementary school is to
study native culture in the morning, and arts and
crafts in the afternoon.
"The kids, for the most part, didn't even know
what tribe they were from. For an Indian, this is
amazing."
"Most of the parents are California Indians,"
he went on to say. "They have been gradually
assimilated."
Remington hopes that the school will continue
through the spring, so that it can be continued on
the mainland in the fall. There is a strong sense of
the isolation which surrounds the Indians' attempt
to reassert their cultural heritage. The news media
have come and, for the most part, gone. Merv
Griffin's visit seemed to be far less in the Indians
interest than in his own.
Outside the school building, a small Indian boy
was happily bouncing a basketball on the cracked,
weed-ridden pavement of the courtyard. Two girls,
each carrying two handfuls of yellow flowers, were
bearing down on Merv Griffin, who surrounded by

young Indians, was beaming before the cameramen on the far side of
the pre-school building.
Gary Bray, a decorated Vietnam veteran who had ridden out on
the boat with us, was taking a little girl up to see the prison cells on
the citadel, and stopped us on the way up to point out the two
turkeys scuffling in the grass on the steep hillside.
Turkeys
"The turkeys got here when I did—right after the occupation
started, in early December. We're going to stay as long as we have to,
too," he said as we walked up the interminable stairs to the prison
proper.
Bray, on the boat-ride to the island, talked briefly of how the
island is now being run. "There's a council that carries out what the
people want to do—except sometimes they just go ahead and act on
their own authority."
A running argument seemed to be going on between various island
authorities—the people, the Council, and the security patrol which
clears all non-Indian visitors to the island.
As we were attempting to embark for the island, an intense man in
an army jacket had broken into a verbal battle with Bray, exclaiming
at one point that the security patrol, in fact any Indian on the island
or on the shore, has the power to revoke our passes.
Whites 'Enemies'
"Don't forget, the whites are all our enemies," he shouted. Bray
had snorted and walked away.
Back on the island, in the prison, two older women were scrubbing
the floors surrounding the small, drab cells, while "I'll never fall in
love again" echoed through the long halls.
Only a very few of the Indians still live in the prison, since the
kitchen was moved down from the citadel to courtyard level. Most
now stay in the guard's quarters around the courtyard.
The isolation, keenly felt by some of the islanders, doesn't seem to
be regarded as a hopeless problem. In time, with greater contact with
the mainland, when more concrete action develops from the sense of
identity that has developed on the island, Remington, Bray and others
seem to feel that what has started on Alcatraz will have far-reaching
effects.
Until that time however, the remaining Indians, captives of their
isolation and the petty divisiveness that eventually permeates <my
group.
But, Bray and the young man didn t seem to have any second
thoughts as they said "I'm staying."
