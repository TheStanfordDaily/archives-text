# 'Festering Hypocrisy'
## Stand Up For ROTC 
### Mike Wolf 
The present campaign against
ROTC is another example of the
festering hypocrisy and
m or a 1 - p o 1 i t i c a 1 myopia
enthusiastically cultivated by the
perverse folkways of modern
academia. The essence of the
anti-ROTC agitation—declared
quite forthrightly by its
proponents—is moral and political
opposition to the functions of the
United States military, in
particular, opposition to the
Vietnam war.
All of the argument about
academic merit, instructor
appointment, contractual
arrangements, etc., is clearly
peripheral and secondary to the
main issue. None of the
disingenuous protest on these
subsidiary structural questions can
obscure the fact that the basic
objection of the anti-ROTC
activists is to the fundamental
purpose of ROTC—the provision
of qualified officers to serve in the
U.S. Armed Forces. It's this
nitty-gritty objection that I'm
going to deal skimpily with here.
The hypocrisy and the mental
confusion I refer to are
characteristic of the familiar
approach of the New Left (and its
professional midwives) to political
issues: simply declare the
controversy to be a moral rather
than a political one, and thus
eliminate altogether the
possibility of compromise or
concession to any other values,
interests, or viewpoints, with no
regard whatsoever for democratic
procedure, majority rule, or civil
rights.
This tactic is fundamentally
authoritarian and destructive of
the liberal values that
open-minded men have struggled
for centuries to establish in our
cultural heritage. It is the epitome
of intolerance, moral, political,
and intellectual. It is a crippling
violation of academic freedom or
any other social freedom.
The essence of tolerance is the
granting to another of the right to
practice values different from
one's own; it is the most
indispensable principle of a free
society. It is the only sure defense
against authoritarianism. The
gravest dereliction of America's
universities (Stanford notably
included) is the abandonment of
the standard of tolerance. That
people around here can clamor for
the suppression of ROTC at the
same time they proclaim their
commitment to academic freedom
is snide intolerance and
hypocrisy.
This is but the tolerance of a
free society —or of a free campus.
I may consider abortions
performed at the Stanford
Medical Center or the

social-political preachings of
Bruce Franklin and his ilk to be
profoundly immoral, yet I don't
demand that these activities cease.
I realize that I cannot in justice or
tolerance impose my moral values
on others. I must tolerate what I
consider to be their immorality, if
I am to expect any Communists
or abortionists to tolerate my
participation in ROTC. A free
society can function only on the
basis of such mutual tolerance.
Now I realize that politics

cannot be separated from notions
of morality. Political decisions are
the outcome of contending value
judgments. What I am arguing is
that politics in a morally
heterogeneous (and liberal)
society cannot be expected to
reflect the moral prescriptions of
merely one particular group.
Military service, the
prosecution of the national
defense, and even the Vietnam
war are presently within the
politically expressed moral

consensus in this society, and well
they should be. The myopia of
the ROTC foes consists in their
understanding neither thy
meaning of this social consensus
nor its wisdom. To try to
enlighten them on the essential
point, I hereby challenge anyone
(or ones) in this University to a
public debate on the social value
of ROTC.
