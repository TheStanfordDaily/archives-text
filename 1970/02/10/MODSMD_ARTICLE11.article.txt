# Women's Liberation
## International Women's Day 
### Carrie Sapir Laura Neese 
The history of International Women's Day
begins in America. On March 8, 1908, on the
lower east side of New York, tired and overworked
women from the factories and mothers from the
slum kitchens came out for mass gatherings to
demonstrate their need for improved working and
living conditions and their right to vote. They
wanted laws to eliminate sweatshops, to clean up
the tenements, for a minimum wage, to end child
labor, and for shorter working hours. Two years
later, in 1910, the International Socialist Congress
accepted a resolution introduced by Clara Zetkin,
Socialist leader from Germany, to make this day
an International Women's Day.
In was on this day in 1917 that women textile
workers of Petrograd went out on strike and thus
began the Russian Revolution. On March 8, 1936,
80,000 Spanish women demonstrated in Madrid
against fascist repression of the people, and in
support of the newly-elected Left democratic
coalition government (in July, Franco took over
and civil war began). March 8, 1938,
demonstrations were held by the Women's
National Salvation Association, attached to the
hospital of the Chinese Red Army then fighting
against Japanese imperialism.
Aggressive Role
These celebrations of International Women's
Day remind us that women can and have taken an
aggressive role in attacking and changing the world
they live in and the society that oppresses them.
Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, the Wobblie militant of
the 20's, Muoi Ly of the Liberation Armed Forces
in Vietnam, and Sister Erika Huggins of the Black
Panther Party are women whose lives affirm the
confidence and fighting spirit of history's great
leaders. These figures of Woman-the-Fighter are
essential to achieving the liberation of women and
all people.
In American today, women interested in
personal liberation are constantly facing the solid
realities of an oppressive society: unfair hiring
practices, sexual exploitation and degradation of
women, low pay, patronizing behavior,
manipulation of women's needs and egos by the
advertising world. And it is becoming obvious that
these realities and others are, in fact, demanded by
the imperialist system which feeds on
exploitation—on profits wrested from the people

who produced them. The war of American
imperialism against millions of struggling
Vietnamese people continues.
Nixon's Role
Nixon's anti-inflation policies are hitting hard
on everyone, especially working people, and
people on welfare. Repression is increasing against
black and brown people, against striking workers,
against anti-war demonstrators, against political
groups that challenge the rising fascism in the
United States. As long as the profit-needs of
businesses and corporations continue to dominate
the world, all these barriers to liberation cannot be
overcome. And women will continue to be used to
sell and to buy; their bodies, their minds and
spirits will be exploited, manipulated and wasted.
Fighting for our personal liberation, for decemt
relationships with men, for equality in the social
and work world, for self-esteem and a meaningful
life, is the same fight as that of the women who
are picking up the gun in Vietnam. It is the fight
to create a socialist society—a society, not based
on private property and profits, in which
non-exploitative personal and political relations
can blossom. Women are major participants in this
act of creation.
Woman Fighter
In the spirit of Woman-the-Fighter, Stanford
Women's Liberation has decided to make
International Women's Day 1970 a major focus for
work on the campus and in the community. Along
with other groups in the Bay Area, we have
planned a large rally in San Francisco at Dolores
Park for Sunday, March 8. Speakers at this rally
will be talking about the positive struggles for
liberation in which they and other women have
taken a major role. Here at Stanford, we are
planning films, literature, speakers, discussion
groups, rallys, and a symposium on child-care—to
raise the issue of women's economic exploitation
and social oppression, to examine its roots in the
economic relationships of American society, to
expose and attack its manifestations on the
campus.
Join us in solidarity with women and peoples
in struggle.
