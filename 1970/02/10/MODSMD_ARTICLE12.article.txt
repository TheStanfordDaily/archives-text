# Taught by Freshman
## Course Studies Gypsy Jewish Mysticism 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Jane Lathrop Stanford
probably never would have
permitted a freshman woman of
grpsy heritage to instruct a class
on Jewish mysticism at the
University.
Yet Nancy Hendrick is doing
just that every Monday night at
Grove House. The course is listed
as Undergraduate Special 150—a
designation covering all Grove
seminars—and deals with the
history, theory and practice of
Cabala, the cult of mysticism and
magic developed by Eastern
European Jews of the Middle
Ages. Thirteen students are
enrolled.
The story behind the course is
as intriguing as its subject matter.
Last quarter a history colloquy
entitled "Magic in the Intellectual
History of Western Civilization"
was taught by J.E. McCune of the
Western Civilization staff. Nancy
Hendrick was enrolled in that
colloquy, and says,"It was a very
good course, but I soon came to
the realization that it almost
completely ignored Cabala,

despite the Cabalistic influence on
non-Judaic mystical practices such
as tarot cards."
Free U
On the urging of her Grove
House resident assistant, Nancy
decided to teach a Mid-peninsula
Free University course on the
tarot. As almost all of the people
who enrolled in the course were
Stanford students, Nancy
petitioned the University to
sanction the course as a Grove
House seminar. Some objections
were made that the subject matter
was not of sufficient academic
interest to warrant such a course.
Mark Mancall, Chairman of
Undergraduate Studies
Committee, suggested that Nancy
expand the course to a study on
Jewish mysticism. The suggestion
was adopted, and U.S. 150 was
born.
Professor Mancall, who
manages the Undergraduate
Special Programs, sees nothing
objectionable in a freshman
teaching a University course. "If a
freshman has sufficient interest
competance to teach a course, I

see no reason why he should be
prevented from doing so."
Nancy's interest and
competence are unquestionable.
Her family name is
Briand-Roderico, which is a very
good name for a gypsy family.
"Every seven years the family has a
reunion at my grandfather's
ranch," Nancy tells incredulous
listeners, "and they conduct
family business, celebrate
marriages—everything gypsies are
supposed to do."
Such a background is bound to
instill some eccentricities in a
sensitive child. Peggy Scott, a
friend of Nancy and one of her
students, puts it well. "Nancy saw
her firs tarot card at three and
knew how to use them by the
time she was six."
Academic Achievements
Home environment explains
less well the high quality of
academic endeavor exhibited by
Nancy. In high school she did a
paper on the application of
Machiavellian principles to the
conduct of the war in Vietnam.
She then revised her work,
deleting all references to
Machiavelli and substituting
euphemisms such as "relocation
center'' for words like
"concentration camp." A popular
monthly magazine paid her $1500
for the paper, and published it
under the title "A Student Looks
at the Vietnam War."
Nancy is now expanding a
paper done for the McCune course
into a book on the history of
tarot. Her initial reading list for
"Jewish Mysticism" contained
works on Cabalistic symbolism,
Christian number symbolism and
Christian color symbolism—in
Italian and French as well as
English.
Tri-lingual Reading List
Questioned about her
students' ability to utilize a
tri-lingual reading list, Nancy
explained, "The course may be
taken for from zero to five units
of credit. Naturally only those
who are taking the course for four
of five units would be expected to
consider all the readings. And in
that event, I could help them with
the translations."
Nevertheless, one could easily
agree with Isabelle Runkle, her
rommate, who states
emphatically, "I won't take
Nancy's course. She'd make me
work too hard."
Letty Belin, a freshman from
Cedro, registered for the Free U.

course called "The Tarot." When
Nancy expanded the course into
"Jewish Mysticism" and received
University sanction to teach it as a
Grove House seminar, Letty
stayed on and is now taking the
class for two units of credit.
'Nancy Makes the Course'
"Nancy makes the course,"
she says."The sessions are two
and a half hours long. Most
seminars really drag when they
last that long. But this class is over
almost as soon as it begins. Nancy
is really interesting. She seems to
know everything; even, in fact
especially, the most absurd
things." Prof. Mancall states that
Grove seminars are open to all
students, and that students from
the Row houses are especially

welcome. The courses are not
publicized, however, since they
generally are taught in small
sections and are primarily
implemented for the benefit of
Grove students. He adds that
there is little to prevent students
outside of Grove from obtaining
the sponsorship of a faculty
member with academic standing
and initiating Undergraduate
Specials of a similar nature. Full
information on the Undergraduate
Special Programs is available in
Building 600T, the temporary
building behind Memorial Church.
The deadline for applications
for spring quarter is Friday,
February 13.
Credit Given
"Grove House courses grant

zero to five units of credit
primarily for the convenience of
tho students," explains Mancall.
"I hope units of credit are not
used as measures of intellectual
activity. We're trying to get away
from the quarter system.
"A course may last six weeks,
or it may last sixteen. A final
grade may not be given until the
end of the year, and then the
course could be given on a
pass-fail basis."
In short the Univergraduate
Special Programs are designed to
foster innovation in the academic
life of the University. "Jewish
Mysticism" and students like
Nancy Hendrick are indications of
the enormous potential of novelty
in education.

Academic Achievements
Home environment explains
less well the high quality of
academic endeavor exhibited by
Nancy. In high school she did a
paper on the application of
Machiavellian principles to the
conduct of the war in Vietnam.
She then revised her work,
deleting all references to
Machiavelli and substituting
euphemisms such as "relocation
center'' for words like
"concentration camp." A popular
monthly magazine paid her $1500
for the paper, and published it
under the title "A Student Looks
at the Vietnam War."
Nancy is now expanding a
paper done for the McCune course
into a book on the history of
tarot. Her initial reading list for
"Jewish Mysticism" contained
works on Cabalistic symbolism,
Christian number symbolism and
Christian color symbolism—in
Italian and French as well as
English.
Tri-lingual Reading List
Questioned about her
students' ability to utilize a
tri-lingual reading list, Nancy
explained, "The course may be
taken for from zero to five units
of credit. Naturally only those
who are taking the course for four
of five units would be expected to
consider all the readings. And in
that event, I could help them with
the translations."
Nevertheless, one could easily
agree with Isabelle Runkle, her
rommate, who states
emphatically, "I won't take
Nancy's course. She'd make me
work too hard."

course called "The Tarot." When
Nancy expanded the course into
"Jewish Mysticism" and received
University sanction to teach it as a
Grove House seminar, Letty
stayed on and is now taking the
class for two units of credit.
'Nancy Makes the Course'
"Nancy makes the course,"
she says."The sessions are two
and a half hours long. Most
seminars really drag when they
last that long. But this class is over
almost as soon as it begins. Nancy
is really interesting. She seems to
know everything; even, in fact
especially, the most absurd
things." Prof. Mancall states that
Grove seminars are open to all
students, and that students from
the Row houses are especially

welcome. The courses are not
publicized, however, since they
generally are taught in small
sections and are primarily
implemented for the benefit of
Grove students. He adds that
there is little to prevent students
outside of Grove from obtaining
the sponsorship of a faculty
member with academic standing
and initiating Undergraduate
Specials of a similar nature. Full

Special Programs is available in

Jane Lathrop Stanford
probably never would have

on Jewish mysticism at the
University.
Yet Nancy Hendrick is doing
just that every Monday night at
Grove House. The course is listed
as Undergraduate Special 150—a

history, theory and practice of
Cabala, the cult of mysticism and

European Jews of the Middle

"Jewish Mysticism" and received

'Nancy Makes the Course'
"Nancy makes the course,"
she says."The sessions are two
and a half hours long. Most
seminars really drag when they
last that long. But this class is over
almost as soon as it begins. Nancy
is really interesting. She seems to
know everything; even, in fact
especially, the most absurd
things." Prof. Mancall states that
Grove seminars are open to all
students, and that students from
the Row houses are especially

welcome. The courses are not
publicized, however, since they
generally are taught in small
sections and are primarily
implemented for the benefit of
Grove students. He adds that
there is little to prevent students
outside of Grove from obtaining
the sponsorship of a faculty
member with academic standing
and initiating Undergraduate
Specials of a similar nature. Full

Special Programs is available in

Credit Given
"Grove House courses grant

zero to five units of credit
primarily for the convenience of
tho students," explains Mancall.
"I hope units of credit are not
used as measures of intellectual
activity. We're trying to get away
from the quarter system.
"A course may last six weeks,
or it may last sixteen. A final
grade may not be given until the
end of the year, and then the
course could be given on a
pass-fail basis."
In short the Univergraduate
Special Programs are designed to

life of the University. "Jewish
Mysticism" and students like
Nancy Hendrick are indications of
the enormous potential of novelty
in education.
Jane Lathrop Stanford
probably never would have
permitted a freshman woman of
grpsy heritage to instruct a class
on Jewish mysticism at the
University.
Yet Nancy Hendrick is doing
just that every Monday night at
Grove House. The course is listed
as Undergraduate Special 150—a
designation covering all Grove
seminars—and deals with the
history, theory and practice of
Cabala, the cult of mysticism and
magic developed by Eastern
European Jews of the Middle
Ages. Thirteen students are
enrolled.
The story behind the course is
as intriguing as its subject matter.
Last quarter a history colloquy
entitled "Magic in the Intellectual
History of Western Civilization"
was taught by J.E. McCune of the
Western Civilization staff. Nancy
Hendrick was enrolled in that
colloquy, and says,"It was a very
good course, but I soon came to
the realization that it almost
completely ignored Cabala,

despite the Cabalistic influence on
non-Judaic mystical practices such
as tarot cards."
Free U
On the urging of her Grove
House resident assistant, Nancy
decided to teach a Mid-peninsula
Free University course on the
tarot. As almost all of the people
who enrolled in the course were
Stanford students, Nancy
petitioned the University to
sanction the course as a Grove
House seminar. Some objections
were made that the subject matter
was not of sufficient academic
interest to warrant such a course.
Mark Mancall, Chairman of
Undergraduate Studies
Committee, suggested that Nancy
expand the course to a study on
Jewish mysticism. The suggestion
was adopted, and U.S. 150 was
born.
Professor Mancall, who
manages the Undergraduate
Special Programs, sees nothing
objectionable in a freshman
teaching a University course. "If a
freshman has sufficient interest
competance to teach a course, I

see no reason why he should be
prevented from doing so."
Nancy's interest and
competence are unquestionable.
Her family name is
Briand-Roderico, which is a very
good name for a gypsy family.
"Every seven years the family has a
reunion at my grandfather's
ranch," Nancy tells incredulous
listeners, "and they conduct
family business, celebrate
marriages—everything gypsies are
supposed to do."
Such a background is bound to
instill some eccentricities in a
sensitive child. Peggy Scott, a
friend of Nancy and one of her
students, puts it well. "Nancy saw
her firs tarot card at three and
knew how to use them by the
time she was six."
Academic Achievements
Home environment explains
less well the high quality of
academic endeavor exhibited by
Nancy. In high school she did a
paper on the application of
Machiavellian principles to the
conduct of the war in Vietnam.
She then revised her work,
deleting all references to
Machiavelli and substituting
euphemisms such as "relocation
center'' for words like
"concentration camp." A popular
monthly magazine paid her $1500
for the paper, and published it
under the title "A Student Looks
at the Vietnam War."
Nancy is now expanding a
paper done for the McCune course
into a book on the history of
tarot. Her initial reading list for
"Jewish Mysticism" contained
works on Cabalistic symbolism,
Christian number symbolism and
Christian color symbolism—in
Italian and French as well as
English.
Tri-lingual Reading List
Questioned about her
students' ability to utilize a
tri-lingual reading list, Nancy
explained, "The course may be
taken for from zero to five units
of credit. Naturally only those
who are taking the course for four
of five units would be expected to
consider all the readings. And in
that event, I could help them with
the translations."
Nevertheless, one could easily
agree with Isabelle Runkle, her
rommate, who states
emphatically, "I won't take
Nancy's course. She'd make me
work too hard."
