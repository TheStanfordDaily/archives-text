# Alumni Support For Student Grievances
## 
### 
Alumni show considerable
understanding and sympathy for
certain student complaints—but
not for tactics which interfere
with the rights of others.
These findings from the
Continuing Survey of Stanford
Alumni Opinion are reported in
the current issue of The Alumni
Almanac, independently edited
monthly newspaper.
More than three out of four
Stanford alumni (77%) view as
"reasonable" the idea that
students should be allowed to
participate in making decisions
that affect their lives.
And a similarly large majority
(77%) feel that there is
justification for the student
complaint that economic and
social inequities are particularly
hard to tolerate in an affluent
society.
Nearly nine out of 10 (89%)
say that students probably have
legitimate complaints regarding
courses they're required to take,
the grading system, and other
questions of education reform.
But nine out of 10 degree
holders (89%) agree that
"whatever legitimate complaints
the students may have, there is no
justification for interfering with
the rights of others to attend class
or have job interviews on
campus." Even among those who
graduated from Stanford within
the past three years, more than
two out of three (68%) endorse
this view.
More than three out of four
degree holders (76%) agree that
"no one has a 'right' to attend
Stanford. If a student can't abide
by the rules, he should leave—or
be expelled." But only one-third
(36%) of recent graduates support
this view.
Even so, there is very broad
consensus that universities are
complex organizations and
therefore "it is unreasonable to
assume that there are quick and
easy answers" to their problems.

Nearly nine out of 1 0 (86%) agree
with this proposition. More than
four of of five alumni (81%) say
that since most leading
universities have experienced
disorders, it is unreasonable to
expect that Stanford could avoid
them.
A majority (53%) say that
"Stanford seems to have handled
its problems better than most"
other universities. Only one in
four Stanford degree holders
(26%) agree that "the nature of
widespread student disorders
suggests that there is actually
some kind of conspiracy afoot to
destroy our universities."
A majority (53%) agree that
"experience has shown that
students get results when they
resort to forceful tactics but that
nothing much happens when they
merely petition for changes."
Almost half (48%) concur that
"when university administrators
respond to force with force, the
effect is to create greater
sympathy for the radical students
among students who initially were
uncommitted."
A similar split (46% to 40%)
comes in blaming the faculty for
either encouraging disruptive
behavior or doing nothing to
discourage it. But three out of
four alumni suspect students have
a legitimate gripe in feeling that
leading professors involved in
research "give little time to
teaching and helping
students — particularly
undergraduates."
These findings are based on
4,7 00 questionnaires received
from a random sample of 7,000
Stanford degree holders. Results
were analyzed by Alumni
Association Vice President
Thomas M. Newell, a former
research analyst with the Gallup
Poll now serving as a vice
president with D'Arcy
Advertising, St. Louis, and
Rixford K. Snyder, director of the
survey and former director of
admissions at Stanford.

graduated from Stanford within
the past three years, more than
two out of three (68%) endorse
this view.
More than three out of four
degree holders (76%) agree that
"no one has a 'right' to attend
Stanford. If a student can't abide
by the rules, he should leave—or
be expelled." But only one-third
(36%) of recent graduates support
this view.
Even so, there is very broad
consensus that universities are
complex organizations and
therefore "it is unreasonable to
assume that there are quick and
easy answers" to their problems.

Nearly nine out of 1 0 (86%) agree
with this proposition. More than
four of of five alumni (81%) say
that since most leading
universities have experienced
disorders, it is unreasonable to
expect that Stanford could avoid
them.
A majority (53%) say that
"Stanford seems to have handled
its problems better than most"
other universities. Only one in
four Stanford degree holders
(26%) agree that "the nature of
widespread student disorders
suggests that there is actually
some kind of conspiracy afoot to
destroy our universities."
A majority (53%) agree that
"experience has shown that
students get results when they
resort to forceful tactics but that
nothing much happens when they
merely petition for changes."
Almost half (48%) concur that
"when university administrators
respond to force with force, the
effect is to create greater
sympathy for the radical students
among students who initially were
uncommitted."
A similar split (46% to 40%)
comes in blaming the faculty for
either encouraging disruptive
behavior or doing nothing to
discourage it. But three out of
four alumni suspect students have
a legitimate gripe in feeling that
leading professors involved in
research "give little time to
teaching and helping
students — particularly
undergraduates."
These findings are based on
4,7 00 questionnaires received
from a random sample of 7,000
Stanford degree holders. Results
were analyzed by Alumni
Association Vice President
Thomas M. Newell, a former
research analyst with the Gallup
Poll now serving as a vice
president with D'Arcy
Advertising, St. Louis, and
Rixford K. Snyder, director of the
survey and former director of
admissions at Stanford.
Alumni show considerable
understanding and sympathy for
certain student complaints—but
not for tactics which interfere
with the rights of others.
These findings from the
Continuing Survey of Stanford
Alumni Opinion are reported in
the current issue of The Alumni
Almanac, independently edited
monthly newspaper.
More than three out of four
Stanford alumni (77%) view as
"reasonable" the idea that
students should be allowed to
participate in making decisions
that affect their lives.
And a similarly large majority
(77%) feel that there is
justification for the student
complaint that economic and
social inequities are particularly
hard to tolerate in an affluent
society.
Nearly nine out of 10 (89%)
say that students probably have
legitimate complaints regarding
courses they're required to take,
the grading system, and other
questions of education reform.
But nine out of 10 degree
holders (89%) agree that
"whatever legitimate complaints
the students may have, there is no
justification for interfering with
the rights of others to attend class
or have job interviews on
campus." Even among those who
graduated from Stanford within
the past three years, more than
two out of three (68%) endorse
this view.
