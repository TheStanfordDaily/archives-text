# Debate Team Triumphs
## 
### 
Stanford debators won two
trophies this weekend at a
tournament at Calilornia State
College at Long Beach and
received a special award for
overall excellence in national
competition in activities during
the 1968-69 school year.
The special award presented to
Forensics Director Kenneth E.
Mosier signified third-place honors
in the American Forensic
Association national sweepstakes
competition. The sweepstakes
award is based on the number of
tournaments won by each school
and on the number of different
debators who place in
tournaments.
Stanford scored a substantial
number of its points through the
second factor. More than 200
students participated in some
aspect of the forensic program last
year.
In the Long Beach tournament
Archie Schrotenboer, junior from
Los Altos, and Dean Swartz,
junior from Los Alamitos, won
first place in the senior division.
In the preliminary rounds they
defeated teams from the
University of San Francisco, the
University of California at
Berkeley, the University of
Southern California, the
University of Utah, California
State College at Fullerton and the
University of Texas. In the three
elimination rounds they defeated
teams from the University of

South Dakota, the University of
California at Berkeley and a
second team from the University
of San Francisco.
Stanford also won second
place in the Long Beach
tournament sweepstakes
competition based on total
performance during preliminary
rounds. Debators contributing to
the sweepstakes win in addition to
Schwartz and Schrotenboer were
John Oliver, Jim Dehnert, Ed
Oster, John Peterson, John Bell
and Bryce Shirley.
Forty schools from twelve
states participated in the two-day

tournament. Each school was
allowed to enter several two-man
teams.
Also over the weekend
debators Hon Oster and Stewart
Baskin finished with a six and two
record in the preliminary rounds
of the Northwestern University
invitational tournament at
Evanston, Illinois. They were
defeated in the octa-final round.
All debates were on the
national college debate
proposition, "Resolved: That the
Federal government should grant
annually a specific percentage of
its income tax revenue to the state
governments."
