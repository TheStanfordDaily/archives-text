# Dillingham Denies Anti-Union Charges
## 
### JUDY BIRK 
Dillingham Corporation,
promoter for the heavily-criticized
Palo Alto Square development on
Stanford land, has been accused
of backing a drive to outlaw the
union shop clause in labor
contracts in California.
Grass Roots, the radical
land-use group leading opposition
to the construction of Palo Alto
Square, has charged Dillingham
Corporation with being anti-union
on the basis of a letter to
employers soliciting contributions
to the O a k 1 a n d - b a s e d
"Californians for Right to Work."
The Mid peninsula Free
University obtained a copy of the
letter written on company
stationery by Robert Briggs, vice
president of the Oceanographic
Engineering division of Dillingham
Corporation last week.

Briggs urges contributions to
"Californians for Right to Work,"
and encloses a copy of a letter
from that organization. The "right
to work" law would prohibit the
wide-used union shop, which
requires all workers to pay dues to
a union which is their recognized
bargaining agent. Labor unions
insist that the union shop is
essential to give workers strength
in collective bargaining.
Dillingham's letter says that
"secondary benefits" from a right
to work campaign will be an
atmosphere that "imposes
restraints on excesses by union
officials and greatly reduces
industrial strife."
Briggs, whose office is in La
Jolla, California, was unavailable
for questioning as he is
recuperating from recent
hospitalization. His secretary
claims, however, that Briggs was
expressing his own personal
opinion on "right to work," and
that the letter in no way reflects
the corporation's position. When
asked why Briggs wrote the letter
on company stationery she
replied, "That's the only
stationery he has."
Despite Dillingham's denial of
any connection with an effort
that will weaken labor unions,
members of the United Stanford
Employees and Grass Roots
accuse Dillingham of anti-labor
activities.
U. S. E. and Grass Roots
strongly oppose the Dillingham
construction of Palo Alto Square
on the south west corner of Page
Mill and El Camino. U.S.E.'s
housing committee has
recommended that the
organization take a stand against
this development project which
will bring 1,500 more employees
to the area's overloaded housing
market. U.S.E. believes that
Stanford should build at least
2,500 low-rent housing units on
campus land.
Grass Roots opposes the
development project on the
grounds that it will worsen the
housing crisis, create traffic
problems, and generally increase
environmental pollution.
The lease which would permit
the construction of two 10-story
office towers, a 1 7-story hotel and
convention center, and 13 acres of
parking lots has not yet been
signed.

in collective bargaining.
Dillingham's letter says that
"secondary benefits" from a right
to work campaign will be an
atmosphere that "imposes
restraints on excesses by union
officials and greatly reduces
industrial strife."
Briggs, whose office is in La
Jolla, California, was unavailable
for questioning as he is
recuperating from recent
hospitalization. His secretary
claims, however, that Briggs was
expressing his own personal
opinion on "right to work," and
that the letter in no way reflects
the corporation's position. When
asked why Briggs wrote the letter
on company stationery she
replied, "That's the only
stationery he has."
Despite Dillingham's denial of
any connection with an effort
that will weaken labor unions,
members of the United Stanford
Employees and Grass Roots
accuse Dillingham of anti-labor
activities.
U. S. E. and Grass Roots
strongly oppose the Dillingham
construction of Palo Alto Square
on the south west corner of Page
Mill and El Camino. U.S.E.'s
housing committee has
recommended that the
organization take a stand against
this development project which
will bring 1,500 more employees
to the area's overloaded housing
market. U.S.E. believes that
Stanford should build at least
2,500 low-rent housing units on
campus land.
Grass Roots opposes the
development project on the
grounds that it will worsen the
housing crisis, create traffic
problems, and generally increase
environmental pollution.
The lease which would permit
the construction of two 10-story
office towers, a 1 7-story hotel and
convention center, and 13 acres of
parking lots has not yet been
signed.
Dillingham Corporation,
promoter for the heavily-criticized
Palo Alto Square development on
Stanford land, has been accused
of backing a drive to outlaw the
union shop clause in labor
contracts in California.
Grass Roots, the radical
land-use group leading opposition
to the construction of Palo Alto
Square, has charged Dillingham
Corporation with being anti-union
on the basis of a letter to
employers soliciting contributions
to the O a k 1 a n d - b a s e d
"Californians for Right to Work."
The Mid peninsula Free
University obtained a copy of the
letter written on company
stationery by Robert Briggs, vice
president of the Oceanographic
Engineering division of Dillingham
Corporation last week.

Briggs urges contributions to
"Californians for Right to Work,"
and encloses a copy of a letter
from that organization. The "right
to work" law would prohibit the
wide-used union shop, which
requires all workers to pay dues to
a union which is their recognized
bargaining agent. Labor unions
insist that the union shop is
essential to give workers strength
in collective bargaining.
