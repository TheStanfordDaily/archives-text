Espionage
SEATTLE (AP)— Tightest secrecy
was kept yesterday around a
Russian employee of the United

Nations arrested here on
espionage charges.
The Soviet Union, meantime,
sent the top consular officer from
its Washington, D.C., embasy here
to confer with Aleksandr V
Tikhomirov, who is being held in
city jail pending a preliminary
hearing tomorrow.
Meanwhile, in Washington, the
State Department rejected a
Soviet Union argument that
diplomatic immunity applied to
the case.
The FBI said Tikhomirov was
arrested Saturday on a downtown
Seattle street about an hour after
a scheduled meeting with an
unidentified technical serfeant in
the U.S. Air Force.

Tikhomirov said he had conspired
with Russian agents and "other
persons unknown" since Jan. 4,
1969, to obtain information
about U.S. defenses.
Lal)or Unions
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Nixon
administration told contractors
and unions in 19 cities yesterday
to shape voluntary plans for
boosting minor i ty - group
employment on federal
construction projects or the
government will do it for them.
Secretary of Labor George P.
Shultz set no timetable, but a
Labor Department spokesman
said this means "well within a
year."
The secretary said in a
statement the government would
impose "Philadelphia-type plans
for those local communities which
are unable to develop on their
own initiative acceptable
area-wide agreements."
Under the disputed
Philadelphia Plan, the government
set percentage goals for specific
unions, requiring each to increase
minority-group membership—
primarily Negros—by five percent
a year for four years.
