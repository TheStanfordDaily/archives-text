## 
### JUDY BIRK PHYLLIS PETERSON 
Crime on campus has increased
significantly this year as compared
with 1968-69 according to
statistics of the Stanford Police
Department.
Burglary by means of breaking
and entering has been the most
common crime with the number
of burglaries rising from 55 last
year to 155 to date this year.
Tape decks stolen from vehicles
parked on campus account for
half of these burglaries.
The number of petty thefts of
items valued at less than $200 has
increased from a total of 98 last
year to 134 as of December,
1969. Grand thefts, felonies
involving over $200, have risen by
50 percent since last year. This

year's figure for grand thefts is 33
as compared to 17 for 1 968-69.
There were no rapes on
campus last year as opposed to
two this year, one in December
and one in January.
Several petty thefts and one
grand theft of $1200 worth of
photographic equipment were
reported in Donner House, Stert.
complex, this year. The large
number of thefts in Donner has
been attributed in part to a
missing master key, and as a result
all of the locks to Donner rooms
were changed last Friday.
According to Carole Price,
Stern Hall director, Stanford's
no-hours, open-dorm policy could
account for part of the general
increase in campus crime.
