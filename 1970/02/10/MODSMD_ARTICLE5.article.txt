# Room-Board Increase Proposed To Trustees
## 
### 
Proposals for a $70 annual
increase in basic room and board
rates will be considered by the
Board of Trustees at their
on-campus meeting today, the
Daily learned last night. The
proposals were approved by a
Trustee committee yesterday, and
formal approval is expected this
morning.
In addition to raising the basic
rate from $1140 to $1210
annually, the proposals would
eliminate dorm maid and phone
service in an effort to trim the
annual deficit of more than
$400,000 in the self-supporting
residential program. The rate
change would take effect this fall.
The six percent increase, if
adopted, would be the first since
1966. The move would come on
top of a previously announced
tuition increase from $2145 to
$2400 for next year, the largest
increase in University history.
A further room and board
increase to about $1300 is
anticipated for 1971-72, when
income is expected to nearly
balance expenditures.
The proposed room and board
increase was restricted to six
percent because of its impact on
total student expenses, financial
aid, and related programs.
Freshman expenses, including the
new rates for tuition, room and
board, plus books, supplies,
laundry, cleaning and recreational
expenses, would amount to
$4110, not including
transportation.
Report Explains Change
Maintaining the present level
of services in campus residences
would require about three times
as large an increase in the basic
room and board rate.
Recommended cuts in services
were developed by a committee
comprised of students, faculty,
staff and administration and
prepared for the Board's
consideration by Dean of
Students Peter Z. Bulkeley and
Business Manager Dwight B.
Adams.
Basic factors behind the cosl
rise include a $400 monthly
minimum wage for residence and
food service employees, which
adds about $1 50,000 annually; an
"unlimited second servings"
policy on food, which costs an
estimated $100,000; a five to six
percent rise in basic food costs,
which amounts to about $50,000;
and the inability of the food
service or residents to control the
abuse of meal tickets by
non-residents.
Operating Deficit
During the current academic
year, Stanford's room and board
services will incur an operating
deficit of about $449,000. The
combination of increased rates
and reduced services are expected
to cut this deficit to about
$200,000 next year.
The present University rate of
$1140 for a double room with
twenty meals a week compares
with $1300 at Harvard, which has
just announced a $2600 tuition

charge for next year, $1270 at
MIT and Chicago, $1250 at Yale,
$1200 at Cornell, $1160 at
Princeton, $1140 at USC, $1100
at Cal Tech, and $1080 at
Berkeley.
The present Stanford rate
includes weekly maid service and
phone service through five
dormitory switchboards. The
maid service will be eliminated
from individual rooms but will be
maintained for common areas in
the dorms.
Maid Employment
About 20 maids whose jobs
would be eliminated if the
trustees approve the change for
this fall have been asked to meet
with University officials today.
They are expected to receive
written assurance that other
employment will be secured
through the University for them.
The change would also effect
about fifteen dormitory
switchboard operators, who
would also receive University
assistance in seeking other
employment. Those working
full-time are expected to
experience little difficulty in
relocating.
If University phone service is
dropped, as has happened on
several other campuses, students
may obtain their own phones at
monthly rates of $3.65 or more,
plus installation and other fees,

depending on the ievel of service
desired.
Message Centers
One or more message centers
would be established as needed to
provide communication services
for those not ordering phones.
The message centers' services
would be free to dorm residents.
Fifty dollars of the $70
increase will go to the food service
for increased costs and services.
William Myers, director of the
Food Service, said that rough
figures indicated that about 50
percent of the money collected
this year for room and board has
gone toward the purchase of raw
foodstuffs. This is an increase of
38 percent from 1966-67 and
about 43 percent from last year.
The quarterly cost in
Manzainta Park would also be
increased six percent, from $205
to $217.
Student members of the task
force studying room and board
rates, selected by the ASSU,
included Roger Johnson, Laurie
Apt, Jim Gimian, Mike Boyle, Jim
Kilgore, and John Grube. Staff
members of the committee
included Dean Bulkeley, Ed
Scoles, Bill Myers, Alan
Cummings, Dan Williams and Mel
Brown.
The proposed rate schedule for
1970-71 would be as follows
Fall Winter Spring
82 days 75 days 73 days
$431 $395 $384
$410 $375 $365

increased six percent, from $205
to $217.
Student members of the task
force studying room and board
rates, selected by the ASSU,
included Roger Johnson, Laurie
Apt, Jim Gimian, Mike Boyle, Jim
Kilgore, and John Grube. Staff
members of the committee
included Dean Bulkeley, Ed
Scoles, Bill Myers, Alan
Cummings, Dan Williams and Mel
Brown.
The proposed rate schedule for
1970-71 would be as follows
Fall Winter Spring
82 days 75 days 73 days
$431 $395 $384
$410 $375 $365
Proposals for a $70 annual
increase in basic room and board
rates will be considered by the
Board of Trustees at their
on-campus meeting today, the
Daily learned last night. The
proposals were approved by a
Trustee committee yesterday, and
formal approval is expected this
morning.
In addition to raising the basic
rate from $1140 to $1210
annually, the proposals would
eliminate dorm maid and phone
service in an effort to trim the
annual deficit of more than
$400,000 in the self-supporting
residential program. The rate
change would take effect this fall.
The six percent increase, if
adopted, would be the first since
1966. The move would come on
top of a previously announced
tuition increase from $2145 to
$2400 for next year, the largest
increase in University history.
A further room and board
increase to about $1300 is
anticipated for 1971-72, when
income is expected to nearly
balance expenditures.
The proposed room and board
increase was restricted to six
percent because of its impact on
total student expenses, financial
aid, and related programs.
Freshman expenses, including the
new rates for tuition, room and
board, plus books, supplies,
laundry, cleaning and recreational
expenses, would amount to
$4110, not including
transportation.
Report Explains Change
Maintaining the present level
of services in campus residences
would require about three times
as large an increase in the basic
room and board rate.
Recommended cuts in services
were developed by a committee
comprised of students, faculty,
staff and administration and
prepared for the Board's
consideration by Dean of
Students Peter Z. Bulkeley and
Business Manager Dwight B.
Adams.
Basic factors behind the cosl
rise include a $400 monthly
minimum wage for residence and
food service employees, which
adds about $1 50,000 annually; an
"unlimited second servings"
policy on food, which costs an
estimated $100,000; a five to six
percent rise in basic food costs,
which amounts to about $50,000;
and the inability of the food
service or residents to control the
abuse of meal tickets by
non-residents.
Operating Deficit
During the current academic
year, Stanford's room and board
services will incur an operating
deficit of about $449,000. The
combination of increased rates
and reduced services are expected
to cut this deficit to about
$200,000 next year.
The present University rate of
$1140 for a double room with
twenty meals a week compares
with $1300 at Harvard, which has
just announced a $2600 tuition

charge for next year, $1270 at
MIT and Chicago, $1250 at Yale,
$1200 at Cornell, $1160 at
Princeton, $1140 at USC, $1100
at Cal Tech, and $1080 at
Berkeley.
The present Stanford rate
includes weekly maid service and
phone service through five
dormitory switchboards. The
maid service will be eliminated
from individual rooms but will be
maintained for common areas in
the dorms.
Maid Employment
About 20 maids whose jobs
would be eliminated if the
trustees approve the change for
this fall have been asked to meet
with University officials today.
They are expected to receive
written assurance that other
employment will be secured
through the University for them.
The change would also effect
about fifteen dormitory
switchboard operators, who
would also receive University
assistance in seeking other
employment. Those working
full-time are expected to
experience little difficulty in
relocating.
If University phone service is
dropped, as has happened on
several other campuses, students
may obtain their own phones at
monthly rates of $3.65 or more,
plus installation and other fees,

depending on the ievel of service
desired.
Message Centers
One or more message centers
would be established as needed to
provide communication services
for those not ordering phones.
The message centers' services
would be free to dorm residents.
Fifty dollars of the $70
increase will go to the food service
for increased costs and services.
William Myers, director of the
Food Service, said that rough
figures indicated that about 50
percent of the money collected
this year for room and board has
gone toward the purchase of raw
foodstuffs. This is an increase of
38 percent from 1966-67 and
about 43 percent from last year.
The quarterly cost in
Manzainta Park would also be
increased six percent, from $205
to $217.

Message Centers
One or more message centers
would be established as needed to
provide communication services
for those not ordering phones.
The message centers' services
would be free to dorm residents.
Fifty dollars of the $70
increase will go to the food service
for increased costs and services.
William Myers, director of the
Food Service, said that rough
figures indicated that about 50
percent of the money collected
this year for room and board has
gone toward the purchase of raw
foodstuffs. This is an increase of
38 percent from 1966-67 and
about 43 percent from last year.
The quarterly cost in
Manzainta Park would also be
increased six percent, from $205
to $217.
Student members of the task
force studying room and board
rates, selected by the ASSU,
included Roger Johnson, Laurie
Apt, Jim Gimian, Mike Boyle, Jim
Kilgore, and John Grube. Staff
members of the committee
included Dean Bulkeley, Ed
Scoles, Bill Myers, Alan
Cummings, Dan Williams and Mel
Brown.
The proposed rate schedule for
1970-71 would be as follows
Fall Winter Spring
82 days 75 days 73 days
$431 $395 $384
$410 $375 $365
Proposals for a $70 annual
increase in basic room and board
rates will be considered by the
Board of Trustees at their
on-campus meeting today, the
Daily learned last night. The
proposals were approved by a
Trustee committee yesterday, and
formal approval is expected this
morning.
In addition to raising the basic
rate from $1140 to $1210
annually, the proposals would
eliminate dorm maid and phone
service in an effort to trim the
annual deficit of more than
$400,000 in the self-supporting
residential program. The rate
change would take effect this fall.
The six percent increase, if
adopted, would be the first since
1966. The move would come on
top of a previously announced
tuition increase from $2145 to
$2400 for next year, the largest
increase in University history.
A further room and board
increase to about $1300 is
anticipated for 1971-72, when
income is expected to nearly
balance expenditures.
The proposed room and board
increase was restricted to six
percent because of its impact on
total student expenses, financial
aid, and related programs.
Freshman expenses, including the
new rates for tuition, room and
board, plus books, supplies,
laundry, cleaning and recreational
expenses, would amount to
$4110, not including
transportation.
Report Explains Change
Maintaining the present level
of services in campus residences
would require about three times
as large an increase in the basic
room and board rate.
Recommended cuts in services
were developed by a committee
comprised of students, faculty,
staff and administration and
prepared for the Board's
consideration by Dean of
Students Peter Z. Bulkeley and
Business Manager Dwight B.
Adams.
Basic factors behind the cosl
rise include a $400 monthly
minimum wage for residence and
food service employees, which
adds about $1 50,000 annually; an
"unlimited second servings"
policy on food, which costs an
estimated $100,000; a five to six
percent rise in basic food costs,
which amounts to about $50,000;
and the inability of the food
service or residents to control the
abuse of meal tickets by
non-residents.
Operating Deficit
During the current academic
year, Stanford's room and board
services will incur an operating
deficit of about $449,000. The
combination of increased rates
and reduced services are expected
to cut this deficit to about
$200,000 next year.
The present University rate of
$1140 for a double room with
twenty meals a week compares
with $1300 at Harvard, which has
just announced a $2600 tuition

charge for next year, $1270 at
MIT and Chicago, $1250 at Yale,
$1200 at Cornell, $1160 at
Princeton, $1140 at USC, $1100
at Cal Tech, and $1080 at
Berkeley.
The present Stanford rate
includes weekly maid service and
phone service through five
dormitory switchboards. The
maid service will be eliminated
from individual rooms but will be
maintained for common areas in
the dorms.
Maid Employment
About 20 maids whose jobs
would be eliminated if the
trustees approve the change for
this fall have been asked to meet
with University officials today.
They are expected to receive
written assurance that other
employment will be secured
through the University for them.
The change would also effect
about fifteen dormitory
switchboard operators, who
would also receive University
assistance in seeking other
employment. Those working
full-time are expected to
experience little difficulty in
relocating.
If University phone service is
dropped, as has happened on
several other campuses, students
may obtain their own phones at
monthly rates of $3.65 or more,
plus installation and other fees,

depending on the ievel of service
desired.
