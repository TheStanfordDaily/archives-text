# 'Dull Meeting'
## Moratorium Decides Little 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
Room and 20 meals/week
Room and 14 meals/week

With dwindling attendance and
apparent lack of interest the New
Moratorium was able to
accomplish little last night. Plans
were discussed for the "Liberation
Week" next week, but few
activities were decided on
definitely, with the 25 members
present voting to leave the specific
tactics and activities for the
coordinating committee of the
group to decide.
Early in the meeting a
photographer was once again
prohibited from taking pictures,
despite the strong objections again
expressed by the Daily (see
editorial, page 2).
One of the few specific
activities settled upon was the
visit of two Vietnam veterans
from the "Green Machine," a GJ
peace organization based in
Oceanside, California. The two
ex-marines, who attempted to
form a GI coffee house in
Oceanside, will speak tonight in
the dorms and tomorrow
afternoon at a rally on campus.
One, a black veteran, will
discuss the problem of racism in
the armed forces; the other will
talk on the general nature of U.S.
military. Leafletting to advertise
the speakers will be conducted
today and tomorrow.

Though there were no
decisions made, there were more
suggestions of possible activities,
including: a series of "legal skills
seminars" to inform students on
search and seizure laws and
regulations regarding assemblies
and demonstrations; karate classes
for potential insurgents; an
"insurgency literature table"; and
classes on the techniques of
insurgency now being employed
in Vietnam and black America.
Training people in insurgency
techniques was mentioned as a
possible major focus for
"Insurgency Day," Feb. 18.
Members hope that the day will
be a "kind of moratorium" in that
ROTC will find it difficult to

conduct "business as usual" that
day.
A loose plan was decided on
for the day, featuring a rally, the
presentation of student petitions
to President Pitzer, and then a
tour of the ROTC facilities on
campus. It was announced that
approximately 500 signatures
have so far been collected on the
student petitions, which demand
an end to ROTC on campus.
Members seemed disappointed
in the generally lethargic nature of
the meeting. When one member
called for order after the meeting
had deteriorated into a number of
private discussions, chairman D.
McGuire was moved to comment,
"We don't have enough energy
here to have disorder."

here to have disorder."
Room and 20 meals/week
Room and 14 meals/week

With dwindling attendance and
apparent lack of interest the New
Moratorium was able to
accomplish little last night. Plans
were discussed for the "Liberation
Week" next week, but few
activities were decided on
definitely, with the 25 members
present voting to leave the specific
tactics and activities for the
coordinating committee of the
group to decide.
Early in the meeting a
photographer was once again
prohibited from taking pictures,
despite the strong objections again
expressed by the Daily (see
editorial, page 2).
One of the few specific
activities settled upon was the
visit of two Vietnam veterans
from the "Green Machine," a GJ
peace organization based in
Oceanside, California. The two
ex-marines, who attempted to
form a GI coffee house in
Oceanside, will speak tonight in
the dorms and tomorrow
afternoon at a rally on campus.
One, a black veteran, will
discuss the problem of racism in
the armed forces; the other will
talk on the general nature of U.S.
military. Leafletting to advertise
the speakers will be conducted
today and tomorrow.

Though there were no
decisions made, there were more
suggestions of possible activities,
including: a series of "legal skills
seminars" to inform students on
search and seizure laws and
regulations regarding assemblies
and demonstrations; karate classes
for potential insurgents; an
"insurgency literature table"; and
classes on the techniques of
insurgency now being employed
in Vietnam and black America.
Training people in insurgency
techniques was mentioned as a
possible major focus for
"Insurgency Day," Feb. 18.
Members hope that the day will
be a "kind of moratorium" in that
ROTC will find it difficult to

conduct "business as usual" that
day.
A loose plan was decided on
for the day, featuring a rally, the
presentation of student petitions
to President Pitzer, and then a
tour of the ROTC facilities on
campus. It was announced that
approximately 500 signatures
have so far been collected on the
student petitions, which demand
an end to ROTC on campus.
Members seemed disappointed
in the generally lethargic nature of
the meeting. When one member
called for order after the meeting
had deteriorated into a number of
private discussions, chairman D.
McGuire was moved to comment,
"We don't have enough energy
here to have disorder."
