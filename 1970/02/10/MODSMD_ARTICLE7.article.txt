## Politics And Photos 
### 
The news media today is caught in a
pair of scissors. While protest groups
defensively resist full news coverage, police
subpoena photographs and film to help
prosecute demonstrators. Caught between
two blades in a political argument, news
gathering ability is being cut to shreds.
At Stanford, Daily photographers have
been excluded from new Moratorium and
SDS meetings. We recognize and regret the
objections raised by the two groups-that
newspaper pictures have been used to
convict demonstrators. But we resent these
attempts to interfere with coverage of
lawful, open community meetings on
campus.
The Daily cannot pursue news gathering
in a vacuum, ignoring the consequences of
what it prints. Neither can we brush aside
our responsibility to print and picture the
news fairly and fully. Responding to both
journalistic responsibilities and the realities
of government subpoenas, the Daily staff
has voted to accept the following policy for
reporting meetings and demonstrations.
1) Photographers will be assigned to
newsworthy events, and they will remain
until explicitly excluded. If they or their
equipment are harmed, the Daily will press
charges through campus and community
judicial bodies. However, the Daily will not

withhold news coverage to force access Tor
its photographers.
2) The Daily will print newsworthy
photographs regardless of their potential
for incrimination. This is essential to full
coverage of events.
3) Negatives which may be used to
convict protestors will be destroyed. We
feel that a line can and should be drawn at
this point between journalistic
responsibility and cooperation with
government authorities in protests that are
often directed against the government.
Once a story has been printed, pictures
taken with it are rarely used again.
However, negatives which never appear in
the paper may be used to convict
demonstrators.
The Daily feels no obligation to help in
the prosecution of students for crimes
related to political activity. Our purpose is
to gather information for our readers, not
for police files.
We advise both the police and the
protest movement to consider again what
they sacrifice when they tamper with the
press' ability to present the news. The press
must act as much more than a political
weapon or shield.
In this spirit of responsibility, realism
and independent, we present our policy.
