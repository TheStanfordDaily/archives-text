# Fiji Coeds May Be Out
## 
### 
The status of four female
boarders in the Phi Gamma Delta
house remained ambiguous
yesterday, as Dean of Students
Peter Bulkeley agreed to
"reconsider" his earlier decision
that the girls must immediately
find other housing.
At issue is the propriety of the
house's decision in the Fall to
admit the girls, without prior
consultation with the University.
"Fiji" is now in the midst of
controversy involving its national
"leaders", alumni, the Dean of
Students' office, and the members
of the local chapter, Lambda
Sigma. According to Charles
White, a spokesman for the
fraternity, "if Bulkeley says that
they can stay until the end of the
quarter, they will; if not the house
voted last night to ask them to
leave. In any event, we'll enter
into negotiations with the
University in regards to future
living arrangements after this
specific situation has been
settled."
The group's desire to bargain
eventually for a co-educational
living situation, expressed by
White, is meeting opposition from
the national organization and
alumni, who have threatened to
Uike the chapter into receivership
and ask some of its present cadre
to resign.
Hank Sayer, another member
of the local chapter, predicted
that such action would bring
about resistance from its
members, and that "legally, we
nave more of a right to the house
than does the national
organization." William Leland,
Associate Dean of Students,
supported Sayer's stand: "Insofar
as the lease agreement is
concerned, our concern is
primarily with the individuals
residing in the house," he said.
Leland went on to place the
question of the female boarders
within the contest of a general
lack of explicitness in the
relationships between the
University and the living units:
"We simply haven't made policies
ind agreements clear enough."
Eviction
The Fiji house last year began
accomodating non-member
boarders, as do most of the other
fraternities. However, this Fall the
all-male organization decided to

allow four girfs to become
boarders. At this point a major
difference in interpretation
ensued.
The fraternity, according to
Chris Peck, viewed the inclusion
as "no real change" and did not
inform the Dean of Students of
their actions. In Bulkeley's view,
however "the presence of a girl
boarder did, in effect, make it a
co-ed living arrangement."
The Dean therefore, earlier
this week wrote to the fraternity
that "the girls would have to
move out. If a plan wasn't
forthcoming, I would feel obliged
to begin processes that would
enable the University to turn that
building into another kind of
residence."
Ambiquity
The Fiji response was first to
request another alternative: that
the girls be allowed to remain in
the building until the end of
winter quarter. But, after
consultation, they communicated
to Bulkeley that they would
comply with his decision and ask
the co-eds to leave immediately.
This decision made in a house
vote last night, was "taken under
advisement" by Bulkeley. He
proclaimed the matter "not
settled" as of that time, and
echoed Leland's desire to "get
over this stumbling block and
begin to work out a mutually
acceptable agreement toward a
co-ed situation."
National Pressure
The spokesmen for the
fraternity evaluated their original
decision to take in the girls as
being motivated by "a desire to
pull the house together so that we
could begin to move in a cohesive
fashion toward some direction.
We did succeed in this respect and
are closer to a co-ed living
situation. Our major problem
remains with the national
fraternity."
While at one time the house
voted to break its national ties, a
consideration of alumni sentiment
led the group to "reconsider" and
reverse that decision. Now, even
after settlement of its dispute
with the University, Phi Gamma
Delta is faced with the prospect of
being "turned out" of its local
"accreditation" because of its
trend toward co-educational
living.

echoed Leland's desire to "get
over this stumbling block and
begin to work out a mutually
acceptable agreement toward a
co-ed situation."
National Pressure
The spokesmen for the
fraternity evaluated their original
decision to take in the girls as
being motivated by "a desire to
pull the house together so that we
could begin to move in a cohesive
fashion toward some direction.
We did succeed in this respect and
are closer to a co-ed living
situation. Our major problem
remains with the national
fraternity."
While at one time the house
voted to break its national ties, a
consideration of alumni sentiment
led the group to "reconsider" and
reverse that decision. Now, even
after settlement of its dispute
with the University, Phi Gamma
Delta is faced with the prospect of
being "turned out" of its local
"accreditation" because of its
trend toward co-educational
living.
The status of four female
boarders in the Phi Gamma Delta
house remained ambiguous
yesterday, as Dean of Students
Peter Bulkeley agreed to
"reconsider" his earlier decision
that the girls must immediately
find other housing.
At issue is the propriety of the
house's decision in the Fall to
admit the girls, without prior
consultation with the University.
"Fiji" is now in the midst of
controversy involving its national
"leaders", alumni, the Dean of
Students' office, and the members
of the local chapter, Lambda
Sigma. According to Charles
White, a spokesman for the
fraternity, "if Bulkeley says that
they can stay until the end of the
quarter, they will; if not the house
voted last night to ask them to
leave. In any event, we'll enter
into negotiations with the
University in regards to future
living arrangements after this
specific situation has been
settled."
The group's desire to bargain
eventually for a co-educational
living situation, expressed by
White, is meeting opposition from
the national organization and
alumni, who have threatened to
Uike the chapter into receivership
and ask some of its present cadre
to resign.
Hank Sayer, another member
of the local chapter, predicted
that such action would bring
about resistance from its
members, and that "legally, we
nave more of a right to the house
than does the national
organization." William Leland,
Associate Dean of Students,
supported Sayer's stand: "Insofar
as the lease agreement is
concerned, our concern is
primarily with the individuals
residing in the house," he said.
Leland went on to place the
question of the female boarders
within the contest of a general
lack of explicitness in the
relationships between the
University and the living units:
"We simply haven't made policies
ind agreements clear enough."

The Fiji house last year began
accomodating non-member
boarders, as do most of the other
fraternities. However, this Fall the
all-male organization decided to

allow four girfs to become
boarders. At this point a major
difference in interpretation
ensued.
The fraternity, according to
Chris Peck, viewed the inclusion
as "no real change" and did not
inform the Dean of Students of
their actions. In Bulkeley's view,
however "the presence of a girl
boarder did, in effect, make it a
co-ed living arrangement."
The Dean therefore, earlier
this week wrote to the fraternity
that "the girls would have to
move out. If a plan wasn't
forthcoming, I would feel obliged
to begin processes that would
enable the University to turn that
building into another kind of
residence."
Ambiquity
The Fiji response was first to
request another alternative: that
the girls be allowed to remain in
the building until the end of
winter quarter. But, after
consultation, they communicated
to Bulkeley that they would
comply with his decision and ask
the co-eds to leave immediately.
This decision made in a house
vote last night, was "taken under
advisement" by Bulkeley. He
proclaimed the matter "not
settled" as of that time, and
