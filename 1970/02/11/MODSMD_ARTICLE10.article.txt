Overseas Debute Clarification
Editor, THE DAILY:
The DAILY series on the
Overseas Campus Program made
many valid points. Most of the
problems mentioned, however,
have been beaten to death by
students overseas and here. The
problem with the series itself was
that it made very little positive

contribution. As Betsy Neville
pointed out Monday (Feb. 2), it's
time to stop bickering and get
down to work.
Although I was not quoted by
name, in several paragraphs of the
Friday article by Barry Askinas
and Dennis Perluss it is
abundantly clear that the
"recently returned resident
assistant" they referred to was
me. Those paragraphs were not
direct quotes, as implied, and
were used without my knowledge
or permission. The substance of
what was printed came from a
phone conversation between
Barry and me.
I stand by the thrust of the
arguments printed, but the
individual examples quoted are
petty compared to the issues
we're dealing with. If I had had
the opportunity to know I'd be
quoted, I would have made a
similar argument, perhaps, but
using more well-founded examples
and without the overtones of
character assassination which were
present.
Upon returning from Italy last
July, I felt there were many
aspects of the program which
needed to be reevaluated and
changed. Having worked within
the administration for a year I
know from my own
experience — not from
hearsay — that there is
administrative waste, inefficiency,
and reluctance to change.
Because I am concerned about
the overseas program, I made my

interest known and am now a
member of the Academic Senate
Committee on Foreign Study
Programs. This committee and its
subcommittees for each campus
are, in effect, the program's new
directors. The subcommittees are
charged with complete control of
their respective campus, and the
central committee serves a
co ordin a t in g—rather than
veto —function vis-a-vis the
separate campuses.
I have chosen, rather than to
stir uninformed debate, to work
within this new committee
structure and see if we can make
the needed changes. If I find this
course impossible, peple will hear
about it through the Daily. You
must remember that the main
committee just began meeting in
January, and that the
subcommittees were finally
constituted only last week. Give
us a chance!
Already I have doubts, as does
Prof. Packer (Daily, Feb. 2). I
agree with him that if Dr. Walker
"cannot accomodate himself to
changes in needs and wants, he
should be encouraged to resign."
Dr. Walker will be on trial, and
we, as the committee members,
will be on trial. One month is
hardly sufficient time to judge the
results of the new arrangement,
and until the circumstances
warrant it I refuse to allow myself
to be associated with impassioned
pleas for change.

course impossible, peple will hear
about it through the Daily. You
must remember that the main
committee just began meeting in
January, and that the
subcommittees were finally
constituted only last week. Give
us a chance!
Already I have doubts, as does
Prof. Packer (Daily, Feb. 2). I
agree with him that if Dr. Walker
"cannot accomodate himself to
changes in needs and wants, he
should be encouraged to resign."
Dr. Walker will be on trial, and
we, as the committee members,
will be on trial. One month is
hardly sufficient time to judge the
results of the new arrangement,
and until the circumstances
warrant it I refuse to allow myself
to be associated with impassioned
pleas for change.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The DAILY series on the
Overseas Campus Program made
many valid points. Most of the
problems mentioned, however,
have been beaten to death by
students overseas and here. The
problem with the series itself was
that it made very little positive

contribution. As Betsy Neville
pointed out Monday (Feb. 2), it's
time to stop bickering and get
down to work.
Although I was not quoted by
name, in several paragraphs of the
Friday article by Barry Askinas
and Dennis Perluss it is
abundantly clear that the
"recently returned resident
assistant" they referred to was
me. Those paragraphs were not
direct quotes, as implied, and
were used without my knowledge
or permission. The substance of
what was printed came from a
phone conversation between
Barry and me.
I stand by the thrust of the
arguments printed, but the
individual examples quoted are
petty compared to the issues
we're dealing with. If I had had
the opportunity to know I'd be
quoted, I would have made a
similar argument, perhaps, but
using more well-founded examples
and without the overtones of
character assassination which were
present.
Upon returning from Italy last
July, I felt there were many
aspects of the program which
needed to be reevaluated and
changed. Having worked within
the administration for a year I
know from my own
experience — not from
hearsay — that there is
administrative waste, inefficiency,
and reluctance to change.
Because I am concerned about
the overseas program, I made my

interest known and am now a
member of the Academic Senate
Committee on Foreign Study
Programs. This committee and its
subcommittees for each campus
are, in effect, the program's new
directors. The subcommittees are
charged with complete control of
their respective campus, and the
central committee serves a
co ordin a t in g—rather than
veto —function vis-a-vis the
separate campuses.
I have chosen, rather than to
stir uninformed debate, to work
within this new committee
structure and see if we can make
the needed changes. If I find this
course impossible, peple will hear
about it through the Daily. You
must remember that the main
committee just began meeting in
January, and that the
subcommittees were finally
constituted only last week. Give
