# Huey's Birthday Rally
## Free Political Prisoners! 
### Miriam Cherry 
You may have heard about the
birthday rally for Huey P.
Newton. Unless you know Huey,
which is having an understanding
of his soul, you may not perceive
the attraction of such a program.
Possibly the implications of
being a political prisoner in the
U.S. are too hard to absorb, deep
down. Therefore, other priorities
are given a higher rating than
Huey's life, his beliefs, and the
struggle that created the
background for his present
isolation. Yet it's unlikely that
Huey would be in a prison cell
today as a political prisoner if he
hadn't been profoundly touched
by what's happening to all of us.
Under the sign of Aquarius,
Huey Percy Newton will be
twenty-eight years old this
February 17. Born in Louisiana,
and named after Huey Long (not
his hero), a year later, the family
moved to California. When he
dropped out of Oakland Technical
High School at 16, because he was
told by school authorities that he
was not "college material," Huey
could neither read nor write.
Through self-determination,
however, he became literate by
age 17, attended Merritt College
in Oakland, and went to law
school for six months. As his
knowledge of European history,
language and culture expanded, he
saw its contrast not only to the
African culture, but to that of the
non-white experience in the
Chicano, Chinese, and Black
ghettos of the U.S.
Man's Dignity
Realizing that the Black slave
oppression still has its remnants in
this land, and must be dealt with
in terms more than intellectual
chit-chat, he founded the Black
Panther Party in 1966.

Combining his philosophy of
man's dignity with action, can
best be told by Huey in the
following transcript of his
testimony on August 22, 1968. It
is taken from the trial of Huey P.
Newton, accused of the murder of
Policeman John Frey. Mr. Charles
Garry is the attorney for the
defense:
MR. GARRY: Q. My question is,
Mr. Newton, what was done to
implement the program which the
Black Panther Party in its
operation in in the black ghetto
performed?
A. Well, we set up patrols to
observe the police or the gestapo
as they are called in the black
community and with three or four
guys we would ride in a car at
various parts of the black ghetto,
with a tape recorder, cameras, and
weapons, and we would observe
the police and make sure that no
violence was committed in our
community because the Black
Panthers stand against violence.
We want peace at home and peace
abroad."
MR. GARRY: Q. Mr. Newton,
would you describe a typical
patrol and how it was conducted?
A. Yes. .. . "If we saw anyone
stopped we would stay a
reasonable distance from the
person if a person is stopped by
the police, and we would also
have our law book and we would
re; J to the person his basic rights,
his constitutional rights to have an
attorney present if he is going to
answer any questions, and the
right to silence and so forth. And
we would do this daily and along
with it we would also recruit
people, and we have also followed
the police wagons to the jail and

we bail people out when we
thought that the person was being
done an injustice."
Q. Now, Mr. Newton, what
difficulties, if any were
encountered while you were on
patrol duty yourself?"
A. Well, we saw a decrease in the
abuse of the general community,
but an increase of the harrassment
of the Black Panther Party itself.
The Police would stop the Black
Panthers, or members of the Black
Panther Party and they would
harrass us and arrest us for no
apparent reason, and I have
personally been harrassed in this
fashion for maybe forty or fifty
times . .
Free Huey
More of the transcript would
indicate the lack of evidence
produced by the court which
found Huey guilty of voluntary
manslaughter with a sentence of
1-15 years. The news reporters
who covered the trial could relate
how amazed they were to see his
calm, his openness and the
apparent truth of his statements.
Beyond the beauty of Huey's
personal witness are the lessons
within a functional movement for
change; namely, the ability to
recruit people who are in the heat
of action and to organize NOW
around the needs of a
community. This is Huey's kind
of leadership and accounts for his
being a political prisoner. His
birthday rally will speak more
convincingly of how his spirit lives
on. Free Huey! Free all political
prisoners!
