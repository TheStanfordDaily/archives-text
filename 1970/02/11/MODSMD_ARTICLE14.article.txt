# Discriminate?

(Karen S.Y. Ho, a senior in physics applying to various physics
graduate schools, received the following reply from Washington
University in St. Louis. Her reaction to the administrative bungle is
included.)
To Oriental Applicants:
Enclosed are the literature and forms concerning graduate study in
physics at Washington University which you requested recently. The
only kind of financial aid which we can possible provide is as a
Graduate Teaching Assistant, because of the fact that other awards
(Traineeships, Fellowships, etc.) are not available to non-U.S. citizens.
Unfortunately we find that we cannot very often risk the award of
a Graduate Teaching Assistantship to an Oriental candidate because
the danger of an unsatisfactory language-teaching situation is very
high. We have occasionally taken this risk anyway, in cases where the
scientific potential of the candidate seemed to be so unusually great
that we could not afford to turn him away.
Should you decide to submit an application, please do so in the
full realization that your chances of success are really very small,
perhaps one in a hundred, at best one in fifty. With this in mind, I
sincerely suggest that you consider carefully whether or not your
qualifications and your potential are really as good as they ought to
be to make an application worthwhile.
The most likely candidates will be top of their class in the very
best universities, or, even better, will have succeeded already at the
graduate level at one of the best universities. They will also be able to
produce convincing evidence of good command of conversational
English.

Miss Ho's Reply
Sir:
This is to acknowledge receipt of the application forms for
graduate study in physics which included a statement "To Oriental
Applicants."
As a native born U.S. citizen, a senior physics major at Stanford
University, 1 find this highly degrading. As a matter of fact, this letter
would be insulting to any student including a foreign student.
Furthermore, what screening techniques were used to establish that I
am an Oriental and therefore "a non-U.S. citizen?"
An explanation is in order.
Sincerely,
Karen S.Y. 110
