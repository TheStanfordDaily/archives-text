# Interviewing 475 Pushers
## Study Focuses On Drug Usage 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
"Too many reactionaries and
people on the extreme left feel
that they know all the answers
about drugs. They feel that since
they've got all the truth, why
bother to continue looking. Our
research is a badly-needed attempt
to get information on drug usage
not based on any preconceived
notions."
The speaker is Jean Paul
Smith, a research associate at the
Stanford Institute for the Study
of Human Problems. Smith is
currently conducting a study on
drug usage in the Bay Area.
Although financed by contract
from the Justice Department,
Smith says the study is not
concerned with enforcement.
Smith, a fairly easy-going and
soft-spoken man says,"The narcs
would really be in sad shape if
they had me as one of them. t ,The
study is only an attempt on their
part to get some reliable
information on the problems with
which they are dealing."

The study, designed by
Richard Blum, also a research
associate at the Human Problems
Institute and author of The
Utopiates, Students and Drugs,
and Society and Drugs, is
specifically examining two aspects
of drug usage.
The first area of the study is
concerned with family correlates
in drug usage. This part of the
study is attempting to discover if
and in what ways drug usage is
linked with variables in family
living patterns, including family
values, structure, and attitudes.
The study will also examine
patterns of illicit drug
distribution, the main focus of
which has been numerous
interviews with Bay Area pushers.
Smith admitted that there was an
initial obstacle in gaining access to
subjects. "We had to find people
familiar with the drug scene and
people accepted by the drug
culture.

"People were initially very
skeptical," says Smith. "The only
way most people think of the
Justice Department is in terms of
enforcement." However, he adds,
"once the initial skepticism was
overcome, and people realized we
weren't going to turn them in,
they were very cooperative."
Smith feels there are two
reasons why people have been so
cooperative, first, the study is
open. "It is not classified or
restricted in any way." Secondly,
says Smith, "the results can be
used by anybody, whatever their
point of view. It was not
undertaken to justify any
particular point of view."
At this point, over 475 Bay
Area dealers have been
interviewed. The study, says
Smith, is not an attempt to
present a definitive picture on
how dealers operate. "Rather," he
says,"it is an attempt to merely
find out what dealing is in one
place at one point in time. We're
mainly interested in the

behavioral aspects of illicit drug
distribution," he adds.
"The type of questions we're
asking are: Which drugs do they
sell, and how much? Which drugs
don't they sell and why? Which
drugs do they themselves use?
What are their impressions of
other dealers? Has anyone
stopped selling and, if so, why?
What are their feelings about
present drug laws?"
The final question concerning
the laws, says Smith, is a good
check on the questionnaire, since
the coding scheme for the
questionnaire is set up in such a
way that each individual's
personal opinions determine the
way in which his questionnaire is
scored, thus eliminating some
experimental bias.
None of the data collected so
far has been tabulated. Smith says
that the studies will be concluded
during summer of 1971.
Smith became involved in the
drug problem, when he joined the
Bureau of Drug Abuse Control in
1966. In March, 1968, when
President Johnson moved the
bureau from the Food and Drug
Administration to the Justice
Department, Smith became the
director of the Division of Drug
Studies, a team of research
specialists concerned with learning
about drugs and their effects.
At the time says Smith, the
government was very concerned
with formulating policies on drugs
and drug control.
Partly as a result of their

studies, says Smith, the position
taken by the bureau was
essentially the one being proposed
in the Omnibus Controlled
Dangerous Substances Act
presently before Congress. This
bill reduces the penalty on the
first offense for possession of
marijuana to a misdemeanor and
allows any judge to "wipe the
slate clean." The person would
therefore have no criminal record
for his first offense.
Discussing the problem of
drugs in general, Smith feels that
one major problem area in drug
control is that "states generally
have such different schemes and
controls concerning drugs that it's
impossible to keep track of them
or find any uniformity. It's very
obvious that some fairly drastic
changes have to be made in state
drug control practices."
Smith feels, however, that the
main question the government is
presently faced with is the question
of long term effects of continued
moderate marijuana usage. "In
any study, says Smith it's
important first to analyze and
isolate the problem you're trying
to solve, and this is the question
the government is currently
devoting most of its attention to."
Having been at Stanford since
last July, Smith is teaching a
course in the Psychology of the
Human Personality this quarter.
After finishing his study here, he's
not sure of his plans.
"Grantsmanship is an uncertain
life," he says.
