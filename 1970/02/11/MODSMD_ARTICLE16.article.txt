# Black Studies Results

### 
(AP) â€” The cry for black studies
stretched across the land last year,
threading through peaceful
protest and violent confrontation.
What has resulted from the
demands that ranged from special
courses to separate black studies
departments
An Associated Press survey of
campuses in 40 states and the
District of Columbia shows:
1. Some 250 institutions
offered for the first time last fall
courses related to black studies.
2. At least 14 institutions
began offering bachelor's degrees
in black studies in separate
programs, and the Atlanta
University system and San
Francisco State College plan
masters degrees in black studies.
3. There has been little
movement toward establishment
of separate black studies
departments.
4. Controversy still swirls over
the quality of black studies
courses; whether black studies
courses should be integrated or
restricted only to black students;
and over their staffing and
administrative control.
Demands Unreasonable
Regarding a separate black
studies department, the
administration of Murray State

College, Murray, Ky., rejected the
request as "catering to a small
group." At the University of
Nebraska, Lincoln, the dean of
faculties reported "demands for a
separatist black studies program
was something we could not
accept."
Typical new courses reflect the
contributions of blacks to
American literature and history.
Other courses suggest more exotic
content, such as black rhetoric,
black psychology, and history of
black Christianity. All courses are
accredited, but nearly always are
elective.
Educators caution against using
enrollment statistics as an
indication of success or failure of
black studies. They have pointed
out that many students "audit" or
merely sit in on courses that are
new in the catalogues. They also
noted that even at large, urban
institutions with impressive black
studies programs, controversy
persists over student control,
course content, and whether black
studies should be integrated.
S.F. State
But, at San Francisco State
black studies registrations are off

semester administrators at San
Francisco State College report.
a year ago
focused on students' demands for
an autonomous Black Studies
Department.
Officials say it's too early to
tell whether the figure means
anything because two weeks
remain to register for or drop
courses for the second semester.
A spokesman said black study
course registrations are down to
881 compared with 1,204 last
semester, but pointed out that
native American course

registrations are down to 77
compared with 1 50 last semester.
Overenrollmen t
''There was heavy
overenroilment in some black
study courses," he added. "In one
class supposed to have 40 students
there were more than 100. This is
being corrected, and there are
some one-semester courses that
are not being repeated this
semester."
The new chairman of ethnic
studies, which does not yet have
departmental status, is Miss Pat
Thornton, a literature teacher
from Xavier University in New
Orleans.
She has over-all supervision of
black and native American
studies, as well as Asian and
Mexican-American courses.
Courses havy 502 registrations
this semester compared with 542
last semester.
Mexican-American Registration
Mexican - American course
registration actually has increased
from 292 to 298.
At the University of Colorado
at Boulder, a course in America's
black revolution drew 500
students. Only 75 were expected.
But the university's total black
studies program attracted only
200 students, far less than
university officials expected. A
black Colorado student Sandy
Washington, said, "The start is real
good, but there could be a lot of
improvements." There are just
over 26,000 students at the
school.
At the University of Indiana,
with 47,000 students, a new
course, "The Black Community as
an Internal Colony," drew 86
students, twice the number
anticipated.
There was a general reluctance
to attribute the relative campus
calm during the fall semester to
black studies gains. Edgar
Beckham, associate provost at
Wesleyan University in
Middletown Conn, said the
school's new Afro-American
Institute "fortunately was not
successful in quelling controversy,
but it was successful in focusing
the controversy in productive ways
Related Courses
At Beloit College, Wisconsin,
scene of firebombings and
boycotts last year, David Mason,
an assistant to the president,
observed, "We have no specific
new courses relating to blacks, but
it is possible that certain courses
may now be more related to black
studies approaches than they were
before."
The major points of
disagreement as the spring
semester began, appeared to be
the degree of student control and
students' resentment over what
they claimed were traditional
courses being rechristened black
studies. Only in isolated cases
have students gained any voice in
the administration of black
studies programs.
