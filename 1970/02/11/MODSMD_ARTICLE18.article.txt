# Arnett Declares For State Senate Seat
## 
### 
Dixon Arnett, former narc and
currently director of community
relations at Stanford, yesterday
announced his candidacy for the
Republican nomination for State
Senator from San Mateo County.
Arnett emphasized law and
order as a major campaign issue
and said, "I know the problems
and the frustrations of law
enforcement because I have served
as a law enforcement officer myself
with the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics." Arnett served as an
undercover agent during 1960, the
same year he graduated from
Stanford.
He stated, "I do not think
public officials in California are
aware of the problems of
organized crime here," and said
that if elected he would initiate
meaningful legislation to stop
Mafia activities in the state.

Arnett criticized incumbent
republican Richard J. Dolwig's
inability to work closely with the
leadership of the State Senate. He
said, "San Mateo's problems are
too large to leave in the hands of a
man who has lost the confidence
of the leadership in his own party,
in his own house of the
legislature."
He cited his own experience as
his best qualification. Arnett has
worked for ten years in the
county Republican party, has been
an officer in the Army and Army
National Guard, and has served as
a Redwood City Councilman.
Jumping on the environment
bandwagon, Arnett called for "an
overview of the total needs of
environmental control." He said
"I know the problems and the
opportunities of environmental
control, because I have just
completed a year's assignment as
Program Executive Director of
national UNESCO conference on
this very subject."
Responding to a reporter's
question about the cost of his
campaign, Arnett said it would be
on the order of 100,000 dollars,
but that he hoped it would not
run that high.
He said that so far his major
support at Stanford has come
from the members of his office.
