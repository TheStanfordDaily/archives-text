### 
Sabbioneta, a model city built
from scratch during the
Renaissance, will be the topic of a
lecture by Art Prof. Kurt Forster
at 8 p.m. today in the Nathan
Cummings Art Building
auditorium.
The talk is the second in a
series of four being presented this
quarter on the subject of "The
Planned Environment." The Art
Department and the Committee
for Art are the sponsors.
Sabbioneta, built between
1550 and 1590 as an undertaking
of one of the Gonzaga dukes is
located in the center of upper
Italy. Created for about 3,000 to
4,000 inhabitants, it still exists in
what is now a rural area.
Forster, credited with bringing
the Renaissance model city to
awareness again, is preparing a
monograph on the subject. He has
already written several scholarly
articles about it.
He considers Sabbioneta an
outstanding example of
Renaissance planning, and points
out that it was built freely, with a
plan, to provide a model. All the
functions of the small city are
accommodated and "ideally
fulfilled."
He terms it "a city, thought
through completely, to provide
solutions for all the city
functions." In addition, Forster
has found Sabbioneta a
fascinating area of study "because
it encompassed the whole life
range of the later Renaissance."
