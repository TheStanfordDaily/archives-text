## Nixon Plans Pollution Action 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - With a
blitz of rhetoric, action and
publicity, the Nixon
administration has taken a giant
step forward in the undeclared
war to deprive Democrats of a
favorite and potent issue—the
deteriorating American
environment.
The latest move in the
President's environmental drive is
a 3 7-point message sent to
Congress Tuesday, including 23
proposals for new legislation.
Nixon's proposals have drawn
immediate counterfire from
congressional Democrats, many of
whom were identified with the
issue long before it acquired
political glamour.
Members of both parties
acknowledge that public
concern —based on scientific cries
of alarm and buttressed by
personal experience—has made the
question of environmental quality
an issue translatable in votes.
Up to the time of Nixon's
message, Democrats sounded the
theme that his program involved
more talk than action and lacked
the muscle and money needed to
reverse the tide of polluted
streams, toxic air and indisposable
garbage.
But many now concede
privately the new competition to
be identified as proenvironment
will help generate the motion
needed to pass and fund effective
antipollution programs.
Berkeley How
BERKELEY (AP) - About 300
young people disrupted the
Berkeley City Council meeting
Tuesday night, chanting in front
of city hall: "We want in!" The
throng pressed against the
doorway and was moved back by
12 police, who made one arrest.
Inside, a capacity audience of
more than 100 persons filled the
council chambers for discussion of

a police request to buy two
helicopters.
After the meeting began,
covering other topics first, the air
was filled with dozens of paper
airplanes, prompting mayor
Wallace Johnson to say:
"Will the children stop
throwing airplanes?"
Russia On Berlin
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Soviet Union Tuesday agreed to
hold four-power talks on the
future of Berlin, diplomatic
observers reported.
Soviet notes, replying to
Western initiatives of Dec. 16,
were received by the U.S., British,
and French embassies in Moscow
Tuesday morning. The one
addressed to the United States is
now under careful study and
American officials declined to go
beyond acknowledging that the
note was received.
Diplomatic observers said,
however, that Moscow's reply was
affirmative and suggested that
representatives of the four powers
convene.
Minority Hiring
Harvard university has
announced the signing of a
construction contract it feels to
be the first in the United States
which obligates the builder to hire
a specific number of minority
workers.
The contract, with the Jackson
Construction Company of
Needham, Mass. was worked out
by Harvard overseer, Clifford
Alexander Jr., former chairman of
the Federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
The agreement requires
Jackson to employ between 19
and 23 percent black and other
minority workers in the

construction of two new campus
buildings. The agreement also
requires minority employment
spread over the whole range of
construction jobs—not just in the
lower-paying ones.
The agreement comes in the
wake of a stormy semester in
which blacks demanded 20
percent black employment on all
University construction projects.

The agreement comes in the
wake of a stormy semester in
which blacks demanded 20
percent black employment on all
University construction projects.
WASHINGTON (AP) - With a
blitz of rhetoric, action and
publicity, the Nixon
administration has taken a giant
step forward in the undeclared
war to deprive Democrats of a
favorite and potent issue—the
deteriorating American
environment.
The latest move in the
President's environmental drive is
a 3 7-point message sent to
Congress Tuesday, including 23
proposals for new legislation.
Nixon's proposals have drawn
immediate counterfire from
congressional Democrats, many of
whom were identified with the
issue long before it acquired
political glamour.
Members of both parties
acknowledge that public
concern —based on scientific cries
of alarm and buttressed by
personal experience—has made the
question of environmental quality
an issue translatable in votes.
Up to the time of Nixon's
message, Democrats sounded the
theme that his program involved
more talk than action and lacked
the muscle and money needed to
reverse the tide of polluted
streams, toxic air and indisposable
garbage.
But many now concede
privately the new competition to
be identified as proenvironment
will help generate the motion
needed to pass and fund effective
antipollution programs.
Berkeley How
BERKELEY (AP) - About 300
young people disrupted the
Berkeley City Council meeting
Tuesday night, chanting in front
of city hall: "We want in!" The
throng pressed against the
doorway and was moved back by
12 police, who made one arrest.
Inside, a capacity audience of
more than 100 persons filled the
council chambers for discussion of

a police request to buy two
helicopters.
After the meeting began,
covering other topics first, the air
was filled with dozens of paper
airplanes, prompting mayor
Wallace Johnson to say:
"Will the children stop
throwing airplanes?"
Russia On Berlin
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Soviet Union Tuesday agreed to
hold four-power talks on the
future of Berlin, diplomatic
observers reported.
Soviet notes, replying to
Western initiatives of Dec. 16,
were received by the U.S., British,
and French embassies in Moscow
Tuesday morning. The one
addressed to the United States is
now under careful study and
American officials declined to go
beyond acknowledging that the
note was received.
Diplomatic observers said,
however, that Moscow's reply was
affirmative and suggested that
representatives of the four powers
convene.
Minority Hiring
Harvard university has
announced the signing of a
construction contract it feels to
be the first in the United States
which obligates the builder to hire
a specific number of minority
workers.
The contract, with the Jackson
Construction Company of
Needham, Mass. was worked out
by Harvard overseer, Clifford
Alexander Jr., former chairman of
the Federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
The agreement requires
Jackson to employ between 19
and 23 percent black and other
minority workers in the

construction of two new campus
buildings. The agreement also
requires minority employment
spread over the whole range of
construction jobs—not just in the
lower-paying ones.
The agreement comes in the
wake of a stormy semester in
which blacks demanded 20
percent black employment on all
University construction projects.
