## Starr And Sellers Sell Out 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
The Magic Christian is a
miraculous conception. Peter
Sellers and Ringo Starr come
across like professional strong arm
men working over the
establishment, and walking out of
the theatre, the viewer may find
himself checking for bruises. The
story focuses around Sir Guy
Grand, the world's richest man,
who encounters a vagrant sleeping
in St. James Park and pays him to
become his son. The adoption
papers are drawn up and the duo
embarks on a game of "cause for
pause," to prove to themselves
and society that money will buy
anything or anyone.
Grand employs his millions to
pull elaborate pranks to bungle
outmoded insitutuions and
confound people who are just
plain mean. He succeeds in
stunning a nation with events
ranging from a theatrical Hamlet
doing a strip-tease during his
soliloquy to bribing a traffic
warden to eat a parking ticket-all
for a price.
Peter Sellers executes the role
of Sir Guy Grand remarkably. He

employs a vast store of various
mannerisms and voices in dealing
with people - a character
appropriate to each of the people
being dealt with from the hot-dog
vendor at a railway station to the
wealthy snobs aboard the S.S.
Magic Christian. He manages to
ridicule each of the various people
in turn by bringing to light the
hypocricy of their values.
Sellers Versatile
His appearance is modeled
after that of a young Albert
Schweitzer but his demeanor is
opposite for rather than giving
dignity to people, he manages to
strip them of their auras. His
performance is polished and
versatile, proving he deserves the
high regard given him as a
comedian.
Sellers' versatility is contrasted
by Ringo Starr's unwavering
consistency which makes his role
of Youngman Grand
interchangeable with the
characters portrayed in HELP,
HARD DAY'S NIGHT, or
CANDY. Youngman Grand is
Ringo Starr-simple and
unassuming, a sponge ready to
absorb his adopted father's
teachings about man and his
corruptability.
Ringo Dispensable
Although he is in most of the
film, the part Starr plays is
somewhat dispensable, still his
deadpan and natural style of

acting makes him enjoyable.
Several fine actors contribute
skillful cameo roles in the film.
Laurence Harvey burlesques
Hamlet, Christopher Lee is
highlighted as the S.S. Magic
Christian's ship's vampire, and
Spike Milligan creates a bumbling
portrait of a traffic warden.
Raquel Welch's role as the slave
priestess overseeing the galley of
88 topless rowers who form the
"engine room" of the ship proves
that Raquel Welch is. . .well. .

.Raquel Welch.
McCartney Performance Poor
Possibly the poorest
performance in the film comes
from Paul McCartney who was
not in the film but wrote the
theme song "Come and Get It."
The music is forced and actually
detracts from the scenes in which
it appears. Its message of "if you
want it (money) here it is, come
and get it," is sufficiently
reinforced in the visual aspects of
the film and the music is

repetitious. The Magic Christian
isn't necessarily a film that will be
liked because it is so true.
Director Joseph McGrath employs
Terry Southern's story skillfully
and a work with something to
offend everyone emerges. Some
will judge some of the scenes to
be in poor taste, but this only
highlights the fact that much of
what people do is in poor taste.
Go and see the film take its jabs at
a variety of sacred cows-and you
still may not believe it.


TOPLESS ROWERS under the command of slave priestess Raquel Welch, now appear with Ringo Starr in "The Magic
Christian."
