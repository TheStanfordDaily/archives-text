# The
						Dead Letter
## A
						Day Before The Judge 
### NEIL ARNET 
Dear Fran,
Yesterday at lunch you
mentioned that you hadn't seen
me much this quarter, so I
thought I'd write. And, because
you live only two miles from my
place, I might even deliver this
letter personally.
Since you mentioned that you
received another parking ticket,
I've decided to re-create especially
for you the exciting courtroom
drama which I experienced
exactly three weeks ago.
Clerk: All rise. (The judge enters,
walks behind the bench, and sits
down.) The Santa Clara County
Municipal Court, Judge
Feignsworth presiding, is now in
session. Be seated.
Judge Feignsworth: We have
several cases on tap today. Miss
Reader, will you through the list
please?
Miss Reader: Cases numbers 16
and 17. Your honor, there are two
separate cases involving the same
person - Santa Clara County vs.
Neil Arnet for parking in an illegal
zone. Case 16: Officer Zeberas
and Case 17: Officer Lester.
Judge Feignsworth: Are all the
parties in attendance? (Three arms
go up.) Good.
Judge Feignsworth: iv!r. Arnet,
take a seat please. (I get up from
the gallery and take a seat at the
long table.) Do you want to be
tried on both these cases
together?
Me:(smiling broadly) Yes sir. I
might as well since my argument
on both violations is the same.
Judge Feignsworth: All right. Miss
Reader, swear in Officer Zeberas.
(She does so, and he proceeds to
take the stand. As he sits down he
flashes me a friendly grin.)
Mr. Daley:(rising from his chair
and then studying his noted
before he begins) Officer, Zeberas,
where do you work?
Zeberas: The Stanford Police
Station. During the day I patrol
the parking lots.
Mr. Daley: Where were you at
10:40 on the morning of October
15th?
Zeberas:l was in the parking lot
behind the main library.
Mr. Daley: And did you see Mr.
Arnet's car?
Zeberas:(smiling at me again) Yes,
I did. It was parked illegally. You
see, the rows are marked off on
the ends by boards painted red.
It's illegal to park on the outside
of these boards. That's where Mr.
Arnet's car was parked.
Mr. Daley :Thank you, Officer
Zeberas. That's all, your honor.
Judge Ceignsworth: All right. Mr.
Arnet, would you like to direct
any questions to this witness?
Me: Yes sir, just one.
Judge Feignsworth: Go ahead.
Me: (I leaned back in my chair,
delighted at the fun I was having.
Officer Zeberas smiled.) Sir, isn't
it true that often times a great
many Stanford students are
forced to park illegally because of
the fact that there is insufficient
parking?
Zeberas:(in a quite friendly
manner) Evidently so, judging at
least by the number of cars
parked illegally every day.
Me: (pleasantly surprised by the
answer) Thank you very much.
That's all your honor. (Officer
Zeberas stepped down, and
Officer Lester took the stand. He
is older and gruff looking.
However, his gray hair and heavy
torso make him appear more tired
than mean.)
Daley: Officer Lester, where do
you work?
Officer Lester: I work for the
Stanford Police, and I give out
tickets for illegal parking.
Mr. Daley: Where were you at
10:30 on the morning of
November 1 2th?
Lester: I was in the parking lot
behind the main library.
Mr. Daley: And did you see Mr.
Arnet's car.
Lester: (routinely) Yes, I did.
Next to the library are several

white poles. Bicycle riders and
pedestrians go through the poles.
There's no parking there. His car
was parked by those poles.
Mr. Daley: Thank you, Officer
Lester. That's all, your honor.
Judge Feignsworth:All right. Mr.
Arnet, would you like to direct
any questions to this witness?
Mc: (quite amused by the
proceedings and eager to continue
on in my Perry Mason bit) Yes,
sir. I do. Officer Lester, did I leave
enough room for pedestrians and
bike riders to pass, that is, was I
blocking their way?
Lester:No, they could still pass.
Me: Is it true that this ticket
occurred in the same parking lot
where the previous violation
supposedly occurred?
Lester: Yes, but not in the same
area.
Me: Is it also true that the parking
lot serves for the new Art Building
as well as the library?
Lester: Yes, it does. The art
building is near the poles.
Me:(slowing for emphasis) Yes,
that's right. And is it also true
that there is no loading zone
available to the Art Building?
Lester: There is a chain across two
of the poles? sometimes it is
down.
Me: Where was it that day?
Lester: It was up.
Me: One more question. Isn't it
true that. . .1 mean, is it true that
the door to my car and also my
trunk were open?
Lester:(hesitating, but obviously
having no recall of this matter) I
don't remember.
M e :(disappointed) Well, okay.
Thank you. (Officer Lester steps
down, and he takes a seat along
with Mr. Delve and Officer
Zeberas.
Judge Feignsworth: All right. Mr.
Arnet, is there anything you'd like
to add?
Me: Well, I guess so.
Judge Feignsworth: You don't
have to unless you want to.
Me: (smiling) No. I want to. Why
not? (I am sworn in and take the

stand. After glancing about the
courtroom and eyeing the judge, I
begin.) Last quarter I had a
sculpture class which met at
10:00 on Monday and
Wednesday. On some days I
would have a heavy piece to bring
to class, and since I didn't want to
walk two, three or more blocks
with something heavy and
cumbersome, I'd park where I
could near the art building.
Judge Feignsworth:(smiling
slightly also) Sometimes you have
to make sacrifices. . .especially for
art. (laughter in the courtroom)
What kinds of things were you
carrying?
Me: On one occassion I had a
wrought iron piece of two men
facing each other across a brideg. I
think the other occassion I had a
big plexiglass box with beer cans
arranged in it. It was particularly
heavy because sixteen of the cans
were still full. More importantly,
I'd like to say that when I
received the second ticket, I had
left my door and trunk open to
indicate that I was loading or
unloading something. After all, a
person doesn't generally leave his
car door and trunk open. It would
seem to suggest that there was a
reason for parking beside the
white poles.
Judge F eignsworth : (patiently)
Yes, that may be true, but you
still were parking illegally. Is there
anything else that you'd like to
say? —
Me:(with a half laugh) Just that I
hope something's done about the
parking problem. (I step down and
return to my seat before the
table.)
Judge Feignsworth :Mr. Arnet, I
sympathize with your situation,
but that problem is the
university's. You're guilty of the
violations. Because you did amuse
the court, although taking up its
time, I'll charge you $2 for each
ticket.
Me: (somewhat hurt becuase I
wasn't absolved, but happy at not
having to pay $5 per ticket)
Thank you, your honor.

Well, Fran, that was the
courtroom drama. The officers
and I left the courtroom at the
same time. We happened to meet
downstairs in the parking lot. We
shook hands and introduced
ourselves. Officer Zeberas
couldn't believe that I only had to
pay two dollars per ticket. As we
walked toward my car, he
commented, "You were really
lucky. I remember when I got
your car. It was a jaguar, wasn't
it\" In amazement I replied, "No,
in fact, it's that Nova right over
there." To this he only remarked,
"Oh. I guess the jaguar was
somebody else's." Then Officer
Lester comes out confidently with
the statement, "Yeah, but when I
got you, you still had your VW
van, didn't you." Incredulously I
answered, "No, I had the Nova
then, too." That was about it,
except they did try to explain how
the tickets were given out.
It seems that in past years all
violators were given Stanford
parking tickets. However, this
year the Stanford police revised
this system so that only cars
having current Stanford parking
stickers received Stanford tickets.
All others received tickets from
Santa Clara County. Whereas
Stanford tickets are only two
dollars ejfch, the County tickets
were five dollars. However, it
turns out that as of January Ist
the latter tickets are also only two
dollars.
Now it is my opinion that
buying a parking sticker for the
year is a waste of ten dollars.
Except for a handful of Off
Campus parking spaces (they do
give tickets for parking in them
without the sticker), there's no
place you or I can't park without
a sticker that we could otherwise
use if we had the sticker. Like the
ten dollar registration fee doesn't
afford a person any advantage,
except a ten dollar loss.
Okay, Fran, that's it for today.
I'm late for a class.
Peace,
Neil
