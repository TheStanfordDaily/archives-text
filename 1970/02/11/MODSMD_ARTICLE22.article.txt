# Reader Attacks 'Shadow' As Dated Cold War Polemic
## 
### JIM ROTH 
"Shadow of Heroes" may be well produced,
well directed, and well performed, as Mr. Ungar
claims in his review of the play in the Daily (Feb.
6). But for other reasons, the play is terrible.
The play's narrator makes a big thing of
presenting a "documentary" of post World War II
Hungary and the events and characters involved in
the precipitation of the 1956 Hungarian
Revolution. But the play is not a documentary.
Events and characters are greatly distorted, as I
will explain below.
"Shadow of Heroes" is a very clever cold war
polemic, the work of a skilled and unscrupulous
propagandist. While insisting upon the
"objectivity" of his presentation and centering
attention on a Communist leader with a problem
of conflicting loyalties, Ardrey manages to build
and reinforce all the common American
stereotypes surrounding Communism,
Communists, and the "heroes" who fight them.
Red Perils
All the Communist Party leaders and
functionaries (except the one with conflicting
loyalties) are "bad." They are either cynical,
ruthless, stupid, self-seeking or any combination of
these characteristics. It is never made clear that the
leaders and instigators of the Revolution itself
were almost all Communists in ideology, and most
by party affiliation.
The precipitation of the Revolution is
attributed largely to Julia Rajk in the play. Her
importance is greatly exaggerated at the expense
of the leadership of socialist intellectuals and
workers. Explicit political commentary is left out;
thus, nothing is said about the demands of
revolutionary groups. These demands all
mentioned the desire for "socialist democracy,"
and most of them reflected a desire for workers to
take over the management of the factories in
which they worked. None of them called for the
return of capitalist enterprise.
No .Socialism
On the other hand, an appeal is made in the
play almost exclusively to nationalist sentiments

and the horrors of Communist practice. A major
figure in the Revolution, Imre Nagy, is provided
with a walk-on part. In this role he speaks only of
nationalist aspirations, a multi-party system and
other demands acceptable to an American public.
He is not allowed to repeat those things he said
concerning promises of a socialist Hungary and
continued cooperation with Eastern Europe.
A group of revolutionaries is shown cutting the
red star from the Hungarian flag. This is accurage
so far as it goes. But there is no accompanying
mention of the significance of this act for the
revolutionaries themselves. An American might
easily conclude that it symbolized disgust for
Communism. According to the revolutionaries
themselves, however, the intent of this act was not
so broad. It reflected, for them, revulsion toward
the Russian occupying troops and political
manipulation and deceit from Moscow.
Systematic Distortion
This is only a partial list of errors that come
immediately to mind. The effect of the systematic
distortions and emotional appeals is a common
American anti-communist picture of post war
Hungary. If Ardrey wished to present an honest
documentary to an American audience, he could
do so only by explicitly correcting cold war
misconceptions, not by implicitly reinforcing
them.
I, personally, am insulted by such a simplistic,
dishonest and manipulative appeal to my emotions
as this play. I do not support the activities of
Russia in squelching the Hungarian Revolution or
Czech liberalization in any way. I condemn them.
But I cannot tolerate being treated as an
intellectual infant. It is not necessary to be either
an expert on the Hungarian Revolution or a
political theorist with well-developed notions
(neither of which I am) to feel that this play is an
affront to one's intellectual and emotional
integrity. And I know enough about the cold war
and its effects on the American picture of
Communism to know when I am being bombarded
by more of the same trash.
