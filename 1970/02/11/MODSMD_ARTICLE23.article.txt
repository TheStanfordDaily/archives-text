## Will We Ever Meet Again? 
### John Arthur 
Despite the fact that the two Stanford-Yale swim meets have been
tremendous successes for both schools, the future of this new rivalry
is very much in doubt.
As Jim Gaughran says, the matchup is "a fantastically great
rivalry." No one present at Encina Pools last Saturday could deny
that. For weeks prior to the meeting of these swimming powers
anticipation on the part of competitiors and fans had been building.
Then, from the moment that Fred Haywood and Ed Bettendorf
launched themselves to start the 400 medley relay there existed a
degree of excitement seldom found during any athletic contest on this
campus. And even last year, when the Indians were wiped out in New
Haven, the Eli crowd was in an uproar from start to finish.
For the swimmers, the continuation of this series would mean not
only a semi-annual transcontinental trip, somewhat of an educational
experience in itself, but also the chance to face top-flight competition
before going against tough conference foes or participating
in the NCAA championships. For the fans, the meet has been a treat,
and will continue to be one.
Yet the men who are responsible for scheduling the teams, Athletic
Directors Delaney Kiphuth and Yale and Chuck Taylor of Stanford,
share similar apprehensions about making the meeting an annual
affair.
Both would like to see a renewal, but both, like teenagers wanting
to use the car for a date, are wary about what the lolks in charge will
say. Kiphuth told the Daily last Saturday that he likes this
natural rivalry," but he's not sure whether Yale s faculty Athletic
Board would approve. "It's essentially a policy proposition, he said,
"Can we encourage a big trip like this? Perhaps we 11 be able to do it
on an occasional home-and-home basis."

Taylor also has the problem of clearing future meets with his
Student-Faculty Athletic Committee, and wonders whether the meet
on a regular basis would be financially feasible. Last year only a large
donation enabled the Indians to travel to New Haven, and there's little
prospect of any future meets doing more than breaking even
financially at best. It costs about $6,000 to send a 15-man contingent
across the country. Saturday's meet made about $4000, according to
Taylor, and $3000 of that went to Yale to defray travel expenses. A
few hundred then went towards adminstrating the contest, with the
result that there wasn't a helluva lot left over. And all this with the
high priced tickets, which even Taylor admitted were a mistake.
"The whole thing is a little out of the ordinary," Taylor points
out, "It's not like sending a basketball team on a long trip. Basketball
games draw more, and we usually play more than once on a basketball
road trip to the east."
So, a rematch is still in doubt. Gaughran, of course, would like to
see one. "We don't like to end any rivalry without winning," he said,"
and we'd like to meet them under any conditions."
Even if they shave down and we can't use our frosh?
"Sure."

On another front, Taylor reports that Stanford has yet to schedule
an 11th football game for next season. A new NCAA rule permits 11
games, but Taylor is wary of stretching the already long season at
either end. Thus far, San Diego State and New Mexico have asked to
play Stanford, but the Athletic Department is still seeking clearance
for the contest from the Student-Faculty Athletic Committee and its
new Chairman, Prof. Robert Compton. Reports that the Indians will
schedule Mississippi or Florida are only speculation, Taylor says.

On another front, Taylor reports that Stanford has yet to schedule
an 11th football game for next season. A new NCAA rule permits 11
games, but Taylor is wary of stretching the already long season at
either end. Thus far, San Diego State and New Mexico have asked to
play Stanford, but the Athletic Department is still seeking clearance
for the contest from the Student-Faculty Athletic Committee and its
new Chairman, Prof. Robert Compton. Reports that the Indians will
schedule Mississippi or Florida are only speculation, Taylor says.

Despite the fact that the two Stanford-Yale swim meets have been
tremendous successes for both schools, the future of this new rivalry
is very much in doubt.
As Jim Gaughran says, the matchup is "a fantastically great
rivalry." No one present at Encina Pools last Saturday could deny
that. For weeks prior to the meeting of these swimming powers
anticipation on the part of competitiors and fans had been building.
Then, from the moment that Fred Haywood and Ed Bettendorf
launched themselves to start the 400 medley relay there existed a
degree of excitement seldom found during any athletic contest on this
campus. And even last year, when the Indians were wiped out in New
Haven, the Eli crowd was in an uproar from start to finish.
For the swimmers, the continuation of this series would mean not
only a semi-annual transcontinental trip, somewhat of an educational
experience in itself, but also the chance to face top-flight competition
before going against tough conference foes or participating
in the NCAA championships. For the fans, the meet has been a treat,
and will continue to be one.
Yet the men who are responsible for scheduling the teams, Athletic
Directors Delaney Kiphuth and Yale and Chuck Taylor of Stanford,
share similar apprehensions about making the meeting an annual
affair.
Both would like to see a renewal, but both, like teenagers wanting
to use the car for a date, are wary about what the lolks in charge will
say. Kiphuth told the Daily last Saturday that he likes this
natural rivalry," but he's not sure whether Yale s faculty Athletic
Board would approve. "It's essentially a policy proposition, he said,
"Can we encourage a big trip like this? Perhaps we 11 be able to do it
on an occasional home-and-home basis."

Taylor also has the problem of clearing future meets with his
Student-Faculty Athletic Committee, and wonders whether the meet
on a regular basis would be financially feasible. Last year only a large
donation enabled the Indians to travel to New Haven, and there's little
prospect of any future meets doing more than breaking even
financially at best. It costs about $6,000 to send a 15-man contingent
across the country. Saturday's meet made about $4000, according to
Taylor, and $3000 of that went to Yale to defray travel expenses. A
few hundred then went towards adminstrating the contest, with the
result that there wasn't a helluva lot left over. And all this with the
high priced tickets, which even Taylor admitted were a mistake.
"The whole thing is a little out of the ordinary," Taylor points
out, "It's not like sending a basketball team on a long trip. Basketball
games draw more, and we usually play more than once on a basketball
road trip to the east."
So, a rematch is still in doubt. Gaughran, of course, would like to
see one. "We don't like to end any rivalry without winning," he said,"
and we'd like to meet them under any conditions."
Even if they shave down and we can't use our frosh?
"Sure."
