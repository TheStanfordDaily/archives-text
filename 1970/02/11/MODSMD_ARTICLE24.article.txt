# Problems Solved
## Frosh Cagers Thrive 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
This year's freshman
basketball team has overcome a
number of problems over the last
couple of months and has rolled
up an impressive 9-2 record. Their
only losses have been close
heartbreakers against San Jose
State and Santa Clara. Most of
their victories have been routes
including an 88-77 win over St.
Mary's and a 96-73 rout of
Sacramento State last weekend.
At the start of the season, the
team faced not only the annual
problem of forming a team from
outstanding individual players
who had never played together
before, but also the problem of a
new coach. Before the start of the
season Paul Neumann retired and
the athletic department was
without a freshman basketball
coach. The job eventually went to
Clayton (Bub) Bowling a former
Stanford basketball player.
Bowling played here from
1 957-1961. Following his
graduation he coached at Los
Alton, Westmont and finally
Lynbrook High School. In his first
collegiate coaching job. Bowling
has done a fine job with the
freshman team, despite the fact
that he is also responsible for
much of Stanford's recruiting and
scouting.
Short Changed
Other problems faced by the
freshman team included the fact
that they had no starter over 6-4
and one of their best prospects,
Bob Buell, was slowed by a knee
injury.
Despite these problems,
Bowling came up with a starting
lineup which has proved very
effective. At the guards have been
John Stratton and Mike Boryla.
Stratton (6-2) was a much sought

after prospect at Western High
School in Kikomo, Indiana. He
has averaged 16.7 points while
directing the Indian attack. His
running mate since Buell's injury
moved Pat Rusco to forward, has
been Mike Boryla, an all-state
performer in both basketball and
football at Regis High School in
Denver. He has done a fine job
filling in for Buell and is averaging
7.7 points.
The Indian forwards have been
Pat Rusco and Mark Hanson.
Hanson (6-4) has played some fine
defense, while scoring at a 5.9
clip. Rusco (6-3) has been an
outstanding shooter hitting 51%
of his field goals and 84% of his
free throws while averaging 18.0
points.
Stevens Leads
The center for the Frosh is Pat
Stevens, the teams leading scorer
and rebounder. Stevens has been
handicapped by his 6-4 size
against bigger centers, but he has
done an excellent job, averaging
an amazing 18.7 points and 18.6
rebounds per game.

The reserves for the little
Indians have been led by Jeb
Johnson, Bruce Menser, Blake
Baldwin and Tim Taron. Johnson
has done a good job filling in for
Stevens and is averaging 4.8
points. Menser and Baldwin have
been the main reserves at the
guard spots. Playing behind
Stratton and Boryla, they have
not seen a lot of action, but they
are averaging 1.9 and 2.0 points in
limited duty roles. Taron has
helped out at the forward
positions and he is also averaging
1.9 points.
Varsity Prospects
Bowling is quite satisfied with
the job his team has been doing
and he is certain some of his
players will help next year's
varsity. Stratton, Rusco and
Stevens should all see a lot of
action on next year's varsity and
Bowling feels that Buell (6-4),
who was averaging 8.4 points
before he reinjured his knee, also
has a good chance to make the
varsity squad.

outstanding shooter hitting 51%
of his field goals and 84% of his
free throws while averaging 18.0
points.
Stevens Leads
The center for the Frosh is Pat
Stevens, the teams leading scorer
and rebounder. Stevens has been
handicapped by his 6-4 size
against bigger centers, but he has
done an excellent job, averaging
an amazing 18.7 points and 18.6
rebounds per game.

The reserves for the little
Indians have been led by Jeb
Johnson, Bruce Menser, Blake
Baldwin and Tim Taron. Johnson
has done a good job filling in for
Stevens and is averaging 4.8
points. Menser and Baldwin have
been the main reserves at the
guard spots. Playing behind
Stratton and Boryla, they have
not seen a lot of action, but they
are averaging 1.9 and 2.0 points in
limited duty roles. Taron has
helped out at the forward
positions and he is also averaging
1.9 points.
Varsity Prospects
Bowling is quite satisfied with
the job his team has been doing
and he is certain some of his
players will help next year's
varsity. Stratton, Rusco and
Stevens should all see a lot of
action on next year's varsity and
Bowling feels that Buell (6-4),
who was averaging 8.4 points
before he reinjured his knee, also
has a good chance to make the
varsity squad.
This year's freshman
basketball team has overcome a
number of problems over the last
couple of months and has rolled
up an impressive 9-2 record. Their
only losses have been close
heartbreakers against San Jose
State and Santa Clara. Most of
their victories have been routes
including an 88-77 win over St.
Mary's and a 96-73 rout of
Sacramento State last weekend.
At the start of the season, the
team faced not only the annual
problem of forming a team from
outstanding individual players
who had never played together
before, but also the problem of a
new coach. Before the start of the
season Paul Neumann retired and
the athletic department was
without a freshman basketball
coach. The job eventually went to
Clayton (Bub) Bowling a former
Stanford basketball player.
Bowling played here from
1 957-1961. Following his
graduation he coached at Los
Alton, Westmont and finally
Lynbrook High School. In his first
collegiate coaching job. Bowling
has done a fine job with the
freshman team, despite the fact
that he is also responsible for
much of Stanford's recruiting and
scouting.
Short Changed
Other problems faced by the
freshman team included the fact
that they had no starter over 6-4
and one of their best prospects,
Bob Buell, was slowed by a knee
injury.
Despite these problems,
Bowling came up with a starting
lineup which has proved very
effective. At the guards have been
John Stratton and Mike Boryla.
Stratton (6-2) was a much sought

after prospect at Western High
School in Kikomo, Indiana. He
has averaged 16.7 points while
directing the Indian attack. His
running mate since Buell's injury
moved Pat Rusco to forward, has
been Mike Boryla, an all-state
performer in both basketball and
football at Regis High School in
Denver. He has done a fine job
filling in for Buell and is averaging
7.7 points.
The Indian forwards have been
Pat Rusco and Mark Hanson.
Hanson (6-4) has played some fine
defense, while scoring at a 5.9
clip. Rusco (6-3) has been an
outstanding shooter hitting 51%
of his field goals and 84% of his
free throws while averaging 18.0
points.
