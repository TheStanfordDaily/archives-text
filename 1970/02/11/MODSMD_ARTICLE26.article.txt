# Home Runs Blast Indians To Victory
## 
### 
The way things are going, the
varsity baseball team should be a
real threat come April.
The Indians opened the season
last week with a 3-2 win over the
Philly Rookies, then beat USF on
Friday by a 2-1 margin. Both
times the winning run was
scored in the ninth inning.
But on Saturday the Tribe
began to hit the ball, beating the
Alumni 8-3. And yesterday, the
offense really exploded.
Steve Dunning and Mike
Nelson crashed home runs, Hank
Snider tripled and Mike Ewing
singled - for his first hit of the
year - as Stanford crushed Cal
State Hay ware 11-0. The Tribe
got an unearned run in the
second, then two on Ewing's and
Snider's blasts in the third.
Dunning's shot hit the bank in left
for three runs in the sixth, and
first baseman Nelson drove in
three with his eighth inning HR to
right.

Starter Phil Keller was forced
to leave the game after throwing
one pitch in the second ,due to
recurrent back pains which have
bothered him on and off this
spring. Jim Coate came in and
pitched until the seventh when
freshman Rod Boone (Bob's
brother) took over. Dunning
finished up. The win went to
southpaw Coate.
