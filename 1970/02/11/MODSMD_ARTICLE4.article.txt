# Pub Board Decides Not To Stop 'Arena'
## 
### JOHN ECKHOUSE 
The Arena responded to a stiff
challenge from the Student Senate
and Publications Board yesterday
and emerged victorious on the
basis of a surprising technical
knock-out.
Summoned before the Board
on angry requests from the
Student Financial Manager David
Swift and the Senate, the Arena
staff through Harvey Hukari
argued that the paper should not
have to get permission from the
Publications Board on campus.
In a near unanimous vote (9-0,
with Swift abstaining) the Board
decided to eliminate the sections
of its Standing Rules that
empowered it to act against
infractions such as those
supposedly committed by the
Arena.
The issue developed last week
after the Arena published an
article alleging improper
management of funds by the
ASSU in general and the Student
Financial Manager in particular.
The Publications Board was then
asked to investigate whether the
Arena had for two years been
violating ASSU regulations by
failing to register with the Board.
Speaking for the newspaper,
Harvey Hukari challenged the
legitimacy of the Board and its
power to compel publications to
register with it. Calling the laws
under which the Board operates

"anachronistic," Hukari added,
''We don't want your
authorization to distribute on
campus, for we don't need it."
"Our position is that, very
simply, we have been distributing
on campus for two years and we
have been recognized by the
Stanford community as a
legitimate publication."
Appearing very calm in what
was expected to be a tense
situation, Hukari even suggested
that the Publications Board
"should perhaps dissolve itself."
Quoting from Jefferson about the
necessity of newspapers in a
democracy, he closed his short
presentation by stating, "What we
need at Stanford is more
newspapers and one less
government."
Sweeney Agrees
Chairman Tom Dawson,
responding to the directions of
the Senate, had attempted to have
his group consider whether the
Arena's distribution did in fact
violate sections of the By-Laws.
Chaparral editor Michael Sweeney
objected to this procedure, saying,
"I think we tread on dangerous
grounds by even considering this
action." He then moved that the
Board refuse to restrict the
circulation of any publication on
campus.
Sweeney felt that the group
had no authority to regulate
publications with policy power

and in his motion attempted to
disregard portions of the
Publications Board Standing Rules
that conferred such power.
Sweeney's defense of Hukari's
stand shocked many observers, for
the two have been long-time
rivals.
The Board decided to
eliminate the sections Sweeney
had questioned and to
recommend to the By-Laws
Committee that similar sections of
the By-Laws be repealed.
In a related action, the Board
amended its Operating Rules and
Procedures for the ASSU
typesetting shop. Operated
previously as a non-profit
organization for the exclusive use
of official ASSU publications and
other ASSU organizations, the
shop will now be open, when
possible, to individual members of
the Associated Students. The new
provision will make it available to
groups like the Arena, Pacific
Studies Center (through its
members who are students), and
individuals who wish to print
their doctoral dissertations.
Arena A Martyr
Frank Philpot, also a member
of the Student Senate, seemed to
clarify the reasoning behind the
Board's action when he expressed
his fears that the Arena would
become a martry if the
Publications Board tried to
enforce their By-Laws.
After the vote, Hukari
commented that "politically, they
made a very smart move. We are
very pleased, but we never
considered ourselves to be under
their regulations." He mentioned
that if the Board had not
responded the way they did, the
Arena was prepared to pursue the
matter to the fullest extent
possible.
Hukari also warned that
another controversy between his
paper and the ASSU is brewing.
"If David Swift or Pat Shea are
upset about last week's issue, then
you had better see Thursday's
Arena."
