# 99 In ROTC
## Junior College Students Fill Stanford Quota 
### WALLY THURSTON 
Judging by the numbers, there
are not enough Stanford students
in the Army ROTC program to fill
the quota specified in the contract
between Stanford and the United
States Army.
Although Provost Howard
Brooks says that the quota is only
a "target" for enrollment,
contract specifies that Stanford is
obligated to maintain at least 100
students in the department.
Enrollment of additional
students from local junior colleges
has so far allowed the program to
continue.
According to Brooks, Stanford

receives no monetary
reimbursement for letting other
colleges use its facilities: "There
are no monetary arrangements;
these boys can just come over to
drill and enroll in Military Science
I and II."
On the other hand, Colonel
Stanley Ramey, head of the Army
ROTC department, states that
Stanford received approximately
$2,000 this yoar from the
institutions where the students are
enrolled to accomodate 46
students. The outside colleges
each pay a stipulated sum per
student.
Other University officials were
not available for comment on the
monetary arrangements.
99 Stanford Students
Currently there are only 99
Stanford students in the Army
ROTC program. There has been a
steady fall in enrollment for the
past three years. Last year about
160 students were enrolled in the
program. This fall, however, only
six Stanford freshmen joined.
Colonel Ramey told a Daily
reporter yesterday that one of the
reasons enrollment has fallen is
the "conflict about ROTC due to
the war sentiment on campus."
In a previous interview, Ramey
had said that many students have

not entered the program because
of the new draft lottery system.
"Some young men just wait and
see what their number is before
deciding anything. Of course at
this point you can't really tell just
what those numbers mean.'
Commenting on the decrease
of enrollment, Brooks said that
"Some students are just interested
in other things, besides ROTC."
Outside Students
The outside students presently
enrolled in the basic two-year
program come from Foothill
college, the College of San Mateo,
Menlo College and School of
Business, DeAnza College,
Cupertino, Ohlone and Canada
College.
"Junior College students come
here with the understanding that
they are in no way Stanford
students," commented Ramey.
"They are graded through my
instructors and the institutions
they belong to."
"Stanford in reality is an open
campus," he continued.
"Activities go on with a lot of
people involved with the
University in no other way."
Lieutenant Colonel Leon
Heinle, head of the Air Force
ROTC department, said that

many colleges had objected to this
kind of arrangement, where "the
university pays and outside
students use the facilities."
However, according to Ramey,
the colleges reimburse Stanford
for the use of campus
accomodations and personnel.
"This is not a contract," he
added, "just an agreement."

students," commented Ramey.
"They are graded through my
instructors and the institutions
they belong to."
"Stanford in reality is an open
campus," he continued.
"Activities go on with a lot of
people involved with the
University in no other way."
Lieutenant Colonel Leon
Heinle, head of the Air Force
ROTC department, said that

many colleges had objected to this
kind of arrangement, where "the
university pays and outside
students use the facilities."
However, according to Ramey,
the colleges reimburse Stanford
for the use of campus
accomodations and personnel.
"This is not a contract," he
added, "just an agreement."
Judging by the numbers, there
are not enough Stanford students
in the Army ROTC program to fill
the quota specified in the contract
between Stanford and the United
States Army.
Although Provost Howard
Brooks says that the quota is only
a "target" for enrollment,
contract specifies that Stanford is
obligated to maintain at least 100
students in the department.
Enrollment of additional
students from local junior colleges
has so far allowed the program to
continue.
According to Brooks, Stanford

receives no monetary
reimbursement for letting other
colleges use its facilities: "There
are no monetary arrangements;
these boys can just come over to
drill and enroll in Military Science
I and II."
On the other hand, Colonel
Stanley Ramey, head of the Army
ROTC department, states that
Stanford received approximately
$2,000 this yoar from the
institutions where the students are
enrolled to accomodate 46
students. The outside colleges
each pay a stipulated sum per
student.
Other University officials were
not available for comment on the
monetary arrangements.
99 Stanford Students
Currently there are only 99
Stanford students in the Army
ROTC program. There has been a
steady fall in enrollment for the
past three years. Last year about
160 students were enrolled in the
program. This fall, however, only
six Stanford freshmen joined.
Colonel Ramey told a Daily
reporter yesterday that one of the
reasons enrollment has fallen is
the "conflict about ROTC due to
the war sentiment on campus."
In a previous interview, Ramey
had said that many students have

not entered the program because
of the new draft lottery system.
"Some young men just wait and
see what their number is before
deciding anything. Of course at
this point you can't really tell just
what those numbers mean.'
Commenting on the decrease
of enrollment, Brooks said that
"Some students are just interested
in other things, besides ROTC."
Outside Students
The outside students presently
enrolled in the basic two-year
program come from Foothill
college, the College of San Mateo,
Menlo College and School of
Business, DeAnza College,
Cupertino, Ohlone and Canada
College.
"Junior College students come
here with the understanding that
they are in no way Stanford
students," commented Ramey.
"They are graded through my
instructors and the institutions
they belong to."
"Stanford in reality is an open
campus," he continued.
"Activities go on with a lot of
people involved with the
University in no other way."
