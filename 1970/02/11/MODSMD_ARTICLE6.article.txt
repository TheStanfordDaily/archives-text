# Pitzer Keeps SJC Emergency Rules
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Emergency procedures
recommended last Spring by the
Student Judicial Council for use
in ending campus disruptions
remain in effect, President Pitzer
affirmed yesterday.
In a public letter to Prof.
Thomas Ehrlich of the Law School
Pitzer wrote that since he was
convinced such procedures helped
to end the Encina sit-in and
prevented further campus
disruption last spring, it was his
intention "to use them or some
reasonable modification again, if to
do so would be appropriate and
useful."

The letter was in response to a
letter from Ehrlich, a member of
the President's Advisory
Committee on Campus
Disruptions, who requested that
Pitzer make clear to the
community his position on this
matter.
The procedures recommended
by the SJC last April during the
AEL deal with (Applied
Electronics Laboratory) sit-in
with violations of the Campus
Disruption Policy by occupation
of campus buildings.
At that time the SJC
recommended that any building
may be closed to all persons
except those having express
presidential authority to enter.
Secondly, it suggested that after
certain procedural steps were
taken, the president could use his
emergency powers to subject
student, faculty, or staff members
to immediate, temporary
suspension for participating in a
disruptive occupation of a
building.
Pitzer claims that the reason
for keeping the procedures in
effect is that they were adopted
last spring because "existing
rules and procedures were
inadequate to deal with the
situation," and that therefore
they will remain in effect until the
"appropriate University bodies
have had an opportunity to devise
adequate mechanisms for dealing
with such situations."
