# Breakfast Meeting
## Murphy, YR's Probe Issues 
### BUZZ THOMPSON 
Senator George Murphy met
with 12 members of the Stanford
Young Republicans yesterday
over breakfast in what might
prove to be a new series of
discussion sessions with college
youth.
The Senator stressed that he
found such sessions, where he
could listen to the students'
thoughts, much more desirable
than campus speeches, where
one-way conversation is the
general rule.
While going over a wide range
of issues, Senator Murphy
expressed confidence that when
confronted with his Senate record
the voting public will return him
to his post by a larger margin than
before.
Murphy felt that there were
large inconsistencies in the voting
record of his major opponent,
Congressman John Tunney.
Murphy pointed out that Tunney
was completely willing to march
with the Californian grape
strikers, but could never bring
himself to yell "Huelga."
Senator Murphy also revealed
that his campaign will be closely
allied with the gubernatorial
campaign of Governor Reagan.
Murphy reminded his audience
that it was he who had convinced
the Governor to switch from the
Democratic to the Republican
party (as Murphv himself did in
1939.
Adequate Armament
Much of the discussion
centered around the need for
adequate armament, especially in
regard to the ABM. The Senator
felt that the alleged recent step up

in Russian rrissile development
plus the rapid rise of the military
leadership in the Kremlin over the
past year calls for the
reassessment of our current
position. Senator Murphy also
noted that Russian missile strength
has been grossly underestimated
in the past.
Murphy's main criticism was
of ABM opponents' labeling of
the missile system as "offensive."
Murphy contends instead that the
system is defensive, protecting the
world against an arms imbalance.
The main threat to the world
today comes from the
Communists not America,
Murphy stated.
On the question of Vietnam
Senator Murphy expressed the
view that the South Vietnamese
would soon be able to take over
the war. When equipped with the
same weapons the Senator
believes that the South
Vietnamese will be able to fight as
well, if not better, than the Viet
Cong. The Senator declined to
state a' specific time schedule for
troop withdrawal, however.
Murphy Amendment
Senator Murphy also went to
great lengths in discussing the
so-called "Murphy Amendment"
which allows California to set
more stringent smog standards
than any other state. California is
the only state now permitted to
set and enforce its own strong
motor vehicle emission controls.
When asked his opinion on
drugs, the Senator stated that he
did not believe that marijuannwas
harmless. Murphy expressed the
view that the sentence for first
offenders should be lessened, but

that the sentence for pushers
definitely should not be lowered.
Murphy also dealt with a series
of other issues, including his trip
last year to Alaska with Sen.
Edward Kennedy. Senator
Murphy stated that the trip
reminded him of a movie
company shooting a film; they
were briefing men in every town
they visited before they arrived.

Finally, when asked what he
thought should be emphasized
about his record in the coming
election, Senator Murphy stated
that it should be the positive
nature of it. He expressed the
feeling that it was time to end the
negative attitude of today.
America, he felt, was not perfect,
but at least the best political
system that has yet been devised.
