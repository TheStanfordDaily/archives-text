# Reply To Groth
## Sensationalism = Solutions 
### Jim Boughn Cordon Krist 
Our chagrin at Ned Groth's
righteous indignation toward
those who misuse the title of Most
Holy Ecologist and his attack on
Eliassen (and all environmental
engineers) has prompted the
following comments:
True ecology is that branch of
biology that deals with the
relations between living organisms
and their environment. However,
the interactions of man with his
environment are extremely
complex and an understanding
(far from being achieved) requires
the expertise of the chemist,
physicist, meteorologist,
radiologist, and many, many
others.
Further, the control of these
interactions requires the political
scientist, sociologist, chemical
engineer, thermocynamicist,
electrical engineer, civil engineer,
to name but a few. An incredible
arrogance is necessary to conclude
that only the biologist is sincerely
interested in the environment and
alone is able to contribute to an
understanding of man's
interaction with it.
Groth attacks Eliassen (the

environmental engineer) for his
"task of manipulating the
environment to serve human
needs." We assume Groth does
not object to serving human needs
so he must categorically object to
"manipulating the environment."
Surely a biologist appreciates the
fact that man to survive must, and
always has, "manipulated" his
environment. The environmental
engineer attempts (hopefully with
the support of society) to reap the
maximum benefit from our
environment while minimizing
adverse effects.
Groth further claims that the
"environmental engineer's task. . .
is a total anti-thesis of studying
the requirements and restrictions
of the ecologically feasible." This
is nonsense! The environmental
engineer can no more ignore the
requirements and restrictions of
the ecologically feasible than the
aeronautical engineer can ignore
the presence of air.
Cursing The Hammer
He next attacks the
"technocrat" and states "that
technological solutions to other
problems have caused the

environmental crisis we now
face." Pardon the analogy, but
isn't this similar to the man who
having hit his hand with a
hammer,- curses the hammer?
Technology is a tool in the hands
of society (notwithstanding
Groth's attempts to blame
Government and Industry). It's
misuse (and its creative use) is
obvious as we observe
concurrently the presence of air
pollution and the absence of
malaria and typhoid.
We wonder what "solutions"
Groth proposes which do not
require technology-the only such
solution immediately apparent to
us involves the cooperation
(usually forthcoming) of Four
Horsemen. Ehrlich has described
the extreme importance of
population control, without
which man is doomed (perhaps he
is anyhow). This is a necessary,
but not sufficient condition for
survival. Population control
without technological solutions to
man's nondestructive use of his
environment is futile.
Two specific "solutions"
advocated by Gliassen are

dismissed by Groth with a
superficial discussion.
Potential Pollution
First, the combustion of solid
wastes to generate electrical
energy is rejected because of
potential air pollution. We share
Groth's concern with air pollution
since we are both pilots and are
regularly treated to the spectacle
of a beautiful Bay transformed
into an aerial cesspool. However,
solid wastes (garbage) exist and
will continue to exist; and
electrical power is generated in
large part by combustion
processes which cause air
pollution.
Eliassen is advocating a system
which will remove solid wastes (a
"big" problem) and will reduce air
pollution below that which occurs
with present fuels. This solution is
not as attractive ecologically as
the removal of man, but since we
will not volunteer to leave we are
interested.
The second target is the
nuclear power plant. Groth claims
that Eliassen "ignores the
problems of nuclear wastes and
radioactive pollutants. . .warm
water." It is simply Not True that
Eliassen, the AEC, environmental
engineers, or any other persons
directly involved in the use of
nuclear power "ignores" these
problems. These are real problems
and technologists, many of whom
are sincerely concerned with the
environment that they and their
children must live in, cannot and
do not ignore them. Thermal
pollution is important to the
environmental engineer, not only
for the nuclear power plant, but
for the commonly used fossil fuel
plant as well.
Senator Muskie led
subcommittee hearings on this
subject last year and a recent issue
of Nuclear News addresses this
problem Eliassen has specifically
advocated citing of nuclear power
plants on Northern Coasts where
the thermal wastes may be
disposed of in deep ocean water,
ecological feasibility being a prime
consideration.
Honest Debale Needed
Environmental problems
should be approached through
honest debate about proposed
solutions, not be simplistic
solutions. We abhor the
sensational and superficial
approach (with personal attacks)
which only dissipates effort better
used in creative action.
Groth's specious approach to
environmental problems appears
to ignore human needs. First, he
attacks combustion sources of
energy, then he attacks the
nuclear power plant. This leaves
only the hydroelectric energy
source; perhaps Groth would have
us dam the Grand Canyon. Even if
we approved (we don't) there are
not sufficient hydroelectric
sources to satisfy the energy needs
of man (even with a fraction of
the present world population) if
others are to share the standard of
living that we at Stanford take for
granted.
We do not want to discourage
Groth in his efforts to bring about
a "restoration of ecological
balance". However, we would
hope that his zeal (which we
applaud) will not blind him to the
fact that no "solution" to our
environmental problems can be
successful without including the
needs of man in the equations.
