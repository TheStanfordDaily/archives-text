# Women's Lib: Yes Or No?
## 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
We feel obligated to comment
on Sunday's symposium on
"Women in the 70's" in order to
correct a few misconceptions.
Miss Feeley's analysis was
sympathetic to the viewpoint of
Women's Liberation, but her
remarks were continually
interrupted by nervous laughter.

Her sociological, political, and
economic arguments were,
whenever possible, interpreted by
an immature audience as sexual
allusions.
Dr. Zimbardo began by
entertaining the audience with the
traditional exploitative view of
women. His later rejection of such
an untenable position was
unfortunately overshadowed by
his earlier sensationalistic tactics.
Prof. Katchadourian's speech,
although low-keyed, was
extremely objectionable. Like the
wise man of his story, he assumed
that no conflict existed between
the traditional view of women and
that of Women's Liberation.
Speaking to the men in the
audience, Katchadourian assured
them that Women's Liberation
was in their own self-interest.
With a warning that tyranny
by sisters might be as bad as
tyranny by brothers, he
encouraged women to retain their
traditional "femininity" against
the pressure of a militant
minority. It is clear that
Katchadourian articulated the
position of those men and women
who feel threatened by the new
feminist movement.
We, as members of the militant
minority, do not condemn the
housewife as such, but rather the
society which forces her into that
role and labels all others as
inappropriate. It is important to
understand that we ary not
recommending the
masculinization of women, but
demanding a new concept of
femininity.

In response to a leaflet
distributed on campus and
dormitory walls on Monday,
February 2, I offer some long

overdue comments to the
Women's Liberation Front.
With respect to demands
stated under Admissions Policy in
the leaflet: if there is not now
intensive recruitment of women
graduate students, neither is there
recruitment of men graduates
whose draft status is uncertain.
Women graduates who drop out
half way through their programs
to have children are a poor
investment for their departments.
Your suggestions concerning
employees' rights to leave work
and attend free University classes
are naive. The University does not
exist as a free institution for
anyone to take advantage of, nor
does it have the resources to
support such things as job training
centers where "women can learn
skills to enable them to get a
decent job."
Demands listed under Health
are perhaps the most laughable in
the program. If, as you say,
"women must have the right to
control their own bodies," then
they should also have the sense
not to have children if they can't
afford them or if their careers
preclude them. Child care centers
are very nice, but it is not the
responsibility of the University to
compensate for parents' decisions
turned sour. It is true that
contraceptive advice should be
available to every women. At the
present time, health care including
birth control information and
counseling is free for all students.
My earlier argument still holds
with respect to your demands for
free maternity care for all
employees and students.
Furthermore, this is not a society
that benefits from, or even needs,
babies.
The demands of the Women's
Liberation Front reflect a wish for
preferential treatment, or reverse
discrimination, which women
desiring equality would eschew.
Equality denotes responsibility
for one's actions, but you are
asking Stanford to be responsible
for your own decisions to have
children.

are perhaps the most laughable in
the program. If, as you say,
"women must have the right to
control their own bodies," then
they should also have the sense
not to have children if they can't
afford them or if their careers
preclude them. Child care centers
are very nice, but it is not the
responsibility of the University to
compensate for parents' decisions
turned sour. It is true that
contraceptive advice should be
available to every women. At the
present time, health care including
birth control information and
counseling is free for all students.
My earlier argument still holds
with respect to your demands for
free maternity care for all
employees and students.
Furthermore, this is not a society
that benefits from, or even needs,
babies.
The demands of the Women's
Liberation Front reflect a wish for
preferential treatment, or reverse
discrimination, which women
desiring equality would eschew.
Equality denotes responsibility
for one's actions, but you are
asking Stanford to be responsible
for your own decisions to have
children.

We feel obligated to comment
on Sunday's symposium on
"Women in the 70's" in order to
correct a few misconceptions.
Miss Feeley's analysis was
sympathetic to the viewpoint of
Women's Liberation, but her
remarks were continually
interrupted by nervous laughter.

Her sociological, political, and
economic arguments were,
whenever possible, interpreted by
an immature audience as sexual
allusions.
Dr. Zimbardo began by
entertaining the audience with the
traditional exploitative view of
women. His later rejection of such
an untenable position was
unfortunately overshadowed by
his earlier sensationalistic tactics.
Prof. Katchadourian's speech,
although low-keyed, was
extremely objectionable. Like the
wise man of his story, he assumed
that no conflict existed between
the traditional view of women and
that of Women's Liberation.
Speaking to the men in the
audience, Katchadourian assured
them that Women's Liberation
was in their own self-interest.
With a warning that tyranny
by sisters might be as bad as
tyranny by brothers, he
encouraged women to retain their
traditional "femininity" against
the pressure of a militant
minority. It is clear that
Katchadourian articulated the
position of those men and women
who feel threatened by the new
feminist movement.
We, as members of the militant
minority, do not condemn the
housewife as such, but rather the
society which forces her into that
role and labels all others as
inappropriate. It is important to
understand that we ary not
recommending the
masculinization of women, but
demanding a new concept of
femininity.

In response to a leaflet
distributed on campus and
dormitory walls on Monday,
February 2, I offer some long

overdue comments to the
Women's Liberation Front.
With respect to demands
stated under Admissions Policy in
the leaflet: if there is not now
intensive recruitment of women
graduate students, neither is there
recruitment of men graduates
whose draft status is uncertain.
Women graduates who drop out
half way through their programs
to have children are a poor
investment for their departments.
Your suggestions concerning
employees' rights to leave work
and attend free University classes
are naive. The University does not
exist as a free institution for
anyone to take advantage of, nor
does it have the resources to
support such things as job training
centers where "women can learn
skills to enable them to get a
decent job."
Demands listed under Health
are perhaps the most laughable in
the program. If, as you say,
"women must have the right to
control their own bodies," then
they should also have the sense
not to have children if they can't
afford them or if their careers
