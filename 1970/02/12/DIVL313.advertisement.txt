Forty years ago on February 12, 1930 the U.S.
Senate was engaged in feverish debate over whether to
eonJirm Charles Evans Hughes as Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court. Eventually he was confirmed. If the
Senate could waver over as upright a man as Hughes, we
wonder what its reaction to CarswcU should be.
Opinions are being taken in the editorial offices at
x4632, and judgments being pronounced in the business
of fice at 327-4150.
