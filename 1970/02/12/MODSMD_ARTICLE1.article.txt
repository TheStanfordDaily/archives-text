# Ex-Marines Want Changes In Military
## 
### JOHN SLOAN 
Two Vietnam Veterans
described their grievances against
the military and attempts to
change it to about 65 listeners at a
noon rally yesterday in White
Plaza.
Ex-marines Ernest Scott and
Wayne Morgan talked for 45
minutes about their experiences in
the military, ROTC and the
Movement for a Democratic
Military, which has demanded
collective bargaining and greater
civil liberties in the armed
services. They are spokesmen for
the "Green Machine" resistance
project organized near Camp
Pendleton.
Scott, a black, charged that
the military is an organization
"with all the basic laws of
fascism."
"We are involved in a class and
race struggle. . .and I'm trying to
turn it into a Revolution because
that's the only way the world is
going to change," he said.
"It's only the poor and
oppressed people who are going in
(the military) and it's time that
we were doing something about it.
The conditions in the military are
inhuman!" he asserted.
The Movement for a
Democratic Military, Morgan later
explained, has voiced several
demands for soldiers including
collective bargaining, end to
censorship, abolishing courts
martial, end to racism, abolishing
the draft and an immediate
pullout of Vietnam.
"So far we've only got printed
demands. We don't have the
support we should have," Scott
said. Pointing to the Stanford

turnout, he continued, "There
should be 10 or 20 times more
students here, but it's not their
problem.
Morgan, who has continued
organizing during two years out of
the military, focused attention on
Vietnam. "Vietnam is a
capitalistic war," he said.
"We've got a lot of problems,
the population explosion and
others like pollution," he
asserted,"and these problems have
to be faced immediately. And
Vietnam is a focus for all this," he
asserted.
Morgan also had harsh words
for ROTC. "ROTC exploits
people," he said, "just like any
other fascist organization. You
become a machine and you stop
thinking. You go out and play
John Wayne and wind up dead.
They don't teach you about
bullets in the book."
Scott's suggestion for Stanford
was, "kick ROTC off campus and
keep it off."
