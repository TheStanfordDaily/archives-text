# KZSU Editorial
## News Coverage 
### 
Stanford's news media is faced
with a dilemna in covering
organized campus movements: on
the one hand they are bound by
the concept of complete and
thorough reporting of the news.
On the other, the photographic
and taped material they compile
has been subject to subpoena by
the courts when these movements
run afoul of the law.
As of late, a number of
organizations have restricted the
attendance of Daily and KZSU
reporters at their meetings,
apprehensive that their words and
decisions, as reported by the
media, will be used against them.
Today, the Stanford Daily's
editorial staff has issued a
statement of forthcoming policy -
that their reporters and
photographers will be assigned to
all newsworthy events until
explicitly excluded. Further, the
Daily intends to publish all
photographs and statements
regardless of their incriminating
potential. Should any reporter be
harmed or his equipment
damaged, the Daily will seek
recourse through campus and
community legal authorities.

We at KZSU firmly support
the Daily's stand and advance a
number of convictions of our
own:
1. KZSU intends to cover all
newsworthy events and without
restriction.
2. We affirm that our purpose
is to provide complete and
unbiased coverage for our
listening audience. We will act
neither as an evidence-gathering
bureau for the police nor as a
mouthpiece or shield for any
group or individual.
We would advise all who
would interfere with the press
coverage to consider the loss of
our journalistic integrity a
sacrifice we will not tolerate.
Freedom of the press, in our
opinion, is a two-way street.
Just as the Daily intends to
report "all the news" that's fit to
print", KZSU will broadcast all
the news that's fit to be heard.
Only when our reporters attain
complete and unrestricted access
to the news will we be satisfied
that our job has been fulfilled.
(The above is a KZSU editorial
broadcast on Tuesday.)
