# Political Conflict in Vietnam Discussed By Minister Than
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
The political aspects of the
Vietnam war are more important
than the military conflict itself, a
South Vietnamese government
official told reporters here
hesterday.
Mai Trong Than, Director of
Internal Information and Chief of
the External Information Center
of the Vietnamese Ministry of
Information is visiting the U.S. at
the invitation of the State
Department. He spoke from a
prepared text and there were no
questions permitted.
The 33 year old administrator
emphasized that his government
considered the political aspects of
the Vietnam War even more
important than the military
conflict. He referred to these
aspects as the "Political War" and
included under thus heading, "the
war of idealogies, of strategy, of
intelligence, of organization, of
psychology and of people."
Than stated his duties involve
using the information media to
help achieve the eight objectives
of the National Pacification and
Development Plan. These
objectives are territorial security,
Peoples' Self-Defense Forces,
improved local administration,
ameliorating the plight of
refugees, the "Open Arms"
Program, the Information
Program, economic development
and social support.
Pacified Hamlets
Labeling territorial security
the most important problem
facing his government and aspect
of the war which most directly
effects the Vietnamese people,
Than cited figures to demonstrate
that progress had been made on

this front. He stated that the
Republic of Vietnam achieved a
goal in 1969 of controlling 90% of
the population in the South. Of
13,820 hamlets in South Vietnam,
he said 1 0,755 are now considered
pacified.
He explained that People's
Self-Defense Forces are more than
local militia. Consulting with his
State Department
cscort-interpreter, who said these
forces are apparently what we
would call a home guard, Than
then went on to say these groups
include teenagers, women, and
men too old to serve in the
Regular Army as well as the
regional military forces. He said
the program was an old one that
gained impetus after the 1968 Tet
Offensive when his government
found the people clearly opposed

to the Communists. He cited the
ability of the Republic of
Vietnam to absorb regional
military forces into the regular
army as a mark of the success of
this program.
Improving local administration
involves increasing the number of
administrators responsible for
each village and granting to
villages which are pacified to the
extent that elections may be held
1 million piastres ($9,000) which
the village may use as it wants.
Open Arms
In 1964-1965 over one million
Vietnamese fled their villages into
the safer cities. According to
Than, the political and military
situation has improved to the
point that efforts are now being
made to return the refugees to
their villages.

to the Communists. He cited the
ability of the Republic of
Vietnam to absorb regional
military forces into the regular
army as a mark of the success of
this program.
Improving local administration
involves increasing the number of
administrators responsible for
each village and granting to
villages which are pacified to the
extent that elections may be held
1 million piastres ($9,000) which
the village may use as it wants.
Open Arms
In 1964-1965 over one million
Vietnamese fled their villages into
the safer cities. According to
Than, the political and military
situation has improved to the
point that efforts are now being
made to return the refugees to
their villages.

The political aspects of the
Vietnam war are more important
than the military conflict itself, a
South Vietnamese government
official told reporters here
hesterday.
Mai Trong Than, Director of
Internal Information and Chief of
the External Information Center
of the Vietnamese Ministry of
Information is visiting the U.S. at
the invitation of the State
Department. He spoke from a
prepared text and there were no
questions permitted.
The 33 year old administrator
emphasized that his government
considered the political aspects of
the Vietnam War even more
important than the military
conflict. He referred to these
aspects as the "Political War" and
included under thus heading, "the
war of idealogies, of strategy, of
intelligence, of organization, of
psychology and of people."
Than stated his duties involve
using the information media to
help achieve the eight objectives
of the National Pacification and
Development Plan. These
objectives are territorial security,
Peoples' Self-Defense Forces,
improved local administration,
ameliorating the plight of
refugees, the "Open Arms"
Program, the Information
Program, economic development
and social support.
Pacified Hamlets
Labeling territorial security
the most important problem
facing his government and aspect
of the war which most directly
effects the Vietnamese people,
Than cited figures to demonstrate
that progress had been made on

this front. He stated that the
Republic of Vietnam achieved a
goal in 1969 of controlling 90% of
the population in the South. Of
13,820 hamlets in South Vietnam,
he said 1 0,755 are now considered
pacified.
He explained that People's
Self-Defense Forces are more than
local militia. Consulting with his
State Department
cscort-interpreter, who said these
forces are apparently what we
would call a home guard, Than
then went on to say these groups
include teenagers, women, and
men too old to serve in the
Regular Army as well as the
regional military forces. He said
the program was an old one that
gained impetus after the 1968 Tet
Offensive when his government
found the people clearly opposed

to the Communists. He cited the
ability of the Republic of
Vietnam to absorb regional
military forces into the regular
army as a mark of the success of
this program.
