# Scholars Study Asia
## 
### ANNE EGGEBROTEN 
Momentum is building for a
"major breakthrough" on China
and Japan.
Overshadowed by
developments in nuclear physics
and the current furor over
pollution, research on twentieth
century East Asia is progressing
rapidly and excitingly among a
strong community of Stanford
scholars.
Created only one year ago, the
Center for East Asian Studies is
unique in its concentration of
faculty and collected documents.
No other university offers
comparable opportunity for
interdisciplinary and interarea
research and training, according to
John W. Lewis, chairman of the
Committee on East Asian Studies.
"However, several of the
research projects on China and
Japan go beyond Stanford,"
emphasizes Lewis. "We are
helping to support other
universities and to end
competition. By beginning to
form the basis for
inter-institutional pioneering, we
hope to get a major breakthrough
on China and Japan."
Stanford's program currently
involves about 120 graduate
students with 19 faculty members
teaching and carrying out research
on China and 11 others on Japan.
They are concerned not only
with research but with
communicating their findings to
the academic community and the
public at large.
Different Chinese Societies
"If Americans generally are
going to make sensible judgments
in the '70's, as they did not do in
the '60's, they must have a sound
basis of knowledge," Lewis states.
"It is a matter of great urgency to
us to communicate the
information we now have."
He points to popular
assumptions such as the
"monolith" view of China as
hostile to the U.S. and threatening
to Asia.
"China is made up of many
different societies," he counters.
"This diversity is a part of the
leadership problem, and Mao is
more perplexed by this problem
than ever before. China is
concerned about commanding the
energies of its own people; it has
tr uned inward, focusing on
building its own structure."
Changes Ignored
Americans have also missed
the major trends in Japan,
over-reacting to economic
progress and not seeing political
and societal changes, which are
more important to the future,
according to Lewis.
Recent efforts to inform the
Stanford community are centered
on the lecture series "The
Concept of Man in Communist
China and Chinese Educational
Theory," given by Professor
Donald J. Munroe of Berkeley on
Wednesday evenings during the
month of February. This week's
presentation, "Malleability of
Man" will be given at 8 p.m. in
Bishop Auditorium.
Lewis regrets that the spotlight
has recently been turned so
sharply away from international
studies to pollution and other
topics; similarly, that the U.S. in
Vietnam has dropped out of the
news.
With the veto of the recent
HEW bill, NDEA Title VI,
concerned with foreign study, is
likely to be cut, reducing the level
of funding to a mere fraction of
that of the '50's and '60's,
according to Lewis.

A slow-down in research could
even lead to a repeat of the effects
of the purge of Asian scholars in
the early '50's when the
communist scare swept the nation
and the level of knowledge on
Asian rapidly declined.
"For twenty years America
has been paying the price of that
purge - a lack of knowledge on
East Asia just at the point in our
history when it is crucial," Lewis
states.
By maximizing resources and
concentrating attention on
specific areas, the East Asian
studies center hopes to overcome
these obstacles and add greatly to
the body of knowledge on
modern China and Japan.
An example of the
methodology is the "Local
Systems" project, which focuses
on a few specific regions in China,
studying the villages, factories,
school, marketing systems, etc., of
that area.
"Rather than studying only
the national leadership today, a
subject rather difficult to
penetrate, we capitalize on our
strengths. We have marvelous
documentation on the Chinese
and Japanese localities household
records, newspapers, and village
histories."
United Efforts
The Center for East Asian
Studies grew out of the
cooperation of several scholars in
diverse disciplines, who began
working together about five years
ago.
"We realized that the only
hope for the field of Chinese
studies was in uniting our efforts
and began working out a basis for
this in a scholarly community,"
explains Lewis.
The Center for Research and
International Studies funded the

new community for East Asian
studies, which is now hoping to
expand and expecting substantial
financial support in the future.
In addition to increasing the
number of courses on East Asia,
the large number of faculty with
specialization in China and Japan
have incorporated their
knowledge in basic courses. An
example is Professor Stephen
Olsen, who draws heavily on his
expertise on China in his regular
sociology course.
About two-thirds of the
students specialize in China; the
others study Japan. l Most are
Ph.D. candidates in other
departments who want intensive
training in China or Japan for
their doctoral programs. At
present 14 students are enrolled
exclusively in the East Asian
Studies M.A. Program The
two-year work is equally divided
between intensive language study
and nine courses selected from
any department.
Over 160 East Asian courses
are offered by the departments of
anthropology, art, Asian
languages, economics, history,
humanities-religious studies,
philosophy, and political science.
Many of these are undergraduate
courses and attract a large number
of undergraduate students.
"Students are complete
members of projects such as the
one on Local Systems. They
helped to plan it and have equal
say in the allocation of money,"
Lewis reports. "They are fully
involved as scholars in their own
right."
Graduates of the program are
helping to fill the great demand to
staff colleges on East Asian
studies. They are also increasingly
going into applied work with
business, government and military
positions.

"major breakthrough" on China

building its own structure."
Changes Ignored
Americans have also missed
the major trends in Japan,
over-reacting to economic
progress and not seeing political
and societal changes, which are
more important to the future,
according to Lewis.
Recent efforts to inform the
Stanford community are centered
on the lecture series "The
Concept of Man in Communist
China and Chinese Educational
Theory," given by Professor
Donald J. Munroe of Berkeley on
Wednesday evenings during the
month of February. This week's
presentation, "Malleability of
Man" will be given at 8 p.m. in
Bishop Auditorium.
Lewis regrets that the spotlight
has recently been turned so
sharply away from international
studies to pollution and other
topics; similarly, that the U.S. in
Vietnam has dropped out of the
news.
With the veto of the recent
HEW bill, NDEA Title VI,
concerned with foreign study, is
likely to be cut, reducing the level
of funding to a mere fraction of
that of the '50's and '60's,
according to Lewis.

A slow-down in research could
even lead to a repeat of the effects
of the purge of Asian scholars in
the early '50's when the
communist scare swept the nation
and the level of knowledge on
Asian rapidly declined.
"For twenty years America
has been paying the price of that
purge - a lack of knowledge on
East Asia just at the point in our
history when it is crucial," Lewis
states.
By maximizing resources and
concentrating attention on
specific areas, the East Asian
studies center hopes to overcome
these obstacles and add greatly to
the body of knowledge on
modern China and Japan.
An example of the
methodology is the "Local
Systems" project, which focuses
on a few specific regions in China,
studying the villages, factories,
school, marketing systems, etc., of
that area.
"Rather than studying only
the national leadership today, a
subject rather difficult to
penetrate, we capitalize on our
strengths. We have marvelous
documentation on the Chinese
and Japanese localities household
records, newspapers, and village
histories."
United Efforts
The Center for East Asian
Studies grew out of the
cooperation of several scholars in
diverse disciplines, who began
working together about five years
ago.
"We realized that the only
hope for the field of Chinese
studies was in uniting our efforts
and began working out a basis for
this in a scholarly community,"
explains Lewis.
The Center for Research and
International Studies funded the

new community for East Asian
studies, which is now hoping to
expand and expecting substantial
financial support in the future.
In addition to increasing the
number of courses on East Asia,
the large number of faculty with
specialization in China and Japan
have incorporated their
knowledge in basic courses. An
example is Professor Stephen
Olsen, who draws heavily on his
expertise on China in his regular
sociology course.
About two-thirds of the
students specialize in China; the
others study Japan. l Most are
Ph.D. candidates in other
departments who want intensive
training in China or Japan for
their doctoral programs. At
present 14 students are enrolled
exclusively in the East Asian
Studies M.A. Program The
two-year work is equally divided
between intensive language study
and nine courses selected from
any department.
Over 160 East Asian courses
are offered by the departments of
anthropology, art, Asian
languages, economics, history,
humanities-religious studies,
philosophy, and political science.
Many of these are undergraduate
courses and attract a large number
of undergraduate students.
"Students are complete
members of projects such as the
one on Local Systems. They
helped to plan it and have equal
say in the allocation of money,"
Lewis reports. "They are fully
involved as scholars in their own
right."
Graduates of the program are
helping to fill the great demand to
staff colleges on East Asian
studies. They are also increasingly
going into applied work with
business, government and military
positions.
Momentum is building for a
"major breakthrough" on China
and Japan.
Overshadowed by
developments in nuclear physics
and the current furor over
pollution, research on twentieth
century East Asia is progressing
rapidly and excitingly among a
strong community of Stanford
scholars.
Created only one year ago, the
Center for East Asian Studies is
unique in its concentration of
faculty and collected documents.
No other university offers
comparable opportunity for
interdisciplinary and interarea
research and training, according to
John W. Lewis, chairman of the
Committee on East Asian Studies.
"However, several of the
research projects on China and
Japan go beyond Stanford,"
emphasizes Lewis. "We are
helping to support other
universities and to end
competition. By beginning to
form the basis for
inter-institutional pioneering, we
hope to get a major breakthrough
on China and Japan."
Stanford's program currently
involves about 120 graduate
students with 19 faculty members
teaching and carrying out research
on China and 11 others on Japan.
They are concerned not only
with research but with
communicating their findings to
the academic community and the
public at large.
Different Chinese Societies
"If Americans generally are
going to make sensible judgments
in the '70's, as they did not do in
the '60's, they must have a sound
basis of knowledge," Lewis states.
"It is a matter of great urgency to
us to communicate the
information we now have."
He points to popular
assumptions such as the
"monolith" view of China as
hostile to the U.S. and threatening
to Asia.
"China is made up of many
different societies," he counters.
"This diversity is a part of the
leadership problem, and Mao is
more perplexed by this problem
than ever before. China is
concerned about commanding the
energies of its own people; it has
tr uned inward, focusing on
building its own structure."

the national leadership today, a
subject rather difficult to
penetrate, we capitalize on our
strengths. We have marvelous
documentation on the Chinese
and Japanese localities household
records, newspapers, and village
histories."
United Efforts
The Center for East Asian
Studies grew out of the
cooperation of several scholars in
diverse disciplines, who began
working together about five years
ago.
"We realized that the only
hope for the field of Chinese
studies was in uniting our efforts
and began working out a basis for
this in a scholarly community,"
explains Lewis.
The Center for Research and
International Studies funded the

new community for East Asian
studies, which is now hoping to
expand and expecting substantial
financial support in the future.
In addition to increasing the
number of courses on East Asia,
the large number of faculty with
specialization in China and Japan
have incorporated their
knowledge in basic courses. An
example is Professor Stephen
Olsen, who draws heavily on his
expertise on China in his regular
sociology course.
About two-thirds of the
students specialize in China; the
others study Japan. l Most are
Ph.D. candidates in other
departments who want intensive
training in China or Japan for
their doctoral programs. At
present 14 students are enrolled
exclusively in the East Asian
Studies M.A. Program The
two-year work is equally divided
between intensive language study
and nine courses selected from
any department.
Over 160 East Asian courses
are offered by the departments of
anthropology, art, Asian
languages, economics, history,
humanities-religious studies,
philosophy, and political science.
Many of these are undergraduate
courses and attract a large number
of undergraduate students.
"Students are complete
members of projects such as the
one on Local Systems. They
helped to plan it and have equal
say in the allocation of money,"
Lewis reports. "They are fully
involved as scholars in their own
right."
Graduates of the program are
helping to fill the great demand to
staff colleges on East Asian
studies. They are also increasingly
going into applied work with
business, government and military
positions.
Momentum is building for a
"major breakthrough" on China
and Japan.
Overshadowed by
developments in nuclear physics
and the current furor over
pollution, research on twentieth
century East Asia is progressing
rapidly and excitingly among a
strong community of Stanford
scholars.
Created only one year ago, the
Center for East Asian Studies is
unique in its concentration of
faculty and collected documents.
No other university offers
comparable opportunity for
interdisciplinary and interarea
research and training, according to
John W. Lewis, chairman of the
Committee on East Asian Studies.
"However, several of the
research projects on China and
Japan go beyond Stanford,"
emphasizes Lewis. "We are
helping to support other
universities and to end
competition. By beginning to
form the basis for
inter-institutional pioneering, we
hope to get a major breakthrough
on China and Japan."
Stanford's program currently
involves about 120 graduate
students with 19 faculty members
teaching and carrying out research
on China and 11 others on Japan.
They are concerned not only
with research but with
communicating their findings to
the academic community and the
public at large.
Different Chinese Societies
"If Americans generally are
going to make sensible judgments
in the '70's, as they did not do in
the '60's, they must have a sound
basis of knowledge," Lewis states.
"It is a matter of great urgency to
us to communicate the
information we now have."
He points to popular
assumptions such as the
"monolith" view of China as
hostile to the U.S. and threatening
to Asia.
"China is made up of many
different societies," he counters.
"This diversity is a part of the
leadership problem, and Mao is
more perplexed by this problem
than ever before. China is
concerned about commanding the
energies of its own people; it has
tr uned inward, focusing on
building its own structure."
Changes Ignored
Americans have also missed
the major trends in Japan,
over-reacting to economic
progress and not seeing political
and societal changes, which are
more important to the future,
according to Lewis.
Recent efforts to inform the
Stanford community are centered
on the lecture series "The
Concept of Man in Communist
China and Chinese Educational
Theory," given by Professor
Donald J. Munroe of Berkeley on
Wednesday evenings during the
month of February. This week's
presentation, "Malleability of
Man" will be given at 8 p.m. in
Bishop Auditorium.
Lewis regrets that the spotlight
has recently been turned so
sharply away from international
studies to pollution and other
topics; similarly, that the U.S. in
Vietnam has dropped out of the
news.
With the veto of the recent
HEW bill, NDEA Title VI,
concerned with foreign study, is
likely to be cut, reducing the level
of funding to a mere fraction of
that of the '50's and '60's,
according to Lewis.

A slow-down in research could
even lead to a repeat of the effects
of the purge of Asian scholars in
the early '50's when the
communist scare swept the nation
and the level of knowledge on
Asian rapidly declined.
"For twenty years America
has been paying the price of that
purge - a lack of knowledge on
East Asia just at the point in our
history when it is crucial," Lewis
states.
By maximizing resources and
concentrating attention on
specific areas, the East Asian
studies center hopes to overcome
these obstacles and add greatly to
the body of knowledge on
modern China and Japan.
An example of the
methodology is the "Local
Systems" project, which focuses
on a few specific regions in China,
studying the villages, factories,
school, marketing systems, etc., of
that area.
"Rather than studying only
the national leadership today, a
subject rather difficult to
penetrate, we capitalize on our
strengths. We have marvelous
documentation on the Chinese
and Japanese localities household
records, newspapers, and village
histories."
