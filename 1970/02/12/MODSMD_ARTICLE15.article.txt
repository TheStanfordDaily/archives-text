# Racial Showdown In Mountain View
## 
### JESSE CEDARBAUM 
Recent controversy over
discipline policies is forcing a
racial showdown in the Mountain
View - Los Altos High School and
elementary school districts. The
principle bone of contention is a
demerit discipline system
instituted this year for the
disciplining of elementary school
students.
Militant Mexican-Americans
have raised strong objections to
this policy, stating that it permits
teachers to discriminate against
Chicano students. Last week the
school district suspended Ruben
Michel, a Chicano student at
Graham Junior High, for
accumulating too many demerits.
In addition to demanding the
abolition of the demerit system
and the reinstatement of Michel,
the Chicanos are demanding that
more Mexican-American teachers
and administrators be hired, that
relevant Mexican-American
Citizens' Advisory Committee be
established.
"We were one of the first
schools that met the demands of
the Brown militants," said Don
LoPresti, a teacher who hits
spearheaded curriculum changes
and in-service training programs
for teachers in minority relations,
"but the things we did (do) were
just tokenism."

LoPresti and fellow Faculty
members Paul de la Rosa and
Ronald Witort, have come under
fire from other teachers and the
powers -that-be within the school
system for their activist attitudes
in school-Chicano relations.
Witort was recently removed
as chairman of Mountain View's
High Schools Community
Relations Committee (CRC) by
Principal Collie Kidwell, with the
support of District Supt. A. Blaine
Huntsman. LoPresti has asked to
be re-assigned to the English
department and de la Rosa has
requested to be relieved of his
duties as multicultural director for
the district.
These three believe that the
Chicanos, both students and
parents, feel that the school
system is insincere in its efforts to
make the educational process
more relevant for them, and are
trying to break down the barriers
in communication between the
school and the home.
As head of the CRC, Witort
attempted not to defend the
schools against the parents'
complaints, but rather, he tried to
listen to what the parents had to
say. The school felt that he was
not doing the job, but there has
been much community support in
seeking his reinstatement. His case
comes before the School Board
Monday night.
