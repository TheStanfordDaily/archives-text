# New SDS Chapter Forming Strategy
## 
### 
Members of the
Worker-Student Alliance Caucus
met Tuesday night to form a
chapter of the Boston centered
National Students for a
Democratic Society.
WSA, one of several SDS
factions, was expelled from the
Stanford SDS last summer, (see
column in last Monday's I)ail> )
The new chapter hopes to develop
a "pro-working class strategy" of
having students get jobs where
they will be able to form personal
ties with workers.
Tuesday's meeting was
primarily concerned with
discussing charges which have
been leveled between the factions,
and this strategy. Several members
stated the chapter should avoid
sectarian rhetoric which would
tend to exclude members of
Stanford SDS or the New
Moratorium
Concerning a charge that WSA
and the Progressive Labor party
had denounced Ho Chi Minh and
the Black Panther leadership, one
member stated that "This was a
distortion, but not a lie." He
added that PL had denounced

these leaderships, but that it
supported the struggle ol the
North Vietnamese people and the
Panther members. He said that
these statements had been taken
out of the context of internal
movement criticism.
Another charge nas been that
the VVSA job-getting tactic is
"scabbing" as it would allow
companies or universities to hire
cheaper student labor and thus
displace workers.
One member commented that
anytime a student took a job, he
was automatically scabbing.
Others added that these jobs
would be jobs assigned to students
anyway, and that it was important
to develop worker ties.
The WSA hopes that worker
support will provide a base for
fights such as one against ROTC
which would not leave the
university every four years.
It was mentioned that there is
currently a general "speedup" and
that by this and recent layoffs
"the workers were paying for
their own raise."
The SDS chapter will hold a
workshop this Saturday to make
further strategy plans.
