# Stop-Gap Expansion
## Bookstore Grows 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
A $55,000 "stop-gap"
expansion of the Stanford
Bookstore will provide increased
display area, new check-out
counters, and expanded
book-buy-back services by Spring
Quarter's textbook rush
According to Ivan L.
Sanderson, General Manager of
the Bookstore, three new,
convertible check-out counters
will be added to the existing row
in peak periods of store use, and,
concurrently, there will be a
re-designed entranceway that will
provide easy access to a new,
permanent book-return and
buy-back counter.
„ The new entranceway will be
bracketed by the book-return and
check-out counters —both
continuously staffed—thus helping
to cut down on shoplifting costs
which were over $50,000 last
year.
The Bookstore in the past had
hired a "jobber" to buy back used
student books that were to be
used the following quarter.
Sanderson noted that the
Bookstore itself will now take
over this function, providing far
better service and courtesy. In
addition, paperbacks that are
textbooks will be bought back at
half-price, just as hardbacks are
now.
The additional space to be
provided will come from the
elimination of the rear-covered
walkway and by the
re-distribution of office and
store-room space. When this
expansion is completed, the
present nine-year old Bookstore
facility will be utilized to its
fullest capacity.
Sanderson thus described the
expansion as "stop-gap" because
it is designed to meet the needs of
the present Stanford community.
The Stanford Bookstore is not
a profit-making institution. Last
year $3,000,000 in sales were
recorded, with $120,000
going back to the students in
discount. Only $978 was left over
as surplus after costs and wages
had been met. This money was
then put back into the
Bookstore's reserve - now close to
$100,000 after about fifteen
years.
This reserve is currently
earmarked for the projected
future expansion of the Bookstore
- although two projected plans for
plant expansion would each cost
nearly $1,000,000.
Sanderson indicated that the
additional space gained probably
will be used for an expanded
general merchandise section. He
explained that the money made
on these items helps to offset
whatever discounts are offered on
textbooks and general books, 70%
of the Bookstore sales. He said
that he wants very much to
expand the general book selection

but that general merchandise
would also be concurrently
expanded.
Two additional factors in the
financial structure of the
Bookstore are employees' wages
and growth of the Stanford
community. Wages have increased
in the past months - necessitating
the drop in the discount offered
to students from 8% to 5% and
will increase from $400 per
month to $450 in the next six
months.
The other factor is that the
growth of the Stanford
community using the Bookstore is
currently leveling off, so that any
increase in Bookstore use by the
addition of more merchandise,
will have to be predicted in terms
of a constant population.
Sanderson does feel that a
future expansion - "perhaps in
two, three years time" - will be
necessary, and that an expanded
bookstore could be a very
worthwhile venture. He would
like to see general merchandise
expanded into such areas as a
Hi-Fi center and general gbooks,
each to be much more inclusive
than they are now.
Two plans have been proposed
for the expansion of the
Bookstore proper. One, a separate
general merchandise/stationery
store, could be built near the Post
Office, leaving the present facility
for books alone.
The other, which Sanderson is
particularly excited about, would
be a three-story addition
extending out into what is now
the rear parking lot. Parking
would be coordinated with the
new Law School complex, to be
built behind the Post Office.
"We don't want to reduce our
services in any way," Sanderson
noted. "And we certainly want to
build up all areas of the Stanford
Bookstore. However, this would
frankly mean going beyond the
present structure."
"To keep pace with rising
salaries and costs, and, to provide
a more complete general book
department, we will have to
expand greatly in the area of
general merchandise. And to do
this we will have to have more
room. "It would be an investment
in space."
Sanderson explained that the
governing board of the bookstore,
a .50-man faculty group called the
Bookstore Membership," is
considering expansion proposals,
but for the present is more'
concerned with utilizing all space
available in the present facility.
The "membership," which sets
general policy, reviews the
Bookstore finances, and hires
administrative personel has an
executive body of ten, including
two non-voting student members,
John Grube, of the ASSU Council
of Presidents, and David Swift,
the student financial manager.
