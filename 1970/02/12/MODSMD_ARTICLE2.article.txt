# Meal Exchange This Quarter
## Revised Rush Starts Monday 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Hoping to attract more people
to see for themselves what
fraternities are really like,
Stanford's Intra-Fraternity
Council (IFC) has planned some
changes in its traditional rush
procedures.
After examining three
different rush proposals, the IFC
settled on a plan featuring only
meal exchanges and publicity
during Winter Quarter. Open
houses, usually held at this time,
will not begin until the first week
in April, next quarter.
"The idea of delaying the open
houses," said Gordon Norman,
chairman of the IFC Council of
Presidents, "was due to the fact

that we felt most freshmen were
not terribly concerned with their
living situation next year in the
middle of Winter Quarter."
Norman, a member of Kappa
Sigma, said that fraternity
members will have a better chance
to explain fraternities as a living
alternative before open houses
begin. "In the three weeks of
open house it is virtually
impossible to give a realistic
picture of fraternity life," he
believes.
The meal exchange program,
run by Jim Eakin of the Chi Psi
house, begins next Monday and
runs until February 27. Students
who earlier expressed an interest

in fraternities have been randomly
paired with houses.
They will visit the houses and
eat meals there in order to
acquaint themselves with
fraternity life and question
members. The program is still
open for those who have not yet
indicated an interest.
In the second aspect of Winter
Quarter rush, the publicity
program, fraternity
representatives will visit dorms to
explain why they feel fraternities
are worthwhile and viable living
alternative.
The informal discussions are
designed to clear up uncertainty
about fraternity life and to
provide fraternity representatives
with feedback before open houses
begin.
A rush book will also be
distributed this quarter. It will
contain vital statistics of each
house (intramural activities, grade
point average, etc.) and two
paragraphs written by each house
on its members and general
activities.
Open houses, scheduled for
the first three weeks in April, will
provide students more
opportunities to see houses and
talk with members. Rush parties
will then be given, and pledge bids
extended the weekend of April 24
and 25.
