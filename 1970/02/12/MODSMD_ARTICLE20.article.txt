# Stanford Radar Deputy: A Day In The Life Of...
## 
### RICHARD EMBRY 
A small green sports car came
zipping up Campus Drive, just
south of the Medical Center.
Several hundred yards ahead, the
meter needle of the radar set in
the black and white patrol car
leaped up to 40, remained there
for a few seconds, and then
quickly eased down to 30. The
MG cruised innocently by, its
driver looking straight ahead, both
hands on the wheel, almost as if
he hadn't noticed the radar unit.
"People here are really
4 heads-up'â€”very alert." noted
Officer Michael Knapp. "I'll go
for days without giving any
tickets, and then on some days I'll
have to write out three or four,"
he added.
A deputy with the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department,
Knapp was assigned to patrol the
Stanford area about three weeks
ago. The University, like the
incorporated cities of Saratoga,
Cupertino, Los Altos Hills, and
Monti Sereno, contracts with the
Sheriff's Department for traffic
control.
At 30, Knapp is still mixing
education with his police work.
He joined the police force in
Milpitas while a junior at San Jose
State College, and after serving at
West Point with the 57th Military
Police, an honor company, he
entered law school at the
University of Santa Clara. He
expects to finish there this year,
and would like to practice "back
East."
Disarmingly tall and quite
talkative, Knapp is quick to
emphasize the accuracy of th'
calibrated speedometer and the

omnipresent."
In addition to traffic control,
Knapp investigates felonies on
campus such as grand larceny,
auto theft, and rape. Stanford
Police handle parking violations,
misdemenors such as petty theft,
and non-injury automobile
accidents. The Highway Patrol
attends to injury accidents.
Although his work at Stanford
is similar to his previous work in
San Jose and Milpitas, Knapp
finds people here "a little more
friendly." He has had no serious
incidents during his first three
weeks here.
Knapp seemed surprised that
he has only been called "pig"
once by a group of co-eds while at
Stanford. The term is one to
which he has become accustomed,
but nevertheless, it upsets him.
"It really bothers you when a
good-looking girl call you a pig for
no reason."

radar equipment in his
well-equiped patrol car, which can
pick up cars at distances up to a
half-mile.
Few of the cars passing the
radar unit on Campus Drive were
traveling faster than 30. Only the
green MG exceeded the 35 mile
per hour limit.
"I usually give them much
more than five, but it depends on
the situation more than anything
else," Knapp explained. "If a car
is doing 35 on Serra (speed limit is
25), and people are having to
scatter to get out of the way, then
I'll pull him over. But if
somebody is doing 35 on Mayfield
and there's nobody around, that
may be all right."
Later, while watching a
dangerous intersection in a
residential area, Knapp remarked,
"We try to keep an eye on the
accident areas as much as we can.
We want people to think we're
