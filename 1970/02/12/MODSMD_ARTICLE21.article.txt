# PR Men Get Word To Sell Ecology Now
## 
### 
We have the technology to
manage our air-water environment
effectively but the public will
have to be persuaded it is worth
the price, a environmental
engineer told a social science
seminar of public relations men
here Wednesday
Prof. Rolf Eiiassen urged the
PR men to help "educate and
communicate" by working with
engineers, urban planners, and
ecologists in persuading
conservation groups, women's
leagues, and others to apply
pressure on legislators, control
agencies and similar groups.
"If you really want to force
the automobile manufacutrers to
speed the development of
antipollution control engines and
devices," he added, "you should
persuade all the women in the Los
Angeles Basin to refuse to buy
new cars during any one year.
"They can bring the automobile
manufacturers to their knees
faster than any amount of
legislation or government
enforcement." "What we have
to do through communication and
education is to create a demand
for professional and technological
services. These demands in turn
will be handed over to public
administrators and legislators who
can give us the legislation,
appropriations and institutions to
enable us to develop, design, and
construct facilities to improve the
environment.
"Our objective is to apply
scientific and engineering
principles to the control of air and
water environmental systems. This
is urban ecology â€”the
interrelationship between man
and the air and water
environmental systems.
Water Control
Concerning water pollution,
Eliassen criticized the waste of
water and questioned the wisdom
of piping to arid regions.
"Water may be the key to
population control in specific
areas where it is a limiting
resource, as in Southern
California," he continued.
"However, civil engineers have
built structures and facilities to
transport water many hundreds of
miles from the Owens River
Valley, the Colorado River, and
now from far up in Northern
California so that more industries
could support more people in the
Los Angeles Basin.
"A more rational approach to
planning for living in a limited air
environment would have been to
restrict the development of new
water supplies and thus restrict
population. Who would have the
courage to do this?"
Turning to problems of
removing "solid waste" or trash,
Eliassen pointed out that the U.S.
now generates 3.65 billion tons of
it annually. This includes mining
and agricultural wastes in addition
to industrial and urban barbage.
"Incineration has some great
possibilities for reducing the
volume of solid wastes by
controlled combustion," he said.
"Air pollution control can be very
effective.
"Ten percent of the power in
the U.S. could be generated from

solid wastes if all the urban wastes
were incinerated in modern
furnaces using pressurized
combustion and gas turbines
coupled to electric generators."
Nuclear Power
For the future, however,
Eliassen looks to nuclear power to
provide the huge increase from
325 million kilowatts now to the
15 00 million kilowatts that
authorities predict will be needed
by the year 2000.
He urged caution in the
location of nuclear power plants.
Three reactors on the Illinois
River take its entire flow for
cooling during low summer flows,
thus raising the river temperature
about 15 degrees. This will change
the stream's ecology and affect its
plant life.
On the other hand, there have
been reports of fishermen getting
larger oysters near the Humboldt
reactor on California's northern
coast, and Maine fishermen got
bigger lobsters as condenser
discharges warmed the frigid New
England waters slightly.
"One must look at the total
air-water environment when
planning the location of power
plants."
