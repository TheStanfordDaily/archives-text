# Dusting off the 'Quad'
## ROTC : 51 Years Here 
### 
"Our University holds its head
high today and thinks with pride
of the men who are representing it
in all branches of national service.
. . It is most important for the
type of man who comes to our
University to realize that he must

allow his country to make the
fullest use of his developed and
latent talents in solving the
intricate problems brought to the
surface by the war. . . We watch
with sad hearts our honor roll
grow larger week by week. Let us
here in the University in our
various chosen fields work harder
and harder to be worthy of the
sacrifice our men have made and
to be ready to take their place as
they fall."
Provost Howard Brooks at the
Pentagon? Wrong. That was a
statement issued by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur to the members of
the Stanford community in 1919,
the year ROTC was established on
campus.
Stanford's involvement with
the military actually began in
1891, when Lieutenant Joseph S.
Oyster founded a unit similar to
today's ROTC. The unit was soon
discontinued but in 1916 we find
Jens Bugge and his infantry
batallion of 392 students
marching through the quad.
According to the Stanford
Quad of 1918, "A course in
intensive training, seven hours
each day, was offered by the
University in place of the usual
University work, full credit being
given to all of those in good
standing."
At that time, because of the
demands of the war, half of the
student body left for the service,
while the other half prepared in
the campus program.
Shortly after World War I,
ROTC as such was established at
Stanford. The curriculum had
expanded to tactics, artillery
firing-with the new French 75 mm
guns-riding, driving, gun drill,
mounted drill, polo, pistol firing
and simulated combat problems.
According to Colonel Stanley
Ramey of the Army ROTC
department, "Polo was probably
the most attractive feature of the
program at that time, since we
had all the horses."
The attitude of the students
towards the program was
favorable. This attitude, currently
held by many alumni, trustees and
administrative officers, is clearly
brought forth in the 1919 Quad:
"But regardless of immediate war
or peace, the Stanford Reserve
Officer's Training Corps occupies
for all time a definite place in
Stanford life and in the life of the
nation."
After stressing the challenge
that military life presents to the
Stanford man, the Quad
continued, "But Stanford
students have taken this volunteer
training are not barren of benefits.
. . The drill work has given them
the opportunity for exercise
productive of healthy bodies and
manly bearing, the kind of
practice which injects the habit of
decisive action. . ."
In 1943 the Stanford ROTC
program was supplanted by the
Army Specialized Training
Program (ASTP) which trained
some 11,928 service personnel.
The courses taught were Field

Artillery, Ordinance and
Quartermaster.
ROTC resumed its four year
course in 1946. By the middle of
1948 the enrollment was up to
384 students. Besides offering
Artillery, Ordinance and
Quartermaster courses, the
program proudly acquired a
40-piece marching band.
Shortly after World War 11, the
Navy and the Air Force formed
separate departments from the
army. In 1946 Air Force ROTC
was established and shortly after
Navy ROTC joined.
All programs retained the
specific military-oriented nature
until the late 1960's when their
academic validity began to be
questioned. In 1968 a group of
civilian and military educators
updated the Navy's courses.
The Air Force has slightly
changed its course content by
offering a "course substitution
program" in which students
fullfill requirements by taking
University courses.
Since 1950 ROTC has had an
enrollment between 300 and 400
students in total each year.
Hundreds of officers have been
commissioned, many going on to
receive technical training. Others,
such as those coming out of the
Navy program, immediately take
command on a ship.
Most of the cadets graduating
from the army program serve a
tour of duty in Vietnam. Of
those, several have received
distinguished medals and a
number have been killed or
wounded in action.
Lately enrollment has fallen,
especially freshman enrollments in
the Army. Although Ramey
admits that this drop may be
partly due to the anti-war climate
on campus, he holds that the new
draft lottery may be decisive in
many cases. "A lot of students
just wait and see what their
number is before they enroll."
Since Stanford is under
contractual obligation to maintain
an enrollment of at least 100
students in the Army ROTC
program, subcontracts have been
signed with nearby colleges to
insure sufficient enrollment.
Students from Foothill
College, College of San Mateo,
Menlo College and School of
Business, DeAnza College,
Cupertino and Ohlone College
now attend the program.
Students from these colleges
do not have the same privileges as
Stanford students have. They
simply use the campus facilities to
receive ROTC instruction.
Presently there are more
students enlisted in ROTC from
other colleges than there are from
Stanford. Thus the presence of
ROTC on campus involves a lot
more than the interests of
Stanford alone.
At the moment there are
about 170 students enrolled in the
Air Force program, 155 in the
Army program and 113 in the
Navy. The number is in constant
flux because there are always
students dropping out or coming
in to the program. All three
programs provide for graduate
student enrollment.
