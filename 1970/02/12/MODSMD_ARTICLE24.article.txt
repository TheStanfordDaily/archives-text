# Grass Roots Meeting
## 
### 
The Mid-Peninsula's problems
of housing and land use will be
the subject of a community
meeting Thursday, February 12 at
8 p.m. in the First Presbyterian
Church at 1140 Cowper Street,
Palo Alto.
The meeting, titled "The
House That Jack Didn't Build.", is
sponsored by Grass Roots, a new
land use organization. After three
presentations by Grass Roots
members, the meeting will be
opened up to general discussion
from the floor.
One focus of the meeting will
be the local housing shortage. A
30-minute slide show and
narrative by Peter Sly and Natalie
West of Grass Roots will explore
the causes of this shortage by
telling the story of one couple's
search for a place to live.

Rick Boardman and Sandra
Kahn will discuss the new
high-rise developments that are
proposed for Palo Alto, including
the Dillingham Corporation's Palo
Alto Square, the Medical Research
Foundation hospital, and the
Bryant Street superblock. Grass
Goots has taken the position that
private developers are planning a
drastic upheaval in the
environment of the Mid-Peninsula,
against the wishes of a majority of
the people who live and work
here.
Grass Roots is circulating
petitions calling for a halt to lease
signing by Stanford University on
the Palo Alto Square and Coyote
Hill subdivisions. The group will
publish in the near future a
64-page booklet on the
Mid-Peninsula's history, land use,
ecology and housing.
