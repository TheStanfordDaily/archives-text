# Bruins Top Statistics
## 
### 
This was the year the Pacific-8
basketball race was supposed to
be close for a change. And it was,
for a while.
But it really comes as no
surprise to anyone that once
again, the UCLA Bruins are all
alone at the top.
After a hectic weekend in
Washington where the Bruins just
barely escaped from Washington
State, they return home to start
the second round of league play
against the same opponents.
UCLA meets Washington
Saturday afternoon in the TV
game of the week at 2:30 p.m.
The USC Trojans dropped
their four-game conference win
streak up north, losing two
straight.
Stanford, on the strength of
their victory over Oregon State,
is no longer alone in the cellar.
Talented California has joined
them there once again. The Bears,
as always are having trouble
putting things together.
The Indians rank a surprising
third in team offense, behind only
UCLA and USC, but it is defense
that tells the story. Stanford is a
distant last in team "D", allowing
78.3 points per game. Only the
mighty Bruins average that much
offensively (79 per game), so it's
apparent everyone cleans up on
the Tribe.
Stanford is second in both
team free throws and team
rebounding, but is sixth in field
goals.

After a hectic weekend in
Washington where the Bruins just
barely escaped from Washington
State, they return home to start
the second round of league play
against the same opponents.
UCLA meets Washington
Saturday afternoon in the TV
game of the week at 2:30 p.m.
The USC Trojans dropped
their four-game conference win
streak up north, losing two
straight.
Stanford, on the strength of
their victory over Oregon State,
is no longer alone in the cellar.
Talented California has joined
them there once again. The Bears,
as always are having trouble
putting things together.
The Indians rank a surprising
third in team offense, behind only
UCLA and USC, but it is defense
that tells the story. Stanford is a
distant last in team "D", allowing
78.3 points per game. Only the
mighty Bruins average that much
offensively (79 per game), so it's
apparent everyone cleans up on
the Tribe.
Stanford is second in both
team free throws and team
rebounding, but is sixth in field
goals.
