# Against Mormons
## Top-Ranked Panthers Breeze 
### SCOTT BURNS 
Tuesday night, the Panthers showed why they were
rated number one in this week's IM Basketball Poll. They
convincingly destroyed the fourth-rated Marauders, 73-42, a
team which had been averaging 86 points a game going into
the contest.
The Panther scoring punch came mainly from their big
men as forwards Rick Turner and Daryl Frigia poured in 25
and 16 points respectively. The Panthers controlled the
game by constantly stealing the ball from the Marauders and
then keeping the ball until they scored by getting most of
their offensive rebounds.
On Monday night, the tough DU's overcame a 22-18
halftime deficit to upset the 7th ranked Kappa Sigs, 47-38.
Greg Banks led the way for the DU's as he scored 18 points
and grabbed many rebounds, while Warner Greene got 18
counters for the losing Kappa Sigs.
Last week, the Eating Club Championship was
essentially won by El Toro as they held high scoring El
Cuadro under control and won, 70-49. Bob Dunham and
Terry Anderson paced the well-balanced Toro attack with
19 points apiece while their team held leading IM scorer Bill
Reed to only 13 unlucky points.
Most of'the other top 10 teams won their contests. The
second-ranked KA's needed a second-half spurt to beat the
Defending Champs, 49-26. Bob Evers led the winners with
14 points, while the rest of the team had an off-night from
the field.
Third-ranked Branner won its fourth game of the season
by defeating the Trailers, 83-28, as guards Steve Hernandez
and Chris Martin pumped in 21 and 19 apiece for Branner.
All seven players for the fifth-ranked Theta Delts scored
in double figures as they defeated the Fiji's, 87-30. Quick
guard Bruce "Hemet" Wilson scored 16 big ones as he
helped the Delts hand the Phi Kapps their fourth loss of the
season, 53-40.
Langdon 5 won two more games as they overcame the
really tough Forthoffers Five, 59-37, and then barely
slipped by the super-hustling and gunning Spoilers, 72-44.
Their first win was paced by forward John Hainsworth with
21 points while ace guard Guy Smythe led the way in the
second win with 20.
