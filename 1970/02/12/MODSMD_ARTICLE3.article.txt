## Charges Against Calley Stand 
### 
Ft. BENNING, Ga. (AP) -
Defense counsel for Lt. William L.
Calley Jr. lost three moves
Wednesday when a military judge
denied two motions to dismiss all
charges and refused to order the
immediate subpoena of the
nation's top Army and defense
officers.
The defense asked dismissal of
charges that Calley murdered 102
Vietnamese civilians on grounds
the Army lacks jurisdiction. It
contended he is being held in
service illegally beyond his
scheduled Sept. 6, 1969, release
date.
"This court has jurisdiction
over the person of Lt. Calley and
the motion is denied," said
Military Judge. Col. Reid W.
Kennedy.
Kennedy also denied defense
motion to dismiss the charges
because they were improperly
drawn. Civilian attorney Richard
B. Key of Cleveland, Ohio, a
member of the defense team,
argued the specifications in the
charges were too vague and would
not be upheld on appeal.
Kennedy ruled they "are
properly drawn and follow the
form for specifications in the
Manual for Courts-Martial."
The rulings came shortly
before a pretrial hearing was
adjourned until Thursday.
The defense also asked
Kennedy to subpoena Defense
Secretary Melvin Laird, Secretary
of the Army Stanley Resor and
General William Westmoreland,
the Army chief of staff.
Kennedy denied the motion
until defense counsel interviews
the three and comes back "with
something concrete as to what
you expect them to testify to."
Calley has been charged with
murdering 102 Vietnamese
civilians at My Lai in March 1968.
His defense counsel has moved
for dismissal of the charges on
grounds that "command
•nfiuence" played a part in his
\>eing charged. They also contend
he cannot get a fair trial because
of publicity.
Civilian George Latimer,
Calley's chief defense counsel, and
Maj. Kenneth A. Raby, his
military lawyer, claim there was
'nfiuence from President Nixon
down through the military chain
of command.
The U.S. Supreme Court has
reversed convictions when
command influence has been
proven.

Latimer told Kennedy that he
preferred to interview Laird,
Resor and Westmoreland in
Washington.
He asked the military judge to
notify the three that'he would
like to question them. Kennedy
directed the prosecutor, Capt.
Aubrey M. Daniel 111, to do so.
Latimer told Kennedy that
"higher headquarters got into this
case." He referred to earlier
testimony by Col. Jim D. Keirsey,
chief of staff at Ft. Benning, that
he was told by Brig. Gen. Samuel
Reid, chief of staff of the Third
Army, to hold up any action in
the Calley case because there
might be further developments.

Wednesday there will be no letup

protect Americans as far as
attacks from Cambodia, Laos and
North Vietnam are concerned,"

there was any such agreement. t

NEW YORK (AP) - Sen. Harold

that the Nixon administration is
embarked on a course of
restricting individual liberties. He
said it started with what he
termed intimidation of the news

"The safeguarding of our

eroding the individual citizen's

Panther founder Huey Newton's
appeal from a 2-to-15-year term
for killing a white policeman was
argued before the Ist District
Court of Appeal Wednesday while
up to 600 of his supporters
demonstrated outside.
In the courtroom, crowded
with about 200 mostly Negro
spectators, the court took the
appeal under submission after
arguments by defense attorney
Charles Garry.
Carrying "Free Huey" signs,
the demonstrators were fairly
orderly, obeying Panther field
marshals who kept the crowd
from blocking traffic.

Eight were arrested on charges
of obscenity, battery and failure
to obey a lawful order.

WASHINGTON (AP) - From
Stanford in the West to MIT in

defused the situation," one
Pentagon research specialist says.
"The student groups are leaving

cancellation of support of the

Defense counsel for Lt. William L.
Calley Jr. lost three moves
Wednesday when a military judge
denied two motions to dismiss all
charges and refused to order the
immediate subpoena of the
nation's top Army and defense
officers.
The defense asked dismissal of
charges that Calley murdered 102
Vietnamese civilians on grounds
the Army lacks jurisdiction. It
contended he is being held in
service illegally beyond his
scheduled Sept. 6, 1969, release
date.
"This court has jurisdiction
over the person of Lt. Calley and
the motion is denied," said
Military Judge. Col. Reid W.
Kennedy.
Kennedy also denied defense
motion to dismiss the charges
because they were improperly
drawn. Civilian attorney Richard
B. Key of Cleveland, Ohio, a
member of the defense team,
argued the specifications in the
charges were too vague and would
not be upheld on appeal.
Kennedy ruled they "are
properly drawn and follow the
form for specifications in the
Manual for Courts-Martial."
The rulings came shortly
before a pretrial hearing was
adjourned until Thursday.
The defense also asked
Kennedy to subpoena Defense
Secretary Melvin Laird, Secretary
of the Army Stanley Resor and
General William Westmoreland,
the Army chief of staff.
Kennedy denied the motion
until defense counsel interviews
the three and comes back "with
something concrete as to what
you expect them to testify to."
Calley has been charged with
murdering 102 Vietnamese
civilians at My Lai in March 1968.
His defense counsel has moved
for dismissal of the charges on
grounds that "command

he cannot get a fair trial because

appeal from a 2-to-15-year term
for killing a white policeman was
argued before the Ist District
Court of Appeal Wednesday while
up to 600 of his supporters
demonstrated outside.
In the courtroom, crowded

Eight were arrested on charges

WASHINGTON (AP) - From
Stanford in the West to MIT in
the East, defense research on
campuses is undergoing an acid
test of dissent. But Pentagon
officials say programs have not
been seriously affected.
"The pullout of American
troops from Vietnam probably
defused the situation," one
Pentagon research specialist says.
"The student groups are leaving
the war issue and moving to the
pollution problem."
Several American institutions
were the focus of student—and in
instances, faculty—opposition last
year, prompting some Congress
members to urge Pentagon
cancellation of support of the
schools' research programs.
Pentagon officials have chosen,
instead, a policy of letting each
institution work out its problems
alone and on its own.
Ft. BENNING, Ga. (AP) -
Defense counsel for Lt. William L.
Calley Jr. lost three moves
Wednesday when a military judge
denied two motions to dismiss all
charges and refused to order the
immediate subpoena of the
nation's top Army and defense
officers.
The defense asked dismissal of
charges that Calley murdered 102
Vietnamese civilians on grounds
the Army lacks jurisdiction. It
contended he is being held in
service illegally beyond his
scheduled Sept. 6, 1969, release
date.
"This court has jurisdiction
over the person of Lt. Calley and
the motion is denied," said
Military Judge. Col. Reid W.
Kennedy.
Kennedy also denied defense
motion to dismiss the charges
because they were improperly
drawn. Civilian attorney Richard
B. Key of Cleveland, Ohio, a
member of the defense team,
argued the specifications in the
charges were too vague and would
not be upheld on appeal.
Kennedy ruled they "are
properly drawn and follow the
form for specifications in the
Manual for Courts-Martial."
The rulings came shortly
before a pretrial hearing was
adjourned until Thursday.
The defense also asked
Kennedy to subpoena Defense
Secretary Melvin Laird, Secretary
of the Army Stanley Resor and
General William Westmoreland,
the Army chief of staff.
Kennedy denied the motion
until defense counsel interviews
the three and comes back "with
something concrete as to what
you expect them to testify to."
Calley has been charged with
murdering 102 Vietnamese
civilians at My Lai in March 1968.
His defense counsel has moved
for dismissal of the charges on
grounds that "command
•nfiuence" played a part in his
\>eing charged. They also contend
he cannot get a fair trial because
of publicity.
Civilian George Latimer,
Calley's chief defense counsel, and
Maj. Kenneth A. Raby, his
military lawyer, claim there was
'nfiuence from President Nixon
down through the military chain
of command.
The U.S. Supreme Court has
reversed convictions when
command influence has been
proven.

Latimer told Kennedy that he
preferred to interview Laird,
Resor and Westmoreland in
Washington.
He asked the military judge to
notify the three that'he would
like to question them. Kennedy
directed the prosecutor, Capt.
Aubrey M. Daniel 111, to do so.
Latimer told Kennedy that
"higher headquarters got into this
case." He referred to earlier
testimony by Col. Jim D. Keirsey,
chief of staff at Ft. Benning, that
he was told by Brig. Gen. Samuel
Reid, chief of staff of the Third
Army, to hold up any action in
the Calley case because there
might be further developments.

SAIGON (AP) — Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird declared
Wednesday there will be no letup
in the practice of U.S. forces
firing back when fired on from
Cambodia, Laos or North
Vietnam.
"We are doing it in order to
protect Americans as far as
attacks from Cambodia, Laos and
North Vietnam are concerned,"
he told a news conference. "We
are protecting not only our
ground forces but also our

Cambodia has complained
repeatedly that U.S. planes and

North Vietnam accuses the United
States of staging air raids against
its civilian population. Neutral
Laos has no objection to attacks
on North Vietnamese along its
border.

flights over North Vietnam are
part of an understanding with
Hanoi that led to the bombing
Halt Nov. 1, 1968. Hanoi denies
there was any such agreement. t
