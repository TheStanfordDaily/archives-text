This Friday, Feb. 13, many
old men living in Chinatown will
have no way to celebrate the
Chinese New Year. These men
have been forgotten in American
history and their communities,
and will spend the New Year's
alone. The ASIAN AMERICAN
STUDENT ALLIANCE at
Stanford is helping to have a
banquet for these men on Friday
night. We need enough whole
chickens and uncooked rice for
200-400 people. All those who
have contributions please come to
