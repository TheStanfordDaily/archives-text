# Fiji's Co-ed Boarders Must Move Out Soon
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
On the orders of the
University Administration, four
Stan ford co-eds, currently
boarding in the Phi Gamma Delta
House, will have to leave the
house by February 21. The
fraternity has agreed to comply
with the University's decision.
The co-eds, three seniors and a
sophomore, moved into the house
at the beginning of the quarter
without the University's
knowledge, after residents decided
during Fall Quarter to take in
female boarders.

An ultimatum to move the
girls out of the house by last
Monday was issued last week by
Dean of Students Peter Bulkeley.
If the girls were not moved,
Bulkeley stated, till the residents
of the house would be evicted,
and the house would be turned
into a University residence.
The deadline was later
postponed.
Explaining in part his decision,
Bulkeley said, "I think people
ought to know what their living
arrangements are in the fall. They
should not be subjected to change
in the middle of the year.
"I couldn't allow the women
to stay," he added.
'Wanted Them to Stay'
Joe Jiunta, the newly-elected
president of the Fiji house, told
the Daily last night that the
University's final orders were
"fine."
"We decided last night that the
girls had to leave," Jiunta said.
"We wanted them to stay to the
end of the quarter, but it wasn't
possible."
Jiunta declared there was a
difference between the fraternity
going co-ed and taking in girl
boarders. "The girls are an
experiment," he said. "We
thought it would be interesting.
We didn't think it was all that
important (to contact the
University Administration.)
Ruled Forbid Girls
The rules for the National
Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta, of
which the Stanford fraternity is a
member, explicitly forbid the
presence of female residents in
thy house, according to Lee
Troutman, the local representative
of the National Fraternity.
"I disagreed with them when
they told me they were boarding
girls," Troutman said
Evaluating the disagreement
between the Fijis and the Dean of
Students office over the boarders,
Charley White, the past president
of the fraternity, commented,
"Each party was backed into a
wall. Neither could retreat
without losing face.
"We held none of the cards,"
he added. "We were counseled
that it would be wisest for them
to leave."

A desire to protect the girls'
rights was prevalent in a Tuesday
night meeting of the Fiji house
where a vote to keep the girls,
despite the University's position,
fell short of the necessary
three-quarters. However, he
added, "one consideration had to
be our understanding that, if the
girls stayed, we would be
dissolved as a fraternity."
Both the Dean of Students
office and the Fijis seem to favor
working toward a co-ed
arrangement for the house in the
future.
Future Alternatives
In view of the National
Chapter's regulations, White
explains that the Fijis have three
alternatives for future action:
— Complying with National
regulations, and retaining an
all-male status.
—Continuing functioning in
whatever way they see fit, while
not paying their national dues.
—Going local, giving up their
national membership, freeing
them to go co-ed.
The second alternative would
most likely result in the Fiji's
expulsion from the National
Chapter, White explained.
William Leland, Associate
Dean of Students, said in a Daily
article yesterday, "our concern is
primarily with the individuals
residing in the house," and not
primarily with the members of the
national group.
A $9000 debt, accumulated
over a number of years, is owed to
the University by the Fijis. "The
Fijis are in a precarious situation
financially," Bulkeley said.
"Boarders in fraternities are not
favored (by the Administration)—
they are an economic
convenience."
Jiunta echoed Bulkeley's
statement. "We needed the
money," he said.
Many Fiji alumni are
apparently very dissatisfied with
the present situation, and are
opposed to any future co-ed living
in the house.
The University has offered
places in University residences to
the four girls, but it appears that
the offer will not be accepted.

"We decided last night that the
girls had to leave," Jiunta said.
"We wanted them to stay to the
end of the quarter, but it wasn't
possible."
Jiunta declared there was a
difference between the fraternity
going co-ed and taking in girl
boarders. "The girls are an
experiment," he said. "We
thought it would be interesting.
We didn't think it was all that
important (to contact the
University Administration.)
Ruled Forbid Girls
The rules for the National
Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta, of
which the Stanford fraternity is a
member, explicitly forbid the
presence of female residents in
thy house, according to Lee
Troutman, the local representative
of the National Fraternity.
"I disagreed with them when
they told me they were boarding
girls," Troutman said
Evaluating the disagreement
between the Fijis and the Dean of
Students office over the boarders,
Charley White, the past president
of the fraternity, commented,
"Each party was backed into a
wall. Neither could retreat
without losing face.
"We held none of the cards,"
he added. "We were counseled
that it would be wisest for them
to leave."

A desire to protect the girls'
rights was prevalent in a Tuesday
night meeting of the Fiji house
where a vote to keep the girls,
despite the University's position,
fell short of the necessary
three-quarters. However, he
added, "one consideration had to
be our understanding that, if the
girls stayed, we would be
dissolved as a fraternity."
Both the Dean of Students
office and the Fijis seem to favor
working toward a co-ed
arrangement for the house in the
future.
Future Alternatives
In view of the National
Chapter's regulations, White
explains that the Fijis have three
alternatives for future action:
— Complying with National
regulations, and retaining an
all-male status.
—Continuing functioning in
whatever way they see fit, while
not paying their national dues.
—Going local, giving up their
national membership, freeing
them to go co-ed.
The second alternative would
most likely result in the Fiji's
expulsion from the National
Chapter, White explained.
William Leland, Associate
Dean of Students, said in a Daily
article yesterday, "our concern is
primarily with the individuals
residing in the house," and not
primarily with the members of the
national group.
A $9000 debt, accumulated
over a number of years, is owed to
the University by the Fijis. "The
Fijis are in a precarious situation
financially," Bulkeley said.
"Boarders in fraternities are not
favored (by the Administration)—
they are an economic
convenience."
Jiunta echoed Bulkeley's
statement. "We needed the
money," he said.
Many Fiji alumni are
apparently very dissatisfied with
the present situation, and are
opposed to any future co-ed living
in the house.
The University has offered
places in University residences to
the four girls, but it appears that
the offer will not be accepted.
On the orders of the
University Administration, four
Stan ford co-eds, currently
boarding in the Phi Gamma Delta
House, will have to leave the
house by February 21. The
fraternity has agreed to comply
with the University's decision.
The co-eds, three seniors and a
sophomore, moved into the house
at the beginning of the quarter
without the University's
knowledge, after residents decided
during Fall Quarter to take in
female boarders.

An ultimatum to move the
girls out of the house by last
Monday was issued last week by
Dean of Students Peter Bulkeley.
If the girls were not moved,
Bulkeley stated, till the residents
of the house would be evicted,
and the house would be turned
into a University residence.
The deadline was later
postponed.
Explaining in part his decision,
Bulkeley said, "I think people
ought to know what their living
arrangements are in the fall. They
should not be subjected to change
in the middle of the year.
"I couldn't allow the women
to stay," he added.

Joe Jiunta, the newly-elected
president of the Fiji house, told
the Daily last night that the
University's final orders were
