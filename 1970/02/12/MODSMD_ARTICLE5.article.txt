# Curriculum: Cleaver To Allport
## Collective Effort Launched Black Studies 
### FRED MANN (Last in a three-part series) 
Stanford's African and
Afro-American Studies Program
began last year under the guidance
of a steering committee of faculty
and students. An interdepart
mental committee of over 20
faculty members was assigned
responsibility for developing and
administering the program. St.
Clair Drake is now the program's
chairman.
The African side of the
program is led by G. Wesley
Johnson, the initiator of the
African Civ program as a
substitute for Western Civ in the
spring. The largest Afro-American
offering was "Racism and
Prejudice," an interdisciplinary
course that attracted close to 300
people.
The class had no central
theme, and lecturers came from
many different Stanford
departments and from the outside
community. This year, the class
has changed, and is now a
sociology course with Drake doing
the lecturing.
"The collective effort of
students, faculty, and
administration Rot the African
and A fro-A mer ican Studies
Program off the ground," said
Drake. "It was not the kind of
black studies program that those
who fought hardest for it wanted,
but the black students gave it a
try, gained some experience from
participating in it, and made
suggestions and demands for

changes."
Enrollment in Afro-American
Studies courses from the fall to
the winter has increased with the
doubling of the number of classes
being offered. "I think black
enrollment in courses related to
the program has been reasonably
high," said Drake.
During fall quarter, four
classes were offered, and only one
was taught by a black professor.
Currently, eight courses are being
presented, and five of the
instructors are black. Drake
credits the rise in black
enrollment to these factors.
Although course enrollment is
going up, there are still few majors
in the program. Administrative
Assistant in the program, Gerlad
Casimere, cites goals of black
students and excessive time
demands as reasons for this.
"A great number of blacks at
Stanford go on to graduate work
after they receive their degree,
and time for an undergraduate if
very limited," he said. "Of course
its nice to have a background in
Afro-American studies, but
practically speaking, biology and
chemistry are more important for
a black doctor."
Drake added, "I don't judge
the program by the number of
majors, but by the total
enrollment per term."
Cleaver To Allport
The Stanford curriculum in
the black studies program covers
many areas. In the courses where
Eldridge Cleaver and Stokely

Charmichael are relevant, their
works are used. But unlike
programs at many other schools,
social science courses at Stanford
also include Ruth Benedict and
Gordon Allport.
Critics around the country
who predicted the black studies
programs would be "academically
frivolous" have found themselves
mistaken in most instances.
Stanford is one of these.
"At some universities, I'm sure
the programs are firvolous," said
associate provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig. "But we have fine
faculty at Stanford to prevent
this. We have kept ourselves out
of the bag of hiring teachers
specifically for this program. They
are department professors first. If
ou' program should end
tomorrow, we would keep all our
black studies teachers on in their
departmental capacities."
All courses must first be
approved by an established
academic department before being
offered for credit except the core
seminar and three workshops
which receive Afro-American
study credit.
Department Status?
"I think we will see a change
in our program here at Stanford,"
said Casimere. "Either we will
split into two programs or become
a department ourselves."
Drake, the program chairman,
had no comment on the matter.
"I'm trying to do my job as
chairman of the committee
structure we have," he said.

Under the current set up, the
majority of classes are till being
offered in African Studies, rather
than Afro-American Studies. If
the two were separated,
administrators could devote more
time and energy to improving the
Afro-American program.
Departments which now offer
only African Studies classes in the
program and consider that they
have done their part for the whole
program might be compelled to
widen their range of classes to
include some in he separate field
of Afro-American studies.
Departmental status would
give the program the ability to
initiate its own classes, grant its
own degrees, and hire its own
teachers.
Administration Don btful
But administration does not
see either a split or department
organization developing in the
near future.
"The link between African
studies and A fro-American
Studies is not an accidental one."
said Rosenzweig. "We have a
strong faculty on the African side,
and that provides legitimacy for
the entire program. The
Afro-American aspect is, as yet,
not ready to stand alone."
He further called the decision
on departmentalizing the program
"far off in the future," and "a
decision of convenience" when
the time comes.
Under the present organization
university depart me nt s have
recruited faculty on a limited

basis to help the African and
Afro-American Studies program.
Although Rosenzweig says most
of the recruits have been white,
Drake lists six black instructors to
two whites taken on in the
program. All are specialists in
other areas of their discipline in
addition to black studies.
The organization of the
Stanford program is "based on
individuals within different
academic departments," and
Casimere termed the coordination
between these individuals as
"excellent."
Money Is Key
"A main problem is money,"
he said. "If departments could
pay more professors to teach
Afto-American courses, the scope
of our program would widen and
improve."
Discussing the differences
between the Stanford set-up and
those at many state colleges in the
area, Casimere emphasized
Stanford "sticks with qualified
professors" rather than including
outsiders in the teaching process.
The African and
Afro-American Studies Program,
as it exists, is not primarily
concerned with community action
as are black studies programs at
some other schools. The BSU's
student participation center in
East Palo Alto is directed through
a separate organization directly
involved with serving the black
people.

"We've lots of good friends
here. It's tlic best living arrangement
I've had on campus in four years

"I'd been off-campus for two
quarters and I wanted to lie oil
campus again.
"I'll probably live with friends till
the end of the quarter. But I'd really
like to stay."


"We moved four girls in as an
experiment. We thought it would be
interesting. We didn't feel that it was
a big deal.
"The University argued that we

offered for credit except the core
seminar and three workshops
which receive Afro-American
study credit.
Department Status?
"I think we will see a change
in our program here at Stanford,"
said Casimere. "Either we will
split into two programs or become
a department ourselves."
Drake, the program chairman,
had no comment on the matter.
"I'm trying to do my job as
chairman of the committee
structure we have," he said.

Under the current set up, the
majority of classes are till being
offered in African Studies, rather
than Afro-American Studies. If
the two were separated,
administrators could devote more
time and energy to improving the
Afro-American program.
Departments which now offer
only African Studies classes in the
program and consider that they
have done their part for the whole
program might be compelled to
widen their range of classes to
include some in he separate field
of Afro-American studies.
Departmental status would
give the program the ability to
initiate its own classes, grant its
own degrees, and hire its own
teachers.
Administration Don btful
But administration does not
see either a split or department
organization developing in the
near future.
"The link between African
studies and A fro-American
Studies is not an accidental one."
said Rosenzweig. "We have a
strong faculty on the African side,
and that provides legitimacy for
the entire program. The
Afro-American aspect is, as yet,
not ready to stand alone."
He further called the decision
on departmentalizing the program
"far off in the future," and "a
decision of convenience" when
the time comes.
Under the present organization
university depart me nt s have
recruited faculty on a limited

basis to help the African and
Afro-American Studies program.
Although Rosenzweig says most
of the recruits have been white,
Drake lists six black instructors to
two whites taken on in the
program. All are specialists in
other areas of their discipline in
addition to black studies.
The organization of the
Stanford program is "based on
individuals within different
academic departments," and
Casimere termed the coordination
between these individuals as
"excellent."
Money Is Key
"A main problem is money,"
he said. "If departments could
pay more professors to teach
Afto-American courses, the scope
of our program would widen and
improve."
Discussing the differences
between the Stanford set-up and
those at many state colleges in the
area, Casimere emphasized
Stanford "sticks with qualified
professors" rather than including
outsiders in the teaching process.
The African and
Afro-American Studies Program,
as it exists, is not primarily
concerned with community action
as are black studies programs at
some other schools. The BSU's
student participation center in
East Palo Alto is directed through
a separate organization directly
involved with serving the black
people.

JOR JIUNTA Fiji President
Stanford's African and
Afro-American Studies Program
began last year under the guidance
of a steering committee of faculty
and students. An interdepart
mental committee of over 20
faculty members was assigned
responsibility for developing and
administering the program. St.
Clair Drake is now the program's
chairman.
The African side of the
program is led by G. Wesley
Johnson, the initiator of the
African Civ program as a
substitute for Western Civ in the
spring. The largest Afro-American
offering was "Racism and
Prejudice," an interdisciplinary
course that attracted close to 300
people.
The class had no central
theme, and lecturers came from
many different Stanford
departments and from the outside
community. This year, the class
has changed, and is now a
sociology course with Drake doing
the lecturing.
"The collective effort of
students, faculty, and
administration Rot the African
and A fro-A mer ican Studies
Program off the ground," said
Drake. "It was not the kind of
black studies program that those
who fought hardest for it wanted,
but the black students gave it a
try, gained some experience from
participating in it, and made
suggestions and demands for

changes."
Enrollment in Afro-American
Studies courses from the fall to
the winter has increased with the
doubling of the number of classes
being offered. "I think black
enrollment in courses related to
the program has been reasonably
high," said Drake.
During fall quarter, four
classes were offered, and only one
was taught by a black professor.
Currently, eight courses are being
presented, and five of the
instructors are black. Drake
credits the rise in black
enrollment to these factors.
Although course enrollment is
going up, there are still few majors
in the program. Administrative
Assistant in the program, Gerlad
Casimere, cites goals of black
students and excessive time
demands as reasons for this.
"A great number of blacks at
Stanford go on to graduate work
after they receive their degree,
and time for an undergraduate if
very limited," he said. "Of course
its nice to have a background in
Afro-American studies, but
practically speaking, biology and
chemistry are more important for
a black doctor."
Drake added, "I don't judge
the program by the number of
majors, but by the total
enrollment per term."
Cleaver To Allport
The Stanford curriculum in
the black studies program covers
many areas. In the courses where
Eldridge Cleaver and Stokely

Charmichael are relevant, their
works are used. But unlike
programs at many other schools,
social science courses at Stanford
also include Ruth Benedict and
Gordon Allport.
Critics around the country
who predicted the black studies
programs would be "academically
frivolous" have found themselves
mistaken in most instances.
Stanford is one of these.
"At some universities, I'm sure
the programs are firvolous," said
associate provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig. "But we have fine
faculty at Stanford to prevent
this. We have kept ourselves out
of the bag of hiring teachers
specifically for this program. They
are department professors first. If
ou' program should end
tomorrow, we would keep all our
black studies teachers on in their
departmental capacities."
All courses must first be
approved by an established
academic department before being
offered for credit except the core
seminar and three workshops
which receive Afro-American
study credit.

JOR JIUNTA Fiji President
Stanford's African and
Afro-American Studies Program
began last year under the guidance
of a steering committee of faculty
and students. An interdepart
mental committee of over 20
faculty members was assigned
responsibility for developing and
administering the program. St.
Clair Drake is now the program's
chairman.
The African side of the
program is led by G. Wesley
Johnson, the initiator of the
African Civ program as a
substitute for Western Civ in the
spring. The largest Afro-American
offering was "Racism and
Prejudice," an interdisciplinary
course that attracted close to 300
people.
The class had no central
theme, and lecturers came from
many different Stanford
departments and from the outside
community. This year, the class
has changed, and is now a
sociology course with Drake doing
the lecturing.
"The collective effort of
students, faculty, and
administration Rot the African
and A fro-A mer ican Studies
Program off the ground," said
Drake. "It was not the kind of
black studies program that those
who fought hardest for it wanted,
but the black students gave it a
try, gained some experience from
participating in it, and made
suggestions and demands for

changes."
Enrollment in Afro-American
Studies courses from the fall to
the winter has increased with the
doubling of the number of classes
being offered. "I think black
enrollment in courses related to
the program has been reasonably
high," said Drake.
During fall quarter, four
classes were offered, and only one
was taught by a black professor.
Currently, eight courses are being
presented, and five of the
instructors are black. Drake
credits the rise in black
enrollment to these factors.
Although course enrollment is
going up, there are still few majors
in the program. Administrative
Assistant in the program, Gerlad
Casimere, cites goals of black
students and excessive time
demands as reasons for this.
"A great number of blacks at
Stanford go on to graduate work
after they receive their degree,
and time for an undergraduate if
very limited," he said. "Of course
its nice to have a background in
Afro-American studies, but
practically speaking, biology and
chemistry are more important for
a black doctor."
Drake added, "I don't judge
the program by the number of
majors, but by the total
enrollment per term."
Cleaver To Allport
The Stanford curriculum in
the black studies program covers
many areas. In the courses where
Eldridge Cleaver and Stokely

Charmichael are relevant, their
works are used. But unlike
programs at many other schools,
social science courses at Stanford
also include Ruth Benedict and
Gordon Allport.
Critics around the country
who predicted the black studies
programs would be "academically
frivolous" have found themselves
mistaken in most instances.
Stanford is one of these.
"At some universities, I'm sure
the programs are firvolous," said
associate provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig. "But we have fine
faculty at Stanford to prevent
this. We have kept ourselves out
of the bag of hiring teachers
specifically for this program. They
are department professors first. If
ou' program should end
tomorrow, we would keep all our
black studies teachers on in their
departmental capacities."
All courses must first be
approved by an established
academic department before being
offered for credit except the core
seminar and three workshops
which receive Afro-American
study credit.
Department Status?
"I think we will see a change
in our program here at Stanford,"
said Casimere. "Either we will
split into two programs or become
a department ourselves."
Drake, the program chairman,
had no comment on the matter.
"I'm trying to do my job as
chairman of the committee
structure we have," he said.

Under the current set up, the
majority of classes are till being
offered in African Studies, rather
than Afro-American Studies. If
the two were separated,
administrators could devote more
time and energy to improving the
Afro-American program.
Departments which now offer
only African Studies classes in the
program and consider that they
have done their part for the whole
program might be compelled to
widen their range of classes to
include some in he separate field
of Afro-American studies.
Departmental status would
give the program the ability to
initiate its own classes, grant its
own degrees, and hire its own
teachers.
Administration Don btful
But administration does not
see either a split or department
organization developing in the
near future.
"The link between African
studies and A fro-American
Studies is not an accidental one."
said Rosenzweig. "We have a
strong faculty on the African side,
and that provides legitimacy for
the entire program. The
Afro-American aspect is, as yet,
not ready to stand alone."
He further called the decision
on departmentalizing the program
"far off in the future," and "a
decision of convenience" when
the time comes.
Under the present organization
university depart me nt s have
recruited faculty on a limited

basis to help the African and
Afro-American Studies program.
Although Rosenzweig says most
of the recruits have been white,
Drake lists six black instructors to
two whites taken on in the
program. All are specialists in
other areas of their discipline in
addition to black studies.
The organization of the
Stanford program is "based on
individuals within different
academic departments," and
Casimere termed the coordination
between these individuals as
"excellent."
Money Is Key
"A main problem is money,"
he said. "If departments could
pay more professors to teach
Afto-American courses, the scope
of our program would widen and
improve."
Discussing the differences
between the Stanford set-up and
those at many state colleges in the
area, Casimere emphasized
Stanford "sticks with qualified
professors" rather than including
outsiders in the teaching process.
The African and
Afro-American Studies Program,
as it exists, is not primarily
concerned with community action
as are black studies programs at
some other schools. The BSU's
student participation center in
East Palo Alto is directed through
a separate organization directly
involved with serving the black
people.

specifically for this program. They
are department professors first. If
ou' program should end
tomorrow, we would keep all our
black studies teachers on in their
departmental capacities."
All courses must first be
approved by an established
academic department before being
offered for credit except the core
seminar and three workshops
which receive Afro-American
study credit.
Department Status?
"I think we will see a change
in our program here at Stanford,"
said Casimere. "Either we will
split into two programs or become
a department ourselves."
Drake, the program chairman,
had no comment on the matter.
"I'm trying to do my job as
chairman of the committee
structure we have," he said.

Under the current set up, the
majority of classes are till being
offered in African Studies, rather
than Afro-American Studies. If
the two were separated,
administrators could devote more
time and energy to improving the
Afro-American program.
Departments which now offer
only African Studies classes in the
program and consider that they
have done their part for the whole
program might be compelled to
widen their range of classes to
include some in he separate field
of Afro-American studies.
Departmental status would
give the program the ability to
initiate its own classes, grant its
own degrees, and hire its own
teachers.
Administration Don btful
But administration does not
see either a split or department
organization developing in the
near future.
"The link between African
studies and A fro-American
Studies is not an accidental one."
said Rosenzweig. "We have a
strong faculty on the African side,
and that provides legitimacy for
the entire program. The
Afro-American aspect is, as yet,
not ready to stand alone."
He further called the decision
on departmentalizing the program
"far off in the future," and "a
decision of convenience" when
the time comes.
Under the present organization
university depart me nt s have
recruited faculty on a limited

basis to help the African and
Afro-American Studies program.
Although Rosenzweig says most
of the recruits have been white,
Drake lists six black instructors to
two whites taken on in the
program. All are specialists in
other areas of their discipline in
addition to black studies.
The organization of the
Stanford program is "based on
individuals within different
academic departments," and
Casimere termed the coordination
between these individuals as
"excellent."
Money Is Key
"A main problem is money,"
he said. "If departments could
pay more professors to teach
Afto-American courses, the scope
of our program would widen and
improve."
Discussing the differences
between the Stanford set-up and
those at many state colleges in the
area, Casimere emphasized
Stanford "sticks with qualified
professors" rather than including
outsiders in the teaching process.
The African and
Afro-American Studies Program,
as it exists, is not primarily
concerned with community action
as are black studies programs at
some other schools. The BSU's
student participation center in
East Palo Alto is directed through
a separate organization directly
involved with serving the black
people.

"We've lots of good friends
here. It's tlic best living arrangement
I've had on campus in four years
here.
"I'd been off-campus for two
quarters and I wanted to lie oil
campus again.
"I'll probably live with friends till
the end of the quarter. But I'd really
like to stay."


"We moved four girls in as an
experiment. We thought it would be
interesting. We didn't feel that it was
a big deal.
"The University argued that we
knew what University policy on the
matter was. they conceded it
was nebulous.
"We thought that once they saw
what we were doing was working out,
they'd let it slide for a quarter."
