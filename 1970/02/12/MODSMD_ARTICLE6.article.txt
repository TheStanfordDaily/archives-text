# The 						Green Machine
## Movement for A Democratic Military 
### Penny Hill 
Two (ex-marines spoke yester
day about the Movement for
a Democratic Military an
organization of active Gls and
their supporters. The speakers
Ernest Scott and Wayne Morgan,
are associated with the Green
Machine project which is working
with the men at Camp Pendleton,
a marine corps base in Oceanside,
Calif. Originally from Florida and
out of the marine corps since
December, Scott is now a full
time staff member of the Green
Machine. Morgan works with the
green machine but is most active
with the Veterans for Peace
Organization, at Palomar junior
college. He was also one of the
organizers with the December
14th military moratorium in
Oceanside.
The speakers come from the
land of instant milk and plastic
honey Southern Calif. If Camp
Pendleton is the large intestine of
San Diego County, the nearby
Oceanside qualifies as the colon.
Downtown Oceanside consists of
neon lights and shabby stores
filled with over priced junk and
on the weekends it is filled with
young Gls who have nothing to
do but become the prey of these
small time capitalists. The marines
who come to Oceanside filter out
of the 40,000 Gls stationed at
Camp Pendleton which covers 800
square square miles and stretches
from Oceanside to San Clemente.
These men have already
suffered the dehumanization

process of boot camp and many
of them are being prepared for
Viet Nam. They were living a
nightmare of which there was
little relief until MDM developed.
The Movement for a Democratic
Military, according to one of its
newspapers, Attitude Check
which is put our by the Green
Machine MDM "Is a group of
dedicated mil' ury men, who are
working to make the military
respond to the will and needs of
the service men and the American
people. It has adopted a
preamble and has set up 12
demands, which outlines the
organizations beliefs. The
preamble and the 12 demands are:
"Believing the ending of the
suppression of American service
man is an important part of the
larger struggle for basic human
rights, the Movement of a
Democratic Military pledges
support for the self determination
for all peoples, we are dedicated
to using every means at our
disposal to bring about a prompt
end to the war in Vietnam, the
exploitation of our brothers and
sisters abroad and the repression
both economic and physical of
those who are in our own land.
We feel that by remaining silent
the service man has attributed to
the denial of this deep founded
right of himself and of people
everywhere to live free from
intimidation and repression. We
have been silent for a long time,
we will be silent no longer.

1. We demand the right to
collective bargaining.
2. Extend all human and
constitutional rights to military
men and women.
3. Stop all military censorship
and intimidation. We demand
obedience to individual
consciousness, moral, political or
religious. We demand the right to
rufuse objectionable political
duties, such as riot control and
Viet Nam duty We demand that
the MPs be kept out of our
civilian lives.
4. Abolish all mental and
physical cruelty in military brigs,
correctional custodies and basic
training.
5. We demand the abolition of
the present court martial and
non-judicial punishment systems.
All cases should be subject to
automatic review by a board of
civilians elected by ajl military
men having one vote each. Trial
by a jury and court of one's peers
by rank. Eliminate all physical
custody before trial. Place the
military judical system outside of
the chain of command
6. We demand wages equal to
the federal minimum wage for
civilians.
7. We demand the abolition of
the class structure of the military.
End saluting and "sirring" and
special officer privileges and

segregation. End all rank
priviledges. We demand the right
for an enlisted men selective
review board of officer conduct.
We believe that respect can only
be earned on a human relating to
human basis.

8. End all racism everywhere.
Bring to immediate trial, by the
system described above, all
officers and senior enlisted men,
who foment and exploit race
tensions within the military.
9. Free all political prisoners in

return for captured in American
Vietnam. We support freedom
and amnesty for Eldridge Cleaver.
