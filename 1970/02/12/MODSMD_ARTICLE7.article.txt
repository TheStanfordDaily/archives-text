# Defense of Oppression
## Who Is More Human? 
### Brad Cornel 
During a discussion in the
coffee house after his sermon, Dr.
Coffin, Chaplain at Yale, stated
that "Among other things, it is
oppression which dehumanizes us.
If one man violated another's
integrity, infringes on his right to
develop his human capacities,
both the oppressor and the
oppressed become dehumanized."
That evening, during a lecture on
Woman's Liberation, psychology
professor Philip Zimbardo
reiterated the same idea.
Such a coincidence is not
unexpected, for the notion that
oppression leads to
dehumanization is a tenet which
goes unquestioned by the right as
well as the various factions of the

left. Still it is not beyond
suspicion.
If oppression is responsible for
dehumanization, then it would
follow that the greater the degree
of oppression the greater the
degree of dehumanization.
Accordingly one would be forced
to conclude that the black slaves
of the pre-Civil War South were
somehow "less human" than are
the reform minded students of
today.
There is a temptation, of
course, to attempt to avoid this
and similar unsettling implications
by claiming that even the most
active reformers are still
oppressors due to their
participation in American society

and thus are a part of the
oppressor-oppressed dicotomy.
Yet could these reformers be
considered more fully implicated
in that dicotomy than the slaves
themselves? It hardly seems likely.
Those who accept the idea ths'
oppression produces
dehumanization must also accept
the implications of that notion:
namely that oppressed people are
somehow "less human" than
those who live in egalitarian
societies.
I doubt, however, that man' 1
would be willing to accept such
implications not only because
they are probably false but
because they are also strangely
paternalistic, perhaps even racist.
Aside from the fact that the
view that oppression leads to
dehumanization has unpleasam
implications, there is no
anthropological data to support
the claim. Vigorous civilizations,
our own included, have often
been based on oppressive social
relations.
Why, then, has this view been
so widely accepted? Perhaps it if
because we so badly want to
believe it. We want to be
convinced that it is only in an
egalitarian community based on
love rather than in a hierarchial
society based on avarice that man
can find true fulfillment. We cling
to the hope that a world withou'
societal prejudice, a world in
which man did not struggle
against himself for power or
sexual staisfaction would be bliss
rather than a vapid, lethargic sort
of hell. In short we desire to
define our humanity in terms
which will allow us to incorporate
our traditional Christain
humanism and confidence in
democracy.
Still I sense that our resolve is
weakening. The very fact that we
are constantly displaying and
lauding our humanism is the
surest sign that we have already
begun to doubt it. We are no
longer positive about what
constitutes our humanity. Indeed
can we even be sure that it is not
"liberation" but oppression by
others, by nature, or by our own
abstractions which brings forth in
us the "truly human?"
