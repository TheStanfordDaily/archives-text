# Notes From Bolivie
## Acid And Me 
### Hugh J. McCarten 
A few years ago, during the
Great Handkerchief Shortage, it
was suggested in the Bolivian
House of Representatives by the
Mayor of New York (at that time
Faye Dunaway, or someone who
looked a lot like her) that a youth
ought not to be considered a man
(and by "a man" it was meant
someone who paid telephone
bills) until he had successfully
dropped LSD or "acid;" and that
the basic rights of Bolivian
manhood â€”voting, miniature golf,
etc. - ought to be witheld until a
bona fide acid trip had taken
place.
Initially, there was some
confusion as to what constituted a
legitimate trip, but after much
pushing and shoving, the Congress
decided that any trip which
excluded Philadelphia and Los
Angeles from its itinerary was
more than adequate, if not
downright exciting.
Today in Bolivia, the acid trip
is accepted by all but a few
shut-ins as a fully accredited form
of initiation into adult society,
much like losing one's youth-fare
card or drinking one's first

Diet-Pepsi. And having faultlessly
accomplished these last-named
feats, I recently embarked on my
own inner-cerebral journey, an
account of which careful readers
will find hidden somewhere in this
column.
My Firsl Acid Trip
The first time I dropped, I
didn't come on for about two
months, give or take a month, but
I was happy to have a free time,
and during the interim I did my
income tax and finished a number
of memorable books, among them
Conquering Split Ends by
Grinspoon. And then one day as I
was driving to Trenton to visit my
Aunt Mary (she lived in Newark,
but I wasn't letting on) I began to
go out of my head with crazy
visions and just a touch of
monoxide poisoning. After several
days of this, I wondered aloud if I
would ever hurl the great
Bunderstone again! ("Hurling the
Bunderstone" is an old New
Jersey pastime which vaguely
resembles opening a checking
account.)
My Second Acid Trip
The second time I dropped, I

was much better emotionally
equipped to deal with the
psychedelic environment having
read the two great works on the
subject - Who Asked You? and
Midgets on the Loose. With the
new understanding these books
gave me, I felt my whole
consciousness expanding, and,
shortly after coming on, I began
to think I was somebody else.
At first, I thought I was Lassie,
and then Mr. Greenjeans, and
finally the St. Louis Cardinals.
This arrangement worked out fine
for a while, but about midway
through the season my lack of
bullpen strength became apparent
and I finished a dismal seventh on
the year, right behind the Phillies.
And now, after my two freaky
trips, I have outgrown all desire
for hallucinogens, even peanut
butter and bananas. I as adjusting
happily to my role in the adult
world and, in the words of
Senator Russell Long of
Louisiana, "I don't need to speed
or acid - I'm high enough on life
as it is!"
