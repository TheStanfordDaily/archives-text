Dushbak Exonerated
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have the distinct feeling that
the author of the letter describing
the drug dushbak was not a
"Concerned Student" but a
tennis-shoed old lady who
searches under her bed each night
for Commies. That DB is
dangerous is utterly ridiculous.
True, its high is better than pot.
True, it's easier to grow DB and,
true, it is relatively unknown. But
I know plenty of people who use
it and no one has ever told me of
bad effects. DB is just a cheaper,
easier way of getting high. From
what I understand, the cultivation
of DB did not begin in the LA
area, as concerned states, but up
in Oregon. There are patches of it
grown in the hills in this area, but
not on a large-scale basis. The high
schools have little access to it; the
peninsula colleges by far are the
most experienced in the use of
DB. There are some high school
students who use it, of course.
But it really isn't dangerous, even
though the cops will be handing
out twenty year sentences when
they find out more about it.

Palm Drive
Editor, THE DAILY:
Another incidence of violence
on Palm Drive! Would it be too
much to ask an institution of the
size and resources of Stanford
University to provide more
adequate lighting on principle
pedestrian paths? Or perhaps a
shuttle bus from the campus to
the S.P. Station?

Editor, THE DAILY:
It was with considerable
distress that I read Ned Groth's
attempt to discredit Professor
Eliassen and the environmental
engineer in general (Daily, Feb
4). With the complexity and
seriousness of the pollution
problem today, a common effort

by many people to improve the
situation is necessary. It is an
inconceivable that an ecologist
would be able to solve present
problems without the technology
of the environmental engineer as
it would be for the environmental
engineer to know exactly what
results should be achieved without
the aid of an ecologist. In fact,
many seemingly unrelated groups
are also needed in order to bring
about a solution. The best plans
of the ecologist and engineer are
worthless unless others are also
willing to realize that there is a
problem and do something about
it. To this end, every contribution
toward a better environment must
be used in the fight against
pollution.
It is unfortunate that Mr.
Groth is not familiar enough with
the field of environmental
engineering to correctly evaluate
it. He severly criticizes Professor
Eliassen's approach to burning
garbage and using the heat to
generate electricity by stating, "It
sounds like a good idea until you
realize that it would just convert
garbage into air pollution." Mr.
Groth is evidently unaware that
gas scrubbers and other control
devices are available to clean the
exhaust so that virtually no
pollutants are emitted.
Incineration plants equipped with
such scrubbers are presently being
constructed in the United States
to combat the serious problem of
solid waste disposal which is a
reality today.
Likewise, Mr. Groth' s
evaluation of Professor Eliassen's
statements on nuclear power
plants is unjust. Mr. Groth quoted
Professor Eliassen concerning
nuclear power plants, "When
placed carefully," and then
assumed that the additional power
plants needed for the Los Angeles
area would be located there, the
cooling water being dumped into
that area. Such plants might
actually be located many
hundreds of miles away. Today, in
fact, Southern California is using
electricity produced in the Pacific
Northwest and supplied through
the inter-tie power system. In the
event that dumping cooling water

into receiving waters is
unsatisfactory, a more expensive
system of cooling towers is also
possible. Again it is not a problem
of technological know-how, but
instead one of what people are
willing to pay for. In the long run
it is the people and not the
ecologists or enrivonmental
engineers that decide what must
be done. The environmental
engineer is merely trying to
remedy existing problems in a
very real world.
The major problem that exists
is one of overpopulation. Most
causes of pollution can be related
to production of goods for the
great mass of people. As long as
the birthrate continues to climb,
the pollution problem will
continue. It is neither the
ecologists nor the environmental
engineers, but the masses of
people themselves that have to
solve this problem. As a result I
say, the more on the bandwagon
the better.

Perplexed
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm perplexed. Last year,
Stanford radicals and others were
enraged because "The Trustees
wouldn't listen to us when we
voted against separating SRI from
the University."
This year, the radicals are
upset because the Senate has
come out in favor of limited
credit for ROTC.

But didn't the student bodj
vote in a general election in favor
of retaining ROTC with credit?
How can the radicals so
conveniently ignore one vote
while capitalizing so much on the
other? Can it possible be that the
only time votes count is when
they are on your side? Can it b r
that the wishes of "the people 1
are important only when they
coincide with the goals of the
radicals?
What do you say to that,
Professor Franklin?

Bert rand Russell
Editor, THE DAILY:
The passing of Bertrand
Russell is doubly sad.
First, we are reminded that
humankind is only occasionally
blessed with the appearance of
that rare species called geniu
Russell's superb contributions to
mathematics, philosophy, social
and political thought illuminated
many dark recesses into which
man's knowledge and spirit had
been thrust by centuries of
prejedice and ignorance. His lucid
writing, penetrating wit, ar,_
expansive love of humanity make
his books inspiring, enlightening,
and a joy to read.
Second, we can only view with
dismay the relative indifference
with which Russell's death has
been reported in the media. The
terse announcements and sketch
descriptions of his enormous
services to civilization are
revealing of our misplaced
priorities. Just compare the
consistently thorough coverage of
the demise of faded politicians
and childhood screenstars, with
attendant convulsions of publ. .
sorrow. But history obscures the
insignificant and redeems the best
men who walk this planet. Long
after the petty nobodies of our
celebrity-studded society are
forgotten, the name and works of
Bertrand Russell will shine
through the ages.
