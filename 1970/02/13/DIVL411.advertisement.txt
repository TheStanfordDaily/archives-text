When was the last time you saw Mt. Diablo?
4/22.
There was once a wicked old witch who lived
isolated in the Enchanted Forest. Oooh!
She was terribly ugly. She had seven warts
piled right on top one another on the tip of
her nose. God ahead, count them — one,
two, three, four, live, six, seven. There!
Well one day she was walking through the |
forest and a whimpy dwarf jumped out
from under a mushroom and began nibbling
at her shin. In pain and fury she (the
witch) reached down, grabbing the dwarf
by the back of his neck, and picked him up.
Eyes twinkling, our witch leaned in very
close to the elf, bared her sharp teeth and
yelled, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY TIM,
CLARK."
TIM WHITE
wishes
TIM CLARK
a Happy Birthday.
BIG DEAL
Happy Uinlnlav, Randy. Love, Kay,
Leda likes Tim Clark, too.
