# Faculty Will Review ROTC; Pitzer Rejects Open Forum
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
President Kenneth Pitzer has
rejected a request for an open
community forum on ROTC, but
the entire faculty will review last
month's Academic Senate
decision.
In a seven-page letter released
yesterday to the Stanford
Community (printed in full
below), Pitzer denied that he had
acted with "haste and secrecy" in
dealing with the ROTC question.
After outlining the history of
decisions affecting ROTC on the
Stanford campus he said, "In view
of the extensive discussion which
preceded the Senate vote and the
opportunity for further debate
and deliberation in the event of its
review by the entire Academic
Council, I believe no constructive
purpose would be served by
calling a separate meeting on this
issue at this time."
Also yesterday, a petition was
submitted by Professor Harold
Kahn, history, signed by many
more than the required 50
members of the Academic Council
asking for a special meeting of
that group to review the
Academic Senate decision on
ROTC. Prof. Kahn claimed that
146 faculty members had signed
the petition although Donald
Winbigler, academic secretary to
the University, has not yet
verified that number.
Another petition was also
submitted by 28 members of the
Academic Senate proposing that a
mail ballot be submitted to the
faculty asking for approval or
rejection of the Senate's decision.
This group of faculty members,
composed of some in favor of the
Senate's action and others
opposed, wants the special
Council meeting to concentrate
on discussing ROTC rather than
haggling over procedures.
Restore Decision
The petition circulated by
Kahn asks for a special Council
meeting to consider the decision
of the Academic Senate and "at
the very minimum restore the
prior decisions of the Academic
Council and Senate, announced in
1969, with respect to ROTC at
Stanford."
Three weeks ago the Academic
Senate voted to allow Army
ROTC to grant limited credit to

ROTC courses, subject to
approval of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, on a
one-year trial basis. A year ago the
Senate voted to deny credit to
ROTC courses after a general
phase-out to be completed in
1973.
A Council meeting of all
faculty members of the rank of
assistant professor and higher
must be held within four weeks
since there is not a regularly
scheduled meeting before April.
Kahn asked Winbigler to call a
meeting "before or no later than
March 5 so as to avoid the
prospect of the Council convening
itself during Dead Week."
Not During Dead Week
Kahn feels the event is of such
importance that any action should
be conveyed to the Stanford
community by the news media
which is not possible during Dead
Week ( the Daily does not publish
during Dear Week).
Winbigler did not know
yesterday when the meeting
would be held.
The two petitions assure that
the whole matter of ROTC and
the possibility of having a mail
referendum of the faculty on it
will be discussed at the Council
meeting. According to Winbigler,
"anything regarding ROTC will be
up for discussion at the meeting."
Any Action Possible
The Council could take any
action on the matter it deems
proper although it is unlikely that
it will do more than reject or
reaffirm the Senate's decision.
The Pitzer letter was in
response to requests of February
5, by the New Moratorium, the
Student Mobilization Committee,
the SDS, and the New University
Conference to have an open
forum on ROTC. In a letter to
Pitzer, the groups said "many
members of the community are
confused about ROTC and its
place on the campus." They cited
"widespread public concern with
the presence of ROTC at
Stanford" in asking for the forum.
Pitzer said, "I believe that a
review of the recent history of
decisions affecting ROTC on this
campus will show that I have not
acted arbitrarily, with undue
haste, or without advice from the
faculty and students."

February 12, 1970
To the Stanford Community:
I have received a letter bearing the
names of the New Moratorium, the
Student Mobilization Committee,
Students for a Democratic Society, and
the New University Conference as
signators. It deals with ROTC at
Stanford, charges me with "haste and
secrecy" in referring recommendations
of the Advisory Committee on ROTC
Affairs to the Faculty Senate, and
requests a "community forum" on the
subject. Because the letter carried no
personal signatures and first appeared
in the Daily, I am addressing this reply
to the community in general so that
the same audience may have my full
response.
I believe that a review of the recent
history of decisions affecting ROTC on
this campus will show that I have not
acted arbitrarily, with undue haste, or
without advice from the faculty and
students.
There have been numerous events
and discussions over the past year and
a half, nearly all of which have been
reported in full or in summary form.
Informal talks and organized panel
presentations on ROTC took place
early in the fall of 1968. These
culminated in a report by ten members
of the Academic Council entitled
"ROTC at Stanford: A Faculty
Proposal."
This was followed by the creation
of an ad hoc Committee on ROTC by
the Faculty Senate on Sept. 26, 1968.
In creating the Committee, the Senate
resolved that "the ROTC program
should be altered, but that proper
relations between the ROTC
departments and Stanford may be
established by review and reform of
the present relations."
On Jan. 16, 1969, the Senate
Committee held an open hearing,
"ROTC and the University/' The
meeting consisted almost entirely of
statements offered from the floor by
those interested in the subject.
On Feb. 7, the Senate received the
report of the Committee on ROTC.
The full reports of the majority and
minority recommendations were

published as a Campus Report
Supplement on Feb. 11. The majority
report recommended an end to
academic credit for regular ROTC
courses. It also recommended the
adoption of volutnary status for
military training programs in the
University; it did not recommend the
abolition of ROTC at Stanford.
On Feb. 13, the Faculty Senate
endorsed six of the eight majority
recommendations of its Committee on
ROTC by a vote of 25 to 8, including
the proposal that no academic credit
be given for participation in programs
of military training and education. It
called for further committee study of
recommendations that ROTC be
changed to an extracurricular activity,
an action which later led to the
formation of the Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs.
In an ASSU referendum on Feb.
24, studfents voted 2,106 to 1,387 that
" . ROTC has a legitimate place on
the campus and deserves support and
credit from the University for all those
parts of the program that are of
genuine academic interest."
On March 11, the University Board
of Trustees adopted a resolution
concerning ROTC in which it urged
"the President of the University to
continue his consultation with the
Department of Defense, leading to
appropriate actions which will improve
and vitalize this important program."
The full text of the Trustee's
resolution was published in the
Campus Report March 19.
On April 4, the Academic Council
debated the Faculty Senate's Feb. 13
ROTC decision. At the conclusion of
its discussions, the Council voted 249
to 139 for a mail ballot of the full
Academic Councih
To encourage any member of the
faculty who wished to do so to place
his arguments, pro or con, on the
ROTC matter before his colleagues, a
special Campus Report Supplement for
this purpose was announced and the
presentations received were published
on April 22.
On April 30, the mail balloting of
the members of the Academic Council
approved the Senate's ROTC decision
by a vote of 403 to 356.
On June 6, I appointed the
President's Advisory Committee on
ROTC Affairs, with the responsibility,
among others, for advising on revisions
of ROTC agreements with the
Department of Defense. The three
student and five faculty members were
nominated, respectively, by the ASSU
and the faculty nomination
committees.
On Oct. 22, a proposal for the
revision of the Army ROTC program
was submitted by Colonel Ramey to
the University. I forwarded the
proposal to the Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs on Oct. 30, 1969.
The recommendations of the
Advisory Committee on ROTC were
outlined at the Academic Council
meeting of Jan. 9, 1970, by the
Chairman of the Faculty Senate,
Professor Clebsch, and reported on the
front page of the Daily on Jan. 12.
Professor Clebsch noted that the
Senate was expected to consider the
report at its Jan. 22 meeting, and urged
members of the Council to make their
opinions known to their Senate
representatives. His address to the
Council was reprinted in full in the
Campus Report Supplement of Jan.
15.
The official report of the
Committee was sent to me on Jan. 12,
and I transmitted it with a covering
letter summarizing my response to it to
the Steering Committee of the Senate
on Jan. 16. Copies of this
correspondence, newspaper
advertisements and other background
material were sent on Monday, Jan. 19
to members of the Senate, to students
(including representatives of ASSU and
the student Senate), and to the campus
news media (The Daily, KZSU and
Campus Report) whose representatives
attend the Senate meetings. The Daily
featured extensive news coverage of
the major recommendations on Jan. 20
and a criticism of them the next day.
On Jan. 22, the Faculty Senate,
after extensive debate, voted 23 to 13
to approve on a one-year basis the plan
endorsed by the Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs under which Army
ROTC courses could qualify for
limited academic credit through the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies;
to eliminate faculty rank for
instructors; and to create a Center for
Military Studies in place of the
Department of Military Science.
Faculty and students from the ROTC
Committee participated in the debate,
which was transmitted live to Bishop
Auditorium to an audience of students
and faculty. The report of the
Advisory Committee on ROTC Affairs
and my memorandum transmitting it

to the Faculty Senate were also
published in full in the Jan. 28 Campus
Report.
At a press conference in my office
on Jan. 27, the ROTC matter was one
of the subjects considered and freely
discussed. My comments were
summarized in the local press and in
the Campus Report of Feb. 4.
As the chronology indicates, the
question of ROTC at Stanford has
been discussed on numerous occasions
and in numerous forms, ranging from
meetings of the Faculty Senate and the
Academic Council—where jurisdiction
in such matters as academic credit
properly resides-to a student body
referendum. These discussions and
actions provide a background for the
current recommendations now being
considered by the faculty.
As already noted, the Senate on
Feb. 13 adopted six of eight
recommendations from the majority
report of its ad hoc Committee on
ROTC and referred two other
recommendations to a committee to be
established subsequently.
Recommendation Six stated that
"University authorities should
promptly initiate action leading to
revision or termination of the contracts
between Stanford and the armed
forces . ..." On my instructions. Vice
Provost Brooks began negotiations
with the three services for revision of
the contracts to bring ROTC as closely
as possible into conformance with the
recommendations of the Senate. In
keeping with this resolution I also
appointed the Advisory Committee on
ROTC Affairs, as already noted.
This Committee spent two months
considering the Army proposal
submitted by Colonel Ramey. After
this extended discussion the
Committee recommended, by a six to
two vote, that I accept the Army
proposal with minor changes (which
were made) and subject to obtaining
the "advice and consent of the Senate
on the proposal for granting of
academic credit on a course-by-course
basis in accordance with the
procedures and standards of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies."
In accordance with the
Committee's recommendation, I
therefore requested the Steering
Committee of the Senate to place this
question prominently on the Agenda
for the Jan. 22 meeting. This was
necessary so that the three services
would know whether or not they could
enroll scholarship students in the
coming Autumn Quarter, and so that
the students could apply for these
programs if they wished. It was also
intended to provide ample time for full
consideration of the issue. As I have
publicly stated, no contracts will be
signed with the Army while a potential

review of the Senate's decision on
academic credit remains pending.
My own position on ROTC has
been made clear on numerous
occasions: I share the deep concern
expressed by many faculty and
students about the need for revision of
individual student contracts with the
military services, and intend to work
for such change through Congressional
action. In other respects, I find the
Army proposal reasonable and
acceptable, and very close indeed to
the recommendations adopted by the
Faculty Senate a year ago.
The position of ROTC on campus
will be substantially altered under the
Army proposal. In abolishing faculty
rank and Academic Council
membership for ROTC instructors, the
Army proposal meets one of the
primary objections voiced to this
program a year ago. In contrast to the
27 units of credit now possible for
military-taught courses, the Army has
agreed to submit course proposals up
to a combined total not to exceed nine
units to the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. This group
already has the responsibility for
determining whether special,
non-departmental courses may receive
credit; ROTC courses would receive
the same scrutiny. The Army has
agreed to be judged by the same
standards and to abide by the
committee's decision. There is, in
short, no guarantee that any course
will receive any credit.
The only remaining central issue is
the question of whether or not Army
ROTC shall have an opportunity to
submit course proposals which may
qualify for limited academic credit on
the same basis as other special,
non-departmental programs. This
question properly remains within the
faculty's jurisdiction. The Faculty
Senate and the Academic Council are
the appropriate decision-making
bodies.
In view of the extensive discussion
which preceded the Senate vote and
the opportunity for further debate and
deliberation in the event of its review
by the entire Academic Council, I
believe no constructive purpose would
be served by calling a separate meeting
on this issue at this time.
