## Mitchell's Journalists

WASH INGTON—Atty. Gen.
John Mitchell backtracked slightly
last week in the Justice
Department's desire to use TV,
magazine and newspaper reporters
as deputies in the fight against
crime. Before the attorney
general's statement, the Justice
Department was handing out
blanket subpoenas demanding
that the networks, TV stations,
magazines and newspapers turn
over their unused film,
photographs and even newspaper
reporters' notebooks to be used as
evidence in court.
While the news media feel
threatened by such a policy, I
don't know one reporter or
commentator who wouldn't enjoy
being an informer or a stool
pigeon.
I can see the day when the
news media would serve two
masters with pride as well as
efficiency.
"Hello, Jordan, Kelly here.
There's been a bank robbery at
Fifth and Maple. Three masked
men got away with $500,000."
"Great, Kelly, give me the
facts."
"I don't have them."
"What do you mean you don't
have them?"
"The cops subpoenaed my
notebook."
"Well, just tell me what
happened."
"I can't. The FBI said I
couldn't talk about the case."
"Look, Kelly, I didn't send
you out to cover a story so you'd
keep your mouth shut. This is
news."
"I told that to the deputy
attorney general, but he said when
three people are kidnaped in a
bank robbery, my first obligation
is to the courts."
Three people were
kidnaped?"
"I wasn't supposed to tell you
that. If you print it, I'll be held in
contempt."
"Good grief, Kelly, your
loyalties are to the paper. What
happened?"
"It's no good, Jordan. Even if
I told you the bank manager's
wife's boyfriend is believed to
have engineered the robbery, I'd
be in dutch."
"The boyfriend of the bank
manager's wife?"
"Yah. Jerry got a great photo
of him coming out of the bank
with the money in one hand and
the wife of the bank manager on
his other arm. They escaped on
top of a Greyhound bus."
"Jerry got a picture of that?"
"A sequence of pictures."
"Where are the photos?"
"The cops took them as
evidence. They also arrested Jerry
for being at the scene of a crime. I
would have gone to his aid, but I
heard over the police radio that
the Greyhound bus had been
stopped at a roadblock, so I
rushed over there just as the cops
were climbing on the bus to make
the arrests."
"They got the people who
heisted the bank?"
"Can't tell you that."
"Kelly, please, Kelly. We go to
press in an hour. Were they
arrested?"

"I'm not at liberty to divulge
any facts other than to say that
the explosions I heard going on
for over an hour did not come
from the exhaust pipe of the
bus."
"For God's sake, Kelly, give
me anything—the name of the
bank—anything."
"I'm sorry, Jordan, I probably
should not even have called in."
"Where the devil are you?"
"Down here at the Justice
Department. They let me make
one phone call."
"Have you been arrested,
too?"
"Not exactly, but the Justice
Department said that without
influencing what I wrote they
were holding me as a material
witness until the final edition of
our paper hits the stand."
"I'll get you out, Kelly."
"I might as well stay here. I
have to testify in the Morgan
hijacking case that I covered for
you last week."

couldn't talk about the case."
"Look, Kelly, I didn't send
you out to cover a story so you'd
keep your mouth shut. This is
news."
"I told that to the deputy
attorney general, but he said when
three people are kidnaped in a
bank robbery, my first obligation
is to the courts."
Three people were
kidnaped?"
"I wasn't supposed to tell you
that. If you print it, I'll be held in
contempt."
"Good grief, Kelly, your
loyalties are to the paper. What
happened?"
"It's no good, Jordan. Even if
I told you the bank manager's
wife's boyfriend is believed to
have engineered the robbery, I'd
be in dutch."
"The boyfriend of the bank
manager's wife?"
"Yah. Jerry got a great photo
of him coming out of the bank
with the money in one hand and
the wife of the bank manager on
his other arm. They escaped on
top of a Greyhound bus."
"Jerry got a picture of that?"
"A sequence of pictures."
"Where are the photos?"
"The cops took them as
evidence. They also arrested Jerry
for being at the scene of a crime. I
would have gone to his aid, but I
heard over the police radio that
the Greyhound bus had been
stopped at a roadblock, so I
rushed over there just as the cops
were climbing on the bus to make
the arrests."
"They got the people who
heisted the bank?"
"Can't tell you that."
"Kelly, please, Kelly. We go to
press in an hour. Were they
arrested?"

"I'm not at liberty to divulge
any facts other than to say that
the explosions I heard going on
for over an hour did not come
from the exhaust pipe of the
bus."
"For God's sake, Kelly, give
me anything—the name of the
bank—anything."
"I'm sorry, Jordan, I probably
should not even have called in."
"Where the devil are you?"
"Down here at the Justice
Department. They let me make
one phone call."
"Have you been arrested,
too?"
"Not exactly, but the Justice
Department said that without
influencing what I wrote they
were holding me as a material
witness until the final edition of
our paper hits the stand."
"I'll get you out, Kelly."
"I might as well stay here. I
have to testify in the Morgan
hijacking case that I covered for
you last week."
WASH INGTON—Atty. Gen.
John Mitchell backtracked slightly
last week in the Justice
Department's desire to use TV,
magazine and newspaper reporters
as deputies in the fight against
crime. Before the attorney
general's statement, the Justice
Department was handing out
blanket subpoenas demanding
that the networks, TV stations,
magazines and newspapers turn
over their unused film,
photographs and even newspaper
reporters' notebooks to be used as
evidence in court.
While the news media feel
threatened by such a policy, I
don't know one reporter or
commentator who wouldn't enjoy
being an informer or a stool
pigeon.
I can see the day when the
news media would serve two
masters with pride as well as
efficiency.
"Hello, Jordan, Kelly here.
There's been a bank robbery at
Fifth and Maple. Three masked
men got away with $500,000."
"Great, Kelly, give me the
facts."
"I don't have them."
"What do you mean you don't
have them?"
"The cops subpoenaed my
notebook."
"Well, just tell me what
happened."
"I can't. The FBI said I
couldn't talk about the case."
"Look, Kelly, I didn't send
you out to cover a story so you'd
