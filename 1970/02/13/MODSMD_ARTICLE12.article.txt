I. Law Students Clarify
Editor, THE DAILY:
Student Financial Manager
David Swift's statement before
the Student Senate, to the effect
that the Law Association does not
have an off-campus bank account,
is incorrect. The Law Association
does maintain a petty cash
checking account for the sole
purpose of making frequent minor
payments connected with its
academic and social activities.
Since September, the balance in
this account has not ever been as
much as $150.00. The vast
majority of Law Association
income and expenditures continue
to be channeled through the
ASSU office, However, it would
be grossly inconvenient for the
Association to conduct very
minor day-to-day affairs through
the ASSU office; it is only to
avoid this sort of inconvenience
that the account exists.
It has been, and continues to
be, the judgment of the Law
Association that such an account,
given its limited purpose, does not
contravene any rational policy
which may be embodied in the
ASSU regulat ions on bank
accounts generally.
One final point: neither the
Law Association's ASSU account
nor its off-campus account is used
by the Law Association Lounge.
The Lounge managers keep their
own books and have their own
entirely separate account at the
ASSU. The Lounge does not now,
nor has it ever, had an off-campus
account of its own.

The article by Ned Groth

entitled "Ecologists in Name
Only" disturbed me enough to
cause at least some comment on
the emphasis of his remarks. I can
only agree that environmental
engineers are not ecologists, and
that ecologists, human biologists,
etc. are and will be needed in
taking major roles in decision
making processes of the future. It
is, however, inconceivable to me
to place the blame for our
environmental crisis completely
on the shoulders of the
corporations or the government.
The reality that our country's
businesses play the game of
supply and demand for profit is
nothing new, but it is the people
who set the demands, not the
corporations or government. If it
is true • and it does appear to be
so that our priorities are to "rape
the earth, for profit", then it is
necessary to insititute a new value
system for everyone, not just the
corporations or the government.
Finally, to state that"Eliassen's
suggestions for "solutions" are
designed primarily "to make the
rape more efficient" is not only
misleading, but if followed to the
conclusion of disregarding the
technical advice of men like
Eliassen, it will be disastrous. The
environmental problems that face
this country, in fact this world,
can be solved only if all branches
of the sciences recognize and
cooperate in fulfilling their social
responsibilities.

claims that Marxist-Leninists have
always put forth the thesis that all

nationalism is reactionary. Banac
quotes Lenin as partial proof:
"The whole task of the
proletarians in the national
question is 'impractical' from the
standpoint of the nationalist
bourgeoisie of every nation,
because, being opposed to all
nationalism, the proletarians
demand 'abstract' equality, they
demand that on principle there
shall be no privileges, however
slight."
Banac may have lifted Lenin's
words from PLP literature: it is
evident that he did not examine
their context, because they are
from"The Right of Nations to
Self-Determination," a polemic
directed against Rosa
Luxemburg's view that all
nationalism is reactionary.
(Collected Works, Vol. 20, p.
411). In the disputation Lenin
attacked Rosa Luxemburg for her
rejection of the part of the
Russian Marxist party program
which advanced the right of
secession to oppressed nations.
"The bourgeois nationalism of
any oppressed nation has a general
democratic content that is
directed against oppression,"
Lenin wrote, "and it is this
content that we unconditionally
support" (Ibid., p. 412).
Lenin believed that Rosa
Luxemburg's desire not to assist
the nationalist bourgeoisie of the
oppressed nation in fact assisted
the bourgeoisie, the landlords and
the bureaucrats of the oppressor
nation. Critics of the Progressive
Labor Party position believe that
the categorical condemnation of
all nationalism in fact assists the
American oppression of the
Vietnamese nation.

quotes Lenin as partial proof:
"The whole task of the
proletarians in the national

bourgeoisie of every nation,
because, being opposed to all
nationalism, the proletarians
demand 'abstract' equality, they
demand that on principle there

slight."
Banac may have lifted Lenin's

from"The Right of Nations to

directed against Rosa
Luxemburg's view that all
nationalism is reactionary.
(Collected Works, Vol. 20, p.
411). In the disputation Lenin
attacked Rosa Luxemburg for her
rejection of the part of the
Russian Marxist party program
which advanced the right of
secession to oppressed nations.
"The bourgeois nationalism of
any oppressed nation has a general
democratic content that is
directed against oppression,"
Lenin wrote, "and it is this
content that we unconditionally
support" (Ibid., p. 412).
Lenin believed that Rosa
Luxemburg's desire not to assist
the nationalist bourgeoisie of the

the bourgeoisie, the landlords and
the bureaucrats of the oppressor
nation. Critics of the Progressive

the categorical condemnation of
all nationalism in fact assists the

David Swift's statement before
the Student Senate, to the effect
that the Law Association does not
have an off-campus bank account,
is incorrect. The Law Association
does maintain a petty cash
checking account for the sole
purpose of making frequent minor
payments connected with its
academic and social activities.
Since September, the balance in
this account has not ever been as
much as $150.00. The vast
majority of Law Association
income and expenditures continue
to be channeled through the
ASSU office, However, it would
be grossly inconvenient for the
Association to conduct very
minor day-to-day affairs through
the ASSU office; it is only to
avoid this sort of inconvenience
that the account exists.
It has been, and continues to
be, the judgment of the Law
Association that such an account,
given its limited purpose, does not
contravene any rational policy
which may be embodied in the
ASSU regulat ions on bank
accounts generally.
One final point: neither the

I. Law Students Clarify
Editor, THE DAILY:
Student Financial Manager
David Swift's statement before
the Student Senate, to the effect
that the Law Association does not
have an off-campus bank account,
is incorrect. The Law Association
does maintain a petty cash
checking account for the sole
purpose of making frequent minor
payments connected with its
academic and social activities.
Since September, the balance in
this account has not ever been as
much as $150.00. The vast
majority of Law Association
income and expenditures continue
to be channeled through the
ASSU office, However, it would
be grossly inconvenient for the
Association to conduct very
minor day-to-day affairs through
the ASSU office; it is only to
avoid this sort of inconvenience
that the account exists.
It has been, and continues to
be, the judgment of the Law
Association that such an account,
given its limited purpose, does not
contravene any rational policy
which may be embodied in the
ASSU regulat ions on bank
accounts generally.
One final point: neither the
Law Association's ASSU account
nor its off-campus account is used
by the Law Association Lounge.
The Lounge managers keep their
own books and have their own
entirely separate account at the
ASSU. The Lounge does not now,
nor has it ever, had an off-campus
account of its own.

The article by Ned Groth

entitled "Ecologists in Name
Only" disturbed me enough to
cause at least some comment on
the emphasis of his remarks. I can
only agree that environmental
engineers are not ecologists, and
that ecologists, human biologists,
etc. are and will be needed in
taking major roles in decision
making processes of the future. It
is, however, inconceivable to me
to place the blame for our
environmental crisis completely
on the shoulders of the
corporations or the government.
The reality that our country's
businesses play the game of
supply and demand for profit is
nothing new, but it is the people
who set the demands, not the
corporations or government. If it
is true • and it does appear to be
so that our priorities are to "rape
the earth, for profit", then it is
necessary to insititute a new value
system for everyone, not just the
corporations or the government.
Finally, to state that"Eliassen's
suggestions for "solutions" are
designed primarily "to make the
rape more efficient" is not only
misleading, but if followed to the
conclusion of disregarding the
technical advice of men like
Eliassen, it will be disastrous. The
environmental problems that face
this country, in fact this world,
can be solved only if all branches
of the sciences recognize and
cooperate in fulfilling their social
responsibilities.

claims that Marxist-Leninists have
always put forth the thesis that all

nationalism is reactionary. Banac
quotes Lenin as partial proof:
"The whole task of the
proletarians in the national
question is 'impractical' from the
standpoint of the nationalist
bourgeoisie of every nation,
because, being opposed to all
nationalism, the proletarians
demand 'abstract' equality, they
demand that on principle there
shall be no privileges, however
slight."
Banac may have lifted Lenin's
words from PLP literature: it is
evident that he did not examine
their context, because they are
from"The Right of Nations to
Self-Determination," a polemic
directed against Rosa
Luxemburg's view that all
nationalism is reactionary.
(Collected Works, Vol. 20, p.
411). In the disputation Lenin
attacked Rosa Luxemburg for her
rejection of the part of the
Russian Marxist party program
which advanced the right of
secession to oppressed nations.
"The bourgeois nationalism of
any oppressed nation has a general
democratic content that is
directed against oppression,"
Lenin wrote, "and it is this
content that we unconditionally
support" (Ibid., p. 412).
Lenin believed that Rosa
Luxemburg's desire not to assist
the nationalist bourgeoisie of the
oppressed nation in fact assisted
the bourgeoisie, the landlords and
the bureaucrats of the oppressor
nation. Critics of the Progressive
Labor Party position believe that
the categorical condemnation of
all nationalism in fact assists the
American oppression of the
Vietnamese nation.
