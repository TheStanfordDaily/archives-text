# Mutual Buck-passing
## The 						Overpopulation Problem 
### Joshua Lederberg 
In the Nov. 29 issue of
Science, Beryl L. Crowe, who
teaches political science at Oregon
State University, Corvallis,
describes; the game of mutual
buck-passing that we all play, but
especially the social as against the
natural scientists.
Serious problems will remain
unsolved "so long as the social
sciences continue to defer the
most critical problems that face
mankind to future technical
advances, while the natural
sciences continue to defer those
same problems which are about to
overwhelm all mankind to false
expectations in the political
realm."
In the same issue, John R.
Piatt, a well known biophysicist
who is now associate director of
the Mental Health Research
Institute at the University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, exhorts
scientists about "What We Must
Do". After a gloomy inventory
and classification of national and
world problems in relation to
their gravity, he calls for a
mobilization of scientific task
forces for highly coordinated,
large scale work on the major
issues.
(The Manhattan Project is
inevitably thought of as a parallel
- it may be naughty to recall that
it was rationally founded on a
premise later proven false, namely
that Hitler was racing to produce
a Nazi superweapon.)
Non-Problem Solved
In other words, a mobilization
had generated a magnificent
technical solution to a
non-problem, and has, in turn,

changed world history in ways we
have still to fathom.)
By far the most interesting
part of Prof. Piatt's essay is, by
coincidence, a rebuttal to Prof.
Crowe in the form of a list of
social inventions. They include
Keynesian economics, opinion
polls, operations analysis, game
theory, input-output economics,
credit cards, and income tax
withholding. Some remarks about
these might be unprintable, but
they can indeed have a large,
quick impact.
Overpopulation is near the top
of anyone's list of social
problems. However optimistically
we dispense with other aspects of
it, we cannot evade its pressure on
an irreplaceable natural heritage
and the accumulation of our
garbage and other pollutants.
However, American couples
(as shown by demographer Judith
Blake at Berkeley, typically still
expect to produce between three
and four children for an ideal
family. We have found no humane
way to regulate this market, to
restrain a couple from hogging
more than its fair share of the
common resource - human living
space on the planet. We begin to
hear demands for a radical
solution, and before these are
irresistibly, we should seek and
try new social inventions, do not
want a solution at the cost of a
nightmarish secret service of
genetic and demographic police.
Compounded Difficulties
Our difficulties are
compounded by a pattern of
social injustice that leaves an
underprivileged class that believes

it has nothing to lose, so why not
breed more. Widespread poverty
also turns any hypothetical
punishment of irresponsible
parents into penalties on innocent
children.
Senator George S. McGovern's
recent proposal for a universal
family allowance based on $50 a
month per child suggests a
constructive approach to a
meaningful but compassionate
social experiment. It was
promptly and I believe correctly,
criticized on the floor of the
House by Representative John B.
Anderson (R., III.) as an
aggravating stimulus to population
growth, an irresponsible birth
incentive. It is also totally
unrealistic to expect an
appropriation of $35 billion for a
program tainted by the thought
that it might help the poor to
continue to outbreed the rich.
We have surprisingly little
information to support guesses
about the impact of children's
allowances on population growth.
Canada's birth rates have tended
to fluctuate in close parallel with
the U.S. in response to major
economic and social trends,
regardless of a long history of
such allowances in Canada.
Senator McGovern's proposal
should be amended so to start
with allowances only for the first
two children of a given mother. It
might also make the same
allowance to a married woman
before and after her first child, so
as not to hasten child-bearing.
Routine Statistics
Statistics on births by
birth-order are already routinely
collected on a large scale, and it
would not take long to determine
whether this approach to a
guaranteed income base could
have a significant effect on family
policy. If it did, we should soon
count relatively fewer third and
fourth births compared to second.
Programs like this are not as
expensive as they appear at first
sight. We really do not mean to
turn our backs on the welfare of
the young and by one route or
another we must provide essential
services and food to needy
chidlren. The McGovern proposal,
with the suggested amendment,
carries the possibility of managing
the limitations in our resources to
help experiment with solutions to
the "incidental" problem of
over breeding.
At the very least, a considered
debate on these proposals would
expose the realities of our needs
and pretensions in designing a
future with a manageable
population.

By far the most interesting
part of Prof. Piatt's essay is, by
coincidence, a rebuttal to Prof.
Crowe in the form of a list of
social inventions. They include
Keynesian economics, opinion
polls, operations analysis, game
theory, input-output economics,
credit cards, and income tax
withholding. Some remarks about
these might be unprintable, but
they can indeed have a large,
quick impact.
Overpopulation is near the top
of anyone's list of social
problems. However optimistically
we dispense with other aspects of
it, we cannot evade its pressure on
an irreplaceable natural heritage
and the accumulation of our
garbage and other pollutants.
However, American couples
(as shown by demographer Judith
Blake at Berkeley, typically still
expect to produce between three
and four children for an ideal
family. We have found no humane
way to regulate this market, to
restrain a couple from hogging
more than its fair share of the
common resource - human living
space on the planet. We begin to
hear demands for a radical
solution, and before these are
irresistibly, we should seek and
try new social inventions, do not
want a solution at the cost of a
nightmarish secret service of
genetic and demographic police.
Compounded Difficulties
Our difficulties are
compounded by a pattern of
social injustice that leaves an
underprivileged class that believes

it has nothing to lose, so why not
breed more. Widespread poverty
also turns any hypothetical
punishment of irresponsible
parents into penalties on innocent
children.
Senator George S. McGovern's
recent proposal for a universal
family allowance based on $50 a
month per child suggests a
constructive approach to a
meaningful but compassionate
social experiment. It was
promptly and I believe correctly,
criticized on the floor of the
House by Representative John B.
Anderson (R., III.) as an
aggravating stimulus to population
growth, an irresponsible birth
incentive. It is also totally
unrealistic to expect an
appropriation of $35 billion for a
program tainted by the thought
that it might help the poor to
continue to outbreed the rich.
We have surprisingly little
information to support guesses
about the impact of children's
allowances on population growth.
Canada's birth rates have tended
to fluctuate in close parallel with
the U.S. in response to major
economic and social trends,
regardless of a long history of
such allowances in Canada.
Senator McGovern's proposal
should be amended so to start
with allowances only for the first
two children of a given mother. It
might also make the same
allowance to a married woman
before and after her first child, so
as not to hasten child-bearing.
Routine Statistics
Statistics on births by
birth-order are already routinely
collected on a large scale, and it
would not take long to determine
whether this approach to a
guaranteed income base could
have a significant effect on family
policy. If it did, we should soon
count relatively fewer third and
fourth births compared to second.
Programs like this are not as
expensive as they appear at first
sight. We really do not mean to
turn our backs on the welfare of
the young and by one route or
another we must provide essential
services and food to needy
chidlren. The McGovern proposal,
with the suggested amendment,
carries the possibility of managing
the limitations in our resources to
help experiment with solutions to
the "incidental" problem of
over breeding.
At the very least, a considered
debate on these proposals would
expose the realities of our needs
and pretensions in designing a
future with a manageable
population.

Science, Beryl L. Crowe, who

buck-passing that we all play, but
especially the social as against the
natural scientists.
Serious problems will remain
unsolved "so long as the social
sciences continue to defer the
most critical problems that face
mankind to future technical
advances, while the natural
sciences continue to defer those
same problems which are about to
overwhelm all mankind to false
expectations in the political

solution, and before these are
irresistibly, we should seek and
try new social inventions, do not
want a solution at the cost of a
nightmarish secret service of
genetic and demographic police.
Compounded Difficulties
Our difficulties are
compounded by a pattern of
social injustice that leaves an
underprivileged class that believes

it has nothing to lose, so why not
breed more. Widespread poverty
also turns any hypothetical
punishment of irresponsible
parents into penalties on innocent
children.
Senator George S. McGovern's
recent proposal for a universal
family allowance based on $50 a
month per child suggests a
constructive approach to a
meaningful but compassionate
social experiment. It was
promptly and I believe correctly,
criticized on the floor of the
House by Representative John B.
Anderson (R., III.) as an
aggravating stimulus to population
growth, an irresponsible birth
incentive. It is also totally
unrealistic to expect an
appropriation of $35 billion for a
program tainted by the thought
that it might help the poor to
continue to outbreed the rich.
We have surprisingly little
information to support guesses
about the impact of children's
allowances on population growth.
Canada's birth rates have tended
to fluctuate in close parallel with
the U.S. in response to major
economic and social trends,
regardless of a long history of
such allowances in Canada.
Senator McGovern's proposal
should be amended so to start
with allowances only for the first
two children of a given mother. It
might also make the same
allowance to a married woman
before and after her first child, so
as not to hasten child-bearing.
Routine Statistics
Statistics on births by
birth-order are already routinely
collected on a large scale, and it
would not take long to determine
whether this approach to a
guaranteed income base could
have a significant effect on family
policy. If it did, we should soon
count relatively fewer third and
fourth births compared to second.
Programs like this are not as
expensive as they appear at first
sight. We really do not mean to
turn our backs on the welfare of
the young and by one route or
another we must provide essential
services and food to needy
chidlren. The McGovern proposal,
with the suggested amendment,
carries the possibility of managing
the limitations in our resources to
help experiment with solutions to
the "incidental" problem of
over breeding.
At the very least, a considered
debate on these proposals would
expose the realities of our needs
and pretensions in designing a
future with a manageable
population.

In the Nov. 29 issue of
Science, Beryl L. Crowe, who
teaches political science at Oregon
State University, Corvallis,
describes; the game of mutual
buck-passing that we all play, but
especially the social as against the
natural scientists.
Serious problems will remain
unsolved "so long as the social
sciences continue to defer the
most critical problems that face
mankind to future technical
advances, while the natural
sciences continue to defer those
same problems which are about to
overwhelm all mankind to false
expectations in the political
realm."
In the same issue, John R.
Piatt, a well known biophysicist
who is now associate director of
the Mental Health Research
Institute at the University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, exhorts
scientists about "What We Must
Do". After a gloomy inventory
and classification of national and
world problems in relation to
their gravity, he calls for a
mobilization of scientific task
forces for highly coordinated,
large scale work on the major
issues.
(The Manhattan Project is
inevitably thought of as a parallel
- it may be naughty to recall that
it was rationally founded on a
premise later proven false, namely
that Hitler was racing to produce
a Nazi superweapon.)
Non-Problem Solved
In other words, a mobilization
had generated a magnificent
technical solution to a
non-problem, and has, in turn,

changed world history in ways we
have still to fathom.)
By far the most interesting
part of Prof. Piatt's essay is, by
coincidence, a rebuttal to Prof.
Crowe in the form of a list of
social inventions. They include
Keynesian economics, opinion
polls, operations analysis, game
theory, input-output economics,
credit cards, and income tax
withholding. Some remarks about
these might be unprintable, but
they can indeed have a large,
quick impact.
Overpopulation is near the top
of anyone's list of social
problems. However optimistically
we dispense with other aspects of
it, we cannot evade its pressure on
an irreplaceable natural heritage
and the accumulation of our
garbage and other pollutants.
However, American couples
(as shown by demographer Judith
Blake at Berkeley, typically still
expect to produce between three
and four children for an ideal
family. We have found no humane
way to regulate this market, to
restrain a couple from hogging
more than its fair share of the
common resource - human living
space on the planet. We begin to
hear demands for a radical
solution, and before these are
irresistibly, we should seek and
try new social inventions, do not
want a solution at the cost of a
nightmarish secret service of
genetic and demographic police.
