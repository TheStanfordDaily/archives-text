## Professionalization An Answer 
### Barry Askinas 
I hate to agree with the Provost. It gives me
indigestion. But he's right. There is a conflict
between being a student and being a student
activist. Student politics is a full-time job.
I came to the university, ostensibly to get a
Ph.D., but in the last two years, working on
university problems that were important to me, I
found that my academic work came to a virtual
stand-still.
I also found myself becoming more and more
the student burcaucrat, going to committee
meetings and making symbolic appearances and
less and less able to concentrate on issues. There
was no time to try and innovate and no time for
books. It got so bad, I started having fantasies
about reading books.
As a student body president, like it or not, one
comes to be part of the administration and
therefore quite inhibited to say what one really
feels about a particular issue. You must represent
the student body to the alumni, to the faculty, to
the administration. What is the opinion of the
student body on issue X? Well, there are at least
six different opinions.

Finally, there is your name on the official list
of administration officials who may eat without
charge in the residences. I thought we were elected
to do battle with the administration on the behalf
of the students. It turns out we are part of them,
albeit unpaid.
What is the solution? I think the answer is
pro fessionalization of student government.
Students should set the policies on particular
issues and full-time staff people should carry them
out. In a like manner, the faculty set academic
policy in the Academic Senate and the president,
provost, and various deans carry out the policy.
Long-term, I see the Dean of Students Office
playing that role. The office will truly have the
role of advocate for student interests, a role it
claims to seek, when it has become the
professional arm of student government.
I suppose this notion probably shocks a lot of
people in the administration and students as well.
Rut five or ten years from now, I wouldn't be at
all surprised if . . .
