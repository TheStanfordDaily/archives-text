# ASSU vs. Arena
## Fascist Government? 
### Mark Venezia 
Throughout the last three
academic years bundles of
especially controversial issues of
the Arena have been stolen and
destroyed. On November 13th,
1969, the BSU leadership issued a
press release to the Stanford Daily
including the following:" It
should be further noted that "The
Arena" and the body which it
represents will jeopardize its very
existence if such half-baked
"intellectual" activities are
continued. . ." On Bloody
Thursday, December 4th, 1969,
"Arena" photographers were
attacked on campus by a mob of
high school radicals and because
of a "misunderstanding" were
denied police protection by the
administration of Stanford
University.
But the "Arena" stuck its neck
out even further somehow
retaining a belief that if free
speech were eliminated in an
academic community it would
never be as a result of internal
pressures.
Last quarter, in line with its
libertarian direction, the "Arena"
began its campaign to make the
ASSU a voluntary organization.
Although it was thought that the
ASSU had only minor
governmental powers it seemed a
natural extention of a decentralist
libertarian philosophy to attempt
to eliminate its compulsory
aspects. If a voluntary ASSU's
services were found to be
worthwhile by Stanford students
then it would still survive through
voluntary patronization. If a
certain type of student found that
he had lost valuable experience in
using the coercive power of the
ASSU ministate then all the
better.
Scathing Attack
After a particularly scathing
attack on ASSU organizations
failing to live up to the regulations
of their own funding agency and a
captioned jibe directed at David
Swift, ASSU Financial Manager, it
was decided that the muckraking
"Arena" be investigated for
violations of the by-laws of the
ASSU which pertain to its
licensing power over an allegedly
free press.
Swift told the Senate that the
"Arena" had broken almost every
rule in the by-laws concerning

publications. Since he delivered
his report to the Senate right after
the "Arena's" attacks some
questioned whether the "new"
findings might be politically
motivated. But David Swift stated
"I'm not omniscient, I can't see
everything that is going on."
We had thought that the major
problem with the ASSU was that
it was compulsory. We also
thought that it did not adequately
represent Stanford students. We

resented petty power mongers
playing with our money and our
lives. But the ASSU has turned
out to be something much more
sinister. The power to use laws for
political purposes has never been
delegated to the ASSU by anyone.
Such power is arbitrary power.
The exercise of such power by the
state is called fascism.

attacked on campus by a mob of
high school radicals and because
of a "misunderstanding" were
denied police protection by the
administration of Stanford
University.
But the "Arena" stuck its neck
out even further somehow
retaining a belief that if free
speech were eliminated in an
academic community it would
never be as a result of internal
pressures.
Last quarter, in line with its
libertarian direction, the "Arena"
began its campaign to make the
ASSU a voluntary organization.
Although it was thought that the
ASSU had only minor
governmental powers it seemed a
natural extention of a decentralist
libertarian philosophy to attempt
to eliminate its compulsory
aspects. If a voluntary ASSU's
services were found to be
worthwhile by Stanford students
then it would still survive through
voluntary patronization. If a
certain type of student found that
he had lost valuable experience in
using the coercive power of the
ASSU ministate then all the
better.
Scathing Attack
After a particularly scathing
attack on ASSU organizations
failing to live up to the regulations
of their own funding agency and a
captioned jibe directed at David
Swift, ASSU Financial Manager, it
was decided that the muckraking
"Arena" be investigated for
violations of the by-laws of the
ASSU which pertain to its
licensing power over an allegedly
free press.
Swift told the Senate that the
"Arena" had broken almost every
rule in the by-laws concerning

publications. Since he delivered
his report to the Senate right after
the "Arena's" attacks some
questioned whether the "new"
findings might be politically
motivated. But David Swift stated
"I'm not omniscient, I can't see
everything that is going on."
We had thought that the major
problem with the ASSU was that
it was compulsory. We also
thought that it did not adequately
represent Stanford students. We

resented petty power mongers
playing with our money and our
lives. But the ASSU has turned
out to be something much more
sinister. The power to use laws for
political purposes has never been
delegated to the ASSU by anyone.
Such power is arbitrary power.
The exercise of such power by the
state is called fascism.

Throughout the last three
academic years bundles of
especially controversial issues of
the Arena have been stolen and
destroyed. On November 13th,
1969, the BSU leadership issued a
press release to the Stanford Daily
including the following:" It
should be further noted that "The
Arena" and the body which it
represents will jeopardize its very
existence if such half-baked
"intellectual" activities are
continued. . ." On Bloody
Thursday, December 4th, 1969,
"Arena" photographers were
attacked on campus by a mob of
high school radicals and because
of a "misunderstanding" were
denied police protection by the
administration of Stanford
University.
