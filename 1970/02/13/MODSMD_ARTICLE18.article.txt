# WSA And PLP
## Repudiate Revisionism 
### Ivo Banac 
In their letter to the Daily four members
of the "Revolutionary" Union(RU) have once
again demonstrated their determination to
prevent the building of a mass-based
anti-imperialist, anti-racist, pro-working class
SDS chapter. The aim of
Weiss-Keilch-Weiss-Hagen (hereafter Weiss
etal.) is to scare off Stanford students who see
a need for such a chapter by claiming that its
organizers share all of the independent
positions of the Progressive Labor Party
(PLP), and are therefore, somehow, strictly
interested in building PL idea.
Doug Hogan's article in the Daily (Feb. 9)
has already made it clear that this is not our
purpose. Quite a few people who do not agree
with the Worker-Student Alliance caucus of
SDS are participating in the creation of the
new SDS chapter, and even the WSA members
do not necessarily agree with many PL
positions. The difference is that the "R"U is
interested in its own sectarian cadre-building,
whereas we want to build a mass movement in
which all the students who are willing to fight
against imperialism and racism can participate.
Many of us who strongly disagree with the
"R"U would, for example, have no objection
to having the "R"U in SDS. Thus is not based
on the liberal "love-thy-neighbor" attitude,
but rather because we think that the presence
of the "R"U and its participation in debate
would make it clear why "R"U must be
repudiated.
Conflicting Positions
At the recent Los Angeles National
Council meeting of SDS many conflicting
positions were advanced. The fact that over
500 people from the Western states took part
in this National Council is a tribute to our

determination to build a mass, fighting,
radical student movement. To Slander PL, as
"R"U does, with the aim of isolating it from
the student movement can in no way change
this fact. However, as an individual who agrees
with the I'L independent line, I would like to
reply to some points raised by Weiss etal.
Briefly, PL holds that nationalism is a
bourgeois class outlook (and is therefore
inherently reactionary at the time when the
bourgeoisie is in no way progressive) which
advances the notion that national unity is
primary and class unity secondary.
"Revolutionary" movements, and have
therefore become the captives of imperialism.
It does no good to completely distort Mao
Tsetung's October 1938 statement on
"Patriotism and Internationalism" by putting
the word "nationalism" in brackets after
"patriotism" as Weiss etal., do in order to
cover up their betrayal of proletarian
internationalism.
The fact is that U.S. imperialism can make
a deal with nationalists. The disgusting
spectacle of Ceausescu and Nixon kissing each
other last summer in "socialist" Rumania is a
sufficient example of this truth. So also are
the Paris negotiations, where a deal is being
prepared to sell-out the struggle of the
Vietnamese people.
Repudiate Revisionism
Unless nationalism and revisionism are
repudiated, all of the national liberation
struggles can and will be turned around. In
that context it is a crime to sit back and
glorify the people who are responsible for
these reversals. PL has a duty to educate the
American workers and other progressive
forces about the nature of bourgeois ideology.

It doesn't intend to end up as those million
Indonesian communists, whose grave was dug
up by their "compatriot" Suharto. It could
not be otherwise.
The Indonesian CP ideologically disarmed
its members under a slogan of "placing class
interests under national interests" (D.N. Aidit,
"Report on the Second Plenary Session of the
Central Committee of the VI-th Congress").
Nor does PL intend to ignore the nationalist
degeneration of the Black Panther Party,
which has in alliance with the sell-out
"Communist" Party completely repudiated its
original goals. These goals included the
organizing of black workers and armed
defense of the black community from police
attacks.
It would take too much space to answer
out-and-out lies raised by Weiss et al. about
PL's role in San Jose State, Pittsburgh-Des
Moines & GE strikes, and other struggles.
However, it should be mentioned that PL
members Bridges Randle, Hari Dillon, John
Levin and Gene Marchi are currently serving
or will serve jail sentences (of 1 year, eight, six
and six months respectively) for their role in
the S.F. State strike, which as Weiss et al. put
it so politely, "they had helped to build."
It would be interesting to see if the "R"U
can, for a change, come out and defend their
positions. After all, if they find PL line so
repugnant, let them at least expound their
idea of what be more expedient tactics and
more correct views. Until that time it would
behoove them to slow down their noisy
campaign of slanders and vituperation.
