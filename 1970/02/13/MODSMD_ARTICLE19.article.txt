# The 						Green Machine
## Underground GI's 
### Penny Hill 
(Editor's Note: The following
is the conclusion of a two-part
series on the Green Machine
Project, an underground anti-war
military organization.)
The development of the green
machine project, and its
relationship with MDM began
with a group of bay area radicals
who tried to start a coffee house
in Oceanside, but all attempts to
establish such a facility were met
with a harassment and small-time
political wheelings and dealing.
The project members at one
time almost got to sign a lease for
a building, but at the last minute
the prospective landlord was
threatened by the Mayor of
Oceanside and harassed by the
local police which convinced him
to withdraw his offer. When the
possibility of getting the project
started was least hopeful, folk
singer Barbara Dane offered to do
a performance.
The staff managed to get the
USO for her to sing in and by the

end of the evening she had the
crowd singing anti-war songs and
shouting "join the ASU,"
American Servicemen's Union.
The project grew more active
and productive when the staff
realized that political work did
not depend on the structure they
had believed vital to their project.
They had to disorient themselves
from their experiences in Bay
Area organizing, because they
were dealing with a totally
different situation.
Military Moratorium
One of the activities was the
military moratorium in December
in which 1,000 marines and 4,000
civilians participated. The march
was led by a red peoples bus
equipped with a PA system which
led the group in chants such as,
"1,2,3,4, we won't fight your
facist war."
Speakers included green beret
ex-master sergent Donald Duncan,
ex-captain Dr. Howard Levi, who
refused to train green beret and
spent two years in the military
brig as a result of his actions.
The green machine project has
many other activities which it
considers essential to the
strengthening of MDM.; weekly
meetings at which during special
guests speak on films shown and
the men discuss current problems;
political education classes which
serve to help the men get
themselves together, and
informational leafletting in
downtown Oceanside, conducted
under the watchful eyes of local
marine corps and police.
Educational for AU
Not only are the activities
educational for the marines, they
are likewise educational for the
staff members who under
estimated how radical the marines
could be. They respond
enthusiatiscally to the Black
Panther Party which supports
MDM. They see the repression and

y *
blatent racism in the military
and are beginning to do something
about it. They see themselves used
as a tool for the imperialist
government, and resent the
treatment they receive. They
refuse to be conditioned and
twisted into marine corps men.,
and are beginning to act
collectively and independently
despite the training they received
in marine boot camp which is
meant to destroy these qualities.
It is interesting to note that a
GE worker said that GE likes to
hire ex-marines because, they are
used to obeying orders.
Racism is one of the biggest
problems within the military, but
MDM realized that the Marine
C. rps uses racism to its advantage,
to divide the men and keep them
fighting each other.
Concession
An example of this was a
"concession" which allowed black
marines to wear afro haircuts.
MDM interprets this favor as
another way of pitting whites
against blacks because to a white
man it would appear that the
black man is getting special
privileges because of his color.
Resisting the political,
economic and personal
harassment of the military takes
courage and it is a very powerful
experience to witness the process
of politicaiization of men within
the marine corps. Honesty is
essential, one has to be upfront
with his politics, because the
organizing that is taking place is
more on a one to one basis than a
mass base.
Perhaps the most encouraging
aspect of the Green Machine
project is that out of the
organizing efforts the men are
becoming leaders not followers.

government, and resent the
treatment they receive. They
refuse to be conditioned and
twisted into marine corps men.,
and are beginning to act
collectively and independently
despite the training they received
in marine boot camp which is
meant to destroy these qualities.
It is interesting to note that a
GE worker said that GE likes to
hire ex-marines because, they are
used to obeying orders.
Racism is one of the biggest
problems within the military, but
MDM realized that the Marine
C. rps uses racism to its advantage,
to divide the men and keep them
fighting each other.
Concession
An example of this was a
"concession" which allowed black
marines to wear afro haircuts.
MDM interprets this favor as
another way of pitting whites
against blacks because to a white
man it would appear that the
black man is getting special
privileges because of his color.
Resisting the political,
economic and personal
harassment of the military takes
courage and it is a very powerful
experience to witness the process
of politicaiization of men within
the marine corps. Honesty is
essential, one has to be upfront
with his politics, because the
organizing that is taking place is
more on a one to one basis than a
mass base.
Perhaps the most encouraging
aspect of the Green Machine
project is that out of the
organizing efforts the men are
becoming leaders not followers.

organizing with Green Machine, is
a former Stanford student and a
former Daily staffer.)
(Editor's Note: The following
is the conclusion of a two-part
series on the Green Machine
Project, an underground anti-war
military organization.)
The development of the green
machine project, and its
relationship with MDM began
with a group of bay area radicals
who tried to start a coffee house
in Oceanside, but all attempts to
establish such a facility were met
with a harassment and small-time
political wheelings and dealing.
The project members at one
time almost got to sign a lease for
a building, but at the last minute
the prospective landlord was
threatened by the Mayor of
Oceanside and harassed by the
local police which convinced him
to withdraw his offer. When the
possibility of getting the project
started was least hopeful, folk
singer Barbara Dane offered to do
a performance.
The staff managed to get the
USO for her to sing in and by the

end of the evening she had the
crowd singing anti-war songs and
shouting "join the ASU,"
American Servicemen's Union.
The project grew more active
and productive when the staff
realized that political work did
not depend on the structure they
had believed vital to their project.
They had to disorient themselves
from their experiences in Bay
Area organizing, because they
were dealing with a totally
different situation.
Military Moratorium
One of the activities was the
military moratorium in December
in which 1,000 marines and 4,000
civilians participated. The march
was led by a red peoples bus
equipped with a PA system which
led the group in chants such as,
"1,2,3,4, we won't fight your
facist war."
Speakers included green beret
ex-master sergent Donald Duncan,
ex-captain Dr. Howard Levi, who
refused to train green beret and
spent two years in the military
brig as a result of his actions.
The green machine project has
many other activities which it
considers essential to the
strengthening of MDM.; weekly
meetings at which during special
guests speak on films shown and
the men discuss current problems;
political education classes which
serve to help the men get
themselves together, and
informational leafletting in
downtown Oceanside, conducted
under the watchful eyes of local
marine corps and police.
Educational for AU
Not only are the activities
educational for the marines, they
are likewise educational for the
staff members who under
estimated how radical the marines
could be. They respond
enthusiatiscally to the Black
Panther Party which supports
MDM. They see the repression and

y *
blatent racism in the military
and are beginning to do something
about it. They see themselves used
as a tool for the imperialist
government, and resent the
treatment they receive. They
refuse to be conditioned and
twisted into marine corps men.,
and are beginning to act
collectively and independently
despite the training they received
in marine boot camp which is
