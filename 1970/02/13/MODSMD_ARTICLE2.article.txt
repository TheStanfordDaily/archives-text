Harold Carswell to the Supreme

open espousal of the doctrine of

petition maintains.
"His conduct in the
intervening years—his active
participation in the formation of a
segregated golf course, his rulings
in school desegregation cases, his
shockingly discourteous treatment
of civil rights lawyers and their
clients in his courtroom—make
plain Judge Carswell's continued

antagonism to the principle of
racial equality."
The petition was sent to only
60 Senators, but asked "all
Senators of good will to vote
against the confirmation of Judge
Carswell.
The 21 men who, acting as
individuals, signed the petition
