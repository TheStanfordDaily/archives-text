# Women's Liberation
## Oppression Comes From Exploitation 
### Judith Sharasser 
(Editor's note: The following
is the second column in a
continuing series in Women's
Liberation.)
I spent a long time several
weeks ago talking with an old
college friend. She's twenty-five,
and living with her parents in Los
Angeles, having recently quit an
executive-secretarial type job in
New York. She's floating—doesn't
know what she wants to do with
herself—knows that her family is
happy to have her at home —gets
very depressed about her own
purposelessness.
While she was visiting me, she
spent an evening with another old
college friend. This second girl is
twenty-five and living with her
parents in San Francisco, having
recently left a junior
administrative position at our old
college. She's working as a
secretary, but still
floating—doesn't know what she
wants to do with herself—knows
that her family is happy to have
her at home—gets very depressed
about her own purposelessness.
My two friends, after not
much discussion, discovered that
their situations and moods were
nearly identical. They began
looking around for the reason that
they, bright graduates of one of
the country's finest liberal arts

colleges, were drifting so
aimlessly.
At first, they blamed
themselves; they talked of seeing
psychiatrists and joining therapy
groups. But then they wondered,
"How many 25-year old male
college graduates live at home?
Why is my family happy to
welcome me home, to provide
emotional and financial support?"
Girls Can Stay Home
Both friends come from warm,
loving families—but they realized
that many men who feel
compelled to find support away
from home come from similar
families. Both friends' parents
value higher education for girls as
well as boys; but both families
(and of course, most of society),
expect that girls will ultimately be
supported by their husbands.
Before a girl marries, she can live
an independent life. But generally,
no one expects her to.
Men are raised under a
different set of expectations.
They are directed toward
careers —and though a man may be
drifting at age 25, he generally
tries to conceal it from his family
and employer. He lives his own
life, and rarely "runs home to
mama" when problems arise. The
same cultural and economic
pressures which guide American
men toward an early (and often
unsatisfying) career choice, my
friends realized, shelter women

from the need to lead
independent lives.
Women's Liberation, as a
movement, has had its beginnings
in precisely the tentative,
personal, small-group exploration
of the problems of women that
my friends undertook.
Problem Not Unique
Once women realize that their
problems are not unique; once
they begin to trade stories about
their experiences as women; then
they begin to think about ways to
solve their problems. No longer
isolated from other women, they
can think about working together
as women against the cultural,
political and economic pressures
limiting their freedom
Groups like the National
Organization of Women and
Women's Liberation, and
individuals within these groups,
differ in political analysis and on
political methods. Yet they agree
that the liberation of women is a
political issue.
Some women view the
inequality of women in this
society as unfortunate but
accidental: something that will be
remedied as soon as the injustices
are sufficiently publicized.
Other women view the
oppression of American women as
the fault of American men. Their
response to women's liberation

issues is a policy of deliberate
female chauvinism and fierce
man-hating.
Result of Exploitation
Yet other women view the
oppression of women, like the
oppression of blacks, Chicanos,
American Indians and white
American men as an inherent
result of an exploitative economic
and social system Women are
taught to be consumers in a
society dependent on
consumption. Their men are
taught the role of breadwinner
who brings home the money for
the little women to spend.
Most men can no more free
themselves from the
career/breadwinner orientation
than most women can free
themselves from their consumer
roles. And yet these traditional
roles are among the forces that
compel Americans to follow,
unquestioningly, the great gods of
Economic Growth and More
Profits wherever they may lead
us: to Vietnam, to the destruction
of our environment, to the
complete disregard of human
rights and human welfare in our
own and in other countries.
Female chauvinism is not, I
believe, an appropriate part of
Women's Liberation. Men
are oppressed quite as much as
women, and by the same forces.
The liberation of men will
necessarily accompany the
liberation of women, which is
itself a part of the liberation of all
people.
Unequal Position
But the unequal position of
women in the United States will
not be remedied by legislation and
court cases alone, any more than
the injustices dished out to blacks
have been remedied by laws and
court cases. The subjugation of
women is an integral part of the
American economic and social
system, and the symptoms of
oppression, consequently, are
subtle, varied, and frequently
both legal and constitutional.
An ad for tourism in India,
headlined "The world's most
liberated women," reflects
another form of oppression, an
attempt to make women happy
without really changing their
situation. The ad, graced by a
picture of a high-caste and
beautiful Indian, says, "What the
Indian woman is free of, you will
find, is the notion that to be free
she must break with tradition.
Perhaps that is why she has
emerged into prominence in so
many walks of life, without
threatening the Indian man."
In order to be free, and
freedom is much more than
"prominence" - women and men,
in India or America, must break
with tradition. We need not
threaten each other, but we must
threaten our oppressors. Without
attacking the technocracy, the
economy, the cultural and
political status quo, we will never
break the bonds which limit the
freedom of the many for the
greater satisfaction of the few.

purposelessness.
While she was visiting me, she
spent an evening with another old
college friend. This second girl is
twenty-five and living with her
parents in San Francisco, having
recently left a junior
administrative position at our old
college. She's working as a
secretary, but still
floating—doesn't know what she
wants to do with herself—knows
that her family is happy to have
her at home—gets very depressed
about her own purposelessness.
My two friends, after not
much discussion, discovered that
their situations and moods were
nearly identical. They began
looking around for the reason that
they, bright graduates of one of
the country's finest liberal arts

colleges, were drifting so
aimlessly.
At first, they blamed
themselves; they talked of seeing
psychiatrists and joining therapy
groups. But then they wondered,
"How many 25-year old male
college graduates live at home?
Why is my family happy to
welcome me home, to provide
emotional and financial support?"
Girls Can Stay Home
Both friends come from warm,
loving families—but they realized
that many men who feel
compelled to find support away
from home come from similar
families. Both friends' parents
value higher education for girls as
well as boys; but both families
(and of course, most of society),
expect that girls will ultimately be
supported by their husbands.
Before a girl marries, she can live
an independent life. But generally,
no one expects her to.
Men are raised under a
different set of expectations.
They are directed toward
careers —and though a man may be
drifting at age 25, he generally
tries to conceal it from his family
and employer. He lives his own
life, and rarely "runs home to
mama" when problems arise. The
same cultural and economic
pressures which guide American
men toward an early (and often
unsatisfying) career choice, my
friends realized, shelter women

from the need to lead
independent lives.
Women's Liberation, as a
movement, has had its beginnings
in precisely the tentative,
personal, small-group exploration
of the problems of women that
my friends undertook.
Problem Not Unique
Once women realize that their
problems are not unique; once
they begin to trade stories about
their experiences as women; then
they begin to think about ways to
solve their problems. No longer
isolated from other women, they
can think about working together
as women against the cultural,
political and economic pressures
limiting their freedom
Groups like the National
Organization of Women and
Women's Liberation, and
individuals within these groups,
differ in political analysis and on
political methods. Yet they agree
that the liberation of women is a
political issue.
Some women view the
inequality of women in this
society as unfortunate but
accidental: something that will be
remedied as soon as the injustices
are sufficiently publicized.
Other women view the
oppression of American women as
the fault of American men. Their
response to women's liberation

issues is a policy of deliberate
female chauvinism and fierce
man-hating.
Result of Exploitation
Yet other women view the
oppression of women, like the
oppression of blacks, Chicanos,
American Indians and white
American men as an inherent
result of an exploitative economic
and social system Women are
taught to be consumers in a
society dependent on
consumption. Their men are
taught the role of breadwinner
who brings home the money for
the little women to spend.
Most men can no more free
themselves from the
career/breadwinner orientation
than most women can free
themselves from their consumer
roles. And yet these traditional
roles are among the forces that
compel Americans to follow,
unquestioningly, the great gods of
Economic Growth and More
Profits wherever they may lead
us: to Vietnam, to the destruction
of our environment, to the
complete disregard of human
rights and human welfare in our
own and in other countries.
Female chauvinism is not, I
believe, an appropriate part of
Women's Liberation. Men
are oppressed quite as much as
women, and by the same forces.
The liberation of men will
necessarily accompany the
liberation of women, which is
itself a part of the liberation of all
people.
Unequal Position
But the unequal position of
women in the United States will
not be remedied by legislation and
court cases alone, any more than
the injustices dished out to blacks
have been remedied by laws and
court cases. The subjugation of
women is an integral part of the
American economic and social
system, and the symptoms of
oppression, consequently, are
subtle, varied, and frequently
both legal and constitutional.
An ad for tourism in India,
headlined "The world's most
liberated women," reflects
another form of oppression, an
attempt to make women happy
without really changing their
situation. The ad, graced by a
picture of a high-caste and
beautiful Indian, says, "What the
Indian woman is free of, you will
find, is the notion that to be free
she must break with tradition.
Perhaps that is why she has
emerged into prominence in so
many walks of life, without
threatening the Indian man."
In order to be free, and
freedom is much more than
"prominence" - women and men,
in India or America, must break
with tradition. We need not
threaten each other, but we must
threaten our oppressors. Without
attacking the technocracy, the
economy, the cultural and
political status quo, we will never
break the bonds which limit the
freedom of the many for the
greater satisfaction of the few.

their situations and moods were
nearly identical. They began
looking around for the reason that
they, bright graduates of one of
the country's finest liberal arts

colleges, were drifting so
aimlessly.
At first, they blamed
themselves; they talked of seeing
psychiatrists and joining therapy
groups. But then they wondered,
"How many 25-year old male
college graduates live at home?
Why is my family happy to
welcome me home, to provide
emotional and financial support?"
Girls Can Stay Home
Both friends come from warm,
loving families—but they realized
that many men who feel
compelled to find support away
from home come from similar
families. Both friends' parents
value higher education for girls as
well as boys; but both families
(and of course, most of society),
expect that girls will ultimately be
supported by their husbands.
Before a girl marries, she can live
an independent life. But generally,
no one expects her to.
Men are raised under a
different set of expectations.
They are directed toward
careers —and though a man may be
drifting at age 25, he generally
tries to conceal it from his family
and employer. He lives his own
life, and rarely "runs home to
mama" when problems arise. The
same cultural and economic
pressures which guide American
men toward an early (and often
unsatisfying) career choice, my
friends realized, shelter women

from the need to lead
independent lives.
Women's Liberation, as a
movement, has had its beginnings
in precisely the tentative,
personal, small-group exploration
of the problems of women that
my friends undertook.
Problem Not Unique
Once women realize that their
problems are not unique; once
they begin to trade stories about
their experiences as women; then
they begin to think about ways to
solve their problems. No longer
isolated from other women, they
can think about working together
as women against the cultural,
political and economic pressures
limiting their freedom
Groups like the National
Organization of Women and
Women's Liberation, and
individuals within these groups,
differ in political analysis and on
political methods. Yet they agree
that the liberation of women is a
political issue.
Some women view the
inequality of women in this
society as unfortunate but
accidental: something that will be
remedied as soon as the injustices
are sufficiently publicized.
Other women view the
oppression of American women as
the fault of American men. Their
response to women's liberation

issues is a policy of deliberate
female chauvinism and fierce
man-hating.
Result of Exploitation
Yet other women view the
oppression of women, like the
oppression of blacks, Chicanos,
American Indians and white
American men as an inherent
result of an exploitative economic
and social system Women are
taught to be consumers in a
society dependent on
consumption. Their men are
taught the role of breadwinner
who brings home the money for
the little women to spend.
Most men can no more free
themselves from the
career/breadwinner orientation
than most women can free
themselves from their consumer
roles. And yet these traditional
roles are among the forces that
compel Americans to follow,
unquestioningly, the great gods of
Economic Growth and More
Profits wherever they may lead
us: to Vietnam, to the destruction
of our environment, to the
complete disregard of human
rights and human welfare in our
own and in other countries.
Female chauvinism is not, I
believe, an appropriate part of
Women's Liberation. Men
are oppressed quite as much as
women, and by the same forces.
The liberation of men will
necessarily accompany the
liberation of women, which is
itself a part of the liberation of all
people.
Unequal Position
But the unequal position of
women in the United States will
not be remedied by legislation and
court cases alone, any more than
the injustices dished out to blacks
have been remedied by laws and
court cases. The subjugation of
women is an integral part of the
American economic and social
system, and the symptoms of
oppression, consequently, are
subtle, varied, and frequently
both legal and constitutional.
An ad for tourism in India,
headlined "The world's most
liberated women," reflects
another form of oppression, an
attempt to make women happy
without really changing their
situation. The ad, graced by a
picture of a high-caste and
beautiful Indian, says, "What the
Indian woman is free of, you will
find, is the notion that to be free
she must break with tradition.
Perhaps that is why she has
emerged into prominence in so
many walks of life, without
threatening the Indian man."
In order to be free, and
freedom is much more than
"prominence" - women and men,
in India or America, must break
with tradition. We need not
threaten each other, but we must
threaten our oppressors. Without
attacking the technocracy, the
economy, the cultural and
political status quo, we will never
break the bonds which limit the
freedom of the many for the
greater satisfaction of the few.

I spent a long time several
weeks ago talking with an old
college friend. She's twenty-five,
and living with her parents in Los
Angeles, having recently quit an
executive-secretarial type job in
New York. She's floating—doesn't
know what she wants to do with
herself—knows that her family is
happy to have her at home —gets
very depressed about her own
purposelessness.
While she was visiting me, she
spent an evening with another old
college friend. This second girl is
twenty-five and living with her
parents in San Francisco, having
recently left a junior
administrative position at our old
college. She's working as a
secretary, but still
floating—doesn't know what she
wants to do with herself—knows
that her family is happy to have
her at home—gets very depressed
