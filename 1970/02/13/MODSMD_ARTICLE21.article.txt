# Moratorium
## Peace Workshop Slated Saturday 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
In keeping with its goal of
mobilizing the community on the
War and the draft, the Vietnam
Moratorium has planned a
community workshop for this
Saturday at the Congregational
Church, located at the corner of
Lewis and Embarcadero roads.
The all-day affair will feature
speeches in the morning by Prof.
John Lewis and Special Services
Counselor Alan Strain, with small
workshops in the afternoon on
various issues and tactics related
to the Moratorium.
Prof. Lewis, co-author of The
United States in Vietnam, will
speak on "What We Can Expect to
Happen in Vietnam." It is his and
other Moratorium leaders'
contention that President Nixon's
Vietnamization program cannot
work, and will eventually come
apart at the seams.
Draft counselor Alan Strain
will follow with his views on "The
Urgency of Draft Repeal." Strain
served on President Pitzer's
Committee on Selective Service,
which studied the system and
released a report on it last year.
In its report, the Committee
charged that "there are inherent
defects in any system of selective,
conscripted military service which
are acceptable only under
conditions of extreme national
emergency,'' and that

"conscription into the armed
forces contradicts very
fundamental American traditions
and principles."
The committee recommended
strongly the abolition of the draft
and its replacement by an
all-volunteer military force.
Automatic Renewal
Strain claims that if draft
reforms are instituted this year, as
many Senators and Congressmen
are hoping, renewal of the draft
for another four years will be
almost automatic next year.
The Moratorium is apparently
convinced of the urgency of the
issue; students are presently being
organized to speak to local
communities and high schools on
draft repeal, with the hopes of
generating public sentiment that
will be felt by the elected officials
in Washington.
Strain will be followed in the
program by Arthur Bushkin,
Lockheed scientist and
community leader, who will
discuss the Moratorium's plans for
April 15. The national Moratorium
office has designated that date as
a day of nationwide tax
demonstrations at Internal
Revenue Offices across the
country.
New Priorities
Citizens will protest the
expenditure of their tax dollars on
the war in Vietnam, demanding
that priorities be redrawn and that
the money be spent on pressing
domestic needs, such as the
restoration of the environment.
Here in the Mid-Peninsula
region, several suggestions for
activities are being considered for
April 15, with the general theme
probably being a demand for a
re-ordering of priorities to
improve the quality of life in
America. One idea suggested is a
"Pledge for Peace" rally in which
citizens would pledge money,
food, clothing, and anything else
which might be donated to
worthy causes in this country.
Moratorium leaders have not
reached a decision on whether
they will call for a work stoppage
or slowdown on that day.

It is hoped that creative ideas
for activities in April might be
expressed in the meeting this
Saturday.
The afternoon session will
feature the workshops, which are
designed to educate the
community members on various
issues and techniques. One
workshop, to be conducted by
Alan Strain and the Committee to
'Repeal the Draft, will discuss in

detail the case for draft repeal,
and the techniques community
members might use to mobilize
support on this issue.
For those interested in
planning the April 15
demonstration protesting the use
of tax money for the war, there
will be a workshop led by Art
Bushkin. Those who hope to
canvass their neighborhoods will
attend a workshop led by

Stanford speech Prof. Arthur
Hastings.
Construction of Poll
Prof. Richard Brodie of
Political Science will conduct a
workshop which will construct a
poll of community attitudes on
the war. Brodie is a specialist in
the field of public opinion and
polling. Moratorium leaders hopf
that the poll can be used by
community canvassers in the
coming months.
The community meeting will
close with brief reports from each
workshop on what they have
discussed or decided, and
demonstration skits by member?
of Prof. Hasting's canvassing
workshop.
The Moratorium Day is open
to all members of the
M id-Peninsula community,
including students. Organizers of
the event are hoping that it will
draw not only community
members already committed to
the Moratorium, but also those
who have had no contact with the
Moratorium until now. For
married couples with children,
free babysitting services will be
provided at the church.
Leaders see the event as having
a dual function: informing the
public on war related issues, and
providing the framework and the
impetus for action on those issues.
Bob Clark, one of the student
coordinators, emphasizes that the
workshop will serve as a focus for
activities in the coming month:
and expresses hope that it will
encourage people to give thought
to some of the issues that are
interrelated with the war: the
draft, taxes, inflation, and
national priorities.
