# Man In Red China Subject Of Talks
## 
### JOHN SLOAN 
"The Malleability of Man" was
the topic of the second talk in the
series dealing with the concept of
man in Communist China by
Professor Donald Munro.
Much of Wednesday's lecture
was spent comparing the Soviet
and Chinese attitudes towards the
malleability of man, and how
these differences are manifest in
their two education systems.
Prof. Munro began with a
description of the Soviet view,
which he said stresses the
"plasticity of the human nervous
system." Therefore men can be
manipulated to produce
conditioned reflexes, and then
even unconditioned reflexes.
When transferred to education,
these ideas lay emphasis on the
method of teaching as the way to
produce qualitative changes in the
brain.
According to Munro, this view
leads to several problems in the
Soviet education system. First, it
blinds teachers to factors such as a
poor environment where a child
grew up, and second, it inhibits
teachers from speeding up the
learning process.
In application, this idea has led
to a great deal of uniformity
within the Soviet school system in
order to produce "a new type of
Soviet man." "The ideal of
uniformity is the practical
consequence of the view of

plasticity. With the right teaching,
they can all make the grade,"
according to the Soviet educators.
In the early 1950's when
China was borrowing much from
Russia these attitudes toward
malleability and uniformity were
also â€¢ adopted. The Chinese felt
that with proper teaching
methods and the new social
climate, everybody could make
the grade and develop into an all
around man. Therefore they too
set up a rigidly uniform system of
education which had as its slogan,
Education in service of the
People.
This view, held by Mao and
others, came under attack by
those who wished to see teaching
according to individual abilities.
However, this second view was
not upheld because it stated that
much of what the individual will
come is innate, and it denied the
maleability of man and it put
individual desires before the
people.
