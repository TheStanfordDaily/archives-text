# University Staff Cites Grievances
## 
### ED KOHN 
The United Stanford
Employees called this week for
"staff-initiated representation on
University committees." In a
front page editorial in its
newspaper, Employees Organize,
the USE also blasted President
Kenneth Pitzer for calling one of
the group's committees, the USE
ad hoc Women's Committee, a
"special interest group."
Robert M. Nelson, the
University's Director of Personnel
and Employee Relations, told the
Daily yesterday that Pitzer's letter
applied only to the Women's
Committee and not to the whole
association. He added that there
was "no attempt to deny staff
representation in committee
meetings."
Nelson also termed the
newly-formed Faculty-Staff
Affairs Committee "one step in
the way in which we want to go."
He said that Pitzer, when he sent
the letter, felt that the USE
Women's Committee was "not
representative" of campus-wide
staff.
The Employees Organize
editorial further charged that
Pitzer "continue(s) to ignore that
the staff must elect and represent
themselves" on University
committees and that the
President's appointments have
represented administration rather
than staff interests. It also
questioned Pitzer's "logic" in
allowing students and faculty to
determine their own
representatives, but not according
the staff the same rights.
Devisive Trick
The editorial termed Pitzer's
actions "nothing but a devisive
trick" and sta'ted that the USE
would sponsor a Staff Coalition
Committee in an effort to present
a strong staff front in an effort to
gain the desired staff
representation.
Roland Finston, newly-elected
President of the 250-member
group and a University Health
Physics employee, said Wednesday
night that the USE wants staff
representation on the Committee
on the Education and
Employment of Women at
Stanford, the Committee on Long
Range Financial Planning, the
Housing Committee, and the
Faculty-Staff Affairs Committee.
Finston said that the Staff
Coalition Committee has received
responses from almost all of the
staff-oriented campus groups

except the Stanford Employees
Association. According to the
paper's editorial, the purpose of
the Coalition Committee is "to
find means to represent ourselves
as widely as possible." The group
is still in its formative stage?
Finston said.
Grievances
In addition to seeking
representation rights, the USE is
attempting to secure wider
educational benefits, correct
inequalities in the University's
grievance procedure, establish *
day-care center for employees
children, and publicize job
classifications for various staff
positions.
The USE has filed several
grievance notices within recent
weeks, according to Finston. The
most publicized case has been th.7'
of Ken Garner and his roommate,
Tony Norman, who were "laid
off" and fired respectively from
the University Press. Although the
USE has yet to meet with success
in the Garner-Norman complaints,
it has been able to settle several
problems, including that of Ro"
Sax, an ex-bookstore employee,
who was given an extra week's
severance pay as a result of USE
intervention.
The group has established a
special committee to deal with the
Garner-Norman case, and Finston
said that he expects th
committee to meet soon with
Nelson, who has jurisdiction in
the case. The steering committee
was slated to meet last night to
consider several matters, including
the Garner-Norman grievances.
Classifications Publicized
Other articles in Employe*
Organize deal with low-cost
housing for employees and job
classifications. Finston said that
he feels the University does not
circulate the classifications, wage
salaries, and duties, to enough of
the employees, and that
publishing them was one way t'
make certain that all of the
information is widely available.
Finston said that all of the
materials contained in the
classification article have been a
matter of public record since Nov.
1, 1969.
The next meeting of the grou,
is slated for Feb. 24 at 7:30 p.m.
in room 87 of the Business
School. Items expected to be
considered include another
segment of the USE constitution,
and a speaker from a free peoples'
medical clinic is expected.


DOLLY GARTERS—Even though the Stanford basketball team is losing, evenings
at Maples can still be interesting. With garter-garnished thighs kicking high, the
Dollies have been stealing die show. Or so say the Daily photogs.

representation in committee
meetings."
Nelson also termed the
newly-formed Faculty-Staff
Affairs Committee "one step in
the way in which we want to go."
He said that Pitzer, when he sent
the letter, felt that the USE
Women's Committee was "not
representative" of campus-wide
staff.
The Employees Organize
editorial further charged that
Pitzer "continue(s) to ignore that
the staff must elect and represent
themselves" on University
committees and that the
President's appointments have
represented administration rather
than staff interests. It also
questioned Pitzer's "logic" in
allowing students and faculty to
determine their own
representatives, but not according
the staff the same rights.
Devisive Trick
The editorial termed Pitzer's
actions "nothing but a devisive
trick" and sta'ted that the USE
would sponsor a Staff Coalition
Committee in an effort to present
a strong staff front in an effort to
gain the desired staff
representation.
Roland Finston, newly-elected
President of the 250-member
group and a University Health
Physics employee, said Wednesday
night that the USE wants staff
representation on the Committee
on the Education and
Employment of Women at
Stanford, the Committee on Long
Range Financial Planning, the
Housing Committee, and the
Faculty-Staff Affairs Committee.
Finston said that the Staff
Coalition Committee has received
responses from almost all of the
staff-oriented campus groups

except the Stanford Employees
Association. According to the
paper's editorial, the purpose of
the Coalition Committee is "to
find means to represent ourselves
as widely as possible." The group
is still in its formative stage?
Finston said.
Grievances
In addition to seeking
representation rights, the USE is
attempting to secure wider
educational benefits, correct
inequalities in the University's
grievance procedure, establish *
day-care center for employees
children, and publicize job
classifications for various staff
positions.
The USE has filed several
grievance notices within recent
weeks, according to Finston. The
most publicized case has been th.7'
of Ken Garner and his roommate,
Tony Norman, who were "laid
off" and fired respectively from
the University Press. Although the
USE has yet to meet with success
in the Garner-Norman complaints,
it has been able to settle several
problems, including that of Ro"
Sax, an ex-bookstore employee,
who was given an extra week's
severance pay as a result of USE
intervention.
The group has established a
special committee to deal with the
Garner-Norman case, and Finston
said that he expects th
committee to meet soon with
Nelson, who has jurisdiction in
the case. The steering committee
was slated to meet last night to
consider several matters, including
the Garner-Norman grievances.
Classifications Publicized
Other articles in Employe*
Organize deal with low-cost
housing for employees and job
classifications. Finston said that
he feels the University does not
circulate the classifications, wage
salaries, and duties, to enough of
the employees, and that
publishing them was one way t'
make certain that all of the
information is widely available.
Finston said that all of the
materials contained in the
classification article have been a
matter of public record since Nov.
1, 1969.
The next meeting of the grou,
is slated for Feb. 24 at 7:30 p.m.
in room 87 of the Business
School. Items expected to be
considered include another
segment of the USE constitution,
and a speaker from a free peoples'
medical clinic is expected.

The United Stanford
Employees called this week for

the USE also blasted President

Robert M. Nelson, the
