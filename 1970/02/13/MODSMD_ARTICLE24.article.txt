# Old Guard Out Of Date
## Republican Arnett Offers Platform 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Responding to the label "a
dovish and liberal young
Republican," which appeared in
the San Francisco Chronicle
Wednesday, Stanford's Dixon
Arnett says, "I'm a moderate."
The recent entry into the GOP
primary campaign for the San
Mateo State Senate seat says he is
no more a dove than is President
Nixon, and that he fully supports
Vietnamization although he is not
sure it is working.
Challenging incumbent
Richard Dolwig, a Senator 30
years his senior, Arnett wants to
offer the choice of young
forward-looking Republicanism to
the voters of San Mateo County.
Calling Dolwig "old guardism
personified," Arnett said, "I'm
concerned about the future, and
Dolwig is a product of the past, a
special interest past."
The stress at Arnett's Tuesday
press conference announcing his
candidacy was on Dolwig's
isolation from what was then the
new young leadership in the state
Republican Party. Ironically, as
the press conference ensued, the
leadership Arnett identifies with

was being ousted by Dolwig's old
guardsmen.
"In my book this is a step
backward ten years," says Arnett.
"I feel cheated. The old guard
frame of mind is a return to the
special interest type of
government. Those people have
lost touch with what is going on
today."
Special Interest Groups
The difference between the
old guard and the new, according
to Arnett is that the young are
not simply responsive to special
interest groups, but are actively
responsible to their constituency
in meeting with them and
discussing their concerns. Arnett
says he would attempt to follow a
policy similar to that of
Congressman Paul N. "Pete"
McCloskey in keeping in touch
with the people in San Mateo
County.
Environmental problems will
be a major issue, according to
Arnett, who has been working
actively in this area for the past
year on assignment with
UNESCO. He is concerned that
politicians are just now becoming
aware of the environment

problems and don't know what to
do about them.
"The legislature is being
polluted by anti-pollution bills
sponsored by people who put
their name on the bill simply for
pride of authorship," he says.
There is an awareness now,
Arnett stated, but we must still
find the correct policies to
institute, and only then will the
results come. "We are only one
third of the way there, maybe
less."
Tax Reform
Arnett maintains that tax
reform is also an essential issue for
the legislature to handle. "I want
reform not shift," he says
refering to Reagan's plan to boost
sales tax in exchange for lowered
property tax. "We must so adjust
the system that we can create new
sources of revenue."
"Before or at least
coterminant with environmental
legislation we must work to set
the Senate financial house in
order. It takes money to stop
pollution and the State must
supply this money," he says. "We
should take an over-all view of

this problem and then legislate
with an orientation to achieve
results."
Arnett says he uses the same
definition of environment as
Nixon's science advisor Lee
Dubridge, "environment is all that
is without our skins." It is a
matrix of interacting disciplines
which cannot be approached with
a simplistic attitude, according to
Arnett.
Narcotics Reform
Law enforcement is another
area where Arnett holds some
outspoken views. Narcotics and
pornography are especially
distasteful to Arnett, who worked
as an undercover agent for the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics ten
years ago.

He is especially concerned
about organized crime. At his
Tuesday press conference he
accused state officials of ignoring
the mafia's recent expansion in
illicit traffic of drugs and
pornography.
"The lack of a major state
narcotics reform since 1961 is
deplorable," he says."I would
support a bill along the lines of
the recent federal legislation
which redefines and distinguishes
between hard narcotics,
hallucinogens, and marijuana. I
would not legalize marijuana
however, until there is absolute
evidence that there is no
psychological relationship
between marijuana and other
more dangerous drugs."
