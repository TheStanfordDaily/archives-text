# Panel Will Discuss Radioactive Wastes
## 
### 
Nobel Laureate Joshua
Lederberg, professor of genetics at
the School of Medicine, will join
three other prominent scientists in
a panel discussion on radioactive
pollution today.
The panel discussion, entitled
"Environmental Radiation
Hazards and Nuclear Energy," will
be at 8 p.m. in Bishop Auditorium
of the Graduate School of
Business. The meeting is free and
open to the public.
Sponsor of the event is the
newly formed Stanford
Committee for Environmental
Information, chaired by Dr. John
W. Farquhar, associate professor
of medicine.
Appearing with Dr. Lederberg
on the panel will be Dr. Daniel B.
Luten who will discuss "Energy in
the Future"; Dr. John W. Gofman
who will talk about "Health

Hazards"; and Dr. Dean E.
Abrahamson who will speak on
"Waste Releases —Economics and
Politics."
Dr. Luten is a lecturer in
geography at the University of
California at Berkeley. Dr.
Gofman, who recently created a
controversy by suggesting a
10-fold reduction in present
radiation exposure guidelines for
the population at large, is
professor of medical physics at
the University of California.
Dr. Abrahamson, assistant
professor of anatomy at the
University of Minnesota, is one of
the concerned scientists who
recently laid down a barrage of
criticisms in the press, in public
meetings and in Congress, against
Atomic Energy Commission
regulations to cope with
radioactive wastes from nuclear
power reactors.
