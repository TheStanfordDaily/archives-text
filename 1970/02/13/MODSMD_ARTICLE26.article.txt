						Peep At 'Voyeur' 
### APHLINGO MC NAUGHT 
Tlie Voyeur, by Henry Sutton,
Fawcett Publications,
350 pgs., $ L .25

It is extremely refreshing to
read a bad book with no
pretensions to being any good.
Presumably the publishers felt
that it had some redeeming social
value, because The Voyeur is so
unexciting that it isn't worth
having a lawyer waste his time
defending it.

The story is quite simple: Irvin
Kane (Hugh Heffner) the
publisher of "Tomcat" magazine
(Playboy) is defending his
magazine against the courts. His is
being prosecuted by the magazine
against the courts. His is being
persecuted by the U.S. Attorney
General, Richard Patterson
(Ramsey Clark) who is bucking
for a Supreme Court seat. He is
being defended by Arthur Marx
(probably Melvin Belli, but this
could be disputed), while M.R.

Tyler (J. Edgar Hoover) tries to
wiretap Heffner's (Kane's)
"Tomcat" House.
'Voyeur' has something for
almost everyone - a rape, two
virgins on their honeymoon (they
have to go to a gynecologist the
next day), voyeurism, and plain
old sex. The only elements which
are missing are the lesbian scene,
and child molesting (though there
is a statutory rape.)
But unfortunately its not well
done. The sex scenes aren't
exciting or exotic (the only exotic
thing is Kane's (Heffner's)
penchant for lox pizza.)
Sutton is unable to decide
whether his novel should just be a
rehash of everything Time has
published about Kane (Heffner)
or a dirty book. He seems to have
taken the easy course out by
mixing both, which is shame.
His depiction of Heffner
(Kane) as a voyeur because he first
had enjoyable intercourse after
watching another couple do their
own thing is most certainly an
interesting thesis. Of course the
thesis is nothing more than
interesting, but it would have
been worthwhile to see if he could
have really developed it.
Unfortunately, Sutton doesn't
have the talent to do uplifting sex
scenes which might have made the
book worth spending money on.
So save your money, and buy the
latest issue of Playboy.
