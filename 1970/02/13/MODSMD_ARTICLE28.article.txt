# Ozawa Directs Creative Concerto
## 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Wednesday evening's San
Francisco Symphone, despite a
few uneven moments, turned out
to be a superb example of the
Ozawa style, and the type of
music San Franciscans will be
treated to next season. The
opening work of the evening,
Verdi's "I Vespri Siciliani," is
typical of the empty Italian
operas of the 19th century, the
echos of the roccoco rooms in
which they were presented.
Devoid of plot, they were a
vehicle of extravagant sets and
emotional music, some of which is
occasionally exhumed by
symphony orchestras.
Although 1 am not enamoured
of the style, the Italians do
present a change from the
Germans who most ofter overload
symphony programs. The
orchestra performed the short
work competently, although the
material was not profound.
Brahms' Oedipus Complex
Brahms did not write a
symphony until 1876, when he
was 43, even though he had been
a respected composer for nearly
twenty years. His is clearly a case
for Freudian analysis; when asked
at age 35 why he had not
produced a symphony, he sat
down at the piano and played the
bass line variations from
Beethoven's "Eroica," saying,
"Who can write a symphony with
such footsteps behind him?"
Ruled by the footsteps for
many years, Brahms began a
symphony which he decided to
use as a piano concerto, his first.
Following the assuredness of the
Verdi work, this concerto, with
27-year old Daniel Barenboim as
piano soloist, appeared a piece of
uncertainty and immaturity. The
first movement, especially, was
choppy and uneven, and the
Orchestra had a number of
intonation problems, although the
second and third movements were
somewhat better.
Musical Darwinism
The weaknesses of the first
two works were soon forgotten, as
Maestro Ozawa led the Orchestra
in Bartok's demanding "Concerto
for Orchestra." Every bit of a
director's skill is required to make
this piece successful; into it are
written two hundred years of

concerto development plus
Bartok's special creativity.
The concerto form developed
out of the concerto grosso of the
Pre-Baroque period, in which a
small group of musicians were
opposed to the larger group in
concertante, the juxtaposition of
the two groups giving a medium
much different from the sinlonia
form, in which all the musicians
played together. With Bach, the
form became a vehicle for
virtuoso performance by single
musician.
The first concertos were
written for harpsichord and piano,
instruments not normally
members of the sinfonia. This
made the development of
concertante somewhat easier, for
differences in timbre and range set
these keyboard instruments apart
from the orchestral group. Violin
concertos present additional
problems, for both the early
sinfonia and today's symphony
orchestra are at least half violins,
and separating the soloist from
the group is far more difficult.
Bartok's Unique Contribution
Bartok reversed this evolution
of the concerto. He wrote a piece
of five movements (concerti are
usually in three) of considerable
length in which the concertante is
among sections or the orchestra.
The soloist is the orchestra, and
like peacocks in courting season,
each group displays its finery for
the audience.
We need not choose one
(fortunate for the horns, who
would remain forever celibate);
each section is given a chance to
exhibit its finery. At the
successful closing of the
"Concerto," Ozawa gave
recognition of the soli nature of
the piece by having each section
in turn rise for applause.
It must be the director's skill
which provides the drama in the
"Concerto for Orchestra." The
score must be handled in such a
way as to make full use of
dynamic and tonal contrasts.
Maestro Ozawa has a special
feeling for this type of task; he is
a remarkably sensitive conductor.
I was quite pleased to find that
the Orchestra was able to respond
to Ozawa's direction.
This program will be repeated
tonight at 8:30 p.m. in the War
Memorial Opera House in San
Francisco

small group of musicians were
opposed to the larger group in
concertante, the juxtaposition of
the two groups giving a medium
much different from the sinlonia
form, in which all the musicians
played together. With Bach, the
form became a vehicle for
virtuoso performance by single
musician.
The first concertos were
written for harpsichord and piano,
instruments not normally
members of the sinfonia. This
made the development of
concertante somewhat easier, for
differences in timbre and range set
these keyboard instruments apart
from the orchestral group. Violin
concertos present additional
problems, for both the early
sinfonia and today's symphony
orchestra are at least half violins,
and separating the soloist from
the group is far more difficult.
Bartok's Unique Contribution
Bartok reversed this evolution
of the concerto. He wrote a piece
of five movements (concerti are
usually in three) of considerable
length in which the concertante is
among sections or the orchestra.
The soloist is the orchestra, and
like peacocks in courting season,
each group displays its finery for
the audience.
We need not choose one
(fortunate for the horns, who
would remain forever celibate);
each section is given a chance to
exhibit its finery. At the
successful closing of the
"Concerto," Ozawa gave
recognition of the soli nature of
the piece by having each section
in turn rise for applause.
It must be the director's skill
which provides the drama in the
"Concerto for Orchestra." The
score must be handled in such a
way as to make full use of
dynamic and tonal contrasts.
Maestro Ozawa has a special
feeling for this type of task; he is
a remarkably sensitive conductor.
I was quite pleased to find that
the Orchestra was able to respond
to Ozawa's direction.
This program will be repeated
tonight at 8:30 p.m. in the War
Memorial Opera House in San
Francisco
Wednesday evening's San
Francisco Symphone, despite a
few uneven moments, turned out
to be a superb example of the
Ozawa style, and the type of
music San Franciscans will be
treated to next season. The
opening work of the evening,
Verdi's "I Vespri Siciliani," is
typical of the empty Italian
operas of the 19th century, the
echos of the roccoco rooms in
which they were presented.
Devoid of plot, they were a
vehicle of extravagant sets and
emotional music, some of which is
occasionally exhumed by
symphony orchestras.
Although 1 am not enamoured
of the style, the Italians do
present a change from the
Germans who most ofter overload
symphony programs. The
orchestra performed the short
work competently, although the
material was not profound.
Brahms' Oedipus Complex
Brahms did not write a
symphony until 1876, when he
was 43, even though he had been
a respected composer for nearly
twenty years. His is clearly a case
for Freudian analysis; when asked
at age 35 why he had not
produced a symphony, he sat
down at the piano and played the
bass line variations from
Beethoven's "Eroica," saying,
"Who can write a symphony with
such footsteps behind him?"
Ruled by the footsteps for
many years, Brahms began a
symphony which he decided to
use as a piano concerto, his first.
Following the assuredness of the
Verdi work, this concerto, with
27-year old Daniel Barenboim as
piano soloist, appeared a piece of
uncertainty and immaturity. The
first movement, especially, was
choppy and uneven, and the
Orchestra had a number of
intonation problems, although the
second and third movements were
somewhat better.
Musical Darwinism
The weaknesses of the first
two works were soon forgotten, as
Maestro Ozawa led the Orchestra
in Bartok's demanding "Concerto
for Orchestra." Every bit of a
director's skill is required to make
this piece successful; into it are
written two hundred years of

concerto development plus
Bartok's special creativity.
The concerto form developed
out of the concerto grosso of the
Pre-Baroque period, in which a
small group of musicians were
opposed to the larger group in
concertante, the juxtaposition of
the two groups giving a medium
much different from the sinlonia
form, in which all the musicians
