Strange distributions lead to
strange - and often incredible -
bidding. Everyone was confused
on this particular monstrosity.
East, naturally enough, opened
one heart. South was a little
surprised at the bid - and had to
pass. West wasn't too happy with
his bid of one no trump, but his
hand was too weak to bid two
diamonds.
Now North stuck his nose in.
The fact that he was vulnerable
kept him from preempting the
auction, so he settled for two
clubs. East, with a good hand and
six hearts, felt confident about his
rebid.
This time, South couldn't
resist, and doubled • after all,
partner had shown some strength.
West passed, and North, with a
subminimum overcall, pulled the

double. South was far from
ecstatic about that contract, and
started fishing for a better one.
His three diamond effort got
saved by West, so he then tried
spades.
By this time, his partner
realized what was going on. For
South to do all this bidding after
passing one heart, he must have a
good hand, a heart stack, and
probably a void in clubs. Sensing
the fit, he raised to game.
East couldn't believe this one,
since he knew his side had half the
high-card points. He also was
almost certain that North-South
were in at best a 4-4 fit, since
spades would have been bid earlier
if either of them had five. So he
doubled.
West had a difficult lead. He
was afraid a diamond might ride
into declarer's ace-queen, so he
decided to lead hearts - he figured
that whatever partner's holding
was declarer could finesse it
himself.
He moaned quietly when he
saw dummy, while declarer saw a
glimmer of hope. He cashed two
hearts, pitching dummy's
diamonds, and then led a heart.
West stopped in his tracks. Two
minutes later he ruffed with the
trump king, dummy throwing a
club. Having nothing better to do
(still afraid of a diamond tenace in
South's hand), he led the club
jack.
East wasn't happy when his
ace, covering the king, was ruffed.
South quickly ruffed a diamond
in dummy, cashed the good club,
and then led another club. East
pitched a heart, and declarer

ruffed low. A heart was no#
ruffed in dummy, and anotheJr'
club ruffed in hand, East pitching
his last heart.
But declarer simply ruffed
another heart with the spade
queen, and another club with his
spade ace, as East had to
underruff both times, for his
tenth trick.
East took the last two tricks
with his trumps, and growled at
his partner for the lead.
