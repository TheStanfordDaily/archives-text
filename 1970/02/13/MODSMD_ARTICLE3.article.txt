## Agnew Vs. 'Sophisticates 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) - Vice President
Sprio T. Agnew criticized
yesterday those he called
"supercilious sophisticates" who
favor what he said is called
erroneously "open admissions" to
colleges and universities.
"By some strange madness,"
he said, "we Find the thought
seriously entertained. . . that the
untrained should help choose
those to be trained and that
membership. . . in institutions of
higher learning should be
determined fundamentally by
considerations other than
>titude. . ."
"Of course, the criterion of
competence has in the past
sometimes been honored more in
the breach than in the observance.
But surely that is no reason to
abandon it, as happens when the
concept of what is erroneously
called 'open admissions' makes its
way among some of our
supercilious sophisticates."
He apparently had reference to
demands by activist groups who
want admission without
restrictions and want a voice in

selecting instructors.
Agnew's remarks were made at
a $100-a-plate Lincoln Day
dinner, sponsored by the
Republican party.

KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -
President Nixon took an indirect
stand Thursday for uniform,

Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said
Nixon has no over-all views on
guaranteeing "freedom of choice"
on the schools children attend.
Cairo Factory Hit
(AP) â€” Israeli planes dropped
delayed-fuse bombs and napalm
and strafed a large scrap metal
factory north of Cairo yesterday
killing at least 68 civilian workers
and wounding another 98, Egypt's
military command said.
The possibility of still more
damage in the factory was raised
by an Israeli announcement that

one of its planes might have
accidentally dropped a time bomb
set to explode early today.
Defense Minister Moshe
Dayan, in a telephone call to the
International Red Cross, urged the
Egyptians to find and disarm the
880-pound bomb, which has a
24-hour fuse.
Israel said the plane may have
dropped the bomb by accident
during a raid on military targets at
El Khanqa, a mile to the north of
the factory.
An Egyptian officer said three
time bombs were dropped, and
two exploded an hour after the
raid on the factory described as
the "national company for metal
industry." It is located at Abu
Zabal about 17 miles north of the
Egyptian capital. He said they
were still "searching the place for
possible other time bombs."
An officer guarding the
factory said, "There are more
bodies underneath the wreckage."
The factory lies near the
residential area of El Khanqa and
is surrounded by farms. There are
no military installations that
could be seen nearby Dynan said.
