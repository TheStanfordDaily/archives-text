# Potpourri
## Gallery Displays Recent Purchases 
### BONNIE KOEHLER 
A real potpourri of art awaits
to confront the viewer who enters
the Art Gallery this month -
mixed media, period, mood, and
method. The first works seen, for
example, are an early 20th
century French bronze sculpture,
a large contemporary oil painting,
an 18th century European print,
and an African wood sculpture.
What could unite such a
contrasting and diverse collection
of art into one exhibition? Each
work is one of the recent
acquisitions purchased or
received as gifts by the Stanford
Art Museum over the past year,
January through December 1969.
Strange Mixture
The show provides an
opportunity for the visitor to
make some unusual comparisons.
The oldest and most sig-additions
to the Museum collection shown
on the Gallery are the five
ancient Greek Attic Vases. Richard
Diebenkorn's large oil painting
Windows, of 1967, represents one
of the contemporary works.

Three of my favorite pieces are
the Rodin {graphics - a lithograph
from 1902, and two small pencil
and water color drawings dating
from 1905. Their contour lines
capture the essential motions of
the human figure in a concise but
free and easy fashion. Gaston
Lachaise's Dancing Female, a
larger whimsical pencil sketch, is a
contour drawing of a different
mood.
The black and white print
from 1788, A Horse Frightened
By a Lion, is the work chosen for
the exhibition poster, and is one
of the European prints and
drawings which make up the bulk
of the show. Other prints include
ones by Gericault, Ingres,
Delacroix, and Fragonard.
The Gallery exhibition
contains only part of the art
acquired by the Museum this year
due to limited exhibition space.
Others pieces which have acquired
a permanent place in the Museum
include the large Chinese scroll
painting of 1736, The Night
Market at Yang-Ch'eng, and other

pieces of oriental art. There have
also been several very large oil and
acrylic abstract paintings by
contemporary artists added to the
permanent collection this year
which were too big to show in the
Gallery.
Successful Year
Dr. Francois Forster-Haun,
curator of the Art Museums'
commenting on the Museums
acquisitions, said that "this past
year has been our most fruitful
and successful year."
The extended program of
exhibitions at the Gallery has also

met with increased success this
year. The important shows at the
Gallery, including the Old Masters
Drawing Exhibit, which was the
first major touring show to
originate at Stanford, have
attracted an increasing number of
visitors. During one Sunday
afternoon of the Matisse show last
month there was a record number
of over 200 viewers.
Donations
The Art Museum depends
heavily on gifts and donations for
most of its purchasing. The
Museum receives no financial
support from the University for
acquisitions. The Committee for
Art at Stanford, which is
supplemented largely by its
annual "Treasure Market" benefit
sale in March, makes many
purchases for the Museum.
The very limited funds make it
difficult to build a large
collection. Looking at all the art
works that the Museum now
owns, the curator feels that "the
collections could be strengthened

in any area." Areas of
concentration for this year's
acquisitions centered on 18th and
19th century prints and drawings,
with heavy emphasis on the
French as seen in the Gallery. This
group, now that it has a firm
beginning, will be enlarged in the
future to form a cohesive
collection. Prints and drawings are
very good for a museum like
Stanford because they lend
themselves easily to display.
German Beginnings
This year saw the beginning of
a German prints and drawing
collection of neo-classical and
romantic, with most of the prints
purchased since last June. A
Barocci print acquired this year
started the Italian collection.
Looking forward to future
purchases, the Museum is always
watching for a good example of
something it does not have. What
is purchased depends largely on
what comes up for sale on the art
market. Decisions to buy a work
are made jointly by the museum
curator, its director Dr. Eitner,
and the entire art faculty, with
special consultation by the faculty
member concentrating in the area
of particular work.
Preview
It will be worthwhile to pay a
visit to the Art Gallery (across
from the History Corner)
sometime before March Ist, to
look at the sampling of recent
acquisitions by the Art Museum
and preview the works which will
take permanent places at
Stanford.
Coming shows at the Gallery
include Baroque prints and
drawings, graphics by Robert
Motherwell, and a graduate
student exhibition in the spring.
