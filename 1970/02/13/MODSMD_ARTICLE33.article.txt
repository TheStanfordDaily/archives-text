# A 						New Direction: Athletics As Art
## 
### FRED LEESON 
The office of Dan Millman is a different world
of athletics.
Absent are the customary Stanford banners or
trophies, cliches from the optimist club or
crinkling photographs of teams and individuals
smiling from the past in funny old uniforms.
Instead, there are a couple of art prints and
poetic posters on the walls, a classical guitar in the
corner and an abstract design of a gymnast framed
in an elliptical sphere representing the world.
Against that background Millman looks
intently through his rim-less glasses and starts
explaining about gymnastics, saying that it is
slowly evolving from a sport to a performing art.
"The whole goal of gymnastics," he said, "is to
put on an aesthetic performance—beauty if you
will—purely on body control." The Finest example
of it on campus this year will probably occur
tomorrow night at 7:30 in Encina Pavilion when
Washington and San Jose State meet Stanford.
Title Contenders
The Huskies, who recruit heavily in Japan, are
co-favorites with Cal to win the Pac-8, and
whoever wins the Pac-8 has a good chance at the
NCAA title.
"There's very little likelihood of us even
coming close to Washington," Millman says
frankly, "but the crowd will see some incredible
gymnastics."
Much of it will come from one Yoshi Hayasaki,
perhaps the best gymnast in the nation right now,
who already has a score of 55-plus in the
all-around this year.
That means he's averaging over nine points (10
is perfect) in each of the six events; anything much
over nine is close to NCAA championship quality.
While Hayasaki and his cohorts may be the big
thing tomorrow night, Millman, in his second year
at Stanford, has a team he's proud of, too.
Good Team Now
"I wasn't really pushing for publicity last
year," he says, "but this year we have an exciting
team . . . one definitely worth watching." The
surprising turnout of 400 which viewed the home
opener last month seemed to agree; at four bits for
students, it's a hard bargain to beat.
For the ordinary sports fan who needs a close
score to get his adrenalin going, the Stanford-SJC
match-up looks too close to call. But though
judges still haggle over individual scores (mentally
referring to a 190 page book of details) and tote
up team scores, the trend is more toward
appreciating the beauty of the whole performance,
rather than emphasizing team competition.
"If our score is higher, it means our program
has been more effective, which is a nice feeling,"
Millman says. "But were not 'versing' anybody in

the sense of 'Stanford versus Washington and San
Jose.' We're presenting what we can do, and we'd
like them to score well, too."
Philosophy, Too
There is, in Millman's view, even more to the
sport than its artistic and physical merits.
"Gymnastics is important to me, but it isn't the
main goal of life. I'm trying to build a philosophic
background in gymnastics as a part of building the
total person."
Just what that means to one's developmental
process is difficult to describe, but a spontaneous
talk session among the athletes after one meet that
ran until 4 a.m. seems to indicate some sort of
influence, the coach points out.
While the vision of an ideal gymnast (5-7 say,
and 130 pounds) doesn't immediately conjure up a
picture of strength and toughness, a quick peek at
a practice session indicates otherwise, as bodies
tumble from all heights, landing flush on heads,
necks and backs.
In fact, one of those übiquitious "scientific
studies" has shown that good gymnasts have less
body fat than all other athletes tested, including
such Lough specimens as wrestlers and distance
runners.
"Skin, bone and muscle," is what
Millman—himself the 1964 world champion on the
trampoline —looks for in a gymnast. The flowing,
coordinated grace of competitive performance
gives only a hint of the danger common in
practice.
Granted the sport isn't the greatest national
spectacle, but in areas where people have been
exposed consistently to quality performances
gymnastics does attract good crowds. Penn State
reportedly sells out 5,000 for each home meet;
crowds of 1500-2000 are common at Berkeley.
Forward View
Millman thinks he can bring the same kind of
quality to Stanford. "I feel confident that within a
few years we'll have one of the best teams in the
nation." The fact that Stanford's tuition make
recruiting more difficult than at most state schools
doesn't bother him.
"We definitely can be one of the national
powers," he says, warming up to an example. "Jim
Gaughran did it."
In the meantime, Millman has a product he
thinks the community will enjoy, and it will be on
display in meets with USC and California in the
coming weeks, as well as with the Huskies
tomorrow night.
Even late-comers who miss the soft pre-meet
music will probably agree when they leave that
they didn't see the average Stanford sporting
event.

While Hayasaki and his cohorts may be the big
thing tomorrow night, Millman, in his second year
at Stanford, has a team he's proud of, too.
Good Team Now
"I wasn't really pushing for publicity last
year," he says, "but this year we have an exciting
team . . . one definitely worth watching." The
surprising turnout of 400 which viewed the home
opener last month seemed to agree; at four bits for
students, it's a hard bargain to beat.
For the ordinary sports fan who needs a close
score to get his adrenalin going, the Stanford-SJC
match-up looks too close to call. But though
judges still haggle over individual scores (mentally
referring to a 190 page book of details) and tote
up team scores, the trend is more toward
appreciating the beauty of the whole performance,
rather than emphasizing team competition.
"If our score is higher, it means our program
has been more effective, which is a nice feeling,"
Millman says. "But were not 'versing' anybody in

the sense of 'Stanford versus Washington and San
Jose.' We're presenting what we can do, and we'd
like them to score well, too."
Philosophy, Too
There is, in Millman's view, even more to the
sport than its artistic and physical merits.
"Gymnastics is important to me, but it isn't the
main goal of life. I'm trying to build a philosophic
background in gymnastics as a part of building the
total person."
Just what that means to one's developmental
process is difficult to describe, but a spontaneous
talk session among the athletes after one meet that
ran until 4 a.m. seems to indicate some sort of
influence, the coach points out.
While the vision of an ideal gymnast (5-7 say,
and 130 pounds) doesn't immediately conjure up a
picture of strength and toughness, a quick peek at
a practice session indicates otherwise, as bodies
tumble from all heights, landing flush on heads,
necks and backs.
In fact, one of those übiquitious "scientific
studies" has shown that good gymnasts have less
body fat than all other athletes tested, including
such Lough specimens as wrestlers and distance
runners.
"Skin, bone and muscle," is what
Millman—himself the 1964 world champion on the
trampoline —looks for in a gymnast. The flowing,
coordinated grace of competitive performance
gives only a hint of the danger common in
practice.
Granted the sport isn't the greatest national
spectacle, but in areas where people have been
exposed consistently to quality performances
gymnastics does attract good crowds. Penn State
reportedly sells out 5,000 for each home meet;
crowds of 1500-2000 are common at Berkeley.
Forward View
Millman thinks he can bring the same kind of
quality to Stanford. "I feel confident that within a
few years we'll have one of the best teams in the
nation." The fact that Stanford's tuition make
recruiting more difficult than at most state schools
doesn't bother him.
"We definitely can be one of the national
powers," he says, warming up to an example. "Jim
Gaughran did it."
In the meantime, Millman has a product he
thinks the community will enjoy, and it will be on
display in meets with USC and California in the
coming weeks, as well as with the Huskies
tomorrow night.
Even late-comers who miss the soft pre-meet
music will probably agree when they leave that
they didn't see the average Stanford sporting
event.

The office of Dan Millman is a different world
of athletics.
Absent are the customary Stanford banners or
trophies, cliches from the optimist club or
crinkling photographs of teams and individuals
smiling from the past in funny old uniforms.
Instead, there are a couple of art prints and
poetic posters on the walls, a classical guitar in the
corner and an abstract design of a gymnast framed
in an elliptical sphere representing the world.
Against that background Millman looks
intently through his rim-less glasses and starts
explaining about gymnastics, saying that it is
slowly evolving from a sport to a performing art.
"The whole goal of gymnastics," he said, "is to
put on an aesthetic performance—beauty if you
will—purely on body control." The Finest example
of it on campus this year will probably occur
tomorrow night at 7:30 in Encina Pavilion when
Washington and San Jose State meet Stanford.
Title Contenders
The Huskies, who recruit heavily in Japan, are
co-favorites with Cal to win the Pac-8, and
whoever wins the Pac-8 has a good chance at the
NCAA title.
"There's very little likelihood of us even
coming close to Washington," Millman says
frankly, "but the crowd will see some incredible
gymnastics."
Much of it will come from one Yoshi Hayasaki,
perhaps the best gymnast in the nation right now,
who already has a score of 55-plus in the
all-around this year.
That means he's averaging over nine points (10
is perfect) in each of the six events; anything much
over nine is close to NCAA championship quality.

talk session among the athletes after one meet that
ran until 4 a.m. seems to indicate some sort of
influence, the coach points out.
While the vision of an ideal gymnast (5-7 say,
and 130 pounds) doesn't immediately conjure up a
picture of strength and toughness, a quick peek at
a practice session indicates otherwise, as bodies
tumble from all heights, landing flush on heads,
necks and backs.
In fact, one of those übiquitious "scientific
studies" has shown that good gymnasts have less
body fat than all other athletes tested, including
such Lough specimens as wrestlers and distance
runners.
"Skin, bone and muscle," is what
Millman—himself the 1964 world champion on the
trampoline —looks for in a gymnast. The flowing,
coordinated grace of competitive performance
gives only a hint of the danger common in
practice.
Granted the sport isn't the greatest national
spectacle, but in areas where people have been
exposed consistently to quality performances
gymnastics does attract good crowds. Penn State
reportedly sells out 5,000 for each home meet;
crowds of 1500-2000 are common at Berkeley.
Forward View
Millman thinks he can bring the same kind of
quality to Stanford. "I feel confident that within a
few years we'll have one of the best teams in the
nation." The fact that Stanford's tuition make
recruiting more difficult than at most state schools
doesn't bother him.
"We definitely can be one of the national
powers," he says, warming up to an example. "Jim
Gaughran did it."
In the meantime, Millman has a product he
thinks the community will enjoy, and it will be on
display in meets with USC and California in the
coming weeks, as well as with the Huskies
tomorrow night.
Even late-comers who miss the soft pre-meet
music will probably agree when they leave that
they didn't see the average Stanford sporting
event.

The office of Dan Millman is a different world
of athletics.
Absent are the customary Stanford banners or
trophies, cliches from the optimist club or
crinkling photographs of teams and individuals
smiling from the past in funny old uniforms.
Instead, there are a couple of art prints and
poetic posters on the walls, a classical guitar in the
corner and an abstract design of a gymnast framed
in an elliptical sphere representing the world.
Against that background Millman looks
intently through his rim-less glasses and starts
explaining about gymnastics, saying that it is
slowly evolving from a sport to a performing art.
"The whole goal of gymnastics," he said, "is to
put on an aesthetic performance—beauty if you
will—purely on body control." The Finest example
of it on campus this year will probably occur
tomorrow night at 7:30 in Encina Pavilion when
Washington and San Jose State meet Stanford.
Title Contenders
The Huskies, who recruit heavily in Japan, are
co-favorites with Cal to win the Pac-8, and
whoever wins the Pac-8 has a good chance at the
NCAA title.
"There's very little likelihood of us even
coming close to Washington," Millman says
frankly, "but the crowd will see some incredible
gymnastics."
Much of it will come from one Yoshi Hayasaki,
perhaps the best gymnast in the nation right now,
who already has a score of 55-plus in the
all-around this year.
That means he's averaging over nine points (10
is perfect) in each of the six events; anything much
over nine is close to NCAA championship quality.
While Hayasaki and his cohorts may be the big
thing tomorrow night, Millman, in his second year
at Stanford, has a team he's proud of, too.
Good Team Now
"I wasn't really pushing for publicity last
year," he says, "but this year we have an exciting
team . . . one definitely worth watching." The
surprising turnout of 400 which viewed the home
opener last month seemed to agree; at four bits for
students, it's a hard bargain to beat.
For the ordinary sports fan who needs a close
score to get his adrenalin going, the Stanford-SJC
match-up looks too close to call. But though
judges still haggle over individual scores (mentally
referring to a 190 page book of details) and tote
up team scores, the trend is more toward
appreciating the beauty of the whole performance,
rather than emphasizing team competition.
"If our score is higher, it means our program
has been more effective, which is a nice feeling,"
Millman says. "But were not 'versing' anybody in

the sense of 'Stanford versus Washington and San
Jose.' We're presenting what we can do, and we'd
like them to score well, too."
Philosophy, Too
There is, in Millman's view, even more to the
sport than its artistic and physical merits.
"Gymnastics is important to me, but it isn't the
main goal of life. I'm trying to build a philosophic
background in gymnastics as a part of building the
total person."

process is difficult to describe, but a spontaneous
talk session among the athletes after one meet that
