# Big Weekend For Swimmers
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
The Stanford swimming team
travels today to Los Angeles for
two dual meets with a bunch of
unhappy, smog-plagued, sick
swimmers who are currently
ranked number two and number
four in the nation.
UCLA is unhappy because last
year the Indians beat them 80-30.
USC is unhappy because last year
Stanford ended their 110-meet
winning streak, 57-56. They are
both miserable because neither is
in the Ivy League and both must
face top Stanford freshmen. And
so both would like to share a little
misery with the visiting Indians.
UCLA, currently plagued by
the flu, is led by Olympic and
NCAA champion freestyler Mike
Burton, the latest in a series of
top distance swimmers challenging
the Stanford long-distance squad.
Burton currently ranks third in
nationally-ranked times for the
1000-yd. freestyle, 9:54.5. Burton
is favored in the 1000, but is
expected to swim the 200-yd.
butterfly and 500-yd. freestyle as
well. Should this happen, a tight
race could develop in the 500
between Burton and Stanford's
Tim Broderick or Brent Berk.
An interesting three-way race
in the individual medley is also
anticipated, between John Ferris
and Dave Shilling of Stanford and
UCLA's Carl Thomas. Ferris ranks
third in the nation in this event,
1:57.4; last week, with lingering
effects of flu, Ferrir hit 2:02.1
against Yale, a second's-tenth
faster than Thomas' winning time
against Oregon. Shilling ranks

eighth among the nations
time-leaders (1:59.7), and won
the event (2:00.2) against ale.
(All times quoted here are
effective Feb. 2.)
Diver's Foes Strong
Stanford's divers will meet
their first strong opposition this
season in Gordon Creed, who
placed second and third in the 1-
and 3-meter boards at the 69
Pac-8 Championships. He is joined
by Terry Fitzpatrick, a Foothill
JC transfer who won the Canadian
Outdoor Platform title last
summer. Indian divers Bill Main
and Ted Nichols are undefeated.
Although UCLA's sprint hopes
were busted somewhat with the
loss of Zac Zorn, the Bruins still
have a top sprinter in Fray Heath,
the surprise 100-yd. freestyle
champion of last year's NCAA's.
Against Oregon, Heath swam the
100 in :48.7; against Yale,
Stanford's Bob Jamison won in
:47.9.
Backstroker Fred Haywood is
expected to have little trouble
against Bruins Steve Gentes or
Tod Spieker, and Stanford's top
breaststroke duo of Brian Job and
Dave Shilling are both- favored

over UCLA's Torreey Webb and
Mike Thomas.
Coach Jim Gaughran of
Stanford plans to go with a strong
medley relay, but does not
anticipate a Yale-type upset
against Haywood,Job, Ferris, and
Carey or J amison in this event.
Stanford, ranked second in the
country with 3 80.6, meets an
unranked UCLA squad of Gentes,
Webb, butterflier Glen Hughes,
and Heath, which beat Oregon
with a 3 40.1 clocking.
Stanford will be favored over
fourth-ranked UCLA, but
Gaughran expresses a cautious
optimism about the Bruins, Coach
Bob Horn's best team in years.
"UCLA is kind of sneaky,"
Gaughran says,"and if they
decide to go for this meet, they
can give us as hard a time as
Yale."
USC Ranked Second
Southern California, where
everybody is either a jock or an
athletic supporter, is ranked No. 2
in the nation, primarily based on
last .year's finish in the NCAA's.
Twenty-five hundred screaming
Trojan fans will be hoping for an
SC upset over Stanford. The

sotting, Beverly Hills High School
pool, has typical Los-Angeles
"class": a push of a button, and
the basketball playing floor
dissolves to reveal the swimming
pool.
Starting at center, leading
the elastic Trojans will be yet
another outstanding distance
swimmer, Greg Charlton, who
ranks just behind Burton in the
1000-yd freestyle ratings (9 55.0).
Charlton heads one of the nation's
strongest freestyle lineups,
including distance men Andy
Strenk, Greg Fink, freshman Jim
McConica, and Charlton's brother,
Trevor. In the sprints, nationally
ranked Frank Heckl (1 45.3-200;
21.8-50; 47.5-100) leads a squad
which includes NCAA 50 winner
Dan Frawley, Alan West, and
Mike Weston.
The 200-yd. backstroke should
be a highlight, with Fred
Haywood meeting Mark Mader,
who beat him last year. Stanford's
strengths in this meet should be in
the diving, where Main and
Nichols are expected to defeat
Trojans Bill Fujikawa and Boone
Saunders, and in the breaststroke,
where J ob and Shilling seem to
have a clear edge over SC'sJ ohn
Ludwig.
Despite a poor 3:19.3 clocking
against Oregon, 'SC's freestyle
relay should be tougher than
UCLA's, in Gaughran's opinion.
Should the meet come down to
this last event, however, Gaughran
feels a Stanford victory is
probable.
Washington State's Coach
Doug Gibbs and Santa Clara's
George Haines both predicted that
the Stanford-UCLA dual meet
would be the hardest for both
teams. Gaughran, however, feels
differently.
