# Tribe Hunting For Birds And Beavers
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball team
travels to Oregon this weekend for
a rematch of last weeks games
with Oregon St.and Oregon.
Tonight the Indians will face a
disappointed Oregon State team,
now 8-10 following last weekend's
losses to both Stanford and Cal.
The 71-69 loss to the Cards was
particularly frustrating since Mike
Michel's winning basket was
scored with only one second left
in the game.
The Beavers are led by
seven-foot center Vic Bartolome
who is leading the nation in field
goal percentage hitting at a 68.7
percent rate. Bartolome also leads
the Pac-8 in scoring with a 19.7
average.
Saturday night the Indians,
5-13 on the season, travel over to
Eugene for a game with Oregon
which will be televised in the Bay
Area on Channel 44-KBHK TV.
Stanford will try to avoid the bad
start they had against Oregon last
weekend when they fell behind by

17 points at halftime. The Cards
came back in the second half but
they still lost by 14, 87-73.
If Stanford is to beat Oregon,
their main problem will be
stopping 6-9 center Stan Love.
Love is second in the league in
scoring (17.8) and fifth in
rebounding (9.5), and against the
Tribe he picked up 24 points and
18 rebounds.
Coach Howie Dallmar has
indicated that he will go with his
usual starting five, but he intends
to use 6-6V2 forward Mike Michel
quite a bit. Michel picked up
thirteen points against OSU and
was a major factor in the Indians
upset win. 6-10 center Larry
Rosenzweig, who underwent knee
surgery less than a month ago, will
make the trip, but it is doubtful
that he will see action this
weekend.
While the varsity travels north,
Stanford's freshman team will
play a single game on Saturday
night at 6:00 at Cal State
Hay ward.
