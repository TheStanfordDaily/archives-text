# Belmont Edges Icemen
## 
### 
Following a script which is
becoming all too familiar this
season, Stanford's ice hockey
team dropped a 7-5 contest to the
Belmont hockey club last Tuesday
night. The game was played at
Belmont Iceland.
The newly powerful
Belmonters have added several
players and to become the terror
of the Bay Area Hockey League.
The Indians had the misfortune of
facing them after they'd come off
victories of 19-9 and 14-2,
margins.
Nevertheless, the Cards played
well, and were tied 5-5 midway
through the third period. But bad
breaks and a penalty eventually

beat the Tribe.
Ed Leonard, a second year law
student, excelled for the Indians
with four goals and an assist on
the fifth, a scoring slap shot by
Pat Baldwin. Leonard also got lots
of help from linemates Paul
Tittman and Tom Love. And, as
usual, goalie Gary Aitken played
his usual superlative game,
repeatedly turning back Belmont
threats and keeping Stanford in
the game. He made 50 saves.
The Indians' next two games
are both against Cal. On Tuesday
night the teams meet at Belmont
at 8 p.m. and on Saturday Feb.
21, they collide in their titanic at
the Oakland Coliseum-Arena.
