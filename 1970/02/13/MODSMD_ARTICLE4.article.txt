# 34 Plea 'Nolo Contendere'
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Thirty-four SRI-Hanover
demonstrators entered pleas of
"nolo contendre" to charges
resulting from last spring's
protests. Many are Stanford
students.
The group entered the pleas as
part of an agreement with the
Santa Clara County District
Attorney's office in exchange for
the dropping of other charges
against them It was the largest
number of no contest pleas to be
entered at one time since the trials
began last summer.
James Wolpman, defense
attorney for the demonstrators,
said his clients sought to escape
long trials which might have
resulted in convictions on more
than one charge and heavier
sentences. They now hope to
direct their interests to current
political controversies. He
speculated that the District
Attorney's office hoped to avoid
the expenses of the trials.
An anonymous source told the
Daily that the defendents were
assured that none of them would
receive jail terms. Court observers
believe that the sentences will
consist of fines up to $200 and

perhaps as much as two years of
parole.
l'ne out-of-court deals which
resulted in the pleas filed Tuesday
and Wednesday included dropping
charges of obstructing free
passage, disturbing the peace,
inciting to riot and malicious
mischief in return for a no contest
plea to failure to disperse.
Judge Edward Scoyeb will
impose sentence on the 34
demonstrators at 2 p.m., March
19, 26, and April 2.
Four of the protesters entered
no contest pleas to two charges
apiece. They were Alan Fanning,
unlawful assembly and criminal
tresspass; and Burton A.
Richardson, Ghomas R. Stokes
and Jeffrey C. Kitchen who
entered pleas to unlawful

assembly and obstructing free
passage.
Entering pleas of no contest to
one charge were: Marjorie Briggs
Young, obstructing free passage;
Nan Goldie, malicious mischief;
Patrick Silva and Jim Russell,
failure to disperse; Elliot
Andalman, Ann Claudia Bauer,

Thirty-four SRI-Hanover
demonstrators entered pleas of
"nolo contendre" to charges
resulting from last spring's
protests. Many are Stanford
students.
The group entered the pleas as
part of an agreement with the
Santa Clara County District
Attorney's office in exchange for
the dropping of other charges
against them It was the largest
number of no contest pleas to be
entered at one time since the trials
began last summer.
James Wolpman, defense
attorney for the demonstrators,
said his clients sought to escape
long trials which might have
resulted in convictions on more
than one charge and heavier
sentences. They now hope to
direct their interests to current
political controversies. He
speculated that the District
Attorney's office hoped to avoid
the expenses of the trials.
An anonymous source told the
Daily that the defendents were
assured that none of them would
receive jail terms. Court observers
believe that the sentences will
consist of fines up to $200 and

perhaps as much as two years of
parole.
l'ne out-of-court deals which
resulted in the pleas filed Tuesday
and Wednesday included dropping
charges of obstructing free
passage, disturbing the peace,
inciting to riot and malicious
mischief in return for a no contest
plea to failure to disperse.
Judge Edward Scoyeb will
impose sentence on the 34
demonstrators at 2 p.m., March
19, 26, and April 2.
Four of the protesters entered
no contest pleas to two charges
apiece. They were Alan Fanning,
unlawful assembly and criminal
tresspass; and Burton A.
Richardson, Ghomas R. Stokes
and Jeffrey C. Kitchen who
entered pleas to unlawful

assembly and obstructing free
passage.
