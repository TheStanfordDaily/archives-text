# APO Dance
## 
### 
Zeta chapter of Alpha Phi
Omega, the national service
fraternity, will provide a new type
of service to the campus tonight -
a dance. To be held in the
Donner dining room, the dance
will hopefully provide a
much-needed variety of weekend
entertainment. Proceeds from the
affair (men 50c) will be donated
by Alpha Phi Omega to S.H.O.P.
(Students Helping Other People),
the bay-wide organization that
initiated last spring's fund-raising
drive for Susan Bartolomei.
