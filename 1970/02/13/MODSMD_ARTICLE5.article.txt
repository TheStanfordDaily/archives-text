# WLF Presents Petitions
## Child Care Birthday 
### JANE CORRIGAN 
President Kenneth Pitzer was
one of the guests yesterday at a
birthday party held conveniently
in front of his office in the Inner
Quad by Women's Liberation.
Approximately 60 young
children and 150 adults attended
the party celebrating the women's
dream of a free, University
-financed community child care
center. Pitzer, who had received a
special invitation to the event,
arrived with Bill Wyman, special
assistant to the president, just
before the birthday cake was
served. "Happy Birthday, Child
Care Center" was sung before the
children blew out the candles on
the cakes.
Sue Floris, a member of
Women's Liberation, presented
Pitzer with petitions containing
nearly 800 signatures in support
of the child care center which the
organization has been circulating

for the past few weeks. The
president commented that he
would receive the petitions, but
wouldn't be obligated to sign one.
The principle issues concerning
the creation of the child care
center at this point are the
location of the center and its
financing. Women's Liberation is
asking for space for the Center in
the Stanford Elementary School
building which should be vacated
at the end of the current school
year. Woman's Lib is also
demanding that the center be
entirely financed and supported
by the University as a part of its
responsibility to its faculty and
staff employees, and its students.
Pitzer said that the future use
of the school building is currently
being investigated by a
subcommittee of the Housing
Committee, headed by David
Kennedy. Pitzer said he is
encouraging the committee to
look favorably on the possibility
of using the building for a day
care center. "However, there are
other possibilities which the
committee must consider."
Decision Expected Soon
Kennedy's group is expected
to announce its findings fairly
soon. "Certainly, the decision will
be made in a prompt and orderly
manner. We expect to have their
recommendation in good time for
thorough consideration."
The question of financial
arrangements poses the greatest
problem. In Pitzer's view, the
university should not be
responsible for the entire cost of
the center. "The university has a
responsibility to try to assist in
making the arrangements possible.
But to try to provide it would be
overly paternalistic, and would
consistute an excessive
committment of resources.
"It's one thing to help make
arrangements on a convenient and

fair basis, and quite another to
provide it (a center) for free," he
said.
'It's Quite A Party'
While Pitzer was speaking with
newsmen and WLF members, the
younger guests at the party were
engaged in a variety of other
a c tivities—drawing on the
sidewalks with colored chalk,
playing "Ring Around the Rosy,"
and riding bicycles and tractors
around the Inner Quad. Petitions
were being circulated, and various
posters, both drawings by the
children and Liberation posters,
were taped to Pitzer's office door.
Pitzer commented, "It's quite a
party."
The party had been preceded
by a rally held at noon in White
Plaza. Carrie Sapir spoke to the
crowd of about 50 about the goals
of Women's Liberation and the
history of the woman's role in the
United States. She stressed that
both men and women are
victimized by the capitalist
economic system, which she said
limits the meaningful role
alternatives available. She added
that the way to change the
situation is to change the system
by cultural and economic
revolution.
Glenda Jones spoke next and
said that the reason the party was
held on Feb. 12 was that
Lincoln's Birthday is a school
holiday but not a work holiday,
which she said highlights the
problem of working mothers who
must either find a babysitter for
their children or stay home
themselves. The university should
help remedy this situation by
providing the space for a day care
center by maintaining the
building, and by providing
insurance, she added. "We're not
trying to set up a private school.
We're just people who have a
need."
