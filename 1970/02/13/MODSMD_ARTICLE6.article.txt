# Finances: 'Irregular'
## Senate Orders Investigation 
### TINA COOPER 
After extended debate, the
Student Senate last night formed a
special committee to investigate
alleged financial irregularities in
the ASSU Financial Office and in
the Students' Organization Fund
(SOF).
The committee was formed in
answer to charges in the Arena
that spending procedure in the
ASSU is inefficient and
irresponsible. Senator Eckhart
Schultz led the move to check the
validity of those charges.
"I don't want to have a
witch-hunt in the Senate," he
said, "but we have to find out
what's happening quickly."
Financial Manager David Swift
was reluctant to discuss the
alleged irregularities last night on
the Senate floor, saying
"Anything I say will probably be
used against me."
The action of the Publications
Board in repealing its rules
requiring Board approval for
on-campus publications was also
discussed.
Tom Dawson, Publications
Board chairman, also asked the
Senate to change its by-laws
requiring official approval for

publications.
Dawson was questioned by
several Senators regarding the
reason for the Board's action.
Senator Frank Philpot, a

member of the Board, answered.
"Banning newspapers," he
observed, "is just not a popular
cause anymore.
"Besides, if we tried to ban the

Arena, we would be putting ourselves
on the weak end of a bad political
fight."
The move to change the
by-laws was referred to the
. By-Laws Committee.
The Senate went on to pass,
almost without debate, a
resolution to request that the
Stanford shares of stock in
General Motors be voted, in
accordance with a move by Ralph
Nader, to restrict automobile
exhaust causing air pollution.
"We're trying to set a
precedent, to show other people
and organizations that there is an
alternative to just voting straight
GM policy," said the resolution's
sponsor, Ed Nelson.
"The University's prestige
should give pause to people."
A copy of the resolution will
be sent to Nader.
At the end of a long evening,
the Senate, finishing its budget,
gave the Asian Students' Alliance
$2,6 20; Volunteers in Asia
$3,000, and The Company $650.
