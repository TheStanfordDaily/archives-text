Charges and countercharges
filled the air yesterday in the
wake of the latest Arena article
concerning student financial
manager David Swift.
The Arena article alleged that
the auditing firm of Lybrand,
Ross, and Montgomery refused to
sign a statement certifying the
books of the ASSU because "the
books were not in condition to be
audited in October. . .the fact that
there were 'unrecorded items' was
one of the reasons the firm
refused to sign."
In reply, Swift said yesterday
that the reason the books were
not ready in October was that the
office manager at that time,
Roberta Longhi, quit suddenly,
failing to prepare the books. Swift
added that he doesn't handle the
books, but that the office
manager and bookkeeper are
supposed to get them ready.
Swift further maintained that
the books are now ready, and the
ASSU has been trying to get the
auditors to compiete the audit.
The section of the books about
publications has already been
certified.
The article goes on to maintain
that during last summer, Swift
was paid a salary of $125 per

month to act as Student Financial
Manager, but also worked in the
bowling alley, and hired Lynn
McFarland "to do his work for
him," at the rate of $1.65 per
hour.
Swift told the Daily that Miss
McFarland was hired to do regular
filing work, and was authorized to
sign non-controversial documents.
Miss McFarland could not be
reached for comment last night.
He also said that he felt that he
spent time comensurate with his
salary for the summer, and often
handled office business at the
bowling alley.
