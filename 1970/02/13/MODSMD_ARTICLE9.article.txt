## ROTC And Academic Independence 
### Phil Goldsmith 
A year ago yesterday the majority of the Ad Hoc Academic Senate
committee on ROTC announced that ". . . aspects of the present
ROTC .. . make(s) (it) objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University."
Last month, following the Academic Senate's change of mind over
the ROTC credit question, Dr. Pitzer, in a news conference, stated,
"One of the major problems, clearly, that the university faces is a sort
of lack of confidence of the outside community. I think we need to
restore this confidence so that the University can have the financial
and general support to carry on the duties it should in the coming
year . . . But this does not mean there should be compromise when
clear academic principles are involved."
He then attempted to justify the ROTC decision by stating, "This
(ROTC) is one area in which all sorts of friends of the University are
concerned. So, I thought that if it was possible to compromise with
these groups it was best to do so."
What once was incompatible because of "clear academic
principles ' is no longer. The question that arises is whether ROTC has
substantially changed in its incompatible aspects or whether, with the
financial pressures resulting from government funding cutbacks, the
university decided it could not afford to alienate the rich, conservative
alumni who were threatening to reorder their philanthropic priorities.
Re-examination
I will attempt to answer this question by re-examining the
majority report of last year's ROTC committee and their objections to
ROTC. Before I do, I should explain what my analysis will not include
and why.
1 will not concur with the New Moratorium's belief that ROTC's
relationship to the Vietnamese war is the only relevant consideration
in debates about its relationship with Stanford. This contention,
among other things, would make academic credit for courses
dependent on the uses to which knowledge gained in them will.be put.
Suppose, by some miracle, Nixon renounces imperialism today and
immediately withdraws all our troops from foreign lands. And
suppose that Canada, seeking to annex territory, then launches an
unprovoked attack on this country. We respond purely defensively.
The logical position of the New Moratorium would be to urge the
resumption of credit for ROTC, perhaps even for the non-academic
courses teaching future soldiers how to march and salute according to
military standards.
The dangers in the New Moratorium position are two fold. It
would re-establish the university in loco parentis, making moral
judgments for its post-adolescent children, and it would end the
organization of the university according to academic criteria. If
Stanford is to remain something more than a filling station for the
"commendable" moral requirements of the outside world, one year
only ecology, the next only black studies, it surely can't adopt the
New Moratorium's reasoning.
Loss of Independence
The chief academic objection to granting credit to ROTC courses
is that it causes the university to lose some of its independence and to
suspend some of its academic principles. These things occur because

the military services appoint their own faculty (with the university's
consent) and reserve the right to reassign them at any time, because
the primary commitment of the ROTC faculty is to the goals of the
military and because the primary function of the courses is to train
men for their future employer, the military.
Since the military gives the university a list from which ROTC
faculty will be chosen and maintains the right to reassign the faculty,
the academic principle of faculty-administration search to fill teaching
vacancies is violated, the university has little control over the quality
of the ROTC faculty and normal procedures to insure that faculty will
be able to teach controversial positions without fearing for their job
are waived.
The fact that ROTC instructors, by law, are committed primarily
to the US government rather than to Stanford produces a serious and
unavoidable conflict of interest. As the ROTC committee noted last
year, other conflict of interest situations arise, but those deal with
individuals rather than with an entire group (and, by extention,
courses offered by members of the group) and, in the other cases, the
primary commitment is to the university.
In this unique circumstance the instructor has intellectual
restraints explicitly imposed on him by an outside body, the
Department of Defense, which periodically reviews his courses to
examine their scope, coverage and content.
Designed for Military Training
Even more antithetical to the university's academic principles is
the fact that the courses are primarily designed to train men to serve
in the military. This, concluded the ROTC committee, "legally and
ethically obligate(s)" the instructors "to present their course material
from a restricted point of view..." This is far different from
professional training (such as law or medicine) where the faculty
members are competent in the profession but are employees of the
university and teach according to academic rather than business
standards.
The ROTC committee also objected to contrasts between the
students and the military because they infringe upon the university's
power to create its own academic and conduct standards for students
and frequently imply, in their personal conduct sections, that students
could be punished for participating in legitimate intellectual inquiry if
the military does not approve.
These were the reasons which led the ROTC committee last year
to conclude ROTC was "not compatible with the university." Did any
of them substantially change over the past year? Not once.
Thus, at least for the Academic Senate, I think we can safely
conclude that the sanctity of academic principles is intimately
connected with their political and economic implications.
Three Options
Very shortly, the ROTC issue will be voted upon by the Academic
Council. They essentially have three options:
1) They can decide that the academic principles violated by ROTC
are not so essential, but that the neutrality of the university is. This
would mean the Committee on Undergraduate Studies would be
instructed to give academic credit to courses with academic content

offered by any employee-training program—whether the course be
black urban politics with specific emphasis on revolutionary action
taught by a Black Panther or electrical engineering principles as used
in Hewlett-Packard work taught by an H-P engineer. Needless to say,
this is unlikely.
2) They can affirm the academic sell-out of the Senate.
3) They can show that they still hold academic principles and
reject the Senate's decision.
The last course carries with it certain risks, essentially financie!.
The university may lose some substantial contributions if it adopts an
"anti-ROTC" policy. The Council members might, however, consider
that Stanford's current financial crisis resulted from its incorrectly
assuming, in its long-range fiscal planning, that the government
continually would increase research funding. During the last twenty
years, as university operations slowly became more and more
dependent on federal money, everyone enjoyed the benefits but no
one questioned what implications they would have for the
independent status of the university.
Should Independence be Waived?
Again the university is faced with a situation where many urge that
a strict maintenance of the university's independence and of academic
principles be waived because, in the short run, that will make things
easier. But if the Academic Council decides to uphold the Academic
Senate's decision, it very well may cause the univerity, in some future
time, to face a crisis as severe as the preserit one.
Furthermore, it will prove to the students what many have
suggested previously, that the university, instead of holding a policy
of neutrality towards events outside, strongly favors the status quo.
And that would force students working for social change to consider
the university one of their adversaries.
The students are waiting for the Academic Council vote to decide
whether academicians are men guided by principles or men guided by
economics and politics.

the academic principle of faculty-administration search to fill teaching
vacancies is violated, the university has little control over the quality
of the ROTC faculty and normal procedures to insure that faculty will
be able to teach controversial positions without fearing for their job
are waived.
The fact that ROTC instructors, by law, are committed primarily
to the US government rather than to Stanford produces a serious and
unavoidable conflict of interest. As the ROTC committee noted last
year, other conflict of interest situations arise, but those deal with
individuals rather than with an entire group (and, by extention,
courses offered by members of the group) and, in the other cases, the
primary commitment is to the university.
In this unique circumstance the instructor has intellectual
restraints explicitly imposed on him by an outside body, the
Department of Defense, which periodically reviews his courses to
examine their scope, coverage and content.
Designed for Military Training
Even more antithetical to the university's academic principles is
the fact that the courses are primarily designed to train men to serve
in the military. This, concluded the ROTC committee, "legally and
ethically obligate(s)" the instructors "to present their course material
from a restricted point of view..." This is far different from
professional training (such as law or medicine) where the faculty
members are competent in the profession but are employees of the
university and teach according to academic rather than business
standards.
The ROTC committee also objected to contrasts between the
students and the military because they infringe upon the university's
power to create its own academic and conduct standards for students
and frequently imply, in their personal conduct sections, that students
could be punished for participating in legitimate intellectual inquiry if
the military does not approve.
These were the reasons which led the ROTC committee last year
to conclude ROTC was "not compatible with the university." Did any
of them substantially change over the past year? Not once.
Thus, at least for the Academic Senate, I think we can safely
conclude that the sanctity of academic principles is intimately
connected with their political and economic implications.
Three Options
Very shortly, the ROTC issue will be voted upon by the Academic
Council. They essentially have three options:
1) They can decide that the academic principles violated by ROTC
are not so essential, but that the neutrality of the university is. This
would mean the Committee on Undergraduate Studies would be
instructed to give academic credit to courses with academic content

offered by any employee-training program—whether the course be
black urban politics with specific emphasis on revolutionary action
taught by a Black Panther or electrical engineering principles as used
in Hewlett-Packard work taught by an H-P engineer. Needless to say,
this is unlikely.
2) They can affirm the academic sell-out of the Senate.
3) They can show that they still hold academic principles and
reject the Senate's decision.
The last course carries with it certain risks, essentially financie!.
The university may lose some substantial contributions if it adopts an
"anti-ROTC" policy. The Council members might, however, consider
that Stanford's current financial crisis resulted from its incorrectly
assuming, in its long-range fiscal planning, that the government
continually would increase research funding. During the last twenty
years, as university operations slowly became more and more
dependent on federal money, everyone enjoyed the benefits but no
one questioned what implications they would have for the
independent status of the university.
Should Independence be Waived?
Again the university is faced with a situation where many urge that
a strict maintenance of the university's independence and of academic
principles be waived because, in the short run, that will make things
easier. But if the Academic Council decides to uphold the Academic
Senate's decision, it very well may cause the univerity, in some future
time, to face a crisis as severe as the preserit one.
Furthermore, it will prove to the students what many have
suggested previously, that the university, instead of holding a policy
of neutrality towards events outside, strongly favors the status quo.
And that would force students working for social change to consider
the university one of their adversaries.
The students are waiting for the Academic Council vote to decide
whether academicians are men guided by principles or men guided by
economics and politics.

A year ago yesterday the majority of the Ad Hoc Academic Senate
committee on ROTC announced that ". . . aspects of the present
ROTC .. . make(s) (it) objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University."
Last month, following the Academic Senate's change of mind over
the ROTC credit question, Dr. Pitzer, in a news conference, stated,
"One of the major problems, clearly, that the university faces is a sort
of lack of confidence of the outside community. I think we need to
restore this confidence so that the University can have the financial
and general support to carry on the duties it should in the coming
year . . . But this does not mean there should be compromise when
clear academic principles are involved."
He then attempted to justify the ROTC decision by stating, "This
(ROTC) is one area in which all sorts of friends of the University are
concerned. So, I thought that if it was possible to compromise with
these groups it was best to do so."
What once was incompatible because of "clear academic
principles ' is no longer. The question that arises is whether ROTC has
substantially changed in its incompatible aspects or whether, with the
financial pressures resulting from government funding cutbacks, the
university decided it could not afford to alienate the rich, conservative
alumni who were threatening to reorder their philanthropic priorities.
Re-examination
I will attempt to answer this question by re-examining the
majority report of last year's ROTC committee and their objections to
ROTC. Before I do, I should explain what my analysis will not include
and why.
1 will not concur with the New Moratorium's belief that ROTC's
relationship to the Vietnamese war is the only relevant consideration
in debates about its relationship with Stanford. This contention,
among other things, would make academic credit for courses
dependent on the uses to which knowledge gained in them will.be put.
Suppose, by some miracle, Nixon renounces imperialism today and
immediately withdraws all our troops from foreign lands. And
suppose that Canada, seeking to annex territory, then launches an
unprovoked attack on this country. We respond purely defensively.
The logical position of the New Moratorium would be to urge the
resumption of credit for ROTC, perhaps even for the non-academic
courses teaching future soldiers how to march and salute according to
military standards.
The dangers in the New Moratorium position are two fold. It
would re-establish the university in loco parentis, making moral
judgments for its post-adolescent children, and it would end the
organization of the university according to academic criteria. If
Stanford is to remain something more than a filling station for the
"commendable" moral requirements of the outside world, one year
only ecology, the next only black studies, it surely can't adopt the
New Moratorium's reasoning.
Loss of Independence
The chief academic objection to granting credit to ROTC courses
is that it causes the university to lose some of its independence and to
suspend some of its academic principles. These things occur because

the military services appoint their own faculty (with the university's
consent) and reserve the right to reassign them at any time, because
the primary commitment of the ROTC faculty is to the goals of the
military and because the primary function of the courses is to train
men for their future employer, the military.
Since the military gives the university a list from which ROTC
faculty will be chosen and maintains the right to reassign the faculty,
the academic principle of faculty-administration search to fill teaching
vacancies is violated, the university has little control over the quality

Again the university is faced with a situation where many urge that
a strict maintenance of the university's independence and of academic
principles be waived because, in the short run, that will make things
easier. But if the Academic Council decides to uphold the Academic
Senate's decision, it very well may cause the univerity, in some future
time, to face a crisis as severe as the preserit one.
Furthermore, it will prove to the students what many have
suggested previously, that the university, instead of holding a policy
of neutrality towards events outside, strongly favors the status quo.
And that would force students working for social change to consider
the university one of their adversaries.
The students are waiting for the Academic Council vote to decide
whether academicians are men guided by principles or men guided by
economics and politics.

A year ago yesterday the majority of the Ad Hoc Academic Senate
committee on ROTC announced that ". . . aspects of the present
ROTC .. . make(s) (it) objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University."
Last month, following the Academic Senate's change of mind over
the ROTC credit question, Dr. Pitzer, in a news conference, stated,
"One of the major problems, clearly, that the university faces is a sort
of lack of confidence of the outside community. I think we need to
restore this confidence so that the University can have the financial
and general support to carry on the duties it should in the coming
year . . . But this does not mean there should be compromise when
clear academic principles are involved."
He then attempted to justify the ROTC decision by stating, "This
(ROTC) is one area in which all sorts of friends of the University are
concerned. So, I thought that if it was possible to compromise with
these groups it was best to do so."
What once was incompatible because of "clear academic
principles ' is no longer. The question that arises is whether ROTC has
substantially changed in its incompatible aspects or whether, with the
financial pressures resulting from government funding cutbacks, the
university decided it could not afford to alienate the rich, conservative
alumni who were threatening to reorder their philanthropic priorities.
Re-examination
I will attempt to answer this question by re-examining the
majority report of last year's ROTC committee and their objections to
ROTC. Before I do, I should explain what my analysis will not include
and why.
1 will not concur with the New Moratorium's belief that ROTC's
relationship to the Vietnamese war is the only relevant consideration
in debates about its relationship with Stanford. This contention,
among other things, would make academic credit for courses
dependent on the uses to which knowledge gained in them will.be put.
Suppose, by some miracle, Nixon renounces imperialism today and
immediately withdraws all our troops from foreign lands. And
suppose that Canada, seeking to annex territory, then launches an
unprovoked attack on this country. We respond purely defensively.
The logical position of the New Moratorium would be to urge the
resumption of credit for ROTC, perhaps even for the non-academic
courses teaching future soldiers how to march and salute according to
military standards.
The dangers in the New Moratorium position are two fold. It
would re-establish the university in loco parentis, making moral
judgments for its post-adolescent children, and it would end the
organization of the university according to academic criteria. If
Stanford is to remain something more than a filling station for the
"commendable" moral requirements of the outside world, one year
only ecology, the next only black studies, it surely can't adopt the
New Moratorium's reasoning.
Loss of Independence
The chief academic objection to granting credit to ROTC courses
is that it causes the university to lose some of its independence and to
suspend some of its academic principles. These things occur because

the military services appoint their own faculty (with the university's
consent) and reserve the right to reassign them at any time, because
the primary commitment of the ROTC faculty is to the goals of the
military and because the primary function of the courses is to train
men for their future employer, the military.
Since the military gives the university a list from which ROTC
faculty will be chosen and maintains the right to reassign the faculty,
the academic principle of faculty-administration search to fill teaching
vacancies is violated, the university has little control over the quality
of the ROTC faculty and normal procedures to insure that faculty will
be able to teach controversial positions without fearing for their job
are waived.
The fact that ROTC instructors, by law, are committed primarily
to the US government rather than to Stanford produces a serious and
unavoidable conflict of interest. As the ROTC committee noted last
year, other conflict of interest situations arise, but those deal with
individuals rather than with an entire group (and, by extention,
courses offered by members of the group) and, in the other cases, the
primary commitment is to the university.
In this unique circumstance the instructor has intellectual
restraints explicitly imposed on him by an outside body, the
Department of Defense, which periodically reviews his courses to
examine their scope, coverage and content.
Designed for Military Training
Even more antithetical to the university's academic principles is
the fact that the courses are primarily designed to train men to serve
in the military. This, concluded the ROTC committee, "legally and
ethically obligate(s)" the instructors "to present their course material
from a restricted point of view..." This is far different from
professional training (such as law or medicine) where the faculty
members are competent in the profession but are employees of the
university and teach according to academic rather than business
standards.
The ROTC committee also objected to contrasts between the
students and the military because they infringe upon the university's
power to create its own academic and conduct standards for students
and frequently imply, in their personal conduct sections, that students
could be punished for participating in legitimate intellectual inquiry if
the military does not approve.
These were the reasons which led the ROTC committee last year
to conclude ROTC was "not compatible with the university." Did any
of them substantially change over the past year? Not once.
Thus, at least for the Academic Senate, I think we can safely
conclude that the sanctity of academic principles is intimately
connected with their political and economic implications.
Three Options
Very shortly, the ROTC issue will be voted upon by the Academic
Council. They essentially have three options:
1) They can decide that the academic principles violated by ROTC
are not so essential, but that the neutrality of the university is. This
would mean the Committee on Undergraduate Studies would be
instructed to give academic credit to courses with academic content

offered by any employee-training program—whether the course be
black urban politics with specific emphasis on revolutionary action
taught by a Black Panther or electrical engineering principles as used
in Hewlett-Packard work taught by an H-P engineer. Needless to say,
this is unlikely.
2) They can affirm the academic sell-out of the Senate.
3) They can show that they still hold academic principles and
reject the Senate's decision.
The last course carries with it certain risks, essentially financie!.
The university may lose some substantial contributions if it adopts an
"anti-ROTC" policy. The Council members might, however, consider
that Stanford's current financial crisis resulted from its incorrectly
assuming, in its long-range fiscal planning, that the government
continually would increase research funding. During the last twenty
years, as university operations slowly became more and more
dependent on federal money, everyone enjoyed the benefits but no
one questioned what implications they would have for the
independent status of the university.
Should Independence be Waived?

a strict maintenance of the university's independence and of academic

"commendable" moral requirements of the outside world, one year
only ecology, the next only black studies, it surely can't adopt the
New Moratorium's reasoning.
Loss of Independence
The chief academic objection to granting credit to ROTC courses
is that it causes the university to lose some of its independence and to
suspend some of its academic principles. These things occur because

the military services appoint their own faculty (with the university's
consent) and reserve the right to reassign them at any time, because
the primary commitment of the ROTC faculty is to the goals of the
military and because the primary function of the courses is to train
men for their future employer, the military.
Since the military gives the university a list from which ROTC
faculty will be chosen and maintains the right to reassign the faculty,
the academic principle of faculty-administration search to fill teaching
vacancies is violated, the university has little control over the quality
of the ROTC faculty and normal procedures to insure that faculty will
be able to teach controversial positions without fearing for their job
are waived.
The fact that ROTC instructors, by law, are committed primarily
to the US government rather than to Stanford produces a serious and
unavoidable conflict of interest. As the ROTC committee noted last
year, other conflict of interest situations arise, but those deal with
individuals rather than with an entire group (and, by extention,
courses offered by members of the group) and, in the other cases, the
primary commitment is to the university.
In this unique circumstance the instructor has intellectual
restraints explicitly imposed on him by an outside body, the
Department of Defense, which periodically reviews his courses to
examine their scope, coverage and content.
Designed for Military Training
Even more antithetical to the university's academic principles is
the fact that the courses are primarily designed to train men to serve
in the military. This, concluded the ROTC committee, "legally and
ethically obligate(s)" the instructors "to present their course material
from a restricted point of view..." This is far different from
professional training (such as law or medicine) where the faculty
members are competent in the profession but are employees of the
university and teach according to academic rather than business
standards.
The ROTC committee also objected to contrasts between the
students and the military because they infringe upon the university's
power to create its own academic and conduct standards for students
and frequently imply, in their personal conduct sections, that students
could be punished for participating in legitimate intellectual inquiry if
the military does not approve.
These were the reasons which led the ROTC committee last year
to conclude ROTC was "not compatible with the university." Did any
of them substantially change over the past year? Not once.
Thus, at least for the Academic Senate, I think we can safely
conclude that the sanctity of academic principles is intimately
connected with their political and economic implications.
Three Options
Very shortly, the ROTC issue will be voted upon by the Academic
Council. They essentially have three options:
1) They can decide that the academic principles violated by ROTC
are not so essential, but that the neutrality of the university is. This
would mean the Committee on Undergraduate Studies would be
instructed to give academic credit to courses with academic content

offered by any employee-training program—whether the course be
black urban politics with specific emphasis on revolutionary action
taught by a Black Panther or electrical engineering principles as used
in Hewlett-Packard work taught by an H-P engineer. Needless to say,
this is unlikely.
2) They can affirm the academic sell-out of the Senate.
3) They can show that they still hold academic principles and
reject the Senate's decision.
The last course carries with it certain risks, essentially financie!.
The university may lose some substantial contributions if it adopts an
"anti-ROTC" policy. The Council members might, however, consider
that Stanford's current financial crisis resulted from its incorrectly
assuming, in its long-range fiscal planning, that the government
continually would increase research funding. During the last twenty
years, as university operations slowly became more and more
dependent on federal money, everyone enjoyed the benefits but no
one questioned what implications they would have for the
independent status of the university.
Should Independence be Waived?
Again the university is faced with a situation where many urge that
a strict maintenance of the university's independence and of academic
principles be waived because, in the short run, that will make things
easier. But if the Academic Council decides to uphold the Academic
Senate's decision, it very well may cause the univerity, in some future
time, to face a crisis as severe as the preserit one.
Furthermore, it will prove to the students what many have
suggested previously, that the university, instead of holding a policy
of neutrality towards events outside, strongly favors the status quo.
And that would force students working for social change to consider
the university one of their adversaries.
The students are waiting for the Academic Council vote to decide
whether academicians are men guided by principles or men guided by
economics and politics.
