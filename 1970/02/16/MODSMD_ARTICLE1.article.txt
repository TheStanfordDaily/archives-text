# Master Plan
## Hospital Report Due 
### 
Planning for a 25-year "master
plan" for Stanford University
Hospital expansion is nearing its
end, according to hospital director
Dr. Thomas Gonda.
In an interview with the Palo
Alto Times, Dr. Gonda said that
the hospital report was about two
months from completion. When
finished the report will be
submitted to other University
officials, trustees, and if adopted,
financing will be sought.
As now seen, the expansion will
entail building twin towers,
increasing hospital capicity by
over 400 beds.
Dr. Gonda said that if
construction costs continue to
spiral as they have over the last
few years, the project could cost
as much as $1 per square inch by
the end of the 25-year period.
Even a small immediate first phase
expansion, which could be built
within three years if financing
were found and construction
proceeded at a maximum rate,
could cost from $4 million to $6
million.
Dr. Gonda criticized the Palo
Alio Times story of last Friday.
He said that the headline is
misleading. The headline said:
"Stanford unveils major hospital
expansion." Dr. Gonda
emphasized that the information
is "a progress and status of
planning".
Financing A Problem
The expansion has been
planned for many months and the
hospital is now working out
details with an architect. The
hospital is now getting close to
the final plan of the hospital but
then the report must go through
University committees and the
trustees. At any time the report
can be modified, the director said.
"Financing is a major
problem," Dr. Gonda said. And a
concerted effort to find that
money will be attempted after
final approval of the trustees.
The hospital is currently at its
seasonal capacity. "We just
couldn't be fuller," said Dr.
Gonda. Although the hospital gets
close to this level only about two
months of the year, expansion is
felt necessary. Dr. Gonda said that
if there were more beds in the
hospital, many would be filled at
this time.
The capacity of the hospital is
577 patients and 633 total beds,
including basinettes for newborn
babies.
Community Guarantee Met
The hospital guarantees that
370 beds will be available to the
Palo Alto community. This has
always been met, according to Dr.
Gonda.
On Thursday, 234 Stanford
patients were in the hospital and
there were 372 community
patients.
In 1968, Stanford University
purchased the city of Palo Alto's
share in the former Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital.
The hospital has been working
with the architect Bertrand
Goldberg and Associates of
Chicago and with a medical
systems group.
First phase of the expansion as
it is now envisioned would be
construction of an 80,000 square
foot segment of a base building. It
would house x-ray and laboratory
space.
New Intensive Care Unit
Existing laboratory space in the
main hospital would be changed
to a 25-bed intensive care unit.
The present unit would be
converted to general hospital use.
The first phase would also
consist of building one of four
projected towers on top of the
base, located east of the present
emergency ward—occupying the
corner of the existing outdoor
dining area of the faculty
cafeteria.
The long-term expansion
foresees building on the northeast
side of the main hospital-medical
school toward Guarry Road.

The base of the structure will
be two and three levels (400,000
square feet) with four six-story
towers on top. The towers would
be attached by diagonal corridors
to each corner of an extension of
the four-story wing above the
hospital's emergency ward.
Flexible Towers
Surgical areas, laboratories, and
support services for the hospital
would be located in the base
structure, while patients would be
housed in the towers, according to
Dr. Gonda.
Each tower would hold from
210 to 240 patients and provide
for virtual "total flexibility on
each floor." Much of the bed
space in the towers will hopefully

be in hotel-type use, saving the
more costly high-intensity care
beds for patients needing them.
Dr. Gonda said that the new
structures would have to "blend
architecturally" with the existing
medical center.
Report In Two Months
In full report will be issued in
two months and Dr. Gonda thinks
that the trustees could approve it
as soon as four months after that
date.
Funds will probably have to
come from a combination of loans
and pay-as-you-go funding from
the university, with the possibility
of new financing methods for the
patient towers, Dr. Gonda said.
