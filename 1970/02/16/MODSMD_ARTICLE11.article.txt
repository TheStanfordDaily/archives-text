# More On The Middle East
## Israel No Angel! 
### Pat Mihaly 
While discussing the Middle
East situation recently with a
group of Americans, one turned
toward me abruptly and asked,
"Do you believe in the Bible? For
if so, how can you question the
state of Israel?" It never ceases to
amaze me how Americans, so
quick to criticize most countries,
including their own, can somehow
exclude Israel from such scrutiny
and deny the value, the integrity,
and even the right of opposition
to Israeli policy. If the Bible does
provide the answer then why is
the Pope denied such a sanctuary?
Certainly another answer would
be the fear of being labeled
anti-Semitic and thus becoming
victim to a McCarthy-like
witch-hunt which has even labeled
fellow Jews as anti-Semitic.
Whatever answer one might offer,
however, I can only respond that
when the Jewish people decided
to enter the political realm of
state-building and began to
emphasize Judaism as a
nationalism as well as a religion
then they became, or at least
should have become, as liable to
criticism as any other political
entity.
Though the idea might shock a
few and fail to penetrate the
minds of many—lsrael is no angel
or paragon of virtue that should
be somehow exempt from
accountability to those whoj
support her —and in fact, such a '
lack of accountability, like a
blankcheck, is the greatest abettor
of a wanton morality and a
diminishing sense of integrity.
Bowing to the pressure of the
Jewish Vote as have so many
American politicians, President
Johnson signed an agreement on
December 27, 1968 to sell Israel
50 Phantom F-4 fighter bombers.
The very next day Israeli national
forces attacked the undefended
civilian international airport in
Beirut and destroyed 13 Lebanese
commercial airliners. The incident
brought Lebanon out of its
neutrality and squarely into the
Arab-Israeli dispute, through the
fragile justification that the
Palestinian responsible for the
Athens incident had traveled via
Beirut.
So often portrayed in the press
as the would-be victim of Arab
bullies, Israel has undeniably
become the bully in her
confrontations with Lebanon. On

January 3 of this year Israelis
again entered Lebanon, and this
time captured 21 Lebanese,
including 11 civilians, in
retaliation for the capture by
al-Fatah of one Israeli watchman.
Most of the Lebanese are still
detained as hostages though the
watchman is under al-Fatah
control in Jordan. Incapable of
controlling the Palestinian
commandoes, and less prepared to
fight Israel, Lebanon's only
success in such incidents is
ironically her effective security
measures for the 6000 Jews of
Lebanon, living mainly in Beirut.
But Lebanon is not Israel's only
victim, for a campaign is now
underway to coerce Egypt into
peace talks. Unhampered by
Egyptian missiles or radar
detection which she recently
destroyed, Israel is hard at work
not only destroying Egypt's
military centers, but also its
industrial centers, recently coming
so close to Cairo as to hit Maadi, a
primarily residential suburb of
Egypt's capital.

The six-day war in 1967 was
enough to belie the image of Israel
as an underdog—the technical
ability of her citizens and the
superiority of her military
machinery far outweigh the Arab
strength of numbers. Thus the
recent barrage of attacks on Egypt
and the incidents in Lebanon only
serve to show that the Israelis are
the real bullies of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
Yet Israel is not only bent on
proving that might makes right
and coercion leads to peace. While
America speaks of defending the
sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Israel, Israel is
asserting her monopoly of those
rights. The snatching of the five
gunboats from France is the most
recent example, however some of
you might also remember the
smuggling of RAF planes from
Britain in the 1948 war, the
capture of missile secrets from
France, the abduction of
Eichmann from Argentina, the
conspiracy against de Gaulle when
he supported Algerian

independence and the bombing of
the American Embassy in Cairo
by Israeli spies in order to strain
U.S.-Egyptian relations.
Israel may not be the only
nation to act with such disregard
for international laws and the
sovereignty of nations, yet it
would be hard to find another
which has done so with greater
frequency and less accountability.
We in America are to a great
extent responsible for this record.
It is time that educated Americans
begin to judge Israeli actions by
the same standards by which we
judge all other nations, including
our own.
Rather than grant Israel
unconditional pardon for her
every action, we should have the
courage and integrity to openly
criticize Israel whenever such
criticism is justified. Americans, in
particular, have such a
responsibility since it is our nation
which constitutes the mainstay of
Israel's international support.

watchman is under al-Fatah
control in Jordan. Incapable of
controlling the Palestinian
commandoes, and less prepared to
fight Israel, Lebanon's only
success in such incidents is
ironically her effective security
measures for the 6000 Jews of
Lebanon, living mainly in Beirut.
But Lebanon is not Israel's only
victim, for a campaign is now
underway to coerce Egypt into
peace talks. Unhampered by
Egyptian missiles or radar
detection which she recently
destroyed, Israel is hard at work
not only destroying Egypt's
military centers, but also its
industrial centers, recently coming
so close to Cairo as to hit Maadi, a
primarily residential suburb of
Egypt's capital.

The six-day war in 1967 was
enough to belie the image of Israel
as an underdog—the technical
ability of her citizens and the
superiority of her military
machinery far outweigh the Arab
strength of numbers. Thus the
recent barrage of attacks on Egypt
and the incidents in Lebanon only
serve to show that the Israelis are
the real bullies of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
Yet Israel is not only bent on
proving that might makes right
and coercion leads to peace. While
America speaks of defending the
sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Israel, Israel is
asserting her monopoly of those
rights. The snatching of the five
gunboats from France is the most
recent example, however some of
you might also remember the
smuggling of RAF planes from
Britain in the 1948 war, the
capture of missile secrets from
France, the abduction of
Eichmann from Argentina, the
conspiracy against de Gaulle when
he supported Algerian

independence and the bombing of
the American Embassy in Cairo
by Israeli spies in order to strain
U.S.-Egyptian relations.
Israel may not be the only
nation to act with such disregard
for international laws and the
sovereignty of nations, yet it
would be hard to find another
which has done so with greater
frequency and less accountability.
We in America are to a great
extent responsible for this record.
It is time that educated Americans
begin to judge Israeli actions by
the same standards by which we
judge all other nations, including
our own.
Rather than grant Israel
unconditional pardon for her
every action, we should have the
courage and integrity to openly
criticize Israel whenever such
criticism is justified. Americans, in
particular, have such a
responsibility since it is our nation
which constitutes the mainstay of
Israel's international support.

While discussing the Middle
East situation recently with a
group of Americans, one turned
toward me abruptly and asked,
"Do you believe in the Bible? For
if so, how can you question the
state of Israel?" It never ceases to
amaze me how Americans, so
quick to criticize most countries,
including their own, can somehow
exclude Israel from such scrutiny
and deny the value, the integrity,
and even the right of opposition
to Israeli policy. If the Bible does
provide the answer then why is
the Pope denied such a sanctuary?
Certainly another answer would
be the fear of being labeled
anti-Semitic and thus becoming
victim to a McCarthy-like
witch-hunt which has even labeled
fellow Jews as anti-Semitic.
Whatever answer one might offer,
however, I can only respond that
when the Jewish people decided
to enter the political realm of
state-building and began to
emphasize Judaism as a
nationalism as well as a religion
then they became, or at least
should have become, as liable to
criticism as any other political
entity.
Though the idea might shock a
few and fail to penetrate the
minds of many—lsrael is no angel
or paragon of virtue that should
be somehow exempt from
accountability to those whoj
support her —and in fact, such a '
lack of accountability, like a
blankcheck, is the greatest abettor
of a wanton morality and a
diminishing sense of integrity.
Bowing to the pressure of the
Jewish Vote as have so many
American politicians, President
Johnson signed an agreement on
December 27, 1968 to sell Israel
50 Phantom F-4 fighter bombers.
The very next day Israeli national
forces attacked the undefended
civilian international airport in
Beirut and destroyed 13 Lebanese
commercial airliners. The incident
brought Lebanon out of its
neutrality and squarely into the
Arab-Israeli dispute, through the
fragile justification that the
Palestinian responsible for the
Athens incident had traveled via
Beirut.
So often portrayed in the press
as the would-be victim of Arab
bullies, Israel has undeniably
become the bully in her
confrontations with Lebanon. On

January 3 of this year Israelis
again entered Lebanon, and this
time captured 21 Lebanese,
including 11 civilians, in
retaliation for the capture by
al-Fatah of one Israeli watchman.

Israel's international support.

While discussing the Middle
East situation recently with a
group of Americans, one turned
toward me abruptly and asked,
"Do you believe in the Bible? For
if so, how can you question the
state of Israel?" It never ceases to
amaze me how Americans, so
quick to criticize most countries,
including their own, can somehow
exclude Israel from such scrutiny
and deny the value, the integrity,
and even the right of opposition
to Israeli policy. If the Bible does
provide the answer then why is
the Pope denied such a sanctuary?
Certainly another answer would
be the fear of being labeled
anti-Semitic and thus becoming
victim to a McCarthy-like
witch-hunt which has even labeled
fellow Jews as anti-Semitic.
Whatever answer one might offer,
however, I can only respond that
when the Jewish people decided
to enter the political realm of
state-building and began to
emphasize Judaism as a
nationalism as well as a religion
then they became, or at least
should have become, as liable to
criticism as any other political
entity.
Though the idea might shock a
few and fail to penetrate the
minds of many—lsrael is no angel
or paragon of virtue that should
be somehow exempt from
accountability to those whoj
support her —and in fact, such a '
lack of accountability, like a
blankcheck, is the greatest abettor
of a wanton morality and a
diminishing sense of integrity.
Bowing to the pressure of the
Jewish Vote as have so many
American politicians, President
Johnson signed an agreement on
December 27, 1968 to sell Israel
50 Phantom F-4 fighter bombers.
The very next day Israeli national
forces attacked the undefended
civilian international airport in
Beirut and destroyed 13 Lebanese
commercial airliners. The incident
brought Lebanon out of its
neutrality and squarely into the
Arab-Israeli dispute, through the
fragile justification that the
Palestinian responsible for the
Athens incident had traveled via
Beirut.
So often portrayed in the press
as the would-be victim of Arab
bullies, Israel has undeniably
become the bully in her
confrontations with Lebanon. On

January 3 of this year Israelis
again entered Lebanon, and this
time captured 21 Lebanese,
including 11 civilians, in
retaliation for the capture by
al-Fatah of one Israeli watchman.
Most of the Lebanese are still
detained as hostages though the
watchman is under al-Fatah
control in Jordan. Incapable of
controlling the Palestinian
commandoes, and less prepared to
fight Israel, Lebanon's only
success in such incidents is
ironically her effective security
measures for the 6000 Jews of
Lebanon, living mainly in Beirut.
But Lebanon is not Israel's only
victim, for a campaign is now
underway to coerce Egypt into
peace talks. Unhampered by
Egyptian missiles or radar
detection which she recently
destroyed, Israel is hard at work
not only destroying Egypt's
military centers, but also its
industrial centers, recently coming
so close to Cairo as to hit Maadi, a
primarily residential suburb of
Egypt's capital.

The six-day war in 1967 was
enough to belie the image of Israel
as an underdog—the technical
ability of her citizens and the
superiority of her military
machinery far outweigh the Arab
strength of numbers. Thus the
recent barrage of attacks on Egypt
and the incidents in Lebanon only
serve to show that the Israelis are
the real bullies of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
Yet Israel is not only bent on
proving that might makes right
and coercion leads to peace. While
America speaks of defending the
sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Israel, Israel is
asserting her monopoly of those
rights. The snatching of the five
gunboats from France is the most
recent example, however some of
you might also remember the
smuggling of RAF planes from
Britain in the 1948 war, the
capture of missile secrets from
France, the abduction of
Eichmann from Argentina, the
conspiracy against de Gaulle when
he supported Algerian

independence and the bombing of
the American Embassy in Cairo
by Israeli spies in order to strain
U.S.-Egyptian relations.
Israel may not be the only
nation to act with such disregard
for international laws and the
sovereignty of nations, yet it
would be hard to find another
which has done so with greater
frequency and less accountability.
We in America are to a great
extent responsible for this record.
It is time that educated Americans
begin to judge Israeli actions by
the same standards by which we
judge all other nations, including
our own.
Rather than grant Israel
unconditional pardon for her
every action, we should have the
courage and integrity to openly
criticize Israel whenever such
criticism is justified. Americans, in
particular, have such a
responsibility since it is our nation
which constitutes the mainstay of
Israel's international support.
