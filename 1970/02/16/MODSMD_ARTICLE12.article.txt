Editor, THE DAILY:
On no prete qu'aux riches.
As I look at the two following
different recall notices used by
the Stanford University Libraries,
I wonder whether there is a
faculty member or a librarian who
will explain to me what makes the
faculty's research so different
from students' research as to
require two different styles when
recalling a book from the students
and faculty or staff members. But
maybe this is a totally naive and
irrelevant question in a society
where higher status is bound to
beget more privileges.
P.S.
While at it, someone might also
explain to me what is the basis for
the discriminatory circulation
policies between staff, faculty.

graduate and undergraduate
