## Hits And Near Misses On Tap 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Highlighting the coming film
week are fine works by veteran
directors William Wyler,
Eisenstein, and Carol Reed, as
well as by the relative newcomers
Roman Polanski, Sam Peckinpah,
and Mike Nichols.
The sociology in Wyler's "Dead
End" occasionally becomes a bit
overbearing but the film marks
the screen debut of the Bowery
Boys and it's a joy watching these
little tough guys aspiring to the
true toughness of Humphrey
Bogart, the local gangster who's
made it big. Bogart gives one of
his best performances in this

adaptation of Sidney Kingsley's
Broadway play and Gregg
Toland's photographs is
outstanding. With Joel JcCrea,
Sylvia Sidney, and Claire Trevor.
Also showing at Clive Miller's
Tuesday series in Geology 320 is a
highly entertaining gangster film,
"The Amazing Doctor
Clitterhouse," with Edward G.
Robinson and, again, Bogart and
Claire Trevor.
Even though Eisenstein's "Ten
Days That Shook the World"
deals with the famous events of
the Russian revolution, the film is
rather confusing purely on the
story level. Perhaps it is the

concept of 'masses as hero' which
prevents me from feeling too
deeply for this picture, which was
made to commemorate the tenth
anniversary of the Bolshevik
takeover. Even so, it must be
conceded that several sequences
are strikingly staged, cut, and
assembled. This International
Association film will be shown at
7:45 on Thursday in Cubberley.
Though it poses as a supposedly
significant political allegory,
"Behold a Pale Horse" is nothing
but ponderous and isn't strong
enough in any department to even
be called pretentious. Indeed, the
critics probably wouldn't have

noticed the film at all if it hadn't
been directed by the acclaimed
but academic Fred Zinneman.
Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn,
and Omar Sharif will appear in
Bishop Auditorium at 7 and 9 on
Thursday.
International Fame
The assorted perversions in
Roman Polanski's directorial
personality simmer just below the
surface in "Knife in the Water."
Polanski immediately gained an
international reputation with his
quietly impressive first feature,
which at first seems very serene
but gradually gets under the skin.
At Cubberley on Friday at 7 and
9:30.
Sam Peckinpah's pre-"Wild
Bunch" reputation was based
mainly on the promise shown in
"Ride and High Country," widely
considered the sleeper of 1962
and even one of the best westerns
of this decade. Randolph Scott
and Joel McCrea star in this
visually compelling film, showing
Friday at Tresidder at 7, 8 and 9.
Since it didn't arrive a couple
of weeks ago, "Harper" will be
shown this Friday in Bishop
Auditorium at 8 and 10:30. Paul
Newman, Shelley Winters, Robert
Wagner, and Julie Harris head the
cast of this entertaining detective
film.
Surrealism
Being featured at Friday's
underground film series is Jean
Cocteau's "Blook of a Poet." For
anyone not already familiar with
the French artist's world, the film
is bound to be rough going, but
it's famous as Cocteau's first film
and as one of the most important
surreal works in the cinema. Also
showing at 11 p.m. in Geology
320 are Man Ray's "Etoile de
Mer" and Bruce Baillie's "To
Parsifal."
Carol Reed was in his prime
when he directed "Odd Man Out"
in 1947. James Mason stars as an
Irish rebel being hunted by the
police in this memorable,
evocative film which also features
Robert Newton, F.J. McCormick,
Dan O'Herligy and Cyril Cusack.
At Tresidder on Saturday at 7, 8
and 9.
Roman Polanski's second film,
"Repulsion," is an absolute
knockout, hitting you in the gut
like few other films I can think of.
Catherine Deneuve plays the
deranged young lady who says no
to her would-be lovers in the most
gruesome ways. I have yet to meet
anyone who can sit through this
film without flinching or looking
away. At Cubberley on Saturday
night —watch the Daily for times.
If you want to see "The
Graduate" for the fourth or fifth
time, it will be at the Sunday
Flicks.

Boys and it's a joy watching these
little tough guys aspiring to the
true toughness of Humphrey
Bogart, the local gangster who's
made it big. Bogart gives one of
his best performances in this

adaptation of Sidney Kingsley's
Broadway play and Gregg
Toland's photographs is
outstanding. With Joel JcCrea,
Sylvia Sidney, and Claire Trevor.
Also showing at Clive Miller's
Tuesday series in Geology 320 is a
highly entertaining gangster film,
"The Amazing Doctor
Clitterhouse," with Edward G.
Robinson and, again, Bogart and
Claire Trevor.
Even though Eisenstein's "Ten
Days That Shook the World"
deals with the famous events of
the Russian revolution, the film is
rather confusing purely on the
story level. Perhaps it is the

concept of 'masses as hero' which
prevents me from feeling too
deeply for this picture, which was
made to commemorate the tenth
anniversary of the Bolshevik
takeover. Even so, it must be
conceded that several sequences
are strikingly staged, cut, and
assembled. This International
Association film will be shown at
7:45 on Thursday in Cubberley.
Though it poses as a supposedly
significant political allegory,
"Behold a Pale Horse" is nothing
but ponderous and isn't strong
enough in any department to even
be called pretentious. Indeed, the
critics probably wouldn't have

noticed the film at all if it hadn't
been directed by the acclaimed
but academic Fred Zinneman.
Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn,
and Omar Sharif will appear in
Bishop Auditorium at 7 and 9 on
Thursday.
International Fame
The assorted perversions in
Roman Polanski's directorial
personality simmer just below the
surface in "Knife in the Water."
Polanski immediately gained an
international reputation with his
quietly impressive first feature,
which at first seems very serene
but gradually gets under the skin.
At Cubberley on Friday at 7 and
9:30.
Sam Peckinpah's pre-"Wild
Bunch" reputation was based
mainly on the promise shown in
"Ride and High Country," widely
considered the sleeper of 1962
and even one of the best westerns
of this decade. Randolph Scott
and Joel McCrea star in this
visually compelling film, showing
Friday at Tresidder at 7, 8 and 9.
Since it didn't arrive a couple
of weeks ago, "Harper" will be
shown this Friday in Bishop
Auditorium at 8 and 10:30. Paul
Newman, Shelley Winters, Robert
Wagner, and Julie Harris head the
cast of this entertaining detective
film.
Surrealism
Being featured at Friday's
underground film series is Jean
Cocteau's "Blook of a Poet." For
anyone not already familiar with
the French artist's world, the film
is bound to be rough going, but
it's famous as Cocteau's first film
and as one of the most important
surreal works in the cinema. Also
showing at 11 p.m. in Geology
320 are Man Ray's "Etoile de
Mer" and Bruce Baillie's "To
Parsifal."
Carol Reed was in his prime
when he directed "Odd Man Out"
in 1947. James Mason stars as an
Irish rebel being hunted by the
police in this memorable,
evocative film which also features
Robert Newton, F.J. McCormick,
Dan O'Herligy and Cyril Cusack.
At Tresidder on Saturday at 7, 8
and 9.
Roman Polanski's second film,
"Repulsion," is an absolute
knockout, hitting you in the gut
like few other films I can think of.
Catherine Deneuve plays the
deranged young lady who says no
to her would-be lovers in the most
gruesome ways. I have yet to meet
anyone who can sit through this
film without flinching or looking
away. At Cubberley on Saturday
night —watch the Daily for times.
If you want to see "The
Graduate" for the fourth or fifth
time, it will be at the Sunday
Flicks.
Highlighting the coming film
week are fine works by veteran
directors William Wyler,
Eisenstein, and Carol Reed, as
well as by the relative newcomers
Roman Polanski, Sam Peckinpah,
and Mike Nichols.
The sociology in Wyler's "Dead
End" occasionally becomes a bit
overbearing but the film marks
the screen debut of the Bowery
Boys and it's a joy watching these
little tough guys aspiring to the
true toughness of Humphrey
Bogart, the local gangster who's
made it big. Bogart gives one of
his best performances in this
