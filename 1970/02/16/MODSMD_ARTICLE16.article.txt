# Pitzer Speech Highlights Student Fund-Raising Drive
## 
### 
President Kennth Pitzer will keynote next
week's campus wide Stanford Universide Now
(SUN) student fund-raising campaign with another
"State of the University" speech on Tuesday.
The President's speech will be the highlight of
an educational week that will also feature dorm

seminars and panel discussions as well as
solicitations.
From Monday through Thursday, top student,
faculty, and administration leaders will participate
in financially oriented seminars. (See OATQ for
seminar schedule.)
Three Alternatives
SUN chairman Chris Rafferty says, however,
that the week is meant not only to raise funds,
but, "more significantly, to heighten student
awareness of their responsibilities towards the
University."
Contributors to the fund will be offered a
choice of three alternatives. They may donate to
the Martin Luther King Scholarship Fund for
minority students, the Endowment for Innovation,
or the University "unrestricted funds."
Contribution To Excellence
Chairman Rafferty emphasizes that "students
must be shown that Stanford is not a wealthy
institution, and that a great need exists if
excellence at private institutions liek Stanford is to
continue. Students can make a significant
contribution to this excellence."
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice-President for
Finance, said, "in gift procurement and long-term
support, one of Stanford's greatest problems has
been the lack of understanding by students while
they are still here of the importance of the gift
program. Most leave with a very poor idea of their
role in this.
Cultivation 01 Process
"But now, with the initiative of the student to
encourage student support, I see it as one of the
most hopeful signs for the future. And, I am not
so concerned about the amount of money that
comes in now as I am about the cultivation of the
learning process of giving."
The organization of SUN was the result of a
quarter of study by the 1969-1970 student
development committee. Patterned on other
student fund drives initiated in the recent past,
SUN represents the most ambitious effort to date
made by students in fund raising.
Rafferty notes that though all students will be
solicited during the drive, there will be special
emphasis on personal contact with seniors since
they soon are to become alumni.
