# Tribe Falls At :03

### DON TOLLEFSON 
When you're having a bad
season, not much ever goes your
way, which Stanford's basketball
team proved this weekend. The
Indians travelled to Oregon, and
after getting bombed by Oregon
State 80-59 Friday night, lost a
92-91 heartbreaker to Oregon
Saturday night on Larry
Holliday's 16 foot jump shot
with three seconds left.
While 8700 ecstatic Duck fans
mobbed Holliday, a disappointed
Indian squad left the court with a
5-15 overall record and a 2-7
league record, good for
uncontested possession of the
Pac-8 cellar. Seven of those fifteen
losses have been by five points or
less.
Stanford played well in the
early going against OSU as they
pushed out to a 26-23 lead. But
the Beavers came on strong in the
last six minutes of the half and
gained a 37-30 halftime lead. In
the second half, OSU dominated
the game as they held the Indians
to only six field goals out of 23
attempts.
The Indians ended up shooting
only 37 percent (19 of 51)
compared to the Beaver's 48
percent (34 of 70). Vic
Bartolome, who entered the game
leading the nation in field goal
percentage, ended the game with a
career high of 31 points. Stanford
was paced by Claude Terry's 21
points and Dennis O'Neill's 19.
Saturday night, Stanford
looked like they might be in for
another rout as Oregon fought out
to a 53-41 halftime advantage.
But in the second half the Tribe
played extremely well as they
dissolved a 16 point deficit. Led
by the hot shooting of Terry, the
Indians closed the gap in the last
five minutes, and tied it up on a
hoop by Terry with 2:30 left at
85-85. It was tied again at 87-87,
but Oregon took the lead with
one minute remaining on a basket
by center Stan Love.

Bill Palmer tied it again at
89-89 with 40 seconds left and
Oregon tried to work for the last
shot. Stanford coach Howie
Dallmar reused some of last
weekend's strategy as he had
Terry foul Billy Gaskins with 19
seconds left.
Gaskins hit the first on a one
and one to give the Ducks a 90-89
lead, but Palmer was fouled on
the rebound after the second shot.
Palmer converted both of his
one-and-one shots to give
Stanford a 91-90 lead with 18
seconds. The Indians looked as if
they had successfully made a
trememdous comeback, but
Holliday hit his 16 foot jump shot
with three seconds left to give the
Ducks their 92-91 victory.
Love paced the Ducks with 33
points, while Bill Drozdiak added
18. Stanford was paced by Terry's
32, 23 of which came in the
second half. O'Neill added 22

while Chuck Moore picked up 12.
Stanford's freshman team ran
their record to 10-2 as they
romped over Cal State at
Hayward's Frosh. Next weekend
Stanford returns to Maples
Pavilion to take on Washington
State atid Washington.
