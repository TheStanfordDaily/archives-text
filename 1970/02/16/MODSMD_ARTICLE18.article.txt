# Husky Performers Overwhelm Rivals
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Even a good performance can
be flat sometimes, and that was
the case with gymnastics Saturday
night.
Still, the overflow crowd which
packed the stands and spilled
cross-legged onto the adjacent
wrestling mats in Encina Pavilion
had a satisfying look at
Washington ace Yoshi Hayasaki
and some other good performers.
But neither the University of
Washington nor Stanford came
close to doing its best, and a
spirited San Jose State team
finished in the middle.
The Huskies, who had been
topped the night before 160-157
in a brilliant battle with UC
Berkeley, eased off and won easily
with 151.25. San Jose State took
second with 138.8 and Stanford
finished with 130.9, nearly four
points below its earlier
performances.
Hayasaki took all-around
honors, amassing 53.15 points to
teammate Tomi Ozora's 48.55.
Stanford's Rich Jerome was third
in the six-event compilation with
46.85.
Hayasaki started out finishing
third in free exercise and then
smoothly won each of the
remaining five events, breaking
nine points on rings, vaulting,
parallel bars and high bar without
changing his stolid expression.
The night's best score was his
9.3 on the parallel bars, and he
followed that with a dazzling 9.1
show on the high bar which
concluded the night with a roar of
approval from the crowd
estimated at 800.

The one event not won by
Hayasaki —free exercise—was
topped by the Spartan's Doug
Hills who finished the 12-man
competition with a fluid 9.0
demonstration.
Stanford's best score was an 8.5
registered by Jerome in free
exercise, good for fourth place.
The Indian freshman was also
fourth on the rings with a 7.95,
and fourth on the high bar with
an 8.15. He also scored 8.25 in
vaulting.
Steve Rochell, who lacked his
usual excellence on the rings (his
7.9 was a good half-point below
his customary score) came back
with an 8.4 to claim fourth place
on the parallel bars.
Ted Miyamoto also tallied an
8.4, which was the sixth best
score in vaulting, and Dennis
Mesick's 7.0 was good for fourth
on the side horse.
Coach Dan Millman, who was
thinking ahead to next week
immediately after team scores
were added Saturday night, said
he was happy with the
performance of some of his
gymnasts, but not so happy with
others.
The Bears, who have been in
the high 1 50s all season and who
cracked 160 for the first time
Friday, could well be on their way
to the national championship.
