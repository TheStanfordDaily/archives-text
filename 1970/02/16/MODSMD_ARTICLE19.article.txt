# Ruggers Tip UCLA
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
Stanford's powerful rugby club,
with only one loss on the season,
took another big step Saturday
toward the mythical collegiate
rugby championship with a
crunchingly convincing 23-8
triumph over the UCLA Bruins.
Down 8-5 at the end of the
opening period, the Indians
stormed back, dominating play
and putting 18 second half points
on the board to head home to
Palo Alto with the victory.
Though Stanford was minus the
services of star back Steward
Wilson, who sat it out with a
cracked rib along with regular
scrum half Jim Squeri, who saw
only limited action due to an
injured shoulder, the Indian
backfield put together one of
their best afternoons of the
season.
Reggie Sanderson, a freshman
with great potential brought up to
the varsity especially for the trip
down south, had a brilliant game
at wing. He broke off several good
runs and touched the ball across
the goal line for a three point try.

Chuck Williams found or made
a lot of running room and crossed
the goal line twice while Don
Bunce left the UCLA fullback in
his wake for a try of his own.
Breakaway-place kicker, Leon
Hartvickson was on the mark for
four conversions and a penalty
kick, racking up a remarkable 11
points in the winning effort.
Kip Oxman drew praise for his
game at the fullback spot where
his sure tackling and heads-up
kicking averted several UCLA
scores, while Hartvickson's
partner at break, Pat Preston,
turned in another aggressive
defensive performance.
The key to the victory,
however, was in the Tribe's
hard-working scrum's ability to
control the ball and bind in
line-out situations. The forwards
rucked well and controlled their
share of the scrums, giving the
backs room and the opportunity
to get the attack moving.
Stanford travels to Moraga
Wednesday afternoon for a match
with St. Mary's.


THE LINE-OUT: The ability to dominate tills kind of play was crucial
to Stanford's win Saturday over UCLA in Los Angeles.
