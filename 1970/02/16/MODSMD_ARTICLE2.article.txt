# Junipero Girls Involved
## Swastikas On Doors Raise Furor 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
The appearance of two
swastikas painted on Black
Panther literature attached to the
door of two black girls in
Junipero House has sent shock
waves through numerous and
diverse sectors of Stanford.
According to Albert Gelpi, a
faculty resident in the Wilbur
Houses, of which Junipero is one,
the two swastikas were painted
onto the door sometime late
Sunday night or early Monday
morning (Feb. 1 or 2).
The same night, according to
Gelpi, and Wilbur director Jim
Glenn, a similar sign, a swastika, a
'D', and a second swastika,
appeared on a Berkeley Barb
clipping showing an upraised
black fist, which was attached to
the door of two male white
students on the third floor of
Junipero.
Gelpi said that at a house
meeting the night of Feb. 3, one
of the girls revealed that a note
reading "Kill the Pickaninnies"
had been placed under their door.
The girls allegedly threw the note
away. No-one else contacted said
they had seen the note.
Since the first meeting, 3 house
meetings have been held for
discussion related to the incident.
The only comment that the
two girls involved would offer the
Daily regarding the incident,
besides requesting that their
names not be used, was, "The
Daily is a mother-fucking, racist
paper."
They cited evidence that the
Daily had delayed two weeks in
covering the story, when members
of the Daily staff had been aware
of the incident after the house
meeting.
They added that they felt that
the Daily was not the medium
they would choose to express
their views of the incident to the
Stanford community.
Not Isolated
According to Gelpi, Glenn, and
other sources (including a leaflet
circulated on campus Friday and
Saturday concerning the
incident), the Junipero incidents
are not isolated. Swastikas have
appeared on doors in Madera and
in one of the Stern houses.
Jon Sylvester, a resident of
Stern who had spoken to the
meeting at Junipero house 36
hours after the swastikas were
discovered, later found that a pad
attached to his door had been
burned, and that the door and the
rug near the threshold had been
scorched.
The two Junipero third-floor
residents had apparently fou.id
literature on their door defaced
on previous occasions, but had
not mentioned the incidents.
At the house meeting, held in
Junipero the Tuesday following
the discovery, Gelpi said he
"made it clear that this was ugly
and intolerable. I called on the
house to face the fact that this
had happened in our midst."

This meeting had been
requested by Alan Mokler, a
resident assistant in Junipero, by
the two girls, who according to
Mokler, objected to his hesitancy
in calling the meeting. He said
that he "wondered" at first "if a
house meeting was the best way
to handle it." Later Mokler said,
he agreed to call the meeting.
Describing the subsequent
events at the meeting, Gelpi said
the two black girls made a long
speech denoucning the house and
all aspects of it, including Gelpi,
and Mokler, and condemning the
house for racist feelings.
Note Revealed
It was during this speech that
the information about the note
first came to Gelpi's, Glenn's and
Mokler's attention.
"The note adds something that
is ... a death threat," Gelpi said.
"It was clear that they were
very much physically afraid,"
Gelpi said.
"I told (one of the girls) that if
they had any inklings as to who
had done it to tell me so that the
person could be found."
After the meeting had begun,
according to Gelpi, five or six
blacks entered the meeting and
stated "that the dorm was not
taking care of the sisters."
Gelpi added that he felt there
was "an unspecified threat to the
individual who had committed the
action and to the dorm." He said
that "there was no evidence the
act was connected with any
individual in the house."
The two girls moved out of
Junipero to stay temporarily with
Assistant Dean of Students Harold
Boyd either that night or the next
day, according to Gelpi. The girls
have since moved into a trailer.
'Everyone Shaken *
"Everybody was shaken by
what had happened and by the
intrusion of people from the
outside (into the meeting)," Gelpi
added.
Mokler described the meeting
as "necessary." We had to point
out to people that we had failed
to emphasize (with the situation
of the black students) in a
situation that demanded empathy.
"We had failed to come to grips
with a situation of alienation that
has been going on since last
quarter."
Mokler intimated that the girls
were initially alienated by the
house's reaction to a BSU party
they had sponsored in the
.Junipero lounge fall quarter. This
alienation was intensified when
the girls discovered that they had
not been consulted in further
discussions of the matter by the
residence staff.)
"The house didn't know how
to confront the situation," Mokler
added.
"Most :>f all the house is
concerned that something come
from this," he concluded. "We
have to make a change. We're
trying to build a community
which will offer its members the

kind of understanding that is
necessary."
All Angles
Jim Glenn, director of the
Wilbur houses, commented that
"The incident can be viewed from
all angles—racially, politically, and
in a human context.
"If it had only happened to
(the two girls) it would be a
closed case of racism. That it's
happened on other political
literature makes me thing it's
political.
"It's clearly a sick person," he
n.dded.
Glenn stated that he had begun
an investigation immediately upon
hearing of the incident.

"I began trying to collect
impressions in the dorm as to who
might be involved," he said.
The poster on the third-floor
door, as well as the marked
literature on the two girls' door,
was collected by Glenn and
turned over to William Leland,
Associate Dean of Students, who
is conducting an investigation of
the affair.
Glenn stated that the two girls
had said the note was written in
black ink. All the swastikas were
printed in red.
John Minor, a member of the
BSU, commented last night that,
"Everyone can investigate . . . It's
probably just a pacifying thing.
"Incidents such as this are one
of the many things black students
have to deal with," Minor
continued. "Indirectly, it affected
all 350 of us. The University does
try to suppress (this sort of
thing)."
Leland's estimation of the
situation was that "tensions were
developing against the framework
of a house that was very
individualistic —the individuals all
went their own ways.
"As soon as we found out what
was going on," Leland continued,
"we tried to find specifics through
people in the house.
"The night after the swastikas
appeared we alerted the Stanford
police to increase their vigilance
around Junipero and the faculty
resident's home."
The defaced documents which
were collected are currently in the
possession of a handwriting
analyst. Results of the analysis are
expected tomorrow.
"Nobody involved in this can
be very optimistic about reaching
a solution," Leland stated.
He said that he had met last
Monday with a number of BSU
members, and that they had said
they were pursuing an
investigation of their own.
'Extreme Fringe Element'
"It appears that the source of
this is an extreme fringe element,"
Leland continued, "but the real
problem is deep-seated.
"There is a real ambivalence in
the University context. There is a
problem in dealing with this,
because it takes a specific
incident, such as this one, to bring
it out.
"It has been helpful and very
revealing to the individuals
(remaining in Junipero) involved,"
Leland concluded.
Jim Richardson, a BSU
member, commented that
"Whether the person is found or
not is irrelevant. Whether we can
find him or not, Junipero and
Stanford did and are doing it
(practicing racism)."
Residents React
Junipero residents had varied

reactions to the original swastika
incident and the subsequent
meetings.
"The incident is making it clear
that people are not racist in the
traditional sense but that they
don't realize institutional racism is
going on," Mike Timmel, a first
floor resident, said.
"People don't feel that they are
racist by themselves, but
institutional racism is .built into
them." Phyllis Levinson, a
next-door neighbor of the girls,
stated that her first reaction was
disgust. "I didn't take it as a
serious thing, just something
inconsiderate people do," she
said.
Commenting on the first
meeting, she said "It was hard for
the girls to listen to us objectively
because they were so frightened.
There were common feelings of
fear."
She added that she felt very
involved in the situation. "We
can't be an apartment house. We
have to be a community," she
said.
"It was the first time I became
aware of the attitude of
people—the apathy, disinterest,
and lack of feeling for the other
person's point of view," said
resident Alan Pekari.
Speaking from an observer's
viewpoint, SDS member Janet
Weiss stated: "It's clear that this
country is entering a period of
facism . . . There is an atmosphere
on this campus which fosters
fascism. This was a horrible,
fascistic attack on black people.
They should be defended by the
whole campus."
"If they were serious about the
investigation," she added, "they
would have caught someone."
"It's inexcusable that the Daily
refused to cover it at the time,"
she stated.
Harold Boyd, at whose house
the girls had stayed and BSU
chairman Leo Bazile were
unavailable last night for
comment. Bazile, contacted
earlier in the day, had said that
the Junipero problem was one of
a series of incidents he had been
gathering information on.

swastikas painted on Black

door of two black girls in

Glenn, a similar sign, a swastika, a
'D', and a second swastika,
appeared on a Berkeley Barb
clipping showing an upraised
black fist, which was attached to
the door of two male white
students on the third floor of
Junipero.
Gelpi said that at a house
meeting the night of Feb. 3, one
of the girls revealed that a note
reading "Kill the Pickaninnies"
had been placed under their door.
The girls allegedly threw the note
away. No-one else contacted said
they had seen the note.
Since the first meeting, 3 house
meetings have been held for
discussion related to the incident.
The only comment that the
two girls involved would offer the
Daily regarding the incident,
besides requesting that their
names not be used, was, "The
Daily is a mother-fucking, racist
paper."
They cited evidence that the
Daily had delayed two weeks in
covering the story, when members
of the Daily staff had been aware
of the incident after the house
meeting.
They added that they felt that
the Daily was not the medium
they would choose to express
their views of the incident to the
Stanford community.
Not Isolated
According to Gelpi, Glenn, and
other sources (including a leaflet
circulated on campus Friday and
Saturday concerning the
incident), the Junipero incidents
are not isolated. Swastikas have
appeared on doors in Madera and
in one of the Stern houses.
Jon Sylvester, a resident of
Stern who had spoken to the
meeting at Junipero house 36
hours after the swastikas were
discovered, later found that a pad
attached to his door had been
burned, and that the door and the
rug near the threshold had been
scorched.
The two Junipero third-floor
residents had apparently fou.id
literature on their door defaced
on previous occasions, but had
not mentioned the incidents.
At the house meeting, held in
Junipero the Tuesday following
the discovery, Gelpi said he
"made it clear that this was ugly
and intolerable. I called on the
house to face the fact that this
had happened in our midst."

This meeting had been
requested by Alan Mokler, a
resident assistant in Junipero, by
the two girls, who according to
Mokler, objected to his hesitancy
in calling the meeting. He said
that he "wondered" at first "if a
house meeting was the best way
to handle it." Later Mokler said,
he agreed to call the meeting.
Describing the subsequent
events at the meeting, Gelpi said
the two black girls made a long
speech denoucning the house and
all aspects of it, including Gelpi,
and Mokler, and condemning the
house for racist feelings.
Note Revealed
It was during this speech that
the information about the note
first came to Gelpi's, Glenn's and
Mokler's attention.
"The note adds something that
is ... a death threat," Gelpi said.
"It was clear that they were
very much physically afraid,"
Gelpi said.
"I told (one of the girls) that if
they had any inklings as to who
had done it to tell me so that the
person could be found."
After the meeting had begun,
according to Gelpi, five or six
blacks entered the meeting and
stated "that the dorm was not
taking care of the sisters."
Gelpi added that he felt there
was "an unspecified threat to the
individual who had committed the
action and to the dorm." He said
that "there was no evidence the
act was connected with any
individual in the house."
The two girls moved out of
Junipero to stay temporarily with
Assistant Dean of Students Harold
Boyd either that night or the next
day, according to Gelpi. The girls
have since moved into a trailer.
'Everyone Shaken *
"Everybody was shaken by
what had happened and by the
intrusion of people from the
outside (into the meeting)," Gelpi
added.
Mokler described the meeting
as "necessary." We had to point
out to people that we had failed
to emphasize (with the situation
of the black students) in a
situation that demanded empathy.
"We had failed to come to grips
with a situation of alienation that
has been going on since last
quarter."
Mokler intimated that the girls
were initially alienated by the
house's reaction to a BSU party
they had sponsored in the
.Junipero lounge fall quarter. This
alienation was intensified when
the girls discovered that they had
not been consulted in further
discussions of the matter by the
residence staff.)
"The house didn't know how
to confront the situation," Mokler
added.
"Most :>f all the house is
concerned that something come
from this," he concluded. "We
have to make a change. We're
trying to build a community
which will offer its members the

kind of understanding that is
necessary."
All Angles
Jim Glenn, director of the
Wilbur houses, commented that
"The incident can be viewed from
all angles—racially, politically, and
in a human context.
"If it had only happened to
(the two girls) it would be a
closed case of racism. That it's
happened on other political
literature makes me thing it's
political.
"It's clearly a sick person," he
n.dded.
Glenn stated that he had begun
an investigation immediately upon
hearing of the incident.

"I began trying to collect
impressions in the dorm as to who
might be involved," he said.
The poster on the third-floor
door, as well as the marked
literature on the two girls' door,
was collected by Glenn and
turned over to William Leland,
Associate Dean of Students, who
is conducting an investigation of
the affair.
Glenn stated that the two girls
had said the note was written in
black ink. All the swastikas were
printed in red.
John Minor, a member of the
BSU, commented last night that,
"Everyone can investigate . . . It's
probably just a pacifying thing.
"Incidents such as this are one
of the many things black students
have to deal with," Minor
continued. "Indirectly, it affected
all 350 of us. The University does
try to suppress (this sort of
thing)."
Leland's estimation of the
situation was that "tensions were
developing against the framework
of a house that was very
individualistic —the individuals all
went their own ways.
"As soon as we found out what
was going on," Leland continued,
"we tried to find specifics through
people in the house.
"The night after the swastikas
appeared we alerted the Stanford
police to increase their vigilance
around Junipero and the faculty
resident's home."
The defaced documents which
were collected are currently in the
possession of a handwriting
analyst. Results of the analysis are
expected tomorrow.
"Nobody involved in this can
be very optimistic about reaching
a solution," Leland stated.
He said that he had met last
Monday with a number of BSU
members, and that they had said
they were pursuing an
investigation of their own.
'Extreme Fringe Element'
"It appears that the source of
this is an extreme fringe element,"
Leland continued, "but the real
problem is deep-seated.
"There is a real ambivalence in
the University context. There is a
problem in dealing with this,
because it takes a specific
incident, such as this one, to bring
it out.
"It has been helpful and very
revealing to the individuals
(remaining in Junipero) involved,"
Leland concluded.
Jim Richardson, a BSU
member, commented that
"Whether the person is found or
not is irrelevant. Whether we can
find him or not, Junipero and
Stanford did and are doing it
(practicing racism)."
Residents React
Junipero residents had varied

reactions to the original swastika
incident and the subsequent
meetings.
"The incident is making it clear
that people are not racist in the
traditional sense but that they
don't realize institutional racism is
going on," Mike Timmel, a first
floor resident, said.
"People don't feel that they are
racist by themselves, but
institutional racism is .built into
them." Phyllis Levinson, a
next-door neighbor of the girls,
stated that her first reaction was
disgust. "I didn't take it as a
serious thing, just something
inconsiderate people do," she
said.
Commenting on the first
meeting, she said "It was hard for
the girls to listen to us objectively
because they were so frightened.
There were common feelings of
fear."
She added that she felt very
involved in the situation. "We
can't be an apartment house. We
have to be a community," she
said.
"It was the first time I became
aware of the attitude of
people—the apathy, disinterest,
and lack of feeling for the other
person's point of view," said
resident Alan Pekari.
Speaking from an observer's
viewpoint, SDS member Janet
Weiss stated: "It's clear that this
country is entering a period of
facism . . . There is an atmosphere
on this campus which fosters
fascism. This was a horrible,
fascistic attack on black people.
They should be defended by the
whole campus."
"If they were serious about the
investigation," she added, "they
would have caught someone."
"It's inexcusable that the Daily
refused to cover it at the time,"
she stated.
Harold Boyd, at whose house
the girls had stayed and BSU
chairman Leo Bazile were
unavailable last night for
comment. Bazile, contacted
earlier in the day, had said that
the Junipero problem was one of
a series of incidents he had been
gathering information on.
The appearance of two
swastikas painted on Black
Panther literature attached to the
door of two black girls in
Junipero House has sent shock
waves through numerous and
diverse sectors of Stanford.
According to Albert Gelpi, a
faculty resident in the Wilbur
Houses, of which Junipero is one,
the two swastikas were painted
onto the door sometime late
Sunday night or early Monday
morning (Feb. 1 or 2).

Since the first meeting, 3 house
meetings have been held for
discussion related to the incident.
The only comment that the
two girls involved would offer the
Daily regarding the incident,
besides requesting that their
names not be used, was, "The
Daily is a mother-fucking, racist
paper."
They cited evidence that the
Daily had delayed two weeks in
covering the story, when members
of the Daily staff had been aware
of the incident after the house
meeting.
They added that they felt that
the Daily was not the medium
they would choose to express
their views of the incident to the
Stanford community.
Not Isolated
According to Gelpi, Glenn, and
other sources (including a leaflet
circulated on campus Friday and
Saturday concerning the
incident), the Junipero incidents
are not isolated. Swastikas have
appeared on doors in Madera and
in one of the Stern houses.
Jon Sylvester, a resident of
Stern who had spoken to the
meeting at Junipero house 36
hours after the swastikas were
discovered, later found that a pad
attached to his door had been
burned, and that the door and the
rug near the threshold had been
scorched.
The two Junipero third-floor
residents had apparently fou.id
literature on their door defaced
on previous occasions, but had
not mentioned the incidents.
At the house meeting, held in
Junipero the Tuesday following
the discovery, Gelpi said he
"made it clear that this was ugly
and intolerable. I called on the
house to face the fact that this
had happened in our midst."

This meeting had been
requested by Alan Mokler, a
resident assistant in Junipero, by
the two girls, who according to
Mokler, objected to his hesitancy
in calling the meeting. He said
that he "wondered" at first "if a
house meeting was the best way
to handle it." Later Mokler said,
he agreed to call the meeting.
Describing the subsequent
events at the meeting, Gelpi said
the two black girls made a long
speech denoucning the house and
all aspects of it, including Gelpi,
and Mokler, and condemning the
house for racist feelings.
Note Revealed
It was during this speech that
the information about the note
first came to Gelpi's, Glenn's and
Mokler's attention.
"The note adds something that
is ... a death threat," Gelpi said.
"It was clear that they were
very much physically afraid,"
Gelpi said.
"I told (one of the girls) that if
they had any inklings as to who
had done it to tell me so that the
person could be found."
After the meeting had begun,
according to Gelpi, five or six
blacks entered the meeting and
stated "that the dorm was not
taking care of the sisters."
Gelpi added that he felt there
was "an unspecified threat to the
individual who had committed the
action and to the dorm." He said
that "there was no evidence the
act was connected with any
individual in the house."
The two girls moved out of
Junipero to stay temporarily with
Assistant Dean of Students Harold
Boyd either that night or the next
day, according to Gelpi. The girls
have since moved into a trailer.
'Everyone Shaken *
"Everybody was shaken by
what had happened and by the
intrusion of people from the
outside (into the meeting)," Gelpi
added.
Mokler described the meeting
as "necessary." We had to point
out to people that we had failed
to emphasize (with the situation
of the black students) in a
situation that demanded empathy.
"We had failed to come to grips
with a situation of alienation that
has been going on since last
quarter."
Mokler intimated that the girls
were initially alienated by the
house's reaction to a BSU party
they had sponsored in the
.Junipero lounge fall quarter. This
alienation was intensified when
the girls discovered that they had
not been consulted in further
discussions of the matter by the
residence staff.)
"The house didn't know how
to confront the situation," Mokler
added.
"Most :>f all the house is
concerned that something come
from this," he concluded. "We
have to make a change. We're
trying to build a community
which will offer its members the

kind of understanding that is
necessary."
All Angles
Jim Glenn, director of the
Wilbur houses, commented that
"The incident can be viewed from
all angles—racially, politically, and
in a human context.
"If it had only happened to
(the two girls) it would be a
closed case of racism. That it's
happened on other political
literature makes me thing it's
political.
"It's clearly a sick person," he
n.dded.
Glenn stated that he had begun
an investigation immediately upon
hearing of the incident.

"I began trying to collect
impressions in the dorm as to who
might be involved," he said.
The poster on the third-floor
door, as well as the marked
literature on the two girls' door,
was collected by Glenn and
turned over to William Leland,
Associate Dean of Students, who
is conducting an investigation of
the affair.
Glenn stated that the two girls
had said the note was written in
black ink. All the swastikas were
printed in red.
John Minor, a member of the
BSU, commented last night that,
"Everyone can investigate . . . It's
probably just a pacifying thing.
"Incidents such as this are one
of the many things black students
have to deal with," Minor
continued. "Indirectly, it affected
all 350 of us. The University does
try to suppress (this sort of
thing)."
Leland's estimation of the
situation was that "tensions were
developing against the framework
of a house that was very
individualistic —the individuals all
went their own ways.
"As soon as we found out what
was going on," Leland continued,
"we tried to find specifics through
people in the house.
"The night after the swastikas
appeared we alerted the Stanford
police to increase their vigilance
around Junipero and the faculty
resident's home."
The defaced documents which
were collected are currently in the
possession of a handwriting
analyst. Results of the analysis are
expected tomorrow.
"Nobody involved in this can
be very optimistic about reaching
a solution," Leland stated.
He said that he had met last
Monday with a number of BSU
members, and that they had said
they were pursuing an
investigation of their own.
'Extreme Fringe Element'
"It appears that the source of
this is an extreme fringe element,"
Leland continued, "but the real
problem is deep-seated.
"There is a real ambivalence in
the University context. There is a
problem in dealing with this,
because it takes a specific
incident, such as this one, to bring
it out.
"It has been helpful and very
revealing to the individuals
(remaining in Junipero) involved,"
Leland concluded.
Jim Richardson, a BSU
member, commented that
"Whether the person is found or
not is irrelevant. Whether we can
find him or not, Junipero and
Stanford did and are doing it
(practicing racism)."
Residents React
Junipero residents had varied

reactions to the original swastika
incident and the subsequent
meetings.
"The incident is making it clear
that people are not racist in the
traditional sense but that they
don't realize institutional racism is
going on," Mike Timmel, a first
floor resident, said.
"People don't feel that they are
racist by themselves, but
institutional racism is .built into
them." Phyllis Levinson, a
next-door neighbor of the girls,
stated that her first reaction was
disgust. "I didn't take it as a
serious thing, just something
inconsiderate people do," she
said.
Commenting on the first
meeting, she said "It was hard for
the girls to listen to us objectively
because they were so frightened.
There were common feelings of
fear."
She added that she felt very
involved in the situation. "We
can't be an apartment house. We
have to be a community," she
said.
"It was the first time I became
aware of the attitude of
people—the apathy, disinterest,
and lack of feeling for the other
person's point of view," said
resident Alan Pekari.
Speaking from an observer's
viewpoint, SDS member Janet
Weiss stated: "It's clear that this
country is entering a period of
facism . . . There is an atmosphere
on this campus which fosters
fascism. This was a horrible,
fascistic attack on black people.
They should be defended by the
whole campus."
"If they were serious about the
investigation," she added, "they
would have caught someone."
"It's inexcusable that the Daily
refused to cover it at the time,"
she stated.
Harold Boyd, at whose house
the girls had stayed and BSU
chairman Leo Bazile were
unavailable last night for
comment. Bazile, contacted
earlier in the day, had said that
the Junipero problem was one of
a series of incidents he had been
gathering information on.
The appearance of two
swastikas painted on Black
Panther literature attached to the
door of two black girls in
Junipero House has sent shock
waves through numerous and
diverse sectors of Stanford.
According to Albert Gelpi, a
faculty resident in the Wilbur
Houses, of which Junipero is one,
the two swastikas were painted
onto the door sometime late
Sunday night or early Monday
morning (Feb. 1 or 2).
The same night, according to
Gelpi, and Wilbur director Jim
Glenn, a similar sign, a swastika, a
'D', and a second swastika,
appeared on a Berkeley Barb
clipping showing an upraised
black fist, which was attached to
the door of two male white
students on the third floor of
Junipero.
Gelpi said that at a house
meeting the night of Feb. 3, one
of the girls revealed that a note
reading "Kill the Pickaninnies"
had been placed under their door.
The girls allegedly threw the note
away. No-one else contacted said
they had seen the note.
Since the first meeting, 3 house
meetings have been held for
discussion related to the incident.

their views of the incident to the
Stanford community.
Not Isolated
According to Gelpi, Glenn, and
other sources (including a leaflet
circulated on campus Friday and
Saturday concerning the
incident), the Junipero incidents
are not isolated. Swastikas have
appeared on doors in Madera and
in one of the Stern houses.
Jon Sylvester, a resident of
Stern who had spoken to the
meeting at Junipero house 36
hours after the swastikas were
discovered, later found that a pad
attached to his door had been
burned, and that the door and the
rug near the threshold had been
scorched.
The two Junipero third-floor
residents had apparently fou.id
literature on their door defaced
on previous occasions, but had
not mentioned the incidents.
At the house meeting, held in
Junipero the Tuesday following
the discovery, Gelpi said he
"made it clear that this was ugly
and intolerable. I called on the
house to face the fact that this
had happened in our midst."

This meeting had been
requested by Alan Mokler, a
resident assistant in Junipero, by
the two girls, who according to
Mokler, objected to his hesitancy
in calling the meeting. He said
that he "wondered" at first "if a
house meeting was the best way
to handle it." Later Mokler said,
he agreed to call the meeting.
Describing the subsequent
events at the meeting, Gelpi said
the two black girls made a long
speech denoucning the house and
all aspects of it, including Gelpi,
and Mokler, and condemning the
house for racist feelings.
Note Revealed
It was during this speech that
the information about the note
first came to Gelpi's, Glenn's and
Mokler's attention.
"The note adds something that
is ... a death threat," Gelpi said.
"It was clear that they were
very much physically afraid,"
Gelpi said.
"I told (one of the girls) that if
they had any inklings as to who
had done it to tell me so that the
person could be found."
After the meeting had begun,
according to Gelpi, five or six
blacks entered the meeting and
stated "that the dorm was not
taking care of the sisters."
Gelpi added that he felt there
was "an unspecified threat to the
individual who had committed the
action and to the dorm." He said
that "there was no evidence the
act was connected with any
individual in the house."
The two girls moved out of
Junipero to stay temporarily with
Assistant Dean of Students Harold
Boyd either that night or the next
day, according to Gelpi. The girls
have since moved into a trailer.
'Everyone Shaken *
"Everybody was shaken by
what had happened and by the
intrusion of people from the
outside (into the meeting)," Gelpi
added.
Mokler described the meeting
as "necessary." We had to point
out to people that we had failed
to emphasize (with the situation
of the black students) in a
situation that demanded empathy.
"We had failed to come to grips
with a situation of alienation that
has been going on since last
quarter."
Mokler intimated that the girls
were initially alienated by the
house's reaction to a BSU party
they had sponsored in the
.Junipero lounge fall quarter. This
alienation was intensified when
the girls discovered that they had
not been consulted in further
discussions of the matter by the
residence staff.)
"The house didn't know how
to confront the situation," Mokler
added.
"Most :>f all the house is
concerned that something come
from this," he concluded. "We
have to make a change. We're
trying to build a community
which will offer its members the

kind of understanding that is
necessary."
All Angles
Jim Glenn, director of the
Wilbur houses, commented that
"The incident can be viewed from
all angles—racially, politically, and
in a human context.
"If it had only happened to
(the two girls) it would be a
closed case of racism. That it's
happened on other political
literature makes me thing it's
political.
"It's clearly a sick person," he
n.dded.
Glenn stated that he had begun
an investigation immediately upon
hearing of the incident.

"I began trying to collect
impressions in the dorm as to who
might be involved," he said.
The poster on the third-floor
door, as well as the marked
literature on the two girls' door,
was collected by Glenn and
turned over to William Leland,
Associate Dean of Students, who
is conducting an investigation of
the affair.
Glenn stated that the two girls
had said the note was written in
black ink. All the swastikas were
printed in red.
John Minor, a member of the
BSU, commented last night that,
"Everyone can investigate . . . It's
probably just a pacifying thing.
"Incidents such as this are one
of the many things black students
have to deal with," Minor
continued. "Indirectly, it affected
all 350 of us. The University does
try to suppress (this sort of
thing)."
Leland's estimation of the
situation was that "tensions were
developing against the framework
of a house that was very
individualistic —the individuals all
went their own ways.
"As soon as we found out what
was going on," Leland continued,
"we tried to find specifics through
people in the house.
"The night after the swastikas
appeared we alerted the Stanford
police to increase their vigilance
around Junipero and the faculty
resident's home."
The defaced documents which
were collected are currently in the
possession of a handwriting
analyst. Results of the analysis are
expected tomorrow.
"Nobody involved in this can
be very optimistic about reaching
a solution," Leland stated.
He said that he had met last
Monday with a number of BSU
members, and that they had said
they were pursuing an
investigation of their own.
'Extreme Fringe Element'
"It appears that the source of
this is an extreme fringe element,"
Leland continued, "but the real
problem is deep-seated.
"There is a real ambivalence in
the University context. There is a
problem in dealing with this,
because it takes a specific
incident, such as this one, to bring
it out.
"It has been helpful and very
revealing to the individuals
(remaining in Junipero) involved,"
Leland concluded.
Jim Richardson, a BSU
member, commented that
"Whether the person is found or
not is irrelevant. Whether we can
find him or not, Junipero and
Stanford did and are doing it
(practicing racism)."
Residents React
Junipero residents had varied

reactions to the original swastika
incident and the subsequent
meetings.
"The incident is making it clear
that people are not racist in the
traditional sense but that they
don't realize institutional racism is
going on," Mike Timmel, a first
floor resident, said.
"People don't feel that they are
racist by themselves, but
institutional racism is .built into
them." Phyllis Levinson, a
next-door neighbor of the girls,
stated that her first reaction was
disgust. "I didn't take it as a
serious thing, just something
inconsiderate people do," she
said.
Commenting on the first
meeting, she said "It was hard for
the girls to listen to us objectively
because they were so frightened.
There were common feelings of
fear."
She added that she felt very
involved in the situation. "We
can't be an apartment house. We
have to be a community," she
said.
"It was the first time I became
aware of the attitude of
people—the apathy, disinterest,
and lack of feeling for the other
person's point of view," said
resident Alan Pekari.
Speaking from an observer's
viewpoint, SDS member Janet
Weiss stated: "It's clear that this
country is entering a period of
facism . . . There is an atmosphere
on this campus which fosters
fascism. This was a horrible,
fascistic attack on black people.
They should be defended by the
whole campus."
"If they were serious about the
investigation," she added, "they
would have caught someone."
"It's inexcusable that the Daily
refused to cover it at the time,"
she stated.
Harold Boyd, at whose house
the girls had stayed and BSU
chairman Leo Bazile were
unavailable last night for
comment. Bazile, contacted
earlier in the day, had said that
the Junipero problem was one of
a series of incidents he had been
gathering information on.
The appearance of two
swastikas painted on Black
Panther literature attached to the
door of two black girls in
Junipero House has sent shock
waves through numerous and
diverse sectors of Stanford.
According to Albert Gelpi, a
faculty resident in the Wilbur
Houses, of which Junipero is one,
the two swastikas were painted
onto the door sometime late
Sunday night or early Monday
morning (Feb. 1 or 2).
The same night, according to
Gelpi, and Wilbur director Jim
Glenn, a similar sign, a swastika, a
'D', and a second swastika,
appeared on a Berkeley Barb
clipping showing an upraised
black fist, which was attached to
the door of two male white
students on the third floor of
Junipero.
Gelpi said that at a house
meeting the night of Feb. 3, one
of the girls revealed that a note
reading "Kill the Pickaninnies"
had been placed under their door.
The girls allegedly threw the note
away. No-one else contacted said
they had seen the note.
Since the first meeting, 3 house
meetings have been held for
discussion related to the incident.
The only comment that the
two girls involved would offer the
Daily regarding the incident,
besides requesting that their
names not be used, was, "The
Daily is a mother-fucking, racist
paper."
They cited evidence that the
Daily had delayed two weeks in
covering the story, when members
of the Daily staff had been aware
of the incident after the house
meeting.
They added that they felt that
the Daily was not the medium
they would choose to express
their views of the incident to the
Stanford community.

rug near the threshold had been
scorched.
The two Junipero third-floor
residents had apparently fou.id
literature on their door defaced
on previous occasions, but had
not mentioned the incidents.
At the house meeting, held in
Junipero the Tuesday following
the discovery, Gelpi said he
"made it clear that this was ugly
and intolerable. I called on the
house to face the fact that this
had happened in our midst."

This meeting had been
requested by Alan Mokler, a
resident assistant in Junipero, by
the two girls, who according to
Mokler, objected to his hesitancy
in calling the meeting. He said
that he "wondered" at first "if a
house meeting was the best way
to handle it." Later Mokler said,
he agreed to call the meeting.
Describing the subsequent
events at the meeting, Gelpi said
the two black girls made a long
speech denoucning the house and
all aspects of it, including Gelpi,
and Mokler, and condemning the
house for racist feelings.
Note Revealed
It was during this speech that
the information about the note
first came to Gelpi's, Glenn's and
Mokler's attention.
"The note adds something that
is ... a death threat," Gelpi said.
"It was clear that they were
very much physically afraid,"
Gelpi said.
"I told (one of the girls) that if
they had any inklings as to who
had done it to tell me so that the
person could be found."
After the meeting had begun,
according to Gelpi, five or six
blacks entered the meeting and
stated "that the dorm was not
taking care of the sisters."
Gelpi added that he felt there
was "an unspecified threat to the
individual who had committed the
action and to the dorm." He said
that "there was no evidence the
act was connected with any
individual in the house."
The two girls moved out of
Junipero to stay temporarily with
Assistant Dean of Students Harold
Boyd either that night or the next
day, according to Gelpi. The girls
have since moved into a trailer.
'Everyone Shaken *
"Everybody was shaken by
what had happened and by the
intrusion of people from the
outside (into the meeting)," Gelpi
added.
Mokler described the meeting
as "necessary." We had to point
out to people that we had failed
to emphasize (with the situation
of the black students) in a
situation that demanded empathy.
"We had failed to come to grips
with a situation of alienation that
has been going on since last
quarter."
Mokler intimated that the girls
were initially alienated by the
house's reaction to a BSU party
they had sponsored in the
.Junipero lounge fall quarter. This
alienation was intensified when
the girls discovered that they had
not been consulted in further
discussions of the matter by the
residence staff.)
"The house didn't know how
to confront the situation," Mokler
added.
"Most :>f all the house is
concerned that something come
from this," he concluded. "We
have to make a change. We're
trying to build a community
which will offer its members the

kind of understanding that is
necessary."
All Angles
Jim Glenn, director of the
Wilbur houses, commented that
"The incident can be viewed from
all angles—racially, politically, and
in a human context.
"If it had only happened to
(the two girls) it would be a
closed case of racism. That it's
happened on other political
literature makes me thing it's
political.
"It's clearly a sick person," he
n.dded.
Glenn stated that he had begun
an investigation immediately upon
hearing of the incident.

"I began trying to collect
impressions in the dorm as to who
might be involved," he said.
The poster on the third-floor
door, as well as the marked
literature on the two girls' door,
was collected by Glenn and
turned over to William Leland,
Associate Dean of Students, who
is conducting an investigation of
the affair.
Glenn stated that the two girls
had said the note was written in
black ink. All the swastikas were
printed in red.
John Minor, a member of the
BSU, commented last night that,
"Everyone can investigate . . . It's
probably just a pacifying thing.
"Incidents such as this are one
of the many things black students
have to deal with," Minor
continued. "Indirectly, it affected
all 350 of us. The University does
try to suppress (this sort of
thing)."
Leland's estimation of the
situation was that "tensions were
developing against the framework
of a house that was very
individualistic —the individuals all
went their own ways.
"As soon as we found out what
was going on," Leland continued,
"we tried to find specifics through
people in the house.
"The night after the swastikas
appeared we alerted the Stanford
police to increase their vigilance
around Junipero and the faculty
resident's home."
The defaced documents which
were collected are currently in the
possession of a handwriting
analyst. Results of the analysis are
expected tomorrow.
"Nobody involved in this can
be very optimistic about reaching
a solution," Leland stated.
He said that he had met last
Monday with a number of BSU
members, and that they had said
they were pursuing an
investigation of their own.
'Extreme Fringe Element'
"It appears that the source of
this is an extreme fringe element,"
Leland continued, "but the real
problem is deep-seated.
"There is a real ambivalence in
the University context. There is a
problem in dealing with this,
because it takes a specific
incident, such as this one, to bring
it out.
"It has been helpful and very
revealing to the individuals
(remaining in Junipero) involved,"
Leland concluded.
Jim Richardson, a BSU
member, commented that
"Whether the person is found or
not is irrelevant. Whether we can
find him or not, Junipero and
Stanford did and are doing it
(practicing racism)."
Residents React
Junipero residents had varied

reactions to the original swastika
incident and the subsequent
meetings.
"The incident is making it clear
that people are not racist in the
traditional sense but that they
don't realize institutional racism is
going on," Mike Timmel, a first
floor resident, said.
"People don't feel that they are
racist by themselves, but
institutional racism is .built into
them." Phyllis Levinson, a
next-door neighbor of the girls,
stated that her first reaction was
disgust. "I didn't take it as a
serious thing, just something
inconsiderate people do," she
said.
Commenting on the first
meeting, she said "It was hard for
the girls to listen to us objectively
because they were so frightened.
There were common feelings of
fear."
She added that she felt very
involved in the situation. "We
can't be an apartment house. We
have to be a community," she
said.
"It was the first time I became
aware of the attitude of
people—the apathy, disinterest,
and lack of feeling for the other
person's point of view," said
resident Alan Pekari.
Speaking from an observer's
viewpoint, SDS member Janet
Weiss stated: "It's clear that this
country is entering a period of
facism . . . There is an atmosphere
on this campus which fosters
fascism. This was a horrible,
fascistic attack on black people.
They should be defended by the
whole campus."
"If they were serious about the
investigation," she added, "they
would have caught someone."
"It's inexcusable that the Daily
refused to cover it at the time,"
she stated.
Harold Boyd, at whose house
the girls had stayed and BSU
chairman Leo Bazile were
unavailable last night for
comment. Bazile, contacted
earlier in the day, had said that
the Junipero problem was one of
a series of incidents he had been
gathering information on.
The appearance of two
swastikas painted on Black
Panther literature attached to the
door of two black girls in
Junipero House has sent shock
waves through numerous and
diverse sectors of Stanford.
According to Albert Gelpi, a
faculty resident in the Wilbur
Houses, of which Junipero is one,
the two swastikas were painted
onto the door sometime late
Sunday night or early Monday
morning (Feb. 1 or 2).
The same night, according to
Gelpi, and Wilbur director Jim
Glenn, a similar sign, a swastika, a
'D', and a second swastika,
appeared on a Berkeley Barb
clipping showing an upraised
black fist, which was attached to
the door of two male white
students on the third floor of
Junipero.
Gelpi said that at a house
meeting the night of Feb. 3, one
of the girls revealed that a note
reading "Kill the Pickaninnies"
had been placed under their door.
The girls allegedly threw the note
away. No-one else contacted said
they had seen the note.
Since the first meeting, 3 house
meetings have been held for
discussion related to the incident.
The only comment that the
two girls involved would offer the
Daily regarding the incident,
besides requesting that their
names not be used, was, "The
Daily is a mother-fucking, racist
paper."
They cited evidence that the
Daily had delayed two weeks in
covering the story, when members
of the Daily staff had been aware
of the incident after the house
meeting.
They added that they felt that
the Daily was not the medium
they would choose to express
their views of the incident to the
Stanford community.
Not Isolated
According to Gelpi, Glenn, and
other sources (including a leaflet
circulated on campus Friday and
Saturday concerning the
incident), the Junipero incidents
are not isolated. Swastikas have
appeared on doors in Madera and
in one of the Stern houses.
Jon Sylvester, a resident of
Stern who had spoken to the
meeting at Junipero house 36
hours after the swastikas were
discovered, later found that a pad
attached to his door had been
burned, and that the door and the
rug near the threshold had been
scorched.
The two Junipero third-floor
residents had apparently fou.id
literature on their door defaced
on previous occasions, but had
not mentioned the incidents.

Junipero the Tuesday following
