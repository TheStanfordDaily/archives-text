# Hurlers Improving
## Baseball Wins A Pair 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
If Stanford expects to be any
kind of a threat at all in Pacific-8
baseball this season, three pitchers

from last year's squad will have to
produce.
The loss of several front-line
players from the 1969 ranks has
compelled Coach Ray Young to
put together a young, generally
untested squad and one which will
probably begin league play in
April rated no higher than third -
perhaps lower.
But if the three pitchers have
good years - and there's nothing
to suggest that they won't -
expectations for an improvement
over last season's second place
finish won't be out of order.
Especially if the Indians keep
hitting as they've done to date.
Two of those hurlers and some
of that hitting were on display
Saturday as the Tribe swept a
double-header from Cal Poly (San
Luis Obispo) by 4-0 and 5-3
margins at Sunken Daimond. Jim
Coate and Steve Dunning both
went all the way for victories in
the seven inning games. Left
hander Coate gave up five hits in
the first game and lowered his
earned-run average to a nice 1.12
after 16 innings this season. His
2-0 won-lost record gives him a
6-0 mark over two seasons.
At this stage of the season,
Coate is far ahead of his 1969
pace, a progress he credits to a
"stronger" feeling. "I feel more

confident and I have more control
over my pitches" he says. Thus far
the southpaw has been able to
translate his feeling into results, a
development which bodes well for
Stanford fans.
Dunning, on the other hand,
isn't having as successful a spring.
Although winning Saturday, the
strong right-hander was hurt by
wildness (walking 6) while
throwing nearly 140 pitches over
the seven frames. In the later
innings he appeared to have
settled down (on his way to nine
strike outs on the day) but he
gave up a two-run homer in the
seventh while just one out away
from the win.
"Steve's just a little rusty,"
according to pitching coach Tom
Dunton, "He needs to throw."
Young, meanwhile, says that the
third member of his returning
triumvirate, senior Phil Keller, will
go against UC at Davis Tuesday, in
another test of his occasionally
troublesome back.
On Saturday, right fielder Jack
Lynn powered a two run homer in
the first game to give the Indians
all they needed. Young used much
of his second string in the
nightcap, getting two hits from
Sandy Swanson and Don
Schellenberg, and as in the first
game, errorless ball from all.

confident and I have more control
over my pitches" he says. Thus far
the southpaw has been able to
translate his feeling into results, a
development which bodes well for
Stanford fans.
Dunning, on the other hand,
isn't having as successful a spring.
Although winning Saturday, the
strong right-hander was hurt by
wildness (walking 6) while
throwing nearly 140 pitches over
the seven frames. In the later
innings he appeared to have
settled down (on his way to nine
strike outs on the day) but he
gave up a two-run homer in the
seventh while just one out away
from the win.
"Steve's just a little rusty,"
according to pitching coach Tom
Dunton, "He needs to throw."
Young, meanwhile, says that the
third member of his returning
triumvirate, senior Phil Keller, will
go against UC at Davis Tuesday, in
another test of his occasionally
troublesome back.
On Saturday, right fielder Jack
Lynn powered a two run homer in
the first game to give the Indians
all they needed. Young used much
of his second string in the
nightcap, getting two hits from
Sandy Swanson and Don
Schellenberg, and as in the first
game, errorless ball from all.
If Stanford expects to be any
kind of a threat at all in Pacific-8
baseball this season, three pitchers

from last year's squad will have to
produce.
The loss of several front-line
players from the 1969 ranks has
compelled Coach Ray Young to
put together a young, generally
untested squad and one which will
probably begin league play in
April rated no higher than third -
perhaps lower.
But if the three pitchers have
good years - and there's nothing
to suggest that they won't -
expectations for an improvement
over last season's second place
finish won't be out of order.
Especially if the Indians keep
hitting as they've done to date.
Two of those hurlers and some
of that hitting were on display
Saturday as the Tribe swept a
double-header from Cal Poly (San
Luis Obispo) by 4-0 and 5-3
margins at Sunken Daimond. Jim
Coate and Steve Dunning both
went all the way for victories in
the seven inning games. Left
hander Coate gave up five hits in
the first game and lowered his
earned-run average to a nice 1.12
after 16 innings this season. His
2-0 won-lost record gives him a
6-0 mark over two seasons.
At this stage of the season,
Coate is far ahead of his 1969
pace, a progress he credits to a
"stronger" feeling. "I feel more

confident and I have more control
over my pitches" he says. Thus far
the southpaw has been able to
translate his feeling into results, a
development which bodes well for
Stanford fans.
