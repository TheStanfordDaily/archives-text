## Swimmers Sweep The South 
### DOUG WILSON 
LOS ANGELES-"We may be
beaten but we won't be
surprised," said Coach Peter
Daland the day before his USC
squad lost to the Stanford
swimming team, 59-54.
Poor Mr. Daland. He was
urprised, too.
Daland told the Daily Friday
afternoon, as he watched Stanford
float by UCLA, 64-49, that he
was sure he knew exactly what
every Indian swimmer would go
against his Trojans; the USC
coach, whose only two losses in
1 15 meets have been to Stanford,
was banking on Brent Berk to
swim the 200 free, and, conceding
31 points to the Indians before
the meet (medley relay,
breaststroke, and diving),
wondered where Stanford could
come up with the remaining 26
necessary for victory.
Berk, however, swam the 1000
on Saturday and came up with
an excellent performance, a fine
time, a psychological left—and
three of those 26 needed points.
The Stanford Olympian handily
beat USC's Jim McConica (eighth
n the latest Swimming World
time-rankings) by over a length,
and turned in a time of 9:56.0 for
the 40-length event, with Trojan
Greg Fink finishing five-tenths of
a second sooner.
Berk Ih«• Key
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran
singled out Berk as one of the
Keys to victory. Said Berk of his
race: "I was going to swim the
200 and 500 originally, and we'd
let them have the 1000. But when
I was warming up, I was feeling
pretty good, and I told Jim I just
didn't feel we could give them the
1000."
As mentioned, Daland had all
but conceded the medley relay,
the breaststroke, and the diving to
Stanford, and here his predictions
were correct. The medley relay
team of Fred Haywood, John
Ferris, Brian Job, and Bob
Jamison posted a 3:33.8 win over
rivals Ejdan Pederson, Tom
Ludwig, Phil Hauser and Mike
Egan. Job, who set a new NCAA
breaststroke record the day before
(2:07.7), and Dave Shilling, who
hit a personal best-time of 2:09.9,
both handily beat Ludwig in the
200 breaststroke.
It was Bill Main and Ted
Nichols who won the most
applause, however, and rightfully
so —Stanford's divers turned in
brilliant performances on both the
1- and 3-meter boards to far
outclass USC's Ron Fujikawa and
Boone Saunders. Main won the
1-meter diving with 289.05 points
to Nichols' second-place total of
253.65; the diving tandem then
cinched the meet before the final

freestyle relay, taking another
one-two sweep on the high board
as team members cheered and
flashed signs of victory with each
successive dive.
Other key performances for
Stanford's second straight win
over USC came from freshman
sprinter Steve Carey and distance
man Tim Broderick. Carey won
the 50-yd free with a time of
:21.9, in a race somewhat marred
by differences in judging. Clear to
most judges and spectators was a
1-2-3 finish by Carey, Stanford's
Bob Bebb and Indian Rick
Eagleston. One judge, however,
called USC's Mark Mader second,
and a tie was awarded for second
place to Mader and Eagleston. In
the 100 free, Carey was awarded
second place on a judge's decision,
finishing behind Trojan Frank
Heckl ( : 4 7.2), and a
second's-tenth after Mader (:48.l).
Times a Changin'
Broderick, hampered somewhat
by the start of a cold, still
managed to get important
second-place points in an exciting
500 freestyle race which saw
USC's Greg Charlton win in
4:43.8. Broderick and Trojan
Andy Strenk were awarded a
second-place tie, although the
Stanford freshman's time, 4:44.7,
beat Strenk's by a tenth. All three
times now rank among the five
fastest in the nation.
Strenk barely managed to beat
Ferris in the 200 butterfly, with a
time of 1:55.6. Ferris clocked
1:55.9 for the event, almost two
seconds over USC rival Phil
Hauser. Twenty minutes earlier,
Ferris took third place in the
200-yd individual medley and
Shilling an important second, to
Heckl, who won the event in
1:58.3.
Backstroker Fred Haywood
remained undefeated for the
season, handily beating Pederson
and Rob Orr of USC in 2:01.2. In
addition to the medley relay,
Haywood also swam a leg on the
400 free relay with Jamison,
Carey, and Ray Collins, losing to
an SC squad which set a meet
record for the event, 3:09.9—a
record which a jubilant and
victorious Indian team certainly
did not begrudge.
Stanford hinted of things to
come the afternoon before, when
the Indians beat fourth-ranked
UCLA, 64-69. The Cards needed a
sweep of the breaststroke to win
the meet two events early, and
Job and Shilling won handily. Job
also treated the crowd to a
record-breaking performance,
establishing a new NCAA mark of
2:07.7. Shilling's 2:10.4 cut three
tenths of a second off his
second-place nationally-ranked
time; the versatile Stanford

sophomore also won tne
individual medley, as he and
Ferris swept the event from
UCLA's Carl Thomas.
Burton Blazes
One of two exciting distance
races was won by UCLA
Olympian Mike Burton, who also
took the 200 butterfly in what
must have been the afternoon's
most strenuous series of
performances. Burton edged Berk
by a second in the 1000
(10:02.5), and, after beating
Ferris in a close butterfly race,
took third in the 500. That race
was won by surprising Bob Genter
of UCLA who barely edged
Stanford's Brokerick with a
4:43.3 clocking.
Earlier, Broderick defeated
Genter and Bruin Dave O'Malley

in the 200 free. The Philadelphia
freshman posted a 1:43.8
victory, four-tenths faster than
O'Malley, whose time broke the
UCLA school record for the
event.
A strong finish by Haywood
gave him the 200 backstroke win
over UCLA's Steve Gentes;
Haywood's time for the
event—l:sB.s. Fast grab-block
starts by Bebb and Carey helped
to account for their 1-2 sweep of
the 50 over Bruin tankers Rick
Bloy and Fray Heath. Although
Bebb was officially clocked at
:22.1, three-tenths slower than
Carey, judged picked the Stanford
sophomore first.
The other sprint event, the 100
free, was won by UCLA's
O'Malley in :48.5. Finishing

second and third were Eagleston
(:48.6) and Collins (:48.9) for the
Indians. Stanford and UCLA also
split the diving, as Gordon Creed
of UCLA became the Indians' first
opponent this season to win the
3-meter board.

Poor Mr. Daland. He was
urprised, too.
Daland told the Daily Friday
afternoon, as he watched Stanford
float by UCLA, 64-49, that he
was sure he knew exactly what
every Indian swimmer would go
against his Trojans; the USC
coach, whose only two losses in
1 15 meets have been to Stanford,
was banking on Brent Berk to
swim the 200 free, and, conceding
31 points to the Indians before
the meet (medley relay,
breaststroke, and diving),
wondered where Stanford could
come up with the remaining 26
necessary for victory.
Berk, however, swam the 1000
on Saturday and came up with
an excellent performance, a fine
time, a psychological left—and
three of those 26 needed points.
The Stanford Olympian handily
beat USC's Jim McConica (eighth
n the latest Swimming World
time-rankings) by over a length,
and turned in a time of 9:56.0 for
the 40-length event, with Trojan
Greg Fink finishing five-tenths of
a second sooner.
Berk Ih«• Key
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran
singled out Berk as one of the
Keys to victory. Said Berk of his
race: "I was going to swim the
200 and 500 originally, and we'd
let them have the 1000. But when
I was warming up, I was feeling
pretty good, and I told Jim I just
didn't feel we could give them the
1000."
As mentioned, Daland had all
but conceded the medley relay,
the breaststroke, and the diving to
Stanford, and here his predictions
were correct. The medley relay
team of Fred Haywood, John
Ferris, Brian Job, and Bob
Jamison posted a 3:33.8 win over
rivals Ejdan Pederson, Tom
Ludwig, Phil Hauser and Mike
Egan. Job, who set a new NCAA
breaststroke record the day before
(2:07.7), and Dave Shilling, who
hit a personal best-time of 2:09.9,
both handily beat Ludwig in the
200 breaststroke.
It was Bill Main and Ted
Nichols who won the most
applause, however, and rightfully
so —Stanford's divers turned in
brilliant performances on both the
1- and 3-meter boards to far
outclass USC's Ron Fujikawa and
Boone Saunders. Main won the
1-meter diving with 289.05 points
to Nichols' second-place total of
253.65; the diving tandem then
cinched the meet before the final

freestyle relay, taking another
one-two sweep on the high board
as team members cheered and
flashed signs of victory with each
successive dive.
Other key performances for
Stanford's second straight win
over USC came from freshman
sprinter Steve Carey and distance
man Tim Broderick. Carey won
the 50-yd free with a time of
:21.9, in a race somewhat marred
by differences in judging. Clear to
most judges and spectators was a
1-2-3 finish by Carey, Stanford's
Bob Bebb and Indian Rick
Eagleston. One judge, however,
called USC's Mark Mader second,
and a tie was awarded for second
place to Mader and Eagleston. In
the 100 free, Carey was awarded
second place on a judge's decision,
finishing behind Trojan Frank
Heckl ( : 4 7.2), and a
second's-tenth after Mader (:48.l).
Times a Changin'
Broderick, hampered somewhat
by the start of a cold, still
managed to get important
second-place points in an exciting
500 freestyle race which saw
USC's Greg Charlton win in
4:43.8. Broderick and Trojan
Andy Strenk were awarded a
second-place tie, although the
Stanford freshman's time, 4:44.7,
beat Strenk's by a tenth. All three
times now rank among the five
fastest in the nation.
Strenk barely managed to beat
Ferris in the 200 butterfly, with a
time of 1:55.6. Ferris clocked
1:55.9 for the event, almost two
seconds over USC rival Phil
Hauser. Twenty minutes earlier,
Ferris took third place in the
200-yd individual medley and
Shilling an important second, to
Heckl, who won the event in
1:58.3.
Backstroker Fred Haywood
remained undefeated for the
season, handily beating Pederson
and Rob Orr of USC in 2:01.2. In
addition to the medley relay,
Haywood also swam a leg on the
400 free relay with Jamison,
Carey, and Ray Collins, losing to
an SC squad which set a meet
record for the event, 3:09.9—a
record which a jubilant and
victorious Indian team certainly
did not begrudge.
Stanford hinted of things to
come the afternoon before, when
the Indians beat fourth-ranked
UCLA, 64-69. The Cards needed a
sweep of the breaststroke to win
the meet two events early, and
Job and Shilling won handily. Job
also treated the crowd to a
record-breaking performance,
establishing a new NCAA mark of
2:07.7. Shilling's 2:10.4 cut three
tenths of a second off his
second-place nationally-ranked
time; the versatile Stanford

sophomore also won tne
individual medley, as he and
Ferris swept the event from
UCLA's Carl Thomas.
Burton Blazes
One of two exciting distance
races was won by UCLA
Olympian Mike Burton, who also
took the 200 butterfly in what
must have been the afternoon's
most strenuous series of
performances. Burton edged Berk
by a second in the 1000
(10:02.5), and, after beating
Ferris in a close butterfly race,
took third in the 500. That race
was won by surprising Bob Genter
of UCLA who barely edged
Stanford's Brokerick with a
4:43.3 clocking.
Earlier, Broderick defeated
Genter and Bruin Dave O'Malley

in the 200 free. The Philadelphia
freshman posted a 1:43.8
victory, four-tenths faster than
O'Malley, whose time broke the
UCLA school record for the
event.
A strong finish by Haywood
gave him the 200 backstroke win
over UCLA's Steve Gentes;
Haywood's time for the
event—l:sB.s. Fast grab-block
starts by Bebb and Carey helped
to account for their 1-2 sweep of
the 50 over Bruin tankers Rick
Bloy and Fray Heath. Although
Bebb was officially clocked at
:22.1, three-tenths slower than
Carey, judged picked the Stanford
sophomore first.
The other sprint event, the 100
free, was won by UCLA's
O'Malley in :48.5. Finishing

second and third were Eagleston
(:48.6) and Collins (:48.9) for the
Indians. Stanford and UCLA also
split the diving, as Gordon Creed
of UCLA became the Indians' first
opponent this season to win the
3-meter board.

every Indian swimmer would go
against his Trojans; the USC
coach, whose only two losses in
1 15 meets have been to Stanford,
was banking on Brent Berk to
swim the 200 free, and, conceding
31 points to the Indians before
the meet (medley relay,
breaststroke, and diving),
wondered where Stanford could
come up with the remaining 26
necessary for victory.
Berk, however, swam the 1000
on Saturday and came up with
an excellent performance, a fine
time, a psychological left—and
three of those 26 needed points.
The Stanford Olympian handily
beat USC's Jim McConica (eighth
n the latest Swimming World
time-rankings) by over a length,
and turned in a time of 9:56.0 for
the 40-length event, with Trojan
Greg Fink finishing five-tenths of
a second sooner.
Berk Ih«• Key
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran
singled out Berk as one of the
Keys to victory. Said Berk of his
race: "I was going to swim the
200 and 500 originally, and we'd
let them have the 1000. But when
I was warming up, I was feeling
pretty good, and I told Jim I just
didn't feel we could give them the
1000."
As mentioned, Daland had all
but conceded the medley relay,
the breaststroke, and the diving to
Stanford, and here his predictions
were correct. The medley relay
team of Fred Haywood, John
Ferris, Brian Job, and Bob
Jamison posted a 3:33.8 win over
rivals Ejdan Pederson, Tom
Ludwig, Phil Hauser and Mike
Egan. Job, who set a new NCAA
breaststroke record the day before
(2:07.7), and Dave Shilling, who
hit a personal best-time of 2:09.9,
both handily beat Ludwig in the
200 breaststroke.
It was Bill Main and Ted
Nichols who won the most
applause, however, and rightfully
so —Stanford's divers turned in
brilliant performances on both the
1- and 3-meter boards to far
outclass USC's Ron Fujikawa and
Boone Saunders. Main won the
1-meter diving with 289.05 points
to Nichols' second-place total of
253.65; the diving tandem then
cinched the meet before the final

freestyle relay, taking another
one-two sweep on the high board
as team members cheered and
flashed signs of victory with each
successive dive.
Other key performances for
Stanford's second straight win
over USC came from freshman
sprinter Steve Carey and distance
man Tim Broderick. Carey won
the 50-yd free with a time of
:21.9, in a race somewhat marred
by differences in judging. Clear to
most judges and spectators was a
1-2-3 finish by Carey, Stanford's
Bob Bebb and Indian Rick
Eagleston. One judge, however,
called USC's Mark Mader second,
and a tie was awarded for second
place to Mader and Eagleston. In
the 100 free, Carey was awarded
second place on a judge's decision,
finishing behind Trojan Frank
Heckl ( : 4 7.2), and a
second's-tenth after Mader (:48.l).
Times a Changin'
Broderick, hampered somewhat
by the start of a cold, still
managed to get important
second-place points in an exciting
500 freestyle race which saw
USC's Greg Charlton win in
4:43.8. Broderick and Trojan
Andy Strenk were awarded a
second-place tie, although the
Stanford freshman's time, 4:44.7,
beat Strenk's by a tenth. All three
times now rank among the five
fastest in the nation.
Strenk barely managed to beat
Ferris in the 200 butterfly, with a
time of 1:55.6. Ferris clocked
1:55.9 for the event, almost two
seconds over USC rival Phil
Hauser. Twenty minutes earlier,
Ferris took third place in the
200-yd individual medley and
Shilling an important second, to
Heckl, who won the event in
1:58.3.
Backstroker Fred Haywood
remained undefeated for the
season, handily beating Pederson
and Rob Orr of USC in 2:01.2. In
addition to the medley relay,
Haywood also swam a leg on the
400 free relay with Jamison,
Carey, and Ray Collins, losing to
an SC squad which set a meet
record for the event, 3:09.9—a
record which a jubilant and
victorious Indian team certainly
did not begrudge.
Stanford hinted of things to
come the afternoon before, when
the Indians beat fourth-ranked
UCLA, 64-69. The Cards needed a
sweep of the breaststroke to win
the meet two events early, and
Job and Shilling won handily. Job
also treated the crowd to a
record-breaking performance,
establishing a new NCAA mark of
2:07.7. Shilling's 2:10.4 cut three
tenths of a second off his
second-place nationally-ranked
time; the versatile Stanford

sophomore also won tne
individual medley, as he and
Ferris swept the event from
UCLA's Carl Thomas.
Burton Blazes
One of two exciting distance
races was won by UCLA
Olympian Mike Burton, who also
took the 200 butterfly in what
must have been the afternoon's
most strenuous series of
performances. Burton edged Berk
by a second in the 1000
(10:02.5), and, after beating
Ferris in a close butterfly race,
took third in the 500. That race
was won by surprising Bob Genter
of UCLA who barely edged
Stanford's Brokerick with a
4:43.3 clocking.
Earlier, Broderick defeated
Genter and Bruin Dave O'Malley

in the 200 free. The Philadelphia
freshman posted a 1:43.8
victory, four-tenths faster than
O'Malley, whose time broke the
UCLA school record for the
event.
A strong finish by Haywood
gave him the 200 backstroke win
over UCLA's Steve Gentes;
Haywood's time for the
event—l:sB.s. Fast grab-block
starts by Bebb and Carey helped
to account for their 1-2 sweep of
the 50 over Bruin tankers Rick
Bloy and Fray Heath. Although
Bebb was officially clocked at
:22.1, three-tenths slower than
Carey, judged picked the Stanford
sophomore first.
The other sprint event, the 100
free, was won by UCLA's
O'Malley in :48.5. Finishing

second and third were Eagleston
(:48.6) and Collins (:48.9) for the
Indians. Stanford and UCLA also
split the diving, as Gordon Creed
of UCLA became the Indians' first
opponent this season to win the
3-meter board.

swim the 200 free, and, conceding
31 points to the Indians before
the meet (medley relay,
breaststroke, and diving),
wondered where Stanford could
come up with the remaining 26
necessary for victory.
Berk, however, swam the 1000
on Saturday and came up with
an excellent performance, a fine
time, a psychological left—and
three of those 26 needed points.
The Stanford Olympian handily
beat USC's Jim McConica (eighth
n the latest Swimming World
time-rankings) by over a length,
and turned in a time of 9:56.0 for
the 40-length event, with Trojan
Greg Fink finishing five-tenths of
a second sooner.
Berk Ih«• Key
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran
singled out Berk as one of the
Keys to victory. Said Berk of his
race: "I was going to swim the
200 and 500 originally, and we'd
let them have the 1000. But when
I was warming up, I was feeling
pretty good, and I told Jim I just
didn't feel we could give them the
1000."
As mentioned, Daland had all
but conceded the medley relay,
the breaststroke, and the diving to
Stanford, and here his predictions
were correct. The medley relay
team of Fred Haywood, John
Ferris, Brian Job, and Bob
Jamison posted a 3:33.8 win over
rivals Ejdan Pederson, Tom
Ludwig, Phil Hauser and Mike
Egan. Job, who set a new NCAA
breaststroke record the day before
(2:07.7), and Dave Shilling, who
hit a personal best-time of 2:09.9,
both handily beat Ludwig in the
200 breaststroke.
It was Bill Main and Ted
Nichols who won the most
applause, however, and rightfully
so —Stanford's divers turned in
brilliant performances on both the
1- and 3-meter boards to far
outclass USC's Ron Fujikawa and
Boone Saunders. Main won the
1-meter diving with 289.05 points
to Nichols' second-place total of
253.65; the diving tandem then
cinched the meet before the final

freestyle relay, taking another
one-two sweep on the high board
as team members cheered and
flashed signs of victory with each
successive dive.
Other key performances for
Stanford's second straight win
over USC came from freshman
sprinter Steve Carey and distance
man Tim Broderick. Carey won
the 50-yd free with a time of
:21.9, in a race somewhat marred
by differences in judging. Clear to
most judges and spectators was a
1-2-3 finish by Carey, Stanford's
Bob Bebb and Indian Rick
Eagleston. One judge, however,
called USC's Mark Mader second,
and a tie was awarded for second
place to Mader and Eagleston. In
the 100 free, Carey was awarded
second place on a judge's decision,
finishing behind Trojan Frank
Heckl ( : 4 7.2), and a
second's-tenth after Mader (:48.l).
Times a Changin'
Broderick, hampered somewhat
by the start of a cold, still
managed to get important
second-place points in an exciting
500 freestyle race which saw
USC's Greg Charlton win in
4:43.8. Broderick and Trojan
Andy Strenk were awarded a
second-place tie, although the
Stanford freshman's time, 4:44.7,
beat Strenk's by a tenth. All three
times now rank among the five
fastest in the nation.
Strenk barely managed to beat
Ferris in the 200 butterfly, with a
time of 1:55.6. Ferris clocked
1:55.9 for the event, almost two
seconds over USC rival Phil
Hauser. Twenty minutes earlier,
Ferris took third place in the
200-yd individual medley and
Shilling an important second, to
Heckl, who won the event in
1:58.3.
Backstroker Fred Haywood
remained undefeated for the
season, handily beating Pederson
and Rob Orr of USC in 2:01.2. In
addition to the medley relay,
Haywood also swam a leg on the
400 free relay with Jamison,
Carey, and Ray Collins, losing to
an SC squad which set a meet
record for the event, 3:09.9—a
record which a jubilant and
victorious Indian team certainly
did not begrudge.
Stanford hinted of things to
come the afternoon before, when
the Indians beat fourth-ranked
UCLA, 64-69. The Cards needed a
sweep of the breaststroke to win
the meet two events early, and
Job and Shilling won handily. Job
also treated the crowd to a
record-breaking performance,
establishing a new NCAA mark of
2:07.7. Shilling's 2:10.4 cut three
tenths of a second off his
second-place nationally-ranked
time; the versatile Stanford

sophomore also won tne
individual medley, as he and
Ferris swept the event from
UCLA's Carl Thomas.
Burton Blazes
One of two exciting distance
races was won by UCLA
Olympian Mike Burton, who also
took the 200 butterfly in what
must have been the afternoon's
most strenuous series of
performances. Burton edged Berk
by a second in the 1000
(10:02.5), and, after beating
Ferris in a close butterfly race,
took third in the 500. That race
was won by surprising Bob Genter
of UCLA who barely edged
Stanford's Brokerick with a
4:43.3 clocking.
Earlier, Broderick defeated
Genter and Bruin Dave O'Malley

in the 200 free. The Philadelphia
freshman posted a 1:43.8
victory, four-tenths faster than
O'Malley, whose time broke the
UCLA school record for the
event.
A strong finish by Haywood
gave him the 200 backstroke win
over UCLA's Steve Gentes;
Haywood's time for the
event—l:sB.s. Fast grab-block
starts by Bebb and Carey helped
to account for their 1-2 sweep of
the 50 over Bruin tankers Rick
Bloy and Fray Heath. Although
Bebb was officially clocked at
:22.1, three-tenths slower than
Carey, judged picked the Stanford
sophomore first.
The other sprint event, the 100
free, was won by UCLA's
O'Malley in :48.5. Finishing

second and third were Eagleston
(:48.6) and Collins (:48.9) for the
Indians. Stanford and UCLA also
split the diving, as Gordon Creed
of UCLA became the Indians' first
opponent this season to win the
3-meter board.

LOS ANGELES-"We may be
beaten but we won't be
surprised," said Coach Peter
Daland the day before his USC
squad lost to the Stanford
swimming team, 59-54.
Poor Mr. Daland. He was
urprised, too.
Daland told the Daily Friday
afternoon, as he watched Stanford
float by UCLA, 64-49, that he
was sure he knew exactly what
every Indian swimmer would go
against his Trojans; the USC
coach, whose only two losses in
1 15 meets have been to Stanford,
was banking on Brent Berk to
swim the 200 free, and, conceding
31 points to the Indians before
the meet (medley relay,
