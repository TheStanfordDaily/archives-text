Friday's Daily erroneously listed Carl B.
Spaeth as one of the Law School professors
who signed a petition opposing the
appointment of Judge Carswell to the Supreme
Court. Mr. Spaeth was not present at the Law
School when the petition was circulated, he was
not aware of the contents of the petition, and
his name does not appear on the petition.
