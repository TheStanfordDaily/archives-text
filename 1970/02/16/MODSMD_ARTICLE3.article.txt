# Info Center 'Overextended'; More Reductions Anticipated
## 
### CATHY COOPER 
Walter Bell, Director of the
East Palo Alto Information
Center, is optimistic about solving
the poverty problem, but only if
the financial resources are
available.
Federal support for poverty
programs such as Info has
declined each year since the
declaration of war on poverty.
Reduction in grants from the
Office of Economic Opportunity
in January and anticipated cuts in
March imperils the continuation
of the Info Center's service to the
poor east of Bayshore.
Bell said that Info is operating
on an "overextended budget"
right now and that the two staff
members are working on a
"volunteer" basis because he has
no money with which to pay
them. "I'm looking for money to
pay them right now," he said.
Last year Info provided 2500
poor and their families with
assistance, ranging from help
finding a job or dealing with
government agencies to providing
food to feed a hungry family,
money to pay the rent or support
in dealing with the law.
Talking in an interview about
the center's philosophy of
comprehensive service to the
poor, Bell said, "People usually
come to us with one problem
which actually is interpolated
with several other problems. We
try to help the individual and his
family, not just confining
ourselves to any one aspect of
poverty."
Expects Further Cuts
The current budget ends March
31 and Bell expects further cuts.
The Economic Opportunity
Counsel of San Mateo County, the
body which appropriates funds
for this area will have $200,000
less to distribute among its
applicants than it did last year.
Info's staff was cut by nearly
half in .January and further cuts

seem inevitable. Other sources of
support must be found if Info is
to continue its work among the
poor.
The Black Student Union and
the Nairobi community have
undertaken a joint project to raise
$4,000 to insure the survival of
Info Center.
John Minor, who heads the
campus fund-raising campaign,
reports that the initial week of the
drive drew encouraging response
from fraternities and individual
professors but additional support
is needed. Those desiring to
contribute, says Minor, may mail
checks to Black House, c/o
Tresidder Union, or stop by the
BSU table in White Plaza this
week.
Bell now spends a greater part
of his time in a money hunt. In
attempting to raise funds
privately, he had found that large
foundations will not make grants
to government-supported agencies
like Info. The money therefore
must come from local sources.
Info's $55,000 budget doesn't
provide the money for many of
the Center's services like
dispensing money to get the
electricity turned back on, pay
rent, buy food or meet bail.
"Rather," says Bell, "as such
needs arises we call upon our
outside resources for funds to
handle that specific problem."
Bell stated that another
important function of Info is
organizing within East Palo Alto.
"We're the only group that does a
lot of organizing in East Palo
Alto—east of the Bayshore," he
said.
In addition to the services that
are available at the center on Bay
Road in East Palo Alto, Info
directs its clients to other sources
of assistance such as the Welfare
Department or Legal Aid.
In turn, other agencies refer
"emergency cases" to Info when
the referring organization is

neither permitted or equipped to
handle the problem.
'Just Have to Help'
It is not infrequent, says one
Info staffer, to have families
newly arrived in the area pull up
in front of the Info Center with
all their possessions in the car,
having no food, no money, no
place to stay, no job and no
gasoline. "We just have to help
them," she says.
The staff of Info, prior to the
January cutback, included a
community organizer, a
Spanish-speaking aid, a job
development specialist, and a
secretary in addition to director
Bell. Three Stanford psychiatrists
each volunteer a half a day weekly
for counseling and psychiatric aid
at the center. Two BSU members
also do volunteer work for Info.
Other individuals are also asked to
particiate "from time to time,"
Bell said.
Commenting on relations
between Stanford and Info, Bell
noted that University officials are
generally interested and
sympathetic, but their aid goes no
further. "It's all rhetoric," he said.
Bell, who came to his job from
Hewlett-Packard last November,
finds his work both depressing
and satisfying. This nation's
failure to mount a serious attack
on poverty is discouraging to one
who deals personally each day
with the victims of poverty, he
said.

newly arrived in the area pull up
in front of the Info Center with
all their possessions in the car,
having no food, no money, no
place to stay, no job and no
gasoline. "We just have to help
them," she says.
The staff of Info, prior to the
January cutback, included a
community organizer, a
Spanish-speaking aid, a job
development specialist, and a
secretary in addition to director
Bell. Three Stanford psychiatrists
each volunteer a half a day weekly
for counseling and psychiatric aid
at the center. Two BSU members
also do volunteer work for Info.
Other individuals are also asked to
particiate "from time to time,"
Bell said.
Commenting on relations
between Stanford and Info, Bell
noted that University officials are
generally interested and
sympathetic, but their aid goes no
further. "It's all rhetoric," he said.
Bell, who came to his job from
Hewlett-Packard last November,
finds his work both depressing
and satisfying. This nation's
failure to mount a serious attack
on poverty is discouraging to one
who deals personally each day
with the victims of poverty, he
said.
Walter Bell, Director of the
East Palo Alto Information
Center, is optimistic about solving
the poverty problem, but only if
the financial resources are
available.
Federal support for poverty
programs such as Info has
declined each year since the
declaration of war on poverty.
Reduction in grants from the
Office of Economic Opportunity
in January and anticipated cuts in
March imperils the continuation
of the Info Center's service to the
poor east of Bayshore.
Bell said that Info is operating
on an "overextended budget"
right now and that the two staff
members are working on a
"volunteer" basis because he has
no money with which to pay
them. "I'm looking for money to
pay them right now," he said.
Last year Info provided 2500
poor and their families with
assistance, ranging from help
finding a job or dealing with
government agencies to providing
food to feed a hungry family,
money to pay the rent or support
in dealing with the law.
Talking in an interview about
the center's philosophy of
comprehensive service to the
poor, Bell said, "People usually
come to us with one problem
which actually is interpolated
with several other problems. We
try to help the individual and his
family, not just confining
ourselves to any one aspect of
poverty."
Expects Further Cuts
The current budget ends March
31 and Bell expects further cuts.
The Economic Opportunity
Counsel of San Mateo County, the
body which appropriates funds
for this area will have $200,000
less to distribute among its
applicants than it did last year.
Info's staff was cut by nearly
half in .January and further cuts

seem inevitable. Other sources of
support must be found if Info is
to continue its work among the
poor.
The Black Student Union and
the Nairobi community have
undertaken a joint project to raise
$4,000 to insure the survival of
Info Center.
John Minor, who heads the
campus fund-raising campaign,
reports that the initial week of the
drive drew encouraging response
from fraternities and individual
professors but additional support
is needed. Those desiring to
contribute, says Minor, may mail
checks to Black House, c/o
Tresidder Union, or stop by the
BSU table in White Plaza this
week.
Bell now spends a greater part
of his time in a money hunt. In
attempting to raise funds
privately, he had found that large
foundations will not make grants
to government-supported agencies
like Info. The money therefore
must come from local sources.
Info's $55,000 budget doesn't
provide the money for many of
the Center's services like
dispensing money to get the
electricity turned back on, pay
rent, buy food or meet bail.
"Rather," says Bell, "as such
needs arises we call upon our
outside resources for funds to
handle that specific problem."
Bell stated that another
important function of Info is
organizing within East Palo Alto.
"We're the only group that does a
lot of organizing in East Palo
Alto—east of the Bayshore," he
said.
In addition to the services that
are available at the center on Bay
Road in East Palo Alto, Info
directs its clients to other sources
of assistance such as the Welfare
Department or Legal Aid.
In turn, other agencies refer
"emergency cases" to Info when
the referring organization is

neither permitted or equipped to
handle the problem.

foundations will not make grants
to government-supported agencies
like Info. The money therefore
must come from local sources.
Info's $55,000 budget doesn't
provide the money for many of
the Center's services like
dispensing money to get the
electricity turned back on, pay
rent, buy food or meet bail.
"Rather," says Bell, "as such
needs arises we call upon our
outside resources for funds to
handle that specific problem."
Bell stated that another
important function of Info is
organizing within East Palo Alto.
"We're the only group that does a
lot of organizing in East Palo
Alto—east of the Bayshore," he
said.
In addition to the services that
are available at the center on Bay
Road in East Palo Alto, Info
directs its clients to other sources
of assistance such as the Welfare
Department or Legal Aid.
In turn, other agencies refer
"emergency cases" to Info when
the referring organization is

neither permitted or equipped to
handle the problem.
'Just Have to Help'
It is not infrequent, says one
Info staffer, to have families
newly arrived in the area pull up
in front of the Info Center with
all their possessions in the car,
having no food, no money, no
place to stay, no job and no
gasoline. "We just have to help
them," she says.
The staff of Info, prior to the
January cutback, included a
community organizer, a
Spanish-speaking aid, a job
development specialist, and a
secretary in addition to director
Bell. Three Stanford psychiatrists
each volunteer a half a day weekly
for counseling and psychiatric aid
at the center. Two BSU members
also do volunteer work for Info.
Other individuals are also asked to
particiate "from time to time,"
Bell said.
Commenting on relations
between Stanford and Info, Bell
noted that University officials are
generally interested and
sympathetic, but their aid goes no
further. "It's all rhetoric," he said.
Bell, who came to his job from
Hewlett-Packard last November,
finds his work both depressing
and satisfying. This nation's
failure to mount a serious attack
on poverty is discouraging to one
who deals personally each day
with the victims of poverty, he
said.
