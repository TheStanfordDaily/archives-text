# Chicago 7 Lawyers Sentenced For 38 Counts Of Contempt
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — Judge Julius J.
Hoffman sentenced one defense
attorney to four years in prison
Sunday and the other to 20
months for contempt of court in
the riot conspiracy trial of seven
men.
The judge's action came while a
U.S. District Court jury was in its
second day of deliberations in the
five-month trial stemming from
the violence that occurred in
connection with the 1968
Democratic National Convention
in Chicago.
Hoffman sentenced attorney
William M. Kunstler to 48 months
and 13 days on 24 counts of
contempt and defense attorney
Leonard I. Weinglass to 20
months and five days on 14
counts.
Hoffman said it was the first
time he had held a lawyer in
contempt.
The defense said it would
appeal the contempt citations of
the defendants and attorneys.
Before sentencing the
attorneys, the judge completed his
contempt citations against the
defendants. Jerry C. Rubin, Lee
Weiner and John R. Froines were
sentenced Sunday and whisked
off to jail to join the four
defendants sentenced and jailed
Saturday.
Rubin was cited on 15 counts
and sentenced to 25 months and
23 days in jail. Weiner received 2
months and 18 days on 7 counts
and Froines was sentenced to 6
months and 15 days on 10 counts.
Execution Stayed
Judge Hoffman stayed
execution of the attorneys'
sentences until May to allow them
to function as lawyers for the
defendants.
It took the judge nearly two

hours to read the counts of
contempt and to lecture Kunstler,
51, on his conduct through the
trial.
"Only the record can reveal
what has gone on here," said the
judge. "I have never heard a
lawyer say to a judge the things
you have said to me during this
trial.
"I recognize the obligation of a
lawyer to defend a client with
vigor for his client's full benefit of
law," he said. However, the judge
added, Kunster had exceeded "the
bounds of legal propriety" and
"the court must deal appropri
ately with that conduct."
Direct Violation of Orders
Mr. Kunstler's conduct in this
case has created "a record replete
with direct violation of the orders
of the court,"he said.
The judge viewed as some of
the most serious breaches of
conduct Kunstler's remark on one
occasion that Judge Hoffman's
ruling was "outrageous" and at
another time saying the
defendants were going to go to jail
"in a legal lynching."
Among the citations against
Weinglass was one for defying
orders from the bench, according
to Judge Hoffman, and for
"insulting remarks." Weinglass
also drew a sentence for calling a
court ruling "unfair."
He was given four months for
persisting on one occasion in as
king questions when directed by
the judge to stop.
Maximum Sentence
Six months is the maximum
sentence permitted for one count
of contempt without a jury trial.
Kunstler's sentences ranged
from seven days to six months;
Weinglass from two days to five

months; and the defendants' from
one day to six months.
Weinglass said before the
sentencing, "I welcome the
opportunity of whatever the court
does which will enable me to once
again rejoin the defendants in
what has been the richest
association of my life."
Thomas Sullivan, representing
the sentenced lawyers, brought up
the question of bonds and Judge
Hoffman, said, "I have no
authority to fix bonds" and
recessed the session.
Lawyers Blamed
Sullivan said he would file a
motion for bonds in the Circuit
Court of Appeals.
Before sentencing Kunstler,
Judge Hoffman said he blames
increased crime in the country
partly on lawyers.
"I am one of those who believe
that the increase of crime in this
country is due in large part to
lawyers waiting in the wings
willing to go beyond professional
duty in the defense of a client,"
the judge said.
In his statement before

sentencing, Kunstler, 51, of New
York City, said: "I am sorry I lost
my composure Saturday. I felt
such frustration that I cried
publicly for the first time since I
was a child. I am sorry for
disrupting the decorum of the
court, but I am not ashamed of
my tears.
Not Sorry
"I am not sorry for any acts in
the conduct of defending my
clients," he added. "I only hope
my fate does not deter other
lawyers who will be asked to
defend clients against the
encroaching federal government. .
Kunstler added that he and the
other defense attorney, Leonard I.
Weinglass, were "the most
privileged of men because we are
going to be punished for what we
believe in."
There was applause from the
spectators section, and the judge
ordered: "Remove those who
applauded. The circus has to end
sometime."
Ten persons were removed
without incident.

lawyer say to a judge the things
you have said to me during this
trial.
"I recognize the obligation of a
lawyer to defend a client with
vigor for his client's full benefit of
law," he said. However, the judge
added, Kunster had exceeded "the
bounds of legal propriety" and
"the court must deal appropri
ately with that conduct."
Direct Violation of Orders
Mr. Kunstler's conduct in this
case has created "a record replete
with direct violation of the orders
of the court,"he said.
The judge viewed as some of
the most serious breaches of
conduct Kunstler's remark on one
occasion that Judge Hoffman's
ruling was "outrageous" and at
another time saying the
defendants were going to go to jail
"in a legal lynching."
Among the citations against
Weinglass was one for defying
orders from the bench, according
to Judge Hoffman, and for
"insulting remarks." Weinglass
also drew a sentence for calling a
court ruling "unfair."
He was given four months for
persisting on one occasion in as
king questions when directed by
the judge to stop.
Maximum Sentence
Six months is the maximum
sentence permitted for one count
of contempt without a jury trial.
Kunstler's sentences ranged
from seven days to six months;
Weinglass from two days to five

months; and the defendants' from
one day to six months.
Weinglass said before the
sentencing, "I welcome the
opportunity of whatever the court
does which will enable me to once
again rejoin the defendants in
what has been the richest
association of my life."
Thomas Sullivan, representing
the sentenced lawyers, brought up
the question of bonds and Judge
Hoffman, said, "I have no
authority to fix bonds" and
recessed the session.
Lawyers Blamed
Sullivan said he would file a
motion for bonds in the Circuit
Court of Appeals.
Before sentencing Kunstler,
Judge Hoffman said he blames
increased crime in the country
partly on lawyers.
"I am one of those who believe
that the increase of crime in this
country is due in large part to
lawyers waiting in the wings
willing to go beyond professional
duty in the defense of a client,"
the judge said.
In his statement before

sentencing, Kunstler, 51, of New
York City, said: "I am sorry I lost
my composure Saturday. I felt
such frustration that I cried
publicly for the first time since I
was a child. I am sorry for
disrupting the decorum of the
court, but I am not ashamed of
my tears.
Not Sorry
"I am not sorry for any acts in
the conduct of defending my
clients," he added. "I only hope
my fate does not deter other
lawyers who will be asked to
defend clients against the
encroaching federal government. .
Kunstler added that he and the
other defense attorney, Leonard I.
Weinglass, were "the most
privileged of men because we are
going to be punished for what we
believe in."
There was applause from the
spectators section, and the judge
ordered: "Remove those who
applauded. The circus has to end
sometime."
Ten persons were removed
without incident.
CHICAGO (AP) — Judge Julius J.
Hoffman sentenced one defense
attorney to four years in prison
Sunday and the other to 20
months for contempt of court in
the riot conspiracy trial of seven
men.
The judge's action came while a
U.S. District Court jury was in its
second day of deliberations in the
five-month trial stemming from
the violence that occurred in
connection with the 1968
Democratic National Convention
in Chicago.
Hoffman sentenced attorney
William M. Kunstler to 48 months
and 13 days on 24 counts of
contempt and defense attorney
Leonard I. Weinglass to 20
months and five days on 14
counts.
Hoffman said it was the first
time he had held a lawyer in
contempt.
The defense said it would
appeal the contempt citations of
the defendants and attorneys.
Before sentencing the
attorneys, the judge completed his
contempt citations against the
defendants. Jerry C. Rubin, Lee
Weiner and John R. Froines were
sentenced Sunday and whisked
off to jail to join the four
defendants sentenced and jailed
Saturday.
Rubin was cited on 15 counts
and sentenced to 25 months and
23 days in jail. Weiner received 2
months and 18 days on 7 counts
and Froines was sentenced to 6
months and 15 days on 10 counts.
Execution Stayed
Judge Hoffman stayed
execution of the attorneys'
sentences until May to allow them
to function as lawyers for the
defendants.
It took the judge nearly two

hours to read the counts of
contempt and to lecture Kunstler,
51, on his conduct through the
trial.
"Only the record can reveal
what has gone on here," said the
judge. "I have never heard a

Sullivan said he would file a
motion for bonds in the Circuit
Court of Appeals.
Before sentencing Kunstler,
Judge Hoffman said he blames
increased crime in the country
partly on lawyers.
"I am one of those who believe
that the increase of crime in this
country is due in large part to
lawyers waiting in the wings
willing to go beyond professional
duty in the defense of a client,"
the judge said.
In his statement before

sentencing, Kunstler, 51, of New
York City, said: "I am sorry I lost
my composure Saturday. I felt
such frustration that I cried
publicly for the first time since I
was a child. I am sorry for
disrupting the decorum of the
court, but I am not ashamed of
my tears.
Not Sorry
"I am not sorry for any acts in
the conduct of defending my
clients," he added. "I only hope
my fate does not deter other
lawyers who will be asked to
defend clients against the
encroaching federal government. .
Kunstler added that he and the
other defense attorney, Leonard I.
Weinglass, were "the most
privileged of men because we are
going to be punished for what we
believe in."
There was applause from the
spectators section, and the judge
ordered: "Remove those who
applauded. The circus has to end
sometime."
Ten persons were removed
without incident.
CHICAGO (AP) — Judge Julius J.
Hoffman sentenced one defense
attorney to four years in prison
Sunday and the other to 20
months for contempt of court in
the riot conspiracy trial of seven
men.
The judge's action came while a
U.S. District Court jury was in its
second day of deliberations in the
five-month trial stemming from
the violence that occurred in
connection with the 1968
Democratic National Convention
in Chicago.
Hoffman sentenced attorney
William M. Kunstler to 48 months
and 13 days on 24 counts of
contempt and defense attorney
Leonard I. Weinglass to 20
months and five days on 14
counts.
Hoffman said it was the first
time he had held a lawyer in
contempt.
The defense said it would
appeal the contempt citations of
the defendants and attorneys.
Before sentencing the
attorneys, the judge completed his
contempt citations against the
defendants. Jerry C. Rubin, Lee
Weiner and John R. Froines were
sentenced Sunday and whisked
off to jail to join the four
defendants sentenced and jailed
Saturday.
Rubin was cited on 15 counts
and sentenced to 25 months and
23 days in jail. Weiner received 2
months and 18 days on 7 counts
and Froines was sentenced to 6
months and 15 days on 10 counts.
Execution Stayed
Judge Hoffman stayed
execution of the attorneys'
sentences until May to allow them
to function as lawyers for the
defendants.
It took the judge nearly two

hours to read the counts of
contempt and to lecture Kunstler,
51, on his conduct through the
trial.
"Only the record can reveal
what has gone on here," said the
judge. "I have never heard a
lawyer say to a judge the things
you have said to me during this
trial.
"I recognize the obligation of a
lawyer to defend a client with
vigor for his client's full benefit of
law," he said. However, the judge
added, Kunster had exceeded "the
bounds of legal propriety" and
"the court must deal appropri
ately with that conduct."
Direct Violation of Orders
Mr. Kunstler's conduct in this
case has created "a record replete
with direct violation of the orders
of the court,"he said.
The judge viewed as some of
the most serious breaches of
conduct Kunstler's remark on one
occasion that Judge Hoffman's
ruling was "outrageous" and at
another time saying the
defendants were going to go to jail
"in a legal lynching."
Among the citations against
Weinglass was one for defying
orders from the bench, according
to Judge Hoffman, and for
"insulting remarks." Weinglass
also drew a sentence for calling a
court ruling "unfair."
He was given four months for
persisting on one occasion in as
king questions when directed by
the judge to stop.
Maximum Sentence
Six months is the maximum
sentence permitted for one count
of contempt without a jury trial.
Kunstler's sentences ranged
from seven days to six months;
Weinglass from two days to five

months; and the defendants' from
one day to six months.
Weinglass said before the
sentencing, "I welcome the
opportunity of whatever the court
does which will enable me to once
again rejoin the defendants in
what has been the richest
association of my life."
Thomas Sullivan, representing
the sentenced lawyers, brought up
the question of bonds and Judge
Hoffman, said, "I have no
authority to fix bonds" and
recessed the session.
