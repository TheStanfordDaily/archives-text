citations against defense
attorneys and defendants in

use of judicial power."

gravest concern the
extraordinary and
unconstitutional use of
summary contempt power at
the end of a trial," an ACLU
statement read.
Board chairman Edward J.
Ennis said at a news
conference, "We are very much

concerned witn the
unconstitutional use of judicial
power in this case." He said the
ACLU expected to "take a
very substantial role" in
expected appeals.

Kunstler and Leonard
Weinglass were sentenced to 48
months and 20 months,
respectively, Sunday for
contempt of court in the trial
