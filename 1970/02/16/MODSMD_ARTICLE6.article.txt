# Huey Newton Birthday Rally Opens Liberation Week
## 
### 
This week has been designated
Liberation Week by a coalition of
Stanford groups seeking to
educate the Stanford community
about problems such as ROTC
and political suppression.
Tonight at 8:00 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium the
Stanford Committee Against War

and Fascism will present the Huey
P. Newton Birthday Rally.
Although organized before
Liberation Week, the rally, a
related event, will feature speakers
Ray "Masai" Hewitt, the Black
Panther Minister of Education;
revolutionary folksinger Elaine
Brown; and Panther attorney
Charles Garry.
Immediately following the rally
a Torch Light Parade will proceed
from Memorial Auditorium to
downtown Palo Alto to protest
the trial and treatment of the
Chicago Seven, and the recent
contempt charges against them
Mike Wolfe and Lennie Siegel
will debate the question "Is
ROTC Desirable?" at 4:15 p.m. in
Tresidder.
The week's activities should
reach a high point on Wednesday,
"Insurgency Day." Paul Rupert,
an ex-ROTC cadet, and Art
Bussey are slated to speak at a
noon rally in White Plaza
concerning ROTC.
After the rally, expected to be
brief, there will be a march to
President Pitzer's office to present
the petitions against kOTC which
have been circulating around
Stanford in recent weeks.
