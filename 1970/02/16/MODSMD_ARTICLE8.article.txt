# Women's Liberation
## A 						Program For Liberation At Stanford 
### Amanda Rutherford Sandra Peter 
Women's Liberation is the
concern of all women in the
Stanford community — students,
employees, faculty, and wives — as
well as of all men in the
community, who are also the
victims of artificial and
dehumanizing sexual roles. We
realize that we are oppressed not
simply individually or by
particular men, but collectively as
women, and by social structures
which enforce male supremacy
and encourage attitudes of male
chauvinism from which individual
women cannot escape.
As women at Stanford, we face
a particular challenge, for the
university is an instrument by
which male supremacy is
institutionalized, perpetuated, and
Spread. Approximately 4000
women students and faculty,
women workers, and an untold
number of wives of employees of
employees and students are
oppressed directly here, but many
times more are indirectly affected
when the teachers and other
professionals Stanford has trained
in an atmosphere of systematic
oppression and exploitation of
women assume positions of
responsibility in society. As the

area's second largest employer,
Stanford also exercises great
influence over employment
patterns in the mid-peninsula.
Today Stanford serves the
interests of a few prominent men
in business and government. It
must be changed so that it serves
the people and meets their needs.
We present the following
proposals for change at Stanford
to begin the eradication of male
supremacy and the liberation of
both women and men. In a later
article we will explain the specific
wage and hiring practices,admis
sions policies, and psychological
pressures which lead us to this
position.
