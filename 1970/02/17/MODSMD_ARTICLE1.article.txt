# 'Day After' Sparks Berkeley Violence
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
A rally called to protest the
Chicago 7 trial spilled over into
the streets of Berkeley as crowds
of the protesters shattered
windows and battled with police.
Short speeches and the "trial"
of Judge Julius Hoffman in Provo
Park quickly fizzled as an
afternoon of window-breading,
rock-throwing, and
student-clubbing began.
The rally was called to mark
"The Day After" contempt
citations to the seven defendents
and two lawyers were handed
down.
Shortly after the crowd began
to gather, a group of
demonstrators began to throw
rocks at the Federal Building
across from the park.
The crowd began to move out
of the park and into the streets. In
a matter of minutes, store
windows along Shattuck Avenue
were smashed, as the crowd began
to move towards Telegraph
Avenue.
"It's the worst damage I've ever
seen here," noted longtime
Berkeley resident.
One women was injured by
flying glass when the crowd
moved in the Wells Fargo bank,
breaking almost every pane of
glass in the facade.
Along Telegraph, it was much
the same story, a broken pane or
two, but little else. Some stores
had had special iron covers
installed after last spring's
People's Park demonstrations,
while others, such as the Bank of
America, had simply bricked up
their buildings.
The police moved in and out,
acting in a confused and
restrained manner. They grouped
together; then, as if they had
forgotten instructions, divided
once more.
Some people began to
distribute first aid handouts.

Other people began to run, and
still others stayed to watch.
The police attempted to isolate
the demonstrators and
simultaneously push them out of
downtown Berkeley. Moving
quickly in groups of four, they
cruised in squad cars, suddenly
pulling up to a corner to arrest a
few demonstrators. More
firecrackers and stones began to
fly, as the crowd began its retreat
down Shattuck.
Calmer demonstrators began
yelling, "Walk, Walk, Walk," at
the others, as groups began
running east towards campus.
Finally, the rain and the night
took over, and a relative calm
prevailed.
In the parking lot that was once
People's Park, two cars were
attacked by persons unknown;
their windows were broken, their
fenders smashed.
