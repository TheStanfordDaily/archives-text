# Mudslinging Condemned
## Everything Is Interrelated 
### Joe Califf 
It is unfortunate that many
arguments between ecologists and
engineers wind up being
name-calling shouting matches.
Unless headed off now, the
Eliassen-Groth-Baughn & Krist
controversy could easily steer this
spring's environmental quality
teach-in toward extremely
unproductive ends.
Ned Groth's article two weeks
ago was not an attack on Dr.
Eliassen Der se, but on the
technocrat and his rigid criteria
for problem solving, namely,
"find a need and build
something." Jim Baughn and
Gordon Krist thought they were
answering this complaint, but
wound up spouting the same old
line: engineers aren't responsible
for the evils of technology; they
just cater to society's desires. We
realize that technology must be
used to satisfy human needs. But
who is going to decide what these
needs are? Technocrats?
Ecologists?
M«'dia's Role
Media reports on environmental
deterioration maintain that

ecologists can solve our problems,
or, that if engineers will only
consider environmental factors in
development, everything will be
fine. This is utter nonsense.
The study of ecology shows
that everything is interrelated.
The effects of stress on a portion
of the environment are too
complicated to fully predict the
outcome. We don't know the
consequences of nuclear power
production, disease control,
increased agricultural crop yields,
etc. EXCEPT that the
environment will not be the same
afterwards. Any technological
innovation which minimizes
ecologic damage is only a stop-gap
measure at best, and at worst,
only shifts the burden from one
part of the ecosystem to another.
While technology does change
the environment, environmental
engineers can minimize the bad
effects. But it is becoming
increasingly clear that our
environment will continue to
deteriorate, regardless of the work
of either ecologists or engineers,
unless 1 ) Population Control is
Achieved, and 2) The American
Life Slyle is Fundamentally
Ch a n ge d.
Population
The overriding problem is
population With uncontrolled
growth, we will soon see the day
when water and air pollution
problems will seem petty and
irrelevant. We'll have our hands
full providing those old fashioned
necessities, food and shelter. Since

40 percent of the world's
population goes to bed hungry
every night, this may already be
yesterday's problem, not
tomorrow's. But even if effective
population control could be
instantaneously imposed, our
escalating use of non-renewable
resources would soon exhaust the
world's supply. Resources must be
recycled; and we must reject the
attitude that "growth is good"
and that material accumulation is
a measure of success.
New Life Style
The debate over environmental
and technological progress is not
simply a conflict between
conservationists and developers. It
is the result of an internal struggle
within all of us. We decry
automobile pollution and endless
miles of asphalt, yet we want
automobiles to take us where we
want when we want. We decry
urban sprawl, yet we don't want
to live in the city. We deplore
power plants that deplete fuel
supplies, generate pollution, or
create radiation hazards, yet we
continue to increase our own
power consumption. (Per capita
consumption of electricity
increased 60 percent from 1960
to 1968). We are alarmed at
depletion of the world's natural
resources, yet we eagerly consume
more and more products each
year.
If we are to have a decent
environment, we must change our
desires and aspirations to reflect
our basic needs, not superficial

wants. Correspondingly, if people
are to change their desires and life
styles, we must also consider
radical changes in our
governmental and industrial
institutions as well. Now is the
time to discuss institutional
change, not the proper way to
dispose of garbage.
Unity
Both ecologists and engineers
who care about the environment
must concentrate their attack on
social institutions, not each other.
Classifying ecologists as "butterfly
chasers" or engineers as
"bulldozer jockeys" is wasted
effort. The ecologist must shift his
efforts to the study of dynamic
systems rather than stable or
evolutionary systems. When he
spots trouble, he must formulate
an action program (lacking in the
Groth article) and scream bloody
murder for correction. And the
technocrat must begin measuring
the quality of output, ot just the
quantity. The businessman must
consider the total cost of his
product, including recovery or
disposal, before the market
system can properly function.
Ecology, if properly emphasized,
can be used to head off trouble.
Technology, if properly applied,
can accomplish many of our
mutual goals. Working together,
we can identify problems and
determine corrective policy.
Working against each other will
accomplish nothing.

world's supply. Resources must be
recycled; and we must reject the
attitude that "growth is good"
and that material accumulation is
a measure of success.
New Life Style
The debate over environmental
and technological progress is not
simply a conflict between
conservationists and developers. It
is the result of an internal struggle
within all of us. We decry
automobile pollution and endless
miles of asphalt, yet we want
automobiles to take us where we
want when we want. We decry
urban sprawl, yet we don't want
to live in the city. We deplore
power plants that deplete fuel
supplies, generate pollution, or
create radiation hazards, yet we
continue to increase our own
power consumption. (Per capita
consumption of electricity
increased 60 percent from 1960
to 1968). We are alarmed at
depletion of the world's natural
resources, yet we eagerly consume
more and more products each
year.
If we are to have a decent
environment, we must change our
desires and aspirations to reflect
our basic needs, not superficial

wants. Correspondingly, if people
are to change their desires and life
styles, we must also consider
radical changes in our
governmental and industrial
institutions as well. Now is the
time to discuss institutional
change, not the proper way to
dispose of garbage.
Unity
Both ecologists and engineers
who care about the environment
must concentrate their attack on
social institutions, not each other.
Classifying ecologists as "butterfly
chasers" or engineers as
"bulldozer jockeys" is wasted
effort. The ecologist must shift his
efforts to the study of dynamic
systems rather than stable or
evolutionary systems. When he
spots trouble, he must formulate
an action program (lacking in the
Groth article) and scream bloody
murder for correction. And the
technocrat must begin measuring
the quality of output, ot just the
quantity. The businessman must
consider the total cost of his
product, including recovery or
disposal, before the market
system can properly function.
Ecology, if properly emphasized,
can be used to head off trouble.
Technology, if properly applied,
can accomplish many of our
mutual goals. Working together,
we can identify problems and
determine corrective policy.
Working against each other will
accomplish nothing.
(Joe Califf is a graduate student
in civil engineering.)
It is unfortunate that many
arguments between ecologists and
engineers wind up being
name-calling shouting matches.
Unless headed off now, the
Eliassen-Groth-Baughn & Krist
controversy could easily steer this
spring's environmental quality
teach-in toward extremely
unproductive ends.
Ned Groth's article two weeks
ago was not an attack on Dr.
Eliassen Der se, but on the
technocrat and his rigid criteria
for problem solving, namely,
"find a need and build
something." Jim Baughn and
Gordon Krist thought they were
answering this complaint, but
wound up spouting the same old
line: engineers aren't responsible
for the evils of technology; they
just cater to society's desires. We
realize that technology must be
used to satisfy human needs. But
who is going to decide what these
needs are? Technocrats?
Ecologists?
M«'dia's Role
Media reports on environmental
deterioration maintain that

ecologists can solve our problems,
or, that if engineers will only
consider environmental factors in
development, everything will be
fine. This is utter nonsense.
The study of ecology shows
that everything is interrelated.
The effects of stress on a portion
of the environment are too
complicated to fully predict the
outcome. We don't know the
consequences of nuclear power
production, disease control,
increased agricultural crop yields,
etc. EXCEPT that the
environment will not be the same
afterwards. Any technological
innovation which minimizes
ecologic damage is only a stop-gap
measure at best, and at worst,
only shifts the burden from one
part of the ecosystem to another.
While technology does change
the environment, environmental
engineers can minimize the bad
effects. But it is becoming
increasingly clear that our
environment will continue to
deteriorate, regardless of the work
of either ecologists or engineers,
unless 1 ) Population Control is
Achieved, and 2) The American
Life Slyle is Fundamentally
Ch a n ge d.
Population
The overriding problem is
population With uncontrolled
growth, we will soon see the day
when water and air pollution
problems will seem petty and
irrelevant. We'll have our hands
full providing those old fashioned
necessities, food and shelter. Since

40 percent of the world's
population goes to bed hungry
every night, this may already be
yesterday's problem, not
tomorrow's. But even if effective
population control could be
instantaneously imposed, our
escalating use of non-renewable
resources would soon exhaust the
world's supply. Resources must be
recycled; and we must reject the
attitude that "growth is good"
and that material accumulation is

spring's environmental quality
teach-in toward extremely
unproductive ends.
Ned Groth's article two weeks
ago was not an attack on Dr.
Eliassen Der se, but on the
technocrat and his rigid criteria
for problem solving, namely,
"find a need and build
something." Jim Baughn and
Gordon Krist thought they were
answering this complaint, but
wound up spouting the same old
line: engineers aren't responsible
for the evils of technology; they
just cater to society's desires. We
realize that technology must be
used to satisfy human needs. But
who is going to decide what these
needs are? Technocrats?
Ecologists?
M«'dia's Role
Media reports on environmental
deterioration maintain that

ecologists can solve our problems,
or, that if engineers will only
consider environmental factors in
development, everything will be
fine. This is utter nonsense.
The study of ecology shows
that everything is interrelated.
The effects of stress on a portion
of the environment are too
complicated to fully predict the
outcome. We don't know the
consequences of nuclear power
production, disease control,
increased agricultural crop yields,
etc. EXCEPT that the
environment will not be the same
afterwards. Any technological
innovation which minimizes
ecologic damage is only a stop-gap
measure at best, and at worst,
only shifts the burden from one
part of the ecosystem to another.
While technology does change
the environment, environmental
engineers can minimize the bad
effects. But it is becoming
increasingly clear that our
environment will continue to
deteriorate, regardless of the work
of either ecologists or engineers,
unless 1 ) Population Control is
Achieved, and 2) The American
Life Slyle is Fundamentally
Ch a n ge d.
Population
The overriding problem is
population With uncontrolled
growth, we will soon see the day
when water and air pollution
problems will seem petty and
irrelevant. We'll have our hands
full providing those old fashioned
necessities, food and shelter. Since

40 percent of the world's
population goes to bed hungry
every night, this may already be
yesterday's problem, not
tomorrow's. But even if effective
population control could be
instantaneously imposed, our
escalating use of non-renewable
resources would soon exhaust the
world's supply. Resources must be
recycled; and we must reject the
attitude that "growth is good"
and that material accumulation is
a measure of success.
New Life Style
The debate over environmental
and technological progress is not
simply a conflict between
conservationists and developers. It
is the result of an internal struggle
within all of us. We decry
automobile pollution and endless
miles of asphalt, yet we want
automobiles to take us where we
want when we want. We decry
urban sprawl, yet we don't want
to live in the city. We deplore
power plants that deplete fuel
supplies, generate pollution, or
create radiation hazards, yet we
continue to increase our own
power consumption. (Per capita
consumption of electricity
increased 60 percent from 1960
to 1968). We are alarmed at
depletion of the world's natural
resources, yet we eagerly consume
more and more products each
year.
If we are to have a decent
environment, we must change our
desires and aspirations to reflect
our basic needs, not superficial

wants. Correspondingly, if people
are to change their desires and life
styles, we must also consider
radical changes in our
governmental and industrial
institutions as well. Now is the
time to discuss institutional
change, not the proper way to
dispose of garbage.
Unity
Both ecologists and engineers
who care about the environment
must concentrate their attack on
social institutions, not each other.
Classifying ecologists as "butterfly
chasers" or engineers as
"bulldozer jockeys" is wasted
effort. The ecologist must shift his
efforts to the study of dynamic
systems rather than stable or
evolutionary systems. When he
spots trouble, he must formulate
an action program (lacking in the
Groth article) and scream bloody
murder for correction. And the
technocrat must begin measuring
the quality of output, ot just the
quantity. The businessman must
consider the total cost of his
product, including recovery or
disposal, before the market
system can properly function.
Ecology, if properly emphasized,
can be used to head off trouble.
Technology, if properly applied,
can accomplish many of our
mutual goals. Working together,
we can identify problems and
determine corrective policy.
Working against each other will
accomplish nothing.
