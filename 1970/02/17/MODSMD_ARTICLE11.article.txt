The Junipcro Incident
Fditor, TIIF DAILY:
As Faculty Resident of
Junipero House I want to make it
unmistakably clear that we reject
and condemn the drawing of
swastikas on the doors of our
dorm and, even more, the threat
aimed at two members of the
House. The girls had grave reason
to be outraged and frightened,
and the terrible fact is that they
felt so alone in the House that
they hesitated to confide in
anyone there.
We cannot forget or ignore
what has happened; we are all
shaken by it; we are all affected
by it. During the two weeks
between the occurrences and the
publication of the Daily story
yesterday, the House has been
almost completely occupied with
trying to confront the ugly facts
and trying—through individual
soul-searching, through
conversations and discussions,
through several House
Meetings to understand what the
situation means and who and
where we are.
Right after the House meeting
at which the intimidation and
threat were brought out into tin*
open, students spontaneously
began to take action. For several

nights students stood watch
around the House to detect any
suspicious persons during the
hours when the incidents took
place. Moreover, I and the two
Resident Assistants have been
systematically talking to everyone
in the House individually about
the incident. In addition, the
Director of Wilbur Hall, of which
Juniper is a part, immediately
began an investigation, and that is
now being pursued through the
Dean of Students' Office.
From listening and talking to
people in the House and from
hearing what they have been
saying in House meetings, 1 know
that the response of the House is
deep and strong: the reasons for
this incident must be understood
so that this kind of thing may not
happen again.

The Daily of Wednesday,
February 11, carried a story on
ROTC in which I was quoted as
saying Stanford receives no
monetary reimbursement for the
junior college students enrolled in
ROTC work on this campus. Your

reporter quoted me accurately,
but I was in error. Colonel
Ramey, who was also quoted, was
correct. The junior colleges
concerned are billed on a pro rala
basis. The resulting income is used
as a source of funds for the small
administrative budget for the
Military Science program.

February 11, carried a story on
ROTC in which I was quoted as
saying Stanford receives no
monetary reimbursement for the
junior college students enrolled in
ROTC work on this campus. Your

reporter quoted me accurately,
but I was in error. Colonel
Ramey, who was also quoted, was
correct. The junior colleges
concerned are billed on a pro rala
basis. The resulting income is used
as a source of funds for the small
administrative budget for the
Military Science program.

The Junipcro Incident
Fditor, TIIF DAILY:
As Faculty Resident of
Junipero House I want to make it
unmistakably clear that we reject
and condemn the drawing of
swastikas on the doors of our
dorm and, even more, the threat
aimed at two members of the
House. The girls had grave reason
to be outraged and frightened,
and the terrible fact is that they
felt so alone in the House that
they hesitated to confide in
anyone there.
We cannot forget or ignore
what has happened; we are all
shaken by it; we are all affected
by it. During the two weeks
between the occurrences and the
publication of the Daily story
yesterday, the House has been
almost completely occupied with
trying to confront the ugly facts
and trying—through individual
soul-searching, through
conversations and discussions,
through several House
Meetings to understand what the
situation means and who and
where we are.
Right after the House meeting
at which the intimidation and
threat were brought out into tin*
open, students spontaneously
began to take action. For several

nights students stood watch
around the House to detect any
suspicious persons during the
hours when the incidents took
place. Moreover, I and the two
Resident Assistants have been
systematically talking to everyone
in the House individually about
the incident. In addition, the
Director of Wilbur Hall, of which
Juniper is a part, immediately
began an investigation, and that is
now being pursued through the
Dean of Students' Office.
From listening and talking to
people in the House and from
hearing what they have been
saying in House meetings, 1 know
that the response of the House is
deep and strong: the reasons for
this incident must be understood
so that this kind of thing may not
happen again.
