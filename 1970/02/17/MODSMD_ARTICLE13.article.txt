# Lyman Denounces Anti-Intellectualism
## 
### 
There is a world-wide
"egalitarian rage" against
distinction and achievement, and
u is contributing "heavily to the
wave of anti-intellectualism that is
threatening the U. 5.," Stanford
University Provost Richard W.
Lyman warned last week.
"The attack on intellectual
distinction is about as severe from
'he Left as from the Right,"
Lyman said, and it is linked with
the theme that "objective thought
is an impossibility."
This, he said, "expresses a
defeatism about the human
potential so severe as to stagger
the imagination. Seldom has
glorification of instinct enjoyed a
greater popularity than today.
Linked as it is on the Left with a
sweeping and uncritical
egalitarianism, the new idolatry of
feeling over thinking is a potent
and ultimately destructive force in
the academic community."
The link-up of egalitarianism
and anti-intellectualism is nothing
new, Lyman said.
"From the Know-Nothings to
Joseph McCarthy, the America of
the backwoods and the
backstreets alike has sadly often
found the notion of intellectual
distinction one of the most
infuriating forms of hierarchy. We
have seen in George Wallace's
campaign that the virus has not
died out," Lyman continued,
"though people's susceptibility to
it did not turn out to be quite as
great as many had feared during
the campaign—perhaps because he
did not succeed in monopolizing
the anti-intellectual vote—a fact
that has become clearer since the
memoriable phrase 'effete snobs'
entered the literature of our
time."
Lyman, noting that intellectual
enterprise thrives on aspiration
toward excellence, warned that

"it cannot thrive in an atmosphere
of mingled contempt for high
quality and distrust of the rational
as opposed to the nonrational."
"It is therefore threatened to
an unusual degree by the revolt
against reason which today joins
hands with a revolt against both
authority and hierarchy in any
and all forms, legitimate and
illegitimate alike."
A true egalitarian society,
Lyman insisted, "exists only in
the minds of revolutionary
idealist's." He reminded his
audience that in Nazi Germany,
people were told to "think with
their blood—because it was a good
excuse for not thinking, but also
because everyone has blood,
therefore no intellectually
snobbish, upstage superior persons
can look down on you any
longer."

Joseph McCarthy, the America of
the backwoods and the
backstreets alike has sadly often
found the notion of intellectual
distinction one of the most
infuriating forms of hierarchy. We
have seen in George Wallace's
campaign that the virus has not
died out," Lyman continued,
"though people's susceptibility to
it did not turn out to be quite as
great as many had feared during
the campaign—perhaps because he
did not succeed in monopolizing
the anti-intellectual vote—a fact
that has become clearer since the
memoriable phrase 'effete snobs'
entered the literature of our
time."
Lyman, noting that intellectual
enterprise thrives on aspiration
toward excellence, warned that

"it cannot thrive in an atmosphere
of mingled contempt for high
quality and distrust of the rational
as opposed to the nonrational."
"It is therefore threatened to
an unusual degree by the revolt
against reason which today joins
hands with a revolt against both
authority and hierarchy in any
and all forms, legitimate and
illegitimate alike."
A true egalitarian society,
Lyman insisted, "exists only in
the minds of revolutionary
idealist's." He reminded his
audience that in Nazi Germany,
people were told to "think with
their blood—because it was a good
excuse for not thinking, but also
because everyone has blood,
therefore no intellectually
snobbish, upstage superior persons
can look down on you any
longer."

Provost Richard W. Lyman condemned
what he called an "egalialarian rage"
against distinction and achievement at
the annual llii Bet a Kappa dinner last
week.
There is a world-wide
"egalitarian rage" against
distinction and achievement, and
u is contributing "heavily to the
wave of anti-intellectualism that is
threatening the U. 5.," Stanford
University Provost Richard W.
Lyman warned last week.
"The attack on intellectual
distinction is about as severe from
'he Left as from the Right,"
Lyman said, and it is linked with
the theme that "objective thought
is an impossibility."
This, he said, "expresses a
defeatism about the human
potential so severe as to stagger
the imagination. Seldom has
glorification of instinct enjoyed a
greater popularity than today.
Linked as it is on the Left with a
sweeping and uncritical
egalitarianism, the new idolatry of
feeling over thinking is a potent
and ultimately destructive force in
the academic community."
The link-up of egalitarianism
and anti-intellectualism is nothing
new, Lyman said.
"From the Know-Nothings to

the backwoods and the
