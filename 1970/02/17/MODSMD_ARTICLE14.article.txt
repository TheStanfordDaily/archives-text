# Egeberg Speaks
## Health Care Crisis 
### 
Dr. Roger Egeberg, Assistant
Secretary of the Dept. of Health,
Education and Welfare spoke to a
moderate gathering in the Physics
tank on Thursday afternoon
about solutions to health
problems in cities. While never
offering any concrete proposals to
the dilemna, he did stress the need
for decentralization of medical
care.
Dr. Egeberg pointed out that
there are great resources available
in urban centers that lie untapped.
He mentioned that the health
crisis was directly related to the
shortage of good housing, poor
education, bad food, and

inadequate transportation.
Mirroring what could be official
policy, he offered this challenge
to the members of SWOPSI
(Student Workshops on Political
and Social Issues): "I don't know
what to say about the problem.
You're going to solve the
problems."
He proceeded to describe a
program involving many small
neighborhood clinics staffed by
trained personnel, not necessarily
MD's, that could serve poverty
areas. By allowing patients to
receive advice from these
outposts, doctors would then
have more time to devote to
cases that demand high levels of
medical skill.
Dr. Egeberg was unsure as to
where the 50,000 doctors he said
the nation needs would come
from. He earnestly explained that
the Nixon administration is trying
to obtain more money for medical
schools and students while failing
to mention that many schools
received less money last year than
under recent administrations.
Stanford's medical center received
only about one-fourth of its initial
request last year.
