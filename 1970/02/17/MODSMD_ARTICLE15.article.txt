# End Pollution
## Pitzer Calls For Unity 
### 
Efforts to environmental
pollution offer a new opportunity
to bridge the generation gap,
President Kenneth S. Pitzer of
Stanford said Monday.
But "if these programs falter
when their costs are tabulated, the
reaction among young people will
be strong," Pitzer warned in
remarks prepared for a luncheon
meeting of the Channel City Club
at the Miramar Hotel.
Environmental concerns "may
well replace Vietnam as a unifying
cause" among students, he added.
"But I hope it stays within
bounds, and it should if we mean
what we say about efforts to curb
pollution."
Calling for a "productive
partnership" among all segments
of society in seeking solutions to
these problems, Pitzer added that
"It would be a tragedy if a
combination of disaffection for
universities and desire for instant
solutions weakened this key
resource for the eventual solution
of our environmental problems.
"Private, state, and federal
funds will be allocated to the
anti-pollution effort, and an
appropriate portion should go to
those universities such as
Stanford, UC and others which
can provide both the skilled
manpower and the ideas necessary
for success."
Pitzer noted that "Some
pollution problems can be solved
by known methods if funds are
appropriated and regulations are
enacted. But there are other
problems which can only be
solved economically and
effectively through new ideas
carefully developed. Many of the
experts who, with associates,
could solve these problems are
now on the faculties of Stanford
and the University of California.
These are men skilled in ecology,
population biology, civil and
environmental engineering, as well
as other fields.
"By and large these men are
now members of university
faculties for two reasons: first,
because of their interest in and
devotion to teaching and students,
and second, because universities
provide a unique opportunity and
atmosphere where productive,
creative, innovative research can
be done.
"Universities also include these
various disciplines and hence

make possible interdisciplinary
studies—and in order to solve
many of our problems,
interdisciplinary research must be
encouraged. Equally important is
the training of young people in
these professions so that their
interest can lead to constructive
work.
"It has been our experience (at
Stanford) that most young people
welcome the chance to roll up
their sleeves to work with adults
on problems if they believe their
efforts will help bring about
results. They do not want to be
the boss, but they do not want
merely to sweep out the office,
either. They want to make a
contribution. We must make it
possible for them to do so."
Stanford students have initiated

about 20 workshops on social and
political issues (SWOPSI) dealing
with such environmental problems
as logging policy, air pollution,
and urban development. Several
hundred students are currently
enrolled in the workshops, which
are taught by several distinguished
faculty members and graduate
students and carry academic
credit.
With a recent grant of nearly $2
million from the Ford
Foundation, the University also is
developing a broad,
inter-disciplinary program on
human biology. It is regarded as
an important "first step" in
developing a new intellectual
discipline concerned with
problems of human adaptation to
the environment.

hundred students are currently
enrolled in the workshops, which
are taught by several distinguished
faculty members and graduate
students and carry academic
credit.
With a recent grant of nearly $2
million from the Ford
Foundation, the University also is
developing a broad,
inter-disciplinary program on
human biology. It is regarded as
an important "first step" in
developing a new intellectual
discipline concerned with
problems of human adaptation to
the environment.
Efforts to environmental
pollution offer a new opportunity
to bridge the generation gap,
President Kenneth S. Pitzer of
Stanford said Monday.
But "if these programs falter
when their costs are tabulated, the
reaction among young people will
be strong," Pitzer warned in
remarks prepared for a luncheon
meeting of the Channel City Club
at the Miramar Hotel.
Environmental concerns "may
well replace Vietnam as a unifying
cause" among students, he added.
"But I hope it stays within
bounds, and it should if we mean
what we say about efforts to curb
pollution."
Calling for a "productive
partnership" among all segments
of society in seeking solutions to
these problems, Pitzer added that
"It would be a tragedy if a
combination of disaffection for
universities and desire for instant
solutions weakened this key
resource for the eventual solution
of our environmental problems.
"Private, state, and federal
funds will be allocated to the
anti-pollution effort, and an
appropriate portion should go to
those universities such as
Stanford, UC and others which
can provide both the skilled
manpower and the ideas necessary
for success."
Pitzer noted that "Some
pollution problems can be solved
by known methods if funds are
appropriated and regulations are
enacted. But there are other
problems which can only be
solved economically and
effectively through new ideas
carefully developed. Many of the
experts who, with associates,
could solve these problems are
now on the faculties of Stanford
and the University of California.
These are men skilled in ecology,
population biology, civil and
environmental engineering, as well
as other fields.
"By and large these men are
now members of university
faculties for two reasons: first,
because of their interest in and
devotion to teaching and students,
and second, because universities
provide a unique opportunity and
atmosphere where productive,
creative, innovative research can
be done.
"Universities also include these
various disciplines and hence

make possible interdisciplinary
studies—and in order to solve
many of our problems,
interdisciplinary research must be
encouraged. Equally important is
the training of young people in
these professions so that their
interest can lead to constructive
work.
"It has been our experience (at
Stanford) that most young people
welcome the chance to roll up
their sleeves to work with adults
on problems if they believe their
efforts will help bring about
results. They do not want to be
the boss, but they do not want
merely to sweep out the office,
either. They want to make a
contribution. We must make it
possible for them to do so."
Stanford students have initiated

about 20 workshops on social and
political issues (SWOPSI) dealing
with such environmental problems
as logging policy, air pollution,
and urban development. Several
hundred students are currently
enrolled in the workshops, which
are taught by several distinguished
faculty members and graduate
students and carry academic
