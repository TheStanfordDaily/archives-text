# Moratorium Draws Large Crowd
## 
### 
Over 250 people attended a
February Moratorium Day
meeting last Saturday morning at
the First Congregational Church
of Palo Alto. Professor John W.
Lewis, Professor of Political
Science, and Special Services
Counselor Alan Strain were the
main speakers to an audience of
mostly middle-aged and older
people.
The meeting, a local part of the
intentional "low key" actions of
the National Moratorium
Committee during the first
months of 1970 had a
"shockingly large" turnout
according to moderator Sanford
Dornbusch, professor of
sociology. Dornbush added that
the middle-aged audience was not
surprising partly because of the
difficulty of attracting students to
Saturday meetings.
Lewis spoke on "What can be
expected in the future in
Vietnam" and was followed by
Alan Strain arguing for repeal of
the draft.
Lewis said that North Vietnam
has recently been increasing
campaigns to prepare its people
for further long-term struggles. He
blamed the failure of attempts to
achieve a political settlement since
Ho Chi Minh's death on South

Vietnam president Thieu's fears of
losing his post. "If we want a
political settlement," Lewis
stressed, "We have to push for a
political settlement."
The poli-sci professor pointed
out that new U.S. policy
orientation is reflected in Nixon's
term of "Vietnamization,"
because the term disregards China
and the "Domino theory," which
were major causes of original U.S.
involvement in Vietnam.
Lewis said that Nixon hopes to
avoid a future blood bath through
the process of Vietnamization,
but emphasized that if the U.S.
keeps arming the South
Vietnamese and then eventually
pulls out of the country saying
they have accomplished their
policy of Vietnamization there
may follow a blood bath far worse
than anything that was feared.
After Lewis answered audience
questions, Strain presented a case
for outright repeal of the draft.
He said that repeal is not a
panacea but indicated that in such
a bureacratically and legally
complex system as the Selective
Service repeal would be better
than attempts at reform.
Giving an historical perspective
of conscription Strain pointed out
that many of the first colonists
who came to the U.S. were
escaping military conscription in
their own countries. Even though
a small conscription existed
during the Civil War in the U.S.
Strain said that Union troops had
to be called back from combat at
one point to quell anti-draft riots
in New York City.
In stressing the urgency for
repeal Strain spoke about
increasing dissent and draft
evasion and about the
psychological effects of the draf l
on young men today. He said that
some of the students he has
counselled are "paralyzed in terms
of studies and plans for the
future."
Strain ended his talk by
pointing out the possibilities of
draft repeal today. He mentioned
that Robert Taft was a strong
supporter of draft repeal over two
decades ago and that a tradition
of draft repeal support has always
existed in Republican policies
including Nixon's campaign hopes
of developing a volunteer army.
Under increasing pressure for
change Strain argued that outright
repeal was the best way to
improve the system.
Afternoon activities of the
Moratorium Day were directed
toward organizing activities for
Moratorium Days in the upcoming
months.

He said that repeal is not a
panacea but indicated that in such
a bureacratically and legally
complex system as the Selective
Service repeal would be better
than attempts at reform.
Giving an historical perspective
of conscription Strain pointed out
that many of the first colonists
who came to the U.S. were
escaping military conscription in
their own countries. Even though
a small conscription existed
during the Civil War in the U.S.
Strain said that Union troops had
to be called back from combat at
one point to quell anti-draft riots
in New York City.
In stressing the urgency for
repeal Strain spoke about
increasing dissent and draft
evasion and about the
psychological effects of the draf l
on young men today. He said that
some of the students he has
counselled are "paralyzed in terms
of studies and plans for the
future."
Strain ended his talk by
pointing out the possibilities of
draft repeal today. He mentioned
that Robert Taft was a strong
supporter of draft repeal over two
decades ago and that a tradition
of draft repeal support has always
existed in Republican policies
including Nixon's campaign hopes
of developing a volunteer army.
Under increasing pressure for
change Strain argued that outright
repeal was the best way to
improve the system.
Afternoon activities of the
Moratorium Day were directed
toward organizing activities for
Moratorium Days in the upcoming
months.
Over 250 people attended a
February Moratorium Day
meeting last Saturday morning at
the First Congregational Church
of Palo Alto. Professor John W.
Lewis, Professor of Political
Science, and Special Services
Counselor Alan Strain were the
main speakers to an audience of
mostly middle-aged and older
people.
The meeting, a local part of the
intentional "low key" actions of
the National Moratorium
Committee during the first
months of 1970 had a
"shockingly large" turnout
according to moderator Sanford
Dornbusch, professor of
sociology. Dornbush added that
the middle-aged audience was not
surprising partly because of the
difficulty of attracting students to
Saturday meetings.
Lewis spoke on "What can be
expected in the future in
Vietnam" and was followed by
Alan Strain arguing for repeal of
the draft.
Lewis said that North Vietnam
has recently been increasing
campaigns to prepare its people
for further long-term struggles. He
blamed the failure of attempts to
achieve a political settlement since
Ho Chi Minh's death on South

Vietnam president Thieu's fears of
losing his post. "If we want a
political settlement," Lewis
stressed, "We have to push for a
political settlement."
The poli-sci professor pointed
out that new U.S. policy
orientation is reflected in Nixon's
term of "Vietnamization,"
because the term disregards China
and the "Domino theory," which
were major causes of original U.S.
involvement in Vietnam.
Lewis said that Nixon hopes to
avoid a future blood bath through
the process of Vietnamization,
but emphasized that if the U.S.
keeps arming the South
Vietnamese and then eventually
pulls out of the country saying
they have accomplished their
policy of Vietnamization there
may follow a blood bath far worse
than anything that was feared.
After Lewis answered audience
questions, Strain presented a case
for outright repeal of the draft.

panacea but indicated that in such
