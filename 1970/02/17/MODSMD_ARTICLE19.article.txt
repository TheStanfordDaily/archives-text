"Our Changing View of the World," with
particular attention to the enormous influence of
Isaac Newton and other scientists in changing it,
will be the subject of the fourth lecture in the
current series on "Physics and Man" to be given at
8 p.m. tonight in the Physics Lecture Hall by Prof.
Walter A. Harrison.
An expert on the quantum theory of metals,
Prof. Harrison is a member of the Applied Physics
Department at Stanford.
The Stanford physicist will discuss the
revolution in human thinking caused by
Newtonian physics, which freed man from
superstition and mysticism by explaining natural
phenomena in terms of human reason. Later
developments which revised Newtonian physics,
however, were much less influential, he believes.
