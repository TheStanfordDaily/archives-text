# Dorm Costs Force Cutback In Services
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
A deficit of approximately
$200,000 is expected next year in
the University residence budget in
spite of planned elimination of
maid and telephone services in
dorms and a $70 increase in
annual basic room and board
rates.
Complete recommendations on
residence changes proposed by a
student-staff housing committee is
expected to be published
Thursday, but members feel that
even further budget measures will
be needed.
John Grube, Lorrie Apt and
Mike Boyle, three of six student
members on the committee,
indicated that a second increase
coupled with additional
eliminations of services probably
would be implemented in two
years in order to help balance the
budget of the residential program.
Ed Scoles, Assistant Business
Manager of University Housing,
stated that he did not foresee
other cutbacks in services, but he
said that he does expect an
increase of slightly more than 6%
in the basic room and board rate
two years from now.
Trimming 01 Deficit
The twelve member residence
study committee was formed at
the beginning of Fall Quarter.
Faced with the necessity of
trimming the residential program's
deficit, the task force was to
decide whether the University
should eliminate services or enact
an even greater increase in room
and board rates. The task force
planned a survey for January to
determine student opinion on the
question.
During quarter break it was
learned that the financial aid
program of the University could
not absorb more than a six
percent increase in room and
board rates. Robert P. Huff,
Director of Financial Aids,
observed that any increase in
residence rates would necessitate
increases in the financial aid
granted to nearly every student.

"Money is tight all across the
University," said Huff. "In recent
years," he added, "we have been
moving toward financial aid
packages which include loans and
jobs as well as gifts. This trend
will now be accelerated."
He said that more funds are
needed in order to recruit
minority students who usually
have the greatest need of financial
aid.
Telephone Phase Oul
Committee members stated
that they had little choice but to
recommend cutting of maid and
telephone services. "In my
opinion they were the obvious
choices for the cutbacks,"
commented Grube.
Mike Boyle said that the huge
savings that the cutbacks produce
most influenced his decision. He
said that the present phone
system would cost $132,000 next
year were it to continue. In
contrast, if individual students
have phones installed in every
room that does not now have one,
the total cost will be only
$80,000.
"I think we made the right
decisions," Boyle concluded.
"Eliminating maid and telephone
services will save significant
amounts of money. I don't feel
students will miss the maid
service, and I believe phone
service will actually improve."
Scoles said that the
eliminations of services are
expected to cut expenses by
about $250,000.
Other courses of action
considered by the committee
included eliminating sit-down
dinners, charging premiums for
single rooms, decreasing the level
of outside maintenance and doing
away with unlimited entrees at
meals. The task force decided that
the first three alternate proposals
would not have saved a great deal
of money. Unlimited entrees, a
policy implemented only this
year, was thought too important
to the students to be cut.
Fi'fect Considered
Dean of Admissions, Fred A.
Hargadon, was consulted by the
task force to see if the rise in basic
room and board rates coupled
with increased tuition might
affect admissions.
Hargadon said that the effect
was difficult to predict. Stanford
competes for students with
colleges of similar stature, and
these institutions are also raising
tuition and room and board rater..
"The greatest impact will be
over a long period of time as these
increases mount up," said
Hargadon. "College education is
becoming terribly expensive. More
and more students will eventually
begin asking themselves whether
the advantages of attending a
private, rather than a state
institution are worth the
additional cost.
