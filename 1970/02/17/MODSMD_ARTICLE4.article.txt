# Overseas Campus Controversy
## Walker Responds To Critics 
### JULIE FLEECE 
"I think the thing that
bothered me the most about it
was the indifference of those who
were doing the writing to rather
easily, available facts." This was
how Robert A. Walker, Director
of Overseas Campuses, expressed
his feelings on a page devoted to
commentary on overseas
campuses in the January 30 Daily.
Walker was in Europe when the
articles appeared and returned last
week. During an interview
Thursday he commented, "I guess
my main reaction is sort of
disappointment in the kind of

presentation we got." The two
charges in the articles which upset
Walker the most were that the
administration of the program has
proved inflexible and that the
faculty appointments to overseas
campuses are purely personal.
Regarding the first complaint,
Walker says, "This charge of
inflexibility I think is simply
wrong. We've made a great many
changes—in fact, it's a constantly
changing academic program."
To prove his belief that he and
the rest of the Overseas Campuses
Office are not indifferent to
student views, Dr. Walker cites six
formal requests they have received
from students and the action
taken upon them.
6 Formal Petitions
Walker indicates, the six
requests were the only ones that
"could in any way be called
formal petitions to this office."
The plan offered by Britain VII
for a new organization with a
subcommittee for each campus
under a central committee, later
called the "Brooks Plan" and
adopted in place of the SES
recommendation of five separate
campus committees, was not
among the six because it was
offered directly to the Academic
Senate and not to the Overseas
Campuses Office.
The first of the six student
recommendations, the so-called
Martindale report, was formulated
by an ad hoc student board on
overseas campuses in May of
1966. Dr. Walker says that this
report became "almost the sole
agenda" of the campus directors'
conference in November of 1966
in Rome.
At that conference, the
directors of all the European
campuses took up each of the
report's recommendations and
acted favorably on most of the
items, said Walker. Walker then
brought the conference
recommendations back here to a
Faculty-Student committee which
approved them.
Best Student Report
The Martindale report resulted
in an expansion of local-interest
courses at each of the campuses
and the abolition of open house
rules, and Walker terms it"the
best student report we've ever
had." Walker cites the report as
one instance in which the
administration not only took
student recommendations
seriously, but also obtained
additional funds from the
University to implement the
changes.
Two more student petitions,

concerning rules at the overseas
campuses, were received last
spring and summer from Germany
XXII and Austria VIII and were
taken to last year's directors'
conference in Vienna. Again,
Walker says, almost all the rules
were changed

In this conference, the directors
dropped the rules of enforced
attendance at the campus and
transferred the necessity of class
attendance to individual decisions
based on academic requirements.
Walker emphasizes that, as before,
the new rules grew out of the
student recommendations and in
many cases used exactly the same
language.
Eood Petition
The only formal petition the
office has received concerning
inadequate food was sent by
Austria V, the first group in
Vienna after the campus was
moved from the Semmering.
Walker explains the situation was
because the owners of the
building, Caritas, had never been
in the food service business and
had a lot to learn, especially about
American tastes. In this instance,
the cook was dismissed and the
present cook seems to be doing
"reasonably well" according tp
Walker.
In response to the many
spoken, if not written, complaints
about food. Walker explains that
the exact amount paid for board
does not necessarily go entirely to
food costs. "There is no
breakdown between the cost for
physical facilities and the cost for
food," he says.
Each campus is instead allotted

a fixed amount per student per
day and divides it as it sees fit. In
the Vienna instance, where the
cook allegedly got only 32c per
student per day for food, the
home office obtained an
increased allocation for food.
Cuisine Francaise
Walker said that the food at the
French campus had at first been a
serious problem since the food
was exactly the same as the
French students eat at the
Restaurant Universitaire for less
money. Walker indicated that,
although it has been improved,
further improvement is unlikely
since the French government not
only provides the cuisine and
facilities but gives a subsidy to the
French campus in addition.
According to Dr. Walker, the
administration "can't just get
their accounts and ask how much
they pay for meat."
Food is "not a point of great
concern" at the overseas
campuses, says Walker.
The fifth student petition
mentioned by Dr. Walker was one
from Austria VIII which, he says,
was based on the misinformation
that the Austrian campus contract
was up for renewal. In response to
this, the home office sent an
explanation that the contract is
automatically renewed each year
unless one of the parties
terminates it a year in advance. In
any case, Walker explains it would
be impossible to get such a large
firm to adopt the provision
requested by the Austria
petition—that there be a clause
allowing the home office to give
six month's notice before
termination of the contract.
Language Pass-Fail?
The sixth petition was one
received Autumn quarter from
Germany XXIII asking that
German language courses be given
on a pass-fail basis. After
discussion of the request at the
home campus, a decision was
made that the courses were
regarded by the University the
same as major requirements,
which must be taken for a grade.
Walker stresses that this decision
was not made by him, but by the
Subcommittee on Overseas
Campuses of the General Studies
Committee.
The petitions, Walker says,
show how the Overseas Campuses
Office puts each student request
on the agenda and considers it.
"The point is that these petitions
did get attention, they did get
change. The allegation that we're
indifferent to them is false,"
concludes Walker.
