# Garry Attacks Hoffman

### RICHARD EMBRY 
Earlier a crowd of about 800
heard Black Panther Attorney
Charles Garry attack Judge Julius
Hoffman last night in Memorial
Auditorium at the Huey P.
Newton Birthday Rally.
Garry focused his speech on the
U.S. judicial system, charging that
"fascism has moved into the
courtroom." The Panther lawyer
described Judge Julius Hoffman as
"a little man with a big head and
pee wee mind."
Attorney Garry also attacked
Supreme Court judge nominee
Harold Cars well as a "blatant,
outright racist." "Sixty million
people are finding the law
completely irrelevant," Garry
said, "We live in an atmosphere
where justice is commensurate
with the needs of Standard Oil
and General Motors."
Praising Rlack Panther leaders
for their dedication and citing the
contribution of Newton to
Garry's own life, Garry concluded
to a standing ovation "Free Huey;
free Bobby; free Eldridge. Free

the Chicago 7 and 2 (defense
attorneys Kunstler and Weinglass)
and the Chicago 10's and 20's and
30's."
Keynote speaker of the evening
was Masai Hewitt, who credited
Huey Newton with "putting a
machine together that still runs"
(the Black Panther Party).
Addressing his audience calmly,
Hewitt refuted the worth of
non-violence in the black struggle.
"We have been the most
non-violent people in the world.
We pray in five different
languages, and it's gotten us

nowhere. We've marched enough
to march around the world, and
it's gotten us nowhere. And then
America says 'Violence will get
you nowhere!' America
perpetrates violence all over the
world . . . and then has the nerve
to tell us 'Violence is wrong.'
"America wants quiet, but not
peace. We've learned that if we
want peace, we have to fight for
it."
Hewitt ended by leading the
audience in a roaring "Happy
Birthday, Huey."
