# Windows Smashed In March To Palo Alto
## 
### 
Marchers in a torchlight parade
broke windows late last night in
banks and other buildings on El
Camino just south of the Stanford
campus and in Hoover Library.
The march, billed in advance as
a protest against the contempt
sentencing in the Chicago 7
conspiracy trial, involved 350 to
500 people at its greatest point.
By the time the crowd moved
back to campus, it numbered
about 150.
At least 20 windows were
shattered by rocks. Dean Witter
Co., a stock brokerage, was first
hit. Next, Wells Fargo Bank was
pelted and then the Bank of
America building, which houses
the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. Several protesters
shouted, "Get the third floor,"
the location of the FBI.
The demonstrators attempted

to surround the Bank of America
building, located near California
and El Camino streets, but turned
back toward campus as two police
cars approached from the rear of
the building with lights flashing.
One Arrest
One person, Kenneth Paul
Garner, was arrested by Palo Alto
police at the Bank of America. He
was released early this morning.
Charges will be discussed with the
District Attorney today,
according to a police spokesman.
Garner was tentatively
identified as an ex-employee of
the Stanford University Press who
was recently laid off.
Windows were broken in
savings and loan associations and
the Stanford Ski shop, located on
the route back to campus. At least
three windows in new Hoover
Library were also smashed after
the dwindling crowd returned to
Stanford.
Protesters originally left
Memorial Auditorium shortly
after 11 p.m., following a Huey P.
Newton Birthday rally. Lead by
torches and accompanied by
drums, they walked south on
Serra Street.
Marching several abreast in the
street, they turned left on Galvez,
and south on El Camino. The
protesters filled the southbound
lanes, then abruptly switched to
the northbound lanes. As they
neared Bank of America they
filled both sides of the street.
When rock throwing began along
the route, groups of
demonstrators split from the main
group. At the Bank of America,
the crowd divided into two
groups, separated by El Camino.
About 30 cars backed up
behind the march, and Palo Alto
Police diverted traffic in its path.
Individuals began to hurl rocks
and bricks.
Armed With Night-Sticks
One person thrust a smoldering
torch near the window of a
building on El Camino, but no fire
resulted.

The marchers returned to
campus walking in the street. At
least two Palo Alto police cars
trailed the procession.
As the marchers reached the
corner of Stanford Avenue and El
Camino three more police cars
arrived, criss-crossing through the
scrambling crowd. At least four
officers then jumped out of the
cars, their night-sticks in their
hands. The bewildered crowd
began to split up in confusion, but
then reformed.
After the crowd turned west on
Stanford Avenue at the edge of
the campus, five Palo Alto
policemen, dressed in helmets and
carrying night sticks, walked in a
line along the south edge of the
crowd.
Palo Alto police cars appeared
behind and ahead of the crowd as
Stanford police cars cruised on
another street north of Stanford
Avenue.
When asked if the police would
try to block the ciowd, one
officer replied, "No, just as long
as they go back to Stanford."
Marching up Escondido Road,
the demonstrators passed Wilbur
Hall at about 12:30 a.m. The
demonstrators then proceeded to
the Hoover Library located at the
base of Hoover Tower where more
windows were shattereed. The
group dispersed by 1 a.m.
About 25 Palo Alto police were
standing by during the latter
stages of the activities.
During the march,
demonstrators shouted a variety
of slogans, including "Free Huey,
Smash the State," "Free the
Conspiracy 7," "The Streets Are
For the People," and "Off the
Pigs."
At least one rock was hurled at
a police car on El Camino and the
appearance of police drew jeers
from the crowd at several points.
While marching along Stanford
Avenue, one officer joined the
crowd in chanting, "Today's pig is
tomorrow's bacon."

Marchers in a torchlight parade
broke windows late last night in
banks and other buildings on El
Camino just south of the Stanford
campus and in Hoover Library.
The march, billed in advance as
a protest against the contempt
sentencing in the Chicago 7
conspiracy trial, involved 350 to
500 people at its greatest point.
By the time the crowd moved
back to campus, it numbered
about 150.
At least 20 windows were
shattered by rocks. Dean Witter
Co., a stock brokerage, was first
hit. Next, Wells Fargo Bank was
pelted and then the Bank of
America building, which houses
the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. Several protesters
shouted, "Get the third floor,"
the location of the FBI.
The demonstrators attempted

to surround the Bank of America
building, located near California
and El Camino streets, but turned
back toward campus as two police
cars approached from the rear of
the building with lights flashing.
One Arrest
One person, Kenneth Paul
Garner, was arrested by Palo Alto
police at the Bank of America. He
was released early this morning.
Charges will be discussed with the
District Attorney today,
according to a police spokesman.
Garner was tentatively
identified as an ex-employee of
the Stanford University Press who
was recently laid off.
Windows were broken in
savings and loan associations and
the Stanford Ski shop, located on
the route back to campus. At least
three windows in new Hoover
Library were also smashed after
the dwindling crowd returned to
Stanford.
Protesters originally left
Memorial Auditorium shortly
after 11 p.m., following a Huey P.
Newton Birthday rally. Lead by
torches and accompanied by
drums, they walked south on
Serra Street.
Marching several abreast in the
street, they turned left on Galvez,
and south on El Camino. The
protesters filled the southbound
lanes, then abruptly switched to
the northbound lanes. As they
neared Bank of America they
filled both sides of the street.
When rock throwing began along
the route, groups of
demonstrators split from the main
group. At the Bank of America,
the crowd divided into two
groups, separated by El Camino.
About 30 cars backed up
behind the march, and Palo Alto
Police diverted traffic in its path.
Individuals began to hurl rocks
and bricks.
Armed With Night-Sticks
One person thrust a smoldering
torch near the window of a
building on El Camino, but no fire
resulted.

The marchers returned to
campus walking in the street. At
least two Palo Alto police cars
trailed the procession.
As the marchers reached the
corner of Stanford Avenue and El
Camino three more police cars
arrived, criss-crossing through the
scrambling crowd. At least four
officers then jumped out of the
cars, their night-sticks in their
hands. The bewildered crowd
began to split up in confusion, but
then reformed.
After the crowd turned west on
Stanford Avenue at the edge of
the campus, five Palo Alto
policemen, dressed in helmets and
carrying night sticks, walked in a
line along the south edge of the
crowd.
Palo Alto police cars appeared
behind and ahead of the crowd as
Stanford police cars cruised on
another street north of Stanford
Avenue.
When asked if the police would
try to block the ciowd, one
officer replied, "No, just as long
as they go back to Stanford."
Marching up Escondido Road,
the demonstrators passed Wilbur
Hall at about 12:30 a.m. The
demonstrators then proceeded to
the Hoover Library located at the
base of Hoover Tower where more
windows were shattereed. The
group dispersed by 1 a.m.
About 25 Palo Alto police were
standing by during the latter
stages of the activities.
During the march,
demonstrators shouted a variety
of slogans, including "Free Huey,
Smash the State," "Free the
Conspiracy 7," "The Streets Are
For the People," and "Off the
Pigs."
At least one rock was hurled at
a police car on El Camino and the
appearance of police drew jeers
from the crowd at several points.
While marching along Stanford
Avenue, one officer joined the
crowd in chanting, "Today's pig is
tomorrow's bacon."
