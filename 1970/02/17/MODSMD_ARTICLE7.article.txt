# 'New' SDS Chapter Formed From Split
## 
### RICHARD EMBRY 
The expulsion of a small group
of Worker-Student Alliance
(WSA) members from an SDS
meeting two weeks ago marked
the surfacing at Stanford of
antagonistic factions within the
student radical movement.
Since that time ousted WSA
members have formed a "new"
SDS chapter. The last meeting of
the "old" Stanford SDS was held
off campus to insure that WSA
members could not attend.
Internal strife within the
national organization culminated
at last June's SDS National
Convention, when a unified
Revolutionary Youth Movement
(RYM) faction walked out
claiming that it had expelled the
Progressive Labor Party (PLP or
PL) and the WSA caucus from the
SDS. Further splitting occurred
after the walk-out. The unified
RYM faction broke down into
two groups, Weatherman and
RYM 11. Another groii,
composed largely of WSA
members, established itself as the
National SDS and set up
headquarters in Boston.
Locally, the Stanford SDS,
though officially independent of
any national organization, voted
this summer to exclude PL-WSA
members from their ranks. At the
time though there were no WSA
members at Stanford.
In a letter published to the
Daily earlier this month CDS members
Janet Weiss, Mark Weiss, John
Keilch, and Bob Hagen explained
the reasoning behind the WSA
expulsion.
"Coii 11 ter-Revolutionary
"The reason for the expulsion
is that PL-WSA is objectively
counter-revolutionary. They
viciously slander the Black
Panther Party, call Ho Chi Minh a
'puppet' and a 'traitor,' and a part
of 'the Hanoi-Washington-Moscow
axis;' and refuse to support North
Vietnam, the NLF. ..."
"Locally, they are
bad-mouthing the April Third
Movement, opposing an
anti-imperialist line in the
anti-ROTC movement, and
refusing to participate in the New
Moratorium. When Stanford SDS
expelled them they refused to
leave the meeting and hung
around for two hours trying to
provoke a fight by their noisy
disruption preventing any work
from being done at that meeting."
"K.lilist Atmosphere"
"We felt that an elitist
atmosphere had developed at SDS
meetings which prevented new
people from contributing," Hagan
wrote.
Concerning the SDS charge tnat
WSA and PLP had denounced the

Ho Chi Minh and Black Panther
leadership, a WSA member stated
"This was a distortion, but not a
lie."
The PL-WSA stand on the
Panthers, Ho Chi Minh, and the
National Liberation Front is based
on PLP's position that "all
nationalism is reactionary." This
position was a major factor in the
polarizing radical camps which
resulted in the walk-out at the
SDS National Convention.
A Class Outlook
Ivo Banac, a WSA member at
Stanford and a candidate member
of PL, explained the PL stand on
nationalism. "We look on
nationalism as a class outlook of
the bourgeoise. All aspects of
bourgeoise ideas are reactionary.
Nationalist struggles have been
turned around to serve capitalist
interests. The revolutionary
struggle can only be led by
workers."

Analysis

PL-WSA spokesmen claim to
support members of the Black
Panther Party and the people of
North Vietnam, but openly
criticize Panther and North
Vietnamese leaders.
Opposing radical groups, such
as RYM II and Weatherman on
the national level, and Stanford
SDS and the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union locally hold
that nationalism can be either
revolutionary or reactionary. The
Panthers, for example, are
"revolutionary nationalists,"
whereas Ron Karenga's US,
cultural nationalists, are
reactionary, they claim
Metter Disciplined
The Progressive Labor Party is a
more disciplined group than most
other radical factions, with
admission an extremely lengthy
process. Although many members
are students, PL is not a campus
oriented organization.
Nationally, the Worker-Student
Alliance Caucus is probably the
largest organized student radical
block. (Most radical organizations,
like the Stanford SDS are not
affiliated with any national
group.) Opponents of PL-WSA
consider WSA to be PL's "arm on
campus." WSA members, while
admitting that the two groups are
closely associated, insist that PL
has no direct control over WSA,
though many WSA members, are
either PL members or supporters.
The basic thrust of the WSA
movement is the "campus worker
alliance struggle." Hogan
elaborated in his article.
