# 'New' SDS Chapter Formed From Split
## 
### RICHARD EMBRY 
The expulsion of a small group
of Worker-Student Alliance
(WSA) members from an SDS
meeting two weeks ago marked
the surfacing at Stanford of
antagonistic factions within the
student radical movement.
Since that time ousted WSA
members have formed a "new"
SDS chapter. The last meeting of
the "old" Stanford SDS was held
off campus to insure that WSA
members could not attend.
Internal strife within the
national organization culminated
at last June's SDS National
Convention, when a unified
Revolutionary Youth Movement
(RYM) faction walked out
claiming that it had expelled the
Progressive Labor Party (PLP or
PL) and the WSA caucus from the
SDS. Further splitting occurred
after the walk-out. The unified
RYM faction broke down into
two groups, Weatherman and
RYM 11. Another groii,
composed largely of WSA
members, established itself as the
National SDS and set up
headquarters in Boston.
Locally, the Stanford SDS,
though officially independent of
any national organization, voted
this summer to exclude PL-WSA
members from their ranks. At the
time though there were no WSA
members at Stanford.
In a letter published to the
Daily earlier this month CDS members
Janet Weiss, Mark Weiss, John
Keilch, and Bob Hagen explained
the reasoning behind the WSA
expulsion.
"Coii 11 ter-Revolutionary
"The reason for the expulsion
is that PL-WSA is objectively
counter-revolutionary. They
viciously slander the Black
Panther Party, call Ho Chi Minh a
'puppet' and a 'traitor,' and a part
of 'the Hanoi-Washington-Moscow
axis;' and refuse to support North
Vietnam, the NLF. ..."
"Locally, they are
bad-mouthing the April Third
Movement, opposing an
anti-imperialist line in the
anti-ROTC movement, and
refusing to participate in the New
Moratorium. When Stanford SDS
expelled them they refused to
leave the meeting and hung
around for two hours trying to
provoke a fight by their noisy
disruption preventing any work
from being done at that meeting."
"K.lilist Atmosphere"
"We felt that an elitist
atmosphere had developed at SDS
meetings which prevented new
people from contributing," Hagan
wrote.
Concerning the SDS charge tnat
WSA and PLP had denounced the

Ho Chi Minh and Black Panther
leadership, a WSA member stated
"This was a distortion, but not a
lie."
The PL-WSA stand on the
Panthers, Ho Chi Minh, and the
National Liberation Front is based
on PLP's position that "all
nationalism is reactionary." This
position was a major factor in the
polarizing radical camps which
resulted in the walk-out at the
SDS National Convention.
A Class Outlook
Ivo Banac, a WSA member at
Stanford and a candidate member
of PL, explained the PL stand on
nationalism. "We look on
nationalism as a class outlook of
the bourgeoise. All aspects of
bourgeoise ideas are reactionary.
Nationalist struggles have been
turned around to serve capitalist
interests. The revolutionary
struggle can only be led by
workers."

Analysis

PL-WSA spokesmen claim to
support members of the Black
Panther Party and the people of
North Vietnam, but openly
criticize Panther and North
Vietnamese leaders.
Opposing radical groups, such
as RYM II and Weatherman on
the national level, and Stanford
SDS and the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union locally hold
that nationalism can be either
revolutionary or reactionary. The
Panthers, for example, are
"revolutionary nationalists,"
whereas Ron Karenga's US,
cultural nationalists, are
reactionary, they claim
Metter Disciplined
The Progressive Labor Party is a
more disciplined group than most
other radical factions, with
admission an extremely lengthy
process. Although many members
are students, PL is not a campus
oriented organization.
Nationally, the Worker-Student
Alliance Caucus is probably the
largest organized student radical
block. (Most radical organizations,
like the Stanford SDS are not
affiliated with any national
group.) Opponents of PL-WSA
consider WSA to be PL's "arm on
campus." WSA members, while
admitting that the two groups are
closely associated, insist that PL
has no direct control over WSA,
though many WSA members, are
either PL members or supporters.
The basic thrust of the WSA
movement is the "campus worker
alliance struggle." Hogan
elaborated in his article.
"A student movement has no
long term chance of succeeding
unless it allies itself with the
working class through lasting
friendships and close political ties
with campus workers, because we
have the opportunity *o get part
time jobs (which the
administration has set aside for
students) and work with these
people. These ties can form the
basis of a struggle over specific
injustices against campus workers
in which workers must take the
lead."
Members of Stanford SDS
argue that every job taken by a
student means one less job for a
worker and frequently accuse
WSAers of employing "scab
tactics."
Broadening Base
Standford SDS backs the
Stu dent-Worker Solidarity
Committee, which Bruce Franklin
recently termed "the only
functional (radical) group at
Stanford." A vote at the SDS
meeting two weeks ago extended
SDS membership to the
committee which consists of
students and representatives of
the United Stanford Employees.
According to Banac the "new"
WSA-SDS chapter is open to
"anyone interested in fighting
imperialism and racism,"
including members of RU and the
Stanford SDS.
"We would most certainly like
to see the two factions re-united.
A number of serious issues face
the Stanford student movement.
We welcome people in RU and
others to put forth their lines. It is
very necessary to have a struggle
of ideas."
Despite WSA's open invitation
the "old" SDS apparently is not
as receptive.
"This (WSA) is not a
revolutionary, anti-imperialist, or
even left group, and Stanford SDS
utterly repudiates it," read the
SDS letter to the Daily.
The WSA group at Stanford is
attempting to form a new SDS
affiliated with the National SDS
in Boston, an organization which
Franklin and others have tagged as
"a PL front."
On the national level the two
factions evolving from the unified

RYM group which walked out of
the SDS National Convention this
summer have not been faring
exceptionally well.
A Vanguard Kole
Weatherman, formerly RYM 11,
sees the revolution as very close at
hand and has placed itself in the
"vanguard" role. Weatherman
tactics are largely anarchistic.
Charles Manson, allegedly behind
the Tate case murders, is upheld
by Weatherman as a hero of the
people for directing attacks
against the wealthy element in
America.
Weatherman has lost much of
the strength it showed this
summer and as a national
organization is almost defunct.
Only fifty members attended the
Weatherman National Convention
in Cincinnati last December.
Newsweek magazine (Feb. 16th)
reports that Weatherman "plans
to direct major recruitment
efforts at urban high school
students."
Of the national groups
opposing PL, RYM II is the
largest, though still loosely
organized. RYM II strategy is
their "United Front Against
Imperialism" which stresses tying
the struggles of white workers to
those of American blacks and the
Vietnamese. The cause of
Women's Liberation and an end to
make chauvinism has been picked
up by RYM 11, as it has by nearly
all other radical factions.
RYM II theory is popular with
the "old" Stanford SDS, but there
is also a strong influence from the
Revolutionary Union (formerly
Peninsula Red Guards). Stanford
Prof. Bruce Franklin, an RU
organizer, describes RU as an
alliance of "Marxist-Leninist
collectives."

Since that time ousted WSA
members have formed a "new"
SDS chapter. The last meeting of
the "old" Stanford SDS was held
off campus to insure that WSA
members could not attend.
Internal strife within the
national organization culminated
at last June's SDS National
Convention, when a unified
Revolutionary Youth Movement
(RYM) faction walked out
claiming that it had expelled the
Progressive Labor Party (PLP or
PL) and the WSA caucus from the
SDS. Further splitting occurred
after the walk-out. The unified
RYM faction broke down into
two groups, Weatherman and
RYM 11. Another groii,
composed largely of WSA
members, established itself as the
National SDS and set up
headquarters in Boston.
Locally, the Stanford SDS,
though officially independent of
any national organization, voted
this summer to exclude PL-WSA
members from their ranks. At the
time though there were no WSA
members at Stanford.
In a letter published to the
Daily earlier this month CDS members
Janet Weiss, Mark Weiss, John
Keilch, and Bob Hagen explained
the reasoning behind the WSA
expulsion.
"Coii 11 ter-Revolutionary
"The reason for the expulsion
is that PL-WSA is objectively
counter-revolutionary. They
viciously slander the Black
Panther Party, call Ho Chi Minh a
'puppet' and a 'traitor,' and a part
of 'the Hanoi-Washington-Moscow
axis;' and refuse to support North
Vietnam, the NLF. ..."
"Locally, they are
bad-mouthing the April Third
Movement, opposing an
anti-imperialist line in the
anti-ROTC movement, and
refusing to participate in the New
Moratorium. When Stanford SDS
expelled them they refused to
leave the meeting and hung
around for two hours trying to
provoke a fight by their noisy
disruption preventing any work
from being done at that meeting."
"K.lilist Atmosphere"
"We felt that an elitist
atmosphere had developed at SDS
meetings which prevented new
people from contributing," Hagan
wrote.
Concerning the SDS charge tnat
WSA and PLP had denounced the

Ho Chi Minh and Black Panther
leadership, a WSA member stated
"This was a distortion, but not a
lie."
The PL-WSA stand on the
Panthers, Ho Chi Minh, and the
National Liberation Front is based
on PLP's position that "all
nationalism is reactionary." This
position was a major factor in the
polarizing radical camps which
resulted in the walk-out at the
SDS National Convention.
A Class Outlook
Ivo Banac, a WSA member at
Stanford and a candidate member
of PL, explained the PL stand on
nationalism. "We look on
nationalism as a class outlook of
the bourgeoise. All aspects of
bourgeoise ideas are reactionary.
Nationalist struggles have been
turned around to serve capitalist
interests. The revolutionary
struggle can only be led by
workers."

Analysis

PL-WSA spokesmen claim to
support members of the Black
Panther Party and the people of
North Vietnam, but openly
criticize Panther and North
Vietnamese leaders.
Opposing radical groups, such
as RYM II and Weatherman on
the national level, and Stanford
SDS and the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union locally hold
that nationalism can be either
revolutionary or reactionary. The
Panthers, for example, are
"revolutionary nationalists,"
whereas Ron Karenga's US,
cultural nationalists, are
reactionary, they claim
Metter Disciplined
The Progressive Labor Party is a
more disciplined group than most
other radical factions, with
admission an extremely lengthy
process. Although many members
are students, PL is not a campus
oriented organization.
Nationally, the Worker-Student
Alliance Caucus is probably the
largest organized student radical
block. (Most radical organizations,
like the Stanford SDS are not
affiliated with any national
group.) Opponents of PL-WSA
consider WSA to be PL's "arm on
campus." WSA members, while
admitting that the two groups are
closely associated, insist that PL
has no direct control over WSA,
though many WSA members, are
either PL members or supporters.
The basic thrust of the WSA
movement is the "campus worker
alliance struggle." Hogan
elaborated in his article.
"A student movement has no
long term chance of succeeding
unless it allies itself with the
working class through lasting
friendships and close political ties
with campus workers, because we
have the opportunity *o get part
time jobs (which the
administration has set aside for
students) and work with these
people. These ties can form the
basis of a struggle over specific
injustices against campus workers
in which workers must take the
lead."
Members of Stanford SDS
argue that every job taken by a
student means one less job for a
worker and frequently accuse
WSAers of employing "scab
tactics."
Broadening Base
Standford SDS backs the
Stu dent-Worker Solidarity
Committee, which Bruce Franklin
recently termed "the only
functional (radical) group at
Stanford." A vote at the SDS
meeting two weeks ago extended
SDS membership to the
committee which consists of
students and representatives of
the United Stanford Employees.
According to Banac the "new"
WSA-SDS chapter is open to
"anyone interested in fighting
imperialism and racism,"
including members of RU and the
Stanford SDS.
"We would most certainly like
to see the two factions re-united.
A number of serious issues face
the Stanford student movement.
We welcome people in RU and
others to put forth their lines. It is
very necessary to have a struggle
of ideas."
Despite WSA's open invitation
the "old" SDS apparently is not
as receptive.
"This (WSA) is not a
revolutionary, anti-imperialist, or
even left group, and Stanford SDS
utterly repudiates it," read the
SDS letter to the Daily.
The WSA group at Stanford is
attempting to form a new SDS
affiliated with the National SDS
in Boston, an organization which
Franklin and others have tagged as
"a PL front."
On the national level the two
factions evolving from the unified

RYM group which walked out of
the SDS National Convention this
summer have not been faring
exceptionally well.
A Vanguard Kole
Weatherman, formerly RYM 11,
sees the revolution as very close at
hand and has placed itself in the
"vanguard" role. Weatherman
tactics are largely anarchistic.
Charles Manson, allegedly behind
the Tate case murders, is upheld
by Weatherman as a hero of the
people for directing attacks
against the wealthy element in
America.
Weatherman has lost much of
the strength it showed this
summer and as a national
organization is almost defunct.
Only fifty members attended the
Weatherman National Convention
in Cincinnati last December.
Newsweek magazine (Feb. 16th)
reports that Weatherman "plans
to direct major recruitment
efforts at urban high school
students."
Of the national groups
opposing PL, RYM II is the
largest, though still loosely
organized. RYM II strategy is
their "United Front Against
Imperialism" which stresses tying
the struggles of white workers to
those of American blacks and the
Vietnamese. The cause of
Women's Liberation and an end to
make chauvinism has been picked
up by RYM 11, as it has by nearly
all other radical factions.
RYM II theory is popular with
the "old" Stanford SDS, but there
is also a strong influence from the
Revolutionary Union (formerly
Peninsula Red Guards). Stanford
Prof. Bruce Franklin, an RU
organizer, describes RU as an
alliance of "Marxist-Leninist
collectives."

at last June's SDS National
Convention, when a unified
Revolutionary Youth Movement
(RYM) faction walked out
claiming that it had expelled the
Progressive Labor Party (PLP or
PL) and the WSA caucus from the
SDS. Further splitting occurred
after the walk-out. The unified
RYM faction broke down into
two groups, Weatherman and
RYM 11. Another groii,
composed largely of WSA
members, established itself as the
National SDS and set up
headquarters in Boston.
Locally, the Stanford SDS,
though officially independent of
any national organization, voted
this summer to exclude PL-WSA
members from their ranks. At the
time though there were no WSA
members at Stanford.
In a letter published to the
Daily earlier this month CDS members
Janet Weiss, Mark Weiss, John
Keilch, and Bob Hagen explained
the reasoning behind the WSA
expulsion.
"Coii 11 ter-Revolutionary
"The reason for the expulsion
is that PL-WSA is objectively
counter-revolutionary. They
viciously slander the Black
Panther Party, call Ho Chi Minh a
'puppet' and a 'traitor,' and a part
of 'the Hanoi-Washington-Moscow
axis;' and refuse to support North
Vietnam, the NLF. ..."
"Locally, they are
bad-mouthing the April Third
Movement, opposing an
anti-imperialist line in the
anti-ROTC movement, and
refusing to participate in the New
Moratorium. When Stanford SDS
expelled them they refused to
leave the meeting and hung
around for two hours trying to
provoke a fight by their noisy
disruption preventing any work
from being done at that meeting."
"K.lilist Atmosphere"
"We felt that an elitist
atmosphere had developed at SDS
meetings which prevented new
people from contributing," Hagan
wrote.
Concerning the SDS charge tnat
WSA and PLP had denounced the

Ho Chi Minh and Black Panther
leadership, a WSA member stated
"This was a distortion, but not a
lie."
The PL-WSA stand on the
Panthers, Ho Chi Minh, and the
National Liberation Front is based
on PLP's position that "all
nationalism is reactionary." This
position was a major factor in the
polarizing radical camps which
resulted in the walk-out at the
SDS National Convention.
A Class Outlook
Ivo Banac, a WSA member at
Stanford and a candidate member
of PL, explained the PL stand on
nationalism. "We look on
nationalism as a class outlook of
the bourgeoise. All aspects of
bourgeoise ideas are reactionary.
Nationalist struggles have been
turned around to serve capitalist
interests. The revolutionary
struggle can only be led by
workers."

Analysis

PL-WSA spokesmen claim to
support members of the Black
Panther Party and the people of
North Vietnam, but openly
criticize Panther and North
Vietnamese leaders.
Opposing radical groups, such
as RYM II and Weatherman on
the national level, and Stanford
SDS and the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union locally hold
that nationalism can be either
revolutionary or reactionary. The
Panthers, for example, are
"revolutionary nationalists,"
whereas Ron Karenga's US,
cultural nationalists, are
reactionary, they claim
Metter Disciplined
The Progressive Labor Party is a
more disciplined group than most
other radical factions, with
admission an extremely lengthy
process. Although many members
are students, PL is not a campus
oriented organization.
Nationally, the Worker-Student
Alliance Caucus is probably the
largest organized student radical
block. (Most radical organizations,
like the Stanford SDS are not
affiliated with any national
group.) Opponents of PL-WSA
consider WSA to be PL's "arm on
campus." WSA members, while
admitting that the two groups are
closely associated, insist that PL
has no direct control over WSA,
though many WSA members, are
either PL members or supporters.
The basic thrust of the WSA
movement is the "campus worker
alliance struggle." Hogan
elaborated in his article.
"A student movement has no
long term chance of succeeding
unless it allies itself with the
working class through lasting
friendships and close political ties
with campus workers, because we
have the opportunity *o get part
time jobs (which the
administration has set aside for
students) and work with these
people. These ties can form the
basis of a struggle over specific
injustices against campus workers
in which workers must take the
lead."
Members of Stanford SDS
argue that every job taken by a
student means one less job for a
worker and frequently accuse
WSAers of employing "scab
tactics."
Broadening Base
Standford SDS backs the
Stu dent-Worker Solidarity
Committee, which Bruce Franklin
recently termed "the only
functional (radical) group at
Stanford." A vote at the SDS
meeting two weeks ago extended
SDS membership to the
committee which consists of
students and representatives of
the United Stanford Employees.
According to Banac the "new"
WSA-SDS chapter is open to
"anyone interested in fighting
imperialism and racism,"
including members of RU and the
Stanford SDS.
"We would most certainly like
to see the two factions re-united.
A number of serious issues face
the Stanford student movement.
We welcome people in RU and
others to put forth their lines. It is
very necessary to have a struggle
of ideas."
Despite WSA's open invitation
the "old" SDS apparently is not
as receptive.
"This (WSA) is not a
revolutionary, anti-imperialist, or
even left group, and Stanford SDS
utterly repudiates it," read the
SDS letter to the Daily.
The WSA group at Stanford is
attempting to form a new SDS
affiliated with the National SDS
in Boston, an organization which
Franklin and others have tagged as
"a PL front."
On the national level the two
factions evolving from the unified

RYM group which walked out of
the SDS National Convention this
summer have not been faring
exceptionally well.
A Vanguard Kole
Weatherman, formerly RYM 11,
sees the revolution as very close at
hand and has placed itself in the
"vanguard" role. Weatherman
tactics are largely anarchistic.
Charles Manson, allegedly behind
the Tate case murders, is upheld
by Weatherman as a hero of the
people for directing attacks
against the wealthy element in
America.
Weatherman has lost much of
the strength it showed this
summer and as a national
organization is almost defunct.
Only fifty members attended the
Weatherman National Convention
in Cincinnati last December.
Newsweek magazine (Feb. 16th)
reports that Weatherman "plans
to direct major recruitment
efforts at urban high school
students."
Of the national groups
opposing PL, RYM II is the
largest, though still loosely
organized. RYM II strategy is
their "United Front Against
Imperialism" which stresses tying
the struggles of white workers to
those of American blacks and the
Vietnamese. The cause of
Women's Liberation and an end to
make chauvinism has been picked
up by RYM 11, as it has by nearly
all other radical factions.
RYM II theory is popular with
the "old" Stanford SDS, but there
is also a strong influence from the
Revolutionary Union (formerly
Peninsula Red Guards). Stanford
Prof. Bruce Franklin, an RU
organizer, describes RU as an
alliance of "Marxist-Leninist
collectives."

after the walk-out. The unified
RYM faction broke down into
two groups, Weatherman and
RYM 11. Another groii,
composed largely of WSA
members, established itself as the
National SDS and set up
headquarters in Boston.
Locally, the Stanford SDS,
though officially independent of
any national organization, voted
this summer to exclude PL-WSA
members from their ranks. At the
time though there were no WSA
members at Stanford.
In a letter published to the
Daily earlier this month CDS members
Janet Weiss, Mark Weiss, John
Keilch, and Bob Hagen explained
the reasoning behind the WSA
expulsion.
"Coii 11 ter-Revolutionary
"The reason for the expulsion
is that PL-WSA is objectively
counter-revolutionary. They
viciously slander the Black
Panther Party, call Ho Chi Minh a
'puppet' and a 'traitor,' and a part
of 'the Hanoi-Washington-Moscow
axis;' and refuse to support North
Vietnam, the NLF. ..."
"Locally, they are
bad-mouthing the April Third
Movement, opposing an
anti-imperialist line in the
anti-ROTC movement, and
refusing to participate in the New
Moratorium. When Stanford SDS
expelled them they refused to
leave the meeting and hung
around for two hours trying to
provoke a fight by their noisy
disruption preventing any work
from being done at that meeting."
"K.lilist Atmosphere"
"We felt that an elitist
atmosphere had developed at SDS
meetings which prevented new
people from contributing," Hagan
wrote.
Concerning the SDS charge tnat
WSA and PLP had denounced the

Ho Chi Minh and Black Panther
leadership, a WSA member stated
"This was a distortion, but not a
lie."
The PL-WSA stand on the
Panthers, Ho Chi Minh, and the
National Liberation Front is based
on PLP's position that "all
nationalism is reactionary." This
position was a major factor in the
polarizing radical camps which
resulted in the walk-out at the
SDS National Convention.
A Class Outlook
Ivo Banac, a WSA member at
Stanford and a candidate member
of PL, explained the PL stand on
nationalism. "We look on
nationalism as a class outlook of
the bourgeoise. All aspects of
bourgeoise ideas are reactionary.
Nationalist struggles have been
turned around to serve capitalist
interests. The revolutionary
struggle can only be led by
workers."

Analysis

PL-WSA spokesmen claim to
support members of the Black
Panther Party and the people of
North Vietnam, but openly
criticize Panther and North
Vietnamese leaders.
Opposing radical groups, such
as RYM II and Weatherman on
the national level, and Stanford
SDS and the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union locally hold
that nationalism can be either
revolutionary or reactionary. The
Panthers, for example, are
"revolutionary nationalists,"
whereas Ron Karenga's US,
cultural nationalists, are
reactionary, they claim
Metter Disciplined
The Progressive Labor Party is a
more disciplined group than most
other radical factions, with
admission an extremely lengthy
process. Although many members
are students, PL is not a campus
oriented organization.
Nationally, the Worker-Student
Alliance Caucus is probably the
largest organized student radical
block. (Most radical organizations,
like the Stanford SDS are not
affiliated with any national
group.) Opponents of PL-WSA
consider WSA to be PL's "arm on
campus." WSA members, while
admitting that the two groups are
closely associated, insist that PL
has no direct control over WSA,
though many WSA members, are
either PL members or supporters.
The basic thrust of the WSA
movement is the "campus worker
alliance struggle." Hogan
elaborated in his article.
"A student movement has no
long term chance of succeeding
unless it allies itself with the
working class through lasting
friendships and close political ties
with campus workers, because we
have the opportunity *o get part
time jobs (which the
administration has set aside for
students) and work with these
people. These ties can form the
basis of a struggle over specific
injustices against campus workers
in which workers must take the
lead."
Members of Stanford SDS
argue that every job taken by a
student means one less job for a
worker and frequently accuse
WSAers of employing "scab
tactics."
Broadening Base
Standford SDS backs the
Stu dent-Worker Solidarity
Committee, which Bruce Franklin
recently termed "the only
functional (radical) group at
Stanford." A vote at the SDS
meeting two weeks ago extended
SDS membership to the
committee which consists of
students and representatives of
the United Stanford Employees.
According to Banac the "new"
WSA-SDS chapter is open to
"anyone interested in fighting
imperialism and racism,"
including members of RU and the
Stanford SDS.
"We would most certainly like
to see the two factions re-united.
A number of serious issues face
the Stanford student movement.
We welcome people in RU and
others to put forth their lines. It is
very necessary to have a struggle
of ideas."
Despite WSA's open invitation
the "old" SDS apparently is not
as receptive.
"This (WSA) is not a
revolutionary, anti-imperialist, or
even left group, and Stanford SDS
utterly repudiates it," read the
SDS letter to the Daily.
The WSA group at Stanford is
attempting to form a new SDS
affiliated with the National SDS
in Boston, an organization which
Franklin and others have tagged as
"a PL front."
On the national level the two
factions evolving from the unified

RYM group which walked out of
the SDS National Convention this
summer have not been faring
exceptionally well.
A Vanguard Kole
Weatherman, formerly RYM 11,
sees the revolution as very close at
hand and has placed itself in the
"vanguard" role. Weatherman
tactics are largely anarchistic.
Charles Manson, allegedly behind
the Tate case murders, is upheld
by Weatherman as a hero of the
people for directing attacks
against the wealthy element in
America.
Weatherman has lost much of
the strength it showed this
summer and as a national
organization is almost defunct.
Only fifty members attended the
Weatherman National Convention
in Cincinnati last December.
Newsweek magazine (Feb. 16th)
reports that Weatherman "plans
to direct major recruitment
efforts at urban high school
students."
Of the national groups
opposing PL, RYM II is the
largest, though still loosely
organized. RYM II strategy is
their "United Front Against
Imperialism" which stresses tying
the struggles of white workers to
those of American blacks and the
Vietnamese. The cause of
Women's Liberation and an end to
make chauvinism has been picked
up by RYM 11, as it has by nearly
all other radical factions.
RYM II theory is popular with
the "old" Stanford SDS, but there
is also a strong influence from the
Revolutionary Union (formerly
Peninsula Red Guards). Stanford
Prof. Bruce Franklin, an RU
organizer, describes RU as an
alliance of "Marxist-Leninist
collectives."
The expulsion of a small group
of Worker-Student Alliance
(WSA) members from an SDS
meeting two weeks ago marked
the surfacing at Stanford of
antagonistic factions within the
student radical movement.
Since that time ousted WSA
members have formed a "new"
SDS chapter. The last meeting of
the "old" Stanford SDS was held
off campus to insure that WSA
members could not attend.
Internal strife within the
national organization culminated
at last June's SDS National
Convention, when a unified
Revolutionary Youth Movement
(RYM) faction walked out
claiming that it had expelled the
Progressive Labor Party (PLP or
PL) and the WSA caucus from the
SDS. Further splitting occurred
after the walk-out. The unified
RYM faction broke down into
two groups, Weatherman and
RYM 11. Another groii,
composed largely of WSA
members, established itself as the
National SDS and set up
headquarters in Boston.

though officially independent of
