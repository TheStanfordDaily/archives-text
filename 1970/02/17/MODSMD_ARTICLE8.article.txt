# Implicit Superiority
## Racial Discrimination And Non-White Student 
### Subir K. Sanyal 
I am a graduate student from India studying at
Stanford. I read with interest the letter from
Washington University in St. Louis to Miss Karen
S.Y. Ho, a senior in Physics at Stanford, in reply
to her application for graduate study there
(Stanford Daily, February 11, 1970). I urge you to
read the letter if you have not already. The letter
smells of a senseless, empty arrogance.
Apart from the administrative bungle, there are
several points worth our attention in the letter.
First of all, the letter mentioned about the 'risk'
involved in awarding a Graduate Teaching
Assistants}!ip to Oriental candidates because of
their unsatisfactory command of English language.
This appears to be grossly unjust and sweepingly
generalized. I believe that an average Oriental
student has enough background of English (thanks
to English colonialism!) to be able to teach a
scientific subject like physics, where much of the
jargon of the trade is of international usage.
Different Standards
One wonders whether they talk about the same
risk when considering an European student whose
mother tongue is not English. Perhaps yes, perhaps
no—though I think the latter conjecture is more
likely to be correct. I say this because I have seen
the tendency in this country to have different
standards of judgement for students from Europe
and the English-speaking countries on the one
hand and those from the third world on the other.
More often than not, a student from the western
world is implicitely assumed to be superior to his
third world counterpart, unless proved otherwise.
Let me elucidate this by narrating some of my
experiences at Stanford. That was my first quarter
(Spring, 1968). Being a mediocre student from an
Asian country, I arrived at Stanford with that awe
and reverence for the academic excellence for this
abode of intellect. However, to my astonishment I
soon found myself in a comfortable position
academically and did fairly well in that quarter. (I
wasn't too glad though, because fellow students
from my alma mater had done better at Stanford.)
My American room-mate, being sincere as he was,
congratulated me and mentioned that he was
surprised by my results. On being asked about the
reason of his surprise, my friend said with a wise
air that he believed, to quote his words, that
'Indian students are dumb and stupid.' Of the
argument that ensued, the less said the better it is.

Stripped of the empty rhetoric, his main
argument was that the Indian students in his
university had poor comand of the English
language and they didn't know 'how to behave.'
On being pointed out that an average Indian
student has far superior knowledge of English (it
being the language of trade and the medium of
instruction in the universities in India) than is
needed for graduate study in a technical subject,
my friend quickly changed the emphasis and
quipped that he was critical of our command of
our conversational English and not written
English. Regarding his second point, i.e., our lack
of 'etiquette' I pointed out to my friend that if he
to go to our country to study, speak our language
and try to conform to our social standards, he
probably would look as 'dumb and stupid', if nor
more, as an Indian student appears to him. (You
wouldn't have to go too far. Ask a Peace Corps
volunteer, or ask an European about what he
things of some American tourists.)
Social Standards
Since we have come to the topic of social
standards, I may mention about another incident
that affected me. Being brought up in an
environment of 'plain living and high thinking,' I
never pay particular attention to any subtle
aesthetic appeal of my garments. (I have never
been accused of indecent exposure though.) I
detest wearing a neck-tie as it reminds me of our
slavery under the colonialists. But on a special
occasion, when a 'gentlemanly' attire was in order,
I adorned myself with an American-style business
suit. One of my American friends confided that I
looked 'civilized' that evening. In reply, I should
have presented him a book on the history of
civilization—but, unfortunately, I was in a hurry.
W.U. Prejudice
Coming back to the letter from Washington
University, it mentioned that the university 'could
not afford to turn away' some Oriental students
with unusually great scientific potential. Many a
benevolent American tourist can't turn away
beggars flocking around them in Asian cities. Is
there any parallelism between these two
situations? No. In the former case, it is the
university which ultimately benefits from the
scientific potential of the candidate, while in the
latter it's a question of sheer charity. This is

confirmed by the use of the phrase 'could not
afford' in the letter.
The letter cautioned Miss Ho that her 'chances
of success are really very small, perhaps one in a
hundred, at best one in fifty.' A nice way to scare
Asian scholars! The letter continues —'The most
likely candidates will be top of their class in the
very best universities, or better, will have
succeeded already at the graduate level at one of
the best universities.' Such boastful remarks will
undoubtedly turn off many Asian students. But
one may ask 'Isn't Stanford good enough to
prepare a student for graduate study at
Washington University?' 1 confess, I never heard
about this university before coming to the U.S.A.
What is the purpose behind using such superlatives
as 'top of their class in the very best universities'? I
don't think I could have qualified under such
stringent conditions. (Though from what I have
heard from one of my Indian friends, the teaching
standard in that university is inferior to that in my
alma mater in India.)
One wonders why, in spite of such 'efficient'
screening, so many Oriental scholars are floating
around in the campuses all over this country.
Probably the universities 'could not afford to turn
them away.' If you consider only the 'top of their
class in the very best universities' only a handful of
Oriental students can ever qualify for an American
university. Whereas statistics show that after
Canadian students, Chinese (Taiwan and Hong
Kong) and Indian students form the largest group
of foreign students in the U.S.A.
Hole of Foreigner Here
A foreign student from the third world has to
put up with such nonsense through his stay in this
country. The attempt to underestimate the
educational standard and the capabilities of a
non-white student (whether an Afro-American or a
third world student) is all too common. While
applying for admission in a university or for
employment in an American company, I have
always noticed that my one year of university
education in England seems more attractive (to the
university authorities or the recruiter) than my
seven years of university education in India. In
fact I a hard time trying to convince a
responsible authority about the genuineness of a
Postgraduate Diploma I received in India. If you
point out such incidents to proper authorities they

have the excuse that they are not acquainted with
the diverse types of educational systems and
standards in foreign countries and hence are not in
a position to make an accurate judgement in this
regard. Well, now that the Graduate Record
Examination, Test of English as Foreign Language,
etc. are being accepted in most universities in
U.S.A., the above excuse is not convincing.
The Heal Reason
I think, the problem here does not arise from an
ignorance about the educational standards of the
students from the third world, but from an
underlying belief that non-white students in
general are less capable than their white
counterpart. You must have heard or read about
such opinion from some eminent persons in this
country. To be blunt, blonde hair and blue eyes
will always be held in greater esteem than dark
hair and brown eyes.
When Sirhan Sirhan assassinated Robert
Kennedy the mass media in this country referred
to him as a 'Jordanian Arab' and not as an
American. But, when Dr. 11. Khorana (an Indian
emigrant) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine, he
was referred to as an 'American Scientist' and not
as an Indian Punjabi. One can cite myriads of such
examples. All these go to prove that there is a
tendency to discredit non-white people whenever
possible, unless the authorities can't 'afford to
turn them away.'
Common Plight
If you look a little closer you will discover this
to be the common plight of non-white students all
over the western world. Because of the color of
my skin I once had to face a jeering racist crowd in
the enlightened city of Oxford in England. I have
heard similar stories from my friends in Germany.
As a colored student in England 1 had been
literally spat at by a band of hostile white workers
(without any provocation) in the city of
Birmingham. The same sentiment probably works
when a white policeman rushes into a black ghetto
in the U.S.A., or a black citizen is prosecuted for
having entered a 'Whites Only' church in South
Africa, or Mr. Enoch Powell tops the popularity
poll for politicians in England. After reading all
these an unbiased person may wonder why was
Hitler so vehemently denounced. I wonder too.

standard in that university is inferior to that in my
alma mater in India.)
One wonders why, in spite of such 'efficient'
screening, so many Oriental scholars are floating
around in the campuses all over this country.
Probably the universities 'could not afford to turn
them away.' If you consider only the 'top of their
class in the very best universities' only a handful of
Oriental students can ever qualify for an American
university. Whereas statistics show that after
Canadian students, Chinese (Taiwan and Hong
Kong) and Indian students form the largest group
of foreign students in the U.S.A.
Hole of Foreigner Here
A foreign student from the third world has to
put up with such nonsense through his stay in this
country. The attempt to underestimate the
educational standard and the capabilities of a
non-white student (whether an Afro-American or a
third world student) is all too common. While
applying for admission in a university or for
employment in an American company, I have
always noticed that my one year of university
education in England seems more attractive (to the
university authorities or the recruiter) than my
seven years of university education in India. In
fact I a hard time trying to convince a
responsible authority about the genuineness of a
Postgraduate Diploma I received in India. If you
point out such incidents to proper authorities they

have the excuse that they are not acquainted with
the diverse types of educational systems and
standards in foreign countries and hence are not in
a position to make an accurate judgement in this
regard. Well, now that the Graduate Record
Examination, Test of English as Foreign Language,
etc. are being accepted in most universities in
U.S.A., the above excuse is not convincing.
The Heal Reason
I think, the problem here does not arise from an
ignorance about the educational standards of the
students from the third world, but from an
underlying belief that non-white students in
general are less capable than their white
counterpart. You must have heard or read about
such opinion from some eminent persons in this
country. To be blunt, blonde hair and blue eyes
will always be held in greater esteem than dark
hair and brown eyes.
When Sirhan Sirhan assassinated Robert
Kennedy the mass media in this country referred
to him as a 'Jordanian Arab' and not as an
American. But, when Dr. 11. Khorana (an Indian
emigrant) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine, he
was referred to as an 'American Scientist' and not
as an Indian Punjabi. One can cite myriads of such
examples. All these go to prove that there is a
tendency to discredit non-white people whenever
possible, unless the authorities can't 'afford to
turn them away.'
Common Plight
If you look a little closer you will discover this
to be the common plight of non-white students all
over the western world. Because of the color of
my skin I once had to face a jeering racist crowd in
the enlightened city of Oxford in England. I have
heard similar stories from my friends in Germany.
As a colored student in England 1 had been
literally spat at by a band of hostile white workers
(without any provocation) in the city of
Birmingham. The same sentiment probably works
when a white policeman rushes into a black ghetto
in the U.S.A., or a black citizen is prosecuted for
having entered a 'Whites Only' church in South
Africa, or Mr. Enoch Powell tops the popularity
poll for politicians in England. After reading all
these an unbiased person may wonder why was
Hitler so vehemently denounced. I wonder too.
(Subir K. Sanyal is a student in the depart men t

I am a graduate student from India studying at
Stanford. I read with interest the letter from
Washington University in St. Louis to Miss Karen
S.Y. Ho, a senior in Physics at Stanford, in reply
to her application for graduate study there
(Stanford Daily, February 11, 1970). I urge you to
read the letter if you have not already. The letter
smells of a senseless, empty arrogance.
Apart from the administrative bungle, there are
several points worth our attention in the letter.
First of all, the letter mentioned about the 'risk'
involved in awarding a Graduate Teaching
Assistants}!ip to Oriental candidates because of
their unsatisfactory command of English language.
This appears to be grossly unjust and sweepingly
generalized. I believe that an average Oriental
student has enough background of English (thanks
to English colonialism!) to be able to teach a
scientific subject like physics, where much of the
jargon of the trade is of international usage.
Different Standards
One wonders whether they talk about the same
risk when considering an European student whose
mother tongue is not English. Perhaps yes, perhaps
no—though I think the latter conjecture is more
likely to be correct. I say this because I have seen
the tendency in this country to have different
standards of judgement for students from Europe
and the English-speaking countries on the one
hand and those from the third world on the other.
More often than not, a student from the western
world is implicitely assumed to be superior to his
third world counterpart, unless proved otherwise.
Let me elucidate this by narrating some of my
experiences at Stanford. That was my first quarter
(Spring, 1968). Being a mediocre student from an
Asian country, I arrived at Stanford with that awe
and reverence for the academic excellence for this
abode of intellect. However, to my astonishment I
soon found myself in a comfortable position
academically and did fairly well in that quarter. (I
wasn't too glad though, because fellow students
from my alma mater had done better at Stanford.)
My American room-mate, being sincere as he was,
congratulated me and mentioned that he was
surprised by my results. On being asked about the
reason of his surprise, my friend said with a wise
air that he believed, to quote his words, that
'Indian students are dumb and stupid.' Of the
argument that ensued, the less said the better it is.

Stripped of the empty rhetoric, his main
argument was that the Indian students in his
university had poor comand of the English
language and they didn't know 'how to behave.'
On being pointed out that an average Indian
student has far superior knowledge of English (it
being the language of trade and the medium of
instruction in the universities in India) than is
needed for graduate study in a technical subject,
my friend quickly changed the emphasis and
quipped that he was critical of our command of
our conversational English and not written
English. Regarding his second point, i.e., our lack
of 'etiquette' I pointed out to my friend that if he
to go to our country to study, speak our language
and try to conform to our social standards, he
probably would look as 'dumb and stupid', if nor
more, as an Indian student appears to him. (You
wouldn't have to go too far. Ask a Peace Corps
volunteer, or ask an European about what he
things of some American tourists.)
Social Standards
Since we have come to the topic of social
standards, I may mention about another incident
that affected me. Being brought up in an
environment of 'plain living and high thinking,' I
never pay particular attention to any subtle
aesthetic appeal of my garments. (I have never
been accused of indecent exposure though.) I
detest wearing a neck-tie as it reminds me of our
slavery under the colonialists. But on a special
occasion, when a 'gentlemanly' attire was in order,
I adorned myself with an American-style business
suit. One of my American friends confided that I
looked 'civilized' that evening. In reply, I should
have presented him a book on the history of
civilization—but, unfortunately, I was in a hurry.
W.U. Prejudice
Coming back to the letter from Washington
University, it mentioned that the university 'could
not afford to turn away' some Oriental students
with unusually great scientific potential. Many a
benevolent American tourist can't turn away
beggars flocking around them in Asian cities. Is
there any parallelism between these two
situations? No. In the former case, it is the
university which ultimately benefits from the
scientific potential of the candidate, while in the
latter it's a question of sheer charity. This is

confirmed by the use of the phrase 'could not
afford' in the letter.
The letter cautioned Miss Ho that her 'chances
of success are really very small, perhaps one in a
hundred, at best one in fifty.' A nice way to scare
Asian scholars! The letter continues —'The most
likely candidates will be top of their class in the
very best universities, or better, will have
succeeded already at the graduate level at one of
the best universities.' Such boastful remarks will
undoubtedly turn off many Asian students. But
one may ask 'Isn't Stanford good enough to
prepare a student for graduate study at
Washington University?' 1 confess, I never heard
about this university before coming to the U.S.A.
What is the purpose behind using such superlatives
as 'top of their class in the very best universities'? I
don't think I could have qualified under such
stringent conditions. (Though from what I have
heard from one of my Indian friends, the teaching
standard in that university is inferior to that in my
alma mater in India.)
One wonders why, in spite of such 'efficient'
screening, so many Oriental scholars are floating
around in the campuses all over this country.

My American room-mate, being sincere as he was,
congratulated me and mentioned that he was
surprised by my results. On being asked about the
reason of his surprise, my friend said with a wise
air that he believed, to quote his words, that
'Indian students are dumb and stupid.' Of the
argument that ensued, the less said the better it is.

Stripped of the empty rhetoric, his main
argument was that the Indian students in his
university had poor comand of the English
language and they didn't know 'how to behave.'
On being pointed out that an average Indian
student has far superior knowledge of English (it
being the language of trade and the medium of
instruction in the universities in India) than is
needed for graduate study in a technical subject,
my friend quickly changed the emphasis and
quipped that he was critical of our command of
our conversational English and not written
English. Regarding his second point, i.e., our lack
of 'etiquette' I pointed out to my friend that if he
to go to our country to study, speak our language
and try to conform to our social standards, he
probably would look as 'dumb and stupid', if nor
more, as an Indian student appears to him. (You
wouldn't have to go too far. Ask a Peace Corps
volunteer, or ask an European about what he
things of some American tourists.)
Social Standards
Since we have come to the topic of social
standards, I may mention about another incident
that affected me. Being brought up in an
environment of 'plain living and high thinking,' I
never pay particular attention to any subtle
aesthetic appeal of my garments. (I have never
been accused of indecent exposure though.) I
detest wearing a neck-tie as it reminds me of our
slavery under the colonialists. But on a special
occasion, when a 'gentlemanly' attire was in order,
I adorned myself with an American-style business
suit. One of my American friends confided that I
looked 'civilized' that evening. In reply, I should
have presented him a book on the history of
civilization—but, unfortunately, I was in a hurry.
W.U. Prejudice
Coming back to the letter from Washington
University, it mentioned that the university 'could
not afford to turn away' some Oriental students
with unusually great scientific potential. Many a
benevolent American tourist can't turn away
beggars flocking around them in Asian cities. Is
there any parallelism between these two
situations? No. In the former case, it is the
university which ultimately benefits from the
scientific potential of the candidate, while in the
latter it's a question of sheer charity. This is

confirmed by the use of the phrase 'could not
afford' in the letter.
The letter cautioned Miss Ho that her 'chances
of success are really very small, perhaps one in a
hundred, at best one in fifty.' A nice way to scare
Asian scholars! The letter continues —'The most
likely candidates will be top of their class in the
very best universities, or better, will have
succeeded already at the graduate level at one of
the best universities.' Such boastful remarks will
undoubtedly turn off many Asian students. But
one may ask 'Isn't Stanford good enough to
prepare a student for graduate study at
Washington University?' 1 confess, I never heard
about this university before coming to the U.S.A.
What is the purpose behind using such superlatives
as 'top of their class in the very best universities'? I
don't think I could have qualified under such
stringent conditions. (Though from what I have
heard from one of my Indian friends, the teaching
standard in that university is inferior to that in my
alma mater in India.)
One wonders why, in spite of such 'efficient'
screening, so many Oriental scholars are floating
around in the campuses all over this country.
Probably the universities 'could not afford to turn
them away.' If you consider only the 'top of their
class in the very best universities' only a handful of
Oriental students can ever qualify for an American
university. Whereas statistics show that after
Canadian students, Chinese (Taiwan and Hong
Kong) and Indian students form the largest group
of foreign students in the U.S.A.
Hole of Foreigner Here
A foreign student from the third world has to
put up with such nonsense through his stay in this
country. The attempt to underestimate the
educational standard and the capabilities of a
non-white student (whether an Afro-American or a
third world student) is all too common. While
applying for admission in a university or for
employment in an American company, I have
always noticed that my one year of university
education in England seems more attractive (to the
university authorities or the recruiter) than my
seven years of university education in India. In
fact I a hard time trying to convince a
responsible authority about the genuineness of a
Postgraduate Diploma I received in India. If you
point out such incidents to proper authorities they

have the excuse that they are not acquainted with
the diverse types of educational systems and
standards in foreign countries and hence are not in
a position to make an accurate judgement in this
regard. Well, now that the Graduate Record
Examination, Test of English as Foreign Language,
etc. are being accepted in most universities in
U.S.A., the above excuse is not convincing.
The Heal Reason
I think, the problem here does not arise from an
ignorance about the educational standards of the
students from the third world, but from an
underlying belief that non-white students in
general are less capable than their white
counterpart. You must have heard or read about
such opinion from some eminent persons in this
country. To be blunt, blonde hair and blue eyes
will always be held in greater esteem than dark
hair and brown eyes.
When Sirhan Sirhan assassinated Robert
Kennedy the mass media in this country referred
to him as a 'Jordanian Arab' and not as an
American. But, when Dr. 11. Khorana (an Indian
emigrant) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine, he
was referred to as an 'American Scientist' and not
as an Indian Punjabi. One can cite myriads of such
examples. All these go to prove that there is a
tendency to discredit non-white people whenever
possible, unless the authorities can't 'afford to
turn them away.'
Common Plight
If you look a little closer you will discover this
to be the common plight of non-white students all
over the western world. Because of the color of
my skin I once had to face a jeering racist crowd in
the enlightened city of Oxford in England. I have
heard similar stories from my friends in Germany.
As a colored student in England 1 had been
literally spat at by a band of hostile white workers
(without any provocation) in the city of
Birmingham. The same sentiment probably works
when a white policeman rushes into a black ghetto
in the U.S.A., or a black citizen is prosecuted for
having entered a 'Whites Only' church in South
Africa, or Mr. Enoch Powell tops the popularity
poll for politicians in England. After reading all
these an unbiased person may wonder why was
Hitler so vehemently denounced. I wonder too.
(Subir K. Sanyal is a student in the depart men t

I am a graduate student from India studying at
Stanford. I read with interest the letter from
Washington University in St. Louis to Miss Karen
S.Y. Ho, a senior in Physics at Stanford, in reply
to her application for graduate study there
(Stanford Daily, February 11, 1970). I urge you to
read the letter if you have not already. The letter
smells of a senseless, empty arrogance.
Apart from the administrative bungle, there are
several points worth our attention in the letter.
First of all, the letter mentioned about the 'risk'
involved in awarding a Graduate Teaching
Assistants}!ip to Oriental candidates because of
their unsatisfactory command of English language.
This appears to be grossly unjust and sweepingly
generalized. I believe that an average Oriental
student has enough background of English (thanks
to English colonialism!) to be able to teach a
scientific subject like physics, where much of the
jargon of the trade is of international usage.
Different Standards
One wonders whether they talk about the same
risk when considering an European student whose
mother tongue is not English. Perhaps yes, perhaps
no—though I think the latter conjecture is more
likely to be correct. I say this because I have seen
the tendency in this country to have different
standards of judgement for students from Europe
and the English-speaking countries on the one
hand and those from the third world on the other.
More often than not, a student from the western
world is implicitely assumed to be superior to his
third world counterpart, unless proved otherwise.
Let me elucidate this by narrating some of my
experiences at Stanford. That was my first quarter
(Spring, 1968). Being a mediocre student from an
Asian country, I arrived at Stanford with that awe
and reverence for the academic excellence for this
abode of intellect. However, to my astonishment I
soon found myself in a comfortable position
academically and did fairly well in that quarter. (I
wasn't too glad though, because fellow students
from my alma mater had done better at Stanford.)
My American room-mate, being sincere as he was,
congratulated me and mentioned that he was
surprised by my results. On being asked about the
reason of his surprise, my friend said with a wise
air that he believed, to quote his words, that
'Indian students are dumb and stupid.' Of the
argument that ensued, the less said the better it is.

argument was that the Indian students in his
university had poor comand of the English
language and they didn't know 'how to behave.'

will always be held in greater esteem than dark
hair and brown eyes.
When Sirhan Sirhan assassinated Robert
Kennedy the mass media in this country referred
to him as a 'Jordanian Arab' and not as an
American. But, when Dr. 11. Khorana (an Indian
emigrant) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine, he
was referred to as an 'American Scientist' and not
as an Indian Punjabi. One can cite myriads of such
examples. All these go to prove that there is a
tendency to discredit non-white people whenever
possible, unless the authorities can't 'afford to
turn them away.'
Common Plight
If you look a little closer you will discover this
to be the common plight of non-white students all
over the western world. Because of the color of
my skin I once had to face a jeering racist crowd in
the enlightened city of Oxford in England. I have
heard similar stories from my friends in Germany.
As a colored student in England 1 had been
literally spat at by a band of hostile white workers
(without any provocation) in the city of
Birmingham. The same sentiment probably works
when a white policeman rushes into a black ghetto
in the U.S.A., or a black citizen is prosecuted for
having entered a 'Whites Only' church in South
Africa, or Mr. Enoch Powell tops the popularity
poll for politicians in England. After reading all
these an unbiased person may wonder why was
Hitler so vehemently denounced. I wonder too.

I am a graduate student from India studying at
Stanford. I read with interest the letter from
Washington University in St. Louis to Miss Karen
S.Y. Ho, a senior in Physics at Stanford, in reply
to her application for graduate study there
(Stanford Daily, February 11, 1970). I urge you to
read the letter if you have not already. The letter
smells of a senseless, empty arrogance.
Apart from the administrative bungle, there are
several points worth our attention in the letter.
First of all, the letter mentioned about the 'risk'
involved in awarding a Graduate Teaching
Assistants}!ip to Oriental candidates because of
their unsatisfactory command of English language.
This appears to be grossly unjust and sweepingly
generalized. I believe that an average Oriental
student has enough background of English (thanks
to English colonialism!) to be able to teach a
scientific subject like physics, where much of the
jargon of the trade is of international usage.
Different Standards
One wonders whether they talk about the same
risk when considering an European student whose
mother tongue is not English. Perhaps yes, perhaps
no—though I think the latter conjecture is more
likely to be correct. I say this because I have seen
the tendency in this country to have different
standards of judgement for students from Europe
and the English-speaking countries on the one
hand and those from the third world on the other.
More often than not, a student from the western
world is implicitely assumed to be superior to his
third world counterpart, unless proved otherwise.
Let me elucidate this by narrating some of my
experiences at Stanford. That was my first quarter
(Spring, 1968). Being a mediocre student from an
Asian country, I arrived at Stanford with that awe
and reverence for the academic excellence for this
abode of intellect. However, to my astonishment I
soon found myself in a comfortable position
academically and did fairly well in that quarter. (I
wasn't too glad though, because fellow students
from my alma mater had done better at Stanford.)
My American room-mate, being sincere as he was,
congratulated me and mentioned that he was
surprised by my results. On being asked about the
reason of his surprise, my friend said with a wise
air that he believed, to quote his words, that
'Indian students are dumb and stupid.' Of the
argument that ensued, the less said the better it is.

Stripped of the empty rhetoric, his main
argument was that the Indian students in his
university had poor comand of the English
language and they didn't know 'how to behave.'
On being pointed out that an average Indian
student has far superior knowledge of English (it
being the language of trade and the medium of
instruction in the universities in India) than is
needed for graduate study in a technical subject,
my friend quickly changed the emphasis and
quipped that he was critical of our command of
our conversational English and not written
English. Regarding his second point, i.e., our lack
of 'etiquette' I pointed out to my friend that if he
to go to our country to study, speak our language
and try to conform to our social standards, he
probably would look as 'dumb and stupid', if nor
more, as an Indian student appears to him. (You
wouldn't have to go too far. Ask a Peace Corps
volunteer, or ask an European about what he
things of some American tourists.)
Social Standards
Since we have come to the topic of social
standards, I may mention about another incident
that affected me. Being brought up in an
environment of 'plain living and high thinking,' I
never pay particular attention to any subtle
aesthetic appeal of my garments. (I have never
been accused of indecent exposure though.) I
detest wearing a neck-tie as it reminds me of our
slavery under the colonialists. But on a special
occasion, when a 'gentlemanly' attire was in order,
I adorned myself with an American-style business
suit. One of my American friends confided that I
looked 'civilized' that evening. In reply, I should
have presented him a book on the history of
civilization—but, unfortunately, I was in a hurry.
W.U. Prejudice
Coming back to the letter from Washington
University, it mentioned that the university 'could
not afford to turn away' some Oriental students
with unusually great scientific potential. Many a
benevolent American tourist can't turn away
beggars flocking around them in Asian cities. Is
there any parallelism between these two
situations? No. In the former case, it is the
university which ultimately benefits from the
scientific potential of the candidate, while in the
latter it's a question of sheer charity. This is

confirmed by the use of the phrase 'could not
afford' in the letter.
The letter cautioned Miss Ho that her 'chances
of success are really very small, perhaps one in a
hundred, at best one in fifty.' A nice way to scare
Asian scholars! The letter continues —'The most
likely candidates will be top of their class in the
very best universities, or better, will have
succeeded already at the graduate level at one of
the best universities.' Such boastful remarks will
undoubtedly turn off many Asian students. But
one may ask 'Isn't Stanford good enough to
prepare a student for graduate study at
Washington University?' 1 confess, I never heard
about this university before coming to the U.S.A.
What is the purpose behind using such superlatives
as 'top of their class in the very best universities'? I
don't think I could have qualified under such
stringent conditions. (Though from what I have
heard from one of my Indian friends, the teaching
standard in that university is inferior to that in my
alma mater in India.)
One wonders why, in spite of such 'efficient'
screening, so many Oriental scholars are floating
around in the campuses all over this country.
Probably the universities 'could not afford to turn
them away.' If you consider only the 'top of their
class in the very best universities' only a handful of
Oriental students can ever qualify for an American
university. Whereas statistics show that after
Canadian students, Chinese (Taiwan and Hong
Kong) and Indian students form the largest group
of foreign students in the U.S.A.
Hole of Foreigner Here
A foreign student from the third world has to
put up with such nonsense through his stay in this
country. The attempt to underestimate the
educational standard and the capabilities of a
non-white student (whether an Afro-American or a
third world student) is all too common. While
applying for admission in a university or for
employment in an American company, I have
always noticed that my one year of university
education in England seems more attractive (to the
university authorities or the recruiter) than my
seven years of university education in India. In
fact I a hard time trying to convince a
responsible authority about the genuineness of a
Postgraduate Diploma I received in India. If you
point out such incidents to proper authorities they

have the excuse that they are not acquainted with
the diverse types of educational systems and
standards in foreign countries and hence are not in
a position to make an accurate judgement in this
regard. Well, now that the Graduate Record
Examination, Test of English as Foreign Language,
etc. are being accepted in most universities in
U.S.A., the above excuse is not convincing.
The Heal Reason
I think, the problem here does not arise from an
ignorance about the educational standards of the
students from the third world, but from an
underlying belief that non-white students in
general are less capable than their white
counterpart. You must have heard or read about
such opinion from some eminent persons in this
country. To be blunt, blonde hair and blue eyes
will always be held in greater esteem than dark
hair and brown eyes.
When Sirhan Sirhan assassinated Robert
Kennedy the mass media in this country referred
to him as a 'Jordanian Arab' and not as an
American. But, when Dr. 11. Khorana (an Indian
emigrant) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine, he
was referred to as an 'American Scientist' and not
as an Indian Punjabi. One can cite myriads of such
examples. All these go to prove that there is a
tendency to discredit non-white people whenever
possible, unless the authorities can't 'afford to
