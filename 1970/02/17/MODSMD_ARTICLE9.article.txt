# Up The Middle
## ROTC Is Essential 
### Jesse Cederbaum 
I guess I spoke too soon. What I meant to say
last week was that Pat Cunningham's old Agnew
note sickened me because in "recalling the figures
released by the Administration showing the
overwhelming support of the public for the junior
executive's crusade against public enlightenment,
one cannot help but wonder how many other
letters expressing opposition to Agnew's oratorical
defamation of the press were interpreted by the
White House public relations staff in a similar
light."
But somehow, in the midst of the complex
editorial manipulations which go into the making
of a great cosmopolitan newspaper, one of my
colleagues succeeded in eliminating what, in my
opinion at least, was the most significant bit of
tripe in the whole article. Maybe Spiro was right,
after all. Or is that just an occupation hazard of
being a Freshman staffer?
Why ROTC?
Which somehow brings up the issue of ROTC. It
should not be thrown off campus, or denied
credit, or any of those things. There seems to be a
trend at Stanford to offer courses designed to
please many minority groupsâ€”blacks, chicanos,
jews, ecology buffs, karate fiends, etc. So why
should the University take it upon itself to deny to
those misguided few who desire it a curriculum in
Military Science? We may as well refrain from
giving credit, and conferring degrees in Chemistry
because all that chemists do is help screw up our
environment.
The basic objection that most people seem to
have to ROTC is that it supports the military
establishment which, in its divine bungling, got our
country entangled in the Vietnam War. However,
the arguement which contends that by defeating
ROTC on campus we shall be greatly injuring the
Military-Industrial Complex is wholly fallacious. It
will exist with or without ROTC. Our efforts to
end the War are better directed in such projects as
the Moratorium (not to be confused with the
expressly anti-ROTC New Moratorium)
demonstrations, putting pressure on Csovernment
officials and suchlike.
Military Structure Kssenlial
Some sort ol military structure is necessary to
the existence of this country. We are not living in
pre-World War I days when the nearest conceivable
enemy resided across the vast oceans. The day

might well come when the military might of the
United States will be necessary to fight in a truly
just and essential war. We cannot, by any means,
pursue a policy of isolation and pacifism.
Not that the American Military in its present
form is good. It isn't. It is by far the most vicious
and corrupt element of our society. But strange as
it may seem to say this, one of the few hopes I can
see for "reforming" the military is through ROTC.
II not lor the existence of such a program on
college campuses, all those seeking some sort of
military training, whether for chauvinistic or
personal reasons, would be forced to attend a
military academy such as West Point of Annapolis.
Mindless illolts
These institutions are notorious for blotting out
the mind of the individual and producing in its
st e ad what is commonly referred to as the
military intelligence." However, if a person
undergoes ROTC training at a center of higher
learning, he enters into his part-time military
career with at least some sort of a Humanist
background. Thus there is a greater chance that
someday the military elite of our country will
develop into something othe r than a corps of
effete, bloodthirsty warmongers.
University Sham
The University's attempts to please everybody
involved are making a sh.'.m of this whole affair.
ROTC offerings should he treated in the same
manner as courses offered by any other
department of the University. Treating them as
"Undergraduate Specials" as is presently being
done is a handy method of not facing up to the
issue. ROTC course offerings should be evaluated
according to their academic merits and accredited
as any other course offering. If this is not found to
be a desirable course of action, perhaps ROTC
could be placed on the level of an extra-curricular
activity, such as the DAILY, or ASSU, or the
band, etc.
But in any case, ROTC should be allowed to
remain on campus, tor the University community
has no right to deny the individual his freedom of
choice, especially il he is one of those who is
willing to go so far as to sign his life away to
protect the dubious freedoms of the rest of us
pacifists.
