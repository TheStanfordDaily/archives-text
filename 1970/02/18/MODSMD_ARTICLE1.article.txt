# Disruption's Aftermath
## Businessmen React Calmly 
### 
Palo Alto businessmen and
Stanford officials reacted calmly
yesterday to Monday night's
vandalism/revolution on El
Camino.
By midafternoon, most of the
broken windows had been
replaced, with business proceeding
as normal.

In a prepared statement,
Stanford president Kenneth Pitzer
said he "greatly regrets the
destructive acts ..." and declared
that the University will not curtail
freedom of speech and assembly
on campus.
He noted that, "to do so
probably would prove

self-defeating by broadening the
base of participation in
potentially disruptive acts."
At the Wells Fargo Bank,
manager Carl Schmitt recalled
earlier acts of destruction. "We
had a rock through our back
window around the time of the
SRI demonstrations last
spring .. . and we've had some
gunshots in the last year."
He has had no overt threats to
date, however. Asked why the
damage, he replied, "I suppose
we're just members of the
Establishment."
A similar calm prevailed at the
Bank of America, where damage
fell below the $1500 incurred by
Wells Fargo. Manager Vic Burton
praised Palo Alto police for their
viligance. "They knew there
would be some reaction, and they
had the area well patrolled." He
recalled some unrelated vandalism
in the past, terming Monday's
destruction "the first of its kind
in three years at the EI Camino
location."
"It's unfortunate," he
continued, "we've had orderly
groups go by many times in the
past. It's certainly an unusual
occurrence."
At the Stanford Ski Shop, the
only non-financial institution hit,
manager Ken Don was asked if the
was the first time his property had
been attacked. He replied,
"No—and that's all the
information I'm going to give,"
declining to answer further
questions.
For non-student Kenneth
Garner arrested during the march,
it was also business as usual.
Released early Tuesday morning,
he was deemed "not arrested"
yesterday by the Palo Alto police.
