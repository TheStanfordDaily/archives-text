Black Prof. Clarifies
Editor, THE DAILY:
The quotation attributed to
associate provost Robert M.
Rosenweig (Daily, Feb. 12)
concerning the Stanford Black
Studies Program contains several
implications which have been
misinterpreted by black students
as being reflective of the opinions
held by black faculty members.
I refer specifically to Mr.
Rosenweig's statement that "we
(Stanford) have kept ourselves out
of the bag of hiring teachers
specifically for (the Black Studies
Program) ... If our program
should end tomorrow, we would
keep all our Black Studies'
teachers on in their departments."
As a black faculty member
participating in the Black Studies
Program, I would like to reassure
the black students at Stanford
that a major incentive for my
being here is in fact the existence
of a Black Studies Program, under
the able directorship of Professor
Drake. While it is true that black
faculty are hired by and
responsible to specific traditional
departments, the assumption that
these departments are somehow
intrinsically superior to the Black
Studies Department must be
rejected.
While I do have some
reservations about the wisdom of
Black students attending Stanford
as undergraduates, I am fully
supportive of the Black Studies
concept as both academically
necessary and culturally legitimate
and, as a social scientist, would
view its termination as an
occasion for serious
re-examination on my own
presence on campus.
A termination of the Stanford
Black Studies Department would
be tautamount to a denial of the
importance of cultural
perspectives in the examination of
social phenomena. Such a denial
portents dangerous social
theorizing on campuses such as
Stanford where there is an
all-too-frequent equation made
between social conflict and the
existence of too many (black)
people, (cf. Campus Report, Vol.
11, No. 18, pg. 3.)
One of the strengths of the
Black Studies Departments lies in
its refusal to cop out intellectually
on controversial issues which
threaten the very existence of
black people. So long as white
definitions of social issues remain
confined to the examination of
the cognitive functioning of and
overpopulation by non-white
people, it is both morally and
intellectually mandatory that the
black perspective, as embodied in
various departments of Black
Studies, be adequately funded and
fully legitimized.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Many of my friends were
impressed by the closing
quotation of Sloane Coffin when
he spoke at Mem Chu: "I now go
forth to the smithy of my soul to
forge the uncreated conscience of
my race." It seems to me that
such prosody could be the basis of
a new form of aphorism that
would put new life into the
cliches of our time.
—I now go forth to the
bedroom of my soul to love the
unfurled flag of my country.
—I now go forth to the window
of my soul to feel the random
draft of the country.
—I now go forth to the
artichoke of my soul to eat my
heart out.
—I now go forth to the grocery
of my soul to find my just
desserts.
—I now go forth to the food
service of my soul to eat it.
—I now go forth to the
California of my soul to feel the
earthquake of my imagination.
—I now go forth to the
Vietnam of my soul to defoliate
the seething jungles of my mind.
—I now go forth to the
cemetery of my soul to write the
epitaph for my country.

The employees are again forced
to pay an increase for health care.
We are not consulted. We are told.
The news arrives in
interdepartmental mail.
I feel it is extortion—legal—but
extortion. I feel the Stanford
administrators are accomplices.
They acquiesce in every increase
by their do-nothing attitude. I
hear the faculty give lip service to
the need for adequate health care
for the poor. Mow about
adequate health care for the
working poor—the Stanford
employeeVNo real alternatives are
offered us. So we are forced to
accept and pay and pay.
It is not enough to talk in
generalities about the high cost of
medicine. We who pay know that.
Can we devise a better system?
For what is the money used?To
whom does the money go?We
cannot help but become
suspicious when we read that the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic received
over $1,000,000 from
Medicare-Medical—about $10,000
a year for each doctor. Yet this is
not all. The physicians receive
additional money from insurance
companies to whom the elderly
pay premiums in order to partially
cover hills not paid by Medicare.
Since even this may be
insufficient, the physicians collect
directly from the elderly. Is there
a relationship between the

availability of government money
and the spiraling cost of medical
care?
The rates for health care for
employees also continue to
escalate. Without consultation or
advice, we have been notified of a
new increase in rates. Why? Is
there a relationship between the
increased rates and Stanford's
recent contribution to employee
health cost?
Should Stanford's
responsibility stop here?
I believe that through our
organization, the United Stanford
Employees, we should demand
that the University accept
financial responsibility for paying
the total cost of health care for
employees and their families. This
may be the pressure, the impetus
that is needed to prod the
Administration and its faculty of
experts to start now to help us
plan an adequate health program
for the entire Stanford
Community.

additional money from insurance

a relationship between the

I believe that through our

that the University accept
financial responsibility for paying
the total cost of health care for

Editor, THE DAILY:
The quotation attributed to
associate provost Robert M.
Rosenweig (Daily, Feb. 12)
concerning the Stanford Black
Studies Program contains several
implications which have been
misinterpreted by black students
as being reflective of the opinions
held by black faculty members.
I refer specifically to Mr.
Rosenweig's statement that "we
(Stanford) have kept ourselves out
of the bag of hiring teachers
specifically for (the Black Studies
Program) ... If our program
should end tomorrow, we would
keep all our Black Studies'
teachers on in their departments."
As a black faculty member
participating in the Black Studies
Program, I would like to reassure
the black students at Stanford
that a major incentive for my
being here is in fact the existence
of a Black Studies Program, under
the able directorship of Professor
Drake. While it is true that black
faculty are hired by and
responsible to specific traditional
departments, the assumption that
these departments are somehow
intrinsically superior to the Black
Studies Department must be
rejected.
While I do have some
reservations about the wisdom of
Black students attending Stanford
as undergraduates, I am fully
supportive of the Black Studies
concept as both academically
necessary and culturally legitimate
and, as a social scientist, would
view its termination as an
occasion for serious
re-examination on my own
presence on campus.
A termination of the Stanford
Black Studies Department would
be tautamount to a denial of the
importance of cultural
perspectives in the examination of
social phenomena. Such a denial
portents dangerous social
theorizing on campuses such as
Stanford where there is an
all-too-frequent equation made
between social conflict and the
existence of too many (black)
people, (cf. Campus Report, Vol.
11, No. 18, pg. 3.)
One of the strengths of the
Black Studies Departments lies in
its refusal to cop out intellectually
on controversial issues which
threaten the very existence of
black people. So long as white
definitions of social issues remain
confined to the examination of
the cognitive functioning of and
overpopulation by non-white
people, it is both morally and
intellectually mandatory that the
black perspective, as embodied in
various departments of Black
Studies, be adequately funded and
fully legitimized.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The quotation attributed to
associate provost Robert M.
Rosenweig (Daily, Feb. 12)
concerning the Stanford Black
Studies Program contains several
implications which have been
misinterpreted by black students
as being reflective of the opinions
held by black faculty members.
I refer specifically to Mr.
Rosenweig's statement that "we
(Stanford) have kept ourselves out
of the bag of hiring teachers
specifically for (the Black Studies
Program) ... If our program
should end tomorrow, we would
keep all our Black Studies'
teachers on in their departments."
As a black faculty member
participating in the Black Studies
Program, I would like to reassure
the black students at Stanford
that a major incentive for my
being here is in fact the existence
of a Black Studies Program, under
the able directorship of Professor
Drake. While it is true that black
faculty are hired by and
responsible to specific traditional
departments, the assumption that
these departments are somehow
intrinsically superior to the Black
Studies Department must be
rejected.
While I do have some
reservations about the wisdom of
Black students attending Stanford
as undergraduates, I am fully
supportive of the Black Studies
concept as both academically
necessary and culturally legitimate
and, as a social scientist, would
view its termination as an
occasion for serious
re-examination on my own
presence on campus.
A termination of the Stanford
Black Studies Department would
be tautamount to a denial of the
importance of cultural
perspectives in the examination of
social phenomena. Such a denial
portents dangerous social
theorizing on campuses such as
Stanford where there is an
all-too-frequent equation made
between social conflict and the
existence of too many (black)
people, (cf. Campus Report, Vol.
11, No. 18, pg. 3.)
One of the strengths of the
Black Studies Departments lies in
its refusal to cop out intellectually
on controversial issues which
threaten the very existence of
black people. So long as white
definitions of social issues remain
confined to the examination of
the cognitive functioning of and
overpopulation by non-white
people, it is both morally and
intellectually mandatory that the
black perspective, as embodied in
various departments of Black
Studies, be adequately funded and
fully legitimized.

"/ Now Go Forth "
Editor, THE DAILY:
Many of my friends were
impressed by the closing
quotation of Sloane Coffin when
he spoke at Mem Chu: "I now go
forth to the smithy of my soul to
forge the uncreated conscience of
my race." It seems to me that
such prosody could be the basis of
a new form of aphorism that
would put new life into the
cliches of our time.
—I now go forth to the
bedroom of my soul to love the
unfurled flag of my country.
—I now go forth to the window
of my soul to feel the random
draft of the country.
—I now go forth to the
artichoke of my soul to eat my
heart out.
—I now go forth to the grocery
of my soul to find my just
desserts.
—I now go forth to the food
service of my soul to eat it.
—I now go forth to the
California of my soul to feel the
earthquake of my imagination.
—I now go forth to the
Vietnam of my soul to defoliate
the seething jungles of my mind.
—I now go forth to the
cemetery of my soul to write the
epitaph for my country.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The employees are again forced
to pay an increase for health care.
We are not consulted. We are told.
The news arrives in
interdepartmental mail.
I feel it is extortion—legal—but
extortion. I feel the Stanford
administrators are accomplices.
They acquiesce in every increase
by their do-nothing attitude. I
hear the faculty give lip service to
the need for adequate health care
for the poor. Mow about
adequate health care for the
working poor—the Stanford
employeeVNo real alternatives are
offered us. So we are forced to
accept and pay and pay.
It is not enough to talk in
generalities about the high cost of
medicine. We who pay know that.
Can we devise a better system?
For what is the money used?To
whom does the money go?We
cannot help but become
suspicious when we read that the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic received
over $1,000,000 from
Medicare-Medical—about $10,000
a year for each doctor. Yet this is
not all. The physicians receive
additional money from insurance
companies to whom the elderly
pay premiums in order to partially
cover hills not paid by Medicare.
Since even this may be
insufficient, the physicians collect
directly from the elderly. Is there
a relationship between the

availability of government money
and the spiraling cost of medical
care?
The rates for health care for
employees also continue to
escalate. Without consultation or
advice, we have been notified of a
new increase in rates. Why? Is
there a relationship between the
increased rates and Stanford's
recent contribution to employee
health cost?
Should Stanford's
responsibility stop here?
I believe that through our
organization, the United Stanford
Employees, we should demand
that the University accept
financial responsibility for paying
the total cost of health care for
employees and their families. This
may be the pressure, the impetus
that is needed to prod the
Administration and its faculty of
experts to start now to help us
plan an adequate health program
for the entire Stanford
Community.
