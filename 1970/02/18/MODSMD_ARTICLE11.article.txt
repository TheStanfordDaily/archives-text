# Interview With Socialist Workers Candidate
## Capitalism....Answer: Socialism 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
In Antonio Camejo's opinion,
the problem with this country is
capitalism and the solution
"revolutionary socialism."
But then Camejo is Solialist
Workers candidate for
Superintendent of Public
Instruction,
He has some of the most
pleasing suggestions to have been
put forward since President Pitzer
approved the Pill. For instance he
says,"The question is not how
much tuition UC students should
pay, but rather how much we
should pay students so that they
don't have to engage in
distractions like part time jobs. Its
just a matter of priorities."
According to Camejo "We have
a repressive tax structure: 10
percent of the tax money comes
from private industry and 50
percent from individuals making
less than $10,000 a year: this
should be reversed.
"We call for the nationalization
of P(J&E and Pacific Telephone:
they make a $5 million profit in

the city of Berkeley alone." He
would also give tidelands' oil
revenues to education,
Recycled Water
His most radical proposal for
financing education is to have
industry (the prime user of water)
recycle the water it uses and
spend the money from the water
project on education.
Camejo is a former instructor at
Merrit College's
Mexican-American Studies
Program, and an active participant
in the struggle to set up third
world colleges. One of his
platform planks calls for the
establishment of third world
colleges "controlled by third
world students, faculty, and
community members receiving
adequate funding for all
programs."
He also asks bilingual education
in the schools and the elimination
of all aptitude and achievement
tests which don't take into
account the different cultural and
language background of Chicano
and Latino students. He pointed

out that 30,000 of 87,000
students in classes for mentally
retarded were of Spanish surname,
and that many of them were there
because they had failed English
language and culture tests.
No Chance
Why is he entering a campaign
which he can not win? "We're
running a slate of candidates
throughout the state, calling for a
break with the Republicans and
Democrats, and calling for
independent political action by
blacks, Chicanos, and the labor
movement," he says.
"We call on people to vote for
us as a protest vote. For, as
Eugene Debs said, its better to
vote for what you want and not
get it than to vote for what you
don't want and get it."
He also expresses cynicism for
"the lesser of two evels" voting:
"It's not a matter of good
individuals but replacing a social
class that is in power, replacing it
with the working class."
Camejo will attend the March
conference in Denver which hopes

to set up a Chicano political party
for "If a Chicano political party
were formed it would have to
have a working class political
program which would appeal to
all workers.
A Necessary Step
"For those people to say that
they'll start their own political
party is revolutionary as a
necessary step for themselves. As
the struggle develops black and
brown people in general will
realize that self determination and
control cannot be granted by
capitalism and that revolutionary
socialism is necessary for
freedom "
He brings a different
perspective the inter-SDS
squabbling on this campus: "The
problem with SDS is that they try
and bring together all sorts of
radicals without developing any

program or perspective. The
minute they had to develop a
program when the PL people
intervened they fell apart.
"We call for all radical groups
to come together under slogans
like 'immediate withdraw!' and
mass demonstrations," he said.
"We will line up with others for
concrete actions when we can
agree on the issue at hand. But in
a political campaign we're dealing
with a whole spectrum and can't
get into agreement with many
groups."
And finally what is
revolutionary socialism? "While
we fight for immediate reforms to
improve conditions as they are
now; they cannot solve the
problem though. We favor the
eventuality that when the masses
ol people see the need for
revolution the ruling class will
respond with violence.
Revolutions happen when the
ruling class refuses to give up the
power to when the people
demand it."
