# Surgeon Urges Federal Action
## Commercial Blood: High Risk 
### 
A Stanford surgeon claims that
90 Percent of deadly hepatitis
from blood transfusions can be
traced to the use of commercial
blood, and urges federal action to
stop it.
Dr. J. Garrott Allen, professor
of surgery at the Stanford School
of Medicine, wants the division of
Biologies Standards of the U.S.
Public Health Service to take steps
to remove commercial blood from
the market or to label it as as a
"high-risk product" if its use must
continue.
At present there is no federal
requirement to distinguish
commercial from volunteer blood.

Allen said that in the last 10
years, his laboratory has published
overwhelming evidence pointing
to enormous differences in the
safety of volunteer and
commercial bloods.
Data Available
Data from the University of
Washington School of Medicine
and the National Institutes of
Health "strikingly illustrate my
previous observations in which the
risk of hepatitis was 10 to 25
times greater for commercial
blood than for voluntary blood,"
Dr. Allen said. "Yet there has
been little action—official or
unofficial —to protect the public."

Launching a one-man campaign
to bring the problem to public
attention, Dr. Allen declared that
more than 5,000 cases of hepatitis
are being caused in California
alone each year by transfusions of
blood from paid donors.
Deficits of blood are presently
made up by the purchase of blood
from high-risk population
composed of prison donors,
skid-row volunteers, and hippie
addicts, Dr. Allen explained.
Ethical Questions
The practice of making up
blood deficits from high risk
donors poses a serious ethical
question, if not a legal one, Dr.
Allen said. This is the assurance
that a volunteer blood donor,
contributing to his blood club or
to his community blood bank will
be turn receive from similarly
low-risk carrier population, if he
needs blood later.
"Volunteer donors who do not
receive such a guarantee should
refuse to give blood," he said.
"Under most circumstances
today, blood replacement bv
relatives and friends of patients is
not required," he explained. "To
provide enough volunteer blood
for everyone, such a requirement
would be a first step."
