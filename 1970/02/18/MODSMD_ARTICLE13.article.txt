# Stanford Ups Rates
## 
### 
Stanford University has
announced that it will increase its
mortgage interest rates for
on-campus real estate loans from
5Vi percent to 7'/2 percent starting
March 31.
But the rate remains well below
the prevailing Midpeninsula single
family home rate which is placed
at 9'/2/percent by savings and loans
associations.
The University rates will be
adjusted annually to remain below
rates in the local commercial
markets.
Campus residents who execute
ground leases by March 31. and

plan to start construction of
homes by Sept. 30, 1970 can still
qualify for the soon-to-be-retired
5V4 percent rate.
Buyers of on-campus homes
may also obtain 5Vi percent loans
if they contract for the purchase
by March 31 and the sale will
close by June 30.
The University lends funds for
home loans according to Ed
Scoles, assistant business manager
for university housing. About
1,200 faculty and staff members
are currently eligible to purchase
homes on campus.
