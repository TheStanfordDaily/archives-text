# Women s Lib. For Males & Females
## 
### 
An organizational meeting of
the Stanford Area Chapter of
National Organization for Women
(NOW) will be held this Thursday,
February 19, at 8 P.M. in TMU
282.
NOW is not a women's
organization. It is open to all men
and women who are interested in
working for equality for women.
Everywhere one looks men are
the administrators, bosses,
doctors, associate professors;
women are the administrative
assistants, secretaries, nurses,
research associates. Men are the
doers, the decision makers;
women are the assistants - the
record keepers and letter writers -
the human machinery necessary
to get the job done. Even at the
same job rank, women on the
average receive substantially less
pay. It seems unlikely that this
situation is due to a basic genetic
inferiority. The problem that
women face is complex and
involves inequality in educational
and job opportunities,
discriminatory legislation,
counselling directed toward
traditional women's occupations
and the attitudes held by men and
women regarding woman's role in
society.
The relation of equality for
women to the population

explosion is obvious. If women
have meaningful work they will be
more inclined to limit the size of
their families. Conversely, when
motherhood is no longer a
full-time, life-long job, women
(and society) will benefit from
women having real work to do in
the outside world.
If you are interested in working
for a society where a person's
achievement is limited only by
ability and aspiration and where
men and women have equal rights
and responsibilities, come to the
Thursday meeting of NOW.
