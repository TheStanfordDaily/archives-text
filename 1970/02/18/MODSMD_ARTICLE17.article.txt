# Middle East Scholar To Speak
## 
### 
"Escalation of the war" is not a
term reserved for discussions of
Vietnam. The Daily news reports
coming in from the Middle East
clearly support the view that the
conflict in the Middle East is
escalating and may turn into
full-scale war at any time. With
the Arab-Israeli crisis posing such
a threat to world peace the Middle
East Desk of the International
Association finds it relevant to
present yet another scholar to add
to our understanding of the
situation. Dr. George Lenczowski,
Professor of Political Science at
the University of California,

Berkeley, is one of the most
well-known scholars of the Middle
East. He has authored or editted
six books on the area and written
many articles in professional
journals. Unlike many scholars
who bury themselves in books and
lose real contact with their areas,
Dr. Lenczowski travels annually
to the Middle East to study
developments there. He will speak
to the Stanford community this
Wednesday, February 18th, on
"THE REGIONAL IMPACT OF
THE ARAB-ISRAELI CRISIS".
The lecture will be held in the
Large Lounge of Tresidder Union
at 8:00 p.m.
