# For What It’s Worth
## Stale SF Rock Sound Freshens Up 
### CRAIG OKINO 
Whoever said everything occurs
in cycles wasn't talking through
his pants. Just when the rock
world was overflowing with stale,
faceless groups playing boring,
derivative music, old faces with
new hopes and sounds begin to
emerge again.
The bands appearing lately
throughout the Bay Area in
nightclubs, at Fillmore West and
at Chet Helms' floundering
Family Dog have not been
ridiculous third wave groups like
Aum or Cold Blood, but the San
Francisco originals, the people
who began it all, playing with all
their former fierceness and
originality, twice as good as ever.
Three weekends ago Big
Brother and the Holding
Company (Sans Janis) performed
on campus. The boys are through
playing the role of back-up band
to a fat chick with superstar
hangups, and they are all the
better without her. The main
ingredient in Big Brother's music
is not instrumental virtuosity but
plain old raunch—the original
freak-rick band comes to life and
togetherness.
Raw, Gutsy Sound
A twenty-pounds-lighter Sam

Andrew (ten pounds of which was
probably hair) has developed into
a fine guitarist. And I know many
didn't dig his singing, but I have
always liked it—raw and gutsy,
augmenting the vocals with little
grunts and shouts. Albin has
switched to rhythm guitar and the
outrageous James Gurley is on
bass. Nick Gravenites joins them
for a few songs, but the difference
is that the spotlight is on the band
all the time.
Their sound is sometimes
sloppy but that's Big Brother,
playing in their tribal stomp style.
Fantastic. They were at the
Poppycock last weekend and will
be at the Family Dog this
weekend with another revival
band, the Rhythm Dukes (with
former Moby Grapers Jerry Miller
and Don Stevenson).
Raves For Ou'cksilver
Two weeks ago, another of the
monster bands, the Quicksilver
Messenger Service, was at the
Family Dog, and after Ralph
Gleason's ravings about the
in last Monday's Chronicle, I can't
say much more. Gary Duncan,
their former rhythm/lead
guitarist, and folksinger Dino
Valenti, always an honorary
Messenger but never one of the
group, have been added to the
Service, completing their sound
and making the band one of the
best around.
The emphasis in Quicksilver is
interaction, and the interaction
between the two guitarists and
Hopkin's piano is amazing. Half
their songs were new numbers
probably penned by Valenti, and
they were rockers, Valenti doing
the lead vocals, and the other half
were old numbers, the band
screeching "Mona", "Pride of
Man", and "Who Do You Love."
The Quicksilver Messenger Service
rides again!!!
The Dead On Top
Also that weekend at Fillmore
West, the good ol' Grateful Dead
blew more minds, as is their usual
custom. On their best nights the
Dead can cut any other rock'n'roll
band alive, and that night they

reached a level where they
couldn't possibly have gotten any
better.
The intense creativity of each
instrumentalist is what knocks
you over and picks you up again.
The Dead have been around for a
long time without too much
internal hassle—someone up there
must like us—and they serve as the
model for every other band to
follow
Benefit For Bail
But the Dead were recently
busted in New Orleans, and to
raise bail money there will be a
benefit February 23, at
Winterland starring (naturally) the
Dead, the Airplane, Quicksilver,
and Santana.
Meanwhile the San Francisco
scene is going strong, so spread
the word to your friends—rock'n'
roll is with us again.
