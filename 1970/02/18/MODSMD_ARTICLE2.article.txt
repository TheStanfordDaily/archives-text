# C-15 Students Want Charter Revision
## 
### 
Student members of the
Committee of Fifteen (CIS) have
asked their fellow students to sign
petitions requesting that CI 5
propose an amendments to the
Legislative and Judicial Charter
extending the Stanford Judicial
Council's (SJC) power.
The petitions ask that decisions
of the SJC be final, allowing only
for Presidential pardon, and that
the Council's jurisdiction be
expanded to the entire
community.
The CI 5, in Chairman Rick
Atkins' words, "has no defined
rules of operation. It has been the
chief arbitrative council for the
University: it recommends
solutions to all bi-partate and
tri-partate disputes. It also has the
sole power, according to the
Charter, to prepare for approval
amendments in the final form to
the Charter," at the instigation of
one of the three groups on
campus, the SJC, or SCLC.
He continued, "We students are
proposing a community judicial
system so that Stanford can solve
most of its community judicial
problems."
There are six students, six
faculty members, and three
administrators on the CIS.
Reasons For Request
There are two reasons for the
request, according to Atkins.
"First we would like to see the
Stanford Judicial Council become
a truly equitable body so that its
decisions remain final and are not
available to anyone else for
amendment, appending, or
translation."
Last spring, following the
Encina sit-in, the SJC decided that
some of the convicted students
were to be suspended or put on
probation. President Pitzer later
further defined the probation to
include ineligibility for residence
staff or membership on University
committees, and immediate
suspension for a further offense.
"Serious Offense"
After discussion with the SJC
during the summer, President
Pitzer added the word "serious"
before "offense."
The second reason is that "In
May 1968 the question of an all
encompassing judicial system with
equitable representation and final
decision authority was brought
before the whole community. As
a student, I feel we have not yet
achieved that goal."
Currently only students are
subject to the SJC's jurisdiction.
Copies of the petition are being
circulated or are available in the
ASSU office. Text of the
students' statement follows.
The Stanford Student Community:
We, the student members of the
Committee of Fifteen, would like the
followinq proposal brought before our
Committee for consideration, as

provided for in "The Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 (as amended
Winter Quarter 1968-69)", Section 111,
Article A, Paragraph l.a. This will
require approximately 650 signatures
of registered matriculated students in
petitions submitted to the Committee
of Fifteen.
REQUEST TO THE COMMITTEE OF
FIFTEEN:
The Committee of Fifteen is
requested to examine the prior
legislation concerning the SCLC and
the SJC and to recommend
amendments as may be agreed upon by
the Committee in order to achieve the
following purposes:
1) that all decisions of the
Stanford Judicial Council remain
final and without
amendmentâ€”with the exception
that the President of Stanford
University, as any other chief
executive, may exercise the power
of pardon.
2) to expand the power of the SJC
to consider cases of the whole
Stanford Community and
equitable means for bringing these
cases to the SJC.
3) to create a judicial council
commensurate with the
jurisdiction in "2" above.
