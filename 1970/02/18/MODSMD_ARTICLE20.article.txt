# Fun And Games
## Just Like Old Times 
### John Arthur 
Suddenly it was the fourth round and, as Angelo Dundee later put
it, "This guy landed a tremendous left hook and it turned the tide of
the battle." So true. Although Jimmy Ellis might have been the last
man to realize it, the tide was indeed turning and it was washing up
Jimmy Ellis.
Joe Frazier was quickly moving in with vicious hooks to the head
and the body and the end was nearing for Ellis. The crowd realized it
too and the roar began. They were up. At ringside Don Dunphy spat
out the words like a Gatling gun spits out bullets: Ellis is in his corner.
. .He goes down!. . .1 don't think he'll get up. . .It's at seven now and
he's on one knee. . . What guts!. . .He's up at the count of nine!. . .The
round's aimost over, by the way."
And so it went. Ellis went down again, but got up after the round
ended. Frazier didn't get the TKO until the fifth when Dundee, fully
aware that his boy was in the wrong ring, kept him from coming out.
The fight was over.
To hear it on the radio was to step into the past. The "Twilight
Zone" couldn't have done a better job of recreating big time boxing as
it once was and, probably, never shall be. It seems like ages since they
put a big fight on the radio, but then, it's been ages since there's been
a big fight.
Old Friends
Like ROTC, pro boxing is a game run by old men for young boys.
And on Monday night, all the old men were in Madison Square
Garden. It started with the pre-fight interviews. The Garden Biggies,
the men who run these things, were at the mike with Van Patrick: "I
think it'll be the best heavyweight fight in ten years," said Teddy
Brenner, the Garden matchmaker. Coming from Brenner, this is
hardly surprising. He's supposed to say it's going to be a slaughter?
Then they got around to the old retired champs. Willy Pep, putting
in a nasal-accented plug for his Jersey boxing clubs: "I think the
Garden ought to support these clubs. This is the way we develop
fighters." George Chuvalo, the Yukon's perennial contender,
predicting the winner. James J. Braddock. Joey Giardello. Rocky
Graziano.
As fight time neared the noise increased. In the ring George
Foreman, the flag-waver from the Olympics, was busy putting away
an ancient South American by the name of Gregorio Peralta in what
sounded like a pretty good bout. But at ringside, another old man,
Jim Bishop, was talking in his sleep about boxing's past: "This is the
fourth Madison Square Garden, y'know, Van. I remember the old
ones and the fighters. . .Those were clever men and first class fighters.
I don't think we're in that kind of a time now."
You can say that again.
Before the big fights they always interview the sports writers. This
is sometimes interesting. When Muhammed Ali, who was simply
Cassius Clay then, first fought Sonny Liston it was fascinating to hear
virtually every writer pick Liston. As Clay danced in the ring after
he'd won, singing "I'm so pretty!" to Howard Cosell and anyone else
within earshot, you could almost hear the scribes choking on their
own predictions.
Like the old champs, all the sages were hovering about the dying
flame on Monday night. In coarse and crusty voices they picked the
winner as Van Patrick called them forward: John P. Carmichael, from
Chicago, Dick Young, New York Daily News, Will Grimsley,
Associated Press. Twelve of the 23 writers interviewed picked Frazier.
The Fight Begins
The preliminary was over now and ancient Johnny Addie, the
Garden's venerable ring announcer was in there:". . .thewinnah. . .by
decision. . .Jawge FAWMAN!" A few commercials and a lot of noise
later, they were ready to go. You could hear referee Tony Perez:". .
.You boys know the rules. . ."
"And here's Don Dunphy!"
"Thank you Van Patrick. . ."
I don't know about the fighters, but Dunphy, a pro if there ever
was one, did a sensational job. Staccato-like, the words and phrases
tumbled out, giving the impression that it was a helluva fight. Round
Two, relishing: "We've got a dandy fight while it's lasting!" Round
Three, cautioning: "Ellis is fighting from instinct now! Frazier, of
course, could punch himself out." Foreseeing: "Frazier's turning it on
now - he knows how to fight!"
The round ended and the excitment was genuine. Jim Bishop, at
ringside, said, "There are three rows of cigar-smoking sports writers
here with their mouths open. None of 'em can believe it!"
Round Four. Dunphy, impressed: "Ellis is game. . .!"
"He goes down!"
Caught in the ring after it was over, Frazier was confident, relaxed.
"I just want to say hello to my family and all my friends in Miami and
South Carolina, and North Carolina," he told Dunphy.
Just like the old days. Saying "Hello" over the radio.
It was too much.
Suddenly it was the fourth round and, as Angelo Dundee later put
it, "This guy landed a tremendous left hook and it turned the tide of
the battle." So true. Although Jimmy Ellis might have been the last

think it'll be the best heavyweight fight in ten years," said Teddy
Brenner, the Garden matchmaker. Coming from Brenner, this is
hardly surprising. He's supposed to say it's going to be a slaughter?
Then they got around to the old retired champs. Willy Pep, putting
in a nasal-accented plug for his Jersey boxing clubs: "I think the
Garden ought to support these clubs. This is the way we develop
fighters." George Chuvalo, the Yukon's perennial contender,
predicting the winner. James J. Braddock. Joey Giardello. Rocky
Graziano.
As fight time neared the noise increased. In the ring George
Foreman, the flag-waver from the Olympics, was busy putting away
an ancient South American by the name of Gregorio Peralta in what
sounded like a pretty good bout. But at ringside, another old man,
Jim Bishop, was talking in his sleep about boxing's past: "This is the
fourth Madison Square Garden, y'know, Van. I remember the old
ones and the fighters. . .Those were clever men and first class fighters.
I don't think we're in that kind of a time now."
You can say that again.
Before the big fights they always interview the sports writers. This
is sometimes interesting. When Muhammed Ali, who was simply
Cassius Clay then, first fought Sonny Liston it was fascinating to hear
virtually every writer pick Liston. As Clay danced in the ring after
he'd won, singing "I'm so pretty!" to Howard Cosell and anyone else
within earshot, you could almost hear the scribes choking on their
own predictions.
Like the old champs, all the sages were hovering about the dying
flame on Monday night. In coarse and crusty voices they picked the
winner as Van Patrick called them forward: John P. Carmichael, from
Chicago, Dick Young, New York Daily News, Will Grimsley,
Associated Press. Twelve of the 23 writers interviewed picked Frazier.
The Fight Begins
The preliminary was over now and ancient Johnny Addie, the
Garden's venerable ring announcer was in there:". . .thewinnah. . .by
decision. . .Jawge FAWMAN!" A few commercials and a lot of noise
later, they were ready to go. You could hear referee Tony Perez:". .
.You boys know the rules. . ."
"And here's Don Dunphy!"
"Thank you Van Patrick. . ."
I don't know about the fighters, but Dunphy, a pro if there ever
was one, did a sensational job. Staccato-like, the words and phrases
tumbled out, giving the impression that it was a helluva fight. Round
Two, relishing: "We've got a dandy fight while it's lasting!" Round
Three, cautioning: "Ellis is fighting from instinct now! Frazier, of
course, could punch himself out." Foreseeing: "Frazier's turning it on
now - he knows how to fight!"
The round ended and the excitment was genuine. Jim Bishop, at
ringside, said, "There are three rows of cigar-smoking sports writers
here with their mouths open. None of 'em can believe it!"
Round Four. Dunphy, impressed: "Ellis is game. . .!"
"He goes down!"
Caught in the ring after it was over, Frazier was confident, relaxed.
"I just want to say hello to my family and all my friends in Miami and
South Carolina, and North Carolina," he told Dunphy.
Just like the old days. Saying "Hello" over the radio.
It was too much.
Suddenly it was the fourth round and, as Angelo Dundee later put
it, "This guy landed a tremendous left hook and it turned the tide of
the battle." So true. Although Jimmy Ellis might have been the last
man to realize it, the tide was indeed turning and it was washing up
Jimmy Ellis.
Joe Frazier was quickly moving in with vicious hooks to the head
and the body and the end was nearing for Ellis. The crowd realized it
too and the roar began. They were up. At ringside Don Dunphy spat
out the words like a Gatling gun spits out bullets: Ellis is in his corner.
. .He goes down!. . .1 don't think he'll get up. . .It's at seven now and
he's on one knee. . . What guts!. . .He's up at the count of nine!. . .The
round's aimost over, by the way."
And so it went. Ellis went down again, but got up after the round
ended. Frazier didn't get the TKO until the fifth when Dundee, fully
aware that his boy was in the wrong ring, kept him from coming out.
The fight was over.
To hear it on the radio was to step into the past. The "Twilight
Zone" couldn't have done a better job of recreating big time boxing as
it once was and, probably, never shall be. It seems like ages since they
put a big fight on the radio, but then, it's been ages since there's been
a big fight.

winner as Van Patrick called them forward: John P. Carmichael, from
Chicago, Dick Young, New York Daily News, Will Grimsley,
Associated Press. Twelve of the 23 writers interviewed picked Frazier.
The Fight Begins
The preliminary was over now and ancient Johnny Addie, the
Garden's venerable ring announcer was in there:". . .thewinnah. . .by
decision. . .Jawge FAWMAN!" A few commercials and a lot of noise
later, they were ready to go. You could hear referee Tony Perez:". .
.You boys know the rules. . ."
"And here's Don Dunphy!"
"Thank you Van Patrick. . ."
I don't know about the fighters, but Dunphy, a pro if there ever
was one, did a sensational job. Staccato-like, the words and phrases
tumbled out, giving the impression that it was a helluva fight. Round
Two, relishing: "We've got a dandy fight while it's lasting!" Round
Three, cautioning: "Ellis is fighting from instinct now! Frazier, of
course, could punch himself out." Foreseeing: "Frazier's turning it on
now - he knows how to fight!"
The round ended and the excitment was genuine. Jim Bishop, at
ringside, said, "There are three rows of cigar-smoking sports writers
here with their mouths open. None of 'em can believe it!"
Round Four. Dunphy, impressed: "Ellis is game. . .!"
"He goes down!"
Caught in the ring after it was over, Frazier was confident, relaxed.
"I just want to say hello to my family and all my friends in Miami and
South Carolina, and North Carolina," he told Dunphy.
Just like the old days. Saying "Hello" over the radio.
It was too much.
Suddenly it was the fourth round and, as Angelo Dundee later put
it, "This guy landed a tremendous left hook and it turned the tide of
the battle." So true. Although Jimmy Ellis might have been the last
man to realize it, the tide was indeed turning and it was washing up
Jimmy Ellis.
Joe Frazier was quickly moving in with vicious hooks to the head
and the body and the end was nearing for Ellis. The crowd realized it
too and the roar began. They were up. At ringside Don Dunphy spat
out the words like a Gatling gun spits out bullets: Ellis is in his corner.
. .He goes down!. . .1 don't think he'll get up. . .It's at seven now and
he's on one knee. . . What guts!. . .He's up at the count of nine!. . .The
round's aimost over, by the way."
And so it went. Ellis went down again, but got up after the round
ended. Frazier didn't get the TKO until the fifth when Dundee, fully
aware that his boy was in the wrong ring, kept him from coming out.
The fight was over.
To hear it on the radio was to step into the past. The "Twilight
Zone" couldn't have done a better job of recreating big time boxing as
it once was and, probably, never shall be. It seems like ages since they
put a big fight on the radio, but then, it's been ages since there's been
a big fight.
Old Friends
Like ROTC, pro boxing is a game run by old men for young boys.
And on Monday night, all the old men were in Madison Square
Garden. It started with the pre-fight interviews. The Garden Biggies,
the men who run these things, were at the mike with Van Patrick: "I
think it'll be the best heavyweight fight in ten years," said Teddy
Brenner, the Garden matchmaker. Coming from Brenner, this is
hardly surprising. He's supposed to say it's going to be a slaughter?
Then they got around to the old retired champs. Willy Pep, putting
in a nasal-accented plug for his Jersey boxing clubs: "I think the
Garden ought to support these clubs. This is the way we develop
fighters." George Chuvalo, the Yukon's perennial contender,
predicting the winner. James J. Braddock. Joey Giardello. Rocky
Graziano.
As fight time neared the noise increased. In the ring George
Foreman, the flag-waver from the Olympics, was busy putting away
an ancient South American by the name of Gregorio Peralta in what
sounded like a pretty good bout. But at ringside, another old man,
Jim Bishop, was talking in his sleep about boxing's past: "This is the
fourth Madison Square Garden, y'know, Van. I remember the old
ones and the fighters. . .Those were clever men and first class fighters.
I don't think we're in that kind of a time now."
You can say that again.
Before the big fights they always interview the sports writers. This
is sometimes interesting. When Muhammed Ali, who was simply
Cassius Clay then, first fought Sonny Liston it was fascinating to hear
virtually every writer pick Liston. As Clay danced in the ring after
he'd won, singing "I'm so pretty!" to Howard Cosell and anyone else
within earshot, you could almost hear the scribes choking on their
own predictions.
