# Star On The Market

### HALL DAILY 
Broadway Joe came to the farm
yesterday. Speaking before a
surprised business class, the
dashing quarterback opened by
joking, "I'm not usually out of
bed this early." It was 3 o'clock.
Asked if he really got $10,000
for shaving his Fu Manchu beard,
he countered, "No, I was paid
$500 for shaving my moustache
for a TV commercial in Kansas
City. Joe was paid $10,000. You
see, I'm his double and have been
for some time." Broadway Joe's
real name is Rich DiCenso, who
happened to have played
quarterback in college and high
school. But DiCenso has fooled
over 200,000 fans who have a
"Joe Namath" or "Broadway
Joe" autograph yet really haven't
ever met the celebrated Gotham
bachelor.
How easy has it been for
DiCenso to sell the American
public? The 5'11", broad-backed
double says "people just want to
believe it's really Joe. I haven't
hurt anyone."
How did he begin the charade?
Rich explains, "I went to
Bachelors 111 in New York. I was
always told I resembled Joe
Namath. After I walked in, girls
started crawling over the tables. I
thought my zipper was down.
Later, I sat and talked to Joe for
awhile."
When questioned about his
motives, DiCenso stated plainly,
"I've made between one and two
million dollars out of the act. I'll
get half-a-million for my book,
Give My Regrets To Broadway. "
Plus, he will sell the film rights
and star in the picture himself.
The book deals with DiCenso's

experiences as Broadway Joe. The
impersonator says the story
includes his strange identity crisis
during which he bought elevated
shoes, a Jets warm-up jacket, and
actually thought he was Joe
Namath.
One of the experiences Rich
related to his audience was his
visit to Vancouver. After being
interviewed by both newspapers
in that city and being exposed, he
was scheduled to lead a Mardi
Gras parade. "People showed up
just to throw tomatoes at me,"
snarled DiCehso half-seriously.
If he is constantly fooling
people and then telling them his
true identity afterwards (as he
always does), why hasn't the story
leaked out? "Generally, we hit
college campuses back east where
the book will sell." DiCenso

continues, "If a fooled reporter
gets aggressive, he looks ail the
more aggressive."
"It took me four and a half
months to perfect Joe's accent
and style. I met and talked to his
parents and old girl friends. Joe
seems to like the gimmick. It
keeps his name in the news and he
can stay home." And next month,
both DiCenso and the real
Broadway Joe will appear on the
"Tonight Show" for a comparison
contest.

started crawling over the tables. I
thought my zipper was down.
Later, I sat and talked to Joe for
awhile."
When questioned about his
motives, DiCenso stated plainly,
"I've made between one and two
million dollars out of the act. I'll
get half-a-million for my book,
Give My Regrets To Broadway. "
Plus, he will sell the film rights
and star in the picture himself.
The book deals with DiCenso's

experiences as Broadway Joe. The
impersonator says the story
includes his strange identity crisis
during which he bought elevated
shoes, a Jets warm-up jacket, and
actually thought he was Joe
Namath.
One of the experiences Rich
related to his audience was his
visit to Vancouver. After being
interviewed by both newspapers
in that city and being exposed, he
was scheduled to lead a Mardi
Gras parade. "People showed up
just to throw tomatoes at me,"
snarled DiCehso half-seriously.
If he is constantly fooling
people and then telling them his
true identity afterwards (as he
always does), why hasn't the story
leaked out? "Generally, we hit
college campuses back east where
the book will sell." DiCenso

continues, "If a fooled reporter
gets aggressive, he looks ail the
more aggressive."
"It took me four and a half
months to perfect Joe's accent
and style. I met and talked to his
parents and old girl friends. Joe
seems to like the gimmick. It
keeps his name in the news and he
can stay home." And next month,
both DiCenso and the real
Broadway Joe will appear on the
"Tonight Show" for a comparison
contest.

HAIR-RAISKR—Veteran third-year drum thumper l-arry Guldberg entertains dedicated Stanford basketball fans with his
distinctive rendition of the LSJ II spell-out, with help from the band. "Grunt", "Gorilla", or "Stump" (pick your own
appellation) wound up in the drink at the Yale swim meet, but has stayed 011 more solid ground at Maples Pavilion.
Broadway Joe came to the farm
yesterday. Speaking before a
surprised business class, the
dashing quarterback opened by
joking, "I'm not usually out of
bed this early." It was 3 o'clock.
Asked if he really got $10,000
for shaving his Fu Manchu beard,
he countered, "No, I was paid
$500 for shaving my moustache
for a TV commercial in Kansas
City. Joe was paid $10,000. You
see, I'm his double and have been
for some time." Broadway Joe's
real name is Rich DiCenso, who
happened to have played
quarterback in college and high
school. But DiCenso has fooled
over 200,000 fans who have a
"Joe Namath" or "Broadway
Joe" autograph yet really haven't
ever met the celebrated Gotham
bachelor.
How easy has it been for
DiCenso to sell the American
public? The 5'11", broad-backed
double says "people just want to
believe it's really Joe. I haven't
hurt anyone."
How did he begin the charade?
Rich explains, "I went to
Bachelors 111 in New York. I was
always told I resembled Joe
Namath. After I walked in, girls
started crawling over the tables. I
thought my zipper was down.
Later, I sat and talked to Joe for
awhile."
