The next big earthquake on the San Andreas
fault is more likely to occur south of Hollister
than in the San Francisco Bay Area, a Stanford
geophysicist has predicted.
"Regions like San Francisco, struck by a
'magnitude 8' earthquake, are now regions of low
stress buildup," Prof. Robert L. Kovach told
students and faculty at a lecture sponsored by the
School of Earth Sciences. "Active areas are the
potential sites for a great earthquake," he said,
pointing out that instruments on the fault near
Hollister show a continuous buildup of strain and
fault slippage.
Some geologists believe the slippage or "creep"
of approximately one centimeter per year acts as a
relief value, but Prof. Kobach disagrees. That
much creep is not enough to relieve the
accumulated strain, he believes. As to when the big
one will occur, he offers no predictions. We still
can't predict individual earthquakes with any
certainty, he said. On thy other hand we may be
able to modify them in areas where they seem
likely to come.
