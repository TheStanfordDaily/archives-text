# Money Squeeze Causes Cutback, Deficit, Pitzer Tells Stanford
## 
### ANNE EGGEBROTEN 
Stanford is "in the grip of a
financial crisis, President Kenneth
Pitzer said yesterday in his state
of the university address.
Speaking before about 200
students in Memorial Auditorium,
he disclosed a deficit for this year
of "between $1.5 to $2 million
and cuts of $2.5 million from the
present budget base over the next
four years.
Pitzer pointed to "massively
increasing the University's private
gift support" as the major answer
to the continued problem of
rapidly rising expenditures with
only a slowly rising income.
His speech was the kickoff to
the week-long Stanford University
Now (SUN) educational program
and fund drive.
A Little Heckling
A small group of hecklers
shouted demands for a
question-and-answer session as
Pitzer began his speech. They
were silenced by applause
supporting Pitzer.
He read a statement expressing
regret over the destruction last
night by a Stanford-led group in
Palo Alto. He also stated concern
for effective law enforcement as
well as continued freedom of
speech and assembly. (See related
story on this page )
"Undoubtably this incident will
be followed by demands to curtail
freedom of speech and assembly
on campus in hopes of restricting
similar forays in the future. To do
so, however, not only would be
unconstitutional; it also probably
would prove self-defeating by
broadening the base of
participation in potentially
disruptive acts," he said.
He outlined the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP) which
has a goal of a "balanced
budget —true income supporting
total operating expenditures—by
the academic year 1974-75."
The $2.5 million ruts will begin
with nearly $1 million in 1970-71
and the rest over the next three
years.
Major deductions will be from
the schools of Education,
Humanities and Sciences, and
Medicine; the Overseas Program;
and the student services area. The
same ratio of 3:1 in relative
financial support for academic
and non-academic activities will
be followed in making reductions.
Fund-Raising
Pitzer stressed the need for a
high-intensity fund-raising
campaign to off-set the dangers of
decreased quality of education.
"If our will to innovate were

blunted now by a lack of money
it would be tragic," he declared.
"I need mention only two things
of many that would suffer: one is
any substantial realization of the
SES proposals for enhancing
fresman level education; the other
is our potentially significant
contribution toward repairing our
damaged environment."
He maintained the necessity of
intellectual independence and
integrity despite pressure from
financial supporters.
"Our job is to bring about
understanding that there is
diversity and free clash of opinion
on the campus, that we believe
with Voltaire that 'Liberty of
thought is the life of the soul," he
declared.
He stated that the
administration has attempted to
align itself with "legitimately
based opinions and actions" of
students and faculty.
Actions Disavowed
"Conversely, we do not hesitate
to disavow insincere, disloyal, or
sloppily thought-out opinions and
violent, disruptive actions," he

stated, drawing scattered hissing
from the audience.
"Maybe the shoe fits, I don't
know,"he replied, continuing on
to read his statement on last
night's torch-light parade into
Palo Alto.
"We are feeling the crunch of
an upward spiral in'salaries, the
cost of goods, and other expenses
and a lessening rate of increases in
income," he explained.
The sharp drop in federally
sponsored research and
fellowships is the main reason for
decrease in income, aggravated by
Stanford's own decision to phase
out classified research, according
to Pitzer.
He emphasized that virtually
every other major independent
university in the country, as well
as state universities, is also feeling
this crisis.
'Legitimate Case'
Pitzer noted that he sees a
"legitimate case" for an optional
program of education in the
military science in a civilian
university, as well as for the

national military establishment as
a source of instructors. He
reaffirmed his position that these
temporary instructors should not
have a regular faculty status.
"The University is very
definitely interested in seeking
change in the so-called punitive
clauses," he said, "But the
University is not a party to these
contracts and therefore cannot
take direct action."
He defended Stanford's past
practices in use of land which
provides an annual income of $2
million, stressing that only about
10 percent of the land is now
under lease for commercial
purposes.
"I agree, however, that we must
now give more weight and
thought to environmental matters
and to the overall needs of the
total community before we
undertake any major new
activities on Stanford property
not already annexed and zoned,"
he said. "We must review our
long-range plans with a revised
scale of priorities in mind."

The $2.5 million ruts will begin
with nearly $1 million in 1970-71
and the rest over the next three
years.
Major deductions will be from
the schools of Education,
Humanities and Sciences, and
Medicine; the Overseas Program;
and the student services area. The
same ratio of 3:1 in relative
financial support for academic
and non-academic activities will
be followed in making reductions.
Fund-Raising
Pitzer stressed the need for a
high-intensity fund-raising
campaign to off-set the dangers of
decreased quality of education.
"If our will to innovate were

blunted now by a lack of money
it would be tragic," he declared.
"I need mention only two things
of many that would suffer: one is
any substantial realization of the
SES proposals for enhancing
fresman level education; the other
is our potentially significant
contribution toward repairing our
damaged environment."
He maintained the necessity of
intellectual independence and
integrity despite pressure from
financial supporters.
"Our job is to bring about
understanding that there is
diversity and free clash of opinion
on the campus, that we believe
with Voltaire that 'Liberty of
thought is the life of the soul," he
declared.
He stated that the
administration has attempted to
align itself with "legitimately
based opinions and actions" of
students and faculty.
Actions Disavowed
"Conversely, we do not hesitate
to disavow insincere, disloyal, or
sloppily thought-out opinions and
violent, disruptive actions," he

stated, drawing scattered hissing
from the audience.
"Maybe the shoe fits, I don't
know,"he replied, continuing on
to read his statement on last
night's torch-light parade into
Palo Alto.
"We are feeling the crunch of
an upward spiral in'salaries, the
cost of goods, and other expenses
and a lessening rate of increases in
income," he explained.
The sharp drop in federally
sponsored research and
fellowships is the main reason for
decrease in income, aggravated by
Stanford's own decision to phase
out classified research, according
to Pitzer.
He emphasized that virtually
every other major independent
university in the country, as well
as state universities, is also feeling
this crisis.
'Legitimate Case'
Pitzer noted that he sees a
"legitimate case" for an optional
program of education in the
military science in a civilian
university, as well as for the

national military establishment as
a source of instructors. He
reaffirmed his position that these
temporary instructors should not
have a regular faculty status.
"The University is very
definitely interested in seeking
change in the so-called punitive
clauses," he said, "But the
University is not a party to these
contracts and therefore cannot
take direct action."
He defended Stanford's past
practices in use of land which
provides an annual income of $2
million, stressing that only about
10 percent of the land is now
under lease for commercial
purposes.
"I agree, however, that we must
now give more weight and
thought to environmental matters
and to the overall needs of the
total community before we
undertake any major new
activities on Stanford property
not already annexed and zoned,"
he said. "We must review our
long-range plans with a revised
scale of priorities in mind."
Stanford is "in the grip of a
financial crisis, President Kenneth
Pitzer said yesterday in his state
of the university address.
Speaking before about 200
students in Memorial Auditorium,
he disclosed a deficit for this year
of "between $1.5 to $2 million
and cuts of $2.5 million from the
present budget base over the next
four years.
Pitzer pointed to "massively
increasing the University's private
gift support" as the major answer
to the continued problem of
rapidly rising expenditures with
only a slowly rising income.
His speech was the kickoff to
the week-long Stanford University
Now (SUN) educational program
and fund drive.
A Little Heckling
A small group of hecklers
shouted demands for a
question-and-answer session as
Pitzer began his speech. They
were silenced by applause
supporting Pitzer.
He read a statement expressing
regret over the destruction last
night by a Stanford-led group in
Palo Alto. He also stated concern
for effective law enforcement as
well as continued freedom of
speech and assembly. (See related
story on this page )
"Undoubtably this incident will
be followed by demands to curtail
freedom of speech and assembly
on campus in hopes of restricting
similar forays in the future. To do
so, however, not only would be
unconstitutional; it also probably
would prove self-defeating by
broadening the base of
participation in potentially
disruptive acts," he said.
He outlined the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP) which
has a goal of a "balanced
budget —true income supporting
total operating expenditures—by
the academic year 1974-75."
The $2.5 million ruts will begin
with nearly $1 million in 1970-71

night's torch-light parade into
Palo Alto.
"We are feeling the crunch of
an upward spiral in'salaries, the
cost of goods, and other expenses
and a lessening rate of increases in
income," he explained.
The sharp drop in federally
sponsored research and
fellowships is the main reason for
decrease in income, aggravated by
Stanford's own decision to phase
out classified research, according
to Pitzer.
He emphasized that virtually
every other major independent
university in the country, as well
as state universities, is also feeling
this crisis.
'Legitimate Case'
Pitzer noted that he sees a
"legitimate case" for an optional
program of education in the
military science in a civilian
university, as well as for the

national military establishment as
a source of instructors. He
reaffirmed his position that these
temporary instructors should not
have a regular faculty status.
"The University is very
definitely interested in seeking
change in the so-called punitive
clauses," he said, "But the
University is not a party to these
contracts and therefore cannot
take direct action."
He defended Stanford's past
practices in use of land which
provides an annual income of $2
million, stressing that only about
10 percent of the land is now
under lease for commercial
purposes.
"I agree, however, that we must
now give more weight and
thought to environmental matters
and to the overall needs of the
total community before we
undertake any major new
activities on Stanford property
not already annexed and zoned,"
he said. "We must review our
long-range plans with a revised
scale of priorities in mind."
Stanford is "in the grip of a
financial crisis, President Kenneth
Pitzer said yesterday in his state
of the university address.
Speaking before about 200
students in Memorial Auditorium,
he disclosed a deficit for this year
of "between $1.5 to $2 million
and cuts of $2.5 million from the
present budget base over the next
four years.
Pitzer pointed to "massively
increasing the University's private
gift support" as the major answer
to the continued problem of
rapidly rising expenditures with
only a slowly rising income.
His speech was the kickoff to
the week-long Stanford University
Now (SUN) educational program
and fund drive.
A Little Heckling
A small group of hecklers
shouted demands for a
question-and-answer session as
Pitzer began his speech. They
were silenced by applause
supporting Pitzer.
He read a statement expressing
regret over the destruction last
night by a Stanford-led group in
Palo Alto. He also stated concern
for effective law enforcement as
well as continued freedom of
speech and assembly. (See related
story on this page )
"Undoubtably this incident will
be followed by demands to curtail
freedom of speech and assembly
on campus in hopes of restricting
similar forays in the future. To do
so, however, not only would be
unconstitutional; it also probably
would prove self-defeating by
broadening the base of
participation in potentially
disruptive acts," he said.
He outlined the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP) which
has a goal of a "balanced
budget —true income supporting
total operating expenditures—by
the academic year 1974-75."
The $2.5 million ruts will begin
with nearly $1 million in 1970-71
and the rest over the next three
years.
Major deductions will be from
the schools of Education,
Humanities and Sciences, and
Medicine; the Overseas Program;
and the student services area. The
same ratio of 3:1 in relative
financial support for academic
and non-academic activities will
be followed in making reductions.
Fund-Raising
Pitzer stressed the need for a
high-intensity fund-raising
campaign to off-set the dangers of
decreased quality of education.
"If our will to innovate were

blunted now by a lack of money
it would be tragic," he declared.
"I need mention only two things
of many that would suffer: one is
any substantial realization of the
SES proposals for enhancing
fresman level education; the other
is our potentially significant
contribution toward repairing our
damaged environment."
He maintained the necessity of
intellectual independence and
integrity despite pressure from
financial supporters.
"Our job is to bring about
understanding that there is
diversity and free clash of opinion
on the campus, that we believe
with Voltaire that 'Liberty of
thought is the life of the soul," he
declared.
He stated that the
administration has attempted to
align itself with "legitimately
based opinions and actions" of
students and faculty.
Actions Disavowed
"Conversely, we do not hesitate
to disavow insincere, disloyal, or
sloppily thought-out opinions and
violent, disruptive actions," he

stated, drawing scattered hissing
from the audience.
"Maybe the shoe fits, I don't
know,"he replied, continuing on
to read his statement on last
night's torch-light parade into
Palo Alto.
"We are feeling the crunch of
an upward spiral in'salaries, the
cost of goods, and other expenses
and a lessening rate of increases in
