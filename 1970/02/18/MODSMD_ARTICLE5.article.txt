## Nixon Favors 18-Year-Old Vote 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A Justice
Department spokesman told a
Senate panel Tuesday that
President Nixon favors a
constitutional amendment
permitting 18-year-olds to vote in
national elections.
Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kleindienst testified that such an
amendment would be the best
solution to lowering the voting
age while still allowing the states a
free hand in setting the
qualifications for voters in state
and local elections.
Kleindienst rejected arguments
that younger persons cannot be
trusted to exercise the
responsibility of the ballot.
He said many of the persons
associated with campus rebellions
and disruptive political activism
are well past 21 and represent
only a small percentage of young
Americans.
"The vast majority-both in
school and at work-are living
responsible, constructive lives,"
Kleindienst said. "These mature
young people should not be
penalized for the actions of a
few."
Kleindienst said the Nixon
administration believes that giving
young persons the vote and a
responsible role in the political
process may eliminate what he
called a sense of frustration and
noninvolvement that has possibly
led to the irresponsible behavior
of a few.
Kleindienst testified before the
Senate subcommittee on
constitutional amendments which
has been taking testimony from
supporters and opponents of a
proposed to lower the voting age
in all elections.
Chicago Trial
CHICAGO (AP) - A U.S. Distri.!
Court jury deliberating on a
verdict for seven men charged
with riot conspiracy spent the
fourth day in chambers Tuesday
and the chief defense lawyer said

"it would be a miracle" if all were
acquitted.
William M. Kunstler, counsel
for the seven, said that at this
stage he believes "there will be
compromises."
"Some of the defendants will
be convicted, others will be
acquitted or the jury will hang
deadlock on all of them,"
Kunstler told newsmen after the
jury had been out more than 35
hours.
The jury of 10 women and two
men retired Saturday afternoon to
consider a verdict.
Considering the length of the
trial, all that the jury has heard
and seen and the judge's rulings,
"it would be a miracle" if all were
acquitted, Kunstler said
Kunstler said he was
considering going before Judge
Julius J. Hoffman with a request
that the jury be called to the
courtroom for a progress report.
"We would like to know if the
jury is deadlocked or if there is a
chance of their reaching a
verdict," he said.
Seattle Riot
SEATTLE (AP) - Hundreds of
young demonstrators protesting
contempt sentences given at the
Chicago riot conspiracy trial laid
siege to the federal court-house
here Tuesday, but wore dispersed
by police.
Officers said 6H were arrested
and two policemen and few
demonstrators were injured
slightly.
The crowd threw paint bombs
and broke windows in the
court-house and in a 1 ()-block area
of the Seattle business district.
Tear gas grenades which police

said were thrown by
demonstrators exploded when
part of the crowd rushed in the
courthouse.
Riot-equipped police used
nightsticks to disperse the crowd,
estimated by newsmen at 1,000
including spectators.
The demonstration was
organized by the Seattle
Liberation Front and the Young
Socialist Alliance, protesting jail
sentences imposed on seven
Chicago riot conspiracy
defendants and their two
attorneys for contempt of court.
A similar protest demonstration
in connection with the contempt
sentences was held Monday in
New York City.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A
police station bombing, second in
four days and latest in a 2'/2-year
series in the San Francisco area,
was tentatively linked by
investigators Tuesday with
demonstrations against the
"Chicago Seven" conspiracy trial.
Officially police reported "no
headway" in search for the
perpetrators and found no pattern
in the wide-ranging explosive
assaults.
One officer was critically
wounded and six others were
injured late Monday night when a
time bomb fillet! with steel staples
blasted Park Station, on the edge
of the Haight-Ashbury district.
Police put on a wanted bulletin
for an old pink minivan seen in
the vicinty. Thr city offered a
$5,000 reward.
Four hours after the bombing,
police said a sniper with a

telescope-sighted rifly took aim at
three officers in the downtown
Hall of Justice, some five miles
from the precinct station.
Before he could shoot, a
policeman outside fired his pistol,
and the sniper and a companion,
both described as white "hippie
types," fled in a car.
Tuesday morning across the
bay in Oakland a fused package of
24 sticks of explosive was found
against the wall at a paint plant.
Police said the spot evidently was
chosen at random.
In Berkeley, incendiary bombs
exploded Monday night without
damage at two department stores
during a demonstration by youths
against contempt sentences in the
Chicago Seven case.
Last Thursday midnight seven
officers were injured and three
cars were destroyed by time
bombs in the Berkeley police
station parking lot. Like the San
Francisco bomb, the blasts came
during the change of shift.*
Berkeley police Lt. Henry
Sanders said, "There is a similarity
in that both were shrapnel-type
bombs." But San Francisco Capt.
Charles Barca said, "This was
meant to disturb and disrupt;
that's all."

amendment would be the best
solution to lowering the voting
age while still allowing the states a
free hand in setting the
qualifications for voters in state
and local elections.
Kleindienst rejected arguments
that younger persons cannot be
trusted to exercise the

He said many of the persons
associated with campus rebellions
and disruptive political activism
are well past 21 and represent
only a small percentage of young

Kleindienst said the Nixon

young persons the vote and a

process may eliminate what he
called a sense of frustration and
noninvolvement that has possibly
led to the irresponsible behavior
of a few.
Kleindienst testified before the

Seattle Riot
SEATTLE (AP) - Hundreds of
young demonstrators protesting
contempt sentences given at the
Chicago riot conspiracy trial laid
siege to the federal court-house
here Tuesday, but wore dispersed
by police.
Officers said 6H were arrested
and two policemen and few
demonstrators were injured
slightly.
The crowd threw paint bombs
and broke windows in the
court-house and in a 1 ()-block area
of the Seattle business district.
Tear gas grenades which police

said were thrown by
demonstrators exploded when
part of the crowd rushed in the
courthouse.
Riot-equipped police used
nightsticks to disperse the crowd,
estimated by newsmen at 1,000
including spectators.
The demonstration was
organized by the Seattle
Liberation Front and the Young
Socialist Alliance, protesting jail
sentences imposed on seven
Chicago riot conspiracy
defendants and their two
attorneys for contempt of court.
A similar protest demonstration
in connection with the contempt
sentences was held Monday in
New York City.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A
police station bombing, second in
four days and latest in a 2'/2-year
series in the San Francisco area,
was tentatively linked by
investigators Tuesday with
demonstrations against the
"Chicago Seven" conspiracy trial.
Officially police reported "no
headway" in search for the
perpetrators and found no pattern
in the wide-ranging explosive
assaults.
One officer was critically
wounded and six others were
injured late Monday night when a
time bomb fillet! with steel staples
blasted Park Station, on the edge
of the Haight-Ashbury district.
Police put on a wanted bulletin
for an old pink minivan seen in
the vicinty. Thr city offered a
$5,000 reward.
Four hours after the bombing,
police said a sniper with a

telescope-sighted rifly took aim at
three officers in the downtown
Hall of Justice, some five miles
from the precinct station.
Before he could shoot, a
policeman outside fired his pistol,
and the sniper and a companion,
both described as white "hippie
types," fled in a car.
Tuesday morning across the
bay in Oakland a fused package of
24 sticks of explosive was found
against the wall at a paint plant.
Police said the spot evidently was
chosen at random.
In Berkeley, incendiary bombs
exploded Monday night without
damage at two department stores
during a demonstration by youths
against contempt sentences in the
Chicago Seven case.
Last Thursday midnight seven
officers were injured and three
cars were destroyed by time
bombs in the Berkeley police
station parking lot. Like the San
Francisco bomb, the blasts came
during the change of shift.*
Berkeley police Lt. Henry
Sanders said, "There is a similarity
in that both were shrapnel-type
bombs." But San Francisco Capt.
Charles Barca said, "This was
meant to disturb and disrupt;
that's all."

Court jury deliberating on a
verdict for seven men charged
with riot conspiracy spent the
fourth day in chambers Tuesday
and the chief defense lawyer said

"it would be a miracle" if all were
acquitted.
William M. Kunstler, counsel
for the seven, said that at this
stage he believes "there will be

Kunstler told newsmen after the
jury had been out more than 35
hours.
The jury of 10 women and two
men retired Saturday afternoon to

Considering the length of the

Kunstler said he was
considering going before Judge

that the jury be called to the
courtroom for a progress report.
"We would like to know if the

chance of their reaching a
verdict," he said.
Seattle Riot
SEATTLE (AP) - Hundreds of
young demonstrators protesting
contempt sentences given at the
Chicago riot conspiracy trial laid
siege to the federal court-house
here Tuesday, but wore dispersed
by police.
Officers said 6H were arrested
and two policemen and few
demonstrators were injured
slightly.
The crowd threw paint bombs
and broke windows in the
court-house and in a 1 ()-block area
of the Seattle business district.
Tear gas grenades which police

said were thrown by
demonstrators exploded when
part of the crowd rushed in the
courthouse.
Riot-equipped police used
nightsticks to disperse the crowd,
estimated by newsmen at 1,000
including spectators.
The demonstration was
organized by the Seattle
Liberation Front and the Young
Socialist Alliance, protesting jail
sentences imposed on seven
Chicago riot conspiracy
defendants and their two
attorneys for contempt of court.
A similar protest demonstration
in connection with the contempt
sentences was held Monday in
New York City.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A
police station bombing, second in
four days and latest in a 2'/2-year
series in the San Francisco area,
was tentatively linked by
investigators Tuesday with
demonstrations against the
"Chicago Seven" conspiracy trial.
Officially police reported "no
headway" in search for the
perpetrators and found no pattern
in the wide-ranging explosive
assaults.
One officer was critically
wounded and six others were
injured late Monday night when a
time bomb fillet! with steel staples
blasted Park Station, on the edge
of the Haight-Ashbury district.
Police put on a wanted bulletin
for an old pink minivan seen in
the vicinty. Thr city offered a
$5,000 reward.
Four hours after the bombing,
police said a sniper with a

telescope-sighted rifly took aim at
three officers in the downtown
Hall of Justice, some five miles
from the precinct station.
Before he could shoot, a
policeman outside fired his pistol,
and the sniper and a companion,
both described as white "hippie
types," fled in a car.
Tuesday morning across the
bay in Oakland a fused package of
24 sticks of explosive was found
against the wall at a paint plant.
Police said the spot evidently was
chosen at random.
In Berkeley, incendiary bombs
exploded Monday night without
damage at two department stores
during a demonstration by youths
against contempt sentences in the
Chicago Seven case.
Last Thursday midnight seven
officers were injured and three
cars were destroyed by time
bombs in the Berkeley police
station parking lot. Like the San
Francisco bomb, the blasts came
during the change of shift.*
Berkeley police Lt. Henry
Sanders said, "There is a similarity
in that both were shrapnel-type
bombs." But San Francisco Capt.
Charles Barca said, "This was
meant to disturb and disrupt;
that's all."
