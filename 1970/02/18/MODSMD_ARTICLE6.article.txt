# Financial Crisis: Now

Hy PAUL GRUSHKIN
It is no secret that the nation's
major colleges and universities are
experiencing a financial crisis.
Particularly hard-hit are the
private, independent institutions.
However, the solutions—which
must apparently come from both
the university and the federal
government —are at the moment
not much more than conjuecture.
It is easy to pinpoint funding
cutbacks that wound a
university's financial basis; it is
less easy to forsee measures that
will aid the multi-million dollar
enterprises.
Two needs must, of course, be
met: those of the student, so that
he can meet the ever-rising costs
of tuition, room and board (in
addition to his keeping pace with
the cost of living), and those of
the university, so it can handle the
rising costs of education, the
increasing costs of maintaining
facilities (and constructing new
ones) and meeting wages, and,
hopefully, close the gap between
income and thy larger money of
basic expenditure.
It is predicted, by such sources

as Stanford's Vice President for
Finance Kenneth Cuthbertson and
the 1968 Carnegie Commission on
Higher Education, which aid to
both the university and the
student must come from the
federal government. It will
probably be in the form of
increased cost-of-education
supplements to the colleges and
universities and expanded
student-aid programs.
What is presently the clearest in
the university financial picture is
the very gravity of the crisis. In a
published study by the
Association of Independent
California Colleges and
Universities (AICCU) which
includes Stanford and 50 others,
it was predicted that the gap
between educational costs and
projected income from all present
sources could grow to more than
$100 million each year. It was
estimated that this gap could
reach $56 million by 1973 and
$1 27 million by 1978.
Total Expenditure
Total institutional expenditure
in the United States, by all
institutions of higher learning,
rose from $5.2 billion to over $17
billion in the past decade.
Expenditures during the next five
years of rapid growth as estimated
by the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare will
probably reach $40 billion. Today
there are over six million students
enrolled in higher education.
Unless the gap between costs
and projected income is closed,
the AICCU survey continued, the
member institutions' growth rate
may be significantly reduced,
their educational quality may
decline, and, very likely, some of
the institutions may no longer
remain independent.
During the past decade, AICCU
institutions have expanded
enrollment by about 60 percent.
During the 1970's they hope to
expand enrollment at a rate of
four to five percent annually.
Combined with a seven percent
annual increase in costs, this
means their expenses will rise
about 1 2 percent each year.
Tuition will probably account
for about half their educational
income, as it has in recent years.
But, each increase in tuition

widens . the already great
differential between their charges
and those levied by public colleges
and universities.
Gifts and grants from private
individuals, foundations, and
corporations have been increasing
at a rate of 13 percent annually,
according to AICCU, and now
provide about one-fifth of
educational income. However, this
rate of increase probably will not
be sustained.
Crisis Apparent
The financial crisis is very
apparent at Stanford. Provost
Richard Lyman and President
Kenneth Pitzer told the Faculty
Senate in November, 1969, that
the University must face cuts in
existing programs and elimination
of some faculty and staff
positions.
"Some academic programs and
services will simply have to be
abandoned,'' declared
Cuthbertson in his 1969 Financial
Report, "in order to properly
finance those which are to
continue." He noted that the
1968-69 income failed to match
expenditures and the University
had to draw $600,000 from
reserves; this amount is expected
to double for 1969-70.
Overall, Stanford must prepare
for a $2.5 million belt-tightening
program over the next four years.
Its major impact—nearly $1
million—will be felt during
academic year 1970-71. The
be 11 - tightening will be
accompanied by intensified
efforts to increase private support
for the University and its
programs—such as the Stanford
University Now fund drive for
student aid. These efforts will
help to offset decreases in
growth —and in some cases
cutbacks to below current
funding—of federal and
foundation grants.
Biggest Factor
The biggest single factor,
according to Cuthbertson, slowing
the University's fiscal growth is a
projected decline in federally
sponsored research. This has fallen
from about $44 million in
1967-68 to $42 million last year,
$40 million in the current
academic year, and very likely as
low as $37 million in 1970-71.
