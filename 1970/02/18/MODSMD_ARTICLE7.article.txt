In response to two petitions,
the Academic Council will hold a
special meeting at 3:30 p.m.

decision by the faculty Senate on
Army ROTC.
The Senate approved a propositi
allowing Army ROTC Courses to
receive limited credit on a
one-year trial basis by a 23-13
vote on Jan. 22.
One petition turned in by
Harold Kahn, associate professor
of history, asks the Academic
Council to reject the Senate
decision. The other, signed by 2H
Senate members, including those
who voted with both the majority
and the minority on this issue,
asks that the entire faculty vote in
a mail ballot to accept or reject
the Senate decision.
The Council is composed of all
faculty members of a rank of
assistant professor and higher.
Information regarding the
meeting will be mailed to all
faculty members by Thursday.

according to Academic Secretary
11. Donald Winbigler. This will
include the recommendations
from the President's advisory
committee on ROTC affairs.
President Kenneth Pitzer's
comments to the Senate Steering
Committee, and the proposal
developed by the Army, among
other documents.
Prof. Winbigler said that the
present plan for the meeting is for
the Kahn resolution (submitted in
a letter accompanying the
petition) to be the primary
resolution with the Senate
proposal a substitute motion.
There will be discussion on both
and the meeting can take any
form its members want. Winbigler
feels that this organization will
lead to the "best and most
productive discussion."
The meeting time was set by
Winbigler following consultation
with the Senate Steering
Committee and President Pitzer
and in response to Prof. Kahn's
request that the meeting be
scheduled before March 5.
