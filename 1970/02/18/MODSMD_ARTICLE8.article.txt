# Subtle Fascism
## Threat To Suppress A Just Society 
### Steven Joseph 
The threat of fascism in
America today is very real and,
unfortunately, in many ways very
subtle. Julius Hoffman's current
travesty of justice in Chicago,
Nixon's proposed no-knock law,
the implicit (at least) agreement
among federal and local law
enforcement agencies
systematically to harass and
destroy the Black Panthers (and
remember: Judge Hoffman
instructed his jury that even
Implicit agreement constitutes
conspiracy), the de taclo

acceptance of phono-tapping as a
legitimate tool by all kinds of
federal and other "investigative"
agencies, are just a few of the
obvious examples of a growing
fascist threat. A more "mundane
example is the double standard of
law enforcement that exists and
flourishes today (why did you
grow up believing that cops were
your friends and were there to
help you, while your black and
chicano brother grew up knowing
that they were his enemy)
Insidious Tendencies
There are more subtle fascist

tendencies at work as well, though
it's hard to say whether they are
ultimately more or less insidious
than the obvious ones. In a letter
to last Friday's Daily (Feb. 13), a
grad student in materials science
stated that "the reality that our
country's businesses play the
game of supply and demand for
profit is nothing new, but it is the
people who set the demands, not
the corporations or government."
But is his claim correct?
People make their demands,
especially as consumers, from

among an existing range of
alternatives—and it is the
country's businesses which
determine what those alternatives
are. And the leaders of business
and industry are among the same
men who wield great influence at
diverse levels of government. An
example? Why, with the
technology and incredible
amounts of money available to us
don't we yet have a practical
alternative to the internal
combustion engine? After all,
everyone (even the businessmen
not just "the people") agrees that
pollution is a grave problem. And
why hasn't there been any
legislation against continuing
offshore oil drilling?The oil and
automobile companies know the
answer to both questions.
Economic Fascism
There is a more subtle kind of
economic fascism at work, as well
as the more obvious political kind.
There is also a form of
psychological fascism in this
country —the incredible power-trip
we are on—in which we have to be
first on the moon and first in
standard of living. Because of this,
we continue murdering Americans
and Vietnamese to protect
economic interests and to save
face.
Fascism, to me, means
repression, whether political,
economic, psychological,
moral—how much does it still
bother you to see pictures of
napalmed Vietnamese civilians?lf
human society has any meaning
beyond being no more than a
mutual agreement for defense and
profit by the power-wielders—and
I believe that it should—then it
must be to promote conditions in
which all the people both have
real material security and also are
able to explore freely their
individual human conditions.
Our society does not promote
these conditions. The forces in the
society which work against
promoting these conditions are
fascist.
The people who decry
pollution and shout about
oppression abroad, while at the
same time they promote the SST
and condone legalized oppression
at home, are fascists.
They are fascists because the
effects of their activities, whether
"intentional" or "unintentional,"
are to supress the development of
a truly just society—a society
whose goal is to help all its
members be free, not one whose
purpose appears the promotion of
the welfare or the few.
