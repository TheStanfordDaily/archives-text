# Architecture Program Cut
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
President Kenneth Pitzer's
announcement Tuesday that the
architecture program was being
moved from the Art Department
to the School of Engineering
caught a number of people by
surprise: notably the chairman of
Art and Architecture department
and the architecture students.
Contacted by the Daily
yesterday, ChairmanLorenz Eitner
maintained that he knew nothing
of any such decision and, if
indeed it had been made that,
"I've been shafted from behind
without hearing anything new
about it in several months."
Architecture students
themselves did not hear about it
until Tuesday night in a meeting
with Professor Victor Thompson,
chairman of the architecture
division of the department.
A delegation of twenty
architecture students met early
yesterday and marched to Pitzer's
office to protest the decision and
to make an appointment to
discuss it with him. Pitzer agreed
to meet with two student
representatives at 11 a.m. today,
if they would first meet with
Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
Robert Sears, at 10 a.m.
Exchange of Information
Leon Hartvickson and Ray
Rooker, president and
vice-president respectively of the
Stanford chapter of the American
Institute of Architects, said that
they would meet with both Sears
and Pitzer, and that hopefully
there would be a meaningful
exchange of information.
The architecture students are
upset about the decision for
several reasons. Basically the
students are concerned that what
they consider to be an excellent
individual oriented program will
be swallowed up by the "morass"
of the Engineering department.
The architecture program, if
placed in the Engineering School,
would be re-named Architecture
and Environmental Design, and
would be cut to approximately
half of the current program.
Earlier this year, Thompson
and Professor James Gere in civil
engineering worked out the
environmental design program. A
letter written by Thompson
states, "I view with regret the
University's decision to give up
the professional architecture
program. The program, begun in
1950 has fought for survival
against apathy and low budget. .
Tho total number of courses will
drop from 31 to 16.
"President Pitzer has indicated
that adequate financial support
for an accredited professional
architecture program will require
an endowment of about
$7,000,000. of new money
brought to the University for this
purpose. Until such a goal is
attained, the University is not
willing to continue the present
program."
An In-depth Continuation
The new program would be
offered as an in depth
continuation after the completion
of a basic background program in
engineering.
Eitner served on a committee in
1968 to study the future of
architecture at Stanford. At that
time he was the only member
which did not recommend that
the entire program be eliminated.
At this point Thompson reports
having been told "it's a lost cause.
. . and you ain't got a friend on
this campus." In reaction to this
dilemna Thompson began trying

to develop the program into
something which could be
continued by the University. He
says, "Of course I would rather
have a seperate department if that
were possible, but otherwise this
is our only other choice."
Attacks on Program
Attacks against the proposed
environmental design program
come from both students, faculty
and local architects. According to
John Kahl, director of the
Northern California chapter of the
American Institute of
Architecture, "I'm really upset.
This is another big mistake by
Stanford University; its the same
type of blindness as they have
shown before in ignoring the
environment."
According to Kahl, architecture
must be taught as part of the
school of Humanities and
Sciences. "Creation of a living
environment is not an engineering
job. What people need is a very
humanistic approach. Architects
rely on structural engineers, they
don't do engineering themselves."
Kahl adds that architecture
program would do better in any
humanities department rather
than engineering. "An architect is
constantly making moral
judgements, he'd do better off in
philosophy, or English than in
engineering. . .Just when
environmental quality has become
the number one national issue,
Stanford has taken the first step
toward ignoring it entirely," he
said.
The basis for the decision goes
back several years, according to
Dean Sears. For the past 20 years
since Thompson initiated the
architectural program, it has been
allowed to function pretty much
independently.
Low Budget
The main problem has been
that the budget has never been
substantial, at no point being
above the present $39,000 a year.
Most of the courses have been
taught by practicing architects
from the local community and
from San Francisco who donate
their time for a very nominal fee.
Thompson is the only full time
professor in the architecture
division.
The amount of money
necessary to enlarge the
department is still in question.
Sears, however, says that a
"substantial sum such as $30,000
to $50,000 a year more, "would
be enough to revitalize and
continue the present program.
According to the students, the
small size of the department has
been a major asset. Most had no
idea that financial pressure was
the basis for the decision, and felt
that money would be readily
available if needed.
Their position has been backed
up by several local architects.
One, John Worsley stated that he
felt sure that he could raise
$100,000 a year for the
department, if it were a

department, and that there would
be no question at all about the
$30,000 a year figure quoted by
Sears. According to Worsley, the
seven million dollar figure quoted
by Pitzer is "utter nonsense",
simply mentioned to discourage
any attempts at fund raising.
In 1961, Worsley came to the
University and offered to raise
money for the architecture
program, but he was discouraged
on the basis that it was not an
accredited department. Thompson
charges that addredidation would
hurt the department more than it
would help.
Quantitative Accredication
Students have commented that
accredidation is based upon
almost entirely quantitative
measurements, and to meet these
Stanford would have to expand
considerably and turn to a much
more structured program losing
most of what are now its best
features. Thompson asks, "How
can we become accredited if we
don't get money? It's a vicious
circle."
Architecture student Peggy
Leavell claims "the administration
is really down on the architecture
program." She theorized that
perhaps the outstanding record of
Stanford architecture graduates
from a program which lacks
accredidation and exists on a
pitifully small sum embarrasses
other departments.
Several students thought that
the division of Architecture was
just being dropped by the Art
department, and that it had no
where else to go. This was denied
by Art Department Chairman
Eitner.
As to the financial crisis, the
students felt that money was not
the problem at all. They said that
the program would exist on the
same amount of money in the
engineering department and yet
the program was being cut in half.
One student suggested that the 42
students enrolled in the division
are contributing a far larger share
of costs in the form of tuition
than they were getting back. Dean
of Engineering Joseph Pettit
refused to reveal how much
budget the new program would
receive or even acknowledge that
it had been transferred to the
engineering department.

announcement Tuesday that the
architecture program was being
moved from the Art Department
to the School of Engineering
caught a number of people by
surprise: notably the chairman of
Art and Architecture department
and the architecture students.
Contacted by the Daily
yesterday, ChairmanLorenz Eitner
maintained that he knew nothing
of any such decision and, if
indeed it had been made that,
"I've been shafted from behind
without hearing anything new
about it in several months."
Architecture students
themselves did not hear about it
until Tuesday night in a meeting
with Professor Victor Thompson,
chairman of the architecture
division of the department.
A delegation of twenty
architecture students met early
yesterday and marched to Pitzer's
office to protest the decision and
to make an appointment to
discuss it with him. Pitzer agreed
to meet with two student
representatives at 11 a.m. today,
if they would first meet with
Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
Robert Sears, at 10 a.m.
Exchange of Information
Leon Hartvickson and Ray
Rooker, president and
vice-president respectively of the
Stanford chapter of the American
Institute of Architects, said that
they would meet with both Sears
and Pitzer, and that hopefully
there would be a meaningful
exchange of information.
The architecture students are
upset about the decision for
several reasons. Basically the
students are concerned that what
they consider to be an excellent
individual oriented program will
be swallowed up by the "morass"
of the Engineering department.
The architecture program, if
placed in the Engineering School,
would be re-named Architecture
and Environmental Design, and
would be cut to approximately
half of the current program.
Earlier this year, Thompson
and Professor James Gere in civil
engineering worked out the
environmental design program. A
letter written by Thompson
states, "I view with regret the
University's decision to give up
the professional architecture
program. The program, begun in
1950 has fought for survival
against apathy and low budget. .
Tho total number of courses will
drop from 31 to 16.
"President Pitzer has indicated
that adequate financial support
for an accredited professional
architecture program will require
an endowment of about
$7,000,000. of new money
brought to the University for this
purpose. Until such a goal is
attained, the University is not
willing to continue the present
program."
An In-depth Continuation
The new program would be
offered as an in depth
continuation after the completion
of a basic background program in
engineering.
Eitner served on a committee in
1968 to study the future of
architecture at Stanford. At that
time he was the only member
which did not recommend that
the entire program be eliminated.
At this point Thompson reports
having been told "it's a lost cause.
. . and you ain't got a friend on
this campus." In reaction to this
dilemna Thompson began trying

to develop the program into
something which could be
continued by the University. He
says, "Of course I would rather
have a seperate department if that
were possible, but otherwise this
is our only other choice."
Attacks on Program
Attacks against the proposed
environmental design program
come from both students, faculty
and local architects. According to
John Kahl, director of the
Northern California chapter of the
American Institute of
Architecture, "I'm really upset.
This is another big mistake by
Stanford University; its the same
type of blindness as they have
shown before in ignoring the
environment."
According to Kahl, architecture
must be taught as part of the
school of Humanities and
Sciences. "Creation of a living
environment is not an engineering
job. What people need is a very
humanistic approach. Architects
rely on structural engineers, they
don't do engineering themselves."
Kahl adds that architecture
program would do better in any
humanities department rather
than engineering. "An architect is
constantly making moral
judgements, he'd do better off in
philosophy, or English than in
engineering. . .Just when
environmental quality has become
the number one national issue,
Stanford has taken the first step
toward ignoring it entirely," he
said.
The basis for the decision goes
back several years, according to
Dean Sears. For the past 20 years
since Thompson initiated the
architectural program, it has been
allowed to function pretty much
independently.
Low Budget
The main problem has been
that the budget has never been
substantial, at no point being
above the present $39,000 a year.
Most of the courses have been
taught by practicing architects
from the local community and
from San Francisco who donate
their time for a very nominal fee.
Thompson is the only full time
professor in the architecture
division.
The amount of money
necessary to enlarge the
department is still in question.
Sears, however, says that a
"substantial sum such as $30,000
to $50,000 a year more, "would
be enough to revitalize and
continue the present program.
According to the students, the
small size of the department has
been a major asset. Most had no
idea that financial pressure was
the basis for the decision, and felt
that money would be readily
available if needed.
Their position has been backed
up by several local architects.
One, John Worsley stated that he
felt sure that he could raise
$100,000 a year for the
department, if it were a

department, and that there would
be no question at all about the
$30,000 a year figure quoted by
Sears. According to Worsley, the
seven million dollar figure quoted
by Pitzer is "utter nonsense",
simply mentioned to discourage
any attempts at fund raising.
In 1961, Worsley came to the
University and offered to raise
money for the architecture
program, but he was discouraged
on the basis that it was not an
accredited department. Thompson
charges that addredidation would
hurt the department more than it
would help.
Quantitative Accredication
Students have commented that
accredidation is based upon
almost entirely quantitative
measurements, and to meet these
Stanford would have to expand
considerably and turn to a much
more structured program losing
most of what are now its best
features. Thompson asks, "How
can we become accredited if we
don't get money? It's a vicious
circle."
Architecture student Peggy
Leavell claims "the administration
is really down on the architecture
program." She theorized that
perhaps the outstanding record of
Stanford architecture graduates
from a program which lacks
accredidation and exists on a
pitifully small sum embarrasses
other departments.
Several students thought that
the division of Architecture was
just being dropped by the Art
department, and that it had no
where else to go. This was denied
by Art Department Chairman
Eitner.
As to the financial crisis, the
students felt that money was not
the problem at all. They said that
the program would exist on the
same amount of money in the
engineering department and yet
the program was being cut in half.
One student suggested that the 42
students enrolled in the division
are contributing a far larger share
of costs in the form of tuition
than they were getting back. Dean
of Engineering Joseph Pettit
refused to reveal how much
budget the new program would
receive or even acknowledge that
it had been transferred to the
engineering department.

announcement Tuesday that the
architecture program was being
moved from the Art Department
to the School of Engineering
caught a number of people by
surprise: notably the chairman of
Art and Architecture department
and the architecture students.
Contacted by the Daily
yesterday, ChairmanLorenz Eitner
maintained that he knew nothing
of any such decision and, if
indeed it had been made that,
"I've been shafted from behind
without hearing anything new
about it in several months."
Architecture students
themselves did not hear about it
until Tuesday night in a meeting
with Professor Victor Thompson,
chairman of the architecture
division of the department.
A delegation of twenty
architecture students met early
yesterday and marched to Pitzer's
office to protest the decision and
to make an appointment to
discuss it with him. Pitzer agreed
to meet with two student
representatives at 11 a.m. today,
if they would first meet with
Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
Robert Sears, at 10 a.m.
Exchange of Information
Leon Hartvickson and Ray
Rooker, president and
vice-president respectively of the
Stanford chapter of the American
Institute of Architects, said that
they would meet with both Sears
and Pitzer, and that hopefully
there would be a meaningful
exchange of information.
The architecture students are
upset about the decision for
several reasons. Basically the
students are concerned that what
they consider to be an excellent
individual oriented program will
be swallowed up by the "morass"
of the Engineering department.
The architecture program, if
placed in the Engineering School,
would be re-named Architecture
and Environmental Design, and
would be cut to approximately
half of the current program.
Earlier this year, Thompson
and Professor James Gere in civil
engineering worked out the
environmental design program. A
letter written by Thompson
states, "I view with regret the
University's decision to give up
the professional architecture
program. The program, begun in
1950 has fought for survival
against apathy and low budget. .
Tho total number of courses will
drop from 31 to 16.
"President Pitzer has indicated
that adequate financial support
for an accredited professional
architecture program will require
an endowment of about
$7,000,000. of new money
brought to the University for this
purpose. Until such a goal is
attained, the University is not
willing to continue the present
program."
An In-depth Continuation
The new program would be
offered as an in depth
continuation after the completion
of a basic background program in
engineering.
Eitner served on a committee in
1968 to study the future of
architecture at Stanford. At that
time he was the only member
which did not recommend that
the entire program be eliminated.
At this point Thompson reports
having been told "it's a lost cause.
. . and you ain't got a friend on
this campus." In reaction to this
dilemna Thompson began trying

to develop the program into
something which could be
continued by the University. He
says, "Of course I would rather
have a seperate department if that
were possible, but otherwise this
is our only other choice."
Attacks on Program
Attacks against the proposed
environmental design program
come from both students, faculty
and local architects. According to
John Kahl, director of the
Northern California chapter of the
American Institute of
Architecture, "I'm really upset.
This is another big mistake by
Stanford University; its the same
type of blindness as they have
shown before in ignoring the
environment."
According to Kahl, architecture
must be taught as part of the
school of Humanities and
Sciences. "Creation of a living
environment is not an engineering
job. What people need is a very
humanistic approach. Architects
rely on structural engineers, they
don't do engineering themselves."
Kahl adds that architecture
program would do better in any
humanities department rather
than engineering. "An architect is
constantly making moral
judgements, he'd do better off in
philosophy, or English than in
engineering. . .Just when
environmental quality has become
the number one national issue,
Stanford has taken the first step
toward ignoring it entirely," he
said.
The basis for the decision goes
back several years, according to
Dean Sears. For the past 20 years
since Thompson initiated the
architectural program, it has been
allowed to function pretty much
independently.
Low Budget
The main problem has been
that the budget has never been
substantial, at no point being
above the present $39,000 a year.
Most of the courses have been
taught by practicing architects
from the local community and
from San Francisco who donate
their time for a very nominal fee.
Thompson is the only full time
professor in the architecture
division.
The amount of money
necessary to enlarge the
department is still in question.
Sears, however, says that a
"substantial sum such as $30,000
to $50,000 a year more, "would
be enough to revitalize and
continue the present program.
According to the students, the
small size of the department has
been a major asset. Most had no
idea that financial pressure was
the basis for the decision, and felt
that money would be readily
available if needed.
Their position has been backed
up by several local architects.
One, John Worsley stated that he
felt sure that he could raise
$100,000 a year for the
department, if it were a

department, and that there would
be no question at all about the
$30,000 a year figure quoted by
Sears. According to Worsley, the
seven million dollar figure quoted
by Pitzer is "utter nonsense",
simply mentioned to discourage
any attempts at fund raising.
In 1961, Worsley came to the
University and offered to raise
money for the architecture
program, but he was discouraged
on the basis that it was not an
accredited department. Thompson
charges that addredidation would
hurt the department more than it
would help.
Quantitative Accredication
Students have commented that
accredidation is based upon
almost entirely quantitative
measurements, and to meet these
Stanford would have to expand
considerably and turn to a much
more structured program losing
most of what are now its best
features. Thompson asks, "How
can we become accredited if we
don't get money? It's a vicious
circle."
Architecture student Peggy
Leavell claims "the administration
is really down on the architecture
program." She theorized that
perhaps the outstanding record of
Stanford architecture graduates
from a program which lacks
accredidation and exists on a
pitifully small sum embarrasses
other departments.
Several students thought that
the division of Architecture was
just being dropped by the Art
department, and that it had no
where else to go. This was denied
by Art Department Chairman
Eitner.
As to the financial crisis, the
students felt that money was not
the problem at all. They said that
the program would exist on the
same amount of money in the
engineering department and yet
the program was being cut in half.
One student suggested that the 42
students enrolled in the division
are contributing a far larger share
of costs in the form of tuition
than they were getting back. Dean
of Engineering Joseph Pettit
refused to reveal how much
budget the new program would
receive or even acknowledge that
it had been transferred to the
engineering department.

announcement Tuesday that the
architecture program was being
moved from the Art Department
to the School of Engineering
caught a number of people by
surprise: notably the chairman of
Art and Architecture department
and the architecture students.
Contacted by the Daily
yesterday, ChairmanLorenz Eitner
maintained that he knew nothing
of any such decision and, if
indeed it had been made that,
"I've been shafted from behind
without hearing anything new
about it in several months."
Architecture students
themselves did not hear about it
until Tuesday night in a meeting
with Professor Victor Thompson,
chairman of the architecture
division of the department.
A delegation of twenty
architecture students met early
yesterday and marched to Pitzer's
office to protest the decision and
to make an appointment to
discuss it with him. Pitzer agreed
to meet with two student
representatives at 11 a.m. today,
if they would first meet with
Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
Robert Sears, at 10 a.m.
Exchange of Information
Leon Hartvickson and Ray
Rooker, president and
vice-president respectively of the
Stanford chapter of the American
Institute of Architects, said that
they would meet with both Sears
and Pitzer, and that hopefully
there would be a meaningful
exchange of information.
The architecture students are
upset about the decision for
several reasons. Basically the
students are concerned that what
they consider to be an excellent
individual oriented program will
be swallowed up by the "morass"
of the Engineering department.
The architecture program, if
placed in the Engineering School,
would be re-named Architecture
and Environmental Design, and
would be cut to approximately
half of the current program.
Earlier this year, Thompson
and Professor James Gere in civil
engineering worked out the
environmental design program. A
letter written by Thompson
states, "I view with regret the
University's decision to give up
the professional architecture
program. The program, begun in
1950 has fought for survival
against apathy and low budget. .
Tho total number of courses will
drop from 31 to 16.
"President Pitzer has indicated
that adequate financial support
for an accredited professional
architecture program will require
an endowment of about
$7,000,000. of new money
brought to the University for this
purpose. Until such a goal is
attained, the University is not
willing to continue the present
program."
An In-depth Continuation
The new program would be
offered as an in depth
continuation after the completion
of a basic background program in
engineering.
Eitner served on a committee in
1968 to study the future of
architecture at Stanford. At that
time he was the only member
which did not recommend that
the entire program be eliminated.
At this point Thompson reports
having been told "it's a lost cause.
. . and you ain't got a friend on
this campus." In reaction to this
dilemna Thompson began trying

to develop the program into
something which could be
continued by the University. He
says, "Of course I would rather
have a seperate department if that
were possible, but otherwise this
is our only other choice."
Attacks on Program
Attacks against the proposed
environmental design program
come from both students, faculty
and local architects. According to
John Kahl, director of the
Northern California chapter of the
American Institute of
Architecture, "I'm really upset.
This is another big mistake by
Stanford University; its the same
type of blindness as they have
shown before in ignoring the
environment."
According to Kahl, architecture
must be taught as part of the
school of Humanities and
Sciences. "Creation of a living
environment is not an engineering
job. What people need is a very
humanistic approach. Architects
rely on structural engineers, they
don't do engineering themselves."
Kahl adds that architecture
program would do better in any
humanities department rather
than engineering. "An architect is
constantly making moral
judgements, he'd do better off in
philosophy, or English than in
engineering. . .Just when
environmental quality has become
the number one national issue,
Stanford has taken the first step
toward ignoring it entirely," he
said.
The basis for the decision goes
back several years, according to
Dean Sears. For the past 20 years
since Thompson initiated the
architectural program, it has been
allowed to function pretty much
independently.
Low Budget
The main problem has been
that the budget has never been
substantial, at no point being
above the present $39,000 a year.
Most of the courses have been
taught by practicing architects
from the local community and
from San Francisco who donate
their time for a very nominal fee.
Thompson is the only full time
professor in the architecture
division.
The amount of money
necessary to enlarge the
department is still in question.
Sears, however, says that a
"substantial sum such as $30,000
to $50,000 a year more, "would
be enough to revitalize and
continue the present program.
According to the students, the
small size of the department has
been a major asset. Most had no
idea that financial pressure was
the basis for the decision, and felt
that money would be readily
available if needed.
Their position has been backed
up by several local architects.
One, John Worsley stated that he
felt sure that he could raise
$100,000 a year for the
department, if it were a

department, and that there would
be no question at all about the
$30,000 a year figure quoted by
Sears. According to Worsley, the
seven million dollar figure quoted
by Pitzer is "utter nonsense",
simply mentioned to discourage
any attempts at fund raising.
In 1961, Worsley came to the
University and offered to raise
money for the architecture
program, but he was discouraged
on the basis that it was not an
accredited department. Thompson
charges that addredidation would
hurt the department more than it
would help.
Quantitative Accredication
Students have commented that
accredidation is based upon
almost entirely quantitative
measurements, and to meet these
Stanford would have to expand
considerably and turn to a much
more structured program losing
most of what are now its best
features. Thompson asks, "How
can we become accredited if we
don't get money? It's a vicious
circle."
Architecture student Peggy
Leavell claims "the administration
is really down on the architecture
program." She theorized that
perhaps the outstanding record of
Stanford architecture graduates
from a program which lacks
accredidation and exists on a
pitifully small sum embarrasses
other departments.
Several students thought that
the division of Architecture was
just being dropped by the Art
department, and that it had no
where else to go. This was denied
by Art Department Chairman
Eitner.
As to the financial crisis, the
students felt that money was not
the problem at all. They said that
the program would exist on the
same amount of money in the
engineering department and yet
the program was being cut in half.
One student suggested that the 42
students enrolled in the division
are contributing a far larger share
of costs in the form of tuition
than they were getting back. Dean
of Engineering Joseph Pettit
refused to reveal how much
budget the new program would
receive or even acknowledge that
it had been transferred to the
engineering department.
