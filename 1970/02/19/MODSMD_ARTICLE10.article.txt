## America A Pollution-Tolerant Society? 
### Doug Graham 
Several recent developments
point up growing awareness and
simultaneous acceptance of
lowering quality in the
environment on the part of the
American public. Harried
consumers suffering from the
congestion and pollution of
modern urban living are turning in
increasing numbers to various
appliances in an attempt to curb
intrusive pollution in their homes
and other internal human
environments.
One such gadget that is
reportedly selling well is produced
by Guidance Technology, Inc., of
Santa Monica, California. An
electrostatic precipitator, similar
to those used on industrial
smokestacks to remove pollutants,
its 15,000-volt electric field
charges the pollutant particles and
accelerates them into a disposable
activated charcoal filter screen.
The small, silent, 60-watt unit is
capable cf processing 250-300
cubic feet of air per minute. The
screenis 99.8 percent efficient in
trapping light-scattering smog
particles. It will trap particles as
small as 0.1 microns (a micron is
approximately 1/25,000 th of an
inch), such as dust, tobacco
smoke, bacteria, and smog
particles. By comparison, ordinary

mechanical filters can only trap
particles down to 5 microns, or 50
times the diameter.
Cocktail Parties
It sounds like it would be just
the thing for a cocktail party in
Los Angeles. There must be quite
a demand for home air cleaners;
the company estimates a $50
million market in the early *70's.
This gadget perhaps could solve
the problem of heavy smokerers
in public places, especially closed
public conveyances. Legislation to
restrict smoking aboard public
transportation has been
introduced into Congress by
Senator Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.)
and Rep. Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.).
Similar proposals are pending in
the legislatures of at least two
states, Illinois and Indiana. New
York State Senator Edward Speno
likewise intends to seek legislation
curbing smoking on busses and
trains and in places of public
assembly. Ralph Nader, the
consumer crusader, has asked the
Interstate Commerce Commission
to ban cigarette, cigar and pipe
smoking on interstate busses.
These efforts are all attempts to
control internally-generated
pollution and may be unnecessary
if electrostatic air cleaners could
effectively purify the air.
Slcepmate
Another type of gadget deals
with intrusive noise pollution.
These machines, such as
"Sleepmate" ($14.45) or "Sleep
Sound" ($19.50) introduce
"sound masking" to reduce the
noticeable difference in levels
between steady background noise
and the periodic or irregular
louder noises that disturb people
more.
The noisemakers produce
steady, soothing sounds
resembling wind in the trees,
ocean surf, or rain on a shingle
roof. This principle is being put to
use in factories, offices and stores
as well as in homes. The extreme
is represented by the "sound
chair," an egg-shaped contraption
lined with six stereophonic
speakers. A spokesman likens the
experience of sitting in this chair
to "... a return to the womb."
Ear Problems
Some medical authorities are
warning the public that the

sound-masking gadgetry may only
be making a bad problem worse.
Dr. Samuel Rosen, emeritus
professor of ear surgery at Mt.
Sinai school of Medicine in New
York, said recently in an interview
with the Wall Street Journal; "The
only solution to the noise
problem is that the noise has to be
diminished at the source of the
noise. If the noise comes in and
you don't notice it, the effect on
the blood vessels is just the same.
Your heart rate and blood
pressure go up. Unlike your eyes,
your ears have no lids and the
effect of noise on the blood
vessels is the same if you're asleep
or awake." Dr. Rosen has
performed research on a remote
African tribe that suggests that

urban noise levels may have a
direct effect on the incidence of
high blood pressure and heart
disease.
A Gas Mask Society?
While electrostatic air-cleaners
and (perhaps) sound-masking
devices may provide read benefits
in improving the internal
environment in public places, it
seems to us that there are real
dangers involved if they are
widely accepted by consumers for
home use. It would be completely
in the tradition of our
individualistic society to attempt
to solve the problems of pollution
on an individualistic basis, rather
than pay the higher prices and
taxes necessary to lick the
problem at its source.

Without straining credibility
too far, one could envision the
Los Angeles commuter of 1984
stepping from his plastic-sealed
clean-air home in thy morning,
snapping on his gas mask for his
brisk walk to his car (an air-tight,
air-conditioned, electronically
air-cleaned 1983 Buick) and
driving off to work along the
second deck of the Pasadena
Freeway, guided through the
gloom by his Buick-o-matic
anti-smog radar set; and upon
arrival, entering his office through
a double airlock. All this while
wearing his eye-glass and
ear-button "personal sound
soother" so as not to have to
listen to the roar, clank and crash
of the activity around him.
