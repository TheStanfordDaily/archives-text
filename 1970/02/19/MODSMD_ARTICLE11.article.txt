# Double-Crossed Taxpayer
## California Water Plan 
### Andy Smith 
The current controversy over
the California Water Plan, in
particular the Peripheral Canal,
which is meant to divert
Sacramento River water to
Southern California, is somewhat
similar to the situation which
existed in the beginning of this
century. One might wonder about
the zeal of public officials in their
attempts to sell the canal to the
taxpayers, in light of a nefarious,
but little publicized scheme which
occurred in this earlier period.
With the help of the chief
engineer of the U.S. Reclamation
Service (who was later employed
by the city), city officials were
able to buy up land surrounding
the Owens River. An aqueduct
was then proposed to bring water
into the city. Just before the $25
million bond issue needed for
financing was voted upon, tons of
water were dumped into the city
sewer system, creating the
impression of a water shortage.
Not surprisingly, the panicky
citizens voted in the bond issue.
Prices Soar
Meanwhile, however, the
project's sponsors had bought up
land at cheap ($5-20/ acre) prices
in the San Fernando Valley, north
of the city. They then

double-crossed the taxpayers of
Los Angeles by building the
aqueduct only as far south as this
Valley. With ample irrigation in
the offing, San Fernando Valley
land prices soared as high as
$1000/ acre, and by then selling
out, these men made a neat $100
million profit in toto.
While all this was going on, the
displaced Owens Valley residents,
led by two bankers, attempted to
fight back. However, the
aqueduct's sponsors were able to
smash this resistance movement
by bringing about the indictment
and conviction of the two leaders,
who were carrying overdue
mortgages in the process of
financing the Owens residents'
campaign.
Others Prevented
Earlier, Los Angeles officials
had managed to prevent other
people from moving into the
Owens Valley, by getting the
Secretary of Interior to declare
the area a national forest, despite
the fact that the land involved lay
in a rather barren area. The
out ma no u v e r e d citizens
acknowledged their defeat in
1927, in a city-wide newspaper
advertisement reminiscent of
gladiator days: "We, the residents

of uwens Kiver Valley, being
about to die, salute you!" Their
placement of this ad in the L.A.
newspapers was the final irony,
because the latter, led by the
powerful L.A. Times, had
consistently hidden from the city
public the nature of the events
actually occurring, and to this day
few L.A. residents have heard this
story.
Tragic Results
The results of these clever
manipulations were thus the
following: 1) the residents of the
Owens River Valley were
uprooted from their homes; 2) the
citizens of Los Angeles were $25
million poorer, and still without
water; 3) a few wealthy, powerful
men became wealthier and more
powerful.
In light of this historical series
of events, it is very interesting
that officials of the Los Angeles
area, which contains almost half
of the state's population, but only
6 percent of its land and .06
