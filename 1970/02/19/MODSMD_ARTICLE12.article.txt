The TIM WHITE Scandal
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the roommates of the now
infamous Tim White, we must
protest against the base libel
carried out against him in the
Classified Ads Department of the
Daily on February 16.
We can testify that Mr. White is
a perfectly articulate fellow who
would never have made the
statements attributed to him.
These inarticulate mumblings
("Puke. . .Who invented my life. .
.Why does God hate me") are in
fact the characteristic mode of

speech of Mr. James Baer,
Classified Ads Manager of the
Daily and a neighbor
(unfortunately) of ours in
Manzanita Park. Besides lowering
the property values in a formerly
nice neighborhood, Mr. Baer
seems good for little else but to
malign our roommate and friend.
It is time to reveal the whole
sordid story of Mr. Baer's attempt
to expand interest in the
Classified Ads and create his own
empire out of them. His
instrument for doing so has been
the unfortunate Mr. White, an

unwilling pawn in Mr. Baer's
vicious power play. We demand to
know the extent of the monetary
commission Mr. Baer has received
from classified ads brought in by
his attack on our friend.
We will not rest until Mr. Baer
retracts his campaign and
acknowledges his own authorship
of a now notorious "Statement of
February 16" and his directorship
of the entire sorry campaign of
vilification.
The Garner Report
Editor, THE DAILY:
After the Happy Birthday Huey
Party Monday night, I was one of
several hundred who marched
down El Camino to the Bank of
America building on the corner of
California Avenue to protest the
persecution of the conspiracy
seven.
As the Daily reported I was the
one person arrested and released
early the morning of the 17th.
The Daily reported that charges
were to be discussed with the
district attorney later in the day.
The reasons for the dropping of
charges against me last night were
because they knew that even in
Judge Hoffman's court "failure to
disperse" is difficult to prove
when the "mob" consists of one
person. I was at least 25 yards
from any other student at the
time of my arrest and it could
easily be proven in even the most
fascist court in the country (I
think).
Resisting arrest is also pretty
piggish. I only started to resist
when it seemed as though one of
the six pigs poking me with their
night sticks was trying to spoil my
love life.
This morning 1 have plenty of
bruises and bumps to show how
badly I was attacking the pip;. I
hope they all slept well last night.
I sure couldn't.
I'm sure all the good liberals
and even some of the
conservatives are now saying,
"Hmm, that boy had his
constitutional rights violated; he
should sue for false arrest.
It's damn difficult for any
individual worker or student to
receive justice under tin* laws that

are designed and carried out to
protect the interests of the super
pigs. Besides, after being laid off
for 3 months, where could I get
the money to pay a lawyer a $250
retainer to just begin to think
about it?
I don't have any money and I
don't have any intentions of
playing the pig's game. It's about
time every one of them listened to
the people. I say, for the people
now.
Turn on your hearing aids all
you super pigs and listen to my
brothers and sisters. You're either
on our side or you're off, and if
you're off, you're going to be
offed.
Free Huey. Free the Chicago
seven. Free all political prisoners.

Walker's Wanderings
(Following is a copy of a letter
I sent to President Pitzer,
following an article and picture in
the Jan. 30 Daily submitted by
Terry Adlhock)
Dear President Pitzer:
I was angered and perplexed to
read in today's Daily that you and
Mr. Walker had to fly to England
to attend the "inauguration of the
British campus."
My anger grew from what I
consider a wasteful expenditure of
funds at a time when the entire
University is asked to do some
financial belt-tightening. Perhaps
the thousand dollars or so for
your two flights across the
Atlantic came from already
budgeted funds, or from your
$50,000 office expense account.
Perhaps $2.5 million in projected
cutbacks isn't much affected by a
mere thousand dollars.
There are, however, numerous
other uses to which that money
could have been put: scholarship
funding; an account for books for
Undergraduate Special Seminars
(there are no such funds at
present: I'm teaching a seminar
and have asked); income tax
coverage for teaching assistants.
To the money for plane fares,
moreover, should be added
whatever it cost our two vitally
needed Stanford representatives
to lodge and travel while in
Britain.

As I understand it, the
Cliveden agreement whereby
Stanford acquired residence rights
on the Astor estate for the English
campus was consummated with
the English government months
ago. The inauguration would be,
therefore, purely ceremonial.
Hence, my perplexity as to why
Stanford had to have two special
representatives at the ceremony.
We have the director of the
campus in England as a
representative. We have the "good
offices" of the American embassy
and consulate in England for
special purposes such as sending
an American representative to
ceremonial occasions. Could not
these individuals have adequately
represented Stanford?
My displeasure today led me to
talk to several faculty members. It
seems, on credible information,
that Mr. Walker makes regular
jaunts, or should I say junkets, to
Europe, and not on an
"economy" or "student" scale. I
would like to know if these trips
are absolutely necessary, and, if
they are, on the economic scale
Mr. Walker uses. Again, I have to
ask: in a time of real economic
constraint, are such expenditures
really required?
I believe the symbolism as well
as the substance of your act is to
be questioned severely.
