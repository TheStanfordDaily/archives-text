# 'We Are Doing What We Can'
## Walker Defends Overseas Campuses' Policies 
### 
(Second in a series)
(Editor's note: This is the final
part of a series giving the reactions
of Director of Overseas Campuses
Robert A. Walker to articles
printed in the January 30 DAILY
concerning the Stanford overseas
program.)
With all the criticisms in the
Daily about the present operation
of the Overseas Campuses office
and Walker in particular, little of
the discussion focused on the new
structure adopted by the
Academic Senate in October.
Under this new structure, there is
a central coordinating Committee
on Foreign Study Programs and a
subcommittee responsible for
policies for each of the foreign
campuses. Walker is a non-voting
ex-officio member of all the
committees.
Committees Just Constituted
Walker stressed the fact that
the committees have only been in
operation since January and have
not yet had time to make any
decisions. The German
subcommittee has not even met
yet.
Concerning the subcommittees,
Walker says,"I think the
subcommittees will play a very
active role—l don't think there's
any question about it."
Walker indicated, however, that

he envisions the role of the central
committee as a strong one. In
pointing out what he considers an
important point in the Charge to
the Committee on Foreign Study
Programs, Walker says,"The
subcommittees are that. . .they
are subcommittees of a parent
committee and the key phrase
from that point of view is this
one."
The sentence he refers to, at
the end of a paragraph concerning
the role of the subcommittees, is:
"Nothing in this paragraph is
intended to prevent the
Committee from taking the
initiative on any matter affecting
its responsibility to coordinate
and oversee the total Foreign
Study Program."
Still, Walker agrees it is too
early to tell exactly how the new
committee structure will work.
"There is not agreement on the
Committee itself as to the relative
role of the main committee and
the subcommittees," he says.
"Neither the main committee nor
any of the subcommittees have
yet made any substantive
recommendations or adopted any
substantive policy." He agrees
they should be given a chance.
The other complaint in tne
Daily commentary that bothers
Walker is that he has built up a

bureaucracy based on the sway he
holds through the personal
appointment of faculty to the
overseas campuses. "This is the
charge that I find rather
annoying," says Walker.
Committee Chooses Faculty
"What has happened ever since
1964. . .is that there has been a
committee on faculty
appointments to overseas
campuses," he says. This
committee, Walker explains, has
the final authority of selecting the
faculty.
As Walker outlines the faculty
selection process, the faculty who
wish to go overseas speak to
Walker or people (e.g. department
chairman) who recommend
professors for overseas. The
faculty nominees then talk to
Walker and formulate their course
proposals. The faculty-student
nomination committee then votes
on the nominees and, Walker
insists, has in some cases reversed
Walker's recommendations.
The charge that the
appointments are purely Walker's
personal prerogative implies that
the committee is subservient to
his wishes. Walker says, "This is a
grave insult to the faculty
members and the students who
have been serving on the
committee."

Walker has somewhat less
vehement answers for other
complaints mentioned in the
articles. To the charge that the
travel budget for the home
administrators is too large, Walker
says, "You can't administer a
program far far away without
doing some traveling to keep in
touch."
Walker takes an average of
three trips each year, and has
taken an extra one in connection
with special problems for the last
three years. The other program
administrators, Mrs. H. Allen, Dr.
Paul Hanley, and Robert Hamrdla,
each take about one trip a year.
Walker says that these trips are
usually made in connection with
one of the charter flights so that
transportation at least one way is
on a charter.
Walker stresses that these trips
are necessary to anticipate
problems before they develop and
to keep good relations with the
overseas administrators.
On Walker's recent two-week
trip, he attended a reception at
Cliveden for the people who have
helped with the new British
campus. This reception was a
means of expressing appreciation
and also provided an opportunity
for the students at the campus to
meet some British people.

Walker did some work on the
budget while at Cliveden and then
went to the France campus for his
first visit there since last summer.
He then attended a three-day
conference of the directors of
American college programs in
Europe in Majorca. Walker admits
that he traveled first class on this
trip.
Another charge in the Daily
was that Walker has the sole
judicial power over important
disciplinary cases such as the
recent arrests of students for drug
offenses. Walker states that it
would have to be a "very serious
case indeed" to decide without
going through the customary
judicial process.
judicial Decisions Touchy
When pressed as to who makes
the decision whether or not a case
is serious enough, Walker
commented, "I suppose you can
say I make it." He emphasized,
however, that such decisions are
never made without consultation
with such sources as the Dean of
Students and the Provost's Office.
Walker indicates that this
administrative handling is
necessary because European
authorities, especially in Britain,
do not take drug transportation
lightly. He also indicates that each

case requires an individual
decision based on the
circumstances.
For example, in the case of
"Jane", the Britain campus coed
arrested in France, s! > was not
expelled but simply could not
return to Britain in time to enroll
for the second quarter there
because British authorities would
not readmit her. Nonetheless,
Walker says, the Overseas
Campuses Office did all they
could for her, including getting
her a good attorney through the
French campus administrators, so
that she received a very light
penalty.
'Booking 1 in J ail
At present, a boy from the
Austria campus is being held in a
British jail awaiting trial on drug
charges. In this case, the boy is
still enrolled since two professors
at the Austria campus and one at
the home campus offered to give
him directed reading while he is in
jail.
There was no such proposal in
"Jane's" case, so she could not
remain enrolled. Walker points
this out as an example of how
each case is a little different. In
the boy's case, as in the other,
Walker says, "We are doing what
we can."

Students and the Provost's Office.
Walker indicates that this
administrative handling is
necessary because European
authorities, especially in Britain,
do not take drug transportation
lightly. He also indicates that each

case requires an individual
decision based on the
circumstances.
For example, in the case of
"Jane", the Britain campus coed
arrested in France, s! > was not
expelled but simply could not
return to Britain in time to enroll
for the second quarter there
because British authorities would
not readmit her. Nonetheless,
Walker says, the Overseas
Campuses Office did all they
could for her, including getting
her a good attorney through the
French campus administrators, so
that she received a very light
penalty.
'Booking 1 in J ail
At present, a boy from the
Austria campus is being held in a
British jail awaiting trial on drug
charges. In this case, the boy is
still enrolled since two professors
at the Austria campus and one at
the home campus offered to give
him directed reading while he is in
jail.
There was no such proposal in
"Jane's" case, so she could not
remain enrolled. Walker points
this out as an example of how
each case is a little different. In
the boy's case, as in the other,
Walker says, "We are doing what
we can."

(Editor's note: This is the final
part of a series giving the reactions
of Director of Overseas Campuses
Robert A. Walker to articles
printed in the January 30 DAILY
concerning the Stanford overseas
program.)
With all the criticisms in the
Daily about the present operation
of the Overseas Campuses office
and Walker in particular, little of
the discussion focused on the new
structure adopted by the
Academic Senate in October.
Under this new structure, there is
a central coordinating Committee
on Foreign Study Programs and a
subcommittee responsible for
policies for each of the foreign
campuses. Walker is a non-voting
ex-officio member of all the
committees.
Committees Just Constituted
Walker stressed the fact that
the committees have only been in
operation since January and have
not yet had time to make any
decisions. The German
subcommittee has not even met
yet.
Concerning the subcommittees,
Walker says,"I think the
subcommittees will play a very
active role—l don't think there's
any question about it."
Walker indicated, however, that

he envisions the role of the central
committee as a strong one. In
pointing out what he considers an
important point in the Charge to
the Committee on Foreign Study
Programs, Walker says,"The
subcommittees are that. . .they
are subcommittees of a parent
committee and the key phrase
from that point of view is this
one."
The sentence he refers to, at
the end of a paragraph concerning
the role of the subcommittees, is:
"Nothing in this paragraph is
intended to prevent the
Committee from taking the
initiative on any matter affecting
its responsibility to coordinate
and oversee the total Foreign
Study Program."
Still, Walker agrees it is too
early to tell exactly how the new
committee structure will work.
"There is not agreement on the
Committee itself as to the relative
role of the main committee and
the subcommittees," he says.
"Neither the main committee nor
any of the subcommittees have
yet made any substantive
recommendations or adopted any
substantive policy." He agrees
they should be given a chance.
The other complaint in tne
Daily commentary that bothers
Walker is that he has built up a

bureaucracy based on the sway he
holds through the personal
appointment of faculty to the
overseas campuses. "This is the
charge that I find rather
annoying," says Walker.
Committee Chooses Faculty
"What has happened ever since
1964. . .is that there has been a
committee on faculty
appointments to overseas
campuses," he says. This
committee, Walker explains, has
the final authority of selecting the
faculty.
As Walker outlines the faculty
selection process, the faculty who
wish to go overseas speak to
Walker or people (e.g. department
chairman) who recommend
professors for overseas. The
faculty nominees then talk to
Walker and formulate their course
proposals. The faculty-student
nomination committee then votes
on the nominees and, Walker
insists, has in some cases reversed
Walker's recommendations.
The charge that the
appointments are purely Walker's
personal prerogative implies that
the committee is subservient to
his wishes. Walker says, "This is a
grave insult to the faculty
members and the students who
have been serving on the
committee."

Walker has somewhat less
vehement answers for other
complaints mentioned in the
articles. To the charge that the
travel budget for the home
administrators is too large, Walker
says, "You can't administer a
program far far away without
doing some traveling to keep in
touch."
Walker takes an average of
three trips each year, and has
taken an extra one in connection
with special problems for the last
three years. The other program
administrators, Mrs. H. Allen, Dr.
Paul Hanley, and Robert Hamrdla,
each take about one trip a year.
Walker says that these trips are
usually made in connection with
one of the charter flights so that
transportation at least one way is
on a charter.
Walker stresses that these trips
are necessary to anticipate
problems before they develop and
to keep good relations with the
overseas administrators.
On Walker's recent two-week
trip, he attended a reception at
Cliveden for the people who have
helped with the new British
campus. This reception was a
means of expressing appreciation
and also provided an opportunity
for the students at the campus to
meet some British people.

Walker did some work on the
budget while at Cliveden and then
went to the France campus for his
first visit there since last summer.
He then attended a three-day
conference of the directors of
American college programs in
Europe in Majorca. Walker admits
that he traveled first class on this
trip.
Another charge in the Daily
was that Walker has the sole
judicial power over important
disciplinary cases such as the
recent arrests of students for drug
offenses. Walker states that it
would have to be a "very serious
case indeed" to decide without
going through the customary
judicial process.
judicial Decisions Touchy
When pressed as to who makes
the decision whether or not a case
is serious enough, Walker
commented, "I suppose you can
say I make it." He emphasized,
however, that such decisions are
never made without consultation
with such sources as the Dean of
Students and the Provost's Office.
Walker indicates that this
administrative handling is

Walker stresses that these trips
are necessary to anticipate
problems before they develop and
to keep good relations with the
overseas administrators.
On Walker's recent two-week
trip, he attended a reception at
Cliveden for the people who have
helped with the new British
campus. This reception was a
means of expressing appreciation
and also provided an opportunity
for the students at the campus to
meet some British people.

Walker did some work on the
budget while at Cliveden and then
went to the France campus for his
first visit there since last summer.
He then attended a three-day
conference of the directors of
American college programs in
Europe in Majorca. Walker admits
that he traveled first class on this
trip.
Another charge in the Daily
was that Walker has the sole
judicial power over important
disciplinary cases such as the
recent arrests of students for drug
offenses. Walker states that it
would have to be a "very serious
case indeed" to decide without
going through the customary
judicial process.
judicial Decisions Touchy
When pressed as to who makes
the decision whether or not a case
is serious enough, Walker
commented, "I suppose you can
say I make it." He emphasized,
however, that such decisions are
never made without consultation
with such sources as the Dean of
Students and the Provost's Office.
Walker indicates that this
administrative handling is
necessary because European
authorities, especially in Britain,
do not take drug transportation
lightly. He also indicates that each

case requires an individual
decision based on the
circumstances.
For example, in the case of
"Jane", the Britain campus coed
arrested in France, s! > was not
expelled but simply could not
return to Britain in time to enroll
for the second quarter there
because British authorities would
not readmit her. Nonetheless,
Walker says, the Overseas
Campuses Office did all they
could for her, including getting
her a good attorney through the
French campus administrators, so
that she received a very light
penalty.
'Booking 1 in J ail
At present, a boy from the
Austria campus is being held in a
British jail awaiting trial on drug
charges. In this case, the boy is
still enrolled since two professors
at the Austria campus and one at
the home campus offered to give
him directed reading while he is in
jail.
There was no such proposal in
"Jane's" case, so she could not
remain enrolled. Walker points
this out as an example of how
each case is a little different. In
the boy's case, as in the other,
Walker says, "We are doing what
we can."

(Editor's note: This is the final
part of a series giving the reactions
of Director of Overseas Campuses
Robert A. Walker to articles
printed in the January 30 DAILY
concerning the Stanford overseas
program.)
With all the criticisms in the
Daily about the present operation
of the Overseas Campuses office
and Walker in particular, little of
the discussion focused on the new
structure adopted by the
Academic Senate in October.
Under this new structure, there is
a central coordinating Committee
on Foreign Study Programs and a
subcommittee responsible for
policies for each of the foreign
campuses. Walker is a non-voting
ex-officio member of all the
committees.
Committees Just Constituted
Walker stressed the fact that
the committees have only been in
operation since January and have
not yet had time to make any
decisions. The German
subcommittee has not even met
yet.
Concerning the subcommittees,
Walker says,"I think the
subcommittees will play a very
active role—l don't think there's
any question about it."
Walker indicated, however, that

he envisions the role of the central
committee as a strong one. In
pointing out what he considers an
important point in the Charge to
the Committee on Foreign Study
Programs, Walker says,"The
subcommittees are that. . .they
are subcommittees of a parent
committee and the key phrase
from that point of view is this
one."
The sentence he refers to, at
the end of a paragraph concerning
the role of the subcommittees, is:
"Nothing in this paragraph is
intended to prevent the
Committee from taking the
initiative on any matter affecting
its responsibility to coordinate
and oversee the total Foreign
Study Program."
Still, Walker agrees it is too
early to tell exactly how the new
committee structure will work.
"There is not agreement on the
Committee itself as to the relative
role of the main committee and
the subcommittees," he says.
"Neither the main committee nor
any of the subcommittees have
yet made any substantive
recommendations or adopted any
substantive policy." He agrees
they should be given a chance.
The other complaint in tne
Daily commentary that bothers
Walker is that he has built up a

bureaucracy based on the sway he
holds through the personal
appointment of faculty to the
overseas campuses. "This is the
charge that I find rather
annoying," says Walker.
Committee Chooses Faculty
"What has happened ever since
1964. . .is that there has been a
committee on faculty
appointments to overseas
campuses," he says. This
committee, Walker explains, has
the final authority of selecting the
faculty.
As Walker outlines the faculty
selection process, the faculty who
wish to go overseas speak to
Walker or people (e.g. department
chairman) who recommend
professors for overseas. The
faculty nominees then talk to
Walker and formulate their course
proposals. The faculty-student
nomination committee then votes
on the nominees and, Walker
insists, has in some cases reversed
Walker's recommendations.
The charge that the
appointments are purely Walker's
personal prerogative implies that
the committee is subservient to
his wishes. Walker says, "This is a
grave insult to the faculty
members and the students who
have been serving on the
committee."

Walker has somewhat less
vehement answers for other
complaints mentioned in the
articles. To the charge that the
travel budget for the home
administrators is too large, Walker
says, "You can't administer a
program far far away without
doing some traveling to keep in
touch."
Walker takes an average of
three trips each year, and has
taken an extra one in connection
with special problems for the last
three years. The other program
administrators, Mrs. H. Allen, Dr.
Paul Hanley, and Robert Hamrdla,
each take about one trip a year.
Walker says that these trips are
usually made in connection with
one of the charter flights so that
transportation at least one way is
on a charter.
Walker stresses that these trips
are necessary to anticipate
problems before they develop and
to keep good relations with the
overseas administrators.
