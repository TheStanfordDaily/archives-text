# Finance Crisis Continued
## Federal Aid Leveling Off 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
(This is the second part of an
article on the financial prognosis
for Stanford in the coming
decade.)
Cuthbertson noted in
November that Stanford has
generally experienced unforseen
increases in income on a
year-to-year basis over the past 12
years. This has allowed Stanford
to "set its targets higher than
prudence otherwise might have
suggested" and to build up its
uncommitted reserves which are
now being tapped to balance the
budget's deficits.
"Now, however, we are clearly
up against the crunch which we
have always known might come.
Income has not improved beyond
our expectations. To provide for
cost increases where we clearly
cannot avoid them, we have to
reduce certain of our other
activities. The budget cuts we are
now planning are needed to avoid
thoroughly unacceptable
long-range deficits."
A number of steps are being
taken to bolster private income.
Tuition, which meets only 37
percent of Stanford's educational
expenditures, will increase from
$2,145 this year to $2,400 in
1970-71, the largest dollar
increase and largest percentage
increase that Stanford has ever
made. Also, increased earnings on
Stanford's endowment through

more effective investment
practices will be realized.
The $29 million in private gift
support last year is expected to
increase to $50 million annually
in 10 years. However, it is still
clear that the federal government
will have to assume a greater share
in supporting major universities
and colleges—which might be
considered actual "national"
universities, on the basis of their
contributions to American
society. Particular is thy need to
increase — and not
decrease—federal support for
university research.
Yet, according to Cuthbertson,
"both the administration and
Congress have been making radical
cuts in the level of support for
basic research through the various
major agencies. Fundamental
research in universities cannot be
turned on and off like water from
a faucet, yet the legislative
appropriations and administrative
allocations have tended to assume
this. The universities are indeed
unable to make 'projections of
future financing by source."
In his Financial Report,
Cuthbertson declared that "as this
nation enters the 1970'5, an
overall constructive program is
desperately needed for higher
education. Increased enrollments,
rising costs, and new educational
and social responsibilities all point

to the fact that if higher
education is to be an effective
servant to the nation's well-being,
the federal government must take
more positive steps."
The 1968 Carnegie Commission
on Higher Education, headed by
Clark Kerr, formerly president of
the University of California,
pointed out the disparity in
opportunity of students based on
socio-economic factors.
Through educational
opportunity grants available to
undergraduates from low income
families, the federal government
has taken steps to correct this
imbalance. However, as
Cuthbertson notes, "just as the
value of the program seemed
verified, the funding has leveled
off despite increasing need."
"An appropriate level of
funding would allow all college
students, both undergraduate and
graduate, with demonstrated
need, the assurance of some
financial aid to meet expenses at
institutions which they select.
Individual institutions cannot
provide this level of support from
existing sources of funds; so a
federal role seems clear."
The Carnegie report also
strongly recommends that "the
federal government grant
cost-of-education supplements to
colleges and universities based on
the numbers and levels of students

holding federal grants enrolled in
the institutions." These
supplements, according to
Cuthbertson, "could be used by
institutions for general operation
costs. They would strengthen
small as well as large, and public
as well as private institutions and
encourage innovative programs
and add diversity to student
bodies, all of which would
enhance the value of our
pluralistic educational system."
Both Cuthbertson and the
Carnegie Commission have noted
the basic need for expanded loan
programs to college students.
Unfortunately, appropriations for
these programs are also being cut.
"In addition," notes Cuthbertson,
"over 600 Stanford students
applied last year to borrow from
private banks under the federal
program of guaranteed bank
loans. But this program was
handicapped by the failure of
Congress to authorize an increase
in realistic interest rates until after
the school terms had already
started in the fall."
Cuthertson also noted the need
for a sufficient and continuing
"student loan bank" on a national
scale and with the federal
government's sponsorship. "A
student loan program in which
need is not a condition of
eligibility would allow a greater
freedom of opportunity in
individual pursuits, and
availability of loan funds would
provide greater flexibility and
mobility of student choices,"
declares Cuthbertson.
Lastly, Cuthbertson hopes for
"a continuation of the trend away
from concentration of research
support in defense and space
agencies and toward other federal
departments." This trend would
particularly help the universities
because it would offer some
protection from violent
fluctuations in levels of support
(as is currently) due to changes in
policy or appropriations in a
single agency.
In his conclusion to the
Stanford Financial Report 1969,
Cuthbertson declared, "The
people of the United States have
it in their power not only to
insure the continued distinction
and broad base of our nation's
higher education but also to
encourage the further
improvement of that education.
That power can be exercised
individually and directly or it can
be exercised through
governments. Unless it is exercised
in both ways the country will
waste one of its greatest assets."
However, whatever money
Stanford hopes to get from
non-federal sources cannot in any
way answer the problems in the
growing financial crisis. Expanded
federal aid—to the students and
directly to the university—is
urgent.
