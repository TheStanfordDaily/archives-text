## 
### JANE CORRIGAN 
The Stanford Midpeninsula
Urban Coalition held its first
annual meeting Tuesday night to
discuss the progress of its first
year and its hopes for the future.
In the words of Dr. Edward
Ginzton, co-chairman of the
Organization, the racially and
economically diverse Coalition has
as its objective "to be a force in
trying to change urban America
from what it has been for
centuries to what we would like
to see it be." In keeping with this
goal, the group has established a
number of Task Forces to work in
specific problem areas. The
activities of each of these groups
were covered in the annual report.
The Housing Development Task
Force is currently one of the most
active. It is sponsoring the
development and construction of
a 32 unit low-to-moderate income
housing project in Mountain
View, which will be subsidized by
Federal funds. At this time the
Coalition is awaiting the arrival of
an FHA letter of feasibility for
the project before they can Jbegin
final planning.
The Task Force is working with
several Chicano organizations in
Mountain View in hopes that the
assistance and advice of local
groups will help to insure that the
housing project will be racially
balanced and economically mixed.
The Housing Development Force
is also working on the creation of
a local Housing Development
Corporation and a revolving Loan
Fund. It also hopes to develop an

area-wide plan for housing which
will prevent some communities
from becoming industrial in
nature while leaving the burden of
the provision of housing to
neighboring towns.
The Economic Development
Task Force is attempting to aid in
the development and expansion of
small businesses by persons of
color or lack of starting capital.
They have established a
connection with "Opportunities
Through Ownership," a private
funding corporation with a loan
fund of over $2 million. In
addition, the force has aided in
the creation of the Palo Alto
Capital Corporation, which has
funded nine minority owned
businesses since it was licensed in
October.
The Health Task Force headed
by Dr. R.V. Lee, founder of the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic, has been
working on a number of projects.
Among them are the expansion of
the Neighborhood Health Center
in East Palo Alto as a
self-supporting, profit-making
organization, the consolidation of
existing programs which are
dealing with the problem of
hunger in the area, the
maintenance of a Dental
Foundation which provides free
dental services, and working to
achieve the fluoridation of the
water in East Palo Alto.
A questionnaire seeking
minority citizen's opinions on the
police force and other law-related
agencies is currently being
prepared by the Law and Justice

Task Force, which hopes to use
the suggestions given in the
implementation of the necessary
actions programs. Another
sub-group is working on the
improvement of employment of
minority groups in Law and
Justice agencies.
The Employment Task Force
itself is concentrating on the
Affirmative Action Program,
which has as its slogan "A Job Is
Not Enough." The program has as
its goals working plans for
employment and training,
education, business development
community development, and
employee relations and thus far
has been adopted by the
Lockheed, Fairchild and Pacific
Telephone Corporations.
At the meeting, the Coalition
elected a new co-chairman to
replace Wolfgang Panofsky of
SLAC. Mayor William Jelavich of
Mountain View was unanimously
elected, joining Dr. Edward
Ginzton cf the Varian
Corporation and Robert Hoover,
president of Nairobi College. The
Executive Director of the Urban
Coalition is Ira Hall.

discuss the progress of its first
year and its hopes for the future.
In the words of Dr. Edward
Ginzton, co-chairman of the
Organization, the racially and
economically diverse Coalition has
as its objective "to be a force in
trying to change urban America
from what it has been for
centuries to what we would like
to see it be." In keeping with this
goal, the group has established a
number of Task Forces to work in
specific problem areas. The
activities of each of these groups
were covered in the annual report.
The Housing Development Task
Force is currently one of the most
active. It is sponsoring the
development and construction of
a 32 unit low-to-moderate income
housing project in Mountain
View, which will be subsidized by
Federal funds. At this time the
Coalition is awaiting the arrival of
an FHA letter of feasibility for
the project before they can Jbegin
final planning.
The Task Force is working with
several Chicano organizations in
Mountain View in hopes that the
assistance and advice of local
groups will help to insure that the
housing project will be racially
balanced and economically mixed.
The Housing Development Force
is also working on the creation of
a local Housing Development
Corporation and a revolving Loan
Fund. It also hopes to develop an

area-wide plan for housing which
will prevent some communities
from becoming industrial in
nature while leaving the burden of
the provision of housing to
neighboring towns.
The Economic Development
Task Force is attempting to aid in
the development and expansion of
small businesses by persons of
color or lack of starting capital.
They have established a
connection with "Opportunities
Through Ownership," a private
funding corporation with a loan
fund of over $2 million. In
addition, the force has aided in
the creation of the Palo Alto
Capital Corporation, which has
funded nine minority owned
businesses since it was licensed in
October.
The Health Task Force headed
by Dr. R.V. Lee, founder of the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic, has been
working on a number of projects.
Among them are the expansion of
the Neighborhood Health Center
in East Palo Alto as a
self-supporting, profit-making
organization, the consolidation of
existing programs which are
dealing with the problem of
hunger in the area, the
maintenance of a Dental
Foundation which provides free
dental services, and working to
achieve the fluoridation of the
water in East Palo Alto.
A questionnaire seeking
minority citizen's opinions on the
police force and other law-related
agencies is currently being
prepared by the Law and Justice

Task Force, which hopes to use
the suggestions given in the
implementation of the necessary
actions programs. Another
sub-group is working on the
improvement of employment of
minority groups in Law and
Justice agencies.
The Employment Task Force
itself is concentrating on the
Affirmative Action Program,
which has as its slogan "A Job Is
Not Enough." The program has as
its goals working plans for
employment and training,
education, business development
community development, and
employee relations and thus far
has been adopted by the
Lockheed, Fairchild and Pacific
Telephone Corporations.
At the meeting, the Coalition
elected a new co-chairman to
replace Wolfgang Panofsky of
SLAC. Mayor William Jelavich of
Mountain View was unanimously
elected, joining Dr. Edward
Ginzton cf the Varian
Corporation and Robert Hoover,
president of Nairobi College. The
Executive Director of the Urban
Coalition is Ira Hall.

Urban Coalition held its first
annual meeting Tuesday night to
