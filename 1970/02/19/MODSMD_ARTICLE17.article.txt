# Women Discuss Range of Issues

### LESLIE CAMPBELL 
Alienated undergraduate women can smile again. Someone cares
about them after all. Tuesday night at 7:30 in Tresidder 270,
members of Women's Liberation expressed their concern for the needs
of undergraduate women.
A campaign of investigation was proposed to discuss with
undergraduate women at their dorms the issues of Women's
Liberation. One woman suggested, "We should try to get
undergraduates to ask themselves what their needs are and why they
would want to go out and work for Women's Liberation."
The fear was expressed that the nonchildbearing undergraduates are
being alienated from Women's Liberation because they are not
directly involved with the presently emphasized issue of child care.
Some members insisted that undergraduate women are "pampered"
by their sheltered, unrealistic Stanford environment. They complained
that these girls won't be ready for what they find when they graduate;
that "it won't be so easy," as Stanford life seems to imply.
In looking for an issue that would appeal to all Stanford women,
the group disputed over the issue of female discrimination inherent in
student admissions and the issue of a child care center. It was decided
that the admissions issue is too abstract because, a woman observed,
"we are already here at Stanford," implying—why worry?
To include the undergraduate women, it was suggested that an
organized dorm campaign bring specific case studies to the attention
of undergraduates. This would involve them on a more personal and
emotional level.
After commending themselves on their birthday party success, talk
centered on taking a financial position on the child care issue. It was
decided that, rather than supporting a pro-rated child care center,
they would support a center which would be free to all members of
the Stanford community. A thirty page proposal for the center is
presently in its final stages and will soon be available for circulation to
the public.
The next Women's Liberation will be next Wednesday at 8:00.
Undergraduate ideas are welcome and wanted.
