# Two Companies Present Two Styles
## 
### GARY SALT 
Two weeks ago, two prominent
dance companies were in the Bay
Area offering enthusiasts an
unprecedented array of nearly
twenty ballets in less than a
week's time. The two groups
present marked contrasts in
repertoire, style, form, and
performance—from the economy
and choreographic diversity of the
youthful Harkness Ballet at
Zellerbach Auditorium to the
opulence and magnificent
ostentation of the American
Ballet Theatre at the Opera
House. The ballets ranged from
the proto-classics, "Giselle" and
"Swan Lake," to contemporary
adventures like the Harkness'
"Night Song," "a pure dance
work combining classical and
modern dance forms."
Although individual
performances were particularly
impressive, the Harkness program
was somewhat of a
disappointment. "Night Song"
offered some intriguing
experiments in forms, using
modern idioms in a classical
vocabulary but it is primarily an
adagio ensemble work and
demands too much strenuous
control and precise execution to
be wasted as a curtain-raiser.
Period Work
The uncommon denominator
of each of the four Harkness
programs was Jerome Robbins'
much-acclaimed "N.Y. Export,
Op. Jazz," "a formal, abstract
ballet" derived from the popular
dance motifs of the American
fifties that has, not surprisingly,
become a period piece despite its
recent vintage (1958). "N.Y.
Export" is no longer about young
people today and Robbins'
finger-snapping, hip-swinging,
crouching, growling teenagers are
West Side Story refugees evoking
more nostalgia than excitement.
Two other Harkness pieces,
however, were truly entertaining,
powerful, and more representative
of the company's strengths.
Elisabeth Carroll and Helgi
Tomasson are remarkable dancers
and gave notable performances in
"Canto Indio," a delightful pas de
deux about your love using a
Spanish motif and lightly
seasoned with satiric hints of
feminine coyness and masculine
infatuation.
Perfect Poise
Miss Carroll's opening series of
heel-spins, her demi-pointe

prancing, skirt-rustling and
blouse-pulling antics while her
lover is showing-off center stage,
and their last flights around the
stage together were flawlessl"
executed.
This is an effervescent
showpiece for this duo and they
deliver the goods. "Monument for
a Dead Boy," on the other hand,
presents a striking technical and
emotional contrast to "Canto
Indio." "Monument" is an
intricate dramatic ballet, a
"cradle-to-grave" sage done in an
expressionistic style, "full of lives,
full of memories, heavy with
misery and pleasure."
Lawrence Rhodes as the Boy,
Lone Isaksen as the Blue Girl, and
Bonnie Mathis and Dale
Muchmore as the Parents
demonstrated outstanding acting
ability as well as technical
flexibility in a complex series of
dances more demanding of its
audience than any other ballet
I've seen.
Fast Kay IJallet
Across the Bay, the American
Ballet Theatre, celebrating its
thirtieth birthday this year,
enchanted audiences with some of
the masterpieces of classical ballet
and what more can be said of
"Giselle" or "La Sylphide" or the
incomparable "Swan Lake" A
complete "Swan Lake" is always a
major event and David Blair
compounds the interest with a
production visually stupendous
yet sensitive to the tenderness and
tragedy of the Odette-Siegfried
love story.
The ABT has one of the finest
corps de ballet in the world as is
abundantly clear from their
rigorous performance in "Swan
Lake "—arabesques superbly
positioned and matched and a
stunning Swan chorus in Act 11.
Among the featured dancers,
Rosanna Seravalli and Paula Tracy
are especially impressive as the
Swan maidens in Act 11. They join
with two other fine performers,
Marcos Paredes and Dennis Nahat,
for a brief but memorable
divertissement during the Banquet
scene and their partnering is most
effective.
Recovery
Monday evening the principal
dancers were Eleanor D'Antuono
as Odette&Odile, Ted Kivitt as
Siegfried, and Reese Ha wroth as
Benno. Both Kivitt and Miss
D'Antuono performed exquisite
variations, Kivitt is a dazzling
flyer and Miss D'Antuono whirled
through her Black Swan coda
effortlessly after recovering from
an unfortunate error during the
opening pas de deux. The acting
was first-rate without exception
and Miss D'Antuono is fortunate
in having her expressive and
moving characterization of Odette
enhanced by such a talent
extravaganza.

Benno. Both Kivitt and Miss
D'Antuono performed exquisite
variations, Kivitt is a dazzling
flyer and Miss D'Antuono whirled
through her Black Swan coda
effortlessly after recovering from
an unfortunate error during the
opening pas de deux. The acting
was first-rate without exception
and Miss D'Antuono is fortunate
in having her expressive and
moving characterization of Odette
enhanced by such a talent
extravaganza.


Two weeks ago, two prominent
dance companies were in the Bay
Area offering enthusiasts an
unprecedented array of nearly
twenty ballets in less than a
week's time. The two groups
present marked contrasts in
repertoire, style, form, and
performance—from the economy
and choreographic diversity of the
youthful Harkness Ballet at
Zellerbach Auditorium to the
opulence and magnificent
ostentation of the American
Ballet Theatre at the Opera
House. The ballets ranged from
the proto-classics, "Giselle" and
"Swan Lake," to contemporary
adventures like the Harkness'
"Night Song," "a pure dance
work combining classical and
modern dance forms."
Although individual
performances were particularly
impressive, the Harkness program
was somewhat of a
disappointment. "Night Song"
offered some intriguing
experiments in forms, using
modern idioms in a classical
vocabulary but it is primarily an
adagio ensemble work and
demands too much strenuous
control and precise execution to
be wasted as a curtain-raiser.
Period Work
The uncommon denominator
of each of the four Harkness
programs was Jerome Robbins'
much-acclaimed "N.Y. Export,
Op. Jazz," "a formal, abstract
ballet" derived from the popular
dance motifs of the American
fifties that has, not surprisingly,
become a period piece despite its
recent vintage (1958). "N.Y.
Export" is no longer about young
people today and Robbins'
finger-snapping, hip-swinging,
crouching, growling teenagers are
West Side Story refugees evoking
more nostalgia than excitement.
Two other Harkness pieces,
however, were truly entertaining,
powerful, and more representative
of the company's strengths.
Elisabeth Carroll and Helgi
Tomasson are remarkable dancers
and gave notable performances in
"Canto Indio," a delightful pas de
deux about your love using a
Spanish motif and lightly
seasoned with satiric hints of
feminine coyness and masculine
infatuation.
Perfect Poise
Miss Carroll's opening series of
heel-spins, her demi-pointe

prancing, skirt-rustling and
blouse-pulling antics while her
lover is showing-off center stage,
and their last flights around the
stage together were flawlessl"
executed.
This is an effervescent
showpiece for this duo and they
deliver the goods. "Monument for
a Dead Boy," on the other hand,
presents a striking technical and
emotional contrast to "Canto
Indio." "Monument" is an
intricate dramatic ballet, a
"cradle-to-grave" sage done in an
expressionistic style, "full of lives,
full of memories, heavy with
misery and pleasure."
Lawrence Rhodes as the Boy,
Lone Isaksen as the Blue Girl, and
Bonnie Mathis and Dale
Muchmore as the Parents
demonstrated outstanding acting
ability as well as technical
flexibility in a complex series of
dances more demanding of its
audience than any other ballet
I've seen.
Fast Kay IJallet
Across the Bay, the American
Ballet Theatre, celebrating its
thirtieth birthday this year,
enchanted audiences with some of
the masterpieces of classical ballet
and what more can be said of
"Giselle" or "La Sylphide" or the
incomparable "Swan Lake" A
complete "Swan Lake" is always a
major event and David Blair
compounds the interest with a
production visually stupendous
yet sensitive to the tenderness and
tragedy of the Odette-Siegfried
love story.
The ABT has one of the finest
corps de ballet in the world as is
abundantly clear from their
rigorous performance in "Swan
Lake "—arabesques superbly
positioned and matched and a
stunning Swan chorus in Act 11.
Among the featured dancers,
Rosanna Seravalli and Paula Tracy
are especially impressive as the
Swan maidens in Act 11. They join
with two other fine performers,
Marcos Paredes and Dennis Nahat,
for a brief but memorable
divertissement during the Banquet
scene and their partnering is most
effective.

Among the featured dancers,
Rosanna Seravalli and Paula Tracy
are especially impressive as the
Swan maidens in Act 11. They join
with two other fine performers,
Marcos Paredes and Dennis Nahat,
for a brief but memorable
divertissement during the Banquet
scene and their partnering is most
effective.
Recovery
Monday evening the principal
dancers were Eleanor D'Antuono
as Odette&Odile, Ted Kivitt as
Siegfried, and Reese Ha wroth as
Benno. Both Kivitt and Miss
D'Antuono performed exquisite
variations, Kivitt is a dazzling
flyer and Miss D'Antuono whirled
through her Black Swan coda
effortlessly after recovering from
an unfortunate error during the
opening pas de deux. The acting
was first-rate without exception
and Miss D'Antuono is fortunate
in having her expressive and
moving characterization of Odette
enhanced by such a talent
extravaganza.
