## Desegregation Pace Slowed 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Senate
voted overwhelmingly Wednesday
to require uniform enforcement
of school desergregation
throughout the land, giving the
Deep South one of its biggest civil

rights victories in more than a
decade.
Climaxing a week of often
bitter debate, the Senate voted 56
to 36 to adopt an amendment by
Sen. John C. Stennis, D-Miss., to a
$35 billion education bill.
"I based my fight on the
grounds that we must have
support of the public schools by
the people," said the courtly,
deep-voiced Southern leader after
the vote.
The action came after the
Senate rejected two Republican
attempts to water down the
Stennis amendment.
During the debate the White
House sent up a new manifesto
that both sides seized upon as
supporting their own views.
The Stennis amendment would
require the government to put the
same effort into desegregating
schools in the North as it does in
the South, whatever the cause of
that segregation.
But opponents charged that it
carried a hidden intent of trying
to collapse all federal efforts to
break down school segregation.
Stennis had high praise for a
Northern liberal who joined his
camp early in the
debate-Democrat Abraham
Ribicoff of Connecticut.
"1 give him all the credit for
illuminating this subject in such a
way as to make it compelling,"
said Stennis. He referred to
Ribicoff's surprise speech last
week charging Northeners with
hypocrisy.

Twenty-seven Republicans
joined 29 Democrats to approve
the amendment while 12
Republicans voted with 24
Democrats against it.
Officer Dies
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-Police
Sgt. Brian V. McDonnell, 45, died
Wednesday of injuries suffered in
the Monday night time-bombing
of the Park precinct station.
Six other officers were hurt in
the shattering explosion of a pipe
bomb loaded with steel fence
staples and bullets.
Planted on an outside window
sill, it was so powerful it blew a
hole in the wall.
It was the latest of a long series
of apparently unconnected
bombings in the San Francisco
Bay Area over the past 2Vi years.
It followed by only four days a
double bombing at the Berkeley
police station that hurt six
officers and destroyed three cars.
McDonnell's right eye was
destroyed by a staple that
penetrated deep into his brain.
Others damaged his left eye and
severed the carotid artery. Massive
transfusions had helped keep him
alive, but he died shortly after
noon.
Mayor Joseph L. Alioto
declared, "This city shall pursue
his murderers relentlessly and
shall vigorously prosecute all
those involved in terrorism and
violence. The brutal fanaticism
behind the sergeant's death shocks
the entire community."
Flags on all city buildings were
lowered to half staff.

The city already had posted a
$5,000 reward for information on
the bombing.
Police reported no
developments as they pressed a
painstaking investigation.
Black Sit-In
AMHERST, Mass. (AP) - About
200 black students, saying there is
a "meaningless dialogue" between
the students and the Amherst
College administration, seized five
buildings Wednesday and
demanded the right to "determine
our own programs, policies and
direction."
The campus police briefly
closed off the campus to outside
students, and then left their posts
as morning classes began.
Classes continued as scheduled
when a proposed student strike in
support of the blacks failed to
gain momentum.
The students occupied the
Robert Frost Library, the Science
Center, Converse Hall, the
Administration building, the black
cultural center and the school
financial office building.
Local and state police had been
informed of the takeover, but
they were not summoned by the
campus police.
The students said they were
from Amherst, the University of
Massachusetts, and Smith and
Mount Holyoke Colleges.
Campus reports said that about
50 students were in each building.
No white students were reported
involved.
