As you may have noticed, Chinese cooking
contains infinitesimal amounts of meat. It is
therefore highly useful when trying to dispose of
left overs, or stretch the budget, or consume your
weekly quota of vegetables in one sitting.
This is my favorite way to conceal just about
any variety of left over meat or poultry. Despite
the list of ingredients, it goes together quickly.
