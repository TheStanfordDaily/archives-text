### FRED LEESON 
Two exhausted heavyweights
decked supine on the Encina
mats, .the appropriate conclusion
to a 15-15 wrestling tie Tuesday
night against San Jose State.
For the Spartans it was an
upset that got away.
For Stanford, down 15-9 with
two matches left, it was a tough
truggle back. The Indians made it
with nothing to spare.
Bob Leeper (190) decisioned
Ray Mendiola 7-6 and then
heavyweight Lee Fair clinched the
tie with a 11-10 win over Cleve
Holt in a match-up that left both
grapplers flat and gasping at the
and.
With the help of two near falls,
Fair built up an 11-4 lead at the
end of the second period. With
111-8. Then 11-10. Fair called
time-out, had Coach Dave Reed
check the heavyweight's ailing
back, and hung on for the final
.seconds.
Bob Leeper's match was just as
exciting as he built a 4-1 lead, lost
it at 6-5, and came up with a
take-down with 32 seconds left to
give him the win.
Get The Point?
Those were just two of the one
point decisions. There were a
couple other close ones both in
San Jose State's favor.
Jerry Beaudoin lost 7-5 to
Terry Kerr and Bill Ross dropped
an odd 2-1 verdict to Walt
Thatcher. Regardless,
hoarse-voiced Reed claimed
afterward that "Bill Ross and
Jerry Beadoin wrestled the best
matches of their collegiate
careers."
Bill Ross lost his match when
the referee awarded a take-down

to the Spartan grappler while both
wrestlers were falling out of the
ring. Ross had scored first on an
escape, following 4:02 of scoreless
scramble.
After Bill Ross' narrow defeat
and Ray Williams 7-3 loss
immediately after, the Indian
outlook was dim as the Spartan
lead was upped to 15-9. But then
came Leeper and Fair.
Spartan Lead
Dave Kopolow rompt to a
13-5 decision to open the meet,
and Stanford made its lead 6-3
when Dave Thomas whipped Dave
Smith 12-6. After Beaudoin's loss,
Jerry Ross fell 6-3 to Arnold
Dominquez, putting the Spartans
on top 9-6.
Len Smith of Stanford then
defeated Tim Kerr to set the stage
for Bill Ross' 2-1 loss and the rest
of the excitement.
Just a week ago the Tribe had
defeated the Spartans 22-16 in
San Jose, but the Stanford line-up
was slightly different this time out
as some grapplers had changed
weight classifications.
Reed said later that he had
hoped to pick up more points in
the light weights—maybe even a
pin or two—and then protect that
lead. In the end SJS had the lead
to protect, and the visitors almost
did it.
Stanford's record is now 8-2-1.
Home Finale
The Indian grapplers finish
their home season tomorrow night
with a 7:30 p.m. finale with
Fresno State on the Encina
Pavilion mats.
Stanford then closes out its
dual meet season with away bouts
with UC-Berkeley and Cal
Poly-SLO—both excellent squads.

exciting as he built a 4-1 lead, lost
it at 6-5, and came up with a
take-down with 32 seconds left to
give him the win.
Get The Point?
Those were just two of the one
point decisions. There were a
couple other close ones both in
San Jose State's favor.
Jerry Beaudoin lost 7-5 to
Terry Kerr and Bill Ross dropped
an odd 2-1 verdict to Walt
Thatcher. Regardless,
hoarse-voiced Reed claimed
afterward that "Bill Ross and
Jerry Beadoin wrestled the best
matches of their collegiate
careers."
Bill Ross lost his match when
the referee awarded a take-down

to the Spartan grappler while both
wrestlers were falling out of the
ring. Ross had scored first on an
escape, following 4:02 of scoreless
scramble.
After Bill Ross' narrow defeat
and Ray Williams 7-3 loss
immediately after, the Indian
outlook was dim as the Spartan
lead was upped to 15-9. But then
came Leeper and Fair.
Spartan Lead
Dave Kopolow rompt to a
13-5 decision to open the meet,
and Stanford made its lead 6-3
when Dave Thomas whipped Dave
Smith 12-6. After Beaudoin's loss,
Jerry Ross fell 6-3 to Arnold
Dominquez, putting the Spartans
on top 9-6.
Len Smith of Stanford then
defeated Tim Kerr to set the stage
for Bill Ross' 2-1 loss and the rest
of the excitement.
Just a week ago the Tribe had
defeated the Spartans 22-16 in
San Jose, but the Stanford line-up
was slightly different this time out
as some grapplers had changed
weight classifications.
Reed said later that he had
hoped to pick up more points in
the light weights—maybe even a
pin or two—and then protect that
lead. In the end SJS had the lead
to protect, and the visitors almost
did it.
Stanford's record is now 8-2-1.
Home Finale
The Indian grapplers finish
their home season tomorrow night
with a 7:30 p.m. finale with
Fresno State on the Encina
Pavilion mats.
Stanford then closes out its
dual meet season with away bouts
with UC-Berkeley and Cal
Poly-SLO—both excellent squads.
Two exhausted heavyweights
decked supine on the Encina
mats, .the appropriate conclusion
to a 15-15 wrestling tie Tuesday
night against San Jose State.
For the Spartans it was an
upset that got away.
For Stanford, down 15-9 with
two matches left, it was a tough
truggle back. The Indians made it
with nothing to spare.
Bob Leeper (190) decisioned
Ray Mendiola 7-6 and then
heavyweight Lee Fair clinched the
tie with a 11-10 win over Cleve
Holt in a match-up that left both
grapplers flat and gasping at the
and.
With the help of two near falls,
Fair built up an 11-4 lead at the
end of the second period. With
111-8. Then 11-10. Fair called
time-out, had Coach Dave Reed
check the heavyweight's ailing
back, and hung on for the final
.seconds.
Bob Leeper's match was just as
