# Winners Await Playoff

### SCOTT BURNS 
As the regular season play
draws to a close, the first and
second place teams of each league
are preparing for the IM
Basketball playoffs.
In the biggest game of the past
week, third ranked Branner
cleaned 12th ranked Roble 65-39
to win their league championship.
Big center Jay Holf was just too
hard to handle as he scored 18
points for Branner, while the
team's leading scorer, Chris
Martin, added 12 more.
The first-ranked Panthers won
tv/o more to easily win their
league and the probably first

seeding in the playoffs. The big
three of their front line, Daryl
Frigia, captain Rick Turner, and
Everard Hughes, did most of the
scoring again.
Cardenal won the freshman
league championship by beating
Rinconada in overtime 66-61 and
whipping Trancos 51-36. John
Simmons was the leading scorer in
both contests with 22 and 16,
while Ray Dempsey backed him
up with 15 and 13.
Guy Smythe set the single game
scoring record for this livl season
as he pumped in 44 to lead the
sixth-ranked Langdon Five to a
105-27 victory over Biz
Independents.

Bob Dunham scored 20 points
and Bob Hoy 17 as El Toro beat
El Tigre to win the Eating Club
Championship.
Second-ranked KA won their
league by defeating the Defending
Champs (Dekes) 66-35. Center
Greg Bruce led the KA scoring
with 22 and slick-shooting guard,
Stu Boyd, added another 19.
The FBI has again been called
in to investigate gambling charges
- this time made against the
Spoiler "B" team After winning
their first game by a score of
25-22, they lost their second one
39-18 surprising everyone! Gone
was the finesse and sure-shooting
previously observed - in its place
weird shooting and dribbling
styles (never seen before on the
Im courts) were exhibited.
Special FBI agents have
confiscated the game films and are
examining them to see if the
styles are for real! A report is due
next week, it will either be filed
with the US Senate
Sub-committee on Gambling or
the Redwood City home for the
Physically Retarded.

Guy Smythe set the single game
scoring record for this livl season
as he pumped in 44 to lead the
sixth-ranked Langdon Five to a
105-27 victory over Biz
Independents.

Bob Dunham scored 20 points
and Bob Hoy 17 as El Toro beat
El Tigre to win the Eating Club
Championship.
Second-ranked KA won their
league by defeating the Defending
Champs (Dekes) 66-35. Center
Greg Bruce led the KA scoring
with 22 and slick-shooting guard,
Stu Boyd, added another 19.
The FBI has again been called
in to investigate gambling charges
- this time made against the
Spoiler "B" team After winning
their first game by a score of
25-22, they lost their second one
39-18 surprising everyone! Gone
was the finesse and sure-shooting
previously observed - in its place
weird shooting and dribbling
styles (never seen before on the
Im courts) were exhibited.
Special FBI agents have
confiscated the game films and are
examining them to see if the
styles are for real! A report is due
next week, it will either be filed
with the US Senate
Sub-committee on Gambling or
the Redwood City home for the
Physically Retarded.
