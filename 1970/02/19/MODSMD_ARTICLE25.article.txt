## Rain Halts Baseball 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
Will the baseball team ever lose
again?
That's the question currently
on the minds of Indian fans
everywhere as Stanford's varsity
contingent prepares this week for
a three-game weekend series
against Cal Poly of Pomona.
The Tribe plays at 2 p.m.
Friday then returns to Sunken
Diamond for a double-header
starting at noon on Saturday.

After last weekend's games
with the San Luis Obispo branch
of Cal Poly the Indians still
haven't lost, while winning six
times. Tuesday's game at UC
Davis was called off due to rain
and wet grounds.
But maybe Davis was just
scared.
After all, Coach Ray Young's
squad is a pretty formidable
baseball machine these days.
Dexterous Collectivity?
Not only has the pitching been
pretty good, as was expected, but
the fielders and hitters have been
performing with a collective
dexterity usually reserved to
teams of championship caliber.
Could it be that the Cards are
decked out like that?
Those of you who were around
last season will remember that the
Indians didn't really begin to hit
the ball until halfway through the
season. In fact, up until a May
road trip to Washington and
Oregon Stanford's offense was
just a little more potent than Phil
Reagan's fastball.
But this year things are
different.
Try this for starters: thus far
Stanford has connected for four
(count 'em) four home runs. No
one really wants to look il up, but
last year the Tribe didn't hit for
the circuit more than once in
something like the first 1 2 games.
So far this season, though,
Steve Dunning, Mike Nelson, Dave
Edson and Jack Lynn have all
homered once. It's getting to the

point where a four-bagger doesn't
even assure a place in the lineup.
After his two-run blow to right
field in the fifth inning of
Saturday's first game, Lynn was
removed for a pinch hitter his
next time up and spent the time
between games of the twin bill
raking the infield.
Such is performance rewarded
in this long ball era.
Two Hit .500
In other departments, Sandy
Swanson leads the Tribe with two
doubles, along with a triple.
Among the regulars, Lynn and
Jim Coate are hitting .500, Hank
Snider's at .400, and Swanson is
hitting .385. Others are Edson
(.357), who's tying with Dick
Borchers for the short-top spot,
Nelson (.313) and Bob Reech
(.300).
Young continues to platoon
heavily, in a constant effort to
find out who's best where. In fact,
as one comic asserted yesterday,
the only guy who has his position
nailed down is third base coach
Tom Dunton. Of course, we could
always use him over at first. . .
On another baseball front,
Coach Jim Jones' Brave team is
keeping up with the varsity pace
with a perfect 5-0 record. The
frosh-soph team has begun a 40
game schedule with wins over
Gavilan J.C. (6-0), Foothill J.C.
(6-3), De Anza J.C. (6-4), Cabrillo
J.C. and Diablo Valley J.C. (6-1).
Jones is getting good hitting
from Mike Leathers, Tim Wilson,
Rod Boone and John Day.


WHAT?—With wet grounds interfering with inid-week action, conjecture is raised as to just how good Stanford's baseball
team-party reflected a hove by this collection of bodies during better weather—really is. USC Coach Ron Dedeaux was
unavailable for comment.

In other departments, Sandy
Swanson leads the Tribe with two
doubles, along with a triple.
Among the regulars, Lynn and
Jim Coate are hitting .500, Hank
Snider's at .400, and Swanson is
hitting .385. Others are Edson
(.357), who's tying with Dick
Borchers for the short-top spot,
Nelson (.313) and Bob Reech
(.300).
Young continues to platoon
heavily, in a constant effort to
find out who's best where. In fact,
as one comic asserted yesterday,
the only guy who has his position
nailed down is third base coach
Tom Dunton. Of course, we could
always use him over at first. . .
On another baseball front,
Coach Jim Jones' Brave team is
keeping up with the varsity pace
with a perfect 5-0 record. The
frosh-soph team has begun a 40
game schedule with wins over
Gavilan J.C. (6-0), Foothill J.C.
(6-3), De Anza J.C. (6-4), Cabrillo
J.C. and Diablo Valley J.C. (6-1).
Jones is getting good hitting
from Mike Leathers, Tim Wilson,
Rod Boone and John Day.


WHAT?—With wet grounds interfering with inid-week action, conjecture is raised as to just how good Stanford's baseball
team-party reflected a hove by this collection of bodies during better weather—really is. USC Coach Ron Dedeaux was
unavailable for comment.
Will the baseball team ever lose
again?
That's the question currently
on the minds of Indian fans
everywhere as Stanford's varsity
contingent prepares this week for
a three-game weekend series
against Cal Poly of Pomona.
The Tribe plays at 2 p.m.
Friday then returns to Sunken
Diamond for a double-header
starting at noon on Saturday.

After last weekend's games
with the San Luis Obispo branch
of Cal Poly the Indians still
haven't lost, while winning six
times. Tuesday's game at UC
Davis was called off due to rain
and wet grounds.
But maybe Davis was just
scared.
After all, Coach Ray Young's
squad is a pretty formidable
baseball machine these days.
Dexterous Collectivity?
Not only has the pitching been
pretty good, as was expected, but
the fielders and hitters have been
performing with a collective
dexterity usually reserved to
teams of championship caliber.
Could it be that the Cards are
decked out like that?
Those of you who were around
last season will remember that the
Indians didn't really begin to hit
the ball until halfway through the
season. In fact, up until a May
road trip to Washington and
Oregon Stanford's offense was
just a little more potent than Phil
Reagan's fastball.
But this year things are
different.
Try this for starters: thus far
Stanford has connected for four
(count 'em) four home runs. No
one really wants to look il up, but
last year the Tribe didn't hit for
the circuit more than once in
something like the first 1 2 games.
So far this season, though,
Steve Dunning, Mike Nelson, Dave
Edson and Jack Lynn have all
homered once. It's getting to the

point where a four-bagger doesn't
even assure a place in the lineup.
After his two-run blow to right
field in the fifth inning of
Saturday's first game, Lynn was
removed for a pinch hitter his
next time up and spent the time
between games of the twin bill
raking the infield.
Such is performance rewarded
in this long ball era.
