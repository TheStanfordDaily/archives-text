# ROTC Protest
## Radicals Face Ramey 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Stanford radicals interrogated
the Army ROTC commander and
stapled anti-ROTC petitions to
the door of the Office of the
President during a series of
demonstrations yesterday
afternoon.
Approximately 90 students
entered the ROTC headquarters
building as participants in a tour
of campus ROTC facilities. About
50 of the group continued to the
second floor where Colonel
Stanley Ramey, commander of
Stanford's Army ROTC program,
was standing in a doorway at the
end of one hall.
"Sweeney [Mike Sweeney,
editor of Chaparral ] came in and
introduced himself and asked if I
would answer questions," Ramey
said afterwards. "I saw no reason
not to do so."
The questioning, led by
Sweeney and Lenny Siegel, lasted
ten minutes. Sweeney fired one of
the first questions, "Could you
tell me how many Stanford
students are trapped in the ROTC
program because of the so-called
'punitive clauses' in their
contracts?"
'We Discuss It'
Speaking calmly, Ramey
answered, "If they want out, they
come in and see me and we
discuss it. A few have asked to get
out."
"If the draft was repealed
today, how many would quit?"
continued Sweeney.
"I don't know. You'd have to
ask the cadets themselves,"
Ramey replied.
Siegel asked, "Do you feel that
the University, in allowing ROTC
on campus, is lending institutional
support to the war in Vietnam?"
"No," answered Ramey.
He later contended that
training officers involved no moral
question. "At this time in our
history trained officers are needed
to maintain our armed forces and

preserve the security of our
country," he explained.
'A Bunch of S latent cuts'
"It was not really a question
and answer session," Ramey
commented later. "They simply
made a bunch of statements."
No property was damaged
inside the building by the radicals,
although someone wrote
"Vietnam" in red paint over a sign
outside.
Ramey said his department
would take no action against the
demonstrators.
A noon rally in White Plaza
began the anti-ROTC protests.
Approximately 150 people
listened to speakers Bruce
Franklin and Art Busse tell of
their experiences in and with
ROTC.
Franklin, a former ROTC Air
Force officer, stated "ROTC is
not to be evaluated on an
academic basis, or even a moral
basis, but on a political one.
Which side are you going to be
on: that of the exploiters and
oppressors of poor peoples all
over the world, or that of the
exploited and the oppressed?"
FCM Competition
While Franklin was speaking,
about fourteen members of the
conservative Free Campus
Movement (FCM) entered White
Plaza with FCM leader Harvey
Hukari. During Busse's speech,
Hukari mounted the small wall in
front of the post office and, with
the aid of the megaphone,
competed for the attention of the
spectators.
Hukari said the libertarians on
campus "could care less whether
ROTC continues on
campus . . . our University
prostituted itself to the federal
government to the tune of 44
million dollars last year. That sum
includes 15 million dollars from
the Department of Defense."
Hukari stated that he felt this
money was ''equally

blood-soaked" and that his
organization would work to "kick
the federal government totally off
campus."
Rally Ends
While Hukari was speaking, the
radical rally ended. Many of the
spectators moved to President
Kenneth Pitzer's office in the
Inner Quad, where the protestors
hoped to present Pitzer with
anti-ROTC petitions that have
been circulating for several weeks.
Almost 200 spectators,
including the radicals, the
conservatives and curious
bystanders, gathered in front of
the President's office. The radicals
were met by Dean of Students
Peter Bulkeleywho told them that
Pitzer was not there and that the
door to the office was locked. He
offered to give the petitions to
Pitzer himself.
Sweeney and D. McGuire then
stapled the petitions to the door
of the President's office.
Two black students and three
whites, at least one of whom is a
member of FCM, quarrelled
briefly in front of ROTC
headquarters after the crowd had
dispersed. The incident involved
threats and name calling. No
blows were struck.
The radicals and conservatives
then moved to ROTC
headquarters. There Steve
McChrystal led the students on a
tour of the offices and armory
The afternoon of demonstrations
ended with a promise by Siegel
that "more tours of this kind
would be conducted."
