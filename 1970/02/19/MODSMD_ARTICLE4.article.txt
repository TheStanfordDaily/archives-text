## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) â€” Five political
activists were convicted by a
federal jury Wednesday of coming
to Chicago to incite riots at the
time of the 1968 Democratic
National Convention.
Those five and two fellow
defendants were acquitted of
conspiring to plot the bloody
violence that took place in
Chicago's streets and parks during
the final week of August 1968.
David T. Dellinger, 54; Jerry C.
Rubin, 31; Thomas E. Hayden,
30; Abbott "Abbie" Hoffman, 31,
and Rennard C. Davis, 29, were
found guilty of crossing state lines
to encourage riotmaking speeches

to various rallies during the
convention week.
Each man could be sentenced
to a maximum of five years in
prison and fined $10,000. There is
no established minimum
punishment.
John R. Froines, 31, and Lee
Weiner, 31, were found innocent
on the conspiracy count and a
second count charging them with
teaching the use of an incendiary
device. The government charged
in the five-month trial that
Froines and Weiner plotted to fire
bomb an under ground garage in
Grant Park.
Weiner and Froines could not

be charged with crossing state
lines to come to Chicago during
1968 and Froines, a resident of
Eugene, Ore., was spending the
summer with his in-laws who live
in Chicago.
The U.S. District Court jury of
10 women and two men returned
its verdict shortly after noon,
ending four days of deliberations
and bringing the bitter,
tuhultuous and ofter raucous trial
to its legal conclusion.
Judge Julius J. Hoffman of U.S.
District Court did not set a date
for sentencing.
He also denied freedom on
bond to the five convicted
defendants, saying: "I find the
men in this trial too dangerous to
be at large "
The five convicted and their
two codefendants are being held
in the Cook County-Chicago-jail
on sentences ranging from 2 l h
months to 2 X A years for contempt.
Judge Hoffman imposed the
contempt penalties Saturday and
Sunday, immediately after the
jurors retired to reach a verdict.
Lawyers Sentenced
The judge also sentenced
defense lawyer William M.
Kunstler to four years and 13
days for contempt, and his
colleague, Leonard I. Weinglass, to
20 months and five days.
Both lawyers are free, however,
because the judge stayed
commitment of their sentences to
may 4
A legal team representing the
two lawyers plans to file a brief
with the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of
Appeals by Thursday.
The verdict was the first legal
test of the antiriot provision of
the 1968 Civil Rights Act. The
law makes it possible to indict
persons on a charge of crossing
state lines with the intent to incite
a riot.
Strict security was enforced
during the reading of the verdicts.
Jurors Shaken
Two of the jurors were visibly
shaken during the reading of the
verdicts and the subsequent
one-by-one polling of the jury
requested by the defense.
Mrs. Jean Fritz quivered and
was hardly audible when she
stood to affirm her decision. Miss
Kay S. Richards 23, the youngest
of the jurors, wavered and her
voice was broken when she
affirmed the verdict.
Foran told newsmen after the
verdict: "I think the verdict
proves what has been under attack
in this case, that system works.
Here was a jury that worked a
long time."
