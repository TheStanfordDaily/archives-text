# Stanford Law Prof To Defend "7" Lawyers
## 
### JOHN ECKHOUSE 
Anthony Amsterdam, Stanford
Law School professor, will assist
in the defense of the "Chicago 7"
and their lawyers on the contempt
of court sentences handed out by
U.S. District Court Judge Julius J.
Hoffman.
Morton Stavis heads the group
of seven prominent lawyers
working on the contempt phase of
the case. Amsterdam commented
that, "Mort and I have made it a
business of representing lawyers
who get into trouble."
Professor Amsterdam refused
to comment on the conspiracy
case itself or the verdict reached
yesterday, saying "I don't really
know enough of the underlying
trial."
He did explain that his group
plans to file an appeal today in
the 7th Circuit Court to release all
seven of the defendants on bail.
Presently the defendants are in jail
because Judge Hoffman has
refused them bail, calling them
"dangerous men to have at large."
"Quick action on the appeals
process" is expected when the
motion is heard by a panel of
three judges. Amsterdam gave five
possible grounds for appeal.
-"Hoffman was so personally
involved in the case that he should
not have sat in judgment on these
men."
-As a general rule, a judge
should not rule on contempt
charges "even if he has kept his
cool."
-"The cumulative sentences are
far in excess of those that can be
handed out without a jury trial."
iioi.nnan acted without a
formal processâ€”he probably has
no power to act on contempt
charges after the trial. If the
action was an obstruction to
justice during the trial, then that
was the only proper time to rule
on this matter. Can it be shown
that the action was actually
contemptuous?
Although naturally reticent to
speak of his personal feelings
about the case, since "lawyers do

not get outraged at subjects
already in court,"the law
professor offered some general
observations. Noting that "the
performance of the judicial
system is at question," he believes
that "this kind of trial makes a
mockery of the American system
of trials."
"A purpose of the trial is to set
an example that the type of
activity conducted by these
people will not be tolerated."
Amsterdam feels however, that
there will be "no cessation" of
this sort of political-type of trial.
Professor Amsterdam will
probably join the defense in
Chicago in the near future unless
his work in three cases before the
Supreme Court interfers.
Today at 4 p.m. in the Law
School, room 161, the Stanford
chapter of the National Lawyer's
Guild will hold a rally to protest
the Chicago conspiracy trial.
Speakers will include Anthony
Amsterdam, Vincent Blasi,
professor of constitutional law,
Steve Weissman of the Pacific
Studies Center, and Doron
Weinberg of the regional office of
the Guild.
A student member of each
trustee, presidential, and academic
council committee will speak
briefly this afternoon at 4:15 in
trisidder 270 about what his
committee hits done thus far and
what he expects it will consider
before the end of the year.
Organized by ASSU Council of
Presidents member John Grube,
the purpose of the meeting is to
give all students an idea of how
they are being represented on
these committees, and to allow
any students to make suggestions
or criticisms to student members.
Written reports are also being
collected from students on
university committees. They will
be available to any student
interested in the work of the
committees and will be used next
year to help familiarize
prospective applicants with the
responsibilities of the various
committees.
