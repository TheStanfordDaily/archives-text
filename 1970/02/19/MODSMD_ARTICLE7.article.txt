# Pitzer On The Spot
## Unanswered Questions 
### 
After his speech Tuesday,
President Pitzer refused to answer
questions and walked off the
stage. This list of Some
Questions for Pitzer" had been
distributed to the audience earlier
by members of the New
Moratorium and Grass Roots.
ROTC
1. You say that you oppose the
Vietnam War. Do you really think
that U.S. imperialism will be
stopped as long as universities
support ROTC and give the
government ana corporations the
research they need to continue
domination of the Third World?
2. You decided to boyco
Brigham Young University
because of its racism. Don't you
think Stanford should boycott the
U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force
because of their racism, fascism,
genocide and brazen attempts to
dictate policy to this university?
3. You said last week that "no
constructive purpose" could be
served by a forum on ROTC. Why
won't you allow the people of this
community to ask you questions
about your controversial decisions
on ROTC?
4. The excuse you have
sometimes given for continued
complicity with the Defense
Department and continued
development of university lands
for Defense production is the
financial squeeze on the

university. Isn't the Vietnam War
budget squeeze the major cause of
the university's problem?
Shouldn't the university withdraw
its support for the war?
LAND DEVELOPMENT
1. A survey last month showed
that 81 percent of Palo Alto
residents don't want more
industry. Last week 600 Barron
Park residents signed petitions
asking for a moratorium on the
Dillingham project, which will
endanger their neighborhood. The
Committee for Green Foothills
has filed a lawsuit against the
Coyote Hill excavation, because it
was not legally approved by the
Palo Alto City government. Will
you put a moratorium on the
Dillingham project and Coyote
Hill before more leases are signed?
2. Stanford's 1969 financial
report says that a direct federal
subsidy for each student's tuition
is the ONLY long-term way to
meet the financial needs of private
universities. If that's so, why
should Stanford do PERMANENT
harm to the Mid-Peninsula
environment by overdevelopment,
in order to add a relatively small
amount of money to the
endowment?
WORKERS
1. Why have you given NO
representation on the Wright
Housing Committee to Stanford
workers or other people from the
surrounding community?

2. Why have you refused to
bargain with the Teamsters Union
after most of the physical plant
employees indicated their desire
to form a local?
3. Why have you claimed that
Stanford is "doing something"
about the shortage of low-cost
housing when you continue land
development that will bring 6,000
more employees into the housing
market? Will you accept the
United Stanford Employees
request for a commitment to
2,500 units of low-cost housing
on Stanford land?
