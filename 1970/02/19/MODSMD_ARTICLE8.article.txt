# SUN Fund Drive
## Give To Show Commitment 
### 
Students are surprised to be
asked for gifts to Stanford. The
boola-boola spirit of dear old alma
mater is a thing of the past.
This is probably all to the good,
because it allows people to get
down to the realities of University
funding and to the problem of
putting your money where your
mouth is.
What is right with Stanford?
Do you think Stanford ought
to continue positive, aggressive
scholarship aid to members of
ethnic minorities? Do you think
students should be able to initiate
courses and directed reading
programs through the new Center

for Innovation and Research for
Education? That Stanford should
seriously engage in major
academic innovation for the years
to come? Do you think the light
bills in classrooms ought to be
paid and the University should
have as many useful books on
library shelves as possible?
A lot of people still believe
Stanford is unthinkably rich, and
that our tuition pays for what we
get. This dreamy belief may have
been an acceptable delusion in the
days of paternalism, but it doesn't
make sense anymore.
Tuition at Stanford makes uu
about 37 percent of the sources ol

educational income today. 1 he
rest of the money comes from
endowment income (including
land development), federal
support for educational programs,
and private gifts and grants.
We feel the pinch of rising costs
reflected in our own tuition.
Many students want the
University to become more
independent of government
support and to weigh the value of
land development income against
other consequences of such
development. What does this Ic-ave
to support the increasing cost of
education? It leaves gifts.
Stanford does not have direct
problems with an unsympathetic
governor or hostile state
taxpayers, but this relative
autonomy is gained only through
the commitment of many
concerned people to have given to
Stanford and do so now.
And the hard fact is that even
with increased tuition and the
belt-tightening program, inflation
and cutbacks in federal support of
higher education mean that
Stanford has already dipped into
reserve funds to run the
University.
Those of us who organized the
SUN program believe students can
do something directly for the
students who will follow us here.

We believe that in addition to
debating issues the time has come
for us to talk priorities with the
kind of commitment that includes
helping the University survive and
improve. The kind ol
commitment that includes
supporting financially NOW the
aspects of the University we
particularly value.
This week SUN program sent
letters to all students asking for
gifts to the Martin Luther King,
Jr. Scholarship Fund at Stanford
(for scholarship aid to members of
ethnic minority groups); The
Innovation Fund (for projects in
academic innovation at Stanford);
and Unrestricted (for general
University use); in the last few
years these funds have bought
books, paid professors' salaries
and supported non-federally
sponsored research.
You can get more details about
these options and about
University finance in general at
the panel discussions in the dorms
this week. They're listed in Once
Around the Quad.
Most of us can't give immense
sums to these purposes. But we
can give $5 or $20 to keep this
institution moving forward and to
thereby affect directly the lives of
the students who will lollow us.

University.
Those of us who organized the
SUN program believe students can
do something directly for the
students who will follow us here.

We believe that in addition to
debating issues the time has come
for us to talk priorities with the
kind of commitment that includes
helping the University survive and
improve. The kind ol
commitment that includes
supporting financially NOW the
aspects of the University we
particularly value.
This week SUN program sent
letters to all students asking for
gifts to the Martin Luther King,
Jr. Scholarship Fund at Stanford
(for scholarship aid to members of
ethnic minority groups); The
Innovation Fund (for projects in
academic innovation at Stanford);
and Unrestricted (for general
University use); in the last few
years these funds have bought
books, paid professors' salaries
and supported non-federally
sponsored research.
You can get more details about
these options and about
University finance in general at
the panel discussions in the dorms
this week. They're listed in Once
Around the Quad.
Most of us can't give immense
sums to these purposes. But we
can give $5 or $20 to keep this
institution moving forward and to
thereby affect directly the lives of
the students who will lollow us.
The time is NOW.
Students are surprised to be
asked for gifts to Stanford. The
boola-boola spirit of dear old alma
mater is a thing of the past.
This is probably all to the good,
because it allows people to get
down to the realities of University
funding and to the problem of
putting your money where your
mouth is.
What is right with Stanford?
Do you think Stanford ought
to continue positive, aggressive
scholarship aid to members of
ethnic minorities? Do you think
students should be able to initiate
courses and directed reading
programs through the new Center

for Innovation and Research for
Education? That Stanford should
seriously engage in major
academic innovation for the years
to come? Do you think the light
bills in classrooms ought to be
paid and the University should
have as many useful books on
library shelves as possible?
A lot of people still believe
Stanford is unthinkably rich, and
that our tuition pays for what we
get. This dreamy belief may have
been an acceptable delusion in the
days of paternalism, but it doesn't
make sense anymore.
Tuition at Stanford makes uu
about 37 percent of the sources ol

educational income today. 1 he
rest of the money comes from
endowment income (including
land development), federal
support for educational programs,
and private gifts and grants.
We feel the pinch of rising costs
reflected in our own tuition.
Many students want the
University to become more
independent of government
support and to weigh the value of
land development income against
other consequences of such
development. What does this Ic-ave
to support the increasing cost of
education? It leaves gifts.
Stanford does not have direct
problems with an unsympathetic
governor or hostile state
taxpayers, but this relative
autonomy is gained only through
the commitment of many
concerned people to have given to
Stanford and do so now.
And the hard fact is that even
with increased tuition and the
belt-tightening program, inflation
and cutbacks in federal support of
higher education mean that
Stanford has already dipped into
reserve funds to run the
University.
