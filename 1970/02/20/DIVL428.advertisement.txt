INTERESTED IN PURSUING THE THOUGHT
OF MARTIN BUBER, MYSTICISM, OR OTHER
TOPICS OF JEWISH INTEREST
IN AN INFORMAL SETTING?
I would like to form one or more informal seminars which
would meet to study and discuss some Jewish topic to be
decided upon by its members. These seminars would be very
hang-loose, without the burden of units, grades, etc. Hope
fully, we would learn something about Judaism, while at the
same time developing a sense of friendship and community
among the participating individuals. If you are interested
and would like to participate, please come to an organiza
tional meeting at The Clubhouse, 3rd floor lounge, on Monday,
February 16th at 7:30 p.m. If you are unable to attend and
would like to participate or to suggest ideas, please call Jane
Rubin at 327-2920 X 332.
