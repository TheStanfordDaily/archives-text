Stare at your walls.
Ycu might learn something for a change.
Something about learning and change. Thinking and
participating. Even about film-making and quantum
physics. It's not done with mirrors but with charts.
Three of them.
It's asking a lot of three charts to undo all the harm done
by university education. You have to undo most of it.
But the charts can help.
The charts, and an accompanying handbook (to ease your
transition from print) now comprise a BLUEPRINT FOR
COUNTER EDUCATION. The liberated chart watcher sees
before him the crisis of western civilization in a pattern of
names, concepts and events configured around the most
radical members of today's intellectual and artistic
vanguard—from Marcuse and McLuhan to Eldridge Cleaver
and John Lennon. From there on, everything becomes
self-evident. Or unintelligible.
Maurice Stein and Larry Miller, who created the charts,
are two deeply committed radicals now affiliated with the
California Institute of the Arts in Los Angeles. Marshall
Henrichs, who designed them, is now making a movie of
his own screenplay. Where are you?
3 wall charts, 37 l A" x 45" each, plus 192 page handbook,
packed in slipcase.
