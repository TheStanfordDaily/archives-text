# As Vote Nears
## Faculty ROTC Views Range Widely 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
The Academic Senate is slated
to reconsider the status of ROTO
on campus within two weeks.
Arguments for and against ROTC
are varied, diverse, and
exceedingly complex; and both
practical and philosophical
differences threaten to split the
faculty in much the same manner
as last spring's voting.
On January 22, the Senate
voted to allow Army ROTC unit
credit for courses approved by the
(...jmmittee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS). That action will be
reconsidered at a special meeting
of the Academic Council on
March 2.
Many view the Faculty Senate
vote as a reversal of last year's
decision and are angry. But,
I.iilosophy Prof. Philip
Rhinelander sees the new proposal
as an option that did not exist last
year. "The possibility of a
mechanism which would give
selective credit to ROTC courses
under University auspices was not
onen a year ago," he argues.
Objections Dispute
"Since the middle option was
worked out this year, we thought
that nothing could be lost by
trying it."
Prof. Stephen Kline,
Mechanical Engineering, also feels
I hat the Senate's vote does not
i -verse last year's decision, but
rather, follows fairly closely what
was asked for. Kline points out
that the University now has the
final decision the course content,

not the Department of Defense;
that the ROTC instructors will no
longer be members of the faculty;
and that military studies will no
longer be a distinct department.
"The major objections," says
Kline, "have been met."
But 13 members of the Faculty
Senate-14, if one includes
Chemistry Professor Lawrence
Altman, who walked out of the
meeting before the vote was
taken, think that the major
objections have not been met.
Those who voted against the
ROTC proposal view the intention
of last year's vote as allowing
ROTC on campus only as a
non-credit, extra-curricular
activity. They see the recent vote
as a clear reversal.
Logic Questioned
Economics Prof. Alan Manne,
former Chairman of Pres. Pitzer's
Advisory Committee on ROTC,
notes that last year's Academic
Council referendum offered the
option of allowing the
administration to negotiate
flexibly with the Department of
Defense on academic credit, but
the faculty voted instead to deny
academic credit. The decision of
last year, he claims, was definite
and inflexible, and did not allow
for the negotiations which the
Administration subsequently
conducted.
Manne said, "You would have
to go through some kind of
Alice-in-Wonderland logic to see
this as anything but a reversal of
last year's decision."

Reversal or not, what many see
as the major question is the power
of an externam agency, ROTC, to
prescribe the curriculum of
University courses. Arthur
Hastings, Asst. Professor of
Speech, believes that the
University should not have
outside entities involved in its
educational structure. "ROTC is a
branch of the armed services; it
does not offer the kind of
academic program that is
appropriate for the university," he
says.
Yes Or No Approval
Prof. Altman agrees with this
objection, as do most of the
others who voted against the
proposal. He feels that, "If ROTC
courses were taught—really
taught, not just sponsored—by
normal members of the faculty,
and if the iniative and control of
these courses came from within
Stanford, then I could not object
to credit for ROTC. But the mere
yes-or-no approval of course
content doesn't give us sufficient
control over courses which are
still drawn up by an outside
agency."
A majority of Faculty Senate

members clearly feel that the
mechanism for evaluation of
courses in the proposal does give
the University sufficient control.
Prof. Paul Berg of Mathematics
claims that a major element in last
year's vote to ban all credit for
ROTC courses was the inability to
evaluate the courses and
determine which deserve credit.

News Analysis

Professor of Surgery Roy Cohn
attacks as "absurd" the argument
that the University should have
control over the content of ROTC
courses. He notes that the state
prescribes the course content for
all licensed professional—i.e.
doctors and lawyers—and
therefore he sees nothing
objectionable about it prescribing
the content of military training
courses.
Civilian Instructors?
Some members of the minority
find fault with the specific
mechanism for evaluation of the
ROTC courses. "To ask the
Committee on Undergraduate

Studies to administer courses of
this type is to ask for continual
headaches, and to politicize the
tasks of that committee," Manne
argues.
Another argument that has
been raised is whether the ROTC
classes should be taught by
military personnel. Economics
Professor Moses Abramovitz bases
his major objection to the present
ROTC proposal on the belief that
they should not. "ROTC
instructors," he sayd, "would still
be nominated by the Army and be
under the supervision of the
Department of Defense. This is
not consistent with the normal
University standards for selection
of faculty, nor is it consistent
with faculty independence and
excellence."
Cohn vehemently disagrees. His
argument: "Our faculty isn't so
great that some military men
might not be the equal, if not the
superior, of some of our faculty
members. We can profit a lot by
teaching methods developed in
the military; they, in fact, have
paid a lot more attention to
teaching methods than the

University has."
Ilu manizing Effect
An argument of some who
voted for the ROTC proposal is
that by keeping the ROTC
program, the University can have
a humanizing affect on the
military. Prof. David Potter,
History, believes that ROTC has
been "a factor in maintaining the
tradition of civilians in the armed
forces. This is a tradition worth
preserving."
Rhinelander posits that "the
views of the University must be
brought to bear on the military.
There is no hope of modifying the
military mind if one cuts off all
relations with it. Severing ties
with ROTC may result in a
stiffening of military blindness."
Prof. Ronald Rebholz, English,
criticizes this view. Rebholz said,
"It is ludicrous to expect that a
civilian component produced by
ROTC will have an impact on
Army policy."
Punitive (llauso
Perhaps the most volatile issue
related to ROTC is the punitive
clause in the individual contracts.


ROTC PSYCHE-"There is no hope of
modifying the military mind if one

cuts off all relations with it," says
Prof. Philip Rhinclander.
These punitive provisions threaten
an ROTC student with active duty
_ as an enlisted man if he drops out
of the four year scholarship
program during the last two years.
History professor Phillip
I Dawson sees the continuation of
the punitive clause as his major
objection to the ROTC proposal.
He said that there is "no
obligation for the University to
give credit to ROTC as long as the
punitive clause remains in the
contracts."
It will take an act of Congress
to eliminate the punitive clauses
from the contracts, but what
Dawson finds particularly
troublesome is "the unwillingness
of the Army to even approach
Congress and request a change."
Lyman said, "Substantial and
demonstrable progress towards
resolving this proglem is essential
to the continuation of ROTC at
Stanford past next year."
Prof. Thomas Ehrlich of the
Law School, who drafted the
Pitzcr proposal, emphasized that
the punitive clause is one of his
very great reservations. "The
military's purpose could be
achieved without this kind of
sledge-hammer arrangement."
