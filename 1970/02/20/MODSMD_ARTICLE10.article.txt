# Fantastic Flyways Flight 44
## The 						Radicals And Wickenburg, Ariz. 
### Nick Selby 
I had the strange privilege this last weekend
of visiting the quaint hamlet of Wickenburg,
Ariz., a town of some 2,000 arch-conservative
retirees about 60 miles northwest of Phoenix.
Wickenburg appears on top of the
Haciampa River, which goes underground
several miles above the city. Haciampa, an old
Navajo word, means upside-down. And truly,
in the radicals' world view, Wickenburg is as
upside-down a place as any radical, in his
worst nightmare, could ever imagine.
The people who live there and in the many
towns like it have gone there for an escape
from the hassle and concerns of living in the
twentieth century. They abhor the radicals
and the concerns they stand for. They are
tired of being known as fascists and
lucre-seeking bourgeois.
'Who is Kldridge Cleaver?'
Here, not in the midwest, is the
conservative heartland of America. The people
still young enough to fight are probably
training with the Minutemen for the final
confrontation with everyone to the right of
their idols, Spiro and Barry.
The doctor of the town, a kindly fellow a
few years out of medical school, one you
might expect to be well-informed, has never
even heard of Eldridge Cleaver, by his own
confession.
To expect the rest of the town, and much
of America like it, to idolize Eldridge, Huey
Newton, or the Chicago Seven, is to expect
the second coming—something quite unlikely
in the near future.
It is more than obvious that we cannot
take the present political trends lightly. Never
before has the peril of going fascist
democratically been so great or so impending.
We must make our opposition to Nixon,
Mitchell, and Reagan, perhaps also President
Pitzer, the whole conservative clique, clear in
no uncertain terms.

But the tone of this opposition must be,
now much more than before, when to advise
caution was to invite the unpleasant epithet of
being a "liberal," very delicately handled.
Nixon's Support Grows
Unfortunately, I am afraid, that opposition
has lost practically every sign of delicacy and
personal warmth. One reads of riots in
Berkeley and Seattle, and one hears of
bombings in Berkeley and San Francisco, not
just of ROTC installations but of police
offices.
Imagine what it must be like for the
average middle class citizen, Nixon's
supporters, watching their six o'clock news
every night. All he sees is chaos and dissident
violence instigated by "those damn leftists."
It is hardly any wonder that the support for
Mitchell and Nixon grows every day. They
glory in that support.
And confident of their police power, sadly
all too real, they see radicals playing right into
their hands. They, least of all, feel threatened.
The old folk in Wickenburg and the silent
majority all across the land willingly grant
them all the fascist powers they desire.
The Depression Syndrome?
I may well have fallen prey to what Marc
Sapir aptly termed the depression syndrome,
which now seems to be quite prevalent among
the once inflamed Stanford students.
Perhaps the radicals here attribute this lack
of protest to apathy and/or fear. But it may
also be true that many students simply no
longer wish to go on seemingly innocent
protest marches through San Francisco or
Palo Alto only to be involved in rock
throwing, and utterly childish whoopee
sprees.
Few people in their mind will actually
believe that throwing rocks will crush the
political power of the right. A few bombs will

do little more than give the police stronger
arguments for greater armaments.
I am well aware that these comments may
invite only the highest disdain from the
radicals with whom I and many "average"
students like me worked last spring. Call it
wisdom, call it fear, call it what you will, but I
am no longer willing to go out on
rock-throwing parties.
There seems to be little choice—either one
attacks the establishment or he keeps quiet in
apathetic slumber. But I suspect there are
many students here who really do want to
make their projtest known, even if only
through some respectable (yes), non-violent
fashion, perhaps like last fall's Moratoirum
marches. The radicals are seemingly unwilling
to provide that alternative.
As long as there is not the slightest degree
of kindness or charity or warmth present in
the radical movement, most students will
continue to remain silent in their real,
hopeless despair about the social health of this
country.
Perhaps we who are presently uninvolved
in political actions are waiting for others to do
focus what we should be doing for ourselves.
But the question of "what shall I do?" is
rarely easily answered—it pervades this
campus like a malignant cloud.
The important thing to remember, perhaps
unfortunately, is that the right guard in
Wickenburg is watching and waiting, and they
and their moderate companions have the
power, however unjust, to crush us all unless
we take care not to arouse an even greater
backlash.
Sadly, it seems the backlash and
polarization bring us closer to disaster, and
farther from revolution or meaningful change,
every day.
