## Swastikas At Stanford 
### Ibn' Gawhar El-Mouhajihad 
. . . Let (the man) know that
when he puts his hands on you,
it's not only you he puts his hands
on, it's his whole house . . He will
only act right when you let him
know that you know he has more
to lose than you have . . .
Malcolm X
The rumor's probably got
around to you by now. And if it
hasn't—R.S.V.P.—let me inform
you all about it. Last week
swastikas were painted on the
doors of several Black co-eds
residing in Junipero dorm.
Along with it the edifying
phrase "KILL THE
PICKANINNIES" (A white
derogation used against Black
People). Some whites went about
with their mouths open when
they heard the news. But no news
is good news for Black People; so
save your energy, whitie: use your
jaw for EFFECT.
Swastikas at Stanford. A
Brother who had the idea of an
investigation crew—in the same
dorm—they tried—whomever our
THEY IS (We know,
incidentally ... so watch out!)
they tried to burn down the
Brother's door.
BUT THEY living on borrowed
time right now; and THEY ought
to know IT!
Swastikas at Stanford: No big
thing for Black People. They seen
swastikas painted over every
landscape in America from the
time of its foundation! So,
mothers, who you think you
scarin. You all better scare youself
into waking UP!
TO THIS: That one: YOU ON
BORROWED TIME;
That two: YOU AIN'T
dealin' with whity
radicals when you play
those little games.
That three: If that
swastikas meant that you
think WE in the same
position as the Jews of
Germany and you can
deal with us as such,
WATCH OUT. I
mean . . .
WATCH OUT: because then you
little games get played right into
REALITY: ONE THAT YOU
AIN'T GONNA LIKE; that's why
you better do one of two things:

pinch yourself and wake up or put
you money whery you mouth IS.
And the latter is a game that gets
played for keeps, hear!
It seems out of all the sleepy
atmosphere of the dorms, out of
all you cats out there dining with
candles and roses in dorm XXX, it
seems out of all this tomfoolery
of white people at Stanford only
one voice came in earnest, that is
from The Community Against
War and Fascism. They didn't
stand there look dutiful little
bookies with their mouths
hanging out: they pointed to the
vast repression being carried out
by the White Power Structure
against Black People, specifically
at this point, systematically at this
point, against The Black Panthers
in particular because they see the
roots and the necessities of this
thing called White America very
clearly. It's vested interest via
Capitalism in INSTITUTIONAL
RASCISM.
. So, swastikas at Stanford, since
you pulled out your cards in this
game, we'll pull out some!
Swastikas at Stanford: No big
thing really for Black People to
see. As I said they've seen it
before all over pasty-faced
America and they will continue to
see it. But now they've got a way
of dealing with in their own right.
Those painted little symbols
planted there by a bunch of
bourgeois shits exhibits only the
more that beneath the streamlined
sophistication of this institution
something's rotten—rotten to the
core. Something very white and
racist. That's for you liberALLS
who think you know it all.
Something very profound and
fascist. No matter how cool and
groovy.
Something very rotten like
what happened at Altamont The
Woostock of The West, The
Rollin' Stones' Let It Bleed. And
motherfucker bleed it DID.
Something very cool and
groovy sacrificed one of our
Brothers to the altar of Wotan,
the Teuton god.
Something very cool and
groovy murdered a Brother at that
concert while he was enjoying the
music. The motherfuckers aren't
caught yet. I hope but then I

don't that they get caught by the
Pigs FIRST. For their relatives
sake if they like to preserve the
bodie(s) I mean. But that was
Altamont. Not related you say?
Not related to Stanford?
WRONG! WRONG again! Not
related, eh? Just a practical dorm
joke eh? Weell the game get heavy
at times. You might find out
HOW heavy.
The purity-folded arms of the
state of Massachusetts officially
murdered for racial reasons two
Italian Communists in 1927 by
the name of Sacco and Vanzetti.
For racial reasons I'm telling you
secondarily that the feeble
American honkey mind knew
nothing about "communist."
Look in those letters, The Letters
Of Sacco and Vanzetti that
survive. A prefigurement of Huey
P. Newton. Look in and see, pure
Stanford, see how that "grabs
you." They, two immortal souls
are still unavenged.
Also our immortal souls are
still unavenged who made
America for you mister honey:
they made it on those lynching
trees—they built your country for
you out of that lynchin' wood:
that's the house you live in,
honkey. That's the table you sit at
with those candelabras—Liberace
style and munch you tidbits at
table. Remember that as part of
your game!
But DON'T BE SURPRISED,
DON'T BE SURPRISED, as our
ole sad song goes . . .
Black People would have never
gone to those ovens that way, the
way of German Jewery.
Remember that the next time you
want to paint some of your
honkey art-work. Remember that
when you see you game exposed.
Many-a tear-has-to fall-bul
it's-all-in-the game . . . Remember
you just playin' when you see
you self get real messed
up . . . Remember you playin' for
keeps and so are we when you
dare paint those signs again.
Because they ain't pointin' at us
they pointed at you: they make
you a marked man ... or
whatever . . .
