# One Woman's Opinion
## WL Program Not Convincing 
### Cathy Cooper 
If women in our society expect
to be liberated, they will have to
learn to be more intellectually
convincing than Amanda
Rutherford and Sandra Peters in
their Daily article entitled "A
Program for Liberation at
Stanford" (Daily, Feb. 16).
I would have to be either very
insensitive or dishonest not to
recognize that women have been
and still are discriminated against
in many areas of our society and
that open recognition and
discussion is necessary to perceive
men and women as humans rather
than as embodied sexual
sterotypes.
Nonetheless, sections of the
Women's Liberation Front
program as put forth in the
Rutherford-Peter article are
largely an emotional harangue
which fails to substantiate, justify
or develop its propositions.

The article refers to the 4000
women students, faculty and
employees and "untold numbers"
of wives who are directly
oppressed by Stanford. How, by
whom, and in what ways? Further
development is due to the
statement that Stanford graduates
are "trained in an atmosphere of
systematic oppression and
exploitation of women."
Such bald statements neither
convince those responsible for
oppression nor reflect favorably
on the liberated individuals who
make such flat assertions. To my
knowledge I have yet to be
oppressed or exploited. Or am I
oppressed by definition because I
don't realize that I am oppressed?
Many of the points under
"Employment" bear little or no
relation that I can see to the goal
of freeing us all from "artificial
and dehumanizing sex roles."
How is that aim connected with
an employee's union or minimum
wage? Moreover, why do women
need a job training center on
campus where they can "learn
skills to enable them to get a
decent job"? Are we not learning
that through University courses
where, presumably, men are
learning these skills? Must special
provision be made for us? Is that
parity with men?
I further fail to see why
Women's Liberation insists on free
health care for employees and
students of the University. How is
this related to sex roles and
oppression? Does the principal of
free health care provided by the
University extend to all other
employees? Under what rationale?

Under "Child Care" the
Women Liberation program calls
for the University to provide free
child care for children of all
employees and students and to
allow time off during the day for
parents to be with their children
Why must the University be
responsible for the children of
those connected with it? Are not
children the responsibility of the
parents?
We don't want the University
taking over other aspects of
raising our children like mora'
training. Then why day care? Why
can't the parent accept this
responsibility with out crying to
the University for help? In the
recognition that a woman has a
right to her own personal and
intellectual development we
should not brush aside he
responsibility to her children and
their development as people.
Women's Liberation does not
deal with the practical and
financial consequences of this
greatly expanded variety of
services to be offered th"
University community free or ai
reduced cost. Is something for
nothing their rallying cry? It is
intellectual cowardice to make
grandiose demands without
proposing how these demands are
to be met.
Women's Liberation seems to
want a womb-like existence,
insulated from shocks, adversity
or responsibility. Ask a man if
that's how it is in his world.

recognize that women have been
and still are discriminated against
in many areas of our society and
that open recognition and
discussion is necessary to perceive
men and women as humans rather
than as embodied sexual
sterotypes.
Nonetheless, sections of the
Women's Liberation Front
program as put forth in the
Rutherford-Peter article are
largely an emotional harangue
which fails to substantiate, justify
or develop its propositions.

The article refers to the 4000
women students, faculty and
employees and "untold numbers"
of wives who are directly
oppressed by Stanford. How, by
whom, and in what ways? Further
development is due to the
statement that Stanford graduates
are "trained in an atmosphere of
systematic oppression and
exploitation of women."
Such bald statements neither
convince those responsible for
oppression nor reflect favorably
on the liberated individuals who
make such flat assertions. To my
knowledge I have yet to be
oppressed or exploited. Or am I
oppressed by definition because I
don't realize that I am oppressed?
Many of the points under
"Employment" bear little or no
relation that I can see to the goal
of freeing us all from "artificial
and dehumanizing sex roles."
How is that aim connected with
an employee's union or minimum
wage? Moreover, why do women
need a job training center on
campus where they can "learn
skills to enable them to get a
decent job"? Are we not learning
that through University courses
where, presumably, men are
learning these skills? Must special
provision be made for us? Is that
parity with men?
I further fail to see why
Women's Liberation insists on free
health care for employees and
students of the University. How is
this related to sex roles and
oppression? Does the principal of
free health care provided by the
University extend to all other
employees? Under what rationale?

Under "Child Care" the
Women Liberation program calls
for the University to provide free
child care for children of all
employees and students and to
allow time off during the day for
parents to be with their children
Why must the University be
responsible for the children of
those connected with it? Are not
children the responsibility of the
parents?
We don't want the University
taking over other aspects of
raising our children like mora'
training. Then why day care? Why
can't the parent accept this
responsibility with out crying to
the University for help? In the
recognition that a woman has a
right to her own personal and
intellectual development we
should not brush aside he
responsibility to her children and
their development as people.
Women's Liberation does not
deal with the practical and
financial consequences of this
greatly expanded variety of
services to be offered th"
University community free or ai
reduced cost. Is something for
nothing their rallying cry? It is
intellectual cowardice to make
grandiose demands without
proposing how these demands are
to be met.
Women's Liberation seems to
want a womb-like existence,
insulated from shocks, adversity
or responsibility. Ask a man if
that's how it is in his world.

political science and a DAILY

If women in our society expect
to be liberated, they will have to
learn to be more intellectually
convincing than Amanda
Rutherford and Sandra Peters in
their Daily article entitled "A
Program for Liberation at
Stanford" (Daily, Feb. 16).
I would have to be either very
insensitive or dishonest not to
recognize that women have been
and still are discriminated against
in many areas of our society and
that open recognition and
discussion is necessary to perceive
men and women as humans rather
than as embodied sexual
sterotypes.
