## Toxin Ban Urged-And Won 
### Joshua Lederberg 
Last November 25, President
Nixon announced a major step in
U.S. policy concerning biological
weapons: XX they "have massive,
unpredictable, and uncontrollable
consequences. They may produce
global epidemics and impair the
health of future generations. The
U.S. shall renounce the use of
lethal biological agents and
weapons and all other methods of
biological warfare. The U.S. will
confine its biological research to
defensive measures such as
immunization and safety
measu res.''
The president also asked the
Senate to ratify the Geneva
protocol of 1925 which prohibits
the first use in war of chemical as
well as bacteriological weapons.
Many scientists, including
myself, have urged a still more
decisive initiative towards the
general prohibition of chemical
warfare research and
development. This was not done,
probably in the belief that the

Geneva protocol was a sufficient
step towards driving hard bargains
with the U.S.S.R. over a wide
range of disarmament issues. Thus
reflex orientation to the Soviets
should, I believe, be criticized for
it overlooks the greater threat to
our security from the lack of a
world system to control the
proliferation of cheap but nasty
and unreliable weapons among
smaller powers.
Sharp Debate
The president's statement has
now become the subject of a
sharp debate about its application
to toxins. These are complex
chemical compounds, often
proteins, which are produced by
many living organisms, including
infectious microbes. In some
diseases like food poisoning,
diphtheria or tetanus, an easily
isolated toxin plays a central part
in the lethal action of the
responsible bacteria.
In more subtle fashion, a toxin
is probably connected with every

infectious disease, but we do not
always know enough to be able to
isolate the crucial molecule. The
understanding of toxins is
obviously a central issue in disease
research.
Military research is also much
interested in toxins. Much has
been said about their enormous
potency, a half pound of
botulinus toxin "properly
distributed" would do in all of
North America. However, their
real attraction is the possibility of
immunizing the attacking forces
and their allies.
Our emotional revulsion against
such agents should not becloud
how we classify them, nor the
precise reasons to develop better
policies to deal with them. Toxins
are undoubtedly chemical
poisons, not living agents.
President Nixon's principal reason
for renouncing U.S. use of
biological agents, the
unpredictable chances of

epidemics outside the theater of
combat, does not apply to toxins.
Toxins via Industrial Processing
Toxins, nevertheless, are now
produced by industrial processes
that can hardly be distinguished
from the production of vaccines
or of bacteriological weapons. It
will be impossible to sustain the
credibility of our renunciation of
such weapons if we continue
secret research and pilot plant
development on toxins. Nor can
we visualize any system of
inspection or verification of
international agreements that
would expose bacteriological
work and leave toxins concealed.
This is not an argument to
redefine the sense of chemical
weaponry, which could have
serious side-effects in deterring
national leaders from stepwise
advances in policy. Rather, the
toxins present a special problem,
separate from biological weapons.
We will help make a safer world if
we set an example by eshewing
secret military work on the
production of toxins from
microbes, as well as the microbes
themselves.
The possibility also exists of
synthesizing known toxins, and
designing new ones, by
chemical methods. It will be an
un-happy day if we promulgate
that art by applying more energy
to developing the technology
than to vital global controls.
(Editor's note: One day after
this column ran in the Washington
Host, President Nixon announced
a ban on the development of
toxin weapons.)
