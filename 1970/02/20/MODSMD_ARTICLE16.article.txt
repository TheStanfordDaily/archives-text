Architecture Move Deplored
Editor, THE DAILY:
It seems incredible and absurd
that one of Stanford's most
innovative and least expensive
departments, Architecture, would
be deliberately restructured and
, eorganized to make it not only
less flexible but also more
expensive (by unit cost of courses
offered).
Such is the wisdom of
Stanford.
In the midst of the SUN fund
drive to support "Innovation In
Education" and its increasing
cost, Stanford unbelievably
demolishes exactly what it claims
to want: a flexible and
individualistic approach to credit,
courses, and creativity.
The fact that architectural
students were among the most
pleased, best educated (most had
little trouble in passing the state
architecture exams), and least
expensive of all students, seems to
be ignored in the greater
bureaucratization and obfuscation
of the learning process.

Reasons for ROTC
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a graduate of an established
ROTC program (at the University
of Rochester), I feel I must offer
my sincere opinions on this
controversial program.
First, I strongly object to the
assumption that ROTC students
are being trained to foment future
wars. Much of my ROTC training
was directed to the use of a
competent military force as a key
to international diplomacy and an
effective deterrent, not a menace,
to world conflict.
Second, the military
establishment desperately needs
officers from all educational
disciplines and a wide range of
collegiate settings. Only in this
atmosphere can the military hope
to be truly representative of the
country as a whole. This vital
civilian input serves as an excellent
balance to the traditional source
of olficers from the service
academies.
For example, I had the pleasure
of serving with several Harvard
graduates and found them to be
intelligent, energetic, and
resourceful officers. The Harvard

ROTC units are now defunct. Will
the military now also be deprived
of Stanford graduates who are
certainly as potentially capable as
their Eastern counterparts?
Third, I firmly believe a short
tour of military, particularly as an
officer, can be a valuable
experience for many individuals in
their early 20's. This statement
does not imply the necessity for
"firing line" experience. Service in
a peacetime military
establishment can go a long way
in developing maturity and
offering an J - indispensable
experience in leadership at an
early age.
Opponents of ROTC might
espouse the same advantages in
demonstrating against "the
Establishment," but I feel that
working within a large
organization and effecting change
through traditional channels is a
more constructive and challenging
task.
Fourth, as last year's resolution
stated, credit should be granted to
ROTC courses with "genuine
academic interest." I am currently
receiving credit for Golf and
Men's Glee Club. Is this any more
rational than denying credit for

worthwhile ROTC courses that
require daily class preparation and
exams?
Those opposed to credit for
ROTC cadets might note with
interest that approximately half
of the enrollment in the Navy's
Navigation class are civilian
students.
Fifth, in these times of "tight
money" for all educational
institutions, students and faculty
might ponder the possible effects
of eliminating ROTC scholarships
at Stanford. Those students
currently on full or partial ROTC
aid would be forced to drop out
of school or compete directly
with other students for
non-military scholarships and loan
funds which are presently being
strained to the limit.
This generated conflict could
not possibly be to the students' or
to Stanford's benefit. For this
reason and the others stated
above, I feel those who advocate
removal of ROTC from campus
are rendering a disservice to their
university and, perhaps
unknowingly to themselves.

Swastikas and Guilt
Editor, THE DAILY:
With regard to the Junipero
swastika incidents, one is
confronted by the problem of
what is to be done with the
offending parties should they be
identified. For as sensitive as we
have been made to our own

racism, we know that punishing
them will apparantly deny our
own guilt.
There is at this point the
problem of degree, that is, is one
act more racist than another.
Although this question is
peripheral to the central problem
of facism, it is considering degree
that traditional law makes
decisions. Thus we must either
"make the punishment fit the
crime" or provide such therapy as
is required for those of us who
appear so blatantly in
disharmony. To make a new
justice, we must believe in the
capacity of men to become whole
again.
