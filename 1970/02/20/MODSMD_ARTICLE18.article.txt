# Symbol Of Stability
## ROTC Uniforms 
### Dan Bernstein 
With all the unpredictability of
college life, whenever I feel lost, I
search for some sort of symbol of
stability. Invariably, that symbol
is most clearly illuminated in the
uniform. I like uniforms. That's
why I'm in the band. I also have
several baseball hats, thrive on
football and basketball games, and
even like a girl who used to wear a
uniform to school. But above all, I
like ROTC uniforms.
I don't care what branch of the
service they are. I'd hate to see
any of them go. I, as well as many
others, would be devastated if
ROTC was abolished, simply
because that symbol of strength
and assurance - the uniform -
would go with it.
Moral Dictators
I suppose the morality of the
situation would dictate that I join
the ranks of those who want to
kick ROTC off campus. In a way,
they're probably right. But the
people in ROTC don't bother me
as long as they're on campus,-I'm
really worried about what they'll
do once they leave. So why
should I fight to kick them off as
long as they're harmless, if not
reassuring, when they're drilling in
parking lots?
In fact, I'd like to keep the

people in ROTC on campus for as
long as possible. But there's no
way to maintain a steady supply
of uniforms around here if the
people who are supposed to fill
them don't even get academic
credit while they're wearing them.
Nixon's Costumes
I admit a little bias towards a
cadet's physical appearance. I'm
even somewhat impressed with
President Nixon's policemen. But
let's be fair: controversial as the
ROTC issue is, if the guys are
going to break ranks and join
ROTC, they should at least be
given credit for it. At least. What's
more, men of this stamina and
fortitude can obviously handle
more than most of their peers,
and accompanying academic
credit should be an elevation in
academic standards for those who
choose to participate in the
program. I bet the average ROTC
member could carry twice the
load of anybody else. So why not
give him a chance?
For my part, I'd be thrilled at
the thought of having ROTC
uniforms around for twice as long
at the small cost of allowing the
future soldiers to fulfill an
additional 180 units of academic
requirements.

The people who really worry
about what ROTC members will
do once they leave Stanford can
breathe a little easier, knowing
that our boys are going to be
drilling for at least eight years.
Army Fatigues
The only drawback to this
whole system is that the army
might get tired of waiting so long
for leadership, even though they
will have Stanford educations -
and might be tempted to phase
out the entire ROTC program,
concentrating their efforts
elsewhere. By that time, I sure
hope I won't need a symbol of
stability.
