## Insecurity A Freshman Characteristic 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
What is the Stanford freshman
like? A report prepared by the
Counseling and Testing Center
points out that Stanford freshmen
"constitute the largest single
aggregation of intellectual talent,
as measured by high school
achievement, among all American
institutions of higher learning."
Approximately 90 percent of
the Stanford entering class had a
B+ or better GPA in high school,
while about 80 percent had an A
average or better. To put this
another way, nearly half of the
class was in the top 1 percent of
their high school classes while
probably 90 percent were in the
top ten percent.
Almost 5 0 percent were
elected president of some school
organization, while about 50
percent won a varsity letter in a

sport. Approximately 25 percent
edited a school yearbook, paper,
or literary magazine.
Insecure
As the Counseling and Testing
Center report indicates, not only
does Stanford enroll a large
number of high achievers, but "we
enroll disproportionate numbers
of students with leadership skills
and literary ability."
Yet how does this aggregate of
high achievers and leaders feel
about Stanford and their class?
"Everyone is basically insecure.
Everyone thinks they're really
stupid," comments one Toyon
freshman. Ths feeling of
insecurity and incompetence
commented upon by many of this
year's freshmen would seem to
result in what Dr. Joseph Katz, in
his book No Time Left for Youth
calls"identity shock." "Identity
shock" occurs when a student
enters Stanford and encounters a
"fundamental challenge to his self
esteem."
Huge I'ond
One Stanford student, a case
study in Katz's book, observed,
"For about the first two days I
had a pretty high opinion of
myself, and from there on out I
felt like a midget among giants. It
was a case of a small frog in a
small pond becoming an even
smaller frog in a huge pond . . .
"I feel somewhat subdued by
the fact that there is so much
talent here. 1 don't feel nearly as
competent as a lot of other
people . . . One thing that was
characteristic of me in grade
school as well as in high school
was being on top."
Dr. John D. Black of the
Counseling and Testing Center
explains this sense of inferiority as
a result of "the neglect of the
negative instance" in which
people only pick out the superior
qualities in people around them,
thus giving themselves a sense of
inferiority and insecurity.
Playing Games
"I think this sense of insecurity
manifests itself in many respects
in freshmen this year," said one
girl. "People aren't open enough.
People play games with each other
and no one is really honest.

Everyone is all caught up with
themselves. No one wants to be
vulnerable, which reflects itself in
people being critical, cynical, and
sarcastic."
Another freshman girl,
commenting on what she
considered to be the surprising
asexual nature of boy-girl
relationships she found in a co-ed
dorm said, "It seems that
freshman boys are afraid of
getting their ego rejected. They
seem to be scared of being shot
down."
Stanford freshmen seem to feel
that their class, being composed as
it is of the Lop achievers and
leaders of secondary schools,
creates for them a very frustrating
situation in which the basis of a
person's self esteem seems to be
shattered. Commented one
freshman, "I'm thinking of
transferring to Hayward to see if
I'm still smart."
Un traditional
The report of the Counseling
and Testing Center also indicates a
trend in recent freshman classes
for increasing numbers of
Stanford freshmen "to be
unwilling or unable to identify
with traditional career goals and
for them to view college primarily
as an opportunity for self
definition, for autonomous
exploration, for discovery of
meaningful ways of relating to
others and serving humanity."
The amount of increase in
Stanford freshmen undecided as
to their careers has increased from
1 in 10 in 1966 to 1 in 4 in 1968.
As one freshman-put it,"I don't
even know what I'm going to be
doing next year, much less four
years from now."
How does this year's freshman
class compare to past freshman
classes? Scheimen, a junior, says
that at first, "I was appalled at
how irresponsible and naive they
were. Then I realized that they
were doing the same things we did
our freshman year, except in
certain instances, such as food
fights, where Wilbur has made it a
bit more difficult.
Desire to Excell
"The thing that really
impresses me is the high

percentage of fantastically
talented people we have such as
really excellent guitarists,
drummers, photographers, etc. It
seems as if there is a general desire
among freshmen to excell in
something, to know that there's
one thing that you're good and
better than almost everyone else
at.
"Another thing which has
impressed me is their originality,
such as the time they replaced my
rocking chair with a toilet filled
with Vitalis and beer."
Two final characteristics which
stick out in Scheimen's mind
concerning this year's freshman
class is their studying and what
Scheimen terms their "lack of
culture." "My dorm's a regular
turkey farm," he exclaims. "I
can't believe how much time
those guys put into physics 51. As
a matter of fact," adds Scheimen,
a physics major who is always
ready to lend a helping hand, "I
can't believe how much time I'm
putting into Physics 51. As far as
culture goes, sometimes, I really
feel like a zoo-keeper."
Booze Huns
Another freshman sponsor
added, "There certainly are
characteristics which

are consistent throughout
freshman classes since I've been
here, such as the electronics whiz
who discovers how to plug into
the Wilbur F A. system. Last night
they rediscovered water lighting
with hypodermic syringes. All in
all, I don't think this freshman
class is much different from mine
in that it seems intent on getting
all its raging out of its system
now."
As far as social life goes for
freshmen, which isn't very far in
the opinion of freshmen and
sponsors alike, one sponsor terms
the social life in his dorm as
"rudimentary," consisting mainly
of "trying to find a sponsor to
make a booze run." This,
however, does not seem to be the
situation which the Freshman
male is looking for. One freshman
complained that it was just "hard
to get women."
However, a Toyon co-ed felt
that the idea that it was hard for a
freshman boy to get a date was
largely a myth.
Ego T rip
"Weekends at Stanford for
many attractive freshman girls
consists of resting, working, and
getting stoned because boys are so
afraid of getting turned down that

they don't ask girls out," he said.
As far as adjusting to life at
Stanford goes, there seems to be a
wide variety of feeling. One
freshman said, "Things are going
along just fine. The only thing I
regret is that I don't have more

time to do more things. I like
playing the drums, but I also am
taking Physics 51. Therefore, I
spend most of my time doing
Physics 51."
Another student in the same
dorm however, said that he found
life at Stanford very difficult to
adjust to. "There's just such a
great change," he commented.
Political beliefs, like
adjustment to Stanford life,
would also seem hard to
generalize upon, as indicated by
one freshman dorm with a
Moratorium poster hanging in one
room and a "Win in Vietnam"
sign on another door.
Asking one last freshman what
was the one thing that bothered
him most about being a freshman,
he replied, "What bothers me
most about being a freshman?
Probably people that try to
categorize and stereotype
freshmen as freshmen."
