# Class Suspension Asked For Stanford Racism Convocation
## 
### TINA COOPER 
Last night, in a tense and
emotional session, the Student
Senate unanimously called for
President Pitzer to suspend all
classes February 26 for a
convocation to discuss campus
-acism.
Senators Leo Bazile (BSU
President) and Pat A. Shea (ASSU
President) introduced the
bombshell resolution.
The Senate had earlier passed a
Shea-sponsored resolution asking
the Academic Senate to clarify
♦he descrepancy between its
action last year in proposing no
credit for ROTC, and its action
this year which could give ROTC
limited credit.

"Pitzer," said Senator John
Shoch later, "is trying to persuade
us that this year's action is just a
consistent development of last
year's stand."
Bazile introduced the
convocation resolution with the
story of the harassment of two
black girls in Junipero House (see
last Monday's Daily.
Girls Harangued
"They were harangued by the
house; material was removed from
their door; and when they
replaced that material swastikas
were painted on it,"he charged
angrily.
"Finally someone put a note
saying 'kill the pickaninnies'
under their door. When those girls

came to me they were terrified."
"If Stanford is so ready to take
a gallant stand against racism at
BYU," he asked, "why should it
be reluctant to stop
business-as-usual to discuss its
own racial problems?"
Bazile stated that he had asked
the Dean of Students for
protection for the girls but that
the Dean had replied that this
necessitated calling in the county
sheriff, which would mean
'repression on the campus.'
Rationality
"We're trying to be
rational—we're supposed to be
rational," said Bazile with
restraint. "We just want one day
to talk about good old-fashioned
racism."
Senator Yale Braunstein
demanded further action by the
Senate. "This is a nice first step,"
he said, "but the situation needs
more."
Shea agreed. "This convocation
will be the first of many
steps—but we must act on it now.
This situation is serious.
"The problem is one of trying
to get people aware enough to
change their basic life styles."
Schneider's Misgivings
Senator Jim Schneider, though
saying he was in general
agreement with the resolution,
expressed misgivings.
"This is an isolated incident in

a small group of people," he
pointed out. "Does it really
justify action by the entire
Stanford community?
"We might only make matters
worse."
At this point Shea exploded.
After some stammering, he
produced, "The purpose of
education is to control visceral
responses —but I've been
miseducated."
'Crock of Shit'
Asked by Schneider to clarify
that, he said "Basically I'm saying
tha what you said is a crock of
shit."
Shea later calmed down and
apologized for his allegation.
Senator Rick Atkins added his
opinion. "No incident like this,"
he said, "is too small to merit
community attention."
"This is step one," Bazile said.
"I've got steps two and three and
four lined up—and I don't think
Pitzer is going to like anything
past two.
"If the University doesn't care
enough to give us our
convocation, my next step will be
to hold a press conference on
White Plaza. I want to ask the
world why Stanford can be so
quick to act on BYU's
racism—and so slow to act on its
own."
Without further debate, the
resolution passed unanimously.
