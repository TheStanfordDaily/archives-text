## Police Searches Challenged 
### NICK NICHOLAS 
A survey of local marijuana
arrests, conducted last summer by
a third-year law student, raises
"serious doubts" about the
validity of "probable cause"
police searches.
Geoffery R.W. Smith, writing
in a recent issue of the Law
Review, suggests that the high
costs involved in enforcing
marijuana laws are coupled with
social costs including "increased
alienation of the defendants and
the adoption of unhealthy police
practices."
Smith, who teaches an
undergraduate special on "Drugs
and the Law" this quarter, studied
137 felony complaints for
marijuana violations filed in the
Southern Judicial District of San
Mateo County from October 1967
to September 1968. They
constituted 22.6 percent of all
felony complaints filed in that
period.
In examining 92 arrest
situations, Smith found that
narcotics agents accounted for
only 20 percent of arrests. Almost
all the others resulted from police
work unrelated to drugs—vehicle
code violations, disturbances, etc.
Most Are Young
Of those arrested, Smith found
the median age to be about 20.
Some 95 percent of those arrested
were less than 30 years old.
The arrest sample, Smith says,
seemed to indicate a
predominance of ''less
well-educated and less
stably-employed" people that the
average for their age group.
Only two means of satisfying
constitutional requirements are
available to police—either
obtaining a search warrant or
getting consent from the person
to be searched. Both are rarely
available. Instead, Smith asserts,
police depend on persuading the
judge that "they were able to
discover marijuana without a
'search'; that they had probable
cause to believe the car contained
marijuana or that the search was
incidental to a lawful arrest."
And, he continues, data "suggests
that the convenience of this
bootstrap may have led to its
widespread invocation by
arresting officers."
Un derfoot
Probable cause is often based
on flimsy evidence. Smith quotes
a report of a night arrest:
". . . as he was leaning to one
side to abstract his wallet I was
able to notice vegetable-botanical
material underneath his foot on
the floor boards."
The physical characteristics of
marijuana, whose particles rarely
exceed one-16th of an inch in
diameter, "provide ample
opportunity for policemen so
inclined to fudge on the issue of
probable cause."

(An interesting footnote: Since
a 1966 California Supreme Court
decision, no penalties can be
levied against a person possessing
useless traces of residue of
marijuana. The sheriff's office in
the study area "will not now
make an arrest for possession of
less marijuana than the minimum
needed to make a cigarette (0.2
grams)."
Sociul Effects
Such o v e r-z e a 1 o u sn ess
deteriorates police-community
relations and alientates large
numbers of young people.
Combined with the laws
themselves, the effect is to "turn
generally law-abiding citizens into
serious criminals." The stigma of a
police record, Smith adds, is too
great a price for the offense. Also,
certain "high visibility" types (i.e.
hi pies) are subject to an

increased number of incidental
searches and arrests, more so than
non-conspicuous types.
Smith believes that mere
lowering of penalties will not
significantly lower adverse social
effects stemming from the present
laws. Legalization, no matter how
unpalatable politically, seems to
be the only viable solution.
As for the "no-knock"
provisions passed last week by
Congress, Smith thinks that they
might not be valid when reviewed
by the courts. The provision; he
says, seems to have arisen out of a
compromise with conservative
forces, as a counter-balance to
penalty reductions also approved.
But since most arrests are made
by state officers not covered
under the legislation, any effects
will be "minimal."

costs involved in enforcing
marijuana laws are coupled with
social costs including "increased
alienation of the defendants and
the adoption of unhealthy police
practices."
Smith, who teaches an
undergraduate special on "Drugs
and the Law" this quarter, studied
137 felony complaints for
marijuana violations filed in the
Southern Judicial District of San
Mateo County from October 1967
to September 1968. They
constituted 22.6 percent of all
felony complaints filed in that
period.
In examining 92 arrest
situations, Smith found that
narcotics agents accounted for
only 20 percent of arrests. Almost
all the others resulted from police
work unrelated to drugs—vehicle
code violations, disturbances, etc.
Most Are Young
Of those arrested, Smith found
the median age to be about 20.
Some 95 percent of those arrested
were less than 30 years old.
The arrest sample, Smith says,
seemed to indicate a
predominance of ''less
well-educated and less
stably-employed" people that the
average for their age group.
Only two means of satisfying
constitutional requirements are
available to police—either
obtaining a search warrant or
getting consent from the person
to be searched. Both are rarely
available. Instead, Smith asserts,
police depend on persuading the
judge that "they were able to
discover marijuana without a
'search'; that they had probable
cause to believe the car contained
marijuana or that the search was
incidental to a lawful arrest."
And, he continues, data "suggests
that the convenience of this
bootstrap may have led to its
widespread invocation by
arresting officers."
Un derfoot
Probable cause is often based
on flimsy evidence. Smith quotes
a report of a night arrest:
". . . as he was leaning to one
side to abstract his wallet I was
able to notice vegetable-botanical
material underneath his foot on
the floor boards."
The physical characteristics of
marijuana, whose particles rarely
exceed one-16th of an inch in
diameter, "provide ample
opportunity for policemen so
inclined to fudge on the issue of
probable cause."

(An interesting footnote: Since
a 1966 California Supreme Court
decision, no penalties can be
levied against a person possessing
useless traces of residue of
marijuana. The sheriff's office in
the study area "will not now
make an arrest for possession of
less marijuana than the minimum
needed to make a cigarette (0.2
grams)."
Sociul Effects
Such o v e r-z e a 1 o u sn ess
deteriorates police-community
relations and alientates large
numbers of young people.
Combined with the laws
themselves, the effect is to "turn
generally law-abiding citizens into
serious criminals." The stigma of a
police record, Smith adds, is too
great a price for the offense. Also,
certain "high visibility" types (i.e.
hi pies) are subject to an

increased number of incidental
searches and arrests, more so than
non-conspicuous types.
Smith believes that mere
lowering of penalties will not
significantly lower adverse social
effects stemming from the present
laws. Legalization, no matter how
unpalatable politically, seems to
be the only viable solution.
As for the "no-knock"
provisions passed last week by
Congress, Smith thinks that they
might not be valid when reviewed
by the courts. The provision; he
says, seems to have arisen out of a
compromise with conservative
forces, as a counter-balance to
penalty reductions also approved.
But since most arrests are made
by state officers not covered
under the legislation, any effects
will be "minimal."
A survey of local marijuana
arrests, conducted last summer by
a third-year law student, raises
"serious doubts" about the
validity of "probable cause"
police searches.
