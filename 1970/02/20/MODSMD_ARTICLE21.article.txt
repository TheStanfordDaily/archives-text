# Changing Worldview Topic Of Address
## 
### JOHN COONROD 
"Could it be that when a probe
is finally landed on the surface of
Venus it will find the ground
covered with deserted factories,
automobiles, and oil refineries?"
This question ended Prof.
Walter A. Harrison's lecture in the
Physics tank Tuesday night, a
lecture which encompassed topics
including the death of Absolute
Truth, the laws of
thermodynamics, and our concept
of eating spaghetti.
His talk, "Our Changing View
of the World" was the fourth in
the "Physics and Man" series.
The wide scope and history of
physics was discussed before an
audience which included children,
students, and some of the nations
most renowned physicists.
Employing tongue-in-cheek
physics formulae and a
Thurburesque chalk style, Harrison
presented countless topics,
puzzles, and paradoxes.
He admitted at the beginning
that no one could seriously
consider all of these ideas in a
lifetime, but that he would be
satisfied if people were stimulated
or amused by any of them.
Touching briefly on his explicit
topic, Harrison said that he was
puzzled that quantum physics has
had so little impact on human
thought outside of physics.
''This is particularly
remarkable," he said, "since the
classical physics of Newton seems
to have revolutionized world
thought and ushered in the Age of
Reason." And quantum therory,
he said, has replaced the classical
ideas.

In high school, he said, we
learn that we do not use suction
to drink lemonade, we merely let
the air pressure push it into our
mouth. Continuing this analogy,
he sketched a person with a piece
of spaghetti going from a very
messy plate into his mouth. "The
air forces on the side of the
spaghetti are balanced, so it must
be the force on this little end that
pushes."
No physics "law" was treated
as sacred. "The first law of
thermodynamics is that you
cannot build a perpetual motion
machine of the first kind (one
that creates energy)." He said that
these laws granted engineers the
security of not having to try and
build one, but that the law would
be more precisely stated "To my
knowledge no one has built a
perpetual motion machine as of
yet."
God's Dice
Quantum mechanics has
presented a theory which satisfies
the dualistic wave-particle nature
of light with probability
equations. Harrison cited
experiments describing these
probabilities, but which pointed
to flaws in the argument.
"Einstein thought that this
description was preposterous," he
said. "He expressed the objection
in a pithy way when he said 'God
does not throw dice."
He described the alternate
addition to the theory, the hidden
variable theory. "The lightbulb
releases two packets, but it says
that this packet is empty."
Harrison referred to a Jesuit
priest who once considered
studying physics in order to prove
the existence of God. Physics,
however, turned out to be too
shaky a foundation to prove an
idea the priest considered
absolutely true.
"Today we physicists do not
believe that quantum theory is the
complete or final answer; nor that
there even exists a complete or
final answer. There are no
absolute truths even in the most
exact of the sciences," he said.
