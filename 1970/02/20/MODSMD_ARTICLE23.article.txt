# Critic's Choice
## Antonioni Obvious But Fascinating 
### TODD McCARTHY 
I detest Michelangelo
Antonioni. Every film of his I've
seen has either repulsed me by its
pretentiousness or put me to
sleep. In interviews and in person,
he comes across as arrogant and
conceited, dismissing serious and
complex questions with a "yes"
or "no" or saying, "That's too
complicated for me to explain."
Funny that I should like
"Zabriskie Point."
Funny too that the nation's
critics should be dismissing the
film as a betrayal of the director's
talentâ€”they're saying things such
as, "In "Zabriskie Point,"
Antonioni is stranded, politically
and artistically, on hostile
terrain." As I had no preconceived
notions about Antonioni's
supposedly significant abilities,
there was no way I could have
been disappointed with his new,
much publicized picture. As it
turns out, I was pleasantly
surprised.
No Mascot
Politically, the film is rather
calm, so much so that I can't
begin to imagine what perpetrated
all the pre-release tremors which
indicated that this picture would
blow the lid off. Radicals will
hardly use "Zabriskie Point" as
their cinematic mascot. Indeed,
they may even feel they've been
co-opted, since the lead character
walks out of the opening radical
strategy rap, explaining that he
doesn't like to waste time
planning for defeat.
Essentially, what fascinated me
throughout the film was seeing
what Antonioni, an outsider,
chose to show about America.
Over the years, hundreds of
Europeans have made their names
and fortunes relating their
impressions of the New World
literarally and Antonioni is by no

means the first (nor, alas, will he
be the last) to do so cinematically.
It could be that no small part of
my amusement in watching
"Zabriskie Point" was derived
from realizing that even the "great
artist" Antonioni could not create
more original methods of
representing the evils of capitalism
than by pointing out the
grotesque billboard
advertisements which adorn Los
Angeles, the brutality of the pigs
and the impersonality of big
business.
Little Insight
Having spent a year or less in
the States, Antonioni could
hardly be expected to have fully
absorbed the subtleties and
nuances of American life.
Consequently, the film lacks
insight and is rather obvious in its
implications. But then again,there
is no native to my knowledge who
has made a coherent film on the
currently complex American
condition. "Easy Rider," "Alice's
Restaurant" and "Medium Cool,"
along with the rock musical,
"Hair," are already beginning to
look like period pieces because
they deal with such a specific
social climate. A film can be good
and relevant at the same time, but
a film is not good because it's
relevant.
That I rather liked "Zabriskie
Point" rests with the fact that
Antonioni does not force the
viewer into an ultra-serious frame

of mind. Because the lead
characters are rather superficially
portrayed and are not endowed
with deep intellectual or
psychological dimensions, we are
not forced to furrow our brows
and speculate at the significance
of their actions. Although this
characteristic of unseriousness of
purpose could usually provide
valid means to criticize a film on
the grounds of facility or copping
out, it actually serves to liberate
"Zabriskie Point" from the realm
of pretentiousness. Curiously, the
only sequence in the entire film
which is detectably Antonioni,
the celebrated desert orgy, is also
the most preposterous and absurd.
Scones of Brilliance
Many individual scenes stand
on their own as enjoyable and
intriguing and they, along with
Antonioni's impeccable
craftsmanship, are enough to
sustain interest in the film. The
initial meeting of the two leads, in
which Daria, driving her car
through the desert, is buzzed by
Mark in his stolen airplane, is
reminiscent of the crop duster
sequence in Hitchcock's "North
by Northwest." The
psychedelicizing of the airplane,
the lunar landscape evocations in
Death Valley and Daria's visit to
an isolated desert town with old
western star Paul Fix as the cafe
owner, are all very nice.
Most extraordinary of all are
the film's climactic moments

when Antonioni, through Daria's
mind, imagines the destruction of
western civilization. The sequence
begins with a dozen or more shots
of an exploding desert mansion
which houses Rod Taylor and his
fellow capitalists. This is followed
by the slow motion explosions of
refrigerators, a television set and
other ugly artifacts. The film
concludes as a sort of "2001"
populated not by space ships but
by free-floating skinned chickens,
loaves of Wonder bread, Life
magazine and poolside furniture.
Human Failure
Ultimately, what endeared me to
"Zabriskie Point" was that it

demonstrated tliat Antonioni, the
aging revolutionary and hip social
commentator, can fail on
conventional terms. But in failure,
one's humanity is revealed and I
prefer humanity to even the most
artistic impersonality. At the
moment, 1 rather like
Michelangelo Antonioni.
* * *
It occurs to me that any review
of Claude Chabrol's "La Femme
Infidele" would begin to spoil the
immense pleasure of the film.
This, in addition to the fact that it
seems to have been booked into
San Francisco's Bridge Theatre for
only one week ("The Damned"
opens there next Wednesday)
makes me refrain from reviewing
it in depth at this point. If the
film is somehow saved from the
dismal destiny of cultural oblivion
by some* ambitious theatre
manager, I'll tackle the film at
greater length.
For now, suffice it to say that
"La Femme Infidele" is a
remarkably beautiful, fluid and
concise mystery, one of the very
best films of the past year.
Chabrol is the French cinema's
most accomplished Hitchcockian
and his current picture bears
favorable comparison to even the
greatest works of the American
master of suspense.

"Zabriskie Point" is currently
