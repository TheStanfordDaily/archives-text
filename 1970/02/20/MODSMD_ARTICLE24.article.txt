Birgit Nilsson, the great Swedish dramatic soprano, will appear in
recital at Zellerbach Hall on the Berkeley campus, on Thursday,
February 26, at 8:30 P.M. The program has not yet been announced.
Miss Nilsson is most noted for her interpretations in the Wagnerian
operatic repertory, where she has no peer today. Her voice is an often
astonishing combination of power and beauty, able to penetrate the
thickest orchestral texture. Other roles in which she has had great
success include Tosca, Turandot, Elektra, Salome, Aida, and Lady
Macbeth. Miss Nilsson has appeared in all of the world's great opera
houses and has had over 100 new productions mounted for her,
including a new "Tosca" at the Metropolitan Opera in 1968.
The soprano has made many recordings for London, Angel, DGG,
and RCA. She is the first artist to record the three Brunnhildes of
Wagner's "Der Ring des Nibelungen," an effort which won her
unanimous critical acclaim. Miss Nilsson's recorded repertory includes
most of her most famous stage roles, plus several solo recital discs.
As part of the emphasis on contemporary music during winter
quarter John Walker will play a recital of 20th-century works for the
organ at Memorial Church on Tuesday evening, February 24 at 8 p.m.
Compositions to be presented will represent Gernam, French, and
American composers throughout the century. Included on the
program is Schoenberg's seldom-played "Variations on a Recitative".
The work has received a wider audience in Europe than in America.
One of the composer's late works, it is nevertheless written basically
in D minor. Other composers represented on the program are
Hindemith, Distler, Piston, Walcha, Langlais, Vierne, and Dupre. Free
admission.
The National Ballet will perform twice on Sunday, Mar. 1 at the
Opera House. Desmond Kelly, Denise LeComte and National Ballet
Artistic Director Frederic Franklin will dance Coppelia at a 2:30
matinee. The same evening, Edward Villella will dance Albrecht to
Marilyn Burr's Giselle in the Coralli-Pernot-Franklin version of Giselle.
You will have time for a leisurely dinner between programs.
