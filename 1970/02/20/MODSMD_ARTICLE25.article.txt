The airplane was an old jalopy of a CD 4. When the
motors started up I could see the loose bolts bouncing
around on the cowling. It waited an hour on the ground
before taking off in the unbelievable heat. Once we were
airborne and it cooled off a little, the stewardess
announced that we would stop somewhere in the middle
of the country, then continue to Burbank and Oakland.
I asked the stewardess where exactly we would be
stopping, and she said she didn't know; she had asked the
pilot hut couldn't get a straight answer out of him. Finally
she announced that we would be landing shortly at St.
Louis. I saw a big brown river below that just had to be
the Mississippi. But the plane didn't land. It flew on
another hour and finally came down at Springfield,
Missouri.
The non-scheduled airlines were outlawed the
following year, I believe. Can you imagine what things
would be like if they'd been allowed to continue? The $5
flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles in a DC-3 or a
DC-6 or whatever sturdy old planes you could haul up out
of forced retirement. Low overhead. No advertising
expenses: plenty of free word-of-mouth publicity. No
reservations or scheduling. Non-scheduled airlines for
non-scheduled people.
A Little Hit Longer
The flight was supposed to take 12 hours but somehow
took 18. We got to the Oakland Airport at 1 a.m., but Jim
and Betty Petras were there to meet us. Jim was a hustling
organizer who had built the Berkeley YSA into a thriving
organization in the previous year. After a few days we
were activists. Meetings all the time. Constantly meeting
new people, all of them Young Socialists or "contacts."
Assignments. Responsibilities. Progress reports. Strategy
sessions. Study groups.
There was a tremendous amount of work to be done
and I plunged in, though I really didn't understand what it
was we were doing. I supposed that it would gradually
dawn on me if I gave it a chance. I soon discovered that
there was a standard way of putting that question and a
standard way of answering. The exact litany was this:
"What is our main task in the coming period?"
"Our main task is to build the YSA."
This was not fully satisfactory. It created an image of
the organization as a growth. That has an ugly sound.
Something whose only purpose is to grow. Hope it's
benign.
What Jim Petras knew but didn't know quite how to
say, was that we were getting in practice for the
revolution: limbering up our joints, strengthening our
muscles, sharpening our eyes, developing a sense of
timing. Our image of the impending American revolution
was of course based on the image of the Russian
Revolution. And "action" in the Russian Revolution
meant a rising tide of arguments, debates and speeches.
Lenin's return to Russia in April 1917, is, most of all
the speech at the Finland station, which triggers a crucial
debute inside the Bolshevik Party to determine what line
the party's agitational organs will take in its argument
("struggle") with its opponents. The street
demonstrations in July are a failure; but in August, when
General Kornilov sets his army on the move against the
workers, Bolshevik agitators spring forth from the

factories, meet the soldiers and argm them into changing
sides.
Speech I" \plosion
Then Russia explodes in speeches. Everywhere there
are knots of people on street corners listening to
impromptu speakers from the various political parties. In
that late summer and early fall of 1917, only the
Bolshevik speakers had any passion or conviction; events
had made everyone else sound hollow. The October
Revolution just rose like a wave so mightily no one
bothered to oppose it. The whole thing was almost
bloodless throughout 1917 and halfway through 191 H.
Then the Civil War began. But that was another stor\
When we spoke about the Russian Revolution, we
didn't talk about great historical events. We talked about
what line Lenin had taken at a certain time, how various
elements in the Bolshevik Party had responded, how the
Mensheviks had stood on the such-and-such question in
other words the politics of it.
From every direction, not only from the books we
read, but also from the paintings, posters, photographs
and movies we saw about the Russian Revolution, there
seeped in on us the idea that action means making a
speech.
So, to develop ourselves as Bolsheviks, we harried our
rivals; the Young People's Socialist League, the
free-floating Communist Party youth who would later
make up the Dußois Club, and any exotic little radical
tendency wo could find. We organized public meetings
called Young Socialist Forums, at which one of us would
deliver a lecture on some topic of political interest. Just
like little professors.
The Student's Sad Career
I had been out of college for a year and a half and was
a bit afraid to go back. Every student secretly believes
that he is really very stupid and has gotten by so far only
by faking. Turning points in a school career the first day
of high school, the first college paper to be written, the
first graduate seminar—are always terrifying experiences.
You might say the student's career is months or years of
boredom followed by weeks of terror.
I loaded myself up with history and sociology courses
because they interfered relatively little with my Young
Socialist studies and also because I was genuinely
interested in what the courses promised. The sociologists
were breaking down the myth of America-the
classless-society with hard statistical facts about social
stratification. The historians were breaking with old
fashioned political history and trying to do research on
how ordinary people had actually lived.
I also nursed the secret hope that I would be able to
discover or invent some revolutionary theory that would
be a little more interesting than the YSA's deadly tedious
Bolshevism, which had been frozen stiff when Trotsky
died in 1940.
I was a bit of a renegade in the YSA, if truth be told,
because I held that Russia was state capitalistic and not
essentially different from America, while everybody else
held that Russia was a degenerate worker's state.
Although it was not a condition of membership, it just
happened that everyone but me and one other YSAer
"supported the Soviet workers' state despite its
bureaucratic degeneration."
While everyone else "called for a political revolution in
the Soviet Union," we "called for a political revolution in
the Soviet Union." We were called "the state-capitalist

tendency' —sometimes just "state caps
In fact, everything was really an awful lot simpler than
either the\SA or the sociologists made it out to be. There
was no need to talk about "the proletariat" or "the petit
bourgeoisie," and there was no reason to postulate an
upper-upper, lower-upper, upper-middle, lower-middle,
upper-lower, lower-lower class division as some
sociologists did. There was no need at all to give yourself a
headache.
The Big Lie which we were all taught and which we
still believed was that while in the old days there were
nobles and peasants, today we had a different system. A
lie. There are a handful of Noblemen who own the whole
country, who pay whatever taxes they feel it expedient to
pay, whose children are exempt from military service,
who can commit any crime including murder and never
see the inside of a jail. 1 am not talking about pipsqueak
influence peddlers like Richard Nixon, I mean important
people: DuPonts, Rockefellers, Mellons, Fords, and the
inheritors of lesser fortunes. You know who they are, why
pretend you don't know?
If Ted Kennedy hadn't been a Nobleman lie would
have been charged with manslaughter—maybe suspicion of
murder, under the circumstances -and held in jail for
months on impossibly high bail before his trial. But Ted
Kennedy just walked into the courtroom and walked out
again. If he hadn't been such a well-known political figure,
if he had merely been the heir to a gigantic fortune, he
probably would not have had to show up in court at all.
Priests and Drudges
The rest of the population consists mostly of Drudges.
The Drudges do whatever they are told. A Drudge thinks
he's really hot shit if he can sell his time for $4 an hour.
The Drudges spend 10 hours a week at the service of the
Nobleman. Well, it used to be 40; now so many Drudges
are working two jobs that the average is probably up to
50.
Between the Noblemen and the Drudges are an army of
Priests - doctors, lawyers, engineers, executives, editors,
and, yes, cops; people who know a little bit about how
things work and don't have to consider every thing a
miracle (the refrigerator and the election and the Miss
America contest and the penicillin injection are all
miracles to the Drudge).
Those sociology professors and young socialists were so
goddamn smart with all their theories that they never
could tell me what my social class situation was, for God's
sake. My father was a postal clerk. For 35 years he sorted
mail and was ashamed. He was always ashamed of himself,
every moment he sorted mail for 35 years at the Church
Street Station, 90 Church Street, in New York. He
sneaked off to work early in the morning and he sneaked
home at night dead tired. At night lie lit his pipe and read
the paper and asked me about school. Very important to
get good marks, he told me.
The father teaching his son all tha he knew about the
world.
All he knew about the world was that you got to get
good marks. They look at your marks. Bui who the tuck
are they? And who are we?
I asked the young socialists what my father was and
what I was. The socialists said that my father was a petty
bourgeois state employee, and the sociologists said he was
lower middle class, when the truth was much simpler. My
father was a Drudge, and his only hope in life was that his
son might become a Lesser Priest.

"What is our main task in the coming period?"
"Our main task is to build the YSA."
This was not fully satisfactory. It created an image of
the organization as a growth. That has an ugly sound.
Something whose only purpose is to grow. Hope it's
benign.
What Jim Petras knew but didn't know quite how to
say, was that we were getting in practice for the
revolution: limbering up our joints, strengthening our
muscles, sharpening our eyes, developing a sense of
timing. Our image of the impending American revolution
was of course based on the image of the Russian
Revolution. And "action" in the Russian Revolution
meant a rising tide of arguments, debates and speeches.
Lenin's return to Russia in April 1917, is, most of all
the speech at the Finland station, which triggers a crucial
debute inside the Bolshevik Party to determine what line
the party's agitational organs will take in its argument
("struggle") with its opponents. The street
demonstrations in July are a failure; but in August, when
General Kornilov sets his army on the move against the
workers, Bolshevik agitators spring forth from the

factories, meet the soldiers and argm them into changing
sides.
Speech I" \plosion
Then Russia explodes in speeches. Everywhere there
are knots of people on street corners listening to
impromptu speakers from the various political parties. In
that late summer and early fall of 1917, only the
Bolshevik speakers had any passion or conviction; events
had made everyone else sound hollow. The October
Revolution just rose like a wave so mightily no one
bothered to oppose it. The whole thing was almost
bloodless throughout 1917 and halfway through 191 H.
Then the Civil War began. But that was another stor\
When we spoke about the Russian Revolution, we
didn't talk about great historical events. We talked about
what line Lenin had taken at a certain time, how various
elements in the Bolshevik Party had responded, how the
Mensheviks had stood on the such-and-such question in
other words the politics of it.
From every direction, not only from the books we
read, but also from the paintings, posters, photographs
and movies we saw about the Russian Revolution, there
seeped in on us the idea that action means making a
speech.
So, to develop ourselves as Bolsheviks, we harried our
rivals; the Young People's Socialist League, the
free-floating Communist Party youth who would later
make up the Dußois Club, and any exotic little radical
tendency wo could find. We organized public meetings
called Young Socialist Forums, at which one of us would
deliver a lecture on some topic of political interest. Just
like little professors.
The Student's Sad Career
I had been out of college for a year and a half and was
a bit afraid to go back. Every student secretly believes
that he is really very stupid and has gotten by so far only
by faking. Turning points in a school career the first day
of high school, the first college paper to be written, the
first graduate seminar—are always terrifying experiences.
You might say the student's career is months or years of
boredom followed by weeks of terror.
I loaded myself up with history and sociology courses
because they interfered relatively little with my Young
Socialist studies and also because I was genuinely
interested in what the courses promised. The sociologists
were breaking down the myth of America-the
classless-society with hard statistical facts about social
stratification. The historians were breaking with old
fashioned political history and trying to do research on
how ordinary people had actually lived.
I also nursed the secret hope that I would be able to
discover or invent some revolutionary theory that would
be a little more interesting than the YSA's deadly tedious
Bolshevism, which had been frozen stiff when Trotsky
died in 1940.
I was a bit of a renegade in the YSA, if truth be told,
because I held that Russia was state capitalistic and not
essentially different from America, while everybody else
held that Russia was a degenerate worker's state.
Although it was not a condition of membership, it just
happened that everyone but me and one other YSAer
"supported the Soviet workers' state despite its
bureaucratic degeneration."
While everyone else "called for a political revolution in
the Soviet Union," we "called for a political revolution in
the Soviet Union." We were called "the state-capitalist

tendency' —sometimes just "state caps
In fact, everything was really an awful lot simpler than
either the\SA or the sociologists made it out to be. There
was no need to talk about "the proletariat" or "the petit
bourgeoisie," and there was no reason to postulate an
upper-upper, lower-upper, upper-middle, lower-middle,
upper-lower, lower-lower class division as some
sociologists did. There was no need at all to give yourself a
headache.
The Big Lie which we were all taught and which we
still believed was that while in the old days there were
nobles and peasants, today we had a different system. A
lie. There are a handful of Noblemen who own the whole
country, who pay whatever taxes they feel it expedient to
pay, whose children are exempt from military service,
who can commit any crime including murder and never
see the inside of a jail. 1 am not talking about pipsqueak
influence peddlers like Richard Nixon, I mean important
people: DuPonts, Rockefellers, Mellons, Fords, and the
inheritors of lesser fortunes. You know who they are, why
pretend you don't know?
If Ted Kennedy hadn't been a Nobleman lie would
have been charged with manslaughter—maybe suspicion of
murder, under the circumstances -and held in jail for
months on impossibly high bail before his trial. But Ted
Kennedy just walked into the courtroom and walked out
again. If he hadn't been such a well-known political figure,
if he had merely been the heir to a gigantic fortune, he
probably would not have had to show up in court at all.
Priests and Drudges
The rest of the population consists mostly of Drudges.
The Drudges do whatever they are told. A Drudge thinks
he's really hot shit if he can sell his time for $4 an hour.
The Drudges spend 10 hours a week at the service of the
Nobleman. Well, it used to be 40; now so many Drudges
are working two jobs that the average is probably up to
50.
Between the Noblemen and the Drudges are an army of
Priests - doctors, lawyers, engineers, executives, editors,
and, yes, cops; people who know a little bit about how
things work and don't have to consider every thing a
miracle (the refrigerator and the election and the Miss
America contest and the penicillin injection are all
miracles to the Drudge).
Those sociology professors and young socialists were so
goddamn smart with all their theories that they never
could tell me what my social class situation was, for God's
sake. My father was a postal clerk. For 35 years he sorted
mail and was ashamed. He was always ashamed of himself,
every moment he sorted mail for 35 years at the Church
Street Station, 90 Church Street, in New York. He
sneaked off to work early in the morning and he sneaked
home at night dead tired. At night lie lit his pipe and read
the paper and asked me about school. Very important to
get good marks, he told me.
The father teaching his son all tha he knew about the
world.
All he knew about the world was that you got to get
good marks. They look at your marks. Bui who the tuck
are they? And who are we?
I asked the young socialists what my father was and
what I was. The socialists said that my father was a petty
bourgeois state employee, and the sociologists said he was
lower middle class, when the truth was much simpler. My
father was a Drudge, and his only hope in life was that his
son might become a Lesser Priest.

The airplane was an old jalopy of a CD 4. When the
motors started up I could see the loose bolts bouncing
around on the cowling. It waited an hour on the ground
before taking off in the unbelievable heat. Once we were
airborne and it cooled off a little, the stewardess
announced that we would stop somewhere in the middle
of the country, then continue to Burbank and Oakland.
I asked the stewardess where exactly we would be
stopping, and she said she didn't know; she had asked the
pilot hut couldn't get a straight answer out of him. Finally
she announced that we would be landing shortly at St.
Louis. I saw a big brown river below that just had to be
the Mississippi. But the plane didn't land. It flew on
another hour and finally came down at Springfield,
Missouri.
The non-scheduled airlines were outlawed the
following year, I believe. Can you imagine what things
would be like if they'd been allowed to continue? The $5
flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles in a DC-3 or a
DC-6 or whatever sturdy old planes you could haul up out
of forced retirement. Low overhead. No advertising
expenses: plenty of free word-of-mouth publicity. No
reservations or scheduling. Non-scheduled airlines for
non-scheduled people.
A Little Hit Longer
The flight was supposed to take 12 hours but somehow
took 18. We got to the Oakland Airport at 1 a.m., but Jim
and Betty Petras were there to meet us. Jim was a hustling
organizer who had built the Berkeley YSA into a thriving
organization in the previous year. After a few days we
were activists. Meetings all the time. Constantly meeting
new people, all of them Young Socialists or "contacts."
Assignments. Responsibilities. Progress reports. Strategy
sessions. Study groups.
There was a tremendous amount of work to be done

So, to develop ourselves as Bolsheviks, we harried our
rivals; the Young People's Socialist League, the
free-floating Communist Party youth who would later
make up the Dußois Club, and any exotic little radical
tendency wo could find. We organized public meetings
called Young Socialist Forums, at which one of us would
deliver a lecture on some topic of political interest. Just
like little professors.
The Student's Sad Career
I had been out of college for a year and a half and was
a bit afraid to go back. Every student secretly believes
that he is really very stupid and has gotten by so far only
by faking. Turning points in a school career the first day
of high school, the first college paper to be written, the
first graduate seminar—are always terrifying experiences.
You might say the student's career is months or years of
boredom followed by weeks of terror.
I loaded myself up with history and sociology courses
because they interfered relatively little with my Young
Socialist studies and also because I was genuinely
interested in what the courses promised. The sociologists
were breaking down the myth of America-the
classless-society with hard statistical facts about social
stratification. The historians were breaking with old
fashioned political history and trying to do research on
how ordinary people had actually lived.
I also nursed the secret hope that I would be able to
discover or invent some revolutionary theory that would
be a little more interesting than the YSA's deadly tedious
Bolshevism, which had been frozen stiff when Trotsky
died in 1940.
I was a bit of a renegade in the YSA, if truth be told,
because I held that Russia was state capitalistic and not
essentially different from America, while everybody else
held that Russia was a degenerate worker's state.
Although it was not a condition of membership, it just
happened that everyone but me and one other YSAer
"supported the Soviet workers' state despite its
bureaucratic degeneration."
While everyone else "called for a political revolution in
the Soviet Union," we "called for a political revolution in
the Soviet Union." We were called "the state-capitalist

tendency' —sometimes just "state caps
In fact, everything was really an awful lot simpler than
either the\SA or the sociologists made it out to be. There
was no need to talk about "the proletariat" or "the petit
bourgeoisie," and there was no reason to postulate an
upper-upper, lower-upper, upper-middle, lower-middle,
upper-lower, lower-lower class division as some
sociologists did. There was no need at all to give yourself a
headache.
The Big Lie which we were all taught and which we
still believed was that while in the old days there were
nobles and peasants, today we had a different system. A
lie. There are a handful of Noblemen who own the whole
country, who pay whatever taxes they feel it expedient to
pay, whose children are exempt from military service,
who can commit any crime including murder and never
see the inside of a jail. 1 am not talking about pipsqueak
influence peddlers like Richard Nixon, I mean important
people: DuPonts, Rockefellers, Mellons, Fords, and the
inheritors of lesser fortunes. You know who they are, why
pretend you don't know?
If Ted Kennedy hadn't been a Nobleman lie would
have been charged with manslaughter—maybe suspicion of
murder, under the circumstances -and held in jail for
months on impossibly high bail before his trial. But Ted
Kennedy just walked into the courtroom and walked out
again. If he hadn't been such a well-known political figure,
if he had merely been the heir to a gigantic fortune, he
probably would not have had to show up in court at all.
Priests and Drudges
The rest of the population consists mostly of Drudges.
The Drudges do whatever they are told. A Drudge thinks
he's really hot shit if he can sell his time for $4 an hour.
The Drudges spend 10 hours a week at the service of the
Nobleman. Well, it used to be 40; now so many Drudges
are working two jobs that the average is probably up to
50.
Between the Noblemen and the Drudges are an army of
Priests - doctors, lawyers, engineers, executives, editors,
and, yes, cops; people who know a little bit about how
things work and don't have to consider every thing a
miracle (the refrigerator and the election and the Miss
America contest and the penicillin injection are all
miracles to the Drudge).
Those sociology professors and young socialists were so
goddamn smart with all their theories that they never
could tell me what my social class situation was, for God's
sake. My father was a postal clerk. For 35 years he sorted
mail and was ashamed. He was always ashamed of himself,
every moment he sorted mail for 35 years at the Church
Street Station, 90 Church Street, in New York. He
sneaked off to work early in the morning and he sneaked
home at night dead tired. At night lie lit his pipe and read
the paper and asked me about school. Very important to
get good marks, he told me.
The father teaching his son all tha he knew about the
world.
All he knew about the world was that you got to get
good marks. They look at your marks. Bui who the tuck
are they? And who are we?
I asked the young socialists what my father was and
what I was. The socialists said that my father was a petty
bourgeois state employee, and the sociologists said he was
lower middle class, when the truth was much simpler. My
father was a Drudge, and his only hope in life was that his
son might become a Lesser Priest.

The airplane was an old jalopy of a CD 4. When the
motors started up I could see the loose bolts bouncing
around on the cowling. It waited an hour on the ground
before taking off in the unbelievable heat. Once we were
airborne and it cooled off a little, the stewardess
announced that we would stop somewhere in the middle
of the country, then continue to Burbank and Oakland.
I asked the stewardess where exactly we would be
stopping, and she said she didn't know; she had asked the
pilot hut couldn't get a straight answer out of him. Finally
she announced that we would be landing shortly at St.
Louis. I saw a big brown river below that just had to be
the Mississippi. But the plane didn't land. It flew on
another hour and finally came down at Springfield,
Missouri.
The non-scheduled airlines were outlawed the
following year, I believe. Can you imagine what things
would be like if they'd been allowed to continue? The $5
flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles in a DC-3 or a
DC-6 or whatever sturdy old planes you could haul up out
of forced retirement. Low overhead. No advertising
expenses: plenty of free word-of-mouth publicity. No
reservations or scheduling. Non-scheduled airlines for
non-scheduled people.
A Little Hit Longer
The flight was supposed to take 12 hours but somehow
took 18. We got to the Oakland Airport at 1 a.m., but Jim
and Betty Petras were there to meet us. Jim was a hustling
organizer who had built the Berkeley YSA into a thriving
organization in the previous year. After a few days we
were activists. Meetings all the time. Constantly meeting
new people, all of them Young Socialists or "contacts."
Assignments. Responsibilities. Progress reports. Strategy
sessions. Study groups.
There was a tremendous amount of work to be done
and I plunged in, though I really didn't understand what it
was we were doing. I supposed that it would gradually
dawn on me if I gave it a chance. I soon discovered that
there was a standard way of putting that question and a
standard way of answering. The exact litany was this:
"What is our main task in the coming period?"
"Our main task is to build the YSA."
This was not fully satisfactory. It created an image of
the organization as a growth. That has an ugly sound.
Something whose only purpose is to grow. Hope it's
benign.
What Jim Petras knew but didn't know quite how to
say, was that we were getting in practice for the
revolution: limbering up our joints, strengthening our
muscles, sharpening our eyes, developing a sense of
timing. Our image of the impending American revolution
was of course based on the image of the Russian
Revolution. And "action" in the Russian Revolution
meant a rising tide of arguments, debates and speeches.
Lenin's return to Russia in April 1917, is, most of all
the speech at the Finland station, which triggers a crucial
debute inside the Bolshevik Party to determine what line
the party's agitational organs will take in its argument
("struggle") with its opponents. The street
demonstrations in July are a failure; but in August, when
General Kornilov sets his army on the move against the
workers, Bolshevik agitators spring forth from the

factories, meet the soldiers and argm them into changing
sides.
Speech I" \plosion
Then Russia explodes in speeches. Everywhere there
are knots of people on street corners listening to
impromptu speakers from the various political parties. In
that late summer and early fall of 1917, only the
Bolshevik speakers had any passion or conviction; events
had made everyone else sound hollow. The October
Revolution just rose like a wave so mightily no one
bothered to oppose it. The whole thing was almost
bloodless throughout 1917 and halfway through 191 H.
Then the Civil War began. But that was another stor\
When we spoke about the Russian Revolution, we
didn't talk about great historical events. We talked about
what line Lenin had taken at a certain time, how various
elements in the Bolshevik Party had responded, how the
Mensheviks had stood on the such-and-such question in
other words the politics of it.
From every direction, not only from the books we
read, but also from the paintings, posters, photographs
and movies we saw about the Russian Revolution, there
seeped in on us the idea that action means making a
speech.
So, to develop ourselves as Bolsheviks, we harried our

upper-upper, lower-upper, upper-middle, lower-middle,
upper-lower, lower-lower class division as some
sociologists did. There was no need at all to give yourself a
headache.
The Big Lie which we were all taught and which we
still believed was that while in the old days there were
nobles and peasants, today we had a different system. A
lie. There are a handful of Noblemen who own the whole
country, who pay whatever taxes they feel it expedient to
pay, whose children are exempt from military service,
who can commit any crime including murder and never
see the inside of a jail. 1 am not talking about pipsqueak
influence peddlers like Richard Nixon, I mean important
people: DuPonts, Rockefellers, Mellons, Fords, and the
inheritors of lesser fortunes. You know who they are, why
pretend you don't know?
If Ted Kennedy hadn't been a Nobleman lie would
have been charged with manslaughter—maybe suspicion of
murder, under the circumstances -and held in jail for
months on impossibly high bail before his trial. But Ted
Kennedy just walked into the courtroom and walked out
again. If he hadn't been such a well-known political figure,
if he had merely been the heir to a gigantic fortune, he
probably would not have had to show up in court at all.
Priests and Drudges
The rest of the population consists mostly of Drudges.
The Drudges do whatever they are told. A Drudge thinks
he's really hot shit if he can sell his time for $4 an hour.
The Drudges spend 10 hours a week at the service of the
Nobleman. Well, it used to be 40; now so many Drudges
are working two jobs that the average is probably up to
50.
Between the Noblemen and the Drudges are an army of
Priests - doctors, lawyers, engineers, executives, editors,
and, yes, cops; people who know a little bit about how
things work and don't have to consider every thing a
miracle (the refrigerator and the election and the Miss
America contest and the penicillin injection are all
miracles to the Drudge).
Those sociology professors and young socialists were so
goddamn smart with all their theories that they never
could tell me what my social class situation was, for God's
sake. My father was a postal clerk. For 35 years he sorted
mail and was ashamed. He was always ashamed of himself,
every moment he sorted mail for 35 years at the Church
Street Station, 90 Church Street, in New York. He
sneaked off to work early in the morning and he sneaked
home at night dead tired. At night lie lit his pipe and read
the paper and asked me about school. Very important to
get good marks, he told me.
The father teaching his son all tha he knew about the
world.
All he knew about the world was that you got to get
good marks. They look at your marks. Bui who the tuck
are they? And who are we?
I asked the young socialists what my father was and
what I was. The socialists said that my father was a petty
bourgeois state employee, and the sociologists said he was
lower middle class, when the truth was much simpler. My
father was a Drudge, and his only hope in life was that his
son might become a Lesser Priest.

Speech and Give a Lecture of My Own)
The airplane was an old jalopy of a CD 4. When the
motors started up I could see the loose bolts bouncing
around on the cowling. It waited an hour on the ground
before taking off in the unbelievable heat. Once we were
airborne and it cooled off a little, the stewardess
announced that we would stop somewhere in the middle
of the country, then continue to Burbank and Oakland.
I asked the stewardess where exactly we would be
stopping, and she said she didn't know; she had asked the
pilot hut couldn't get a straight answer out of him. Finally
she announced that we would be landing shortly at St.
Louis. I saw a big brown river below that just had to be
the Mississippi. But the plane didn't land. It flew on
another hour and finally came down at Springfield,
Missouri.
The non-scheduled airlines were outlawed the
following year, I believe. Can you imagine what things
would be like if they'd been allowed to continue? The $5
flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles in a DC-3 or a
DC-6 or whatever sturdy old planes you could haul up out
of forced retirement. Low overhead. No advertising
expenses: plenty of free word-of-mouth publicity. No
reservations or scheduling. Non-scheduled airlines for
non-scheduled people.
A Little Hit Longer
The flight was supposed to take 12 hours but somehow
took 18. We got to the Oakland Airport at 1 a.m., but Jim
and Betty Petras were there to meet us. Jim was a hustling
organizer who had built the Berkeley YSA into a thriving
organization in the previous year. After a few days we
were activists. Meetings all the time. Constantly meeting
new people, all of them Young Socialists or "contacts."
Assignments. Responsibilities. Progress reports. Strategy
sessions. Study groups.
There was a tremendous amount of work to be done
and I plunged in, though I really didn't understand what it
was we were doing. I supposed that it would gradually
dawn on me if I gave it a chance. I soon discovered that
there was a standard way of putting that question and a
standard way of answering. The exact litany was this:
"What is our main task in the coming period?"
"Our main task is to build the YSA."
This was not fully satisfactory. It created an image of
the organization as a growth. That has an ugly sound.
Something whose only purpose is to grow. Hope it's
benign.
What Jim Petras knew but didn't know quite how to
say, was that we were getting in practice for the
revolution: limbering up our joints, strengthening our
muscles, sharpening our eyes, developing a sense of
timing. Our image of the impending American revolution
was of course based on the image of the Russian
Revolution. And "action" in the Russian Revolution
meant a rising tide of arguments, debates and speeches.
Lenin's return to Russia in April 1917, is, most of all
the speech at the Finland station, which triggers a crucial
debute inside the Bolshevik Party to determine what line
the party's agitational organs will take in its argument
("struggle") with its opponents. The street
demonstrations in July are a failure; but in August, when
General Kornilov sets his army on the move against the
workers, Bolshevik agitators spring forth from the

factories, meet the soldiers and argm them into changing
sides.
Speech I" \plosion
Then Russia explodes in speeches. Everywhere there
are knots of people on street corners listening to
impromptu speakers from the various political parties. In
that late summer and early fall of 1917, only the
Bolshevik speakers had any passion or conviction; events
had made everyone else sound hollow. The October
Revolution just rose like a wave so mightily no one
bothered to oppose it. The whole thing was almost
bloodless throughout 1917 and halfway through 191 H.
Then the Civil War began. But that was another stor\
When we spoke about the Russian Revolution, we
didn't talk about great historical events. We talked about
what line Lenin had taken at a certain time, how various
elements in the Bolshevik Party had responded, how the
Mensheviks had stood on the such-and-such question in
other words the politics of it.
From every direction, not only from the books we
read, but also from the paintings, posters, photographs
and movies we saw about the Russian Revolution, there
seeped in on us the idea that action means making a
speech.
So, to develop ourselves as Bolsheviks, we harried our
rivals; the Young People's Socialist League, the
free-floating Communist Party youth who would later
make up the Dußois Club, and any exotic little radical
tendency wo could find. We organized public meetings
called Young Socialist Forums, at which one of us would
deliver a lecture on some topic of political interest. Just
like little professors.
The Student's Sad Career
I had been out of college for a year and a half and was
a bit afraid to go back. Every student secretly believes
that he is really very stupid and has gotten by so far only
by faking. Turning points in a school career the first day
of high school, the first college paper to be written, the
first graduate seminar—are always terrifying experiences.
You might say the student's career is months or years of
boredom followed by weeks of terror.
I loaded myself up with history and sociology courses
because they interfered relatively little with my Young
Socialist studies and also because I was genuinely
interested in what the courses promised. The sociologists
were breaking down the myth of America-the
classless-society with hard statistical facts about social
stratification. The historians were breaking with old
fashioned political history and trying to do research on
how ordinary people had actually lived.
I also nursed the secret hope that I would be able to
discover or invent some revolutionary theory that would
be a little more interesting than the YSA's deadly tedious
Bolshevism, which had been frozen stiff when Trotsky
died in 1940.
I was a bit of a renegade in the YSA, if truth be told,
because I held that Russia was state capitalistic and not
essentially different from America, while everybody else
held that Russia was a degenerate worker's state.
Although it was not a condition of membership, it just
happened that everyone but me and one other YSAer
"supported the Soviet workers' state despite its
bureaucratic degeneration."
While everyone else "called for a political revolution in
the Soviet Union," we "called for a political revolution in
the Soviet Union." We were called "the state-capitalist

tendency' —sometimes just "state caps
In fact, everything was really an awful lot simpler than
either the\SA or the sociologists made it out to be. There
was no need to talk about "the proletariat" or "the petit
bourgeoisie," and there was no reason to postulate an
upper-upper, lower-upper, upper-middle, lower-middle,
upper-lower, lower-lower class division as some
sociologists did. There was no need at all to give yourself a

sake. My father was a postal clerk. For 35 years he sorted
mail and was ashamed. He was always ashamed of himself,
every moment he sorted mail for 35 years at the Church
Street Station, 90 Church Street, in New York. He
sneaked off to work early in the morning and he sneaked
home at night dead tired. At night lie lit his pipe and read
the paper and asked me about school. Very important to
get good marks, he told me.
The father teaching his son all tha he knew about the
world.
All he knew about the world was that you got to get
good marks. They look at your marks. Bui who the tuck
are they? And who are we?
I asked the young socialists what my father was and
what I was. The socialists said that my father was a petty
bourgeois state employee, and the sociologists said he was
lower middle class, when the truth was much simpler. My
father was a Drudge, and his only hope in life was that his
son might become a Lesser Priest.

| Six Wherein I Learn that Revolution Means Making a
Speech and Give a Lecture of My Own)
The airplane was an old jalopy of a CD 4. When the
motors started up I could see the loose bolts bouncing
around on the cowling. It waited an hour on the ground
before taking off in the unbelievable heat. Once we were
airborne and it cooled off a little, the stewardess
announced that we would stop somewhere in the middle
of the country, then continue to Burbank and Oakland.
I asked the stewardess where exactly we would be
stopping, and she said she didn't know; she had asked the
pilot hut couldn't get a straight answer out of him. Finally
she announced that we would be landing shortly at St.
Louis. I saw a big brown river below that just had to be
the Mississippi. But the plane didn't land. It flew on
another hour and finally came down at Springfield,
Missouri.
The non-scheduled airlines were outlawed the
following year, I believe. Can you imagine what things
would be like if they'd been allowed to continue? The $5
flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles in a DC-3 or a
DC-6 or whatever sturdy old planes you could haul up out
of forced retirement. Low overhead. No advertising
expenses: plenty of free word-of-mouth publicity. No
reservations or scheduling. Non-scheduled airlines for
non-scheduled people.
A Little Hit Longer
The flight was supposed to take 12 hours but somehow
took 18. We got to the Oakland Airport at 1 a.m., but Jim
and Betty Petras were there to meet us. Jim was a hustling
organizer who had built the Berkeley YSA into a thriving
organization in the previous year. After a few days we
were activists. Meetings all the time. Constantly meeting
new people, all of them Young Socialists or "contacts."
Assignments. Responsibilities. Progress reports. Strategy
sessions. Study groups.
There was a tremendous amount of work to be done
and I plunged in, though I really didn't understand what it
was we were doing. I supposed that it would gradually
dawn on me if I gave it a chance. I soon discovered that
there was a standard way of putting that question and a
standard way of answering. The exact litany was this:
"What is our main task in the coming period?"
"Our main task is to build the YSA."
This was not fully satisfactory. It created an image of
the organization as a growth. That has an ugly sound.
Something whose only purpose is to grow. Hope it's
benign.
What Jim Petras knew but didn't know quite how to
say, was that we were getting in practice for the
revolution: limbering up our joints, strengthening our
muscles, sharpening our eyes, developing a sense of
timing. Our image of the impending American revolution
was of course based on the image of the Russian
Revolution. And "action" in the Russian Revolution
meant a rising tide of arguments, debates and speeches.
Lenin's return to Russia in April 1917, is, most of all
the speech at the Finland station, which triggers a crucial
debute inside the Bolshevik Party to determine what line
the party's agitational organs will take in its argument
("struggle") with its opponents. The street
demonstrations in July are a failure; but in August, when
General Kornilov sets his army on the move against the
workers, Bolshevik agitators spring forth from the

factories, meet the soldiers and argm them into changing
sides.
Speech I" \plosion
Then Russia explodes in speeches. Everywhere there
are knots of people on street corners listening to
impromptu speakers from the various political parties. In
that late summer and early fall of 1917, only the
Bolshevik speakers had any passion or conviction; events
had made everyone else sound hollow. The October
Revolution just rose like a wave so mightily no one
bothered to oppose it. The whole thing was almost
bloodless throughout 1917 and halfway through 191 H.
Then the Civil War began. But that was another stor\
When we spoke about the Russian Revolution, we
didn't talk about great historical events. We talked about
what line Lenin had taken at a certain time, how various
elements in the Bolshevik Party had responded, how the
Mensheviks had stood on the such-and-such question in
other words the politics of it.
From every direction, not only from the books we
read, but also from the paintings, posters, photographs
and movies we saw about the Russian Revolution, there
seeped in on us the idea that action means making a
speech.
So, to develop ourselves as Bolsheviks, we harried our
rivals; the Young People's Socialist League, the
free-floating Communist Party youth who would later
make up the Dußois Club, and any exotic little radical
tendency wo could find. We organized public meetings
called Young Socialist Forums, at which one of us would
deliver a lecture on some topic of political interest. Just
like little professors.
The Student's Sad Career
I had been out of college for a year and a half and was
a bit afraid to go back. Every student secretly believes
that he is really very stupid and has gotten by so far only
by faking. Turning points in a school career the first day
of high school, the first college paper to be written, the
first graduate seminar—are always terrifying experiences.
You might say the student's career is months or years of
boredom followed by weeks of terror.
I loaded myself up with history and sociology courses
because they interfered relatively little with my Young
Socialist studies and also because I was genuinely
interested in what the courses promised. The sociologists
were breaking down the myth of America-the
classless-society with hard statistical facts about social
stratification. The historians were breaking with old
fashioned political history and trying to do research on
how ordinary people had actually lived.
I also nursed the secret hope that I would be able to
discover or invent some revolutionary theory that would
be a little more interesting than the YSA's deadly tedious
Bolshevism, which had been frozen stiff when Trotsky
died in 1940.
I was a bit of a renegade in the YSA, if truth be told,
because I held that Russia was state capitalistic and not
essentially different from America, while everybody else
held that Russia was a degenerate worker's state.
Although it was not a condition of membership, it just
happened that everyone but me and one other YSAer
"supported the Soviet workers' state despite its
bureaucratic degeneration."
While everyone else "called for a political revolution in
the Soviet Union," we "called for a political revolution in
the Soviet Union." We were called "the state-capitalist

tendency' —sometimes just "state caps
In fact, everything was really an awful lot simpler than
either the\SA or the sociologists made it out to be. There
was no need to talk about "the proletariat" or "the petit
bourgeoisie," and there was no reason to postulate an
upper-upper, lower-upper, upper-middle, lower-middle,
upper-lower, lower-lower class division as some
sociologists did. There was no need at all to give yourself a
headache.
The Big Lie which we were all taught and which we
still believed was that while in the old days there were
nobles and peasants, today we had a different system. A
lie. There are a handful of Noblemen who own the whole
country, who pay whatever taxes they feel it expedient to
pay, whose children are exempt from military service,
who can commit any crime including murder and never
see the inside of a jail. 1 am not talking about pipsqueak
influence peddlers like Richard Nixon, I mean important
people: DuPonts, Rockefellers, Mellons, Fords, and the
inheritors of lesser fortunes. You know who they are, why
pretend you don't know?
If Ted Kennedy hadn't been a Nobleman lie would
have been charged with manslaughter—maybe suspicion of
murder, under the circumstances -and held in jail for
months on impossibly high bail before his trial. But Ted
Kennedy just walked into the courtroom and walked out
again. If he hadn't been such a well-known political figure,
if he had merely been the heir to a gigantic fortune, he
probably would not have had to show up in court at all.
Priests and Drudges
The rest of the population consists mostly of Drudges.
The Drudges do whatever they are told. A Drudge thinks
he's really hot shit if he can sell his time for $4 an hour.
The Drudges spend 10 hours a week at the service of the
Nobleman. Well, it used to be 40; now so many Drudges
are working two jobs that the average is probably up to
50.
Between the Noblemen and the Drudges are an army of
Priests - doctors, lawyers, engineers, executives, editors,
and, yes, cops; people who know a little bit about how
things work and don't have to consider every thing a
miracle (the refrigerator and the election and the Miss
America contest and the penicillin injection are all
miracles to the Drudge).
Those sociology professors and young socialists were so
goddamn smart with all their theories that they never
could tell me what my social class situation was, for God's
sake. My father was a postal clerk. For 35 years he sorted
mail and was ashamed. He was always ashamed of himself,
every moment he sorted mail for 35 years at the Church
Street Station, 90 Church Street, in New York. He
sneaked off to work early in the morning and he sneaked
home at night dead tired. At night lie lit his pipe and read
the paper and asked me about school. Very important to
get good marks, he told me.
The father teaching his son all tha he knew about the

All he knew about the world was that you got to get
good marks. They look at your marks. Bui who the tuck
