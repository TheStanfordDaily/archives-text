# No More Muzak
## Can The Audience React? 
### DALE PARKER 
It is increasingly difficult to
write anything worthwhile about
symphony concerts. More and
more my mind strays from the
music into a cloud which hovers
above the audience. The music
itself can be heard just as well
(perhaps better) on a decent
stereo, but only at a concert can
one tell how the sounds affect
people.
Yet, I can't even do that
anymore. When I watch the
people in the lobby or listen to
their comments during the pauses
in the program, I wonder what
they are doing there. Very few
appear to be enjoying the music.
The extent of their involvement is
to stifle their coughing until the
piece ends, and the only
demonstration of feeling is the
mass applause at the end,
invariably calling Maestro Ozawa
back for a few more bows. It is
the worst kind of ritual, ignorant
and unconscious.
Medium (lu> Massage?
McLuhan says the medium is
the message. Mahler said that the
notes don't count; it is the
people's reaction to those notes
which is important. Charles Ives
said that to most people great
music is that which lets their ears
lie back and fall asleep.
Think about these things and
watch the audience at a concert.
Does anyone seem to be affected
by the performance? There are no
signs of life. They might as well
pour blacktop over everything and
make a parking lot. Concert halls
are dying.
Music Lives
Do not misunderstand. Music
lives. I believe in it, for it is
central to the unification of the
world it overcomes national
boundaries and speaks for all
times in all languages. (One of the
works this week featured a
Japanese conductor with an
American orchestra, doing a
composition about Spain created
by a Frenchman.)
But music alone is not enough.
Unless the music communicates it
is a waste of time, and the formal
concert hall ritual is a wall that
few seem to penetrate. Unless

applause. Perhaps his brass bands
should march down the aisles,
instead of rising feebly from the
rear of the stage.
I am sure that Seiji Ozawa
knew what was happening. He
conducted with a dancer's grace
and expressiveness, and every
moment was a struggle against
entropy. Jacqueline Du Pre also
played as if she cared, confronting
the orchestra, showing us what a
battle a concerto can be, if only
we open ourselves to it.
Awaiting Sinfonia
It will be interesting to see
what happens next week when the
Oakland Symphony presents
Luciano Berio's "Sinfonia."
Premiered last year in New York,
the work is startling in its impact.
Without doubt it will be imitated,
for it is the music we shall hear in
thy years to come. It is the
musical equivalent of 2001, an
oddessey of our minds in sounds.
Berio employs the Swingle
Singers, who sing and speak in
several languages, culminating in
the third movement, a schorzo of
such dimension that the whole
history of music parades by, while
the singers alternately shout,
phil osophize, make jokes, scream
radical slogans, sing, beg, and
cajole the audience to come with

somehow the wall can be broken
(between orchestra and audience,
conductor and usher, music and
Muzak) we might as well go out
and buy a record.
Ives l ails
At Wednesday's San Francisco
Symphony concert, even Charles
Ives' "Central Park in the Dark"
(a thorny modern piece after
more than half a century) failed
to stimulate any audience
response other than polite
them into the future. If is a
collage, with Mahler as
foundation, merging into Wagner,
Beethoven, Ives, the demonic
apocalypse of Ravel's Valse, and
many more. More than any work
I've heard in years, it reaches me,
changes with me, and changes me.
Sinfonia is a work of art that
transcends categories and tears
down walls. Maybe it will even
draw some hissing or booing. If
this piece doesn't reach the
audience, I'm not sure what can.

Ives l ails
At Wednesday's San Francisco
Symphony concert, even Charles
Ives' "Central Park in the Dark"
(a thorny modern piece after
more than half a century) failed
to stimulate any audience
response other than polite
them into the future. If is a
collage, with Mahler as
foundation, merging into Wagner,
Beethoven, Ives, the demonic
apocalypse of Ravel's Valse, and
many more. More than any work
I've heard in years, it reaches me,
changes with me, and changes me.
Sinfonia is a work of art that
transcends categories and tears
down walls. Maybe it will even
draw some hissing or booing. If
this piece doesn't reach the
audience, I'm not sure what can.
It is increasingly difficult to
write anything worthwhile about
symphony concerts. More and
more my mind strays from the
music into a cloud which hovers
above the audience. The music
itself can be heard just as well
(perhaps better) on a decent
stereo, but only at a concert can
one tell how the sounds affect
people.
Yet, I can't even do that
anymore. When I watch the
people in the lobby or listen to
their comments during the pauses
in the program, I wonder what
they are doing there. Very few
appear to be enjoying the music.
The extent of their involvement is
to stifle their coughing until the
piece ends, and the only
demonstration of feeling is the
mass applause at the end,
invariably calling Maestro Ozawa
back for a few more bows. It is
the worst kind of ritual, ignorant
and unconscious.
Medium (lu> Massage?
McLuhan says the medium is
the message. Mahler said that the
notes don't count; it is the
people's reaction to those notes
which is important. Charles Ives
said that to most people great
music is that which lets their ears
lie back and fall asleep.
Think about these things and
watch the audience at a concert.
Does anyone seem to be affected
by the performance? There are no
signs of life. They might as well
pour blacktop over everything and
make a parking lot. Concert halls
are dying.
Music Lives
Do not misunderstand. Music
lives. I believe in it, for it is
central to the unification of the
world it overcomes national
boundaries and speaks for all
times in all languages. (One of the
works this week featured a
Japanese conductor with an
American orchestra, doing a
composition about Spain created
by a Frenchman.)
But music alone is not enough.
Unless the music communicates it
is a waste of time, and the formal
concert hall ritual is a wall that
few seem to penetrate. Unless

applause. Perhaps his brass bands
should march down the aisles,
instead of rising feebly from the
rear of the stage.
I am sure that Seiji Ozawa
knew what was happening. He
conducted with a dancer's grace
and expressiveness, and every
moment was a struggle against
entropy. Jacqueline Du Pre also
played as if she cared, confronting
the orchestra, showing us what a
battle a concerto can be, if only
we open ourselves to it.
Awaiting Sinfonia
It will be interesting to see
what happens next week when the
Oakland Symphony presents
Luciano Berio's "Sinfonia."
Premiered last year in New York,
the work is startling in its impact.
Without doubt it will be imitated,
for it is the music we shall hear in
thy years to come. It is the
musical equivalent of 2001, an
oddessey of our minds in sounds.
Berio employs the Swingle
Singers, who sing and speak in
several languages, culminating in
the third movement, a schorzo of
such dimension that the whole
history of music parades by, while
the singers alternately shout,
phil osophize, make jokes, scream
radical slogans, sing, beg, and
cajole the audience to come with

somehow the wall can be broken

conductor and usher, music and
Muzak) we might as well go out
