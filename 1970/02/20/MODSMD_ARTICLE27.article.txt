# Troupe Show
## 
### 
The San Francisco Mime
Troupe has decided to let some
"Fresh Air" into the Bay Area.
Their new bi weekly program on
KQED FM, 88.5, will premiere on
Wednesday night, February 25th,
at 9 p.m.
Concerned with increasing the
channels of information, not
sponsored by and ultima tely
answerable to big industry and
commercial enterprises, the
Troupe plans to set off plenty of
laughter, perhaps outrage, and
definitely opposition to the
powers that reside in sanctioned
positions of power in America.
The format of the show remains
flexible, allowing itself to take
note and respond to the passage
of events between programs.
