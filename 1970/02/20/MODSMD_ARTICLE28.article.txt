Editor, THE DAILY:
After reading "Campus
Cuisine" about "Fab Far-Out
Foreign Foods," I wondered if
Cathy Cooper has ever eaten any
authentic Chinese food. Her
statement about "Chinese cooking
containing infinitesimal amounts
of meat" is a one-sided viewpoint.
She should note that the three
dishes she mentioned in her article
are of typos that contain a lot of
vegetables and a small amount of
meat. If she would, however, look
at a Chinese menu at any typical
Chinese restaurant (don't forget,
this does not include
American-Chinese dishes; her
three dishes are not Chinese
dishes, they are American-Chinese
dishes), she would notice that
there are more dishes with lots of
meat in it than dishes with lots of
vegetables in it.
Furthermore, her "rhetoric"

("dispose" and "conceal") seems
to denounce Chinese foods by
emphasizing that Chinese cooking
deals primarily with left overs. I
think Cathy might be mistaking a
personal experience than what is
really the truth. I just wonder
how does her guests like her
Chinese cooking (or whatever it
is). However, if she or anyone else
tends to disagree with me, I would
be more than willing to go on a
small Chinese meal. I live at
Branner Hall. Therefore, I hope
the people who have been
mistaking American-Chinese food
for Chinese food, would one of
these days truly appreciate
authentic Chinese food.
