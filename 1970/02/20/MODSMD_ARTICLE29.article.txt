# ROTC Communications
## 
### 
The following is the complete text of
President Pitzer's letter to the Steering
Committee of the Academic Council:
On February 13, 1969, the Senate adopted six
of eight recommendations from the Majority
Report of its ad hoc Committee on ROTC, and
referred two other recommendations to a
committee to be established subsequently (See
SenD 110 329). Recommendation Six stated that
"University authorities should promptly initiate
action leading to revision or termination of the
contracts between Stanford and the armed
forces ...
On my instructions, Vice Provost Brooks began
negotiations with the three services for revision of
the contracts to bring ROTC as closely as possible
into conformance with the recommendations of
the Senate. At about the same time, 1 also
appointed a President's Advisory Committee on
ROTC Affairs in general accordance with
Recommendation Six, the faculty members being
recommended by the Senate Committee on
Committees and the student members by the then
ASSU President, Denis Hayes.
On October 22, 1969, the Professor of Military
Science, Colonel Stanley M. Ramey, with the
approval of the Department of the Army,
submitted a proposal for revision of the Army
ROTC contract, pursuant to Mr. Brooks' request.
(See SenD no. 321.) On October 30, I asked the
President's Advisory Committee on ROTC Affairs
for advice on the proposal.
The Committee has spent the past two months
(Minutes are on file in the Academic Secretary's
Office) considering the Army proposal. At the
same time, the Air Force and the Navy have
indicated that they would generally consider the
fate of this proposal as setting a broad precedent
for their own approaches to contract revision. In
other words, if the Army proposal is acceptable to
the University, we can expect the other two
services to use it as a model for similar proposals.
1 now have the Committee's recommendation; a
copy is attached (See SenD no. 332). The
Committee, by a six-to-two vote, has
recommended that I accept the Army proposal for
revision of the ROTC contract with one or two
minor changes, which have been made, and subject
to obtaining the "advice and consent of the Senate
on thyproposal for the granting of academic credit
on a course-by-course basis in accordance with the
procedures and standards of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies."
In accordance with the Committee's
recommendation, I therefore request that the
Steering Committee place this question
prominently on the Agenda of the Senate for its
January 22, 1970 meeting. There is some urgency
since the three services need to know whether or
not they can enroll scholarship students in the
coming Fall term.
I should state that I, personally, find the Army
proposal reasonable and acceptable, and very close
indeed to the recommendations adopted by the
Senate on February 13, 1969. The Army has
offered substantial concessions to the University
and seems to me to have met virtually every
requirement except on the matter of individual
student contracts (see Senate Recommendations
Four and Eight). Legislative remedy seems
necessary, and I agree with the Army's judgment
that the present congressional climate is definitely
not propitious for an effort to secure such remedy.
The question of granting limited academic
credit is the crux of the matter before us. The
propositi submitted by the Army accepts as a
starting position that there will be no blanket
credit for military-taught courses of military
training and education. But the proposal calls for
the review of such courses "in accordance with
normal University procedures and to grant
appropriate academic credit toward graduation for
those courses which meet established University
standards." The President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs has interpreted this to mean that
selected proposals for selected courses would be
submitted to the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which has jurisdiction over
non-departmental undergraduate courses,
specifically Undergraduate Specials, and which has
a regular procedure for reviewing course proposals.
The Army is prepared to accept the Committee's
judgment and let the issue of credit stand or fall
on the Committee's decision on each course
proposal.
In contrast with the present 27 quarter units of
credit for military-taught courses in military
training and education in the Army ROTC
program, the Army proposes to submit to the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies individual
course proposals up to a combined total of six to
nine quarter units.
In regard to other matters included in the
recommendations adopted by the Senate on
February 13, 1969, the Army proposal abolishes
departmental status as well as faculty rank and
Academic Council membership. The program is
removed from the School of Humanities and
Sciences and placed under the Provost's Office,
thus ensuring adequate supervision. A Center lor
Military Studies is substituted for the present
Department of Military Science, and the title
"Director" is accorded the senior officer instead of
"Professor." Other officers would be entitled
Associate or Assistant Directors. The status of the
military officers assigned to the Army ROTC unit
would be the same as that of temporary members
of the University staff, which currently includes
about 1,750 persons in addition to the Faculty.
The perquisites of the University Stal 112 include
listing in the Faculty-Staff Director, library

privileges, reserved parking stickers, eligibility for
consideratiun for Faculty Club membership,
reduced ticket prices for athletic season tickets,
and the like. They may attend regular meetings of
the Academic Council without the privileges of the
floor or of the vote.
This status is that normally conferred upon
professional persons attached temporarily to the
University. A group analogous to the military
officers assigned to ROTC duty at Stanford might
well be the members of the Stanford United
Ministry who perform various campus services
while basically employed by organizations or
institutions other than the University; and from
time to time give undergraduate special courses for
credit. They too could be members of the
University Staff.
It appears to me that this proposal is a
reasonable one. Subject to Senate approval of the
proposed credit mechanism, 1 intend to accept the
Army propositi and put it into effect as rapidly as
possible.
It is a matter of considerable University interest
that a reasonable compromise between the
military services and the academic community by
reached. There are substantial numbers in the
faculty and in the student body who wish to see
ROTC continued in some form, with some degree
of academic credit, in ways that do not do
violence to academic standards. It seems to me
that the Army proposal, which has been carefully
and thoughtfully reviewed by the Advisory
Committee on ROTC Affairs, meets the principal
objections to the existing program and offers a
reasonable prospect for the future. I strongly urge
favorable Senate consideration.
The following are exerpts of the Army's
original ROTC revision plans, which were
submitted to the University administration
in October:
3. The Department of the Army has established
certain essential elements which must characterize
the ROTC and these are the basis for the proposed
revisions and comments in paragraphs 5 and 6.
These essential elements are:
a. Departmental status.
—b. Adequate facilities on campus furnished by
the institution at no expense to the Government.
c. Military Science Department course
offerings listed in the institution's catalogues.
d. Military Science subjects offered during the
academic day, on the same basis as other
institutional course offerings.
—e. Selection, by mutual agreement, of
academic subjects applicable to a military career as
part of the ROTC curriculum.
—112. Senior officer to have status of a
department head and rank of professor.
—g. Subordination to a dean or an
administrative governing official of the institution.
5. In line with the above paragraphs 3 and 4,
the following revisions to the institutional
contract, DA Form 918, Application and
Agreement for Establishment of Army Reserve
Officers Training Corps Unit, are offered
(deletions from current provisions are bracketed
and additions are boldface):
Paragraph 2a. To establish a [Department of
Military Science] Center for Military Studies as an
integral element in the academic and
administrative [department] structure of this
institution and to adopt as a part of its curriculum
(1) a four year course of military instruction;(2) a
two year course of advanced military instruction;
or (3) both of the above [which the Secretary of
the Army will prescribe and conduct.]
Paragraph 2d. [To grant appropriate academic
credit toward graduation for successful completion
of courses offered by the Department of Military
Science. ]
To provide for the review of courses ottered by
The Center for Military Studies in accordance with
normal University procedures and to grant
appropriate academic credit toward graduation for
those courses which meet established University
standards.
7. With respect to requested changes in the
individual contracts so as to conform to actual
practice and the so-called punitive clauses:
—DA Form 597-2-R, Army ROTC Financial
Assistance Contract;
—DA Form 3036-R, Acknowledgement of
Understanding of Service Requirements Army
ROTC Financial Assistance Program; and
— SAH Form 144, Acknowledgement of
Understanding of Service Requirements,
the law, Section 2107, Title 10, United States
Code, as implemented by Army Regulations (AR
145-1), provides the scholarship student with the
opportunity to terminate his scholarship at his
request without penalty at any time during the
first two years of a four year scholarship and the
first year of a two year scholarship.
These provisions insure that a scholarship
student is not irrevocably committed to a military
career as he enters the ROTC scholarship program,
offering him a reasonable period of time to give
further consideration to his decision. The cadet is
informed of the provisions of the regulations at
the time of enrollment into the scholarship
program. The specific provisions of the AR 145-1
read as follows:
"A 2-year scholarship may be terminated at any
time prior to the completion of the first year. The
first year of the scholarship is completed with the
beginning of the first semester or fall quarter of
the second academic year or at the end of 12
months from the beginning of the scholarship. A
4-year scholarship may be terminated at any time
prior to completion of the basic course. The basic
course is completed on the last scheduled day.

on thyproposal for the granting of academic credit
on a course-by-course basis in accordance with the
procedures and standards of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies."
In accordance with the Committee's
recommendation, I therefore request that the
Steering Committee place this question
prominently on the Agenda of the Senate for its
January 22, 1970 meeting. There is some urgency
since the three services need to know whether or
not they can enroll scholarship students in the
coming Fall term.
I should state that I, personally, find the Army
proposal reasonable and acceptable, and very close
indeed to the recommendations adopted by the
Senate on February 13, 1969. The Army has
offered substantial concessions to the University
and seems to me to have met virtually every
requirement except on the matter of individual
student contracts (see Senate Recommendations
Four and Eight). Legislative remedy seems
necessary, and I agree with the Army's judgment
that the present congressional climate is definitely
not propitious for an effort to secure such remedy.
The question of granting limited academic
credit is the crux of the matter before us. The
propositi submitted by the Army accepts as a
starting position that there will be no blanket
credit for military-taught courses of military
training and education. But the proposal calls for
the review of such courses "in accordance with
normal University procedures and to grant
appropriate academic credit toward graduation for
those courses which meet established University
standards." The President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs has interpreted this to mean that
selected proposals for selected courses would be
submitted to the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which has jurisdiction over
non-departmental undergraduate courses,
specifically Undergraduate Specials, and which has
a regular procedure for reviewing course proposals.
The Army is prepared to accept the Committee's
judgment and let the issue of credit stand or fall
on the Committee's decision on each course
proposal.
In contrast with the present 27 quarter units of
credit for military-taught courses in military
training and education in the Army ROTC
program, the Army proposes to submit to the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies individual
course proposals up to a combined total of six to
nine quarter units.
In regard to other matters included in the
recommendations adopted by the Senate on
February 13, 1969, the Army proposal abolishes
departmental status as well as faculty rank and
Academic Council membership. The program is
removed from the School of Humanities and
Sciences and placed under the Provost's Office,
thus ensuring adequate supervision. A Center lor
Military Studies is substituted for the present
Department of Military Science, and the title
"Director" is accorded the senior officer instead of
"Professor." Other officers would be entitled
Associate or Assistant Directors. The status of the
military officers assigned to the Army ROTC unit
would be the same as that of temporary members
of the University staff, which currently includes
about 1,750 persons in addition to the Faculty.
The perquisites of the University Stal 112 include
listing in the Faculty-Staff Director, library

privileges, reserved parking stickers, eligibility for
consideratiun for Faculty Club membership,
reduced ticket prices for athletic season tickets,
and the like. They may attend regular meetings of
the Academic Council without the privileges of the
floor or of the vote.
This status is that normally conferred upon
professional persons attached temporarily to the
University. A group analogous to the military
officers assigned to ROTC duty at Stanford might
well be the members of the Stanford United
Ministry who perform various campus services
while basically employed by organizations or
institutions other than the University; and from
time to time give undergraduate special courses for
credit. They too could be members of the
University Staff.
It appears to me that this proposal is a
reasonable one. Subject to Senate approval of the
proposed credit mechanism, 1 intend to accept the
Army propositi and put it into effect as rapidly as
possible.
It is a matter of considerable University interest
that a reasonable compromise between the
military services and the academic community by
reached. There are substantial numbers in the
faculty and in the student body who wish to see
ROTC continued in some form, with some degree
of academic credit, in ways that do not do
violence to academic standards. It seems to me
that the Army proposal, which has been carefully
and thoughtfully reviewed by the Advisory
Committee on ROTC Affairs, meets the principal
objections to the existing program and offers a
reasonable prospect for the future. I strongly urge
favorable Senate consideration.
The following are exerpts of the Army's
original ROTC revision plans, which were
submitted to the University administration
in October:
3. The Department of the Army has established
certain essential elements which must characterize
the ROTC and these are the basis for the proposed
revisions and comments in paragraphs 5 and 6.
These essential elements are:
a. Departmental status.
—b. Adequate facilities on campus furnished by
the institution at no expense to the Government.
c. Military Science Department course
offerings listed in the institution's catalogues.
d. Military Science subjects offered during the
academic day, on the same basis as other
institutional course offerings.
—e. Selection, by mutual agreement, of
academic subjects applicable to a military career as
part of the ROTC curriculum.
—112. Senior officer to have status of a
department head and rank of professor.
—g. Subordination to a dean or an
administrative governing official of the institution.
5. In line with the above paragraphs 3 and 4,
the following revisions to the institutional
contract, DA Form 918, Application and
Agreement for Establishment of Army Reserve
Officers Training Corps Unit, are offered
(deletions from current provisions are bracketed
and additions are boldface):
Paragraph 2a. To establish a [Department of
Military Science] Center for Military Studies as an
integral element in the academic and
administrative [department] structure of this
institution and to adopt as a part of its curriculum
(1) a four year course of military instruction;(2) a
two year course of advanced military instruction;
or (3) both of the above [which the Secretary of
the Army will prescribe and conduct.]
Paragraph 2d. [To grant appropriate academic
credit toward graduation for successful completion
of courses offered by the Department of Military
Science. ]
To provide for the review of courses ottered by
The Center for Military Studies in accordance with
normal University procedures and to grant
appropriate academic credit toward graduation for
those courses which meet established University
standards.
7. With respect to requested changes in the
individual contracts so as to conform to actual
practice and the so-called punitive clauses:
—DA Form 597-2-R, Army ROTC Financial
Assistance Contract;
—DA Form 3036-R, Acknowledgement of
Understanding of Service Requirements Army
ROTC Financial Assistance Program; and
— SAH Form 144, Acknowledgement of
Understanding of Service Requirements,
the law, Section 2107, Title 10, United States
Code, as implemented by Army Regulations (AR
145-1), provides the scholarship student with the
opportunity to terminate his scholarship at his
request without penalty at any time during the
first two years of a four year scholarship and the
first year of a two year scholarship.
These provisions insure that a scholarship
student is not irrevocably committed to a military
career as he enters the ROTC scholarship program,
offering him a reasonable period of time to give
further consideration to his decision. The cadet is
informed of the provisions of the regulations at
the time of enrollment into the scholarship
program. The specific provisions of the AR 145-1
read as follows:
"A 2-year scholarship may be terminated at any
time prior to the completion of the first year. The
first year of the scholarship is completed with the
beginning of the first semester or fall quarter of
the second academic year or at the end of 12
months from the beginning of the scholarship. A
4-year scholarship may be terminated at any time
prior to completion of the basic course. The basic
course is completed on the last scheduled day.
The following is the complete text of
President Pitzer's letter to the Steering
Committee of the Academic Council:
On February 13, 1969, the Senate adopted six
of eight recommendations from the Majority
Report of its ad hoc Committee on ROTC, and
referred two other recommendations to a
committee to be established subsequently (See
SenD 110 329). Recommendation Six stated that
"University authorities should promptly initiate
action leading to revision or termination of the
contracts between Stanford and the armed
forces ...
On my instructions, Vice Provost Brooks began
negotiations with the three services for revision of
the contracts to bring ROTC as closely as possible
into conformance with the recommendations of
the Senate. At about the same time, 1 also
appointed a President's Advisory Committee on
ROTC Affairs in general accordance with
Recommendation Six, the faculty members being
recommended by the Senate Committee on
Committees and the student members by the then
ASSU President, Denis Hayes.
On October 22, 1969, the Professor of Military
Science, Colonel Stanley M. Ramey, with the
approval of the Department of the Army,
submitted a proposal for revision of the Army
ROTC contract, pursuant to Mr. Brooks' request.
(See SenD no. 321.) On October 30, I asked the
President's Advisory Committee on ROTC Affairs
for advice on the proposal.
The Committee has spent the past two months
(Minutes are on file in the Academic Secretary's
Office) considering the Army proposal. At the
same time, the Air Force and the Navy have
indicated that they would generally consider the
fate of this proposal as setting a broad precedent
for their own approaches to contract revision. In
other words, if the Army proposal is acceptable to
the University, we can expect the other two
services to use it as a model for similar proposals.
1 now have the Committee's recommendation; a
copy is attached (See SenD no. 332). The
Committee, by a six-to-two vote, has
recommended that I accept the Army proposal for
revision of the ROTC contract with one or two
minor changes, which have been made, and subject
to obtaining the "advice and consent of the Senate
on thyproposal for the granting of academic credit
on a course-by-course basis in accordance with the

recommendations adopted by the Senate on
February 13, 1969, the Army proposal abolishes
departmental status as well as faculty rank and
Academic Council membership. The program is
removed from the School of Humanities and
Sciences and placed under the Provost's Office,
thus ensuring adequate supervision. A Center lor
Military Studies is substituted for the present
Department of Military Science, and the title
"Director" is accorded the senior officer instead of
"Professor." Other officers would be entitled
Associate or Assistant Directors. The status of the
military officers assigned to the Army ROTC unit
would be the same as that of temporary members
of the University staff, which currently includes
about 1,750 persons in addition to the Faculty.
The perquisites of the University Stal 112 include
listing in the Faculty-Staff Director, library

privileges, reserved parking stickers, eligibility for
consideratiun for Faculty Club membership,
reduced ticket prices for athletic season tickets,
and the like. They may attend regular meetings of
the Academic Council without the privileges of the
floor or of the vote.
This status is that normally conferred upon
professional persons attached temporarily to the
University. A group analogous to the military
officers assigned to ROTC duty at Stanford might
well be the members of the Stanford United
Ministry who perform various campus services
while basically employed by organizations or
institutions other than the University; and from
time to time give undergraduate special courses for
credit. They too could be members of the
University Staff.
It appears to me that this proposal is a
reasonable one. Subject to Senate approval of the
proposed credit mechanism, 1 intend to accept the
Army propositi and put it into effect as rapidly as
possible.
It is a matter of considerable University interest
that a reasonable compromise between the
military services and the academic community by
reached. There are substantial numbers in the
faculty and in the student body who wish to see
ROTC continued in some form, with some degree
of academic credit, in ways that do not do
violence to academic standards. It seems to me
that the Army proposal, which has been carefully
and thoughtfully reviewed by the Advisory
Committee on ROTC Affairs, meets the principal
objections to the existing program and offers a
reasonable prospect for the future. I strongly urge
favorable Senate consideration.
The following are exerpts of the Army's
original ROTC revision plans, which were
submitted to the University administration
in October:
3. The Department of the Army has established
certain essential elements which must characterize
the ROTC and these are the basis for the proposed
revisions and comments in paragraphs 5 and 6.
These essential elements are:
a. Departmental status.
—b. Adequate facilities on campus furnished by
the institution at no expense to the Government.
c. Military Science Department course
offerings listed in the institution's catalogues.
d. Military Science subjects offered during the
academic day, on the same basis as other
institutional course offerings.
—e. Selection, by mutual agreement, of
academic subjects applicable to a military career as
part of the ROTC curriculum.
—112. Senior officer to have status of a
department head and rank of professor.
—g. Subordination to a dean or an
administrative governing official of the institution.
5. In line with the above paragraphs 3 and 4,
the following revisions to the institutional
contract, DA Form 918, Application and
Agreement for Establishment of Army Reserve
Officers Training Corps Unit, are offered
(deletions from current provisions are bracketed
and additions are boldface):
Paragraph 2a. To establish a [Department of
Military Science] Center for Military Studies as an
integral element in the academic and
administrative [department] structure of this
institution and to adopt as a part of its curriculum
(1) a four year course of military instruction;(2) a
two year course of advanced military instruction;
or (3) both of the above [which the Secretary of
the Army will prescribe and conduct.]
Paragraph 2d. [To grant appropriate academic
credit toward graduation for successful completion
of courses offered by the Department of Military
Science. ]
To provide for the review of courses ottered by
The Center for Military Studies in accordance with
normal University procedures and to grant
appropriate academic credit toward graduation for
those courses which meet established University
standards.
7. With respect to requested changes in the
individual contracts so as to conform to actual
practice and the so-called punitive clauses:
—DA Form 597-2-R, Army ROTC Financial
Assistance Contract;
—DA Form 3036-R, Acknowledgement of
Understanding of Service Requirements Army
ROTC Financial Assistance Program; and
— SAH Form 144, Acknowledgement of
Understanding of Service Requirements,
the law, Section 2107, Title 10, United States
Code, as implemented by Army Regulations (AR
145-1), provides the scholarship student with the
opportunity to terminate his scholarship at his
request without penalty at any time during the
first two years of a four year scholarship and the
first year of a two year scholarship.
These provisions insure that a scholarship
student is not irrevocably committed to a military
career as he enters the ROTC scholarship program,
offering him a reasonable period of time to give
further consideration to his decision. The cadet is
informed of the provisions of the regulations at
the time of enrollment into the scholarship
program. The specific provisions of the AR 145-1
read as follows:
"A 2-year scholarship may be terminated at any
time prior to the completion of the first year. The
first year of the scholarship is completed with the
beginning of the first semester or fall quarter of
the second academic year or at the end of 12
months from the beginning of the scholarship. A
4-year scholarship may be terminated at any time
prior to completion of the basic course. The basic
course is completed on the last scheduled day.
The following is the complete text of
President Pitzer's letter to the Steering
Committee of the Academic Council:
On February 13, 1969, the Senate adopted six
of eight recommendations from the Majority
Report of its ad hoc Committee on ROTC, and
referred two other recommendations to a
committee to be established subsequently (See
SenD 110 329). Recommendation Six stated that
"University authorities should promptly initiate
action leading to revision or termination of the
contracts between Stanford and the armed
forces ...
On my instructions, Vice Provost Brooks began
negotiations with the three services for revision of
the contracts to bring ROTC as closely as possible
into conformance with the recommendations of
the Senate. At about the same time, 1 also
appointed a President's Advisory Committee on
ROTC Affairs in general accordance with
Recommendation Six, the faculty members being
recommended by the Senate Committee on
Committees and the student members by the then
ASSU President, Denis Hayes.
On October 22, 1969, the Professor of Military
Science, Colonel Stanley M. Ramey, with the
approval of the Department of the Army,
submitted a proposal for revision of the Army
ROTC contract, pursuant to Mr. Brooks' request.
(See SenD no. 321.) On October 30, I asked the
President's Advisory Committee on ROTC Affairs
for advice on the proposal.
The Committee has spent the past two months
(Minutes are on file in the Academic Secretary's
Office) considering the Army proposal. At the
same time, the Air Force and the Navy have
indicated that they would generally consider the
fate of this proposal as setting a broad precedent
for their own approaches to contract revision. In
other words, if the Army proposal is acceptable to
the University, we can expect the other two
services to use it as a model for similar proposals.
1 now have the Committee's recommendation; a
copy is attached (See SenD no. 332). The
Committee, by a six-to-two vote, has
recommended that I accept the Army proposal for
revision of the ROTC contract with one or two
minor changes, which have been made, and subject
to obtaining the "advice and consent of the Senate
on thyproposal for the granting of academic credit
on a course-by-course basis in accordance with the
procedures and standards of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies."
In accordance with the Committee's
recommendation, I therefore request that the
Steering Committee place this question
prominently on the Agenda of the Senate for its
January 22, 1970 meeting. There is some urgency
since the three services need to know whether or
not they can enroll scholarship students in the
coming Fall term.
I should state that I, personally, find the Army
proposal reasonable and acceptable, and very close
indeed to the recommendations adopted by the
Senate on February 13, 1969. The Army has
offered substantial concessions to the University
and seems to me to have met virtually every
requirement except on the matter of individual
student contracts (see Senate Recommendations
Four and Eight). Legislative remedy seems
necessary, and I agree with the Army's judgment
that the present congressional climate is definitely
not propitious for an effort to secure such remedy.
The question of granting limited academic
credit is the crux of the matter before us. The
propositi submitted by the Army accepts as a
starting position that there will be no blanket
credit for military-taught courses of military
training and education. But the proposal calls for
the review of such courses "in accordance with
normal University procedures and to grant
appropriate academic credit toward graduation for
those courses which meet established University
standards." The President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs has interpreted this to mean that
selected proposals for selected courses would be
submitted to the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which has jurisdiction over
non-departmental undergraduate courses,
specifically Undergraduate Specials, and which has
a regular procedure for reviewing course proposals.
The Army is prepared to accept the Committee's
judgment and let the issue of credit stand or fall
on the Committee's decision on each course
proposal.
In contrast with the present 27 quarter units of
credit for military-taught courses in military
training and education in the Army ROTC
program, the Army proposes to submit to the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies individual
course proposals up to a combined total of six to
nine quarter units.
In regard to other matters included in the
recommendations adopted by the Senate on
February 13, 1969, the Army proposal abolishes
departmental status as well as faculty rank and
Academic Council membership. The program is
removed from the School of Humanities and
Sciences and placed under the Provost's Office,
thus ensuring adequate supervision. A Center lor
Military Studies is substituted for the present
Department of Military Science, and the title
"Director" is accorded the senior officer instead of
"Professor." Other officers would be entitled
Associate or Assistant Directors. The status of the
military officers assigned to the Army ROTC unit
would be the same as that of temporary members
of the University staff, which currently includes
about 1,750 persons in addition to the Faculty.
The perquisites of the University Stal 112 include

favorable Senate consideration.
The following are exerpts of the Army's
original ROTC revision plans, which were
submitted to the University administration
in October:
3. The Department of the Army has established
certain essential elements which must characterize
the ROTC and these are the basis for the proposed
revisions and comments in paragraphs 5 and 6.
These essential elements are:
a. Departmental status.
—b. Adequate facilities on campus furnished by
the institution at no expense to the Government.
c. Military Science Department course
offerings listed in the institution's catalogues.
d. Military Science subjects offered during the
academic day, on the same basis as other
institutional course offerings.
—e. Selection, by mutual agreement, of
academic subjects applicable to a military career as
part of the ROTC curriculum.
—112. Senior officer to have status of a
department head and rank of professor.
—g. Subordination to a dean or an
administrative governing official of the institution.
5. In line with the above paragraphs 3 and 4,
the following revisions to the institutional
contract, DA Form 918, Application and
Agreement for Establishment of Army Reserve
Officers Training Corps Unit, are offered
(deletions from current provisions are bracketed
and additions are boldface):
Paragraph 2a. To establish a [Department of
Military Science] Center for Military Studies as an
integral element in the academic and
administrative [department] structure of this
institution and to adopt as a part of its curriculum
(1) a four year course of military instruction;(2) a
two year course of advanced military instruction;
or (3) both of the above [which the Secretary of
the Army will prescribe and conduct.]
Paragraph 2d. [To grant appropriate academic
credit toward graduation for successful completion
of courses offered by the Department of Military
Science. ]
To provide for the review of courses ottered by
The Center for Military Studies in accordance with
normal University procedures and to grant
appropriate academic credit toward graduation for
those courses which meet established University
standards.
7. With respect to requested changes in the
individual contracts so as to conform to actual
practice and the so-called punitive clauses:
—DA Form 597-2-R, Army ROTC Financial
Assistance Contract;
—DA Form 3036-R, Acknowledgement of
Understanding of Service Requirements Army
ROTC Financial Assistance Program; and
— SAH Form 144, Acknowledgement of
Understanding of Service Requirements,
the law, Section 2107, Title 10, United States
Code, as implemented by Army Regulations (AR
145-1), provides the scholarship student with the
opportunity to terminate his scholarship at his
request without penalty at any time during the
first two years of a four year scholarship and the
first year of a two year scholarship.
These provisions insure that a scholarship
student is not irrevocably committed to a military
career as he enters the ROTC scholarship program,
offering him a reasonable period of time to give
further consideration to his decision. The cadet is
informed of the provisions of the regulations at
the time of enrollment into the scholarship
program. The specific provisions of the AR 145-1
read as follows:
"A 2-year scholarship may be terminated at any
time prior to the completion of the first year. The
first year of the scholarship is completed with the
beginning of the first semester or fall quarter of
the second academic year or at the end of 12
months from the beginning of the scholarship. A
4-year scholarship may be terminated at any time
prior to completion of the basic course. The basic
course is completed on the last scheduled day.
The following is the complete text of
President Pitzer's letter to the Steering
Committee of the Academic Council:
On February 13, 1969, the Senate adopted six
of eight recommendations from the Majority
Report of its ad hoc Committee on ROTC, and
referred two other recommendations to a
committee to be established subsequently (See
SenD 110 329). Recommendation Six stated that
"University authorities should promptly initiate
action leading to revision or termination of the
contracts between Stanford and the armed
forces ...
On my instructions, Vice Provost Brooks began
negotiations with the three services for revision of
the contracts to bring ROTC as closely as possible
into conformance with the recommendations of
the Senate. At about the same time, 1 also
appointed a President's Advisory Committee on
ROTC Affairs in general accordance with
Recommendation Six, the faculty members being
recommended by the Senate Committee on
Committees and the student members by the then
ASSU President, Denis Hayes.
On October 22, 1969, the Professor of Military
Science, Colonel Stanley M. Ramey, with the
approval of the Department of the Army,
submitted a proposal for revision of the Army
ROTC contract, pursuant to Mr. Brooks' request.
(See SenD no. 321.) On October 30, I asked the
President's Advisory Committee on ROTC Affairs
for advice on the proposal.
The Committee has spent the past two months
(Minutes are on file in the Academic Secretary's
Office) considering the Army proposal. At the
same time, the Air Force and the Navy have
indicated that they would generally consider the
fate of this proposal as setting a broad precedent
for their own approaches to contract revision. In
other words, if the Army proposal is acceptable to
the University, we can expect the other two
services to use it as a model for similar proposals.
1 now have the Committee's recommendation; a
copy is attached (See SenD no. 332). The
Committee, by a six-to-two vote, has
recommended that I accept the Army proposal for
revision of the ROTC contract with one or two
minor changes, which have been made, and subject
to obtaining the "advice and consent of the Senate
on thyproposal for the granting of academic credit
on a course-by-course basis in accordance with the
procedures and standards of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies."
In accordance with the Committee's
recommendation, I therefore request that the
Steering Committee place this question
prominently on the Agenda of the Senate for its
January 22, 1970 meeting. There is some urgency
since the three services need to know whether or
not they can enroll scholarship students in the
coming Fall term.
I should state that I, personally, find the Army
proposal reasonable and acceptable, and very close
indeed to the recommendations adopted by the
Senate on February 13, 1969. The Army has
offered substantial concessions to the University
and seems to me to have met virtually every
requirement except on the matter of individual
student contracts (see Senate Recommendations
Four and Eight). Legislative remedy seems
necessary, and I agree with the Army's judgment
that the present congressional climate is definitely
not propitious for an effort to secure such remedy.
The question of granting limited academic
credit is the crux of the matter before us. The
propositi submitted by the Army accepts as a
starting position that there will be no blanket
credit for military-taught courses of military
training and education. But the proposal calls for
the review of such courses "in accordance with
normal University procedures and to grant
appropriate academic credit toward graduation for
those courses which meet established University
standards." The President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs has interpreted this to mean that
selected proposals for selected courses would be
submitted to the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which has jurisdiction over
non-departmental undergraduate courses,
specifically Undergraduate Specials, and which has
a regular procedure for reviewing course proposals.
The Army is prepared to accept the Committee's
judgment and let the issue of credit stand or fall
on the Committee's decision on each course
proposal.
In contrast with the present 27 quarter units of
credit for military-taught courses in military
training and education in the Army ROTC
program, the Army proposes to submit to the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies individual
course proposals up to a combined total of six to
nine quarter units.
In regard to other matters included in the
recommendations adopted by the Senate on
February 13, 1969, the Army proposal abolishes
departmental status as well as faculty rank and
Academic Council membership. The program is
removed from the School of Humanities and
Sciences and placed under the Provost's Office,
thus ensuring adequate supervision. A Center lor
Military Studies is substituted for the present
Department of Military Science, and the title
"Director" is accorded the senior officer instead of
"Professor." Other officers would be entitled
Associate or Assistant Directors. The status of the
military officers assigned to the Army ROTC unit
would be the same as that of temporary members
of the University staff, which currently includes
about 1,750 persons in addition to the Faculty.
The perquisites of the University Stal 112 include
listing in the Faculty-Staff Director, library

privileges, reserved parking stickers, eligibility for
consideratiun for Faculty Club membership,
reduced ticket prices for athletic season tickets,
and the like. They may attend regular meetings of
the Academic Council without the privileges of the
floor or of the vote.
This status is that normally conferred upon
professional persons attached temporarily to the
University. A group analogous to the military
officers assigned to ROTC duty at Stanford might
well be the members of the Stanford United
Ministry who perform various campus services
while basically employed by organizations or
institutions other than the University; and from
time to time give undergraduate special courses for
credit. They too could be members of the
University Staff.
It appears to me that this proposal is a
reasonable one. Subject to Senate approval of the
proposed credit mechanism, 1 intend to accept the
Army propositi and put it into effect as rapidly as
possible.
It is a matter of considerable University interest
that a reasonable compromise between the
military services and the academic community by
reached. There are substantial numbers in the
faculty and in the student body who wish to see
ROTC continued in some form, with some degree
of academic credit, in ways that do not do
violence to academic standards. It seems to me
that the Army proposal, which has been carefully
and thoughtfully reviewed by the Advisory
Committee on ROTC Affairs, meets the principal
objections to the existing program and offers a
reasonable prospect for the future. I strongly urge
favorable Senate consideration.
The following are exerpts of the Army's
original ROTC revision plans, which were

the following revisions to the institutional

Officers Training Corps Unit, are offered
(deletions from current provisions are bracketed
and additions are boldface):

—DA Form 597-2-R, Army ROTC Financial
Assistance Contract;
—DA Form 3036-R, Acknowledgement of
Understanding of Service Requirements Army
ROTC Financial Assistance Program; and
— SAH Form 144, Acknowledgement of
Understanding of Service Requirements,
the law, Section 2107, Title 10, United States
Code, as implemented by Army Regulations (AR
145-1), provides the scholarship student with the
opportunity to terminate his scholarship at his
request without penalty at any time during the
first two years of a four year scholarship and the
first year of a two year scholarship.
These provisions insure that a scholarship
student is not irrevocably committed to a military
career as he enters the ROTC scholarship program,
offering him a reasonable period of time to give
further consideration to his decision. The cadet is
informed of the provisions of the regulations at
the time of enrollment into the scholarship
program. The specific provisions of the AR 145-1
read as follows:
"A 2-year scholarship may be terminated at any
time prior to the completion of the first year. The
first year of the scholarship is completed with the
beginning of the first semester or fall quarter of
the second academic year or at the end of 12
months from the beginning of the scholarship. A
4-year scholarship may be terminated at any time
prior to completion of the basic course. The basic
course is completed on the last scheduled day.
The following is the complete text of
President Pitzer's letter to the Steering
Committee of the Academic Council:
On February 13, 1969, the Senate adopted six
of eight recommendations from the Majority
Report of its ad hoc Committee on ROTC, and
referred two other recommendations to a
committee to be established subsequently (See
SenD 110 329). Recommendation Six stated that
"University authorities should promptly initiate
action leading to revision or termination of the
contracts between Stanford and the armed
forces ...
On my instructions, Vice Provost Brooks began
negotiations with the three services for revision of
the contracts to bring ROTC as closely as possible
into conformance with the recommendations of
the Senate. At about the same time, 1 also
appointed a President's Advisory Committee on
ROTC Affairs in general accordance with
Recommendation Six, the faculty members being
recommended by the Senate Committee on
Committees and the student members by the then
ASSU President, Denis Hayes.
On October 22, 1969, the Professor of Military
Science, Colonel Stanley M. Ramey, with the
approval of the Department of the Army,
submitted a proposal for revision of the Army
ROTC contract, pursuant to Mr. Brooks' request.
(See SenD no. 321.) On October 30, I asked the
President's Advisory Committee on ROTC Affairs
for advice on the proposal.
The Committee has spent the past two months
(Minutes are on file in the Academic Secretary's
Office) considering the Army proposal. At the
same time, the Air Force and the Navy have
indicated that they would generally consider the
fate of this proposal as setting a broad precedent
for their own approaches to contract revision. In
other words, if the Army proposal is acceptable to
the University, we can expect the other two
services to use it as a model for similar proposals.
1 now have the Committee's recommendation; a
copy is attached (See SenD no. 332). The
Committee, by a six-to-two vote, has
recommended that I accept the Army proposal for
revision of the ROTC contract with one or two
minor changes, which have been made, and subject
to obtaining the "advice and consent of the Senate
on thyproposal for the granting of academic credit
on a course-by-course basis in accordance with the
procedures and standards of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies."
In accordance with the Committee's
recommendation, I therefore request that the
Steering Committee place this question
prominently on the Agenda of the Senate for its
January 22, 1970 meeting. There is some urgency
since the three services need to know whether or
not they can enroll scholarship students in the
coming Fall term.
I should state that I, personally, find the Army
proposal reasonable and acceptable, and very close
indeed to the recommendations adopted by the
Senate on February 13, 1969. The Army has
offered substantial concessions to the University
and seems to me to have met virtually every
requirement except on the matter of individual
student contracts (see Senate Recommendations
Four and Eight). Legislative remedy seems
necessary, and I agree with the Army's judgment
that the present congressional climate is definitely
not propitious for an effort to secure such remedy.
The question of granting limited academic
credit is the crux of the matter before us. The
propositi submitted by the Army accepts as a
starting position that there will be no blanket
credit for military-taught courses of military
training and education. But the proposal calls for
the review of such courses "in accordance with
normal University procedures and to grant
appropriate academic credit toward graduation for
those courses which meet established University
standards." The President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs has interpreted this to mean that
selected proposals for selected courses would be
submitted to the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which has jurisdiction over
non-departmental undergraduate courses,
specifically Undergraduate Specials, and which has
a regular procedure for reviewing course proposals.
The Army is prepared to accept the Committee's
judgment and let the issue of credit stand or fall
on the Committee's decision on each course
proposal.
In contrast with the present 27 quarter units of
credit for military-taught courses in military
training and education in the Army ROTC
program, the Army proposes to submit to the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies individual
course proposals up to a combined total of six to
nine quarter units.
In regard to other matters included in the
recommendations adopted by the Senate on
February 13, 1969, the Army proposal abolishes
departmental status as well as faculty rank and
Academic Council membership. The program is
removed from the School of Humanities and
Sciences and placed under the Provost's Office,
thus ensuring adequate supervision. A Center lor
Military Studies is substituted for the present
Department of Military Science, and the title
"Director" is accorded the senior officer instead of
"Professor." Other officers would be entitled
Associate or Assistant Directors. The status of the
military officers assigned to the Army ROTC unit
would be the same as that of temporary members
of the University staff, which currently includes
about 1,750 persons in addition to the Faculty.
The perquisites of the University Stal 112 include
listing in the Faculty-Staff Director, library

privileges, reserved parking stickers, eligibility for
consideratiun for Faculty Club membership,
reduced ticket prices for athletic season tickets,
and the like. They may attend regular meetings of
the Academic Council without the privileges of the
floor or of the vote.
This status is that normally conferred upon
professional persons attached temporarily to the
University. A group analogous to the military
officers assigned to ROTC duty at Stanford might
well be the members of the Stanford United
Ministry who perform various campus services
while basically employed by organizations or
institutions other than the University; and from
time to time give undergraduate special courses for
credit. They too could be members of the
University Staff.
It appears to me that this proposal is a
reasonable one. Subject to Senate approval of the
proposed credit mechanism, 1 intend to accept the
Army propositi and put it into effect as rapidly as
possible.
It is a matter of considerable University interest
that a reasonable compromise between the
military services and the academic community by
reached. There are substantial numbers in the
faculty and in the student body who wish to see
ROTC continued in some form, with some degree
of academic credit, in ways that do not do
violence to academic standards. It seems to me
that the Army proposal, which has been carefully
and thoughtfully reviewed by the Advisory
Committee on ROTC Affairs, meets the principal
objections to the existing program and offers a
reasonable prospect for the future. I strongly urge
favorable Senate consideration.
The following are exerpts of the Army's
original ROTC revision plans, which were
submitted to the University administration
in October:
3. The Department of the Army has established
certain essential elements which must characterize
the ROTC and these are the basis for the proposed
revisions and comments in paragraphs 5 and 6.
These essential elements are:
a. Departmental status.
—b. Adequate facilities on campus furnished by
the institution at no expense to the Government.
c. Military Science Department course
offerings listed in the institution's catalogues.
d. Military Science subjects offered during the
academic day, on the same basis as other
institutional course offerings.
—e. Selection, by mutual agreement, of
academic subjects applicable to a military career as
part of the ROTC curriculum.
—112. Senior officer to have status of a
department head and rank of professor.
—g. Subordination to a dean or an
administrative governing official of the institution.
5. In line with the above paragraphs 3 and 4,
the following revisions to the institutional
contract, DA Form 918, Application and
Agreement for Establishment of Army Reserve
Officers Training Corps Unit, are offered
(deletions from current provisions are bracketed
and additions are boldface):
Paragraph 2a. To establish a [Department of
Military Science] Center for Military Studies as an
integral element in the academic and
administrative [department] structure of this
institution and to adopt as a part of its curriculum
(1) a four year course of military instruction;(2) a
two year course of advanced military instruction;
or (3) both of the above [which the Secretary of
the Army will prescribe and conduct.]
Paragraph 2d. [To grant appropriate academic
credit toward graduation for successful completion
of courses offered by the Department of Military
Science. ]
To provide for the review of courses ottered by
The Center for Military Studies in accordance with
normal University procedures and to grant
appropriate academic credit toward graduation for
those courses which meet established University
standards.
7. With respect to requested changes in the
individual contracts so as to conform to actual
practice and the so-called punitive clauses:
—DA Form 597-2-R, Army ROTC Financial
Assistance Contract;
—DA Form 3036-R, Acknowledgement of
Understanding of Service Requirements Army
ROTC Financial Assistance Program; and
— SAH Form 144, Acknowledgement of
Understanding of Service Requirements,
the law, Section 2107, Title 10, United States
Code, as implemented by Army Regulations (AR
145-1), provides the scholarship student with the
opportunity to terminate his scholarship at his
request without penalty at any time during the
first two years of a four year scholarship and the
first year of a two year scholarship.
These provisions insure that a scholarship
student is not irrevocably committed to a military
career as he enters the ROTC scholarship program,
offering him a reasonable period of time to give
further consideration to his decision. The cadet is
informed of the provisions of the regulations at
the time of enrollment into the scholarship
program. The specific provisions of the AR 145-1
read as follows:
"A 2-year scholarship may be terminated at any
time prior to the completion of the first year. The
first year of the scholarship is completed with the
beginning of the first semester or fall quarter of
the second academic year or at the end of 12
months from the beginning of the scholarship. A
4-year scholarship may be terminated at any time
prior to completion of the basic course. The basic
course is completed on the last scheduled day.
