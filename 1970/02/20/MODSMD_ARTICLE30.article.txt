# Hearings Throughout Month
## Judicial Council 'Alive And Well' 
### JULIE FLEECE 
The Stanford Judicial Council
is "alive and well and
functioning," according to its
chairman, Professor Marc A.
Franklin of the Law School.
For the first time this year, the
SJC is in operation and is holding
hearings all through February to
catch up on its huge backlog.
When asked if any cases have
actually been disposed of, Prof.
Franklin said in an interview last
week, "We're in the process of
deciding the first batches of
them."
The late start of the SJC this
year was due to the late selection
of members to the Council,
because a chairman can not be
chosen until the other eight
members have been selected.
Franklin, chosen by President
Pitzer in consultation with the
members of the SJC, was not
asked to take the position until
January.
The four faculty members on
the SJC were named by the
Academic Senate in August or
September. At that time, Franklin
was one of the members.
Very Slow Start
The delay developed in the
course of the student selection
process. The four student
members on the Council were not
chosen until late November or
early December. Then the SJC
could start action to choose a
chairman.
"I guess it was the changeover
from LASSU to the Senate," said
Franklin, that made the students'
selections so late.

This changeover apparently
started a chain of events slowing
down the whole process. The
ASSU Senate, once it got
organized, had to appoint
members to the Student Selection
Committee. It was this committee
which, once filled, selected the
student members of the SJC.
Big Backlog
"Unfortunately as a result of
the delay we've got cases still
pending from last June," Franklin
said. Cases now before the SJC
include thefts from the bookstore,
Honor Code violations, malicious
mischief, and drunken
misbehavior. There are also two
trials from last spring's sit-ins still
pending.
Because of the delay, Franklin's
job is a hard one. "At least at this
point it's about 35 hours a week,"
he sighs. Since the Law School is
on the semester system and he
was chosen just before their spring
semester began, he was relieved of
the one Law School course he was
to teach.
He hopes, however, to teach an
undergraduate course Spring
Quarter, Law 104, "Courts and
the Legal Process." Although
some one has to do the job as SJC
Chairman, he said, "I just would
rather teach."
No Co mm en I on C-15
When asked about the recent
proposal by the Committee of
Fifteen to extend the jurisdiction

of the SJC and to increase its
power, Franklin had no
immediate comment and
indicated the Council is busy
enough right now trying to finish
up the cases they have.
Prof. Franklin did have some

comments on other aspects of the
SJC, however. At present, for
example, the Council is working
on the formulation of rules for a
"formal adversary" kind of
hearing.
The Legislative and Judicial
Charter under which the SJC
operates contains a model for
most of the kinds of violations
mentioned above. Hearings on
such cases are held in a private,
informal setup. In this kind of
hearing, the SJC Chairman plays
the role of the prosecutor,
presenting all the facts he knows,
and then the student presents his
side of the story.
Chairman As Prosecutor
The SJC then votes on the
violation, and the Chairman only
votes if there is a tie. Thus, when
the Charter was drawn up, it was
hoped that in most cases the
chairman would act as prosecutor
only and not as judge.
The Charter does not, however,
provide for a formal adversary
type of hearing. These have come
up in connection with the
disruption proceedings last spring,
where students asked for a formal
trial situation and a lawyer. This
kind of hearing puts the SJC
Chairman in a difficult position,
Franklin explained.
According to the rules in the
Charter, thy chairman must
present the evidence as prosecutor
and then must rule on the
relevance and admissibility of that
evidence as a judge.
Two Roles 'Impossible'
"As soon as it's turned into a
quasi-judicial hearing, the
Chairman's role becomes difficult
if not impossible because he's
trying to play two roles,"
Franklin said.

This is the reason, Franklin
indicated, that the SJC is working
out rules for such proceedings.
They do not now have any such
cases before them, but Franklin
said that the SJC would work
something out if such a case
occurs before they have
formulated the rules.
"I'm not going to play both
prosecutor and judge in that kind
of situation," Franklin declared
Question of Privacy
Another problem Prof.
Franklin noted is that the role of
privacy in these judicial situations
is very important. The question,
he said, is: "How much privacy is
the defendant entitled to?"
The Charter provides that
hearings are private unless the
accused student requests that they
be open. However, Prof. Franklin
mentioned that publicity for the
University to know what the SJC
is doing might by worthwhile.
Prof. Franklin suggested that
abstracts of the SJC decisions
published in the Daily might be a
good idea. The problem here,
Franklin said, is that the more
specifically an instance is
described the more identifiable
the persons involved become and
that is impermissible under the
Charter.
"There are competing interests
on the question of confidentiality
here that perhaps ought to be
explored," Franklin said.
Prof. Franklin also commented
that the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC) and
the SJC arc now functioning, and
the University should become
more aware of what their duties
entail.
