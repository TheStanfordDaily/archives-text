# Icemen Accept NHL Bid
## 
### 
In a warmup for tomorrow's
Big Game at the Oakland
Coliseum-Arena, the Stanford
Hockey club crushed the
University of California at
Belmont Iceland Tuesday night,
8-2.
Tomorrow afternoon's contest
has shaped up as the high point of
the Stanford season. Spectators
will be treated to Stanford's Red
Vest Band, the pom pon dollies
(hot damn!) as well as two hockey
games. The Indians face off
against Cal at 5:30 and the
Oakland Seals Pittsburgh

Penguins game follows at 8 p.m.
Tickets for the contest are
available at all Seals ticket outlets.
There's a discount for students.
In Tuesday's game the Cards
jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the
first period on goals by Pat
Baldwin, Tom Love and Tim
Moyer. Thereafter the Tribe was
threatened only briefly when Cal
closed the gap to 3-2.
But at that point, engineer Bob
Kadlec gave a classic
demonstration of typical hockey
toughness. After suffering a cut
on the face which later required

four stitches, he returned to the
ice to score a three-goal "hat
trick" in the next 12 minutes.
This effort put the game out of
Cal's reach. Paul Tittman and Don
Mitchell, newly elected club
president, added goals in the last
period.
A high point for Stanford in
addition to Kadlec's performance
was the goaltending of George
Meredith. The Engineering grad
student turned in his best game to
date, making 43 saves and losing a
shutout only after breaking a
stick. Another encouraging factor
was the way the scoring was
distributed among all three lines.
