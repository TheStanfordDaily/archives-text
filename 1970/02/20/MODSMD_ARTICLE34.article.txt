# Indians Face Clock In Invitational Meet
## 
### 
With a 6-1 dual meet record
behind them—including wins over
the second and fourth-ranked
college powers —the Stanford
swimming team travels this
weekend to the Far Western
Invitational Swim Meet hosted by
San Francisco State. Although the
meet has little importance for the
Indians as a team, Coach Jim
Gaughran is hoping for NCAA
qualifying performances from
team members who have yet to
meet the standards necessary to
swim in the 1970 championships.
"Our kids have been going hard
all week," said Gaughran, "and
will continue to push hard for the
Conference and Nationals."
Following this weekend's
"non-action" at San Francisco
State, the Indians have two weeks
of work before traveling to
Pullman, Washington for the

Pacific-8 Swimming
Championships. Three of the top
five teams in the nation— USC,
Stanford, and UCLA will be
bidding for the conference title
which was won last year by the
Southern California Trojans.
Three weeks later, the Indians
will challenge powerhouse Indiana
for the collegiate swimming
championship hosted this year in
Salt Lake City by the University
of Utah. Indiana, rated number
one in the nation by Swimming
World, dominates the latest
national rankings and is favored to
repeat its victory last year, when
the NCAA's were held at its own
pool.
During the next two weeks, the
Daily will feature a series of four
articles on the varsity team
members, similar to the diving
feature of Jan. 31.
