# McLain Goes To Showers-- Indefinitely

NEW YORK (AP) - Denny
McLain the Detroit Tigers,
award-winning pitcher, was
suspended indefinitely from
baseball Thursday for what
commissioner Bowie Kuhn called
"involvement in 1967
bookmaking activities and his
associations."
It became the game's most
celebrated case since the Black
Sox Scandal of 1919.
Kuhn announced the
suspension after a near all-day
meeting with the 25-year old
right-hander and said the ban
would be in effect until his office
could complete a review of
McLain's situation.
The commissioner said both he
and McLain had decided that
neither would answer questions.
McLain was accompanied by his
lawyer, William Aiken.
The commissioner's statement
said:
"I had a further conference
today with Denny McLain and his
attorney on the general subject
matter covered by our conference
of last Friday. 1 have decided on
the basis of facts developed at
these conferences that Mr.
McLain's involvement in 1967
bookmaking activities and his
associations at that time leave me
no alternative but to suspend him
from all organized baseball
activities pending the completion
of my review of his situation.
"It should be made clear that
the action taken today is based
substantially on certain
admissions made candidly to me
by Mr. McLain and not on
allegations contained in a recent
magazine article, many of which I
believe will prove to be
unfounded.
"I cannot at this time indicate
when that review might be
completed."
