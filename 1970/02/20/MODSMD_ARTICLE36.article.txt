# At ECAC Meeting
## Yale Seeks Reversal 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
The controversial dispute
between Yale University and
various amateur athletic
organizations, seemingly dormant
since the Elis received a two-year
suspension from the NCAA early
last month, will be revived next
week.
At four o'clock Monday
afternoon the Executive Council
of the Eastern College Athletic
Association will meet at the New
York Athletic Club. Present at the
session will be Yale's Athletic
Director DeLaney Kiphuth and a
Special Advisor to Yale's
President Kingman Brewster,
Alfred Fitt.
The two will be on hand to 1)
answer questions about Yale's
position and 2) ask the Council
that Yale be permitted to take its
case to the 190 members of the
ECAC.
The dispute arose last summer
when Yale permitted a varsity
basketball player, Jack Langer, to
compete in Israel's Maccabiah
games. The games are not
sanctioned by the National

Collegiate Athletic Association,
and Langer was subsequently
declared ineligible by the ECAC, a
regional arm of the NCAA.
When Yale refused to prohibit
Langer from playing, contending
that he had been illegally
suspended and that his religious
freedom was being abridged, the
NCAA handed down its
suspension.
Recenl Developments
Since the suspension was
announced, the following
developments have taken place:
-Yale has prepared a
voluminous position paper and
sent it to the other members of
the ECAC. The profusely
documented mailing asks the
ECAC membership to condemn
the NCAA for its "gross misuse of
power." It also asserts that the
ECAC's punishment of Langer
and Yale is unconstitutional.
-The El is have also charged the
NCAA with using the Maccabiah
games as a focal point of their
long feud with the Amateur
Athletic Union. As evidence, Yale
has distributed copies of a July,
1969 letter from NCAA Executive
Director Walter Byers to the
President of the University of
Pennsylvania, Dr. Gaylord P.
Harnwell. Byers writes that "We

believe this policy (of not
permitting NCAA athletes to
participate in events not
sanctioned by the NCAA) will
persuade the AAU to participate
in the International Basketball
Federation (an NCAA approved
group)."
-The U.S. Olympic Committee
elected a new president Monday,
who pledged to use his influence
to end the NCAA - AAU feud.
Clifford Buck, a retired executive
from Denver, was once AAU
President.
Feud Over?
-Byers said that a solution to
the feud was in sight, pending
approval of a new amateur
basketball board composed of
both NCAA and AAU members
by the 188. NCAA President
Harry Cross told the Daily last
month that the board ought to be
operating "by the end of this
year."
If the ECAC membership
decides to change its ruling on
Langer's eligibility, there is a good
chance that the NCAA will
re-evaluate its position, perhaps
revoking the suspension. As
Kiphuth told the Daily recently,
"Alot of the NCAA probation was
due to the fact that the ECAC had
made the ineligibility ruling."

case to the 190 members of the
ECAC.
The dispute arose last summer
when Yale permitted a varsity
basketball player, Jack Langer, to
compete in Israel's Maccabiah
games. The games are not
sanctioned by the National

Collegiate Athletic Association,
and Langer was subsequently
declared ineligible by the ECAC, a
regional arm of the NCAA.
When Yale refused to prohibit
Langer from playing, contending
that he had been illegally
suspended and that his religious
freedom was being abridged, the
NCAA handed down its
suspension.
Recenl Developments
Since the suspension was
announced, the following
developments have taken place:
-Yale has prepared a
voluminous position paper and
sent it to the other members of
the ECAC. The profusely
documented mailing asks the
ECAC membership to condemn
the NCAA for its "gross misuse of
power." It also asserts that the
ECAC's punishment of Langer
and Yale is unconstitutional.
-The El is have also charged the
NCAA with using the Maccabiah
games as a focal point of their
long feud with the Amateur
Athletic Union. As evidence, Yale
has distributed copies of a July,
1969 letter from NCAA Executive
Director Walter Byers to the
President of the University of
Pennsylvania, Dr. Gaylord P.
Harnwell. Byers writes that "We

believe this policy (of not
permitting NCAA athletes to
participate in events not
sanctioned by the NCAA) will
persuade the AAU to participate
in the International Basketball
Federation (an NCAA approved
group)."
-The U.S. Olympic Committee
elected a new president Monday,
who pledged to use his influence
to end the NCAA - AAU feud.
Clifford Buck, a retired executive
from Denver, was once AAU
President.
Feud Over?
-Byers said that a solution to
the feud was in sight, pending
approval of a new amateur
basketball board composed of
both NCAA and AAU members
by the 188. NCAA President
Harry Cross told the Daily last
month that the board ought to be
operating "by the end of this
year."
If the ECAC membership
decides to change its ruling on
Langer's eligibility, there is a good
chance that the NCAA will
re-evaluate its position, perhaps
revoking the suspension. As
Kiphuth told the Daily recently,
"Alot of the NCAA probation was
due to the fact that the ECAC had
made the ineligibility ruling."
The controversial dispute
between Yale University and
various amateur athletic
organizations, seemingly dormant
since the Elis received a two-year
suspension from the NCAA early
last month, will be revived next
week.
At four o'clock Monday
afternoon the Executive Council
of the Eastern College Athletic
Association will meet at the New
York Athletic Club. Present at the
session will be Yale's Athletic
Director DeLaney Kiphuth and a
Special Advisor to Yale's
President Kingman Brewster,
Alfred Fitt.
The two will be on hand to 1)
answer questions about Yale's
position and 2) ask the Council
that Yale be permitted to take its
case to the 190 members of the
ECAC.
