# Cagers Finish Home Slate

### DON TOLLEFSON 
It is often disastrous to look too far ahead in
the world of sports, but when you're nearing the
end of a basketball season with a 5-15 record, its
tough not to look ahead to next year. Stanford
played the 11th toughest schedule in the nation
this year, according to Professor Gordon Wise of
Wright State University and the Indians have
another tough 26 game schedule tentatively
planned for next season.
Local fans get their last look at the Tribe
tonight and tomorrow night.
The 26 games will include an attractive 14 game
slate at Maples Pavilion. Besides the usual tough
contests against their seven Pac-8 foes, Stanford
will be hosting such intersectional powers as Utah,
Santa Clara, Villanova and Temple.
Non-conference games will also bo played with Ivy
League goes Columbia and Princeton and local
rival USF. The only non-conference road games
scheduled are a pair of early season natches with
every body's favorite opponent, Bringham Young,
and the perennially strong Far West Classic
tournament in Portland.
FOUR HACK
Indian fans can take hope in the fact that only
one starter will be lost, center Bill Palmer, while
such stellar performers as Claude Terry, Dennis
O'Neill, Fred Green, Chuck Moore, Larry
Rosenzweig and Mike Michel will all return. The
nucleus of these fine players plus the addition of
freshman stars Pat Stevnes, Pat Rusco, and John
Stratton gives promise for fine team. But,
unfortunately, many of the players in the Pac-8
who gave the Indians such trouble this year will
also be returning.

Among those stars who will be back are Sid
Wicks and Henry Bibby of UCLA, Dennis Layton
of USC, Stan Love of Oregon, Steve Hawes of
Washington and Ansley Truitt, Jackie Ridgle and
Charlie Johnson from Cal. In fact, four of the best
teams in the Pac-8 will lose virtually no one. None
of the starting five at Cal will graduate, while
Oregon loses only Billy Gaskins, USC loses only
Don Crenshaw, and UCLA loses only John Vallely.
Not Over Yet
But before rapidly-greying coach Howie Dallmar
can start worrying about next year, he has the
unenviable task of finishing out this season. This
weekend Washington State and Washington come
on campus to meet the Tribe. Both teams gave
UCLA a good scare two weeks ago up north before
getting demolished last weekend in Pauley
Pavilion.
Washington was hurt early in the year by
injuries which sidelined starting center Steve
Hawes (6-9). Both are back in action but neither
are listed in the tentative starting lineups released
Monday by the usually reliable Stanford Sports
Information Office.
Injuries have also hit WSU, which lost center
Jack Bergersen for the season. Bergersen has been
replaced by converted forward Jim Meredith who
at 6-7 will be one of the few centers Bill Palmer
can match in height.
Washington State will bring in a 14-6 record for
Friday night's game while Washington is close
behind at 14-7. In preliminary games this
weekend, Stanford's Frosh, 10-2 on the year, will
face Cal Medical Center Friday night and USF
Frosh on Saturday night.
