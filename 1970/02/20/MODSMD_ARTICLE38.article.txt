# Ruggers Whip Gaels
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
The bells of St. Mary's were all
but drowned out Wednesday as
the quiet Moraga valley echoed
with the sounds of crashing
bodies. Stanford's unbeatable
Rugby team was in the process of
pasting the Gaels 32-0.
"They never were in it,"
commented Coach Pete Kmetovic
looking over the states. "It was
21-0 at the half." By the end of
the game, the Indians had rolled
up eight successful tries with
virtually everybody getting into

the act.
Jack Lasater and Kip Oxman
each accounted for two tries, and
Don Bunce, Jerry Dover and Jim
Kauffman each scored once. Bill
Eakland, a prop, who sat out the
early part of the season with a
shoulder injury crossed the goal
line with the other Stanford score.
Chuck Williams, filling in for
Leon Hartvickson who was
nursing a sore toe, was on target
with four conversion attempts for
a total of eight points.
The match was largely a

tune-up for the up coming match
Monday with the University of
British Colombia Thunderbirds
here at Stanford.
The Thunderbirds, though
smaller than the Indians, "are
quick and really know the game,"
according to Kmetovic. The
Thunderbirds have a lot of game
experience behind them because
rugby is a high school sport in
Canada.
Last season the ÜBC team went
7-1-2 on a tour of the eastern
United States and Canada, with
one of the wins coming in a
seven-a-side match with the
Harvard Business School.
Also last year the ÜBC side was
beaten twice by UCLA who
traveled to Canada for the
matches. The Bruins, Stanford
victims this year, host the
Thunderbirds on Saturday.
Monday's match will be played
according to International Rules
which perirtif only two
substitutions throughout the
game, only in injury situations.
Once a player has been removed
from the game, he cannot
return. The Tribe will be healthy
for the match as the only injury
Wednesday was a charlyhorse
incurred by Wade Killefer.
Kmetovic feels that Killefer will
be ready to go Monday as will
regular scrum half, Jim Squeri.
Steward Wilson will probably still
be sidelined with a cracked rib.
