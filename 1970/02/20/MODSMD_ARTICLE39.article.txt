# Nation's Top Gymnasts Face Tribe Tomorrow

### FRED LEESON 
The extra seats are already
installed.
Last week an overflow crowd
packed Encina Pavilion to get a
look at the University of
Washington, second best
gymnastics team in the nation.
Tomorrow night the "first
best"—UC Berkeley—arrives for a
7:30 meet with Stanford and

Washington State, and temporary
seating has been added which
should accommodate everybody.
"IF anyone is going to see just
one meet this year," Indian Coach
Dan Millman claims, "this is it."
The Bears, who edged the
Huskies 160.3 to 157.15 a week
ago, presently seem to have the
inside track on the NCAA title
which they last won in 1968.
Their star that year was Dan
Millman.
This year the Bears, sporting a
string of 24 victories, are led by a
number of excellent performers,
including George Greenfield, who,
according to Millman, has a solid
chance to win the NCAA
all-around title.
But last week he was out-scored
by one of his own teammates,
freshman Minoru Morisaki who
ran up a 53.6 total. Morisaki's
specialty is the high bar on which
he scored a 9.2 against
Washington.
The highlighting individual
duel, however, will feature
another Cal expert, Eric
Courchesne, and Stanford's Steve
Rochell on the rings.
Last year Courchesne finished
ninth in the NCAA finals in that

event; Rochell was eleventh.
Courchesne was first in the Pac-8,
Rochell third.
Courchesne, stricken with polio
during childhood, came to
Berkeley on crutches and there
blossomed into one of the best
rings men in the country. He
scored a 9.35 in an earlier meet
with BYU, and also competes on
the side horse.
Cal's 160 against Washington
was the highest score recorded in
the Pac-8 this season? the team
average has consistently been in
the high 150's. Millman expects
his old school to score 155 or
better Saturday, hitting nine or
close to it in all events.
An added attraction after the
three-way performance will be a
trampoline exhibition put on by
Millman himself, who was
champion of the world six years
ago when trampoline was a
gymnastic event.

Millman.
This year the Bears, sporting a
string of 24 victories, are led by a
number of excellent performers,
including George Greenfield, who,
according to Millman, has a solid
chance to win the NCAA
all-around title.
But last week he was out-scored
by one of his own teammates,
freshman Minoru Morisaki who
ran up a 53.6 total. Morisaki's
specialty is the high bar on which
he scored a 9.2 against
Washington.
The highlighting individual
duel, however, will feature
another Cal expert, Eric
Courchesne, and Stanford's Steve
Rochell on the rings.
Last year Courchesne finished
ninth in the NCAA finals in that

event; Rochell was eleventh.
Courchesne was first in the Pac-8,
Rochell third.
Courchesne, stricken with polio
during childhood, came to
Berkeley on crutches and there
blossomed into one of the best
rings men in the country. He
scored a 9.35 in an earlier meet
with BYU, and also competes on
the side horse.
Cal's 160 against Washington
was the highest score recorded in
the Pac-8 this season? the team
average has consistently been in
the high 150's. Millman expects
his old school to score 155 or
better Saturday, hitting nine or
close to it in all events.
An added attraction after the
three-way performance will be a
trampoline exhibition put on by
Millman himself, who was
champion of the world six years
ago when trampoline was a
gymnastic event.
