# Roots Of Chicago Trial In Society, Law Prof Says
## 
### DAVE BRENNER 
The roots of the Chicago 7
debacle "lie not in Julius
lioffman, or in the court system,
but in the fabric of American
society," stated Law Prof.
Anthony Amsterdam yesterday.
One of seven experts working
on appeals from the contempt
convictions given defense
attorneys, Amsterdam told an
overflow audience at the Stanford
Law School that the Chicago
conspiracy trial symbolizes "a
society at war with itself because
it fears that differences spell
disaster."
Dealing with the question "The
verdict is in— What now?" he
iw.ated that the ultimate issue was
not the guilt of the defendants,
but the blatantly political nature
of the trial. "This is an example of
a national repression of a
sub-culture that is detested," the
attorney said.
Amsterdam noted that a
ivindamental element in the case
Was that Congress originally
enacted the anti-riot bill in 196H

making it illegal to think about
inciting a riot.
Amsterdam described three
levels of concern with the Chicago
situation. The first are the serious
legal issues within the bounds of
traditional fairness which the trial
raised. Second are the changes
that can be wrought without
revolution, and third are those
that will require direct action.
"We do have to live within
society. Revolt should change
society, not serve as an escape
from it or as an escape valve for a
few dissidents," he said.
Trial W as Political
Paul Rupert, a former Stanford
student, speaking after
Amsterdam, urged immediate
action to combat the power of the
federal government. He explained
that the "government sees what it
can get away with politically, not
legally. This trial was political
from the word 'go.'"
The former ROTC cadet
pointed to the treatment of
Bobby Seale as evidence that
members of the legal system were

guilty of inflaming the situation in
Chicago. "Bobby Seale wanted
Charles Garry to defend him,"
Rupert remarked, but Judge
Hoffman refused to allow it. Then
he sentenced Seale to four years
for contempt on only 16 counts.
Kunstler had many more
violations, but he got the same
four years."
Amsterdam also discussed the
role of the judge. First he
explained how Hoffman had done
exactly what the defendants had
hoped he would by being so
openly antagonistic toward the
defense. "The legal system has
executed itself better than the
defendants could have done
themselves," he explained.
Contempt Froin Conflict
. .The contempt charges that
have been levied are the
culmination of the conflict
between the bench and the
defense. It amounted to a funfight
with the lawyers. Now the judge
has cut up the gunfight into
separate shots and he's sentencing
per bullet."

Chicago. "Bobby Seale wanted
Charles Garry to defend him,"
Rupert remarked, but Judge
Hoffman refused to allow it. Then
he sentenced Seale to four years
for contempt on only 16 counts.
Kunstler had many more
violations, but he got the same
four years."
Amsterdam also discussed the
role of the judge. First he
explained how Hoffman had done
exactly what the defendants had
hoped he would by being so
openly antagonistic toward the
defense. "The legal system has
executed itself better than the
defendants could have done
themselves," he explained.
Contempt Froin Conflict
. .The contempt charges that
have been levied are the
culmination of the conflict
between the bench and the
defense. It amounted to a funfight
with the lawyers. Now the judge
has cut up the gunfight into
separate shots and he's sentencing
per bullet."
The roots of the Chicago 7
debacle "lie not in Julius
lioffman, or in the court system,
but in the fabric of American
society," stated Law Prof.
Anthony Amsterdam yesterday.
One of seven experts working
on appeals from the contempt
convictions given defense
attorneys, Amsterdam told an
overflow audience at the Stanford
Law School that the Chicago
conspiracy trial symbolizes "a
society at war with itself because
it fears that differences spell
disaster."
Dealing with the question "The
verdict is in— What now?" he
iw.ated that the ultimate issue was
not the guilt of the defendants,
but the blatantly political nature
of the trial. "This is an example of
a national repression of a
sub-culture that is detested," the
attorney said.
Amsterdam noted that a
ivindamental element in the case
Was that Congress originally
enacted the anti-riot bill in 196H

making it illegal to think about
inciting a riot.
Amsterdam described three
levels of concern with the Chicago
situation. The first are the serious
legal issues within the bounds of
traditional fairness which the trial
raised. Second are the changes
that can be wrought without
revolution, and third are those
that will require direct action.
"We do have to live within
society. Revolt should change
society, not serve as an escape
from it or as an escape valve for a
few dissidents," he said.
Trial W as Political
Paul Rupert, a former Stanford
student, speaking after
Amsterdam, urged immediate
action to combat the power of the
federal government. He explained
that the "government sees what it
can get away with politically, not
legally. This trial was political
from the word 'go.'"
The former ROTC cadet
pointed to the treatment of
Bobby Seale as evidence that
members of the legal system were

guilty of inflaming the situation in
Chicago. "Bobby Seale wanted
Charles Garry to defend him,"
Rupert remarked, but Judge
Hoffman refused to allow it. Then
he sentenced Seale to four years
for contempt on only 16 counts.
