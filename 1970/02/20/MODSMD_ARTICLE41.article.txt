Installation of "experimental" streetlights along Palm Drive began
yesterday in the wake of two rapes in the area. The lights are designed
to increase night-time safety for pedestrians and bicyclists.
Eldridge Bacon Jr., director of the Physical Plant, said that the
installation along the west side of Campus Drive was designed to
determine "the most effective kind of light for the area, and find the
least aesthetically abominable lighting fixture."
The initial installation will be four pairs of lights, both
mercury-vapor and incandescent. Temporary wiring is also being
installed. Lighting paths and parking lots are also being considered,
depending upon the success of the experiment.

A Stanford student yesterday contended that the University
officials have no right to open a student's locker, even though it might
stink.
John Lanthier, 21, a junior in Anthropology, took his appeal to the
State Court of Appeals yesterday. He was arrested Jan. 14, 1969 for
possession of marijuana. He was placed on probation for three years
and was sentenced to 60 days in the Santa Clara County Jail. His
sentence was stayed pending appeal.
James Wolpman, his attorney, argued that Meyer Library personnel
violated Lanthier's Constitutional rights when they searched his locker
and briefcase without obtaining a search warrant.
