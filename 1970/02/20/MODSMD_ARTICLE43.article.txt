# Escondido Expansion
## Federal Loan Sought 
### 
The Board of Trustees decided
last week to authorize the
University administration to apply
for a federal government loan to
expand the Escondido Village
housing complex.
An application for a loan of up
to $3,631,000 will be submitted
to the Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) on or
before April 1. Construction of
one, two and three bedroom
apartments is planned in the
expansion.
The tentative site for the
expansion is the southeast corner
of the Campus Drive - Escondido
Road intersection.
Actual construction of the
project will depend upon the
availability of governmental
(HUD) funds. Edward A. Scoles v

assistant business manager for the
University, said that construction
of the project could begin in
January, 1971, if the loan is
readily approved. He said that
occupance could begin a year
after the construction started.
The University investment in
the addition will be about
$200,000, mostly for furnishings.
Scoles said that the units would
be planned in such a manner as to
make them acceptable to
students, junior faculty, and staff
members.
In its report, released
yesterday, the Trustees stated
that: "The immediate intention is
to relieve the shortage of housing
available to graduate students
which will remain severe even
upon completion of the section of
Escondido Village now under
construction."

Frank Gallagher, director of the
Escondido Village project said
that part of the Escondido
expansion under construction is
expected to be available for
occupance in September.
The complex will consist of 54
two bedroom apartments identical
to those previously constructed,
and two high-rise apartments,
each with 110 units. The 54
low-rise units will be ready first,
and completion of the high-rises is
expected in January, 1 971.
Gallagher said that exact
determination of who will occupy
the new apartments has not yet
been made. He said that such a
decision will have to be made in
the near future to allow for
delivery of the necessary
furniture...
