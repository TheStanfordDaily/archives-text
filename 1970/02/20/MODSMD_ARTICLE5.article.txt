## LA 						Protests '7' Verdict 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
windows of two financial firms
were smashed and at least five
persons were arrested Thursday as
between 500 and 1,000 young
persons protested conviction of
five of the Chicago seven.
The demonstration near the
University of California at Los
Angeles campus began about noon

in front of a bank. It ended some
two hours later after police had
declared the gathering an unlawful
assembly and called a tactical
alert.
Another 400 persons
demonstrated in downtown Los
Angeles, chanting "Free Bobby
Seale" and planting a Viet Cong
flag on the front lawn of the
federal building.
Three persons were arrested
near UCLA and booked for
investigation of battery on law
officers. Two others reportedly
were taken into custody when
they refused police orders to clear
the street.
The demonstration there began
in front of a Bank of America
branch because, said one girl
protester, Bank of America is "the
largest bank and one of the largest
exploiters in the world."
As police followed, the
demonstrators marched several
blocks to busy Wilshire Boulevard
where rocks were hurled through
the windows of a First Western
Bank branch and an office of
Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith, a brokerage firm.
A First Western spokesman said
one employee was cut by flying
glass but was not seriously
injured.
The demonstrators marched
briefly onto the nearby UCLA
campus then returned to the Bank
of America branch where the
crowd dispersed. Police said 53
officers had been called out to
maintain order.
Bank of America immediately
released a statement which said:
"The selection of Bank of

America as a focal point for this
demonstration appears to be
based on the assumption that our
organization benefits
economically from the
continuation of the Vietnam War.
This assumption it totally false."
