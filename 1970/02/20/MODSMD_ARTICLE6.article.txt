# Pitzer Reconsiders
## Architecture May Continue 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Meeting with President Pitzer
yesterday morning, student
representatives from the
Architecture Department were
told that the University would
reconsider its decision to place the
architecture program into the
School of Engineering.
In separate meetings with
Pitzer and Robert Sears, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, the
students were told thai lack of
communications had resulted in a
decision which may not be the
proper solution. Pitzer said, "I
guess we can't move the
architecture program into the

Engineering department if the
students are going to stay in
Humanities and Sciences."
But neither Pitzer nor Sears
would make a definite
commitment to the students.
Pitzer is still concerned as to
whether the spokesmen represent
the views of all the students. Also,
he is not sure what kind of
autonomous architecture program
is feasible with the very limited
budget which is available.
Dean Sears indicated that since
he is being replaced next term by
Professor Albert Hastdorf, the
decision is not really his.
Meanwhile, the students were told
that they would have to plan and
probably finance an independent
department.
In a letter they presented to
Pitzer, the students wrote, "We
challenge the University to allow
us to establish a bona fide
department of environmental
studies to include architecture. We
would propose to strengthen our
present architectural program to
encompass a complete
environmental program, and to
operate this new department on a
scale that maintains the same
degree of personal involvement

that the present architecture
program enjoys.

"This new department could
be operated on a budget of
approximately $50,000 to
$100,000 per year. We have
received assurance from
concerned parties that this
amount could be raised if only the
University would give its approval.
"At a time when repair of our
damaged environment has finally
come to national attention, it is
frightening to think that Stanford
would abandon the field of
education most vital to the
improvement of our physical
environment."
Leon Hartvickson, Ray
Rooker, and Nick Corff, three
students who the
department, have set up a meeting
at noon today with the
architecture faculty in order to
discuss plans for an independent
department. Several possibilities
are being considered, but most
likely choice is some type of
institute of environmental design
with a small permanent staff and a
program similar to that of the
present architecture department.
The undergraduate
division would probably offer
degrees in architecture, urban
planning, and environmental
design. The graduate program
would be appropriate for both
engineering students and
architecture students. As
explained by the present
architecture division chairman,
Victor Thompson, the
environmental design program
"should act as a bridge between
humanities and engineering."
The architecture program at
Stanford is considerably different
from that at any other California
schools. Existing on a marginal
budget of $39,000 a year, the
program has been maintained by
visiting local architects who teach
courses for a nominal fee.
According to Dean Sears, the
cooperation of the architects has
saved the University
approximately $50,000 a year.
The curriculum has been
flexible; it has been changed every
year since 1955. According to
Thompson, this is also an
indication of the instability of the
program. But students are very
happy with it even though they
agree that additional faculty and
stalT wouldn't hurt.
IVrson;ili/ ed I cacli inii
According to the students,
"Only two private universities in
California provide a complete
professional education in
architecture, and Stanford alone
provides this education on a
personalized level."
According to John Worsley, a
Stanford alumni who is now
teaching in the department,
Stanford graduates have done
"amazingly well compared with
other schools in the state." He
cites a recent study which shows

that 80 percent of Stanford's
graduates pas.s the state licensing
examination as opposed to about
10 percent at Berkeley.
He also says that til 12 regional
architects honored in "Sunset"
magazine over the past several
years, three have been Stanford
graduates. "This is quite an
achievement when you consider
the number of graduates from
Stanford," he says.
I - . \ telle ii t Itecord
Finally, he cites the excellent
record of graduates in local
offices, the very large percentage
who become practitioners as
opposed to employees, and the
large participation of Stanford
alumni in community programs.
"They have learned the lesson of
social responsibility," says
Worsley.
One indication of the feeling of
the faculty in the department was
given by Robert Peterson, a local
architect who has been acting as
an assistant to Thompson.
Peterson offered his resignation
earlier in the year because of his
frustration with the difficulty in
developing the department. When
informed of the possibility of an
autonomous department, Peterson
said that he would reconsider his
decision.
Financing is still the major
obstacle to be overcome in
forming the new department.
Thompson believes the cost would
run up to $80,000 each year for
the type of staff now being
considered. Students are
optimistic that the money can be
raised, however.

would make a definite
commitment to the students.
Pitzer is still concerned as to
whether the spokesmen represent
the views of all the students. Also,
he is not sure what kind of
autonomous architecture program
is feasible with the very limited
budget which is available.
Dean Sears indicated that since
he is being replaced next term by
Professor Albert Hastdorf, the
decision is not really his.
Meanwhile, the students were told
that they would have to plan and
probably finance an independent
department.
In a letter they presented to
Pitzer, the students wrote, "We
challenge the University to allow
us to establish a bona fide
department of environmental
studies to include architecture. We
would propose to strengthen our
present architectural program to
encompass a complete
environmental program, and to
operate this new department on a
scale that maintains the same
degree of personal involvement

that the present architecture
program enjoys.

"This new department could
be operated on a budget of
approximately $50,000 to
$100,000 per year. We have
received assurance from
concerned parties that this
amount could be raised if only the
University would give its approval.
"At a time when repair of our
damaged environment has finally
come to national attention, it is
frightening to think that Stanford
would abandon the field of
education most vital to the
improvement of our physical
environment."
Leon Hartvickson, Ray
Rooker, and Nick Corff, three
students who the
department, have set up a meeting
at noon today with the
architecture faculty in order to
discuss plans for an independent
department. Several possibilities
are being considered, but most
likely choice is some type of
institute of environmental design
with a small permanent staff and a
program similar to that of the
present architecture department.
The undergraduate
division would probably offer
degrees in architecture, urban
planning, and environmental
design. The graduate program
would be appropriate for both
engineering students and
architecture students. As
explained by the present
architecture division chairman,
Victor Thompson, the
environmental design program
"should act as a bridge between
humanities and engineering."
The architecture program at
Stanford is considerably different
from that at any other California
schools. Existing on a marginal
budget of $39,000 a year, the
program has been maintained by
visiting local architects who teach
courses for a nominal fee.
According to Dean Sears, the
cooperation of the architects has
saved the University
approximately $50,000 a year.
The curriculum has been
flexible; it has been changed every
year since 1955. According to
Thompson, this is also an
indication of the instability of the
program. But students are very
happy with it even though they
agree that additional faculty and
stalT wouldn't hurt.

According to the students,
"Only two private universities in
California provide a complete
professional education in
architecture, and Stanford alone
provides this education on a
personalized level."
According to John Worsley, a
Stanford alumni who is now
teaching in the department,
Stanford graduates have done
"amazingly well compared with
other schools in the state." He
cites a recent study which shows

that 80 percent of Stanford's
graduates pas.s the state licensing
examination as opposed to about
10 percent at Berkeley.
He also says that til 12 regional
architects honored in "Sunset"
magazine over the past several
years, three have been Stanford
graduates. "This is quite an
achievement when you consider
the number of graduates from
Stanford," he says.
I - . \ telle ii t Itecord
Finally, he cites the excellent
record of graduates in local
offices, the very large percentage
who become practitioners as
opposed to employees, and the
large participation of Stanford
alumni in community programs.
"They have learned the lesson of
social responsibility," says
Worsley.
One indication of the feeling of
the faculty in the department was
given by Robert Peterson, a local
architect who has been acting as
an assistant to Thompson.
Peterson offered his resignation
earlier in the year because of his
frustration with the difficulty in
developing the department. When
informed of the possibility of an
autonomous department, Peterson
said that he would reconsider his
decision.
Financing is still the major
obstacle to be overcome in
forming the new department.
Thompson believes the cost would
run up to $80,000 each year for
the type of staff now being
considered. Students are
optimistic that the money can be
raised, however.
Meeting with President Pitzer
yesterday morning, student
representatives from the
Architecture Department were
told that the University would
reconsider its decision to place the
architecture program into the
School of Engineering.
In separate meetings with
Pitzer and Robert Sears, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, the
students were told thai lack of
communications had resulted in a
decision which may not be the
proper solution. Pitzer said, "I
guess we can't move the
architecture program into the

Engineering department if the
students are going to stay in
Humanities and Sciences."

Leon Hartvickson, Ray
Rooker, and Nick Corff, three
students who the
department, have set up a meeting
at noon today with the
architecture faculty in order to
discuss plans for an independent
department. Several possibilities
are being considered, but most
likely choice is some type of
institute of environmental design
with a small permanent staff and a
program similar to that of the
present architecture department.
The undergraduate
division would probably offer
degrees in architecture, urban
planning, and environmental
design. The graduate program
would be appropriate for both
engineering students and
architecture students. As
explained by the present
architecture division chairman,
Victor Thompson, the
environmental design program
"should act as a bridge between
humanities and engineering."
The architecture program at
Stanford is considerably different
from that at any other California
schools. Existing on a marginal
budget of $39,000 a year, the
program has been maintained by
visiting local architects who teach
courses for a nominal fee.
According to Dean Sears, the
cooperation of the architects has
saved the University
approximately $50,000 a year.
The curriculum has been
flexible; it has been changed every
year since 1955. According to
Thompson, this is also an
indication of the instability of the
program. But students are very
happy with it even though they
agree that additional faculty and
stalT wouldn't hurt.

According to the students,
"Only two private universities in
California provide a complete
professional education in
architecture, and Stanford alone
provides this education on a
personalized level."
According to John Worsley, a
Stanford alumni who is now
teaching in the department,
Stanford graduates have done
"amazingly well compared with
other schools in the state." He
cites a recent study which shows

that 80 percent of Stanford's
graduates pas.s the state licensing
examination as opposed to about
10 percent at Berkeley.
He also says that til 12 regional
architects honored in "Sunset"
magazine over the past several
years, three have been Stanford
graduates. "This is quite an
achievement when you consider
the number of graduates from
Stanford," he says.

Finally, he cites the excellent
record of graduates in local
offices, the very large percentage
who become practitioners as
opposed to employees, and the
large participation of Stanford
alumni in community programs.
"They have learned the lesson of
social responsibility," says
Worsley.
One indication of the feeling of
the faculty in the department was
given by Robert Peterson, a local
architect who has been acting as
an assistant to Thompson.
Peterson offered his resignation
earlier in the year because of his
frustration with the difficulty in
developing the department. When
informed of the possibility of an
autonomous department, Peterson
said that he would reconsider his
decision.
Financing is still the major
obstacle to be overcome in
forming the new department.
Thompson believes the cost would
run up to $80,000 each year for
the type of staff now being
considered. Students are
optimistic that the money can be
raised, however.
Meeting with President Pitzer
yesterday morning, student
representatives from the
Architecture Department were
told that the University would
reconsider its decision to place the
architecture program into the
School of Engineering.
In separate meetings with
Pitzer and Robert Sears, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, the
students were told thai lack of
communications had resulted in a
decision which may not be the
proper solution. Pitzer said, "I
guess we can't move the
architecture program into the

Engineering department if the
students are going to stay in
Humanities and Sciences."
But neither Pitzer nor Sears
would make a definite
commitment to the students.
Pitzer is still concerned as to
whether the spokesmen represent
the views of all the students. Also,
he is not sure what kind of
autonomous architecture program
is feasible with the very limited
budget which is available.
Dean Sears indicated that since
he is being replaced next term by
Professor Albert Hastdorf, the
decision is not really his.
Meanwhile, the students were told
that they would have to plan and
probably finance an independent
department.
In a letter they presented to
Pitzer, the students wrote, "We
