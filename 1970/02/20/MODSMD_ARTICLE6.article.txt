# Pitzer Reconsiders
## Architecture May Continue 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Meeting with President Pitzer
yesterday morning, student
representatives from the
Architecture Department were
told that the University would
reconsider its decision to place the
architecture program into the
School of Engineering.
In separate meetings with
Pitzer and Robert Sears, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, the
students were told thai lack of
communications had resulted in a
decision which may not be the
proper solution. Pitzer said, "I
guess we can't move the
architecture program into the

Engineering department if the
students are going to stay in
Humanities and Sciences."
But neither Pitzer nor Sears
would make a definite
commitment to the students.
Pitzer is still concerned as to
whether the spokesmen represent
the views of all the students. Also,
he is not sure what kind of
autonomous architecture program
is feasible with the very limited
budget which is available.
Dean Sears indicated that since
he is being replaced next term by
Professor Albert Hastdorf, the
decision is not really his.
Meanwhile, the students were told
that they would have to plan and
probably finance an independent
department.
In a letter they presented to
Pitzer, the students wrote, "We
challenge the University to allow
us to establish a bona fide
department of environmental
studies to include architecture. We
would propose to strengthen our
present architectural program to
encompass a complete
environmental program, and to
operate this new department on a
scale that maintains the same
degree of personal involvement

that the present architecture
program enjoys.
Sm all Budget
"This new department could
be operated on a budget of
approximately $50,000 to
$100,000 per year. We have
received assurance from
concerned parties that this
amount could be raised if only the
University would give its approval.
"At a time when repair of our
damaged environment has finally
come to national attention, it is
frightening to think that Stanford
would abandon the field of
education most vital to the
improvement of our physical
environment."
Leon Hartvickson, Ray
Rooker, and Nick Corff, three
students who the
department, have set up a meeting
at noon today with the
architecture faculty in order to
discuss plans for an independent
department. Several possibilities
are being considered, but most
likely choice is some type of
institute of environmental design
with a small permanent staff and a
program similar to that of the
present architecture department.
