# Teamsters Ask Recognition In Controversial Petition
## 
### ED KOHN 
Local 856 of the Teamsters
Union Wednesday filed a petition
with the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) in an effort to gain
representation rights for 150
Physical Plant employees.
If the NLRB accepts
jurisdiction in the case, it will
break a longstanding precedent of
refusing responsibility where an
educational institution is involved.
The Teamsters' petition is
apparently based on their
contention that the University is
not a "strictly academic"
institution because it leases land
to industry at a profit.
Jim Harley, an NLRB
spokesman, said that a decision
will be made "within a week or
so" either to dismiss or to
schedule hearings on the petition.
The petition, which was filed
with the NLRB district office in
San Francisco, see Its
representation rights for all plant
employees except guards and
supervisors. Plant workers include
gardeners, laborers, carpenters,
electricians, plumbers,

steamfitters, sheetmetal workers,
operating engineers and painters.
University officials offered
little comment. Robert M. Nelson,
the University's Director of
Personnel and Employee
Relations, told the Daily last night
that he had not seen a copy of the
petition. "I know it went in (to
the NLRB) Wednesday morning,
but that's as much as I know
about it,"he said.
Nelson said that he expected to
receive official notification from
the NLRB "soon." He said that
the Teamsters circulated a letter,
dated Friday, Feb. 115 stating that
the petition had already been
filed. But, he added, "This was
not the case - it wasn't filed until
Wednesday, and I find this quite
interesting."
The University has steadfastly
refused to deal with all non-local
unions. The last time a national
union took the University to
court was in 1964, when the
International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers (1BEW) tried to
establish a locaiat SLAC.
However, the IBKW dropped its
case before filing an appeal.

The 'lead case' for petitions
involving educational institutions
was developed at Cal Tech "years
ago," according to Jerry Luce, an
NLRB attorney. He said that the
Cal Tech decision has been
challanged several times but
continues to stand. He added,
however, that several schools have
asked the NLRB for permission to
establish locals on their campuses.
Under normal NLRB
procedures, the Board must
decide whether or not to accept
the petition, based on two
factors: sufficient jurisdiction and
a minimum of 30 percent
employee support for the
organizing group. The Teamsters
said two weeks ago that they hold
almost 150 "letters of intent"
from the physical plant workers,
which indicates almost complete
employee support.
If the NLRB does accept
jurisdiction, a hearing date will be
sÂ«<t, probably within tow weeks. If
the San Francisco office refuses to
accept the petition, the Teamsters
can appeal to the main NLRB
office in Washington, D.C.
