## Off The Rhetoric 
### 
Sargeant Brian McDonnell, "law
enforcement official" to some, "pig" to
others, is dead.
The same night a bomb blew up in his
face, 400 marchers tramped down El
Camino Real near Stanford. A police car
cruised ahead directing traffic away from
them.
"Out of my way motherfucker!" yelled
a demonstrator.
"Out of my way motherfucker!"
A KZSU newsman, listening over his
walkie-talkie in the midst of the march,
relayed the news that a San Francisco
Police Station had been bombed. Those
who heard silently glanced at each other
and walked on. Rocks shattered windows,
and the marchers kept shouting.
"Free Huey, Off the pigs!"
"Free Huey, Off the pigs!"
No one knows who set the San
Francisco bomb. We do not insinuate that
radicals were responsible. However,
McDonnell's death carried out the rhetoric
of Monday night, and all the talk cannot be
dismissed as irrelevant.
What matters is the state of mind
invoked by the chants. Under the guise of
different politics, the rhetoric brings to
mind the worst of the "old" American
way. The thought is simplistic, and

simplistic thinking is a cop-out. Stereotypes
allow upper middle class radicals to hate
people and create enemies-to villify the
lower and middle class police. It would not
be going too far to describe this hatred as
elitist bigotry.
We do not want reaction against this
turn in the protest movement to bury our
revulsion at the farce in Chicago and at the
memories it calls to mind-the 1968
Democratic Convention and the war which
protesters opposed there.
However, we fear that the promise of
the protest movement is being lost as
depersonalized hatred ot people
overshadows hatred of what we and the
society will tolerate.
Brian McDonnell, "human being, ,, is
dead. In Vietnam, hundreds more are
dying. More depersonalization and more
hatred, whatever their motive, are not the
answer to our problems. Protesters over the
past five years have given many of us a
conscience and the will to speak it.
We remind this part of the protest
movement of Dave Harris' comments in
1967 on human values. High level values,
he said, "are simple things like love, and
the kind of relationship between human
beings that develop out of love.' 1
