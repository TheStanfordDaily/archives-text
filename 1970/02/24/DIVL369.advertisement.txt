GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ADMINISTRATION
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 7 IRVINE
The Graduate School of Administration (GSA) at Ir
vine offers programs of advanced study leading to the
M.S. or Ph.D. degree in Administration. Through these
programs individuals may prepare for significant roles
in business or industry, in education, and in govern
ment.
The GAS's philosophy of education assumes that:
1) significant problems exist common to business-in
dustrial, educational, ad governmen torganizations,
2) a common set of disciplines, concepts and techniques
exist for the analysis of such problems, and 3) many
future administrators will work in two or more of the
arenas during their careers.
The M.S. program is intended to increase the likeli
hood that future leaders will be able to communicate
effectively and move easily from one kind of organi
zational unit to another, thereby providing society with
versatile managers and administrators. The Ph.D. pro
gram for the field of Administration has the usual aca
demic and research objectives.
Consistent with its orientation to a general and inter
disciplinary perspective of administration, the GSA
seeks students from virtually all academic and pro
fessional disciplines. Different student backgrounds
are considered an asset to the process of education.
If you a senor or graduate student and would like to
discuss our programs in relation to your interests and
plans for the future, we would like to meet you on cam
pus on Friday, Feb. 27, 1970. An appointment can be
made through your campus placement office.
