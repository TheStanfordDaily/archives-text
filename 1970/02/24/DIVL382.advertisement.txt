WHERE
IS
You ought to go to Hawaii, now, while
it's still there.
If your family won't send you just to goof around,
maybe they'll send you for the University of Hawaii
Summer Session.
If you're 77 to 25, Adler University Study Tours will
arrange 6 weeks in Hawaii for you. We handle everything
except registration and classes (although we'll advise
you on those, if you wish) at a moderate price.
Send in the coupon, and we'll send you a free hook,
called "Where is Hawaii". It's a beautiful book.
We think you'll like it, and if after reading it you
want to go, we'll handle the arrangements.
Charter flights by Western Airlines are available for those registering at the
University of Hawaii. Round trip HJS front San Francisco . fHO from [.A.
