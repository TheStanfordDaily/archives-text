# Frats Face Empty Beds, Large Debts
## 
### BOB MICHELET 
With empty beds and low bank
accounts, fraternities are in
financial difficulty, but plans for a
restyled rush and sounder
management may pull the frats
out of trouble.
Collectively, the 24 fraternities
are in debt to the University for
nearly $1 10,000. Gordon
Norman, chairman of the
Inter-fraternity Council (IFC)
said, "There are very few houses
that have no debt at all."
While the capacity of the
whole fraternity system has
increased in recent years with new
buildings, total membership has
not grown accordingly and only a
few of the 24 houses operate with
full memberships.
According to Assistant Dean of
Students Dan Williams, four frats
had memberships of only 30 to 35
when they moved into new
50-man facilities and now are
faced with some serious financial
problems.
The break-even point for most
of the 13 cluster houses was set at
about 45 members.
University Owned
All three clusters—two
four-house complexes by Flo Mo
and Lake Lag, and a five-house
group near Cowell —are owned and
operated by the university.
Many of the fraternities pay
the University with what is left
after paying current expenses, and
most stay about two or three
months behind in payments.
Charges come mainly from
commissary bills and rent.
Both Williams and Alan
Cummings, manager of University
housing, stressed that while a few
frats best exemplify the problems,
they are not the only ones with
difficulties.
Half the construction funds for
the new frats came from federal
loans, scheduled to be repaid in
40 years and outside gifts directed
for new fraternity housing.
Cummings noted that each
cluster fraternity runs up bills to
the University of about
$3500-$4OOO a month, while
non-cluster houses, which are not
owned by the university, owe
about $1500 monthly.
Each cluster house pays close
to $2300 in rent which is divided
about equally between operations
and debt-reduction.

Cummings described his office
as a "resource" to help fraternities
in managing their affairs.
Control Greater
Noting that control is greater
over the cluster fraternities, he
said the University would be
willing to stop registration of
some individuals in order to help
houses collect overdue bills.
He said the University "can be
of great assistance" in consulting
with fraternities and "showing
them good techniques."
Williams stressed that the
University is working hard in
several ways to ease financial
problems.
He added, "if we can better
define the questions that need to
be asked . . . the University will be
in a better position to decide how
to respond to those needs."
Norman noted that the
fraternities are "well on the way
to a much clearer understanding"
of the problems, and that the
university is "willing to work out
a plan."
Cummings said one way the
university can help is by giving
loans to fraternities for house
improvements, current bills, etc.
A few loans have already been
made.
Another temporary solution to
money problems is for fraternities
to take in boarders. There are
about 75 boarders in the system
now, with almost two-thirds of
them in five houses.
Rush Important
The real hope for the troubled
fraternities lies in getting more
members, and this year's rush
carries that responsibility.
Although Williams says no
fraternity will "rise or fall on the
rush," many houses cannot afford
a small rush this spring.
Some frats now have
memberships of under 30
students. With many of those
graduating seniors, at least 20
pledges will be needed to avoid
what one house president termed
"a really sticky situation."
This year's rush, Norman
stressed, will be "trying to
familiarize people with the
changing nature" of Stanford
fraternities.
Williams said the fraternities
"suffer from misconceptions of
the uniqueness" of the houses.

"Nothing is very traditional; the
houses go the entire spectrum of
interests and personalities."
He added "there is a fraternity
experience for every Stanford
student," and that it is important
for the rush program to get this
across to students.
Frat Life Emphasized
Both Williams and Norman
emphasized that the rush program
will try to tell freshmen exactly
what fraternity life is like,
avoiding the sometimes unrealistic
image which is presented at
formal open houses.
Another source of aid to
fraternities is their alumni
organizations. One of the most
successful houses in enlisting
alumni help is Chi Psi.
President Jim Eakin reported
that $850 has recently been
received from local Chi Psi alums

for house improvements. In
addition, the national
organization has just given $1800
to the Stanford chapter,
earmarked strictly for work on
the house.
Eakin said he has worked to
get financial backing from the
national organization to help pay
off debts, too. The national has an
educational trust of $3 million,
and plans are being made for a
$10 million fund drive to benefit
Chi Psi houses in the nation.
The local Chi Psi chapter, as
well as other Stanford frats, has
tried to get support through
activities designed to let alumni
know of current problems. Eakin
said a newsletter is now being
prepared to keep alumni
informed.
IFC Involved
The IFC has also made efforts

to help financially troubled
houses. Norman said that the
fraternities are trying to help each
other by telling them of their own
problems and solutions.
The group has tried to raise
money in the past with events like
the IFC Ball, but Norman pointed
out that this way is no longer
feasible. "The immediate
solution," he claimed, "is wise,
conservative management."
He stressed, however, that
there is not much the IFC "can do
in terms of dollars and cents," and
that a need exists for the
University to "come up with a
rational plan" of repayment.
The problem is complex and
not everything will depend on this
year's rush, but Williams says he's
"confident there are some
answers—l'm not willing to give
up."

FRATERNITIES FADING?— Shrinking memberships are causing financial
headaches for many of the fraternities. Without a good rush to fill \acant beds
and help pay the hills, many of the houses will be in serious trouble.
