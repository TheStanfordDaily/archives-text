# 'Hypocritical Bullshit'
## Reply to Daily Editorial 
### 
In its editorial mourning the
death of "human being" Brian
McDonnell and attacking radicals
for hating the police the Daily
reached a new high in liberal
humanism. Indeed, so poignant
and compelling was this critique
of "elitist, upperclass" radical
"bigotry" that it was promptly
reprinted by the Palo Alto Times.
Let the Daily editors be proud of
their work and let us curse them
for it.
How many times have the
liberal elite in this country and
their aspiring proteges hidden the
pattern of capitalist oppression
and exploitation with the cloak of
humanist phraseology. Violence is
violence, we are told. Yes, the
police sometimes kill too
quickly—but violence against
them makes us just as bad—and
besides attack the police and you
will bring on heavier political
repression.
Have faith we are told. Fight in
the courts. Fight with your vote.
This is a democratic society and
we have the institutions to correct
these problems.

What detestable hypocrites are
the liberals who have shaped this
pious self-serving psuedo-ideology.
How criminally guilty of bad faith
are those who turn their eyes
irom the bloody truth that cries
out around them and propagate
these teachings.
How many times have we heard
the execution of a policeman, the
clearest weapon of fascist
repression, equated with the
murder of a Bobby Hutton or a
Fred Hampton, poor men who
struggled against overwhelming
odds for the liberty of their
people. How many times have we
heard these "liberal humanists"
equate the bloody, indiscriminate
butchering of the Vietnamese
people by the soldiers and
machines of U.S. capitalism with
the selective execution of
oppressors in Hue or in San
Francisco.
Robert Kennedy
But watch carefully: a million
liberal tears flowed when a poor
arab immigrant cut down one of
the architects of American
cou nterinsurgency, Robert

Kennedy. But how many tears
flow from liberal eyes as black
men are slaughtered daily by
fascist police. Follow the
Kennedy's and the McCarthy's we
are told—the good capitalists will
correct the faults of the
thoughtless capitalists.
One day after day for 200 years
the oppression has continued.
Black men are enslaved at home
and imperialsim strangles the
people of the third world. Men are
reduced to animals in filthy prison
cages. Minds dissolve in the white
chaos of asylums. Millions of
helpless babies die through lack of
food and medicine. Thousands of
women watch their minds
disappear down the disposal or
lose their lives on the darning
needles of illegal abortions.
Vacant eyes star hopelessly from
the mud of Appalachia and from
the shadows of moldy nursing
homes. This is capitalism
Cake and Cognac
And while the people suffer
and die, bleeding from police
bullets or wasted from neglect,
the liberals say "violence", set
down their unfinished cognac, and
go off to the Bolshoi. Yes, to the
Bolshoi, or to the theater, or even
perhaps to a college teach-in
where they condemn "the war in
Vietnam" and the Panthers in the
same breath, before going home
to have another piece of cake at
bedtime.
"Off the Rhetoric," the liberal
Daily editors declare—you've
"given us a conscience" and that's
enough. We wanted to believe that
the radical cries of "Free
Huey—Off the Pigs" could be
"dismissed as irrelevant" but a
"human being" is dead and even if
you didn't do it his death "carried
out" your rhetoric. You're "elitist
bigots", they hiss, you think in
simplistic sterotypes that allow
you to hate people and to
"create" enemies and to
"depersonalize" and "villify the
lower and middle class police."
Mayor Daily
What hypocritical bullshit. Did
they really think that somehow
we didn't want Huey freed? Did
they really think we don't mean
death to oppressors? Bastards. It
is not simplistic stereotypes that
have led leftists to hate the police
who murdered Fred Hampton or
their boss Mayor Daily and his
capitalist friends who back them.
Upper-middle class radicals don't
"create" the enemies of the
people but have only slowly and
painfully grown aware of them.
Unlike the poor and the colonized

who suffer directly and injustices
of the capitalist system they come
largely through personal
alienation and intellectual
observation to understand that it
is their own class—their family
and friends —who are responsible
for and profit from the suffering
of others.
And is it so simple to hate? Is
it so simple for radicals to turn
against family and friends when
they realize not only that these
people are responsible for
injustice but that often they too,
even with all their comforts,
suffer the loneliness and
alienation of capitalist
materialism.
Phony and Hollow
The Daily's attempted class
analysis of radical motivations and
actions is phony and hollow.
Radicals understand well enough
intellectually that it is the
economic and social forces
inherent in capitalism that
compel lower and middle class
workers to betray their fellows
and become policemen or
company thugs or Uncle Toms.
But even more, they understand
on a very personal level the
indoctrinated ethos of
competition and class which
compels their parents and friends
to positions of power. It is not
with glee that Radicals seek to
crush the oppressive forces of
capitalism but with profound
sadness. What they have painfully
come to understand is that,
though the cost may sometimes
be bitter, it must be paid for the
immeasurable human gains that
result from the destruction of
capitalism and the liberation of
people everywhere. One may gain
grim satisfaction after killing a
torturer from the knowledge that
many have been spared suffering,
but the constant realization that
such men are created in large
measure by a system which
enslaves them too, inevitably
renders bitter such an execution.
To hold that violence is never
justified in the struggle for
liberation from capitalist
exploitation and to support the
repression of that violence by
capitalist guns and capitalist law is
to be accomplice to the forces of
oppresion. No people in the world
have ever overthrown capitalism
and won their freedom through
non-violent struggle (and that
includes India). Those liberals
who condemn, on principle,
armed self defence by the
Panthers or recent violent
gueerilla attacks against capitalist

institutions and their police are
guilty of direct complicity with
those fordes of oppression.
Different Tactics
Within the community of those
who are actively fighting for
liberation there is and should be
continual dialogue over timing in
the use of different tactics. There
may often be disagreement over
when the smashing of Wells Fargo
windows or the killing of police is
appropriate and necessary but the
ultimate necessity of
revolutionary violence must be
clearly understood.
And there is another thing
which must be remembered
constantly, in these days of
conspiracy phobia: repression
begets violence spontaneously;
long before the forces or
revolution are well organized
people begin to strike back in self
defence.
Agent of Repression
Yes, Brian McDonnell is dead
and he was a human being and a
father to his children as well as a
member of the capitalist's forces
of repression. And we can
speculate as to whether he beat
hippies with a black jack or was a
quiet, retiring man who did his
job out of a sense of civic duty
and spoke out when his fellow
officers slapped the blacks
around. In either case, he directly
contributed on the enforcement
of capitalist law and its inhuman
"order". I am left with that grim
and bitter satisfaction that the
bomb and the death mean that
people are beginning to resist.
That the era of passive acceptance
is passing and the era of
revolution has begun. It will be
necessary to kill many more of
the formulators and agents or
repression before victory can be
ours. No matter how persuasive
we try to be capitalists will never
hand over their power voluntarily,
we must wrench it from them. To
suggest that we back off from the
struggle because it will intensify
and more of us will be cut down is
to be defeatist or to support the
enemy. No, the Revolution is a
long time coming in this country
but it will come. It is our duty to
foster and give form to its coming.
We will no more back off from
this struggle for our liberation
than have the Vietnamese, the
Cubans, the Chinese and other
oppressed people. All power to
the people. Off the Pigs.
Venceremos.

have ever overthrown capitalism
and won their freedom through
non-violent struggle (and that

Different Tactics
Within the community of those
who are actively fighting for
liberation there is and should be
continual dialogue over timing in
the use of different tactics. There
may often be disagreement over
when the smashing of Wells Fargo
windows or the killing of police is
appropriate and necessary but the
ultimate necessity of
revolutionary violence must be
clearly understood.
And there is another thing
which must be remembered
constantly, in these days of
conspiracy phobia: repression
begets violence spontaneously;
long before the forces or
revolution are well organized
people begin to strike back in self
defence.
Agent of Repression
Yes, Brian McDonnell is dead
and he was a human being and a
father to his children as well as a
member of the capitalist's forces
of repression. And we can
speculate as to whether he beat
hippies with a black jack or was a
quiet, retiring man who did his
job out of a sense of civic duty
and spoke out when his fellow
officers slapped the blacks
around. In either case, he directly
contributed on the enforcement
of capitalist law and its inhuman
"order". I am left with that grim
and bitter satisfaction that the
bomb and the death mean that
people are beginning to resist.
That the era of passive acceptance
is passing and the era of
revolution has begun. It will be
necessary to kill many more of
the formulators and agents or
repression before victory can be
ours. No matter how persuasive
we try to be capitalists will never
hand over their power voluntarily,
we must wrench it from them. To
suggest that we back off from the
struggle because it will intensify
and more of us will be cut down is
to be defeatist or to support the
enemy. No, the Revolution is a
long time coming in this country
but it will come. It is our duty to
foster and give form to its coming.
We will no more back off from
this struggle for our liberation
than have the Vietnamese, the
Cubans, the Chinese and other
oppressed people. All power to
the people. Off the Pigs.
Venceremos.

In its editorial mourning the
death of "human being" Brian
McDonnell and attacking radicals
for hating the police the Daily
reached a new high in liberal
humanism. Indeed, so poignant
and compelling was this critique
of "elitist, upperclass" radical
"bigotry" that it was promptly
reprinted by the Palo Alto Times.
Let the Daily editors be proud of
their work and let us curse them
for it.
How many times have the
liberal elite in this country and
their aspiring proteges hidden the
pattern of capitalist oppression
and exploitation with the cloak of
humanist phraseology. Violence is
violence, we are told. Yes, the
police sometimes kill too
quickly—but violence against
them makes us just as bad—and
besides attack the police and you
will bring on heavier political
repression.
Have faith we are told. Fight in
the courts. Fight with your vote.
This is a democratic society and
we have the institutions to correct
these problems.

What detestable hypocrites are
the liberals who have shaped this
pious self-serving psuedo-ideology.
How criminally guilty of bad faith
are those who turn their eyes
irom the bloody truth that cries
out around them and propagate
these teachings.
How many times have we heard
the execution of a policeman, the
clearest weapon of fascist
repression, equated with the
murder of a Bobby Hutton or a
Fred Hampton, poor men who
struggled against overwhelming
odds for the liberty of their
people. How many times have we
heard these "liberal humanists"
equate the bloody, indiscriminate
butchering of the Vietnamese
people by the soldiers and
machines of U.S. capitalism with
the selective execution of
oppressors in Hue or in San
Francisco.
Robert Kennedy
But watch carefully: a million
liberal tears flowed when a poor
arab immigrant cut down one of
the architects of American
cou nterinsurgency, Robert

Kennedy. But how many tears
flow from liberal eyes as black
men are slaughtered daily by
fascist police. Follow the
Kennedy's and the McCarthy's we
are told—the good capitalists will
correct the faults of the
thoughtless capitalists.
One day after day for 200 years
the oppression has continued.
Black men are enslaved at home
and imperialsim strangles the
people of the third world. Men are
reduced to animals in filthy prison
cages. Minds dissolve in the white
chaos of asylums. Millions of
helpless babies die through lack of
food and medicine. Thousands of
women watch their minds
disappear down the disposal or
lose their lives on the darning
needles of illegal abortions.
Vacant eyes star hopelessly from
the mud of Appalachia and from
the shadows of moldy nursing
homes. This is capitalism
Cake and Cognac
And while the people suffer
and die, bleeding from police
bullets or wasted from neglect,
the liberals say "violence", set
down their unfinished cognac, and
go off to the Bolshoi. Yes, to the
Bolshoi, or to the theater, or even
perhaps to a college teach-in
where they condemn "the war in
Vietnam" and the Panthers in the
same breath, before going home
to have another piece of cake at
bedtime.
"Off the Rhetoric," the liberal
Daily editors declare—you've
"given us a conscience" and that's
enough. We wanted to believe that
the radical cries of "Free
Huey—Off the Pigs" could be
"dismissed as irrelevant" but a
"human being" is dead and even if
you didn't do it his death "carried
out" your rhetoric. You're "elitist
bigots", they hiss, you think in
simplistic sterotypes that allow
you to hate people and to
"create" enemies and to
"depersonalize" and "villify the
lower and middle class police."
Mayor Daily
What hypocritical bullshit. Did
they really think that somehow
we didn't want Huey freed? Did
they really think we don't mean
death to oppressors? Bastards. It
is not simplistic stereotypes that
have led leftists to hate the police
who murdered Fred Hampton or
their boss Mayor Daily and his
capitalist friends who back them.
Upper-middle class radicals don't
"create" the enemies of the
people but have only slowly and
painfully grown aware of them.
Unlike the poor and the colonized

who suffer directly and injustices
of the capitalist system they come
largely through personal
alienation and intellectual
observation to understand that it
is their own class—their family
and friends —who are responsible
for and profit from the suffering
of others.
And is it so simple to hate? Is
it so simple for radicals to turn
against family and friends when
they realize not only that these
people are responsible for
injustice but that often they too,
even with all their comforts,
suffer the loneliness and
alienation of capitalist
materialism.
Phony and Hollow
The Daily's attempted class
analysis of radical motivations and
actions is phony and hollow.
Radicals understand well enough
intellectually that it is the
economic and social forces
inherent in capitalism that
compel lower and middle class
workers to betray their fellows
and become policemen or
company thugs or Uncle Toms.
But even more, they understand
on a very personal level the
indoctrinated ethos of
competition and class which
compels their parents and friends
to positions of power. It is not
with glee that Radicals seek to
crush the oppressive forces of
capitalism but with profound
sadness. What they have painfully
come to understand is that,
though the cost may sometimes
be bitter, it must be paid for the
immeasurable human gains that
result from the destruction of
capitalism and the liberation of
people everywhere. One may gain
grim satisfaction after killing a
torturer from the knowledge that
many have been spared suffering,
but the constant realization that
such men are created in large
measure by a system which
enslaves them too, inevitably
renders bitter such an execution.
To hold that violence is never
justified in the struggle for
liberation from capitalist
exploitation and to support the
repression of that violence by
capitalist guns and capitalist law is
to be accomplice to the forces of
oppresion. No people in the world
have ever overthrown capitalism
and won their freedom through
non-violent struggle (and that

simplistic sterotypes that allow
you to hate people and to
"create" enemies and to
"depersonalize" and "villify the
lower and middle class police."
Mayor Daily
What hypocritical bullshit. Did
they really think that somehow
we didn't want Huey freed? Did
they really think we don't mean
death to oppressors? Bastards. It
is not simplistic stereotypes that
have led leftists to hate the police
who murdered Fred Hampton or
their boss Mayor Daily and his
capitalist friends who back them.
Upper-middle class radicals don't
"create" the enemies of the
people but have only slowly and
painfully grown aware of them.
Unlike the poor and the colonized

who suffer directly and injustices
of the capitalist system they come
largely through personal
alienation and intellectual
observation to understand that it
is their own class—their family
and friends —who are responsible
for and profit from the suffering
of others.
And is it so simple to hate? Is
it so simple for radicals to turn
against family and friends when
they realize not only that these
people are responsible for
injustice but that often they too,
even with all their comforts,
suffer the loneliness and
alienation of capitalist
materialism.
Phony and Hollow
The Daily's attempted class
analysis of radical motivations and
actions is phony and hollow.
Radicals understand well enough
intellectually that it is the
economic and social forces
inherent in capitalism that
compel lower and middle class
workers to betray their fellows
and become policemen or
company thugs or Uncle Toms.
But even more, they understand
on a very personal level the
indoctrinated ethos of
competition and class which
compels their parents and friends
to positions of power. It is not
with glee that Radicals seek to
crush the oppressive forces of
capitalism but with profound
sadness. What they have painfully
come to understand is that,
though the cost may sometimes
be bitter, it must be paid for the
immeasurable human gains that
result from the destruction of
capitalism and the liberation of
people everywhere. One may gain
grim satisfaction after killing a
torturer from the knowledge that
many have been spared suffering,
but the constant realization that
such men are created in large
measure by a system which
enslaves them too, inevitably
renders bitter such an execution.
To hold that violence is never
justified in the struggle for
liberation from capitalist
exploitation and to support the
repression of that violence by
capitalist guns and capitalist law is
to be accomplice to the forces of
oppresion. No people in the world
have ever overthrown capitalism
and won their freedom through
non-violent struggle (and that
includes India). Those liberals
who condemn, on principle,
armed self defence by the
Panthers or recent violent
gueerilla attacks against capitalist

institutions and their police are
guilty of direct complicity with
those fordes of oppression.
Different Tactics
Within the community of those
who are actively fighting for
liberation there is and should be
continual dialogue over timing in
the use of different tactics. There
may often be disagreement over
when the smashing of Wells Fargo
windows or the killing of police is
appropriate and necessary but the
ultimate necessity of
revolutionary violence must be
clearly understood.
And there is another thing
which must be remembered
constantly, in these days of
conspiracy phobia: repression
begets violence spontaneously;
long before the forces or
revolution are well organized
people begin to strike back in self
defence.
Agent of Repression
Yes, Brian McDonnell is dead
and he was a human being and a
father to his children as well as a
member of the capitalist's forces
of repression. And we can
speculate as to whether he beat
hippies with a black jack or was a
quiet, retiring man who did his
job out of a sense of civic duty
and spoke out when his fellow
officers slapped the blacks
around. In either case, he directly
contributed on the enforcement
of capitalist law and its inhuman
"order". I am left with that grim
and bitter satisfaction that the
bomb and the death mean that
people are beginning to resist.
That the era of passive acceptance
is passing and the era of
revolution has begun. It will be
necessary to kill many more of
the formulators and agents or
repression before victory can be
ours. No matter how persuasive
we try to be capitalists will never
hand over their power voluntarily,
we must wrench it from them. To
suggest that we back off from the
struggle because it will intensify
and more of us will be cut down is
to be defeatist or to support the
enemy. No, the Revolution is a
long time coming in this country
but it will come. It is our duty to
foster and give form to its coming.
We will no more back off from
this struggle for our liberation
than have the Vietnamese, the
Cubans, the Chinese and other
oppressed people. All power to
the people. Off the Pigs.
Venceremos.

In its editorial mourning the
death of "human being" Brian
McDonnell and attacking radicals
for hating the police the Daily
reached a new high in liberal
humanism. Indeed, so poignant
and compelling was this critique
of "elitist, upperclass" radical
"bigotry" that it was promptly
reprinted by the Palo Alto Times.
Let the Daily editors be proud of
their work and let us curse them
for it.
How many times have the
liberal elite in this country and
their aspiring proteges hidden the
pattern of capitalist oppression
and exploitation with the cloak of
humanist phraseology. Violence is
violence, we are told. Yes, the
police sometimes kill too
quickly—but violence against

repression.

How criminally guilty of bad faith

How many times have we heard
the execution of a policeman, the
clearest weapon of fascist
repression, equated with the
murder of a Bobby Hutton or a
Fred Hampton, poor men who
struggled against overwhelming
odds for the liberty of their
people. How many times have we
heard these "liberal humanists"
equate the bloody, indiscriminate
butchering of the Vietnamese
people by the soldiers and
machines of U.S. capitalism with
the selective execution of
oppressors in Hue or in San
Francisco.
Robert Kennedy
But watch carefully: a million
liberal tears flowed when a poor
arab immigrant cut down one of
the architects of American
cou nterinsurgency, Robert

Kennedy. But how many tears
flow from liberal eyes as black
men are slaughtered daily by
fascist police. Follow the
Kennedy's and the McCarthy's we
are told—the good capitalists will
correct the faults of the
thoughtless capitalists.
One day after day for 200 years
the oppression has continued.
Black men are enslaved at home
and imperialsim strangles the
people of the third world. Men are
reduced to animals in filthy prison
cages. Minds dissolve in the white
chaos of asylums. Millions of
helpless babies die through lack of
food and medicine. Thousands of
women watch their minds
disappear down the disposal or
lose their lives on the darning
needles of illegal abortions.
Vacant eyes star hopelessly from
the mud of Appalachia and from
the shadows of moldy nursing
homes. This is capitalism
Cake and Cognac
And while the people suffer
and die, bleeding from police
bullets or wasted from neglect,
the liberals say "violence", set
down their unfinished cognac, and
go off to the Bolshoi. Yes, to the
Bolshoi, or to the theater, or even

Vietnam" and the Panthers in the

are those who turn their eyes
irom the bloody truth that cries
out around them and propagate
these teachings.
How many times have we heard
the execution of a policeman, the
clearest weapon of fascist
repression, equated with the
murder of a Bobby Hutton or a
Fred Hampton, poor men who
struggled against overwhelming
odds for the liberty of their
people. How many times have we
heard these "liberal humanists"
equate the bloody, indiscriminate
butchering of the Vietnamese
people by the soldiers and
machines of U.S. capitalism with
the selective execution of
oppressors in Hue or in San
Francisco.
Robert Kennedy
But watch carefully: a million
liberal tears flowed when a poor
arab immigrant cut down one of
the architects of American
cou nterinsurgency, Robert

Kennedy. But how many tears
flow from liberal eyes as black
men are slaughtered daily by
fascist police. Follow the
Kennedy's and the McCarthy's we
are told—the good capitalists will
correct the faults of the
thoughtless capitalists.
One day after day for 200 years
the oppression has continued.
Black men are enslaved at home
and imperialsim strangles the
people of the third world. Men are
reduced to animals in filthy prison
cages. Minds dissolve in the white
chaos of asylums. Millions of
helpless babies die through lack of
food and medicine. Thousands of
women watch their minds
disappear down the disposal or
lose their lives on the darning
needles of illegal abortions.
Vacant eyes star hopelessly from
the mud of Appalachia and from
the shadows of moldy nursing
homes. This is capitalism
Cake and Cognac
And while the people suffer
and die, bleeding from police
bullets or wasted from neglect,
the liberals say "violence", set
down their unfinished cognac, and
go off to the Bolshoi. Yes, to the
Bolshoi, or to the theater, or even
perhaps to a college teach-in
where they condemn "the war in
Vietnam" and the Panthers in the
same breath, before going home
to have another piece of cake at
bedtime.
"Off the Rhetoric," the liberal
Daily editors declare—you've
"given us a conscience" and that's
enough. We wanted to believe that
the radical cries of "Free
Huey—Off the Pigs" could be
"dismissed as irrelevant" but a
"human being" is dead and even if
you didn't do it his death "carried
out" your rhetoric. You're "elitist
bigots", they hiss, you think in
simplistic sterotypes that allow
you to hate people and to
"create" enemies and to
"depersonalize" and "villify the
lower and middle class police."
Mayor Daily
What hypocritical bullshit. Did
they really think that somehow
we didn't want Huey freed? Did
they really think we don't mean
death to oppressors? Bastards. It
is not simplistic stereotypes that
have led leftists to hate the police
who murdered Fred Hampton or
their boss Mayor Daily and his
capitalist friends who back them.
Upper-middle class radicals don't
"create" the enemies of the
people but have only slowly and
painfully grown aware of them.
Unlike the poor and the colonized

who suffer directly and injustices
of the capitalist system they come
largely through personal
alienation and intellectual
observation to understand that it
is their own class—their family
and friends —who are responsible
for and profit from the suffering
of others.
And is it so simple to hate? Is
it so simple for radicals to turn
against family and friends when
they realize not only that these
people are responsible for
injustice but that often they too,
even with all their comforts,
suffer the loneliness and
alienation of capitalist
materialism.
Phony and Hollow
The Daily's attempted class
analysis of radical motivations and
actions is phony and hollow.
Radicals understand well enough
intellectually that it is the
economic and social forces
inherent in capitalism that
compel lower and middle class
workers to betray their fellows
and become policemen or
company thugs or Uncle Toms.
But even more, they understand
on a very personal level the
indoctrinated ethos of
competition and class which
compels their parents and friends
to positions of power. It is not
with glee that Radicals seek to
crush the oppressive forces of
capitalism but with profound
sadness. What they have painfully
come to understand is that,
though the cost may sometimes
be bitter, it must be paid for the
immeasurable human gains that
result from the destruction of
capitalism and the liberation of
people everywhere. One may gain
grim satisfaction after killing a
torturer from the knowledge that
many have been spared suffering,
but the constant realization that
such men are created in large
measure by a system which
enslaves them too, inevitably
renders bitter such an execution.
To hold that violence is never
justified in the struggle for
liberation from capitalist
exploitation and to support the
repression of that violence by
capitalist guns and capitalist law is
to be accomplice to the forces of
oppresion. No people in the world
have ever overthrown capitalism
and won their freedom through
non-violent struggle (and that
includes India). Those liberals
who condemn, on principle,
armed self defence by the
Panthers or recent violent
gueerilla attacks against capitalist

institutions and their police are
guilty of direct complicity with
those fordes of oppression.
Different Tactics
Within the community of those
who are actively fighting for
liberation there is and should be
continual dialogue over timing in
the use of different tactics. There
may often be disagreement over
when the smashing of Wells Fargo
windows or the killing of police is
appropriate and necessary but the
ultimate necessity of
revolutionary violence must be
clearly understood.
And there is another thing
which must be remembered
constantly, in these days of
conspiracy phobia: repression
begets violence spontaneously;
long before the forces or
revolution are well organized
people begin to strike back in self
defence.
Agent of Repression
Yes, Brian McDonnell is dead
and he was a human being and a
father to his children as well as a
member of the capitalist's forces
of repression. And we can
speculate as to whether he beat
hippies with a black jack or was a
quiet, retiring man who did his
job out of a sense of civic duty
and spoke out when his fellow
officers slapped the blacks
around. In either case, he directly
contributed on the enforcement
of capitalist law and its inhuman
"order". I am left with that grim
and bitter satisfaction that the
bomb and the death mean that
people are beginning to resist.
That the era of passive acceptance
is passing and the era of
revolution has begun. It will be
necessary to kill many more of
the formulators and agents or
repression before victory can be
ours. No matter how persuasive
we try to be capitalists will never
hand over their power voluntarily,
we must wrench it from them. To
suggest that we back off from the
struggle because it will intensify
and more of us will be cut down is
to be defeatist or to support the
enemy. No, the Revolution is a
long time coming in this country
but it will come. It is our duty to
foster and give form to its coming.
We will no more back off from
this struggle for our liberation
than have the Vietnamese, the
Cubans, the Chinese and other
oppressed people. All power to
the people. Off the Pigs.
Venceremos.

In its editorial mourning the
death of "human being" Brian
McDonnell and attacking radicals
for hating the police the Daily
reached a new high in liberal
humanism. Indeed, so poignant
and compelling was this critique
of "elitist, upperclass" radical
"bigotry" that it was promptly
reprinted by the Palo Alto Times.
Let the Daily editors be proud of
their work and let us curse them
for it.
How many times have the
liberal elite in this country and
their aspiring proteges hidden the
pattern of capitalist oppression
and exploitation with the cloak of
humanist phraseology. Violence is
violence, we are told. Yes, the
police sometimes kill too
quickly—but violence against
them makes us just as bad—and
besides attack the police and you
will bring on heavier political
repression.
Have faith we are told. Fight in
the courts. Fight with your vote.
This is a democratic society and
we have the institutions to correct
these problems.

What detestable hypocrites are
the liberals who have shaped this
pious self-serving psuedo-ideology.
