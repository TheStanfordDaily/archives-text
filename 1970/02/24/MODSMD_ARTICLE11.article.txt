# 'Positive Aspect'
## ROTC Yes, Military No 
### Alan Hitt 
I have followed the recent
debate over ROTC with some
interest, and I feel it is time to
speak out and try to add some
perspective to the situation.
1 graduated from the University
of Kansas in 1967 and was
commissioned as a Second
Lieutenant in the Army through
ROTC. I spent the next two years
working for Uncle Sam, the latter
(November 1968-November 1969)
in Vietnam. I dislike the military;
my hope is for an eventual total
elimination of armed forces
throughout the world.
I abhor our presence in
Vietnam: by far the best thing for
that tragic country would be for
every single American to get as far
away as possible and let the
Vietnamese work out their own
cultural solutions, which 1 suspect
may be painful, but which at least
will be their solutions. In support
of my beliefs, I have, since I
returned from Vietnam,
participated in the Moratorium in
Washington on November 15, in
campus discussions on the war at
the University of Kansas on
December 15, and in the February
14 Moratorium Day activities in
Palo Alto.
Support Stanford ROTC
With this background in mind, I
still support the presence of
ROTC on the Stanford campus
and on any campus, and I believe
that the anti-ROTC activities of
the New Moratorium Committee
are misguided and unwise. To
begin with, it seems to me that
the crux of a liberal education
consists in allowing a person as
many choices of self-expression as
possible. ROTC is one of these
legitimate choices. Remember

that ROTC, unlike the draft, is
purely voluntary at Stanford and
at an increasing number of
universities. (I do deplore the
punitive clause which threatens a
person with a draft if he drops out
of the program in the advanced
stages.) As Mike Wolf has argued
in the Daily, it seems intolerant of
the New Moratorium to try to
impose its minority viewpoint and
restrict Stanford students'
freedom of choice. The approach
more in keeping with traditions of
liberal education would be to
allow ROTC to exist and to try to
persuade students who came to
the campus that joining ROTC is a
bad choice. However, from a
pragmatic point of view, ROTC is
the best choice if one feels that he
will be unable to avoid military
service.
Doomed lo ROTC
This was exactly my position
during my undergrad years: since
I was not strong enough to face
the prospect of jail for refusing to
serve nor convincing enough to
establish a case as conscientious
objector, I felt that 1 was
probably doomed to some sort of
service upon graduation. I also
saw that a college grad stands a
good chance of being abused or
misused if he goes into the
enlisted ranks and that his collcge
education by all rights entitles
him to the kind of responsibility
and position he should occupy as
an officer.
Furthermore, I would argue
that the abolition of ROTC on
college campuses would not
"seriously impair the conduct of
the war in Vietnam and, for that
matter, of any major war" as
Sociologist Joseph W. Scott says

in the Feb. 16, 1970 issue of
Chapparal.
Less Desirable Means
Initially, the Pentagon would
feel a great strain in finding
officers if ROTC were phased out,
but my guess is that the Pentagon
would then devise other, less
desirable, means for filling the
slots. One would be to open up
more service academies, which
would probably fill up rapidly,
since there are always many more
who apply to the present
academies than can get in.
Another method would be to raise
the draft calls and then select
those draftees who scored high on
the battery of entrance diagnostic
tests and order them to attend
Officer's Training School (which
is now a voluntary matter). Even
if these particular methods were
not used, I am convinced the
military would devise methods to
take up the slack caused by the
loss of the ROTC officers.
Civilizing Influence
And I argue, we do not want to
lose the influx of somewhat
liberal-minded college youth into
the Armed Services. In this
connection I agree with the points
Jesse Cederbaum made in his
article in the Daily on Feb. 17,
1970: the ROTC grad in the
service hopefully possesses a
breadth of outlook which can
exert a civilizing influence on the
service I was a civilian on
temporary duty during my two
years in the Army and during this
time I tried to be a gadfly by
getting some of the professional
soldiers I ran into, including my
superior officers, to look at things
differently. I met many ROTC
grads like myself who laughed at
the system and threw a monkev

wrench in it from time to time.
There are also movements afoot
to democratize the service, such as
the Green Machine, and these
movements could use the
sympathy and leadership of
like-minded ROTC grads.
Gung-ho Killers
I do not deny that the
professional soldiers set military
policy and run the show, but
ROTC officers have a definite
civilizing influence which keeps
the Service more honest than it
would if it consisted of nothing
but gung-ho killers (such as might
be the case if we got all our
officers from Service academies).
As I said at the outset, I am for
reducing military strength,
influence, and employment, as
much as possible, but 1 do not
believe we have reached the stage
in the history of the world when
we can lay down all our arms.
Positive Aspect
As long as we must maintain a
military, I favor maintaining
ROTC as one of the most positive
aspects of the system At the
present time, I propose the New
Moratorium Committee re-direct
its efforts towards draft resistance
(which is much more
objectionable than ROTC because
of its involuntary nature and for a
host of other reasons) and
unrelenting pressure on our
leaders to reduce military
spending, oppose the expansion of
the ABM system, and reach a
meaningful agreement at the
SALT talks with the Soviet
Union. If the New Moratorium
would focus on these areas, then I
would be willing to join them.

perspective to the situation.
1 graduated from the University
of Kansas in 1967 and was
commissioned as a Second
Lieutenant in the Army through
ROTC. I spent the next two years
working for Uncle Sam, the latter
(November 1968-November 1969)
in Vietnam. I dislike the military;
my hope is for an eventual total
elimination of armed forces
throughout the world.
I abhor our presence in
Vietnam: by far the best thing for
that tragic country would be for
every single American to get as far
away as possible and let the
Vietnamese work out their own
cultural solutions, which 1 suspect
may be painful, but which at least
will be their solutions. In support
of my beliefs, I have, since I
returned from Vietnam,
participated in the Moratorium in
Washington on November 15, in
campus discussions on the war at
the University of Kansas on
December 15, and in the February
14 Moratorium Day activities in
Palo Alto.
Support Stanford ROTC
With this background in mind, I
still support the presence of
ROTC on the Stanford campus
and on any campus, and I believe
that the anti-ROTC activities of
the New Moratorium Committee
are misguided and unwise. To
begin with, it seems to me that
the crux of a liberal education
consists in allowing a person as
many choices of self-expression as
possible. ROTC is one of these
legitimate choices. Remember

that ROTC, unlike the draft, is
purely voluntary at Stanford and
at an increasing number of
universities. (I do deplore the
punitive clause which threatens a
person with a draft if he drops out
of the program in the advanced
stages.) As Mike Wolf has argued
in the Daily, it seems intolerant of
the New Moratorium to try to
impose its minority viewpoint and
restrict Stanford students'
freedom of choice. The approach
more in keeping with traditions of
liberal education would be to
allow ROTC to exist and to try to
persuade students who came to
the campus that joining ROTC is a
bad choice. However, from a
pragmatic point of view, ROTC is
the best choice if one feels that he
will be unable to avoid military
service.
Doomed lo ROTC
This was exactly my position
during my undergrad years: since
I was not strong enough to face
the prospect of jail for refusing to
serve nor convincing enough to
establish a case as conscientious
objector, I felt that 1 was
probably doomed to some sort of
service upon graduation. I also
saw that a college grad stands a
good chance of being abused or
misused if he goes into the
enlisted ranks and that his collcge
education by all rights entitles
him to the kind of responsibility
and position he should occupy as
an officer.
Furthermore, I would argue
that the abolition of ROTC on
college campuses would not
"seriously impair the conduct of
the war in Vietnam and, for that
matter, of any major war" as
Sociologist Joseph W. Scott says

in the Feb. 16, 1970 issue of
Chapparal.
Less Desirable Means
Initially, the Pentagon would
feel a great strain in finding
officers if ROTC were phased out,
but my guess is that the Pentagon
would then devise other, less
desirable, means for filling the
slots. One would be to open up
more service academies, which
would probably fill up rapidly,
since there are always many more
who apply to the present
academies than can get in.
Another method would be to raise
the draft calls and then select
those draftees who scored high on
the battery of entrance diagnostic
tests and order them to attend
Officer's Training School (which
is now a voluntary matter). Even
if these particular methods were
not used, I am convinced the
military would devise methods to
take up the slack caused by the
loss of the ROTC officers.
Civilizing Influence
And I argue, we do not want to
lose the influx of somewhat
liberal-minded college youth into
the Armed Services. In this
connection I agree with the points
Jesse Cederbaum made in his
article in the Daily on Feb. 17,
1970: the ROTC grad in the
service hopefully possesses a
breadth of outlook which can
exert a civilizing influence on the
service I was a civilian on
temporary duty during my two
years in the Army and during this
time I tried to be a gadfly by
getting some of the professional
soldiers I ran into, including my
superior officers, to look at things
differently. I met many ROTC
grads like myself who laughed at
the system and threw a monkev

wrench in it from time to time.
There are also movements afoot
to democratize the service, such as
the Green Machine, and these
movements could use the
sympathy and leadership of
like-minded ROTC grads.
Gung-ho Killers
I do not deny that the
professional soldiers set military
policy and run the show, but
ROTC officers have a definite
civilizing influence which keeps
the Service more honest than it
would if it consisted of nothing
but gung-ho killers (such as might
be the case if we got all our
officers from Service academies).
As I said at the outset, I am for
reducing military strength,
influence, and employment, as
much as possible, but 1 do not
believe we have reached the stage
in the history of the world when
we can lay down all our arms.
Positive Aspect
As long as we must maintain a
military, I favor maintaining
ROTC as one of the most positive
aspects of the system At the
present time, I propose the New
Moratorium Committee re-direct
its efforts towards draft resistance
(which is much more
objectionable than ROTC because
of its involuntary nature and for a
host of other reasons) and
unrelenting pressure on our
leaders to reduce military
spending, oppose the expansion of
the ABM system, and reach a
meaningful agreement at the
SALT talks with the Soviet
Union. If the New Moratorium
would focus on these areas, then I
would be willing to join them.

ROTC. I spent the next two years
working for Uncle Sam, the latter
(November 1968-November 1969)
in Vietnam. I dislike the military;
my hope is for an eventual total
elimination of armed forces
throughout the world.
I abhor our presence in
Vietnam: by far the best thing for
that tragic country would be for
every single American to get as far
away as possible and let the
Vietnamese work out their own
cultural solutions, which 1 suspect
may be painful, but which at least
will be their solutions. In support
of my beliefs, I have, since I
returned from Vietnam,
participated in the Moratorium in
Washington on November 15, in
campus discussions on the war at
the University of Kansas on
December 15, and in the February
14 Moratorium Day activities in
Palo Alto.
Support Stanford ROTC
With this background in mind, I
still support the presence of
ROTC on the Stanford campus
and on any campus, and I believe
that the anti-ROTC activities of
the New Moratorium Committee
are misguided and unwise. To
begin with, it seems to me that
the crux of a liberal education
consists in allowing a person as
many choices of self-expression as
possible. ROTC is one of these
legitimate choices. Remember

that ROTC, unlike the draft, is
purely voluntary at Stanford and
at an increasing number of
universities. (I do deplore the
punitive clause which threatens a
person with a draft if he drops out
of the program in the advanced
stages.) As Mike Wolf has argued
in the Daily, it seems intolerant of
the New Moratorium to try to
impose its minority viewpoint and
restrict Stanford students'
freedom of choice. The approach
more in keeping with traditions of
liberal education would be to
allow ROTC to exist and to try to
persuade students who came to
the campus that joining ROTC is a
bad choice. However, from a
pragmatic point of view, ROTC is
the best choice if one feels that he
will be unable to avoid military
service.
Doomed lo ROTC
This was exactly my position
during my undergrad years: since
I was not strong enough to face
the prospect of jail for refusing to
serve nor convincing enough to
establish a case as conscientious
objector, I felt that 1 was
probably doomed to some sort of
service upon graduation. I also
saw that a college grad stands a
good chance of being abused or
misused if he goes into the
enlisted ranks and that his collcge
education by all rights entitles
him to the kind of responsibility
and position he should occupy as
an officer.
Furthermore, I would argue
that the abolition of ROTC on
college campuses would not
"seriously impair the conduct of
the war in Vietnam and, for that
matter, of any major war" as
Sociologist Joseph W. Scott says

in the Feb. 16, 1970 issue of
Chapparal.
Less Desirable Means
Initially, the Pentagon would
feel a great strain in finding
officers if ROTC were phased out,
but my guess is that the Pentagon
would then devise other, less
desirable, means for filling the
slots. One would be to open up
more service academies, which
would probably fill up rapidly,
since there are always many more
who apply to the present
academies than can get in.
Another method would be to raise
the draft calls and then select
those draftees who scored high on
the battery of entrance diagnostic
tests and order them to attend
Officer's Training School (which
is now a voluntary matter). Even
if these particular methods were
not used, I am convinced the
military would devise methods to
take up the slack caused by the
loss of the ROTC officers.
Civilizing Influence
And I argue, we do not want to
lose the influx of somewhat
liberal-minded college youth into
the Armed Services. In this
connection I agree with the points
Jesse Cederbaum made in his
article in the Daily on Feb. 17,
1970: the ROTC grad in the
service hopefully possesses a
breadth of outlook which can
exert a civilizing influence on the
service I was a civilian on
temporary duty during my two
years in the Army and during this
time I tried to be a gadfly by
getting some of the professional
soldiers I ran into, including my
superior officers, to look at things
differently. I met many ROTC
grads like myself who laughed at
the system and threw a monkev

wrench in it from time to time.
There are also movements afoot
to democratize the service, such as
the Green Machine, and these
movements could use the
sympathy and leadership of
like-minded ROTC grads.
Gung-ho Killers
I do not deny that the
professional soldiers set military
policy and run the show, but
ROTC officers have a definite
civilizing influence which keeps
the Service more honest than it
would if it consisted of nothing
but gung-ho killers (such as might
be the case if we got all our
officers from Service academies).
As I said at the outset, I am for
reducing military strength,
influence, and employment, as
much as possible, but 1 do not
believe we have reached the stage
in the history of the world when
we can lay down all our arms.
Positive Aspect
As long as we must maintain a
military, I favor maintaining
ROTC as one of the most positive
aspects of the system At the
present time, I propose the New
Moratorium Committee re-direct
its efforts towards draft resistance
(which is much more
objectionable than ROTC because
of its involuntary nature and for a
host of other reasons) and
unrelenting pressure on our
leaders to reduce military
spending, oppose the expansion of
the ABM system, and reach a
meaningful agreement at the
SALT talks with the Soviet
Union. If the New Moratorium
would focus on these areas, then I
would be willing to join them.

student in Hast Asian Studies

I have followed the recent
debate over ROTC with some
interest, and I feel it is time to
speak out and try to add some
perspective to the situation.

of Kansas in 1967 and was
commissioned as a Second
