# Serve Blacks, Chicanos
## Deans Counsel Minority Undergrads 
### DICK BUXTON 
(Editor's note Harold Boyd
and Felix Gutierrez are two new
assistant deans who have been
working at Stanford since last
September. They serve primarily
as "social emotional" counselling
deans in advising Blacks and
Chicanos.)
The tall, smiling man stood up,
shook hands, and then apologized
for having to finish some paper
work. He worked quickly in the
center of his paper-laden desk,
and as he finished he rose, walked
around the desk into the center
area of his bare office, sat down,
and began to speak.
The man was Assistant Dean of
Students, Harold Boyd, and he
was talking about himself.
History
Boyd, 41, gave a brief
chronology of his past education
and work experience. He spoke
most enthusiastically about
previous work in Washington,
D.C., and about his present job at
Stanford.
The administrator was born
and brought up in North Carolia
and was a high school teacher
there lor 12 years after receiving
his M.A. in sociology at N.C.
Central University in Durham.

From teaching he went to
work in Washington, D.C., for the
Office of Economic Opportunity's
"Upward Bound" program.
Upward Bound, Boyd explained,
is a pre-college program for
disadvantaged students to help
prepare them for entrance into
college. Boyd talked favorably of
the program's stress on creating a
positive environment in which
disadvantaged high school
students can prepare for college;
he noted that the program, which
is now under direction of the
Office of Education, is very
successful.
Role of Dean
Asked about his role as Dean,
Boyd said that he is still learning
about Stanford students and the
Dean's office. He sees the
developing role of the Dean's
Office as that of becoming a
liaison between administrators
and students and an auxiliary of
the student population. "A dean
should not have the role of
harassing or removing students
from the university," said Boyd,
"but should counsel and talk with
students. Students want to see
administrators on neutral
grounds," he said adding that
administrators should provide this
opportunity.

Boyd said that students who
see him for counselling are not all
black and that the philosophy of
the Dean's office is to help all
students. But Boyd implied that
an important part of his role is in
counselling blacks. "The
university community has studied
blacks for many years, but doesn't
know them," Boyd commented.
Viva la Revolution
"Viva la revolucion," and
"Afuera de Vietnam" were two of
the posters on the wall;
"Chicanismo" was the newspaper
on the table; and books on
Victorian Prose and Renaissance
poetry were on a shelf. Felix
Gutierrez was the man behind the
desk.
The 27 year old administrator
spoke at length about his past. He
was born and lived 12 years in
East Los Angeles "the main
Chicano barrio (section) of L.A.,
where I learned about the effects
of discrimination on minorities."
His parents were school teachers
and after his father's death he
moved with his mother to South
Pasadena "a world away in
environment from that of East
L.A., where a student is given a
minimal education or drops out."
In South Pasadena "I found out
for the first time what it was to be

Mexican in a predominantly white
world," he said, mentioning jokes
about Mexicans which were
common among his peers and
which he said he had to learn to
laugh at.
Gutierrez graduated from Cal
State L.A. in 1961 after being
editor of the paper, student
president, and a student teacher in
East L.A. Though always directing
himself toward a career in
teaching, Gutierrez was not
satisfied in East L.A. and decided
to continue studying journalism.
He received a master's degree in
journalism from Northwestern in
1967, after which he worked in
the Dean's office at Cal State. He
also worked with the anti-poverty
agency in Los Angeles and had his
own Television show. Gutierrez
was chosen by the Junior
Chamber of Commerce in 1968 an
"Outstanding Young Man of
America."
Chicano Commitment
Gutierrez came to Stanford
because "Stanford seemed to have
a commitment to Chicanos of
providing aid and experience for
these students to become
members of Chicano society." In
addition Gutierrez had a desire to
create a true Chicano environment
which would give anglos and

Chicanos an exposure to each
other's cultures.
As a dean, Gutierrez wants to
"deal with each student from
where he's at" and does not wish
to involve students in his own
activities, some of which he said
were reflected in the posters on
his office walls.
Gutierrez said that he is trying
to make the dean's role more
"student-oriented," and that he is
trying to become more receptive
to students himself in an attempt
to make the University more
personal. He said that students
often do not know about
administration policies on
presenting grievances or proposals;
and he noted that he often
personally helps individuals air
demands at appropriate higher
echelons in the University rather
than doing such a student's work
for him.
There are about 170 Chicanos
at Stanford this year as compared
with 57 last year. Gutierrez hopes
that as the Chicano enrollment
increases, the University will
employ more Chicanos as R.A.'s
and sponsors. It is important, he
feels, for new Chicano students to
have many Chicanos who can help
them, and whom they can talk
with and know.

editor of the paper, student
president, and a student teacher in
East L.A. Though always directing
himself toward a career in
teaching, Gutierrez was not
satisfied in East L.A. and decided
to continue studying journalism.
He received a master's degree in
journalism from Northwestern in
1967, after which he worked in
the Dean's office at Cal State. He
also worked with the anti-poverty
agency in Los Angeles and had his
own Television show. Gutierrez
was chosen by the Junior
Chamber of Commerce in 1968 an
"Outstanding Young Man of
America."
Chicano Commitment
Gutierrez came to Stanford
because "Stanford seemed to have
a commitment to Chicanos of
providing aid and experience for
these students to become
members of Chicano society." In
addition Gutierrez had a desire to
create a true Chicano environment
which would give anglos and

Chicanos an exposure to each
other's cultures.
As a dean, Gutierrez wants to
"deal with each student from
where he's at" and does not wish
to involve students in his own
activities, some of which he said
were reflected in the posters on
his office walls.
Gutierrez said that he is trying
to make the dean's role more
"student-oriented," and that he is
trying to become more receptive
to students himself in an attempt
to make the University more
personal. He said that students
often do not know about
administration policies on
presenting grievances or proposals;
and he noted that he often
personally helps individuals air
demands at appropriate higher
echelons in the University rather
than doing such a student's work
for him.
There are about 170 Chicanos
at Stanford this year as compared
with 57 last year. Gutierrez hopes
that as the Chicano enrollment
increases, the University will
employ more Chicanos as R.A.'s
and sponsors. It is important, he
feels, for new Chicano students to
have many Chicanos who can help
them, and whom they can talk
with and know.
(Editor's note Harold Boyd
and Felix Gutierrez are two new
assistant deans who have been
working at Stanford since last
September. They serve primarily
as "social emotional" counselling
deans in advising Blacks and
Chicanos.)
The tall, smiling man stood up,
shook hands, and then apologized
for having to finish some paper
work. He worked quickly in the
center of his paper-laden desk,
and as he finished he rose, walked
around the desk into the center
area of his bare office, sat down,
and began to speak.
The man was Assistant Dean of
Students, Harold Boyd, and he
was talking about himself.
History
Boyd, 41, gave a brief
chronology of his past education
and work experience. He spoke
most enthusiastically about
previous work in Washington,
D.C., and about his present job at
Stanford.
The administrator was born
and brought up in North Carolia
and was a high school teacher
there lor 12 years after receiving
his M.A. in sociology at N.C.
Central University in Durham.

From teaching he went to
work in Washington, D.C., for the
Office of Economic Opportunity's
"Upward Bound" program.
Upward Bound, Boyd explained,
is a pre-college program for
disadvantaged students to help
prepare them for entrance into
college. Boyd talked favorably of
the program's stress on creating a
positive environment in which
disadvantaged high school
students can prepare for college;
he noted that the program, which
is now under direction of the
Office of Education, is very
successful.
Role of Dean
Asked about his role as Dean,
Boyd said that he is still learning
about Stanford students and the
Dean's office. He sees the
developing role of the Dean's
Office as that of becoming a
liaison between administrators
and students and an auxiliary of
the student population. "A dean
should not have the role of
harassing or removing students
from the university," said Boyd,
"but should counsel and talk with
students. Students want to see
administrators on neutral
grounds," he said adding that
administrators should provide this
opportunity.

Boyd said that students who
see him for counselling are not all
black and that the philosophy of
the Dean's office is to help all
students. But Boyd implied that
an important part of his role is in
counselling blacks. "The
university community has studied
blacks for many years, but doesn't
know them," Boyd commented.
Viva la Revolution
"Viva la revolucion," and
"Afuera de Vietnam" were two of
the posters on the wall;
"Chicanismo" was the newspaper
on the table; and books on
Victorian Prose and Renaissance
poetry were on a shelf. Felix
Gutierrez was the man behind the
desk.
The 27 year old administrator
spoke at length about his past. He
was born and lived 12 years in
East Los Angeles "the main
Chicano barrio (section) of L.A.,
where I learned about the effects
of discrimination on minorities."
His parents were school teachers
and after his father's death he
moved with his mother to South
Pasadena "a world away in
environment from that of East
L.A., where a student is given a
minimal education or drops out."
In South Pasadena "I found out
for the first time what it was to be

Mexican in a predominantly white
world," he said, mentioning jokes
about Mexicans which were
common among his peers and
which he said he had to learn to
laugh at.

Role of Dean
Asked about his role as Dean,
Boyd said that he is still learning
about Stanford students and the
Dean's office. He sees the
developing role of the Dean's
Office as that of becoming a
liaison between administrators
and students and an auxiliary of
the student population. "A dean
should not have the role of
harassing or removing students
from the university," said Boyd,
"but should counsel and talk with
students. Students want to see
administrators on neutral
grounds," he said adding that
administrators should provide this
opportunity.

Boyd said that students who
see him for counselling are not all
black and that the philosophy of
the Dean's office is to help all
students. But Boyd implied that
an important part of his role is in
counselling blacks. "The
university community has studied
blacks for many years, but doesn't
know them," Boyd commented.
Viva la Revolution
"Viva la revolucion," and
"Afuera de Vietnam" were two of
the posters on the wall;
"Chicanismo" was the newspaper
on the table; and books on
Victorian Prose and Renaissance
poetry were on a shelf. Felix
Gutierrez was the man behind the
desk.
The 27 year old administrator
spoke at length about his past. He
was born and lived 12 years in
East Los Angeles "the main
Chicano barrio (section) of L.A.,
where I learned about the effects
of discrimination on minorities."
His parents were school teachers
and after his father's death he
moved with his mother to South
Pasadena "a world away in
environment from that of East
L.A., where a student is given a
minimal education or drops out."
In South Pasadena "I found out
for the first time what it was to be

Mexican in a predominantly white
world," he said, mentioning jokes
about Mexicans which were
common among his peers and
which he said he had to learn to
laugh at.
Gutierrez graduated from Cal
State L.A. in 1961 after being
editor of the paper, student
president, and a student teacher in
East L.A. Though always directing
himself toward a career in
teaching, Gutierrez was not
satisfied in East L.A. and decided
to continue studying journalism.
He received a master's degree in
journalism from Northwestern in
1967, after which he worked in
the Dean's office at Cal State. He
also worked with the anti-poverty
agency in Los Angeles and had his
own Television show. Gutierrez
was chosen by the Junior
Chamber of Commerce in 1968 an
"Outstanding Young Man of
America."
Chicano Commitment
Gutierrez came to Stanford
because "Stanford seemed to have
a commitment to Chicanos of
providing aid and experience for
these students to become
members of Chicano society." In
addition Gutierrez had a desire to
create a true Chicano environment
which would give anglos and

Chicanos an exposure to each
other's cultures.
As a dean, Gutierrez wants to
"deal with each student from
where he's at" and does not wish
to involve students in his own
activities, some of which he said
were reflected in the posters on
his office walls.
Gutierrez said that he is trying
to make the dean's role more
"student-oriented," and that he is
trying to become more receptive
to students himself in an attempt
to make the University more
personal. He said that students
often do not know about
administration policies on
presenting grievances or proposals;
and he noted that he often
personally helps individuals air
demands at appropriate higher
echelons in the University rather
than doing such a student's work
for him.
There are about 170 Chicanos
at Stanford this year as compared
with 57 last year. Gutierrez hopes
that as the Chicano enrollment
increases, the University will
employ more Chicanos as R.A.'s
and sponsors. It is important, he
feels, for new Chicano students to
have many Chicanos who can help
them, and whom they can talk
with and know.
(Editor's note Harold Boyd
and Felix Gutierrez are two new
assistant deans who have been
working at Stanford since last
September. They serve primarily
as "social emotional" counselling
deans in advising Blacks and
Chicanos.)
The tall, smiling man stood up,
shook hands, and then apologized
for having to finish some paper
work. He worked quickly in the
center of his paper-laden desk,
and as he finished he rose, walked
around the desk into the center
area of his bare office, sat down,
and began to speak.
The man was Assistant Dean of
Students, Harold Boyd, and he
was talking about himself.
History
Boyd, 41, gave a brief
chronology of his past education
and work experience. He spoke
most enthusiastically about
previous work in Washington,
D.C., and about his present job at
Stanford.
The administrator was born
and brought up in North Carolia
and was a high school teacher
there lor 12 years after receiving
his M.A. in sociology at N.C.
Central University in Durham.

From teaching he went to
work in Washington, D.C., for the
Office of Economic Opportunity's
"Upward Bound" program.
Upward Bound, Boyd explained,
is a pre-college program for
disadvantaged students to help
prepare them for entrance into
college. Boyd talked favorably of
the program's stress on creating a
positive environment in which
disadvantaged high school
students can prepare for college;
he noted that the program, which
is now under direction of the
Office of Education, is very
successful.
