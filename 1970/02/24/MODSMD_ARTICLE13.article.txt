# Astrologer Eases Modern Tensions
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
"I'm a gregarious Aquarius."
Judging from his two secretaries,
Miss Gemini and Miss Capricorn,
Carroll Righter, one of the
nation's leading astrologers is
gregarious indeed.
Syndicated in over 300
newspapers and author of several
jjooks on astrology, Righter
attributed the great resurgence of
interest in astrology to the fact
that with life moving as fast as it
is today, people have many
questions. "There is a great
interest in astrology today
because people want to know how
to live their lives with the fewest
difficulties, and astrology is a
profession which enables them to
do that," he said in a Daily
interview.
How does one become an
astrologer? "Well, Mr. Taurus," as
I was hereafter to be known as, "I
was originally a lawyer, and

approached astrology with a good
deal of skepticism, but then
discovered that it actually
worked.
"I studied for 15 years and
now just be knowing that you're a
Taurus I can tell you that you're
conservative, concerned with
money, and that you have a very
relaxed sense about you. It takes
sticking you with a pin to get you
to do something. You can see it in
all the Tauruses, Gary Cooper,
Jimmy Stewart, and Perry
Como." Somehow I had never
thought of myself as having a lot
in common with Perry Como.
Righter continued to explain
astrology as a profession when
suddenly an ashtray landed on my
lap.
Nervous Geminis
"That was Miss Gemini,"
explained Righter, "Geminis are
very vivacious, nervous, and
always running here and there. We

say that they have ants in their
pants."
As soon as Righter said this,
Miss Gemini dropped the two
matchbooks she had been
fidgeting with on the floor and
threw a cigarette which hit me in
the forehead. She certainly
seemed nervous. As for ants in
their pants, I explained that I
didn't know any Geminis that
well.
At this point, two freaks for
the Daily Californian at Berkeley,
"Miss Aquarius" and "Mr. Pisces,"
arrived. Meanwhile Miss Gemini
was on her third cigarette, in
between puffs, chewing on her
necklace.
Righter began once again by
claiming to the Berkeley people
that just by knowing their
birthdays, he could tell what kind
of people they were. Miss
Aquarius became very concerned.
Though she had the same birthday
as Ronald Reagan she couldn't
believe she had a lot in common
with him. For that matter, I was a
little perturbed myself, as I have
the same birthday as Richard J.
Daley.
"It merely means that you
have the same character traits,"
explained Righter. "If you're
birthday's the same as Reagan's,
being an Aquarius, this merely
means that you both have great
determination, or in the case of
Daley, a Taurus, great
stubbornness."
Can't Predict Karthquakes
At this point, we were hit with
another barrage of Marlboros. One
struck me on the right shoulder,
"Mr. Pisces," seated next to me,
took a direct hit in the chest. Miss
Gemini dropped two more
matchbooks.
Righter draws a careful
distinction between astrology, his
only concern, and other occult
arts. Astrology, according to
Righter, deals only with general
tendencies determined by the

position of the stars. This has
nothing to do with the psychic
mystics, he explains, who predict
events. Thus I was unable to get a
scoop on the next earthquake.
However, Righter does see this
year as centering on finance with
tendencies for a great many
romances this summer.
Richter sees the present age of
Aquarius, which began in 1904, as
a time of rapid change. "There has
been more change in the past 50
years, since this age began, than
probably in the preceding 2,000
years."
Concerning the present time,
Righter claims that because it is
governed by Uranus, the planet of
lightening, there is a great
emphasis on speed and busy ness.
Age of Individuality
As opposed to the preceding
age of Pisces, which Righter
characterizes as an age of "tears
and sorrows" dominated by
Christ, Righter views the age of
Aquarius as an age of
"individuality, where everyone is
doing their own thing, as
exemplified by the blacks and the
new nations."
The age of Pisces was an age of
religion," he continues, "whereas
the age of Aquarius is an age of
spirituality, where the emphasis is
on what's within rather than
what's without."
Miss Gemini had meanwhile
run the matchbook count on the
couch up to eight. "We always
keep a Gemini around for
amusement," Righter adds. "It's
interesting to see the way people
react, like last night the looks on
the waiters' faces when we put the
salt and pepper shakers into the
water glasses. They couldn't
believe it."
Neither could I, as another
cigarette came flying toward our
couch. Righter says that his agent,
Warren, wouldn't have lunch with
him for two years because of an
incident involving everyone

throwing sugar at each other at a
restaurant one time.
Soothing Records
Righter is in San Francisco on
a promotional tour for a new
twelve record set to be released.
The set contains an album for
every sign with the songs best
suited for persons in each sign.
Miss Capricorn ("scrappy
Capricorns" are noted for their
"organizational ability") gave us
each a record corresponding to
our signs.
Righter explained that the
tunes on each album were
intended "to sooth a person in
that sign if he gets out of sorts."
Miss Capricorn, exhibiting her
inborn organizational ability,
informed us that they had to be at
KFOG in ten minutes. In a fond
farewell, Righter threw three
more cigarettes at us and dropped
a matchbook down Miss Gemini's
back.
