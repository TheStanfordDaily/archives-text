# Student Leaders Discuss Education
## 
### 
Legislators everywhere are
paying more attention to student
opinion, and California is no
exception. On February 12-13,
the n?wly created Student
Advisory Council to the Joint
Legislative Committee on Higher
Education held its organizational
meeting in Sacramento.
The two top-priority issues for
discussion were the Educational
Opportunities Program and public
aid to private education. Also high
on the agenda were the topics of
curriculum reform and the
imposition of tuition at
state-supported schools. The
subject were slated for further
discussion at future meetings.
The students met with various
members of the legislative
committee they will be advising.
William Campbell, as
assemblyman from Hacienda
Heights, and chairman of the
committee, formally welcomed
them in his office at the state
capitol. He said his committee had
thought it necessary to maintain
closer contact with students
representing a cross-section of
California's labyrinth of
educational systems.
The students also met with
John Va sconcellos, an
assemblyman from San Jose, who
is on the committee. Vasconcellos
said he hoped the students would
help work our original solutions
to the complex problems of
higher education.

The students also talked with
Bob Monagan, the speaker of the
assembly, and he expressed the
desire to understand more fully
student viewpoints and to have
students understand the

constraints the legislature must
work with in dealing with
education.
The council is composed of 15
students from four segments of
the educational spectrum. There
are four students from the
University of California campuses,
four students from the state
colleges, four students from
community colleges (West Valley,
San Diego Mesa, Santa Rosa, and
Victor Valley), and three students
from private schools (Stanford,
Santa Clara, and Claremont).
The, next meeting of the
council will take place on March
2-3 in Sacramento, at which time
the Educational Opportunities
Programs will be dealt with at
length. The council will meet on a
monthly basis.
Interim Chairman
Roy Stafford from San Diego
Mesa Community College was
elected interim chairman of the
group.
Junior Pierce McNally
represents Stanford. He has spent
six months working for The
Governor's Commission on
Education in Wisconsin. The
commission was a
citizen-volunteer organization
charged with evaluating
Wisconsin's educational systems
from pre-elementary to
post-graduate.
McNally's job was to visit
campuses throughout the state to
compile dominant trends in
student thinking on educational
reforms through interviews,
conferences, and questionnaires.
He completed a 125-page report
which is being incorporated into
the final report of the Governor's
Commission, to be submitted to
the Governor on March 2.
