# Regents Enact Cal Tuition

### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Gov.
Ronald Reagan has won his
throe-year battle to increase
university of California student
fees.
The victory came late Friday
when 16 of the 23 regents voted
for the controversial issue after
four hours of discussion in the
end of a two-day meeting. Fifty
anti-tuition pickets marched
outside the UC Extension Center.
The present $300 student fees
will increase next year to $450 for
undergraduates and $480 for
graduate students.
Bill James, student body
president at the Santa Barbara
campus, said the new figures are
"back-breaking prices."
Regent Philip L. Boyd, who
proposed the plan, called it an
"educational fee," but regent
Frederick G. Dutton, a leading
opponent, said it is a matter of
semantics and really means

tuition.
The regents' decisions mean
that:
—Next year, undergraduate
students pay $150 for the
three-quarter year and graduate
students pay $480.
— The following year,
undergraduates pay $600 and
graduates pay $660.
—The increased revenue will be
used as regents see fit. The current
$300 fee goes for extracurricular
items such as athletics and student
government.
—Out-of-state students, who
now pay about $1,200 a year, also
will pay the additional amounts.
—Residents who can show
financial need may voluntarily
defer payments until after
graduation.
—University President Charles
J. Hitch is ordered to report on
possible increases in student aid
"from whatever sources."

—Pharmaceutical, medical and
dental students are excluded from
the fee increases until regents hear
additional reports from the
admin ist ration.
Before the vote, opposition
came from several student leaders
who presented petitions bearing
thousands of signatures.
The increase means about $16
million in revenue next year,
according to university
spokesmen. Reagan's proposed
$333 million university budget for
next year is described by Hitch as
"austere" and not providing for
growth.
Besides Governor Reagan, 15
of the University Regents voted
Friday in favor of tuition,
including W. Glenn Campbell,
director of Stanford's Hoover
Institution.
Six regents voted no, including
"prsity President Charles »?.
