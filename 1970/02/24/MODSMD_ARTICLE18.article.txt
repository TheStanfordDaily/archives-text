# Committees Issue Progress Reports
## 
### 
Students serving on Trustee,
Academic Council and
Presidential Committees gave
progress reports Thursday
afternoon.
The 17 reports explained
committee concerns and present
and future actions of the
committees.
Students on the Trustee
Committee on Finance and on the
Committee on Planning and
Development cited the present
financial crisis and proposals for
its alleviation as their major
concerns. An attempt will he
made during thy next five years to
raise $300-500 million to cover
proposals for spending during the
next ten years.
The Building and Grounds
Committee has proposed over
$135 million in expenditures
during the next ten years. Other
Trustee Committees will use funds
to meet increased enrollment and
to improve the quality of
education in certain departments.
Stanford University Now (SUN), a
student fund raising campaign, is
working to help the University
meet these commitments.
Early Decisions
The decision to permit
industrialization of Coyote Hill
was made 15 years ago, according
to Gail Achterman of the Land
Development Committee. She
stressed the importance of long
range planning in such areas as
housing priorities and the
development of open space and
recreation areas.
The Academic Council
Committees that issued reports

were the Committee on Awards,
Prizes and Honors, the Committee
on Foreign Studies Programs, the
Committee on Research—which
will have an open meeting March
12 at 7:30 p.m. in the Physics
Tank—and the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies.
The Presidential Committees
which reported included the
Committee on Faculty-Staff
Affairs, the Committee on the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
and the Committee on Land and
Building Development. The latter
hopes to investigate current
development plans and increase
public awareness of future plans.
Other Presidential Committees
included the Committee on
Services to Students, the
Committee on Student-Faculty
Employment, the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid, the Committee on
the Faculty Senate and the
University Advisory Committee.
Denise Wilson, a member of
the Student-Faculty Employment
Committee, said tha students
should be aware that her
committee must approve the
petitions of all people who wish
to sell things on campus. Door to
door soliciting is prohibited.
As students are new to most of
the committees, the reports
included little more than
summary information. John
Grube, a member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents and
moderator of Thursday's meeting,
announced that more informative
committee reports would be given
next quarter.
