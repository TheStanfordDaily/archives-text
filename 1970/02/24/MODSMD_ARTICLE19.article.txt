# Reconsidering, But No Change
## Students Protest BYU Policies 
### 
APâ€”lncreasingly violent
protest against Mormon racial
policy apparently has done little
to jar relationships between the
church's Brigham Young
University and other western
schools.
The picture which emerges
from an Associated Press survey is
that a controversial Mormon ban
on Negro lay priests remains
largely an issue pressed by the
young and the black. Campus
officialdom, while concerned
about demonstrations during visits
by BYU athletic teams, does not
profess to be moved toward
policy change. Administrators say
ties with the Provo, Utah, school
are not under reconsideration.
There are scattered exceptions.
At (he universities of New
Mexico and Washington, relation?
with BYU are described as under
"evaluation."
But neither school gives any
visible indication of being ready
to follow the lead of Stanford,
which last November severed all
ties with Brigham Young.
Earlier, BYU and San Jose
State agreed not to meet in
football after the 1969 season.
San Jose players have worn
protest armbands during BYU
games.
The central issue is that the
Church of Jesus Christ of
Latterday Saints (Mormon) does
not allow Negroes of African
lineage to hold the priesthood.
Blacks protest the policy as
racist. Mormons defend it on
ground of religious freedom.

Last December, church
officials reaffirmed the policy but
said the church believes Negroes
should be granted full rights of
citizenship.
Demonstrations, often keyed
by black campus groups, began
about two years ago with
relatively peaceful wearing of
armbands. By this Winter, real
violence erupted.
Protests
Garbage-throwing
demonstrators broke up a
wrestling match in Colorado, a
gymnastics meet in Washington.
Protests boiled to mini-riot stages
during basketball games at
Arizona and Colorado State
universities. Each time, the
occasion was a visit by a BYU
squad.
Arizona, scene of one of the
harshest confrontations, is among
western schools reporting no
official change in relations with
BYU.
"If I had seen discrimination,"
says U-of-A President Richard A.
Harvill, "I would have been in a
position to do something about
it . .
At the University of Wyoming,
officials say no re-evaluation is in

progress. Some appeared to resent
the suggestion. It was at Wyoming
where 14 blacks were kicked off
(he football team for wearing
armbands in a BYU protest.
UCLA, California - Berkeley,
Southern California, Oregon
State, Idaho and Arizona State
also report no plans for change.
University of Washington
Athletic Director Joe Kearney
announced his school's plans to
reevaluate n ties with BYU
following violence at a gymnastic
meet involving the Mormon
school.
But Kerney said "any action
taken regarding the scheduling of
BYU will be done in spite of, and
not in answer to, such pressure
tactics."
No Discrimination
BYU officials have complained
that while the school is
Mormon-owned, it does not
enunciate church policy.
University President Ernest
Wilkinson has said BYU "has no
policy which discriminates in any
way whatsoever against any race."
BYU officials announced a
step-up in recruiting of Negro
athletes, and have signed one
black football player.
