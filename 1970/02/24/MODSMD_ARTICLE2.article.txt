## Arabs Terrorists Attack Tourist Bus 
### 
(AP)— Arab terrorists attacked a
bus carrying 37 Americans on a
tour of the Holy Land yesterday,
killing one American woman and
wounding two others and an
Israeli guide.
The attack came shortly after
Switzerland issued an order
barring virtually all Arab nationals
from entering the country and at
about the same time Israeli Prime
Minister Golda Meir was calling on
nations throughout the world to
help stop Arab attacks on civilian
airlines.
Forty-seven persons were killed
Saturday when a Swissair jetliner
bound for Tel Aviv crashed in
Switzerland following an
explosion in the baggage
compartment. The same day, an
Austrian airliner carrying mail
bound for Israel made an
emergency landing at Frankfurt
after a similar explosion.
The bus, carrying a group of
Americans on a Baptist-sponsored
tour of Bible lands, was on the
outskirts of Hebron in
Israeli-occupied Jordan when the
terrorists struck.
In Bern, Swiss President Hans
Peter Tschudi told a news
conference that his government
had decided to stop issuing visas
to visitors from Arab states except
for humanitarian trips, such as
visits with ailing relatives, and
"where significant Swiss interests
are at stake."
This category would include
diplomatic and important business
visits.
Tschudi said tourist visas
would no longer be given to Arabs
except in "extraordinary cases"
such as trips by journalists.
Airstrip Taken
VIENTIANE Laos (AP) - North
Vietnamese forces captured

position, Muong Soui, and its
airstrip today, the Defense

The Defense Ministry
spokesman, Col. Thongphanh
Knoksy, said a North Vietnamese
battalion launched the attack
after dusk Monday and overran
Muong Soui about 9 a.m.

company of government troops,

Carswrli
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Sen. Alan
Cranston described U.S. Supreme
Court justice nominee G. Harrold
Carswell yesterday as a man
whose "talents are permeated by a
ubiquitous mediocrity," and said
he will vote against Carswell's
confirmation.
Cranston, D-Calif., told a news
conference that Carswell is
"totally without distinction as a
jurist, lawyer and United States
attorney."
"In picking first Haynsworth
and now Carswell," Cranston said,
"the President obviously has made

geography his prime
consideration.
"Plainly, neither man would
have been nominated if he lived
elsewhere. Their selections are an
affront to the South."

Carswrli
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Sen. Alan
Cranston described U.S. Supreme
Court justice nominee G. Harrold
Carswell yesterday as a man
whose "talents are permeated by a
ubiquitous mediocrity," and said
he will vote against Carswell's
confirmation.
Cranston, D-Calif., told a news
conference that Carswell is
"totally without distinction as a
jurist, lawyer and United States
attorney."
"In picking first Haynsworth
and now Carswell," Cranston said,
"the President obviously has made

geography his prime
consideration.
"Plainly, neither man would
have been nominated if he lived
elsewhere. Their selections are an
affront to the South."
(AP)— Arab terrorists attacked a
bus carrying 37 Americans on a
tour of the Holy Land yesterday,
killing one American woman and
wounding two others and an
Israeli guide.
The attack came shortly after
Switzerland issued an order
barring virtually all Arab nationals
from entering the country and at
about the same time Israeli Prime
Minister Golda Meir was calling on
nations throughout the world to
help stop Arab attacks on civilian
airlines.
Forty-seven persons were killed
Saturday when a Swissair jetliner
bound for Tel Aviv crashed in
Switzerland following an
explosion in the baggage
compartment. The same day, an
Austrian airliner carrying mail
bound for Israel made an
emergency landing at Frankfurt
after a similar explosion.
The bus, carrying a group of
Americans on a Baptist-sponsored
tour of Bible lands, was on the
outskirts of Hebron in
Israeli-occupied Jordan when the
terrorists struck.
In Bern, Swiss President Hans
Peter Tschudi told a news
conference that his government
had decided to stop issuing visas
to visitors from Arab states except
for humanitarian trips, such as
visits with ailing relatives, and
"where significant Swiss interests
are at stake."
This category would include
diplomatic and important business
visits.
Tschudi said tourist visas
would no longer be given to Arabs
except in "extraordinary cases"
such as trips by journalists.
