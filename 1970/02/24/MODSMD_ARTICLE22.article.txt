## Nixon Panel Asks End Of Draft 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
special commission told President
Nixon today the draft can be
eliminated next year and the
armed forces switched gradually
to an all-volunteer basis with
higher pay and other reforms.
The commission told Nixon
"the nation's interests will be
better served by an all-volunteer
force, supported by an effective
standby draft, than by a mixed

force of volunteers and
conscripts."
The 15-member group, set up
last March, recommended that the
Nixon administration ask congress
for prompt enactment of pay
increases, particularly for young
first enlistment servicemen and
lieutenants, and other
improvements. It proposed that
the draft law die June 30, 1971.
Achievement of an all-volunteer

military force would carry out a
major campaign pledge by Nixon.

The panel estimated it would
cost about $3.24 billion to put
the new draft-free force into
effect the first year. This would
raise the defense budget for fiscal
1971 to a total of more than $75
billion.
The group took no stand on
how big an all-volunteer force
should be but offered proposals
for a two-million man force to
cost an estimated $4.6 billion.
It appeared to lean toward a
middle ground force of about 2.5
million at an annual cost of about
$2.1 billion.
Military manpower specialists
have said in advance that the
commission was trying to reach an
all-volunteer force at an
unrealisiically low cost.
In the past, government studies
have suggested a true all-volunteer
force would require up to $17
billion more a year.
The 15-man panel headed by
former Secretary of Defense
Thomas Gates, said it believes that
if reforms including increased skill
pay and reserve pay and greater
recruiting efforts, put into effect
this year, enough volunteers will
be attracted to the service to
permit transition to a wholly
voluntary armed force in 1971,
with the draft machinery on a
standby basis for emergencies.
The United States now has

about 3.3 million men under arms
and is gradually reducing that
force as troops are withdrawn
from the Vietnam war.
Base I'ay
Pay increases would be
concentrated largely with the
first-term serviceman, raising the
average base pay for a private
from $180 a month to $315 a
month and increasing fringe
benefits, housing, food and other
allowances from $301 to $437 a
month.
Critics have contended the
commission was missing a major
point in pursuit of an all-volunteer
force by minimizing additional
benefits for veteran servicemen.
These critics contend a viable
all-volunteer force is not possible
unless enough skilled veterans are
kept in uniform.
Basic pay of lieutenants in their
first year would be raised from an
average level of $428 a month to
$5 78 and their total
compensation, including
allowances, from $717 a month to
$869 a month.
The commission said an
al I-vol un teer force would
''minimize government
interference with the freedom of
the individual to determine his
own life in accord with his own
values," while removing what are
called present inequities lor first
term servicemen and promoting
efficiency and dignity of the
armed forces.
