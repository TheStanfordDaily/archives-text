# Free Will Called Best Birth Control
## 
### 
"The most effective birth
control is the free will if
individual couples in a society
that offers opportunity for the
advancement of themselves and
their children," Prof. Dudley Kirk
of Stanford's Food Research
Institute told the World Affairs
Council at a Rickey's Hyatt House
luncheon last Thursday.
Kirk, internationally known
demographer and former director
of the demographic division of the
Population Council, New York,
conceded that indeed there is a
world population explosion.
But this crisis is more of
"general social and economic
development" in the two-thirds of
the world that does not yet have
the basic amenities, rather than
general famine, he said.
"Almost all countries are
showing some degree of progress
in economic development, in
education, health and general
well-being," Kirk said.
As a matter of fact, instead of
famine by 1975, the UN's Food
and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) estimates there will be a
market surplus of food in much of
the less developed world by that
date, Kirk pointed out.
But, he emphasized, "here is
the big question: Will the
two-thirds (of the world) who live
in the less developed countries
follow the rest of us in drastically
reducing the birth rate? Unless
they do, the race between
population and food must
ultimately be lost."
Studies have shown, he

continued, that everywhere in the
less developed world families have
shown a preference for fewer
children.
"There is a rapidly growing
market for family planning in
almost every country," he said.
The problem is not to achieve
zero population growth
immediately, for that is a
long-term project, Kirk said.
"The practical problem is how
to reduce runaway growth in the
world to reasonable growth, such
as from three percent to one
percent."
"The paradox is that rapid
population growth inhibits rapid
progress, but high birth rates and
rapid population growth are
themselves a function of
underdevelopment," he said.
Coercive birth control methods
are not the answer, he maintained.
They would be "more likely to
bring down the government than
the birth rate." Such crash
programs are "morally dubious,
politically dangerous, and
potentially subject to appalling
misuse."
What can the U.S. do to help
the population control problem?
"First, we. . .can provide help
in economic and social
development" by boosting "our
disgracefully low foreign aid to
promote the better health,
education, and well-being of our
fellow-men."
This should not be through
liberal dispensing of our grain
surplus, but by increasing our aid
for development of local
agriculture, he suggested.

programs are "morally dubious,
politically dangerous, and
potentially subject to appalling
misuse."
What can the U.S. do to help
the population control problem?
"First, we. . .can provide help
in economic and social
development" by boosting "our
disgracefully low foreign aid to
promote the better health,
education, and well-being of our
fellow-men."
This should not be through
liberal dispensing of our grain
surplus, but by increasing our aid
for development of local
agriculture, he suggested.
"The most effective birth
control is the free will if
individual couples in a society
that offers opportunity for the
advancement of themselves and
their children," Prof. Dudley Kirk
of Stanford's Food Research
Institute told the World Affairs
Council at a Rickey's Hyatt House
luncheon last Thursday.
Kirk, internationally known
demographer and former director
of the demographic division of the
Population Council, New York,
conceded that indeed there is a
world population explosion.
But this crisis is more of
"general social and economic
development" in the two-thirds of
the world that does not yet have
the basic amenities, rather than
general famine, he said.
"Almost all countries are
showing some degree of progress
in economic development, in
education, health and general
well-being," Kirk said.
As a matter of fact, instead of
famine by 1975, the UN's Food
and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) estimates there will be a
market surplus of food in much of
the less developed world by that
date, Kirk pointed out.
But, he emphasized, "here is
the big question: Will the
two-thirds (of the world) who live
in the less developed countries
follow the rest of us in drastically
reducing the birth rate? Unless
they do, the race between
population and food must
ultimately be lost."
Studies have shown, he

continued, that everywhere in the
less developed world families have
shown a preference for fewer
children.
"There is a rapidly growing
market for family planning in
almost every country," he said.
The problem is not to achieve
zero population growth
immediately, for that is a
long-term project, Kirk said.
"The practical problem is how
to reduce runaway growth in the
world to reasonable growth, such
as from three percent to one
percent."
"The paradox is that rapid
population growth inhibits rapid
progress, but high birth rates and
rapid population growth are
themselves a function of
underdevelopment," he said.
Coercive birth control methods
are not the answer, he maintained.
They would be "more likely to
bring down the government than
the birth rate." Such crash
programs are "morally dubious,
politically dangerous, and
potentially subject to appalling
misuse."
