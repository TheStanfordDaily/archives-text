# Professor Laments 'Sick' Modern Novel
## 
### 
"The trouble with the novel is
| partly that it has a lousy society
to reflect, and partly that the
confused and critical times keep
men of talent from reflecting it
well, and partly that those same
confused times lead readers to ask
j the wrong things of nevelists."
The novel, in sum, is sick but
far from dead, says Wallace
Stegner, Jackson E. Reynolds
Professor of Humanities and for
24 years director of the Creative
Writing Program He spoke
Sunday Feb. 15, at an Alumni
Conference at the Century Plaza
Hotel in Los Angeles attended by
more than 1000 alumni.
Many of today's fiction writers,
said Stegner, a prolific novelist
himself, are confused "between
honesty and bad manners,
. honesty and rebelliousness,
honesty and a foul mouth,
honesty and sadism It isn't
1 surprising that both novelists and
! readers lose their way. . .The
dirtiest words we know are
j 'conventional' and 'traditional,'
unless they are 'square' and
'straight'."
That is why so much fiction "is
! the satisfaction of mass taste,
which is always vulgar," he said.
Middle ('.lass Voice
The novel is the "literary voice
of the middle class," and while
Czarist Russia had no middle class
J and was "autocratic and
j censored," there were Puskin,
Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoyevsky,
Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gorky, "any
| one of them enough to make a
j renaissance."
Yet with our "vast and
proserous middle class and greater
freedom of subject and language
than any age I can think of in
I human history. . .we have not
produced any incontrovertibly
| great" novelists since the '20's.
What we get now, said Stegner,
are books like C.inger Man, Giles
(ioal Boy , Porlnoy's Complaint,
Sick Friends — "the arid
intellectualism of a Susan
Sonntag, the angry pistol
whippings of a Leßoi Jones, the
1 slick salacities of a Jacqueline
Suzanne."
Novelists Taken Seriously
With the exception of
Jacqueline Suzanne, Stegner
noted, the others names "are
taken seriously. If they followed
soberer gods, we could ignore the
mass market, arrange a peaceful
coexistence with it.
"But they don't, and neither,
bv mv experience, do the young

and talented who are coming up,
the people I deal with daily."
These young writers, Stegner
said, see the troubled world
around them and want to solve its
problems. He has high hopes that
they can help. They have
"conviction, sympathy, a sort of
idealism, the desire to be honest. .
(and) honesty and commitment
can take forms that dismay the
godly.
"Fiction still does reflect
society, but it is a society that
many are appalled by. It will go
on reflecting society right up to
the moment of apocalypse?And if
one takes the hopeful view,
fiction may even help stall off
apocalypse by making us more
profoundly aware of what we are
and where we tend.

The novel, in sum, is sick but
far from dead, says Wallace
Stegner, Jackson E. Reynolds
Professor of Humanities and for
24 years director of the Creative
Writing Program He spoke
Sunday Feb. 15, at an Alumni
Conference at the Century Plaza
Hotel in Los Angeles attended by
more than 1000 alumni.
Many of today's fiction writers,
said Stegner, a prolific novelist
himself, are confused "between
honesty and bad manners,
. honesty and rebelliousness,
honesty and a foul mouth,
honesty and sadism It isn't
1 surprising that both novelists and
! readers lose their way. . .The
dirtiest words we know are
j 'conventional' and 'traditional,'
unless they are 'square' and
'straight'."
That is why so much fiction "is
! the satisfaction of mass taste,
which is always vulgar," he said.
Middle ('.lass Voice
The novel is the "literary voice
of the middle class," and while
Czarist Russia had no middle class
J and was "autocratic and
j censored," there were Puskin,
Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoyevsky,
Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gorky, "any
| one of them enough to make a
j renaissance."
Yet with our "vast and
proserous middle class and greater
freedom of subject and language
than any age I can think of in
I human history. . .we have not
produced any incontrovertibly
| great" novelists since the '20's.
What we get now, said Stegner,
are books like C.inger Man, Giles
(ioal Boy , Porlnoy's Complaint,
Sick Friends — "the arid
intellectualism of a Susan
Sonntag, the angry pistol
whippings of a Leßoi Jones, the
1 slick salacities of a Jacqueline
Suzanne."
Novelists Taken Seriously
With the exception of
Jacqueline Suzanne, Stegner
noted, the others names "are
taken seriously. If they followed
soberer gods, we could ignore the
mass market, arrange a peaceful
coexistence with it.
"But they don't, and neither,
bv mv experience, do the young

and talented who are coming up,
the people I deal with daily."
These young writers, Stegner
said, see the troubled world
around them and want to solve its
problems. He has high hopes that
they can help. They have
"conviction, sympathy, a sort of
idealism, the desire to be honest. .
(and) honesty and commitment
can take forms that dismay the
godly.
"Fiction still does reflect
society, but it is a society that
many are appalled by. It will go
on reflecting society right up to
the moment of apocalypse?And if
one takes the hopeful view,
fiction may even help stall off
apocalypse by making us more
profoundly aware of what we are
and where we tend.
"The trouble with the novel is
| partly that it has a lousy society
to reflect, and partly that the
confused and critical times keep
men of talent from reflecting it
well, and partly that those same
confused times lead readers to ask
j the wrong things of nevelists."
