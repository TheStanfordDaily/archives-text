KZSU Tuesday strongly
condemned "wanton acts of
destruction" by participants in a
torchlight parade down El Camino
Real Monday night.
In an editorial, the station
asked, "How can we look to the
community for financial and
ideological support when it
awakes one morning to find its
windows shattered and image
defaced, with no real explanations
as to shy?
"The chanting and destruction
staged in a midnight march
through a sleeping California
suburb has no substantial
connection to the judicial
controversies being thrashed out
in Chicago and New York."

American History will celebrate
200 years of California history
with a conference at Tresidder
