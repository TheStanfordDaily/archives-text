## Troupe Presents Powerful 'Antigone' 
### ROBIN LAKE 
Saturday, at the University of
Pacific in Stockton, I saw
Anouilh's "Antigone" performed
in French by the Treteau de Paris.
They will be playing in Memorial
Auditorium at 8:30 p.m. this
Wednesday sponsored by Public
Events. "Antihone" is written and
performed without intermission
and runs 1 3 A hours.
I am generally wary when a
director plays his own lead (or an
author directs his own play); the
results are too easily incestuously
disastrous, as in the case of the
1968 "Tartuffe". However, when
such a combination succeeds as it
does in this powerful production
of "Antigone" the resulting
perfection of co-ordination makes
the gamble seem worthwhile.-
Jean Davy directs and plays
Creon to Reine Barteve's
Antigone. M. Davy can never be
forgotten for his magnetic
performance as Anne Vercors in
Claudel's "L'Annonce Faite a'
Marie" in 1965. He is a master of
maximum expression coupled
with economy of gesture, wasting
neigher word nor movement. He
can play a scene immobile, his
hands in his pockets, and still
command the focus. His Creon is
impeccable - the tortured
statesman who said yes to
responsibility ("C'est facile de
dire non! .... Pour dire oui, il
faut suer"), and is now suffering
the results of his decision.
His ship-of-state speech and his
account of the absurdity of the
brothers' deaths are notable
highlights of his magnetism. His
character is superbly capsuled in
his desdainful rejection of
"l'orgueil d'Oedipe."
nder The Noses
It should be remembered that
the play was written and
presented in occupied Paris of
1 944. Jean Davy was the original
Creon for this celebrated
production whose shattering
impact fanned the fires of
patriotism in a city as yet without
hope of liberation. How the
Germans failed to recognise the
symbolic inflammatory parallels
and allowed the play to open has
become part of the legned of Nazi
narrowmindedness.
Based closely on Sophocles
"Antigone," the affirmation of
the possibility of personal
freedom and choice is reinforced
in Anouilh's version by Creon's
destruction of Antigone's religious
and familial excuses for her
action. She is left alone to face
the truth for herself.
Reine Barteve's Antigone is
forceful and convincing. She is
such a striking figure onstage that
it is difficult to tear one's eyes
away when the focus is elsewhere.
This problem is recognised and

overcome in the 40 minute
confrontation duet with Creon,
which forms the hub of the
dramatic argument, by keeping
the two characters together so we
can catch action and reaction in
the same giance. While there will
be little argument about the
effectiveness of Mile. Barteve's
portrayal there may possibly be
confusion as to her presentation.
An Acquired Taste
Like many good things, French
Theatre is probably an acquired
taste for foreigners, and especially
Classical French Drama - and I
include this play. Mile. Barteve's
flashing eyes and intensity of
diction are elements generally lost
to the American stage and often
considered tools of the
declamatory style. I personally
opt for a return to such
pyrotechnics, in context. What
fire! What precision of expression.
What a delight to hear trained
French actors, all of them, relish
every vowel and consonant of a
beautiful language and share them
with us.
The Conservatory of Music at
U. of P. is much smaller than
Mem. Barn and was curtained
half-way (if only we could!). An
audience of 400 is manageable.
While I do not fear for the players
of Le Treteau, who will
undoubtedly rise to the occasion
and must have overcome worse
monsters on tour, it can only be
regretted that a university of
Stanford's reputation still does
not have a decent 600 seat
theater. No wonder SRT never
had a chance of paying its way,
among its other problems.
No Gimmicks
Antigone is not an easy
production for an American
audience and there are no
gimmicks. Oskar Gustin,
well-known for his use of metal in
decor, has provided an interesting

and aesthetic setting. His metallic
pieces help to modernise the
situation yet are abstract enough
to keep it detached in time. Stark
but functional (the author's term
is "neutral"), they would appear
to be eminently practical in terms

of weight, space and adaptability
for touring. They take light well
and encircle the action. There is a
suggestion of modernised version
of a Racinian palais-a-volonte.
Likewise, Ruben Torres'
neutral but balanced costumes are

suggestive through their severity
of line and color. A cloak blends
with Nehru jackets, turtlenecks
and minis to add strength to the
striking physical beauty of the
entire ensemble.
Comic Relief
Jocelyn Canoen's guard
provides the necessary touch of
comic relief. He is most effective
in his early scenes. The final scene
has the problem of stressing
Antigone's plight without losing
energy. Alain MacMoy's Chorus is
very effective. Here is the classical
type of suspense - not what? but
how? The Churus reminds us of
the story in the prologue. Relying
largely on his vocal legerdemain
M. MacMoy winds powerfully but
discreetly in and out of the action
with Creon and sums up with just
the right Anouilh gesture of "Et
voila!"
The Nurse, Ismene, the
Messenger, the Page and the
guards all add their disciplined
performances to the overall
climate of absurd necessity that
can only end in tragedy. Anouilh
is one of the world's most
produced playwrights and ever
popular with actors of whom even
his minor roles provide exciting
vehicles.
Gold Gesture
This production is a bold
gesture, a lot to ask of American
audiences. But in making no
compromises it gives us the
opportunity to share the best. To
know the play is NOT enough.
Much depends on the text; the
humor of the three guards, the
Nurse's reaction to Antigone's
appeal ot to scold her dog,
Creon's frantic attempts to
explain his world to a generation
he can never rejoin - the idealism
of youth. Antigone's childlike
outbursts ("Je ne veus pas
comprendre. . .11 y a des fois ou il
ne faut pas trop reflechir. . . Je
veus tout") require recognition
and comprehension for maximum
enjoyment.
It is to be most sincerely hoped
that the teachers who will bring
their French and Drama students
from all over the Bay area have
taken the time to prepare them
thoroughly or they will be doing
them a great disservice and
defeating their purpose. Unless
your French is very good make
the time to reread the text, in
French if possible, before you go
or you will have only yourself to
blame. Without such preparation,
which is the least courtesy you
can offer yourself and our visitors,
you may well need a great deal of
patience.
Above all, if you speak or are
studying French, or enjoy
incomparable drama, do not miss
Antigone. Tickets at the door if
still available.
