# This Week's Flicks
## Hitchcock, Wells Featured 
### TODD McCARTHY 
The coming film week is highlighted by works
of Welles, Hitchcock, Bunuel and Richardson.
"Pride and Prejudice" is a prime example of a
Hollywood picture in which the star performances
and general studio craftsmanship transcend the
limitations of a pedestrian director. In this case the
studio is MGM and the stars are Laurence Olivier,
Greer Garson, Maureen O'Sullivan and Edmund
Gwenn. Following this comedy tonight in Geology
320 will be "ThePrisoner of Zenda," a classic
swashbuckler with a stellar line-up of Ronald
Colman, Madeleine Carroll, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.,
Mary Astor, Raymond Massey and David Niven.
"Monika," made in 1952, was one of Ingmar
Bergman's earlier films and not one of his more
important ones. Nonetheless, it marked the first
collaboration of Bergman and one of his best
actresses, Harriet Anderson. In Bishop Auditorium
tonight at 7:30 and 9:30.
Powerful Documentary
This week's International Association film is the
superb documentary, "Come Back Africa." After
having obtained permission from the rigid South
African authorities to shoot a study of tribal
dancing, American film maker Lionel Rogosin
secretly made a remarkable expose of the pathetic
working and living conditions for black miners.
This powerful look at racism in its most
frightening operative sense will be shown in
Cubberley at 7:45 on Thursday.
In 1959, "Room at the Top" was considered a
pace setter for its frank language and blunt story
telling. Fortunately, the story holds up well today,
as do the performances of Laurence Harvey and
Simone Signoret, who won an Academy Award.
This "angry young man" film, directed by Jack
Clayton, will be shown on Friday at 7 and 9:30 in
Cubberley.

The double bill of "The Immortal Story" and
"Simon of the Desert" should not be missed if
only because the work of Orson Welles and Luis
Bunuel should never be missed. Neither of these
hour-long films represents a major point in their
makers' careers, though Welles' use of color is
exquisite, as are the performances of Jeanne
Moreau and Roger Coggio. "Simon" represents
Bunuel at his most devilishly cynical, despite the
disappointing denouement. At Tresidder on Friday
at 7, 8 and 9.
Stanley Kramer isn't exactly my cup of tea, but
despite the incredibly obviqus allegory, the
doomed romance between Oscar Werner and
Simone Signoret in "Ship of Fools" is
occassionally rather touching. The picture, being
shown Friday in Bishop. Auditorium, also marks
Vivien Leigh's last screen appearence.
Laurence Olivier is absolutely brilliant as Archie
Rice in Tony Richardson's "The Entertainer," an
otherwise rather depressing account of a seedy
vaudevillian who meddles in other people's lives.
Albert Finney and Alan Bates were just beginning
their cinematic careers when they co-starred in this
adaptation of John Osborne's play. At Tresidder
on Saturday at 7, 8 and 9.
Thriller Classic
For all the noteriety surrounding the shower
sequence in "Psycho," the relatively more simple
murder of Martin Balsam is infinitely more
shocking. This Alfred Hitchcock mystery, one of
the certified American classics of the sixties, stars
Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh and will be
shown in Cubberley at 7, 9 and 11 on Saturday.
"The Lion in Winter" comes off like Neil Simon
trying to write Shakespeare and the hammy acting,
particularly by Katharine Hepburn, further serves
to falsify the already comic melodrama. It could
mean a lot of laughs this week at the Sunday
Flicks.
