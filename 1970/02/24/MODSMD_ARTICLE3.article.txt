# Pitzer Refuses Shift In Land Policies
## 
### RICHARD EMBRY 
President Pitzer declared
Friday that although University
master plans for future land use
will be reviewed, current projects
near Page Mill Road and on
Coyote Hill cannot be halted.
Pitzer made the statement in a
letter to Mrs. Robert Coates, a
member of a group from Barron
Park called "Citizens Opposed to
the Dillingham Project" (CODP).
On February 11, the group
presented Alf E. Brandin,
University Vice-President for
Business Affairs, with a petition
signed by 530 local residents
asking that Pitzer "reconsider"
the Dillingham Project, a
commercial development to be
located at the intersection of Page
Mill and El Camino. Current
plans, approved by the Palo Alto
Planning Commission and City
Council, call for the construction
of a financial center and hotel on
the '21 acre site.
The protest petition said the
construction would add to traffic
and pollution problems as well as
the housing shortage.
Pitzer Expresses Concern
In his letter to Mrs. Coates,
Pitzer claimed that he shares
expressed concerns for the
environment and has asked the
University Committee on Land
and Building Development "to
review carefully our plans for the
use of lands outside the Academic
Reserve."
"In this connection," Pitzer

continued, "the Board of Trustees
this month authorized the hiring
of an outside consultant to assist
in the review and updating of our
plans."
"Projects which have been
authorized by all the appropriate
bodies and on which firm
commitments already have been
made have not been included in
this review, for to do so would
constitute an ex post facto action
which is neither equitable to the
parties concerned nor responsive
to the regular processes of
government."
Im port an t Com 111 it men Is
"The question of the
commitments already made by
the University is one that cannot
be lightly brushed aside by any
individual or institution. Many
parties have negotiated with
Stanford in good faith over a
period of years with the natural
expectation that the University
would go forward if proper
approval were granted."
Pitzer explained that "to
cancel all those agreements
unilaterally would expose the
University to serious legal action
and undermine confidence in the
institution."
Michael Sweeney, a member of
Grass Roots, which has opposed
many of the University's land-use
policies, commented, "Pitzer
claims that a moratorium on
development would expose the
University to serious legal action.
That is untrue. Until the
Dillingham lease is actually signed,
the University is under no legal
obligation.
Dillingham A Disaster
"The Dillingham project," he
said, "would be a disaster for the
Mid-Peninsula environment, and
that is why Grass Roots is
working against it."
"Members of the CQDP feel
that President Pitzer's letter, like
administrator Brandin's meeting
with the group, was designed
more to mollify disgruntled
citizens than to seriously consider
complaints. Although the
University acted thru necessary
legal channels, this in no way
constituted a concern for the
thousands of Palo Alto citizens
who will have to live with the
unsightly Dillingham Project and
its contribution to the smog,
traffic, and reality problems, etc.,
which are rapidly rendering a
healthy life impossible in the Bay
Area.

many of the University's land-use
policies, commented, "Pitzer
claims that a moratorium on
development would expose the
University to serious legal action.
That is untrue. Until the
Dillingham lease is actually signed,
the University is under no legal
obligation.
Dillingham A Disaster
"The Dillingham project," he
said, "would be a disaster for the
Mid-Peninsula environment, and
that is why Grass Roots is
working against it."
"Members of the CQDP feel
that President Pitzer's letter, like
administrator Brandin's meeting
with the group, was designed
more to mollify disgruntled
citizens than to seriously consider
complaints. Although the
University acted thru necessary
legal channels, this in no way
constituted a concern for the
thousands of Palo Alto citizens
who will have to live with the
unsightly Dillingham Project and
its contribution to the smog,
traffic, and reality problems, etc.,
which are rapidly rendering a
healthy life impossible in the Bay
Area.
President Pitzer declared
Friday that although University
master plans for future land use
will be reviewed, current projects
near Page Mill Road and on
Coyote Hill cannot be halted.
Pitzer made the statement in a
letter to Mrs. Robert Coates, a
member of a group from Barron
Park called "Citizens Opposed to
the Dillingham Project" (CODP).
On February 11, the group
presented Alf E. Brandin,
University Vice-President for
Business Affairs, with a petition
signed by 530 local residents
asking that Pitzer "reconsider"
the Dillingham Project, a
commercial development to be
located at the intersection of Page
Mill and El Camino. Current
plans, approved by the Palo Alto
Planning Commission and City
Council, call for the construction
of a financial center and hotel on
the '21 acre site.
The protest petition said the
construction would add to traffic
and pollution problems as well as
the housing shortage.
Pitzer Expresses Concern
In his letter to Mrs. Coates,
Pitzer claimed that he shares
expressed concerns for the
environment and has asked the
University Committee on Land
and Building Development "to
review carefully our plans for the
use of lands outside the Academic
Reserve."
"In this connection," Pitzer

continued, "the Board of Trustees
this month authorized the hiring
of an outside consultant to assist
in the review and updating of our
plans."
"Projects which have been
authorized by all the appropriate
bodies and on which firm
commitments already have been
made have not been included in
this review, for to do so would
constitute an ex post facto action
which is neither equitable to the
parties concerned nor responsive
to the regular processes of
government."

"The question of the
commitments already made by
the University is one that cannot
be lightly brushed aside by any
individual or institution. Many
parties have negotiated with
Stanford in good faith over a
period of years with the natural
expectation that the University
would go forward if proper
approval were granted."
Pitzer explained that "to
cancel all those agreements
unilaterally would expose the
University to serious legal action
and undermine confidence in the
institution."

Grass Roots, which has opposed
