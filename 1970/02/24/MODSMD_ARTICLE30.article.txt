# Cards Win 2, Lose Streak
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
The intriguing question of
whether Stanford would ever lose
another baseball game has been
answered.
Yes, sports fans, the Indians
are no longer undefeated.
After winning their first seven
games, the Tribe came up against
a phenomenal pitching effort in
the first game of Saturday's
doubleheader with Cal Poly of
Pomona and lost 1-0 in 10
innings.
But, to dispel any thoughts
that losing was more than passing
fancy, the varsity nine sandwiched
the loss around two wins over the
same Cal Poly team. On Friday,
Jim Coate and Bruce Schoen
combined to defeat the visitors
7-2, and in Saturday's second
game the Tribe triumphed 3-0
behind Steve Dunning.
The best game of the weekend
was Saturday's opener. Coach Ray
Young sent senior right-hander
Phil Keller to the mound against

Cal Poly's Mark Wiley. Keller,
you'll remember, has been
bothered at times this spring with
back pains, and hadn't pitched for
more than a week.
Yet while Keller was in good
form Saturday, Wiley was
sensation. The Cal Poly
right-hander baffled the Indians to
the tune of 17 strike outs, six hits
and two walks over the ten
frames.
The Pomonan started the game
by fanning four in the first inning,
three more in the second, and was
in serious trouble only in the
ninth. But the Cards, despite five
stolen bases, couldn't put a run
across, stranding ten runners in
the process.
Keller Strong
Keller, meanwhile, was equally
effective. He relinquished only
five hits and fanned five, keeping
the opposition scoreless until the
tenth. Then, with one out, Cal
Poly second baseman Dan Blood
singled and advanced to second on

a wild pitch. After Tom Smithson
walked, Gil Marrijo singled in the
game's only run.
Wiley retired the three Indians
he faced in the bottom half of the
frame, and there went the streak.
Runs were equally hard to
come by in the nightcap. The
conflict was scoreless until the
seventh when Stanford's Mike
Ewing walked, was picked off but
went to second when the first
baseman didn't throw the ball fast
enough, and advanced to third on
a bunt by Dunning, who was safe
at first. Then Bob Marshall singled
to drive in the Indians' first run in
17 innings.
Phil Kelber scored in Dunning
with a grounder to second and
Curt Fant, who had five hits on
the day, singled in Marshall.
Junior Dunning fanned six and
gave up five hits en route to the
shutout, but had to be bailed out
of jams on several occasions.
Second baseman Kelber made the
play of the day in the eighth when
he charged a slow-rolling
grounder, tagged a runner going to
thhe bag, then threw to first for
the doubleplay.
Co ate Does It All
On Friday Coate scattered six
hits and two runs over eight
innings to pick up his third win of
the young season. He also had a
single and a double to raise his
batting average to a cool .500.
The game was encouraging for
local fans only only because
Stanford won, but also because
the Indians, often in trouble, were
frequently able to bail themselves
out.
The Tribe put two runs on the
board in the fourth when
Dunning, starting at third base,
singled and stole second, catcher
Bob Reece walked and Coate
singled. Dave Edson's single later
scored Reece.
Dunning's triple scored Ewing
in the fifth, and Coate's double
tallied Reece in the sixth. The
Cards then scored twice in the
seventh and once more in thy
eighth.
Dunning went three for three
on the day, and Edson was three
for five.
The Indians return to action

this afternoon, facing San
Francisco State at 2:30 in Sunken
Diamond.
In a soph-frosh game on
Saturday Stanford edged Contra
Costa J.C. Mike Timmel went six

innings to ge the win and wasn't
in trouble after giving up a run in
the first. Andy Franks knocked in
six runs, Bob Wilhelm five and
Gary Osterhout three. The score:
19-1.
