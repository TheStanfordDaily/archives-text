# Relaxed Bears Stretch String
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Relaxed and confident,
California's talent-laden
gymnastics team—which could be
on its way to a second national
title in three years—displayed its
coordinated brilliance to a
near-capacity Encina crowd
Saturday night, breezing to a
152.9 score.
The classy Bears, who gave
some of their second line
performers a chance to compete
after last week's open-throttle
confrontation with second-ranked
Washington, were definitely the
main attraction.
But Stanford, which finished
with a 137.75 total, also provided
a number of quality spectacles in
putting together its finest
performance of the year.
Washington State scored third
in the three-team show with 111.5
points.
Berkeley's freshman ace
Minoru Morisaki had the highest
all-around score, as expected, with
a 53.15 mark. He placed first in
the high bar (9.2), parallel bars
(9.0), side horse (8.3) and free
exercise (9.1).
Stanford's Steve Rochell,
plagued last week by jitters, came
back beautifully with an excellent
performance on the rings which
earned steady applause almost
from beginning to end. He paced
all competitors with a 9.1 score,
his best this season.
California's Eric Courchesne,
always a crowd-pleaser because of
the polio handicap he has
overcome, was below his usual
form but still finished with an 8.9;

Rochell and Courcnesntr ...ude the
rings the highlight of the evening.
Indian freshman Rich Jerome
finished second in the all-around
totals with 48.25. He scored
above eight four events, his 8.85
in vaulting his highest. He added
an 8.55 in free exercise, 8.5 on
the parallel bars and 8.35 on the
high bar.
California's Dan Bowles
registered the night's high score
with a 9.25 vault, an event swept
by the Bears with all three men
hitting nine or better.
Other high Stanford scores
came from Dennis Mesick who
was second best on the side horse
at 7.4, and Rochell, whose 8.3
tied him for second with Cal's
George Greenfield on the parallel
bars.
Greenfield, who had been
scheduled to compete in all six
events, scratched out of vaulting
and the high bar; California really
didn't need any more points to
extend its 24-meet win string to
25.
Stanford Coach Dan Millman
ended the long evening—extended
by officials who repeatedly were
unable to agree on scores—with a
mind-boggling exhibition on the
trampoline, on which he bounded
to the championship of the world
in 1964.
Following Millman's
exhibition, the Indian coach
emerged from a post-meet team
meeting and said that starting
next year home performances
would be limited to two teams, if
possible; each of the three-way
meets this season has lasted nearly
three hours.

Berkeley's freshman ace
Minoru Morisaki had the highest
all-around score, as expected, with
a 53.15 mark. He placed first in
the high bar (9.2), parallel bars
(9.0), side horse (8.3) and free
exercise (9.1).
Stanford's Steve Rochell,
plagued last week by jitters, came
back beautifully with an excellent
performance on the rings which
earned steady applause almost
from beginning to end. He paced
all competitors with a 9.1 score,
his best this season.
California's Eric Courchesne,
always a crowd-pleaser because of
the polio handicap he has
overcome, was below his usual
form but still finished with an 8.9;

Rochell and Courcnesntr ...ude the
rings the highlight of the evening.
Indian freshman Rich Jerome
finished second in the all-around
totals with 48.25. He scored
above eight four events, his 8.85
in vaulting his highest. He added
an 8.55 in free exercise, 8.5 on
the parallel bars and 8.35 on the
high bar.
California's Dan Bowles
registered the night's high score
with a 9.25 vault, an event swept
by the Bears with all three men
hitting nine or better.
Other high Stanford scores
came from Dennis Mesick who
was second best on the side horse
at 7.4, and Rochell, whose 8.3
tied him for second with Cal's
George Greenfield on the parallel
bars.
Greenfield, who had been
scheduled to compete in all six
events, scratched out of vaulting
and the high bar; California really
didn't need any more points to
extend its 24-meet win string to
25.
Stanford Coach Dan Millman
ended the long evening—extended
by officials who repeatedly were
unable to agree on scores—with a
mind-boggling exhibition on the
trampoline, on which he bounded
to the championship of the world
in 1964.
Following Millman's
exhibition, the Indian coach
emerged from a post-meet team
meeting and said that starting
next year home performances
would be limited to two teams, if
possible; each of the three-way
meets this season has lasted nearly
three hours.
Relaxed and confident,
California's talent-laden
gymnastics team—which could be
on its way to a second national
title in three years—displayed its
coordinated brilliance to a
near-capacity Encina crowd
Saturday night, breezing to a
152.9 score.
The classy Bears, who gave
some of their second line
performers a chance to compete
after last week's open-throttle
confrontation with second-ranked
Washington, were definitely the
main attraction.
But Stanford, which finished
with a 137.75 total, also provided
a number of quality spectacles in
putting together its finest
performance of the year.
Washington State scored third
in the three-team show with 111.5
points.
