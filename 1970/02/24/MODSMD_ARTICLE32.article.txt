# Extra Game Vote Today
## 
### 
Amid persistent reports that
Stanford's 11th football game
next fall will be against Arkansas,
the Student-Faculty Athletic
Committee meets this afternoon
to decide whether or not to
approve the extra contest.
A report published over the
weekend said that negotiations for
the game are "nearly complete."
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor,
however, insists that while "we
have been contacted," by the
Razorbacks, negotiations are "not
very far along."
The report said that the
Indians would play Arkansas in

Fayetteville on Sept. 12 in a
nationally televised match.
Taylor told the Daily that
Arkansas is interested in playing
Stanford but that "If we're
allowed to play the extra game,
we'd probably take a look at
several teams."
The ten-member committee
will convene in the Law School to
rule on the University's stance on
the 11th game. The NCAA gave
schools permission last month to
lengthen their schedules.
Taylor stresses that no
agreements will be reached until
and if the committee approves the

contest. Indications last night
were that the committee would
do so.
Faculty Athletic
Representative John Harbaugh,
meanwhile, lent weight to the
report by saying that if Stanford
did indeed play Arkansas, the
game would be played in Little
Rock, not Fayetteville, due to a
larger stadium in the Arkansas
capital.
And, said Harbaugh, "The TV
makes a big difference, since the
extra expenses involved are
appreciable." Harbaugh, chairman
of the Geology Department, is a

member of the Student-Faculty
Committee.
The Committee, chaired by
Geology professor Robert
Compton, appears likely to weigh
the opinions of the football
players heavily in reaching a
decision. Indications have been
that the team would favor the
extra game only if it was against a
major opponent.
Financial considerations are
also an important factor, since the
Athletic Department would be
able to use any extra revenue
gained from the contest to make
up for university cutbacks.
