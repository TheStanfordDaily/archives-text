# Sad Ending At Home
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
At 9:34 Saturday night
Stanford's varsity basketball team
finished its 1969-70 home season.
In less than 26 hours 6244 lucky
fans had suffered through almost
four hours of turture including
Ernie Filiberti's and Mel Ross'
amazing officiating, the typically
inane cheerleading tryouts,
Washington State's fast break and
most importantly two Stanford
defeats.
When it was all over Stanford
had concluded one of its worst
home seasons in iccent memory as
they won only four out of
thirteen games. The loss leaves the
Indians with a 5-17 overall record
and a 2-9 league mark, worst in
the Pacific-8. With the remaining
three road games against USC,
UCLA, and Cal, Stanford could
end up with its fewest number of
wins since the 1916 season.
Friday night against
Washington State the Tribe was
down 7-0 before Claude Terry
finally hit a free throw after 2:36.
WSU continually burned the
Cards with an excellent fast break
led by speedy guards Rick
Erickson and Dan Steward, and
before long Stanford was down by
19 at 34-15. The Indians made a
small run at the Cougars in the
last six minutes of the half to cut
it to 36-24 at halftime.
Tribe Cold
Stanford hit on only 8 of 29
field goals in the first half and this
accounted for most of their
problems. In the second half
Stanford got as close as nine
points, but the Cougars scored ten
straight in less than three minutes
for a 60-40 lead. From that point
on the Cougars coasted for an
easy 85-62 win.
All the starters for WSU scored
in double figures with Erickson
and .Jim Meredith each tallying

16. Stanford was led by Chuck
Moore's 12 and Terry's 11. The
Indians shot only 38 percent for
the game compared to WSU's 54
percent and the Cougars
additional 14 field goals provided
the margin of victory.
Saturday night's contest against
Washington was a much more
typical Stanford game. It was a
close and exciting, but the end
result was the same; we lost,
78-72. In a direct reversal of the
night before, Stanford jumped off
to a 7-0 lead. The game was very
close throughout the first half, as
neither team had more than a
seven point lead. The half ended
with the Tribe down by only one,
38-37. Stanford shot a hot 54
percent in the first half as Claude
Terry hit on 7 of 13 field goals
and picked up 16 points. George
Irvine led Washington with 17.
Lead Changes
The lead changed hands ten
times in the second half as neither
team could gain a clear advantage.
The difference came in the last
five minutes when usual starting
forward Pat Woolcock entered the
game. He had been benched for
disciplinary reasons, but when the
heat was on Washington coach
Tex Winter relented and sent him
in. He hit on 4 of 4 field goals and
one free throw to account for
nine of the Huskies' final thirteen
points which gave them a 78-72
win.
Stanford's shooting cooled off
radically in the second half as
they hit on only 14 of 40 to end
up at 43 percent. Washington
finished at 51 percent for the
game. The Huskies were led by
Irvine's 27 and sophomore center
Steve Hawes' 24. Terry led the
Tribe with 26 points and Dennis
O'Neill added 19.
Frosh Win
Meanwhile on a brighter note,

Stanford's fine freshman team ran
their record to 12-2 with a pair of
close victories, 84-81 over Cal
Med Centpr and 72-71 over USF
Frosh. Against Cal Med Center
Stanford trailed 61-48 but they
ran off 11 straight to close the
gap.
The little Indians finally took
the lead at 71-70 with 6:33 left
on a hoop by Pat Rusco. The
Cards fought off a scrappy late
run by CMC for their 84-8i win.
Center Pat Stevens led the Frosh
with 20 points and 24 rebounds.
Against USF the Indians fought
back from a 35-32 halftime
defecit for their exciting victory.
John Stratton was the leading
scorer with 24 points while
Stevens added 17. Next
weekend the varsity travels to Los

Angeles to take on USC and
UCLA, while the Frosh travel to
San Jose State to play the SJS
Forsh, who beat the little Indians
in their season opener.
