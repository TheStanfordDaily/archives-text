# Decimated Matmen Dumped By Fresno
## 
### 
The Stanford wrestling team,
without its two undefeated
grapplers, Terry Crenshaw and
Dave Thomas, bowed to a tough
Fresno State contingent Friday
night at the Encina Pavilion. The
final score was 29-13,
Winning with fine performances
for the Tribe were Len Smith and
George Hansen.
Smith (150), in his match,
showed why he is one of
Stanford's top candidates for
Pac-8 honors. Wrestling
aggressively from the outset, he
pinned Chris Joyce with a bar-arm
in 1 :48.
Hansen (159), despite the
stalling tactics of his opponent,
Jim Johnson, posted a creditable
3-1 victory.
Giving strong performances in
losing causes were Ray Williams
(177) and Jerry Beaudoin (142).
The team's season record now
stands at 8-3-1.
Tuesday the Indians face Cal
Poly at San Luis Obispo and
Friday journey to Berkeley for
their final meet. Cal Poly was last
year's NCAA College Division

Champion and has been consistently
strong this year.
Meanwhile the team is making
its final preparation for the Pac-8
Championships at Corvallis,
Oregon, March 5-7. Along with
Smith, leading contenders for
Pac-8 titles are Dave Kopolow
(118), Dave Thomas (142), Terry
Crenshaw (177), and Ray Williams
(190).
Crenshaw has been out for two
weeks suffering from a groin pull
and Dave Thomas was sidelined
last week with a virus. Both are
expected to be back in action
soon.
