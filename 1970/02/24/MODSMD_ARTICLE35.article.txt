# Icemen Tie Bears, 3-3
## 
### 
In a preliminary game to
Saturday night's Oakland Seals -
Pittsburgh Penguins NHL game,
the Stanford Hockey Club tied
California 3-3. "The First Big
Game on Ice" may have lacked
the usual brawls and unruly fans
which characterize pro hockey,
but what NHL team ever had
between-period entertainment by
the Stanford band and dollies?
And how many professional teams
have players that require head
bands to keep their hair out of
their eyes?
The Cat team, adorned in no
less than six kinds of uniforms
and with at least five longhairs in
the lineup, looked as much like a
hockey team as the Peanuts gang.
But when the game finally started,
first impressions were betrayed.
Indians Co Ahead
The first period was dominated
by Stanford, but there was no
scoring until 5:23 remaining when
defenseman Pat Baldwin tallied
unassisted to give the Indians a
1-0 lead. The only excitement the
rest of the period was a double
penalty and near fight, but
non-violence prevailed and the
period ended with no further
scoring or fighting.
The Indians seems content to
sit on their lead, but Cal made
that impossible when they pushed
in three goals in a six minute
period to take a 3-1 lead with
4:35 left in the second period.
After a one minute break
necessitated by the approaching
NHL game, the teams returned to
the ice for the third period.
Finally Stanford started skating
like they can and cut the lead to
3-2 with 13:30 left on a
picture-perfect goal by Flip
Gianos and a beautiful pass from
Bob Kadlec.
Baldwin Ties It
Stanford continued their
offensive push and Paul Tittmann
took a breakaway pass from
Baldwin and tied it up with 9:38
left. Despite continuous efforts to
put the puck past Cal's
surferhaired goalie, the Indians
failed to score again and the game
ended in a tie.
The game was over and as the
band, dollies and this reporter
filed out; the majority of the
6000 fans who were to see the
Seals game started arriving.
Unfortunately 4500 of them had
missed an exciting and refreshing
break from the usual violence and
rigors of pro hockey.

Stanford continued their
offensive push and Paul Tittmann
took a breakaway pass from
Baldwin and tied it up with 9:38
left. Despite continuous efforts to
put the puck past Cal's
surferhaired goalie, the Indians
failed to score again and the game
ended in a tie.
The game was over and as the
band, dollies and this reporter
filed out; the majority of the
6000 fans who were to see the
Seals game started arriving.
Unfortunately 4500 of them had
missed an exciting and refreshing
break from the usual violence and
rigors of pro hockey.

In a preliminary game to
Saturday night's Oakland Seals -
Pittsburgh Penguins NHL game,
the Stanford Hockey Club tied
California 3-3. "The First Big
Game on Ice" may have lacked
the usual brawls and unruly fans
which characterize pro hockey,
but what NHL team ever had
between-period entertainment by
the Stanford band and dollies?
And how many professional teams
have players that require head
bands to keep their hair out of
their eyes?
The Cat team, adorned in no
less than six kinds of uniforms
and with at least five longhairs in
the lineup, looked as much like a
hockey team as the Peanuts gang.
But when the game finally started,
first impressions were betrayed.
Indians Co Ahead
The first period was dominated
by Stanford, but there was no
scoring until 5:23 remaining when
defenseman Pat Baldwin tallied
unassisted to give the Indians a
1-0 lead. The only excitement the
rest of the period was a double
penalty and near fight, but
non-violence prevailed and the
period ended with no further
scoring or fighting.
The Indians seems content to
sit on their lead, but Cal made
that impossible when they pushed
in three goals in a six minute
period to take a 3-1 lead with
4:35 left in the second period.
After a one minute break
necessitated by the approaching
NHL game, the teams returned to
the ice for the third period.
Finally Stanford started skating
like they can and cut the lead to
3-2 with 13:30 left on a
picture-perfect goal by Flip
Gianos and a beautiful pass from
Bob Kadlec.
Baldwin Ties It
Stanford continued their
offensive push and Paul Tittmann
took a breakaway pass from
Baldwin and tied it up with 9:38
left. Despite continuous efforts to
put the puck past Cal's
surferhaired goalie, the Indians
failed to score again and the game
ended in a tie.
The game was over and as the
band, dollies and this reporter
filed out; the majority of the
6000 fans who were to see the
Seals game started arriving.
Unfortunately 4500 of them had
missed an exciting and refreshing
break from the usual violence and
