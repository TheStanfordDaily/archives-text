# 'Needy Patients'
## Blood Drive Here 
### 
Cardinal's Board, in
conjunction with the Peninsula
Memorial Blood Bank, will be
holding a blood drive on campus
today.
Donors may designate that the
blood go towards any account
they please, but the drive requests
that if there is no preference the
blood be donated to the "Needy
Patients Fund." This is an account
which is available to individuals
who because of severe accident,
major surgery, or sickness need a
large amount of blood but cannot
afford its high replacement cost of
$25 a pint.
The drive's organizers are
hoping for a big response to this
appeal since all Stanford students
are already covered through a
well-endowed student account at
the Blood Bank.
The blood donations will be
taken at the Women's Clubhouse

next to the Old Union from 9
a.m. to 2 p.m. So as not to
overburden the facilities during
peak periods, there will be a
sign-up table near the Post Office
on Wednesday and Thursday, Feb.
18 and 19. Those people who are
interested in donating blood but
who did not sign up to do so on
reg day should sign up from 10
a.m. to 2 p.m. on those days.
