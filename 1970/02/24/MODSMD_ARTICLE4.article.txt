# Prof Helps End 'Frito Bandito'
## 
### CATHY COOPER 
The Frito Bandito is no
more —due to the efforts of Prof.
Thomas Martinez.
Martinez, director of
Mexican-American seminars and
lecturer in Sociology, initiated a
campaign against the TV
caricature which ended last week
when Pepsico, the parent
corporation of potato chip
manufacturer Frito-Lay, ordered a
halt to the Frito Bandito
commercials.
"The Frito Bandito promoted
racist thinking about Mexicans
and Mexican-Americans," asserted
Martinez. "Mexicans were
portrayed as sneaking and
thieving. Mexican-American
children were paying the price in
loss of self-esteem for the
Frito-Lay Corporation's successful
advertising.
"This is a great symbolic and
substantive victory for the
Chicano movement. It means we
can effectively influence the mass
media," Martinez said.
Start of Campaign
The effort to oust the Frito
Bandito from the nation's
airwaves began last Spring when
Martinez's students at San Jose

State investigated racism in
advertising. "I was surprised at the
frequency with which the Frito
Bandito was mentioned on
students' lists of racist
characterizations on TV," he
commented.
Martinez's response was an
article entitled "How Advertisers
Promote Racism" which appeared
in El Grito, a quarterly published
in Berkeley. Shortly afterwards
the National Mexican-American
Anti-Defamation Committee
adopted the article as its position
paper on advertising.
The campaign gained
momentum as Martinez
undertook a speaking tour of the
Southwest urging action against
the Frito Bandito and other such
advertisements. Ch icanos
responded enthusiastically to
Martinez's crusade, and the
advertising trade journal
Advertising Age also joined the
chorus of critics of the Frito
Bandito.
Commercial Ban
Two California TV stations,
KPIX in San Francisco and KNBC
in Los Angeles moved to ban the
Frito-Lay commercial two months
ago. Their action brought strong
pressure from national networks
to resume broadcasting the Frito
Bandito, claiming that he really
was not a public issue.
Martinez retaliated by
announcing at a press conference
that if the networks did not
withdraw the commercial that his
group would appeal to the FCC
for equal time to combat the
stereotype. "And we would have
won," Martinez said.
Frito-Lay's response to the
campaign was in Martinez's words
"arrogant." But last week the
manufacturer capitulated and
announced the demise of the
Frito Bandido. "We now have
legitimacy" said Martinez. "The
economic establishment
conceeded we were right.
Need For Scapegoats
"American society seems to
need scapegoats," he said. "It
consistently makes fun of poor
people. Stereotypes are used to
bolster the self esteem of WASPS.
Not only are advertisers exhibiting
racist thinking at the expense of
everyone of Mexican descent, but
they are also creating in many
cases unfavorable racial and
cultural stereotypes in minds that
previously did not harbor them.
To find nothing objectionable or
distasteful about advertising image
of Mexicans and Mexican-Ameri
cans suggest tacit agreement in the
image."
Martinez listed other
companies which promote
stereotypical and racist images of
Mexicans as General Motors,
Camel cigarettes, Arrid, Philco
Ford, Granny Goose, Ligget
Meyers, and Frigidaire.
"The victory over the Frito
Bandido removed a significant and
visible symbol of prejudice. Life is
now more meaningful," he smiled.

Martinez. "Mexicans were
portrayed as sneaking and
thieving. Mexican-American
children were paying the price in
loss of self-esteem for the
Frito-Lay Corporation's successful
advertising.
"This is a great symbolic and
substantive victory for the
Chicano movement. It means we
can effectively influence the mass
media," Martinez said.
Start of Campaign
The effort to oust the Frito
Bandito from the nation's
airwaves began last Spring when
Martinez's students at San Jose

State investigated racism in
advertising. "I was surprised at the
frequency with which the Frito
Bandito was mentioned on
students' lists of racist
characterizations on TV," he
commented.
Martinez's response was an
article entitled "How Advertisers
Promote Racism" which appeared
in El Grito, a quarterly published
in Berkeley. Shortly afterwards
the National Mexican-American
Anti-Defamation Committee
adopted the article as its position
paper on advertising.
The campaign gained
momentum as Martinez
undertook a speaking tour of the
Southwest urging action against
the Frito Bandito and other such
advertisements. Ch icanos
responded enthusiastically to
Martinez's crusade, and the
advertising trade journal
Advertising Age also joined the
chorus of critics of the Frito
Bandito.
Commercial Ban
Two California TV stations,
KPIX in San Francisco and KNBC
in Los Angeles moved to ban the
Frito-Lay commercial two months
ago. Their action brought strong
pressure from national networks
to resume broadcasting the Frito
Bandito, claiming that he really
was not a public issue.
Martinez retaliated by
announcing at a press conference
that if the networks did not
withdraw the commercial that his
group would appeal to the FCC
for equal time to combat the
stereotype. "And we would have
won," Martinez said.
Frito-Lay's response to the
campaign was in Martinez's words
"arrogant." But last week the
manufacturer capitulated and
announced the demise of the
Frito Bandido. "We now have
legitimacy" said Martinez. "The
economic establishment
conceeded we were right.
Need For Scapegoats
"American society seems to
need scapegoats," he said. "It
consistently makes fun of poor
people. Stereotypes are used to
bolster the self esteem of WASPS.
Not only are advertisers exhibiting
racist thinking at the expense of
everyone of Mexican descent, but
they are also creating in many
cases unfavorable racial and
cultural stereotypes in minds that
previously did not harbor them.
To find nothing objectionable or
distasteful about advertising image
of Mexicans and Mexican-Ameri
cans suggest tacit agreement in the
image."
Martinez listed other
companies which promote
stereotypical and racist images of
Mexicans as General Motors,
Camel cigarettes, Arrid, Philco
Ford, Granny Goose, Ligget
Meyers, and Frigidaire.
"The victory over the Frito
Bandido removed a significant and
visible symbol of prejudice. Life is
now more meaningful," he smiled.
The Frito Bandito is no
more —due to the efforts of Prof.
Thomas Martinez.
Martinez, director of
Mexican-American seminars and
lecturer in Sociology, initiated a
campaign against the TV
caricature which ended last week
when Pepsico, the parent
corporation of potato chip
manufacturer Frito-Lay, ordered a
halt to the Frito Bandito
commercials.
"The Frito Bandito promoted
racist thinking about Mexicans
and Mexican-Americans," asserted
Martinez. "Mexicans were
