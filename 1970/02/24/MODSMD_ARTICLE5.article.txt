# Yell Leader Voting To Begin Today
## 
### 
After a quarter's delay,
students will vote for head cheer
leader today through Thursday.
Elections were delayed from
the normal fall date due to the
absence of an election's
commissioner.
Head yell leader is normally
elected late during the footbail
season and serves a one-year term
of office. This year, however, the
election commissioner resigned
during fall quarter leaving no one
to organize the voting.
Jan Westfall, new election
commissioner, said that interim
yell leaders volunteered to serve
temporarily during basketball
season until new elections could
take place.

Wayne Leiser and Jim Gray are
serving as interim cheerleaders
since last year's yell leaders had
served their full year term and
wanted replacements. In a letter
to the Daily, Leiser said that the
interim yell leaders served "with
the understanding that if anyone
else also wanted to serve in this
capacity as interim yell leader, we
would have him take our place."
Leiser said that "the past yell
leaders were actually grateful that
someone had volunteered."
Candidates for permanent yell
leader are: the Young
Boozerâ€”Roger Wagar Team; Ken
Kraft; and the Wayne Leiser .'im
Gray-Paul Morse Team. Polling
places are listed on page H.
