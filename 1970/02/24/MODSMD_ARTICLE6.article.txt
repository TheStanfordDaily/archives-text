# Convocation Postponed As BSU Reconsiders
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
There will be no racism convocation - at least
for the time being.
After a weekend of student-administration and
student haggling over the organization of the
convocation, ASSU President Pat Shea considers it
"postponed indefinitely."
The Black Student Union's refusal to participate
in the event was a major factor in the decision.
BSU chairman Leo Bazile had introduced a
Student Senate resolution proposing the
convocation at last Thursday's meeting, but he
later became disillusioned by the administration's
refusal to cancel classes for the day, and by what
de describes as the University's attempt to
"co-opt" the conference. "They didn't care
enough to cancel classes," Bazile explains. "I could
even go along with that, but I was turned off when
the administration pushed the starting time back
from 1:00 to 3:30. I was constantly giving and I
wanted to know when the hell I was going to get
something."
Disillusionment At Friday Meeting
Bazile's disillusionment with the convocation
grew out of a Friday afternoon meeting with
University administrators and members of other
minority-student organizations.
At that meeting Dean of Students Peter
Bulkeley told Bazile that classes would not be
cancelled. Those at the meeting also wanted the
convocation to include representatives of other
minority student groups â€” MECIIA, (the Chicano
organization), the Asian-American Student
Alliance, and American Indians.
Baziel said that he listened to all of this but
walked out soon after Vice-Provost Robert
Rosenzweig entered the meeting.
"The black students do not talk to him," Bazile
said. "And, anyway, the University just came and
started organizing the convocation. They tried to
pull the wool over my eyes and that pissed me
off."
BSU Decision
The BSU decided not to participate at an
executive board meeting Sunday night. Bazile
proposed at that meeting that the BSU send letters
to the governor of Utah and the president of
Brigham Young University (BYU) criticizing
Stanford's actions, but the rest of the committee
voted him down.
The letters were intended to show that
Stanford's actions were hypocritical in light of last
quarter's decision by the University not to
compete with BYU because of their affiliation
with the Mormorn church. Mormon religion
excludes black priests.
Despite the actions of Bazile and the BSU
executive committee, ASSU President Pat Shea
continued organizational work for the
convocation. Sunday night he got to the point
where he needed help but could find none.
Shea explains, "There was just a lack of people
to organize it.
Different Emotional Response
"Since the Senate resolution, people have had

time in a different emotional atmosphere to
consider the role of the convocation. They think
the whole problem can best be dealt with in an
individual way," he says.
Shea, who wrote last Thursday's student Senate
resolution says he too has changed his opinion on
the usefulness of the event and how thinks
individual action is most effective.
"The ASSU is hopefully going to be able to
coordinate individual house seminars that deal
with racism on campus," Shea says. "These should
be educational."
The BSU also has its plans. Executive
committee member Channing Johnson forsees a
wholly BSU-controlled convocation.
Future BSU Convocation
"We do plan to have a convocation in the
future, on our own time," he says. "We hope this
will be when Pitzer's on campus and without the
white radicals. You know, the role of the white
radicals in this week's plans was part of the reason
we felt we should not participate. They had no
business in it."
Administration reaction to the weekend
developments was partly defensive, and partly
positive. Bulkeley said that the cancellation would
have no effect on the "variety of things we have in
the planning stages."
He said that he could not discuss what these
things were, however, because he was preparing to
propose them to the Human Relations Committee.
Nevertheless he did say, "The convocation was
potentially one part of a much larger effort. It
would have provided a background for the dorm
programs, but now that background will have to
be provided in other ways."
Recent Occurences
Bulkeley concluded, "When things are taking
place, like those that have occurred recently (the
Junipero incident) I am not willing to sit back and
allow it, convocation or not. Our actions will
continue."
Rosenzweig also commented on some of the
weekend's developments by explaining the
administration's justification for refusing to cancel
classes.
"The reasons are that we don't think cancelling
classes is the way to respond to this kind of
problem. This is terribly important, but there have
been various groups that have asked us to cancel
classes in the past, like the Moratorium and we
have not. Cancellation is simply inappropriate."
Contrary to last Friday's Daily article on the
student Senate, the resolution proposing a
convocation on racism did not ask for a
cancellation of classes.
Some members of the Senate were just as
surprised as our reporter to hear this. Senate
member John Schoch said last night, "I was under
the impression that the cancellation of classes was
in the Senate resolution. If it wasn't, it slipped by
a lot of senators."
Several statements by (BSU) chairman Leo
Bazile supporting cancellation of classes misled the
senators since he had introduced the resolution.
