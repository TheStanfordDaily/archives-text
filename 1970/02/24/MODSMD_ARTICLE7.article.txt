French President Georges
Pompidou and foreign minister
Maurice Schunun are planning a
90 minute visit to the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
on Friday, Feb. 27.
The French statesmen will
meet with SLAC Director W.K.H.

Panofsky and other SLAC
officials for a 30-minute
conference on the accelerator's
operation and related
developments in physics research.
Pompidou and Schuman will
also confer with Provost Richard
Lyman on the problems and
future of university education.
The French President will
arrive at SLAC from San
Francisco at 10:00 a.m. After a
brief tour of the "klystron
gallery" and the end station,
Pompidou will talk with
Panofsky, Provost Richard Lyman
and other officials.
According to Jack Sanders,
SLAC director of public
information, Panofsky will speak
about the funding of the
accelerator built and operated by
Stanford under contract with the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.
Furopean Accelerators
Professor Victor Weisakroph of
MIT will brief Pompidou during
his visit on the present trends of
European national accelerators.
Professor Weisskroph was
formerly the director of a
26-bill ion-volt accelerator in
Switzerland, which France shares
with 1 1 other countries.
To close the Friday session,
Provost Richard Lyman will give a

brief explanation of the American
university structure and decision
making processes with particular
reference to Stanford.
French universities are under
increasing pressure to decentralize
and are looking for a model in
American universities. "This is a
system they are really looking
into and we are presently having
trouble with," explained Lyman.
Scientific Installation
SLAC is the only scientific
installation the French President
will be visiting during his
week-long visit to the U.S.
France and six other European
countries are planning to build
jointly a 300-billion-volt circular
accelerator. It is believed that the
U.S. government will assist in
financing the project.
Pompidou is scheduled to visit
SLAC for an hour and a half. He
will then return to San Francisco
to speak at a luncheon of the
