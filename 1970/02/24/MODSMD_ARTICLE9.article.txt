Unattributcd Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the Friday, February 20th
issue of the DAILY, Miss Tina
Cooper wrote that the Dean of
Students' response to a request
for protection for the girls in
Junipero was that this
necessitated calling in the county
sheriff, which would mean
"repression on the campus." This
statement attributed to the Dean
of Students was not made by me,
nor do I know who, if anyone, did
make it.
I would like to make clear to
the entire Stanford community
my concern for the welfare and
safety of all Stanford students. I
condemn the events which took
place in Junipero as repugnant,
and I am outraged at their
occurence on this campus. As
soon as the incidents were
brought to the attention of the
Dean of Students' office
university security personnel were
alerted and we initiated an effort
to determine who the parties
responsible were; and this
investigation is continuing,
although there is little actual
evidence upon which to proceed.
At the same time, as has been
reported in the DAILY, alternate
housing has been provided thegirls.

Dean of Students
White Is Right?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent incident of
swastikas painted on the door of
two black girls and of the note
left under the door are not
examples only of some extreme
mind at work. I do not think we
should write this incident off as
"something inconsiderate people
do."
As white people, we have been
brought up in a society in which
white is so right that we can't see
any other color. The other day I
was listing the colors of the beads
in the necklace my small nephew
had on. Without thinking I said,
"I see green beads, blue beads,
flesh color beads. . ." As soon as I
said flesh colored I realized that I
was talking about my flesh color.
The beads were not the color of a
brown or black person's flesh.
In a discussion with two
students about the note left under
a black girl's door, one of the
students asked if the girl who
received the note was in the
Minority Task Force program.
When I questioned her about what
difference knowing that would
make in her evaluation of the
incident, she admitted that some
unconscious judgment of the
quality of people in the Task
Force program might be operating
in her.
I understand that Chicano
students are asked to room with a
non-Chicano roommate when
they first come to Stanford. This
is a subtle way of whites saying,
we know what is best for you, it is
best for you to relate to white
people.
I have been keeping my ears
open for the very subtle things I
and others say which may indicate
racist attitudes. Other whites who
consider themselves "liberal"

might do the same. We might
better understand the anger and
impatience of those who feel the
pain of these subtle remarks. In
fact, we might start getting angry
ourselves.
When we begin to see how
these ideas of white dominance
and superiority are built into our
educational system we will begin
to see the colossal task before us
as whites. Racism comes not only
in the blatant forms the swastikas
indicate, nor only in the covert
forms indicated above, it also
comes in institutional forms
(Institutional Racism, the new
book by Prewitt and Knowles,
documents this well). As whites
we need to be about the business
of digging into our own subtle
prejudices and radically changing
the power arrangements in our
institutions.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Tow questions in re the latest
atrocity against the Black nation:
(1) Exactly what was written
on the literature on the girls'
door, and in what context? Is it
true that it was only the common
derogatory inscription of "SDS"
in which the S's are converted to
swastikas? If so, the signification
of the symbols seems to me to
have been very different from the
sort of thing imputed in all the
nasty talk in and around Friday's
Daily. What had the girls put on
their door? Surely graffiti on
posted political literature is not so
unusual around here?
(2) Paraphrasing Leo Bazile: I
want to ask the world why the
ASSU Senate can be so quick to
act on racist quirks and so slow to
act on wholesale mob thuggery.
At worst, the action at Junipero
seems to be an expression of the
perverse sense of humor of some
moronic racist. Yet last quarter a
group of conservative activists
who were trying to protect an
Arena photographer near the G.E.
picketing were set upon and
beaten by what can only be
described as a vicious mob of
Stanford students and high
schoolers who were eagerly egged
on by a large number of
surrounding ASSU citizens. This
latter incident is without a doubt
the grossest abuse of civil and
human rights that I have
witnessed at Stanford in four
years. But where was the outcry?
Where the call for investigations
or convocations or even collective
contrition? Ho-hum, said the
Daily editor, "it hardly qualifies
as an event worth recording."
Stanford lurches on.
By the way, thanks lor Kriday's
editorial. The words were mostly
sensitive and insightful. . .& sorely
needed.
Mike Wolf
Dictator
Editor, THE DAILY:
Much to my surprise, I have
recently learned through several
articles in the Stanford Daily that
for almost ten years I had been
working under a dictator named

Walker without even realizing my
sorry plight.
I plead extenuating
circumstances: indeed, ever since I
accepted the position of Director
of Stanford-in-France, the wolf
must have been acting in the guise
of a lamb.
The only time I can remember
he ever questioned a suggestion
made by the local administration,
was when I came out with the
bright idea of buying a coffee
machine which, once I had
persuaded the owner of the next
door cafe to buy it himself,
proved to make the worst kind of
beverage that was ever given a
human palate to taste. Apart
from that one example, all other
ideas concerning the creation of
new courses, or the cancellation
of obsolete regulations, etc. etc. . .
have always been carefully
studied, discussed and finally
accepted.
I do hope that Mr. Askinas and
his friends, after denouncing in
this brilliant manner the evils of
the world we live in, are now
going to give the mentally
underdeveloped Directors of the
Overseas Campuses a few
elementary lessons in democratic
principles.
Sincerely Yours,

Morality or Hypocrisy ?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent Israeli air strike
against civilian targets in Egypt
with the resulting loss of many
lives (about 70 dead and 90
wounded, using Napalm,
delay-action bombs, etc.) is
another one of those abhorrent
Israeli "spectaculars" aimed
against the Arab people. As an
atrocity it stands well placed in
Israeli's record
In magnitude, such acts would
hardly compare with the master
act of building a state for
immigrant Zionists, to the
exclusion of the indiginous people
of the land, namely the
Palestinians. The recent atrocity is
hardly a match to the further
expansion into Arab land and the
continuous suffering of those
people who are under military
occupation in Gaza, the west
bank, the Golan Heights and
Sinai, let alone the two million
Palestinian refugees since 1948.
At this moment of this last
"spectacular" the American
government would deplore the
viscious act. Yet in its consent to
supply more of the weapons of
destruction (Phantom and
Skyhawk jets) to Israel, it is still
continuing its support to those
master acts that led to the
homelessness of an entire people.
Such an attitude makes us
wonder, "At what level does
morality operate in the American
government?" Does it operate
only at the level of isolated or
spectacular incidents and is it
completely absent when it comes
to major decisions? Is this the
attitude of a government
interested in peaceful and just
resolutions of conflicts?

To whom it may concern, it is
abundantly clear that military and
violent pressures by Israel against
the Arabs will lead only to further
resistance and escalation of the
conflict. It is amazing that even
those who vehemently support
the Zionist state do not see the
profound dangers of Israel's
militancy.
In spite of the crucial lesson of
Vietnam, the American
government is still willing to listen
to the militant voice of Israel
which can lead only to more
violence and escalation of the
conflict. It is the time for a major
reconsideration and revision of
American's attitude in the Middle
East conflict.
One thing is clear: listening to
the voice of Isreal in the past
brought only violence and never
peace in spite of constant talk
about the latter.

beaten by what can only be
described as a vicious mob of

the grossest abuse of civil and

Mike Wolf
Dictator
Editor, THE DAILY:
Much to my surprise, I have
recently learned through several
articles in the Stanford Daily that
for almost ten years I had been
working under a dictator named

Walker without even realizing my
sorry plight.
I plead extenuating
circumstances: indeed, ever since I
accepted the position of Director
of Stanford-in-France, the wolf
must have been acting in the guise
of a lamb.
The only time I can remember
he ever questioned a suggestion
made by the local administration,
was when I came out with the
bright idea of buying a coffee
machine which, once I had
persuaded the owner of the next
door cafe to buy it himself,
proved to make the worst kind of
beverage that was ever given a
human palate to taste. Apart
from that one example, all other
ideas concerning the creation of
new courses, or the cancellation
of obsolete regulations, etc. etc. . .
have always been carefully
studied, discussed and finally
accepted.
I do hope that Mr. Askinas and
his friends, after denouncing in
this brilliant manner the evils of
the world we live in, are now
going to give the mentally
underdeveloped Directors of the
Overseas Campuses a few
elementary lessons in democratic
principles.
Sincerely Yours,

Morality or Hypocrisy ?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent Israeli air strike
against civilian targets in Egypt
with the resulting loss of many
lives (about 70 dead and 90
wounded, using Napalm,
delay-action bombs, etc.) is
another one of those abhorrent
Israeli "spectaculars" aimed
against the Arab people. As an
atrocity it stands well placed in
Israeli's record
In magnitude, such acts would
hardly compare with the master
act of building a state for
immigrant Zionists, to the
exclusion of the indiginous people
of the land, namely the
Palestinians. The recent atrocity is
hardly a match to the further
expansion into Arab land and the
continuous suffering of those
people who are under military
occupation in Gaza, the west
bank, the Golan Heights and
Sinai, let alone the two million
Palestinian refugees since 1948.
At this moment of this last
"spectacular" the American
government would deplore the
viscious act. Yet in its consent to
supply more of the weapons of
destruction (Phantom and
Skyhawk jets) to Israel, it is still
continuing its support to those
master acts that led to the
homelessness of an entire people.
Such an attitude makes us
wonder, "At what level does
morality operate in the American
government?" Does it operate
only at the level of isolated or
spectacular incidents and is it
completely absent when it comes
to major decisions? Is this the
attitude of a government
interested in peaceful and just
resolutions of conflicts?

To whom it may concern, it is
abundantly clear that military and
violent pressures by Israel against
the Arabs will lead only to further
resistance and escalation of the
conflict. It is amazing that even
those who vehemently support
the Zionist state do not see the
profound dangers of Israel's
militancy.
In spite of the crucial lesson of
Vietnam, the American
government is still willing to listen
to the militant voice of Israel
which can lead only to more
violence and escalation of the
conflict. It is the time for a major
reconsideration and revision of
American's attitude in the Middle
East conflict.
One thing is clear: listening to
the voice of Isreal in the past
brought only violence and never
peace in spite of constant talk
about the latter.

Unattributcd Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the Friday, February 20th
issue of the DAILY, Miss Tina
Cooper wrote that the Dean of
Students' response to a request
for protection for the girls in
Junipero was that this
necessitated calling in the county
sheriff, which would mean
"repression on the campus." This
statement attributed to the Dean
of Students was not made by me,
nor do I know who, if anyone, did
make it.
I would like to make clear to
the entire Stanford community
my concern for the welfare and
safety of all Stanford students. I
condemn the events which took
place in Junipero as repugnant,
and I am outraged at their
occurence on this campus. As
soon as the incidents were
brought to the attention of the
Dean of Students' office
university security personnel were
alerted and we initiated an effort
to determine who the parties
responsible were; and this
investigation is continuing,
although there is little actual
evidence upon which to proceed.
At the same time, as has been
reported in the DAILY, alternate
housing has been provided thegirls.
Peter Z. Bulkeley
Dean of Students
White Is Right?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent incident of
swastikas painted on the door of
two black girls and of the note
left under the door are not
examples only of some extreme
mind at work. I do not think we
should write this incident off as
"something inconsiderate people
do."
As white people, we have been
brought up in a society in which
white is so right that we can't see
any other color. The other day I
was listing the colors of the beads
in the necklace my small nephew
had on. Without thinking I said,
"I see green beads, blue beads,
flesh color beads. . ." As soon as I
said flesh colored I realized that I
was talking about my flesh color.
The beads were not the color of a
brown or black person's flesh.
In a discussion with two
students about the note left under
a black girl's door, one of the
students asked if the girl who
received the note was in the
Minority Task Force program.
When I questioned her about what
difference knowing that would
make in her evaluation of the
incident, she admitted that some
unconscious judgment of the
quality of people in the Task
Force program might be operating
in her.
I understand that Chicano
students are asked to room with a
non-Chicano roommate when
they first come to Stanford. This
is a subtle way of whites saying,
we know what is best for you, it is
best for you to relate to white
people.
I have been keeping my ears
open for the very subtle things I
and others say which may indicate
racist attitudes. Other whites who
consider themselves "liberal"

might do the same. We might
better understand the anger and
impatience of those who feel the
pain of these subtle remarks. In
fact, we might start getting angry
ourselves.
When we begin to see how
these ideas of white dominance
and superiority are built into our
educational system we will begin
to see the colossal task before us
as whites. Racism comes not only
in the blatant forms the swastikas
indicate, nor only in the covert
forms indicated above, it also
comes in institutional forms
(Institutional Racism, the new
book by Prewitt and Knowles,
documents this well). As whites
we need to be about the business
of digging into our own subtle
prejudices and radically changing
the power arrangements in our
institutions.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Tow questions in re the latest
atrocity against the Black nation:
(1) Exactly what was written
on the literature on the girls'
door, and in what context? Is it
true that it was only the common
derogatory inscription of "SDS"
in which the S's are converted to
swastikas? If so, the signification
of the symbols seems to me to
have been very different from the
sort of thing imputed in all the
nasty talk in and around Friday's

their door? Surely graffiti on
posted political literature is not so
unusual around here?
(2) Paraphrasing Leo Bazile: I
want to ask the world why the
ASSU Senate can be so quick to
act on racist quirks and so slow to
act on wholesale mob thuggery.

Unattributcd Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the Friday, February 20th
issue of the DAILY, Miss Tina
Cooper wrote that the Dean of
Students' response to a request
for protection for the girls in
Junipero was that this
necessitated calling in the county
sheriff, which would mean
"repression on the campus." This
statement attributed to the Dean
of Students was not made by me,
nor do I know who, if anyone, did
make it.
I would like to make clear to
the entire Stanford community
my concern for the welfare and
safety of all Stanford students. I
condemn the events which took
place in Junipero as repugnant,
and I am outraged at their
occurence on this campus. As
soon as the incidents were
brought to the attention of the
Dean of Students' office
university security personnel were
alerted and we initiated an effort
to determine who the parties
responsible were; and this
investigation is continuing,
although there is little actual
evidence upon which to proceed.
At the same time, as has been
reported in the DAILY, alternate
housing has been provided thegirls.
Peter Z. Bulkeley

White Is Right?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent incident of
swastikas painted on the door of
two black girls and of the note
left under the door are not
examples only of some extreme
mind at work. I do not think we
should write this incident off as
"something inconsiderate people
do."
As white people, we have been
brought up in a society in which
white is so right that we can't see
any other color. The other day I
was listing the colors of the beads
in the necklace my small nephew
had on. Without thinking I said,
"I see green beads, blue beads,
flesh color beads. . ." As soon as I
said flesh colored I realized that I
was talking about my flesh color.
The beads were not the color of a
brown or black person's flesh.
In a discussion with two
students about the note left under
a black girl's door, one of the
students asked if the girl who
received the note was in the
Minority Task Force program.
When I questioned her about what
difference knowing that would
make in her evaluation of the
incident, she admitted that some
unconscious judgment of the
quality of people in the Task
Force program might be operating
in her.
I understand that Chicano
students are asked to room with a
non-Chicano roommate when
they first come to Stanford. This
is a subtle way of whites saying,
we know what is best for you, it is
best for you to relate to white
people.
I have been keeping my ears
open for the very subtle things I
and others say which may indicate
racist attitudes. Other whites who
consider themselves "liberal"

might do the same. We might
better understand the anger and
impatience of those who feel the
pain of these subtle remarks. In
fact, we might start getting angry
ourselves.
When we begin to see how
these ideas of white dominance
and superiority are built into our
educational system we will begin
to see the colossal task before us
as whites. Racism comes not only
in the blatant forms the swastikas
indicate, nor only in the covert
forms indicated above, it also
comes in institutional forms
(Institutional Racism, the new
book by Prewitt and Knowles,
documents this well). As whites
we need to be about the business
of digging into our own subtle
prejudices and radically changing
the power arrangements in our
institutions.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Tow questions in re the latest
atrocity against the Black nation:
(1) Exactly what was written
on the literature on the girls'
door, and in what context? Is it
true that it was only the common
derogatory inscription of "SDS"
in which the S's are converted to
swastikas? If so, the signification
of the symbols seems to me to
have been very different from the
sort of thing imputed in all the
nasty talk in and around Friday's
Daily. What had the girls put on
their door? Surely graffiti on
posted political literature is not so
unusual around here?
(2) Paraphrasing Leo Bazile: I
want to ask the world why the
ASSU Senate can be so quick to
act on racist quirks and so slow to
act on wholesale mob thuggery.
At worst, the action at Junipero
seems to be an expression of the
perverse sense of humor of some
moronic racist. Yet last quarter a
group of conservative activists
who were trying to protect an
Arena photographer near the G.E.
picketing were set upon and
beaten by what can only be
described as a vicious mob of
Stanford students and high
schoolers who were eagerly egged
on by a large number of
surrounding ASSU citizens. This
latter incident is without a doubt
the grossest abuse of civil and
human rights that I have
witnessed at Stanford in four
years. But where was the outcry?
Where the call for investigations
or convocations or even collective
contrition? Ho-hum, said the
Daily editor, "it hardly qualifies
as an event worth recording."
Stanford lurches on.
By the way, thanks lor Kriday's

sensitive and insightful. . .& sorely

Mike Wolf
Dictator
Editor, THE DAILY:
Much to my surprise, I have
recently learned through several
articles in the Stanford Daily that
for almost ten years I had been
working under a dictator named

Walker without even realizing my
sorry plight.
I plead extenuating
circumstances: indeed, ever since I
accepted the position of Director
of Stanford-in-France, the wolf
must have been acting in the guise
of a lamb.
The only time I can remember
he ever questioned a suggestion
made by the local administration,
was when I came out with the
bright idea of buying a coffee
machine which, once I had
persuaded the owner of the next
door cafe to buy it himself,
proved to make the worst kind of
beverage that was ever given a
human palate to taste. Apart
from that one example, all other
ideas concerning the creation of
new courses, or the cancellation
of obsolete regulations, etc. etc. . .
have always been carefully
studied, discussed and finally
accepted.
I do hope that Mr. Askinas and
his friends, after denouncing in
this brilliant manner the evils of
the world we live in, are now
going to give the mentally
underdeveloped Directors of the
Overseas Campuses a few
elementary lessons in democratic
principles.

Morality or Hypocrisy ?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent Israeli air strike
against civilian targets in Egypt
with the resulting loss of many
lives (about 70 dead and 90
wounded, using Napalm,
delay-action bombs, etc.) is
another one of those abhorrent
Israeli "spectaculars" aimed
against the Arab people. As an
atrocity it stands well placed in
Israeli's record
In magnitude, such acts would
hardly compare with the master
act of building a state for
immigrant Zionists, to the
exclusion of the indiginous people
of the land, namely the
Palestinians. The recent atrocity is
hardly a match to the further
expansion into Arab land and the
continuous suffering of those
people who are under military
occupation in Gaza, the west
bank, the Golan Heights and
Sinai, let alone the two million
Palestinian refugees since 1948.
At this moment of this last
"spectacular" the American
government would deplore the
viscious act. Yet in its consent to
supply more of the weapons of
destruction (Phantom and
Skyhawk jets) to Israel, it is still
continuing its support to those
master acts that led to the
homelessness of an entire people.
Such an attitude makes us
wonder, "At what level does
morality operate in the American
government?" Does it operate
only at the level of isolated or
spectacular incidents and is it
completely absent when it comes
to major decisions? Is this the
attitude of a government
interested in peaceful and just
resolutions of conflicts?

To whom it may concern, it is
abundantly clear that military and
violent pressures by Israel against
the Arabs will lead only to further
resistance and escalation of the
conflict. It is amazing that even
those who vehemently support
the Zionist state do not see the
profound dangers of Israel's
militancy.
In spite of the crucial lesson of
Vietnam, the American
government is still willing to listen
to the militant voice of Israel
which can lead only to more
violence and escalation of the
conflict. It is the time for a major
reconsideration and revision of
American's attitude in the Middle
East conflict.
One thing is clear: listening to
the voice of Isreal in the past
brought only violence and never
peace in spite of constant talk

Mike Wolf
Dictator
Editor, THE DAILY:
Much to my surprise, I have
recently learned through several
articles in the Stanford Daily that
for almost ten years I had been
working under a dictator named

Walker without even realizing my
sorry plight.
I plead extenuating
circumstances: indeed, ever since I
accepted the position of Director
of Stanford-in-France, the wolf
must have been acting in the guise
of a lamb.
The only time I can remember
he ever questioned a suggestion
made by the local administration,
was when I came out with the
bright idea of buying a coffee
machine which, once I had
persuaded the owner of the next
door cafe to buy it himself,
proved to make the worst kind of
beverage that was ever given a
human palate to taste. Apart
from that one example, all other
ideas concerning the creation of
new courses, or the cancellation
of obsolete regulations, etc. etc. . .
have always been carefully
studied, discussed and finally
accepted.
I do hope that Mr. Askinas and
his friends, after denouncing in
this brilliant manner the evils of
the world we live in, are now
going to give the mentally
underdeveloped Directors of the
Overseas Campuses a few
elementary lessons in democratic
principles.

Morality or Hypocrisy ?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent Israeli air strike
against civilian targets in Egypt
with the resulting loss of many
lives (about 70 dead and 90
wounded, using Napalm,
delay-action bombs, etc.) is
another one of those abhorrent
Israeli "spectaculars" aimed
against the Arab people. As an
atrocity it stands well placed in
Israeli's record
In magnitude, such acts would
hardly compare with the master
act of building a state for
immigrant Zionists, to the
exclusion of the indiginous people
of the land, namely the
Palestinians. The recent atrocity is
hardly a match to the further
expansion into Arab land and the
continuous suffering of those
people who are under military
occupation in Gaza, the west
bank, the Golan Heights and
Sinai, let alone the two million
Palestinian refugees since 1948.
At this moment of this last
"spectacular" the American
government would deplore the
viscious act. Yet in its consent to
supply more of the weapons of
destruction (Phantom and
Skyhawk jets) to Israel, it is still
continuing its support to those
master acts that led to the
homelessness of an entire people.
Such an attitude makes us
wonder, "At what level does
morality operate in the American
government?" Does it operate
only at the level of isolated or
spectacular incidents and is it
completely absent when it comes
to major decisions? Is this the
attitude of a government
interested in peaceful and just
resolutions of conflicts?

To whom it may concern, it is
abundantly clear that military and
violent pressures by Israel against
the Arabs will lead only to further
resistance and escalation of the
conflict. It is amazing that even
those who vehemently support
the Zionist state do not see the
profound dangers of Israel's
militancy.
In spite of the crucial lesson of
Vietnam, the American
government is still willing to listen
to the militant voice of Israel
which can lead only to more
violence and escalation of the
conflict. It is the time for a major
reconsideration and revision of
American's attitude in the Middle
East conflict.
One thing is clear: listening to
the voice of Isreal in the past
brought only violence and never
peace in spite of constant talk
about the latter.

Unattributcd Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the Friday, February 20th
issue of the DAILY, Miss Tina
Cooper wrote that the Dean of
Students' response to a request
for protection for the girls in
Junipero was that this
necessitated calling in the county
sheriff, which would mean
"repression on the campus." This
statement attributed to the Dean
of Students was not made by me,
nor do I know who, if anyone, did
make it.
I would like to make clear to
the entire Stanford community
my concern for the welfare and
safety of all Stanford students. I
condemn the events which took
place in Junipero as repugnant,
and I am outraged at their
occurence on this campus. As
soon as the incidents were
brought to the attention of the
Dean of Students' office
university security personnel were
alerted and we initiated an effort
to determine who the parties
responsible were; and this
investigation is continuing,
although there is little actual
evidence upon which to proceed.
At the same time, as has been
reported in the DAILY, alternate
housing has been provided thegirls.
Peter Z. Bulkeley
Dean of Students
White Is Right?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent incident of
swastikas painted on the door of
two black girls and of the note
left under the door are not
examples only of some extreme
mind at work. I do not think we
should write this incident off as
"something inconsiderate people
do."
As white people, we have been
brought up in a society in which
white is so right that we can't see
any other color. The other day I
was listing the colors of the beads
in the necklace my small nephew
had on. Without thinking I said,
"I see green beads, blue beads,
flesh color beads. . ." As soon as I
said flesh colored I realized that I
was talking about my flesh color.
The beads were not the color of a
brown or black person's flesh.
In a discussion with two
students about the note left under
a black girl's door, one of the
students asked if the girl who
received the note was in the
Minority Task Force program.
When I questioned her about what
difference knowing that would
make in her evaluation of the
incident, she admitted that some
unconscious judgment of the
quality of people in the Task
Force program might be operating
in her.
I understand that Chicano
students are asked to room with a
non-Chicano roommate when
they first come to Stanford. This
is a subtle way of whites saying,
we know what is best for you, it is
best for you to relate to white
people.
I have been keeping my ears
open for the very subtle things I
and others say which may indicate
racist attitudes. Other whites who
consider themselves "liberal"

might do the same. We might
better understand the anger and
impatience of those who feel the
pain of these subtle remarks. In
fact, we might start getting angry
ourselves.
When we begin to see how
these ideas of white dominance
and superiority are built into our
educational system we will begin
to see the colossal task before us
as whites. Racism comes not only
in the blatant forms the swastikas
indicate, nor only in the covert
forms indicated above, it also
comes in institutional forms
(Institutional Racism, the new
book by Prewitt and Knowles,
documents this well). As whites
we need to be about the business
of digging into our own subtle
prejudices and radically changing
the power arrangements in our
institutions.

Tow questions in re the latest
atrocity against the Black nation:
(1) Exactly what was written
on the literature on the girls'

true that it was only the common
derogatory inscription of "SDS"
in which the S's are converted to
swastikas? If so, the signification
of the symbols seems to me to
have been very different from the
sort of thing imputed in all the
nasty talk in and around Friday's

their door? Surely graffiti on

violence and escalation of the
conflict. It is the time for a major
reconsideration and revision of
American's attitude in the Middle
East conflict.
One thing is clear: listening to
the voice of Isreal in the past
brought only violence and never
peace in spite of constant talk
about the latter.
