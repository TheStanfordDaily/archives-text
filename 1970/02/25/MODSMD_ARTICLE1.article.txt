# Midyear Changes Pose Coed Housing Problem
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Finding a vociferous critic on the Stanford
campus of co-educational housing is probably
about as easy as scouring the country to discover
opponents of motherhood and ecology.
The proliferation of co-ed dorms and
fraternities since their tentative, experimental start
four years ago, has been a unique phenomenon in
at least one respect - the wishes of the University
administration and the students ran along a
roughly parallel course.
Careful, considerate and deliberate action had,
until a short while ago, been the earmark of the
co-eding of residences But now there seems to be
some feeling, since the seemingly hasty change

Paloma, has provided an excellent example of how
well students can handle this situation with its
subtle nuances and implications.
Some people are inevitably pressured into
acquiescing to the will of the majority, however,
and these students have as many rights to want to
retain a residence in its original form as do those
who want to change it.
Possible Plan
To accomodate those students who might "want
a change, as well as those who probably won't, the
University could organize four freshman
residences, perhaps one set in of two in Florence
Moore and one in Stern, which were set up on the
basis that they would be single-sex throughout Fall
Quarter, and at the end of the quarter the
residents would have the option of voting on
whether to go co-ed or not. This situation would
add the missing factor in a freshman'S choice of a
dorm. - the experience of living at Stanford.
Such an arrangement would legitimize the type
of changeover which Loro and Paloma worked
effectively this quarter. As a Loro resident put it
then, "When I came where, I thought I wanted a
single sex dorm. But not I realize I'd happy in a
co-ed dorm." If such a mechanism were set up, it
would be possible, for the University to give the
freshman the chance to change his mind.
Coeding a fraternity is, however, a very
different matter. Perhaps the most basic difference
is that when a student joins to a fraternity, he is
applying for admittance in a group of people, and
does not primarily consider the configuration of
that group.
Fraternity's Choice
If, then, those who have voluntarily committed
themselves to one another, decide that they would
like to either go completely co-ed or else take in
co-eds as boarders, that decision is to a large
extent the fraternity's, and not the University's.
Nevertheless, in the case of coeding a fraternity,
the University has been absolved of one of its
primary responsibilities: that of protecting the
present occupants of the residence. Members of a
fraternity have bound themselves to the people,
not to the configuration of the residence.
Difficulties
Manifold difficulties do present themselves to a
fraternity wishing to admit co-ed boarders, as the
Phi Gamma Delta house found out this quarter.
After requesting and being refused permission to
go coed last Spring, they moved coed boarders
into the house without informing the University.
That this situation was badly handled should
not, however, serve to deter any fraternities who
wish to coed in the future - at the beginning of the
year or in mid-year.
Mid-year coeding is indeed tricky. Residents
have some right to security once they have chosen
a residence. But in dorms, it is possible to produce
a housing mechanism that allows freshmen latitude
for experimentation. And with frats, the most
essential criteria for deciding whether or not to go
coed is not the time of year, but the fairness of the
system for admitting new residents.
