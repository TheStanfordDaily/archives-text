# ROTC: The Issue Is Vietnam
## 
### Michael Sweeney 
Today, B-52 bombers will drop
hundreds of tons of bombs on
Southeast disturbing people,
villages, and crops. The monsoon
rains will turn the bomb craters
into stagnant ponds that will
spread disease throughout the
battered countryside.
As you read your morning
Daily, U.S. troops will unhmber
their 105 mm howitzers and send a
random scattering of shells into
the hostile "free-fire zones"
outside their barbed wire fences.
Perhaps as you lift the next
spoonful of cereal to your mouth,
an unlucky Vietnamese peasant
will be torn to pieces by shrapnel
from the exploding shells.
While systematic genocide goes
on today in Southeast Asia,
systematic U.S. oppression will
affect the lives of hundreds of
millions of people elsewhere in
the world. In Guatemala, the
oppression will take the form of
the economic stranglehold of U.S.
corporations on the native
economy. In Detroit, oppression
will be mainfested by heavily
armed white police patrolling a
black ghetto.
Everywhere, the oppression will
be enforced by the actual
presence or threat of the U.S.
military, a collosal machine
maintaining an armed strength of
three million men. When U.S.
economic or political interests are

threatened, the military
intervenes: Lebanon in 1958;
Cuba in 1960; Laos in 1962;
Vietnam in 1964; Santo Domingo
in 1965; the ghettos of the home
country in 1967 and 1968.
Today's Biggest News
The great single cause of human
misery in the world today is the
U.S. military and the oppression it
supports. Today's biggest
news—and tomorrow's—is that the
war continues, the genocide
continues, the oppression
continues.
I cannot separate my view of
my own life from the
overwhelming reality of U.S.
imperialism. There is a simple
dichotomy: I am supporting the
military or I am opposing it; I an
taking the side of the oppressors
or the side of the oppressed.
Neutrality is an illusion. A passive
acceptance of the Status quo is
support for the status quo of
oppression. Compromise with the
Department of Defense is support
for the Department of Defense.
The same choice confronts
Stanford University as a
community of students, faculty
and workers. The institution has
no better claim to neutrality than
the individual, and all individuals
bear a responsibility for their
behavior as members of
institutions. That precedent was
established at Nuremberg.

The ROTC controversy has
drawn the lines fairly clearly at
Stanford. Unlike the research
controversy of last spring, it takes
no mental leap whatsoever to
connect ROTC with oppression
and genocide. The military is right
here on campus, training officers
for the Army, Navy and Air
Force. Support for ROTC is
support for the worldwide
activities of the U.S. military,
which depend on a large and
steady supply of officers that only
ROTC can provide.
Just So Much Horseshit
The complicated debate over
academic credit, faculty review of
ROTC courses, and punitive
clauses is just so much horseshit.
If there were no war in Vietnam,
none of these aspects of ROTC
would be called into question.
Academic credit for military
training is certainly obscene, and
the punitive clause in ROTC
student contracts does constitute
the only involuntary servitude at
Stanford. But to criticize ROTC

on these grounds is to imply that
ROTC would somehow be
acceptable if the proper reforms
were made.
In Friday's Daily for instance,
law professor Thomas Ehrlich
criticized the punitive clause
because "the military's purpose
could be achieved without this
kind of sledge hammer
arrangement." Ehrlich seems to be
saying that the military's purposes
are acceptable to him. The
Pentagon can use its "sledge
hammer" on the Vietnamese, but
not on the privileged students of
Stanford University.
While the faculty has been
tying itself up in hypocritical
knots, the radical community has
consistently tried to define the
issue in terms of ROTC's
contribution to U.S. imperialism.
It has been difficult to persuade
some students that we regard
ROTC as an intrinsicaly important
issue, and not just as a convenient
focal point for radical agitation.
Fortunately, the Stanford
administration has described the
importance of ROTC quite
forcefully. The March 19, 1969,
issue of Campus Report contained
an interview with Vice Provost
Howard Brooks which is well
worth quoting at length:
"Brooks notes that faculty
groups at Harvard, Princeton,
and Yale—among others—have
voted to deny ROTC credit,
and the Department of Defense
is facing the reality of the
'domino theory.' He states that
although ROTC programs at
Stanford and Ivy League
schools are expensive, they
represent prestige value.
'Already there are stirrings of
opposition to ROTC at state
institutions,' Brooks explains,
'and if the prestige schools
drop the programs, the schools
well could follow suit.'
'Fine Quality Officers'
"Brooks, who has been in
frequent consultation with
national military and civilian
DOD leaders recently, says that
the officers that are turned out
by these very prestige
universities are of very fine
quality.' Therefore, the services
are anxious to retain ROTC on
college and university
campuses. The logic of this

sentiment is evident when it is
considered that approximately
20,000 new army second
lieutenants are required each
year.
"The vice provost interprets
the DOD attitude as one
seeking to remove as many
bases of academic criticisms as
possible."
As Brooks predicted, the
Defense Department has started a
counter-offensive to defend
ROTC. Stanford appears to be a
crucial battleground; it is the first
elite school where an attempt is
being made to reverse a faculty
decision that would have crippled
the program.
The Army plan that Pitzer has
pushed down the faculty's throats
does indeed remove what Brooks
calls "academic criticisms." Most
of the ROTC classwork will be
shifted to regular courses in other
departments. The remaining
military courses will be given
scrutiny on academic grounds
from the faculty-student
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. If this plan can be
instituted at Stanford, the
Defense Department clearly hopes
to use it to preserve ROTC
wherever it is attacked on the
sham issue of the academic credit.
A Test Case
There is good reason to believe
that the Defense Department has
deliberately made Stanford a "test
case" on ROTC. Deputy Secretary
of Defense David Packard, a
former Stanford trustee, has very
strong influence on the present
Board of Trustees. Vice Provost
Brooks, who is the
administration's ROTC expert,
served the same role for the
Defense Department last year as a
member of a special DOD
advisory group on ROTC. His
advisory group recommended
"reforms" in ROTC which closely
match what Pitzer is not trying to
institute at Stanford. When Pitzer
speaks on ROTC, it's the Defense
Department that's talking.
So the fate of Stanford ROTC
has a double significance.
Stanford ROTC provides 100 new
officers a year for the U.S. war
machine. It also constitutes a
possible turning point in the
struggle over the presence of the
military on campuses throughout

the nation. The Defense
Department anticipates an
important victory, but it could
well backfire completely. If we
can eliminate ROTC from
Stanford a powerful additional
impetus could be given to the
anti-ROTC movement across the
nation.
The importance of ROTC to
the war in Southeast Asia has not
been overemphasized. Almost 75
percent of the army's new officers
in recent years have come from
ROTC. As Brooks noted, the
military gets a "very fine quality"
officer from the universities that
is not available from the
makeshift Officer Candidate
Schools.
ROTC constitutes a vital cog in
the machine of manpower
channeling. The threat of the
draft compels students to look for
an alternative, and the presence of
ROTC, with its tempting
monetary bribes, channels the
students into a program that will
allow the military to make the*
most efficient use of their
intelligence and class background.
Without ROTC, the procurement
of officers would suffer a general
breakdown. That's why the
Defense Department, and its local
minions, are fighting so hard to
defend it.
Niceties Abandoned
For Pitzer, ROTC has been so
"dirty" an issue that he has been
forced to exercise his coercive
power as university president
more directly than ever before in
his 15 month tenure. He duped
the faculty, ignored the students,
and now he has refused a public
forum.
In recent years Stanford has
held forums and convocations at
the drop of a hat on every
conceivable issue. Yet President
Pitzer recently wrote a letter to
the community which concluded
that "no constructive purpose"
could be served by an ROTC
forum. A week later he refused to
answer questions on ROTC at his
"Stanford University Now"
speech, and yesterday Provost
Richard Lyman turned down a
request from the ASSU Senate for
a forum.
There is no mystery in Pitzer's
refusal to talk about ROTC. He
fears a repetition of the March 11

trustee forum of last year, when 5
trustees and 5 radicals debated in
Memorial Auditorium on research
policy, and the radicals won. The
memory of that administration
blunder is still fresh.
When a group of law students
offered to act as a sponsor for a
public forum on ROTC,
presidential assistant Fred Glover
reportedly told them, "We made
that mistake last year and we're
not going to do it again." It seems
that free debate and discussion
can go on at this university only
as long as sensitive policy
questions are not at issue.
Stage Managed Council
Pitzer apparently hopes that
the Academic Council meeting on
Monday will de-fuse campus
feeling against ROTC. The whole
think has been stage managed to
Pitzer's best advantage. The
Council will carefully limit the
debate to academic credit,
ignoring the issues of war,
imperialism, and complicity in
genocide. The Council will vote to
take a mail ballot of all faculty.
The mail ballot will come due
sometime before spring quarter
starts, so returning students will
be confronted with a fait
accompli.
In all probability, the faculty
will support the senate's earlier
acceptance of Pitzer's plan for
continuation of ROTC. In past
controversies like SRI, faculty
have not shown themselves to be
very sympathetic to the struggles
against U.S. imperialism when
faculty interests are at stake. They
will talk blazes against the
Vietnam war, but do nothing
controversial to oppose it.
Moreover, the administration
has warned that the government
might retaliate against Stanford
by cutting faculty research grants
if ROTC is eliminated.
With or without a favorable
faculty vote, the military can
continue ROTC at Stanford only
if ROTC classes and drills are able
to function at a campus that is
strongly anti-war and
anti-military. Pitzer's railings
against "coercion" and
"disruption" on campus sound
pretty hollow when used to
defend the U.S. military.

Pitzer recently wrote a letter to
the community which concluded
that "no constructive purpose"
could be served by an ROTC
forum. A week later he refused to
answer questions on ROTC at his
"Stanford University Now"
speech, and yesterday Provost
Richard Lyman turned down a
request from the ASSU Senate for
a forum.
There is no mystery in Pitzer's
refusal to talk about ROTC. He
fears a repetition of the March 11

trustee forum of last year, when 5
trustees and 5 radicals debated in
Memorial Auditorium on research
policy, and the radicals won. The
memory of that administration
blunder is still fresh.
When a group of law students
offered to act as a sponsor for a
public forum on ROTC,
presidential assistant Fred Glover
reportedly told them, "We made
that mistake last year and we're
not going to do it again." It seems
that free debate and discussion
can go on at this university only
as long as sensitive policy
questions are not at issue.
Stage Managed Council
Pitzer apparently hopes that
the Academic Council meeting on
Monday will de-fuse campus
feeling against ROTC. The whole
think has been stage managed to
Pitzer's best advantage. The
Council will carefully limit the
debate to academic credit,
ignoring the issues of war,
imperialism, and complicity in
genocide. The Council will vote to
take a mail ballot of all faculty.
The mail ballot will come due
sometime before spring quarter
starts, so returning students will
be confronted with a fait
accompli.
In all probability, the faculty
will support the senate's earlier
acceptance of Pitzer's plan for
continuation of ROTC. In past
controversies like SRI, faculty
have not shown themselves to be
very sympathetic to the struggles
against U.S. imperialism when
faculty interests are at stake. They
will talk blazes against the
Vietnam war, but do nothing
controversial to oppose it.
Moreover, the administration
has warned that the government
might retaliate against Stanford
by cutting faculty research grants
if ROTC is eliminated.
With or without a favorable
faculty vote, the military can
continue ROTC at Stanford only
if ROTC classes and drills are able
to function at a campus that is
strongly anti-war and
anti-military. Pitzer's railings
against "coercion" and
"disruption" on campus sound
pretty hollow when used to
defend the U.S. military.

Today, B-52 bombers will drop
hundreds of tons of bombs on
Southeast disturbing people,
villages, and crops. The monsoon
rains will turn the bomb craters
into stagnant ponds that will
spread disease throughout the
battered countryside.
As you read your morning
Daily, U.S. troops will unhmber
their 105 mm howitzers and send a
random scattering of shells into
the hostile "free-fire zones"

Perhaps as you lift the next

an unlucky Vietnamese peasant
will be torn to pieces by shrapnel

While systematic genocide goes
on today in Southeast Asia,
systematic U.S. oppression will
affect the lives of hundreds of
millions of people elsewhere in
the world. In Guatemala, the
oppression will take the form of
the economic stranglehold of U.S.
corporations on the native
economy. In Detroit, oppression
will be mainfested by heavily
armed white police patrolling a
black ghetto.
Everywhere, the oppression will
be enforced by the actual
presence or threat of the U.S.
military, a collosal machine
maintaining an armed strength of
three million men. When U.S.
economic or political interests are

threatened, the military
intervenes: Lebanon in 1958;
Cuba in 1960; Laos in 1962;
Vietnam in 1964; Santo Domingo
in 1965; the ghettos of the home
country in 1967 and 1968.
Today's Biggest News
The great single cause of human
misery in the world today is the
U.S. military and the oppression it
supports. Today's biggest
news—and tomorrow's—is that the
war continues, the genocide
continues, the oppression
continues.
I cannot separate my view of
my own life from the
overwhelming reality of U.S.
imperialism. There is a simple
dichotomy: I am supporting the
military or I am opposing it; I an
taking the side of the oppressors
or the side of the oppressed.
Neutrality is an illusion. A passive
acceptance of the Status quo is
support for the status quo of
oppression. Compromise with the
Department of Defense is support
for the Department of Defense.
The same choice confronts
Stanford University as a
community of students, faculty
and workers. The institution has
no better claim to neutrality than
the individual, and all individuals
bear a responsibility for their
behavior as members of
institutions. That precedent was
established at Nuremberg.

The ROTC controversy has
drawn the lines fairly clearly at
Stanford. Unlike the research
controversy of last spring, it takes
no mental leap whatsoever to
connect ROTC with oppression
and genocide. The military is right
here on campus, training officers
for the Army, Navy and Air
Force. Support for ROTC is
support for the worldwide
activities of the U.S. military,
which depend on a large and
steady supply of officers that only
ROTC can provide.
Just So Much Horseshit
The complicated debate over
academic credit, faculty review of
ROTC courses, and punitive
clauses is just so much horseshit.
If there were no war in Vietnam,
none of these aspects of ROTC
would be called into question.
Academic credit for military
training is certainly obscene, and
the punitive clause in ROTC
student contracts does constitute
the only involuntary servitude at
Stanford. But to criticize ROTC

on these grounds is to imply that
ROTC would somehow be
acceptable if the proper reforms
were made.
In Friday's Daily for instance,
law professor Thomas Ehrlich
criticized the punitive clause
because "the military's purpose
could be achieved without this
kind of sledge hammer
arrangement." Ehrlich seems to be
saying that the military's purposes
are acceptable to him. The
Pentagon can use its "sledge
hammer" on the Vietnamese, but
not on the privileged students of
Stanford University.
While the faculty has been
tying itself up in hypocritical
knots, the radical community has
consistently tried to define the
issue in terms of ROTC's
contribution to U.S. imperialism.
It has been difficult to persuade
some students that we regard
ROTC as an intrinsicaly important
issue, and not just as a convenient
focal point for radical agitation.
Fortunately, the Stanford
administration has described the
importance of ROTC quite
forcefully. The March 19, 1969,
issue of Campus Report contained
an interview with Vice Provost
Howard Brooks which is well
worth quoting at length:
"Brooks notes that faculty
groups at Harvard, Princeton,
and Yale—among others—have
voted to deny ROTC credit,
and the Department of Defense
is facing the reality of the
'domino theory.' He states that
although ROTC programs at
Stanford and Ivy League
schools are expensive, they
represent prestige value.
'Already there are stirrings of
opposition to ROTC at state
institutions,' Brooks explains,
'and if the prestige schools
drop the programs, the schools
well could follow suit.'
'Fine Quality Officers'
"Brooks, who has been in
frequent consultation with
national military and civilian
DOD leaders recently, says that
the officers that are turned out
by these very prestige
universities are of very fine
quality.' Therefore, the services
are anxious to retain ROTC on
college and university
campuses. The logic of this

sentiment is evident when it is
considered that approximately
20,000 new army second
lieutenants are required each
year.
"The vice provost interprets
the DOD attitude as one
seeking to remove as many
bases of academic criticisms as
possible."
As Brooks predicted, the
Defense Department has started a
counter-offensive to defend
ROTC. Stanford appears to be a
crucial battleground; it is the first
elite school where an attempt is
being made to reverse a faculty
decision that would have crippled
the program.
The Army plan that Pitzer has
pushed down the faculty's throats
does indeed remove what Brooks
calls "academic criticisms." Most
of the ROTC classwork will be
shifted to regular courses in other
departments. The remaining
military courses will be given
scrutiny on academic grounds
from the faculty-student
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. If this plan can be
instituted at Stanford, the
Defense Department clearly hopes
to use it to preserve ROTC
wherever it is attacked on the
sham issue of the academic credit.
A Test Case
There is good reason to believe
that the Defense Department has
deliberately made Stanford a "test
case" on ROTC. Deputy Secretary
of Defense David Packard, a
former Stanford trustee, has very
strong influence on the present
Board of Trustees. Vice Provost
Brooks, who is the
administration's ROTC expert,
served the same role for the
Defense Department last year as a
member of a special DOD
advisory group on ROTC. His
advisory group recommended
"reforms" in ROTC which closely
match what Pitzer is not trying to
institute at Stanford. When Pitzer
speaks on ROTC, it's the Defense
Department that's talking.
So the fate of Stanford ROTC
has a double significance.
Stanford ROTC provides 100 new
officers a year for the U.S. war
machine. It also constitutes a
possible turning point in the
struggle over the presence of the
military on campuses throughout

the nation. The Defense
Department anticipates an
important victory, but it could
well backfire completely. If we
can eliminate ROTC from
Stanford a powerful additional
impetus could be given to the
anti-ROTC movement across the
nation.
The importance of ROTC to
the war in Southeast Asia has not
been overemphasized. Almost 75
percent of the army's new officers
in recent years have come from
ROTC. As Brooks noted, the
military gets a "very fine quality"
officer from the universities that
is not available from the
makeshift Officer Candidate
Schools.
ROTC constitutes a vital cog in
the machine of manpower
channeling. The threat of the
draft compels students to look for
an alternative, and the presence of
ROTC, with its tempting
monetary bribes, channels the
students into a program that will
allow the military to make the*
most efficient use of their
intelligence and class background.
Without ROTC, the procurement
of officers would suffer a general
breakdown. That's why the
Defense Department, and its local
minions, are fighting so hard to
defend it.
Niceties Abandoned
For Pitzer, ROTC has been so
"dirty" an issue that he has been
forced to exercise his coercive
power as university president
more directly than ever before in
his 15 month tenure. He duped
the faculty, ignored the students,
and now he has refused a public
forum.
In recent years Stanford has
held forums and convocations at
the drop of a hat on every
conceivable issue. Yet President
Pitzer recently wrote a letter to
the community which concluded
that "no constructive purpose"
could be served by an ROTC
forum. A week later he refused to
answer questions on ROTC at his

A Test Case
There is good reason to believe
that the Defense Department has
deliberately made Stanford a "test
case" on ROTC. Deputy Secretary
of Defense David Packard, a
former Stanford trustee, has very
strong influence on the present
Board of Trustees. Vice Provost
Brooks, who is the
administration's ROTC expert,
served the same role for the
Defense Department last year as a
member of a special DOD
advisory group on ROTC. His
advisory group recommended
"reforms" in ROTC which closely
match what Pitzer is not trying to
institute at Stanford. When Pitzer
speaks on ROTC, it's the Defense
Department that's talking.
So the fate of Stanford ROTC
has a double significance.
Stanford ROTC provides 100 new
officers a year for the U.S. war
machine. It also constitutes a
possible turning point in the
struggle over the presence of the
military on campuses throughout

the nation. The Defense
Department anticipates an
important victory, but it could
well backfire completely. If we
can eliminate ROTC from
Stanford a powerful additional
impetus could be given to the
anti-ROTC movement across the
nation.
The importance of ROTC to
the war in Southeast Asia has not
been overemphasized. Almost 75
percent of the army's new officers
in recent years have come from
ROTC. As Brooks noted, the
military gets a "very fine quality"
officer from the universities that
is not available from the
makeshift Officer Candidate
Schools.
ROTC constitutes a vital cog in
the machine of manpower
channeling. The threat of the
draft compels students to look for
an alternative, and the presence of
ROTC, with its tempting
monetary bribes, channels the
students into a program that will
allow the military to make the*
most efficient use of their
intelligence and class background.
Without ROTC, the procurement
of officers would suffer a general
breakdown. That's why the
Defense Department, and its local
minions, are fighting so hard to
defend it.
Niceties Abandoned
For Pitzer, ROTC has been so
"dirty" an issue that he has been
forced to exercise his coercive
power as university president
more directly than ever before in
his 15 month tenure. He duped
the faculty, ignored the students,
and now he has refused a public
forum.
In recent years Stanford has
held forums and convocations at
the drop of a hat on every
conceivable issue. Yet President
Pitzer recently wrote a letter to
the community which concluded
that "no constructive purpose"
could be served by an ROTC
forum. A week later he refused to
answer questions on ROTC at his
"Stanford University Now"
speech, and yesterday Provost
Richard Lyman turned down a
request from the ASSU Senate for
a forum.
There is no mystery in Pitzer's
refusal to talk about ROTC. He
fears a repetition of the March 11

trustee forum of last year, when 5
trustees and 5 radicals debated in
Memorial Auditorium on research
policy, and the radicals won. The
memory of that administration
blunder is still fresh.
When a group of law students
offered to act as a sponsor for a
public forum on ROTC,
presidential assistant Fred Glover
reportedly told them, "We made
that mistake last year and we're
not going to do it again." It seems
that free debate and discussion
can go on at this university only
as long as sensitive policy
questions are not at issue.
Stage Managed Council
Pitzer apparently hopes that
the Academic Council meeting on
Monday will de-fuse campus
feeling against ROTC. The whole
think has been stage managed to
Pitzer's best advantage. The
Council will carefully limit the
debate to academic credit,
ignoring the issues of war,
imperialism, and complicity in
genocide. The Council will vote to
take a mail ballot of all faculty.
The mail ballot will come due
sometime before spring quarter
starts, so returning students will
be confronted with a fait
accompli.
In all probability, the faculty
will support the senate's earlier
acceptance of Pitzer's plan for
continuation of ROTC. In past
controversies like SRI, faculty
have not shown themselves to be
very sympathetic to the struggles
against U.S. imperialism when
faculty interests are at stake. They
will talk blazes against the
Vietnam war, but do nothing
controversial to oppose it.
Moreover, the administration
has warned that the government
might retaliate against Stanford
by cutting faculty research grants
if ROTC is eliminated.
With or without a favorable
faculty vote, the military can
continue ROTC at Stanford only
if ROTC classes and drills are able
to function at a campus that is
strongly anti-war and
anti-military. Pitzer's railings
against "coercion" and
"disruption" on campus sound
pretty hollow when used to
defend the U.S. military.

Today, B-52 bombers will drop

While systematic genocide goes
on today in Southeast Asia,
systematic U.S. oppression will
affect the lives of hundreds of
millions of people elsewhere in
the world. In Guatemala, the
oppression will take the form of
the economic stranglehold of U.S.
corporations on the native
economy. In Detroit, oppression
will be mainfested by heavily
armed white police patrolling a
black ghetto.
Everywhere, the oppression will
be enforced by the actual
presence or threat of the U.S.
military, a collosal machine
maintaining an armed strength of
three million men. When U.S.
economic or political interests are

threatened, the military
intervenes: Lebanon in 1958;
Cuba in 1960; Laos in 1962;
Vietnam in 1964; Santo Domingo
in 1965; the ghettos of the home
country in 1967 and 1968.
Today's Biggest News
The great single cause of human
misery in the world today is the
U.S. military and the oppression it
supports. Today's biggest
news—and tomorrow's—is that the
war continues, the genocide
continues, the oppression
continues.
I cannot separate my view of
my own life from the
overwhelming reality of U.S.
imperialism. There is a simple
dichotomy: I am supporting the
military or I am opposing it; I an
taking the side of the oppressors
or the side of the oppressed.
Neutrality is an illusion. A passive
acceptance of the Status quo is
support for the status quo of
oppression. Compromise with the
Department of Defense is support
for the Department of Defense.
The same choice confronts
Stanford University as a
community of students, faculty
and workers. The institution has
no better claim to neutrality than
the individual, and all individuals
bear a responsibility for their
behavior as members of
institutions. That precedent was
established at Nuremberg.

The ROTC controversy has
drawn the lines fairly clearly at
Stanford. Unlike the research
controversy of last spring, it takes
no mental leap whatsoever to
connect ROTC with oppression
and genocide. The military is right
here on campus, training officers
for the Army, Navy and Air
Force. Support for ROTC is
support for the worldwide
activities of the U.S. military,
which depend on a large and
steady supply of officers that only
ROTC can provide.
Just So Much Horseshit
The complicated debate over
academic credit, faculty review of
ROTC courses, and punitive
clauses is just so much horseshit.
If there were no war in Vietnam,
none of these aspects of ROTC
would be called into question.
Academic credit for military
training is certainly obscene, and
the punitive clause in ROTC
student contracts does constitute
the only involuntary servitude at
Stanford. But to criticize ROTC

on these grounds is to imply that
ROTC would somehow be
acceptable if the proper reforms
were made.
In Friday's Daily for instance,
law professor Thomas Ehrlich
criticized the punitive clause
because "the military's purpose
could be achieved without this
kind of sledge hammer
arrangement." Ehrlich seems to be
saying that the military's purposes
are acceptable to him. The
Pentagon can use its "sledge
hammer" on the Vietnamese, but
not on the privileged students of
Stanford University.
While the faculty has been
tying itself up in hypocritical
knots, the radical community has
consistently tried to define the
issue in terms of ROTC's
contribution to U.S. imperialism.
It has been difficult to persuade
some students that we regard
ROTC as an intrinsicaly important
issue, and not just as a convenient
focal point for radical agitation.
Fortunately, the Stanford
administration has described the
importance of ROTC quite
forcefully. The March 19, 1969,
issue of Campus Report contained
an interview with Vice Provost
Howard Brooks which is well
worth quoting at length:
"Brooks notes that faculty
groups at Harvard, Princeton,
and Yale—among others—have
voted to deny ROTC credit,
and the Department of Defense
is facing the reality of the
'domino theory.' He states that
although ROTC programs at
Stanford and Ivy League
schools are expensive, they
represent prestige value.
'Already there are stirrings of
opposition to ROTC at state
institutions,' Brooks explains,
'and if the prestige schools
drop the programs, the schools
well could follow suit.'
'Fine Quality Officers'
"Brooks, who has been in
frequent consultation with
national military and civilian
DOD leaders recently, says that
the officers that are turned out
by these very prestige
universities are of very fine
quality.' Therefore, the services
are anxious to retain ROTC on
college and university
campuses. The logic of this

sentiment is evident when it is
considered that approximately
20,000 new army second
lieutenants are required each
year.
"The vice provost interprets
the DOD attitude as one
seeking to remove as many
bases of academic criticisms as
possible."
As Brooks predicted, the
Defense Department has started a
counter-offensive to defend
ROTC. Stanford appears to be a
crucial battleground; it is the first
elite school where an attempt is
being made to reverse a faculty
decision that would have crippled
the program.
The Army plan that Pitzer has
pushed down the faculty's throats
does indeed remove what Brooks
calls "academic criticisms." Most
of the ROTC classwork will be
shifted to regular courses in other
departments. The remaining
military courses will be given
scrutiny on academic grounds
from the faculty-student
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. If this plan can be
instituted at Stanford, the
Defense Department clearly hopes
to use it to preserve ROTC
wherever it is attacked on the
sham issue of the academic credit.

that the Defense Department has

While the faculty has been
tying itself up in hypocritical
knots, the radical community has
consistently tried to define the
issue in terms of ROTC's
contribution to U.S. imperialism.
It has been difficult to persuade
some students that we regard
ROTC as an intrinsicaly important
issue, and not just as a convenient
focal point for radical agitation.
Fortunately, the Stanford
administration has described the
importance of ROTC quite
forcefully. The March 19, 1969,
issue of Campus Report contained
an interview with Vice Provost
Howard Brooks which is well
worth quoting at length:
"Brooks notes that faculty
groups at Harvard, Princeton,
and Yale—among others—have
voted to deny ROTC credit,
and the Department of Defense
is facing the reality of the
'domino theory.' He states that
although ROTC programs at
Stanford and Ivy League
schools are expensive, they
represent prestige value.
'Already there are stirrings of
opposition to ROTC at state
institutions,' Brooks explains,
'and if the prestige schools
drop the programs, the schools
well could follow suit.'
'Fine Quality Officers'
"Brooks, who has been in
frequent consultation with
national military and civilian
DOD leaders recently, says that
the officers that are turned out
by these very prestige
universities are of very fine
quality.' Therefore, the services
are anxious to retain ROTC on
college and university
campuses. The logic of this

sentiment is evident when it is
considered that approximately
20,000 new army second
lieutenants are required each
year.
"The vice provost interprets
the DOD attitude as one
seeking to remove as many
bases of academic criticisms as
possible."
As Brooks predicted, the
Defense Department has started a
counter-offensive to defend
ROTC. Stanford appears to be a
crucial battleground; it is the first
elite school where an attempt is
being made to reverse a faculty
decision that would have crippled
the program.
The Army plan that Pitzer has
pushed down the faculty's throats
does indeed remove what Brooks
calls "academic criticisms." Most
of the ROTC classwork will be
shifted to regular courses in other
departments. The remaining
military courses will be given
scrutiny on academic grounds
from the faculty-student
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. If this plan can be
instituted at Stanford, the
Defense Department clearly hopes
to use it to preserve ROTC
wherever it is attacked on the
sham issue of the academic credit.
A Test Case
There is good reason to believe
that the Defense Department has
deliberately made Stanford a "test
case" on ROTC. Deputy Secretary
of Defense David Packard, a
former Stanford trustee, has very
strong influence on the present
Board of Trustees. Vice Provost
Brooks, who is the
administration's ROTC expert,
served the same role for the
Defense Department last year as a
member of a special DOD
advisory group on ROTC. His
advisory group recommended
"reforms" in ROTC which closely
match what Pitzer is not trying to
institute at Stanford. When Pitzer
speaks on ROTC, it's the Defense
Department that's talking.
So the fate of Stanford ROTC
has a double significance.
Stanford ROTC provides 100 new
officers a year for the U.S. war
machine. It also constitutes a
possible turning point in the
struggle over the presence of the
military on campuses throughout

the nation. The Defense
Department anticipates an
important victory, but it could
well backfire completely. If we
can eliminate ROTC from
Stanford a powerful additional
impetus could be given to the
anti-ROTC movement across the
nation.
The importance of ROTC to
the war in Southeast Asia has not
been overemphasized. Almost 75
percent of the army's new officers
in recent years have come from
ROTC. As Brooks noted, the
military gets a "very fine quality"
officer from the universities that
is not available from the
makeshift Officer Candidate
Schools.
ROTC constitutes a vital cog in
the machine of manpower
channeling. The threat of the
draft compels students to look for
an alternative, and the presence of
ROTC, with its tempting
monetary bribes, channels the
students into a program that will
allow the military to make the*
most efficient use of their
intelligence and class background.
Without ROTC, the procurement
of officers would suffer a general
breakdown. That's why the
Defense Department, and its local
minions, are fighting so hard to
defend it.
Niceties Abandoned
For Pitzer, ROTC has been so
"dirty" an issue that he has been
forced to exercise his coercive
power as university president
more directly than ever before in
his 15 month tenure. He duped
the faculty, ignored the students,
and now he has refused a public
forum.
In recent years Stanford has
held forums and convocations at
the drop of a hat on every
conceivable issue. Yet President
Pitzer recently wrote a letter to
the community which concluded
that "no constructive purpose"
could be served by an ROTC
forum. A week later he refused to
answer questions on ROTC at his
"Stanford University Now"
speech, and yesterday Provost
Richard Lyman turned down a
request from the ASSU Senate for
a forum.
There is no mystery in Pitzer's
refusal to talk about ROTC. He
fears a repetition of the March 11

trustee forum of last year, when 5
trustees and 5 radicals debated in
Memorial Auditorium on research
policy, and the radicals won. The
memory of that administration
blunder is still fresh.
When a group of law students
offered to act as a sponsor for a
public forum on ROTC,
presidential assistant Fred Glover
reportedly told them, "We made
that mistake last year and we're
not going to do it again." It seems
that free debate and discussion
can go on at this university only
as long as sensitive policy
questions are not at issue.
Stage Managed Council
Pitzer apparently hopes that
the Academic Council meeting on
Monday will de-fuse campus
feeling against ROTC. The whole
think has been stage managed to
Pitzer's best advantage. The
Council will carefully limit the
debate to academic credit,
ignoring the issues of war,
imperialism, and complicity in
genocide. The Council will vote to
take a mail ballot of all faculty.
The mail ballot will come due
sometime before spring quarter
starts, so returning students will
be confronted with a fait
accompli.
In all probability, the faculty
will support the senate's earlier
acceptance of Pitzer's plan for
continuation of ROTC. In past
controversies like SRI, faculty
have not shown themselves to be
very sympathetic to the struggles
against U.S. imperialism when
faculty interests are at stake. They
will talk blazes against the
Vietnam war, but do nothing
controversial to oppose it.
Moreover, the administration
has warned that the government
might retaliate against Stanford
by cutting faculty research grants
if ROTC is eliminated.
With or without a favorable
faculty vote, the military can
continue ROTC at Stanford only
if ROTC classes and drills are able
to function at a campus that is
strongly anti-war and
anti-military. Pitzer's railings
against "coercion" and
"disruption" on campus sound
pretty hollow when used to
defend the U.S. military.

Today, B-52 bombers will drop
hundreds of tons of bombs on
Southeast disturbing people,
villages, and crops. The monsoon
rains will turn the bomb craters
into stagnant ponds that will
spread disease throughout the
battered countryside.
As you read your morning
Daily, U.S. troops will unhmber
their 105 mm howitzers and send a
random scattering of shells into
the hostile "free-fire zones"
outside their barbed wire fences.
Perhaps as you lift the next
spoonful of cereal to your mouth,
an unlucky Vietnamese peasant
will be torn to pieces by shrapnel
from the exploding shells.
While systematic genocide goes
on today in Southeast Asia,
systematic U.S. oppression will
affect the lives of hundreds of
millions of people elsewhere in
the world. In Guatemala, the
oppression will take the form of
the economic stranglehold of U.S.
corporations on the native
economy. In Detroit, oppression
will be mainfested by heavily
armed white police patrolling a
black ghetto.
Everywhere, the oppression will
be enforced by the actual
presence or threat of the U.S.
military, a collosal machine
maintaining an armed strength of
three million men. When U.S.
economic or political interests are

threatened, the military
intervenes: Lebanon in 1958;
Cuba in 1960; Laos in 1962;
Vietnam in 1964; Santo Domingo
in 1965; the ghettos of the home
country in 1967 and 1968.
Today's Biggest News
The great single cause of human
misery in the world today is the
U.S. military and the oppression it
supports. Today's biggest
news—and tomorrow's—is that the
war continues, the genocide
continues, the oppression
continues.
I cannot separate my view of
my own life from the
overwhelming reality of U.S.
imperialism. There is a simple
dichotomy: I am supporting the
military or I am opposing it; I an
taking the side of the oppressors
or the side of the oppressed.
Neutrality is an illusion. A passive
acceptance of the Status quo is
support for the status quo of
oppression. Compromise with the
Department of Defense is support
for the Department of Defense.
The same choice confronts
Stanford University as a
community of students, faculty
and workers. The institution has
no better claim to neutrality than
the individual, and all individuals
bear a responsibility for their
behavior as members of
institutions. That precedent was
established at Nuremberg.

The ROTC controversy has
drawn the lines fairly clearly at
Stanford. Unlike the research
controversy of last spring, it takes
no mental leap whatsoever to
connect ROTC with oppression
and genocide. The military is right
here on campus, training officers
for the Army, Navy and Air
Force. Support for ROTC is
support for the worldwide
activities of the U.S. military,
which depend on a large and
steady supply of officers that only
ROTC can provide.
Just So Much Horseshit
The complicated debate over
academic credit, faculty review of
ROTC courses, and punitive
clauses is just so much horseshit.
If there were no war in Vietnam,
none of these aspects of ROTC
would be called into question.
Academic credit for military
training is certainly obscene, and
the punitive clause in ROTC
student contracts does constitute
the only involuntary servitude at
Stanford. But to criticize ROTC

on these grounds is to imply that
ROTC would somehow be
acceptable if the proper reforms
were made.
In Friday's Daily for instance,
law professor Thomas Ehrlich
criticized the punitive clause
because "the military's purpose
could be achieved without this
kind of sledge hammer
arrangement." Ehrlich seems to be
saying that the military's purposes
are acceptable to him. The
Pentagon can use its "sledge
hammer" on the Vietnamese, but
not on the privileged students of
Stanford University.
While the faculty has been
tying itself up in hypocritical
knots, the radical community has
consistently tried to define the
issue in terms of ROTC's

Today's Biggest News
The great single cause of human
misery in the world today is the
U.S. military and the oppression it
supports. Today's biggest
news—and tomorrow's—is that the
war continues, the genocide
continues, the oppression
continues.
I cannot separate my view of
my own life from the
overwhelming reality of U.S.
imperialism. There is a simple
dichotomy: I am supporting the
military or I am opposing it; I an
taking the side of the oppressors
or the side of the oppressed.
Neutrality is an illusion. A passive
acceptance of the Status quo is
support for the status quo of
oppression. Compromise with the
Department of Defense is support
for the Department of Defense.
The same choice confronts
Stanford University as a
community of students, faculty
and workers. The institution has
no better claim to neutrality than
the individual, and all individuals
bear a responsibility for their
behavior as members of
institutions. That precedent was
established at Nuremberg.

The ROTC controversy has
drawn the lines fairly clearly at
Stanford. Unlike the research
controversy of last spring, it takes
no mental leap whatsoever to
connect ROTC with oppression
and genocide. The military is right
here on campus, training officers
for the Army, Navy and Air
Force. Support for ROTC is
support for the worldwide
activities of the U.S. military,
which depend on a large and
steady supply of officers that only
ROTC can provide.
Just So Much Horseshit
The complicated debate over
academic credit, faculty review of
ROTC courses, and punitive
clauses is just so much horseshit.
If there were no war in Vietnam,
none of these aspects of ROTC
would be called into question.
Academic credit for military
training is certainly obscene, and
the punitive clause in ROTC
student contracts does constitute
the only involuntary servitude at
Stanford. But to criticize ROTC

on these grounds is to imply that
ROTC would somehow be
acceptable if the proper reforms
were made.
In Friday's Daily for instance,
law professor Thomas Ehrlich
criticized the punitive clause
because "the military's purpose
could be achieved without this
kind of sledge hammer
arrangement." Ehrlich seems to be
saying that the military's purposes
are acceptable to him. The
Pentagon can use its "sledge
hammer" on the Vietnamese, but
not on the privileged students of
Stanford University.
While the faculty has been
tying itself up in hypocritical
knots, the radical community has
consistently tried to define the
issue in terms of ROTC's
contribution to U.S. imperialism.
It has been difficult to persuade
some students that we regard
ROTC as an intrinsicaly important
issue, and not just as a convenient
focal point for radical agitation.
Fortunately, the Stanford
administration has described the
importance of ROTC quite
forcefully. The March 19, 1969,
issue of Campus Report contained
an interview with Vice Provost
Howard Brooks which is well
worth quoting at length:
"Brooks notes that faculty
groups at Harvard, Princeton,
and Yale—among others—have
voted to deny ROTC credit,
and the Department of Defense
is facing the reality of the
'domino theory.' He states that
although ROTC programs at
Stanford and Ivy League
schools are expensive, they
represent prestige value.
'Already there are stirrings of
opposition to ROTC at state
institutions,' Brooks explains,
'and if the prestige schools
drop the programs, the schools
well could follow suit.'
'Fine Quality Officers'
"Brooks, who has been in
frequent consultation with
national military and civilian
DOD leaders recently, says that
the officers that are turned out
by these very prestige
universities are of very fine
quality.' Therefore, the services
are anxious to retain ROTC on
college and university
campuses. The logic of this

sentiment is evident when it is
considered that approximately
20,000 new army second
lieutenants are required each
year.
"The vice provost interprets
the DOD attitude as one
seeking to remove as many
bases of academic criticisms as
possible."
As Brooks predicted, the
Defense Department has started a
counter-offensive to defend
ROTC. Stanford appears to be a
crucial battleground; it is the first
elite school where an attempt is
being made to reverse a faculty
decision that would have crippled
the program.
The Army plan that Pitzer has
pushed down the faculty's throats
does indeed remove what Brooks
calls "academic criticisms." Most
of the ROTC classwork will be
shifted to regular courses in other
departments. The remaining
military courses will be given
scrutiny on academic grounds
from the faculty-student
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. If this plan can be
instituted at Stanford, the
Defense Department clearly hopes
to use it to preserve ROTC
wherever it is attacked on the
sham issue of the academic credit.
A Test Case
There is good reason to believe
that the Defense Department has
deliberately made Stanford a "test
case" on ROTC. Deputy Secretary
of Defense David Packard, a
former Stanford trustee, has very
strong influence on the present
Board of Trustees. Vice Provost
Brooks, who is the
administration's ROTC expert,
served the same role for the
Defense Department last year as a
member of a special DOD
advisory group on ROTC. His
advisory group recommended
"reforms" in ROTC which closely
match what Pitzer is not trying to
institute at Stanford. When Pitzer
speaks on ROTC, it's the Defense
Department that's talking.
So the fate of Stanford ROTC
has a double significance.
Stanford ROTC provides 100 new
officers a year for the U.S. war
machine. It also constitutes a
possible turning point in the
struggle over the presence of the
military on campuses throughout

the nation. The Defense
Department anticipates an
important victory, but it could
well backfire completely. If we
can eliminate ROTC from
Stanford a powerful additional
impetus could be given to the
anti-ROTC movement across the
nation.
The importance of ROTC to
the war in Southeast Asia has not
been overemphasized. Almost 75
percent of the army's new officers
in recent years have come from
ROTC. As Brooks noted, the
military gets a "very fine quality"
officer from the universities that
is not available from the
makeshift Officer Candidate
Schools.
ROTC constitutes a vital cog in
the machine of manpower
channeling. The threat of the
draft compels students to look for
an alternative, and the presence of
ROTC, with its tempting
monetary bribes, channels the
students into a program that will
allow the military to make the*
most efficient use of their
intelligence and class background.
Without ROTC, the procurement
of officers would suffer a general
breakdown. That's why the
Defense Department, and its local
minions, are fighting so hard to
defend it.
Niceties Abandoned
For Pitzer, ROTC has been so
"dirty" an issue that he has been
forced to exercise his coercive
power as university president
more directly than ever before in
his 15 month tenure. He duped
the faculty, ignored the students,
and now he has refused a public
forum.
In recent years Stanford has
held forums and convocations at
the drop of a hat on every
conceivable issue. Yet President
Pitzer recently wrote a letter to
the community which concluded
that "no constructive purpose"
could be served by an ROTC
forum. A week later he refused to
answer questions on ROTC at his
"Stanford University Now"
speech, and yesterday Provost
Richard Lyman turned down a
request from the ASSU Senate for
a forum.
There is no mystery in Pitzer's
refusal to talk about ROTC. He
fears a repetition of the March 11

trustee forum of last year, when 5
trustees and 5 radicals debated in
Memorial Auditorium on research
policy, and the radicals won. The
memory of that administration
blunder is still fresh.
When a group of law students
offered to act as a sponsor for a
public forum on ROTC,
presidential assistant Fred Glover
reportedly told them, "We made
that mistake last year and we're
not going to do it again." It seems
that free debate and discussion
can go on at this university only
as long as sensitive policy
questions are not at issue.
Stage Managed Council
Pitzer apparently hopes that
the Academic Council meeting on
Monday will de-fuse campus
feeling against ROTC. The whole
think has been stage managed to
Pitzer's best advantage. The
Council will carefully limit the
debate to academic credit,
ignoring the issues of war,
imperialism, and complicity in
genocide. The Council will vote to
take a mail ballot of all faculty.
The mail ballot will come due
sometime before spring quarter
starts, so returning students will
be confronted with a fait
accompli.
In all probability, the faculty
will support the senate's earlier
acceptance of Pitzer's plan for
continuation of ROTC. In past
controversies like SRI, faculty
have not shown themselves to be
very sympathetic to the struggles
against U.S. imperialism when
faculty interests are at stake. They
will talk blazes against the
Vietnam war, but do nothing
controversial to oppose it.
Moreover, the administration
has warned that the government
might retaliate against Stanford
by cutting faculty research grants
if ROTC is eliminated.
With or without a favorable
faculty vote, the military can
continue ROTC at Stanford only
if ROTC classes and drills are able
to function at a campus that is
strongly anti-war and
anti-military. Pitzer's railings
against "coercion" and
"disruption" on campus sound
pretty hollow when used to
defend the U.S. military.
(Michael Sweeney is a member
of the New Moratorium,)
Today, B-52 bombers will drop
hundreds of tons of bombs on
Southeast disturbing people,
villages, and crops. The monsoon
rains will turn the bomb craters
into stagnant ponds that will
spread disease throughout the
battered countryside.
As you read your morning
Daily, U.S. troops will unhmber
their 105 mm howitzers and send a
random scattering of shells into
the hostile "free-fire zones"
outside their barbed wire fences.
Perhaps as you lift the next
spoonful of cereal to your mouth,
an unlucky Vietnamese peasant
will be torn to pieces by shrapnel
from the exploding shells.
While systematic genocide goes
on today in Southeast Asia,
systematic U.S. oppression will
affect the lives of hundreds of
millions of people elsewhere in
the world. In Guatemala, the
oppression will take the form of
the economic stranglehold of U.S.
corporations on the native
economy. In Detroit, oppression
will be mainfested by heavily
armed white police patrolling a
black ghetto.
Everywhere, the oppression will
be enforced by the actual
presence or threat of the U.S.
military, a collosal machine
maintaining an armed strength of
three million men. When U.S.
economic or political interests are

threatened, the military
intervenes: Lebanon in 1958;
Cuba in 1960; Laos in 1962;
Vietnam in 1964; Santo Domingo
in 1965; the ghettos of the home
country in 1967 and 1968.

starts, so returning students will
be confronted with a fait
accompli.
In all probability, the faculty
will support the senate's earlier
acceptance of Pitzer's plan for
continuation of ROTC. In past
controversies like SRI, faculty
have not shown themselves to be
very sympathetic to the struggles
against U.S. imperialism when
faculty interests are at stake. They
will talk blazes against the
Vietnam war, but do nothing
controversial to oppose it.
Moreover, the administration
has warned that the government
might retaliate against Stanford
by cutting faculty research grants
if ROTC is eliminated.
With or without a favorable
faculty vote, the military can
continue ROTC at Stanford only
if ROTC classes and drills are able
to function at a campus that is
strongly anti-war and
anti-military. Pitzer's railings
against "coercion" and
"disruption" on campus sound
pretty hollow when used to
defend the U.S. military.
