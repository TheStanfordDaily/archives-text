# Eradication' Essential
## The
						Smallpox Danger 
### Joshua Lederberg 
The eradication of smallpox is one of the major
programs of the World Health Organization, and
may become one of the conspicuous successes of
international cooperation for human welfare. The
virus is spread by direct contact from infected to
susceptibly people, is often lethal, and the
infection once established responds poorly if at all
to any existing medical procedures. The main
weapons against smallpox have been quarantine of
exposed people and immunization of healthy ones
to contain the virus and to deny it the fertile
ground it needs for continued spread.
The W.H.O. programs are shrinking the territory
still occupied by smallpox as an endemic disease,
the main foci still left being in South Asia,
Indonesia, Central Africa and patches of Brazil.
Eradication
This victory may, however, be fraught with peril
if the concept of "eradication" is accepted at face
value, that is if statistics about the decline of
smallpox as a reported disease are mistakenly
interpreted as the disappearance of the smallpox
virus from the planet. The danger is that
"eradication" will be followed by complacency
and relaxation of the very measures that contain
the virus. If a large population of sensitive,
unvaccinated adults builds up, the consequences of
a. new epidemic would be the most serious, for the
disease tends to be most severe in young adults as
compared to its occurrence in the children who are
exposed earlier in life in endemic regions.
Demands for just such a relaxation have already
been voiced. Writing in the New England Journal
of Medicine (issue of Nov. 27), Drs. J. M. Lane and
J. D. Millar of the National Communicable Disease
Center take issue with the present recommended
practice of routinely vaccinating one-,year olds.
Pediatricians prefer children of this age, not
because they are at high risk of exposure to
smallpox, but because they are then least
vulnerable to rare side effects.
Significant complications occur in about 0.01
percent of vaccinations. In 1968, 9 deaths were
recorded as a consequence of some 14 million
vaccinations; but none of these were primary
vaccinations of one-year olds. Assuming some
corrections in the figures, Drs. Lane and Millar
calculate a basic risk of about one death per

million vaccinations, or a total of about 210 in the
U.S. between 1970 and 2000.
Not Here Since 1949
They also point to the statistics that show that
no smallpox has been imported into the U.S. since
1949. The progressive eradication of smallpox the
world over would lessen the chances of new
introductions in the future. The historical evidence
would seem to make it unlikely that as many as
210 cases of smallpox would ensue even if a
traveller did bring the virus back to the U.S. But
this history is a consequence of the very programs
now being criticised.
Community vs. Personal Values
Vaccination is a very clear example of a
confrontation of personal versus community
values. The person who avoids vaccination does
expose himself to some small risk of infection; but
he also exploits his fellow-citizens who submit to
it for the benefit of the community. These are
essentially the only measures we have against a
disease that has claimed ten millions of victims in
recorded history. A deterioration in our standards
of community protection will expose the entire
population to eventual risks of the utmost gravity.
The critics of vaccination have an important
point, but they are grasping the wrong end of the
stick. A complication rate of 0.01 percent is a
burden we should not have to pay, and much of it
would be preventable now by more careful
selection of patients who already give indications
of being at high risk, like children with eczema or
with immunological disorders. New vaccines are
being introduced that show some promise of
having even lower rates of side effects — a point
that is hard to prove when these are numerically
already so rare.
Vaccination Programs
Above all the community has a large, special
responsibility to learn how to minimize the
burdens on individual subjects who participate in
vaccination programs more for the public than for
their individual benefit. We still know very little
about why the vaccine does get out of hand in rare
cases. The recent course of budgetary policy for
health research flies in the teeth of that
responsibility.
