# Confused Values
## Smoke-screen Politics 
### Anne Nicol 
I find it distressing to see the
people I trust and the people I
don't trust getting together to
fight pollution - the problem of
the seventies. Of course I'm
concerned about "ecology,"
"survival", "the population
bomb". . .But I'm also concerned
about the priorities we place on
the problems we face. I'm asking
that we examine carefully the
reasons why the "pollution
problem" has been escalated to
the front of our consciousness in
the past few months.
When I see the Nixon
administration and Ronald
Reagan and Big Business coming
down in full force on something I
thought was a problem, I start
asking myself why. How come
we're all of a sudden talking the
same language? What's in it for
them? And this is what I come up
with: the pollution problem is a
smdke-screen. It is a way to get us
thinking about ourselves and our
children - and while we are
worrying about whether we'll be
able to breathe in ten years, we
don't have time to worry about
our brothers who are suffocating
now.
Cans and Justice
Our values are being confused
by this emphasis on pollution. So
our attention is directed to the
particles of pollution being
sprayed into the air by the
policeman's car while we forget tc
notice the bullets that same
policeman shoots into other
human beings. We get more upset
about the disposal of disposable
cans than the dispensing of
"justice" in the courts.
The anil-pollution cause serves
our "leaders" well. It is a problem
that can be solved. With a little
help from their friends our leaders
will provide the solution - to their
credit. And we, having been
thoroughly engrossed in the great
campaign to save the
environment, will (1) enjoy
renewed faith and admiration for
our leaders, and (2) hardly even
notice that meanwhile those old
problems we used to 6e concerned

about are still here, only they've
gotten worse.
Don't Compromise
1 My objective is not to belittle
concern for our environment - it's
beautiful to see people doing
something before it's really, really
too late. But before joining forces
with the very people who have
been resisting change in the areas
of civil rights and who are
supporting a war we cannot
condone, let us be sure we're not
compromising our positions on
these issues. Hopefully (and
logically) we should be able to
work for freedom from

oppression and against pollution
of our environment without
sacrificing one for the other. But
if it should come to a choice, and
we had time and resources to give
to only one area, I for one would
like to say we fought successfully
against political oppression in our
generation. Then everyone as free
heads could work against
pollution.
