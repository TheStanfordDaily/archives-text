# Grass Roots
## Radical Opportunists? 
### Leonard Siegel 
The formation of Grass Roots
this January was greeted, by
many, with skepticism Many
people concerned with ecology,
housing, or land use in
gpneral—who agreed with Grass
Roots on specific issues—thought
that the radicals in Grass Roots
were merely picking an issue upon
which they would build to a
confrontation.
Grass Roots consists of many
types of people, with different
political perspectives.
Nevertheless, most of the people
in Grass Roots have been involved
in local radical politics. A few
were active in the leadership of
the April Third Movement. As one
of Ihosr Grass Roots members, I
wish to respond to the popular
skepticism.
The primary political message
of Grass Roots is that one cannot
isolate the issues of ecology and
environment. Many members of
the American ruling elite, from
Nixon to Pitzer to the N«-w York
Tim en, have trumpted ecology as
the issue which will overcome the
disunity caused by the war and
urban (racial) problems.

Indeed, many young people
who were not long ago marching
in the Moratorium, or beginning
to attack institutional racism,
seem to have forgotten about the
war and racial oppression. I
participated in the formation of
Grass Roots because I considered
it essential for people discovering
the irrationality of the American
environment to remember that
there were other issues too. The
Grass Roots report on land use,
"The Promised Land," tries to
sketch out some of the
relationships between the War,
social injustice, and environmental
decay.
Recently, many ecologists and
conservationists have raised their
voice Hgainst the policies of major
corporations. Grass Roots radicals
(see "The Promised Land") go a
step farther. We do not believe
that the problems of pollution
and environment can be
adequately solved as long as we
live in a society governed by
competition and the profit
motive. We ask people to examine
the roots of the ecological crisis.
In our work we will attempt to

focus public attention on the
concentrations of power and
wealth responsible for most of our
problems.
Since primary responsibility lor
"eco-disaster" lies in the decisions
of a powerful few, and because
they are unwilling to sacrifice
profit and potition, I expect that
a movement which concerns itself
with Peninsula land use will lead
to confrontation. Confrontations
are not new in either the housing
or conservation movements. This
is not to say that confrontation is
the only method radicals are
willing to use. According to our
analysis, it will, at some point, be
necessary.
But in a sense, the formation of
Grass Roots was opportunist.
Though many GR members have
been involved in land use long
before the current rage, Grass
Roots probably would not have
formed had there not been
growing concern for the issues.
The organization of Grass Roost
was a response to a felt need of
the community.
