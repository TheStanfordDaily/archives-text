Dear Mom,
I wrote in to the computer
dating service to find a girlfriend.

(I am a graduate student in
engineering.) I received someone
who had exactly the same
interests and outlook on life—the
computer itself, an 1.8.M. 360.
What should I do?

Lucky you. I hear that the

Dear Mom,
I need some hints for better
interpersonal relationships.
Whenever I ask a girl out, she just
laughs and laughs. . .Have you a

Dear Despondent,
Eye contact is important for
good relationships. It's difficult to
have real eye contact, however, as
the noses keep getting in the way.
Warm Handshake: Keep hand
warm when not shaking hands by
putting it in one of the body's
heart centers (armpit, etc.). Talk
on timely subject <>r interest to
date: Example: when with an
advocate of Women's Liberation,
discuss Bodin's theory that
woman is the missing link
between ape and man. Be
genuinely interested in date's
well-being. Make little remarks

such as, "Your breath really
worries me. How are your
tonsils?" or "Does your eye just
cross naturally or is it attracted by
the wart on your nose?" ?nd, ol
course, the classic: "For a lat girl,
you don't sweat much."
Remember not to talk to your
date; you must "establish
communication." Also, one never
falls in love, but "progresses in a
meaningful relationship."
Consolingly, if you are dumped
on by your girl, she's just
"revealing her hang-up".
Meaningfully yours,
Mom
Dear Mom,
As a member of a women's
group here in Palo Alto, I was
shocked to hear that the Faculty
Club was seeking a liquor
license—right on the same campus
with all those dear innocent
students! But I was even more
scandalized to hear that the
University subsidizes a special
room in the library for people
recovering from hang-overs—the
Bender Room!
Horrified
Palo Alto Women's Club
Dear Mrs. Horritied,
Not only that—BUT the
University provides an elevator for
visitors to the Bender Room. (On
the assumption that they can't
handle the stairs.)
I agree about the iniquity of
the Faculty Club license. The
next thing you know, the students
will be drinking beer! (Which, as

we all know, is injurious to the
health when taken in conjunction
with LSD or on top of pot.) We
owe our dear students the
protection from vice that they so
earnestly seek. I know all the
youngsters here will welcome
your interest in their welfare.
Sanctimoniously,

DEAR TO MOTHER'S HEART:

Today's hero is Robert Goines of

anybody." Goines was sentenced
to 10 days in jail and fined $160
plus costs. But seven lawyers have
volunteered to defend him.

DEAR TO MOTHER'S HEART:

Today's hero is Robert Goines of

anybody." Goines was sentenced
to 10 days in jail and fined $160
plus costs. But seven lawyers have
volunteered to defend him.
Since the Indianapolis

Dear Despondent,
Eye contact is important for
good relationships. It's difficult to
have real eye contact, however, as
the noses keep getting in the way.
Warm Handshake: Keep hand
warm when not shaking hands by
putting it in one of the body's
heart centers (armpit, etc.). Talk
on timely subject <>r interest to
date: Example: when with an
advocate of Women's Liberation,
discuss Bodin's theory that
woman is the missing link
between ape and man. Be
genuinely interested in date's
well-being. Make little remarks

such as, "Your breath really
worries me. How are your
tonsils?" or "Does your eye just
cross naturally or is it attracted by
the wart on your nose?" ?nd, ol
course, the classic: "For a lat girl,
you don't sweat much."
Remember not to talk to your
date; you must "establish
communication." Also, one never
falls in love, but "progresses in a
meaningful relationship."
Consolingly, if you are dumped
on by your girl, she's just
"revealing her hang-up".
Meaningfully yours,
Mom
Dear Mom,
As a member of a women's
group here in Palo Alto, I was
shocked to hear that the Faculty
Club was seeking a liquor
license—right on the same campus
with all those dear innocent
students! But I was even more
scandalized to hear that the
University subsidizes a special
room in the library for people
recovering from hang-overs—the
Bender Room!
Horrified
Palo Alto Women's Club
Dear Mrs. Horritied,
Not only that—BUT the
University provides an elevator for
visitors to the Bender Room. (On
the assumption that they can't
handle the stairs.)
I agree about the iniquity of
the Faculty Club license. The
next thing you know, the students
will be drinking beer! (Which, as

we all know, is injurious to the
health when taken in conjunction
