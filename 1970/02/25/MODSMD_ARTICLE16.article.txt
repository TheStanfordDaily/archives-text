# Reforms Needed
## Language Program at Stanford-in-Austria 
### William Smart 
One of the most important aspects of any overseas experience is
language ability. Without a thorough command of the language, any
meaningful cultural contact is impossible. In order to make this
contact possible, the Overseas Campus Program avowedly administers
a series of "intensive" language programs which will enable a student
to at least master basic grammar and T vocabulary. This cannot be
learned otherwise in more informal contacts with natives. In Vienna,
however, little emphasis is placed on the language program by the
administration. One symptom of this lack of emphasis is the
treatment of the German teachers.
We have three German teachers for approximately seventy students
(a group usually consists of eighty students); they are all well-qualified
and have been excellent teachers. They are all native-speaking German
people, which is a great advantage for language instruction, and they
all know English very well. Their educational backgrounds are
impressive. One teacher has studied at Mount Holyoke, taught at
Oberlin, and is now working for a doctorate at the University of
Vienna. Another has taught at the University of Chicago for one year,
at Canterbury in England for four years, and has been certified as an
English-German translator. Another is working for a doctorate at the
University of Vienna and has been teaching at Stanford in Austria
since its establishment five years ago.
Heavy Workload
The workload which these teachers carry at Stanford in Austria is
extremely heavy. Although there are classes only four days a week,
the teachers still have between 12 and 15 hours of classes a week,
depending on the teacher, and not all of these classes are easily
prepared grammar classes. In fact, most of the classes involve
conversation, practical texts, literature, and drama, where grammar is
only incidentally involved, and even grammar classes usually include
much more than just grammar. Each one of these classes requires
therefore a substantial amount of preparation.
In comparison, even the lowest teachers at the University of Vienna
must prepare for only eight (8) hours of classes per week at the most.
TAs at Stanford seldom have any more than eight hours of classes a
week, and most of them have four or five hours a week. Needless to
say, this heavy workload makes it impossible for our teachers to give
personal attention to people who need extra help, and it is impossible
to obtain any kind of a varied course of German study or any
Independent Study Program with the teachers on this campus.
Pay Poor
The teachers here are also paid very poorly, even by Austrian
standards. The lowest paid teacher here is paid by Stanford 7,700

Austrian Schilling per month (US $308) before taxes. By comparison,
an Austrian Gymnasium teacher (roughly equivalent to an American
high school teacher) earns almost as much, approximately 4,300
Schillings after taxes, and the lowest Austrian university teachers earn
50% more, approximately 9,000 Schillings after taxes. TAs at
Stanford in California probably don't earn any more than the German
teachers here, but they don't have as heavy a workload, they are
generally not as well qualified, and they receive tuition benefits.
This unusually low salary makes it very hard for the teachers to
support themselves, especially since they live in Vienna, which, like all
metropolitan centers, is relatively expensive, and some of the teachers
must have additional tutorial positions on the side to supplement their
income. The pay is so bad that some of the teachers feel that they will
have to go somewhere else as soon as they receive their doctoral
degrees.
Helpful Teachers
In spite of the bad working conditions, the teachers have been very
interested in us and they have gone out of their way to help us, not
only with German, but also with our contact with Austrian society.
For example, one teacher conducts a drama class which requires many
hours of voluntary rehearsal time. The students have really enjoyed
this.
Another teacher keeps people informed of local art exhibitions,
theater productions, and other cultural events, and on her days off
shows people around some of the many interesting museums in
Vienna. They have introduced students to other Viennese, and they
have invited students into their own homes. The German teachers
provide the first and in many ways the most significant contact that
we have with Austrian society.
There are a number of conclusions which can be drawn from this
situation. The German teachers should be paid much better
considering the job they are assigned to do and the efforts which they
make on their own to help us. They should at least be paid according
to the Austrian standard, but they should really be paid more because
of the extreme importance which they have to this program.
More German Teachers
More importantly, there should be at least one or two more
German teachers at the Austrian campus. The present workloads are
inhumanly heavy and make individual treatment and independent
programs impossible. I personally attempted to arrange a directed
reading and writing program in addition to my regular language classes
and, although it was approved by one of the teachers (even though she
was already overworked), it was not approved by the academic

director here or the Overseas Campus Office on the grounds that there
were not enough German teachers. That is true, and we should have
more German teachers instead of less flexibility.
There should be a generally better attitude on the part of the
administration towards the German teachers. At the present time,
they are "second-rate" citizens, and are controlled in a very
authoritarian manner by the rather conservative academic director.
They should be given more support by the administration for
extracurricular activities. It was only after a bitter fight that they were
able to obtain something less than ten dollars per month per teacher
front the Overseas Campus Office for projects outside of the
classroom.
More Flexibility
These changes, I think, would improve the program in Austria
greatly. The German teachers would receive the more human
treatment that they deserve. The students would also be able to
receive more help from the German teachers, both in class and out.
The academic program would be able to be much more flexible and
this would make the students" stay in Austria more interesting. It
would enable the students to strengthen their command of the
German language, which would make contact with Austrian culture
more meaningful and more likely. The German teachers would be able
to do much more to encourage exposure to the Austrian culture. In
fact it is possible that an Austrian teacher could be exchanged for a
German teacher from the home campus. This would give the German
TA from Palo Alto an invaluable opportunity to work on a doctorate,
and the Austrian teacher could be very helpful in orienting future
Austria groups on the home campus for the Overseas Campus Office.
Necessary Changes
I think that these changes are necessary if Stanford in Austria is to
become an exciting, interesting experience again. And I am convinced
that these changes could be accomplished by re-allocating funds
within the Overseas Campus Program. For example, the assistant to
the director of this campus earns almost twice as much when room
and board for him and his wife are included as the German teachers.
He has only a B.A. and is sometimes not necessary. And, after all,
every time Robert Walker comes to visit us in Vienna, he stays in the
Imperial Hotel, the most expensive hotel in Vienna, where the
cheapest rooms cost 530 Austrian Schillings (US $20). That is very
high for Austria and is, indicently, more than two days' pay for one of
our German teachers.

director here or the Overseas Campus Office on the grounds that there
were not enough German teachers. That is true, and we should have
more German teachers instead of less flexibility.
There should be a generally better attitude on the part of the
administration towards the German teachers. At the present time,
they are "second-rate" citizens, and are controlled in a very
authoritarian manner by the rather conservative academic director.
They should be given more support by the administration for
extracurricular activities. It was only after a bitter fight that they were
able to obtain something less than ten dollars per month per teacher
front the Overseas Campus Office for projects outside of the
classroom.
More Flexibility
These changes, I think, would improve the program in Austria
greatly. The German teachers would receive the more human
treatment that they deserve. The students would also be able to
receive more help from the German teachers, both in class and out.
The academic program would be able to be much more flexible and
this would make the students" stay in Austria more interesting. It
would enable the students to strengthen their command of the
German language, which would make contact with Austrian culture
more meaningful and more likely. The German teachers would be able
to do much more to encourage exposure to the Austrian culture. In
fact it is possible that an Austrian teacher could be exchanged for a
German teacher from the home campus. This would give the German
TA from Palo Alto an invaluable opportunity to work on a doctorate,
and the Austrian teacher could be very helpful in orienting future
Austria groups on the home campus for the Overseas Campus Office.
Necessary Changes
I think that these changes are necessary if Stanford in Austria is to
become an exciting, interesting experience again. And I am convinced
that these changes could be accomplished by re-allocating funds
within the Overseas Campus Program. For example, the assistant to
the director of this campus earns almost twice as much when room
and board for him and his wife are included as the German teachers.
He has only a B.A. and is sometimes not necessary. And, after all,
every time Robert Walker comes to visit us in Vienna, he stays in the
Imperial Hotel, the most expensive hotel in Vienna, where the
cheapest rooms cost 530 Austrian Schillings (US $20). That is very
high for Austria and is, indicently, more than two days' pay for one of
our German teachers.
(William Smart is a Judicial Representative at Austria IX)
One of the most important aspects of any overseas experience is
language ability. Without a thorough command of the language, any
meaningful cultural contact is impossible. In order to make this
contact possible, the Overseas Campus Program avowedly administers
a series of "intensive" language programs which will enable a student
to at least master basic grammar and T vocabulary. This cannot be
learned otherwise in more informal contacts with natives. In Vienna,
however, little emphasis is placed on the language program by the
administration. One symptom of this lack of emphasis is the
treatment of the German teachers.
We have three German teachers for approximately seventy students
(a group usually consists of eighty students); they are all well-qualified
and have been excellent teachers. They are all native-speaking German
people, which is a great advantage for language instruction, and they
all know English very well. Their educational backgrounds are
impressive. One teacher has studied at Mount Holyoke, taught at
Oberlin, and is now working for a doctorate at the University of
Vienna. Another has taught at the University of Chicago for one year,
at Canterbury in England for four years, and has been certified as an
English-German translator. Another is working for a doctorate at the
University of Vienna and has been teaching at Stanford in Austria
since its establishment five years ago.
Heavy Workload
The workload which these teachers carry at Stanford in Austria is
extremely heavy. Although there are classes only four days a week,
the teachers still have between 12 and 15 hours of classes a week,
depending on the teacher, and not all of these classes are easily
prepared grammar classes. In fact, most of the classes involve
conversation, practical texts, literature, and drama, where grammar is
only incidentally involved, and even grammar classes usually include
much more than just grammar. Each one of these classes requires
therefore a substantial amount of preparation.
In comparison, even the lowest teachers at the University of Vienna
must prepare for only eight (8) hours of classes per week at the most.
TAs at Stanford seldom have any more than eight hours of classes a
week, and most of them have four or five hours a week. Needless to
say, this heavy workload makes it impossible for our teachers to give
personal attention to people who need extra help, and it is impossible
to obtain any kind of a varied course of German study or any
Independent Study Program with the teachers on this campus.
Pay Poor
The teachers here are also paid very poorly, even by Austrian
standards. The lowest paid teacher here is paid by Stanford 7,700

Austrian Schilling per month (US $308) before taxes. By comparison,
an Austrian Gymnasium teacher (roughly equivalent to an American
high school teacher) earns almost as much, approximately 4,300
Schillings after taxes, and the lowest Austrian university teachers earn
50% more, approximately 9,000 Schillings after taxes. TAs at
Stanford in California probably don't earn any more than the German
teachers here, but they don't have as heavy a workload, they are
generally not as well qualified, and they receive tuition benefits.
This unusually low salary makes it very hard for the teachers to
support themselves, especially since they live in Vienna, which, like all
metropolitan centers, is relatively expensive, and some of the teachers
must have additional tutorial positions on the side to supplement their
income. The pay is so bad that some of the teachers feel that they will
have to go somewhere else as soon as they receive their doctoral
degrees.
Helpful Teachers
In spite of the bad working conditions, the teachers have been very
interested in us and they have gone out of their way to help us, not
only with German, but also with our contact with Austrian society.
For example, one teacher conducts a drama class which requires many
hours of voluntary rehearsal time. The students have really enjoyed
this.
Another teacher keeps people informed of local art exhibitions,
theater productions, and other cultural events, and on her days off
shows people around some of the many interesting museums in
Vienna. They have introduced students to other Viennese, and they
have invited students into their own homes. The German teachers
provide the first and in many ways the most significant contact that
we have with Austrian society.
There are a number of conclusions which can be drawn from this
situation. The German teachers should be paid much better
considering the job they are assigned to do and the efforts which they
make on their own to help us. They should at least be paid according
to the Austrian standard, but they should really be paid more because
of the extreme importance which they have to this program.
More German Teachers
More importantly, there should be at least one or two more
German teachers at the Austrian campus. The present workloads are
inhumanly heavy and make individual treatment and independent
programs impossible. I personally attempted to arrange a directed
reading and writing program in addition to my regular language classes
and, although it was approved by one of the teachers (even though she
was already overworked), it was not approved by the academic

director here or the Overseas Campus Office on the grounds that there
were not enough German teachers. That is true, and we should have
more German teachers instead of less flexibility.

Austrian Schilling per month (US $308) before taxes. By comparison,
an Austrian Gymnasium teacher (roughly equivalent to an American
high school teacher) earns almost as much, approximately 4,300
Schillings after taxes, and the lowest Austrian university teachers earn
50% more, approximately 9,000 Schillings after taxes. TAs at
Stanford in California probably don't earn any more than the German
teachers here, but they don't have as heavy a workload, they are
generally not as well qualified, and they receive tuition benefits.
This unusually low salary makes it very hard for the teachers to
support themselves, especially since they live in Vienna, which, like all
metropolitan centers, is relatively expensive, and some of the teachers
must have additional tutorial positions on the side to supplement their
income. The pay is so bad that some of the teachers feel that they will
have to go somewhere else as soon as they receive their doctoral
degrees.
Helpful Teachers
In spite of the bad working conditions, the teachers have been very
interested in us and they have gone out of their way to help us, not
only with German, but also with our contact with Austrian society.
For example, one teacher conducts a drama class which requires many
hours of voluntary rehearsal time. The students have really enjoyed
this.
Another teacher keeps people informed of local art exhibitions,
theater productions, and other cultural events, and on her days off
shows people around some of the many interesting museums in
Vienna. They have introduced students to other Viennese, and they
have invited students into their own homes. The German teachers
provide the first and in many ways the most significant contact that
we have with Austrian society.
There are a number of conclusions which can be drawn from this
situation. The German teachers should be paid much better
considering the job they are assigned to do and the efforts which they
make on their own to help us. They should at least be paid according
to the Austrian standard, but they should really be paid more because
of the extreme importance which they have to this program.
More German Teachers
More importantly, there should be at least one or two more
German teachers at the Austrian campus. The present workloads are
inhumanly heavy and make individual treatment and independent
programs impossible. I personally attempted to arrange a directed
reading and writing program in addition to my regular language classes
and, although it was approved by one of the teachers (even though she
was already overworked), it was not approved by the academic

director here or the Overseas Campus Office on the grounds that there
were not enough German teachers. That is true, and we should have
more German teachers instead of less flexibility.
There should be a generally better attitude on the part of the
administration towards the German teachers. At the present time,
they are "second-rate" citizens, and are controlled in a very
authoritarian manner by the rather conservative academic director.
They should be given more support by the administration for
extracurricular activities. It was only after a bitter fight that they were
able to obtain something less than ten dollars per month per teacher
front the Overseas Campus Office for projects outside of the
classroom.
More Flexibility
These changes, I think, would improve the program in Austria
greatly. The German teachers would receive the more human
treatment that they deserve. The students would also be able to
receive more help from the German teachers, both in class and out.
The academic program would be able to be much more flexible and
this would make the students" stay in Austria more interesting. It
would enable the students to strengthen their command of the
German language, which would make contact with Austrian culture
more meaningful and more likely. The German teachers would be able
to do much more to encourage exposure to the Austrian culture. In
fact it is possible that an Austrian teacher could be exchanged for a
German teacher from the home campus. This would give the German
TA from Palo Alto an invaluable opportunity to work on a doctorate,
and the Austrian teacher could be very helpful in orienting future
Austria groups on the home campus for the Overseas Campus Office.
Necessary Changes
I think that these changes are necessary if Stanford in Austria is to
become an exciting, interesting experience again. And I am convinced
that these changes could be accomplished by re-allocating funds
within the Overseas Campus Program. For example, the assistant to
the director of this campus earns almost twice as much when room
and board for him and his wife are included as the German teachers.
He has only a B.A. and is sometimes not necessary. And, after all,
every time Robert Walker comes to visit us in Vienna, he stays in the
Imperial Hotel, the most expensive hotel in Vienna, where the
cheapest rooms cost 530 Austrian Schillings (US $20). That is very
high for Austria and is, indicently, more than two days' pay for one of
our German teachers.
(William Smart is a Judicial Representative at Austria IX)
One of the most important aspects of any overseas experience is
language ability. Without a thorough command of the language, any
meaningful cultural contact is impossible. In order to make this
contact possible, the Overseas Campus Program avowedly administers
a series of "intensive" language programs which will enable a student
to at least master basic grammar and T vocabulary. This cannot be
learned otherwise in more informal contacts with natives. In Vienna,
however, little emphasis is placed on the language program by the
administration. One symptom of this lack of emphasis is the
treatment of the German teachers.
We have three German teachers for approximately seventy students
(a group usually consists of eighty students); they are all well-qualified
and have been excellent teachers. They are all native-speaking German
people, which is a great advantage for language instruction, and they
all know English very well. Their educational backgrounds are
impressive. One teacher has studied at Mount Holyoke, taught at
Oberlin, and is now working for a doctorate at the University of
Vienna. Another has taught at the University of Chicago for one year,
at Canterbury in England for four years, and has been certified as an
English-German translator. Another is working for a doctorate at the
University of Vienna and has been teaching at Stanford in Austria
since its establishment five years ago.
Heavy Workload
The workload which these teachers carry at Stanford in Austria is
extremely heavy. Although there are classes only four days a week,
the teachers still have between 12 and 15 hours of classes a week,
depending on the teacher, and not all of these classes are easily
prepared grammar classes. In fact, most of the classes involve
conversation, practical texts, literature, and drama, where grammar is
only incidentally involved, and even grammar classes usually include
much more than just grammar. Each one of these classes requires
therefore a substantial amount of preparation.
In comparison, even the lowest teachers at the University of Vienna
must prepare for only eight (8) hours of classes per week at the most.
TAs at Stanford seldom have any more than eight hours of classes a
week, and most of them have four or five hours a week. Needless to
say, this heavy workload makes it impossible for our teachers to give
personal attention to people who need extra help, and it is impossible
to obtain any kind of a varied course of German study or any
Independent Study Program with the teachers on this campus.

The teachers here are also paid very poorly, even by Austrian
