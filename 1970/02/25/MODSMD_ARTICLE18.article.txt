WASHINGTON—It was only after
Jackie Kennedy Onassis' letters to
former Deputy Secretary of
Defense Roswell Gilpatric were
lifted from his safe that anyone
realized the market value of
Jackie's stolen letters.
A few days after the publicity
of Mrs. Onassis' letters a man
walked into my office and said he
had four letters he would like to
sell me. written by Ros Gilpatric.
"To Jackie Kennedy Onassis?"
I asked.
"No," he said. "To Mrs. Robert
McNamara. They were stolen
from her bureau drawer and
concern a surprise party Gilpatric
was planning for Robert
McNamara."
"That doesn't seem to have
much value," I said.
Dear Ros
"Are you crazy?" he said.
"They were written by the man to
whom Jackie Kennedy wrote
'Dear Ros."
"How much are they?" I asked.
"Five-hundred dollars for the
four of them," he said, "and you
ask no questions how I got them."
"That's too much money," I
said.
"All right," he said. "How
about four letters Mrs. McNamara
wrote to Averell Harriman on his
75th birthdav?"

"What are you asking for
those?"
"Four-hundred dollars."
"You've got to be kidding."
"You mean to say you would
not be willing to pay $400 to own
the letters of the woman to whom
Roswell Gilpatric wrote before
Jackie Kennedy wrote to him?"
"Well, I didn't exactly say
that."
jealous Anger
"I could have gone elsewhere
with these," he said, sticking them
back in his pocket and pulling out
another set of letters. "Now these
are letters Averell Harriman wrote
to the New York State
Democratic Party asking them to
unite behind somebody—any
body. They were slipped to me by
Mrs. Harriman in a moment of
jealous anger. I'm asking $300 for
them."
"You're a thief," I cried.
"A thief, am I? Do you realize
these letters were written by the
man who received letters from the
woman who owned letters from
the man whom Jackie Kennedy
Onassis thanked for sending her a
slim volume of poems?"
Lots of Coins
Don't go," I begged. "It's just
that $300 is a lot of money."
"All right, then," he said,
opening his valise. "For $200 I
will sell you 10 letters from the

New York State Democratic
Party, asking for contributions to
draft Authur Goldberg for
governor of New York. Before
you protest, I would like to
remind you that you would own
the'letters of a party to whom the
man to whom the woman to
whom the man to whom Mrs.
Kennedy Onassis once wrote
'With my love, Jackie."
"Do you have anything
cheaper?"
Would You Believe
"Here are some letters from
Arthur Goldberg for $100. These
letters, all authenticated, were
sent out by Mr. Goldberg, denying
he had any ambitions to run for
governor. If you can't afford the
Gilpatric letters I'd advise you
buy these."
"But they're so far removed
from the Jackie Kennedy Onassis
letters."
"How can you say that?" he
said. "They were written by the
man who was supported by the
party which was appealed to by
the man who received a birthday
greeting from the woman who
received four letters from the man
who was the owner of the original
letters written by Jackie Kennedy
Onassis from the Yacht Christina
the day after her marriage to
Onassis. What the heck do you
want for a hundred dollars?"
