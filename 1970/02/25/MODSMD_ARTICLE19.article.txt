### 
A Balanced Viewpoint
Editor, THE DAILY:
During the past four and a half
years (the time I have been on this
campus), I have seen the quality
of the Daily rise and fall. During
the past few months, I have seen
it sink to a low. I do not think
that the articles contributed by
Pat Mihaly have helped raise the
level of the Daily.
Pretending interest in
"objectivity", her dislike for Israel
and Jews shows through like skin
through a thread-bare garment.
This is her problem, and she must
live with it. However, I do not see
why the Daily is required to share
her problem with its readers.
Her representation of the
Middle-East problem is both
misinformed and unbalanced. I
have seen such misrepresentations
in extremist literature; I do not
expect them to appear in a
university publication.
It seems about time for the
Daily to either raise its standards

or begin to apply them, so that it
reaches the level more reflective
of the caliber of students in
residence at Stanford; otherwise,
it should relinguish its monopoly
on student funds to some other
publication.

Off the Daily
Editor, THE DAILY:
We would like to respond to
your Feb. 20 editorial entitled:
"Off the Rhetoric!" In a very
strong emotional attack on
radicals, we find 2 key sentences
which expose the defense of
capitalism which underlies the
entire editorial:
Stereotypes allow upper-middle
class radicals to hate people and
create enemies—to villify the
lower and middle class police. It
would not be going too far to
describe this hatred as elitist
bigotry.
There are probably 20 flaws in
those 2 sentences, some of which
must be intentional, but the most
interesting and dangerous is the
characterization of police as lower
and middle class and of radicals as
upper middle class elitist bigots.
This analysis is based upon a
sophisticated distortion of Marxist
class anlaysis and some direct lies.
It suggest that radicals' hatred of
police springs from a class
antagonism—rich kids deriding
lower classes.
It is true that police are
generally drawn from the very
worst aspects of the lower and
middle classes, and that the
Stanford elite is definitely
upper-middle class. However
Marxian analysis doesn't
categorize people on the basis of
their birthrites. That is a
pre-feudal concept which has its
counter part in the ideology of
capitalism.
People are not born into
classes; rather they move into
various functional roles within a
society which determines their
class relation to society. People
like Che, Mao, and Ho were also
what the Daily would call upper
middle class elitist bigots. Yet
history proves the Daily wrong:
the proletarian role of the
revolutionary thru out prople's
history speaks for itself. The Daily
editors' stereotype may fit the
cop-out or the social drop out,
but it doesn't fit Stanford
activists, many of whom have
already left the University to do
full-time organizing.
Police are human beings who
are well-paid hired pawns of the
ruling class and the upper middle

class elite. Because their job is to
keep the people down, especially
workers, young people and
minority groups, and to protect
the property and interest of the
moneyed elite, they are traitors to
their class of the worst kind. It is
exactly because they are such
brutal betrayers to their class and
oppressors of their brothers and
sisters that people can celebrate
and dence over the death of a pig.
The enemy is the ruling class,
the tiny minority of men who run
this country and others for their
own profit and the self-interest of
their class, at the expense and
oppression of the majority of the
people of the world. The people
caught in the middle between the
oppressed and the oppressor are
not the enemy, unless they have
taken sides with the ruling class
and actively more against the
people. The pigs have proven in
atrocity after atrocity (Fred
Hampton, Los Siete, Chicago
convention, Peoples Park) whose
interests they are willing and eager
to lie and murder for. Anyone
who stands in defense of class
tyranny can expect to be treated
as the enemy. OFF THE PIGS!

You 're Perfect
Editor, THE DAILY:
A lot of misstatements have
been made about The Stanford
Employees Association, (S.E.A.).
We are very much alive and
working for the Stanford Staff
Community.
We have been meeting with the
administration and having
meaningful discussions once a
month for the last one and a half
years.
The grievance procedure now
used by all employees was written
by the membership of S.E.A. and
adopted by the University early in
1969, and is now known as Guide
Memo 22:10. We, of S.E.A. have
successfully processed in excess of
one hundred cases, here on
campus and at SLAC, with a
better than 99% success; i.e. only
one man out of all was turned
down with just cause. Other items
discussed with the administration,
some of which have become
realities are; minimum wages,
vacation, meaningful classification
studies, paid health insurance
plans, a more equitable pension
plan, uniforms provided by the
employer where applicable,
tuition waivers, pay differential
for night-time employees, meals
to be provided by the employer
for all employees in food service,

abolishment of ethnic
discrimination in all areas.
It disturbs me that various
publications distributed on the
campus are making false
statements regarding the status of
employees at the Physical Plant
and S.E.A., as related to the
University itself. For example: No
gardener or laborer earns less than
$500. per month. No employee
has been dismissed without just
cause within the last two years;
since the founding of S.E.A. We
have also been assured that no
shops will be closed in the
forseeable future.
This was all done in a genteel
manner during the monthly ,
meetings with the admonistration.
There was no table pounding,
demanding, or coercive tactics
used. There was no loss of time to
the employee, or loss of time or
services to the University, as a
result of these meetings.
We are proud of our
contributions to the students and
faculty in creating an atmosphere
conducive to study and research,
yet never surrendering our rights
to question. We have always been,
and hopefully will always be, an
association for progressive,
realistic ideas, and welcome the
thoughts and suggestions of the
staff community. We are here to
help all employees of Stanford
University. Without appearing
redundant, we of S.E.A. are here
for the mutual benefit of all
employees and the University.
Mike Fineo
President, S.E.A.
