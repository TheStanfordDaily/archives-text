effected this quarter in Florence Moore, and the
more recent abortive attempt to move female
boarders into the Phi Gamma Delta house, that
co-eding has gotten out of hand.
Mid-year co-eding is not necessarily
symptomatic of residential chaos. It is, however, a
very tricky business.
Basically, the problems of mid-year co-eding can
be separated into two categories - those of
University residences and those of fraternities.
Configuration A Basis
In a dormitory, particularly in the case of a
freshman dormitory, residents have drawn into the
midst of a group of people most likely using the
configuration on the residence (all-female,
all-male, all classes, co-ed, or whatever) as a
primary factor in their decision.
It is premarily within the framework of the
residence configuration that a dorm develops a
character. The interaction or residents in the dorm
is the dynamic factor that shapes a distinct
character and the residents will most likely
develop most easily in a living situation which they
originally chose.
There is, also, a responsibility on the
University's part to be able to assure students that
a residence will retain throughout the academic
year the form it took at the beginning of fall
quarter. Dean of Students Peter Bulkeley
expressed his view of this responsibility saying, "I
think people ought to know their housing
arrangements at the beginning of the year and not
be subjected to change at the whims of others."
Freshman Residences Different
All of the above are persuasive arguments for
retaining an all-class or upper-class dorm in its
beginning of the year form. Freshman residences,
however, present a different problem, which is
simply that residence configurations are chosen
without the benefit of any previous Stanford living
experience.
On the small scale, it would be very possible for
the University to institute a mechanism whereby
freshmen have the option of a mid-year housing
configuration choice. The co-eding of Loro and
