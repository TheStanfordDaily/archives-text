# Seeger â€“ Snow Concert Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tomorrow in the Art
Auditorium, traditional folk
music comes to Stanford in the
guise of Mike Seeger and John
"Kilby" Snow. Since the late
1950'5, Mike Seeger has been one
of the leading performer-collect
ors of traditional music and
spokesman for the urban
application and study of music of
the southern Appalachian region.
Seeger (brother of Pete Seeger)
has been one of the central
members of the New Lost City
Ramblers since 1951, has 4 LP
albums of his own as well as
participating in some 20 other
" albums, and is undoubtedly one
of the best talents on the
American folk music scene today.
Playing with Seeger is John
"Kilby" Snow, autoharpist
extraordinaire, who hails from
Grayson County, Virginia and
draws most of his musical talent

from the Virginia area. During the
past five years, he has moved
stylistically more towards the area
of Bluegrass music and is certainly
the "most Bluegrass" of all the
autoharpists both in choice of
material and in his driving melodic
and rhythmic treatment of it. He
has participated in one LP and
will soon have his own solo LP
out.
These two musicians, playing
together, should provide Stanford
with an exciting and very
different evening of music that
should not be missed. The
concert, scheduled for 8 p.m. in
the Art Auditorium, is going to be
a musical educational experience.
Tickets are $2.00 at the door.
Advance tickets are available at
Tresidder. Seeger and Snow will
also give a guitar and banjo
workshop in the Afternoon in the
Tresidder Coffeehouse.
