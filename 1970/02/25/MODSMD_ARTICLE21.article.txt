# WL Child Care Center Discussion
## 
### ELANOR KAPLAN 
Over the past two months
Women's Liberation has been
circulating petitions for a child
care facility here at Stanford. As
conceived by Women's Liberation
the center would be free to
Stanford Employees, Students,
and Faculty. We have also asked
the administration to make the
soon to be vacated Stanford
Elementary School available for
the Child Care Center.
On Thursday February 12th
(appropriately Abe Lincoln's
Birthday) Women's Liberation
sponsored a birthday party in
celebration of the potential
creation of such a Child Care
Facility. Several hundred parents,

employees, students, and children
joined with us in celebrating the
occasion. That afternoon
Women's Liberation presented
President Pitzer with the signed
petitions (over 1000 signatures
were gathered by then.)
Ever since the Birthday Party
many people from the community
have asked for additional
information about plans for the
facility. In order to clarify our
position as well as to entertain
suggestions from the Stanford
community, Women's Liberation
and the USE Women's Caucus will
jointly sponsor a symposium on
Child Care to be held: Thursday
Evening, February 26th at 8 P.M.
in Bishop Auditorium. Free Child
Care will be available in Bishop
for children of those attending the
symposium.
The program will consist of
three speakers: Laura Neese, who
will talk about Women's
Liberation in general and why we
are interested in Child Care; Jane
Franklin who will speak about the
history of the family, in particular
about women and children within
the family structure lastly, Nora
Bennett, teacher at the present
Children's Center (located at the
Convalescent Home) will tell us
about the present Nursery and
Day Care programs. Following the
speakers we will invite discussion
from the floor.
All are invited to attend.

post doctoral fellow in
Psychology and a member of
