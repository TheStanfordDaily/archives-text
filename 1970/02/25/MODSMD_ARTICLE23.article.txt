# New Stanford Women's Group
## NOW Chapter Formed 
### SARA GERLING 
Approximately 25 women and men met at
Tresidder Thursday night to discuss the-formation
of a Stanford area chapter of NOW, the National
Organization for Women, described as "an
organization pledged to work actively to bring
women into full participation in the mainstream of
society". Discussion at the meeting centered
around the implementation of this idea at
Stanford.
Susan Diamondstone, interim chairman for the
chapter, explained that NOW is an attempt to alter
the system by working within it, and that a
primary activity of the Stanford chapter would be
to study proposals for presentation to the
Committee on Education and Employment for
Women.
The charge to the Committee was read by Judy
Fair, one of the three staff representatives. She
commented that the Committee is expected to
present detailed recommendations in a variety of
fields, but is made up of people who are
already busy: full-time students, faculty and staff.
Therefore, research and suggestion generated by
other organizations and individuals are vital to the
fulfillment of the Committee's purpose.
When the meeting was thrown open for
discussion of areas of concern, primary interest
focused around three points: (1) equal
employment, meaning both equal pay for equal
work and equal job opportunity, (2) equal
admissions policies both at the undergraduate and
graduate level, with an end to the 'double
standard', (3) equal treatment in the counseling
and placement services for women students.
The fact that NOW at Stanford is currently a
small group, led to a decision to limit the number

of proposed committees to two, one on grievances
in employment and another on complaints about
the admissions and counseling programs. Since the
chapter is not yet official (a situation requiring ten
paying members), formation of the committees
was put off until a later meeting.
In the course of discussion, several other
campus organizations were mentioned, including
the Professional Women's Forum, Women's Lib,
Professional Women at Stanford Medical School,
Faculty Wives, and USE. One woman asked, "With
all these organizations, what rationale is there for
forming another women's organization?" It was
pointed out that all the groups, except Women's
Liberation, appeal to special interests and that
Women's Lib has its own specialized political
orientation. NOW plans to offer a program to
enlist all those members of the Stanford
Community seeking a rational solution to the
problems at Stanford. Increasing the alternatives
offered to the University is, the organizers of NOW
believe, a way to increase the probability of
positive change. The necessity for research and the
usefulness of an organization so designed was
emphasized.
The meeting closed with an exhortation to all
the attendees to get out and start talking to others.
"We can put notices in the Daily until we turn
blue", Judy Fair said, "but the best way to
convince people that this isn't just another
organization is to talk to them about it yourself."
The next meeting is set for Thursday, February
26, in Tresidder 274 at 8:00 p.m. Anyone who
shares the concerns of NOW and wants to work for
change at Stanford is invited. Do it NOW.

student in genetics, and a member of NOW.)
