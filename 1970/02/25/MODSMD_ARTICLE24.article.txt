# Information Meetings
## Experimental Math Program 
### PHYLLIS COLE 
The Department of
Mathematics will be holding two
information meetings this week
concerning the experimental
program of the undergraduate
math seminars that will start
Spring quarter 1970. They will be
in Room 380-D on February 25 at
12:00 noon and February 26 at
4:15 P.M. The aims of this
seminar in it's action oriented
approach to mathematics will be
discussed by the programs creator
and general director, Professor
Karel deLeeuw. Graduate students
in mathematics that have chosen
to lead the seminars will be there
to discuss the nature of their
groups.
Professor deLeeuw said that
the seminar program will
hopefully provide a necessary
addition to the curriculum of the
undergraduate students in the
Department of Mathematics. This
is the chance it offers the student
to share, through active
involvement in the excitment of
discovery in mathematics. Until
now, there has been only one
course of this temperament made

available to undergraduates, the
Undergraduate Colloquia taught
by Professor Halley. Spring
quarter the new seminar program
will offer the advantages of an
experimental format geared to
active student participation in
groups dealing with such subjects
as Mathematics and Language,
Introduction to Know Theory and
Riemenn Surfaces. The number of
seminars to be offered is growing,
and updated lists of group
descriptions will continue to be
posted in the Mathematics
Department undergraduate
bulletin board.
Both the students and the
graduate students that will teach
the seminars may be expected to
profit from the design of the
program. The graduate students
that have volunteered to teach the
seminars will gain the experience
of planning and developing a
teaching approach to a particular
subject, a chance not given
graduate students when they are
held down to a fixed syllabus,
which is the case in most
departments. The undergraduate
won't be handed the passive role

of merely taking notes in a lecture
course, but will be participating in
and helping decide the direction
of the seminar.
It is hoped that this movement
towards a more extensive use of
the seminar's possibilities will
grow in strength and spread to
other departments as well.
Average Student
The seminars may be taken for
course credit, and will be open to
any undergraduate with the
appropriate background. They are
designed for the average rather
than honors math student, and
there are several courses starting
from a basis of knowledge that
makes them suitable for the
freshman with an average
background in mathematics.
Interested students may submit
suggestions for seminar topics to
Professor deLeeuw or to the
secretary in the Department of
Mathematics. Instructions for
pre-registration and registration
are to enroll in Math 197 and sign
up for the individual seminars on
the sign-up sheet in the academic
office of the Department of
Mathematics, room 381-Rl.
