# Among The Best...
## Frosh Swim Stars Exposed 
### DOUG WILSON 
I remember the afternoon of
the Washington State meet after
the diving, when the Cougars
hadn't won a race yet, which
made Jim Gaughran feel bad,
which in turn made Steve Carey
feel bad. So Carey politely missed
a turn on the anchor leg of the
400 free relay, which the Cougars
then won. The Cougars were
happy to win something, Mr.
Gaughran was happy that they
had won something, and Carey
was happy that everybody else
was happy.
Lest anyone believe that it was
Carey's lack of talent that lost the
race, a glance at the latest
Swimming World time-rankings
will dispel such heresy—the
Fullerton freshman currently
ranks among the top dozen 50
free sprinters in the nation with
:21.8. Against powerful USC, he
took first place in the 50 and a
second in the 100 that all but
clinched the meet for Stanford.
Carey has an easy smile that
has become his trademark, and
the sincerity of it makes you
believe him when he tells you he
got into swimming at a baseball
game. "I was ten, and a friend at
the game convinced me to come
with him to try out for the

neighborhood swim team. We
swam :34.0 for a 40—the coach
said he kept us on for 'C' relays,
since the team was just starting."
Since that time, Carey has aged
a few years, grown a couple of
feet, pared off thirteen seconds
for an additional 10 yards, and
come to Stanford, which he chose
over some 16 other schools,
including Ivy League and Big Ten
powers.
Sparks Fly
Across the dinner table from
Carey sat Tim Broderick,
fascinated with a miniature blue
space gun that shoots real
flint-sparked rays. The space gun
is a novelty from a San Francisco
wharfside store (79c). Broderick is
a distance swimmer from
Philadelphia's Vesper Boat Club
(1:43.8 for the 200).
He is slightly crazy, a fact
which, when combined with his
ability to beat almost anyone
within 200, 500 or 1000 yards of
him, makes Broderick one of the
most popular of all Stanford
swimmers.
Broderick is also a
crowd-pleaser, which is difficult
when you swim races during
which most people take a break
for food, drink, or relief. He likes
to come from behind in events

like the 200 and 500, and the
spectators who stick around are
usually treated to a victory.
"He's demoralizing," said one
Stanford timer as Broderick
caught league-leading Jeff
Schufreider of Washington to win
the 200 on the final lap. "UCLA
was out of the meet when
Broderick beat O'Malley"
explained USC Coach Peter
Daland of the performance which
earned the Vesper Boat Club's
oldest active veteran the
fourth-ranked spot in the nation
in the 200.
Broderick chose Stanford over
USC and Penn State "because
Stanford has everything. If it
wasn't for swimming, I'd still be
at college, but not at Stanford.
Although," he articulated through
a mouthful of Branner mystery
meat, "when I started swimming I
became a better student."
(Really!)
At the head of the table,
oblivious to most of the
discussion, sat a mechanical
engineering major from
Courtland, Ohio. Brian Job is
better known as the fastest
breaststroker in the country. Job
sits on top of the breaststroke
rankings where he has been every
week this season, only this week it
is with a new NCAA record.
Against UCLA, Job clocked
2:08.7. He has not lost a
breaststroke race this season.
While coaches and fans marvel
at his re cord-setting efforts, Job
sees himself as somewhat of a
klutz. "I've always been

accident-prone," he says. "Two
summers ago, I was screwing
around on the diving board at the
Nationals in Indiana and I slipped
and got a compression fracture,"
which means he broke his neck.
After complete recovery, Job
decided to train with Santa Clara's
George Haines, for whom he's
been swimming the last few
summers.
"But something's gone wrong
before every nationals," he
explained after recounting the
story of how a horse had fallen on
him, "otherwise I wouldn't swim
well."
Should Job manage to steer
clear of horses, steep cliffs and
Vietnam, he will v ikely win
the breaststroke rt i at the
NCAA Championship!, in Utah
next month, and set new records
in winning. Job's personal best is a
2:06.1 swum in AAU
competition, a time he hopes to
better next month.
He is an easygoing guy, but he
takes his swimming seriously.
"You can't possibly have done
something for 10 years and not
have it dominate your life," he
says.
What Jim Gaughran got in
Steve Carey, Tim Broderick, and
Brian Job was three of the finest
swimmers in the country. He also
got three of the most likeable and
personable freshmen around.


PICTURE—In fairness to all three freshman swimmers featured below, the DAILY had arranged for pictures of each to
appear in this space. That was before difficulties arose. So fresh from the file drawer comes Brian Job, above. Tim
Broderick and Steve (larey, as all conscientious swim fans are aware, are real people who continue to swim very well.

2:08.7. He has not lost a
breaststroke race this season.
While coaches and fans marvel
at his re cord-setting efforts, Job
sees himself as somewhat of a
klutz. "I've always been

accident-prone," he says. "Two
summers ago, I was screwing
around on the diving board at the
Nationals in Indiana and I slipped
and got a compression fracture,"
which means he broke his neck.
After complete recovery, Job
decided to train with Santa Clara's
George Haines, for whom he's
been swimming the last few
summers.
"But something's gone wrong
before every nationals," he
explained after recounting the
story of how a horse had fallen on
him, "otherwise I wouldn't swim
well."
Should Job manage to steer
clear of horses, steep cliffs and
Vietnam, he will v ikely win
the breaststroke rt i at the
NCAA Championship!, in Utah
next month, and set new records
in winning. Job's personal best is a
2:06.1 swum in AAU
competition, a time he hopes to
better next month.
He is an easygoing guy, but he
takes his swimming seriously.
"You can't possibly have done
something for 10 years and not
have it dominate your life," he
says.
What Jim Gaughran got in
Steve Carey, Tim Broderick, and
Brian Job was three of the finest
swimmers in the country. He also
got three of the most likeable and
personable freshmen around.


PICTURE—In fairness to all three freshman swimmers featured below, the DAILY had arranged for pictures of each to
appear in this space. That was before difficulties arose. So fresh from the file drawer comes Brian Job, above. Tim
Broderick and Steve (larey, as all conscientious swim fans are aware, are real people who continue to swim very well.
I remember the afternoon of
the Washington State meet after
the diving, when the Cougars
hadn't won a race yet, which
made Jim Gaughran feel bad,
which in turn made Steve Carey
feel bad. So Carey politely missed
a turn on the anchor leg of the
400 free relay, which the Cougars
then won. The Cougars were
happy to win something, Mr.
Gaughran was happy that they
had won something, and Carey
was happy that everybody else
was happy.
Lest anyone believe that it was
Carey's lack of talent that lost the
race, a glance at the latest
Swimming World time-rankings
will dispel such heresy—the
Fullerton freshman currently
ranks among the top dozen 50
free sprinters in the nation with
:21.8. Against powerful USC, he
took first place in the 50 and a
second in the 100 that all but
clinched the meet for Stanford.
Carey has an easy smile that
has become his trademark, and
the sincerity of it makes you
believe him when he tells you he
got into swimming at a baseball
game. "I was ten, and a friend at
the game convinced me to come
with him to try out for the

neighborhood swim team. We
swam :34.0 for a 40—the coach
said he kept us on for 'C' relays,
since the team was just starting."
Since that time, Carey has aged
a few years, grown a couple of
feet, pared off thirteen seconds
for an additional 10 yards, and
come to Stanford, which he chose
over some 16 other schools,
including Ivy League and Big Ten
powers.
Sparks Fly
Across the dinner table from
Carey sat Tim Broderick,
fascinated with a miniature blue
space gun that shoots real
flint-sparked rays. The space gun
is a novelty from a San Francisco
wharfside store (79c). Broderick is
a distance swimmer from
Philadelphia's Vesper Boat Club
(1:43.8 for the 200).
He is slightly crazy, a fact
which, when combined with his
ability to beat almost anyone
within 200, 500 or 1000 yards of
him, makes Broderick one of the
most popular of all Stanford
swimmers.
Broderick is also a
crowd-pleaser, which is difficult
when you swim races during
which most people take a break
for food, drink, or relief. He likes
to come from behind in events

like the 200 and 500, and the
spectators who stick around are
usually treated to a victory.
"He's demoralizing," said one
Stanford timer as Broderick
caught league-leading Jeff
Schufreider of Washington to win
the 200 on the final lap. "UCLA
was out of the meet when
Broderick beat O'Malley"
explained USC Coach Peter
Daland of the performance which
earned the Vesper Boat Club's
oldest active veteran the
fourth-ranked spot in the nation
in the 200.
Broderick chose Stanford over
USC and Penn State "because
Stanford has everything. If it
wasn't for swimming, I'd still be
at college, but not at Stanford.
Although," he articulated through
a mouthful of Branner mystery
meat, "when I started swimming I
became a better student."
(Really!)
At the head of the table,
oblivious to most of the
discussion, sat a mechanical
engineering major from
Courtland, Ohio. Brian Job is
better known as the fastest
breaststroker in the country. Job
sits on top of the breaststroke
rankings where he has been every
week this season, only this week it
is with a new NCAA record.
Against UCLA, Job clocked
2:08.7. He has not lost a
breaststroke race this season.

Philadelphia's Vesper Boat Club
(1:43.8 for the 200).
He is slightly crazy, a fact
which, when combined with his
ability to beat almost anyone
within 200, 500 or 1000 yards of
him, makes Broderick one of the
most popular of all Stanford
swimmers.
Broderick is also a
crowd-pleaser, which is difficult
when you swim races during
which most people take a break
for food, drink, or relief. He likes
to come from behind in events

like the 200 and 500, and the
spectators who stick around are
usually treated to a victory.
"He's demoralizing," said one
Stanford timer as Broderick
caught league-leading Jeff
Schufreider of Washington to win
the 200 on the final lap. "UCLA
was out of the meet when
Broderick beat O'Malley"
explained USC Coach Peter
Daland of the performance which
earned the Vesper Boat Club's
oldest active veteran the
fourth-ranked spot in the nation
in the 200.
Broderick chose Stanford over
USC and Penn State "because
Stanford has everything. If it
wasn't for swimming, I'd still be
at college, but not at Stanford.
Although," he articulated through
a mouthful of Branner mystery
meat, "when I started swimming I
became a better student."
(Really!)
At the head of the table,
oblivious to most of the
discussion, sat a mechanical
engineering major from
Courtland, Ohio. Brian Job is
better known as the fastest
breaststroker in the country. Job
sits on top of the breaststroke
rankings where he has been every
week this season, only this week it
is with a new NCAA record.
Against UCLA, Job clocked
2:08.7. He has not lost a
breaststroke race this season.
While coaches and fans marvel
at his re cord-setting efforts, Job
sees himself as somewhat of a
klutz. "I've always been

accident-prone," he says. "Two
summers ago, I was screwing
around on the diving board at the
Nationals in Indiana and I slipped
and got a compression fracture,"
which means he broke his neck.
After complete recovery, Job
decided to train with Santa Clara's
George Haines, for whom he's
been swimming the last few
summers.
"But something's gone wrong
before every nationals," he
explained after recounting the
story of how a horse had fallen on
him, "otherwise I wouldn't swim
well."
Should Job manage to steer
clear of horses, steep cliffs and
Vietnam, he will v ikely win
the breaststroke rt i at the
NCAA Championship!, in Utah
next month, and set new records
in winning. Job's personal best is a
2:06.1 swum in AAU
competition, a time he hopes to
better next month.
He is an easygoing guy, but he
takes his swimming seriously.
"You can't possibly have done
something for 10 years and not
have it dominate your life," he
says.
What Jim Gaughran got in
Steve Carey, Tim Broderick, and
Brian Job was three of the finest
swimmers in the country. He also
got three of the most likeable and
personable freshmen around.


PICTURE—In fairness to all three freshman swimmers featured below, the DAILY had arranged for pictures of each to
appear in this space. That was before difficulties arose. So fresh from the file drawer comes Brian Job, above. Tim
Broderick and Steve (larey, as all conscientious swim fans are aware, are real people who continue to swim very well.
I remember the afternoon of
the Washington State meet after
the diving, when the Cougars
hadn't won a race yet, which
made Jim Gaughran feel bad,
which in turn made Steve Carey
feel bad. So Carey politely missed
a turn on the anchor leg of the
400 free relay, which the Cougars
then won. The Cougars were
happy to win something, Mr.
Gaughran was happy that they
had won something, and Carey
was happy that everybody else
was happy.
Lest anyone believe that it was
Carey's lack of talent that lost the
race, a glance at the latest
Swimming World time-rankings
will dispel such heresy—the
Fullerton freshman currently
ranks among the top dozen 50
free sprinters in the nation with
:21.8. Against powerful USC, he
took first place in the 50 and a
second in the 100 that all but
clinched the meet for Stanford.
Carey has an easy smile that
has become his trademark, and
the sincerity of it makes you
believe him when he tells you he
got into swimming at a baseball
game. "I was ten, and a friend at
the game convinced me to come
with him to try out for the

neighborhood swim team. We
swam :34.0 for a 40—the coach
said he kept us on for 'C' relays,
since the team was just starting."
Since that time, Carey has aged
a few years, grown a couple of
feet, pared off thirteen seconds
for an additional 10 yards, and
come to Stanford, which he chose
over some 16 other schools,
including Ivy League and Big Ten
powers.
Sparks Fly
Across the dinner table from
Carey sat Tim Broderick,
fascinated with a miniature blue
space gun that shoots real
flint-sparked rays. The space gun
is a novelty from a San Francisco
wharfside store (79c). Broderick is
a distance swimmer from
Philadelphia's Vesper Boat Club
(1:43.8 for the 200).
He is slightly crazy, a fact
