# Ruggers Annihilate Canadian Visitors
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
The members of the University
of British Colombia's rugby team
disproved the old saying that a
drowning man comes up for air
three times before going under.
They came up four times.
But at the end of the full
eighty minutes, Stanford's
relentless wave of red shirts had
surged across their goal line eleven
times and Leon Hartvickson had
boomed nine conversions to give
the Indians an incredible 51
points to ÜBC's 14.
It was a long road trip for the
ÜBC Thunderbirds, who, after
two losses to UCLA in West wood,
saw Jack Lasater sweep right for a
try on the very first play of the
game. Hartvickson's kick, the first
of seven in a row, was perfect.
Following a five yard scrum in
the Stanford end, a ÜBC back
drop-kicked three points through
the uprights to narrow the margin
to 5-3.
But the Indians charged right
back with Jack Shultz taking a
pass from Don Bunce in for the
try and then Bunce himself doing
the honors, breaking several
tackles on his way to the goal line.
Stanford was caught offside
just as the half ended and ÜBC
surfaced again for a three point
penalty kick to make the score
15-6.
Don Bunce didn't return to the
Stanford lineup following the half
after aggravating an injury
incurred earlier in the season, and
Reggie Sanderson came in at wing
replacing Jack Shultz who filled
for Bunce.
Breakaway Pat Preston blocked
a kick as the ÜBC fullback
attempted to punt out of his own

end, and in the ensuing scramble
in the end zone, Chuck Williams
came up with the ball and the try.
Hartvickson was on target with his
fourth consecutive conversion.
Williams gave Hartvickson an
opportunity for number five
moments later as he snaked
through a crowd and sprinted for
the goal posts with his second try
of the day.
With the score 35-9,
Sanderson, a promising football
prospect, broke inside the line of
ÜBC blue shirts, and on a brilliant
effort, running away from and
over people, bowled his way into
the corner for a try. Hartvickson's
string was finally broken as he was
wide with the conversion from a
tough angle.
Sinking fast, ÜBC rallied for
their only try of the game, which
came off a loose ruck in front of
the Stanford goal posts.
With the game all but over,
everybody got into the scoring
act. Second row man, Ron
Kadziel, trailing the play, took a
pass from Jim Kauffman, muscled
his way across the goal stripe and
Hartvickson found the mark to
make it 43-14.
Then Pat Preston found
himself all alone with the ball in
the Thunderbird backfield. As the
fullback came up to meet him,
Preston dumped the ball off to
Jerry Dover, who relayed it to Bill
Buckland, another scrum man,
who downed it for the try.
Just as he had begun it all, Jack
Lasater finished the scoring on the
last play of the game with his
second try, and Hartvickson
added the capper making the final
score 51-14.
Berkeley is next.
