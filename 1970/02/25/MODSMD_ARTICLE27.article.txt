### JOHN ARTHUR 
With a warm, summer sun
beaming down and a gentle wind
wafting in from right field, the
varsity baseball team breezed to
an easy 7-0 win over San
Francisco State yesterday
afternoon at Sunken Diamond.
The triumph, the Tribe's ninth
in ten decisions this spring, was
assured by the fifth inning, when
the Indians had moved in front
5-0. Sophomore right-hander Bob
Kammeyer worked the first five
frames, allowing one hit and no
runs.
Soph transfer Tom Changnon
took over in the sixth and finished
up. He fanned three and gave up
three hits.
At the plate, junior Curt Fant
continued his hot hitting. After
connecting safely five times in
Saturday's double-header, the
centerfielder went two for two
yesterday, with a walk. One of the
hits was a triple to the fence in
right center.

Stanford put three runs on the
board in the fourth when Mike
Ewing looped a two-out single
into right center to drive home
Fant and Steve Dunning, who'd
walked. Ewing stole second, one
of 7 steals for the Tribe on the
day, went to third on Mike
Nelson's infield hit, and scored on
Bob Marshall's single.
Dick Borchers' single drove in
catcher Bob Reece in the fifth,
and the Cards scored again when
Gator pitcher Tony Martinez
walked home a run. Stanford got
another run on Hank Snider's
pinch-hit single in the fifth, and
Bob Wilhelm's two-out single
scored Dunning in the sixth.
