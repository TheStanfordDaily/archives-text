# Washington NLRB To Judge Teamster Recognition Petition
## 
### 
The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) in San Francisco
has sent the Teamsters Union's
petition on behalf of Stanford
Physical Plant workers to the
NLRB head office in Washington,
D.C. for "advice."
Jim Harley, an NLRB
spokesman in San Francisco, told
the Daily yesterday that the
Teamsters' petition was sent to
the Washington office because of
its similarity to "other cases
before the Board." He said that
"it could take a while" before a
decision is reached and relayed
from Washington.
Harley said that the NLRB
would consider the petition in
light of another filed jointly by
Cornell and Syracuse University
asking that the Board take
jurisdiction over labor affairs at
educational institutions.
Nevertheless, Rudy Tham,
Secretary-Treasurer of Local 856,
which is sponsoring the petition,
said yesterday that he believes a
more likely precedent is a 1962
NLRB ruling involving Seton Hall
Military Academy, an East Coast
preparatory school.
Case Expedited
When asked about the Seton
Hall case, Harley said that the
ruling was either listed under a
different name or was listed as a
"secondary boycott case" and
that he could not locate it in the
NLRB's records.
Dwight Beeson, attorney for
Local 856, was unavailable for
comment yesterday afternoon on
the exact nature of the Seton Hall
decision.
Tham said he thought the
NLRB was "expediting" the
petition by sending it directly to
the head office in Washington and
bypassing the possibilities for a
hearing in San Francisco.
Economic Action
The Teamsters filed the
petition a week ago. They seek
representation rights for 150
Physical Plant workers.
When asked what theTeamsters
will do if the NLRB petition fails,
Thai.i said, "We will take
economic action. We will picket
and stop the trucks from making
deliveries to the school. We will
isolate the University until it
moves to recognize us."
He stated, however, that the

Teamsters would not take any
action until the outcome of the
petition is clear. He said that such
steps would be "premature."
Robert M. Nelson, the
University's Director of Personnel
and Employee Relations, said the
University would make no
comment on the petition until the
NLRB renders its decision.

"We will consider this think
(the petition) when the NLRB
gets to it, so for right now, we'll
just sit and wait," he said.
Nelson noted that this fall, the
University joined a group of
California schools asking that the
NLRB maintain its present policy
of refusing jurisdiction where an
educational institution is involved.
