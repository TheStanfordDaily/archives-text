# 'Illogical And Dishonest'
## Lowenstein Denounces Nixon 
### SUSAN MAAS 
"The Moratorium produced a change in the vocabulary of the
national leadership," Congressman Allard K. Lowenstein (D,N.Y.)
stated here Monday.
"Now we have to establish the fact that what the President says is
not what the President does," he said.
Speaking to a student dominated audience of about 300 in
Memorial Church, the organizer of. the 1968 "Dump Johnson"
movement criticized the illogic and dishonesty of the administration,
while exhorting those against the war to "get rid of their self-pity"
and "get involved."
The President is following a policy "not of orderly withdrawal, but
of disorderly staying in Vietnam," according to Lowenstein.
He stated that two factors which Nixon calls essential for U.S.
withdrawal—Vietnamization and reciprocal withdrawal of North
Vietnam are impossible and are simply used as a "canopy for staying
in."
This shows that South Vietnam cannot stand on its own feet
against North Vietnam a smaller country with a supposedly weak and
unpopular government."

Lowenstein argued that the U.S. must leave Vietnam, offer to help
resettle refugees, and allow South Vietnam to negotiate or fight on its
own.
He also accused the administration of making people think that the
country's problems are caused by those who are actually the victims,
and of creating the erroneous feeling among low and middle income
whites that the nation is doing much more for minority groups than is
really being done "We're doing less for low income housing now than
Robert Taft felt should be done in 1946," he added.
Mad Dictator
According to Lowenstein, ABM (anti-ballistic missile) bases are
planned for North Dakota and New Mexico on the reasoning that
some mad Chinese dictator will be so anxious to destroy China that he
will fire atomic missiles at the U.S. without waiting the few extra
years needed for China to develop a counter for the ABM.
Furthermore, the dictator will be so anxious to destroy China that
he will fire the missiles at North Dakota and New Mexico.
The American people, in supporting the ABM, have made a choice
without realizing it, he continued. They have chosen a defense system
in place of something for education, for saving lives, for better
hospital facilities, or for needed housing.
Money For Security
"Where does the Pentagon money go?" the Congressman
questioned. "People think it goes for security, but the U.S. already
has 3,4 27 military bases overseas. Of course, think of all the places
that don't have them!"
Lowenstein claimed that when some Congressmen tried to get four
bases in Spain shut down—bases built for refueling of B42's, of which
the U.S. has none —the Pentagon replied that the bases were needed in
case Spain was attacked.
Of course, Spain did have some colonies in Africa, Lowenstein
commented, "but do they think Ifni will attack Spain?"
Pentagon Money
The Pentagon gets the money it asks for because they say it's
urgent, and if it's classified, then it's more urgent, he complained. In
one night, the Pentagon spent $30-40,000 to fly some generals to
Jackson, Mississippi, for a dinner.
Lowenstein went on to decry the dcieatism r elt by many students.
"If we wait for the President to fall of his own weight, the country
will likely turn to the right when his Vietnam policy fails.
"Think of what it must be like to be a hawk and hear the
vocabulary used by the President," he continued.
"You can't persuade people by spitting on them. We must go to the
people to explain what's going on in this country."
Sociology professor Sanford Dornbusch had opened the session,
criticizing the "cult of mediocrity" spawned by the administration.
