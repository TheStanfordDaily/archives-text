# Chats With Students
## 
### ED KOHN 
Speaking Sunday before an
informal gathering of 15 people in
Tresidder, Rep. Allard K.
Lowenstein said
that he "would sooner accept the
Papacy" than the Chairmanship of
the Democratic National
Committee if it were offered to
him.
A loader of McCarthy's 1968
Presidential campaign, Lowenstein
also discounted the Senator's
proposed third party as a
potential political force.
A Democrat from New York,
Lowenstein was on campus to
deliver an address at Memorial
Church Sunday night in an
attempt to restore flagging

Mid-peninsula support for the
Moratorium and draft repeal.
Sunday afternoon's meeting
received little advance publicity.
Lowenstein, covered a wide
range of issues, mostly related to
student activism, during the
hour-long discussion in Tresidder's
Small Lounge.
Generational Differences
"I wasn't very happy with the
(November) Mobe," he said, "but
I endorsed it after Nixon's Nov. 3
speech.
"Either you were designated a
participant out to change the
mood of the country, or you
could sit back and watch. I had to
move to provide ballast for the
others, which put me into an
awkward position where I either
had to put up or clam up."
Lowenstein was also concerned
about "generational differences."
He stated that the best
characteristic of the present
generation is that "you didn't
accept all that we accepted." He
added that the worst trait of the
younger generation is that "you
show no willingness to dig in for
the long haul; and the whole
country will go to pot - literally,
that is."
He also blasted many of the
1968 campaign workers for their
"self-inflating mythology."
No Staying Power
"The kids did a lot of work,
and I don't want to deny them

that, but the staying power just
wasn't there," Lowenstein said.
The Congressman added that
many campaign workers were
overemphasizing their own
importance after "spending three
weekends in three different
months" working on different
primaries. He attributed some of
the "myth" to the 1968 political
assassination of Sen. Robert
Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther
King, but warned that "the year
of emptiness that the
assassinations produced is over
now."
"If government by assassination
becomes a way of life, the
country will fall apart," he said.
"We had three great leaders killed
in the last decade - that's more

than most countries produce in a
century."
New Draft Atmosphere
Speaking on the problem of
draft repeal, Rep. Lowenstein
said, "It's very wise to stick to
outright appeal; it would be very
devisive to split the appeal." He
said that Sen. John Stennis had
"promised that there will be
hearings" on draft repeal in the
Senate, but that the House bill
"can't get anywhere because of
(Rep. L. Mendell) Rivers.
"In the House, we have 25
people on the bill. It's a good bill,
better than McGovern's bill in the
Senate, because it will have a
more immediate effect."
"The draft is at the point,
miraculously, where it can be

ended," Lowenstein said, tapping
the back of the couch for
emphasis. "We have watched a
whole new atmosphere develop
within the past year."
Middle M oves Left
"If the same degree of
resentment could be developed
over the draft as the Vietnam War,
it could be ended very quickly,"
he said.
But Lowenstein warned that,
unless draft repeal action is
assigned top priority by many
organizations, no action will be
taken. "It's like the 18 year old
vote - you could get it, but there
are not enough organizations
around focused on the point," he
added.

"Counterproductivity" he said,
"is something that we don't like
to talk about" because it involves
the "fringe elements" - "as the
young middle moves toward the
left, and gets frustrated, they're
becoming more and more radical,
and the rest of the people are
turning against them."
I 000 Mouths
"Not all Congressmen would
want students to help them in
their campaigns," he said, noting
that in one of his precincts where
"the kids did their own thing" he
made his worst showing during
the 1968 elections.
"This administration speaks out
of 1,000 mouths," Rep.
Lowenstein said, "and it's much
more difficult to tell what's going
on and who is responsible when it
comes out of so many mouths."
The Congressman termed the
Nixon administration "ad hoc"
and said that it is "committed to
programs which can't work." He
said that Nixon continues to
function through a series of
"political flourishes."
"The liberals are making a
mistake when they think that the
country will turn to them when
Nixon fails. Actually, the country
will turn to Agnew because they
think that Nixon has tried too
many liberal policies."
"You really have to experience
the deception while it's going on,"
he concluded.
