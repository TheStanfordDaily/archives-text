## Reds Advance In Laos 
### 
Vientiane, Laos APâ€” Laotian
government forces abandoned the
strategic air-field-outpost of
Muong Soui to the North
Vietnamese and Pathet Lao last
night, military sources said early
today.
The sources said the order to
abandon Muong Soui was given by
Gen. Vang Pao, who commands
the army of 10,000 Meo
tribesmen that is the government's
chief defense against the North
Laos.
Thongphanh Khosky, the
spokesman for the Defense
Ministry, had reported the fall of
Muong Soui early yesterday
morning, but U.S. sources in
Vientiane said his report was
premature.
Informed sources in Saigon said
that North Vietnam has launched
the biggest supply operation of
the war down the Ho Chi Minh
trail in eastern Laos. The supply
campaign began in November
when the dry season started
belatedly in Laos, making roads
passable. The sources reported
12,000-15,000 trucks moving
down the trail in December and
this number increased in January.
Precise figures for January were
not available.
It is estimated that there are
50,000 North Vietnamese troops
operating in Laos, including
1 5,000-20,000 reportedly
committed to the current
offensive in the Plain of Jars area.
To counter this massive
operation, the United States has

mounted the most concentrated
852 strategic bombing campaign
in eastern Laos since the planes
entered the Vietnamese war
nearly five years ago.
The aerial offensive is being
directed by the U.S. Command in
Saigon. A target-selection panel of
ranking officers meets twice a day
to assess the situation. The targets
are forwarded to the Strategic Air
Command and raids are launched
from bases in Thailand, Guam and
Okinawa with a fleet of 75 852
bombers available.
ABM Requested
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Pentagon urged Congress
yesterday to permit expansion of
the Safeguard antiballistic missile
system to shield a third U.S.
offensive base and start toward
building five additional ABM sites.
Reagan On Degree
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Gov.
Reagan said yesterday New York
City Mayor John Lindsay
shouldn't be insulted by being the
first University of California
Charter Day speaker in 101 years
not to receive an honorary degree.
"I don't think he should take it
that way," the Republican
governor told his weekly news
conference.
University regents, including

Reagan, voted in an executive
session in San Francisco Friday
not to bestow an honorary degree
on Lindsay. The mayor, a
Republican, is scheduled to speak
April 2.
"Perhaps those who voted felt
this was getting into the area of
politics," the governor said.
Reagan refused to say how he
voted.
Pompidou In I S
WASHINGTON (AP) - French
President Georges Pompidou said
Tuesday that peace in the Middle
East is vital for the peace of the
world but it is "more vital for
Israel than for anybody else."
Answering questions at a
National Press Club luncheon,
Pompidou said France is "neither
in one camp nor in the other. We
are certainly not against Israel."
He said France felt it had to sell
planes to Libya because "there
was suddenly a gap, a vacuum we
did not provoke."
"We felt it was in our interest
to fill this gap," he said.
Pompidou addressed the Press
Club after a two-hour initial
conference with President Nixon
at the White House.
Later at the White House
dinner for Pompidou and his wife,
President Nixon declared that
France which came to the aid of
America 200 years ago, "will
always be our friend."
He said the United States is
proud and thankful "that we shall
be working with our oldest friend
and ally" in building a new world
where everyone will have the
opportunity to live in
independence and freedom that
we have had."
Pompidou responded, speaking
in French, with a declaration that
"the United States and France
cannot live in separation or
isolation from each other." He
said they had deep and common
interests and "we must live to
work together and must not have
ever any opposition."
