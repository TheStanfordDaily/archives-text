# Hillel To Picket Pompidou Visit
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Peninsula Jewish organizations,
including Stanford's Hillel
Association, will picket French
President Pompidou's visit to the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
(SLAC) Friday.
Despite rumors to the contrary r
Arab students do not plan a
counter-demonstration.
Allan Sampson, a Stanford
graduate student coordinating
Hillel's participation in the
demonstrations estimated that 40
to 50 Stanford students would
join the march Friday morning
from Sharon Heights Shopping
Center to SLAC.
"Pompidou will be met by
demonstrators everywhere during
his visit to the United States,"
Sampson commented. "In
addition to Friday's march here,
a mass demonstration is planned
to take place in Union Square
Thursday evening."
According to Sampson, nearly
every Jewish synagogue on the
Peninsula, as well as many local
organizations, will be represented
in the local protest.
No Counter-Demonstration
Pompidou is scheduled to arrive

at SLAC by helicopter at 10:00
A.M. He will tour the linear
accelerator facilities and discuss
nuclear projects with staff
scientists. He will also meet with
President Pitzer and student
leaders for an exchange of views
on educational problems.
Stanford Arab students do not
plan a counter-demonstration,
according to Achmed Abu-Hilal, a
Palestinian graduate student.
"President Pompidou's visit does
not concern us," he stated. "He is
not one of our favorites. His
planes have bombed us as well (as
the Israelis)."
National Petition
The demonstrators will meet
Friday morning at 9:15 a.m. at
the Sharon Heights Shopping
Center. They will march four
blocks to the Stanford Linear
Acceleration Center. There they
plan to present Pompidou with
petitions protesting the French
arms embargo against Israel.
The Stanford version of the
petition, adopted from a national
form, states in part, "We members
of the Stanford Community .. .
.protest the rejection by your
government of the ideals always
held by France and your joining
the enemies of Israel, while
denying to Israel the 50 Mirage
jets previously bought and paid in
full."
Hillel believes the petition
reflects the beliefs of many in the
community. "Most of the people
I've spoken to on campus favor a
total arms embargo with no
playing of favorites," Samson
commented.
Planes to Libya
Sampson particularly
condemned the recent sale of 110
Mirage jets to Libya. "Libya has a
miniscule air force," he stated. "It
is common knowledge that these
jets will be used against Israel.
Ironically, many of the
modifications on the jet resulted
from Israeli suggestions."
Abu-Hilal denied that the
Mirages would be \ised against
Israel. "Those planes were paid
for in full," he stated. "Libya will
honor its contracts. The planes
will not be used against Israel."
Bay area Jewish organizations
are planning the Union Square
demonstration Thursday evening.
As a result, Pompidou is expected
to encounter 2000 protesters en
route to his suite in the St.
Francis Hotel.
Back in Washington, spite
denials that his country has taken
sides in the Middle East crisis,
French President Georges
Pompidou was faced today with
the possibility of a cool, if not
hostile, reception during his
address to a joint meeting of
Congress.
Some congressmen had
predicted nearly half the House
membership might boycott his
appearance in protest of the
French sale of fighter planes to
Libya. At least one House
member, Rep. Lester L. Wolff,
D-N.Y., declared he would walk
out in the middle of Pompidou's
talk.

from Israeli suggestions."
Abu-Hilal denied that the
Mirages would be \ised against
Israel. "Those planes were paid
for in full," he stated. "Libya will
honor its contracts. The planes
will not be used against Israel."
Bay area Jewish organizations
are planning the Union Square
demonstration Thursday evening.
As a result, Pompidou is expected
to encounter 2000 protesters en
route to his suite in the St.
Francis Hotel.
Back in Washington, spite
denials that his country has taken
sides in the Middle East crisis,
French President Georges
Pompidou was faced today with
the possibility of a cool, if not
hostile, reception during his
address to a joint meeting of
Congress.
Some congressmen had
predicted nearly half the House
membership might boycott his
appearance in protest of the
French sale of fighter planes to
Libya. At least one House
member, Rep. Lester L. Wolff,
D-N.Y., declared he would walk
out in the middle of Pompidou's
talk.
Peninsula Jewish organizations,
including Stanford's Hillel
Association, will picket French
President Pompidou's visit to the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
(SLAC) Friday.
Despite rumors to the contrary r
Arab students do not plan a
counter-demonstration.
Allan Sampson, a Stanford
graduate student coordinating
Hillel's participation in the
demonstrations estimated that 40
to 50 Stanford students would
join the march Friday morning
from Sharon Heights Shopping
Center to SLAC.
"Pompidou will be met by
demonstrators everywhere during
his visit to the United States,"
Sampson commented. "In
addition to Friday's march here,
a mass demonstration is planned
to take place in Union Square
Thursday evening."
According to Sampson, nearly
every Jewish synagogue on the
Peninsula, as well as many local
organizations, will be represented
in the local protest.
No Counter-Demonstration
Pompidou is scheduled to arrive

at SLAC by helicopter at 10:00
A.M. He will tour the linear
accelerator facilities and discuss
nuclear projects with staff
scientists. He will also meet with
President Pitzer and student
leaders for an exchange of views
on educational problems.
Stanford Arab students do not
plan a counter-demonstration,
according to Achmed Abu-Hilal, a
Palestinian graduate student.
"President Pompidou's visit does
not concern us," he stated. "He is
not one of our favorites. His
planes have bombed us as well (as
the Israelis)."
National Petition
The demonstrators will meet
Friday morning at 9:15 a.m. at
the Sharon Heights Shopping
Center. They will march four
blocks to the Stanford Linear
Acceleration Center. There they
plan to present Pompidou with
petitions protesting the French
arms embargo against Israel.
The Stanford version of the
petition, adopted from a national
form, states in part, "We members
of the Stanford Community .. .
.protest the rejection by your
government of the ideals always
held by France and your joining
the enemies of Israel, while
denying to Israel the 50 Mirage
jets previously bought and paid in
full."
Hillel believes the petition
reflects the beliefs of many in the
community. "Most of the people
I've spoken to on campus favor a
total arms embargo with no
playing of favorites," Samson
commented.
Planes to Libya
Sampson particularly
condemned the recent sale of 110
Mirage jets to Libya. "Libya has a
miniscule air force," he stated. "It
is common knowledge that these
jets will be used against Israel.
Ironically, many of the
modifications on the jet resulted
from Israeli suggestions."
Abu-Hilal denied that the
Mirages would be \ised against
Israel. "Those planes were paid
for in full," he stated. "Libya will
honor its contracts. The planes
