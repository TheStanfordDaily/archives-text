# Resolution On ROTC
## 
### 
The formal receipt of last
Thursday's student Senate ROTC
resolutions provoked little
immediate reaction in the
administration yesterday.
The resolution had asked
President Pitzer to discuss the
status of ROTC here, and asked
the Academic Senate to explain
the similarities and differences in
their three different actions on
ROTC.
Provost Richard Lyman, had no
comment on the resolution
directed to the administration. He
said that any reply would have to
await President Pitzer's return this
weekend from Latin America.
In reply to the student Senate's
request to the Academic Senate,
the faculty body's chairman
William Clebsch stated that the
request would be put on the
Senate's agenda as soon as
practicable.
He cautioned however that it
might be inappropriate for the
Academic Senate to issue an
explanation of its ROTC position
while the Academic Council was
discussing it. He opined that some
might consider a Senate discussion
of ROTC an attempt to influence
the Council's debate.
The Academic Council is
meeting March 2 to discuss
reversal of the Academic Senate's
position allowing ROTC to receive
credit. Chances are ,;ood that the
Council will use a mail ballot to
decide the issu id the decision
will not be re hed before the
Senate meets March 5.
