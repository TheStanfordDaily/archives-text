PERSONALITY
What Are You Going To Do With Them?
If you're lucky, you'll find a career that will use half of what
you've got. The tragedy is so many don't know they're wasting
the other half until it's too late to change.
In our business you can use every one of your personal assets —
plus a few you can borrow, like technical knowledge. That'.'
because in life insurance sales, you are independent yet hav*
the support of a large experienced organization.
The company? Connecticut Mutual Life, one of the most re
spected names in life insurance. Our agency? We think it's
pretty special, too.
Call or write to arrange for some candid conversation about a
life insurance career . . . and meet some fellows who grar
uated from Stanford and are using all their talents (and getting
well paid for all of them, too.)
