BATTLE of ALGIERS
An uncommonly dynamic picture. . Most extraordinary and therefore com
manding of lasting interest and critical applause is the amazing photographic
virtuosity and pictorial conviction of this film. So authentically and naturalistic
ally were its historical reflections staged, with literally thousands of citizens
participating, in the streets and buildings of Algiers, that it looks beyond ques
tion to be an original documentary f,lm . . . the roles of the rebel leaders, played
by Braghim Haggiag and Vacef Saadi, are done with such ferocity and ferv r
that they certainly convince me."—Bosley Crowther, New York Times
