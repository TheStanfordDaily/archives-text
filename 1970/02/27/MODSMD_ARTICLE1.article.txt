# Pompidou Arrives
## SLAC Slicks Up For Tour 
### TOM GIVEN 
In the Klystron Gallery, the
wet paint signs were up. A painter
was applying finishing touches to
the floor, another man was
cleaning the windows and doors.
The Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, better known
as SLAC, was preparing for the
visit of French President Georges
Pompidou.
"This is the biggest thing to hit
this outfit," remarked a tour
guide. "Everybody around here is
excited."
In the office of Public
Information chief Jack Sanders,
everybody was' talking on the
phone, jotting down notes, and
anticipating today's visit.
"We'll need someone to answer
the phone," one secretary was
saving as another informed her
ca>ler that, "Yes you can come in
under the rope, but the parking
will be reserved for members of
the press. . ."
Absent were the signs of
paranoia that are normal to such
visits. Vivitors passing the gate
r< reived the standard treatment,
and the open nature of the SLAC
compound prevailed.
"We had some Secret Service
men fly in by helicopter last
Friday," noted a member of
Sander's staff. "They looked
about, figured where snipers could
h : de, I guess, but that was about
it.''
Normal Treatment
Indeed, when the French chief
arrives, he will get essentially the
same tour given to 2800 visitors
every month.
His first stop will be CCR - the
Central Control Room. There,
be ('ore a wide panel of lights,
dials, scopes, and a mockup of the
accelerator itself, technicians
monitor the progress of the
accelerating particles.
The total array is most
impressive, even if one has little
what the lights light for or
th»i screens are measuring. Within
the large CCR, the central panel
looks a lot like a science fiction
Christmas tree, or log, or forest.
From CCR, the President and
his party will climb down the
steps and pass through the gates
lending to the Klystron Gallery.
Tnis two-mile long room is the

beige shed that one can see from
either Interstate 280, or Sand Hill
Road. Housing the support
systems for the accelerator itself,
which is buried beneath it, it is an
almost endless corridor.
Instruments
Sitting evenly spaced on the
antiseptic concrete floor are the
various pumps, gauges, and
gadgets that help make the
electrons go. The visitors' section
of the gallery includes a sample
section of the accelerator itself.
A series of red lights was
flashing above it all Thursday, but
this morning they will be turned
off, for the accelerator itself is
being shut down to allow
Pompidou to inspect the end
station, where the electrons are
smashed and the experiments
conducted.
This shutdown is not part of
the normal procedure, for the
accelerator runs for three weeks
straight with one week rest
periods.
The President and his party
will pass through a narrow tunnel,
past the concrete radiation
shields, and into a large empty
shell - the enclosure in which the
SLAC scientists conduct their
tests.
European Version
Just how much of this he'll
understand is unclear. According
to reliable sources, his reason for
visiting is to demonstrate French
interest in accelerators. A
consortium of Western European
countries is planning to build an
accelerator similar to SLAC, and
some observors feel Pompidou is
anxious to have it located in
France.
In many respects, SLAC is a
good model for such a
undertaking. Scientists from any
nation recognized by the United
States are welcome to observe or
collaborate in the center's
activities.
According to Sanders, there are
usually representatives of at least
10 nations at the project at any
given time.
Among the nations that have
used or are using SLAC facilities
are Germany, Israel, France, the
U.S.S.R., and the United
Kingdom.

Facilitating this openness is the
policy set by the Stanford Board
of Trustees in offering the
university land for the site. It
restricts the center from pursuing
any secret research.


CONTROL CENTER—French President Georges Pompidou comes lo Stanford today to visit the Linear Accelerator
Center. Although he will receive the normal tour of the complex, SLAC is huz/.ing with anticipation.
