# On ROTC
## Extend Human Freedom 
### Bill Evers 
As a matter of principle, the consistent
advocate of human liberty finds himself among
those opposed to the Reserve Officers Training
Corps.
The nexus of militarism and tax-supported
education in the colleges and universities of
America dates back to the Civil War period Morrill
Act, which granted Federal land to the states, the
income from which was to be used in part to
establish state colleges, whose curriculum was to
include military training.
The extent today to which Federal aid to
education means Federal control is apparent in the
following statement William L. Marbury, senior
member of the Harvard Corporation, made to the
Baltimore Sun: "Slapping ROTC in the face is like
slapping a lion in the face. It is a crazy thing to do,
especially at a time every university is dependent
on Federal funds." The government tries to look
after its interests.
Throughout its history, ROTC has been under
attack from those who opposed its goals and its
methods. Libertarians, including author Louis
Bromfield, Senator William E. Borah of Idaho, and
Oswald Garrison Villard, editor of The Nation,
have been prominent among the opponents.
Stanford University's first president, David Starr
Jordan, wrote in the New York Times of 25
February 1925 that military training is not one of
"the tasks of general education" and has "no
natural part in our training for civil life."
ROTC Objectives
The objective of the ROTC program is to
channel college-educated manpower into the
junior officer corps, using publicity, scholarships,
compulsory attendence requirements (at some
schools), and punitive contract-fulfillment clauses.
Like the Selective Service System, it is intended to
be a channeling mechanism, qualitatively different
from natural career motivations. Manpower is
warpower.
In ROTC, the armed services' instructors teach
unquestioning obedience to superiors and
inculcate the cadets in the ethics of the military.
Frank professions of purpose set forth in ROTC
manuals have included statements such as these:
"Drill is the foundation of disciplinary training; it
compels the habit of obedience and stimulates the
feeling of corporate strength as the unit moves
together as one man," and"The presence in all
professional groups of an increasing percent of
leaders who have enjoyed the benefits of military
instruction serves as a stabilizing influence over the

whole nation, which supports and champions a
sympathetic understanding of the needs ol the
military establishment and its purposes."
ROTC is a system of hierarchy and status
linked to the national government, seeking to
foster militaristic values on college campuses.
Libertarians deny the legitimacy of any such
authoritarian institution. ROTC is loathsome to
those who consistently adhere to the libertarian
social principle of free and voluntary association.
The warfare state is incompatible with a free
society.
Indoctrination \nd Control
In their 1959 study of ROTC, Education and
Militar) Leadership, Gene M. Lyons and John W.
Masland identify two characteristics of ROTC
which differentiate it from other courses at
institutions of higher learning: obvious
indoctrination and obvious Federal control. Lyons
and Masland write: "(The problem of
indoctrination" is rooted in that most special of
activities with which the military
deal—violence—and has no counterpart in other
professions for which colleges and universities are
called upon to prepare young men.
"The element of violence is also behind the
second characteristic that distinguishes the ROTC
programs from other functions of higher
education. This is the element of centralized
federal control. One of the features of modern
military organization is the monopoly of the
instruments of violence by the state. In terms of
military organization in the United States, this
means that the armed forces, as agencies of the
federal government, are the sole prospective
employer of the talent produced by the ROTC
programs."
This tie to the national government is the
decisive factor in the make-up of ROTC. Because
of the dynamics of political power, the function of
ROTC graduates in the armed forces is constantly
the implementation of decisions from on high to
violate people's freedom. ROTC cadets are trained
to be the officer caste overseers for the
conscript-slaves forced to fight in the U.S.
government's military interventions around the
globe.
The elimination of ROTC would mean an
extension of human freedom. The blood which the
Leviathan state sucks in order to survive is in truth
the resources of the people. It is time to cut the
Leviathan off from these resources.

be a channeling mechanism, qualitatively different

In ROTC, the armed services' instructors teach
unquestioning obedience to superiors and
inculcate the cadets in the ethics of the military.
Frank professions of purpose set forth in ROTC
manuals have included statements such as these:
"Drill is the foundation of disciplinary training; it
compels the habit of obedience and stimulates the
feeling of corporate strength as the unit moves
together as one man," and"The presence in all
professional groups of an increasing percent of
leaders who have enjoyed the benefits of military
instruction serves as a stabilizing influence over the

whole nation, which supports and champions a
sympathetic understanding of the needs ol the
military establishment and its purposes."
ROTC is a system of hierarchy and status
linked to the national government, seeking to
foster militaristic values on college campuses.
Libertarians deny the legitimacy of any such
authoritarian institution. ROTC is loathsome to
those who consistently adhere to the libertarian
social principle of free and voluntary association.
The warfare state is incompatible with a free

Indoctrination \nd Control
In their 1959 study of ROTC, Education and
Militar) Leadership, Gene M. Lyons and John W.
Masland identify two characteristics of ROTC
which differentiate it from other courses at
institutions of higher learning: obvious
indoctrination and obvious Federal control. Lyons
and Masland write: "(The problem of
indoctrination" is rooted in that most special of
activities with which the military
deal—violence—and has no counterpart in other
professions for which colleges and universities are
called upon to prepare young men.
"The element of violence is also behind the
second characteristic that distinguishes the ROTC
programs from other functions of higher
education. This is the element of centralized
federal control. One of the features of modern
military organization is the monopoly of the
instruments of violence by the state. In terms of
military organization in the United States, this
means that the armed forces, as agencies of the
federal government, are the sole prospective
employer of the talent produced by the ROTC
programs."
This tie to the national government is the
decisive factor in the make-up of ROTC. Because
of the dynamics of political power, the function of
ROTC graduates in the armed forces is constantly
the implementation of decisions from on high to
violate people's freedom. ROTC cadets are trained
to be the officer caste overseers for the
conscript-slaves forced to fight in the U.S.
government's military interventions around the
globe.
The elimination of ROTC would mean an
extension of human freedom. The blood which the
Leviathan state sucks in order to survive is in truth
the resources of the people. It is time to cut the
Leviathan off from these resources.
(Bill Evers is a senior in political science and
member of the Radical Libertarian Alliance.)
As a matter of principle, the consistent
advocate of human liberty finds himself among
those opposed to the Reserve Officers Training
Corps.
The nexus of militarism and tax-supported
education in the colleges and universities of
America dates back to the Civil War period Morrill
Act, which granted Federal land to the states, the
income from which was to be used in part to
establish state colleges, whose curriculum was to
include military training.
The extent today to which Federal aid to
education means Federal control is apparent in the
following statement William L. Marbury, senior
member of the Harvard Corporation, made to the
Baltimore Sun: "Slapping ROTC in the face is like
slapping a lion in the face. It is a crazy thing to do,
especially at a time every university is dependent
on Federal funds." The government tries to look
after its interests.
Throughout its history, ROTC has been under
attack from those who opposed its goals and its
methods. Libertarians, including author Louis
Bromfield, Senator William E. Borah of Idaho, and
Oswald Garrison Villard, editor of The Nation,
have been prominent among the opponents.
Stanford University's first president, David Starr
Jordan, wrote in the New York Times of 25
February 1925 that military training is not one of
"the tasks of general education" and has "no
natural part in our training for civil life."
