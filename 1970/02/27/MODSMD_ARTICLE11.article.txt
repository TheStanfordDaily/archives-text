The Country's Interest
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Academic Council meets
next week to review the Academic
Senate's action of January 22. I
would like to say why I support
the Senate's action.
Last year many people thought
we had three alternatives on
ROTC: (1) keep it essentially as it
is with some modifications (2)
deny academic credit for ROTC
courses but allow it as an
extra-curricular activity, and (3)
remove it completely from the
campus. Last year we voted
essentially for the second
alternative.
This year the Army proposal
makes it fairly clear that the
second alternative is not feasible;
the ROTC program is too big to
be run as a completely
extra-curricular activity. They
propose a compromise between
alternatives (1) and (2) above
which involves a drastic change in
the status of ROTC
officer-teachers and gives the
faculty an opportunity to approve
or disapprove (for credit) the
courses they teach.
It is unfortunate but quite
apparent that we shall need a
strong military capability for the
foreseeable future. Hence, I hope
that capable men will continue to
be involved in the military service.
If our leading universities deny
credit for all courses required by
the ROTC program (including
such things as psychology,
geopolitics, and navigation) there
is a strong implication that the
faculty considers that one can be
a military officer without any
training, that no intellectual
power is needed.
I think it is important that all
our military officers not be

exclusively from the service
academies, that many of them
have a distinctly civilian outlook
and a broad educational
background (e.g. George Marshall
came thru ROTC).
The small highly-professional,
academy-trained, officer corps
may look attractive but, it seems
to me, it is all too easy for men in
such a clique to be tempted by
the power in their hands.
I'm afraid many of us are
tempted to make the military, and
hence the ROTC as part of the
military, a scape-goat for
Vietnam. I think the DOD has
made some deplorable mistakes in
this war but let us not forget that
the Executive Branch of the

government and the State
Department are primarily
responsible for our involvement in
Vietnam. Furthermore Congress
went along and has provided
(until now, almost unanimously)
the billions needed to fight that
war.
Elimination of ROTC
throughout our leading
universities would have a serious
effect on our military strength
and would tend to the formation
of a military clique that would
not be in the best interests of the
country.
