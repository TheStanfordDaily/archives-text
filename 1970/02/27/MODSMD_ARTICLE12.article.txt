# Venceremos Brigade
## Fatigue Of Journey 
### John Spiegel 
Our portion of the Brigade
arrived in Mexico City at 5:30
a.m. after two and a half days on
the bus. We are in the midst of a
12-hour wait at the airport and
have occupied a small waiting
room until it is time for the hassle
with the Mexican immigration
authorities. We are looking most
unrevolutionary, sprawled over
our luggage, interspersing trips to
the rest room with snatches of
sleep.
Standing around the perimeter
of our group are men in suits and
dark glasses, in the best 'Hawaiian
Eye' tradition, whom we suspect
of being CIA, State, and Mexican
agents. They must be somewhat
disappointed in this assignment, if
they are, for we far more resemble
a group of refugees than a
subversive organization.
I feel utterly wasted. I sat up
for three days in a kind of stupor
on the bus, not wanting to move
or eat, and not being able to sleep
more than a hour at a time. The
prospect of another night of
travelling seems unbelievable to
me.
A very capable fellow, Bruce, is
guiding us through the
immigration hassle. They will take
our pictures, ask a few questions,
and then, hopefully, send us on

our way. The tension is evident in
all of us. There have already been
some minor problems between the ;
black and white people during the
long bus ride. I'm hoping these
will disappear once the trip is
over.
Terribly Distant
I feel now as if I had been with
the Brigade for weeks, rather than
for a few days. Stanford seems
impossibly distant to me now -
and the life there unbearable
tame. The worry we all
experience, to some degree, about
the consequences of flaunting the
travel ban has added a flavor to
life; I find that I am taking people
on the Brigade much more
seriously for the fact that we are
all risking something together.
Yet as the moment for
boarding the plane nears, I cannot
generate the requisite excitement.
The fatigue of the journey has
proven too strong for the spirit of
romantic adventure, and my most
precious thoughts are for the
moment I can enjoy a hot bath
and clean sheets at the nearest
Hyatt House.

for three days in a kind of stupor
on the bus, not wanting to move
or eat, and not being able to sleep
more than a hour at a time. The
prospect of another night of
travelling seems unbelievable to
me.
A very capable fellow, Bruce, is
guiding us through the
immigration hassle. They will take
our pictures, ask a few questions,
and then, hopefully, send us on

our way. The tension is evident in
all of us. There have already been
some minor problems between the ;
black and white people during the
long bus ride. I'm hoping these
will disappear once the trip is
over.
Terribly Distant
I feel now as if I had been with
the Brigade for weeks, rather than
for a few days. Stanford seems
impossibly distant to me now -
and the life there unbearable
tame. The worry we all
experience, to some degree, about
the consequences of flaunting the
travel ban has added a flavor to
life; I find that I am taking people
on the Brigade much more
seriously for the fact that we are
all risking something together.
Yet as the moment for
boarding the plane nears, I cannot
generate the requisite excitement.
The fatigue of the journey has
proven too strong for the spirit of
romantic adventure, and my most
precious thoughts are for the
moment I can enjoy a hot bath
and clean sheets at the nearest
Hyatt House.
