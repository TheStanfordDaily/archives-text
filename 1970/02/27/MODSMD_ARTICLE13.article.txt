## 'Horses' Exciting, Evocative Allegory 
### TODD McCARTHY 
For all the mistakes made in
adapting the novel to the screen,
"They Shoot Horses, Don't
They?" is an immensely
entertaining movie. In "Horses,"
as in many recent notable but
uneven films, the basic premise is
valid and provocative but is
somewhat weakened by
misapplied and self-conscious
story telling techniques.
Fortunately, these flaws remain
annoyances rather than fatal
wounds and merely impose upon

rather than cancel out the power
and excitement of most of the
picture.
While reading Horace McCoy's
1935 novel, one cannot help but
imagine what a marvellous film it
could inspire. The lean style, the
quick character observations and
the forceful evocation of time and
place almost beg cinematic
realization. It is surprising,
therefore, that screenwriter
Robert Thompson went to the
lengths he did to alter the story
details only to arrive at essentially

the same place. McCoy's use of
1930's dance marathon as a
supreme allegory is very fine but
really too obvious -to be
belabored. However, the success
of this allegory is due in no small
measure to the author's
off-handed matter-of-factness—the
symbolism is there if you want it.
Thompson, while he doesn't
lecture, seems to choose and
create incidents so that the
allegorical aspect of the story can
flow at equal speed (and with
almost equal importance) as the
narrative itself.
In the novel, the marathon is
forced to close down as a result of
a shooting incident inside the
dance hall. All the contestants,
who at that point had been
dancing close to 900 hours, are
thus eliminated and their toil is
rendered useless. Gloria, for lack
of a better word the heroine of
the piece, has been dealt the
ultimate rejection and asks her
partner to shoot her. As presented
in the book, we can somewhat
understand Gloria's decision but
not really sympathize with it, for
there are many others in her
position who are not resorting to
her drastic measures.
In the film, Gloria discovers
that the dance is rigged, that even
if you win, you can only keep a
small portion of the $1,500 prize
money. Gloria, knowing the score
as the other contestants do not,
quits the marathon and, as in the
book, decides to die. Afterwards,
in the film's final, rising shot, we
see the few remaining couples still
moving about on thy dance floor
while the cryptic master of
ceremonies broadcasts (in what is,
incidently, the most blatantly
allegorical speech in the film),
"Yowza! Here they are again,
these wonderful, wonderful kids,
still struggling, still hoping, while
the clock of Fate ticks away.
While the Dance of Destiny
continues. While the Marathon
goes on and on and on and on.
How long can they last?!" In
reference to Gloria's decision, this
cynical attitude makes those that
remain look like fools and implies
that the film makers condone
Gloria's action, that once a
superior knowledge is obtained,
the only valid and logical act can
be to reject everything, even
yourself. While this ending may
neatly complete the allegory of
the picture, it isn't really
convincing on the human level
and which, after all, is more
important?
McCoy's greatest strength lies
with the form and structure of his
book and sadly, it is here that the
film falls down most seriously.
The novel is told in flashback, the
present being the trial of Robert,
who is being convicted for the
mercy shooting of Gloria. Perhaps
in order to avoid the age-old
cinematic device of having an
already determined criminal relate
his story in flashback, the film
makers have set the marathon in
the present and have delegated the
trial to the future. Normally, the
flash forward is a story defeating
device but here, the brief
sequences spaced throughout the
film which show Robert in a
bafflingly blue jail and courtroom
merely serve to confuse the story.
I frankly don't see how a viewer

unfamiliar with the property can
really be expected to tell if these
scenes are flashbacks, flash
forwards, dreams or vision, not to
mention being able to grasp their
import. Furthermore, Robert,
through whose eyes the book is
written, is rendered the weakest
character in the film largely
because of the ambiguity
endowed upon him by the film
makers.
It is, however, the characters
which make "They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?" something special.
Despite the relative sordidness of
the individuals, the penetrating
emphasis on them is especially
refreshing today when the gallery
of memorable new characters in
the cinema is dwindling
dangerously. Given the actors
currently working in Hollywood,
a better cast is unimaginable. Jane
Fonda fully deserves all the
attention she is receiving for her
performance. While her work here
merely confirms my previous high
regard for her, my worry now is
not whether she can live up to
"Horses" but whether she will be
able to find enough solid roles
which will offer her substantial
challenges. Though I generally
stay clear of Academy Award
speculation, I have to admit that
I'll be rooting for Jane in April.
I have been annoyed at the
critics who have declared that Gig
Young has "learned to act" for
"Horses," for he has always been
a reliable and charming player in
parts which could easily be bland
or overly coy in lesser hands. His
performance here as the organizer
and master of ceremonies of the
marathon is so effective not only
because the character is so
deliciously cynical but because we
can sense his past experience with
people that has led to the
cynicism. Perhaps even more than
Gloria, he realizes the cheapness
and ultimate futility and
meaninglessness of the marathon
(and, need I add, life), but instead
of rejecting it, he exploits it for
everything he can.
I have never been too
enthusiastic about Red Buttons

but I found him very affecting as
an aging sailor whose last stab at
youth ends disastrously. Susanah
York redeems herself from her
excursion into lesbianism in "The
Killing of Sister George" as a Jean
Harlow look-alike who hopes to
be spotted by Hollywood talent
scouts. I have a feeling that
Michael Sarrazin may become one
of our most prominant young
actors but, again, he is at the
mercy of an ill-conceived part.
As well as taking substantial
credit for the uniformly excellent
performances in the film, director
Sydney Pollack deserves special
note for his highly satisfying
evocation of time and place.
Though the dance hall no longer
exists, my strong impression of
Santa Monica pier coincides
remarkably with McCoy's vision -
of the disgusting but
unforgettable place and I was
overjoyed that Pollack
approximated mv own
sentiments, as well as McCoy's, as
closely as he did. The mood
created by the movement, music,
color, sweat and noise of the
dance hall seems to me unique in
films. Maybe I'm a sucker, but I
respond more readily to a dark,
quiet, fog enshrouded pier than to
any other setting I can think of.
Thus, the film's final scene
touched me in its handling as
much as it frightened me through
its implications of hopelessness
and inevitable doom.
It is a sad year when even the
best films must be weighed
according to their relative lack of
faults rather than their abundance
in merits. Fortunately, the
sequences which are flawed in
"They Shoot Horses, Don't
They?" are brief and not essential
to the film's ultimate success or
failure. That the film succeeds
rests mainly with the power of the
marathon itself as a stimulus for
intellectual and emotional
excitement. Despite the fact that
it could have been much better,
'They Shoot Horses" pleased me
more than any other American
film made in that interesting but
disappointing year, 1969.
