# At TMU Through March 6
## 'Contemporary Brazilian Art' 
### BONNIE KOEHLER 
"To be an artist is the most
difficult thing in the world,"
commented the owner of the
Four Planets Art Gallery of Sao
Paulo, as we walked through her
collection of intense prints. "One
must dedicate his life entirely to
the creative process."
South America, Brazil in
particular, is just now beginning
to "reap the harvest" of the art
schools started by artists from
Europe after the War, she
commented. Fourteen of the best
of these young post-war Brazilian
artists, working in graphics, are
represented in the current
showing at Tresidder Union.
The exhibit, CONTEMPOR
ARY BRAZILIAN ART, was
brought to Stanford by Mrs.
Thomas Bun and her husband,
who own the Gallery. Both are
natives of Brazil. The limited
edition prints are for sale for
$40.00 and up.
The graphics are woodcuts,
etchings, engravings, lithographs,
and tempera washes. Printmaking

in these media is popular with
contemporary artists of Brazil,
who still must import most of
their supplies.
Vigorous
The exhibit encompasses a
wide range of subject matter and
style. The group is homogeneous
in its vigor and intensity. Subjects
include Biblical illustrations,
children, and abstract
conceptions, depicted in styles
varying from bold color to
subdued black and white.
Recurring themes include
problems specific to Brazil and
Latin America, and explorations
of problems concerning man in
conflict with contemporary
society.
One of Mrs. Bun's admitted
favorites is Marcelo Grassmann.
He is also a favorite of his
countrymen, and was recently
honored for his twenty-five years
of printmaking by becoming the
first Brazilian artist to exhibit in a
gallery devoted exclusively to his
work in the Modern Art Museum
of Sao Paulo. He is a three-time

winner at the Sao Paulo Biennials
and winner of first prize for
engraving in Venice, 1958.
The most prolific of the artists
represented at Tresidder,
Grassmann works almost entirely
with engraving. His black and
white prints are powerful
renderings of hallucinations and
grotesque subjects of the
unconscious. His subjects are
distorted human figures and
beasts.
i olitical
"Conditional Freedom," a
large red print on white
background represents the strong
political convictions of the young
artist, Maria Bonomi. The
lithograph won her the grand
prize for prints at the 1965 Sao
Paulo Biennial, but she led the
protest of artists against this
year's Biennial by refusing to
show her work. The protest
symbolizes the disapproval for the
military regime.
Her large print in green,
"Green Contata," an award

winner at the Tokyo Biennial, is
also in Tresidder.
Zoravia Bettiol is the happiest
of the artists, as seen in her
delightful woodcuts. The large
prints are made from six wood
blocks, allowing for six colors.
They are in bright acrylic paint on
Japanese rice paper.
UNICEF Card
One of her large prints,
depicting a child's fantasy, was
chosen for a UNICEF Christmas
card in 1968, and was a best
seller.
Her prints are in three series.
Her "Children" series depicts
children's dreams, fantasies and
legends, and children playing.
There are 30 in this group; all
done in 4 to 6 bright colors on a
white background. She always
prints the children in black ink.
Zoravia Bettiol's "Circus"
series of clowns, animals, and
other figures are printed in light
colors on a dark background. Her
"Bible" series currently contains
11 prints illustrating stories from
"the Bible in popular motifs. She
adds one new print to this every
year.
Other artists in the exhibition
include Hans Grudjinski, who
works in a medium of mixed
etching and acquatint to produce
beautiful illusive monochromatic
images. Alice Brill uses tempera
wash to explore the theme of
human urban alienation. The
deep blue washes of Frank
Schaeffer depict Brazilian
historical towns and missions.

prints the children in black ink.
Zoravia Bettiol's "Circus"
series of clowns, animals, and
other figures are printed in light
colors on a dark background. Her
"Bible" series currently contains
11 prints illustrating stories from
"the Bible in popular motifs. She
adds one new print to this every
year.
Other artists in the exhibition
include Hans Grudjinski, who
works in a medium of mixed
etching and acquatint to produce
beautiful illusive monochromatic
images. Alice Brill uses tempera
wash to explore the theme of
human urban alienation. The
deep blue washes of Frank
Schaeffer depict Brazilian
historical towns and missions.
"To be an artist is the most
difficult thing in the world,"
commented the owner of the
Four Planets Art Gallery of Sao
Paulo, as we walked through her
collection of intense prints. "One
must dedicate his life entirely to
the creative process."
South America, Brazil in
particular, is just now beginning
to "reap the harvest" of the art
schools started by artists from
Europe after the War, she
commented. Fourteen of the best
of these young post-war Brazilian
artists, working in graphics, are
represented in the current
showing at Tresidder Union.
The exhibit, CONTEMPOR
ARY BRAZILIAN ART, was
brought to Stanford by Mrs.
Thomas Bun and her husband,
who own the Gallery. Both are
natives of Brazil. The limited
edition prints are for sale for
$40.00 and up.
The graphics are woodcuts,
etchings, engravings, lithographs,
and tempera washes. Printmaking

in these media is popular with
contemporary artists of Brazil,
who still must import most of
their supplies.
Vigorous
The exhibit encompasses a
wide range of subject matter and
style. The group is homogeneous
in its vigor and intensity. Subjects
include Biblical illustrations,
children, and abstract
conceptions, depicted in styles
varying from bold color to
subdued black and white.
Recurring themes include
problems specific to Brazil and
Latin America, and explorations
of problems concerning man in
conflict with contemporary
society.
One of Mrs. Bun's admitted
favorites is Marcelo Grassmann.
He is also a favorite of his
countrymen, and was recently
honored for his twenty-five years
of printmaking by becoming the
first Brazilian artist to exhibit in a
gallery devoted exclusively to his
work in the Modern Art Museum
of Sao Paulo. He is a three-time

winner at the Sao Paulo Biennials
and winner of first prize for
engraving in Venice, 1958.
The most prolific of the artists
represented at Tresidder,
Grassmann works almost entirely
with engraving. His black and
white prints are powerful
renderings of hallucinations and
grotesque subjects of the
unconscious. His subjects are
distorted human figures and
beasts.

"Conditional Freedom," a
large red print on white
background represents the strong
political convictions of the young
artist, Maria Bonomi. The
lithograph won her the grand
prize for prints at the 1965 Sao
Paulo Biennial, but she led the
protest of artists against this
year's Biennial by refusing to
show her work. The protest
symbolizes the disapproval for the
military regime.
Her large print in green,
"Green Contata," an award

winner at the Tokyo Biennial, is
also in Tresidder.
Zoravia Bettiol is the happiest
of the artists, as seen in her
delightful woodcuts. The large
prints are made from six wood
blocks, allowing for six colors.
They are in bright acrylic paint on
Japanese rice paper.
UNICEF Card
One of her large prints,
depicting a child's fantasy, was
chosen for a UNICEF Christmas
card in 1968, and was a best
seller.
Her prints are in three series.
Her "Children" series depicts
children's dreams, fantasies and
legends, and children playing.
There are 30 in this group; all
done in 4 to 6 bright colors on a
white background. She always
prints the children in black ink.
