# Chicanos Label Punishment Racist
## 
### LAURIE PRICE 
Angry words and testimony by
psychologists accompanied the
reinstatement of the controversial
"demerit" system at Graham
School in Mountain View
Wednesday night.
The system has been a focus of
protest by Chicano groups,
including Stanford's MECHA,
during the last month.
Denying charges from militant
Mexican-Americans that the
discipline system is "racist," the
school board voted unanimously
to support it.
Students in grades six through
eight attend Graham School.
About eighteen percent have
Spanish surnames.
A code of conduct has been
instituted at Graham which
specifies the number of demerits
to be given for certain offenses. A
set number of demerits is allowed
each student before he is called in
for parent-teacher conferences,
possible suspension, and
ultimately, expulsion.
One and one-half hours of
presentations from the audience
preceeded action by the board on
the issue.
Increased Anxiety
In contesting the demerit
system, the Chicano opponents
relied heavily on statements by
Miss Norma Irons, an associate
professor at San Francisco State
College.
"A child who is really a
problem does not value censure.
What this system does for such
children is drive them out of the
school," she testified.
"I do not deny that the system
depresses bad behavior .. . You
can measure how the bad behavior
has been cut down, but you
cannot measure the increased
anxiety it causes in the children."
No Heresay
Thomas Tutko, psychology
professor at San Jose State, spoke
for the teaching staff at Graham,
"Children must function in an
environment akin to the world in
which we are living. All societies
have rewards and punishments for
those who follow and violate
rules. We have attempted to
eliminate subtle prejudice by
writing all the rules down. Each
child gets a copy of them. A
teacher has to see a child break a
rule before a demerit is given.
There can be no hearsay . . ."
Tutko went on to explain that
the staff was very pleased with the
results of the demerit system. Less
than one percent of the students
were repeatedly suspended.
500 Attend Meeting
After nine weeks of trial, the
system had virtually eliminated
food-throwing in the cafeteria,
fighting, running in the halls,
littering of the playground,
bicycle vandalism, and insolence
to teachers.

The Wednesday board meeting
was attended by about 500
people, including opponents and
defendants of the demerit rule.
Mexican-Americans from San
Francisco and San Jose supported
the demands of Chicano parents.
Clapping from this group greeted
the attacks on the system.
No Alternative Yet
Following the unfavorable
action on their demands, the
Mexican-Americans rose and
exited, chanting "Viva la Raza"
("Long live the race").
Trustee Dean Miller, who had
been originally against demerit
punishment, responded to a few
shouted threats from those
defeated.
"I've been very much
discouraged by comments from
many parents as to the positive
aspects of the demerit system. So
far we've not come up with an
alternative. What we had before is
certainly less desirable."
The Mexican-American
organization on the Stanford
campus, MECHA, could not be
reached for comment on the
controversy yesterday afternoon.

system had virtually eliminated
food-throwing in the cafeteria,
fighting, running in the halls,
littering of the playground,
bicycle vandalism, and insolence
to teachers.

The Wednesday board meeting
was attended by about 500
people, including opponents and
defendants of the demerit rule.
Mexican-Americans from San
Francisco and San Jose supported
the demands of Chicano parents.
Clapping from this group greeted
the attacks on the system.
No Alternative Yet
Following the unfavorable
action on their demands, the
Mexican-Americans rose and
exited, chanting "Viva la Raza"
("Long live the race").
Trustee Dean Miller, who had
been originally against demerit
punishment, responded to a few
shouted threats from those
defeated.
"I've been very much
discouraged by comments from
many parents as to the positive
aspects of the demerit system. So
far we've not come up with an
alternative. What we had before is
certainly less desirable."
The Mexican-American
organization on the Stanford
campus, MECHA, could not be
reached for comment on the
controversy yesterday afternoon.
Angry words and testimony by
psychologists accompanied the
reinstatement of the controversial
"demerit" system at Graham
School in Mountain View
Wednesday night.
The system has been a focus of
protest by Chicano groups,
including Stanford's MECHA,
during the last month.
Denying charges from militant
Mexican-Americans that the
discipline system is "racist," the
school board voted unanimously
to support it.
Students in grades six through
eight attend Graham School.
About eighteen percent have
Spanish surnames.
A code of conduct has been
instituted at Graham which
specifies the number of demerits
to be given for certain offenses. A
set number of demerits is allowed
each student before he is called in
for parent-teacher conferences,
possible suspension, and
ultimately, expulsion.
One and one-half hours of
presentations from the audience
preceeded action by the board on
the issue.
Increased Anxiety
In contesting the demerit
system, the Chicano opponents
relied heavily on statements by
Miss Norma Irons, an associate
professor at San Francisco State
College.
"A child who is really a
problem does not value censure.
What this system does for such
children is drive them out of the
school," she testified.
"I do not deny that the system
depresses bad behavior .. . You
can measure how the bad behavior
has been cut down, but you
cannot measure the increased
anxiety it causes in the children."
No Heresay
Thomas Tutko, psychology
professor at San Jose State, spoke
for the teaching staff at Graham,
"Children must function in an
environment akin to the world in
which we are living. All societies
have rewards and punishments for
those who follow and violate
rules. We have attempted to
eliminate subtle prejudice by
writing all the rules down. Each
child gets a copy of them. A
teacher has to see a child break a
rule before a demerit is given.
There can be no hearsay . . ."
Tutko went on to explain that
the staff was very pleased with the
results of the demerit system. Less
than one percent of the students
were repeatedly suspended.
500 Attend Meeting
After nine weeks of trial, the
system had virtually eliminated
food-throwing in the cafeteria,
fighting, running in the halls,
littering of the playground,
bicycle vandalism, and insolence
