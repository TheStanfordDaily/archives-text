# Spikers Host Champs
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's varsity track team opens its 1970
dual meet season tomorrow when it hosts the
defending NCAA champions, San Jose State at
1:30. Since they are ineligible for this year's
nationals, the Spartans will have to gain any
national recognition through their dual meet
performances, so they will be going full out in
tomorrow's meet.
The Spartans will be decided favorites in
tomorrow's meet which will be the first dual meet
ever held on Stanford Stadium's new all-weather
track. The Spartans are of course led by their usual
fine array of sprinters including Olympian Ronnie
Ray Smith and world record holder in the 50 yard
dash, Kirk Clayton. Smith and Clayton have both
run 9.3 hundreds while Smith also has a 20.4 220
to his credit.
Stanford has five returning point-winners from
last year's Pac-8 championships, but the most
attention will be focused on freshman pole vaulter
Casey Carrigan. Carrigan, the youngest track
Olympian in history, has cleared 17-4 3 /4. He will
have to challenge the Spartans Sam Caruthers who
has gone 17-lVi and Vic Dias and Bob Slover who
have both cleared 16-6.
Hig Shots
The field events should also provide some other
interesting matchups. In the shot put, SJS should
be favored with Richard Marks having a 63-10
throw to his credit. But Marks has been slowed by
a hand injury and he should get a good battle from
Stanford team captain T.C. Jones (58-s'/2) and

fellow teammate Gary O'Sullivan (57-11). In the
discus, Stanford's Steve Davis (182-6) will be
pitted against O'Sullivan (178-0). The high jump
will have two 6-8 performers entered, the Indians
Dave Harper and the Spartans Reggie Morris. In
the triple jump Allen Meredith (51-Va) a transfer
from Cal will make his Stanford debut against SJS'
Adrian Porter (50-10).
Stanford will be favored to make its best
showing in the distance events. Duncan Macdonald
(4:08.9) and freshman Decker Underwood
(4:11.2) will be favored in the mile and Greg
Brock (8:19.8) has a good chance in the two mile,
although the Spartan's Ralph Gamez (8:52.0)
might give Brock some trouble. The steeplechase
should also be close with State's Darold Dent
(9:00.8) facing the Card's Brook Thomas (9:08.8).
Hurdles Could Be Toss-up
The hurdles should be very close with the
Tribe's Rick Tipton (13.9) facing George Carty
(13.5) and Sam Caruthers (13.9). In the
intermediate hurdles, Randy White (51.5) will be
facing the Spartans Len Gaskill (52.2). White
(48.2) is scheduled to also run the 440 against
Elmo Dees (47.2). In the half mile Jamaican
Neville Mvton (1:47.2) will lead SJS against Pete
Fairchild (1 :49.4).
It should be noted that many of the times
mentioned in this article are from last season and
may not be very dependable at this time of year.
But even taking this into consideration, Stanford
will be hard-pressed to finish closer than 25 points
behind the Spartans.

to his credit.
Stanford has five returning point-winners from
last year's Pac-8 championships, but the most
attention will be focused on freshman pole vaulter
Casey Carrigan. Carrigan, the youngest track
Olympian in history, has cleared 17-4 3 /4. He will
have to challenge the Spartans Sam Caruthers who
has gone 17-lVi and Vic Dias and Bob Slover who
have both cleared 16-6.
Hig Shots
The field events should also provide some other
interesting matchups. In the shot put, SJS should
be favored with Richard Marks having a 63-10
throw to his credit. But Marks has been slowed by
a hand injury and he should get a good battle from
Stanford team captain T.C. Jones (58-s'/2) and

fellow teammate Gary O'Sullivan (57-11). In the
discus, Stanford's Steve Davis (182-6) will be
pitted against O'Sullivan (178-0). The high jump
will have two 6-8 performers entered, the Indians
Dave Harper and the Spartans Reggie Morris. In
the triple jump Allen Meredith (51-Va) a transfer
from Cal will make his Stanford debut against SJS'
Adrian Porter (50-10).
Stanford will be favored to make its best
showing in the distance events. Duncan Macdonald
(4:08.9) and freshman Decker Underwood
(4:11.2) will be favored in the mile and Greg
Brock (8:19.8) has a good chance in the two mile,
although the Spartan's Ralph Gamez (8:52.0)
might give Brock some trouble. The steeplechase
should also be close with State's Darold Dent
(9:00.8) facing the Card's Brook Thomas (9:08.8).
Hurdles Could Be Toss-up
The hurdles should be very close with the
Tribe's Rick Tipton (13.9) facing George Carty
(13.5) and Sam Caruthers (13.9). In the
intermediate hurdles, Randy White (51.5) will be
facing the Spartans Len Gaskill (52.2). White
(48.2) is scheduled to also run the 440 against
Elmo Dees (47.2). In the half mile Jamaican
Neville Mvton (1:47.2) will lead SJS against Pete
Fairchild (1 :49.4).
It should be noted that many of the times
mentioned in this article are from last season and
may not be very dependable at this time of year.
But even taking this into consideration, Stanford
will be hard-pressed to finish closer than 25 points
behind the Spartans.

Stanford's varsity track team opens its 1970
dual meet season tomorrow when it hosts the
defending NCAA champions, San Jose State at
1:30. Since they are ineligible for this year's
nationals, the Spartans will have to gain any
national recognition through their dual meet
performances, so they will be going full out in
tomorrow's meet.
The Spartans will be decided favorites in
tomorrow's meet which will be the first dual meet
ever held on Stanford Stadium's new all-weather
track. The Spartans are of course led by their usual
fine array of sprinters including Olympian Ronnie
Ray Smith and world record holder in the 50 yard
dash, Kirk Clayton. Smith and Clayton have both
run 9.3 hundreds while Smith also has a 20.4 220
to his credit.
