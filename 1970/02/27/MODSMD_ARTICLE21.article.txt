# Weekend Roundup
## Gymnasts Keyed For Season Finale 
### 
Unimpeachable sources
indicated late this week that
Stanford gymnasts should hit
their season high tomorrow night
against Oregon and USC.
Which is nice since it is the
final home and dual meet of the
season.
"We're in one piece finally,"
according to Coach Dan Millman,
"and we ought to hit our dual
meet peak. We'll definitely be up
for this one."
Optimism stems from the
return of Chris Harrold to vaulting
and Murray Kephart to free
exercise and the high bar. And
Steve Rochelle, who did
magnificently on the rings last
week, has done even better in
practice, Millman says.
Stanford should be close to
Oregon in final scoring, while the
Trojans will probably be out of
reach. SC will feature moves not
seen in Encina Pavilion this year,
and the Indians will also unleash
new routines.
Millman will conclude the
evening with a repeat of his
popular trampoline exhibition last
week. Meet time is 7:30 p.m.
Baseball
The varsity faces Santa Clara in
Sunken Diamond this afternoon
at 2:30. The Cards, 9-1 on the
season, will go with Phil Keller on
the mound in the spring's first
revival of this old, hard-fought,
and occasionally bitter rivalry. It
should be a helluva game.
On Saturday the Tribe travels
to Fresno for a doubleheader
beginning at 12:30. The Stanford
Braves take on the Santa Clara
frosh at noon Saturday in a
twinbill here.

Keller is coming off a
sensational effort last Saturday
against Cal Poly of Pomona. In
that contest he hurled nine
scoreless innings, only tc lose 1-0
in the tenth. The senior
righthander brings a 1.06 ERA
into today's game. The Indian
with the hottest bat these days is
junior Curt Fant, who's hitting
.500.
The Braves, coached by Jim
Jones, had the unfamiliar feeling
this morning of waking up after a
loss. They dropped a 2-1 decision
to DeAnza yesterday and are now
10-2 on the season.
Oil The Road
Three Stanford teams will see
action in Berkeley against Cal.
The wrestlers close their dual
meet season starting at 7:30
Saturday. In rugby, the Indians
and Bears battle in the first of
back-to-back meetings to decide
the winner of the Big Axe. The
Bears have one of their finest
teams ever this year. The game
starts at 1:30 Saturday. And in
tennis, the varsity winds up play
in the Northern California
Intercollegiates. Stanford jumped

to an 18-9 lead over Cal in
Wednesday's opening matches.
No. 2 seed Roscoe Tanner won his
two sets by shutouts.
Basketball
Stanford's luckless basketball
team is fortunate enough tonight
to be the first squad this year to
face UCLA after the Bruins have
lost a game. Demoted to the No. 2
spot in the AP poll, the Bruins
will be out to prove their
superiority. For you fans with
masochistic tendencies, the ordeal
will be beamed back to the Bay
Area via KBHK-TV (Ch. 44) at 8
p.m.
Presuming the Indians are still
alive, they get a chance to avenge
this season's defeat by USC on
Saturday night. The Cards might
be aided by two factors: The
Trojans could be caught looking
at next weekend's two games with
UCLA, and USC's leading guard,
Dennis Layton, has been slowed
by a groin injury. The Stanford
frosh play at San Jose State
Saturday at 7 p.m.
The freshmen will be out to a
venge one of their two season
looses. The Spartababes nipped

Stanford 75-72 in their season
opener early in December, but
since that time the Indians have
greatly improved, winning 12 of
their last 13 games.
The varsity, meanwhile, will
need even more than the usually
effective shooting from their
guards to have any chance at
winning this weekend.
Claude Terry is averaging 19
points a game this season, and
with 418 points already, will be
trying to move up from 13th
position on Stanford's all-time
scoring list for one campaign.
Dennis O'Neill is averaging
16.9 and needs only 28 points to
join Terry in the "400-point
club."

their season high tomorrow night
against Oregon and USC.
Which is nice since it is the
final home and dual meet of the
season.
"We're in one piece finally,"
according to Coach Dan Millman,
"and we ought to hit our dual
meet peak. We'll definitely be up
for this one."
Optimism stems from the
return of Chris Harrold to vaulting
and Murray Kephart to free
exercise and the high bar. And
Steve Rochelle, who did
magnificently on the rings last
week, has done even better in
practice, Millman says.
Stanford should be close to
Oregon in final scoring, while the
Trojans will probably be out of
reach. SC will feature moves not
seen in Encina Pavilion this year,
and the Indians will also unleash
new routines.
Millman will conclude the
evening with a repeat of his
popular trampoline exhibition last
week. Meet time is 7:30 p.m.
Baseball
The varsity faces Santa Clara in
Sunken Diamond this afternoon
at 2:30. The Cards, 9-1 on the
season, will go with Phil Keller on
the mound in the spring's first
revival of this old, hard-fought,
and occasionally bitter rivalry. It
should be a helluva game.
On Saturday the Tribe travels
to Fresno for a doubleheader
beginning at 12:30. The Stanford
Braves take on the Santa Clara
frosh at noon Saturday in a
twinbill here.

Keller is coming off a
sensational effort last Saturday
against Cal Poly of Pomona. In
that contest he hurled nine
scoreless innings, only tc lose 1-0
in the tenth. The senior
righthander brings a 1.06 ERA
into today's game. The Indian
with the hottest bat these days is
junior Curt Fant, who's hitting
.500.
The Braves, coached by Jim
Jones, had the unfamiliar feeling
this morning of waking up after a
loss. They dropped a 2-1 decision
to DeAnza yesterday and are now
10-2 on the season.
Oil The Road
Three Stanford teams will see
action in Berkeley against Cal.
The wrestlers close their dual
meet season starting at 7:30
Saturday. In rugby, the Indians
and Bears battle in the first of
back-to-back meetings to decide
the winner of the Big Axe. The
Bears have one of their finest
teams ever this year. The game
starts at 1:30 Saturday. And in
tennis, the varsity winds up play
in the Northern California
Intercollegiates. Stanford jumped

to an 18-9 lead over Cal in
Wednesday's opening matches.
No. 2 seed Roscoe Tanner won his
two sets by shutouts.
Basketball
Stanford's luckless basketball
team is fortunate enough tonight
to be the first squad this year to
face UCLA after the Bruins have
lost a game. Demoted to the No. 2
spot in the AP poll, the Bruins
will be out to prove their
superiority. For you fans with
masochistic tendencies, the ordeal
will be beamed back to the Bay
Area via KBHK-TV (Ch. 44) at 8
p.m.
Presuming the Indians are still
alive, they get a chance to avenge
this season's defeat by USC on
Saturday night. The Cards might
be aided by two factors: The
Trojans could be caught looking
at next weekend's two games with
UCLA, and USC's leading guard,
Dennis Layton, has been slowed
by a groin injury. The Stanford
frosh play at San Jose State
Saturday at 7 p.m.
The freshmen will be out to a
venge one of their two season
looses. The Spartababes nipped

Stanford 75-72 in their season
opener early in December, but
since that time the Indians have
greatly improved, winning 12 of
their last 13 games.
The varsity, meanwhile, will
need even more than the usually
effective shooting from their
guards to have any chance at
winning this weekend.
Claude Terry is averaging 19
points a game this season, and
with 418 points already, will be
trying to move up from 13th
position on Stanford's all-time
scoring list for one campaign.
Dennis O'Neill is averaging
16.9 and needs only 28 points to
join Terry in the "400-point
club."
