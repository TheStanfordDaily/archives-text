# Pitzer's ROTC Stand Still Leaves Questions
## 
### First in a series.) By BILL FREIVOGEL 
The story of why the
Academic Senate has granted
ROTC limited credit after taking
it away last year is largely told
through the words and actions of
President Kenneth Pitzer.
On February 13, 1969, the
Academic Senate voted that
"there should be no academic
credit received for participation in
programs of military training and
education."
But just over a month ago, the
Senate modified that stand in
adopting the Army's proposal of
"credit for (ROTC) courses taught
on the same basis as other courses
taught at the University."
On Monday, the Academic
Council will review this position.
What happened between the
somewhat contradictory Senate
actions is entwined in Pitzer's
establishment of the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC
Affairs and in the action of the
committee itself.
It was the Advisory Committee
that considered administration
negotiations with the Defense
Department. And it was this
committee which recommended

to Pitzer in early January that he
accept the Army proposal subject
to modification by the Senate on
the issue of academic credit.
Key Questions
In analyzing Pitzer's actions
and those of the committee, a
number of key questions arise.
-Were questions of academic
credit still open to review by the

committee, Pitzer seems to
consider the credit question
settled. He wrote: "In my view,
there is a real difference between -
on the one hand, decisions
concerning academic course credit
and faculty status - and on the
other hand, arrangements for an
extracurricular activity.
Faculty Dominant?
"In the first area the formal
faculty decision is a dominant
factor, whereas in the second area
student views are of comparable
weight, and practical factors
require special administrative
input.
"Thus, if the Academic
Council action leaves open the
consideration of academic credit
for courses taught by military
officers, clearly an Academic
Council committee should be
established.
"However, if no questions of
academic credit or faculty status
remain to be considered, I believe
a Presidential committee would be
more appropriate."
Presidential Committee
A Presidential Committee was
established thereby implying that
"no questions of academic credit
. . remain to be considered."
This implication seemed
confirmed by a May 5 memo from
Schiff and Bach:
"The main issues remaining are
administrative ones, though the
problems of transition of a new
ROTC status, will involve some
academic matter."
By June, Pitzer seemed to have
changed his stance slightly. In his
charge to the newly formed
Advisory Committee he asked
them, "To insure, on behalf of my
office and of the Senate, that such
revisions as may be negotiated
with the Department of Defense
and the military services are
consistent with the spirit of the
Senate actions and of the faculty's
views as expressed in the April
referendum with due
consideration also of the student
and trustee view points as
expressed by their respective
resolutions."
The new stress on student and
trustee resolutions allowed the
Advisory Committee to undertake
a broader range of inquiry than at
first seemed possible in the
Pitzer-Schiff, Bach
correspondence.
The importance of this
phrasing in the charge is amplified
in light of the minutes from the
first meeting of the committee on
October 14.
They read: "Mr. Brooks (Vice
Provost Howard Brooks) read an
exchange of memoranda between
the President and Professors Bach
and Schiff. . . The Bach-Schiff
letter indicated that the 'main
issues remaining are administrative
ones, though the problems of
transition to a new ROTC status
will involve some academic
matters.'
Any Question
"The committee concluded,
however, that nothing in the
charge to the Committee prevents
it from considering and rendering
advice on any question it deems
appropriate."
Committee member Lyman
Van Slyke criticized the
committee's broad interpretation
during the proceedings. Reflecting

on the deliberations yesterday,-:
Van Slyke said, "I think the:j
President just had a broader view
of what the committee should do
than I.
"I think the purpose should
have been to implement the
Senate's six resolutions (passed on
February 13, 1969)," he
continued. "But the letter of
commission of the President was
somewhat broader and the
committee construed it broadly.
Back To Senate
"The President hoped to
moderate the action that the
Senate took last spring,
presumably by taking advice that
would allow him to go back to the
Senate," he said.
Most disagreed with Van Slyke,
however. Their views and the
other questions about the ROTC
actions will be considered in an
article on Monday.

Van Slyke said, "I think the:j
President just had a broader view
of what the committee should do
than I.
"I think the purpose should
have been to implement the
Senate's six resolutions (passed on
February 13, 1969)," he
continued. "But the letter of
commission of the President was
somewhat broader and the
committee construed it broadly.
Back To Senate
"The President hoped to
moderate the action that the
Senate took last spring,
presumably by taking advice that
would allow him to go back to the
Senate," he said.
Most disagreed with Van Slyke,
however. Their views and the
other questions about the ROTC
actions will be considered in an
article on Monday.
The story of why the
Academic Senate has granted
ROTC limited credit after taking
it away last year is largely told
through the words and actions of
President Kenneth Pitzer.
On February 13, 1969, the
Academic Senate voted that
"there should be no academic
credit received for participation in
programs of military training and
education."
But just over a month ago, the
Senate modified that stand in
adopting the Army's proposal of
"credit for (ROTC) courses taught
on the same basis as other courses
taught at the University."
On Monday, the Academic
Council will review this position.
What happened between the
somewhat contradictory Senate
actions is entwined in Pitzer's
establishment of the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC
Affairs and in the action of the
committee itself.
It was the Advisory Committee
that considered administration
negotiations with the Defense
Department. And it was this
committee which recommended

to Pitzer in early January that he
accept the Army proposal subject
to modification by the Senate on
the issue of academic credit.
Key Questions
In analyzing Pitzer's actions
and those of the committee, a
number of key questions arise.
-Were questions of academic
credit still open to review by the

committee, Pitzer seems to
consider the credit question
settled. He wrote: "In my view,
there is a real difference between -
on the one hand, decisions
concerning academic course credit
and faculty status - and on the
other hand, arrangements for an
extracurricular activity.
Faculty Dominant?
"In the first area the formal
faculty decision is a dominant
factor, whereas in the second area
student views are of comparable
weight, and practical factors
require special administrative
input.
"Thus, if the Academic
Council action leaves open the
consideration of academic credit
for courses taught by military
officers, clearly an Academic
Council committee should be
established.
"However, if no questions of
academic credit or faculty status
remain to be considered, I believe
a Presidential committee would be
more appropriate."
Presidential Committee
A Presidential Committee was
established thereby implying that
"no questions of academic credit
. . remain to be considered."
This implication seemed
confirmed by a May 5 memo from
Schiff and Bach:
"The main issues remaining are
administrative ones, though the
problems of transition of a new
ROTC status, will involve some
academic matter."
By June, Pitzer seemed to have
changed his stance slightly. In his
charge to the newly formed
Advisory Committee he asked
them, "To insure, on behalf of my
office and of the Senate, that such
revisions as may be negotiated
with the Department of Defense
and the military services are
consistent with the spirit of the
Senate actions and of the faculty's
views as expressed in the April
referendum with due
consideration also of the student
and trustee view points as
expressed by their respective
resolutions."
The new stress on student and
trustee resolutions allowed the
Advisory Committee to undertake
a broader range of inquiry than at
first seemed possible in the
Pitzer-Schiff, Bach
correspondence.
The importance of this
phrasing in the charge is amplified
in light of the minutes from the
first meeting of the committee on
October 14.
They read: "Mr. Brooks (Vice
Provost Howard Brooks) read an
exchange of memoranda between
the President and Professors Bach
and Schiff. . . The Bach-Schiff
letter indicated that the 'main
issues remaining are administrative
ones, though the problems of
transition to a new ROTC status
will involve some academic
matters.'
Any Question
"The committee concluded,
however, that nothing in the
charge to the Committee prevents
it from considering and rendering
advice on any question it deems
appropriate."

Van Slyke criticized the
committee's broad interpretation

They read: "Mr. Brooks (Vice
Provost Howard Brooks) read an
exchange of memoranda between
the President and Professors Bach
and Schiff. . . The Bach-Schiff
letter indicated that the 'main
issues remaining are administrative
ones, though the problems of
transition to a new ROTC status
will involve some academic
matters.'
Any Question
"The committee concluded,
however, that nothing in the
charge to the Committee prevents
it from considering and rendering
advice on any question it deems
appropriate."
Committee member Lyman
Van Slyke criticized the
committee's broad interpretation
during the proceedings. Reflecting

on the deliberations yesterday,-:
Van Slyke said, "I think the:j
President just had a broader view
of what the committee should do
than I.
"I think the purpose should
have been to implement the
Senate's six resolutions (passed on
February 13, 1969)," he
continued. "But the letter of
commission of the President was
somewhat broader and the
committee construed it broadly.
Back To Senate
"The President hoped to
moderate the action that the
Senate took last spring,
presumably by taking advice that
would allow him to go back to the
Senate," he said.
Most disagreed with Van Slyke,
however. Their views and the
other questions about the ROTC
actions will be considered in an
article on Monday.
