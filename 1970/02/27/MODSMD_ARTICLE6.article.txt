## UCSB Disturbances Continue 
### 
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -
Holding plastic shields to ward off
rocks and bottles, about 150
policemen swept through the
debris - strewn streets of a
suburban college community
Thursday night where some 500
youths were milling about in
defiance of a curfew.
About a half dozen young
persons were arrested, including
one girl. A sheriff's spokesman
said a boy was hit by a squad car
and taken to a hospital with
undetermined injuries.
The youngsters lit bonfires in
trash bins and pelted police cars
and officers with rocks and
bottles but did not renew the
violent rioting of early Thursday
when a bank was burned to the
ground and other fires were set
and windows broken.
Police patrolled the
one-square-mile community of
Isla Vista in the early evening but
then retreated to a parking lot at
the nearbv University of

California at Santa Barbara. At
9:30 p.m. they began the sweep,
charging down streets in squads of
25 men. Youngsters yelled
obscenities, threw objects and
scattered.
Earlier, Gov. Ronald Reagan
had declared a state of extreme
emergency in the area and Santa
Barbara County supervisors had
ordered a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew
there.
Wall ace Running
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -
George C. Wallace announced
Thursday he will seek the
Alabama governor's office again,
saying his candidacy would be "a
thorn in the side of the Nixon
administration."
He predicted at a news
conference that President Nixon
"is going to make some
concessions on school integration
he wouldn't make if 1 weren't
running, and he'll make even more

after I'm elected."
To be elected, Wallace must
defeat at least four other
candidates in the May 5
Democratic primary and any
candidate who might run in the
general election. But the race
shapes up as a two-man battle
between the 50-year-old Wallace
and the current governor, Albert
Brewer.
Marines Arrested
WASHINGTON (AP) - Secretary
of Defense Melvin R. Laird said
Thursday American air-power but
no ground forces are being used in
Laos to protect the U.S. position
in Vietnam. He said there has
been no basic change in U.S.
policy toward Laos.
"The President has made clear
that the use of American
air-power in Laos is to protect
U.S. forces in Vietnam," Laird
told newsmen. "We have no
military forces engaged in ground
combat in Laos."
