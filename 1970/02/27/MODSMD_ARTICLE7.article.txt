# Percentage Hiring Proposed For Minorities In Construction
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN PHIL REVZIN 
A program directly specifying
the percentages of minority
workers to be employed on
university construction projects
has been recommended by
University Construction Manager
Lucien Stark. It is intended to
increase Stanford's role in hiring
black and chicano workers.
According to Herbert Rhodes,
Minority Employment manager in
the personnel office, Stanford has
few black people employed in
construction work, and progress
has been slow in this area. Rhodes
told the Daily he "was confident
that there will be some progress
made once the university's plan is
finalized."
"The university has not done
enough in the area of recruiting
blacks and Mexican-Americans.
The record here speaks for itself,"
Rhodes commented.
In u meeting with Business
Manager Dwight Adams
Wednesday, Stark proposed a
program similar to that negotiated
between Harvard University and
Jackson Construction Company

of Needham, Mass. for two new
campus buildings at Harvard.
The agreement at Harvard was
worked out by Harvard overseer
Clifford Alexander Jr., former
chairman of the Federal Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission. It requires Jackson
to employ between 19 and 23
percent black and other minority
workers in the campus
construction.
The agreement also requires
that minority employment be
spread over the whole range of
construction jobs—not just in the
lower-paying, un-skilled labor
positions.
Current Practice
Stark noted that Stanford's
current practice of insuring
adequate representation of
minority groups in campus
construction follows the
guidelines established by
government agencies for funding.
Presidential order by John F.
Kennedy developed federal
requirements for the "Affirmative
Action" programs, in which
special efforts are made to employ
minority group members.
In the present process the

contractor presents his proposal
for employment of minority
workers to the university for
review. The university can revise
his proposal if it feels that the
federal government will not
approve.
"1 have felt that the
Affirmative Action programs are
not at all adequate," declared
Stark. "These are fairly nebulous
constraints with no standard of
performance to shoot for. I favor
instead specifying percentages."
Now Twenty Percent
Stark told the Daily that on
university construction projects,
whether federally funded or not,
20 percent of the workers are
from minority groups, as of
January 1, 1970. Stark noted that
problems generally lie with
outside contractors, who are not
directly under the control of the
university.
Inspectors from Stark's office
make a head-count of minority
workers employed by each
contractor at Stanford every
month and report their findings
back to him. "If an insufficiency
is noted we then say to the
contractor that he doesn't have
enough minority workers and that
the University is officially
dissatisfied. Unfortunately we just
can't do much more than that,"
explained the Construction
Manager.
"We recently ran into a
problem with a subcontractor
working in the Escondido Village
construction site. We demanded
that he do more than he was
doing in terms of employing
minority workers.
Lack Authority
"In a sense we 'read the riot
act' to him, expressing our own
and the government's
dissatisfaction. We wanted both
explanation and improvement.
Things have improved since then,
but you can see the University's
lack of real authority in these
matters."
Rhodes noted that the
Minority Employment Office
could find enough workers to fill
larger percentages, but the
"unions won't hire people unless
they have a job, so the whole
thing is a vicious circle."

From a contractor's point of
view, noted Stark, there is a
certain amount of truth in the
complaint that there aren't
enough skilled minority group
workers to meet the University's
demands, much less fixed
percentages. The basic stumbling
block involves apprenticeship for
the skilled journeymen positions.
Not Hired
Apprenticeship naturally
involves a fair amount of time for
the unskilled laborer to learn the
skills of a particular vocation; in
the past, Stark explained, many
minority workers have felt that
the apprenticeship period was
useless because they simply were
not hired by the construction
companies even after their
training period.
Some groups in the Bay Area
are now involved in putting large
numbers of minority workers
through apprenticeship training.
"Thus, we can demand that a
contractor employ more minority
workers, and then pull out a list
of perfectly qualified men to fill
the quotas. Then the contractor
can have no excuse," Stark said.
"In the near future, as more
minority workers go through
apprenticeship, there will
certainly be an adequate amount
of skilled journeymen to satisfy
the needs of any contractor," he
declared.
Finding enough skilled
minority workers is a major
concern at Harvard and
surrounding universities that have
been pressured by students to
increase the number of minority
workers on campus construction
projects. According to an official
from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, "Harvard will
never find enough experienced
black workers in Boston without
pulling them off jobs at our
schools—and then we'll get it from
our black students."
Joel Leighton, head of
Massachusetts' Associated General
Contractors, charged that the
Harvard plart "does not involve
training, has no provision for
continuity of employment and
will not bring any new minority
workers into the industry."
