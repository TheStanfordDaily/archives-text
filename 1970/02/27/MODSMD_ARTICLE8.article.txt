# Lyman Speaks To Student Senate
## 
### TINA COOPER 
Provost Richard Lyman and
three representatives from the
Academic Senate last night
addressed the Student Senate in
an unusually quiet meeting.
Lyman, doing most of the
speaking, expressed his belief that
"good hard work by committed
people" was needed to relieve the
problem of racism; a campus
convocation alone would not be
enough.
He pointed out that a backlash
from the progress made by blacks
had occurred. "Some of the
unhappy episodes that happen no
doubt stem from misunderstand
ing," he said. "In a sense, perhaps
they all stem from
misunderstanding."
Lyman went on to present
University action against
discrimination, such as the
formation of a committee to "use
the University's position as a
major purchaser of goods and
services to help in promoting
minority employment and
welfare." (See related article on
this page.)
Individual Action
The Provost ended by urging
each person to take individual

action. "We can be sure of doing
something about racism in our
immediate lives," he said. "We
can, each one of us, 'solve' some
part of the race problem."
In the following
question-and-answer period,
Lyman castigated Vice-President
Agnew's derogatory speech on
open admissions as a "despicable
statement." He agreed to consider
sending an open letter disagreeing
with that speech to Agnew.
Senators Paul Witt and Rick
Atkins brought up questions
about today's visit to Stanford by
French President Georges
Pompidou. Atkins pointed out
that there were no minority-group
students scheduled to be present
at discussions with Pompidou, and
asked that Lyman use his
influence to include a member of
the Jewish community.
Too Late To Change
Lyman replied, "It's too late to
change now, arrangements aVe
fixed; and Mr. Pompidou is not
being left in ignorance as to the
views of that minority."
Senators Yale Braunstein and
John Shoch asked Lyman if his
power as Provost extended to that
of taking over the powers of the
President when he is away;
specifically to authorize a special
discussion in the Academic Senate
on ROTC.
"You assumed the President's
position during the sit-in last year;
why not this year to prevent a
sit-in?" asked Shoch.
Lyman answered that the issue
was not of that much urgency, the
Academic Senate was already
quite familiar with it, and Pitzer
had informally said he did not
want the special discussion. The
issue was dropped.
Grade Book
Faculty Senate Representative
Philip Dawson spoke on
Education Council action, and
was asked by Shoch about the
existence of a small book,
circulated through the faculty,
listing students' grade point
averages and general work record.
Lyman said he had discontinued
the practice.
The final questions concerned
SRI. "How do you feel about the,
sale of SRI? betrayed by? ftte
Trustees?" asked Braunstein. ''Do
you feel it was worth selling?"
asked Witt.
"I thought the relationship was
wrong and should be dissolved
long ago," replied Lyman. "It was
worth selling for what we got."

the University's position as a
major purchaser of goods and
services to help in promoting
minority employment and
welfare." (See related article on
this page.)
Individual Action
The Provost ended by urging
each person to take individual

action. "We can be sure of doing
something about racism in our
immediate lives," he said. "We
can, each one of us, 'solve' some
part of the race problem."
In the following
question-and-answer period,
Lyman castigated Vice-President
Agnew's derogatory speech on
open admissions as a "despicable
statement." He agreed to consider
sending an open letter disagreeing
with that speech to Agnew.
Senators Paul Witt and Rick
Atkins brought up questions
about today's visit to Stanford by
French President Georges
Pompidou. Atkins pointed out
that there were no minority-group
students scheduled to be present
at discussions with Pompidou, and
asked that Lyman use his
influence to include a member of
the Jewish community.
Too Late To Change
Lyman replied, "It's too late to
change now, arrangements aVe
fixed; and Mr. Pompidou is not
being left in ignorance as to the
views of that minority."
Senators Yale Braunstein and
John Shoch asked Lyman if his
power as Provost extended to that
of taking over the powers of the
President when he is away;
specifically to authorize a special
discussion in the Academic Senate
on ROTC.
"You assumed the President's
position during the sit-in last year;
why not this year to prevent a
sit-in?" asked Shoch.
Lyman answered that the issue
was not of that much urgency, the
Academic Senate was already
quite familiar with it, and Pitzer
had informally said he did not
want the special discussion. The
issue was dropped.
Grade Book
Faculty Senate Representative
Philip Dawson spoke on
Education Council action, and
was asked by Shoch about the
existence of a small book,
circulated through the faculty,
listing students' grade point
averages and general work record.
Lyman said he had discontinued
the practice.
The final questions concerned
SRI. "How do you feel about the,
sale of SRI? betrayed by? ftte
Trustees?" asked Braunstein. ''Do
you feel it was worth selling?"
asked Witt.
"I thought the relationship was
wrong and should be dissolved
long ago," replied Lyman. "It was
worth selling for what we got."
Provost Richard Lyman and
three representatives from the
Academic Senate last night
addressed the Student Senate in
an unusually quiet meeting.
Lyman, doing most of the
speaking, expressed his belief that
"good hard work by committed
people" was needed to relieve the
problem of racism; a campus
convocation alone would not be
enough.
He pointed out that a backlash
from the progress made by blacks
had occurred. "Some of the
unhappy episodes that happen no
doubt stem from misunderstand
ing," he said. "In a sense, perhaps
they all stem from
misunderstanding."
Lyman went on to present
University action against
discrimination, such as the
formation of a committee to "use
the University's position as a
major purchaser of goods and
services to help in promoting
minority employment and
welfare." (See related article on
