FAMILIAR EQUATION?
It describes the dynamics of a linear system.
We use such equations in solving problems in inertia! guidance for sh ps, aircraft,
and submarines. The work involves analytical research relating to gimballed and
strapdown inertial systems & sensors including: mathematical modeling of
physical processes, inertial system error analysis, system synthesis, optimization
and evaluation in the area of Navigation, Guidance and Control
We'll be an campus Tuesday, March 1 Oth talking lo MS & Doctoral graduates in
EE, Aero/Astro or Systems who are familiar with automatic control systems and
random process theory.
The positions are located 8 miles from Boston & Cambridge and offer excellent
salaries, benefits and paid re location.
If you re interested in |Oining a small fast moving research firm and enjoy oro
fessional recognition of your work, plan to see us on Tuesday, March 10th.
