# Eight Plan Suit Over GE Clash
## 
### 
Several Stanford conservatives
plan to file suit shortly charging
Stanford University with
providing inadequate protection
for them during last Dec. 4's clash
with radicals at a demonstration
protesting General Electric
recruiting on campus. They will
ask for two million dollars in
damages.
Eight plaintiffs, calling
themselves the "Stanford Eight,"
will file suit against the University
as a corporation, contending that
they were endangered because the
University restrained police from
aiding them during a 20-minute
shoving match with radicals in
Tresidder Union.
Reliable sources say the group
will announce that they plan to
give $1,000,000 of the settlement,
if they win, to the Martin Luther
King scholarship fund, and the
other $1,000,000 to a
newl -created Robert A. Taft
memorial scholarship fund.
The eight, Harvey Hukari,
Roger Reed, Doug Greene, Chris
Hocker, Ernesto Rael, Craig
Ostfeld, Archie Schrotenboer, and
Edward Jagels, will announce
their plans at a press conference
tomorrow.

Commenting on the suit last
night to the Daily, Hockersaid,
"The attack on SC'M members was
of sufficient gravity to require
action of this kind."
Counsel for the group will
include Palo Alto attorney Roger
Mosher, and two as yet
unidentified Stanford law
students.
Last December's clash came as
protestors, picketing the
Placement Center to prevent a GE
interviewer from interviewing on
campus, chased Arena
photographers Greene and Ostfeld
across White Plaza to Tresidder, in
an effort to destroy film of the
protest taken by the pair.
Uniformed Stanford police, and
Santa Clara County officers, on
campus to guard Israeli
Ambassador Itzhak Rabin, were
not called in to break up the
shoving match. Campus Police
Captain William Wullschleger
explained at the time that he felt
that calling in the police would
only escalate the action.
Provost Richard Lyman last
night said the damages asked for
"sounds like an outlandish sum I
thought Harvey was reasonably
satisfied at the time, but I guess
he wasn't."
