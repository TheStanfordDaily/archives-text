# Potential For Abuse
## A 						Question Of Usage

We live in a pragmatic culture that subordinates
discovery to invention; many of us are quite
incapable of perceiving a new insight until we hear
how ti can be applied to "do" something. At one
level, this was the appeal to scientific readers of
the report some weeks ago from Harvard of a
technique for the "isolation of a gene" from
bacteria.
At another level, the exposition by Drs. Jim
Shapiro and Jon Beckwith of their work through
news channels emphasized hypothetical biological
engineering applications to the detriment of public
clarity about the scientific implications of their
work. They were explicitly quoted as having
expressed grave concerns about the potential abuse
of their science —which led to some headlines in
London that read "GENETIC BOMB FEARS
GROW."
What has not come through is precisely what
they were concerned about. I believe they
correctly pointed to the possible abuse of the
whole fabric of modern experimental biology,
rather than the single ingenious thread they helped
weave into it.
Potential for Abuse
The most grievous potential for abuse was, in
fact, the subject of a major shift in U.S. policy
within days of the Harvard biochemists' report. On
November 25, President Nixon unilaterally
pledged the country to drop its work on the
development of biological weapons. Subsequently,
toxin-weapons have been included in the ban, and
the U.S. has joined in formal proposals for global
prohibitions on biological warfare.
Until such agreements are ratified and
implemented, the danger still remains that the
most sophisticated aspects of scientific biology, on
the trail of the essence of life, will be mobilized in
the service of an attack on large parts of the
world's population. We have begun to pursue the
right track, perhaps just in time—before other
warrior nations develop comparable scientific skills
in this area, and we respond with an unstoppable

escalation.
While genetic engineering is a tangible reality
for bacteria and viruses, it is a futuristic
speculation for direct application in the human
organism.
Closest on the horizon are some approaches
towards the engineering of viruses, for the
improvement of conventional vaccines, or to
reintroduce the codes for disease-related enzymes
that may be missing by virtue of a genetic defect.
Direct Intervention Bypassed
It is not obvious how these applications raise
questions much different from those already
encompassed by medical practice. They may also
bypass any motive to deal with genetic diseases by
direct intervention in the genes as inherited
through sperms and eggs, should this become
technically possible.
We cannot, of course, overlook the fear that an
authoritarian regime may impose its engineered
designs on the life styles of its subjects. To think
of this as a side-effect of biological research may
divert attention from the real dimensions of the
problem, which is slavery, and its sources in moral,
social, military or political disasters.
Its inhuman ends have been well served
historically by techniques both frightful and
insidious: Hitler's exterminatoria, forcible
impregnation and sterilization, drugs and thought
control. Molecular biology will have little to add
to that repertoire.
We should nevertheless seek to extend the
groundwork of law to bolster the freedom of the
person. The prevalent laws restricting abortion
amount to compulsory pregnancy on a large scale,
an intrusion on personal freedom and privacy as
repugnant as compulsory absortion. The decision
about abortion is one for private morals; but the
woman who voluntarily foregoes an unwanted
child prevents a crime against him and does a
service to the community which deserves our
compassionate support.
