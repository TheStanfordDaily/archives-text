# Middle East
## Understanding 
### John R. Wilson 
For several years now, the
situation in the Middle East has
been of growing concern to all of
us, both as Americans and as
human beings. The number of
articles and lectures dealing with
the difficulties in that part of the
world have increased so rapidly
since the summer of 1967 that, by
now, most of us here at Stanford
have undoubtedly come to have
some interest in the Middle East.
Therefore, several weeks ago
when I read the first article of
Miss Pat Mihaly's and the
"response" to her statements
printed the following day, 1 was
pleased, as I am sure you were, to
see what I had hoped to be the
beginning of a discussion on the
Middle East. As the articles
continued, however, I soon came
to realize that each side was more
interested in stressing the moral
and political unassailability of
their own arguments than in
entering into a constructive
discussion.
Invariably, those of us who

have an interest in the Middle Eas
and yet are not Nationals of the
area know all the facts and
arguments which make the
problem appear quite simple or, at
least, quite clear-cut for the side
whose "propaganda" we are
reading at the time. I for one
would now like to hear botl
Arabs and Israelis, both pro-Arabs
and pro-Israelis give voice not
only to their strengths but also to
their "weaknesses." For if any
type of peace is to be achieved in
the Middle East, it will hardly be
between two groups whose only
interests are in reiterating thos<
policies upon which they refuse to
compromise.
In a university atmosphere, I
should hope that most of us are
willing to be somewhat more
candid about such issues as the
Middle East situation than are our
friends in the Middle East itself
Perhaps the Arabs and pro-Arabs
ought to openly admit that the
Arab governments are following
extremely foolhardy and
unrealistic policies. However, at
the same time, they .ould also
point out that the Arab public is
essentially holding a knife at the
back of their governments ana'
would not hesitate to plunge it in
should their governments openly
abandon an anti-Israeli policy.
Perhaps the Israelis should also
admit that they realize that the
Arab world is potentially a
sleeping giant and that should it
awake, it would have little trouble
forcing Israel to agree to its
demands. However, they might
also add that the likelihood of
Arab unity is rather slim and, even
if it were to come about, that
Israel would still defend herself.
In conclusion, I should like to
see the beginning of a constructive
discussion about the Middle East.
I should like to have the
opportunity to hear the people
who understand the issues express
those ideas upon which a firm
foundation for peace might be
built. In short, I should like to see
some evidence that both the
Arabs and the Israelis as well as
their respective supporters are
willing to try to understand one
another and, perhaps, even to try
to reach a compromise, if not on
the battlefield, then at least in the
pages of a university newspaper.
