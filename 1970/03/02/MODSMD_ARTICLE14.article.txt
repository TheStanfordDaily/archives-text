Editor, THE DAILY:
Social scientists point out that
organizations tend to lose sight of
the objectives that were their
original justification and become
preoccupied with the conditions
of their own survival. Such a shift
in goals was rationalized by
Augustine (reason of Church), the
followers of Machiavelli (reason of
state), extended to bureaucracies
in general in the nineteenth
century, and today we note a
development that looks
suspiciously like "reason of
university."
One can sympathize with the
plight of a college president,
desperate in his attempt to keep
the budget balanced and the gifts
and contracts coming in, but, at

the same time one longs for an
occasional discussion of the
purposes of a university—particu
larly of undergraduate education.
In the controversy over academic
credit for ROTC such
consideration of objectives seems
particularly appropriate, but the
Daily's account of faculty opinion
reveals very little concern for
these purposes.
Traditionally the university has
represented itself as embodying a
conception of education which
emphasizes the development of
critical and logical thinking, on
the one hand, and an appreciation
of the values of the cultural
heritage, on the other. It is
difficult to see how an ROTC
program can be reconciled with

either objective.
The justification must lie
elsewhere —perhaps in a principle
derived from the primary
objectives: the belief that the
university has obligations of
service to society. In this case, the
defense of the nation (as argued in
the letter in Friday's Daily). The
university is not the state,
however, and its legitimacy
depends on a distance from the
purposes of other social
institutions sufficient for critical
evaluation. Its service lies in the
creation and sustaining of a
humane civilization and training
for the vocations that further this
ideal. To include military training
in this civil project is to distort

the purpose of the university, to
add to the mystifications of our
age (which make analysis and
criticism so difficult), and invite
further disillusionment with
higher learning in America.
And even if this position is not
convincing, it can be argued that
ROTC has been around the
campuses long enough to
demonstrate that such university
complicity has not had a
humanizing effect on the military.
In bidding farewell to the military
we shall not be giving up our
attempt to "modify the military
mind." By knowing what our
business is, and sticking to it, we
shall have a better chance to
modify the military mind, the
criminal mind, or whatever mind.
At this moment I am more
concerned about what is
happening to our own minds.
Then, too, where do we draw the
line? What kind of training would
we object to? Counter-insurgency
operations in Brazil? Why?
Still, there is something in
Friday's letter that may continue
to haunt us. I would suggest that
on the subject of defense we ask
ourselves where the greatest
dangers lie. Regular army units are
now being trained for domestic
riot control and the management
of dissent. Since at least the
summer of 1967 the DOD has
been involved, more or less
routinely, in the maintenance of
"civil" order.
We are all aware of the
burgeoning size and influence of
the defense establishment and the
internal security apparatus, as well
as the possible consequences of
this development. Every
conservative on this campus
should appreciate that we risk a
radical departure from American
constitutional traditions. It was
never more important that the
university reaffirm its justifying
purposes. We should join the
Provost in deploring the creeping
anti-intellectualism of the day.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Now that the university has
seriously considered a
campus-wide forum on racism in
its ranks, it's time we unmasked
the racist stereotype inherent in
the nickname, "the Stanford
Indians."
From the tribal feathers atop
mini-skirted cheerleaders, to the
official Stanford souvenirs
caricatured with squat red
boy-men, we blithely appropriate
"the Indian" as the cute mascot
of our white culture. Why do we
continue to nurture the violent
indifference of a mainstream
which can so casually plunder and
dismiss the culture of others?
Lest any such reference to the
integrity of an American Indian
culture strain our imagination, we
need only consider the
implications to the university had
her founding fathers declared
us—can you dig it?—"the Stanford
Negroes."
Our "white problem"—as
Stanford students or whatever—is
not that we hate Indians, black
people, or any other ethnic group.
Our problem, rather, is that we
love ourselves too much—to the
point where we are unable to
admit others into our lives on any
but our own terms. We of the
white, upper-middle class
Stanford mainstream may in all
honesty affirm that we "don't
hate non-white people." But that,
for us white people, is not
enough.
The question before the
Stanford community, therefore, is
not, "What else, then, shall we be,
if not 'the Stanford Indians'?,"
but rathw, "What shall become of
us when we can no longer toy
with the sacred dignity of
other persons?" Perhaps only then
shall we at last have no thing, no
one to become but ourselves, as
fellow human beings.

love ourselves too much—to the
point where we are unable to
admit others into our lives on any
but our own terms. We of the
white, upper-middle class
Stanford mainstream may in all
honesty affirm that we "don't
hate non-white people." But that,
for us white people, is not
enough.
The question before the
Stanford community, therefore, is
not, "What else, then, shall we be,
if not 'the Stanford Indians'?,"
but rathw, "What shall become of
us when we can no longer toy
with the sacred dignity of
other persons?" Perhaps only then
shall we at last have no thing, no
one to become but ourselves, as

Editor, THE DAILY:
Social scientists point out that
organizations tend to lose sight of
the objectives that were their
original justification and become
preoccupied with the conditions
of their own survival. Such a shift
in goals was rationalized by
Augustine (reason of Church), the
followers of Machiavelli (reason of
state), extended to bureaucracies
in general in the nineteenth
century, and today we note a
development that looks
suspiciously like "reason of
university."
One can sympathize with the
plight of a college president,
desperate in his attempt to keep
the budget balanced and the gifts
and contracts coming in, but, at

the same time one longs for an
occasional discussion of the
purposes of a university—particu
larly of undergraduate education.
In the controversy over academic
credit for ROTC such
consideration of objectives seems
particularly appropriate, but the
Daily's account of faculty opinion
reveals very little concern for
these purposes.
Traditionally the university has
represented itself as embodying a
conception of education which
emphasizes the development of
critical and logical thinking, on
the one hand, and an appreciation
of the values of the cultural
heritage, on the other. It is
difficult to see how an ROTC
program can be reconciled with

either objective.
The justification must lie
elsewhere —perhaps in a principle
derived from the primary
objectives: the belief that the
university has obligations of
service to society. In this case, the
defense of the nation (as argued in
the letter in Friday's Daily). The
university is not the state,
however, and its legitimacy
depends on a distance from the
purposes of other social
institutions sufficient for critical
evaluation. Its service lies in the
creation and sustaining of a
humane civilization and training
for the vocations that further this
ideal. To include military training
in this civil project is to distort

the purpose of the university, to
add to the mystifications of our
age (which make analysis and
criticism so difficult), and invite
further disillusionment with
higher learning in America.
And even if this position is not
convincing, it can be argued that
ROTC has been around the
campuses long enough to
demonstrate that such university
complicity has not had a
humanizing effect on the military.
In bidding farewell to the military
we shall not be giving up our
attempt to "modify the military
mind." By knowing what our
business is, and sticking to it, we
shall have a better chance to
modify the military mind, the
criminal mind, or whatever mind.
At this moment I am more
concerned about what is
happening to our own minds.
Then, too, where do we draw the
line? What kind of training would
we object to? Counter-insurgency
operations in Brazil? Why?
Still, there is something in
Friday's letter that may continue
to haunt us. I would suggest that
on the subject of defense we ask
ourselves where the greatest
dangers lie. Regular army units are
now being trained for domestic
riot control and the management
of dissent. Since at least the
summer of 1967 the DOD has
been involved, more or less
routinely, in the maintenance of
"civil" order.
We are all aware of the
burgeoning size and influence of
the defense establishment and the
internal security apparatus, as well
as the possible consequences of
this development. Every
conservative on this campus
should appreciate that we risk a
radical departure from American
constitutional traditions. It was
never more important that the
university reaffirm its justifying
purposes. We should join the
Provost in deploring the creeping
anti-intellectualism of the day.

Now that the university has
seriously considered a
campus-wide forum on racism in
its ranks, it's time we unmasked
the racist stereotype inherent in
the nickname, "the Stanford
Indians."
From the tribal feathers atop
mini-skirted cheerleaders, to the
official Stanford souvenirs
caricatured with squat red
boy-men, we blithely appropriate
"the Indian" as the cute mascot
of our white culture. Why do we
continue to nurture the violent
indifference of a mainstream
which can so casually plunder and
dismiss the culture of others?
Lest any such reference to the
integrity of an American Indian
culture strain our imagination, we
need only consider the
implications to the university had
her founding fathers declared
us—can you dig it?—"the Stanford
Negroes."
Our "white problem"—as
Stanford students or whatever—is
not that we hate Indians, black
people, or any other ethnic group.
Our problem, rather, is that we
love ourselves too much—to the
point where we are unable to
admit others into our lives on any

its ranks, it's time we unmasked
the racist stereotype inherent in
the nickname, "the Stanford
Indians."
From the tribal feathers atop
mini-skirted cheerleaders, to the
official Stanford souvenirs
caricatured with squat red
boy-men, we blithely appropriate
"the Indian" as the cute mascot
of our white culture. Why do we
continue to nurture the violent
indifference of a mainstream
which can so casually plunder and
dismiss the culture of others?
Lest any such reference to the
integrity of an American Indian
culture strain our imagination, we
need only consider the
implications to the university had
her founding fathers declared
us—can you dig it?—"the Stanford
Negroes."
Our "white problem"—as
Stanford students or whatever—is
not that we hate Indians, black
people, or any other ethnic group.
Our problem, rather, is that we
love ourselves too much—to the
point where we are unable to
admit others into our lives on any
but our own terms. We of the
white, upper-middle class
Stanford mainstream may in all
honesty affirm that we "don't
hate non-white people." But that,
for us white people, is not
enough.
The question before the
Stanford community, therefore, is
not, "What else, then, shall we be,
if not 'the Stanford Indians'?,"
but rathw, "What shall become of
us when we can no longer toy
with the sacred dignity of
other persons?" Perhaps only then
shall we at last have no thing, no
one to become but ourselves, as
fellow human beings.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Social scientists point out that
organizations tend to lose sight of
the objectives that were their
original justification and become
preoccupied with the conditions
of their own survival. Such a shift
in goals was rationalized by
Augustine (reason of Church), the
followers of Machiavelli (reason of
state), extended to bureaucracies
in general in the nineteenth
century, and today we note a
development that looks
suspiciously like "reason of
university."
One can sympathize with the
plight of a college president,
desperate in his attempt to keep
the budget balanced and the gifts
and contracts coming in, but, at

the same time one longs for an
occasional discussion of the
purposes of a university—particu
larly of undergraduate education.
In the controversy over academic
credit for ROTC such
consideration of objectives seems
particularly appropriate, but the
Daily's account of faculty opinion
reveals very little concern for
these purposes.
Traditionally the university has
represented itself as embodying a
conception of education which
emphasizes the development of
critical and logical thinking, on
the one hand, and an appreciation
of the values of the cultural
heritage, on the other. It is
difficult to see how an ROTC
program can be reconciled with

either objective.
The justification must lie
elsewhere —perhaps in a principle
derived from the primary
objectives: the belief that the
university has obligations of
service to society. In this case, the
defense of the nation (as argued in
the letter in Friday's Daily). The
university is not the state,
however, and its legitimacy
depends on a distance from the
purposes of other social
institutions sufficient for critical
evaluation. Its service lies in the
creation and sustaining of a
humane civilization and training
for the vocations that further this
ideal. To include military training
in this civil project is to distort

the purpose of the university, to
add to the mystifications of our
age (which make analysis and
criticism so difficult), and invite
further disillusionment with
higher learning in America.
And even if this position is not
convincing, it can be argued that
ROTC has been around the
campuses long enough to
demonstrate that such university
complicity has not had a
humanizing effect on the military.
In bidding farewell to the military
we shall not be giving up our
attempt to "modify the military
mind." By knowing what our
business is, and sticking to it, we
shall have a better chance to
modify the military mind, the
criminal mind, or whatever mind.
At this moment I am more
concerned about what is
happening to our own minds.
Then, too, where do we draw the
line? What kind of training would
we object to? Counter-insurgency
operations in Brazil? Why?
Still, there is something in
Friday's letter that may continue
to haunt us. I would suggest that
on the subject of defense we ask
ourselves where the greatest
dangers lie. Regular army units are
now being trained for domestic
riot control and the management
of dissent. Since at least the
summer of 1967 the DOD has
been involved, more or less
routinely, in the maintenance of
"civil" order.
We are all aware of the
burgeoning size and influence of
the defense establishment and the
internal security apparatus, as well
as the possible consequences of
this development. Every
conservative on this campus
should appreciate that we risk a
radical departure from American
constitutional traditions. It was
never more important that the
university reaffirm its justifying
purposes. We should join the
Provost in deploring the creeping
anti-intellectualism of the day.
