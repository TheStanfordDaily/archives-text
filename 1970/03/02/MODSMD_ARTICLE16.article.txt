# Card Rugby Team Defeats California
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
Jack Shultz broke loose for
two tries Saturday giving the
Stanford rugby team the edge it
needed to defeat Cal 14-12 in the
first of two games to determine
the winner of the Big Scrum Axe
It was a muddy, sloppy game
and Stanford's backs had
difficulty in hanging on to the
slippery ball. They were slowed
up in the heavy going, and Cal's
field, considerably narrower than
Stanford's, simply wasn't wide
enough for the Tribe to really
open up.
Stanford, defending their axe
after two wins over the Bears last
year, got on the scoreboard first
as Shultz waded 35 yards for a try
and then Kauffman added
another. Both scores came within
the first seven minutes of play.
Cal came back to take the lead
12-6 on three penalty kicks and a
try. The Bear's conversion
attempt was wide of the mark,
and it proved to be a deciding
factor in the game.
Leon Hartvickson who tallied
18 points in last week's win over

the University of British
Columbia, narrowed the gap with
a 40 yard penalty kick, and then
converted in the clutch after
Schultz had scored again, to give
the Indians a two point margin of
victory.
Stanford will meet the Bears
again this Saturday, and the team
that totals the most points at the
end of the two matches will carry
home the coveted Axe.
Usually the series is a
home-and-home event, but both
games were played on Stanford
turf last year due to muddy
conditions up north, so the
Indians will travel to Berkeley
again this weekend to even things
up.
In other action, Stanford s
seconds dropped a tough one, 9-.J,
to Cal's second club and the
Tribe's third squad hung on for a
3-3 deadlock with Santa Clara's
seconds.
The regular season winds up
this weekend but the varsity will
continue on to the big Monterey
Tournament March 21-22 seeking
a third straight championship.
