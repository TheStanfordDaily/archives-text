# Weekend Conference
## Radicalism Called Harmful 
### 
Radicalism has done more to
prevent the progress of reform
movements in California than any
other single force, according to
Dr. Walton E. Bean, professor of
history at UC Berkeley.
He was one of the speakers
from nine different universities in
a conference celebrating tow
hundred years of California
history last week-end at Tresidder.
About 200 college and
secondary school teachers came
from all parts of California to hear
lectures on subjects ranging from
the Indians to Governor Reagan
to agriculture.
Stanford's Institute of
American History sponsored the
conference to promote research
and writing on American history
and to bring together scholars and
teachers for their mutual benefit.
Professor George Knoles of
Stanford, director of the Institute,
was chairman of the conference.
Radicalism Harmful
As an example of the harmful
effect of radicalism, Bean cited
the damage done by socialist
leader Upton Sinclair to New Deal
reforms in California, Sinclair
obtained the Democratic
nomination for governor in 1934.
Through a popular reaction
against his socialism, Republicans

got into power at a time when
Democrats were sweeping the
country. This backlash lasted for
the next ten years.
Tracing the history of ideas of
reform in California, Bean
emphasized that the current
reform thoughts of Governor
Reagan and others are far from
new.
Reforms 'Cyclical'
"The history of ideas of reform
appears more cyclical than
revolutionary," he stated.
"Reagan's program resembles that
of the reformers of the 1850's,
who were for public order,
decency, and economy."
After one year of government
by the People's (Reform) Party
which came to power in San
Francisco in 1856, the budget was
1/7 the size it was in 1855. Some
of the public schools were closed
and street lighting deteriorated, he
recounted,
"The New Left of the 1960's
was not so new - the SDS was
directly descended from the
Intercollegiate Socialistic Society
founded by Upton Sinclair in
1905," Bean stressed.
History Repeated
Referring to the 1967 rebellion
of the SDS against their parent
league and the current wave of
reactionism, he commented, "The

young militants who did not
know their history were doomed
to repeat it."
Researchers found that the
strongest single emotion in the
1966 California election was
hostility to student
demonstrations.
"Thoreau demanded to be put
in jail - the New Left believed
they could avoid imprisonment or
any other punishment," Bean
said, noting one difference of
modern reformers.
Sense of Frustration
Bean stated that after the first
youthful enthusiasm of the 1960's
came a sense of frustration which
caused a drift toward violence and
vandalism.
"Some found escape in SDS,
some in LSD, many in both," he
said.
Bean noted that Reagan was
merely the political beneficiary of
this reactionism, while many of
hie "new" phrases such as "the
forgotten man" are taken from
writings as old as 1883.
California Environment
Another major speaker of the
conference was Dr. John W.
Caughey, UCLA history professor,
who discussed the Californian and
his environment.
"California history shows man
as ringmaster, putting sub-human
participants through their paces,"
he said. "It is a surprise to most
people now to see that man is a
part of ecology."
Caughey, author of the widely
used high school history
textbook, The Land of the Free,
said that texts must be rewritten
to show the great damage man is
doing to his environment.
Band-aid Efforts
Caughey criticized the Vi
billion dollars allocated to clean
rivers for the next ten years as
part of the "band-aid and aspirin"
efforts. He repeated the necessity
of adopting new valve systems -
stopping to produce pollutants,
cutting down on consumption,
and trimming down not just the
population increase but the
population.
He traced the effect of each set
of California inhabitants on the
environment, praisthe Indians
who were closely in balance with
the ecology although they are
considered primitive.
He noted that the oil
companies' spillage beginning in
the 1920's caused no public anger,
while movie-making came under
huge disapproval.
"Ecologically speaking,
movie-making was one of the
cleanest of industries," Caughey
noted.
Cars Brought Dirt
With the advent of the auto in
the 1920's came a sudden

proliferation of litter, a strain on
the recreation areas such as
Yosemite, and the beginning of air
pollution.
"Neither the scientists nor
Calvin Coolidge told us about it at
the time," Caughey remarked.
The Institute of American
History conducts a summer
program for high school history
teachers as well as conferences.
The last conference was held in
1963 on the Civil War. Papers
from that event were published as
The Crisis ol' the Union; it is
hoped that this year's lectures will
also be published.
Other speakers at this
weekend's conference were
Rodman Paul (Caltech) on
agriculture, Gerald D. Nash (U.
New Mexico) on industrialism,
Don. E. Fehrenbacher (SU) on the
Mexican War, Moses Rishin (SF
State) on migration and
minorities, Earl Pomeroy (U.
Oregon) on the pioneers, Harold
C. Kirker (SCSB) on agriculture,
and Andrew Rolle (Occidental) on
the cultural environment.

part of the "band-aid and aspirin"
efforts. He repeated the necessity
of adopting new valve systems -
stopping to produce pollutants,
cutting down on consumption,
and trimming down not just the
population increase but the
population.
He traced the effect of each set
of California inhabitants on the
environment, praisthe Indians
who were closely in balance with
the ecology although they are
considered primitive.
He noted that the oil
companies' spillage beginning in
the 1920's caused no public anger,
while movie-making came under
huge disapproval.
"Ecologically speaking,
movie-making was one of the
cleanest of industries," Caughey
noted.
Cars Brought Dirt
With the advent of the auto in
the 1920's came a sudden

proliferation of litter, a strain on
the recreation areas such as
Yosemite, and the beginning of air
pollution.
"Neither the scientists nor
Calvin Coolidge told us about it at
the time," Caughey remarked.
The Institute of American
History conducts a summer
program for high school history
teachers as well as conferences.
The last conference was held in
1963 on the Civil War. Papers
from that event were published as
The Crisis ol' the Union; it is
hoped that this year's lectures will
also be published.
Other speakers at this
weekend's conference were
Rodman Paul (Caltech) on
agriculture, Gerald D. Nash (U.
New Mexico) on industrialism,
Don. E. Fehrenbacher (SU) on the
Mexican War, Moses Rishin (SF
State) on migration and
minorities, Earl Pomeroy (U.
Oregon) on the pioneers, Harold
C. Kirker (SCSB) on agriculture,
and Andrew Rolle (Occidental) on
the cultural environment.
Radicalism has done more to
prevent the progress of reform
movements in California than any
other single force, according to
Dr. Walton E. Bean, professor of
history at UC Berkeley.
He was one of the speakers
from nine different universities in
a conference celebrating tow
hundred years of California
history last week-end at Tresidder.
About 200 college and
secondary school teachers came
from all parts of California to hear
lectures on subjects ranging from
the Indians to Governor Reagan
to agriculture.
Stanford's Institute of
American History sponsored the
conference to promote research
and writing on American history
and to bring together scholars and
teachers for their mutual benefit.
Professor George Knoles of
Stanford, director of the Institute,
was chairman of the conference.
Radicalism Harmful
As an example of the harmful
effect of radicalism, Bean cited
the damage done by socialist
leader Upton Sinclair to New Deal
reforms in California, Sinclair
obtained the Democratic
nomination for governor in 1934.
Through a popular reaction
against his socialism, Republicans

got into power at a time when
Democrats were sweeping the
country. This backlash lasted for
the next ten years.
Tracing the history of ideas of
reform in California, Bean
emphasized that the current
reform thoughts of Governor
Reagan and others are far from
new.
Reforms 'Cyclical'
"The history of ideas of reform
appears more cyclical than
revolutionary," he stated.
"Reagan's program resembles that
of the reformers of the 1850's,
who were for public order,
decency, and economy."
After one year of government
by the People's (Reform) Party
which came to power in San
Francisco in 1856, the budget was
1/7 the size it was in 1855. Some
of the public schools were closed
and street lighting deteriorated, he
recounted,
"The New Left of the 1960's
was not so new - the SDS was
directly descended from the
Intercollegiate Socialistic Society
founded by Upton Sinclair in
1905," Bean stressed.
History Repeated
Referring to the 1967 rebellion
of the SDS against their parent
league and the current wave of
reactionism, he commented, "The

young militants who did not
know their history were doomed
to repeat it."
Researchers found that the
strongest single emotion in the
1966 California election was
hostility to student
demonstrations.
"Thoreau demanded to be put
in jail - the New Left believed
they could avoid imprisonment or
any other punishment," Bean
said, noting one difference of
modern reformers.
Sense of Frustration
Bean stated that after the first
youthful enthusiasm of the 1960's
came a sense of frustration which
caused a drift toward violence and
vandalism.
"Some found escape in SDS,
some in LSD, many in both," he
said.
Bean noted that Reagan was
merely the political beneficiary of
this reactionism, while many of
hie "new" phrases such as "the
forgotten man" are taken from
writings as old as 1883.
California Environment
Another major speaker of the
conference was Dr. John W.
Caughey, UCLA history professor,
who discussed the Californian and
his environment.
"California history shows man
as ringmaster, putting sub-human
participants through their paces,"
he said. "It is a surprise to most
people now to see that man is a
part of ecology."
Caughey, author of the widely
used high school history
textbook, The Land of the Free,
said that texts must be rewritten
to show the great damage man is
doing to his environment.
Band-aid Efforts
Caughey criticized the Vi
billion dollars allocated to clean
rivers for the next ten years as
part of the "band-aid and aspirin"
efforts. He repeated the necessity
of adopting new valve systems -

founded by Upton Sinclair in
1905," Bean stressed.
History Repeated
Referring to the 1967 rebellion
of the SDS against their parent
league and the current wave of
reactionism, he commented, "The

young militants who did not
know their history were doomed
to repeat it."
Researchers found that the
strongest single emotion in the
1966 California election was
hostility to student
demonstrations.
"Thoreau demanded to be put
in jail - the New Left believed
they could avoid imprisonment or
any other punishment," Bean
said, noting one difference of
modern reformers.
Sense of Frustration
Bean stated that after the first
youthful enthusiasm of the 1960's
came a sense of frustration which
caused a drift toward violence and
vandalism.
"Some found escape in SDS,
some in LSD, many in both," he
said.
Bean noted that Reagan was
merely the political beneficiary of
this reactionism, while many of
hie "new" phrases such as "the
forgotten man" are taken from
writings as old as 1883.
California Environment
Another major speaker of the
conference was Dr. John W.
Caughey, UCLA history professor,
who discussed the Californian and
his environment.
"California history shows man
as ringmaster, putting sub-human
participants through their paces,"
he said. "It is a surprise to most
people now to see that man is a
part of ecology."
Caughey, author of the widely
used high school history
textbook, The Land of the Free,
said that texts must be rewritten
to show the great damage man is
doing to his environment.
Band-aid Efforts
Caughey criticized the Vi
billion dollars allocated to clean
rivers for the next ten years as
part of the "band-aid and aspirin"
efforts. He repeated the necessity
of adopting new valve systems -
stopping to produce pollutants,
cutting down on consumption,
and trimming down not just the
population increase but the
population.
He traced the effect of each set
of California inhabitants on the
environment, praisthe Indians
who were closely in balance with
the ecology although they are
considered primitive.
He noted that the oil
companies' spillage beginning in
the 1920's caused no public anger,
while movie-making came under
huge disapproval.
"Ecologically speaking,
movie-making was one of the
cleanest of industries," Caughey
noted.
Cars Brought Dirt
With the advent of the auto in
the 1920's came a sudden

proliferation of litter, a strain on
the recreation areas such as
Yosemite, and the beginning of air
pollution.
"Neither the scientists nor
Calvin Coolidge told us about it at
the time," Caughey remarked.
The Institute of American
History conducts a summer
program for high school history
teachers as well as conferences.
The last conference was held in
1963 on the Civil War. Papers
from that event were published as
The Crisis ol' the Union; it is
hoped that this year's lectures will
also be published.
Other speakers at this
weekend's conference were
Rodman Paul (Caltech) on
agriculture, Gerald D. Nash (U.
New Mexico) on industrialism,
Don. E. Fehrenbacher (SU) on the
Mexican War, Moses Rishin (SF
State) on migration and
minorities, Earl Pomeroy (U.
Oregon) on the pioneers, Harold
C. Kirker (SCSB) on agriculture,
and Andrew Rolle (Occidental) on
the cultural environment.
Radicalism has done more to
prevent the progress of reform
movements in California than any
other single force, according to
Dr. Walton E. Bean, professor of
history at UC Berkeley.
He was one of the speakers
from nine different universities in
a conference celebrating tow
hundred years of California
history last week-end at Tresidder.
About 200 college and
secondary school teachers came
from all parts of California to hear
lectures on subjects ranging from
the Indians to Governor Reagan
to agriculture.
Stanford's Institute of
American History sponsored the
conference to promote research
and writing on American history
and to bring together scholars and
teachers for their mutual benefit.
Professor George Knoles of
Stanford, director of the Institute,
was chairman of the conference.
Radicalism Harmful
As an example of the harmful
effect of radicalism, Bean cited
the damage done by socialist
leader Upton Sinclair to New Deal
reforms in California, Sinclair
obtained the Democratic
nomination for governor in 1934.
Through a popular reaction
against his socialism, Republicans

got into power at a time when
Democrats were sweeping the
country. This backlash lasted for
the next ten years.
Tracing the history of ideas of
reform in California, Bean
emphasized that the current
reform thoughts of Governor
Reagan and others are far from
new.
Reforms 'Cyclical'
"The history of ideas of reform
appears more cyclical than
revolutionary," he stated.
"Reagan's program resembles that
of the reformers of the 1850's,
who were for public order,
decency, and economy."
After one year of government
by the People's (Reform) Party
which came to power in San
Francisco in 1856, the budget was
1/7 the size it was in 1855. Some
of the public schools were closed
and street lighting deteriorated, he
recounted,
"The New Left of the 1960's
was not so new - the SDS was
directly descended from the
Intercollegiate Socialistic Society
founded by Upton Sinclair in
1905," Bean stressed.
