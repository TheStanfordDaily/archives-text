# Chinese Now Learn By Imitating Models
## 
### BRUCE McKAY 
Cultural indoctrination in
Communist China is currently
taking the form of a "modeling"
process whereby individuals
compare themselves to "virtuous
models" and "advanced people"
in an organized program,
according to Professor Donald J.
Munro.
Munro outlined the historical
background of "modeling" in
ethics and politics and the more
current "modeling" of
independent thinkers in technical
areas at the Wednesday night
lecture series on "The Concept of
Man in Communist China."
According to Chinese modeling
theories, people learn behavior
from "models," and these models
to be imitated should be readily
available. Government programs
encourage patterning one's
behavior after models, since
learning based on modeling is
more stable than learning induced
by fear.
Munro cited numerous
quotations from Mao as evidence
of the importance attached to
"having something with which to
make a comparison."
The process of developing an
individual into a model was
described. First a person attends
meetings with established figures
and familiarizes himself with
important writings. Then he
writes or delivers a self-criticism
showing how he falls short of the
ideal. The cycle repeats: more
exposure to the ideal, more
self-criticism.
Munro contended that
although the model development
process is essentially
authoritarian, the individual is left
with a feeling of independent
judgement.
Models were described as
"channels from the top to the
mass" and back; but those who
are models do not actually do
much independent thinking
according to Munro. Models are
not paid, but receive respect
commanded by their various
identifying badges which include
banners, special tea mugs, and
lettered T-shirts.
The two classes of model
distinguished by Munro were
designated Virtuous Models and
Advanced People.
The Virtuous Models, mainly
heroes of the Revolution and the
post-Revolutionary period and

certain workers, continue the
Confucian modeling tradition.
From them an individual learns
what his duty is and why it is
important. Their moral and
political behavior is to be directly
imitated.
The second type of modeling,
the following of Advanced People
in technical matters, began in
1949 and accelerated with the
Cultural Revolution. These
models are selected on basis of
labor competitions to be examples
of technical skill and government
support combined. Most are
workers, some are students, a very
few are university teachers.
In spite of the emphasis on
individual thought, models always
point out how the solutions they
have achieved through individual
judgement conform to official
policy.
One area where the emphasis
on individual thought is evident is
education theory. There is now
less emphasis on rote learning and
"magical word blueprint
solutions." There will be less
teacher domination of the
classroom; examinations based on
problem solving will replace
exams stressing memorization;
and there will be more emphasis
on field trips and laboratory
work.

in an organized program,
according to Professor Donald J.
Munro.
Munro outlined the historical
background of "modeling" in
ethics and politics and the more
current "modeling" of
independent thinkers in technical
areas at the Wednesday night
lecture series on "The Concept of
Man in Communist China."
According to Chinese modeling
theories, people learn behavior
from "models," and these models
to be imitated should be readily
available. Government programs
encourage patterning one's
behavior after models, since
learning based on modeling is
more stable than learning induced
by fear.
Munro cited numerous
quotations from Mao as evidence
of the importance attached to
"having something with which to
make a comparison."
The process of developing an
individual into a model was
described. First a person attends
meetings with established figures
and familiarizes himself with
important writings. Then he
writes or delivers a self-criticism
showing how he falls short of the
ideal. The cycle repeats: more
exposure to the ideal, more
self-criticism.
Munro contended that
although the model development
process is essentially
authoritarian, the individual is left
with a feeling of independent
judgement.
Models were described as
"channels from the top to the
mass" and back; but those who
are models do not actually do
much independent thinking
according to Munro. Models are
not paid, but receive respect
commanded by their various
identifying badges which include
banners, special tea mugs, and
lettered T-shirts.
The two classes of model
distinguished by Munro were
designated Virtuous Models and
Advanced People.
The Virtuous Models, mainly
heroes of the Revolution and the
post-Revolutionary period and

certain workers, continue the
Confucian modeling tradition.
From them an individual learns
what his duty is and why it is
important. Their moral and
political behavior is to be directly
imitated.
The second type of modeling,
the following of Advanced People
in technical matters, began in
1949 and accelerated with the
Cultural Revolution. These
models are selected on basis of
labor competitions to be examples
of technical skill and government
support combined. Most are
workers, some are students, a very
few are university teachers.
In spite of the emphasis on
individual thought, models always
point out how the solutions they
have achieved through individual
judgement conform to official
policy.
One area where the emphasis
on individual thought is evident is
education theory. There is now
less emphasis on rote learning and
"magical word blueprint
solutions." There will be less
teacher domination of the
classroom; examinations based on
problem solving will replace
exams stressing memorization;
and there will be more emphasis
on field trips and laboratory
work.
Cultural indoctrination in
Communist China is currently
taking the form of a "modeling"
process whereby individuals
compare themselves to "virtuous
models" and "advanced people"
in an organized program,
according to Professor Donald J.
