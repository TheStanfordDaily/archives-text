# Films On Campus
## Prominent Actors Highlight Fare 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Though top films by Ford,
Renoir and Schlesinger are being
shown, it's an actors' week, with
John Wayne, Bette Davis, Marlon
Brando, Gary Cooper, Julie
Christie and Marcello Mastroianni
appearing on campus screens.
Clive Miller's double bill this
Tuesday is a great one. John
Ford's "Stagecoach" might be
considered the classic western of
all time and should be seen here if
only because it doesn't hold up
well on television. John Wayne
rose to stardom in 1939 with this
picture and Orson Welles
reportedly watched it some 50
times before embarking upon
"Citizen Kane."
"Dark Victory" is basically
pure melodrama but is lifted to
great heights by Bette Davis, who

claims that this is perhaps her
favorite of all her performances.
At the Bette Davis retrospective at
the SF Film Festival this fall, the
film's final scene had the entire
audience in tears. With George
Brent, Geraldine Fitzgerald,
Ronald Reagan and a hilariously
mis-cast Humphrey Bogart.
One of the few double bills
which could top this week's
combo is being shown by Clive
next week on both Tuesday and
Wednesday evenings—Ernest
Lubitsch's famed but seldom-seen
comedy, "To Be or Not To Be,"
with Carole Lombard and Jack
Benny, and Michael Curtiz's
fabulous "Casablance" with
Bogart and Bergman. Don't miss
them.
Showing this Wednesday in
Cubberley at 7:30 and 9:30 is

Jean Renoir's great "Grand
Illusion." Renoir made the film in
1938 in hopes of helping prevent
another armed conflict in Europe.
That he failed is not only tragic in
terms of history but is a sad omen
for all of us today. In the light of
Renoir's very simple but
extraordinarily powerful
statement on the futility of war,
all the demonstrations and
anti-war rhetoric seem like extra
energy needlessly spent. After this
film, there's really nothing more

that should have to be said.
This week's International
Association film should prove to
be a unique viewing experience
for all of us, regardless of political
inclinations. "The East Is Red" is
a propaganda film made by the
Red Chinese in the midst of the
cultural revolution in 1965. The
film presents, in a somewhat
operatic form, the history of
China since 1921 as seen from a
Maoist viewpoint. The color film
has reportedly been seen by 800

million people throughout China,
which would make it, to my
knowledge, the most widely seen
film of all time. In Cubberley on
Thursday at 7:45.
All perspective seems to have
been lost on Marlon Brando's sole
directorial effort, "One-Eyed
Jacks," and recent choppy
showings on the tube have done
nothing to enhance the film's
reputation. It is niether the
disaster many critics claimed it to
be when it opened in 1961, nor is
it the masterpiece some cultists
have called it recently. Some of
the dialogue is clumsy and the
picture is overlong but it is
visually stunning and Brando, as
always, is fascinating to watch. At
Tresidder on Friday.
"High Noon" is, to my mind,
one of the most over-rated films
of all time. Fred Zinneman's
direction is rather academic and
the entire picture was saved from
disaster only by quick editing and
the unique music score which
were added after an unsuccessful
sneak preview. Gary Cooper and
Grace Kelly star and Lee Van
Cleef has a small part. In Bishop
on Friday.
"Darling" is a brittle, brilliant
picture, one of the first and best
of the so-called "swinging
London" films. Julie Christie won
an Oscar for her performance but,
curiously, has only appeared in
three pictures since 1965. Dirk
Bogarde and Laurence Harvey are
also excellent in John
Schlesinger's film, which is
showing Saturday at Tresidder.
"The Tenth Victim" is a fairly
entertaining, stunningly designed
science fiction comedy about a
society in which legal murder
hunts are a popular game.
Marcello Mastroianni and Ursula
Andress star in this 1965 Italian
production, showing at
Cubberley on Saturday at 7:30,
9:15 and 11.


BRF.AKUP—ambitious model Julie Christie doesn't like Dirk Bogards's more
conventional life style in John Schlesinger's "Darling," showing at Tresidder on
Saturday.
