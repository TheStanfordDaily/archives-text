# ROTC Rained Out
## People's Army Ambush Fails 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
By 7 a.m. Saturday all of the
commando units were ready for
the ambush. Nearly 100 People's
Liberation Army soldiers were
clustered in eight small groups
scattered through the thick, wet
underbrush in the muddy foothills
overlooking the campus.
Each of" the cadres had come
prepared to face the enemy:
ROTC cadets on their monthly
buttle maneuvers through the hills
and gullies above Lake Lagunita.
The revolutionary units kept
quiet while stealthy lookouts
clambered up trees, scouted
ahead, or hiked up ridges to watch
for the ROTC busses.
Just before dawn the group
had marched in from a back
entrance to the foothill area to
avoid being spotted by passers-by
or police. Radicals garbed in
ponchos, army jackets, heavy
boots, and faded denim slogged
through the early morning drizzle
to their positions.
Poison Oak Thickets
For two and a half hours the
troops lay hidden in dense poison
oak thickets and chatted quietly
in small groups. Several times
nervous leaders moved their units
closer to the planned combat zone
on the rolling meadows just above
the junction of Junipero Serra
Blvd. and Mayfield Ave.
They rehearsed the plan of
attack over and over again. Each
"affinity group" was to launch its
own attack, doing its best to
disrupt the ROTC exercises with a
hail of balloons, a fusillade of
firecrackers, and war whoops.
Following this skirmish battle,
the groups would unite for the
final "Dienbienphu stage."
Commented one radical, "If we
get close enough, we hope to talk
to them and pass out leaflets, but
the chances for this aren't too
good. Would you really want to
discuss anything after someone
poured paint on you?"
But by 9:30 guerilla leaders
sensed something amiss. The
cadets, expected at 8:30, had not
yet arrived, and the rebel host
grew restless. Occasional
firecrackers sputtered along the
lines and discipline proved so lax
that loud conversations and
snatches of song revealed the
staging areas of the "Eighth Route

Army" (one of Mao's most
famous units), "Concerned
Stalinists," and "Marcuse
Liberation Front."
Little Action Stirring
Soon word reached the leaders
from informants stationed near
ROTC headquarters that no
busses were coming and little
action was stirring near the
armory.
Messengers circulated the word
to retreat back into the hills for a
mass rally. By this time nearly all
realized that ROTC had failed to
show up and that the battle was
off.
One platoon began unloading
balloons with a giant slingshot
built from a dogdish and rubber
tubing. When one of the rubber
sections snapped, a muddy radical
sighed, "The people's technology
is not as strong as the people's
spirit."
At the top of a hill near the
huge radio dish, the armv all

gathered under a halt dozen red,
black, and NLF flags. The units
greeted each other, laughed,
lighted firecrackers, and threw the
now suddenly useful balloons at
one another.
Cancelled Drill
One radical assessed the
morning's accomplishments.
"We were successful in
achieving our purpose. The threat
of disruption made them cancel
the drill. We also learned a lot
about getting together for more
actions," he shouted. His speech
ended abruptly as a string of
firecrackers went off in the
concrete culvert he stood on. The
group then broke up and trekked
back to their cars.
Captain Thomas Casey of the
ROTC program yesterday said
"Since it was raining, we went on
our inclement weather schedule
which we normally do when it
rains." ROTC classes remained
indoors with sophomores and

juniors watching a Pentagon
movie on the Russian army and
freshmen practicing on the rifle
range.
About 35 junior cadets were
originally scheduled to practice
combat patrol techniques,
described by Casey as a "fairly
important drill."
Ramey's Warn inn
When told about the radicals
planned attack, he commented, "I
kind of had an idea they were
going to do something." But he
added the threat of a
demonstration would not have
changed his plans. "It would have
made it more real though," he
said.
Col Stanley Ramey, director
of the Army ROTC program, said
that if protestors tried to disrupt
any ROTC exercises, he would
notify both them and campus
officials that the demonstrators
were in violation of University
policies,forbidding disruption.

Saturday after learning that Army ROTC had "cancelled" its scheduled battle drill. About 100 radicals, from Stanford and
nearby high schools, had planned an ambush. Today they have announced they will give a "revolutionary greeting" to the
Academic Council.
