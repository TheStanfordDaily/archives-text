# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Ballet Alters Pace 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
The San Francisco Symphony
presented a change of pace
Wednesday evening including Erik
Satie's satirical ballet score Parade
in the program.
Although modern works
consistently highlight Seiji
Ozawa's scheduling, seldom are
pieces which were written for fun
alone included in any concert
program. And when they are, the
concert setting often blinds
critics, audience and musicians to
the pure humor of the piece.
Fortunately, although Parade was
tucked away between a romantic
Faure and a forceful
Rachmaninoff, it was understood
by all that this was a light-hearted
work.
Satie was fond of playing
"musical practical jokes" on his
patrons and audiences whenever
he could, and the invitation to
compose ballet music to Cocteau's
choreography and Picasso's sets
revealed just such an opportunity.
Satie wrote a score of solid
contemporary music in a carnival
vein, interspersing it with
comments from a number of
ingenious percussion instruments
— a roulette wheel, two starter's
pistols, a siren, three typewriters
(played by real secretaries) and a
wash tub full of water (sensuously
poured by Tony Cirone).
The members of the orchestra
probably considered Parade a bit
of fluff, but the audience enjoyed
it immensely. And I think Mr.
Cirone did, also.
Serious Works Included
Wednesday's concert was not
simply frivolous. The program
opened with Haydn's "Symphony
No. 86", a composition from
Haydn's mature years, when
Mozart was becoming increasingly
respected. When this symphony
was written in 1786, Haydn was
54, Mozart thirty. It has been
suggested that Haydn felt plain,
old-fashioned jealousy towards
the younger man, and began to do
some symphonic experimentation
in order to recapture some of his
ebbing prestige.
In this work, Haydn included a
melange of musical forms, a more
open structure, and less rigid
progressions than in his earlier
works. All this was translated by
the Symphony under Maestro
Czawa into a sonorous
cooperation of sections which has
been lacking in some concerts,
and was enhanced by a splendid
woodwind choir in the Menuet.
Pianist Acclaimed
The final piece on the program
was Rachmaninoff's powerful
"Piano Concerto No. 3," which
stands in jagged contrast to that
composer's mellifluous "Piano
Concerto No. 2." Vladimir
Ashkenazy, the gifted young man
from Reykjavik was the featured
soloist.
This gave San Francisco
audiences a chance to compare
three young, highly-touted
concert pianists, who have all
appeared with the symphony
within the last six weeks: Mischa
Dichter, Daniel Barenboim, and
Ashkenazy. Ashkenazy's
confident, forceful performance
clearly won the audience, which
responded at the final chord with
an immediate and spontaneous
standing ovation.
His sharp, biting attacks in the
cadenzas gave way to flowing
arabesques in the coda sections,

always maintaining the
concertante, the musical
opposition, to the orchestra. A
mature musician at 32, Ashkenazy
is by far the best pianist to have
performed with the Symphony
this year.

Richter, scheduled to perform in
recital March 7 and March 8 at the
Masonic Auditorium, is ill and has
been forced to cancel his entire
U.S. tour.
Kornfeld has signed John
Browning, who was to perform on
next year's S.F. Piano Series, to
take Richter's place this year.
Tickets already purchased for the

THE UNKNOWN SOLDIERS, played by Dennis Kerwin, says goodbye to his
wife, <.ail Hoffman, before he goes off to battle in The Unknown Soldier and
His Wife, Peter Ustinov's anti-war satire, which is the next SRT production.
The San Francisco Symphony
presented a change of pace
Wednesday evening including Erik
Satie's satirical ballet score Parade
in the program.
Although modern works
consistently highlight Seiji
Ozawa's scheduling, seldom are
pieces which were written for fun
alone included in any concert
program. And when they are, the
concert setting often blinds
critics, audience and musicians to
the pure humor of the piece.
Fortunately, although Parade was
tucked away between a romantic
Faure and a forceful
Rachmaninoff, it was understood
by all that this was a light-hearted
work.
Satie was fond of playing
"musical practical jokes" on his
patrons and audiences whenever
he could, and the invitation to
compose ballet music to Cocteau's
choreography and Picasso's sets
revealed just such an opportunity.
Satie wrote a score of solid
contemporary music in a carnival
vein, interspersing it with
comments from a number of
ingenious percussion instruments
— a roulette wheel, two starter's
pistols, a siren, three typewriters
(played by real secretaries) and a
wash tub full of water (sensuously
poured by Tony Cirone).
The members of the orchestra
probably considered Parade a bit
of fluff, but the audience enjoyed
it immensely. And I think Mr.
Cirone did, also.
Serious Works Included
Wednesday's concert was not
simply frivolous. The program
opened with Haydn's "Symphony
No. 86", a composition from
Haydn's mature years, when
Mozart was becoming increasingly
respected. When this symphony
was written in 1786, Haydn was
54, Mozart thirty. It has been
suggested that Haydn felt plain,
old-fashioned jealousy towards
the younger man, and began to do
some symphonic experimentation
in order to recapture some of his
ebbing prestige.
In this work, Haydn included a
melange of musical forms, a more
open structure, and less rigid
progressions than in his earlier
works. All this was translated by
the Symphony under Maestro
Czawa into a sonorous
cooperation of sections which has
been lacking in some concerts,
and was enhanced by a splendid
woodwind choir in the Menuet.
Pianist Acclaimed
The final piece on the program
was Rachmaninoff's powerful
"Piano Concerto No. 3," which
stands in jagged contrast to that
composer's mellifluous "Piano
Concerto No. 2." Vladimir
Ashkenazy, the gifted young man
from Reykjavik was the featured
soloist.
This gave San Francisco
audiences a chance to compare
three young, highly-touted
concert pianists, who have all
appeared with the symphony
within the last six weeks: Mischa
Dichter, Daniel Barenboim, and
Ashkenazy. Ashkenazy's
confident, forceful performance
clearly won the audience, which
responded at the final chord with
an immediate and spontaneous
standing ovation.
His sharp, biting attacks in the
cadenzas gave way to flowing
arabesques in the coda sections,

always maintaining the
concertante, the musical
opposition, to the orchestra. A
mature musician at 32, Ashkenazy
is by far the best pianist to have
performed with the Symphony
this year.
