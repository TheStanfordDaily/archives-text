# The 						Unknown Soldier Comes To Life Soon
## 
### 
"The Unknown Soldier and His
Wife," a comic, anti-war satire by
Peter Ustinov, will be presented
by Stanford Repertory Theater, at
8 p.m. March 4-7 and 10-14 and
at 2 p.m. March 7, in the Little
Theater.
In the play, The Tomb of The
Unknown Soldier is about to be
dedicated. Suddenly a strange,
pregnant girl appears and claims
to be the wife of the soldier.
The Unknown Soldier, played
by Dennis Kerwin, dies in all wars
through the centuries, each time
leaving his wife pregnant, only to
meet her again 100 years later in
some new conflict.
Each character develops a role
in society. The pompous Roman
general played by James Kason,
becomes a medieval count and
later an Eighteenth Century
prince.
Reappearing Characters
The enemy leader, Richard
Carp, reappears each time as a
new foe. His daughter, Bridget
Ross, may be anything from an
Arab maiden to a society matron.
Robin Lake appears as the
doughty archbishop, who is also a
Roman high priest and then a
Calvinist preacher. Even the
Rebel, played by Marcel
Hernandez, creates a new
establishment as he revolts against
the old one.
Only the Unknown Soldier can
break the pattern of death by
refusing to die. At the end of the
play he leads his comrades in a
triumphal procession toward life.
The Farce of War
Preposterous stage effects and
exaggerated, circus like costumes
suggest a Commedia dell'Arte
farce, with the actors handing
around each new part as it comes
along. "But, even as they are
laughing at the play," says
director Joseph Brockett, "the
audience becomes gradually aware
of the hopeless stupidity of war."
The set, designed by K. Clarke
Crandell, reinforces the fantasy
element of the script. A series of
rigid squares overlap and serve as a
background for various scenic
effects created by slide
projections and dramatic lighting.
At the end of the play, life
replaces death, and the hard

squares become softer more
organic shapes.
Joseph Brockett, lecturer in
acting at Stanford, acted in the
New York Shakespeare Festival.
He played Marat in the American
premiere of "Marat Sade" as well
as more than 200 other roles over
18 years. Other plays he has

Midpeninsula, as well as in New
York. Last spring he played the
sly Justice Squeezum in Ram's
Head's production of "Lock Up
Your Daughters." More recently
he appeared as Harry Clay in
"Money" at Rudolfo's.
Howard Brown, the
suspiciously German sounding
inventor who produces a new
weapon for each war, directed the
Stanford Repertory Theater
production of "The Iceman
Cometh." He also wrote and
directed "Mourning Hercules" last
spring. Robin Lake was artistic
director of La Troupe Moliere in
Vancouver, B.C. and has directed
various plays at Stanford,
including "Christmas In The
Marketplace," as part of the SRT

Kerwin Plays Soldier
Dennis Kerwin, the Unknown
Soldier, is a senior in speech and
drama. He played in Moliere's
"Learned Ladies," last year, and
was first narrator for the Water
production of "Ajax 1969." Gail
Hoffman, the wife, is a first year
MFA student in acting. She
played Lulu in "The Birthday
Party."
Gene Engene plays the
cockney sergeant, and John Allen,
John Bennett, Steve Cramolini,
and Mike Robertson are soldiers
who have numbers instead of
names.
Tickets are available at
Memorial Hall Box Office and all
Ticketron agencies.
"The Unknown Soldier and His
Wife," a comic, anti-war satire by
Peter Ustinov, will be presented
by Stanford Repertory Theater, at
8 p.m. March 4-7 and 10-14 and
at 2 p.m. March 7, in the Little
Theater.
In the play, The Tomb of The
Unknown Soldier is about to be
dedicated. Suddenly a strange,
pregnant girl appears and claims
to be the wife of the soldier.
The Unknown Soldier, played
by Dennis Kerwin, dies in all wars
through the centuries, each time
leaving his wife pregnant, only to
meet her again 100 years later in
some new conflict.
Each character develops a role
in society. The pompous Roman
general played by James Kason,
becomes a medieval count and
later an Eighteenth Century
prince.
Reappearing Characters
The enemy leader, Richard
Carp, reappears each time as a
new foe. His daughter, Bridget
Ross, may be anything from an
Arab maiden to a society matron.
Robin Lake appears as the
doughty archbishop, who is also a
Roman high priest and then a
Calvinist preacher. Even the
Rebel, played by Marcel
Hernandez, creates a new
establishment as he revolts against
the old one.
Only the Unknown Soldier can
break the pattern of death by
refusing to die. At the end of the
play he leads his comrades in a
triumphal procession toward life.
The Farce of War
Preposterous stage effects and
exaggerated, circus like costumes
suggest a Commedia dell'Arte
farce, with the actors handing
around each new part as it comes
along. "But, even as they are
laughing at the play," says
director Joseph Brockett, "the
audience becomes gradually aware
of the hopeless stupidity of war."
The set, designed by K. Clarke
Crandell, reinforces the fantasy
element of the script. A series of
rigid squares overlap and serve as a
background for various scenic
effects created by slide
projections and dramatic lighting.
At the end of the play, life
replaces death, and the hard

squares become softer more
organic shapes.
Joseph Brockett, lecturer in
acting at Stanford, acted in the
New York Shakespeare Festival.
He played Marat in the American
premiere of "Marat Sade" as well
as more than 200 other roles over
18 years. Other plays he has
