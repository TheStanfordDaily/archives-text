## Bad Trip For Tribe 
### 
At some time around 4:30
next Saturday, Stanford will
finish its 1969-70 varsity
basketball season. Even if the
Tribe upsets Cal once again, the
locals will end up with the fewest
number of wins since 1946, when
they were 6-18.
And if the Indians lose, it will
be the worst record since the 2-9
team of 1916. Last weekend
Stanford lost any hope of
avoiding these dubious
distinctions by dropping a pair of
games in Los Angeles, 120-90 to
UCLA and 85-71 to USC. The
losses left the Cards with a 5-17
overall record and a 2-11 league
mark.
Friday night the Tribe was
bothered early by UCLA's

alternating full-court zone and
half court man-to-man press
which led to numerous ball
control errors. And while the
Indians were hitting only 28%,
four of the Bruins starters went
21 for 30 to give UCLA a
comfortable 56-39 halftime edge.
Bruin Loss No Fluke
Stanford was outmanned and
never really in the game as the
Bruins went full out to prove last
weekend's loss to Oregon was
only a fluke. Curtis Rowe led
them with 30, followed by Sid
Wicks' 23 and John Vallely's 22.
Claude Terry scored 22 and
Dennis O'Neill added 17 to pace
the hapless Cards.
Saturday night, USC's 6-8
sophomore center Ron Riley had

a season high of 20 points to lead
the Trojans to their 85-71 win.
Riley led a powerful team
offensive board effort to greatly
aid the Trojans. Stanford's outside
shooters were bothered by USC's
tough zone defense and they
could never bring the Indians
closer than eight in the second
half.
As usual, the only real bright
spot for the Cards were the
guards, Terry and O'Neill who
picked up 22 and 13 points,
respectively.
Frosh Lose, Too
To further add to Stanford's
basketball woes, the usually
victorious Frosh lost their third
game of the season, 79-76 to the
San Jose State frosh Saturday. It
was a close game most of the way
as the lead exchanged hands a
couple of times in the second half.
The Papooses were paced by Mike
Boryla's season high of 26 points.
Next weekend, the little Indians,
now 12-3 also close out their
season, against the Cal frosh.
