# Dunning and Keller Key Card Triumph
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
It was a long, hard-hit shot, but
you couldn't tell whether it was
going to go out until it began to
rise over centerfield.
"I knew I hit it well ... It was
a high fast ball at the letters,"
Steve Dunning was saying later,
"But when it took off I thought it
was going to be too high."
It wasn't.
Dunning was talking about a
pitch he'd hit in the fourth inning
of Friday's Santa Clara-Stanford
game at Sunken Diamond. The
ball, served up by pitcher Rich
Troedson, didn't stop moving
until it had come to rest on the
far side of the centerfield fence,
more than 400 feet away from the
plate.
The home run, coming with
two out, gave the Tribe a 1-0 lead.
It was going to be all that was
needed.
Phil Keller, an exceptionally
talented senior who deserves the
cliches like "intense competitor"
listed under his name in the press
book, had lost a 1-0 decision in
ten innings last week, and was not
about to be beaten today.
Keller Hands Out K's
Protecting the slim lead like
Mom protects the kids, Keller
blanked the opposition for the
rest of the way to get the win, not
to mention 12 strikeouts. And for
the first time since April, 1968,
the Indians had tamed the
Broncos.
On Saturday the Tribe spent all
morning and part of the afternoon
in a bus between here and Fresno.
Only after arriving in the valley
town did the Indians learn that
their doubleheader with Fresno
State had been rained out.
Saturday always was a good
day to go for a ride . . .
Friday's game, however, was a
beautifully executed duel between
two splendid teams and two damn
good pitchers. Lefthander

Troedson is only a sophomore,
but he showed the Indians why he
has a starting berth nailed down.
Stanford collected only four
hits off the Bronco ace, two by
Dunning (he dragged a bunt single
in the seventh but was thrown out
stealing) and two by left-fielder
Bob Marshall.
But if Troedson was good,
Keller was great. The senior gave
up but three hits, and was in
trouble only in the sixth when an
error, a wild pitch and a walk put
runners on first and third with
two out. But Keller got second
baseman Chuck PVanklin swinging
to end the inning.
Nevertheless, the ninth inning
was exciting. Bronco centerfielder
Jim Silvestrini led off with a walk,
bringing up first baseman Bill
Borelli. Borelli leaned into a low
slider and sent it screaming
towards the centerfield fence as
more than a few Indian fans began
to lose weight.
The View From Center
But Curt Fant saw it
differently. "After I went back I
saw it wasn't going to go
out ... It was just a high fungo,
that's all."
Sure. Only thing was, if Borelli
had hit it the same inning
Dunning hit his, when the wind
wasn't blowing in quite so
strongly, things might have been
different.
As it was, Keller, who said iater
that "I was throwing harder today
than last Saturday," lowered his
earned run average to 0.69 en
route to the 1-0 win, his first. And
in the hitting department,
Dunning's bunt single and second
homer of thy year lifted his
average to .310. Marshall skied to
.357 and the hot bat of Fant came
out of an 0-4 freezer at the .400
mark.
Stanford hosts University of
the Pacific at 3 p.m. Tuesday,
then takes on the Broncos again,
down there at 3 p.m. Wednesday.
