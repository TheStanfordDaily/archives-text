# Marks Tumble On New Track
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Under cloudy and eventually
rainy skies Saturday, Stanford's
varsity track team opened its
1970 dual meet season with an
87-67 loss to defending NCAA
champion San Jose State.
In the first meet held on
Stanford Stadium's new $40,000
all-weather track, two meet
records were established. Spartan
George Carty set one in the 120
yard high hurdles in 13.9, and
Stanford's Greg Brock set a new
school, meet and stadium record
when he ran the two-mile in an
outstanding 8:45.2.
Any hopes of a Stanford upset
were severely hurt before the
meet began when defending Pac-8
120 yard high hurdle champ Rick
Tipton was ruled out of the meet
with a pulled leg muscle sustained
Thursday. The absence of Tipton
from tbe hurdles, sprints and
relays, added to the loss of 440
man Jim Kauffman—who played
in the rugby game—gave Stanford
quite a handicap from the
beginning, especially in the relays.
But despite this, the Tribe
made a fine showing in the field
events and ended up closer than
most people had expected. The
Indians came up with two early
upsets as unheralded freshman A 1
Dyson won the long jump with a
leap of 23-3% and team captain
T.C. Jones won the shot put with
a toss of 57-5. Dyson made an
outstanding debut in an Indian
uniform as he also finished second
in the 100 (9.9) and third in the
220 (21.6).
Stanford also won the discus
on Steve Davis' throw of 162-6;
the triple jump on Allen
Meredith's 48 ft. % in. leap, and
the high jump on Dave Harper's
6-6 jump. But the biggest
disappointment of the day came
when Stanford's freshman
Olympian Casey Carrigan fell far
short of his best of 17-4 3 /4 with a
vault of 15 ft, good only for third
place behind the Spartan's Sam
Caruthers and Bob Slover, both of
whom went 15-6.
In the opening running event,
San Jose State's Darold Dent held
off Brook Thomas to win the
3000 meter steeplechase in
9:06.8. Following the

steeplechase, Stanford, minus
Tipton, gave SJS a good run in the
440 relay before falling with a
time of 42.2 to the Spartan's
41.8. Duncan Mac Donald and
Decker Underwood then came
back to give the Indians a one-two
finish in the mile with times of
4:08.6 and 4:10.2. But the
Spartans won the next six running
events to put the meet out of
reach.
In the 120 highs, the Tribe's
Bill Griffith ran a lifetime best of
14.3 to finish second behind
Carty. Elmo Dees won the 440 in
47.3 and the world record holder
in the 50 yard dash, Kirk Clayton,
won the hundred in 9.6. The
Indians' Dyson beat out Olympian
Ronnie Ray Smith for second
place.
Neville Myton, an SJS student
from Jamaica, took the 880 in
1:51 while Gerald Dolphin won
the 440 Intermediate Hurdles in
52.8. Dolphin beat last year's
third place finisher in the Pac-8,
Randy White, who led in the early
going until he appeared to get
sick, and was forced to slow up
and nearly walk across the finish
line. Clayton took a double by
winning the 220 in 21.3.
In the most exciting event of
the day, Brock and teammate Don
Kardong ran an unbelievably fast
two mile as both finished in what
appeared to be a dead heat. Brock
was ruled the winner but both
were given the same 8:45.2
timing. The time beat Brock's
own previous school record time
of 8:49.8. Kardong's previous best
had been a 9:05.0. In the final
event of the day, SJS won the
mile relay with a clocking of
3:15.5 to Stanford's 3:21.4.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
was pleased with the overall
performance of his team. "I
particularly liked the competitive
spirit they displayed. Although we
weren't figured to come close to
San Jose, we did make it
interesting," he said. When Tipton
and Kauffman return to the track,
it is obvious Stanford will have a
good overall squad. The
performances of newcomers such
as Dyson, Meredith and
Underwood give hopes for strong
teams in the near future.

time of 42.2 to the Spartan's
41.8. Duncan Mac Donald and
Decker Underwood then came
back to give the Indians a one-two
finish in the mile with times of
4:08.6 and 4:10.2. But the
Spartans won the next six running
events to put the meet out of
reach.
In the 120 highs, the Tribe's
Bill Griffith ran a lifetime best of
14.3 to finish second behind
Carty. Elmo Dees won the 440 in
47.3 and the world record holder
in the 50 yard dash, Kirk Clayton,
won the hundred in 9.6. The
Indians' Dyson beat out Olympian
Ronnie Ray Smith for second
place.
Neville Myton, an SJS student
from Jamaica, took the 880 in
1:51 while Gerald Dolphin won
the 440 Intermediate Hurdles in
52.8. Dolphin beat last year's
third place finisher in the Pac-8,
Randy White, who led in the early
going until he appeared to get
sick, and was forced to slow up
and nearly walk across the finish
line. Clayton took a double by
winning the 220 in 21.3.
In the most exciting event of
the day, Brock and teammate Don
Kardong ran an unbelievably fast
two mile as both finished in what
appeared to be a dead heat. Brock
was ruled the winner but both
were given the same 8:45.2
timing. The time beat Brock's
own previous school record time
of 8:49.8. Kardong's previous best
had been a 9:05.0. In the final
event of the day, SJS won the
mile relay with a clocking of
3:15.5 to Stanford's 3:21.4.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
was pleased with the overall
performance of his team. "I
particularly liked the competitive
spirit they displayed. Although we
weren't figured to come close to
San Jose, we did make it
interesting," he said. When Tipton
and Kauffman return to the track,
it is obvious Stanford will have a
good overall squad. The
performances of newcomers such
as Dyson, Meredith and
Underwood give hopes for strong
teams in the near future.
Under cloudy and eventually
rainy skies Saturday, Stanford's
varsity track team opened its
1970 dual meet season with an
87-67 loss to defending NCAA
champion San Jose State.
In the first meet held on
Stanford Stadium's new $40,000
all-weather track, two meet
records were established. Spartan
George Carty set one in the 120
yard high hurdles in 13.9, and
Stanford's Greg Brock set a new
school, meet and stadium record
when he ran the two-mile in an
outstanding 8:45.2.
Any hopes of a Stanford upset
were severely hurt before the
meet began when defending Pac-8
120 yard high hurdle champ Rick
Tipton was ruled out of the meet
with a pulled leg muscle sustained
Thursday. The absence of Tipton
from tbe hurdles, sprints and
relays, added to the loss of 440
man Jim Kauffman—who played
in the rugby game—gave Stanford
quite a handicap from the
beginning, especially in the relays.
But despite this, the Tribe
made a fine showing in the field
events and ended up closer than
most people had expected. The
Indians came up with two early
upsets as unheralded freshman A 1
Dyson won the long jump with a
leap of 23-3% and team captain
T.C. Jones won the shot put with
a toss of 57-5. Dyson made an
outstanding debut in an Indian
uniform as he also finished second
in the 100 (9.9) and third in the
220 (21.6).
Stanford also won the discus
on Steve Davis' throw of 162-6;
the triple jump on Allen
Meredith's 48 ft. % in. leap, and
the high jump on Dave Harper's
6-6 jump. But the biggest
disappointment of the day came
when Stanford's freshman
Olympian Casey Carrigan fell far
short of his best of 17-4 3 /4 with a
vault of 15 ft, good only for third
place behind the Spartan's Sam
Caruthers and Bob Slover, both of
whom went 15-6.
In the opening running event,
San Jose State's Darold Dent held
off Brook Thomas to win the
3000 meter steeplechase in
9:06.8. Following the

steeplechase, Stanford, minus
Tipton, gave SJS a good run in the
440 relay before falling with a
time of 42.2 to the Spartan's
41.8. Duncan Mac Donald and
Decker Underwood then came

champion San Jose State.
In the first meet held on
Stanford Stadium's new $40,000
all-weather track, two meet
records were established. Spartan
George Carty set one in the 120
yard high hurdles in 13.9, and
Stanford's Greg Brock set a new
school, meet and stadium record
when he ran the two-mile in an
outstanding 8:45.2.
Any hopes of a Stanford upset
were severely hurt before the
meet began when defending Pac-8
120 yard high hurdle champ Rick
Tipton was ruled out of the meet
with a pulled leg muscle sustained
Thursday. The absence of Tipton
from tbe hurdles, sprints and
relays, added to the loss of 440
man Jim Kauffman—who played
in the rugby game—gave Stanford
quite a handicap from the
beginning, especially in the relays.
But despite this, the Tribe
made a fine showing in the field
events and ended up closer than
most people had expected. The
Indians came up with two early
upsets as unheralded freshman A 1
Dyson won the long jump with a
leap of 23-3% and team captain
T.C. Jones won the shot put with
a toss of 57-5. Dyson made an
outstanding debut in an Indian
uniform as he also finished second
in the 100 (9.9) and third in the
220 (21.6).
Stanford also won the discus
on Steve Davis' throw of 162-6;
the triple jump on Allen
Meredith's 48 ft. % in. leap, and
the high jump on Dave Harper's
6-6 jump. But the biggest
disappointment of the day came
when Stanford's freshman
Olympian Casey Carrigan fell far
short of his best of 17-4 3 /4 with a
vault of 15 ft, good only for third
place behind the Spartan's Sam
Caruthers and Bob Slover, both of
whom went 15-6.
In the opening running event,
San Jose State's Darold Dent held
off Brook Thomas to win the
3000 meter steeplechase in
9:06.8. Following the

steeplechase, Stanford, minus
Tipton, gave SJS a good run in the
440 relay before falling with a
time of 42.2 to the Spartan's
41.8. Duncan Mac Donald and
Decker Underwood then came
back to give the Indians a one-two
finish in the mile with times of
4:08.6 and 4:10.2. But the
Spartans won the next six running
events to put the meet out of
reach.
In the 120 highs, the Tribe's
Bill Griffith ran a lifetime best of
14.3 to finish second behind
Carty. Elmo Dees won the 440 in
47.3 and the world record holder
in the 50 yard dash, Kirk Clayton,
won the hundred in 9.6. The
Indians' Dyson beat out Olympian
Ronnie Ray Smith for second
place.
Neville Myton, an SJS student
from Jamaica, took the 880 in
1:51 while Gerald Dolphin won
the 440 Intermediate Hurdles in
52.8. Dolphin beat last year's
third place finisher in the Pac-8,
Randy White, who led in the early
going until he appeared to get
sick, and was forced to slow up
and nearly walk across the finish
line. Clayton took a double by
winning the 220 in 21.3.
In the most exciting event of
the day, Brock and teammate Don
Kardong ran an unbelievably fast
two mile as both finished in what
appeared to be a dead heat. Brock
was ruled the winner but both
were given the same 8:45.2
timing. The time beat Brock's
own previous school record time
of 8:49.8. Kardong's previous best
had been a 9:05.0. In the final
event of the day, SJS won the
mile relay with a clocking of
3:15.5 to Stanford's 3:21.4.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
was pleased with the overall
performance of his team. "I
particularly liked the competitive
spirit they displayed. Although we
weren't figured to come close to
San Jose, we did make it
interesting," he said. When Tipton
and Kauffman return to the track,
it is obvious Stanford will have a
good overall squad. The
performances of newcomers such
as Dyson, Meredith and
Underwood give hopes for strong
teams in the near future.
