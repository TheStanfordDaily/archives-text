# Rochell Rules Rings
## Gymnasts Reach New High 
### FRED LEESON 
With Steve Rochell hitting his
season best in two events and
providing the evening's highlight
on the rings, Stanford gymnasts
closed their home schedule
Saturday night with their best
score yet.
The Indians, who improved
their team total in each meet this
season—with one exception
compiled a 140.3 mark before a
crowd of 600 at Encina Pavilion,
topping their previous high of
137.75 set'last week.
USC paced the three-team
performance with a 150.95 score,
followed by Oregon at 145.25.
Rochell earned the night's

highest individual rating and one
of the largest ovations for his
magnificent 9.25 performance on
the rings, outdoing his previous
best of 9.1 scored last week.
An inverted iron cross was the
most spectacular addition to his
routine.
The Illinois junior also put
together his best show of the
season on the parallel bars, tying
teammate Rich Jerome for third
place in that event with a 8.65
mark.
Jerome scored eight or above
in five of the six events to finish
second in the all-around at 47.7,
behind SC's Randy Martin who
totalled 51.8.

Aside from his 8.65 on the
parallel bars, Jerome's other high
scores were 8.6 in both free
exercise and vaulting, and 8.45 on
the high bar.
Martin, one of the better
all-around performers in the
Pac-8, registered his best scores on
parallel bars and free exercise. He
featured a running, springboard
mount to the parallel bars on his
way to a 9.15 there, and scored
8.95 with a floor show
demonstrating unusual velocity
and height.
The Indians, with their dual
competition completed, aim next
at the Pac-8 championships March
26-28 in Seattle. California and
Washington are the favorites.
But Stanford prospects are
excellent for next year, and Coach
Dan Millman is confident that
scores will be higher and crowds
even bigger.
With good reason.
Seven of his eight gymnasts all
return, the only current senior
being side-horse specialist Dennis
Mesick. Chris Harrold, Jerome,
Murray Kephart and Ted
Miyamoto are all freshmen; Brian
Morgan is a sophomore; and
Rochell, who figures to finish high
in the NCAA finals if he maintains
his present form, and Bob
Tomlinson both have another
year.


NORCAL CHAMP—Freshman Roscoe Tanner, above, won the NorCal singles
tennis title yeslerday in Berkeley as Stanford won the team championship with ill
points, highest ever scored b> one team. Tanner teamed with Huh Rittner, who
was runnerup in singles, to win doubles competition. The Indians face top-ranked
competition this week with home matches against San Jose State, Michigan and
Utah on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, respectively.

NORCAL CHAMP—Freshman Roscoe Tanner, above, won the NorCal singles
tennis title yeslerday in Berkeley as Stanford won the team championship with ill
points, highest ever scored b> one team. Tanner teamed with Huh Rittner, who
was runnerup in singles, to win doubles competition. The Indians face top-ranked
competition this week with home matches against San Jose State, Michigan and
Utah on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, respectively.
With Steve Rochell hitting his
season best in two events and
providing the evening's highlight
on the rings, Stanford gymnasts
closed their home schedule
Saturday night with their best
score yet.
The Indians, who improved
their team total in each meet this
season—with one exception
compiled a 140.3 mark before a
crowd of 600 at Encina Pavilion,
topping their previous high of
137.75 set'last week.
USC paced the three-team
performance with a 150.95 score,
followed by Oregon at 145.25.
Rochell earned the night's

highest individual rating and one
of the largest ovations for his
magnificent 9.25 performance on
the rings, outdoing his previous
best of 9.1 scored last week.
An inverted iron cross was the
most spectacular addition to his
routine.
The Illinois junior also put
together his best show of the
season on the parallel bars, tying
teammate Rich Jerome for third
place in that event with a 8.65
mark.
Jerome scored eight or above
in five of the six events to finish
second in the all-around at 47.7,
behind SC's Randy Martin who
totalled 51.8.

Aside from his 8.65 on the
parallel bars, Jerome's other high
scores were 8.6 in both free
exercise and vaulting, and 8.45 on
the high bar.
Martin, one of the better
all-around performers in the
Pac-8, registered his best scores on
parallel bars and free exercise. He
featured a running, springboard
mount to the parallel bars on his
way to a 9.15 there, and scored
8.95 with a floor show
demonstrating unusual velocity
and height.
The Indians, with their dual
competition completed, aim next
at the Pac-8 championships March
26-28 in Seattle. California and
Washington are the favorites.
But Stanford prospects are
excellent for next year, and Coach
Dan Millman is confident that
scores will be higher and crowds
even bigger.
With good reason.
Seven of his eight gymnasts all
return, the only current senior
being side-horse specialist Dennis
Mesick. Chris Harrold, Jerome,
Murray Kephart and Ted
Miyamoto are all freshmen; Brian
Morgan is a sophomore; and
Rochell, who figures to finish high
in the NCAA finals if he maintains
his present form, and Bob
Tomlinson both have another
