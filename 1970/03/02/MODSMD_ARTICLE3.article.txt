# History Of Frustration
## Isla Vista Is 'Youth Ghetto' 
### LENNY SIEGEL 
Isla Vista is an unincorporated
residential community ten miles
outside Santa Barbara. Adjacent
to the campus of the University of
California at Santa Barbara, Isla
Vista houses perhaps 13,000
young people—B,ooo of them
UCSB students and the rest city
college students, working youth,

and drop-outs. Isla Vista is a
Youth Ghetto.
The frustrations and
antagonisms which exploded into
three nights of rioting last week
have been long building.
Powerlessness, high rents and poor
housing conditions, alleged police
harassment, pollution, the War,
and the Chicago trial, according to

students sources, all contributed
to the uprising.
On Jan. 28 students led a sit-in
at local oil docks to protest
continuing drilling by Union Oil
and other companies in the Santa
Barbara channel. Soon afterward,
for a solid week, over 3,000
students—involving, at different
times, over half the

campus—protested the firing of
Anthropology professor Bill
Allen.
Both sets of demonstrations
were militant, but explicitly
non-violent. Neither succeeded
and members of the UCSB
Radical Union were disciplined
for the Allen demonstrations.
Santa Barbara sources too scared
to be identified said that the
failure of these "peaceful" tactics
led. in part, to this week's
eruption of violence.
I nincorporated Area
Isla Vista is an unincorporated
area governed by the Santa
Barbara county supervisors,
policed by the county sheriffs,
and isolated—physically and
politically —from the population
of the county. Police and
narcotics agents have been active
in the community, and are not
highly regarded by many students.
Though many of the shops and
stores in Isla Vista are run or
owned by residents, most of the
landlords are outside realty
companies. Rents are high, and
residents complain of poor
conditions. Recently the
Associated Students tried to
negotiate contracts with the realty
companies to govern rents and
conditions. This effort failed. Last
week all but one of the realtors
rejected the contract.
The Bank of America was not
attacked merely because it was
the only bank in town. Its
imposing presence and hostile
atmosphere—for many of the
young people who save
there—contributed to youth
antagonism, but the bank had
been the scene of previous
protests. Last year the Vietnam
Moratorium staged
demonstrations at the bank,
because, according to
demonstrators, the bank's Saigon
branch played a major role in the
War effort.
Funds Withdrawn
The Bank of America has been
associated, in radical publications,
with the UC Board of Regents,
and it has been attacked by
grape-strike supporters as the
leading financier of California
grape growers. At the end of
January the Associated Students
withdrew its funds from the bank.
Tuesday night, all the bank's
windows were broken.
Wednesday, the bank was
destroyed with little opposition.
Governor Reagan has suggested
that Chicago Eight lawyer William
Kunstler, who spoke to several
thousand students on campus
Wednesday, was responsible for
encouraging the disturbances

which started Tuesday night.
Kunstler's exact relationship to
the riot is unclear, but according
to Santa Barbara radicals, the
Chicago trial has received a good
deal of interest. A New York
Times report claims that
professors and students agree
Kunstler's appearance had little to
do with rioting on Wednesday
night.
In short, Isla Vista residents
felt continually frustrated by
what they considered attacks on
their life-style, from the firing of
Bill Allen to the Chicago Trial.
Sparked by individual arrests both
Tuesday and Wednesday, they
struck out at the symbols of their
irritation—the realty companies,
the police, and Bank of America.
The youth ghetto of Isla Vista
rebelled in the same hope that
Watts rose in 1965. The young
residents wanted to force the local
powers to pay attention to their
problems to give them a voice.
Two students from Santa
Barbara will give their account of
the rioting and the causes behind
it tonight at 7:30 in Tresidder.
Two students from the University
of California at Santa Barbara will
speak at a meeting tonight at 7:30 in
Tresidder sponsored by the New
University Conference about the
developments this week in Santa
Barbara.
