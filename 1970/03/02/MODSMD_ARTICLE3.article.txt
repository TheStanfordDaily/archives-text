# History Of Frustration
## Isla Vista Is 'Youth Ghetto' 
### LENNY SIEGEL 
Isla Vista is an unincorporated
residential community ten miles
outside Santa Barbara. Adjacent
to the campus of the University of
California at Santa Barbara, Isla
Vista houses perhaps 13,000
young people—B,ooo of them
UCSB students and the rest city
college students, working youth,

and drop-outs. Isla Vista is a
Youth Ghetto.
The frustrations and
antagonisms which exploded into
three nights of rioting last week
have been long building.
Powerlessness, high rents and poor
housing conditions, alleged police
harassment, pollution, the War,
and the Chicago trial, according to

students sources, all contributed
to the uprising.
On Jan. 28 students led a sit-in
at local oil docks to protest
continuing drilling by Union Oil
and other companies in the Santa
Barbara channel. Soon afterward,
for a solid week, over 3,000
students—involving, at different
times, over half the

campus—protested the firing of
Anthropology professor Bill
Allen.
Both sets of demonstrations
were militant, but explicitly
non-violent. Neither succeeded
and members of the UCSB
Radical Union were disciplined
for the Allen demonstrations.
Santa Barbara sources too scared
to be identified said that the
failure of these "peaceful" tactics
led. in part, to this week's
eruption of violence.
I nincorporated Area
Isla Vista is an unincorporated
area governed by the Santa
Barbara county supervisors,
policed by the county sheriffs,
and isolated—physically and
politically —from the population
of the county. Police and
narcotics agents have been active
in the community, and are not
highly regarded by many students.
Though many of the shops and
stores in Isla Vista are run or
owned by residents, most of the
landlords are outside realty
companies. Rents are high, and
residents complain of poor
conditions. Recently the
Associated Students tried to
negotiate contracts with the realty
companies to govern rents and
conditions. This effort failed. Last
week all but one of the realtors
rejected the contract.
