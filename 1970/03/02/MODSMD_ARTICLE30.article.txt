# Demanding Critics, Mistrusting Youth
## Basic Science In Great Danger 
### 
Threatened in a crossfire
between demanding critics and
distrusting young people, basic
science is in great danger and with
it the nation's ability to train
young scientists to solve society's
problems, a leading nuclear
physicist told a physics seminar
here Thursday evening.
"On one side is mounting
public opinion, shared by some
members of Congress and
government, that the search for
deeper insight into natural
phenomena is an expensive
luxury," said Prof. Victor F.
Weisskopf, Physics Department
chairman at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
"This side contends basic
research should be supported only
if it promises immediate payoff in
terms of practical applications for
industry or medicine and national
defense.

"The other attack comes from
opinions held by a significant part
of the younger generation.
Science is distrusted as being the
source of industrial innovations
leading to further deterioration of
our environment, to further
destructive applications in
weaponry, and to further
developments in our society
toward a world of Orwell's '1984'.
"At best, they say, pure
science is a waste of resources
which would be better devoted to
some immediate socially useful
purposes.
"Caught between these two
wedges basic science is
threatened," warned Weisskopf.
"Its activities may be reduced
sharply within a short time.
Demoralization
"It is not only the cutting of

financial support which endangers
basic science; it is a mounting
demoralization among its rankd, a
sharply reduced influx of young
people stemming from a lack of
material support and from public
disinterest and distrust toward
science.
"This is a dangerous
development. The growing speed
of technological change, and the
growing expansion of technology
over the globe have created vast
social and technical problems
which must be attacked in order
to avoid major catastrophies.
"These problems can be solved
only by painstaking investigations
of the effects of industrialization
and by a thorough study of the
interrelation of many factors
which determine our
environment. To do so needs

more basic science, not less of it.
We will need more, not fewer,
people trained in pure research.
"The people who are involved
in fundamental research have
always proved to be the best,
reservoir of manpower for tasks
which require objectivity,
innovative ideas and imaginative
approaches.
"We need a continuous,
vigorous pursuit of basic research
in this time of crisis," Weisskopf
concluded, "for its intrinsic values
as well as for its role as a source of
brain power for the tasks we will
face in the future."


Professor Victor F. Weisskopf,
chairman of Uie Physics Department at
expressed concern over the
plight of the basic sciences at a talk
here last Thursday.
