# Concern Over Ecology Grows
## Campus Plans 'End-Day' In Connection With Environmental Teach-In 
### 
Plans for Stanford University's participation in
the nationwide April 22 Environmental Teach-In
are rapidly shaping up under the direction of a
student committee.
Organized at the national level by
Representative "Pete" McCloskey, R-Cal., and
Senator Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., local
participation will be headed by an ASSU-Stanford
Conservation Group coalition. To dramatize the
seriousness of environmental problems, April 22
will be labelled locally as END Day-Environment
Near Death.
The purpose of END Day at Stanford is to
identify current crises and problems in the
environment, and disseminate information about
their causes and cures. Plans include morning
seminars and workshops, followed by a fair in the
afternoon in the center of the main Quad. The
evening session will feature a panel of
environmental experts and national figures noted
for their interest in ecological issues. Names will be
announced at a later date.
As part of the END Day purpose of bringing
the rapidly deteriorating environment to the
public eye, a major segment of the Teach-in will
focus on specific action programs which both
Stanford and the local communities can initiate.
Therefore, participation by individuals and groups
from the surrounding communities is welcome and
en°ruraged. *
