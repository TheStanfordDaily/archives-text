# One More Ecology Group? --Ehrlich's Congress To Coordinate Others
## 
### 
Why form another population and environment
action group? To coordinate the efforts of other
nationwide groups, to influence political action in
the field and to bring an awareness of ecology to
all Americans, says Steve Mizel, representative of
the Congress on Population and Environment. "To
succeed we must get together."
The Congress, which was originally conceived
by Stanford's Dr. Paul Ehrlich and the Rev. Don
Shaw of Chicago, will convene in June.
Representatives from 250 ecology groups and
organizations who are not now engaged in the field
of population and environment are expected to
attend the meeting.
"The strength of the Congress to change our
course lies outside of the academic community
with those groups and individuals who have the
financial and political power to back up our
voices," he continued. Some of the individuals
involved include the Congress Chairman Willard
Wirtz, former Secretary of Labor, Stewart Udall,
former Secretary of the Interior, Stephanie Mills
of Planned Parenthood, as well as Stanford's Dr.
Gordon Gould and Dr. Sydney Liebes.
Mizel, a graduate student in pharmacology
announced that a fund faising campaign in the
Stanford community to aid the Congress will begin
next week in White Plaza. He urged Stanford
organizations interested in ecology to contact him
regarding joint efforts.
