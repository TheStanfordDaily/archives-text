## 
### 
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP)-
More than half the National
Guardsmen guarding the college
community of Isla Vista were
withdrawn Sunday - to the delight
of demonstrators who ran
rampant in the community last
week.
However, an estimated 200 to
300 Guardsmen remained,
supplementing at least that many
sheriff's deputies, policemen and
highway patrolmen.
Dissident students at the
University of California at Santa
Barbara said they would cause no
more trouble until all the
Guardsmen, who arrived Friday,
leave.

"We have nothing against the
Guard," remarked one girl. "But
when they leave, get ready, cause
we're going to give the nigs hell!"
The reference was o peace
officers, whom the demonstrators
battled Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday nights before Gov.
Ronald Reagan activated the
National Guard.
In the three nights the youths
burned a bank to the ground and
caused considerable damage to
other businesses, homes and cars
with rocks and bottles. A total of
136 persons, have been arrested.
The youths are protesting what
they feel is harassment by local
police, high rent and the

deplorable state of world.
In a related development, the
leader of the State Senate accused
the University administration of
failing to help law officers in
efforts to quell disorders in the
nearby Isla Vista housing area.
"No one on the other side,
including the administrators, has
given them any help," Sen. Jack
Schrade, R-San Diego, said
Saturday. He declined to name
specific members of the university
administration.
"I feel if the administration
here had used a firm hand a
month and a half ago you
wouldn't have the problems you
have here tonight," Scrade said.
