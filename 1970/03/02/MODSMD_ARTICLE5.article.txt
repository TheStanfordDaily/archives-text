# Military Okay Seems Certain For MIT Modified ROTC Plan
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
National ROTC commanding
officers are prepared to approve a
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) ROTC plan
under which military courses
would receive no credit unless
they were "regular departmental
courses taught by fully accredited
professors."
Two members of an MIT
faculty committee told the Daily
last night that they received
tentative approval of the plan in a
December 9 Pentagon meeting
with Army, Air Force, and Navy
ROTC commanders.
David Frisch and committee
chairman Fred McGarry said the

plan also prohibits the military
from invoking the punitive clause
of a cadets contract until after his
graduation from college. At
present he may be inducted any
time during his junior or senior
years if he "willfully" violates his
contract with the government.
Frisch noted that the
commanders of MlT's three
ROTC departments would
maintain the rank of professor but
would not be allowed to teach
credit courses unless they qualify
for a departmental professorship.
In the wake of the disclosure
of the MIT plan, history professor
Harold Kahn, an ROTC critic
condemned Stanford for not
getting the best deal. President
Pitzer refused comment and Vice
Provost Howard Brooks defended
Stanford's plan as the more
flexible.
'Better Negotiators'
Kahn said, "It sounds
like the people at MIT are better
negotiators than those at Stanford
- or at least less craven. On the
other hand, it appears that MIT is
still saddled with an ROTC
program, and I still maintain that
is inconsistent.
"Given the fact that MIT has a

heavier commitment to the
Department of Defense than
Stanford," he continued, it
appears that we have a long way
to go to match them.
"It also seems to suggest that
the recent Senate decision should
be thrown out," he added.
Pitzer Hesitant
Pitzer was hesitant to comment
on the new information. "It still
seems quite vague so I think we
better not comment on it,"he
said.
The President did affirm,
however, "We'll pursue anything
in the area of the punitive clauses
that we can."
Brooks, Pitzer's ROTC
negotiator with the Defense
Department, was quick to defend
Stanford's tentative plan as "more
flexible for both the faculty and
the Department of Defense" than
MlT's.
He also noted, "It is probably
easier to get officers with
technical qualifications at MIT
than here."
Professor's Rank
"You will also see," he added,
"that their plan gives ROTC
commanders the rank of
professor. If you will remember

that was a very big issue here, and
in this area the Stanford plan is
better."
Brooks emphasized that under
Stanford's departmental structure,
"just about anyone can teach a
course, so to be consistent
teaching authority could not be
limited to professors as at MIT."
Kahn denied this assertion. "I
can't see why it is inconsistent
considering the administrative
setup," he said.
Brooks also noted that in the
last week he had heard about the
possibility of modifying the
punitive clauses of Stanford
contracts as MIT has done. He
said he is in the process of
pursuing this.
MIT professor McGarry
explained that the Institute's plan
"had been preceded by quite
detailed discussions at MIT and
the Pentagon with representatives
of the services.
"But I don't know we are
getting a better deal," he said.
"We have been moving in this
direction for 10 years. The more
time we spent analyzing the
negotiations at other schools the
more we were convinced that the
MIT experience has been unique.

limited to professors as at MIT."
Kahn denied this assertion. "I
can't see why it is inconsistent
considering the administrative
setup," he said.
Brooks also noted that in the
last week he had heard about the
possibility of modifying the
punitive clauses of Stanford
contracts as MIT has done. He
said he is in the process of
pursuing this.
MIT professor McGarry
explained that the Institute's plan
"had been preceded by quite
detailed discussions at MIT and
the Pentagon with representatives
of the services.
"But I don't know we are
getting a better deal," he said.
"We have been moving in this
direction for 10 years. The more
time we spent analyzing the
negotiations at other schools the
more we were convinced that the
MIT experience has been unique.
National ROTC commanding
officers are prepared to approve a
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) ROTC plan
under which military courses
would receive no credit unless
they were "regular departmental
courses taught by fully accredited
professors."
Two members of an MIT
faculty committee told the Daily
last night that they received
tentative approval of the plan in a
December 9 Pentagon meeting
with Army, Air Force, and Navy
ROTC commanders.
David Frisch and committee
chairman Fred McGarry said the

plan also prohibits the military
from invoking the punitive clause
of a cadets contract until after his
graduation from college. At
present he may be inducted any
time during his junior or senior
years if he "willfully" violates his
contract with the government.
Frisch noted that the
commanders of MlT's three
ROTC departments would
maintain the rank of professor but
would not be allowed to teach
credit courses unless they qualify
for a departmental professorship.
In the wake of the disclosure
of the MIT plan, history professor
Harold Kahn, an ROTC critic
condemned Stanford for not
getting the best deal. President
Pitzer refused comment and Vice
Provost Howard Brooks defended
Stanford's plan as the more
flexible.
'Better Negotiators'
Kahn said, "It sounds
like the people at MIT are better
negotiators than those at Stanford
- or at least less craven. On the
other hand, it appears that MIT is
still saddled with an ROTC
program, and I still maintain that
is inconsistent.
"Given the fact that MIT has a

heavier commitment to the
Department of Defense than
Stanford," he continued, it
appears that we have a long way
to go to match them.
"It also seems to suggest that
the recent Senate decision should
be thrown out," he added.
Pitzer Hesitant
Pitzer was hesitant to comment
on the new information. "It still
seems quite vague so I think we
better not comment on it,"he
said.
The President did affirm,
however, "We'll pursue anything
in the area of the punitive clauses
that we can."
Brooks, Pitzer's ROTC
negotiator with the Defense
Department, was quick to defend
Stanford's tentative plan as "more
flexible for both the faculty and
the Department of Defense" than
MlT's.
He also noted, "It is probably
easier to get officers with
technical qualifications at MIT
than here."
Professor's Rank
"You will also see," he added,
"that their plan gives ROTC
commanders the rank of
professor. If you will remember

that was a very big issue here, and
in this area the Stanford plan is
better."
Brooks emphasized that under
Stanford's departmental structure,
"just about anyone can teach a
course, so to be consistent
teaching authority could not be
limited to professors as at MIT."
Kahn denied this assertion. "I
can't see why it is inconsistent
considering the administrative
setup," he said.
