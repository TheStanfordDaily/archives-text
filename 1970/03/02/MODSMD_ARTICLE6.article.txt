# Faculty To Reconsider ROTC Decision Today
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The entire faculty will review
today the January Academic
Senate decision on Army ROTC.
In a special meeting of the
Academic Council, an
organization composed of all
faculty members of the rank of
assistant professor and above, the
faculty will have the opportunity
of approving or rejecting the
Senate decision. The meeting, in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, begins at
3:30 p.m.
On Jan. 22, 197 0 the Senate
approved an Army proposal that
would grant limited credit to
ROTC courses approved by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. The proposal also
removed professorial status from
the ROTC instructors and
eliminated the Military Science
Department.
The special meeting was called
when two petitions were filed
with the Academic Secretary

calling for review of the Senate
action. One, signed by 141
members of the Academic
Council, and circulated by Harold
Kahn, associate prof, of history,
asks the Council to reject the
Senate action. The other, signed
by 28 members of the Academic
Senate, asks that whatever action
be taken, it be submitted to a mail
ballot.
According to H. Donald
Winbigler, Academic Secretary to
the University, the Council will
consider the motion which is in
Kahn's letter accompanying the
petition as the primary motion.
The motion for a mail ballot will
be offered as a substitute for the
Kahn motion.
The Council could approve the
Senate action, reject it and send
the ROTC issue back to the
Senate, decide to vote on the issue
by mail ballot, or devise an
entirely new Army ROTC
proposal.
According to Michael Sweeney,

a leader of the anti-ROTC New
Moratorium, members of the
"Peoples Liberation Army"
announced that I hey will stage a
"revolutionary greeting" for
faculty members as they arrive at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium for the
Academic Council meeting,
beginning with a rally at 3 p.m. on
the steps of the auditorium.
The radical group also blasted
the "cowardly" Army ROTC for
not going into the Stanford hills
for its normal battle drill
Saturday. It challenged ROTC to
reschedule the drill for White
Plaza during the Academic
Council meeting. If the ROTC
shows up, radicals promised "a
realistic reenactment of the
Vietnam War."
A debate on "Is ROTC
Desirable?" is planned for
tomorrow night in Tresidder at
7:30 between Michael Wolf, an
Army ROTC cadet, and Leonard
Siegel, member of the New
Moratorium and SDS.
